  hmmm [ \\ fireteams ?

  no . . really , line breaks please ? 
  there are several points , a mission in the moon , a cave in earth , when you get a lot of cannon fodder critters so the percentage of eneagrams you end harvesting is really high . 
  also have in mind that eneagram rarity is limited by your level , 20 to have blue and better i think, 
  well i think the chance is really really really low to worry about it, 
  anyway , get tested but at your usual timing, 
  did n't know this , thanks !, 
  well i lived in fuencarral and the weekends i stayed at home i used earplugs too , i bought them at the pharmacy ( there 's a lot of them in the area one in col\u00f3n street , another one in puebla , another in san ildefonso ... ), 
  my favourite were 3m rubber ones , once you put them right in you 're deaf :p, 
  i think the idea is speaking bad spanish ... 
  * wax on , wax off . 
  breathe in through nose , out the mouth . 
  wax on , wax off . 
  do n't forget to breathe , very important *, 
  practice makes perfection, 
  it can also be a gear thing , or perhaps you do n't use your spec to the max , pero in this game i think that has a marginal impact, 
  link to your character ? 
  what level are you ? 
  if you 're under 20 you wo n't get them ... 
  thanks i know i need all the help i can get !, 
  hmmm if you 're going from barcelona to marrakesh ... would n't it to be almost all of it through spain ? 
  anyway . . when will you do it ? 
  the route wo n't be the same in summer than in winter i think, 
  i 'd change gibraltar for granada , and most surely skip murcia and or almeria and maybe go to cadiz, 
  also , signing a homophobic treaty with russia , avoiding reforming the electoral law to a more democratic one , and cutting workers rights, 
  yep . . it gets harder to tell one from the other,

  thanks for the tip !, 
  yes , but the treaty was ratified by the congress with the psoe supporting it and voting `` yes '' to it, 
  pm me your address and you 'll get one from madrid , spain, 
  any particular subject/theme ? 
  helloooo , hot hot man, 
  amazing site !!, 
  thank you so much !, 
  thanks , it worked for me !, 
  ps4 in spain, 
  this is true , and is spain i guess for a while longer, 
  i can tell because i discover a few years ago that `` that german old man '' from my hometown was a waffen-ss lieutenant ( hauke bert pattist joustra ) a war criminal from holland, 
  yes , is a `` the enemies move against each other '' or travelling loot cave , 
  well , in ps4 remote play with the ps vita allows me to do some cardio ( stationary bycicle ) while playing, 
  edit : it was nice , only you have some problems with the gender of the things , 
  what s/he said !, 
  * `` the packet had a picture of a mexican guy with a sombrero so i think that can verify their spicy-ness credibility '' *, 
  you earn the upvote there, 
  and ... ouch !, 
  original poster, 
  i thought it was operator until someone said it in a meme identical to this one :p, 
  i think the red death card is granted trough code, 
  in fact puttanesca means `` in the style of the whore '' , being puttana the italian for whore, 
  and in spanish there 's no difference between the pronunciation of either word puttanesca/putanesca . 
  so yes , you had a typo but you 're not calling whore everyone because of it , 
  hmmm , not really, 
  only with clanmates , with randoms never ... 
  better try at [ r/catalan ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/catalan ) or [ r/catalunya ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/catalunya ), 
  thanks , never thought of this !, 
  really , thank you so much, 
  after years of lurking this sub and increasing health problems i was thinking into starting the process of losing some weight but always has a excuse ready for avoiding it, 
  this , really show me that i need to do it asap , so thank you ... 
  i think you really changed my life for so much better with this last push !, 
  being a hunter my main and created an alt of each i would say you to try a titan, 
  as it has been said , check the wiki and ask about specific issues because the wall of text to answer those generic questions can be unreadable , 
  what are you going to study ? 
  spanish ? 
  well we have our share of classical music in this city , not too many of them are free tho but with the spring and the good weather there 's several free concerts in the some of our beautiful parks, 
  as with the rest of europe you will have a ton of history of this city to learn , and there 's a lot of great historical cities within an hour or so travel ( toledo , \u00c1vila , salamanca ... ), 
  about open mic stuff . . no idea , how [ this site helps ] ( http://www.openmicmadrid.com/ ), 
  and nightlife i guess you 'll mingle perfect in the erasmus scene , 
  pm if you think i can help you in any way, 
   or a couple of trips through the raids . 
  hate storm incoming !, 
  but yes , that sounds sweet, 
  democracy , each time i 'm faced with a moral conundrum all the voices in my head vote about which way to go !, 
  in a serious tone , i think theists have no real `` moral '' just a code of conduct chose by someone else . 
  thank you !, 
  thanks . . for the bacon and because i did n't know of res until now !, 
  let 's add madrid , spain . 
  same offer ... but with better food you know , 
  unless you 're a nintendo fan and looking forward to play the new instances of same games i 'd say ps4, 
  ok , thank you !, 
  i 'll watch to see if they behave before thinking of making them shirts, 
  thanks , really eased my mind , 
  well night life in madrid is really active , with all that thing of thursdays being the new saturdays , so tuesdays are like a friday . . or smtg , i do n't know thew thing is any night you can find ppl in the bars, 
  of course the hot days are from thursday to sunday but the rest of the week have more action than other europeans cities during the weekend, 
  if you need anything just pm, 
  i think you should try at [ fireteams ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/fireteams ) or even [ fireteamsps4 ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/fireteamsps4 ), 
  thanks , never knew what that x-ray thing was !, 
  as said , several things add to this :, 
  language barrier, 
  similar options in spanish ( meneame , ascodevida ... ), 
  reddit is not really know in spain, 
  pm the address , i 'll send her smtg from spain ... 
  i hopes it gets in time !, 
  nope , this has excellent lighting, 
  no way , accessibility is far from this church . 
  and in the main hall they were n't plugged, 
  that 's what we thought but they were cold , and the benches in the main hall are n't plugged but it 's by far the more logical option,
