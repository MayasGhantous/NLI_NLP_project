  maybe because i did and his answer was `` dunno '', 
  next time i 'll wait for the bishop before wasting the time of the likes of you ... nah i know ffshitters love to `` shine '' :-p, 
  in an shrine adjacent to the main body of the church ( sorry english is not my main language and i do n't know the lingo ), 
  thank you so much , this also works great to search for spanish books since you can reduce the results by `` foreign languages '', 
  of course not only spanish but since is my language is what really make my day , 
  sure , you can ask for ibuprofeno or just ask the pharmacist, 
  i use robaxisal compuesto , now it requires recipe but before it did n't so a lot of places do n't ask for one, 
  hmmm ... hace calor means the day/weather is hot . 
  es caliente and hay calor does n't really exist . 
  est\u00e1 caliente means something is hot , the water , a door knob . 
  caliente ( better calentorro ) is horny, 
  to say someone it 's hot , in spain , we say est\u00e1 ( bien/muy ) buena for female , est\u00e1 ( bien/muy ) bueno for male , but the same can be said for eat/drinks that taste really good, 
  man we 're sure complicated :p, 
  translation , just in case, 
  god created the family, 
  vida means life, 
  it 's but have in mind that this was inside a catholic church and also in a small town so ... 
   luckily the gym teacher is going to let me retake it in his house . 
  it 's a trap !, 
  from spain here, 
  as it was previous said * anima : beyond fantasy * is from here , and to be honest be have a wide variety of games mostly to the 90 's boom, 
  one of the `` classics '' , in fact i think is the first one made in spain , is * aquelarre * ( coven/witch ' sabbaths ) with more than 4 editions and a miriad of supplements . 
  it 's called the demonic medieval role playing game so you can infer the ambient , it 's based in medieval iberian peninsula with a dark , dark mood , a lot of diseases , demons , magic , and feudal lords being ... medieval . 
  the system is , or at least was , based in the classic chaosium system ( 1d100 ) . 
  others historical games are * almog\u00e0vers * , the name of a class of soldier from many christian iberian kingdoms in the later phases of the reconquista , during the 13th and 14th centuries , * tirant lo blanc * and the * alatriste role playing game * based in the characters of same name , * far west * , * comandos de guerra * ( war commands ) based in wwii and * \u00a1 piratas !, 
  in a classic sword and sorcery the recent * aventuras en la marca del este * is the prime example . 
  with more modern theme we also have quite a few , from * phenomena * , x-files mood , to * ragnarok * more clivebarkeresque/wod one to * mutantes en la sombra * ( mutants in the shadows ) cold war , spies and powers and * superheroes inc * that is self explanatory . 
  another classic is * [ fanhunter ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fanhunter,_el_juego_de_rol_%c3%a9picodecadente ) * , the epic decadent role-playing game based in a really famous comic . 
  and theres a few more minors ones but ... who cares !, 
  so i think that the spanish production is heavily based in historic themes , quite understandable with such an `` epic '' period as the [ reconquista ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/reconquista ) and in modern times we prefer to go to the occult and dark ... who knew :p, 
  welll in november last year was changed the law allowing sefardic jews not only request for nationality but to keep the previous one ( before they could ask for it but only could have double nacionality in case they were from `` old colonies '' or portugal ) but i think this hasn ` t come into operating yet ... is usally 6 months after the publication of the law in the boe . 
  as you say in the page of the [ federaci\u00f3n de comunidades jud\u00edas de espa\u00f1a ] ( http://www.fcje.org/ ) you have all the info needed but i think since it has n't `` works '' yet it 's not as clear as it should . 
  in fact i could n't find it in the boe so i guess it has n't been published yet, 
  intercambios = exchanges as in language exchanges , 
  this please !, 
  10 days is more than enough to see all madrid, 
  i 'd suggest you to look at the tourism wiki , it 's in the sidebar, 
  so , what would you like to see/do ? 
  it 's a great movie ... but that ending felt cheap . 
  better turn down the offer than waste 3 years in there like i did, 
  well , university of nebrija seems to be located in madrid city in the francos rodriguez area , which is good because is a neighbourhood with reasonable pricing, 
  the closest metro station i think is francos rodriguez , which is linea 7 ( the orange one ) that goes thro some cheap but nice areas, 
  i do n't know your budget or if you wan na share to get the `` erasmus experience '' but please ask me any doubt , even by pm if you want, 
  i 'll take my chances and say ... no . 
  usa forever is for domestic only i think , and to use correos ( spanish usps ) you need to use their stamps, 
  hot , both pics, 
  i think you 'll have no problem with such a budget , 
  well i hope not to spoil torch song trilogy to anyone but , this scene sums up my opinion , in fact it 's been a `` motto '' of mine since i saw it, 
  [ linked to the precise moment ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=rosh_pbfov8#t=269 ), 
  spain here , got the patch yesterday, 
  well , 2 week should be enough time except in august , in august the life in the city is really slow , is the traditional month for summer holidays so it 'd be harder to find a house/renter . 
  i think the basic utilities ( electric , gas , water ) are linked to the house so maybe you wo n't be able to change company easily . 
  the internet provider , it depends on the area but [ here ] ( http://www.comparativa-adsl.info/?iva=1 ) you have a summary of the options . 
  about the bank thing , no idea ... sorry . 
  if i can help with anything else , please ask me !, 
  dunno about the shy thing , but i do know you 're hot as hell, 
  yes , please, 
  as website goes i think you should check [ idealista ] ( http://www.idealista.com/ ) or [ fotocasa ] ( http://www.fotocasa.es/ ), 
  it 's usual in spain to pay in rent in advance as a `` deposit '' in case you cause damage to the house or leave without paying , what i feel odd is that he want you to pay in advance before signing any contract , that would be a red flag to me . 
  and also if it has wifi/inet connection ( \u00bf dispone de wifi o acceso a internet ? 
  dunno , if you think of another question pm and i 'll translate it , 
  hmm , you could use some frosting or icing , if you have time to it to dry it will keep it together, 
  `` pre-cut '' it and leave the broken part at home :p, 
  first of al :, 
   even to this day ( now 23 ) i can say that im still only attracted to twinks . 
  i knew i was behind the curve in puberty and thought my tastes would change as i grew older . 
  but they have n't at all . 
  you have n't grow older yet !!, 
  in a more serious note , if you 're into young looking guys there 's nothing wrong with it , if you always keep it legal of course , and i 'm sure someday will appear the right one . 
  although i hated hear this when i was your age , is still too soon ... give time , each thing came at its own pace , relationships seems to be for everyone but oneself always until one day you realise you 're into one . 
  and do n't worry , we all are damaged , each in his own way so do n't let your baggage be the reason you ca n't enjoy the trip !, 
  i do n't think this is the right sub for this, 
  filled it out anyway :p, 
  i 'd recommend 1977 parlour in c / atocha 90something, 
  well , summing up what other ppl said, 
  it 's an old format both for postal code and phone number , the postal code matches the address if we add the 280 but as stated there 's no restaurant there . 
  the formosa restaurant seems to be old and matches the `` asian food '' thing so maybe they relocated , the `` new '' formosa phone is 91 778 91 88 so maybe they can ask there ( if they do n't speak spanish i would n't mind calling myself ), 
  the old phone , 1030886 or 7030886 with the area code 91 does n't seems to the operative any more, 
  as nocebo said it 's easier/better with an agency , but also more expensive . 
  the `` main '' websites are [ idealista ] ( http://www.idealista.com/ ) , [ fotocasa ] ( http://www.fotocasa.es/ ) and [pisos.com ] ( http://www.pisos.com/ ), 
  good luck !, 
  well , after some search it seems there 'd be no problem to buy it in a `` farmacia '' , no need to have a recipe . 
  i can check one if you want to be extra-sure, 
  ooops . . my bad !, 
  thanks, 
  [ book depository ] ( http://www.bookdepository.com/search/advanced ) has an advanced search where you can specify spanish , is free shipping and really cheap . 
  of course it is n't spanish , spanish sites will be more expensive due our high vat to books . 
  main spanish sites are [ casa del libro ] ( http://www.casadellibro.com/ ) and [ el corte ingl\u00e9s ] ( http://www.elcorteingles.es/libros/ ) and i doubt they have free shipping to turkey, 
  i think the 3rd one is about fear of animals and what we do to reduce that fear , i 'll translate it like this :, 
  which animals inspire us more fear ? 
  what is this danger in every instance ( in each animal ) ? 
  how do we protect ourselves from them ? 
  so s/he is asking what animals are seen as more dangerous ( spiders , wolves , bears , doped koalas ... :p ) , why we see them as dangerous , and what do we do to reduce that `` dangerousness '' ... 
  hope this helps, 
  even if is correct , sounds awful to me, 
  well , there 's a moment when you start your own family , even if it 's just your so and you , if members of your previous family ca n't accept that or do n't wan na be a part of your life it 's their loss, 
  i 'd state that you 'll spend more time with him , since you 'll be living together , and will have less time to do things `` alone '' , if they do n't want him at their house is their decision but that will also mean that they 'll have you far less , there 's no way you leave your so alone at home because your parents wo n't see him . 
  patience , and good luck !, 
  eventually they 'll see the wrong in their ways, 
  well , besides the annoying clapping they seems really useful .
