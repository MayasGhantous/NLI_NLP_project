  just one lil pet peeve of mine , i know that spanish verbs can be a pain in the ass to english speakers but the main point with conjugations is that one word tell information about the action ( verb ) and who does it ( person and sex usually ) , so to me when some says something like `` nosotros conocemos '' is really redundant and let me wonder why the emphasis or if there 's some `` irony '' / double meaning, 
  sorry for the mini rant , say your teacher the videos are great, 
  maybe it 's better if your address is n't post in the interwebs , you know ? 
  ok , sorry to be that guy but ... 
  damn , you 're hot !!!, 
  even with the fact that you have too much ink to my taste , but in the hot scale for sure !!, 
  go wild anytime you want !, 
  pretty please ? 
  well last time i checked sjw definition , i was hispanic but not latino so ... 
  summing up , from spain here, 
  to me it sounds like a gringo with definitely caribbean accent , i mean there are some grammatical issues that are `` gringo '' but you sounds like someone from cuba , santo domingo ... 
  btw , it 's amazing the level you have in just 6 months , and a day !!, 
  thanks for sharing , nothing better that home proved recipes !, 
  yeah !, 
  the first one to get it , please create the community !, 
  i have it , and not really useful tbh, 
  this, 
  source : born and raised in oviedo :p, 
  i always though it was the philadelfia kind , but english is not my native tongue either, 
  well , chemical castration but you now , that 's kinda barbaric . 
  but i think you 'd use some good old fashioned therapy to accept what you are and to see there 's nothing wrong with it, 
  well , yes, 
  all the time until 12 february 2012 , will give you 45 days per year until a max of 42 months . 
  the time worked since 12 february 2014 will give you 33 days per year until a max of 24 months . 
  but it depends of what kind of `` firing '' is , and sorry i 'll put this in spanish because i do n't know the right term in english :(, 
  if the company can prove the financial difficulties for 3 following quarters they can go with an `` objetivo '' . 
  anne hathaway as catwoman, 
  - how are you ? 
  well if you need more ppl i 'd happy to help, 
  first tip , if you keep the alt key pressed , type 173 and release the alt you got ... \u00a1, 
  there 's also codes for the \u00e1\u00e9\u00ed\u00f3\u00fa but i did n't miss them so much when in a foreign keyboard so i do n't know them :p, 
  in mac i think you have to add unicode hex input to keyboard  input sources ... dunno, 
  it sounds weird to me , but it could be a native speaker with bad grammar, 
  it sounds either google or just bad phrasing, 
  also that `` me dieron oro '' ... 
  well if you use a comma instead a period , it 's wrong . 
  even more if you use verbs in different forms/tenses that are not compatible in the same sentence . 
  but yes a period , and capital letter , will fix it . 
  about `` me dieron oro '' , yes you 're right it can be a translation for being reddit-gilded , did n't think about it . 
  first , you should be able to discuss any topic with your therapist ... that 's basically the point of having one . 
  so talk to your therapist about it , she is a professional and can help you better . 
  but i 'd like you to do some research for what is a homoromantic asexual , just in case , 
  han luchado contra , con could give the impression that they fight besides the carteles :p, 
  `` esto ha hecho d\u00edficil '' is technical correct , but better use `` esto ha dificultado '', 
  adem\u00e1s is ok, 
  le dijeron que le iban a matar , ok . everyone should undestand it . 
  no creo is almost always followed by a subjuntivo , but with some `` appreciation '' verbs ( creer , saber , averiguar ... ) can be followed by a verb in infinitivo, 
  better than `` haya '' use hay . 
  do n't use subjuntive to affirm something . 
  by the way when `` a '' or `` de '' are followed by and `` el '' you must join them into `` al '' and `` del '' . 
  so `` secuestraron a el campesino '' should be `` secuestraron al campesino '', 
  and that s\u00f3lo is solo , but that 's a common mistake so i would n't change it ... it gives an `` native '' air to your spanish :p, 
  thanks for posting this , i 'll send him a card from spain, 
  i 'd say that you better skip this one , the offline mode has no story whatsoever, 
  no , in fact `` ae '' is not a [ diphtong ] ( http://buscon.rae.es/dpd/srv/search?id=gov5y32dad60gszhl5 ) , it 's a [ hiatus ] ( http://buscon.rae.es/dpd/srv/search?id=x6mrfmgzwd6isl28ln ) but it 's true than in some accents they tend to `` closer '' the wovels so it may sound like a diphtong, 
  my suggestion , it is n't a dipthong but do n't worry too much about saying it like one, 
  muchas personas prefieren muchos tipos de tiendas ( this does n't makes a lot of sense , i guess you 're going for diferentes personas prefieren diferentes tipos de tiendas ) . 
  some minnors issues with gender . 
  and `` to '' not always translate into `` a '' , `` a '' in spanish is usually a '' \u00edndice funcional/transpositor '' so it 's placed more for the function than for the meaning . 
  i think it 's [ tempesta by malika ayane ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liqe2xzksks ), 
  opression olympics ... 
  spain here , from madrid and going next week to galicia ( north side of spain , lot of green and atlantic ocean ), 
  so what do you need , some pics of the stadium maybe ? 
  of just scenery ? 
  maybe some pics of you 2 over the spots ? 
  o some sign ? 
  letters ? 
  just ask , 
  puto is most used as `` fucking '' like in `` the fucking car '' `` el puto coche '' . 
  but it really means `` male prostitute '' , but we usually say chapero or gigolo . 
  in some countries ( mexico , argentina ? ... ), 
  i think puto means gay/faggot, 
  ok , you say latin spanish so maybe that 's the problem but ... it doens ' t makes sense to me at all . 
  something like this ? 
  i 'm 39 , my boyfriend is 29 . 
  been together a lil more than 3 years now, 
  ok , honestly i 'd try my best at guessing what you try to tell :, 
  le encantaba mi calor . 
   quiero llamarle ma\u00f1ana - i want to call you tomorrow, 
  if it 's `` call you '' and you use llamarle with it 's the formal way of speaking `` quiero llamarle ( a usted ) '' it sounds kinda weird with something so `` blunt '' as quiero . 
  i 'd choose `` quisiera '' . and it 's llamarla for female ( 2nd person , you ) and llamarle for male or for both in 3rd person ( s/he ), 
  i think the phrase you 're looking for is : quiero llamar ** t ** e ma\u00f1ana . 
  i do n't agree , maybe because i 'm not transphobic ... 
  even if i were i do n't think i could say `` heterosexual males taking estrogen , cross dressing '' with a straight face ( pun so intended ), 
  both , normal and wrong , 
  no , guiri is usually used only for `` white '' foreigners . 
  the quintassential guiri is a pale , soon to be sunburnt , english man . 
  i think you should look into steam link, 
  recieve oral , from anyone , is a very low risk practice, 
  [ here ] ( http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/risk/oralsex.html ) you have more info, 
  do whatever you feel , the worst regrets are the `` what ifs '' and the lost chances . 
  of course use your head and do n't do anything permanent or too risky . 
  and always use protection , in sex and against the sun , 
   then i was fucking pissed . 
  my girlfriend knew what i 'd been through , knew i was afraid of my violent tendencies and she planned this as a surprise for me ? 
  i honestly feel like it 's fucking retarded but then again , at least two of my close friends did n't think so ... but they do n't know those things about me . 
  this , i mean you sure overeacted , or better did n't realised but was really happening when you maybe should , but you gf should know that this would most surely happen . 
  i mean , besides your `` violent tendencies '' , the training is on a instinct level you ca n't reason with something that caught you offguard , your body just react . 
  a lousy move by her part to not even plan this `` surprise '' but to blame you for doing was you did ... lame . 
  maybe i think you should apologise to your friends but explaining by you reacted that way , and that your gf knew this when she planned this `` joke '' .
