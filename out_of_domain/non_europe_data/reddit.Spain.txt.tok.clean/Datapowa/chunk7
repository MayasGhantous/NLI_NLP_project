  best of lucks !, 
  looks amazing !, 
  hey it 's amazing and i really think it 's a great tool !, 
  only , as a pedantic native speaker , i 've seem some translations that are not quite right . 
  maybe you could have a way to suggest a better translation , or have some kind of `` reviewer '' that can correct the translations . 
  i could help with the few ones that i saw, 
  edit : i just made an account and i got this from the email verification link :,

  well in spain you only use it as part of `` hijo/a de la gran puta '' ... and i do n't think it 's bible related no matter the great whore of babylon, 
  this, 
  hmmm , it depends on the person but if you start with an hola but you do n't speak spanish enough to get a possibly answer in it , that would be akward, 
  and , no figure skating is not really a popular sport , and javier and fernandez are common names/surnames so maybe it wo n't ring a bell . 
  anyway , good luck !, 
  well , it 's really a no-brainer and i he values the relationship i see no point against it . 
  and speaking in smth that may seal the deal to him , depending on your line of work / `` convenio '' you 'll also get free holidays like in case of wedding . 
  to have you here living to your full potential and free holidays !!!, 
  i meant !!!, 
  just in case you need someone to convince him over some ca\u00f1as , i 'm spanish and live in madrid , 
  sorry i do n't know any of those terms but i find useful to translate tech terminology a tool like [ linguee ] ( http://www.linguee.es/ ) that provides examples and use ratios, 
  hope it helps, 
  la puerta de la nevera ( spain , venezuela ) / frigorifico ( spain ) / refrigerador ( mexico ) / heladera ( argentina ) est\u00e1 rota . 
  and the spanish word is `` cat\u00e1logo '', 
  creating profit ? 
  on a serious note , they 're user friendly and `` not menacing '', 
  project manager in it department , creating gubernamental websites , apps , and so on, 
  500 is the 55 % of the windchimes employees, 
  windchimes employees are a 25 % of the employees, 
  birdfeeders are a 10 % of the employes, 
  85 % of birdefeedes employees produces 160 % or less, 
  the math should be clear now , i guess, 
  i 'd say it 's quite similar to london , having in mind the size differences of course . 
  we have an extensive subway network : [ metro ] ( https://www.metromadrid.es/en/index.html ), 
  also a commuter trains for close cities called [ cercan\u00edas ] ( http://www.renfe.com/en/viajeros/cercanias/madrid/index.html ), 
  and also a lot of [ buses ] ( https://www.emtmadrid.es/index.aspx?lang=en-gb ), 
  it can be quite complex at first so please , ask me anything . 
  and i 'd suggest using an app like citymapper , it works better than gmaps to me .

  hi there !, 
  where are you going to live ? 
  what area ? 
  do you speak spanish ? 
  i 'd suggest you to read our wikis . 
  btw if you need anything , just pm me, 
  well , that 's malasa\u00f1a the hip and trendy neighborhood . 
  there 's a lot of things to do , and since is really comercial i think the barrier languague wo n't bother . 
  but if you want some `` local '' for some basic spanish , just ask . 
  the really basic you must know is `` una ca\u00f1a '' `` otra ca\u00f1a '' , 
  i do n't think the dating websites have survived the arrivel of tinder and the such . 
  the younger ppl find it more convinient to use an app and the older usually do n't like too much all the interwebs thing . 
  just in case to wan na try i 'd suggest [ meetic ] ( http://www.meetic.es/ ) , [ edarling ] ( http://www.edarling.es/ ) or [ badoo ] ( http://www.badoo.es/ ) depending of your age, 
  best of luck !, 
  been a lurker for a couple of years , this one i hope i can add some pics of my own !, 
  thanks ppl for the inspiration, 
  maybe because it can be an arrow or a chevron ? 
  ! remindme 7 hours, 
  sorry , it seems i ca n't make a picture with readable text ... 
  hay incluso dos puertas al lado de la otra ( sorry do n't understand what are you trying to say ) . 
  unless you can plug your pc on the tv i think the best solution is the ps4 pro even with the 30fps bummer, 
  althought there 's certain differences between regions i think that spaniards in general are a quite open and welcoming people . 
  so i 'd say it 's quite high, 
  do not buy , adopt . 
  cat or dog or both ... 
  hmmm maybe `` todo recto '', 
  your translation is acurate, 
  i think because that sentence is followed by your signature so , you say that the person who signs after this greets you . 
  yes , it 's a fixed structure and yes it 's kinda weird when you think about it , you write the letter in 1st person but use the 3rd at the signature ... 
  the translation should be the one you said . 
  no prob , 
  nor here , waiting for it to get the mass effect now that the faces are fixed, 
  querer is used to say `` love '' but also `` want '', 
  te quiero = i love you, 
  te quiero ver all\u00ed = i want to see you there, 
  even if it 's too broad a subject ... i 'd say i prefer men to women . 
  my guess is ... breakfast blues by trout fishing in america, 
  but hard to find any video, 
  i guess it 's safe now to let it out w/o making any conmotion . 
  last years , more than last decade for sure , i 'd been thinking a lot about ending it all . 
  the only thing that stops me is the pain i know i 'd cause to my mother so the plan is just keep going until that collateral disappears and then killing myself . 
  lately i got into a relationship , and get proposed and we have set a wedding date already and i do n't know if broke the engagement or just do it even if i know i 'll make him a widow asaic . 
  yeah , yeah , i know ... 
  having a tan, 
  or , dunno , a tourist ? 
  parks and recreation, 
  i 'd give too much tought to wich label applies to you , in any case and surely not in this case with two labels that are at least overlaping , if one is n't superfluous , so ... do n't worry . 
  you like ppl , that 's it, 
  hmmm , so similar weather but without the weather ? 
  i think anything in the north should be similar , also with the rain ... 
  maybe palma de mallorca ? 
  i 'm a racist , period . 
  err , no, 
  say thanks to your friend !, 
  gorgeous, 
  `` i do n't wan na die , i sometimes wish i 'd never been born at all . '', 
  most lately at least, 
  teachers,
