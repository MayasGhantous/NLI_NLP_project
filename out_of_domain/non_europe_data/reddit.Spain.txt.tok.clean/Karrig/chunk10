  a legocracy then ? 
  holy shit !, 
  you guys need to stop smoking whatever the hell was used for that !, 
  a big problem with the roman system of goverment also was that votes were more often than not bought . 
  i actually studied this in art class , there are still two chunks laking though . 
  ( also expected it being harder to find ), 
  roman = / = romania . 
  i was referring to ancient rome . 
  oh , since you replied to me i thought you were refering to my comment in roman politics . 
  it all starts with un , and that 's the united nations ... coincidence ? 
  the lira would recquire more m4s and eagles , also uncle sam . 
  to be fair spain was really fucked at the time and only the old idea of the long dead empire made the country actually go to a war that could n't be won . 
  seriously beating the spain of 1898 does n't take much . 
  i doubt it was more important than battles like stalingrad . 
  maybe the most important in the western front , but that 's still debatable . 
  but dickrhino is actually 767 !, 
  is of dangerous !, 
  last time germoney not into monies many bad things of happen !, 
  german people can into fun ? 
  oh right , the extra w\u00f6rk , sorry my spanish mind struggles with the word w\u00f6rk , does it have anything to do with extra siesta ? 
  i hope so !, 
  ca n't barrage the farage, 
  you 're not alone in your pain . 
  trianon, 
  they train at foreign beaches digging holes to put it in practice in the future and restore festung europa . 
  how can you shag sheeps if you do n't have clay ? 
  watching italians failing at war . 
  edit : i doubt you 'll need people in the land for italians to fail at war actually . 
  do n't worry the balconing will soon take care of the guiris . 
  i hate you so much ... 
  silly brits , and the only thing you do in holidays is gettind burned by the sun and jump from high heights ... 
  wait , are you training your paratroopers ? 
  i think not !, 
  strong for italian standards ? 
  does everybody in the balkans have territorial claims on their neighbourgs ? 
  that sounds familiar , i think it 's the thing people go searching northwards of the pyrenees . 
  maybe i should try that out too . 
  the pyrenees are the natural border between france and spain . 
  they still have reconquest casus belli though . 
  well we only need one casus belli : we 're rome ergo we conquer . 
  california is not a peninsula , how do they expect to be like crimea ? 
  silly muricans can not into geographical accidents . 
  now america , what have we said about lying ? 
  it 's not ri - hey !, 
  stop eating the furniture !, 
  i would like to trust you , i sure would , but i 'm affraid i can smell the peanut butter from here . 
  also are americans made out of iron and rusty ? 
  are they bombed ? 
  i 'm affraid my knowledge of regional stereotypes of americans depending on their state is limited to texas and maybe california . 
  and i said that because i do n't know what you meant with rust . 
  you thought you could pass pretending to be canada , peru ? 
  i know you do n't have a green card . 
  also baja california is of funny shape . 
  i knew he was still a nazi ... 
  the usa has some really big inferiority complex then . 
  sweden always making the rest seem undeveloped and primitive . 
  do n't the finns have some big problem with alcholism too ? 
  context : [ start of wwi ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/assassination_of_archduke_franz_ferdinand_of_austria ) and [ belgium 's fetish for hands . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/leopold_ii_of_belgium#exploitation_and_atrocities ), 
  you know how it goes : full me once , shame on you !, 
  and it 's older than many african countries . 
  ssshh , sealand actually believes he 's relevant , dr. \u00d6sterreich is still studying his case . 
  to be fair , it did a very good job [ beating up ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_rape_of_belgium ) belgium . 
  specially if you have gold and/or silver . 
  oh wait , it 's netherlands ? 
  i missed them . 
  at least in spain the j it 's a manly j , closer to the greek pronunciation . 
  now , now peru . 
  i recognise a silver mine when i see one . 
  they knew what they did wrong to deserve such fate . 
  who said you did n't ? 
  they put dirty etruscans as monarch before we became spqr , the last ones were shit so we killed and almost destroyed not only them , but all record of their existence . 
  rome in that time was young , the etruscans were killed after the last roman king , if i recall correctly there were only 7 , the first one being romulus . 
  so , yeah , butthurt , but they ended up getting genocided . 
  did you heard that serbia ? 
  we can remove things and you not !, 
  we do n't use v and u , they are the same letter in latin ( the classical latin not the one revived during the renaissence ) . 
  the modern `` u '' in latin is ` v ' for capital letter and ` u ' for minuscule , during the renaissence , when the classical world was rediscovered they used both to differentiate when they fell near another vocal like `` video '' , which means to watch , in classical latin would 've been `` video '' and `` uideo '' . 
  so it crisps my nerves when someone tries to make a `` romanization '' of a word and just switches u for v when writing in minuscule . 
  it existed , and with the current pronunciation , the inexistent one was the v , who was only the capitalization of u. 
  and probably had that shape because it was easier to write in stone . 
  you say it like being conquered by romans is a bad thing . 
  of no problem, 
  we call it * imperium *, 
  you do n't use roman numerals for centuries ? 
  you just write 19th century instead of xix century ? 
  no , no , no . 
  roman numerals is for civilized people . 
  do not listen to those barbarians poland !, 
  they do n't make miracles . 
  none , actually .
