  over my dead , imperialistic , habsburgist body !, 
  pls , you should already know that change of government in castle cuntryballs is short-lived . 
  and ends in traumatizing punishments . 
  just look at maxi 's failed plot to overthrow hansa : he ended up absorbed by sidebard and shat in the most epic shitstorm since israel-palestine . 
  rs2k got his cock bitten off and vorsprung is probably earning below the minimal wage . 
  keine worries darling , the long hand of modship can not get you here . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ only ^ ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ ^ short , ^ ^ ^ ^ corrupted ^ ^ ^ ^ hand ^ ^ ^ ^ of ^ ^ ^ ^ cuntryballs ^ ^ ^ ^ modship . 
  he 's become an in-joke . 
  and then otto men slave for centuries . 
  after that little incident they had i 'm surprised they can even process the pass of time . 
  this comic is offensive !, 
  estonia is not slow !, 
  we would 've seen latvia stealing our potato right away !, 
  i 've seen so many times the slogan `` white pride world wide '' that it no longer has a meaning . 
  other japanese . 
  brood rine must stay pure, 
  at least we know why he 's called hungary now . 
  do n't blame me . 
  blame society . 
  it 's like a sock really . 
  you call it genocide , i call it redecoration . 
  i invented the _ rectal pickelhaube \u2122 _ after all . 
  where i come from people that oppose vaccination are labelled as idiots . 
  they tend to be over 90 and do n't leave their house . 
  it does specify the percentage of eu and non-eu immigrants tho . 
  i wish you luck . 
  makes the word longer , have to type more . 
  radetzky was a loyal subject of the austrian empire belonging to the habsburg crown . 
  there 's nothing more to it bohemia . 
  a town full of idiots, 
  where did you get such idea ? 
  was n't the csa a confederacy as well ? 
  they are isolationist , rich and live surrounded by mountains . 
  perfect scenario for some good ol' xenophobia . 
  til my shako is confederate grey ... 
  i wish i was in dixie , hooray !, 
  hooray !, 
  everything has a price , even being nice . 
  you 're south american so i assume you know where this is going . 
  yes , unless the earth is upside-down now . 
  he already likes it here . 
  you heard it here first folks , hansa is a brony . 
  he says that mlp ( my little pony , what broneis watch ) is sacred to him at some point in the comic . 
  you 'll find out that serbia gets mentioned quite often around these parts . 
  the kingdom of greece is willing to relinquish it 's claim towards albania and the dodecanese since they are controlled by italy ( / u/spitfire333 ) , a nation that shed blood alongside ours in the great war . 
  as long as the rights of the greeks living there are guaranteed . 
  the royalists maybe ? 
  then again for what they achieved might as well stayed home . 
  hellas stronkest of all we make fast reconstruction of byzantine empire muh \u0392\u0391\u03a3\u0399\u039b\u0395\u03a9\u03a3, 
  yellow rat pls , first fight someone who is n't unarmed korean peasants . 
  but golden dawn are noisier . 
  it always does . 
  not like anyone can recognise such silly flag anyways . 
  are you trying to say that moon nazis do not exist ? 
  work is a sin against god . 
  just call in sick and construct an elaborate web of lies to make sure the person interested in making you work wo n't know exactly what is going on . 
  you just need to convince yourself that the lie is the truth and they will eventually submit . 
  note : this may backfire if you doubt even slightly of your web of lies , you must keep blind faith on it , it 's the one that makes you not w\u00f6rk after all . 
  it takes years of practice . 
  ruled by germans ? 
  you mean the visigoths ? 
  or the habsburgs ? 
  because both ended up becoming spanish . 
  the visigoth lasted next to nothing and could n't curve the power of the old roman patricians in hispania and the habsburgs ended up becoming the masters of incest . 
   nobody knows where it landed . 
  [ you sure about that ? 
  is actually russia xaxaxaxaxa, 
  this is screaming for a dmowski x pi\u0142sudski erotica, 
  back on topic : will they legalize gay marriage so their love can finally be consumated ? 
  greece will cheer for you with an orthodox monk and a gyros . 
  ## now _ this _ is a hat, 
  cameroon means shrimp ? 
  interesting to know ... 
  probably because it 's hard to draw, 
   [ ... ] and then he impaled the sultan with his mighty stake [ ... ] praise the great shrimp [ ... ], 
  the shrimp knows no boundaries . 
  everyone says that , until they see what lies under the _ tower of doom \u2122 _, 
  there 's nothing to be understood . 
  i do n't see anything weird with the text . 
  pls that 's too vulgar , castilla speaks with class . 
  they did n't teach you the most common swear words ? 
  what shitty spanish class did you receive ? 
  you should sue them . 
  i know , right ? 
  depends what you consider dialogue , substitute everything with paella , cal\u00e7ots and pizza and it 's the same . 
  i prefer the term accidental un-credited inspiration by heavens . 
  the first thing that one learns from a language are insults and curse words . 
  and that 's like 85 % of the dialogue in the comic . 
  that 's because latin american spanish is unable to properly pronounce . 
  ### i assume thrace includes ~ ~ istambul ~ ~ constantinopolis ? 
  ### ap brate the italian question has already been dealth with, 
  ### hmmm ... perhaps a bottle of rakija would make me less worried ... 
  i did n't expect an american to do so . 
  i see that per\u00fa learned well . 
  who would 've guessed when we came there that those flower-loving hippy incas would become such good apprentices ? 
  still waiting for un to recognise sealand . 
  ### they could n't recognise proper , orthodox russia if it were to hit them right under their noses . 
  jews got bored and wanted to distract themselves . 
  governmental buildings were meant to be neo-classicist !, 
  teach by example .
