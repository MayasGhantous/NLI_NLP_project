  you call it treason , i call it reclaiming what is mine from divine right . 
  do n't mind if i do . 
  pls it 's not a rebellion , it 's a _ restoration _ . 
  to build you must destroy first . 
  but this time it will be rebuilt to _ my _ wishing . 
  also i will use forced labour to get it done , way more efficient . 
  if they do n't want to build they 'll get a certain object with a pointy bit up their rectums . 
  soon my dear hansito you will find out with your own body . 
  no one makes a spaniard work and survives to tell the tale . 
  pls , a spaniard has never lost a civil war ( since it being a civil war some spaniard must ultimately win ) . 
  and if history has taught me anythign is that you can do like the carlist and rebel as many times as you want . 
  unless you 're a woman , they do n't like women rebelling for some reason . 
  probably because they 'll fight better than them , i mean , seriously , three wars and they did n't win . 
  so much for three times ' the charm , huh ? 
  but enough chit-chat , we 're at war , and the only words i 'll give you are n't going be nice !, 
  ^ ^ bloody ^ ^ ` ell ^ ^ it 's ^ ^ been ^ ^ so ^ ^ long ^ ^ since ^ ^ the ^ ^ last ^ ^ time ^ ^ i ^ ^ drew ^ ^ a ^ ^ comic ... 
  rise up with me and you shall receive benefits once i 'm in power . 
  / u/hansafan i war yuo, 
  you might feel invigorated , but i 'm dead tired . 
  rebelling is a tiresome business . 
  here 's hoping someone takes the torch of revolution in my place . 
  i do n't think anyone actually knows for sure . 
  i 'm perfectly aware that they are different i just thought the `` torch of revoluton '' soudned better than the `` torch of rebelling '' . 
  because it 's not nsfw, 
  pls , we all know that certain curse with the golden dildo is making your shape ... _ decay _, 
  well , since you 're already there be a dearie and bring back some lube , we will need it in the coming days . 
  they like it rough there . 
  so no . 
  what ?!, 
  you get your ass back here and fight with me to take down hansa !, 
  ## pa\u00edses bajos espa\u00f1oles , just as the name implies , are rightful spanish clay, 
  and now i wait . 
  the slaves . 
  why yes i am a genius . 
  t'was about time my greatness was recognised . 
  it better be , i put good effort into this . 
  i 'm not sure if we enforce the no photorealistic thingie like in the main sub but , eh fuck it . 
  just avoid using it and yadda yadda . 
  approved . 
  what you need ? 
  a _ plaza de toros _ ( bullfighting arena as you said ) is probably the most general building for all of spain ( practised in the whole country until 2012 when it was outlawed in catalonia ) and also the easiest to recognise for foreigners . 
  plus it has a distinct shape . 
  half of the castle was built with gold , there must be some left , somewhere . 
  i can _ feel _ the gold inside me . 
  i must acquire it !, 
  i think you 're somwhere near the castle , since your schei\u00dfecannon blew up the penis tower . 
  go forth herr gro\u00dfe torte and make a comic !, 
  cyrillic is a drunk slav trying to write greek and , to avoid failure , using a ruler as guide . 
  from the creatos of `` why you spit in polan 's honour ?! '', 
  comes this summer 's new catchphrase `` how _ dare _ you tarnish the reputation of the us of a ( god bless ) ?! '', 
   the french colonial empire was the 2nd biggest ever . 
  you tell good joke . 
  i say , this opens a debate . 
  should newcomers fuck around comment sections like the regulars to get a better grasp of the place , or blindly charge in and see what happens and let the place grasp you ? 
  well / u/malta3 inserted himself into the story , albeit with previously asked approval , but i can see your point . 
  i do n't think self-inserting is _ that _ bad if done correctly . 
  / u/jpaolo did it as well and it spawned more comics . 
  i do think that newcomers should do some non-meta comics beforehand , but that 's mainly because we need content . 
  i think the actual important thing is fucking around the comments , get other people to know you because otherwise if they know fuck all about you what will they do with you as a character ? 
  now , i 'm not asking for a whole character sheet , because i sure as fuck would n't write nor read one . 
  but just chat a bit so people know something about you aside from your flair . 
  of course making actual non-meta comics helps because everyone likes content and everyone likes people who make that content . 
  to summarize : pls draw comics am depleted of ideas ; _ ;, 
  neither i am , for i got myself into it too . 
  regarding characters , that 's an interesting point . 
  i mean there do n't tend to be more than 8 or 10 used regularly . 
  we should get / u/hansafan in here and see what he thinks . 
  only if you wear a spanish empire flair and accept that the netherlands ' true name is `` pa\u00edses bajos espa\u00f1oles '' . 
  the visigoths did n't settle en masse into iberia what are you on about ? 
  florida pls . 
  ( reminder to self : add spanish empire flair ), 
  i know , and that 's why you have the right to have different coloured polan flair . 
  dare you accuse me ? 
  turns out we do n't actually have a spanish empire flair . 
  the mongolians sure did make a flag that truly represented their nation . 
  yes that 's why everyone here looks so distinctly germanic . 
  let 's leave alone the fact that the visigothic kingdom did n't last much before the moors invaded and that they did n't like that much mixing with locals because , amongst other thinks , they did n't follow the same branch of christianism . 
  asturias is more celtic than visigothic . 
  so , if they do not look like germans , they do not speak a germanic language nor do they have germanic customs . 
  what the fuck does it matters their roots ? 
  they might as well be the basques . 
  you did n't hear this from me , but ... ^ ^ you ^ ^ can ^ ^ always ^ ^ link ^ ^ the ^ ^ original ^ ^ last ^ ^ panel ^ ^ in ^ ^ the ^ ^ comments . 
  death or glory, 
  that 's a very nice looking fire . 
  a cleansing fire . 
  seems like brasil is determined to get rid of the remaining amazonic tribes . 
  if you do it i 'll give you [ what you most desire ... ] ( http://i.imgur.com/kixdayi.png ), 
  algeria sure is desperate to start raping berber . 
  fucking gabachos , why do they have to always be right ? 
  did you know that [ zhang zongchang ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zhang_zongchang ) is the most based chinese to ever set foot in this earth ever ? 
  a reference to the events of august the first of 1927 . 
  basically when the commies started their war . 
  for every hour after the deadline that you take to post the comic the byzantine tile will become smaller . 
  i see someone is projecting like an artillery . 
  should i be surprised , mr. 
  tainted blood ? 
  _ grumble _ you shall live today sudpreu\u00dfen _ grumble _, 
  also i 'm _ always _ relevant, 
  one never gets it like it 's in their head ; _ ;, 
  if you 're trying to get the _ shitposter wings _ you 're in tough luck , i 'm definetly going to win them with my unfinished series .
