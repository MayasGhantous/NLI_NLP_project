  yes i 'm still trying to forget your very existance . 
  spain 's current flag is no better , but at least it has n't gotten to the levels of portugal . 
  ## filipinas come back we promis no slavery this time, 
  olivenza is rightful extremaduran clay and will always be !, 
  [ implying you could win a proper war without your boyfriend uk helping you or we being more bussy with more relevant countries ] ( #green - text ), 
  one battle and a war that happened more than 5 centuries ago ? 
  that 's all you got ? 
  i mean , we tend to relish in our old glories , but at least they were , well , glorious . 
  no wonder poortugal is so shit . 
  pls , to get pissed i would have to care about portugal , which i really do n't , i care more about andorra than a poor rectangle to the west . 
  so while you worry about wars we did n't even try to win we will focus on more important matters . 
  like laying the foundations for another civil war . 
  the first i know but what the fuck is the second ? 
  if you take ceuta you also keep the immigrants . 
  that might explain why we even bothered to make a union with such a shitty piece of land in the first place . 
  true , it was so useless it barely counts as usable land . 
  yes , but never your land itself , we already have galicia . 
  is belgium 's a sausage or a potato in disguise ? 
  tercios viejos just got a whole new meaning . 
  they were only considered european because of british military bases and being partially greek . 
  after 2008 we should 've declared them middle easterners and be done with it . 
  together with greece . 
  so _ that 's _ how the heavenly kingdom formed ... 
  it has a coastline , i think . 
  greater east asia co-prosperity sphere 2.0 cultural boogaloo, 
  late to the party as always but , out of all people , i thought the filipinos would n't be too kind on the basques . 
  it 's not necessary to arm cannon fodder to make them effective . 
  this is just glorious . 
  no other way to describe it . 
  i would say that they wo n't be too friendly towards the people that have a statue of a conquistador stepping over the head of a filipino . 
  do n't they have droughts every summer ? 
  then why were you so pissed when the japs made you that nice firework show ? 
  i have already , and i must say that ** man ** churia was n't represented manly enough . 
  stinky traitors , ** man ** churia shall prevail !, 
  filthy han , you may grow fat and complacent , but soon ** man ** churia will raise again and retake its rightful place !, 
  ** man ** churia fights with strength of manchu peoples is unbeaten people 's rpeublic of filthy han is doom, 
  murcia 's day is supposed to be on the 9th of june , but everyone here is always talking about the 4th of july for murcia for some reason , i would complain but as the saying goes , when in rome do as the romans do . 
  [ original thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/polandball/comments/29th1w/and_then_murcia_was_born/ ), 
  much obligued . 
  i thought of it , but what the fuck am i supposed to joke about cantabria ? 
  there 's literally nothing there . 
  aside from the bank . 
  also i did n't want to make the mods shutdown the `` polandball map of x '' trend due to massive overflow . 
  hard to just forget one of 17 autonomous communities , and i 'm not in the mood to deal with some butthurt demi-cetlic northerner thinking his shit-community is relevant . 
  and look at it now , only relevant when espa\u00f1a directo talks about how they have no water . 
  do i get a prize if i answer correctly ? 
  no , `` acho '' is a diminutive of `` muchacho '' , equivalent in some parts of spain to `` dude '' in english . 
  now i remembered thanks to you . 
  if it takes away this heat i 'm ok . 
  take it , but you must build a wall around it to make sure no andalusians get out or there 's no deal . 
  half your continent has already moved here , what else do you want ? 
  you should get in line if you want reparations , it 's not a short one , and no one has ever received one . 
  it also involves dealing with spanish bureaucracy , so i suggest you forget about getting any reparation at all . 
  \u00d1e , they are so irrelevant that they are n't even able to produce good butthurt , all they have is caves with silly paintings on them . 
  jewish conspiracy . 
  seems like romania got a taste of his own medicine . 
  tho they got impaling partially wrong , it 's supposed to be in the anus . 
  when will they copy good cars ? 
  i never said americans did . 
  for all i 'm concerned american car industry died somewhere between the 60s and 70s . 
  why should i care about ` murica when i have that in enlightened yurop ? 
  meh , ford is just average nowadays . 
  i 'll always say the same , chevrolet died a horrible death around the 70s and someone has been wearing its face pretending to be it ever since . 
  humor shall never bow down before accuracy . 
  if you do that i 'm voting for kicking you out of the eu . 
  i do n't want to suffer hyperinflation thank you very much . 
  i do n't think lithuania wants anything to do with poland nowadays . 
  give greece a break , china has waaaaay more people to generate poverty than greece has , it 's unfair !, 
  moustaches are verbotten . 
  i could just make him a caveman , for that is what it is . 
  that 's all of northern spain tho . 
  i 'll concede you that . 
  and look at them now , surely the fire of riots produces light . 
  what the fuck happened to ireland on that map ? 
  removed . 
  also crappy ifunny watermark . 
  rules are rules , i did n't write them i just enforce them . 
  many people seem to dislike polandball reddit because of them , so they went to other communities and made their comics there . 
  which is fine , but to post here you must follow the rules . 
  colombiqu\u00e9 ? 
  closest thing i can think of is cristobal col\u00f3n . 
  nope , does n't ring a bell .

  people in the us probably do n't hear much about other countries ' internal politics . 
  my most faithful muse , sleep depravation , has finally digned to visit me yet again and give me a short and silly idea for a comic . 
  this , my fellow gentlecunts , is true classic porn in the strictest sense of the word . 
  so now the rest will be fighting for 2nd and 3rd place . 
  squint your eyes hard enough and it will appear to be `` gulf war '' written as if it was using arabic script . 
  oh true , so the rest will be hoping for one of them to not be present and then fight for the third place . 
   faux script deported to syberia, 
  if you gather a team and tell the mods in advance and get to work on it , yes . 
  how can it be rightful italian clay when italy is a non-country ??? 
  checkmate sardinians . 
  italy could lose even when invading empty clay . 
  that 's what they do .
