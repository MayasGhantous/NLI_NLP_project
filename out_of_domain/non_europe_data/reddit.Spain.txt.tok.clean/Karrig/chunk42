  \u00d1e , i never enjoyed facebook polandball pages , the fucking image viewer is literally hitler . 
  the communist overtaking of polandball has begun !, 
  seriously now , congratulations !, 
  finally a non-anglo comic makes it to the top spot . 
  and a really good one at that . 
  i would never say capiche . 
  i 'm deeply offended . 
  sexually explicit comics is the whole point of the sub . 
  it 's called * cunt * ryballs for a reason . 
  / r/polandball ? 
  the facebook polandball pages ? 
  i do n't know . 
  all i know is that this is our safe haven for dick jokes . 
  i 'm affraid i have to remove this . 
  i see no punchline or any actual humour going on , not even dicks which tends to give you a free pass around here . 
  it is the point of the sub yes , for regular polandball comics there 's always / r/polandball . 
  and if you just want to do absurdist single panels you can always start your own sub , maybe it even gets popular who knows . 
  they do n't have ammo for the guns . 
  ## burn the churches in the n\u00c6me of \u00d8ilmon\u00c6ys, 
  yugorape is an untapped oil well in the cuntryballs realm , should get to fixing that some day . 
  ## dawaj na ring, 
  line tool , removed . 
  the screen . 
  panel borders are absolutely halal . 
  it 's gone, 
  ## denmark is a dick and no one can deny it, 
  you ca n't fight facts, 
  it should n't ? 
  ## motostrelki ca n't stop norwegian conscripts, 
  right now ? 
  nah too late , perhaps tomorrow if it 's at a sensible hour . 
  life is hard and unforgiving ; _ ;, 
  horizontal comic ? 
  i knew that brasilians were funny in the head , but not * that * much . 
  well [ it is n't the first time ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/cuntryballs/comments/1ykbwz/where_is_glorious_leader/ ) that someone posts complaining about inactivity . 
  in my defense , the ball ia in / u/hansafan 's lawn . 
  [ genug gesagt ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/rey_carlos_ii.jpg/245px-rey_carlos_ii.jpg ),

  so i assume you 're workign on that book inside the 24/7 bouffet you spend the day in ? 
  my point still stands tho , for claiming to be austrian you are surprisingly lazy , are you sure your ancestry does not come from further east ? 
  perhaps with a few surnames ending in - ic ? 
  i have documents that prove otherwise , which i assume would greatly damage your image and kanzelorship if they ever saw the light of day , now i 'm not saying that they will be released , but i 'm not saying they wo n't either . 
  all i 'm saying is that if you want to ensure that these documents stay in the dark you 'll have to be very persuasive . 
  you ... know what i want ... 
  ## i remember the ol' days with only 30k subscribers, 
  ## old fart make way, 
  ## arriba murcia, 
  more fresh meat thrown into the diabolic engine that is / u/polandballmod, 
  did they drown the helmets in shoe polish or what ? 
  that czech anti-tank halftrack stolen from the wehrmacht . 
  i was never able to remember its name ever since i started calling it `` the can opener '', 
  the jews did this, 
  wot ? 
  it says flandes , as is its proper name . 
  i know . 
  i just do n't know why you are so insulted . 
  i was suggested that to learn german first i must get rid of any and all humour sense . 
  only flandes is called flandes , the rest is pa\u00edses bajos espa\u00f1oles . 
  that sounds like effort tho . 
  no it 's still pa\u00edses bajos espa\u00f1oles , it 's just that the only worthy place in it is flandes , so it 's the only thing worth labelling . 
  getting into every single war you can tends to not be very helpful to the royal arks . 
  we all know germany is led by northerners . 
  there 's work in portugal ??? 
  i 'm actually spanish m8, 
  they also have less people, 
  that 's only because they can spread them amongst the tourist hotspots more easily . 
  i know , it 's wrong intentionally . 
  seems like a heavenly signal to me , i hereby proclaim it canon . 
  what ? 
  how is that comparable to joking about terrorism ? 
  if you get offended by a joke like that you have some thin skin man . 
  specially if we consider how often mallorqu\u00edn is made fun of within the catalan speaking world for being virtually incomprehensible for anyone outside those island . 
  edit : accidentaly a word, 
  except switzerland does n't survive only on tourism, 
  gibraltar should be sank to the bottom of the ocean so everyone can shut up about that rock . 
  since i already speak catalan i would go with portuguese . 
   in terms of memology - which people are most commonly used for memes in spain ? 
  [ people from lepe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lepe ), 
  is n't the second one a porra ? 
  ( a very long one at that ), 
  i live in catalonia and we have both churros and porras , churros are like those in madrid and porras like those in the south , i thought it was like that everywhere else ? 
   many do n't like when a german comes with his high-german and expects the local swiss to adapt to it ( since they master it as well , but it 's not their freaking mothertongue ) . 
  same with spanish vs catalan . 
  how exactly is that like spanish and catalan ? 
  so what the shit are they supposed to do to communicate if they do n't know catalan ? 
  yeah except germans do n't speak turkishs , everyone in spain knows spanish . 
  i 'm not saying they should n't learn the local language , but virtually everyone that emgirates to places like catalonia does so because of work-related reasons , and they already have enough with what they have to , on top of that , have to go to an academy to learn catalan . 
  and judging from other comments of yours in this thread i 'm starting to feel you 're more of the ultranationalist kind of person , and i lack the patience for those . 
  huh , til, 
  you literally want to force people to adapt , not put tools in palce for them to do so , but to force them . 
  there 's a key difference there , one thing is to put the resources available for them to adapt , the other is to force them to do so . 
  the turkish example falls flat in its face because it 's people from a different country going to another one that does n't even belong to the same language family . 
  another example : a french going to italy , he 'll have to learn italian because the locals do n't speak french . 
  in spain everybody knows ( or should ) know spanish . 
  do you see the difference now ? 
  yeah and that has happened since time inmemorial , you ca n't stop the death of a language without a big enough population willing to speak it , languages are a tool to communciate , if they stop being useful to communicate , they stop being used . 
  to be fair we pretty much inherited franco 's system which allowed for corruption to flow freely , of course the apathy of the people does n't help one bit . 
  sadly it does n't seem like it 's going to change any time soon . 
  was there ever any serious effort to get the remaining neutral countries in europe ( the netherlands , spain , the nordic countries ... ) involved in the war ? 
  no the civil war occured from 1936 to 1939,
