i personally think that may 13 is pretty packed full . 
  i spent a whole day in odaiba itself , so you may want to spread out the activities here between days 3 and 4 . 
  if you have a full day for himeji you might be interested in going to mt.shosha close by too . 
  i spent two weeks in tokyo on my first trip to japan , and honestly i could 've stayed longer . 
  i do n't know if my experience would be of use to you since i was there as a tourist and definitely acted like one though . 
  i actually did talk to many people even if i was travelling solo , for example i met this guy while waiting in line for a restaurant in shibuya and we sat down and ate together . 
  another time i asked a girl for directions to the station and walked with her + train ride for twenty minutes until she got off . 
  i think that japanese people can be considered more reserved than , say , people from the us , but since i am also pretty reserved it worked out great for me . 
  i never felt alone but was n't tired of socialising either . 
  they were much more polite -- and dare i say helpful -- than people are here in spain where i live . 
  for me the only moment when it was n't that great was when i got sick and i threw away my plans for the next couple of days to go home and sulk . 
  the rest of the time , i 'd say the opposite . 
  i was so constantly excited to be there that i did n't know where to look , it was exhausting in a good way . 
  i do think staying in tokyo for a month or so could be a good idea to try it out , maybe stay a bit longer in a future once you know what to expect . 
  there are a few places where you can work at a hostel a few hours every day and they give you free accommodation during your stay , maybe that could interest you and save you looking for the trouble of finding a house . 
  i 'm not sure if you need a working visa for that though ? 
  sumiyoshi taisha is pretty close to the airport , it opens at 6am . 
  most people use http://www.japan-guide.com/ for ideas on what to see ( though i think it 's a bit superficial it 's okay for a first timer ) , it 'll also give you basic travel info . 
  use http://www.hyperdia.com/ for help with train connections . 
  you might want to look into staying somewhere nearby out of the city like realarc said ; miyajima itself , though they 're pretty expensive ( i think http://ryoso-kawaguchi.jp/e.index.htm is the cheapest ? 
  i 've stayed in j-hoppers ( http://hiroshima.j-hoppers.com/j_index.html ) and santiago guesthouse ( http://hiroshima.sansansantiago.com/facilities.html ) . 
  both are guesthouses / hostels , which you said you did n't want , but they were very comfortable and i think you 'd be fine there even if you 're tired from the plane . 
  hostels in japan are in great conditions and i always try to stay there . 
  i guess it 's just luck finding a place that is n't fully booked . 
  i do n't know exactly which route that is , but there 's plenty to do along lake biwa and nearby . 
  shirahige jinja is what first comes to mind , if you 're in the area do n't miss that !, 
  it 's an alternative if you ca n't get to miyajima to see the floating torii gate . 
  and type ` \u95a2\u30b1\u539f\u753a\u6b74\u53f2\u6c11\u4fd7\u8cc7\u6599\u9928 ' into google maps for the location of the sekigahara battlefield , where the famous sekigahara battle took place . 
  tsukubusuma shrine is on an island in the middle of lake biwa ( chikubu-jima ) , though the shrine in itself is n't spectacular , taking a boat on the lake is fun : http://www.jnto.go.jp/eng/location/spot/shritemp/tsukubusumajinja.html, 
  there 's also a chopstick museum between kyoto and lake biwa ( search for \u304a\u7bb8\u306e\u304a\u304a\u3057\u305f ) : http://kyotofoodie.com/kyoto-kodaiji-chopstick-workshop-store/, 
  and i do n't think these are along you 're route , but stops at omihachiman and hikone can be cool too : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjhxtck4s-e, 
  uriwari no taki waterfall and sotomo ( http://www.fuku-e.com/lang/english/places_to_visit/beautiful_view.php ) are closer to tsuruga . 
  do n't forget tsuruga museum street and kehi shrine if you are going up there . 
  ups , sorry , i read nagoya instead of nagano . 
  scratch the sekigahara battlefield and omihachiman and hikone then ( i 'll leave them here in case anyone is interested though ) . 
  i 've just looked up the thunderbird route and it looks like it stops in fukui . 
  eiheiji , ichij\u014ddani asakura family historic ruins , echizen \u014cno castle and , if you 're into dinosaurs , the fukui prefectural dinosaur museum are all up there , though a bit far away from the city centre . 
  if you 're going to kanazawa do n't forget to check out kenroku-en , so-called one of the ` 3 top gardens ' of japan . 
  kanazawa also has important geisha ( and samurai ) districts , so i think it deserves some time if you can . 
  honestly , i think stopping along this route in many places can be more interesting than kyoto itself . 
  with a bit of research you 'll have a great time . 
  good luck !, 
  i 'm not really embarrassed about it , but i do love watching videos of car / train routes ( filming the tracks or the road in front ) . 
  i went to tokyo for two weeks as my first solo trip ( also low-budget and unguided when i was 19 ) so you can definitely do it . 
  it 's best to do the booking for wherever you 'll be sleeping as soon as possible though , summer might not be the best time as of short notice ( summer holidays for the kids , obon , lots of people travelling ) . 
  i loved takasaki ( home of the daruma doll ), 
  with 4 days in shikoku you obviously wo n't be able to do the whole pilgrimage , it takes about 60 days or so if walking the whole thing . 
  if you want to know what it 's like , i found this guy describes it pretty well : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx_e9nlgr70, 
  i suggest you visit the iya valley while in shikoku , and ozu / uchiko might be interesting too . 
  other than that , there is plenty to do in the four main cities ( tokushima , matsuyama , kochi , takamatsu ) : http://www.tourismshikoku.org/, 
  i 'm planning to do the shikoku pilgrimage soon , including sightseeing along the way , so i 'll be there for around two-three months . 
  there 's really plenty to do in shikoku ( especially if you 're a slow paced traveller like myself ) . 
  this is the map i 'm using for planning my trip : https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1dghmooxwuh5zgog0mkjiavqdjio , it 'll help you locating places and ideas on things to do if you 're interested . 
  ( the ` shikoku tourism ' layer and ` islands ' are for , well , sightseeing , both inland and on a few islands that have ferries departing from shikoku , and the other four layers with the kanji names belong to temples along the shikoku pilgrimage ), 
  haha , yeah , that 's where i first heard about them xd, 
  i 'm using many sites :p, 
  this is a good introduction page : http://www.shikokuhenrotrail.com/ for starting the planning . 
  it includes information about the temples , basic gear , a few maps and sutras ... 
  for help on moving around i 'm using http://wwwtb.mlit.go.jp/shikoku/88navi/en/ which describes how to get to each temple pretty easily using public transport . 
  for ( mostly free or really cheap ) lodging http://walkingmylife.weebly.com/lodgings.html has a list , though they are pretty hard to find on google maps since it does n't really give you the directions . 
  the maps i gave you do have a layer of cheaper lodging too , mostly hostels . 
  another thing that helps a lot are the trip reports i 've been reading . 
  of course since there are 88 temples , it ends up being quite long to read through the whole thing but it can help you decide which area you 'd want to walk . 
  the ones i 'm reading as of now are http://pamnjeff.com/shikoku/?p=162 , https://cpetersky.wordpress.com/ and https://leighwalksshikoku.wordpress.com/, 
  if you have any specific questions about the pilgrimage , this forum http://shikokuhenro.conforums.com/index.cgi answers any and all questions you may have . 
  and i just found this page in my tabs http://www.tourismshikoku.org/brochures/ that has many brochures of sightseeing around shikoku that may interest you . 
  best time of my life xd, 
  https://tokyoanecdote.wordpress.com/2016/01/01/planning/ here was my itinerary . 
  i 'm writing a bit about what i did on the blog if you 're looking for ideas . 
  i did n't take any tours since i like doing the planning myself and it was pretty easy to go around solo . 
  i do like museums though , so i did go to quite a few . 
  to the op :, 
  buying a jr pass is cheaper than if you were to pay for the shinkansen roundtrip between kyoto and tokyo , but it is definitely not the cheapest way to travel between the two places . 
  taking local trains for such a long distance is kind of a pain , but if you stop many times and places along the way ( and do the trip over a couple of days ) it is doable . 
  if you 're going to be travelling around a lot then consider a bus pass http://willerexpress.com/st/3/en/pc/buspass/ . 
  for 10,000 yen you get to choose any route ( kyoto-tokyo included ) , up to three buses a day , for three days ( do n't have to be consecutive ) . 
  that is definitely much cheaper than any shinkansen and jr pass you could find . 
  and if you take a night bus then it also means you avoid paying for accommodation and you do n't waste sightseeing time . 
  while shinkansen are cool and a nice experience in themselves , and they are much faster than buses and local trains , ask yourself if you really want to spend that kind of money on the ride first . 
  depends on how ` low-key ' you want it to be . 
  i also like to get to know places well so i 'm going to hiroshima for a week this tsuyu . 
  while most tourists go there as a day-trip , there 's really plenty to do and there are many towns within reach if you want to get out for a bit ( miyajima , iwakuni , yanai , akiota / sandankyo , kure , takehara , onomichi ... are all close by ) . 
  even okayama / kurashiki can be done as a day-trip , though personally i think it is a bit further away and needs more than one day . 
  if you prefer to just stay in the city , it does have a lot to offer ( not all is related to the bombing , although it is an opportunity to get to know the history well ) and a week there can be filled in easily if you 're going slow paced and getting to know the place . 
  check out http://gethiroshima.com/ for ideas . 
  i think places like matsue ( and izumo ) , beppu or wakayama would also make great places to stay for a longer time than just a day or two , since they have a fare share of sightseeing in and about , but also have a charm for themselves beyond tourism . 
  if you 're into smaller towns , soja is one of my favourites . 
  while in a day you 'd really get to see all it has to offer as of tourism ( and that 's kind of stretching it ) , it 's a nice little place with beautiful scenery around it . 
  a great way to seeing local life of japan is to choose a smaller town . 
  trips to kurashiki ( do n't only check out the bikan area , but also kojima area further south !, 
  ) , okayama , bitchu-takahashi , fukiya furusato , ashimori , kinojo , the kibi plain and many smaller places are also within easy reach . 
  and i also second somewhere in the izu peninsula . 
  not many people go there and you also have a gateway with ferries to the izu islands . 
  while kamakura is a popular tourist spot for day-trippers from tokyo , most stick to the daibutsu ( great buddha ) area and temples around there , and they 're gone by around 4-5pm . 
  the rest of the town is pretty free of visitors and would be a great place to stay for a few days . 
  i was in kamakura for only two days , but i would definitely go again since i felt like there was so much to see and it was so beautiful , and some of the people i met said it was their third or fourth time visiting !, 
  i 'd say stay somewhere away from hase-dera or the daibutsu to avoid the tourists every day and you 'll love it . 
  sorry , maybe i did n't explain myself properly . 
  i do n't want to only go to the castle in takahashi , but i 'd like to see the rest of the town also . 
  i will be coming from onomichi early morning and was thinking of walking up to the castle and being at the top by 9am opening time ( do n't mind waking up very early ) .
