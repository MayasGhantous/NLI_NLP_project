  i was at meiji shrine at around 10:30 am , so it was significantly more crowded than my visit to senso-ji . 
  while i did like the walk to the shrine under the trees and i was able to see a traditional wedding , the shrine itself did n't really say much to me and the people who worked there kind of had an ' urgh , another foreigner ' attitude . 
  i did n't really like it much . 
  i usually prefer shrines over temples , but in this case my vote goes for senso-ji , no doubt about it . 
  as for the rest of the neighbourhood , i think asakusa can be more interesting than harajuku-yoyogi since it 's somewhat more traditional and there are good museums in the area rather than just shopping . 
  but for access , meiji shrine would be slightly easier to reach from tokyo station since you can just get off at yoyogi station along the jr yamanote ( asakusa would require a transfer ) . 
  large does n't always mean the best though . 
  senso-ji and meiji shrine are both big and beautiful and very popular with the visitors but depending on the time you go it really just feels like you 're in a swarm of people and ca n't really enjoy it much , which is what will probably happen if you 're arriving at around 3pm . 
  if i can make suggestions , i would recommend skipping both and finding one that might be a better example of the country without being a tourist hotspot . 
  naritasan shinshoji temple is definitely one of my favourites , maybe also consider nezu shrine and tennoji temple . 
  or maybe you can go up to ueno park and visit shinobazunoike bentendo , yushima tenjin shrine , toshogu shrine , gojoten shrine , etc. 
  all really close together and see both shrines and temples . 
  ps : most stations have lockers , including asakusa station and yoyogi , so you do n't really have to go through tokyo station first . 
  there is so much to see , it really just depends on your tastes . 
  i think your day 6 is a bit over the top . 
  people who are combining miyajima and hiroshima in one day usually cut down a lot on the things to see . 
  what i mean is you 'd have to definitely take out mt.misen and probably hiroshima castle and garden . 
  maybe you want to start the day in miyajima , do mt.misen really early ( we 're talking being at the ropeway by 9am opening time ) , being back back at the bottom to visit the other miyajima sites and see high tide , then off to hiroshima for the rest of the day . 
  you could probably fit in the peace museum and park , but i do n't think the castle and garden will make it . 
  honestly i enjoyed engyoji * way * more than himeji castle . 
  i would put that as a priority for himeji if you have limited time . 
  ( many people would argue with me , but i really liked hiroshima castle much more than himeji castle too , simply because of the displays and work put into the museum , plus gokoku shrine was really nice ) . 
  well , i walked up so that took a long hour . 
  i spent about 3h walking around the temple and subtemples at the top and took a quick ropeway down . 
  you can read my trip report if you want : https://tokyoanecdote.wordpress.com/2016/07/13/a-morning-at-mt-shosha/, 
  never been there myself , but this page http://www.kanko.suzuka.mie.jp.e.oy.hp.transer.com/ if the official sightseeing guide of the city so you can probably find a few things . 
  not op , but i 've thought about this many times and not much has changed . 
  well , i 'm unemployed but i 'm a student , so i do n't think it 's the same case . 
  they also ask you how much money you 're bringing with you into the country , so they 'll see you have enough for a holiday . 
  rural jr trains can be every hour / two hours , trains on the yamanote line in tokyo every few minutes . 
  here 's the timetable for the shinkansen tokyo-kyoto if that 's what you 're looking for : http://english.jr-central.co.jp/info/timetable/_pdf/westbound.pdf, 
  i second checking hyperdia for general timetables and departure times . 
  is it worthy of a visit ? 
  yes , definitely . 
  but i would n't recommend it if you have only seven days to travel the country . 
  i 'd say spend the whole week in okinawa or do n't include it . 
  there is so much to see on the four main islands that there 's really no point in running around north to south when you have so much right in front of you . 
  hey , just curious , how did the trip go ? 
  i 'm going up there soon and will be visiting some of these places and wondering what you thought of them . 
  oh wow , i had no idea it was illegal . 
  i 've seen plenty hostels who offer that , sometimes even announcing it on their websites . 
  i stayed at khaosan tokyo ninja last year and there were people staying there working / not paying , but that hostel closed at the end of the year . 
  it was a good place though , i like the hostel chain . 
  i do n't really consider any place in particular to be an ` essential experience ' because in the end it all comes down to each person 's taste . 
  i would suggest going to hokkaido . 
  or visit some more traditional sites and temples/shrines in the city itself , but the summer nature in hokkaido * is * spectacular . 
  especially the flowering fields but since it 's not that hot in june i think hiking is also great , i personally like places like mount i\u014d and mt.tarumae but there are plenty greener places that are worth seeing . 
  going up north also gives you the chance to experience both central honshu japanese culture in the tokyo area and ainu culture in hokkaido . 
  plenty trip reports to read !, 
  i have n't been there myself so ca n't say much as of personal experience . 
  yeah , i spent four hours in okayama castle + garden and loved it . 
  they were doing a special event thing in a hall in koraku-en and i ended up playing tosen-kyo with some of the locals , it was really fun . 
  it was monday so the museums were closed but i went for a long walk around the city ( through some small streets at the other side of the station ) and had a great time spotting momotaro-related things everywhere and trying kibi dango . 
  i stayed the night in a hostel and went to the kibi plain the next day , which i also really recommend . 
  i think simply reading up a bit about the country before going would be a good idea , the more you know the better , but you do n't really have to stress about it . 
  sure japan has a very different culture and all that but it 's not a completely different world , just looking at what other people do and trying to be respectful is fine . 
  the only thing i think you should know is onsen etiquette if you 'll be visiting one and make sure you know how to eat with chopsticks . 
  thanks !, 
  i 'm going to dewa sanzan and yamadera for sure , plus other places in yamagata for the rest of the week , after that i 'll be spending a few days in miyagi but i 'm debating whether to go up to southern akita ( yukawa , yokote ) or iwate ( hiraizumi , tono ) for the spear couple of days . 
  instead of nyuto onsen i 've chosen naruko onsen though , sleeping in a ryokan in a smaller town further away because it 's cheaper and has fireflies :p, 
  it 's not my first trip to the country so i 'm not worried about language or moving around !, 
  i have one for kyoto and general kansai area , osaka included , but i have to say that it 's not my most detailed map since i 'm not really interested in either places . 
  i fixed one up and posted it long ago , opened it so everyone could edit it ( so they could add more spots ) , but i think people did n't understand that they have to copy a map before changing anything if they want to plan their own trip with it , otherwise it just changes the original . 
  in the end someone accidentally deleted the other layers when trying to make their own . 
  anyway , so i 'll leave this one at ` view only ' rather than possible editing , but look as much as you want !, 
  i have a map of the most recommended onsen in japan : https://drive.google.com/open?id=1k8lbwlhqz1kluina-hp-r4fc8b8&amp;usp=sharing includes some that are in hokkaido . 
  as for private ones , [ this page ] ( http://selected-ryokan.com/ryokan/location/hokkaido-region ) should help you . 
  also have one for hiroshima prefecture : https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=1-2ex8ejujbkjfryzzr2hh7zi4y4, 
  - ** seeing a kagura show in hiroshima and dressing up as tsuchigumo **, 
  so i went to see a traditional theatre in hiroshima and i absolutely loved it . 
  i was able to hear a taiko drum and see the actors on stage dancing gracefully . 
  i loved being with the locals watching a performance on yokai and japanese legends and then at the end tried on the costumes and talked to the actors / musicians . 
  - ** going to takasaki to see the hometown of the daruma doll , or really just seeing a daruma in person **, 
  i really loved takasaki . 
  a guy actually hopped off a bus to give me directions while the bus waited for him , such hospitality !, 
  the city really likes its daruma too , there were statues , signs , mural paintings and dolls of them everywhere . 
  - ** playing tosen-kyo ( traditional fan throwing game ) in a huge room of an old building with some locals of okayama **, 
  i was visiting korakuen garden and they had one of the halls at the entrance open to the public ( not usually open ) , as i started to look around a sliding door opened and a man stepped out of a room . 
  he stopped when he saw me and waved me over , telling me to come inside . 
  i found myself in a big and beautiful tatami room with about twenty people all sitting in seiza , none of which spoke english , and half of them wearing kimono . 
  i had a moment of panic when i realised my manners might not reach the required level of formality that would be expected in such a situation ( and i did n't really know what was going on either ) , but i ended up joining them and playing the game . 
  they gave me a few trial runs to get used to it first , i admit i was ridiculously bad at the start , that is , until the man showed me a different way to hold the fan that was also valid , from which point i sent the fan flying straight into the figurine and successfully knocked it over , earning a chorus of ` ehhhhhh ' from everyone watching . 
  the real match begun . 
  before we started the competitive fan-tossing we first had to bow to each other , i did my best to imitate all the historical manga i 'd read and did n't feel too embarrassed about my lack of bowing experience since most were busy with their own bowing . 
  i had about six turns in total , managing to land the fan and figurine in great positions that earned me many points every time . 
  i ended up winning 24 to 6 and the judges and the man were impressed by my ability of fan-tossing . 
  i 'm sure they 'll have high expectations for the next spanish person showing up there . 
  - ** eating a mochi from a leaf **, 
  i love mochis , it was really nice . 
  - ** just the people in general **, 
  i have lots of fun stories and nice memories about talking to the people there . 
  shoutout to the wonderful man at mt.shosha who offered to drive me back to himeji station , as well as the awesome boatman in kurashiki that made the tour down the river one of the best memories of my trips . 
  the miko of a shrine in hiroshima that gave me a map and took care of my goshuin with one of the brightest smiles i 've ever seen , the foreigner in the kamakura guest house that was cycling japan , the staff of the hostels , the lady that saw a tourist in the middle of nowhere and ran out of her restaurant waving to come and talk to me , the group of women who gave me sweets and wanted to hear all about my trip , the worker at the konbini who started bowing and apologising because he did n't know the stamp price from japan-spain ( wow , i felt so guilty for asking him and making him nervous , he looked so apologetic and it really wa n't his fault !, 
  ) , etc. 
  japanican , rakuten , japanese guest houses , hostelworld , hostelz , booking , japan hotel network , japan traveler online , agoda , lonelyplanet , expedia , travelocity , etc. 
  are some sites that people use to look for places to sleep . 
  personally i like to look for different places on these sites and then book directly through the hostel 's personal website . 
  yeah , it 's great , i use it a lot ( and write reviews ) since it also shows ruins sites that are n't usually mentioned . 
  i too had a similar mindset on my first trip and i spent both weeks in tokyo because i did n't want to have to deal with figuring out long distance travel ( it seemed complicated , and i was 19 , first solo trip and all that ) . 
  on my second trip i did a bit more research and it was very easy to work out , so do n't let the daunty-ness stop you .
