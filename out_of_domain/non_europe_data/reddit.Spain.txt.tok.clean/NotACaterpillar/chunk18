  name the first ten movies that come to mind . 
  now count how many white people appear in those movies as opposed to black and asian people . 
   i do n't see a way to fix this without making the problem exponentially worse . 
  the solution for under representation in media is , well , representing said people in the media . 
  i do n't see why that 's a bad thing ? 
   as for ghost in shell , in seems that only asian-americans are offended . 
  as a spanish person i am concerned about bull fighting . 
  since this does n't affect other people , say from the us , they do n't put the thought into discussing this topic or worrying about it . 
  it has no relevance to their lives and identities . 
  that does n't mean that this problem is less important simply because ` it only concerns/offends spanish people ' , it should be treated with respect because it * is * an issue that exists and people ( or more importantly in this case , bulls ) are getting hurt by it . 
  it does n't matter * who * is getting offended , the problem is that some people * are * getting offended . 
   why does the race even matter ? 
  the media helps to shape who and what we see as important , as well as outlining the range of visible options for what is collectively seen as possible ( sometimes even ` acceptable ' ) . 
  there are n't hardly enough autistic girls in movies , indian characters who are n't stereotypes , people in wheelchairs , etc. 
  if you happen to be one of those people in real life , who are you going to identify with ? 
  how * do * you dream from scratch , with no role models to be found ? 
  if you ca n't see yourself reflected out there , how do you believe you belong ? 
  there are n't enough roles played by asian actors , so not only does it not make sense to star a white actor for a chinese role , but it is n't really fair either . 
  they deserve to see themselves in movies as often as a white person appears on screen . 
   just because groups of guys do does n't mean the next guy will . 
  you are right . 
  ` not all men ' is true , not all men are rapists and murderers ... it simply is n't a reason to feel safe around * all * men . 
  ** not all are bad , but some of them are , and that is enough to cause a threat . 
  women know that not all men are going to kill them or rape them . 
  most have fathers and brothers and cousins and friends who are male and have proven to be no threat . 
  i do n't cross the road when i walk by a man . 
  but if i see someone who looks dangerous , then yeah , maybe , ** i 'm not going to put my safety on the line just so someone 's feeling are n't hurt ** . 
  i do n't think it is entirely wrong to think that people are murderers or rapists even if i have n't met them . 
  i wo n't accuse them , obviously ( if i have no proof ) but if my gut is telling me that someone is dangerous , i 'm not going to take any chances . 
  i do n't think all , or even most , men are murderers or rapists . 
  i have n't met anyone who i think is one . 
  but some are . 
   do you not think it 's wrong that your husband or son or best friend will always be assumed as a potential rapist just because they are male . 
  i think it 's a pity that we live in a world where such a threat exists , a world where people * are * getting raped by husbands and sons and friends . 
  i know my dad would never do such a thing , but i would never blame another woman for staying safe around him , especially if they have had previous bad experiences with rape , because ** fear is not their fault ** . 
  they have a right to their feelings and a right to want to feel safe . 
  why do n't you look at it the other way around ? 
  as a woman , i am always going to be seen as a potential victim of rape . 
  there is going to be someone who is going to look at me and think * i want that * and there may be someone who will do morally questionable things in order to get what they want from me . 
  i ca n't escape that , but the least i can do as a woman is try to stay safe when i think someone is dangerous . 
  it depends . 
  do you feel threatened by such a possibility ? 
  if the answer is no , i do n't know why you 're asking this question . 
  the percentage of male rapists who hurt women is higher than that of dangerous , crazy women that can hurt you . 
  84767 people were raped in 2010 in the us alone ( many cases are n't even reported ) , i think we can both agree that most of the rapists are men . 
  the percentage of female murderers is also significantly lower than the percentage of male murderers ( 2008 , 1.6 women committed a homicide out of 100,000 people . 
  in comparison , 11.3 men / 100,000 ) . 
  i 'm not scared of being murdered , i 'm concerned about being raped . 
   you already spent almost a whole post talking about how statistics do n't matter, 
  when did i say that ? 
  this is my first post . 
  either way , the probablility is high enough for it to be a threat , and as such i ca n't blame anyone for trying to stay safe . 
  if for them that means crossing the road , so be it . 
  there are people who feel like both genders , as well as ` none of the above ' , but there are also plenty who feel like both man/woman , changing depending on the day , a strange mix of none and both ... whether you think they exist or not is n't up to you , because others * do * feel this way . 
  these labels are n't relevant to you as you clearly identify as a man/woman . 
  they do n't have any impact on you and so i do n't understand why you are feeling annoyed that other people identify with whatever they do . 
  i have never ever started a conversation that way and i really doubt most people have , most non-binaries included . 
  if that sentence is all it takes for you to stop respecting someone , are you sure you really respect them to begin with ? 
  i agree religion has done plenty of harm , i do n't think the concept of religion is harmful in itself . 
  when i was a kid my sister used to watch * dawson 's creek * . 
  i did n't like the show much but there was one quote they said that has stayed with me forever , `` one moment of happiness is worth all the bad ones '' . 
  while that can depend a lot on the situation , of course , i think religion has also done a lot of good and given hope to many people . 
  i think that this should also have a great impact on one 's opinion of religion . 
  considering it 's impossible to lay out every experience and consequence in a line and count the bad vs good ones , i do n't see how this can really be proven . 
  that is the difference between sex ( what ) and gender ( who , the identity ) , which is what i 'm saying in the post . 
  it 's what trans people are saying when they identify as a gender different to their sex . 
  why do you say that trans people latch on to cultural norms to form their identity ? 
  do * you * do that ? 
  why would they form their identity around something like that if you and other cisgender people do n't ? 
  their way of understanding and building an identity is n't based on norms * simply because they are trans * , they are capable of understanding ** who ** they are regardless of that . 
  * some * trans people do that , definitely not all . 
  there are so so many `` tomboy '' trans-women out there . 
  as i said before , gender expression ( their hair , make-up , clothes ) is n't related to how they identify . 
  i could wear a dress and still be a guy , i could have long hair and still be a guy . 
  i do n't feel like a girl if i do those things because i 'm * not * a girl . 
  if you ask a woman why they are a woman , they are n't going to say `` because i wear woman 's clothing '' . 
  a trans woman is n't going to identify as a woman simply because they wear dresses . 
  it 's deeper than that . 
  if you are saying that trans women base their identities on this , the same would apply to cis women because they also wear make-up , have long hair , etc. 
  and therefore base their appearance to fit the cultural understanding of what a woman is . 
  which , ultimately , leads me to say : they are n't doing it because it is the cultural norm , they are doing it because they want to . 
  i understand what you are trying to say and it seems logical enough , however i do n't think we can agree on what omniscience is or is not without first agreeing on the concept of time and existence themselves . 
  if i understand correctly , the definition you are giving to ` existence ' would be anything that * has had * or * has * a presence/manifestation ( whether it be physical like an object or simply in thought ) in this world , i.e. 
  in some point in a linear time it has been present . 
  what belongs to the future can not ( yet ) exist because it has never been present , and thus is simply a thought/concept until the present moves forward to said future . 
  for me , present is the only thing that exists , let 's say , in practise ( meaning , we can only feel and think in the present ) ; both the past and the future are the same in that they are simply mental states ( either we remember or we imagine , but both are equally non-present ) . 
  we can only be aware in the now and so the past/future are simply concepts . 
  i 'm not talking about ` proof ' that something existed . 
  what existed in the past does not necessarily exist now , but i am not negating that something could have existed in the past when the past was present , it simply does n't exist * anymore * . 
  the * concept * of it still exists , maybe documents , diaries , photos too , but it and of itself is n't in the present anymore . 
  people remembering things , people 's thoughts and actions ( what is happening in the now ) , documentaries that exist , knowing the meaning of historic documents that exist in the present , etc. 
  are all part of the present constructing an image of the past , but the past no longer exists as of now . 
  for example , world war ii does not exist , it has existed . 
  but the understanding and the evidence of it having existed do exist in the present . 
  omniscience is the capacity to know everything that there is to know . 
  it can mean knowing everything that exists ( for me the present , for you the present and the past ) . 
  since , for me , the past and the future are both the same as they are only mental , the omniscient would know the future and the past in an equal degree . 
  that is n't to say there is only one future ( the concept of destiny and a decided future is a whole different topic ) but anything that exists in concept/mind/thought of the future is known as well as every concept/mind/thought of the past . 
  the ` correct past ' only is known as such because we have evidence of it in the present , but for an omniscient person/god/whatever , the different concepts/thoughts of the past are all equal . 
  but ` knowing everything that there is to know ' can also mean knowing everything that * does not * exist .
