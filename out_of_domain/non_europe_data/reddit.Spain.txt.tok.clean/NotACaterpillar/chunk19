  and as such , all thoughts and memories of all the pasts and all the futures are known as well as all the actions and events that have happened and will happen . 
  especially when i have to call someone on the phone . 
  sometimes i 'll write down what i have to say and good sentences to include that will make me sound less awkward . 
  yeah , i had n't even heard of some of those companies . 
  i wish i could explain why i chose each answer in many of these cases ... 
  in the question ` when buying a cereal , what do you look for the most ? ' there were numbers from 1-5 . 
  i considered 1 the lowest and 5 the highest , but i was thinking about doing it the other way around ( 1 being the first option/what i look for first ) . 
  it may be good to clarify that . 
  i had no idea paper towel dispensers were a thing that existed . 
  you do realise that not everybody lives in the same country as you right ? 
  some of the things you may consider normal are n't that normal for others . 
  paper towel dispensers are n't a thing here in spain , automatic soap dispensers are n't too common either ( i 've mostly only seen them in airports and abroad ) . 
  yeah . 
  also tornadoes are n't really part of my life at all , so i have no idea what to do in case one happens . 
  the likelihood of one happening where i live is very low and the chances of me even seeing it are even lower . 
  same as when i lived in nz i learnt what to do in case of an earthquake , here in spain nobody cares . 
  i think that the country where one lives should be taken into account when taking the survey . 
  for a survey that is open to everyone and has a focus on trans people , i feel like the question about one 's sex did n't really make much sense . 
  or maybe have one for sex and then another for gender . 
  i 'm agender and i do n't really identify as trans , but i have in the past and am close to the community , as a non-binary i do n't consider myself cis either . 
  i 've been twice to japan and explaining it all would be very long , so i 'll just mention some of my favourite places :, 
  i read that it was a ` good day trip from tokyo ' and i wanted to see the hometown of the daruma doll , so i added it to my list while i was there . 
  it was a bit hard to find information about the city and how to get around , so i did n't really know what to expect ( the information is n't hard to find if you know how to look , but it was my first trip ever and my planning skills could be improved ) . 
  apparently it 's only a ` good day trip from tokyo ' if you have a jr pass , because i spent 4h that day on the local train there and back . 
  so i showed up at takasaki station with little more knowledge than * there is a temple called shorinzan daruma-ji that is cool and you need to take a bus to get there . 
  also a big statue . 
  * as you can imagine , that did n't help much . 
  the information center was n't yet open because i had woken up early , so after trying all the station exits i finally found the bus stop area . 
  i was totally lost and i asked a man for help on getting to the temple , as he was talking to me his bus arrived and it waited for him to finish helping me out before leaving . 
  at least now i knew which bus to take and shortly after a woman sat down next to me , excited to see a foreigner in her city , and started talking to me the whole bus trip in japanese . 
  of course i did n't understand much ( anything ) but it was nice nonetheless . 
  anyway , so the temple turned out to be amazing , one of my favourites i 've been to in japan , the garden was really nice and another group of old ladies gave me lollies . 
  a woman from a small restaurant saw me and ran up to me with an english pamphlet . 
  people in takasaki were so nice !, 
  there are few buses so when i bought my daruma at the temple counter the man there gave me a map to a nearby station . 
  i got lost anyway , i ended up walking to the station with a girl ( she had my same name ! ), 
  and the train was very old . 
  the doors would n't close properly ( they were manual doors rather than automatic ) and it kept doing very strange squeaking noises . 
  anyway , it still was n't even noon yet as i arrived back to takasaki station so i had plenty time ahead of me . 
  the information center was now open and finding the next bus was much easier . 
  the ` big statue ' was indeed very big , kannon standing high above the trees in the middle of a mountain . 
  i hopped off when it looked like i was close enough and walked there through a small shopping street with a few souvenirs and old houses . 
  i could go inside and climb the stairs to the top inside the statue , with great views of the city and mountains around . 
  i also bought there my first omamori lucky charm which was great . 
  there was a big sign with a map and it looked like there were some caves further down the road , so i walked for around 20min until i found them . 
  they were also really great and there was a japanese garden next to them with a statue of urashima tarou . 
  definitely one of the best days of the trip and overall maybe my favourite city in japan . 
  - ** edo-tokyo open air museum ** : really great museum , free guides who were really nice , beautiful houses and buildings ... i spent the whole day there . 
  - ** [ mt.shosha ] ( https://tokyoanecdote.wordpress.com/2016/07/13/a-morning-at-mt-shosha/ ) ** and ** [ kurashiki ] ( https://tokyoanecdote.wordpress.com/2016/07/25/boat-ride-down-kurashikis-canal/ ) ** are both also in my ` top 10 ' list , but i 've written about them over on my blog so it would be easier to just link to the trip reports rather than talk about them here . 
  - ** okayama ** : the city felt really green and fresh compared to others i 'd been visiting the previous days ( it was summer , * fresh * is definitely a bonus ) . 
  the people were nice , the castle and gardens were both lovely and the backstreets were very scenic . 
  i ended up playing tosen-kyo ( traditional fan-throwing game ) with some of the locals in a big tatami room which was really fun . 
  - ** hiroshima ** : i spent three full days in the city but slept there 6 nights as i visited some other places nearby , so it really felt like i got to know the city a tiny bit better than the casual tourist . 
  if we 're talking about the peace sites i definitely recommend the * fukuro-machi elementary school * . 
  there are many peace sites in hiroshima beyond the park and peace museum , fukuro-machi was definitely the place that made me cry the most ( look at the video downstairs ) . 
  apart from that , i really liked doing the futabanosato historical walking trail and kagura show . 
  you can read about that trip report [ here ] ( https://tokyoanecdote.wordpress.com/2016/08/13/a-different-side-of-hiroshima/ ) . 
  - ** ako ** : nice small city , i was there to see where the 47 ronin come from . 
  just generally charming and like takasaki the people made an effort to make me feel very welcome as the only foreigner there ( i received the only english pamphlet ) . 
  the guide at the castle ruins did n't speak english but he showed me a few images and pointed out a few things anyway , with my broken japanese i understood a few things . 
  the sites were also very interesting too , the castle ruins were some of the best ruins i 've been to , i spent at least an hour at the small museum and the shrine statue were really cool . 
  well , i think i can comment on the `` [ too much planning ] ( http://imgur.com/a/1xoen ) '' side of things . 
  for me planning is just as fun as the trip itself , so i put a lot of effort into it . 
  while i think that everyone 's definition of over-planning is different , i can agree on the not planning minute-by-minute or hourly itineraries . 
  if one thing fails , the whole thing collapses . 
  travel time , a museum or shrine being much more interesting and worth more time than you were expecting , you planned a trip to a mountain but do n't feel like walking because your legs are tired , whatever , anything can interfere with the itinerary . 
  instead , if you have limited time in one place start with your must-sees and visit other sites if you have time , or as i prefer , simply spend an extra day in the area to include anything you missed on the previous days ( and know what else there is to do if you did manage to fit it all in ) . 
  edit : and i agree , please look at a map . 
  if it 's your first trip to japan , chances are you 'll be visiting bigger shrines that all offer goshuin . 
  i do n't know of any sites that list all the shrines that offer them ( considering there are nearly 1800 in kyoto prefecture alone , that would be a * very * long list ) but i do follow some blogs that post some interesting goshuin from different shrines and temples ( [ like this one ] ( http://www.gosyuinn.com/ ) ) . 
  i think we can simply say that if there is someone working there , they 'll probably offer goshuin . 
  i have been to un-manned shrines that do n't , but for obvious reasons ( there is nobody there to give it to you ) . 
  you 'll find plenty that do so there is no need to worry about it . 
   i once went to a shrine in kanazawa that required me to ring a doorbell at the shrine 's office and ask the little old lady that answered for a goshuin . 
  the same happened to me in onomichi , but other people were leaving as i arrived so it did n't feel too strange . 
  my most memorable goshuin was at mitakidera of hiroshima . 
  the office was a really tiny building , more like a hut , and there were piles of papers and books stacked to the ceiling , the only hole being the window for me to see inside and a small door at the other side . 
  the old lady saw me arrive with my shuincho and rushed inside the little hut , sitting down in from of the window . 
  it seemed like she was in a nest of papers with only room for her to fit . 
  also adding :, 
  - kurayoshi : shirakabe warehouses . 
  possibly hokkuei if you like detective conan . 
  - yonago / sakaiminato : especially if you 're into yokai . 
  there 's also miho shrine and kiyomizu-dera temple ( in yasugi , not kyoto ) which are both really nice . 
  - matsue : city between yonago and izumo , great castle and adachi museum of art , between many other things . 
  - tsuwano , akiyoshidai and hagi are all really worth a visit . 
  i 've read about tsunoshima ohashi ( \u89d2\u5cf6\u5927\u6a4b ) but do n't know much about it . 
  - and while you 're at eihei-ji , which i definitely recommend , maybe check out ichij\u014ddani asakura family historic ruins , maruoka castle and echizen \u014cno castle . 
   amanohashidate - one of the three views of japan ( but the most boring of the three imo ), 
  no way , amanohashidate is my favourite of the three !, 
  :d i guess you should include chion-ji , motoise kono jinja , nariaiji temple , kyu mikamiye residence , maizuru castle , matsunoodera temple , kongoin , etc. 
  which are all in the same town . 
  it just felt like the least touristy of the three . 
  can i add some sites to the places you mentioned ? 
  - so urashima tarou is said to be from ine ( ine no funaya ) and there 's a shrine called urashima shrine nearby . 
  that area is a bit hard to get around without a car though , there are n't many buses . 
  - izumo : benten island ( \u5f01\u5929\u5cf6 ) is where the kami descend before going to izumo taisha , i recommend you sleep in the city and look at the sunset behind the rock , it 's really nice . 
  the shimane museum of ancient izumo next to izumo taisha , the former taisha station and the izumo cultural tradition hall too . 
  if you 're really going out of the way , gakuen-ji temple and ichibata-ji are also nice . 
  you have some pretty interesting ones !,
