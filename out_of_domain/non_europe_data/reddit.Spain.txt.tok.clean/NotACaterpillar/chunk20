  do you remember the names of them ? 
  the easy way to know the difference is by looking at the name . 
  temples usually end in * - ji * ( kosan-ji ) , * - dera * ( kiyomizu-dera ) or * - in * ( daisho-in ) . 
  shrines are followed by many terms like saruka ** jinja ** , usa ** jingu ** , izumo ** taisha ** , fukuyama ** hachimangu ** , dazaifu ** tenmangu ** between others . 
  once you 've seen a few in person you 'll start to see the more physical differences . 
  if you buy the [ bus pass ] ( http://willerexpress.com/st/3/en/pc/buspass/ ) from willer express and use night buses you wo n't have to pay for accommodation either , that 's * way * cheaper than a shinkansen . 
  i really love nagoya . 
  i think that it 's an especially good base for history and castle fans wanting to see all the castles nearby ( nagoya , inuyama , sunomata , hikone , nagahama , kiyosu , etc. ), 
  plus the sekigahara battlefield and tokugawa museum . 
  atsuta jingu is also one of my favourite shrines . 
  aichi has inuyama , toyokawa and toyohashi and a couple of interesting islands in ise bay . 
  it has a good mix of city and nature too , with autumn spots ( obara ) , fireflies , rice fields and the like . 
  i think that the area has a lot more to offer than everyone is letting on . 
  the linimo is also cool for train geeks . 
  and toyota factory tours . 
  also have in mind the usa 's morning is europe 's afternoon , so many people from either places can read it ( 9am us = 2pm uk ) . 
  if you post it in usa 's evening , that means that people in europe wo n't read it until the next day ( 7pm us = 12am uk ) , so mornings will usually get more views . 
  poor guys . 
  first 2011 now this ? 
  i hope everyone 's okay . 
  can someone translate the names of these places ? 
  thanks !, 
  the cooling system was stopped automatically , no risk to the powerplant . 
  thank god . 
  my parents are really close to hastings . 
  btw , i do n't think the question about sex should include the trans options . 
  it just seems like you 're saying they 're less of a man/woman by including them separately . 
  ` sex ' is a word usually used when talking about someone 's biological sex ( male/female/intersex ) , while ` gender ' is used when talking about someone 's perception of themselves , who they are mentally . 
  the word transgendered does n't exist either , it 's transgender . 
   american school days begin with pledging allegiance to the flag, 
  wait , what ? 
  seriously ? 
  when someone says ` red , white and blue flag ' i think uk , not us . 
  what one considers ` middle school ' can change depending on the country each person is from . 
  here in spain we have kindergarten and ` school ' ( with grades p-1 , p-2 and p-3 then 1 through 6 ) up to 12 years old and then ` high school ' ( grades 1-4 ) from 12-16 . 
  that 's the end of compulsory schooling , some go on to do * batxillerat * ( 17-18 ) or * m\u00f2duls * ( any age ) before going on to university ( 18 + ) . 
  so maybe you should ask the age of the child rather than the grade . 
  i wish i could give an explanation to some of my answers . 
  like :, 
  - `` it is acceptable to engage in more than one marital relationship '' . 
  i mean , it 's fine if the people involved are okay with it , if they are n't then it 's just cheating . 
  question should be more specific . 
  - `` i would always tell my partner if something bothers me about him or her . '' i would obviously talk about it if it 's something important ( meaning , it 's getting in the way of me wanting to be around them ) , but having someone tell you * everything * you do that bothers them is * very * annoying . 
  small things can be left unsaid , no matter how bothersome they are . 
  - `` usually it does not take much time for me to build trust in my partner . '' well , it 's not really partner-specific . 
  it 's hard for me to trust anyone . 
  i would n't date someone i do n't trust . 
  sure , the examples you gave could need to know the sex of the person taking the survey , but this particular survey is about reddit users , not mental illness or anything that hormone levels would have much ( if any ) impact on . 
  it makes no sense to put the options ` man ' then ` trans man ' , because a trans man * is * a man . 
  in any case it should say ` cis man ' and ` trans man ' , because those are mutually exclusive . 
  making a trans person have to say they are something other than a ( normal ) man/woman is frustrating for them . 
  i 'm not saying exclude the notion that trans people exist altogether in any survey ever , it simply does n't make sense for this survey . 
  it felt like the person who created it was trying to be inclusive by adding the ` other ' options more than anything else , so i mentioned how to do this in a way so trans people would n't feel uncomfortable with the question . 
  great , but i repeat , there should n't be the options ` man ' vs ` trans man ' , because a trans * man * is a * man * . 
  it should say ` cis man ' and ` trans man ' , because those are mutually exclusive . 
  - you can use the jr pass on the tokyo monorail from haneda airport , it is closer to tokyo than narita . 
  - look up miyajima next to hiroshima . 
  definitely a favourite of many . 
  - you can visit minoo park the morning of one of your osaka days and spend the rest of that day in kobe . 
  - as for tokyo , i would do asakusa + odaiba one day ( there are boats going from asakusa to odaiba ) , shibuya/harajuku are right next to each other + shinjuku on a second day . 
  - taxis are * very * expensive . 
  there was no space to write my opinion so i 'll write it here . 
  honestly , the jakarta ads shown seem a bit boring . 
  meaning , they show nothing that i could n't see back home ( a building , shopping ) . 
  i would n't go all the way to bali to see that , away from home i 'm more interested in the different culture and history of each place rather than doing something i can do here in spain . 
  the ads show nothing really * unique * about that place . 
  i do n't even know what the spanish anthem sounds like . 
  thank god we do n't pledge to the flag or anything here ( actually , i think that would n't be the best idea here in catalonia ) , that really sounds like the antecedent of some future nazi-level nationalistic wave . 
  ** edit ** : just looked up the spanish anthem , can confirm i have never heard it before . 
  i 'm from spain . 
  i do n't usually remember what the us flag even looks like , if i 'm shown a picture i 'd know where it 's from but if someone told me to draw it , i would n't be able to . 
  i think op sees the us flag much more often that non-us people do and so has a bit of a biased opinion .

  i do n't really believe in the concept of ` must-see ' since what places are worthwhile depend on every traveller 's tastes . 
  tohoku and shikoku are both great options to get a bit off the more touristy route since most people stay closer to tokyo-kyoto-hiroshima . 
  touring tohoku can easily fill in more that 5 days but that is enough time to catch a few interesting places . 
  on my first trip to tokyo ( 2 weeks long ) i only used the toei subway * once * ( from asakusabashi to asakusa ) . 
  i 'm not saying it is n't important to move around tokyo , it is especially if you 're visiting less-typical places or live there , but first time visitors will mostly be using the yamanote line . 
  i did n't even know the subway existed and it was fine . 
  all lines wo n't be mentioned in the video and for someone who knows absolutely nothing about japan transportation , giving too much information will just confuse them . 
  the jr pass comment though ... 
  i think it will just make people think buying a jr pass for tokyo is a good idea . 
  being proud does n't mean they think they 're the best . 
  i 'm proud to be spanish ( or catalan , really ) but i do n't think spain is better than other countries . 
  i clicked and opened in a new tab before reading the second line . 
  patriotism is just an emotional attachment to a place which one sees as their home , mostly by feeling proud of being from that particular country . 
  nationalism is extreme patriotism and a feeling of superiority over other countries , thinking about your country ( and usually people from that country ) as ` the best ' . 
  the us is the center of their own world . 
  americans do n't really look or see much of foreign cultures / attitudes / countries in their media . 
  they make movies and series about themselves and watch those shows about themselves , they talk about themselves on the news , rather than watching international news or series and movies from other countries . 
  they are big , and strong , and create their own reality . 
  and think that everyone else in the world and other countries watch and think the same things , not fully understanding that the us is n't the center of everyone else 's worlds . 
  it 's easy to blame other countries for the wrong things they do , because all countries do and have done bad things . 
  but when you think you are the center of the world , and start pointing fingers at others , it 's easy to go from ` i like being from america ' to ` america is the best and everyone wants to ( or should want to ) be american ' . 
  i prefer to be latin america than bull fighting , at least . 
  you show two photos at the top of the page ( the cardigan and black dress ) , and again below the same cardigan and a black dress . 
  the thing is , i 'm sure you 're looking to see which people choose the black dress in the first and then switch to the cardigan in the second case because of the model wearing the dress .
