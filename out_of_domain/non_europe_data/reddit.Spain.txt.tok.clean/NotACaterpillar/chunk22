  for example , i can easily buy a notebook at the 100 yen store , but if i 'm buying one from animate it 's going to be closer to 800 yen simply because of the characters of the cover . 
  not necessarily ` expensive ' for everyone , but it adds up quickly . 
  mandarake is a great second hand store in akihabara though , lots of cheap cool stuff there . 
  also try to look out for figurines that do n't have boxes , lots of japanese people collect the figures + box so the solo ones tend to be cheaper . 
  the problem is , the girls are n't a ` thing ' of the boys ' surroundings to be remedied or controlled . 
  they themselves have lives and should n't have to control or limit their decisions based on what the guys say simply because they have been deemed desirable . 
  i 'm not saying guys are n't going to get turned on by girls , many of them will be ( i 've been to high school ) , but it should n't be the girls ' problem to deal with . 
  by imposing a dress code , a problem that should belong to the boys is turned into a problem for the girls . 
  say , what colour is your hair ? 
  if the blondies * might * get turned on by seeing black hair , and so everyone with black hair was forced to cover it up ( wearing scarves around their heads , a big hat all day long , shaving their hair , dyeing their hair !, 
  ) ... would you think that 's fair ? 
  you ca n't impose a rule onto a big size of the population just because of somebody 's infatuations . 
  they should n't have to suffer the consequences of the boys ' ( * hypothetical future * ) desires . 
  it 's the boys who have this problem and they should learn to deal with it without feeling a need to make everyone else around them change for their own benefit . 
  girls do n't ` control ' their menstruation , they just learn to deal with it , with many blood stains , pains and embarrassing stories along the way . 
  and whether it 's harder to have the menstruation or a boner ca n't really be decided by us because we have n't tried them both and lived the two sides of the story . 
  i definitely think that having menstruation and having to go to the bathroom seven times a day , taking a pad with you everywhere without it being seen , the sometimes very intense and painful belly/back pains , the very uncomfortable pe classes , standing up in class only to realise you have a big stain , the stupid `` are you on your period ? '' jokes and comments , etc. 
  are much harder to live with than awkward boners . 
  ( and yes , i 'm a guy . ), 
  do you think a boy should have to pay the consequences of a girl 's menstruation ? 
  you say that this would only happen in high schools and since they are still young it 's okay to ignore their right of choosing what to wear ( because of boys !, 
  ) , but you ignore that at this age the girls are learning how to see themselves and it 's then that they form expectations of how they should be treated for the rest of their lives . 
  if you show them that they have to change to fit a boy 's desires ( and that that 's the `` right '' thing to do ) , there 's nothing stopping similar things to happen later in their lives . 
  it 's not just about not wearing leggings , it 's about telling a girl she has to be good for the guy , put him before her , do what she can to please him even if she has to make a few sacrifices . 
  and last but not least , by imposing a dress code so that the boys can ` concentrate on school ' or ` focus on their grades ' rather than a girl 's low shirt , we 're kind of taking away a girl 's concentration on school . 
  if she 's said to be wearing something that does n't abide to the rules she 'll be sent to the principal 's office , sometimes even sent home , and then * she 'll * be missing the whole day of school . 
  missing a full day of classes will take away much more time than the awkward boner would 've . 
  if she does n't get sent home but she gets a note or some form of punishment , her and her grades are suffering instead . 
  edit : so yeah , ! disagreewithop, 
  i liked that i could write about my own experiences and talk about my own story . 
  most people talking about eating disorders just assume they know your reasons and thoughts as soon as you say you have anorexia , so i often just feel ignored or like a statistic when taking other surveys about these issues . 
  thanks !, 
  maybe we should be able to say which languages we already speak . 
  i already speak english , spanish , catalan , enough french to get by and i 've started japanese , so obviously i would n't check any of those . 
  i checked german but i 'd go for mauri next . 
  ** winter **, 
  - positives : you can enjoy the snow in areas further north and the onsen feel especially good . 
  start of the year and end of year have lots of festivals and celebrations everywhere as well as the snow-related festivals that are amazing . 
  also some hostels have * kotatsu * . 
  did i mention snow ? 
  snow is awesome . 
  - negative things : it 's very cold , the days are much shorter and it gets dark very early . 
  the first and last days of the year will be full of people . 
  ** spring **, 
  - positive things : cherry trees and other flowers are what everyone first mentions about spring because of their beauty , it 's a good time to enjoy hanami and try sweets with sakura flavour . 
  - negative things : there are lots of people and there will be queues to enter just about every popular place . 
  i flat out refuse to go to kyoto at this time of the year , but if you 're brave enough to face the crowds then go at it . 
  the grass is sometimes yellow . 
  ** summer **, 
  - positive things : the sound of * furin * , sunflowers , ice cream , fireflies during early summer , * chinowa * rings at shrines , rice fields full of water and life , you wo n't have to carry many clothes in the suitcase so luggage will be a lot lighter . 
  everything is very green and mount fuji can be climbed from the beginning of july !, 
  also august festivals !, 
  - negative things : in july and august it is very hot ( * very * hot ) , it is very humid and you sweat a lot , early in the summer some toilets still have the heated bidet seats turned on and can be a bit uncomfortable . 
  also hornets and bugs ( not really in cities though ) . 
  if you travel in august book the hotels early because they are summer holidays and there will be lots of people . 
  ** autumn **, 
  - positive things : the colours of the leaves are really beautiful , generally there is little tourism . 
  also the time of the year for * tsukimi * ( moon-viewing ) and you get to try tsukimi dango . 
  - negative things : september is the month with the most rain in tokyo ( i mean , i like rain but i guess most people do n't ) and september is typhoon month in the islands of okinawa , kyushu and shikoku . 
  my favourite seasons to visit are , in this order : rainy season , winter , autumn , spring , summer . 
  summer is last only because of the heat , i always try to go during rainy season at the end of june because i love rain and hardly get to see it here in spain . 
  it 's also not yet hot but still has many benefits of summer ( plus hydrangeas and iris ) . 
  i was mostly talking about the snowy areas since i mentioned that , but yeah , kyoto obviously is n't as cold as hokkaido . 
  living in spain i 'm definitely not used to the cold , honestly anything under 15\u00bac is bad , at 5\u00bac and under i might as well think i 'm going to freeze . 
  hokkaido apparently has an average in negative numbers during winter ... 
  depends on the situation . 
  i did n't get anything because i do n't do christmas , i 'm not sad about it . 
  there 's lots to do in nagoya , a visit to the city can easily fill up two days or more . 
  but i agree with just choosing one , especially since you 'll spend more time on transport than actually doing anything otherwise . 
  depends how `` important '' a sight has to be for you to want to visit it , i guess . 
  apart from the already mentioned magome and tsumago , there are plenty more post towns that used to belong to the nakasendo route . 
  another good one would be narai but i also really like okute-juku . 
  other sites include the naegi and iwamura castle ruins if you 're a history/castle fan , the hiroshige museum of art in ena and eih\u014d-ji in tajimi . 
  i do n't think i 've ever seen anything that i 'd consider strange or weird in japan . 
  okay , yeah , once i saw this really long thin worm/snake , it was beige colour , and it had like a double-ending head that it kept moving around sideways . 
  i still do n't really know what it was , as you can see descriptions are n't my forte and i have n't been able to find anything resembling it . 
  anyway . 
  i think the closest thing to strange would be when i was at the edo-tokyo open air museum near tokyo . 
  i was walking around and the area was very nice and quiet ( only the crows and i ) , then i heard this clapping sound behind me , nobody was there . 
  it was probably someone around the corner since it * was * in the middle of an open air museum , but it reminded me a lot of the sound of tengu . 
  as of ` unique ' :, 
  - kinko inari shrine , a small site behind hiroshima 's toshogu-jinja , here starts a path heading to the peace pagoda at the top of the mountain . 
  the start has many very short torii so i had to duck my head while walking under them . 
  it was raining so the whole place was fog , and small fox figurines and little shrines next to the steps appeared at every corner ( the steps did a zig-zag path ) . 
  the light hardly reached the ground through the trees and it felt like i was walking into a realm of unknown spirits as the path only got darker , as if the foxes eyes were following me as i continued . 
  as you can see , i 'm fond of my yokai stories . 
  i got lost , by the way , walking around a muddy mountain with no proper signs may not have been the brightest idea of the day . 
  - at miraikan in tokyo there 's a permanent exhibition called songs of anagura , and in there there 's this little screen with a giant eye . 
  i really loved that and its little voice , as well as the ` tearoom of zero/one ' ( the robot in the white room ) . 
  - sasuke inari shrine in kamakura , as well as the lights in the tunnel entrance of zeniarai benten full of senjafuda . 
  ah , it was !, 
  thanks , i did n't think i 'd ever find out !, 
  i 'll be going there this june !, 
  do you have any other photos from your trip ? 
  it almost looks like paper !, 
  the reason why bitchu-matsuyama only has a 2 level main keep is because being on top of the mountain there was no need to build a higher one , it already served as a good vantage point . 
  considering the castle used to occupy the whole mountain and not just the top , i do n't think we can say they were lazy !, 
  i think you were lucky the day you visited takahashi ; there are plenty pretty views in japan but few times can you find yourself in a beautiful castle on a misty mountain . 
  did n't they finish at the end of march 2015 ? 
  i went in july last year ( 2016 ) and there were no constructions going on , other than scaffolding on a small side building with a few photos of the works .
