  they do n't give the names of the places , so it 's going to be hard to know which ones to avoid . 
  unless you skip onsens alltogether in tohoku , apparently . 
  plus , `` the ministry [ ... ] saying the levels were unlikely to cause health problems for users who take conventional baths '' . 
  ah sorry , did n't see the * about * . 
  also for people who were born/live in the us . 
  i live in catalonia , here things are pretty cool for gay people and i have never been discriminated against or had any negative comments about my sexuality . 
  i can happily hold my girlfriend 's hand in public without worrying . 
  `` someone assumed i speak a language other than english '' ... well , yes , i live in spain . 
  i stopped doing the survey half way through when i realised it was n't directed to me . 
  ^ this . 
  i 'm mixed race , also the option ` latino or hispanic american ' ( as well as the other similar ones ) is a bit confusing , as i 'm hispanic but not american , and not latino . 
  also , i was born in spain and live in spain , but have spent most of my life at the other side of the world , i ca n't aptly explain my situation with the choices given . 
  i just put `` extrememly '' on both , even though i do n't think either femininity or masculinity exist ( it 's too relative ) . 
  yeah , i wish i could 've expanded on my answers . 
  in a survey that 's asking your opinion , it 's kind of lacking the option to give my proper opinion . 
  an `` extra comment '' box at the end of each page would 've served . 
  thanks !, 
  it was hard to understand the table so i 've made a similar one that explains where you 'll be each day , hopefully i 'm understanding it correctly ? 
  three days in nagasaki ? 
  three in fukuoka ? 
  four in hiroshima ? 
  three in matsuyama ? 
  four in nagoya ? 
  that seems like an awfully long time in each place . 
  true , i spent four days in hiroshima , but i 'm known for being * extremely * slow-paced , most people just spend a day ( or half ) in hiroshima . 
  i think we should work on making a more suitable itinerary before getting into details about transportation . 
  what are your reasons for spending so long in each place ? 
  are you counting day trips that you have n't mentioned ? 
  in that case , it 'd be good to know about them since they could influence transportation options . 
  considering you 've already been to sapporo , why give it five more days ? 
  i think the tohoku region deserves a bit more focus rather than spending so long in sapporo or tokyo . 
  edit : i 've looked over possible transportation options for your itinerary . 
  as i see it , the most expensive journeys would be from shirakawa-go to tokyo , as well as nagasaki to fukuoka . 
  - about kyushu , i 'm unsure if there is a good pass for your situation , as all are for shorter stays ( i.e. , they work on consecutive days and so are n't very helpful if you 're staying many days in one place ) . 
  - from fukuoka to osaka , i 've allowed myself to be a bit imaginative and add a couple of extra places to your itinerary , considering it 's doubtful you 'd find much to do with so much time in fukuoka , hiroshima and matsuyama -- and osaka considering you 've already been . 
  with visits to extra places between these cities it would be much cheaper to simply take local / express trains between them . 
  as such , the route would be as follows : http://imgur.com/a/pk8dn the only trouble would between shimonoseki and iwakuni , that 's 3h by local train , you may want to take the more expensive shinkansen since there are few interesting stops near the train line . 
  - the days you are in osaka , kyoto and nagoya you wo n't be spending much money on transport so you obviously wo n't be needing any pass there . 
  the trip to kyoto  nagoya is also pretty cheap and can easily be done by train . 
  - the journey from gero  shirakawa-go to tokyo is definitely the most expensive . 
  obviously buying a jr pass wo n't be of much use , you could possibly take the bus fro shirakawa-go to toyama and take the shinkansen to tokyo from there , paying that ticket individually . 
  - from the 16th-28th you can use a jr east pass ( tohoku version ) . 
  that gives you 5 non-consecutive days to be able to use the shinkansen and jr trains freely , i would use it on the 16th , 17th , 18th , 27th and 28th ( you must return to tokyo to sleep on the 28th ) . 
  1 - i do n't really have much of a feeling of being european . 
  i do n't think about it at all unless i 'm travelling around , which is very infrequently , or someone asks me , like now . 
  2 - pride is not a feeling i often feel in connection to land or identity . 
  i ca n't remember the last time i felt proud to be anything . 
  ultimately , it has nothing to do with my personal effort . 
  3 - a bunch of places in close range that i can travel to easily . 
  convenience . 
  and the euro , i guess . 
  it could be good to leave a space for us to write a comment , as i felt that my opinion was n't really reflected well only with the questions asked . 
  ^ in the us . 
  maybe you should add that this is for people in the us , as i voted for the republican left of catalonia -- catalonia s\u00ed , and i doubt that 's what you 're looking for with the survey . 
  yeah , the blue line would be what i 'm unsure about as i do n't really know your preferences . 
  i personally would take the train but maybe you 'd prefer to take the shinkansen . 
  nice !, 
  i did n't know about the zen retreat or the washi workshop . 
  there 's been a lot of work put into it , thanks for sharing this . 
  i do n't mean to be judgemental or anything , but you did post here for feedback so i 'll give my opinions :, 
  i feel like the images could be changed . 
  not because they 're bad or ugly ( they are n't ) , but it does n't seem like they 're your photos . 
  meaning , perhaps something more representative of what the activity would look like would be best . 
  for example , seeing someone meditate at the beach during the sunset ... i feel like is a bit of a false image of what the retreat 's about , as well as being a bit westernised . 
  for someone looking for an authentic experience , i think it could be good to show a more real setting ( or at least different to what everyone thinks about / sees when the google ` meditation ' ) as it would be more attractive . 
  the lacquerware and katana photos , while they 're pretty , i think one of your personal photos would look better and less like advertising . 
  also , if i did n't already know what washi is , i would n't understand it by looking at the photo . 
  finally , every photo is very different from each other . 
  the washi next to the katana image is quite strange , as they share nothing in common -- colour , size , ambience expressed . 
  having the katana in black and white , but the sake one in colour looks odd . 
  perhaps try to keep some resemblance or connection between the photos of the same line , whether it be colour or size , i think would look more profesional / reliable as a source of information . 
  also , the next thing somebody is going to do is read the writing of each activity on the front page . 
  jumping right into the location or history does n't really help explain what the activity is or what it 's about . 
  perhaps use the first few lines as an introduction to what wajima-nuri is and what you 'd be doing in the workshop ( a quick introduction , you do n't have to get into details , as you could expand more in further paragraphs once they 've clicked on it ) . 
  just a few things off the top of my head . 
  but really , i did like reading about the different workshops , perhaps i 'll try one out myself if i 'm going to one of those places !, 
  i think in a town like yame they would love to see a foreign tourist . 
  while i have n't been to yame specifically , i have been to other rural towns and there is always someone willing to help if i look lost ( even if we do n't speak the same language ) , some excitement involved in having a visitor , or they really just do n't care and would n't look oddly at you for looking clueless . 
  yame seems similar to takehara in hiroshima , and i was well-received there , even with people starting up conversation . 
  i speak close to no japanese and have n't really had a problem moving around . 
  even in the most remote places it seems like all the stations have the name of the place in english , if not then you could simply take the names of the places written down and work from there . 
  as as transportation , there are buses in the area . 
  there are definitely some going to the center of town , i 'll look and see if i can find one reaching the tea fields . 
  ** edit ** : it seems like there are n't any going up to the tea fields themselves , however there are buses going to the center of town . 
  you could take the bus until town , get off at either fukushima district ( \u798f\u5cf6 ) or at the next stop ( \u5f8c\u30ce\u6c5f\u56db\u30c4\u89d2 ) . 
  from fukushima it 's 15 minutes by taxi ( you should organise one before going , as i doubt there 'll be any there on the ready ) for about 2000 yen , or about 40min walk to the fields from \u5f8c\u30ce\u6c5f\u56db\u30c4\u89d2 . 
  two different buses stop at these two places , here are the timetables : http://www.horikawabus.jp/local/table/newest/01.pdf and http://www.horikawabus.jp/local/table/newest/03.pdf, 
  for the location of the tea fields on google maps write \u516b\u5973\u4e2d\u592e\u5927\u8336\u5712 \u8336\u7551 . 
  ** edit 2 ** : after yame you could fill in the rest of the day with a visit to yanagawa on the other side of the train line ( [ bus ] ( http://www.horikawabus.jp/local/table/newest/10.pdf ) ) . 
  true , i went there and it was definitely one of the best places ( and the one that made me cry the most ) . 
  here 's the [ trip report ] ( https://tokyoanecdote.wordpress.com/2016/08/01/peace-sites-of-hiroshima/ ) by the way . 
  i really think you should visit hiroshima the day you arrive from himeji , as you are adding a considerable amount of time moving from hiroshima station to miyajima and it 's a pity to waste valuable day time hours on the train . 
  the last ferry to miyajima is around 10pm or something , so you could still sleep on the island after the city sightseeing if you prefer . 
  plus , that way you could start the visit to mt.misen before the crowds of tourists arrive , and it would be empty at the top of the mountain . 
  also , are you leaving hiroshima by plane or shinkansen ? 
  well , a jr pass should be cheaper than taking a flight to tokyo , especially with the rest of the shinkansen journeys . 
  it would also give you more time to enjoy the area since getting to the airport and waiting around there should take up quite a bit of time . 
  do have in mind though , that the journey from hiroshima to tokyo is very long , you might want to visit kyoto , then hiroshima , then osaka and hence cut the journey in half . 
  i do n't really care . 
  if that 's what they wanted , good for them , if not ... well , sorry , i guess .
