  41 % is a huge number ... 
  it does n't really make that much of a difference . 
  i did mt.takao at the end of june and it was great . 
  i think it 's a good time to go because it 's a nice temperature . 
  of course , if the rainy season has already stared , do n't expect much for views , and make sure to read about possible hiking dangers if everything is wet . 
  the 6th trail of mt.takao is fine even if it rains , most of it is covered by trees so it does n't get too slippery . 
  i do n't know about the other trails . 
  there are plenty ghibli related places around japan that are n't too popular or crowded . 
  that 's why i skipped the museum . 
  i know my opinion is not common , but i love nagoya . 
  as a history fan there are so many historic towns/cities nearby that make good day trips ( places belonging to the nakasendo and tokaido , lots of castles , battlefields , hometowns of famous historic people , etc. 
  ) , hostels in the city are cheap , the buildings are very interesting and there are lots of observation platforms , it has some nice and `` secret '' shrines , ferries to the rural islands nearby , it looks nice at night ... it 's true that a day , or even a half day , in the city is enough to see about all the more common sites , but if you 're open to seeing less touristy places then it can be more interesting . 
  thank you for the recommendation . 
  i usually listen to ncs , but this is similar . 
   what a lone person can explore and do, 
  about the same as someone who 's going in pairs or small group . 
  the exception might be some ryokans that do n't allow solo bookings ( maybe unless you pay for two people anyway ) and some experiences can be less interesting if you do n't have anyone there with you ( amusement parks , the tea ceremony , partying , geisha parties , etc. ) . 
  i 'm unsure as to why you find katashina particularly interesting . 
  other than a bit of hiking there is little else to do and see . 
  however , if you rent a car you can explore other rural areas nearby that can be cool ( fukiware falls , akagi shrine , kashozan mirokuji , takaragawa onsen , haruna shrine , etc. ) . 
  although gunma prefecture is close to tokyo it does n't usually feature in tourist plans , so just about anywhere you visit there would be considered `` off the beaten path '' . 
  my favourite place in gunma is [ takasaki ] ( https://tokyoanecdote.wordpress.com/2016/03/06/shorinzan-daruma-ji-temple-takasaki-%e9%ab%98%e5%b4%8e%e5%b8%82/ ) . 
  i do n't think there are any particular must-sees ( in japan or elsewhere ) . 
  while of course some places are more popular than others , in the end you should really just visit what you find interesting rather than what 's popular . 
  there 's no better way to waste limited time and money than visiting a place you do n't find exciting just because some people says that it 's an absolute must . 
  most one time visitors have n't visited that many places to be able to compare what 's best anyway . 
  while i agree with what you 're saying in a general sense , if the downvoting option is taken out , i think the upvoting option should also be taken out . 
  the most upvoted comments rise to the top and people passing through usually just upvote or downvote without getting into the sub-comments . 
  the `` discussion '' is sometimes even ignored by the person who left the first comment too . 
  in such cases , there is little that someone can do if they disagree with the upvoted comment , because nobody will listen . 
  downvoting in this case will give a voice to the people who disagree . 
  if people can only upvote then it could seem as if an offensive opinion is very popular , since there will always be someone who agrees and will upvote , hence encouraging other people to make similar comments . 
  that is my biggest problem with upvoting / no downvoting . 
  what i 've found most useful , and generally used by the subs where i enjoy being the most , is the [ hidden score ] since it avoids the bandwagon effect . 
  - the most popular location would probably be yakushima island from southern kyushu , known for its lush green forests that are very similar to the nature from ** princess mononoke **, 
  - studio ghibli inc. is located somewhere in koganei ( tokyo ) and hayao miyazaki has said in interviews that he visits the [ edo tokyo open air museum ] ( https://tokyoanecdote.wordpress.com/2016/03/07/edo-tokyo-open-air-museum-part-2-impromptu-tours-and-tatami-mats/ ) often . 
  one of the streets lined with historic houses is actually said to be the inspiration for ** spirited away ** 's town , and the yellow train there is featured in the movie too . 
  the bathhouse of the museum also has similarities to the movie 's bathhouse , and one of the buildings includes a wall with drawers similar to the ones in kamaji 's boiler room , making this just about a must-see place for spirited away fans . 
  i 've been there myself and can confirm it 's an awesome place to visit regardless of spirited away though , if one has a bit of interest in architecture or history . 
  i 've also heard the bridge from matsumoto castle was used for the bridge from the film , but i guess there are many read bridges in japan anyway . 
  - while we 're still on spirited away , if you want to ride in a round ` boat ' like the one chihiro uses when going off to the train station , head over to [ sado island ] ( https://www.google.es/search?q=tarai-bune&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewiktssqxyjsahxixxqkhxawbneq_auiccgb&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=589 ) . 
  - hayao miyazaki was inspired to create the character of ** ponyo ** during his stay at the town of tomonoura ( hiroshima prefecture ) . 
  while ponyo 's house does n't really exist , you can still see the coastal town feel of the place . 
  to be honest , i 'd say that any town along the coast is similar , so a place like onomichi is more accesible and would be just as enjoyable . 
  - [ seibien ] ( http://www.en-aomori.com/culture-024.html ) in aomori was used as the inspiration for the house in arrietty . 
  - just off the shore of wakayama city is an island chain by the name of tomogashima . 
  out of these , [ okinoshima ] ( http://www.wakayamakanko.com/eng/sightseeing/history9.html ) has many military ruins that remind of the structures appearing in ** castle in the sky ** . 
  other places to visit if you 're interested in this movie would be mount tomamu or takeda castle . 
  - ** from up in poppy hill ** was based off the yamate area of yokohama . 
  i think scenes from ** the cat returns ** were also inspired by yokohama , but you should look into that . 
  - kamikochi imperial hotel ( kamikochi ) or mampei hotel ( karuizawa ) are the apparent locations where the characters from ** the wind rises ** stay . 
  i 've checked the prices and they are anywhere between 30,000 - 100,000 yen a night , so not the cheapest , but i guess you can look at them from outside if you have a car to get there . 
  - also from what i 've seen , the ghibli museum gift shop is kind of expensive . 
  kiddyland store in harajuku has a whole floor dedicated to studio ghibli ; there 's also a ghibli store in tokyo station ( character street ) . 
  anything from calcifer frying pans , ponyo finger puppets , jiji plushies , totoro pens and no-face piggiebanks you can get at tokyo station and kiddyland . 
  they do n't have many figurines though , you 'll want to buy those online or at the museum if you 're interested . 
  the biggest problems would be that magome-tsumago is n't exactly close to tokyo , it would require 3 hours one way if you go via nagoya , as well as hiroshima also being very far away . 
  i would perhaps do hiroshima  kiso valley  tokyo on the first day to cut down the transportation time . 
  i have been to many of these places and do n't really speak japanese , so you should n't have any problems getting around . 
  yamadera and hiraizumi are both two of my favourite places in japan and do n't get nearly enough credit , it 's nice to see someone finally get off the more touristy route and go up north . 
  osu kannon and atsuta jingu are nagoya 's most famous temple and shrine . 
  atsuta jingu is well worth going out of the way to visit , since it 's not near the station or castle , especially if you like history ( it has the sword of the three imperial regalia , as well as being one of the few shrines in japan with the ` jingu ' status ) . 
  if you do n't want to go all the way to atsuta jingu , nagoya shrine ( \u90a3\u53e4\u91ce\u795e\u793e ) and nagoya toshogu shrine ( \u540d\u53e4\u5c4b\u6771\u7167\u5bae ) are both next to each other and in front of the castle . 
  they 're small shrines that you wo n't even find on google maps with their english name , but are nice and green and quiet . 
  katayama shrine ( \u7247\u5c71\u795e\u793e ) is also similar , albeit a bit further away . 
  there are also still buildings in nagoya from the meiji period . 
  while i prefer more traditional residences since meiji buildings look very western , in nagoya they have some curious mixes combining the two styles . 
  check out the shumokukan ( \u6587\u5316\u306e\u307f\u3061 \u6a66\u6728\u9928 ) , the toyoda sasuke residence ( \u65e7\u8c4a\u7530\u4f50\u52a9\u90b8 , home of the founder of toyota ) and nagoya shisei shiryokan ( \u540d\u53e4\u5c4b\u5e02\u5e02\u653f\u8cc7\u6599\u9928 ) . 
  i 'm sure you know that the nakasendo ( as well as the tokaido , a similar route but along the coast ) connected tokyo ( then edo ) and kyoto . 
  as such , there were many many stations and post towns to stop and rest along the way ( 69 of them ) . 
  most , if not all , modern cities along the route have some sort of remnant of that past , however in most cases this means only a sign or one small building left . 
  from tokyo to nagano prefecture there 's just about nothing left worth seeing , but from then on the route gets a bit more interesting . 
  the best conserved post towns are narai-juku , fukushima-juku , the well known magome and tsumago , nakatsugawa-juku , okute-juku and samegai-juku . 
  there is a section of the old path between tsumago and magome if you 're interested in walking rather than just visiting the post towns , as well as another bit between magome and nakatsugawa . 
  since magome-tsumago is also the place most people visit , there are many accommodations in both post towns and many souvenir shops and restaurants . 
  if you 're interested in walking a bit of the nakasendo beyond the more touristy places i would recommend a route like this :, 
  - day 0 ) possibly sleep in narai . 
  - day 1 ) start in narai . 
  after looking around a bit take the train and bus to tsumago ( do n't forget to visit the nagiso museum ) , walk to magome that same day ( and visit the museums and places there ) . 
  sleep in magome . 
  - day 2 ) walk to nakatsugawa passing through the old path and the small ochiai-juku . 
  take the train to kamado and visit okute-juku . 
  the path between magome and nakatsugawa is small , you 'll mostly be passing through rural houses rather than the nakasendo , but it 's still very nice . 
  okute-juku is very small but it 's worth visiting if you have an interest in history ( princess chikako stayed at this town during her travels along the nakasend\u014d ) . 
  - if you have another day , you can easily take the shinkansen to maibara and visit samegai-juku , as well as kamo shrine and hikone castle ( these last two are n't related to the nakasendo but still worth a visit ) . 
  planning this solo depends on your ability to find accommodation online ( via hotels booking websites or google maps ) and finding out about train / bus connections . 
  the jrpass would depend on the rest of the trip , although if you 're doing both tokyo and kyoto it 's likely to pay off . 
   it 's a great place with two ** main natural attractions ** that i went to ( kegon fall , lake chuzenji ) . 
  very worth for the atmosphere . 
  i think op did go to the nikko shrines , but simply stated the two natural areas they visited there since they may have been a favourite . 
  fushimi inari is the only reason i went to kyoto , and honestly it was by far the best place there . 
  i would suggest you really do n't miss out on it . 
  i went at 7am , there was nobody there at that time !, 
  i had no idea t\u00e0rraco was part of the unesco . 
  i 've been around tarragona , to the villa dels munts and past l\u2019arc de ber\u00e0 so many times , it 's strange to think that they 're so important . 
  great post , by the way . 
  i do n't know where you 're coming from , but i usually travel from spain and arrive from a flight that 's 9h + ; i really ca n't be bothered to do anything other than sleep the first day , especially at that time . 
  it 's not about lack of enthusiasm or not wanting to do something , it 's simply way too tiring . 
  by the way , make sure your hostel / hotel allows you to check in so late . 
  sendai 's zunda mochi is the nicest mochi i 've ever tasted .
