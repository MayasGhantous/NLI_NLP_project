  not even an exaggeration . 
  - it 's free, 
  - there are no opening-closing times so it gives me much more liberty to explore the place when alone , that 's something that really earns points for me ( the 9am opening time limits a lot my itinerary ) . 
  - i love inari shrines, 
  - i love yokai , so i guess the kitsune feeling in general was cool, 
  - there are plenty of temples with moss , traditional residences , gardens and historic spots in japan , that 's why the three places you mentioned never stood out ( i 've seen similar things before many times ) . 
  however i ca n't compare the sheer amount of torii at fushimi inari to anywhere else . 
  you could say it 's unique , even if there are many inari shrines all over the country , none are quite so large and impressive . 
  - it was the first place i ever heard about japan back when i was a kid , so we could say it has a special meaning to me personally . 
  in the end , i guess this is the most valuable thing about this place , is that it means something to me other than being simply a pretty view . 
  anything that can make me feel happy or smile just by being there is worth it . 
  anywhere that makes me think `` i love being here '' ca n't really compete with other places on the same level . 
  i backpack all the time in japan . 
  not quite the `` pitch my tent at a campsite and cook with my mini-stove '' type , but yes to the `` ultra-light packing and hiking , sleeping in dorms and wake up at 5am '' style . 
  there are hostels and guest houses just about all over the place . 
  i say `` just about '' because there are n't that many in rural places / off the beaten path , however there are still other cheap options available regardless ( business hotels , small ryokans , capsule hotels , manga caf\u00e9s , etc. ) . 
  if you 're going to tokyo , kyoto , osaka , hiroshima , nara and the like there are hostel dorms at 2500 yen ( sometimes under ) in each of these cities . 
  you 'll have no problem meeting other travellers in these places ( you might want to * get away * from so many tourists at times ) . 
  as for prices , i wrote some time ago how much i spent on one of my trips [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/japantravel/comments/4sc50s/budget_breakdown_from_my_recent_trip/ ) . 
  also , thailand 's banana pancake : no competition . 
  i thought it had to do with cages for bats ... 
  i would suggest something like this : http://i.imgur.com/mxf1hh8.png, 
  - 10th - okunoshima ( start early since there are n't that many ferries ) + probably a bit of sightseeing in miyajima or hiroshima later ( sleep in miyajima or hiroshima ), 
  you could do the shimanami kaido in one day if you are pretty fit / cycle often and start as soon as the bike rental opens in the morning ( i think it 's 7am or something ) . 
  however , i personally think it would be more enjoyable to not rush and be able to sleep on one of the islands halfway , possibly also visit other sights on the islands ( such as kosanji or innoshima suigun castle ) . 
  - 13th - shimanami kaido ( you can also sleep in a ryokan or hotel in kurashiki for a nice tranquil atmosphere ), 
  - 14th - himeji + osaka evening ( maybe you could add in a visit to [ mt.shosha ] ( https://tokyoanecdote.wordpress.com/2016/07/13/a-morning-at-mt-shosha/ ) ? ), 
  you should really just dress normally . 
  honestly , nobody really cares where you 're from , they 'll be doing their own thing . 
  the only way i can think you 'll specifically stand out is if you 're speaking very loudly in english or something ( though even then nobody will really look twice at you ) . 
  was it khaosan ninja ? 
   the united states is n't the freest country in the world ** due to the two party system . 
   we are n't the best country in the world and ** this is mostly due to the two party system . 
  whether the two party system works or not is n't exactly a good enough reason to say that the us is free or `` the best '' . 
  far from it . 
  there is a thing called the [ index of freedom in the world ] ( https://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/human-freedom-index-files/human-freedom-index-2016.pdf ) which ranks the different countries in order of `` freedom '' . 
  it takes into account things such as freedom of speech , freedom of religion , violence and crimes , lgbt rights , women 's rights , human trafficking , sexual violence , etc. 
  sorry to say that the us does not rank in the top 10 , it 's actually the 23rd as of 2016 . 
  if you think freedom is a synonym of `` best '' , then the us is definitely not the best country in the world . 
  the u.s. scores its highest marks in water , sanitation , and child development . 
  however , it fails heavily on violence ( mostly gun crime ) . 
  natural disasters , hiv , suicide , obesity and alcohol abuse are other topics that are n't too cool in the us . 
  until * mid-2015 * there were still states in the us that did n't recognize same sex marriage ( that 's not even two years ago ! ) . 
  as someone who does n't live in the us , it 's easier for me to point out the negative things . 
  however , it 's important that * everyone * keeps in mind the good and the bad of their own countries in order to improve , the us has [ a dangerous amount of people who seriously think the us is the best country in the world ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/5en7pl/people_who_think_they_live_in_the_best_country_in/ ) , and that really does n't help at all . 
  have in mind that you 're competing against countries like switzerland , new zealand , finland , portugal , malta , germany , australia ... all of which rank higher in the oficial `` freedom index '' . 
  the us is a great country , it 's true that the political system needs some work ( as do most , if not all , countries ) , but it 's not the best and the political system is only a small part of what makes a country . 
  [ here it is ] ( https://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/human-freedom-index-files/human-freedom-index-2016.pdf ) ( page 20 ), 
  whether you personally should be scared or not depends on where you 're from and where you live . 
  for example , i live in spain and although trump has managed to say some offensive comment or other against us ( and our latin friends ) , his decisions and the country 's actions have little * direct * influence on me and my country . 
  as such , i am personally not scared . 
  i have little optimism for the immediate future of the us ( and of course the consequences on a global scale ) and things are spiralling downwards quickly , but i still have some hope that trump wo n't last the full 4 years and that the social acceptance and consiousness that has been improving in the last years in the us wo n't let anything * too * awful happen during that time . 
  however , if i were a muslim living in the us , i would seriously consider going to live elsewhere , i would probably be more nervous if i was living in one of the countries under nato and next to russia too . 
  i probably wo n't be travelling to north america in the next 4-6 years or until things improve considerably ( including their attitudes to the outside world ) . 
  so , i do n't think you 're being irrational in the fear , depending of course where you 're from , but i would leave some space for a little hope , as not everything is bad . 
   their political process appears to be more corrupt than average when compared to other western nations . 
  as a spaniard i 'd have to disagree with that one ... 
   should i shit the bed every time i see a `` kill all men/kill all whites '' meme ? 
  before you say it 's different ... 
  it is different . 
  the gender-selective mass killings the book speaks of is about killing `` the group posing the greatest danger to the conquering force . '', 
  nazis killing jews had nothing to do with that , they killed kids , women and men , disabled included , simply because they thought they were inferior . 
  it was a hate crime . 
  men abusing and killing women , especially in this day and age , is to show power and strength over them . 
  both white people and men have an incredible advantage ( privilege ) in the world and few times are the target of hate crimes based on their colour and sex . 
  eliminating a threat is not the same as killing someone because you do n't like them / for fun / as a `` proof '' of power . 
  i 'm going to be that person who says i did n't like wolf children . 
  i mean , why did the kids have to decide whether they wanted to be wolf or human ? 
  the dad lived a double life , so why not them ? 
  it felt like the whole movie was based on this notion , which does n't really make sense at all . 
  it 's a pity since i was looking forward to new great movies from that director after the girl who leapt through time . 
  summer wars was much better . 
  yeah , i hear it often as background music in travel videos too ... it 's nice to listen to the less popular songs though . 
  out of all the anime movies i 've watched , wolf children is close to the bottom , honestly . 
  the animation was great but i ca n't say that i think it 's a good movie since it was lacking a decent logical plot . 
  i wish i had n't wasted my time watching it . 
  i 'm usually not so critical with anime movies but it was just really disappointing , not worth the 8 euros . 
  the girl who leapt through time is amazing though , i 've re-watched it so many times and even still listen to the soundtrack . 
  i would like to have 0 children in my lifetime . 
  talking about the sex of a hypothetical nonexistent child does n't really mean i want said child to actually exist . 
  the question implies ** if i had ** a child , not ** if i wanted to have and had ** a child . 
  i heard this word many many years ago at the start of my internet days when i was about 12 and had no idea what it meant . 
  this was before the lol became popular ( rofl , stfu and similar things were n't around ) and i did n't know using the first letter of words to make another one was a thing that people did . 
  i actually put ` lmao ' into google translator and it said some very weird thing about inhaling toxic smoke . 
  for years i thought that people writing lmao were all smokers , until i finally realised what it actually meant a year ago or something . 
  so definitely out of the loop on this one . 
  ( i also thought the lmao was an imao so i still pronounce it as an * i * in my head . ), 
  - he should n't have paid the two kids to hold up such a sign . 
  the biggest problem is using such a sentence to begin with . 
  joking about killing all jews when majority of his audience are young pre-teens that like to pick up jokes and trends from the internet ... i think he needs to be more careful on what he chooses to say in his videos . 
  - when he saw that they did go through with it he should n't have posted it in the video , he should 've cut it out . 
  - the media has definitely taken things out of context , which does n't help the actual issue , and have blown it up considerably . 
  i understand that disney has wanted to drop him , i understand less that youtubered has dropped him , but ultimately he still has millions of subscribers and lots of money coming in anyway . 
  - it 's right that he apologised properly and let it calm down rather than overly play the victim card . 
  people make mistakes ( even though i think this is n't a mistake he should 've done ) and he has apologised sincerely and properly in the past for other offensive jokes he 's said . 
  i think his attitude towards these topics is good . 
  in general , i think there are some things that can be said and some things that ca n't , even if it 's a `` joke '' , but he obviously crossed the line and is now suffering the consequences . 
  as such an important content creator i think it 's important to keep in mind what things can be touchy topics and what is okay to say . 
  `` kill all jews '' is not an okay thing to say . 
  i think pewds is a nice guy , i used to follow him back when he was doing the corpse party playthroughs , but in the last year i think his content has gotten a bit overly ridiculous .
