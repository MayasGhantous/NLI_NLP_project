  i respect the effort he puts into his content and the work he 's done to get so big , but i also think he needs to cut down on the making fun of people and sexual jokes for him to be an adequate role model to anyone . 
  also the computer keyboard ... 
  i really like the tohoku region and it really does n't get enough love . 
  places like [ ** matsushima ** ] ( http://beauty-of-japan.com/tour/matsushima-homestay-fishery-experience/ ) ( one of the three scenic views of japan along with miyajima and amanohashidate ) , [ ** kakunodate ** ] ( http://kakunodate-kanko.jp/language/en/samurai/ ) ( a nice calm samurai town ) , [ ** ouchijuku ** ] ( https://www.ana-cooljapan.com/destinations/fukushima/ouchi-juku ) ( an old post town that still looks very traditional ) , [ ** hirosaki ** ] ( http://www.en-aomori.com/culture-020.html ) ( with one of few original castles in japan ) , [ ** yamadera ** ] ( http://zoomingjapan.com/travel/yamadera/ ) ( a temple at the top of a mountain , lovely walk to get there ) , the [ ** geibikei gorge ** ] ( http://www.japan-iwate.info/app/location_detail.php?lid=119 ) ( boat ride down the gorge ) , etc. 
  are places that are most popular to visit . 
  `` popular '' in tohoku does n't mean the crowds of tourist spots further south , so they are still pretty tranquil and nice to visit . 
  personally i really recommend the [ ** dewa sanzan ** ] ( http://hagurokanko.jp/en/ ) , a short pilgrimage to three sacred shrines of shugendo ( or at least only hagurosan if you 're short on time ) and [ ** hiraizumi ** ] ( http://www.hiraizumi.or.jp/en/index.html ) , a beautiful town that used to rival kyoto during the late heian period until minamoto no yoritomo wiped out the fujiwara clan and consequently the city ( he was after his brother yoshitsune , who was hiding in hiraizumi ) . 
  there are still a couple of brilliant temples there and many ruins and museums worth visiting . 
  if tohoku is n't what you 're looking for , [ ** izumo ** and ** matsue ** ] ( http://www.visit-matsue.com/ ) are two of my favourites , as are [ ** kurashiki ** ] ( https://tokyoanecdote.wordpress.com/2016/07/25/boat-ride-down-kurashikis-canal/ ) and [ ** takasaki ** ] ( https://tokyoanecdote.wordpress.com/2016/03/06/shorinzan-daruma-ji-temple-takasaki-%e9%ab%98%e5%b4%8e%e5%b8%82/ ) ( including haruna shrine ) . 
   it 's entirely innate that we find incest icky, 
  it is n't innate because it has happened time and time again through history . 
  several of the egyptian pharaohs married their siblings and had several children with them . 
  sibling marriages were widespread among all classes in egypt during the graeco-roman period , including , by the way , cleopatra being married to her brother and her parents also being siblings . 
  in ancient greece a brother and sister were allowed to marry if they had different mothers . 
  it 's also definitely a common theme in folklore all over the world . 
  many european monarchs as well as royal family in japan , korea , inca per\u00fa , africa , hawaii , etc. 
  were related due to political marriages . 
  there are countries where incest ( no offspring included ) between consenting adults is allowed , including in the netherlands , france , slovenia and spain , sweden also allows marriage between half-siblings . 
   it causes health problems , deformities , etc. 
  the deformity thing is n't really true . 
  there is a greater risk of various handicaps due to a closer sharing of genetics , but it 's not like a monster will be born . 
  things that can happen :, 
  - reduced fertility, 
  - increased chance of a genetic disorder, 
  - a lower birth rate as well as higher infant/child mortality, 
  and other similar things . 
  the problem would mostly be if the siblings had kids , the kids had kids and their kids had kids . 
  if it 's a one time thing , it 's really only a small difference . 
  i 'd argue that incest was banned for :, 
  - mentioned health problems in offspring . 
  - intermarriage ( and having children ) between groups constructs valuable alliances between them . 
  in the end the reasons are lost and it simply became habit to not marry family , later becoming taboo . 
  first and foremost , refugees come from a country in war , they 've lost their homes and possessions , in many cases their families and people they love , the kids are missing out on education , if they 're coming to europe it means they 've managed to cross the dangerous mediterranean from turkey to greece without dying . 
  innocent people . 
  i imagine my sister going through something like this and it 's simply * not fair * that good people , including children , have to go through this . 
  i will gladly give up my job if that means that at least one of them will be able to * live * , especially if that means a decent and happy life . 
  i ca n't remember who said it but i want barcelona to be a `` city of hope '' for the people who most need it right now . 
  they need safety , food and a home . 
  second , if i ca n't get a job it would n't be too hard for me to go elsewhere to find one , most refugees do n't have the same amount of resources as i do . 
  i have studies and more opportunities than them , so either way i do n't feel threatened . 
  i do n't see it as `` my country '' and `` their country '' . 
  if they 're clever and are good competition , then they deserve the job , it does n't matter where they 're from . 
  if one of them comes along and proves to know what they 're doing more than me , it 's true i will probably be slightly annoyed but i aknowledge that it 's for the best . 
  giving the job to the best of the two will only improve a society . 
  would n't you want the best doctor to do an operation on you , rather than a less-better one simply because they 're spanish ? 
  also , refugees are consumers as well as workers . 
  it did clarify at the paragraph at the start . 
  it does clarify this at the paragraph at the start . 
  sure , but people , including both americans and europeans , do n't know the names of the states of russia or india , the regions of spain or finland , the prefectures of japan , etc. 
  let alone ** where they are ** inside those countries . 
  if you do n't live in that country it 's of little importance to know this . 
  if i do n't know where algarve is ... it does n't really matter . 
  since i 'm not american , i could n't care less where pennsylvania is on the map , it has no relevance to me and has never been brought up in any conversation . 
  ( to be fair , i do know most of the states because i talk to many americans online and they love to talk about them . ), 
  true , not long ago i realised that latvia is what we spanish people call letonia ... 
  no , i never said it was . 
  americans are n't stupid . 
  however , many surveys have been done questioning the geography knowledge of americans ( including by [ national geographic ] ( http://www.nationalgeographic.com/roper2006/findings.html ) ) , so it 's easy to say that americans are n't that great at it . 
  i doubt other countries have much higher scores though , you 'd have to look at stats by country individually . 
  yeah , that 's where i got stuck too . 
  the irs ( internal revenue service ) is the us government agency responsible for tax collection and tax law enforcement , according to google . 
  [ other equivalent terms if you 're from other countries ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/revenue_service ) . 
  i really like your long hair , i do n't really have a preferance on the glasses / shaved since there is n't too much of a difference . 
  terrorism does n't really count as a science ... 
  yeah , i got much more poetic with my answers than i would 've if they were asked and would be read by someone who speaks catalan . 
  it might be a good idea to post this in r/askeurope to get other languages , or find the subreddits of specific countries to have more than one result in the same language . 
  [ this was asked yesterday . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/spain/comments/5v0bkw/let_me_get_this_straightabout_barcelona/ ), 
  perhaps the most popular rural places would be shirakawa-go , the [ ** nakasendo ** ] ( https://www.nakasendoway.com/ ) and doing the [ ** kumano kodo ** ] ( http://www.tb-kumano.jp/en/kumano-kodo/ ) . 
  they are all worth a visit but not exactly off-the-beaten path . 
  places like [ ** ouchijuku ** ] ( https://www.ana-cooljapan.com/destinations/fukushima/ouchi-juku ) ( an old post town that still looks very traditional ) , [ ** yamadera ** ] ( http://zoomingjapan.com/travel/yamadera/ ) ( a temple at the top of a mountain , lovely walk to get there , and views out onto rural yamagata ) , the [ ** iya gorge ** ] ( http://oboke-iya.jp/en/ ) are also well known but not so often visited . 
  i also recommend cycling the [ ** kibi plain ** ] ( https://www.okayama-japan.jp/en/spot/931 ) and [ ** fukiya furusato ** ] ( https://www.okayama-japan.jp/en/spot/953 ) , perhaps visited alongside bitchu-takahashi since the bus departs from there , as well as [ ** hiraizumi ** ] ( http://www.hiraizumi.or.jp/en/index.html ) , a beautiful town that used to rival kyoto during the late heian period until minamoto no yoritomo wiped out the fujiwara clan and consequently the city ( he was after his brother yoshitsune , who was hiding in hiraizumi ) . 
  there are still a couple of brilliant temples there and many ruins and museums worth visiting . 
  if you go a bit beyond the town center you will soon find numerous rice fields and peace and quiet . 
  well , to go to takayama you would have to backtrack to tokyo , so i do n't know if that counts as an `` in-between '' . 
  the first place that comes to mind is shizuoka , especially kun\u014dzan t\u014dsh\u014d-g\u016b and sunpu castle , though there are many other things to do in the city with a full day . 
  the makinohara plateau nearby is also very scenic . 
  around nagoya there are many castles , nagoya castle , hikone castle and inuyama castle being the best ones to visit if castles are of only limited interest . 
  omihachiman is very pretty , otsu has a very interesting history ( as well as views over lake biwa ) and iga ueno could also be worth a visit . 
  i agree with the point you 're trying to make but there are a couple or inaccuracies :, 
   a majority of china was confucianist , which had no tie to religion , and was simply a moral and ethical code . 
  the whole debate about whether confucianism is a religion or not is complicated and not entirely relevant to get into details ( you can read more about it [ here ] ( http://www2.kenyon.edu/depts/religion/fac/adler/writings/still%20hazy%20-%20minzu.pdf ) ) , however it 's clear there are at least * some * ties to `` religion '' even if you do n't think it is one entirely , if there were absolutely no ties there would be no confusion and debate about this topic to begin with . 
  some people describe it as a `` humanistic religion '' , others say it is more focused on the morals and attitudes , others give more importance to the connection of ti\u0101n ( `` heaven '' ) and self and the moral code stemming from this , etc. 
  it 's a broad topic . 
   china was one of the most prosperous civilizations and had no religion , specifically during the han and ming dynasties . 
  during the han dynasty many families made ritual sacrifices ( food and animals ) to spirits / ancestors / gods , etc. 
  they believed that people had a body and soul and the soul would go to the spirit world after death ; the sacrifices were used by those in the spirits realm . 
  they also believed in the [ five powers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/three_sovereigns_and_five_emperors ) , in spirits of mountains and rivers and yin and yang . 
  taoism originated in prehistoric china and so was already existent in han china . 
  as for during the ming dynasty , main religions were confucianism , taoism , and buddhism . 
  especially in beijing and nanjing there were also muslims ( obviously in much smaller numbers than the `` big three '' , but it existed ) , and while tibetan buddhism and catholicism were restricted and censured , islam was not . 
  the han dynasty was from 202-220 bc , the ming dynasty from 1271-1368 ... there were many other dynasties in the middle , so it 's obvious that over such a long period of time beliefs were to evolve and appear . 
  it 's hard to say that during specific years there was * no * religion , especially when years before and after did . 
  tranny is like the n-word for black people . 
  it 's used often in porn , that 's why people do n't like it . 
  google `` transgender woman '' and then google `` tranny '' , you 'll see the difference , why many trans people do n't want to be associated with the term . 
  saying trans is n't difficult . 
  ! disagreewithop, 
   trannies ( or should i be disingenuously pc and say the mouthful of `` transgendered people '' ? ), 
  tranny is like the n-word for black people .
