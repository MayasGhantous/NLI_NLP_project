  under every rock there seems to be something interesting to look at , if you 're going somewhere particular and want some things to do there it may be easier than just talking about the whole country since it 's so big !, 
  good luck with the planning . 
  it 'll be hard choosing where to go if you want to go everywhere , 
  phrases i knew how to say when i travelled to japan were the basic ` thank you ' , ` please ' , ` excuse me ' as well as the almighty ` where is the __ ( eki for station ) ' and a few words here and there . 
  i did know hiragana and katakana though , even if i had no idea what i was reading . 
  you 're fine without being able to speak japanese , especially if you 're going to tokyo / kyoto / osaka / hiroshima . 
  for what it 's worth , i spent 2000-2500 yen/day on food while in japan . 
  breakfast and dinners were usually konbini food but you can easily find a place selling meals + side dishes between 600-800 yen at smaller restaurants in the back streets ( it depends on how much you eat though , i guess ) . 
  and i always had some snacks and vending machine drinks , so i think you 're fine unless you want to splurge on a huge kaiseki meal or something . 
  do n't buy the ekiben ( train lunch boxes ) since they are usually more expensive , you 'll be better off buying a packed lunch from the konbini . 
  the accommodation budget does seem a bit low though , for me . 
  most places i 've stayed at were around 2500 yen for a bed in a dorm at a hostel , but i guess with a bit of research you 'll see what you can find . 
  and i second hiroshima and kamakura btw . 
  ahh , i 'll be buying my first shuincho when i travel to japan next month !, 
  i ca n't wait to see someone writing down each temple stamp , and seeing them all together at the end of my trip !, 
  i 'm sure it 'll look beautiful . 
  i 'd leave to hiroshima early morning on july 18 so that you can also go to miyajima next to hiroshima : http://visit-miyajima-japan.com/en/ maybe even miyajima + iwakuni if you think you 'll have time . 
  many people do hiroshima + miyajima in one day , so if you 're a fast paced traveller you could get iwakuni in there which i think is a nice city : http://honyaku.j-server.com/luciwakuni/ns/tl.cgi/http%3a//kankou.iwakuni-city.net/?slang=ja&amp;tlang=en&amp;xmode=0&amp;xcharset=utf-8&amp;xjsid=0, 
  while okayama does have a few things to offer , i do n't think they 'd be too interesting for a first-timer . 
  okayama city 's gems are the gardens ( one out of the top three in japan ! ), 
  and the castle next door . 
  that 'll probably take you a few hours and you can spend the rest of the day in kurashiki nearby : https://www.kurashiki-tabi.jp/for/en/ ( of course there are other things to do in the area but kurashiki seems to be a favourite of many people ) . 
  if you think a full day for hiroshima is too much , you can couple it with onomichi / takehara / kure ... or move straight onto kurashiki for the rest of the day , and do okayama + kibi plain / takahashi / himeji the next day . 
  i also think you are n't spending enough time in kyoto . 
  with three days in kyoto i think you will be able to see the most famous sites of the city without rushing too much . 
  if you 're scared that you 'll get bored , check google for ` kyoto must-sees ' , ` kyoto tourism ' , ` kyoto to do ' or something like that and you 'll see that there 's plenty to keep you entertained . 
  osaka in my opinion is similar to tokyo , so a day or two there will be enough i think , if you 'll be going to tokyo . 
  a day in nara might be of your taste , or try some other place close-by like uji , himeji or wakayama . 
  my biggest concern , however , is that yokohama is close to tokyo ... why is it with kyoto / osaka ? 
  unless there 's another yokohama i 'm not aware of ? 
  i do n't know at what time you arrive to shinjuku on july 17 , but if you think 4-5 days in tokyo are too much , then try a day-trip like kamakura , nikko or any of the many many others : http://zoomingjapan.com/travel/day-trips-from-tokyo/, 
  - july 17 - shinjuku, 
  - july 21-23 kyoto, 
  - july 23 - nagoya sumo, 
  - july 24 - osaka, 
  - july 25 - nara, 
  - july 26-30 - tokyo + day trips to yokohama and elsewhere, 
  sorting out your days i have n't really had in mind the jr pass ( i 've never used it myself since my style of travelling is very different ) , but you can sort those out depending on the pass you want . 
  many use http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e623a.html for help on what to do in each city and area , and http://www.hyperdia.com/ for information about train connections . 
  awesome , i 've always wanted this . 
  i was so disappointed when i learnt the existing catbus is only for kids !, 
  urgh , i 've been wanting to ride the sunrise izumo for years . 
  i hope they do n't discontinue it before i get my chance !, 
  ahh , lucky you , august is a month full of festivals !, 
  niigata festival ( 7-9 aug ) is very impressive and , if you go to shikoku , you 'll be able to catch yosakoi matsuri ( 9-12 ) in kochi and the one and only awa odori ( 12-15 ) in tokushima !, 
  if i were you i 'd rush to shikoku since the festivals are so so impressive and exciting , and maybe even a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity because who knows when you 'll be back around these dates !, 
  ( check out http://www.japanvisitor.com/japanese-festivals/festival-august for more festivals during the month ) . 
  shikoku is less-touristy as a whole . 
  to get to shikoku you can stop first at kobe and pass over awaji island ( stop to see the naruto whirlpools !, 
  ) , and when you leave you can either go over the shimanami kaido to onomichi over many smaller islands ( you can go to hiroshima / miyajima from onomichi ) or there are many ferries going between different ports of shikoku and kyushu . 
  for what to do in shikoku you can go here http://www.tourismshikoku.org/brochures/ , they have many brochures of many of the cities and towns in shikoku . 
  i especially recommend iya valley . 
  yakushima is starting to become popular with foreign tourists ( if you ever want to go when there are no crowds , now 's the time ) . 
  kyushu is a place with beautiful nature , so do try to leave the cities and go to experience at least one of it 's many amazing gorges !, 
  while okinawa and amami islands are also great , i do n't think with the time and money you have it 's the best to go there on this trip . 
  i 'd say , go on a whole different trip to okinawa and spend the two full weeks there and on the islands nearby . 
  i know somebody is going to tell you that a day or half a day for hiroshima is enough , so just to make matters difficult i 'm going to contradict them : hiroshima has so much to do ( both in and around ) . 
  i spent a full week there and never got bored . 
  check http://visithiroshima.net/ for ideas on what to do if you want to spend more than just a day there , and do n't forget a visit to miyajima as you 're there . 
  if you think you 'll be bored in the city after a day , there are other towns and cities nearby that can also be interesting , like iwakuni or onomichi to state two of the popular ones . 
  or maybe you can take one of the days and do a stop at kurashiki + okayama or himeji as you make your way to osaka / kyoto . 
  it of course depends on what you like though , how much you want to get to know them , and whatever your travel style is . 
  that being said , i do think you are n't spending enough time in kyoto !, 
  when i say rush , i do mean you can spend a day in tokyo and a day or two in kobe or awaji before getting to shikoku . 
  yosakoi is until the 12th , so you have time until then if you want to catch it , or until the 14th if only interested in awa odori . 
  awa odori is one of the most famous festivals in japan , so if you can i do recommend you check it out since it 's an amazing experience . 
  i do n't really like crowds either and always avoid them avidly , but even i would be willing to stand in a swarm of bodies to catch a glimpse of it !, 
  i do n't know if i explained myself properly ... if you want to go from shikoku to kyushu there are ferries going between the two , but the way over the islands and to onomichi / hiroshima is back onto the main island from which you 'd have to take a train / shinkansen or another ferry to get to kyushu . 
  it 's hard to understand without having a map in front , but the islands are between shikoku and honshu and therefore are n't really on the way to kyushu . 
  if you are interested in islands , southern kyushu has lots ( around yakushima island that i mentioned ) and there are a few smaller ones between kyushu and shikoku that are closer to shore . 
  while i 'm sure some people would go to okinawa for only a couple of days , i think that a longer time would be better since the food and general culture and language is a bit different than the rest of japan and deserves a bit more time to fully do it justice . 
  and the price to get there and back is a bit expensive for a short stay . 
  but if you really wanted to , you could get a ferry down to okinawa or amami from kagoshima ( southern kyushu ) , and then catch a flight all the way back to tokyo . 
  i think the date of the sumo ca n't be changed from nagoya , if op already has tickets ? 
  but if it can be changed , then it is best to do it as you said . 
  haha thank you . 
  i was on a role and just continued writing xd, 
  i 'm from spain , i 've actually only been to japan once but i love legends and planning trips so i hope to go to all these places some day !, 
  i just remembered , since you are going to akihabara , you might want to check out kanda shrine there . 
  it has many ema boards with manga pictures drawn by the visitors , and it 's a very fun shrine to go to for manga fans . 
  i do n't know if you 'll be able to do them all in one trip though , some are very far apart . 
  what i do is open google maps and pin point everything , that 'll help you choose an area or route to focus on . 
  http://www.japanvisitor.com/japanese-festivals/festival-april for april festivals and http://www.japanvisitor.com/japanese-festivals/festival-may for may . 
  these are the most popular and so maybe some of the most spectacular ones you 'll find : https://www.tsunagujapan.com/10-popular-japanese-festivals/, 
  are you looking specifically for beaches ? 
  sakura has a small bamboo forest and a samurai residence ( search for \u4f50\u5009\u6b66\u5bb6\u5c4b\u6577 on google maps for the location ) as well as a good history museum ( http://thoughtandsight.com/the-national-museum-of-japanese-history-in-sakura/ ) and a few other sights . 
  this would be a good half-day trip ( you can combine it with narita on the same day ( http://thoughtandsight.com/24-hours-in-narita-city-japan/ ) . 
  also there is a nice open air museum accessible from narita called ` boso no mura ' ( \u5343\u8449\u770c\u7acb\u623f\u7dcf\u306e\u3080\u3089 ) . 
  chiba is a bigger city , capital of chiba prefecture , so a full day is good . 
  there is also a beach there . 
  sawara or katori are two towns next to the river where you can ride a boat in a more traditional ambience , i think you 'll enjoy it there : https://www.virtualtourist.com/travel/asia/japan/chiba_ken/sawara-970772/travelguide-sawara.html, 
  choshi does have a beach http://allabout-japan.com/en/article/1223/, 
  these are all pretty close to narita , but there 's also mito a bit further up , the capital of ibaraki prefecture ( neither chiba or mito are half as big as tokyo ) . 
  there 's the art tower , kodokan , takeda ujiyakata , the kokuei hitachi seaside park nearby to do but , most importantly , kairakuen is one of the three top gardens in japan !, 
  other places close by are the ushiku buddha and kashima jingu but are more remote . 
  i posted lots of links to help you out since there is n't much information about smaller towns , but i do n't know much about beaches if we 're being honest . 
  ise grand shrine , seconded by izumo-taisha , is said to be the most important shrine in japan . 
  i think you should consider going there if you have the chance to !, 
  there are also many other things you can do in ise https://www.virtualtourist.com/travel/asia/japan/mie_ken/ise-975932/things_to_do-ise-tg-c-1.html, 
  if you are still interested in going , matsusaka has some castle ruins as well as a few old residences ( in a nice historic area ) that used to be occupied by the guards of the castle .
