  experimental animals are virtually tortured to death without any thought to how the animals are treated . 
  animals do not willingly sacrifice themselves for people , it 's taken from them . 
  it 's not fair to pick and choose which lives we think are best and which ones are worth torture and death . 
  ! disagreewithop, 
   people are becoming more and more isolated , and it seems that this trend will only get worse . 
  there are inherent urges in human beings that are being suppressed , genuine human connection is becoming rarer . 
  this suppression will cause more and more mental health issues , which are also treated poorly in most countries . 
  are they really ? 
  people are n't becoming more isolated , they are becoming closer and closer together . 
  when you say they are becoming more isolated , i 'm guessing it 's because many people now spend a lot of time on their phones and online . 
  however , on their phones what [ most people are doing ] ( https://static.businessinsider.com/image/51ae25166bb3f7ea7900001f/image.jpg ) is either talking to other people , texting other people or using social networks to , well , communicate with other people . 
  while it may not be a physical one-on-one conversation , there is still communication . 
  the internet allows us to talk to , meet and become friends with people ** all over the world ** , it has made it easier for us to travel and get to know and understand other cultures , learn other languages , it allows us to learn and have access to knowledge we could n't know before , it allows us to stand up together against a cause and [ fundraising has improved a lot ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eq6z8og7f_q ) in the last years , it allows us to buy things from other places and choose what we want to support rather than having the limited options of the nearest stores , etc. 
  yes , the world is becoming more homogenous ( slowly ) . 
  many people in many countries do n't wear their country 's traditional dress every day anymore . 
  things that used to be part of daily life , celebrations that used to be special , and opinions that used to be truth are slowly disappearing . 
  but is that really a bad thing ? 
  in order for the world to become a better place , it 's necessary to let go of things from the past that perhaps were n't all that positive . 
   as we become isolated we gain an ` us and them ' mentality , pulling people away from each other . 
  a sense of community is also being lost here , with the potential of dehumanisation of large groups of other people . 
  culture is an `` exclusive club '' . 
  as you can probably see , there is a lot of noise these days about muslims `` not accepting american culture and so are n't welcome in the us '' . 
  dehumanisation , as you mentioned , has happened many times in the past when people 's cultures were strong and different , nationalism and a sense of `` other '' surge when two people have very different cultures . 
  japan 's imperialism and the nazis are perhaps the easiest examples . 
  to be nice to other people there is no need to make one big culture to join everyone together , the truth lies simply in understanding and accepting other cultures . 
  to put a more concrete example , let 's look at me . 
  i 'm spanish . 
  when people think of spanish culture , the first things that come to mind might be flamenco , architecture ( especially churches , but also stuff like gaud\u00ed ) , don quijote , paella . 
  but mostly bullfighting . 
  bullfighting is a disgusting , horrible custom , torture and killing of animals just for the fun of it . 
  people are becoming more and more against bullfighting and * thank god * it 's already banned where i live . 
  for the world to be a better place , culture sometimes has to change . 
  my `` community '' is n't necessarily the people i share a culture with . 
  it is n't the people in my class , the people i meet in the supermarket , the neighbours . 
  it is n't the ones who live in madrid simply because they live in the same country , it is n't the spanish people i meet abroad . 
  it 's the people i meet online that share my opinions , it 's the people i can talk to properly without fear of judgement , it 's those who share my tastes and watch the same movies and trust the same things . 
  i would n't have such a vast community if it were n't for globalisation and looking beyond `` my culture '' . 
   so with little or no new cultures to follow , what are we assimilating towards ? 
  culture is very much alive and striving . 
  i 've gone to google to find examples of how important culture still is today , i think [ this ] ( https://www.quora.com/how-can-i-fix-the-culture-difference-between-my-boyfriend-and-me ) is a fairly good example of culture differences in this day and age . 
  either way , you do n't really `` follow '' a culture . 
  a culture is your set of beliefs , your past , your way of thinking . 
  culture ca n't disappear as long as humans are alive . 
  culture is who we are and what we do . 
  * traditional * culture is disappearing , sure , because our thoughts are changing , but culture itself is simply here , evolving . 
  i do n't say i follow a spanish culture , i do n't feel like i follow a spanish culture , it is simply the culture i grew up in and who i am . 
  culture is n't like a religion or a political side to pick , culture just is , what we are and who we are , there 's no `` following '' it . 
   the way i picture it , ideally , there rises a culture that encompasses basic morals , assisting future generations , accepting basic human needs and feelings , and a greater sense of community along with the acceptance of strangers and openness to what you do n't know . 
  culture is based on history and mind , it is n't something that you can forcibly create . 
  it makes itself . 
  to `` accept basic human needs and feelings '' you do n't need a shared culture , you need empathy and understanding . 
  ** tl ; dr ** : the problems you state do n't really exist , so there is n't much of a solution needed . 
   these things are animals , not humans, 
  humans are animals . 
  there is n't as much as a difference between us as you like to believe . 
   inhumane treatment, 
  i would never use the word `` inhumane '' . 
  we all know that humans are very capable of doing cruel things ( such as animal experimentation ) , being brutal and mean does n't make people less human . 
   that if we have to use animals for the greater benefit of humanity then we should, 
  that 's the whole point of this topic : we do n't ** need to ** do animal testing . 
  there are plenty other ways already stated in other posts that do n't include torture . 
  the us could have the funds for it . 
  16 % of us tax money goes to the military ( that 's way too much , you could take a couple billion from there ) . 
  well , different pages say different things , 16 % is the * lowest * i 've found , other places say up to 54 % . 
  most pages agree that education only gets a 3 % . 
  finland , considered one of the countries with the best education system , has an 8 % . 
  there is n't * that * much of a difference between the fundings , it 's simply the way of teaching that changes . 
  you do n't really need extra funds for competent and enthusiastic teachers , that requires a change of attitude . 
  getting rid of those who are n't good teachers . 
  it 's up to them to make the class interesting , you do n't pay them more for it . 
  more like [ 52.3 % ] ( https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0006032 ) of the time . 
  you 're overestimating how many people in the world speak english , let alone use it regularly and choose to speak it online . 
  english is the language taught most often at secondary schools in the eu with over 93 % of kids learning english ( yes , that includes countries that do n't have it as a first language and speak totally different languages ) . 
  french is taught in all eu countries apart from slovenia and german is also common . 
  french and german in many cases are optional though , english is mostly mandatory ( i do n't know of any cases where english is n't mandatory in the eu ) . 
  i personally speak english , catalan and spanish very fluently , enough french to get around and i 've started japanese , thinking about starting moroccan too . 
  i do think english is a language that many people should learn , not because it 's a `` superior language '' ( it 's obviously not ) but because it 's the second most spoken language in the world and often used in scientific and medical fields , interviews and public speakings in professional and political environments and other general areas . 
  knowing how to speak english is a * tremendous * advantage in the world . 
  if you do n't speak english you are limited in the amount of countries you can go to and the jobs / people you 'll speak to . 
  i work as a travel consultant and trip-planning for spanish speakers going to japan , every time one of them says they ca n't speak english i sigh inside because it makes travelling so much more difficult and leaves out so many experiences , unless they have the money to pay for a translator or guide whenever needed . 
  i do think knowing to speak at least two languages is very helpful , so i would say that learning a foreign language in us school should be mandatory and starting from a young age . 
  i actually did n't know that * was n't * the case . 
  there are many studies done to show the benefits of learning a second language , i 'm not going to get into it because it 's a very quick google search , but it 's also going to improve your * own * language ( grammar , conjugations , sentence structure , becoming aware of how you speak ... ) . 
   it does n't matter which language it is , but the student has to stick with the same one until they 're proficient . 
  students should n't be able to pick freely . 
  if so , i would 've chosen to speak mauri when i was a kid , and that would 've been basically useless for the future . 
  i think it would be good to speak spanish , that 's the third most spoken language as well as there being many latino people in the us and close to many spanish-speaking countries , or another language that has logical reasons ( for example , learning russian has gotten popular in the last years here in spain since tourism from russians has increased ) . 
  learning a language from a young age in school is very easy . 
   english would still take priority . 
  i think learning your own language is different to learning a foreign language , and the classes are taught ( or should be taught ) in very different ways . 
  for example , in spanish classes we learnt how to write the spelling of a sound using phonology , detailed grammar , sintaxis ( we have lots of fun stuff like the complementos de r\u00e9gimen , complementos circunstanciales , compost verbs , eluded pronouns and subjects , etc. 
  ) , what nouns , adjectives , adverbs , propositions are , etc. 
  it gets very complicated . 
  in your own language class you 're also going to be reading harder books , like we read the don quijote , lazarillo de tormes , la celestina , etc. 
  ( we had to read at least three a year ) that someone who does n't speak spanish as a first language would have a hard time reading at high school age . 
  we also added in a bit of history of the language . 
  when learning a foreign language you first have to know words , the alphabet if it 's different , and speaking / understanding . 
  it 's a different approach . 
  so i had the `` three languages '' classes ( catalan , spanish , english ) and treated them equally because the classes were so significantly different . 
  it 's like maths and biology ; they are different but no less important .
