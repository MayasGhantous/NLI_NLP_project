  you 're learning them for different reasons , none is a priority , they just * are * . 
  you 're going to have to do your homework for all of them anyway . 
  i have never heard of a difference between ` culture ' and ` culture ' and i 'm tempted to say it does n't exist because capital letters depend on sentence structure and grammar rather than meaning of a word . 
  do you have a source ? 
  [ e.b. 
  tylor defines culture ] ( https://archive.org/details/primitiveculture01tylouoft ) as `` all the knowledge , beliefs , art , morals , laws , customs , etc. 
  acquired as a member of society '' . 
  this is the definition i was taught in school , have always heard and read about . 
  sure there might be different sides of a culture , like the beliefs on one end , customs on another , but they both still belong to the culture of a group . 
  if i understand correctly , you 're saying that when multiple cultures exist and mix , the people of the different cultures become more homogenous in their moral and belief system , but not their customs . 
  correct ? 
  that 's because italian and indonesian are n't languages that are used that often ; unless you go to italy or indonesia it 's unlikely you 're going to use it . 
  specifically , italian is the 23rd language with most native speakers and malay ( includes malaysian and indonesian ) is the 14th . 
  it would be more useful to study a language that the students are possibly going to use in a future , such as spanish ( the 3rd ) . 
  there are many positive things about learning a language :, 
  - it makes a person more flexible and open to other cultures , as well as being more likeable if you speak in someone 's language rather than expecting them to know english . 
  - more career opportunities . 
  - the first language is improved because you stop and realise how you talk and how languages are built . 
  - many physical benefits like improving the ability to multi-task , memory skills , improved decision-making abilities , etc. 
  - performance in other academic areas is enhanced . 
  - it prevents or delays alzeihmer 's disease and dementia ( [ no , seriously ] ( http://www.neurology.org/content/early/2013/11/06/01.wnl.0000436620.33155.a4 ) ) . 
  if schools started teaching a foreign language from primary school , it would be very easy to learn it . 
  ah , i was thinking this was strange since i live in bcn and hardly ever have any problems . 
  but going out at night is a different story , of course , i never go out at night alone . 
  sorry this happened to you !, 
  true , i 'm from catalonia . 
  never seen it . 
  bullfighting ? 
  strongly against it . 
  i learnt the sardana in school though and used to go dance with my grandma in the park sometimes on weekends , castellers might be my favourite aspect of catalan culture ( very exciting ! ), 
  and correfocs are a very big thing , especially in summer . 
  ah , that reminds me of [ a comic ] ( http://img-9gag-fun.9cache.com/photo/ao2doxx_700b.jpg ) i saw the other day !, 
  it 's probably lucky there are n't that many tourists at the correfoc , i can already imagine the accidents . 
  i think the castellers are registered as an unesco intangible heritage though !, 
  there are also youtube channels that film the ambience of a place quiet well and will allow you to see how the different cities are :, 
  i 've pm 'd you , i hope my tacky `` emo poetry '' works !, 
   i was just saying i refuse to flat-out lie to myself and pretend this 6 ' 3 '' guy in a dress is `` female '' just because they want me to . 
  no , they are n't female , they were born male . 
  nobody is asking you to `` believe '' they are female , because they are n't . 
  however , they are still * women * , mentally , so why would n't you treat them as such ? 
  male body , female mind . 
  them looking like a man or a woman does n't change their gender identity . 
   this is usually the kind of outraged transpeople who have a problem with the pronouns thing ( the sjw 's ) . 
  no , most trans people have `` a thing '' with pronouns , we 're talking about trans people so bringing sjws up has nothing to do with the conversation . 
  i 'm guessing you are a guy . 
  a cis guy ; born male , feel male . 
  if everyone around you called you a `` she '' , * constantly * , all the time , simply because they do n't think you look `` manly enough '' ... would n't that bother you ? 
  trans women are women and deserve to be treated as women . 
  whether they look male or pass should n't dictate the amount of respect you give them . 
  it 's just a pronoun . 
  why is it hard to call someone a she if that 's what they want to be called ? 
  if i were to say `` hey , my name is alice '' and you said `` hi , cool , but i 'm going to call you gemma '' ... you 're being rude . 
  basically , what you 're saying is `` i do n't care about your ` preferred pronouns ' , i 'll simply call you what you are '' . 
  however , ** you are n't calling them what they are ** . 
  a trans woman is a woman , regardless of what she looks like . 
  you are basing your choice of language on stereotypical body image rather than what and who a person is . 
  when talking to someone you are n't talking to their genitals , so why make direct reference to that when talking to them ? 
  you 're talking to someone because they have a mind , so understand that they are mentally female and talk to them as female . 
  you say you do n't mind trans people , that you have nothing against them , but the thing is you do n't fully accept trans people because you 're negating the entire thing that makes them trans : ** a trans woman is a woman ** . 
  if you do n't agree with that , the problem is n't pronouns , it 's understanding what being trans means .

   feminists within the western world complain that womens rights are being taken away , they 're slaves to the male ( otherwise known as the patriarchy ) , and it 's completely miserable to be a woman . 
  i am a feminist , i also live in the `` western world '' , so i think you 're talking about me . 
  i think we need to both understand and have the same definition of what being a feminist means , that is , someone who wishes for equality of genders . 
  nothing more , nothing less . 
  there are many `` types '' of feminists , including radical feminists , conservative feminists , religious feminists , sjws , etc. 
  saying `` feminists '' as a whole when talking about one single group of feminists is a big generalisation . 
  i am a feminist but i do not think women 's rights are being taken away , i believe that women 's rights have gotten * a lot * better but there are still steps to go . 
  i do n't think women are `` slaves to the male '' ( ? 
  ) , the `` patriarchy '' points out a model of life where the man was the center of the family and held most positions of power . 
  i also think this is changing and is getting much much better , but not fully there yet . 
  for example , only [ 5.4 % of ceo positions ] ( http://www.catalyst.org/knowledge/women-ceos-sp-500 ) at s&p 500 companies belong to women , i.e , the workplace is still majority men ( of course it depends on the field and country , but there are fewer fields that are mostly female that do n't have to do with the traditional female values ) . 
  women are also still expected to do most of the housework . 
  it 's changing , yes , and men do participate , but generally women still do more at home . 
  i also do not think it 's completely miserable to be a woman ... 
   radical feminists have tried to shove the idea that the wage gap is a very real thing, 
  that is n't really something that can be considered an opinion , it 's not something to believe or not believe as if it were faith . 
  you can go [ look at the stats ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gender_pay_gap_in_the_united_states#by_state ) and read about the topic , the wikipedia page links to many sites at the bottom of the page to back up any claims of truth or false . 
  but this was a topic posted the other day in the subreddit and we wo n't get into it again . 
  either way , radical feminists are not the general mainstream feminists , nor a representation of third wave feminism . 
  radicals exist in just about every group of ideologies . 
  are their radical feminists ? 
  yes , of course . 
  are all feminists radical ? 
  definitely not . 
   third wave western feminism does n't have a clear goal . 
  third-wave feminism is basically any feminism from the 1990s onwards . 
  third-wave feminism is actually an attempt to include women of other colours , ethnicities , nationalities and religions , since the first and second `` waves '' were much more centric on the white-woman . 
  many different topics are talked about , there is no one topic to rule them all , but that does n't have to be a bad thing . 
  as you yourself has said , the `` western world '' is a good place to be a woman , so there are less blatant sex differences as there were when women were fighting to vote . 
  there are many feminists all over the world , many more than there were in the past , so i 'm sure we can all manage to deal with many different topics . 
  the problems you mention ( i.e. 
  woman 's rights in other less fortunate countries ) * is * a big topic and often talked about . 
  this is something that did n't happen at all in first and second wave feminism . 
  feminism has gotten much better at being inclusive to woman all over the world . 
  you praise first and second wave feminism , yet then criticise third wave feminism for something that the first two did n't do either . 
   it seems that they point fingers to other people for their problems instead of attempting to fix real problems, 
  `` real problems '' are any problems that exist . 
  it does n't have to be huge to change someone 's life for the better . 
  even so , third wave feminists have accomplished many great things such as :,
