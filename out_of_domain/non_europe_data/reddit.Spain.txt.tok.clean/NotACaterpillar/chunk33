  - marital rape declared illegal in the uk, 
  - married couples ( at least in the us ) are now allowed to choose whose last name they prefer on their marriage and driving licenses ( i.e. , women do n't have to talk the husband 's last name ) . 
  - the `` slut-walks '' in protest against the idea that it 's a victim 's fault if she/he 's raped because the rapist deemed she/he was `` asking for it '' with the way they was dressed . 
  - the first woman to bring a gender discrimination lawsuit in china wins !, 
  muslim women do n't live in a separate dimension , there are many that live in the `` western world '' . 
  here in spain for example , where i live , we have many many moroccans . 
  when talking about muslim 's women 's rights it is n't `` pointing fingers '' at people and other countries as outsiders , it 's talking about the rights of the girls that sat next to me in class , it 's talking about the neighbours and my ex and some of my friends . 
  i personally , as do many other feminists , do n't think that us non-muslim white women can comment much on hijabs . 
  this is something that muslim women must choose for themselves and it 's a change of heart that they must have . 
  many women choose to wear a hijab without any pressure from their male muslim relatives , and that 's great and i respect that . 
  many also choose to not wear one and if they need my help to be able to do so , then i will gladly help them . 
  but it 's not my place to tell them what to do . 
  other topics not related to hijabs ( women not being able to drive , lack of basic education , and yes , their wage gap ) are things that i will fight for , not as a blame to muslim culture but as a help to those women . 
   instead , they focus on things such as the `` wage gap '' and `` empowering women '' . 
  again , another big generalization . 
  i always cringe slightly when i see things such as the vogue feminist rally last year . 
  when i talk to my `` feminist friends '' online , we never talk about any wage gap or `` empowering women '' . 
  actually , myself and others believe that there is n't much in saying `` girl power ! '' , because that does n't actually change anything , not even people 's mentality . 
  they are phrases that people have heard time and time again and have lost most of their meaning . 
  having someone say `` you go girl ! '' is n't going to help me dump an abusive boyfriend . 
  i usually focus more on trans women 's rights , rape and understanding consent , as well as knowing that each person has a right to withdraw consent at any time . 
  it 's hard to draw a line on what exactly consists of feminism and what are simply social issues because the same feminists also talk a lot about mental health issues , racism , disabilities and sex-positivity . 
   maybe the western world is not that bad for women ? 
  it 's not . 
  it 's better than it ever was before and it 's only an accumulation of small details that make things difficult for women `` in the western world '' ( although it does depend a lot on which country we are talking about , as not each country in the western world is the same ) . 
  feminism is n't really going to cease to exist , because feminism is equality . 
  the topics change , things get better and it may seem less important to talk about `` feminism '' , but things still are n't 100 % perfect and so it will continue to stick around . 
  until it * is * 100 % perfect all over the world , i see no problem with feminism existing . 
  i do n't think i should be arguing about trans issues with someone called `` trannyporno '' . 
  you do n't need a jr pass for tokyo . 
  you need one for going to kyoto/osaka and back , and if you have any spear days then sure , use them in tokyo , but buying one of 14 days rather than one of 7 days will be a huge waste of money . 
  jr passes pay off when doing ** long distance shinkansen travel ** . 
  in tokyo you will neither be doing long distance nor using the shinkansen . 
  as for my opinions :, 
  - odawara and hakone : there is * so * much to do around here that it seems like a bit of a pity to try and do both in one day ( with one day you would n't even manage to do all there is in hakone ! ) . 
  i would at least give it a couple days or rule it out , there is no need to rush or just brush the surface of what there is to see . 
  also , out of all options , i would personally not pick this one simply because there is little that makes me say `` wow ! '' . 
  - kamakura : great place , i would pick this one . 
  it used to be the capital of japan as well as base of minamoto yoritomo , one of the shoguns . 
  so , as you can imagine , it 's pretty important historically speaking and it 's common to see field trips of school kids . 
  this would mean that it gets crowded both on weekdays and weekends , this can have an impact on how much you like the place . 
  however , i started early before too many visitors arrived and so really liked the walk as well as a few of the less-packed shrines and temples . 
  [ here 's my tr ] ( https://tokyoanecdote.wordpress.com/2016/02/27/daibutsu-hiking-trail-kamakura/ ) . 
  - yokohama : i personally find it pretty boring but there are many others ( especially on this sub for some reason ) who really like it . 
  either way , it can easily be done in the same day you visit kamakura since it 's along the way so it wo n't be a problem to find time for it . 
  - nikko : another great place with more important history . 
  it 's the tomb of tokugawa ieyasu , another shogun ( though more important than yoritomo ) , with also many school kids . 
  the entrance fees are steep but arguably very worth it since the shrines are beautiful . 
  plus , you can also see the lush green forests of japan . 
  i often feel the same way and it 's very hard to see beyond the present . 
  but in the big picture of your life , these events wo n't really matter much . 
  when i was 11 the teacher wrote a note to my parents saying i 'd misbehaved in class and i cried for hours , i thought that it would have serious consequences , both on my curriculum and on the way my parents loved me and treated me . 
  but it did n't matter and now , many years later , it does n't matter at all . 
  that 's not to say that you should do whatever you want whenever you want , but if you start feeling like life is n't worth it try to understand the bigger picture . 
  btw , about if life is worth living : even when you think it is n't , your family will be absolutely devastated and wrecked . 
  people i love are dead and it really really hurts . 
  please do n't put your family through that because of a decision done at a moment of weakness . 
  i agree that there is much talk about trans issues ( i ca n't remember any recent topic specifically talking about homosexuality though ) and it 's getting tiring to see them . 
  not because of the reasons you state , but simply because the amount of transphobia in this subreddit is discouraging . 
   why are we not speaking about things that have a far greater impact to a larger number of the average population as a whole . 
  there is n't really any rule in the subreddit that says we have to talk about `` important topics '' or topics that affect only a certain type of person . 
  the thing is , when someone makes a post about something , it usually gets people thinking and for the next few days similar topics will also be posted because the initial discussion did n't cover that particular opinion . 
  there have also recently been posts about pedophiles and animal rights , simply because many thoughts about it are n't directly related to the op 's statement . 
   why does n't a post testing their belief that the american congress allowing the rail road industry to be given 5 extra years to comply with new safety requirements within the us government sanctioned murder ? 
  i do believe that trans rights is more important than this , simply because transgenderism is a worldwide issue while the us railroad laws are limited to , well , the us . 
  needless to say that many more people each year are [ murdered of trans hate crimes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_unlawfully_killed_transgender_people ) ( and that list is only those that have been reported and ruled as such and often does n't include non-western countries , so there are many more crimes that are n't listed ) and `` only '' [ 81 fatalities ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_american_railroad_accidents#21st_century ) are related to rail accidents in the us since the year 2000 . 
  obviously 81 is a lot , but as a comparison it 's clear which issue of the two has the most negative consequences . 
  but feel free to make your own post with your own beliefs on this topic !, 
  ps : have you been frequenting r/cmv ? 
  because there are many more topics about trans people there and if you visit both it can seem like that 's all people talk about . 
  if someone ca n't see beyond radical feminism , is that really fault of the feminists , or is that simply that person 's lack of knowing all sides of the movement ? 
  if someone thinks muslims are all radical terrorists , they 're racist . 
  if someone thinks all liberals are anti-religion and hate anything related to tradition , they do n't look beyond the stereotypes . 
  if someone thinks all spanish people are in favour of bull-fighting , then it 's ignorance . 
  the people who think all feminism is radical do n't have a large understanding about the movement and its history , the idea that feminism is anti-men is n't new , but it 's false . 
  of course there are stereotypes but that should n't ( and does n't ) define the whole scope of the thing . 
  feminism is and has always meant `` equal rights between genders '' . 
  because some radicals take this out of context does n't mean that the whole movement should change its name and definition . 
  i obviously disagree with the quotes you 've mentioned , but misandry is n't feminism , that 's prejudice and hate pretending to be feminism . 
  egalitarian is a term that includes equality of everyone regardless of status , race , religion , sexual orientation , etc. 
  it does n't put a spotlight on gender issues , so when talking about equality of genders , one is not necessarily talking at the same time of equality of anything else . 
  someone who believes men and women are equal may not necessarily be an egalitarian on other issues . 
  for example , if i 'm talking about thailand , i 'd say thailand , i would n't say `` southeast asia '' because that 's too broad . 
  egalitarian is a broad term , feminism is like a subgroup of that . 
  the quotes go both ways , of course :, 
  `` you do n't have to be anti-man to be pro-woman . '' - jane galvin lewis, 
  `` i do not wish women to have power over men , but over themselves . '' - mary wollstonecraft, 
  `` true equality is not the superiority of women , but the equal statues of man and woman . '' - mercedes joubert, 
  `` we do n't often talk about men being imprisoned by gender stereotypes ... but i can see that they are , and that when they are free , things will change for women as a natural consequence '' - emma watson, 
  `` the enemy of feminism is n't men . 
  it 's patriarchy , and patriarchy is not men . '' - justine musk, 
  will this still be up tomorrow ? 
  i do n't really have the time for it now but i can find time later ... 
  what helps me is to know that wearing one thing or another does n't make me less of a guy/girl . 
  a guy in a bikini is n't a guy wearing girl 's clothing : since it 's the guy 's clothing and the guy is a guy , it 's a guy wearing guy 's clothing . 
  when i understood this i was able to wear whatever i wanted without having an identity crisis every time i went to the beach . 
  sometimes i wear bikinis , sometimes i wear [ those short `` surfer '' togs ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/dd/8e/71/dd8e719717654a9a096362853f28d938.jpg ) ( the longer ones are a bit uncomfortable ) , sometimes i go with [ the shirt ] ( http://g02.a.alicdn.com/kf/htb1jmqyipxxxxamxfxxq6xxfxxxm/sbart-rash-guard-men-short-sleeve-2015-uv-protection-upf50-windsurf-surf-rashguard-swim-shirts-lycra.jpg ) as well . 
  i usually prefer the [ simple togs ] ( http://www.togsswimwear.com/images/product/medium/1349.jpg ) . 
  i agree !, 
  perhaps the most inclusive survey in regards to gender identity i 've ever done , in fact .
