  miyajima and hiroshima * could * be doable in one day if you rush a lot and only see the most famous sites . 
  you would definitely not have time to go up mt.misen and in hiroshima you 'd only be able to see the peace museum , a * very * quick passing through of the peace park , plus a quick stop for lunch somewhere ( okonomiyaki is the speciality ) . 
  adding okayama on top of that is a straight out no-can-do . 
  i would highly recommend staying the night in hiroshima . 
  i do n't really know what recommendations you 're looking for as to what to do in hiroshima since you wo n't have time for anything beyond the peace museum + park . 
  yes , the shinkansen ride is 105 minutes if you take the 07:20 am one . 
  as you can see further down on that page , some shinkansen rides take up to 140 minutes , so it depends on which train you take . 
  however , this only includes the shinkansen time from kyoto to hiroshima . 
  you must add on the time it would take for you to go from your hotel to kyoto station , from hiroshima station to the peace park ( 20 minutes ) , from the peace park back to the station , from hiroshima station to miyajima station ( 40min ) , the ferry to miyajima ( 10 min ) , the ferry back to mainland , the train back to hiroshima station and finally all the way back to kyoto on the shinkansen . 
  it 's also likely that the trains and ferry are n't waiting for your arrival so you 'd probably have to wait for the next train , bus or ferry at some point . 
  and of course all temples close at 5pm , as do museums ( that includes of course the garden and castle in okayama ) . 
  from someone who is not an american : what exactly is a medical exemption from the army and why does this matter ? 
  op : you must give your own reasons for why you want to join the army for us to be able to debate it , you are n't giving any information about your resoning or what led you to this decision . 
  you are not stating any belief , you are only saying what you 're going to do . 
  in that case you simlpy do n't accept transgenderism as a whole , there 's no point debating pronouns if you disagree with being trans in the first place . 
  by the way , unless you are an israeli citizen apparently there are only [ a few short-term volunteer programs ] ( https://www.idfblog.com/about-the-idf/volunteer-programs/ ) available . 
  for the mahal and marva programs you must be a jew or descendant or at least have a close link to israel . 
  the sar-el program is slightly more open but you have to be eligible for israeli citizenship ( if you are , then you already have access to other programs as well ) . 
  if you are not a jew , the easiest way to get an israeli citizenship is by marrying an israeli citizen or living there for three years . 
  ! disagreewithop, 
   i do n't necessarily think that molestation/rape is inherently damaging . 
  rape is any form of sexual penetration without that person 's consent . 
  nudity does n't have * that * much of a relation to rape ( or sex in general ) because nudity does n't have to be sexual in nature . 
  sex , and by default rape , do . 
  a child is not necessarily damaged by nudity , no , but that is n't related to rape . 
  someone not wanting to have sex can be for so many reason , not all stemming from taboo . 
  ** even if they * were * stemmed from taboo , that does n't make these reasons less valid ** . 
  you can not want to have sex with someone because you do n't like that gender , because you have more important things to do , because it 's scary , because it hurts , because you do n't want that person to touch you , you do n't want to be touched there because it feels weird / uncomfortable / too sensitive , etc. 
   i think that it 's the factors which surround the vast majority of molestations/rapes which cause it to be a damaging event/experience . 
  the factors surrounding rape are also `` part of the experience '' . 
  we ca n't talk about rape as if it were in a universe where no circumstances surrounding it exist . 
  they do exist . 
  rape would n't even make sense if there were no circumstances or factors surrounding it because consent in itself is also a circumstance to begin with . 
  lack of consent , other than saying no on the grounds of not wanting to do it , also includes a person who is n't capable of giving said consent . 
  a child ca n't give consent , a drunk person ca n't give consent . 
  this is because a child may not understand the consequences of having sex , they may not be in a position to withdraw consent , they may be worried about dad telling them off if they do n't . 
  rape in itself is not okay because it is giving harm to someone who does not consent , whether that be physical harm , mental harm in the aftermath or indirect / potential harm to an individual who is not prepared to properly give consent . 
  consent is valuable , it 's * a right * , it should n't be taken away from someone . 
  rape is taking consent away from someone . 
   if a stranger tells you to drop your pants so they can cup your balls , that might freak you out if you 're on the bus , but if you 're in a doctors office for a physical it 's entirely untraumatic . 
  no , if a doctor told me to drop my pants so he can touch me , even if it 's for medical reasons , i would be very uncomfortable and would consider not doing so , possibly changing doctor . 
  he has to ask me to do so , i have no obligation and it should n't be an order . 
  it 's not lack of consent of he asks and i 'm still in a situation where i can say no with no great negative consequences . 
   imagine a `` bad '' rape versus a `` really bad '' rape, 
  there is no need to make such a difference or compare who has it worse , a bad rape and a very bad rape are both bad and that 's it . 
  if a victim compares their situation to someone else 's , it 's easy to descend into the `` mine was n't bad enough , i should n't be complaining '' , `` others have it worse so i do n't deserve to feel that bad '' , `` it was n't * that * bad since s/he did n't do x or y '' . 
  it 's very easy for victims to blame themselves so we need to get rid of the comparing experiences and making some seem `` not bad enough '' . 
   drunk people who are unable to consent can have fantastic sex , and not be harmed , and that 's still rape . 
  happens all the time . 
   a rape that does n't seem `` bad '' or `` traumatic '', 
   if it makes it easier , try considering good/bad drunken sex ( statutory rape ) scenarios before trying to imagine `` good '' kidfucking scenarios and having your mind immediately shut the idea out . 
  i am . 
  i 'm not imagining terrible scenarios , i 'm imagining young kids that do what their dad says because `` they grew up that way '' and used to it and i 'm imagining two stupid teens out at a party . 
  those are the two examples i based my text off . 
  note that i said `` rape in itself is not okay because it is giving harm to someone who does not consent , whether that be physical harm , mental harm in the aftermath or indirect / ** potential harm ** to an individual who is not prepared to properly give consent . '', 
  if it 's two 20 year olds out having a nice time , they go back to her place and do the woo-hoo , i 'm sure they can have a great time . 
  does this mean that there is no * potential harm * ? 
  maybe they 'll forget the condom , maybe one forgot to mention that they are n't entirely clean / the one does n't ask the other if they 're clean and they have n't been tested , maybe one will trip , bump their head and the other one wo n't be able to react properly in time , perhaps one falls unconscious half way through , it could be that one feels uncomfortable but does n't have enough energy / enough fully functioning brain cells to halt the thing . 
  just because it * can * be good , does n't mean the thing in itself is good . 
  i was advised by teachers , as were the rest of people at my school , and by family / friends to choose based on the exits and job offers at the end . 
  ranking was one of the reasons why i chose my uni over others . 
  the `` of course you have to like what you do '' was always tacked on at the end , but most people who are going to university are going because they want to get a job at the end of it . 
  it 's hard for me to believe that someone would consider choosing one school or another based on the weather ... unless they really detest snow with all their being or something . 
  i guess here in spain `` college life '' is n't much of a thing though . 
  very few people sleep in dorms ( unless it 's a * very * large uni there are n't any dorms , i actually only know one uni that does and even then it 's really used by exchange students and those who live 3 + hours away ) and so any `` college experience '' is settled outside of school grounds . 
   have you never had a physical before ? 
  i have , many times , and i have never been ordered to take my pants off . 
  they 've asked me to ( `` if you could please take your pants off '' ) , and i 've always been able to say no without being in any danger . 
  a stranger telling me suddenly to pull my pants down is n't a safe situation , there is no consent if i 'm being coerced , forced or feel in any way that i have to . 
  they are two examples , one with consent , one with no consent . 
  it 's not an example based of taboo , it 's an example based on safety . 
   this absolutely is a reason to consider what traumatizes people and what does n't ,, 
  yes , but when you say `` bad '' and `` very bad '' , we are already ranking two examples that traumatise people , otherwise it would n't be classified as `` bad '' . 
  i know not all rapes are equal and i 'm not saying we should n't compare * at all * , but this post is n't about the `` bad '' examples , you 've said so yourself , so there is no need to talk about them here . 
   implies there 's a potential for there to not be harm . 
  sure . 
  the thing is , when there is potential to harm existing , even if it exists at the same time as the potential to no harm , that does n't make it any safer or any less potentially harmful . 
  for example , there 's an accident in the cookie factory and some cookies came out poisonous ( i do n't know what accident must 've occurred for that to happen , but it 's an example ) . 
  they did n't realise this until later and there were already cookie packets being sold . 
  they withdraw them from the stores but , well , you 've already bought a packet and have n't heard about the cookie-poisoning incident . 
  some of the cookies you 'd be eating * might * be poisonous ... it may be that there were n't any poisonous ones in the end , but that does n't make it less dangerous to eat them . 
  ** the potential of safety and the potential of harm are both there ** , so eating the cookies is a bad idea because it 's already potentially harmful . 
  you ca n't know the outcome until it 's too late . 
   i 've talked to them and they show little to no sign of caring about `` freedom of gender '' , or whatever you specify it as . 
  there is no one way to behave , i 've met very conservative non-binaries , religious ones , plenty with oposing ideas on different topics , they dress differently among themselves ( most look entirely `` normal '' ) . 
  would you think that all men ( or women ) care about the same topics ? 
  even if they did have a particular opinion , why would they have to tell it to you or say it out loud anyway ? 
  statistically speaking , rape is often proved harmful , so in this case it would make sense to take potential harm as something that can be a very real possibility . 
  i know you are n't talking about legalising it , you state that clearly in your original post . 
  and no , i do not agree that it is n't inherently harmful , because an act of rape is n't rape without circumstance . 
  rape in itself does n't exist because it only depends on outward factors ( such as consent ) . 
  japan is n't expensive if you know how to travel well . 
  it 's easy to waste money buying stuff if you 're not careful , but i 've easily travelled with half of what you have ( accomodation and transport included ) , so it should n't be a problem even if you splurge on food . 
  [ last year ] ( http://www.kanko-sekigahara.jp/event/kassen2016/index.html ) it was on october 15-16th , so i would assume it 's around the same dates this year . 
  even if you do n't manage to go there during the festival , the city has many historic spots as well as a couple interesting museums . 
  you could also visit the [ sekigahara warland ] ( https://www.google.es/search?q=%e9%96%a2%e3%83%b6%e5%8e%9f%e3%82%a6%e3%82%a9%e3%83%bc%e3%83%a9%e3%83%b3%e3%83%89&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewix3p7d1a3sahxdvxqkhxfdb0sq_auiccgb&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=589 ) there , which would be the closest thing to the festival , a park full of statues . 
  catalan here , can confirm there is no hate . 
  the only person i 've heard say something against other spanish people themselves ( rather than politics ) is my grandpa , but then he somehow manages to say something offensive about every group so it 's not really personal . 
  sekigahara is mostly enjoyable if you know about the history ; who did what , who each of the important samurai clans were , the relations between them and where the individual fights took place . 
  this takes a lot of studying , of course , but it 's all related so it gets easier once you already know a few names and stories .
