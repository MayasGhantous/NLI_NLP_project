  you can probably pick up an english pamphlet at the station or at one of the museums if not . 
  note that sekigahara is n't really a popular tourist spot for foreign visitors since most people aer n't that interested in japanese history , so it is n't really adapted to english speakers . 
  what i 'd recommend is renting a bike at the station , visiting the museums first and then visiting all the memorials and other sites with whatever time you have left . 
  by the way , the station has [ some really cool lockers ] ( https://img1-kakaku.ssl.k-img.com/images/maga/icv/pc640/4336/img43.jpg?d=201607260915 ) . 
  - [ folk history museum ] ( http://www.rekimin-sekigahara.jp/english/index.html ) ( \u95a2\u30b1\u539f\u753a\u6b74\u53f2\u6c11\u4fd7\u8cc7\u6599\u9928 ) : maps , armours , swords , explanations and general information about the battle ( gift shop included if you want to buy souvenirs ) . 
  it 's mostly just for japanese-speakers but most of the displays speak for themselves anyway . 
  ** 350 yen ** . 
  you can also dress up as a samurai there and take some photos along with the statues . 
  ** 500 yen ** , samurai outfit fitting not included . 
  - [ field camp ground ] ( http://www2.kanko-sekigahara.jp/_common/themes/image/historicsites-sekigahara/014-1.jpg ) ( \u5fb3\u5ddd\u5bb6\u5eb7\u6700\u5f8c\u9663\u8de1 ) . 
  just across the road from the folk museum , this is the spot where tokugawa ieyasu held a council meeting after the end of the battle and was presented with the decapitated heads of the enemy 's leaders . 
  a small shrine marks the spot . 
  it can also be interesting to [ read about how the heads were presented ] ( https://books.google.es/books?id=drobav-dq9ic&amp;pg=pa155&amp;lpg=pa155&amp;dq=neck+make-up+japan+-geisha+battle&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ihqrkcodwa&amp;sig=ai0slbcgit6bvdpwhklctgmyc2g&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewiuk5ae6pzrahxb6xqkhw_0cfkq6aeiljad#v=onepage&amp;q=neck%20make-up%20japan%20-geisha%20battle&amp;f=false ) , especially customs such as neck make-up . 
  - [ camp of ishida mitsunari ] ( https://www.sekigahara-battle.com/visiting-battlefields/western-army/%e2%9d%b6mitsunari-ishida-s-camp-site-mt-sasao/ ) ( \u7b39\u5c3e\u5c71 \u77f3\u7530\u4e09\u6210\u9663\u8de1 ) : between both museums , this was the main base of the western army . 
  it 's one of the best memorials to visit since they 've put up some fences and stuff that make it easier to imagine how it would 've looked like . 
  - camp of ii naomasa and matsudaira tadayoshi ( \u677e\u5e73\u5fe0\u5409 \u30fb \u4e95\u4f0a\u76f4\u653f\u9663\u8de1 ) : ii naomasa was also a very important figure of the eastern side , his troops were the ones to draw the `` first blood '' of the battle . 
  it 's very easy to spot naomasa 's men in paintings and pictures because they all dressed in red armour ( he stole that idea from [ one of shingen 's generals ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yamagata_masakage ) ) and his unit became known as the `` red devils '' . 
  - nagamasa kuroda and shigekado takenaka 's camp site ( \u7af9\u4e2d\u9663\u8de1 , next to kitano shrine ) : these two fellows were n't really that important , but they had a very good located and very scenic camp and they have an interesting story anyway . 
  there 's a small bamboo forest nearby . 
  - burial mounds : there are two important burial mounds in sekigahara , one for those who fought for the eastern side and one for the western side . 
  the eastern side one is right next to ii naomasa 's camp and there 's also a well there used to wash the heads before presenting them to tokugawa . 
  the western side one is `` prettier '' however , there 's a really nice big tree ( 35.36067 , 136.46487 ) . 
  - [ an old residence-museum ] ( http://www2.kanko-sekigahara.jp/_common/themes/image/spot/006-1.jpg ) ( \u6e05\u98a8\u5eb5 \u304f\u308a\u305f ) : it 's really just a small house with a few paintings , but you 'll probably be passing by in front of it to get to other memorials and it 's free to enter . 
  - [ ruins of takenaka shigekado 's residence ] ( http://www.jcastle.info/castle/profile/263-takenaka-jinya ) ( \u7af9\u4e2d\u6c0f\u9663\u5c4b\u8de1 ) : used to be a fortified residence that looks a bit like a castle . 
  worth a visit if you really like castles , otherwise it 's a bit far away and tehre is n't much left . 
  - other memorials include the camps of tanaka yoshimasa ( location 35.36519 , 136.46571 on google maps ) , takatora todo and takatomo kyogoku ( 35.35946 , 136.46435 ) , a monument to shimazu toyohisa ( \u5cf6\u6d25\u8c4a\u4e45\u7891 ) , etc. 
  i have n't gotten down to tracking down the others ... sorry . 
  websites worth checking out for further information : [ sekigahara official tourism page ] ( http://www.kanko-sekigahara.jp/en/index.html#other ) ( english ) , [ official one in japanese ] ( http://www2.kanko-sekigahara.jp/ ) ( has much more information plus a map at the bottom of each particular site that shows where each place is ) , a [ history website ] ( https://www.sekigahara-battle.com/visiting-battlefields/ ) done by a fan in english ( it 's probably the best resource you 'll find with so much information about the camps and each leader 's roles in the battle , reading wikipedia often does n't put so much detail into their role at sekigahara particularly ) . 
  unrelated to the sekigahara battle , there is also tokiwa gozen 's tomb nearby ( \u5e38\u76e4\u5fa1\u524d\u306e\u5893 , the mother of yoshitsune ) . 
  - honestly , the worst thing was money . 
  japan is n't expensive , but moving around of course costs money , as does paying for a place to sleep , eating , etc. 
  since i 'm always on a tight budget , i become very aware of just how much money i 'm letting go . 
  that includes paying for lockers . 
  i always consider just carrying around my backpack to all the sites so i do n't have to pay for the locker . 
  this is n't really a japan problem though , just a general travel problem . 
  call me stingy , i really am . 
  - i 've never had a problem with crowds since i do n't really visit the top touristy spots and if i do then i 'm there before the crowds arrive anyway . 
  i think the most crowds i 've met were at osaka castle and the hiroshima peace museum ( since i ca n't get in before 9am , that means i have to follow the same timetable as the other tourists ) and meiji shrine . 
  and on a train squashed up against a window once . 
  - summer heat . 
  i 'm never going in summer again , i almost collapsed so many times . 
  according to another post here the americans seem to be used to those levels of heat , but with my low blood pressure i really just felt like laying down in front of the hostel 's air-con for the whole day . 
  also if going in summer there tend to be lots of general bugs buzzing around ( of course ) and i met many huge hornets . 
  - not many rubbish bins . 
  in spain if you want to throw something away all you have to do is look around you and there 's probably a bin nearby , but in japan i often had to carry it around a lot . 
  especially annoying if i 'm carrying the whole bento plastic box . 
  language has never been a problem . 
  which cities did you go to that had nothing to do ? 
  i find that many sites are `` secret '' and unless you know of them beforehand you would n't really find out about them when there . 
   travel companions who do n't have similar views on traveling . 
  that 's why i will always prefer to travel solo or with my family , my friends all have very different ways of doing things and i would n't enjoy the trip that much with them . 
  i 'm the type to wake up at 6am ( often 5am if i 'm visiting rural areas and there are n't many trains ) , no cofee though , and walk to get to the places as soon as they open . 
  if the temple at the top of a mountain opens at 8am , i 'll be hiking up to be there at that time . 
  nothing better than making the most of the early fresh daylight and seeing a place with no tourists !, 
  i 've not had a problem finding a room for 2500 yen in tokyo-kyoto-sapporo , there are many places for less in the case of tokyo and kyoto . 
  the people who work at hostels see that as their job . 
  with a rise of airbnbs that will only mean taking away jobs from hostel workers , while those who rent out a room or bed in their apartment are only doing it as a way of earning a little bit extra money . 
  there are plenty cheap hostels and guest houses and the prices compared to airbnb are about the same , i do n't think using airbnb would be the best option . 
  if it were about properly legalising it in rural areas or somewhere where there is a lack of cheap accomodation then okay , but that 's not the case . 
  i know what it means within context , not like this by itself ... 
  it was easy to carry around and bring it into any restaurant . 
  we ca n't really call my backpack a backpack though , it 's more like a slightly bigger school bag . 
  i think most people have bigger packs . 
  either way , there 'll probably be a wall or something you can leave it against if it does n't fit under your table . 
  thank * you * u/thesoulofalltheeast and u/nou _ spiro , there are few people who actually want to listen to me talk about history ... 
  i arrived at around opening time and the museums are small and did n't take much time . 
  the hardest bit is finding the memorials but once you 've found them they are quick to see too . 
  i think that you can easily be done before lunch . 
  inuyama and hikone nearby both have castles with original keeps and so are two of the best in japan ( as of interior aesthetics , at least ) . 
  ishida mitsunari , head of the western army , lived near hikone . 
  but after the sekigahara battle his castle was taken down and hikone castle was built nearby , used by ii naomasa 's son . 
  that 's about it , really . 
  [ inuyama castle ] ( http://www.jcastle.info/castle/profile/46-inuyama-castle ) has a bit more movement but there were n't any important battles , simply moving people around . 
  so even if these two castles look good today and are great to see what a castle used to look like inside , they are n't really historically important . 
  but i feel like sharing my secret spots and so i would recommend gifu nearby as a consideration . 
  gifu used to be the home to oda nobunaga and so you can see statues and stuff related to him around the city . 
  gifu castle is a regular cement castle today , however it held an important role pre-battle of sekigahara ; the clashes of both sides led to the fierce [ battle of gifu castle ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_gifu_castle ) and ended with gifu castle being destroyed . 
  the interesting thing is that oda hidenobu 's men ( he was the heir of nobunaga after his death ) held the castle to the best of their abilities but in the end it was clear they were going to loose . 
  the last of them committed seppuku in the castle . 
  later , pieces of the castle were used to construct ( or at least add to ) s\u014dfuku-ji temple , including the blood stained floorboards where these men killed themselves . 
  you can still visit [ s\u014dfuku-ji ] ( http://blog.goo.ne.jp/f5kanekiyogoo555/e/cb7706f35a4732c794ad88cd0e48bbf0 ) today and see the `` blood ceiling '' there . 
  the same temple also holds the mortuary chapel of oda nobunaga and i think also his son ( hidenobu 's father ) . 
  there are also some other nice temples such as [ hokkeiji ] ( https://www.google.es/maps/uv?hl=en&amp;pb=!1s0x6003aa532c1af1c5:0x7e8be6ba9a0ca7c3!2m19!2m2!1i80!2i80!3m1!2i20!16m13!1b1!2m2!1m1!1e1!2m2!1m1!1e3!2m2!1m1!1e5!2m2!1m1!1e4!3m1!7e115!4shttps://picasaweb.google.com/lh/sredir?uname%3d104486067532314216574%26id%3d6352464813381819074%26target%3dphoto!5s%e6%b3%95%e8%8f%af%e5%af%ba+gifu+-+google+search&amp;imagekey=!1e3!2s-8xvdohahn2w/wch9f0nkmsi/aaaaaaaadr4/5vfrm1jxgaczjteaugksrlzkgnua5ysmaclib&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjf_r6bhk7sahui94mkhystaekqoioibdak ) and the gifu daibutsu . 
  gifu also has an old historical area , the ruins of oda nobunaga 's residence , a typical local history museum ( \u5c90\u961c\u5e02\u6b74\u53f2\u535a\u7269\u9928 ) and the kano castle ruins to visit with any spear time . 
  i do n't know if you could visit gifu the same day as sekigahara if you want to see everything , but it 's nice if you have an extra day in the area ( maybe combine both inuyama castle and gifu in the same day ) . 
  i started my day in sekigahara and ended it in the samegai-juku post town ( \u9192\u30f6\u4e95\u5bbf ) next door . 
  anyway , have fun on your trip . 
  this might be one of the best areas to visit if you like japanese history because there are numerous castles and post towns nearby ( as well as places like iga ueno and koga for ninjas ) . 
  if you like matsuo basho ogaki was his last stop of his tohoku trip . 
  but many of them are for cans and bottles only no ? 
  the ones with the circular opening i figured were n't for throwing away bento boxes . 
  personally i think you 'd have time to visit all these spots ( with 3-4 days in tokyo and 3 in kyoto ) . 
  depending on what interests you you might want to give more time to one place or another , if so then you might consider taking something out , but it does n't feel too rushed . 
  26 ) hakone ( sleep in hakone ), 
  27 - 30 ) kyoto + daytrip to nara, 
  if i were to take something out it 'd be hakone , it 's nice but it never left much of an impression . 
  going from miyajima to tokyo is a very long journey , perhaps you 'd want to stop in himeji on the way back instead to stretch your legs for a while . 
  - knowing japanese is not a must , especially in tokyo they are used to foreign tourists . 
  by the way , phrasebooks are rarely useful when there in person . 
  if somebody says something you ca n't really take out your phrasebook to see what they said , and if you need to ask something it 's much more effort to look it up and read it than simply using gestures .
