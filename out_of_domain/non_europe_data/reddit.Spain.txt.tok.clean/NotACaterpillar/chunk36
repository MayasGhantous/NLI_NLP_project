  plus , if you do n't have much of a japanese accent sometimes it can be harder for them to try and understand what you 're saying than simply looking at where you 're pointing . 
  it 's unlikely you 'll need it . 
  - honestly the biggest one is taking off shoes ( and knowing how to eat with chopsticks ) . 
  there are no huge differences that ever stood out to me . 
  in case of doubt do what the locals do . 
  it 's cool to know the shrine and temple etiquette but that 's more out of curiosity than necessity . 
  - on flights i usually just try to fall asleep , if there 's a tv it will keep you entertained . 
  if you can , try to reserve an isle seat so you can stand up often to stretch your legs . 
  also , planes tend to be pretty cold . 
  i would at least consider staying overnight in kyoto . 
  you wo n't be able to see much in one day , especially if you include 6h on the train there and back , and there is a lot to do in the city . 
  i have n't been to okazaki yet so i ca n't tell you much about it . 
  however , it 's true that ieyasu was born in okazaki castle , and there are a few shrines and temples in the area such as rokusho shrine ( \u516d\u6240\u795e\u793e\u672c\u6bbf ) , iga hachimangu ( \u4f0a\u8cc0\u516b\u5e61\u5bae ) , takisan toshogu ( \u6edd\u5c71\u6771\u7167\u5bae ) and okudono ( \u5965\u6bbf\u9663\u5c4b ) further away . 
  you can always check [ their tourism page ] ( https://okazaki-kanko.jp/point?uid=257 ) though . 
  if visiting around there you might want to check out toyokawa inari shrine too . 
  i also really like shiga , particularly otsu city for some reason ( it feels like a smaller , less touristy version of kyoto ) as well as shirahige jinja . 
  i have n't been but i really really want to go to omihachiman too ... 
  i do n't really see it as putting the justice system over her freedom though . 
  in the case of murder , it 's more like seeking peace for a family and people who will be living in pain for the rest of their lives because a loved one was murdered . 
  i would n't be doing it for the sake of following the law , i 'd be doing it because there are devastating emotional consequences when a murder happens and the family of the victim deserves to have this sorted out . 
  one should n't value their freedom over the life of an innocent person , if they committed a crime they already knew what could happen . 
  it 's hard to imagine hypotheticals that do n't and might never exist . 
  for example , there would be no point for me to imagine a situation where i had kids because i will never have kids . 
  no doubt about it . 
  sometimes morals change when situations change , people see the world differently when they have more or less to lose . 
  u/danceswithronin is going to put the brother s/he * does * have over the life of a non-existent child . 
  i meant changing morals as people 's opinions and views on the world change . 
  my morals were n't the same when i was 12 and now . 
  people 's views of the world are likely to change at some point . 
  it depends entirely on what you want to see . 
  some think 3 days are enough for kyoto but others think and an entire week still is n't enough . 
  what do you want to see and do in each place ? 
  you can start by looking at websites such as the [ official tourism site ] ( http://en.visit-hokkaido.jp/ ) and the websites for each city ( like [ sapporo ] ( http://www.welcome.city.sapporo.jp/?lang=en ) , [ hakodate ] ( http://www.hakodate.travel/en/ ) , [ kushiro ] ( http://www.kushiro-kankou.or.jp/pdf/2016panf_e.pdf ) , etc. ) . 
  as you can see [ on the map ] ( http://japanmap.facts.co/japanmapof/japancitiesmap.png ) , hokkaido is very far away from kyoto and tokyo . 
  your best bet is catching a plane or travelling to other places in hokkaido . 
  apart from long distance buses , you might want to consider simply taking local trains from akita to tokyo . 
  yes , it 's a long way , but you can stop many times . 
  you can easily make a trip out of that route . 
  i second miyajima , that 's what many people consider the `` highlight '' of their trip to hiroshima . 
  grapefruit , pomegranate and passion fruit . 
  i love all three and have never been able to choose a favourite . 
  aomori is one of my favourite prefetures . 
  mt.osore , hirosaki castle , the sannai maruyama park ... worth checking out . 
  i would go for mac but my cable broke so i 'm currently angry with them . 
  i love the 9th and 10th doctors . 
  i went for eccleston but it was a hard choice , i feel sorry for david tennant now ... 
  i do n't think `` passing through '' can be considered `` travelling to '' . 
  you could do shikoku in three days , kyushu is very big though . 
  as an ace , it does bother me a bit when someone sees only one a and assumes it 's for `` ally '' and make it about themselves because it excludes the actual asexuals that are part of the community . 
  if there are two `` a `` s then the second one is for ally , or if it 's written as lgbt + i assume that the + includes both allies and asexuals . 
  but if it 's just one a , it 's for asexuals . 
  true , but gender and sexuality are two topics that often are connected and mentioned together . 
  sexuality makes little sense without gender ( unless cases of pansexuality or asexuality or something ) . 
  the two communites are close either way . 
  i ca n't even get past the first page because it keeps saying `` blank must only contain alphabetical characters '' . 
  even when i correct it it does n't let me pass the page . 
  i did n't like the shrine much even without scaffolding so i 'd say no , there were simply too many tourists and nothing much stood out particularly . 
  especially if you 'll be seeing other shrines and temples during your trip . 
  this is a personal opinion , of course , many people like meiji shrine . 
  i clicked the post because i was wondering if there 's a place called barca . 
  i used to write a journal but now i just write very long emails to my parents every day . 
  when i get home after the trip i type out the trip reports and post them online too . 
  it is , since miyajima is in hiroshima prefecture . 
  not hiroshima city , though . 
  just to say that the deer on miyajima are n't treated well . 
  there are too many of them on the island and are too tame , often annoying the people living there , so the town hall of hatsukaichi has decided to let them starve to death to see if they 'll become a bit more independent and retrieve back to the forests as they were in the past rather than the streets . 
  the only thing they eat is what they manage to steal from tourists ( this usually includes maps and paper ) , the reason why they 're so `` friendly '' is because they really just want food . 
  by looking at them you can tell that they 're skinny and scruffy . 
  if you like deer go to nara instead , they do treat them well there . 
  the places to sleep on miyajima are all ryokans , i.e. 
  traditional ( and pretty expensive ) inns . 
  there 's also a campsite though . 
  so unless you have the money to pay for a ryokan , staying in hiroshima would be the best bet . 
  also , hiroshima is very far away from tokyo ( about 5-6h on the bullet train ) , so maybe you 'd want to consider sleeping in osaka or kyoto half way between the two rather than doing the full trip at once . 
  i 'm hoping june but i have n't bought the plane tickets yet since i might have to go to japan for work instead . 
  i guess the biggest problem being a vegetarian would be that i do n't really recognize the food much so it may be hard to tell if it 's really vegetarian or not . 
  with a bit of planning i think we 'll be okay though !, 
  thanks for the recommendations !, 
  the raohe nightmarket looks good , i 'll add it to the list !, 
  i came across the [ hippo statues ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/hippo_sculpture_taipei_zoo_20543.jpg/1024px-hippo_sculpture_taipei_zoo_20543.jpg ) in some post online talking about cool statues , i wrote it down but did n't actually know where it was . 
  i just realised the hippo statues are actually inside the zoo ( i 'll have to cross it off then : / ) . 
  i was n't thinking of going to pingxi but \u5b5d\u5b50\u5c71 looks really cool !, 
  i could probably add it if i have extra time , it looks like the shifen waterfall is along the same train line too . 
  in jiufen i 'd also like to visit the gold museum ( s ) and the benshan fifth tunnel and i 'd like to see the place both by day and night , so i 'll stay there to sleep , but it 's good to know i can do golden waterfall in the same day . 
  have you been to the nanya rock formations ? 
  thanks !, 
  i think i 'm underestimating a bit the distances between places , it would be a good idea to sleep in chiayi and then take the alishan forest railway to the walks i want to do the next day . 
  i 've spent hours at history museums in other countries so i 'm sure i 'll be quite a while at the national palace museum . 
  i was thinking of starting my first day in taipei early at elephant mountain and the second day at the museum , and see anything else with the time i have left . 
  i 'll also add shilin night market to the list !, 
  i guess the problem with not knowing how to drive is that i do n't know what the signs/simbols means or `` road rules '' beyond the basics , so it 's likely i 'll get into an accident . 
  guandu temple looks great !, 
  i 'll try to visit both of the temples :p, 
  i would go to kyoto on the morning of the 10th , rather than doing a bit of both cities that day . 
  you have vey little time in kyoto and spending three hours on the train during the middle of the day when you could be sightseeing instead ... 
  i feel it 's a bit of a waste . 
  i got lost because i did n't realize shinjuku and seibu-shinjuku were two different stations . 
  but yeah , signs are clear . 
  i stayed in the osaka one and it was fine . 
  i felt it was * less * lively than the hiroshima one because there was nobody in the common room whenever i passed by and i even stayed there a couple hours .
