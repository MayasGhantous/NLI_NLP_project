  for what it 's worth , the little gifts they give out at osaka looked better than the hiroshima ones . 
  ah , thanks , i was wondering how i 'd get around !, 
  i tend to avoid zoos for moral reasons , so i wo n't be going there . 
  there is no * correct * way to do the pilgrimage , there are more and less traditional ways to do it , sure , but not right or wrong . 
  someone who does the pilgrimage walking is n't a better pilgrim than someone who takes a bus -- these are just different ways of getting from temple to temple . 
  being a pilgrim is about something in your head , in your mental attitude and how you approach what you are attempting to do , not your legs , how long it takes or how much you suffer . 
  i think this is the number one thing to understand about the shikoku henro if you 're interested in doing it . 
  i actually planned the whole thing and was ready to get started but ended up cancelling it last minute because of work and stuff . 
  so i know a lot about it but have n't actually done it ( yet ) . 
  i was going to do it for many reasons :, 
  - test how capable i really am in a physical sense . 
  - learn about buddhism . 
  i can understand shinto well and have often felt connected to it when i visit shrines , but sometimes buddhism is harder to grasp because it includes believing rather than feeling . 
  - i have depression and wanted to see if i could be something again . 
  - it 's a different and more immersive way to get to know a place . 
  - it 's cheaper to spend two months doing the pilgrimage on shikoku rather than to travel around the country for two months . 
  honestly , i do n't have that much money to move around so much and there are few other places that would keep me entertained for so long . 
  - see if i could improve my japanese skills . 
  if i have nobody to talk to in two months i guess i 'd try harder to communicate with the people i meet along the way . 
  domesticating owls or any wild animal on purpose only for profit because people find them ` cute ' is just wrong . 
  i fail to see how someone would go to one claiming that they do so because they like animals , but forget about how those animals are treated . 
  owls do n't even like to be touched . 
  it 's disappointing to see that they are so popular . 
  owls do n't even like to be touched , if you actually like them simply do n't go to an owl caf\u00e9 . 
  the enjoyment you 'll get during your visit will be over once you 're gone , however the caf\u00e9 will have earned money and the owls will continue to be kept there for other tourists to come along and do the same . 
  i know it 's hard to cross something off when you 're really looking forward to it but owl caf\u00e9s are not nice , you have to think if you 're doing it for yourself or if you care about the way they 're treated . 
  i think audio books are great , but i do n't consider listening and reading the same . 
  if someone were to ask , ` hey , have you read this book ? 
  ' , then i could say yes even if i technically listened to it . 
  but in an official way , i did n't actually * read * it . 
  no , but seriously , this is true . 
  on my first trip i had a lot of money , i bought lots of ridiculous stuff that seemed cool at the time and when i returned home i kept thinking ` ahhh , japan is expensive ! ' . 
  my second trip , i had an average of 800 yen a day spending money ( including for things like an umbrella , buying batteries and band aids , washing machines , etc. ), 
  and my trip was almost 3x times cheaper . 
  cutting down on the amount of things you buy is the best way to save money . 
  many things look much cooler in the shop than they do sitting on your shelf being ignored for the next three years . 
  as for transportation , make sure to build an itinerary that makes sense . 
  it 's easy to go from harajuku to asakusa then to shibuya then to ueno ( well , you would n't do all that in one day , but it 's an example ) , but that 's really just going up and down on the train pointlessly . 
  do stuff that are in the same area and save ridiculous trips on the train . 
  also , walk instead of catching the train / bus if possible . 
  it adds up quickly . 
  i do n't have the amount of money i spent in tokyo on my first trip , so ca n't really say . 
  on my second trip i went from kansai airport to hiroshima ( iwakuni ) and back again , stopping many times along the way , and spent a total of 21,820 \u5186 ( about 1450\u5186 / day ) for the two weeks . 
  i do n't know what exactly you want help on . 
  what are you planning to see ? 
  first of all , the dosan train line goes from tadotsu station ( near takamatsu ) down to kubokawa station ( kochi ) , so you can reach ** oboke station ** more or less halfway from either the north or the south of shikoku . 
  you can also reach the station via the tokushima line and later transferring onto the dosan line if you 're going to tokushima/naruto too . 
  check the timetables for the trains on hyperdia , there probably are n't many . 
  public transportation in the iya area is pretty limited and there are few ** buses ** every day , only along the main road , so you 'll probably require more time to see the area if going by bus than renting a car , meaning you might have to stay there for more than one day . 
  make sure to plan your itinerary according to the bus schedule , the last thing you 'd want is to be stranded there . 
  you can find the bus schedules [ here ] ( http://wikitravel.org/en/iya_valley ) . 
  another option is ** renting a car ** . 
  a few car renting companies in shikoku are [ to coo ! ] ( http://www2.tocoo.jp/en/index ? 
  ) , the [ hts ] ( http://www.hero-travel-spt.jp/index.html ) or [ times car rental ] ( http://www.timescar-rental.com/ ) . 
  the train station and the few restaurants , tourist office and hotels in the area should offer free tourist maps . 
  [ yonkoh ] ( http://yonkoh.co.jp/periodi.htm ) offers two different bus tours ( japanese commentary only ) . 
  the [ kazurabashi taxi company ] ( http://page-on.ocn.ne.jp/close.html ) also offers service around the area . 
  you can pay by hour or select a specific tour . 
  you can carry bicycles on japanese trains if you put them in a bike bag , so you could start your cycling trip from oboke station . 
  you wo n't find any around the valley though , so your best bet would be to rent one in takamatsu . 
  remember to ride on the left side of the road in japan !, 
  from oboke station to mount tsurugi it may be best to take it easy , but after tsurugi-san the road to sadamitsu is a scenic 25km downhill and from there you can hop onto the train again . 
  especially check out http://wikitravel.org/en/iya_valley for more transportation details , last i checked it was pretty useful . 
  please have in mind that there are very few shops to buy food and stuff around iya valley , so it 's recommended to buy them before going . 
  if you 're going to be staying in a hotel or hostel around the area , you might want to consider paying the extra amount for included breakfast and dinner during your stay . 
  if you do n't know japanese , during your research online translators are your friend . 
  good luck !, 
  is there a particular reason you do n't want to do laundry ? 
  many hostels have washing machines and driers , if not you can easily ask and they 'll point you to one . 
  even if you do n't speak japanese , which buttons to press is fairly instinctive and there are usually signs or something . 
  i 've never had a problem washing clothes in japan and i think it would be a huge saving of space . 
  have in mind that the shinkansens do n't have much space for luggage and carrying big bags around japan is a pain , if you carry too much you may have to rely on sending your bag ( imo that 's a waste of money when it can be avoided ) . 
  this is what i came here to say , honestly . 
  i used to buy umbrellas a lot but i have way too many at home and really do n't want more . 
  if i 'm going somewhere and i know it 's going to rain i just take one with me . 
  read the bad reviews first : https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/attraction_review-g1023408-d7388189-reviews-miyagi_zao_fox_village-shiroishi_miyagi_prefecture_tohoku.html, 
  the foxes are cute but they live in horrible conditions . 
  the ice bucket challenge was very popular online , but i never heard anyone mention it in person or on the news . 
  i think that it was something more common in the english speaking world rather than the spanish one / international , so that might be the reason . 
  also , about the organisations , i might know a few that i have n't ticked because i do n't recognize the english names , like we call the red cross the `` creu roja '' and m\u00e9decins sans fronti\u00e8res `` metges sense fronteres '' , so maybe a few of the english names were unrecognisable because of their spelling rather than me actually not having heard of them . 
  undies . 
  what exactly do you include as self harm ? 
  do you count tattoos ? 
  stimming that includes hitting yourself ? 
  alcoholism or knowingly using more prescription drugs than required ? 
  or do you mean mostly just cutting ? 
  i used to `` self-harm '' by not eating , if that counts . 
  i think this is much more of a blurred line than a simple yes or no question . 
  for example , i often do n't want to * live * but that does n't mean i want to die . 
  even when i do want to die , i do n't want to kill myself ( more like accidently run over by a train ) because this would deeply upset my family and my parents would blame themselves forever . 
  it 's generally more of a `` i do n't care if i die '' rather than a desire to be dead . 
  ( female ) i sleep with a shirt + undies if in a dorm room , sometimes even with my shorts on if there are no curtains or anything . 
  when alone simply in my undies . 
  only temples and shrines give out goshuin stamps but many museums , castles and train stations have stamps [ like this ] ( http://urutoranohihi.blogspot.com.es/2009/12/77-train-stations-stamp-rally.html ) if you want ( free ) . 
  i 'm also asexual . 
  i really do n't have much to say as to what it 's like to be asexual ... i do n't have any experience with the other side to contrast it to . 
  sex simply is n't a part of my life . 
  i do n't watch football either , if someone were to ask `` what 's it like to not play football ? '' , i really would n't know what to say . 
  i just do n't , do n't like it / it does n't attract me / not worth putting my time and effort into something i do n't care about , it 's not an important thing of my life . 
  as opposed to u/onceuponatesla , i never felt there was anything wrong with me or out of place , i usually just ignored my friends when they talked about it .
