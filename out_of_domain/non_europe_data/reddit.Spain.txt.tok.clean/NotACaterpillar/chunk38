  i do masturbate ( often ) , it 's fun . 
  i agree that the information could be useful , however the question is n't worded properly . 
  a better option would be to write `` cis man '' and `` trans man '' rather than just `` man '' and `` trans man '' as if the trans man was n't a real man . 
  one thing is wanting to know if somebody is a man/woman/other , the other is wanting to know if they 're trans/cis . 
  you can put the two in one question but if so then it has to be done right or op wo n't be getting the correct information anyway . 
   do you think that people who claim to be asexual might just be `` going through a phase '' or `` need to grow up ? '', 
  i do n't think all aces are `` going through a phase '' , of course , but i 'm sure some are just as there are people `` going through phases '' in other sexualities too . 
  even if it is a phase , there is nothing wrong with using that term when they feel that they identify with it . 
  it 's valid while it lasts , at least . 
  it will help them find a community and will let them feel understood and right until the phase is over . 
  i used to identify as a lesbian and later as bisexual , even though now i 've finally found a place where i `` officially '' belong and have for years , being able to use a term to feel like i was n't some weirdo helped me a lot and i found the people who would simply help me feel good with myself . 
  even though i 'm not a lesbian , i used to think i was and that 's totally fine , there should be no shaming people who use a term but eventually drop it if they later realise they feel differently or there 's some other word they identify more with . 
  popular ones in bold . 
  - nasu onsen ( though you will have to take a bus from nasu ), 
  - tsuchiyu hot spring and nuruyu onsen ( again , another bus , both close to fukushima ), 
  - ** zao onsen ** and ** akiu onsen ** ( bus from shiraoishi-zao and sendai respectively ), 
  - ** naruko onsen ** and semi onsen ( train from furukawa or shinjo ), 
  - hijiori ( bus from shinjo ), 
  i 'll leave it there , though there are many more . 
  if you 're going so far north you might as well check out nyuto onsen too , that 's a favourite of many . 
  the one that comes to mind is \u5c06\u8ecd\u5c71\u53e4\u58b3\u5c55\u793a\u9928 in saitama ( near tokyo ) , however it may be a bit of a pain to get to . 
  what does jif have to do with peanut butter ? 
  i think i 'm missing something ... 
  i usually write a short one if i simply liked it or a long one if i loved it . 
  however , i do so only if i see that the author replies to them , if i go to the comments only to see it 's a one-sided conversation it 's possible that the author has moved on . 
  i am not american/canadian , but i do n't really see why you 'd make that restriction considering you can easily do a currency exchange on google . 
  what i spent , personally , for 2 weeks :, 
  ** transport ** : 21,820 \u5186 total ( about 1450\u5186 / day ) . 
  did n't use a jr pass / shinkansen , only local trains to get around since it 's considerably cheaper . 
  i also used the * visit hiroshima tourist pass * , but if you 'll have a jr pass then you wo n't want it . 
  ** accommodation ** : 38,800 \u5186 total , 14 nights ( about 2600\u5186 / night ) . 
  hostel dorms . 
  you can already calculate how much you 'll be spending on hotels before leaving . 
  ** food ** : 17,990 \u5186 total ( about 1200\u5186 / day ) . 
  mostly bento boxes from the conbini and a few cheap lunches . 
  i 'm not much of a foodie . 
  ** sightseeing ** : 11,770 \u5186 total ( about 850\u5186 / day ) . 
  temples , museums , residences , etc. 
  i hardly ever go to temples with an entrance fee , if you do then that will add up quickly , though in kyoto most of the popular ones do make you pay . 
  ** shopping ** : 10,830 \u5186 total ( about 730\u5186 / day ) . 
  i bought just a couple things for myself ( a book , towels , etc. 
  ) , plus things like batteries , band-aids , an umbrella , etc. 
  if you have any intention to buy souvenirs or go on a spending rampage , this amount can easily be spent in a single day . 
  ** flight ** : 585 euros roundtrip from/to spain and kansai airport ( osaka ), 
  hikone is n't really rural , it 's a city and a popular tourist spot too because of the castle mentioned . 
  how rural do you want to go ? 
  are you thinking rice fields or simply small cities ? 
  do you want off-the-beaten-path ( in that case , though hakone is also nice , i would consider a different place too ) ? 
  i 'd suggest getting off the shinkansen line . 
  of course there are smaller cities and nice places along the shinkansen , however most of them are cities , transportation hubs or popular with tourists because they 're easy stops . 
  when i think rural , that 's not the atmosphere i 'm looking for . 
  i 'd suggest [ sekigahara ] ( http://www2.kanko-sekigahara.jp/lodge/003.html ) not far from hikone . 
  i think the izu peninsula would also be good . 
  edit : also i really like [ sumatakyo onsen ] ( https://www.tripadvisor.es/attraction_review-g1121220-d1425256-reviews-sumatakyo_onsen-kawanehon_cho_haibara_gun_shizuoka_prefecture_chubu.html ) , there 's a gorge , i think there are tea fields nearby and many onsen . 
  you can zoom in in google maps to see the ryokans of the area , that would be easier than trying to find them through a booking site . 
  i suggest looking through http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e623a.html for ideas . 
  that 's awesome , thanks !, 
  sounds like a great trip !, 
  the owl caf\u00e9s [ are n't really recommended ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/japantravel/comments/5zz0up/opinion_on_owl_cafes/ ) if you like owls , they usually are n't treated too well . 
  most people go to golden gai just to walk around and eat/drink . 
  it probably wo n't be more interesting beyond that during the week though . 
  ^ this . 
  i never know why when someone asks about race , they often put an option for `` mixed '' without any further space for commentary . 
  i do n't see how this would help with the stats since they could be mixed anything , they are n't giving you any information about their race . 
  while i really like temples and shrines , i usually do n't enjoy visiting the more famous attractions . 
  i finally went to kyoto on my fourth trip but only spent there a day and then left because there were just too many people and i could see temples elsewhere in a much more calm setting . 
  there are many temples and shrines that are recommended to visitors and packed full of tourists , i usually feel disappointed when i visit these bigger , more popular ones because it just feels like i 'm visiting them because i have to and not because it 's worth it . 
  i 've found that the temples / shrines away from the tourists are usually the ones worth going to . 
  i still have n't been to nikko or nara and i 've only spent half a day in osaka , but i do n't regret it . 
  there 's more to japan than the so often mentioned `` must-sees '' , it 's only a question of understanding this and not wasting your time doing something you think you might not like just because everyone else does . 
  imho , skip kiyomizudera ( it 's under construction anyway ) , kinkakuji , ryoanji , sensoji , etc. 
  unless you 'll be there early in the morning . 
  anything past 10am is too late and already packed . 
  i was at sensoji at 8am and it was wonderful ... i was there again 3h later and it was a horror . 
  meiji shrine at noon was simply frustrating ; i did a few photos and was out of there . 
  stone gardens can be seen in many places , ryoanji is simply a famous one . 
  go to hiraizumi to see the golden pavilion there rather than kinkakuji . 
  unless you really like buddha , skip the kamakura one , you have to pay an entrance fee and there 's not much else to see there anyway . 
  i 'm one of the few that did n't like miyajima either : the deer are n't treated well , the shops are touristy and all sell the same and everyone is trying to take photos of the same thing . 
  go to shirahige shrine or \u014caraiisosaki shrine to see a floating torii instead , there 's nobody there . 
  if you enjoy hiking , consider doing a hike to get to a temple/shrine . 
  in such a case , at least you enjoy the scenery if it turns out temples are n't your thing . 
  i 'd recommend [ mt.shosha ] ( https://tokyoanecdote.wordpress.com/2016/07/13/a-morning-at-mt-shosha/ ) and [ mt.haguro ] ( https://www.google.es/search?q=mount+haguro&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewixlkw_nyvtahud2bokhyebaciq_auiccgb&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=589 ) . 
  someone also mentioned kurama and kibune , that 's nice too but start early because it 's kyoto and there are crowds . 
  that 's because temples and shrines are n't the main focus of tokyo . 
  on my first trip i spent two weeks in tokyo and only saw a couple , however go to another city and they 'll probably be more relevant . 
  spending a week in kyoto and not visiting any would be harder , each place has it 's main points . 
  ah , you 're talking about shinagawa shrine !, 
  i agree though , there are thousands of temples and shrines in japan and you 'd only be going to crowded ones if you stick to the tourist hotspots . 
  i 've been alone in most shrines i 've been to . 
  i agree , i do n't mind the flights but i try to avoid layovers in china because of the airports . 
  most problems i 've had involve getting lost or not knowing what was going on ( people shouting , staff pointing me in different directions when i ask the same question , etc. ), 
  which i think could really be improved by putting up proper signs . 
  i was really dissapointed by iwakuni . 
  it 's true that the view from the castle is of the best i 've seen and the bridge is really cool , but the rest of the park has little to do and the castle is n't really too interesting even though i really like castles . 
  i 'd say , if going to iwakuni , combine it with miyajima or hiroshima the same day or else it 's kind of out of the way for not much to see . 
  what are you interested in photographing ? 
  nature , temples , urban atmosphere , rain , sunsets ? 
  photography opportunities are everywhere , what exactly are you looking for ? 
  for waterfalls i 'd head over to toyama , there they have the sh\u014dmy\u014d falls , hannoki falls and ryujin falls all close by and pretty incredible , and tokoniji falls in the area too .
