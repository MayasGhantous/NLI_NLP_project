  though these places may be a bit harder to get to . 
  or you can always do the akame 48 waterfalls hike . 
  ginzan onsen is one of the most famous tourist destinations of the prefecture , personally i 'd go for hijiori onsen nearby if looking for something a bit more local , though it 's true it 's not so scenic . 
  anyway , both are nice , of course . 
  i personally liked places like [ samegai-juku ] ( https://www.google.es/search?q=%e9%86%92%e4%ba%95%e5%ae%bf&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjnlkkgq5dtahwjubqkhshuc5kq_auibygc&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=589 ) , [ tokoname ] ( https://www.google.es/search?q=tokoname&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjxyfo0q5dtahuetbqkhuwodomq_auiccgb&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=589 ) , [ takehara ] ( https://www.odigo.jp/articles/2636-takehara-a-city-of-traditional-residences ) or [ tono ] ( https://www.google.es/search?q=%e6%9f%b3%e4%ba%95%e5%b8%82&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewji-yehrjdtahxeuhqkhqfvcusq_auibygc&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=589#tbm=isch&amp;q=tono+city ) . 
  though samegai is pretty small and you can see it all pretty quickly ( it 's very photogenic , but there 's little to do ) and tokoname may not be of too much interest unless you like pottery . 
  i 'd go for takehara if you 're going to hiroshima or tono is you 're going north . 
  and , though i have n't been yet , [ fukiya furusato ] ( https://www.google.es/search?q=tokoname&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjxyfo0q5dtahuetbqkhuwodomq_auiccgb&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=589#tbm=isch&amp;q=fukiya+furusato ) is high on my to-visit list . 
  takahashi next door is also considered pretty rural too , if you want to see both , or take a bike ride through the kibi plain . 
  worth noting that there 's also [ a bus from kyoto / osaka ] ( http://bus-en.fujikyu.co.jp/highway/detail/id/9 ) to fuji for around 4,900 yen , in case that 's of interest . 
  you can go to wakayama with the bus pass , though going to koyasan from there may seem a bit expensive if you 're on a budget ( at least , koyasan does seem expensive to me ) . 
  you could check the [ bus pass page ] ( http://willerexpress.com/st/3/en/pc/buspass/#buy ) to see the routes and see the available stops , that will pretty much give you the answer since all places can be interesting . 
  personally , i really like izumo/matsue and sendai too ( you can visit matsushima and yamadera while you 're in sendai ) . 
  when hiking in japan i mostly just assume there could be bears . 
  i bought a bear bell on amazon ( i actually bought two ) and i hang them from my bag/pants when going hiking . 
  bears in japan ( hokkaido not included ) are usually scared of humans and usually wo n't come near if they hear noise , that 's what the bells are for . 
  however , it 's usually better to talk so sometimes i sing to myself if i feel particularly alone . 
  i have n't had any encounters but that 's not to say that there are none . 
  you should read about what to do if you encounter a bear just in case , though make sure the articles are talking about bears in japan and not in other countries since attitudes vary by place and species . 
  they say bears come out most in early mornings and evenings , so you can always start the hike a bit later in the day ( like 10am ) to feel a bit safer . 
  make sure to look around you too , looking at the ground while walking is pretty common and if there is a bear close by you may get closer accidently because you did n't see it . 
  ( just be careful you do n't step on any snakes , i 'd say they 're more common than bears and i have almost stepped on one myself . ), 
  personally , i would n't worry * too * much since people do do the hike alone , though be prepared . 
  you might want to consider finding someone who 'd want to do the hike with you if you prefer . 
  as for water , bring your own . 
  yeah , the main island only has asian black bears ( they are n't the same as american black bears though ) . 
  hokkaido , the northern island , has ezo brown bears that are more aggresive . 
  - you can visit the makinohara plateau in shizuoka for free , but you would have to pay to be able to do [ tea picking ] ( http://openwifi.jp.e.aae.hp.transer.com/shizuoka/article/1 ) or walking through it since it is somebody 's farm . 
  - yame in kyushu also has [ tea fields ] ( https://www.google.es/search?q=%e5%85%ab%e5%a5%b3%e4%b8%ad%e5%a4%ae%e5%a4%a7%e8%8c%b6%e5%9c%92+%e8%8c%b6%e7%95%91&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewimqaz95phtahwkubokhdl8amcq_auiccgb&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=589 ) but that would be fairly out of the way from where you 're going and a bit hard to get to . 
  - do make sure to visit uji too , uji is often considered the tea city of japan and is near kyoto . 
  - [ sayama ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sayama_tea ) near tokyo also has [ tea fields ] ( https://www.google.es/maps/@35.8539281,139.4461561,3a,75y,122.58h,85.43t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1swx8wy5wkx8xawr-nn2ppxw!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!6m1!1e1?hl=en ) . 
  i do n't think this is a black/white answer . 
  some things were wrong , some were right , but that does n't make the entire thing wrong or right . 
  i travel for leisure 100 % of the time , it just happens that my job is my hobby . 
  i 'd say i travel for work about 30 % of the time , but even when working i consider it leisure . 
  i usually travel with just a carry on , i might check in a bag on the way back with food but i would never pack to do so . 
  if a carry-on is less than 41 -- 50 lbs , does that mean it 's free in those examples ? 
  also , it may be a good idea to put the weight in kg too , or else change the target of the survey to americans . 
  most of the tea from uji actually comes from wazuka nearby that you meantioned . 
  have in mind that most tea farms are next to the road so you can easily take a look from the edge and take some nice photos , you 'd really only have to ask for permission to walk through it . 
  if you 're going to kamakura from tokyo , j\u014dmy\u014d-ji temple has a cemetery that i found pretty interesting . 
  i do n't know if you 'll be going this far , but right next to the hiroshima peace pagoda there is a really huge one too . 
  they have a really nice garden outside by the way , personally i really like hiroshima airport . 
  if going by night bus look at the [ bus pass ] ( http://willerexpress.com/st/3/en/pc/buspass/ ) too . 
  edit : before buying the tokyo wide pass you should compare individual fare costs first . 
  if you 'll be day tripping to kamakura , nikko , kawagoe , etc. 
  it would n't pay off since these places are close by or there are already other convenient discount passes for them ( [ kawagoe ] ( http://www.tobu.co.jp/foreign/tojo/en/discount/ ) , [ nikko ] ( http://www.tobu.co.jp/foreign/en/pass/twoday.html ) ) . 
  the pass would likely be more useful if going to places like mt.nokogiri , mito , kusatsu onsen , mt.fuji , etc. 
  that are a bit further away . 
  op , what they mean is that you put `` sex '' but then gave the options `` male/female/other '' . 
  sex refers to biological sex ( male/female/intersex ) , while gender is our sense of selves ( man/woman/other ) . 
  biologically , there are no `` other '' sexes . 
  you 've posted this survey exactly 62 times . 
  perhaps you could try your luck looking for responses elsewhere , i doubt there are many here who have n't already seen it . 
  yeah , i mentioned that . 
   sex refers to biological sex ( male/female/intersex ), 
  this needs to have * much * more room for open answers . 
  - questions 14 and 15 are either `` yes/no/i do n't know '' , however you do n't give room for `` depends '' , `` no change '' or other answers . 
  question 18 simply does n't reflect my opinion at all , none of the answers work . 
  same goes for questions 22 , 24 . 
  - question 21 asks about compatibility of islam with my religious viewpoints , but there are no questions about my views on other religions . 
  so you ca n't really figure out what my views on islam are , whether i think it 's better/worse/same as other religions even if i do give a positive or negative answer . 
  it 's not the same somebody who says that islam is totally incompatible however christianity and buddhism are fine , or someone who thinks they are all totally incompatible , however they would both give you the same answer to that question . 
  - `` immigrants should adjust to the culture and values of the host country . '', 
  i think this needs to be in two different questions . 
  though they can be linked , culture and values are two different things . 
  - `` it is important for a country to maintain their identity . '', 
  this would depend on what exactly counts as identity . 
  i think it would be great for tourism and establishing a sense of community and all that , but there can obviously be down sides to . 
  for example , i 'm from spain but am strongly against bullfighting . 
  i would argue that that part of spain 's identity needs to disappear , however other aspects of spanish culture i 'd be glad if they were maintained . 
  times change and countries change , identity changes with it . 
  - `` women should have the right to abort an unwanted pregnancy . '', 
  many people consider timing an important part of this decision rather than it being a yes/no answer . 
  i simply felt like my views were n't at all well represented with the options given in each question . 
  having space to write my thoughts would be a great idea . 
  another thing , the names of the countries are a bit strange . 
  i 'm doing the survey in english and have accessed it while browsing through an english site , so it would make more sense for the names of the countries to be in english without the initials in front . 
  reading sentences like `` what should es - spain immigration policy be ? '', 
  seems more confusing than it should be ( especially in longer questions ) . 
  it would be appreciated if it simply said `` spain '' and it will then also be easier to search through the country options at the start . 
  there are a few questions about me questioning my hobbies and i 've put 1 to all of them . 
  this is because i have always had one singular hobby , it 's always been the main focus of my life , and so have never questioned it ( rather than my hobbies being unimportant to me ) . 
  i would want my home country to send money and support to another country ( japan , israel , india or otherwise ) in the case of a natural disaster , especially if it 's on the scale of 11/3 . 
  i would be more reluctant in the case of war . 
  they are two * very * different topics that i do n't think can be bunched together in the same question ; one is about helping people and unity and all that , the other is about , well , war/killing . 
  of course , sending aid to countries in war to help people ( doctors , housing , bringing them somewhere safer , etc. ), 
  is different than sending bombs and weapons and an army ... all of this needs to be taken into account when answering a question like this . 
  i ca n't answer the survey because you 're asking me to give the same answer on two very different topics i have two different opinions on . 
  me too . 
  honestly , i 'm kind of jealous since a cup seems so convenient/cheaper and i 've had to cancel many swimming plans because i ca n't use tampons ... 
  many countries count seven continents ( including most english speaking countries ) however there are also many countries who count 6 continents . 
  here in spain i was taught 5-6 continents ( europe , asia , oceania , africa , america , antarctica was sometimes included or not ) . 
  as someone who uses local trains to do long distances ( ex . 
  osaka to hiroshima ) , i really think this option is a great way to get to know the country and let 's you stop in less-common sites along the way . 
  however , night buses are usually cheaper , they definitely are in the tokyo-sendai case . 
  it 's fine , it does n't annoy me , just that i do n't know how useful it would be to continue posting it . 
  good luck !, 
  i do n't think i 'd call it a luxury , more like a priority . 
  obviously this would n't work for someone who 's doing the golden route , because they 'd rather do tokyo , kyoto , hiroshima , etc.
