  and would n't have time to fit in a journey like this . 
  every trip is about choosing what one wants to see and do in a limited amount of time , if someone chooses to go and do one thing instead of another , this ca n't be considered a luxury , rather simply a choice . 
  i 've been to japan three times and have n't yet been to kyoto . 
  my trips are 2 weeks long , like most people , simply that i preferred to spend my time travelling slower like this instead of taking the shinkansen , and thus did n't have time for kyoto . 
  going to kyoto was n't my priority , so i skipped it . 
  you give up one thing or you give up another , nobody can do everything !, 
  i always think of [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qnd-hdmgfk ) when i hear dave . 
  shops probably wo n't be open at 8-9am , it 'd also be a bit too early to buy deer food . 
  you should try to learn some basic phrases ( please , thanks , excuse me , etc. ), 
  and this will bring you a long way . 
  however , the cities you 'll be going to are very accustomed to foreign tourists so you should n't have any problems . 
  personally i really like arquitecture and history so those are always my main focus when travelling . 
  i 'd start at osaka castle before the crowds get there ( it was a bit * too * crowded to be enjoyable when i was there , but the place and history behind it is great ) , maybe the osaka museum of history too if i feel like it . 
  then i 'd go on to the [ open-air museum of old japanese farm houses ] ( https://www.google.es/search?q=%e6%97%a5%e6%9c%ac%e6%b0%91%e5%ae%b6%e9%9b%86%e8%90%bd%e5%8d%9a%e7%89%a9%e9%a4%a8&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewia3iwx8zftahxc6xokhyw8cciq_auibygc&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=589 ) . 
  i 'd also want to walk around minoo until katsu\u014d-ji , however it 's about a 2h walk in one direction so i 'd need at least 5h before sunset to add that to the list . 
  if not , i 'd try to catch a bunraku or kabuki show . 
  ah , and i 'd find somewhere to try osaka okonomiyaki . 
  though it 's not really necessary to put on socks inside when you take off your sandals . 
  going barefoot is perfectly acceptable too !, 
  i 've been to japan four times and visited many temples , i 've never been refused entry and have seen many others go barefoot too . 
  if you 've seen it though maybe some temples do have this rule !, 
  out of curiosity , are there any prefectures you have n't yet visited or been to only briefly ? 
  i prefer those that record the ambience and sound of a place rather than just walking , like [ kappa2700s ] ( https://www.youtube.com/channel/ucj1-fyrmj_u0vzeb0lteamw ) , [ sirousaghi ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/sirousaghi/featured ) , [ channel wasabi ] ( https://www.youtube.com/channel/uck-ibcqxsxdiita9ltmtaxg/videos ) , etc. 
  which channels do you follow ? 
  you may have more luck over at the [ tw fic finder ] ( http://twficfinder.tumblr.com/ ) if nobody here knows . 
  i never pay much attention to the quality since i 'm more interested in the places they visit ( especially when i 'll be visiting those places ) . 
  [ shiso productions ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/shiso2012 ) should be better . 
  i also follow [ letters from japan ] ( https://www.youtube.com/channel/ucnkcjxj1ihwfi9l05qfyfja/videos ) , unfortunately he focuses mostly on kyoto . 
  i 've had the opposite experience !, 
  i often get vip treatment in the less touristy areas : people stopping to talk to me and give me food ( this has happened quite a few times actually ) , a woman ran across the street from her restaurant to give me a brochure about the temple in english , when i was lost a bus that was driving by stopped and a passenger gave me directions , i 've been offered drives to wherever i wanted to go , etc. 
  their hospitality is great . 
  however , in places where there are many foreign tourists they often have n't gone to such extents to make me feel so welcome ( for obvious reasons , there are many people after all ) . 
  i 've had people ignore me or act a bit rudely in these areas , particularly miyajima , probably because they see many ignorant or rude foreigners too and they have to deal with so many people who do n't speak japanese that it can get tiring . 
  i think it 's a bit far fetched to say that everyone in miyajima or fukuoka are rude though , just some bad luck . 
  for what it 's worth , japanese hospitality is better than here in spain either way . 
  mine lasted quite some time too . 
  however , then i learned a few things about japan that i did n't like and that cleared it . 
  now that i 've gone a few times to japan , i do n't mind getting back home because that means that i can start planning my next trip !, 
  i always find planning exciting , sharing my photos and trip reports , etc. 
  though i find japan an amazing country to travel to , i would n't really want to live there , realising this helped clear up this `` home-sickness '' i was feeling for japan . 
  me too . 
  not the us , but spain . 
  i 've lived most of my life here , i 'm used to how things work , it 's basically the only place i 'll ever be able to speak my language ( catalan ) with someone , my family lives here ... this place is my home . 
  i think japan is an amazing country to travel to , but i would n't want to be there full-time . 
  i spent two weeks in tokyo and now i kind of do n't want to go back again . 
  i mean , it 's great and there are still many things to see and do , it just is n't what my first impression was anymore . 
  i 'm now more interested in rural places so on my second trip i skipped kyoto , osaka , nara , takayama , nikko , etc. 
  and just spent a couple weeks in hiroshima and okayama visiting places all over the city and smaller towns nearby . 
  two trips later i still have n't been to those `` must-see '' places ( though i 've spent a sick day in osaka ) , instead visiting the sites i want to see scattered around the country . 
  i really want to go to scotland . 
  i 'm going to give up one of my japan trips to go there , seems amazing . 
  happens to many people though . 
  when i was a kid i lived in nz , i never appreciated it until i moved to spain . 
  now that i 'm older , i miss the family excursions around spain too ... kids have other things to think about . 
  what bothers me is when a character uses only a few select words in their language because they have to show that they are n't a native english speaker . 
  these can be totally random words in the middle of a sentence as if they did n't know how to say them in english but just barrel through it either way . 
  the most memorable one was a character who kept saying `` oh my dieu '' instead of `` oh my god '' . 
  as a catalan/spanish native speaker , when i 'm talking in english i would n't say things like this . 
  i may however start a sentence with `` bueno '' because that 's a filler ( `` bueno , i might not be there after all '' ) , similar to saying `` and ** like ** , when this happened '' or '' ** well ** , it 's not like that '' . 
  or perhaps saying `` no '' accidently in my spanish accent , especially at the end of sentences ( `` you 'll be coming with his car , no ? '' ) . 
  these are things that are very common to say when speaking spanish , and even when i switch language they are still strong enough to stick . 
  sprouting random words or changing set phrases like `` oh my god '' would be quite a bit of effort . 
  this can be good sometimes too . 
  in teen wolf , we do n't know anything about derek 's sister laura , yet the fandom has created a personality for her that makes her seem as if she were another real character from the show . 
  also , everyone called the sheriff john in fic until they announced he 's called noah in one of the later seasons ( yet many still call him john , it stuck ) . 
  in osaka / kyoto you can not get a pasmo or a suica because these are only sold in the tokyo area . 
  in osaka you 'll only be able to get an icoca card , which is basically the same thing but a different colour . 
  the icoca does n't necessarily come together with the haruka ticket , as you mentioned in another comment , this is just a special discount for a trip from kansai airport . 
  you can get a normal icoca card , no haruka included , at train stations in osaka [ from the ticket machines ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3kom13sfwy ) . 
  you 'll pay 2000 yen : this is a 500 yen deposit ( you can get this back if you return your card at the end of the trip , however you can only return it in osaka , not tokyo ) , plus 1500 yen already loaded and ready for you to use on any train ride . 
  they have the same function . 
  i like pasmo better because it has a picture of a train . 
  no , in kyoto you ** can not ** get a pasmo . 
  you can , however , * use * a pasmo on the trains if you already have one . 
  neither a pasmo , suica or icoca work on kyoto city buses , you 'll have to pay each ride individually or buy a day bus pass . 
  a fanny pack is usually carried outside you clothes , however i usually use a money belt that goes under and ca n't be seen . 
  this is safer and nobody will laugh at how silly it looks . 
  i also separate my money in 2-3 groups ; some in my money belt , some in my pack , etc. 
  so in case something happens to one i still have the rest . 
  lamenting the end of semana santa and going back to work . 
  i 'm a manaca fan myself !, 
  yes ; pasmo , suica and icoca all have the same function and can be used on trains/metro around tokyo-osaka-kyoto . 
  however , none work on kyoto buses , you 'll have to pay for each ticket individually or buy a day bus pass for that . 
  ah , that 's good to know !, 
  sorry , i kept my parents ' money belt and have had it for years . 
  no idea where it came from . 
  not all countries use gpa grading system by the way , and i hear that some use [ different numbers and scales ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/engineeringstudents/comments/3mij1f/gpa_scale_for_different_countries/ ) . 
  here in spain we do n't call it a gpa ( we just say `` medium mark '' or something ) , from 1-10 . 
  the study is about women though , not about men . 
  you can argue whether it 's done properly or not but it 's still studying a particular demographic . 
  i 've never had a letter grade . 
  our english teacher tried it once to fit with what english people do , but everyone was so confused that she did n't do it again haha . 
  it 's a good idea , but in summer this could get a bit hot ... 
  i 'm a catalan first-language speaker living in bcn , i have n't ever seen anyone get annoyed at someone for speaking spanish but i 'm sure they exist . 
  personally , i do n't speak spanish very well , i can understand it and write it perfectly fine but i do n't usually speak it so i have little practise . 
  when someone speaks to me in spanish i often reply in catalan , as a default ( most of the time i do n't even realise they 're talking spanish instead of catalan ) , but i will swap if i realise they do n't understand or if they look like foreigners , no hard feelings whatsoever . 
  some are like me who speak catalan 95 % of the time , but many others use both languages interchangeably or speak spanish on a regular basis . 
  i 've never seen anyone have problems with this . 
  [ yuki onsen ] ( http://tonnkotuonnsenn2.cocolog-nifty.com/blog/2009/08/post-0576.html ) ( \u6e6f\u6765\u6e29\u6cc9 ) in hiroshima is one of the few onsen towns in the prefecture , it 's not really an area known for onsen . 
  the bus departs form itsukaichi station ( \u4e94\u65e5\u99c5 ) .
