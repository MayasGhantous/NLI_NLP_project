  [ here ] ( http://www.hiroden.co.jp/bus/route/timetable/w_no3_4.pdf#page=2 ) 's a timetable . 
  imo , hongu taisha to nachi taisha is more scenic because you pass through yunomine onsen and [ hyakkuen-gura ] ( https://www.google.es/search?q=%e7%99%be%e9%96%93%e3%81%90%e3%82%89+%e7%86%8a%e9%87%8e%e5%8f%a4%e9%81%93&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewidmip43z_tahuh0hokhzvfaguq_auicsgc&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=589 ) , as well as [ waroda-ishi ] ( https://www.google.es/search?q=%e7%99%be%e9%96%93%e3%81%90%e3%82%89+%e7%86%8a%e9%87%8e%e5%8f%a4%e9%81%93&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewidmip43z_tahuh0hokhzvfaguq_auicsgc&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=589#tbm=isch&amp;q=%e5%86%86%e5%ba%a7%e7%9f%b3+%e7%86%8a%e9%87%8e%e5%8f%a4%e9%81%93 ) which is my favourite bit of the entire route . 
  there are few accommodations in koguchi though , so book in advance . 
  perhaps it would be easier to take a bus instead of driving your own car , departing from kii-tanabe station . 
  though not too frequent , buses do connect many places along the routes with the shrines and nearby train stations . 
  skyla does indeed need a 7 day jr pass , she 'd need it activated from the moment she leaves tokyo until she returns from kyoto , meaning days 3-9 ( though i would suggest [ against going to the fox village ] ( https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/attraction_review-g1023408-d7388189-reviews-miyagi_zao_fox_village-shiroishi_miyagi_prefecture_tohoku.html ) ) . 
  are you lindsay ? 
  if you 're going to be in kyoto until the 17th , leaving tokyo on the 3-4th , you would need a 14 day pass . 
  have in mind that the most expensive trip will be going from tokyo-kyoto and back , this is the trip you want covered by the jr pass . 
  even if you may not be using it all the time , a pass would be cheaper than going there and back twice . 
  you can generally use it in tokyo and on your other day trips anyway . 
  the path you 're talking about in himeji is called the [ senhime walkway ] ( https://ibb.co/f3qvak ) . 
  halfway through is a turn-off that leads to [ some backstreets ] ( https://tokyoanecdote.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/dscn8951.jpg?w=1536 ) and to senhime tenmangu shrine . 
  this is where senhime , the princess , prayed to from the sen tower of the castle because it can be seen from there . 
  it also offers [ great views ] ( https://ibb.co/j0vmi5 ) of the castle , btw . 
  to be fair , i lived in nz until i was 10 , my mum only spoke to me in catalan and i only learnt spanish once i moved to spain then . 
  i 've mostly just spoken spanish in spanish clases and with a few people here and there . 
  i lived in nz until i was 10 , my mum only spoke to me in catalan and i only learnt spanish once i moved to spain then , at school . 
  we spoke catalan in all classes other than spanish class at primary school , in eso there were quite a few teachers who preferred to teach in spanish but i still talked in catalan then anyway because they understood . 
  that looks great !, 
  i 'd never heard of them but i 'll add them to my trip . 
  i walked up and down and did n't notice a thing , it was very easy . 
  and i 'm definitely not fit , i do n't ever do any exercise . 
  i did do trail 6 though , perhaps that makes a difference . 
  true , the truck/car brings them almost to the top . 
  it 's just a couple minutes walk from there . 
  yeah , like u/xvapx said , it usually does n't matter . 
  most of the time i do n't process that they 're talking spanish instead of catalan so i just reply with whatever comes out first . 
  it 's not like english and spanish , these two languages are different and not often mixed in conversations , but i hear spanish and catalan together all the time . 
  exactly . 
  i 'm from spain , laws are different here than in the us . 
  * majority * , not everyone . 
  a sizeable amount of people do n't . 
  the results are at the end , once you 've taken the survey . 
  or all live in the same country . 
  the gun laws question makes no sense if we 're all thinking about different places .

  kaga onsen and awara onsen are the easiest stops since they are along the train line . 
  but if you have a bit more time i 'd make the effort to go out to [ yamanaka onsen ] ( https://www.yamanaka-spa.or.jp/global/eng/view3.html ) . 
  there you can visit [ kakusenkei gorge ] ( https://www.tripadvisor.es/attraction_review-g651648-d1448585-reviews-kakusenkei_gorge-kaga_ishikawa_prefecture_chubu.html ) and ioji temple and it 's a nice area . 
  technically [ nata-dera ] ( http://www.hot-ishikawa.jp/kanko/english/20078.html ) is also nearby but may be hard to get to if you have limited time . 
  yamanaka onsen is roughly a 30 minute bus ride ( 4 a day ) or a 20 minute taxi ( 3500 yen one way ) from kaga onsen station . 
  many of the nicer hotels also offer a return trip as a part of their package if you plan to stay the night . 
  which camera was it ? 
  i 'm thinking of getting a panasonic g7 for about the same price . 
  i did n't go to takeshita dori , i walked down omotesando and cat street instead . 
  are places mostly just for shopping . 
  as someone who does n't like shopping , i was so bored and it felt like a complete waste of time . 
  while the museum is well worth a visit even if it 's half-closed , note that there are [ many other peace-related sites ] ( https://tokyoanecdote.wordpress.com/2016/08/01/peace-sites-of-hiroshima/ ) in hiroshima also worth looking up if you have more time . 
  the more recent one is anxiety and princey . 
  but sterek is definitely the one i read most fics of . 
  * pau * in catalan means * peace * . 
  i thought it was the gay flag but apparently it 's [ the peace flag ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aldo_capitini#/media/file:bandiera_pace.jpg ) created by aldo capitini, 
  ps : the pau exams ( `` proves d'acc\u00e8s a la universitat '' , also known as la selectivitat ) is an exam we do here in spain after finishing high school to be able to get into university . 
  it 's like the a levels in the uk . 
  i do n't think the us household income counts as `` general knowledge '' for someone who 's not from the us . 
  that 's like asking someone the median spain household income ... 
   if you are between 18 and 35 years old and you have purchased at least one estee lauder beauty product in the last six months , you are eligible for this survey !, 
  please include this in the title of the survey as the demographic . 
  if you 're doing a survey about religion , you may want to either limit it to one specific religion or change a bit the questions to better include other religions . 
  for example , many religions do n't worship a god ( most noticeably buddhism , since it 's on the list ) which makes some questions hard to answer ; some people do n't go to church , they go to mosques , temples , shrines , synagogues , etc. 
  ; not all religions have a connection to the bible ... these are just some things i noticed looking through . 
  i 'm not a yearner , i have two extra pillows to keep me company !, 
  i would like to have more room to better explain my experiences . 
  as a girl , few guys ( i.e most of my bullies ) would 've dared to outright punch me , however i have been shoved many times , attacked by basketballs , people throwing pine cones and in one curious incident had someone throw an egg at me . 
  however , though i 've been involved in these physical attempts , most of the bullying was more of a passive-aggressive we 're - friends-sometimes-then-i 'll - humiliate-you kind of thing as well as other indirect things ( carving things onto desks , drawings , a guy pretending to have a crush on me , etc. ) . 
  i feel like by ticking both `` pysical '' and `` non-pysical '' boxes there is no place for me to get into details about what experiences were more important/hurt me more . 
  there is usually an assumption that if things get physical then it 's worse , but i think other situations offended me more . 
  also note that there were a couple other kids being bullied and if i felt unsafe it was usually because of something that had happened to someone else , not because of my own personal experiences . 
  in the end , there was a bully that did n't target me but i was more uncomfortable around him than my own bullies . 
  in catalan we call the weekend `` cap de setmana '' , meaning `` head of the week '' . 
  but in spanish they say `` fin de semana '' as in `` end of the week '' . 
  when i was learning spanish i kept saying `` cabo de semana '' and everyone thought it was hilarious . 
  i was helping r/spain with the flag , though i turned against my country once someone mentioned adding a bull and the sub decided they wanted to add a jam\u00f3n too . 
  beyond the basic `` please '' , `` thank you '' , etc. 
  i often use * oishikatta * when visiting restaurants , means `` the meal was delicious '' . 
  or * gochisousama deshita * instead , kind of like `` thanks for the meal '' . 
  knowing how to count is very easy to learn and also helpful . 
  the sentence i 've used the most though is definitely * shashin o totte itadakemasu ka ? 
  * ( can you take a photo of me ? ), 
  since i travel solo . 
  it 's true that there is a lot to see in each area , but that does n't mean one has to spend the entire trip in only one or two places . 
  i spent two weeks in tokyo on my first trip and there is still plenty i have n't seen there ... while it was a good trip , there are so many great places that i missed out on because i wanted to try and see `` everything '' tokyo had to offer . 
  in the end i just got fed up of staying in the same hostel for two weeks and later wished i 'd seen something different . 
  i felt like i was living there , not an `` amazing trip '' . 
  one thing is trying to see 15 temples in kyoto in two days and then doing hiroshima + miyajima another day and then wanting to go to takachiho the next day , that would be unreasonable . 
  however , someone who wants to spend a couple nights in an onsen in akita , then a few days in tokyo , then a few days in kyoto and a few days based in fukuoka doing day trips from there , then that is n't a horrible plan . 
  if someone has a jr pass then there really is n't that much time between places . 
  there was someone who said `` many things will catch your eye , but only a few will catch your heart '' . 
  it 's very cheesy , but it does help to decide what places to pick when you ca n't decide . 
  on my first trip to japan i spent two weeks in tokyo . 
  however , just before leaving i 'd read about [ takasaki ] ( https://tokyoanecdote.wordpress.com/2016/03/06/shorinzan-daruma-ji-temple-takasaki-%e9%ab%98%e5%b4%8e%e5%b8%82/ ) being the hometown of the daruma doll and simply knew that that would be the highlight of my trip . 
  there was no question that i would be visiting takasaki . 
  on my second trip i planned to go to kyoto , however i really wanted to go to hiroshima ( and could n't afford a jr pass ) , so i scrapped those plans and spent a week in hiroshima prefecture instead . 
  i do n't regret it at all . 
  i 'll soon be leaving for my third trip and the whole itinerary revolves around hiking the [ dewa sanzan ] ( https://www.google.es/search?q=dewa+sanzan&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewi1prqj-7_tahwfaxokht00axiq_auiccgb&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=589#imgrc=2zzcxousqzfe3m: ) and visiting hiraizumi and sekigahara . 
  what i mean is that you should just do whatever you want . 
  cool places are all over the place , including in or close to tokyo .
