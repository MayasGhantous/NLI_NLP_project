  unfortunately there 's always going to be something you miss out on ... 
  it is nice , i do n't know if it 's worth going all the way from tokyo though , considering it 's a very small city . 
  op , stop by [ ako ] ( https://www.odigo.jp/articles/3140-uncovering-the-47-ronins-true-story ) , [ mt.shosha ] ( https://www.odigo.jp/articles/2146-a-morning-at-mt-dot-shosha ) , etc. 
  if you 'll be going there !, 
  when i went to kurashiki there were quite a few people ( it was a regular sunday ) , so i think it 'd be quite popular on gw ... 
  i read somewhere that the least visited prefectures were shimane , yamagata , fukushima , fukui and tokushima . 
  i do n't know how true that is though , considering other places have mentioned kochi and tottori ... 
  there are buses going from tokyo to izumo , i think that visiting that area would be nice . 
  i second the * __ ni ikitai * . 
  very useful . 
  not at all . 
  some foreigners have asked for photos in return , but all are generally very happy to do a favour . 
  however , do n't expect them to take good photos haha ... try and ask people who carry a good camera , they usually know more about photography . 
  i 'm very excited to be spending a week there this june !, 
  i 'd guess they have a gift card or something . 
  i get gift cards for amazon japan that ca n't be used on amazon spain ... 
  there are only 16 countries that have a working holiday agreement with japan . 
  finland , italy , switzerland , greece , sweden , iceland , belgium , etc. 
  ca n't get holiday working visas either , so i would n't take it too personally . 
  spain is n't on the list either but last i heard we signed an agreement a couple of months ago , so we should be added soon . 
  portugal , poland , slovakia and austria 's agreements were done in 2015 and 2016 . 
  as you can see , it 's a fairly new thing for many . 
  perhaps the netherlands agreement is in the works or will get one in the future . 
  the netherlands is smaller in comparison , so it could be simply that there is less demand . 
  ( the dutch can get a regular working visa , by the way . ), 
  plus the cost of renting a car . 
  also note that slower trains can be considerably cheaper than the shinkansen . 
  i second the night buses though , if doing long distances i always use this . 
  using a bus pass , at the end of the trip it 's turned out to be just 1000-2000 yen altogether for three/four journeys ( of course the tickets are more expensive than that , but discounting what i 'd have paid for a night in a hostel those nights , it 's really a good price ) . 
  - in the country question i can only choose between australia , china , japan , korea , thailand , uk or us ... i live in none of those countries . 
  - weeaboo is a fairly american term , or at least used just in english-speaking countries . 
  such a term does not exist in my country so there is no distinction between weeaboo or otaku . 
  also , although being an otaku gives a sense of pride in many western countries , otaku is a negative term in japanese . 
  are we definining these terms from a us perspective or taking the real definition of otaku ? 
  - `` what cartoon titles do you enjoy thoroughly or have heard of ? '', 
  i think there is a bit of a step between * enjoy thoroughly * and * heard of * . 
  i 've heard of the simpsons , i do n't * enjoy * them . 
  knowing which titles i 've heard of is n't going to determine what `` amount '' of an animation fan i am , i 'm pretty sure most people here have heard of the simpsons or the powerpuff girls . 
  i have a profound hatred for black butler and somehow i 'm grouping it together with death note , mushishi and fullmetal alchemist . 
  - i think wall scrolls are popular with anime fans in the us ( and other countries ) but i 've only seen one being sold here in spain . 
  we have regular paper posters . 
  - have in mind that stereotypes and opinions people have on anime fans change depending on location . 
  here in spain , liking manga and anime is generally considered cool , or at least it is irrelevant . 
  i 've never heard anyone being shamed for liking it or even for being more obsessive . 
  i know many people who do/have watched and read series and it 's normal . 
  others have told me that france and italy are similar . 
  when going in june i usually bring t-shirts and one jumper for mornings/evenings/chilly days , but it should n't be cold enough to warrant much more than that . 
  i carry long jeans , usually i start wearing shorts in july . 
  and yeah , just an umbrella should be fine , you can buy one while there for cheap . 
  if you 're in kyoto on 7/7 , you might want to consider going to osaka later in the evening . 
  they do [ an event ] ( http://jpninfo.com/15040 ) next to the river where they throw in many blue balls/lights and it 's nice to see . 
  personally , this is the route i 'd do :, 
  - from osaka i 'd go to nachi station by train ( or kii-katsura station , nearby there is a restaurant called \u5927\u5c06\u95a3 that i hear does vegetarian food if asked ) . 
  from there you can start off by visiting nachi taisha . 
  - if you 've arrived early you can [ walk to koguchi ] ( http://www.tb-kumano.jp/en/kumano-kodo/nakahechi/ogumotori-goe/ ) ( or take a bus ) and stay there the night . 
  there are two places where you can sleep : [ minshuku momofuku ] ( http://www.kodoumomofuku.sakura.ne.jp/ ) ( 5200\u5186 no meals ) or [ shizen no ie ] ( http://koguchi-house.info/ ) ( 4420\u5186 no meals ) . 
  they * might * be able to make vegetarian meals if asked in advance . 
  there is a supermarket in koguchi but it 's a rural area so probably closes early and opens later . 
  - if you 've arrived later in the day , you can sleep around kii-katsura station , there are many options . 
  you can do the walk the next day and sleep in koguchi . 
  - the next day , [ walk from koguchi to hongu taisha ] ( http://www.tb-kumano.jp/en/kumano-kodo/nakahechi/kogumotori-goe/ ) and visit the shrine , onsen and stay there the night . 
  there is a [ vegan restaurant/guest house ] ( http://www.bonheurcompany.com/?mode=cate&amp;cbid=1718182&amp;csid=25 ) in the area , as well as many other sleeping options . 
  - the next day i 'd take an early morning bus to kumanogawa onsen and from there take [ a boat ride ] ( https://randomwire.com/yunomine-onsen-to-shingu/ ) down to hayatama taisha . 
  by mid-day you should be done and can get the train from shingu to wherever . 
  you can perfectly well stay in naha and nearby for three days and find plenty to do . 
  i do n't think a car is a necessity at all if staying close to the city , though if going further out you may have more problems . 
  about the vegetarianism , i usually like to look up places to eat beforehand so that i wo n't have to worry once there . 
  you can check https://www.happycow.net/ for vegan/vegetarian restaurants . 
  there are plenty in tokyo , kyoto , osaka and other big cities so you wo n't have to worry too much , the problem that i find is that they usually serve western food and so it can get boring or feel like you 're missing out on trying actual japanese food while there . 
  i usually splurge a little on lunches ( 1500 yen max for me ) which opens up options quite a bit , and then eat something cheap for breakfast/dinner . 
  i also reccommend you check out a channel called [ vegan in japan ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4oy9hqkmyu ) , they do some good reviews about places to eat . 
  make sure to stop for okonomiyaki if in hiroshima , it 's really nice , there are some that do vegetarian options like [ nagataya okonomiyaki ] ( http://nagataya-okonomi.com/en/menu.html ) . 
  hobbiton was fine for me . 
  my grandpa brought me there when i was a kid , it was probably low season or something but we were basically the only ones there . 
  the fox village in japan . 
  they look super cute in photos and unfortunately it 's becoming a popular place to visit , but they are n't treated well . 
  rabbit island ( okunoshima ) or one of the cat islands would be a better option if someone actually likes animals and cares about them . 
  also , owl caf\u00e9s and hedgehog caf\u00e9s are n't cool either . 
  they 're chained to a stool all day long ( owls are night animals too ) and do n't even like to be touched .

  `` how to pick tea '', 
  `` what are hot cheetos '', 
  `` prostitution laws in spain '', 
  `` time in myanmar '', 
  as for question 2 , osaka is the weird one . 
  as far as i know , the rest of the country stands on the left . 
  there are many theories as to why ; some say it 's because in the past edo ( tokyo ) had many samurai , who would 've preferred to be on the left so they could draw their swords easily , but osaka had many merchants instead ; others say it depends on which side people keep their wallets ; osaka held the expo '70 and adopted a western way of standing on the other side ... depends on who you ask . 
  as mentioned by u/titibu , you should n't have any problems getting around . 
  nikko is one of the most popular places to visit in japan ( usually done as a day trip form tokyo ) and they 're very used to having foreign tourists . 
  aizu-wakamatsu is less touristy , but still gets many english visitors all the same and there should be enough english for you to get around without problems . 
  the information centre likely has maps and pamphlets in english too and you can get [ a free guide ] ( http://www.tsurugajo.com/language/eng/v_index.html ) to show you around the castle . 
  i barely speak any japanese but even visiting off-the-beaten-path or rural places i 've hardly had any problems with language . 
  the train ticket machines may not have english options , but if you 've bought a ticket in tokyo or nikko you 'll already know how they work . 
  the process is the same and easy to handle even if you ca n't read exactly what the screen says . 
  however , i did have difficulties using buses my first few times because the system they use is quite different to what i 'm used to , so look up how to use buses in japan before going ( if you 'll be using a pass on the bus there should be no problems since you wo n't have to look at the screen and fare ) . 
  what kind of mountains are you planning on hiking ? 
  the amount of preparation needed will depend on the place . 
  leeches are n't much of a problem in japan . 
  they have planarias which i have seen , but they do n't bite people ( they eat worms ) , as well as mountain leeches . 
  though i have n't found any of these leeches in japan , i have been attacked by many leeches in thailand and when the guide took them off he did n't say anything about band-aids/bandages , however the point is to avoid the `` wound '' from getting infected so either bandaids or bandages should be better than nothing .
