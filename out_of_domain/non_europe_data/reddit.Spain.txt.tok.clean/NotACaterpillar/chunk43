  i 'd recommend getting the leech off you as soon as you find it , there 's no reason to keep it on you . 
  in thailand we used to squeeze them so they 'd let go , this is better than hurting the leech ( in that case , it may vomit and infect the bite ) . 
  you 're not supposed to crush it , btw , just squeeze gently . 
  the mountain leeches in japan look kind of like a bridge rather than a uniform slime , so you 'd have to squeeze both sides . 
  also clean the bite mark with soap and water once you get the opportunity . 
  it 's * very * unlikely you 'll see any leeches and there should be no problems unless you 're allergic or the bite gets infected/the leech gets somewhere dangerous . 
  ** bears : **, 
  the main island ( honshu ) and shikoku have asian black bears ( they are n't the same as american black bears ) and hokkaido , the northern island , also has ezo brown bears that are more aggressive . 
  i have a couple of bear bells that i use , i 'd say most hikers in japan use them . 
  any bell should work , really , it does n't have to be specifically designed for bears . 
  if you want to buy one in japan you could check montbell in shinjuku , tokyu hands or even 100 yen stores . 
  i used to hang them from my bag but they make little noise so i now tie them to my pants . 
  however , bears in japan are usually scared of humans and usually wo n't come near if they hear noise , that 's what the bells are for . 
  it 's usually better to talk so you can opt to sing to yourself if you like . 
  i have n't had any encounters but that 's not to say that there are none . 
  you should read about what to do if you encounter a bear just in case , though make sure the articles are talking specifically about bears in japan and not in other countries since attitudes vary by place and species . 
  they say bears come out most in early mornings and evenings , so you can always start the hike a bit later in the day ( like 10am ) to feel a bit safer . 
  make sure to look around you too , looking at the ground while walking is pretty common and if there is a bear close by you may get closer accidentaly because you did n't see it . 
  ** others : **, 
  japan has ** wild pigs ** . 
  i have n't seen any in japan but since i live in the forest in spain i see them every week here . 
  many people are scared of them but honestly i 'd rather see a boar than a bear ten times over . 
  a bear bell should also scare them away , if you do get close you 'll want to get past quickly ( but do n't run ) or turn around if they 're on the trail . 
  they mostly do their own thing and usually only charge if they have kids with them or they think you 're a threat . 
  if they do charge ... i do n't know , climb a tree or something . 
  be careful you do n't step on any ** snakes ** , i 'd say that 's the most likely thing you 'll find ( i 've almost stepped on one myself ) . 
  ** hornets ** ( * osuzumebachi * ) are common , but they 're less scary once you 've seen a few and though they 're bigger than wasps and bees and more aggressive , you should only have problems if they feel attacked or if you get close to their hive . 
  if you are stung , you should probably get someone to look at it though , people do die every year because of them . 
  wasps in general usually follow currents of air , so if there is one too close for comfort then make sure you walk away slowly/normally ; do n't run away because then the hornet will follow you and the current of air you 've created when running . 
  i also heard they like black , so any colour clothes other than black would be better , though i 've only heard this once and wear black many times when hiking anyway . 
  giant ** centipedes ** ( * mukade * ) also exist , though they 're most common during the rainy season . 
  do n't touch them . 
  i 'm not a plant expert but have n't had any problems . 
  the ** gear ** and other recommendations would depend on where you 're going hiking . 
  mount mitoku in tottori is pretty different to gassan in yamagata . 
  personally , i would n't worry too much . 
  it always sounds scarier than it actually is . 
  honestly , the worst problem i 've had with wildlife in japan was finding a big spider in the shower . 
  why do you want to stay on honshu ? 
  getting to kyushu and shikoku is just a short train ride ( or walking/cycling ) . 
  also , what are your interests ? 
  [ this one ] ( https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1901103/1/slam-dunk-conquer-the-nation ) ? 
  i 'm from spain so i 'm confused by any other education system !, 
  here we have primary school ( ages 6-12 ) and secondary school ( called eso , ages 12-16 ) . 
  then people can drop out if they want . 
  some others go on to * m\u00f2duls * to study something specific ( marqueting , it , sports , etc. ), 
  or to * batxillerat * for something more general ( social , cientific , technology , humanistic or artistic ) . 
  batxillerat is just two years , then we do a big exam ( la selectivitat ) to be able to get into university ( 18 + ) . 
  those who do m\u00f2duls have to do four years but can get into uni without doing the exam . 
  in the us their `` college experience '' is very different to ours because they sleep in dorms/away from home , and thus have many more parties than what spanish uni students have . 
  in spain sleeping in a dorm/away from home is quite rare unless you come from a town to study in the city or are studying abroad or something . 
  in the us they also have things like prom , graduation parties , sports events and i still do n't really know what homecoming is ( they vote for king and queen ?!, 
  train would definitely be cheaper than renting a car ( considering that renting a car would be around 5000 yen/day , plus the costs for toll roads and parkings ) , but have in mind that train and bus connections in the aizu area are n't as frequent as the ones in tokyo . 
  you can check out a pass like the [ jr east pass ] ( http://www.jreast.co.jp/e/eastpass_t/index.html ) , [ yuttari aizu free pass ] ( http://jp-traveler.blogspot.com.es/2011/01/aizu-romantic-travel.html ) or passes for the [ nikko area ] ( http://www.tobu.co.jp/foreign/en/pass/all.html ) . 
  honestly , i 'd pass on both the [ owl caf\u00e9 ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/japantravel/comments/5zz0up/opinion_on_owl_cafes/ ) and maid caf\u00e9 . 
  a day trip to matsue and gifu from sendai/tokyo are terrible ideas , especially considering matsue is at the other side of the country and would take hours to get to from tokyo , let alone if coming from sendai . 
  both would make better day trips from kyoto . 
   what amount of time do you usually spend on social media per day ? 
  perhaps you should include 3-4h a day . 
  you skip from 2 to 5 + . 
  i do n't know why people keep saying to book hotels 6 months in advance . 
  that may be the case if it 's high season , but in all my trips i 've done the booking under a month in advance , even on the spot sometimes , and have never had a problem . 
  note that they said the trip is in july/august . 
  apparently the whole castle lifted up and reached the rooftop of the building but [ they 're still investigating ] ( http://cat.elpais.com/cat/2017/05/07/catalunya/1494170105_573492.html ) why this happened . 
  seven kids were thrown off , one of them dead , the others with more or less injuries . 
  [ tanabata festival ] ( http://jpninfo.com/15040 ) is big , i 'd recommend spending the day in kyoto at many different shrine events and then going to osaka in the evening for the river lights event . 
  you can check [ japanvisitor ] ( http://www.japanvisitor.com/japanese-festivals/festival-june ) for other festivals . 
  in nagoya they have a second hand market on the 18th and 28th every month , it includes mochi pounding at bansh\u014d-ji temple . 
  i would n't really recommend climbing mt.fuji so early in the climbing season though , unless you are an experienced hiker . 
  there is still a high probablility of bad weather at the summit and i 've known a few people who 've had to turn around almost near the top . 
  july 9-10 might be better though . 
  they are two different buses . 
  one bus goes from tsuruoka  hagurosan  gassan ( not all buses go to gassan ) . 
  a different bus will take you from the yudonosan parking lot ( there is a shuttle bus between the shrine and parking , but it 's only a short walk anyway ) to tsuruoka , they are even more infrequent though . 
  they depart from yudonosan at 11:00 , 13:30 and 16:45 . 
  as you have said , unless you have a car or are very fit , doing all three in one day is highly difficult . 
  i do know of people who 've taken the first bus of the day to mt.haguro , walked up , taken the first bus that goes to gassan and managed to reach yudono-san just in time for the last bus , however this was someone who was quite fit and another who 'd just finished hiking the shikoku henro by foot ( meaning , very fit ) . 
  most people decide to sleep in haguro town overnight and split the trail over two days , although you 'd still have to do gassan and yudonosan together the second day which is the hard part . 
  i 'd recommend sleeping on gassan , there are three places to choose from on the mountain :, 
  - \u6708\u5c71\u795e\u793e \u4e2d\u4e4b\u5bae \u5fa1\u7530\u539f\u795e\u793e ( 4500 yen ) - next to midagahara shrine , the first rest stop . 
  they have no website but you may be able to contact [ tsuruoka 's official site ] ( http://www.dewasanzan.jp/publics/index/3/ ) to make the booking . 
  - [ \u6708\u5c71\u4e5d\u5408\u76ee\u4ecf\u751f\u6c60\u5c0f\u5c4b ] ( http://bussyouike.travel.coocan.jp/syukuhaku.htm ) ( 4300 yen ) - at the 9th station , just past half way up . 
  they only accept bookings by phone , but perhaps one of your other hotels can help you out and do it for you . 
  - [ \u6708\u5c71\u9802\u4e0a\u5c0f\u5c4b ] ( http://www5c.biglobe.ne.jp/~gassan/index.html/ ) ( 6000 yen ) - right next to the summit . 
  they also only accept reservation by phone , but they have a form on their website anyway . 
  ( prices do n't include meals , though they are available for some 2000 yen extra . ), 
  alternatively you could sleep at [ yudono-san ] ( http://www.dewasanzan.jp/publics/index/77/ ) and catch the bus the next morning . 
  i 'll be doing the dewa sanzan a few days after you !, 
  i 'll be visiting tsuruoka first ( nangaku-ji temple ) but taking the 9:45 or 10:40 am bus to haguro zuishinmon . 
  there i 'll visit the ideha museum which talks about dewa sanzan and shugendo , doing the walk up to the shrine and taking the last bus of the day to gassan ( 14:05 ) . 
  then i 'm sleeping at the second rest hut and will be seeing the sunrise early next morning , completing the visit to all three shrines and hopefully managing to catch the 13:30 bus from yudono-san so i have time to see a couple more sites in tsuruoka before they close ( and local trains are infrequent in yamagata , if i want to reach my hostel before 9pm that night i 'll have to leave tsuruoka at around 5pm ) . 
  even though i have n't done the trail yet , i 've been reading a lot about it so if you have any questions feel free to ask me !, 
  there are [ a few others ] ( https://www.odigo.jp/articles/2936-discounts-for-travelling-around-tohoku ) in tohoku too . 
  happy cake day !, 
  i 'd recommend opening google maps and pinpointing all the places you 've all been to ( because there are four of you , if you want you can choose four colours ) . 
  then you 'll see the large amount of places none of you have covered . 
  happy cake day , by the way !, 
  i 'm surprised by the chewing gum question , the people who chew it for only 10min or until the flavour is gone must go through chewing gums really fast . 
  if you 're looking for people who like and know about backpacks , you could try r/onebag or r/backpacking . 
  do i have to be bisexual / a lesbian to fill it in , or would any general lgbt member count ?
