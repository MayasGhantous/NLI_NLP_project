  a few . 
  the one that comes to mind was a sterek mpreg fic . 
  i do n't usually read mpreg ( or really anything that includes pregnancy ) but the description was catchy so i thought i might as well give it a try . 
  i was glad i did because it turned out to be truly amazing !, 
  i could n't finish it all in one day because it was pretty long , so i was sitting through classes and awake at night wanting to continue reading . 
  i learnt a lot about pregnancy too haha . 
  happy cake day !, 
  happy cake day !, 
  many places claim to be the birthplace of the maneki-neko , but truth is it is n't really known . 
  if someone is interested in them they can visit tokoname , the place that produces most maneki-nekos in japan . 
  the only temple/shrine i 've visited that was crowded was meiji shrine ( i visited senso-ji at 7am , so that was quiet ) . 
  all others have been basically empty . 
  the trick is to go early or when it 's raining . 
  it 's true that i have n't been to kyoto though . 
  i 'll be going there for a couple days later this year on my third trip , really just to visit fushimi inari and kibune & kurama . 
  and wash your own plates , do n't leave them in the sink for someone else to do it . 
  this is the most common mistake i see . 
  their website 's faq says no . 
  because you made a reservation and did n't cancel it , they could n't sell that seat to someone else , that 's why you still need to pay in the case of no-show . 
  there are many , but what exactly are you looking to do there ? 
  simply relax in a ryokan for a few days ? 
  a place with good hiking trails ? 
  historical towns or sites ? 
  is it simply a day trip from another place you 'll be visiting , or do you wish to spend more time there ? 
  i could give you suggestions if i knew more details about what you 're looking for ... 
  [ fukiya furusato ] ( https://www.google.es/search?q=tokoname&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjxyfo0q5dtahuetbqkhuwodomq_auiccgb&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=589#tbm=isch&amp;q=fukiya+furusato ) may be a good option , together with nearby bitchu-takahashi . 
  you can sleep halfway between the two , i recommend [ uji irodori ] ( http://uji-irodori.info/%e5%85%83%e4%bb%b2%e7%94%b0%e9%82%b8%e3%81%8f%e3%82%89%e3%82%84%e3%81%97%e3%81%8d/ ) . 
  or the noto and izu peninsulas , fukui or niigata prefectures in general and anywhere in shikoku ( oku iya is many people 's favourite , but since it 's quite remote few people actually make it there ) . 
  mine was 7.7 . 
  i hope you realize that different countries have different grading systems . 
  gpa in many european countries is out of 10 , not on a 4 or 5 scale like in the us . 
  wow !, 
  so much work went into that !, 
  it 's interesting to see the changes in which terms people prefer to use over time . 
  i 'll look out for the survey next year so i can also participate ... 
  i 'm from spain , also really scared of spiders and not really used to seeing big ones . 
  however , i only saw one spider on my first trip to japan , at mt.takao , so i 'd say you should be fine visiting tokyo , kyoto , kamakura , osaka , nara , hiroshima , etc. 
  i only come across them when hiking or when visiting smaller towns . 
  i really like darumas and took a day trip to their hometown some two hours north of tokyo , spending a day visiting daruma stores , workshops and the daruma temple . 
  of course , if you do n't care about darumas , going out of your way to do this may be a bit pointless . 
  - a mochi from a market in hiroshima ( inside the bus center ) , wrapped up in a leaf . 
  it was so different to all the mochis i 'd tried before . 
  very comfortable . 
  - as for experiences : [ the boat ride in kurashiki ] ( https://tokyoanecdote.wordpress.com/2016/07/25/boat-ride-down-kurashikis-canal/ ) and entrance to a kagura show in [ hiroshima ] ( https://tokyoanecdote.wordpress.com/2016/08/13/a-different-side-of-hiroshima/ ) . 
  [ mt.shosha ] ( https://tokyoanecdote.wordpress.com/2016/07/13/a-morning-at-mt-shosha/ ) is also one of my favourite places . 
  i bought some in a 100 yen store . 
  i saw many of them in souvenir shops near tourist spots and many big 100 yen stores should have them too . 
  i also went to a giant kannon statue which was actually really cool , [ a cave ] ( https://tokyoanecdote.wordpress.com/2016/03/06/shorinzan-daruma-ji-temple-takasaki-%e9%ab%98%e5%b4%8e%e5%b8%82/ ) and some gardens nearby . 
  you can go to a place like \u5ca1\u7530\u3060\u308b\u307e\u5e97 , \u56f2\u821e\u9054\u78e8\u672c\u8217 or \u4eca\u4e95\u3060\u308b\u307e\u5e97 to see the darumas being made ( look those up on google maps for their location ) . 
  there 's a list of workshops [ here ] ( http://takasakidaruma.net/gallery02.html ) . 
  i kind of just showed up without any clue of how to get around or what i wanted to see because my planning skills back then were below pathetic , i definitely have to return one day to see many of the things i forgot or did n't know about ( mt.haruna especially ) . 
  takasaki and gunma in general are amazing , i really recommend spending a day or two in the prefecture to anyone who 's looking to go to a more off-the-beaten-path place near tokyo without any tourists , to try out some onsens or for some hiking/nature . 
  i gave you a fake name ... 
  i went to japan solo for the first time when i was 19 , second time when i was 20 and looking forward to my third solo trip later this year ( also female , by the way ) . 
  i think i enjoyed going solo much more than i would if i 'd had company !, 
  going solo means i can go at my own pace , wake up early , eat whatever i want and especially visit the places i want to visit . 
  i know few people who would be interested in visiting 10 castles on one trip ... i 've never gotten any strange looks for being alone , but have in mind that some ryokans ( traditional inns ) do n't allow solo guests . 
  that is really the only problem i 've found . 
  i 'm sure you 'll have a great time !, 
  if you worry about feeling lonely you can always meet people in hostels or post for a meet-up somewhere . 
  depends where exactly . 
  i 've found that the countryside spots have little demand and it 's much easier to book closer to the date . 
  especially in june , most of the countryside dorms i 've stayed at i 've been the only person there . 
  however , it does depend on the definition of countryside . 
  i would n't book a place like nikko , kamakura , shirakawa-go , kinosaki onsen or mt.fuji last minute , though these are rural or small cities , they are popular tourist spots . 
  it 's a good idea to check out cities and towns near bigger tourism cities too ; hiroshima could be full but onomichi , iwakuni or fukuyama would have options . 
  kyoto books out quickly , but i 've shown up at a hostel in himeji the same day i wanted to stay ( in june ) and had no problems . 
  there are many blogs from people who 've done the dewa sanzan ( like [ here ] ( https://thecupandtheroad.com/2016/05/21/dewa-sanzan-how-to-get-there-hiking-info/ ) , [ here ] ( https://jerfareza.com/2016/09/07/climbing-three-holy-mountains-of-dewa-sanzan/ ) and [ here ] ( http://nyaraka.hatenablog.com/entry/2017/01/18/145241 ) ) and websites that talk about it from an informational point of view ( [ here ] ( http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e7904.html ) , [ here ] ( http://wikitravel.org/en/dewa_sanzan#get_around ) , [ here ] ( http://data.yamagatakanko.com/english/sightseeing/dewasanzan.html ) ) . 
  was this inspired by glisa 's video ? 
  i felt like the phrasing of some of the sentences made it seem like europeans have to suck up to what trump says and the us . 
  however , i think it 's a two way street , it 's important that we get along well but we 're not going to `` abide to trump 's wishes '' just because he 's powerful . 
  the questions were too one-sided to express that it 's a mutual thing . 
  if you want europeans ' full opinions , perhaps leave a space to write or add to the statements to make sure the opinions are properly understood . 
  rarely does a survey that only asks basic questions collect the actual complexity of people 's way of thinking . 
  ( also , migrant \u2260 refugee , it might be a good idea to separate the two into two different questions since results may vary . ), 
   did jesus have a sinless life ? 
  the concept of `` sin '' is hard to define if god does n't exist . 
  because i do n't believe in a god , i do n't believe in sin ( i.e. 
  `` an immoral act considered to be a transgression against divine law '' ) , i believe there is no `` divine law '' to abide to and hence a transgression is not possible . 
  jesus did n't have a sinless life , he did n't have a sinfull life either ; sin simply does n't exist . 
  i went to odaiba just to visit miraikan , which i really did like , as well as riding the yurikamome and himiko boat . 
  fujitv is fine for views , but the rest is really just shopping . 
  i like sanjusangendo because i like kannon , that 's the only reason i went , but i do think the price is steep for just one building with not much to see . 
  i 'm going to kawagoe this june so i can try their sweet potato specialities ( imokoi , gyoza , udon ) as well as the castle , kita-in and comparing the kura architecture to the buildings in kurashiki . 
  i hear there are also some interesting small museums ( kurazukuri museum , the city museum ) and small shrines for anyone who has more time . 
  i 'm pairing it together with omiya 's bonsais though . 
  i guess it depends on how much one is interested in that kind of place . 
  i think it 's fine , but it was way too crowded to be properly enjoyable for me . 
  if someone is going to tokyo but not kyoto and wants to see someone in traditional clothing , then oedo onsen is a good idea , but for a quiet and `` real '' onsen experience in the area i 'd go to chofu instead . 
  purple udon , i think it has a sweet potato flavour , is speciality of saitama prefecture os a whole ( i 've seen it in other places like kasukabe ) , while imokoi and gyoza are more the speciality of famous stores in the area . 
  i 've heard there are also many mochi and dango with sweet potato flavour . 
  sometimes it 's best to look up food each place is known for online beforehand because few places advertise them properly . 
  for example , toyama prefecture wins the spot for most kombu consumption in the entire country every year , by far , and they have many dishes including kelp ( as well as kombu mochi and kombu bread ) , but a foreign visitor probably would n't know this unless they specifically look it up ... because i really like mochi i like to try all local variations , i always look up unique flavours in every region . 
  i 'm looking forward to kawagoe 's imokoi !, 
  what other shrines did you visit there ? 
  i have a few planned by they are all very small and i do n't think they 'd sell goshuin . 
  it may be a good idea to find a hostel in the area . 
  this way , instead of dedicating daylight hours to it you can visit in the evenings once you 've returned from a day of sightseeing elsewhere . 
  i agree , but i just really dislike crowds . 
  i felt like i 'd seen the temple in photos a hundred times anyway and having visited plenty of amazing temples in japan already , kinkakuji did n't stand out .
