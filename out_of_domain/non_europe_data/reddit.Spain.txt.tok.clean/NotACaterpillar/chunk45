  as a huge castle nerd , i have to disagree . 
  himeji castle is fine , but there is hardly anything on display , no proper information about the castle and too many crowds , plus an expensive entree fee . 
  himeji castle was n't even historically important . 
  osaka castle was one of the best castles i 've visited in terms of displays and historical relevance . 
  it 's true it 's not an original but it wins extra points as a castle museum . 
  if someone just wants to visit one castle to see what they looked like , then himeji is a good option , but for those wanting to learn about castle life and history , osaka would be much better . 
  it 's okay . 
  i would n't pay 1000 yen for it though . 
  other places also have good views . 
  true , i 've seen many rock gardens in japan , i 'm not going to pay an entry fee to visit a crowded temple that offers me nothing i have n't seen before . 
  ah , i went there at 7am , [ totally empty ] ( http://i.imgur.com/c1zavqz.jpg ) and had the place for myself . 
  after visiting a few sites in asakusa i walked past again on my way back to the station at 10am and it was already too crowded for me . 
  i did go at opening time , arrived just a couple minutes after they opened and there was no line . 
  i was there during low season too . 
  but people come in quickly and do n't stop to look around much , so by the time i was on the third floor i was stuck behind a line of people going up the stairs and just wanted to get out . 
  i had a guide too , he picked me up at the entrance . 
  that was probably the down point of the visit . 
  he was a great guide that explained a lot but as someone who wants to look at tiny details slowly and really take in the place i thought he was going way too fast . 
  i always try to avoid guides . 
  that 's what i was thinking . 
  i really do n't want to look at people make out , same sex or otherwise . 
   the cookie part of the oreo is better than the filling . 
  as someone who takes apart the oreos and have eaten a huge pile of the filling by itself , i can say that the filling is nicer but does n't taste that good solo . 
  the two together taste better than either one by itself . 
  i ca n't speak much about other people 's opinions or experiences , but i can say my own , living here in catalunya . 
  there are n't actually that many marroquies living here , of course i see them often enough and there were quite a few in high school , but it 's been a while since i 've actually talked to any . 
  my best friend in high school was marroqu\u00ed , he was honestly one of the nicest people i 've ever known and still to this day , even though we have n't seen each other in years , think that he 's the model example of what `` good '' means . 
  but he was often bullied and got into quite a few fights with other people ( half the time with other marroquies too ) . 
  the moroccan girls had a better time , some of them were actually quite popular , but the ones that were n't definitely got racist comments too ( another close friend of mine was the only girl at school who llevaba un hijab , y la gente le preguntaba siempre por qu\u00e9 lo llevaba y si eso quer\u00eda decir que ya ten\u00eda la regla , etc. ), 
  because these are the two moroccans i 've been closest to , my personal opinion on marroc is quite high and i even considered learning the language , but i do n't think most other people have them in such high esteem . 
  i think that moroccans have it quite a bit harder than spaniards and are n't treated with much respect in the `` adult world '' either . 
  once i was given a fake 20 euro note by someone and when a store refused it i pocketed it to show it to my family ( my mum really likes seeing fake money since returning from china ) . 
  i was with a friend at the time and we went to buy some cocacola in a moroccan 's s\u00faper and she told me to pay with the fake money because the guy `` probably had a lot of it anyway '' . 
  it 's this kind of casual racism that is common . 
  i do n't think most people do it on purpose , most probably do n't even realise it 's racist , but that does n't excuse the behaviour anyway . 
  i always travel at that time of the year because it 's my favourite . 
  though it does n't have the crowds that other months have , esp . 
  spring , popular sites still have crowds all the same . 
  i went to the hiroshima peace museum and i had to stand in line at the doors waiting for opening time along with the rest who thought it would n't be crowded at 8:30 am ( it was ) . 
  harajuku 's omotesando was quite crowded on the weekday i was there but the side streets were okay . 
  i 've never been to the ghibli museum or kyoto , so i ca n't say much about that . 
  the most crowded places i 've been to were kamakura , especially hasedera , though i was at the daibutsu at around 10am so the crowds were n't fully there yet ( the hiking trails would have many people , i 'm glad i started at 7am or i would n't 've liked it ) ; osaka castle ( worse than himeji castle when i was there ) ; and the mentioned peace museum/shibuya-harajuku . 
  the best way to avoid crowds is to go early in the morning , many people do n't like to wake up early ( by early i mean go before 10 ) or visit the outside places like temples while it 's raining . 
  people flock to museums and inside areas when it 's raining , so places like the tokyo national museum would be chaos , but the rest of ueno park totally empty . 
  i 'm going castle hopping this june and will be visiting hikone ( as well as gifu , ogaki , nagoya and inuyama , and sekigahara ) . 
  i 'm looking forward to it since i 've only heard great things !, 
  no , you 'll definitely be able to get in , but the inside will likely have quite a few people . 
  me neither . 
  i read the comments before taking the survey , that 's why i knew what it was . 
  kibune and kurama you mentioned is a nice and easy hike , i 'd recommend that one . 
  perhaps try ** mt.misen ** on miyajima , [ ** mt.shosha ** ] ( https://tokyoanecdote.wordpress.com/2016/07/13/a-morning-at-mt-shosha/ ) near himeji , ** mt.rokko ** from kobe ( you can stop by nunobiki falls ) , ** sandankyo gorge ** from hiroshima ... 
  thomas sanders ' prince x anxiety, 
  i had caring as my highest ( i think ? 
  i 've already forgotten ) . 
  honest and loyal last ... 
  do be careful in spain then . 
  i 'm from barcelona and some people are sneaky , especially on metros and if you look like a tourist . 
  i 'd recommend not leaving your passport in the small pockets , put it somewhere harder to access . 
  i recommend quinta da regaleira . 
  have n't been there myself but i 've seen some cool photos . 
  some say that hostels can be found anywhere all over the country ... but this is n't really true . 
  they focus around big cities popular with tourists , meaning tokyo , kyoto , nara , hiroshima , osaka , etc. 
  have many ( and cheaper ) hostels to pick from but go elsewhere and you 'll have a limited choice beyond the capitals of each prefecture ( and even then there may be just a couple ) . 
  however , sometimes there are hostels in the middle of a rural area that can serve as a stop for the night along the way . 
  in this case , expect to meet few other travellers , there are n't many people in rural places . 
  as someone who prefers to visit rural japan over bigger cities ( i still have n't been to kyoto ) , i 've had hostel dorms to half the time . 
  my favourite region to travel around is tohoku , north of tokyo . 
  consider staying at [ matsushima ] ( http://www.uchi-matsushima.com/ ) or sendai , visit hiraizumi ( no hostels there , but doable as a trip from sendai ) , [ hirosaki ] ( http://www.jyh.or.jp/e/i.php?jyhno=1118 ) , the dewa sanzan , kakunodate , aizu and yamadera ... my favourite acommodation of tohoku is [ komeyakata guesthouse ] ( http://komeyakata-gh.wixsite.com/komeyakataguesthouse/home-english ) . 
  they helped me book a few things since i ca n't speak japanese and they were great . 
  you can also try [ seki-juku ] ( http://ishigakiya.tyonmage.com/ ) , [ izumo ] ( http://guesthouse-itoan.com/ ) and [ matsue ] ( http://younginn.net/ ) , bitchu-takahashi , the shimanami kaido , kurashiki . 
  another of my favourites was [ guest house kominkaen ] ( http://gh.kominka-en.com/ ) . 
  if you want somewhere closer to tokyo , i recommend [ guest house kamejikan ] ( http://kamejikan.com/en ) in kamakura , there were many people there and it was a great ambience ( they have the most amazing shower too ! ), 
  or spending the night in [ nikko ] ( https://www.staynikko.com/english/gallery/ ) . 
  it would be easier to know which places you want to visit and find places nearby . 
  that hostel is a 10min walk from kuroiso station , but it 's true that to get to nasu onsen one would have to take a bus ( [ here ] ( http://www.nasuonsen.com/access/pdf/20170403085838827.pdf ) 's the timetable by the way ) . 
  nasu onsen is really nice , i also recommend it , it 's actually quite famous for having [ sessh\u014dseki ] ( https://www.google.es/search?q=%e6%ae%ba%e7%94%9f%e7%9f%b3&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjd5akiminuahvforqkhuw7dc0q_auicigb&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=589 ) ( matsuo basho stopped here on his trip to the north ) . 
  i went solo when i was 19 , never had any problems . 
  - your plane ticket might be cheaper than that if you look well . 
  i 'm from barcelona and have paid around 550 $ roundtrip every year ( for june ) , this year i 'm paying 573 $ . 
  i use kayak to compare prices , but there are other websites too ( momondo , skyscanner , hipmunk , airfarewatchdog ... i do n't book through kayak though , it can be cheaper to buy straight from the airline company ) . 
  - you likely wo n't need a jr pass for two weeks , one week might be okay depending on the itinerary . 
  have in mind that you do n't need a jr pass for when in tokyo , as the pass pays off when doing long distance journeys via shinkansen ( moving around inside tokyo is n't expensive ) . 
  there are also buses going to mt.fuji which are generally easier and cheaper than taking the train anyway . 
  this will be clear when you have the itinerary more clearly sorted out . 
  - imho , ishinomaki is quite boring . 
  visiting the cat island is fine but if you want to spend two days up there i 'd recommend sleeping in sendai or matsushima instead . 
  and yes , the tohoku shinkansen is free with a jr pass . 
  3500yen a day for food is quite a bit of money . 
  personally , i spend 1500-2000 yen a day and would n't say it 's difficult . 
  i 'd recommend buying something cheap for breakfast ( around 500 yen at most is what i do ) , eat at a nice place during lunch ( for some 1500 yen it can be quite easy to find a really good place to eat , of course no high class sushi but that 's already about double what the average ramen would cost ) and find a quiet local place for dinner . 
  i think people going to suwa go there to see the shape of the lake rather than the village itself . 
  i do n't think it 's worth going out there only to see this ( because it is just a lake ) , but combined with a visit to matsumoto and suwa grand shrine , it can be worth a detour . 
  about the plane , it 's generally cheaper to fly in and out of the same airport rather than buy an open-jaw ticket like the one you mention . 
  i think flying in and out of different airports does save quite a bit of money if only visiting tokyo-osaka areas , this way a jr pass is n't necessary since you 'll only be using the shinkansen once , but for someone doing a route like op this likely would n't pay off ( price-wise at least , it might save a bit of time by avoiding the journey back to tokyo ) . 
  on my first trip i spent two weeks in tokyo , many other people do the same , but personally i wish i 'd spent time elsewhere . 
  three to five days i think is a good amount to get the basics covered . 
  if op gets sick of tokyo they can always do a nearby day trip to get out of the city ( such as kamakura ) . 
  [ here 's what i spent ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/japantravel/comments/4sc50s/budget_breakdown_from_my_recent_trip/ ) , by the way . 
  i know of [ hirosaki youth hostel ] ( http://www.jyh.or.jp/e/i.php?jyhno=1118 ) and [ kawayo farm ] ( http://www.kawayo.com/73065/%e5%ae%bf%e6%b3%8a/?lang=en ) , just above hachinohe . 
  apart from that , you 'd have to resort to hotels .
