  also , it 's not quite 45min , you have to count the time it takes to get to the airport , a bit of extra `` just in case '' time while waiting at the airport , plus the time it takes to get from the second airport to the city/hotel , and of course the costs for onland transportation of the train to get to and from the airport in the first place . 
  i 'm not saying that flying is bad . 
  the shinkansen is n't bad either . 
  but many seem to think the jr pass is a trump all card that is the best way to travel around japan , ignoring that it also has negative things ( namely , the cost ) . 
  i just wanted to make sure op knows that there are other options that may ( or may not ) suit their needs and wishes better if necessary . 
  bullfighting is much more controversial than the spanish flag . 
  the spanish flag is n't really offensive , but i do personally associate an overly nationalistic feeling when someone waves one around ( flags in general , not just the spanish flag ) . 
  there 's nothing wrong with bringing one yourself though , it 's an easy way to symbolise a country . 
  as u/kaitybubbly said , nagoya does n't have the best reputation when it comes to tourism , but it does make a good base if you 're interested in visiting nearby spots ( magome/tsumago , toyota factory tour , hikone , korankei , plus other places already mentioned by others ) . 
  i think spending a day in nagoya could be nice if you 're interested in history though , their castle is scheduled to be torn down and reconstructed by 2022 , so we 'll only be able to visit the main keep until november this year . 
  if you want to ever see the castle as is , now is the time . 
  i also think japan-guide has a lot of something i find boring : shopping . 
  i 'm not religious at all but i really love temples and shrines ( mostly for the architecture and cultural aspect of them ) , japan-guide does usually talk about the most famous ones that have an entrance fee though , while there are hundreds that are free that i 've enjoyed more . 
  but it is written by people who have their own opinions and preferances , it 's obvious that it ca n't be perfect for everyone . 
  this is what i was going to say , perhaps the biggest `` flaw '' of the plan . 
  kyoto and osaka are so close it does n't make much sense to change base from one to the other . 
  op , i also think you 're focusing a lot on the big three famous cities but missing out on a number of other sites and places that are less touristy and definitely worth a visit too . 
  with 2-3 months , i 'd definitely try to get out and see a bit more of the country !, 
  i spent two weeks in tokyo for my first trip , and while tokyo is great i really wished i 'd done more day trips . 
  i 'd recommend visiting the best temples and shrines from each different city you visit rather than visiting many in one place just because you 're there and skipping others elsewhere . 
  tokyo is n't really known for temples and shrines , many are n't even comparable to those from other cities . 
  in any case , kyoto would be where you 'll be visiting most . 
  i went to kamakura instead of kyoto on my first trip , as a two-day trip from tokyo , and i felt that it offered me all the shrines and temples i wanted to see . 
  you can also consider nikko or kawagoe nearby too . 
  why exactly do you want to spend 2-3 weeks in osaka though ? 
  there is n't * that * much to do . 
  you 'll probably be spending most of your time doing trips to other cities ( nara , himeji , kobe , mt.koya , etc. ), 
  which does n't really matter if you do them from kyoto or osaka . 
  my skepticism comes mostly from spending so much time in osaka , really . 
  it would depend on the day trip you have planned though . 
  what i would do , personally , with that amount of time in japan :, 
  - two weeks in tokyo ( including a few day trips to places nearby ) . 
  - bus to sendai and spend at least a week exploring the north ( sendai , matsushima , yamadera , hiraizumi , an onsen , etc. ) . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.odigo.jp/articles/2936-discounts-for-travelling-around-tohoku ) 's a list of tohoku discounts , btw . 
  - from this point , either buy a jr pass ( one week or two weeks ) and hit up many of the places mentioned ( kanazawa , shirakawa-go , hiroshima , nagano , etc. ), 
  or get a [ bus pass ] ( http://willerexpress.com/st/3/en/pc/buspass/ ) if you want something cheaper . 
  i do n't think one week of moving around will tire you out too much if you later take it easy and stay in one place for a while . 
  - 2-3 weeks in and around kyoto/osaka . 
  - possibly 1-2 weeks on either kyushu or shikoku island . 
  i know you do n't really want to buy a jr pass , and i do think it 's possible to travel to japan without one ( i 've never used one myself ) , but it would be hard to find cheap doable day trips if you want to use a city as base . 
  if you plan to do many day trips , it 's going to add up very very quickly . 
  for referance , i spent two weeks travelling between osaka and hiroshima ( visiting places such as himeji and [ mt.shosha ] ( https://tokyoanecdote.wordpress.com/2016/07/13/a-morning-at-mt-shosha/ ) , okayama , [ kurashiki ] ( https://tokyoanecdote.wordpress.com/2016/07/25/boat-ride-down-kurashikis-canal/ ) , [ takehara ] ( https://tokyoanecdote.wordpress.com/2017/05/18/fukuyama-castle-attempt-3/ ) , etc. 
  ) , using the local train to move around . 
  if i 'd returned to either osaka or hiroshima at the end of every day it would 've been way too expensive , i would 've just bought a jr pass and used the shinkansen instead since it would 've costed about the same ( probably cheaper ) , however i changed hostel every 1-2 nights so i never had to backtrack and this way saved a lot of money . 
  on a different trip , i used a five day bus pass and went from nagoya  tokyo  morioka  fukushima  kanazawa  kyoto . 
  i slept in nagoya for two nights while i visited toyota and the city itself , but then i changed hostel to a place in gifu ( even though it 's about 30min away , it saved me some 2000 yen of backtracking ) and the next day in hikone ( saved me 4000 ) . 
  even though these places are nearby , without some sort of pass it 's unrealistic to expect to do so many trips cheaply if you want a base in one city . 
  i 'd recommend either changing hotels every few days to move closer to the places you want to visit , this way setting a line ( say , if you want to go to tokyo and kyoto above all else , you could spend 3 weeks of your trip taking the local train through matsumoto , toyama , kanazawa , fukui , lake biwa , etc. 
  and sleep at many places along the way while visiting interesting places ) , or else simply buy a pass . 
  using a base is something that people can do if they have a pass that allows them to use the train as many times as they want , but paying by hand means that it will likely be very expensive to travel like this . 
  i 'm a female tourist , but even then about all of the things i bought were `` practical things '' ( an umbrella , band-aids , a towel , batteries , etc. ), 
  what i did buy for myself was a book from hiroshima and some 30 packets of miso soup for when i was back home . 
  there are many types of passes , not only the jr pass , with various different prices . 
  perhaps regional passes would be more useful to you . 
  you can look through [ this page ] ( http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2357.html ) for other options . 
  i think the [ kintetsu pass ] ( http://www.kintetsu.co.jp/foreign/english/ticket/krp.html ) is a very good deal even for people who are on a budget , this would give you 5 days worth of train travel in the kansai region ( so you could go to mie , yoshino , iga-ueno , nara , nagoya , etc. 
  from either osaka or kyoto for only 3600yen , it 'll probably pay off in just a couple days ) . 
  it also depends where you 're going . 
  i 'll be going up to the tohoku region in just a couple weeks and still do n't have the reservations done . 
  because they are rural areas there is n't as much demand for it and some places do n't even allow you to book too far in advance ( the hostel for sendai i 'll be staying at specifically says `` reservation no earlier than 2 weeks in advance '' ) . 
  but it 's true that kyoto books out quickly and i had a few problems booking for tokyo a month in advance on my first trip . 
  i 'd worry about the hotspots first but the rest should n't be much of a problem . 
  sep/nov is still quite a while away though so do n't stress about bookings yet !, 
  you should have at least until the end of july to plan a route out before starting to book . 
  by the way , i really like fukushima city but there is n't that much to do there . 
  when people say they visit fukushima they 're usually talking about the aizu region ( such as [ ouchijuku ] ( https://www.google.es/search?q=ouchijuku&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjgzyx4jpzuahxmxhqkhtauc6kq_auibigb&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=589 ) , [ aizu-wakamatsu ] ( https://www.google.es/search?q=ouchijuku&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjgzyx4jpzuahxmxhqkhtauc6kq_auibigb&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=589#tbm=isch&amp;q=aizu-wakamatsu ) and urabandai ) or even [ abukuma-do caves ] ( https://www.google.es/search?q=ouchijuku&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjgzyx4jpzuahxmxhqkhtauc6kq_auibigb&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=589#tbm=isch&amp;q=%e3%81%82%e3%81%b6%e3%81%8f%e3%81%be%e6%b4%9e ) and [ mount azuma-kofukuji ] ( https://rediscoverfukushima.com/2017/05/12/azuma-kofujis-short-scenic-hiking-route/ ) . 
  fukushima city itself is really just a place most people go to to change trains . 
  ps : maybe you already know of this , but there 's a website that allows you to calculate train fares and routes called [ hyperdia ] ( http://www.hyperdia.com/ ) . 
  you can check prices there !, 
  thank you !, 
  i 'll do the changes you say , it does seem better the way you write it . 
  ! translated, 
  tohoku is one of my favourite areas !, 
  of course , with just three days there are fewer options , but i think that staying in sendai and visiting yamadera , matsushima and hiraizumi from there would make a nice trip , maybe geibikei gorge together with hiraizumi if you start early . 
  while spirited away is my favourite ( followed by howl 's moving castle ) , there 's a surprising number of people who for some reason adore totoro . 
  spirited away fans can go to the edo-tokyo open air museum and mononoke fans to yakushima , but there are few totoro-related places . 
  the house is already built too , it would make more sense to continue with the same film . 
  no clue , but you can look through the groups ' songs and see if you find it : [ 04 limited sazabys ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yltfllhqpuo&amp;index=4&amp;list=rdemfw5aylwyweyu0k01lfcgta ) , [ \u5ca1\u5d0e\u4f53\u80b2 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftwaz1jc4yi&amp;list=rdemdougkczq2qleehi37wwesw&amp;index=1 ) and [ \u30ad\u30e5\u30a6\u30bd\u30cd\u30b3\u30ab\u30df ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jxjdaqulro&amp;list=rdemvpjaizj2mnk7nde-omdzja&amp;index=1 ) . 
  tohoku is one of my favourite areas !, 
  from tokyo it 's quicker to get to sendai than to kyoto , i would n't recommend it as a day trip either but a couple or three days should be fine . 
  true , a lot of what to do in odaiba ( and shibuya , harajuku , akihabara , etc. ), 
  is shopping . 
  if you do n't like shopping , it can get boring . 
  but it 's worth a visit to ride the himiko boat as well as the yurikamome and to visit the miraikan museum . 
  i also enjoyed looking at the architecture of the area . 
  i do n't think it 's a tourist * trap * , but that does n't mean you have to personally like it . 
  i think for a place to be a trap it needs to have a big role in tourism ; something like tacky souvenir shops painted as `` traditional '' or `` authentic '' , high entrance fees for something one can see elsewhere much cheaper , or just a place that tourists like but locals do n't . 
  also look into r/nagoya . 
  i also always keep the headphones the plane gives out . 
  my camera is n't pictured here because my sister has it atm but it 's a panasonic g7 , so quite big . 
  i 'll probably be carrying that separately around my neck most of the time . 
  ** the trip ** :, 
  the purpose of the trip is to visit ** northern japan ** to do a short pilgrimage through the mountains as well as visit places that were affected by the 2011 earthquake / tsunami . 
  i 'll be staying for a bit over two weeks in the area and seeing mostly rural places , wonderful nature and many temples/shrines . 
  after that i 'll be spending 1-2 weeks in central japan touring castles and history sites , a day of observing urban architecture in nagoya , tea fields , factory visits , a festival and ending with a day in kyoto . 
  as you can see , it 's a bit of everything . 
  i 'm going right in the middle of the ** rainy season ** and the last days will coincide with the obnoxious summer heat . 
  if needed , i might buy an impermeable ( do you call it that in english ? 
  a raincoat ? ), 
  for the pilgrimage , but i 'll see how the weather is when i get there .
