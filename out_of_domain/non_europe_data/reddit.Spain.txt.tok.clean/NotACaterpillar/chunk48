  i 'll be changing accommodations almost every night and really do n't want to carry a big suitcase around ( or pay for lockers ) . 
  i also always keep the headphones the plane gives out . 
  my camera is n't pictured here because my sister has it atm but it 's a panasonic g7 , so quite big . 
  i 'll probably be carrying that separately around my neck most of the time . 
  ** the trip ** :, 
  the purpose of the trip is to visit ** northern japan ** to do a short pilgrimage through the mountains as well as visit places that were affected by the 2011 earthquake / tsunami . 
  i 'll be staying for a bit over two weeks in the area and seeing mostly rural places , wonderful nature and many temples/shrines . 
  after that i 'll be spending 1-2 weeks in central japan touring castles and history sites , a day of observing urban architecture in nagoya , tea fields , factory visits , a festival and ending with a day in kyoto . 
  as you can see , it 's a bit of everything . 
  i 'm going right in the middle of the ** rainy season ** and the last days will coincide with the obnoxious summer heat . 
  if needed , i might buy an impermeable ( do you call it that in english ? 
  a raincoat ? ), 
  for the pilgrimage , but i 'll see how the weather is when i get there . 
  i 'll be changing accommodations almost every night and really do n't want to carry a big suitcase around ( or pay for lockers ) . 
  will do , thanks !, 
  yes to all !, 
  i always love to find slow-burn fics with a lot of pining ( and bed-sharing ) . 
  because i 'm a student i do n't really have much money , i 'll be using night buses instead of the shinkansen ( so i have a bus pass instead !, 
  ) , takyubin seems like a great idea but unfortunately a bit expensive for me . 
  i 'm staying mostly in hostels ( with a few cheap ryokans and hotels mixed in since there are few accommodation options in the rural areas ) . 
  i will take you up on the shoe spray , i 'm sure it 'll be very useful . 
  thank you !, 
  because i 'll be sleeping in hostel dorms , i 'm more concerned about the other tourists rather than the japanese people themselves !, 
  i feel like it 's the easiest/safest way to carry my passport too . 
  there are many people who dislike money belts though . 
  i did n't think about that but it 's a great idea , thanks !, 
  thanks for the tips !, 
  no idea why others carry an alarm clock . 
  in my case , i used to have really bad depression and simply hearing the alarm clock when i had to get up in the mornings would send me into panic attacks / crying / suicidal thoughts . 
  there was a time when i simply could n't get out of bed for weeks ( bathroom breaks not included ) . 
  now being able to turn an alarm clock off and actually get up makes me feel much better because i know i 'm past that point . 
  and you 're right about the umbrella , but i have 5 of them at home and it hardly ever rains here in spain so i kind of want to get rid of them or at least use them sometimes . 
  part of the reason why i 'm going to japan at this time of the year is because i miss the rain . 
  thanks !, 
  * not * a caterpillar  :(, 
  thanks for the tips !, 
  one of the shirts is a tank top , should 've mentioned that , sorry !, 
  i could probably do with less but i do n't really want to do laundry too often ( i already have to do it at least three times ) . 
  [ this !, 
  ] ( https://www.odigo.jp/articles/1434-what-are-goshuin-collecting-temple-stamps ), 
  i also always wait until it 's completed , if it 's still ongoing there 's a chance that it will be abandoned or i 'll simply forget what the fic was about by the time another chapter comes out . 
  i usually read them all in one sitting ( long fics for the weekends !, 
  ) , there have been only a select few times where i 've had to read it over 2 days because they were very long . 
  but i do prefer to have them cut up in chapters if they 're over 20k , this way i can pause if needed without worrying about finding the spot later . 
  it also makes sure i take a break for food/bathroom visits , often i do n't realise how much time has passed when reading !, 
   members of our society should be familiar with the history and traditions of our culture . 
  i think learning history and culture is important , not only my specific culture but all culture and world history . 
  however , just because they are familiar with a culture it does n't mean they have to follow/agree with it . 
  about the striking : i think a boss should have a right to fire people if they go on strike and hence do n't do their work , but i do n't think they should be allowed to fire someone who * has * done their work . 
  people have responsibilities and a business depends on that person to carry out said responsibility . 
  if i were a boss , i would n't want to pay someone who has n't done the job , especially if it were to result in loosing clients and money or even bankruptcy in more extreme cases . 
  people get paid to work , if they do n't work they do n't have to get paid . 
  they 're breaking the deal . 
  a person has a right to go on strike , they can do whatever they want , but if they do so then they also have to suffer the consequences , meaning they might be fired if that 's what the boss decides . 
  i understand that not everyone works in the best conditions , and what i 've said may work better in first-world countries rather than other places where the workers live and work in situations that are n't even comparable ( or historic factory riots ) . 
  of course there have to be laws about minimum wages , ethical treatment and conditions in the workplace , max work hours a day , etc. 
  and it 's obligatory to follow these . 
  a business simply * should n't be allowed * to employ anyone if not following these basic conditions . 
  op would need a working visa / working holiday visa to work at a hostel in exchange for not paying accommodation . 
  remember [ khaosan sapporo ] ( http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2016/10/12/national/crime-legal/hokkaido-hostelier-hot-water-foreign-female-guests-busted-maids/#.wtmc2kkqx68 ) ? 
  i 'm from spain . 
  it 's true the afternoon meal is called `` dinar '' here , but we are taught in school that `` dinner '' in english is the evening meal . 
  even though they sound similar they are n't equivalent . 
  while i agree , technically , since i 've sometimes eaten breakfast at around 2pm or even in the evening , i think it also depends what exactly one eats . 
  if i have a bowl of cereal after `` dinner '' , i usually still call that breakfast ( or second brekfast ) , even if it is n't the first meal . 
  likewise , if i cook potatoes and broccoli at 3pm then i 'd usually consider it lunch regardless of whether i 've `` skipped breakfast '' or not . 
  like hobbits , i also sometimes have a `` second breakfast '' . 
   `` lunch '' is mid-day . 
  in spain we eat lunch at 2pm , sometimes later . 
  the first half of october would be nice for seenig the autumn leaves in hokkaido , but the second half would be best aruond nothern tohoku . 
  as for hokkaido , check out sounkyo or jozankei gorge and gingko avenue in sapporo . 
  if going to tohoku , maybe naruko onsen ( do n't forget to try [ kuri dango ] ( http://ikidane-nippon.com/en/feature/260187 ) while there !, 
  also the [ festival list ] ( http://www.japanvisitor.com/japanese-festivals/festival-october ) . 
  i 'm 1.85 m ( also 6ft ) and never had any problems with my height so you 'll probably be fine too . 
  i stayed a couple weeks in a capsule hostel ( not quite a hotel , but still had pods as beds ) and it was super comfortable . 
  i 've since slept in a couple proper capsule hotels and both were also fine . 
  i do n't really know why people do n't like them much , i think they 're cosy . 
  some capsule hotels have websites that mention the pods ' dimensions , it might be worth a look . 
  i use google maps for knowing where exactly each place is and seeing how to get between places , but do n't really use any of the route planning features per se . 
  for that i draw my own tables . 
  when i had a windows i used powerpoint , but now with a mac i use keynote , they 're pretty similar . 
  it usually ends up looking [ like this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jqd8zy1.jpg ) . 
  i lock the purple squares to the page so they do n't move ( i do n't think you can do that with powerpoint though ) and then move around the blue squares easily for creating the itinerary . 
  other [ similar tables ] ( http://i.imgur.com/g0ebn12.jpg ) can also be used to detail the different days more precisely . 
  thank you !, 
  you 're right about the umbrella , but i have 5 of them at home and it hardly ever rains here in spain so i kind of want to get rid of them or at least use them sometimes !, 
  i 've always liked umbrellas more than raincoats since it 's easier to just close it and put in away without wetting anything , as well as sheltering my camera a bit . 
  it 's true i do n't really need an alarm clock , but as mentioned in the description it 's more of a personal item and it comes with me on every trip all the same . 
  i used to have really bad depression and simply hearing the alarm clock when i had to get up in the mornings would send me into panic attacks / crying / suicidal thoughts . 
  there was a time when i simply could n't get out of bed for weeks ( bathroom breaks not included ) . 
  now being able to turn an alarm clock off and actually get up makes me feel much better because i know i 'm past that point . 
  i know it 's an added weight but i have plenty space for it anyway . 
  thanks for the tips !, 
  as someone else said , you * can * go without them . 
  my sister and i did that a couple times , she 'd stay at the hostel or something and i went out to do whatever . 
  you can do this after doing the daily sightseeing , once the museums close ( usually 5pm ) , and then go to akihabara later . 
  the shops there close at around 8pm . 
  about the adult themed stuff , i 've been to akihabara a few times and have actually only seen one hentai store , the rest is pretty `` soft '' ( meaning , regular anime which might contain characters in maid dresses , going to the beach , etc. 
  but not actively sexual ) . 
  now that i think about it , the figurine stores did all have a few figures in compromising postures .
