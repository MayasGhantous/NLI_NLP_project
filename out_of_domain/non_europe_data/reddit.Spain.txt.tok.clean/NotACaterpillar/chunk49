  i would n't worry that much about it , though seeing other people 's comments it seems maybe i somehow simply missed all the sexual stuff . 
  i think you 're overestimating the amount of money you 'll need . 
  of course , everyone spends a different amount and that 's fine , it 's easy to spend that amount of money and many people do , but if you 'll be staying mostly in hostels you 'll hardly need 1000 euros . 
  for example , i 'll be in japan again for 4 weeks and already have all the bookings set ; it totals at 51,200 yen ( 415 euros ) , and that includes a couple of cheap ryokans , a business hotel and mostly hostels / guest houses . 
  i 'd suggest looking into the prices of the places you 'll want to sleep to have a more general idea . 
  1000 euros means almost 9000 yen a night , that 's at least double ( maybe even triple , if you find a cheap hostel ) of what a hostel/capsule hotel costs . 
  as for the $ 127 , that seems like a good amount . 
  you should n't worry much about food prices , there are plenty cheap options . 
  because you are a vegetarian , i 'm going to assume you care about animal rights . 
  if that 's the case , i 'd suggest you avoid the owl caf\u00e9s . 
  owls are n't domesticated animals like cats , they dislike human contact and will spend their life in that caf\u00e9 mostly in small cages , chained to a post ( sometimes with clipped wings ) and forced to be touched by people . 
  it 's a petting zoo that is not good for the animals themselves . 
  of course it can be cool to see owls since they are n't something most of us get to see in our daily lives , but i personally would n't want to give my money to a place that treats them like that . 
  i 'm staying at a place called [ kamiyama ryokan ] ( http://www2.kanko-sekigahara.jp/lodge/003.html ) in sekigahara ( sekigahara was the location of the battle of sekigahara , it 's not worth visiting unless you * really * like history ) and [ hakuchosou ] ( http://livedoor.blogimg.jp/e_aji/imgs/d/1/d1c69aba.jpg ) in the shounai plain ( northern japan , i 'm staying here so i can visit the [ dewa sanzan ] ( http://hagurokanko.jp/en/ ) ) . 
  with two weeks in japan , especially if it 's a first trip , most people go to tokyo-kyoto-hiroshima ( + day trips ) , and these places are really `` off the beaten path '' so it 's unlikely you 'll be visiting those areas . 
  finding a ryokan in the places you will be going to is relatively easy though , they are pretty much everywhere . 
  i do n't often use trains without paying , that 's hard to do here in spain unless neither stations have ticket gates ( actually , scratch that , i have seen people jump over the gates often enough ) , but i do usually pay less than i 'm supposed to . 
  because i live on the outskirts of the city i 'm in the `` second zone '' and have to pay 2 euros to get to the city center ( every day for classes ) . 
  however , on the way back home there are no machines when exiting the station so i just use a `` 1 zone '' ticket ( 1 euro ) . 
  [ this ] ( https://youtu.be/_bjgsmfhwsu?t=4 ) is how i pronounce it . 
  i 'll be going there next week !, 
  i 've been to bizen which was quite nice , i think bizen would make a good stop if someone is on their way to hiroshima . 
  if going all the way down to hachijojima it might be cool to take the helicopter from there to aogashima ( expect to maybe get stranded a few days though ) . 
  i really like mito . 
  op , if going make sure to try natto while there , it 's their speciality . 
  there are actually many things to do in ibaraki that not many people go to see . 
  you might want to read [ this ] ( https://www.odigo.jp/articles/1387-travelling-to-japan-during-the-rainy-season ) page . 
  i think the best way to make the most of the trip is simply to not worry about the rain . 
  it happens , sometimes it rains , but i 've never really found that to be an impediment of visiting the places and sites i wanted to visit all the same ( other than , of course , cancellations for some select outdoors activities such as boat rides ) . 
  because many people do n't like rain and cancel their daily plans to stay indoors , many of the temples and shrines are considerably less crowded , hence more enjoyable , and can even look beautiful in the rain . 
  buy an umbrella and do n't let the rain stop you . 
  just do n't go hiking when it 's wet , that can be dangerous . 
  save the mountain visits for the non-rainy days . 
  if you * really * dislike rain there are still plenty indoor places to enjoy as well , maybe having a back-up plan can be good . 
  also try to include a visit to a temple known for hydrangeas , they look beautiful . 
  it might be that they have n't seen the actual movie . 
  i 've been reading sterek for a couple years and have n't seen teen wolf , so unless it 's a common theme that appears in many fics i never really know if it 's canon or not ... 
  i went with none . 
  while * some * chinese people might be materialistic , others may be respectful towards their elders , and yet others will be generous or dishonest . 
  every chinese person is different and it 's hard to make such grand generalisations , especially considering there are almost 1.4 billion chinese people on earth and they have n't all grown up in the same place and with the same culture ( those who 've grown up in shanghai will have a considerably different way of life and thinking than the average person from rural xinjiang , as are those brought up abroad ) . 
  by the way , the sea to summit does n't go up the yoshida trail , it goes up one of the harder ones . 
  you 'd have to circle around the mountian to get to the yoshida trail if starting from the sea . 
  [ diamond setouchi marine hotel ] ( http://www.marine-hotel.co.jp/room/index.html ) is right next to the place . 
  true , but i feel these are highly specific stereotypes that i 've never thought about . 
  people also have stereotypes about women/men , but they generally are n't related to whether `` women are often generous towards strangers '' , this would be such a generalisation that it 's unrealistic . 
  stereotypes i may have about chinese people include them being loud when in groups ( especially at tourist sites ) and spitting on the floor . 
  the examples given in the survey seem to be too focused on their character which is very variable by person . 
   what state do you live in ? 
  is this for people living in the us only ? 
  why is it for people in the us only ? 
  i used a saved map instead of an online map , but the rail system is quite easy to figure out once you 're there anyway . 
  i used it once for something i could 've easily looked up at a map in the station . 
  personally , if you really want to be safe , i 'd just save it for offline reading and that 's it . 
  about the ryokans , eastern tokushima prefecture is n't really known for onsens , most can be found in the oboke / iya valley area more to the west ( worth a visit for a day or two if you have the extra time ) . 
  one of the most popular places to sleep there is the [ shin iya hotel ] ( https://www.google.es/search?q=shin+iya+onsen&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjz2onjsk7vahucivakhye6cboq_auicigb&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=589 ) . 
  in naruto there is also [ naruto m sakura ] ( http://naruto-m.sakura.ne.jp/ ) , a small ryokan with no onsen , but it 's more homely so probably not what you want if you 're looking for the one-night ryokan experience . 
  in tokushima i 've found [ taish\u00f4r\u00f4 ] ( http://www.taishoro.com/ ) which does n't have an onsen either but looks pretty nice . 
  ** edit ** : there 's a minshuku ( [ minshuku kanshios\u014d ] ( http://www.saturn.sannet.ne.jp/kancyousou/index.html ) ) on awaji island , just before the bridge to shikoku , with an onsen and a view . 
  according to japan-guide :, 
   3240 yen ( full day ), 
   2730 yen ( entry after 15:00 ), 
   2530 yen ( entry after 18:00 ), 
   above fee includes entry to the water park , spring park , spa garden pareo and edo jowa yoichi , and unreserved seats for dance shows . 
  separate fees apply for rides in the water park , lessons and massage services and for reserved seats for the dance shows . 
  i would n't recommend going to the fox village . 
  foxes are not pack animals . 
  obviously they do n't like being touched by people ( they are chained up and forced to sit there while people pat them or a put in petting cages ) , and so they should n't be , but there should n't be so many living together in one place either , that 's not how they live in the wild . 
  people like to point out that the foxes in cages are pregnant or sick ( though not all of them are ) , however that 's still no excuse to trap them in such tiny spaces for who knows how long . 
  i would n't go if you like animals , or simply foxes , because [ they do n't live in the best conditions ] ( https://preview.ibb.co/juqamq/screen_shot_2017_05_08_at_21_26_19.png ) . 
  as for other places , tohoku is one of my favourite areas in japan and there is a lot to see .

  there is much more but that 's probably enough to keep you busy for two weeks anyway . 
  is is supposed to be closed ? 
  i do n't know if i 'm late or if it 's not working . 
  not anymore , but i used to be and i try to avoid eating meat as much as i can . 
  i do n't eat fish though . 
  i do n't eat fish so i did n't try sushi . 
  this is most of what i ate , minus convinience store food . 
  i also tried okonomiyaki in hiroshima which was really nice but unfortunately do n't have a photo !, 
  that 's from half way up fushimi inari !, 
  i had it in kanazawa , look out for it if you 're going there !, 
  there are things that i actively avoid ( like prawns , crabs and dishes that have more than one dead animal ) , dashi was very hard to avoid though , especially since the rural areas i visited usually only have japanese menus and it was hard to figure out what each dish had . 
  the ramen broths also probably had chicken or dashi too . 
  i think bigger cities would be easier for vegetarians , but there are a few options if you look restaurants up online . 
  it 's impossible to miss since the trail cuts through it and everyone stops there for an ice cream , halfway up the mountain of fushimi inari shrine . 
  google maps does n't show it or a name though , sorry . 
  you ca n't choose on the spot if you have a reservation , you have to say where you 'll be getting on/off . 
  however , you can make the reservation closer to the date . 
  i think there are few good people in the world , but that does n't necessarily mean they are * bad * . 
  morality is rarely a black-white thing , i think most fit on an average scale . 
  the problem is that being fully good is very difficult , people could always do more to be better , myself included , or perhaps their efforts are misguided or useless or unwanted . 
   if a guilty person goes free , then it 's an injustice . 
  depends on the freedom they get . 
  sometimes , no life is better than a miserable life . 
  freedom can also be a punishment . 
  i know most people love kyoto , but personally i did n't think much of it either . 
  i mean , it 's nice and fine , there 's plenty english and is foreigner-friendly for people who are afraid of the language barrier , there 's lots of information about kyoto online and there are a wide variety of good looking hostels to choose from , many traditional experiences all in one place too ... but personally i did n't feel like it offered anything to me that i could n't see elsewhere . 
  there were too many crowds and tourists , restaurants were expensive , many stores selling omiyage and trinkets so i thought many places were a bit tacky . 
  i think visiting kyoto can be nice , but i would n't really go out of the way to see it if it 's not a place that calls to you particularly . 
  there are many amazing places in japan and to make the most of the trip it 's necessary to sometimes cross things off to make time for the things you really want to do , even if it 's a place that people talk a lot about .
