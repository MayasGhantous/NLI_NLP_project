  i did n't go to kyoto until my fourth trip to japan , just for a couple days , but i never regretted skipping it on my first trips . 
  according to [ this page ] ( http://www.izumo-murasakino.jp/izumo-kamiarisai.html ) , it seems to be going from 28/11 to 3/12 this year . 
  you can translate the page for details on the exact celebrations and events . 
  you do n't really need a suitcase to use a locker , i would n't buy a suitcase unless it turns out you buy a lot of stuff and your carry-on is too small . 
  i always use just a carry-on and still use lockers often enough , opting to just bring the smaller day back with me without all the clothes and stuff i 've bought along the way . 
  generally , you should be able to leave bags at the hostels if needed . 
  - ** first trip ** : bought a big gym type bag , stayed in tokyo for two weeks , had to buy a ( medium ) suitcase because i bought loads of junk . 
  so i ended up with two very heavy bag/suitcase , which exceded the 20kg limit for luggage , plus my carry-on stacked to the top . 
  - ** second trip ** : bought my big old school bag with me and just used that ( probs 45-50l or something like that ) . 
  i bought a cheap bag and filled it with food for the way back . 
  - ** third trip ** : 35l carry-on and that 's it . 
  honestly , if someone attacks first i 'm leaning towards thinking it 'll be trump . 
  kim jong un has been giving threats for years , if he was actually planning to do anything then he likely would 've done it already . 
  announcing that you 're going to attack someone before attacking seems like a highly unpractical thing to do . 
  we can say what we want about kim jong un , but he is n't entirely stupid ; he knows that there 's a world out there and many countries against him , plus china has said that if he attacks first they would n't be on his side . 
  i think he is mostly waiting for an excuse to attack . 
  trump is giving kim jong un those excuses , making threats may eventually succeed in kim jong un getting nervous or angry or running out of patience or feeling he needs to prove himself , trump is just making things so much worse . 
  the us should n't be creating waves because it is n't * them * who will be on the end of the sword ( they are far away for a proper war to be carried out between the two ) , nk will attack sk , maybe japan or guam or somewhere else nearby . 
  trump is making things worse when he is n't even going to be the one receiving the consequences , and that 's not really fair . 
  on the other side , in the year 2017 i think it 's completely shameful to even be thinking about bombing a capital full of innocent people . 
  the people who live in nk are brainwashed , but * not * evil , they are not their dictator . 
  those in pyongyang especially have been becoming more and more aware that there are lies going around , to the point that there are over 30,000 nk defectors living in sk right now , and that 's just the amount of people who have managed to escape nk successfully , managed to not get caught in china and sent back and finally managed to arrive to sk safely . 
  it 's only a small fraction of those who have tried , plus there are defectors living in other countries too . 
  i think , in a way , we need to * help * the people in pyongyang get out of the situation they 're in . 
  giving them knowledge about the world , giving them an education about countries , different people and customs , history told correctly . 
  let them meet people from around the world to show that the lies they 've heard their entire lives are wrong . 
  right now they are being used as puppets , but if we want to be any better than kim jong un , we have to treat them as people . 
  i think the best way to tear down kim jong un 's dictatorship is from inside . 
  i do n't mean sending secret soldiers to attack headquarters or anything , i mean getting the people of pyongyang to uprise against their leader . 
  outside tv series and movies are already being watched secretly by many regular people in pyongyang ; let 's make it more . 
  let 's * give them * series , movies , books , answers and show them that the outside world is different to what they were told . 
  tell them that people have escaped and show them how they live now . 
  tell them that they can * be * someone and * do * something , give them a way to communicate with each other around the government and a way to know that others are thinking what they 're thinking too . 
  perhaps it 's a highly idealistic thought , but maybe not impossible since it 's already started to happen . 
  north korea is a big country , but the world around it is bigger . 
  i do n't want to hurt nk , i do n't want to be seen as someone who has the power and armies and weapons needed to take them down , i do n't want another country to defeat and take control of nk because that will lead to rapes and murders and tortures and yet another hierarchy between the people of nk and those with more power . 
  i do n't see the people of nk as our enemy . 
  kim jong un and other government officials need to be taken down , but i want the people of the country to know that they 've been lied to , i want them to know the truths , to be able to talk without getting killed and to be able to rejoin the families separated from sk . 
  we do n't only have power of weapons , we have the power of instant communication anywhere on earth , we have money and tools and people who can help , we have airplanes and medicines and access to knowledge , a community of people all over the planet . 
  i want them to say , maybe 100 , 200 , 300 years in the future , that we were the the ones who finally choose peace over war for once and drastically helped the lives of millions of people . 
  i never get the meals either and so far all ryokans and minshukus i 've stayed at have offered reduced prices if that 's the case . 
  it would be strange for them to have a `` meals obligatory '' policy . 
  as for the markets / shops / restuarants , there are probably options . 
  which part of the route are you planning on doing ? 
  i 'm quite happy with my newspaper here in spain , but there are plenty of rubbish options to choose from too . 
  it depends a lot on where exactly ( which websites , newspapers , tv channels , radio ) people are getting their information from , not just `` media '' as a whole ( and not always because of a false or lack of information overall either ) . 
  if you plan to walk the entire way between them ; nojiri , suhara , fukushima and yabuhara post towns also have at least a couple places each but agematsu and miyanokoshi are smaller . 
  i 'd go with the assumption that 99 % of ryokans would accept stay with no meals , that 's not something you need to worry about . 
  chances are you 'll likely see one or a few , but you do n't have to be scared about going to the mountains because of them . 
  they are a bit more aggressive than regular wasps but their attitudes are pretty much the same ; they wo n't sting if you do n't annoy them . 
  they go about doing their thing and wo n't attack unless you provoke them . 
  i 've come across many but have never had any problems . 
  also , they do n't really come out during the night . 
  i bought some bananas while walking around town , deciding to eat them later in the evening and sat down on some stairs as i waited for my sister . 
  a monkey suddenly jumped in front of me , snatching the bag from right between my legs . 
  out of reflex , i grabbed the bag too , but it was plastic so it simply split in half , letting the bananas fall to the ground , down a couple steps , between us . 
  for a moment , the monkey and i both stared at the bananas and the piece of bag in our hands , then at each other , thinking * `` should i go for it ? '' *, 
  i then realised that i was staring down a monkey , that monkeys could also be aggressive , and decided to cut my losses . 
  as soon as i relaxed , the monkey darted forward and claimed its prize , making sure to sit nearby while unwrapping the first of the bunch , all the while staring smugly at me . 
  the photo captures the monkey 's latter celebration of triumph . 
  thanks , i 've changed it !, 
  nobody gets newspapers brought to their door here in spain . 
  you want , you go out and buy it . 
  until you realise that the town hall purposefully does n't feed the deer as an attempt to lower their dependency on humans and stop bothering the town 's people , and so all the deer are basically starving and only really eat what they steal from tourists . 
  the amount of maps they eat is not particularly healthy . 
  departures meaning the movie ( okuribito ) ? 
  i do n't remember anything related to miyajima ... 
  i just buy clothes from the second hand shop , this way it 's also much cheaper . 
  while shirts are generally all tacky , they have a surprisingly great selection of dresses ; once i found a fancy designer brand that would 've cost the first owner over 200 $ , and i got it for just 1 $ . 
  for some reason , people also pass down lots of clothes they no longer want to me , so i have n't gone and bought any in over two years . 
  i see not buying brands as more of a moral decision , rather than anti-consumerism related . 
  multinationals like zara , adidas , h&m , nike , etc. 
  all had ( and likely still have ) problems concerning child labour , `` sweatshop conditions '' , underpaid workers , etc. , plus adding on product sustainability and, 
  the use of animal products/un-kind animal treatment to get these products , it 's kind of a deal breaker . 
  personally , i would n't mind paying a bit more if it were to avoid these problems , but i avoid buying clothes , brand or no brand , if i do n't know or agree with the conditions and details related to their fabrication . 
  i 'm by no means a minimalist , i simply go by the `` do n't buy things i do n't actually need , even if i want them '' rule . 
  i think this sub is very anti-advertising , but i quite enjoy looking at adverts from an idea / film / storytelling perspective , and i 've never had an urge to buy the thing being announced , even when i was a kid . 
  i only book through booking.com and other sites if absolutely necessary , especially because booking keeps sending me annoying emails even though i 've unsubscribed . 
  i check the hotel 's website first to see if i can do it directly through there , or else i use rakuten above other booking sites . 
  i really like the tohoku region , so i would recommend going up to sendai if your jr pass is still valid . 
  yamadera and hiraizumi are especially worth a visit while up there , many people also enjoy matsushima , and kakunodate too if you 're okay with a longer train ride . 
  i used to be vegetarian and even though i 'm not anymore i still try to avoid eating meat and fish as much as i can , so no sushi ( or tonkatsu ) for me !, 
  that is actually the giant buddha of takaoka , a city next to kanazawa . 
  i did n't see much of kanazawa either since i only had one spare day between night buses . 
  i 'll have to go back some day !, 
  ah , thanks for clearing that up !, 
  i saw many stands selling them so it must be quite popular . 
  this one was right next to the bus stop , next to the river . 
  thanks , 
  hey , that 's what comes out in spirited away !, 
  it was very nice and surprisingly fulling . 
  at the start i ate a lot of green bean chips but i found out that they had bonito too , so i stopped eating them . 
  it 's difficult to know what 's good to eat and what not without speaking japanese . 
  ** winter **, 
  - positives : you can enjoy the snow in areas further north and the onsen feel especially good . 
  start of the year and end of year have lots of festivals and celebrations everywhere as well as the snow-related festivals that are amazing . 
  also some hostels have * kotatsu * . 
  did i mention snow ? 
  snow is awesome . 
  - negative things : it 's very cold , the days are much shorter and it gets dark very early .
