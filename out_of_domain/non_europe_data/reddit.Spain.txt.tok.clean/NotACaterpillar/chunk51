  the first and last days of the year will be full of people . 
  ** spring **, 
  - positive things : cherry trees and other flowers are what everyone first mentions about spring because of their beauty , it 's a good time to enjoy hanami and try sweets with sakura flavour . 
  - negative things : there are lots of people and there will be queues to enter just about every popular place . 
  i flat out refuse to go to kyoto at this time of the year , but if you 're brave enough to face the crowds then go at it . 
  the grass is sometimes yellow . 
  ** summer **, 
  - positive things : the sound of * furin * , sunflowers , ice cream , fireflies during early summer , * chinowa * rings at shrines , rice fields full of water and life , you wo n't have to carry many clothes in the suitcase so luggage will be a lot lighter . 
  everything is very green and mount fuji can be climbed from the beginning of july !, 
  also august festivals !, 
  - negative things : in july and august it is very hot ( * very * hot ) , it is very humid and you sweat a lot , early in the summer some toilets still have the heated bidet seats turned on and can be a bit uncomfortable . 
  also hornets and bugs ( not really in cities though ) . 
  if you travel in august book the hotels early because they are summer holidays and there will be lots of people . 
  ** autumn **, 
  - positive things : the colours of the leaves are really beautiful , generally there is little tourism . 
  also the time of the year for * tsukimi * ( moon-viewing ) and you get to try tsukimi dango . 
  - negative things : september is the month with the most rain in tokyo ( i mean , i like rain but i guess most people do n't ) and september is typhoon month in the islands of okinawa , kyushu and shikoku . 
  my favourite seasons to visit are , in this order : rainy season , winter , autumn , spring , summer . 
  summer is last only because of the heat , i always try to go during rainy season at the end of june because i love rain and hardly get to see it here in spain . 
  it 's also not yet hot but still has many benefits of summer ( plus hydrangeas and iris ) . 
  as for the plane tickets , i recommend using a site like kayak and check many different months . 
  you 'll see that , buying tickets now will be cheaper for some months than it is for others , but it changes so it 's hard for us to tell you . 
  personally i would choose chiba , because i thought nikko was very expensive and touristy , but chiba is very big so it depends on what exactly you want to see . 
  while i like chiba , it 's true that nikko is historically important and has very nice nature , the sites in chiba are generally small . 
  for someone 's first visit to japan , i would recommend nikko over chiba . 
  worth looking into in chiba are mount nokogiri , [ boso no mura ] ( https://www.google.es/search?q=%e5%8d%83%e8%91%89%e7%9c%8c%e7%ab%8b%e6%88%bf%e7%b7%8f%e3%81%ae%e3%82%80%e3%82%89&amp;dcr=0&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewimyco11jlwahxqhrqkhe1rdm8q_auicigb&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=589 ) , naritasan shinsh\u014d-ji temple , [ sakura ] ( http://blog.livedoor.jp/zirachan/archives/23627579.html ) , [ sawara ] ( http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e6406.html ) and , this is part of ibaraki but it 's right next to sawara , [ kashima jingu ] ( http://database.ibarakiguide.jp/db_kanko/?type=en&amp;detail&amp;id=0800000000093 ) . 
  you do n't want to be dating someone who thinks you 're crazy . 
  might as well tell her/him at the start . 
  if s/he disagrees , best to get it over with instead of dragging it along just to be dumped later on when you are also more invested in the relationship . 
  more importantly , never change your morals to please someone else . 
  do n't ever do things you do n't want to do just to make someone like you ; there are plenty people on earth that share and/or will accept your zero-waste lifestyle . 
  it 's easier said than done , but if there 's something you believe in , do n't give it away for someone who might not even care . 
  much like u/toc _ a_somaten , i also want catalan independence for political reasons and changing laws . 
  in the end , it boils down to because it would be a small country , it would be much easier to govern and catalonia would be more leftist . 
  catalonia also seems to care about global warming and i would very much like to see the current spanish laws related to installing solar panels on houses change dramatically and overall investing more in renewable energies . 
  i think catalonia would also accept many more refugees ( spain accepted to take in 17337 but so far only 1888 people have been accepted and [ there is n't much time left ] ( http://venidya.org/shared-counter.html ) ) , which should be a big priority . 
  economically , smaller countries tend to have higher hdi scores and without the difference in money given to el gobierno and money given back to catalonia , catalonia would have more money to put into improving the area . 
  it 's true that it may be difficult at the start , but in the long run i 'm confident catalonia would gain a lot of money and more freedom of choice with what to do with it . 
  it would also mean more becas for universities . 
  i think collections are fine if the consumer is aware that they are not necessary . 
  a shopping addiction would be a different matter . 
  i would also have a more negative view on collecting cars , because it means a lot more waste and pollution , over collecting figurines or beanies . 
  personally i collect toilet paper , different patterns and colours that i see in restaurants , hotels , friends ' houses , etc. 
  and take two squares of each . 
  i also have a collection of colourful cellotapes and odd-shaped rubbers , mostly made up of presents . 
  here in spain nobody has driers . 
  when i went to japan for the first time i did n't even know what a drier * was * and was very amazed ( and confused ) when the woman running the hostel showed it to me . 
  maybe , or maybe they just do n't care that much about clothes . 
  honestly , if i were rich , i would n't upgrade my clothes , i have other things that interest me more to spend money on . 
  bill gates ' jumpers look comfortable and he wears plenty of suits too anyway . 
  i 'm sure many ( most ) rich people do things to hide their wealth , but that does n't mean * everything * they do is to hide their wealth . 
  i 'm 8 days late responding to this , but i 'll do so anyway . 
  in the year 2017 , soon 2018 , i think it 's completely shameful to even be thinking about bombing a capital full of innocent people . 
  bombing korea is simply not an option in my book . 
  the people who live in nk are brainwashed , but * not evil * , they are not their dictator . 
  those in pyongyang especially have been becoming more and more aware that there are lies going around , to the point that there are over 30,000 nk defectors living in sk right now , and that 's just the amount of people who have 1 . managed to escape nk successfully , 2 . managed to not get caught in china and sent back and 3 . finally managed to arrive to sk safely . 
  it 's only a small fraction of those who have tried , plus there are defectors living in other countries too . 
  i think , in a way , we need to stop thinking about what we could do to `` beat '' nk , because it 's not ** them against us ** , it 's the world against their ** dictatorship ** . 
  we need to try and help the people in pyongyang get out of the situation they 're in . 
  giving them knowledge about the world , giving them an education about countries , different people and customs , history told correctly . 
  let them meet people from around the world to show that the lies they 've heard their entire lives are wrong . 
  right now they are being used as puppets , but if we want to be any better than kim jong un , we have to treat them as people . 
  i think the best way to tear down kim jong un 's dictatorship is from inside . 
  i do n't mean sending secret soldiers to attack headquarters or anything , i mean getting the people of pyongyang to uprise against their leader . 
  foreign tv series and movies are already being watched secretly by many regular people in pyongyang ; let 's make it more . 
  let 's give them series , movies , books , answers and show them that the outside world is different to what they were told . 
  tell them that people have escaped and show them how they live now . 
  tell them that they can be someone and do something , and more than anything try and give them a way to ** communicate with each other ** , without the knowledge of the government , and a way to know that others are thinking what they 're thinking too . 
  perhaps it 's a highly idealistic thought , but maybe not impossible since it 's already started to happen . 
  north korea is a big country , but the world around it is bigger . 
  i do n't want to hurt nk , i do n't want to be seen as someone who has the power and armies and weapons needed to take them down , i do n't want another country to defeat and take control of nk because that will lead to rapes and murders and tortures and yet another hierarchy between the people of nk and those with more power . 
  i do n't see the people of nk as our enemy . 
  kim jong un and other government officials need to be get out of the way , but i want the people of the country to know that they 've been lied to , i want them to know the truths , to be able to talk without getting killed and to be able to rejoin the families separated from sk . 
  there 's a youtube channel , asian boss , who [ has interviewed many north korean defectors ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyquw0wywoc&amp;t=2s ) who live in sk now , their videos are interesting if anyone wants to learn about life in nk . 
  it 's very easy to find a reason to hurt someone , but there are many reasons why it usually is n't a good idea :, 
  # ** family **, 
  for example , let 's talk about the death penalty . 
  when a criminal is killed , s/he 's gone , it 's over , they probably did n't want to die so it 's a pity for them , but more importantly * they * are not the only victims of the situation . 
  their parents , siblings , other family , friends , brainwashed followers , etc. 
  have to live loosing someone they love . 
  i do n't know if you 've ever lost someone that you love , but suffice to say , it 's a terrible horrible feeling that is absolutely devastating . 
  unfortunately , cruel people do n't get a `` nobody loves you because you 're mean '' card ; many bad people have someone who loves them , and many times these people are actually nice . 
  it 's also easy to think * well , they can deal , he was bad * , but when we stop caring about other peoples ' feelings , love and the bad experiences they go through , then we are n't all that different to the `` bad people '' to begin with . 
  # ** other options **, 
  if someone acts violently against someone who wants violence , ** what difference is there exactly between the two ** ? 
  whatever reasoning , in the end they are both violent . 
  an example of someone who is using violence to fight against something bad is duterte . 
  what he is doing , is it right , is it good ? 
  when violence becomes okay , something that is used often , even if it is to `` defend what is good '' , ultimately it becomes something commonplace even when it is not really necessary or when there are other options . 
  there are * so * many ways to deal with a problem , each case studied separately . 
  violence may be the fast and easy way out , but it is rarely the best way out . 
  if everyone thought of violence as an ultimately bad thing , if violence was n't an option , would there even be wars ? 
  killings ? 
  if every country who was part of the un was against violence , did n't participate in violence , the world would actually be a peaceful place . 
  another thing to have in mind is that things often get carried away and getting out of a situation , even for a powerful person , can be very difficult . 
  is there any way that kim jong un can get out of the world hating him ? 
  if he joins a war , he loses ( he knows that ) , if he resigns , he 'll be taken to prison or killed , either by the next power of by a foreign country . 
  at this point , for him it is no longer about profit , but about survival . 
  if we want to solve the north korea problem with a dialog , maybe finding a way to tamper down on kim jong un 's fears about his survival could be something to think about . 
  i think there may be other ways of solving the problem without either dialoguing or bombing each other , but it could still be an option worth exploring .
