  violence in `` good name '' can get out of hand too . 
  kira , from death note , starting killing criminals to make the world a better place , but eventually ended up killing detectives , innocent people , people that werefalsely accused and anyone who got in his way . 
  # ** collateral damage **, 
  how would you attack someone like kim jong un , bomb his city or factories , without killing other people there who are mostly innocent ? 
  when you attack a country or a leader , you almost definitely wo n't be fighting against him/her specifically , you 'll be fighting against their armies . 
  sometimes , these are people who do n't even want to be fighting , people who were forced to join , do n't agree with the cause but ca n't back down , feel pressured , fight because of economic necessity / family needs , are simply brainwashed or , as you said yourself , have been lied to and do n't know the real consequences or reasons of what they are doing . 
  many times armies are made up of normal people and they are , usually , not the actual enemy . 
  and it is n't just armies who would make up the collateral damage , obviously . 
  for example , germany saw a wave of suicides during the last days of the nazi regime ( effects of nazi propaganda , victims ' attachment to nazi ideals , a reaction to the loss of the war and allied occupation of nazi germany ) . 
  some people in north korea absolutely adore kim jong un and almost everyone in korea believes that they will win any war . 
  if the us were to kill kim jong un , or simply won , and the koreans saw americans in power ( people who [ they 've been taught are evil and cruel their entire lives ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxo-vov_98y&amp;list=plqxewt98fewr1unyova1nkpgkxnfqjt7q&amp;index=5 ) ) * so many * koreans would kill themselves , out of fear for what the americans would do to them and/or out of sadness for their leader 's defeat/death . 
  all these people , who 've been brainwashed , do n't deserve to die too . 
  and even in a less extreme situation , it 's highly likely that other people would also be killed or hurt in the process . 
  so many times in movies things have escalated so quickly because of stupid misunderstandings , things that could easily have been solved or would n't have been a problem at all if people had just listened to each other . 
  sometimes , people overreact so much that it stops any form of dialog . 
  people in the past thought killing gay people was a good thing , and fortunately we have today , at least where i live , changed that midset . 
  i 'm not saying that kim jong un is a poor misunderstood soul and in the future we 'll all think he 's great , but at times it can be good to calm down , look at the details and situation and know that , sometimes , there is more than meets the eye . 
  finding those things , changing the way we look at a problem , might mean solving it . 
  i know that there are people who do bad things , that sometimes if someone simply does n't do anything to defend themselves then they get hurt , they die . 
  but in the end , we have to do our best to build the world we want to live in and we have to , above all , follow our morals of what is good and what is bad . 
  `` the change starts with you '' and all that . 
  it 's easy to say * when this is over , no more violence * , but the world is never over , situations are linked , things have consequences , people 's memories remain and they build their morals on their experiences . 
  above all else , we should look for other options to solve our problems , stop defining violence as a necessity or a solution or okay because it 's directed to something/one that 's wrong , and start seeing it as dishonor , as something sad and bad . 
  if you want a good world , be good . 
  the mayor of nagoya also denied nanking . 
  glitter is just little bits of pretty plastic , as such it is terrible for the environment , it ca n't be recycled . 
  throwing glitter around is basically just littering with gleeful abandon . 
  and if anyone washes it off it goes straight through the filters and into the ocean , where fish eat it . 
  it 's possible for glitter to get into people 's eyes and damage the cornea , especially when being thrown at someone unsuspecting . 
  other than that , some legal officials say glitter bombing is technically assault and once a student was arrested , put in jail for 6 months and fined for doing so . 
  i would n't do five straight hours on the train . 
  not only because of time ( though i would n't like losing a morning to transport with very limited time in japan ) , but because five hours on a train is extremely boring and annoying . 
  i think it is a much better idea to start early , do half the trip and spend the day somewhere in between , and then finish off the journey in the late afternoon . 
  like a day trip , but starting and ending in different places . 
  i personally would n't do five straight hours on the train , first because it will probably bite into precious sightseeing time and second because it 's a pain . 
  both u/tumnaselda and u/chronoclaws have said some interesting places . 
  i think kurashiki/okunoshima are very close to hiroshima so they are n't quite halfway , but if doing the trip over two days they are worth a visit . 
  i would suggest something like this :, 
  [ start jr pass ], 
  [ end jr pass ], 
  - 10 : airport, 
  i went to hikone earlier this year and it was great , there is a lot to see for half a day , longer if you actually walk up to lake biwa . 
  i was in kurashiki and okayama last year too , and really loved both places as well . 
  you 've already spent a lot of time in tokyo so i would personally take the opportunity to see both hakone and nikko , they will allow you to get to know the country beyond tokyo-kyoto a bit more ( even though both are still very famous ) . 
  both * spirited away * and * your name * are great . 
  my favourite anime film would have to be * millenium actress * though . 
  satoshi kon is n't as famous as ghibli since his films are from a bit before the big anime boom in the west , but his movies have still won many awards and nominations . 
  if anyone is interested in anime i 'd also recommend mushishi ( manga or anime ) and suiiki ( manga ) both from the same author . 
  oh man , sorry but i really did n't like that movie . 
  not that it was bad specifically , it was simply boring and tiring to watch . 
  i was actually quite surprised when the same director made * kimi no na wa * because it was a big leap in quality from his previous films ( including * 5cm/s * , * agartha * and * the place promised in our early days * ) . 
  i completely disagree with the people saying makoto shinkai is the next miyazaki , i 'd say his `` rival '' may be more mamoru hosoda . 
  fun fact : the movie actually had a lot of backlash in japan because of cultural misrepresentations and the geisha that `` inspired '' the book actually took the author to court . 
  later she wrote her own autobiography ( * geisha , a life * ) , which may be worth reading for a different view . 
  according to wikipedia :, 
   kimiko akita , in `` orientalism and the binary of fact and fiction in memoirs of a geisha '' , states that `` golden treated geisha as an object to be sexualized , exoticized , and romanticized by the west '' . 
   for the film , marshall was criticized in japan and the west for casting chinese actors to play japanese characters in roles firmly entwined with japanese culture . 
  additionally , kimiko argues that the movie instead helped perpetuate views of `` japanese culture and geisha as exotic , backward , irrational , dirty , profane , promiscuous , bizarre , and enigmatic '' . 
  in the special features of the dvd , it is noted that few japanese actresses showed interest in being a part of the production . 
  i 'm really surprised nobody has mentioned * departures * !, 
  great movie , i watched it once years ago and again on the plane this june before setting off to yamagata , where it was filmed , and it made the trip so much better . 
  i also tried to watch * oshin * before yamagata but honestly i could n't watch it . 
  it 's supposed to be very popular so maybe someone else here likes it though . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbre5iurbu ) 's a good video talking about media . 
  this anti-media sentiment so many people seem to have nowadays does n't make sense . 
  `` media '' is anything from newspapers , photography , advertising , movies , radio , tv , books ... saying that `` most of the time media hides much more than half of the truth '' is false . 
  is there fake news ? 
  yes . 
  are there stories and magazines centered around stupid or fake things ? 
  yes . 
  but * most * of it is n't lies . 
  any professional and informed published book about a certain topic is media , [ this ] ( https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2016/05/25/16/boat_libya.jpg ) is media , [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2rftbvwteo ) is also media . 
  the `` do n't trust the media '' sentiment started during trump elections , when people believed everything he said without looking at the proper sources , but that does n't mean that proper sources simply * do n't exist * . 
  if we want to change the way people think , we can give them access to different media rather than seeing violence as an answer . 
  north koreans obviously only recieve brainwashed and filtered media from the government , but there are * plenty * contraband movies from south korea , the us , england , etc. 
  going around . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/pacifism/comments/6x8xmb/how_would_you_handle_north_korea/dmrnq4g/ ) is a more lengthy comment about the north korea situation , if that 's the example you 're looking for . 
  i also love that movie , but it 's not quite japan-focused , so it does n't really fit op 's question . 
  well that 's a load of rubbish . 
  i 'm willing to talk to both sides , hear what different opinions each party has to say , but * both * groups keep talking about the other as if they were the plague or something . 
  it honestly does n't help when catalan independentists `` son unos extremistas y radicales '' and madrid is `` feixista i opressor '' . 
   el pa\u00cds asked a group of experts [ ... ], 
  why in the world are they asking an architect and a writer with a degree in archaeology about politics and calling them `` experts '' ? 
  i 'm sure they 're experts in their fields , but not in this one . 
   `` [ ... ] they have shown their real face : the face of an identity-based , supremacist nationalism . 
  they want to be independent because they believe themselves to be better than the rest . '', 
  really ? 
  * everyone who wants independence * is a supremacist with a superiority complex ? 
  how is insulting almost 50 % of catalans a way to solve , or even simply talk about , this issue ? 
  i can count on one hand the independentist people i know who have a superiority complex , and it 's not aimed towards spain but towards the spanish central government . 
   `` puigdemont wants to go out in handcuffs , and it 's very hard not to handcuff someone whose political goal is precisely that . '', 
  puigdemont 's main goal is n't to end up in handcuffs , i can think of numerous ways that would be more effective for that than going for president de la generalitat , he simply * does n't really mind * ending up in handcuffs if that 's what will get catalan independence . 
   `` ultimately , it is frightening to face up to so many people who are so emotional about the issue . 
  flag-waving crowds are always scary . '', 
  there are indeed many people who are very emotional about it , but there are a large number of people who are n't and a large number of people who would be happy to talk about it . 
  nobody is going to go up to a flag-waving crowd to argue against what they 're protesting about , but * any other time * would be fine . 
  believe it or not , flag-waving crowds can not be seen every day . 
   `` this is not a war between madrid and barcelona or between catalans and spaniards ; it 's between catalans themselves . '', 
  this is not a ** war ** period . 
  it 's a debate , a problem , an ideology , a political side , etc. , but nobody is shooting anyone .
