   `` [ ... ] a lot of people are afraid to come out with their non-secessionist opinions '', 
  my teacher is super anti-independence : nobody talks about independence in that class out of fear of the teacher disliking them . 
  i 'm sure similar situations happen the other way around too , point being it 's not a one way street . 
  the article talks about `` the silent majority '' as if they were nothing but victims . 
  i know plenty people who do n't want independence and have had no problem talking about it . 
  it 's true they do n't go out in the street with flags , but that 's because * catalonia is already part of spain * . 
  independentists are making a noise about something they want and do n't have ... why would someone make a noise about something they do already have ? 
  hey , i saw an irish flag ... maybe it was you ? 
  i also saw estonia !, 
  oh wow , i did n't know her name , definitely seen her drawings many times though . 
  were you by any chance near [ els gegants del guinard\u00f3 ] ( https://i.imgur.com/dppkbhh.jpg ) ? 
  i had no idea what `` jumping the shark '' was . 
  til, 
   do you think gun crime is increasing or decreasing in the uk ? 
  yes / no / stayed the same, 
  is * yes * supposed to mean increasing and * no * decreasing ? 
  i think it would be good to post in both places , most people on this sub are against independence . 
  either way , every time this topic comes up someone ends up fighting . 
  i like to keep my eye on kenya , they 're going in a good direction . 
  i have a lot of hope for the country in the future !, 
  you 'd be right , a good newspaper should be able to give the facts , unbiased ; explaining what has happened is n't `` left '' or `` right '' . 
  however , many newspapers include `` opinion '' sections where readers send their opinions about different topics , a debate area , polls , maybe some ( political or not ) comic strip , etc. 
  which tend to lean more to one side than another . 
  for example , i buy a newspaper called * la vanguardia * during the week , definitely a left newspaper simply because of this `` opinion '' section , but on sundays i buy * el pa\u00eds * , more right-wing , so i can do the sudoku-samurai . 
  even so , the actual news sections of both newspapers are very similar . 
  they have recently changed the bus connections so it 's likely most information online about transportation is outdated . 
  there are regilar buses between tsuruoka to hagurosan , buses between hagurosan and gassan and buses between hagurosan and yudonosan only on weekends . 
  there is no longer the bus connecting yudonosan and tsuruoka station . 
  on another note , there are numerous pilgrim 's acommodations in haguro town and one at the top of mt.haguro , three mountain huts on gassan and one more expensive hotel ( ? maybe onsen ) next to yudonosan . 
  it 's hard to draw a line in religion about what makes a `` real follower '' or simply someone who calls themselves that . 
  there are plenty of christians who do n't follow every word of the bible , plenty of muslims who do n't listen to all the rules of the quran , and here there are buddhists who ignore the `` no violence '' rule of their texts . 
  there has been a lot of violence related to buddhism in the past . 
  i think that saying '' * real * buddhists/muslims/christians / etc. 
  are n't like that '' is a way of ignoring the problems that exist , an excuse and a way for the rest of the followers to avoid acknowledging the problems within their communities that may create these issues to begin with . 
  in the end , it does n't really matter what label people call themselves , it matters what they are doing . 
  not everyone . 
  at the uni 's bathroom here in spain , few people pass by the sink after the toilet . 
  i know people are taught to wash their hands after , but in practise there are loads of people who do n't . 
  we do n't shake hands here though , it 's two kisses . 
  hnd is definitely closer , but not worth * $ 100 * extra . 
  i 'd go for nrt any day if that 's the price difference , op can do a stopover in narita town which is nice anyway . 
  car costs include car rental , expensive toll fees and parkings , in the end it adds up very quickly . 
  generally , renting a car is one of the most expensive transportation options in japan and is usually comparable to just using the shinkansen . 
  i would [ take a discount bus ] ( http://www.kankou-shimane.com/en/?p=6485 ) between hiroshima and matsue and use the local train between izumo-matsue ( they are n't far away ) . 
  the expensive trip should be between matsue-kyoto only . 
  if going to ebisu , why not just fly into tokyo ? 
  in my experience , fukuoka , takamatsu and nagoya have been the cheapest airports , but osaka and tokyo are n't much more . 
  i do n't know american flight prices , but flying into fukushima/sendai would be at least 100-200 $ more expensive ( with an extra layover ) from here barcelona . 
  i would consider flying into tokyo and then taking a highway bus ( night bus if you do n't mind sleeping on one ) up to fukushima . 
  fukushima is just four hours away and it 's a short trip , about 3000-5000yen a singluar journey ( cheaper if you have a [ bus pass ] ( http://willerexpress.com/st/3/en/pc/buspass/ ) ) , it would be more straightforward and probably cheaper than taking the train until there . 
  shinkansen is of course also an option , but considerably more expensive . 
  i do n't really understand your route to be able to give much advice . 
  if using the nex , but there are many other cheaper options to get into tokyo . 
  when going in groups it 's true it pays off more !, 
  i answered this because i thought op was going solo . 
  out of curiosity , why odai ? 
  i 've never heard of anyone going out there . 
  i really like * pandora en el congo * from albert s\u00e1nchez pi\u00f1ol . 
  original is in catalan but it 's been translated into both spanish and english . 
  one of my favourite books . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/japantravel/comments/4sc50s/budget_breakdown_from_my_recent_trip/ ) 's what i spent in japan , on the cheap . 
  once i drank from a bowl of soy sauce thinking it was , i do n't know , water or something ( or was dark , i could n't see it was black ) . 
  to be fair , i 'd never seen soy sauce in a bowl before . 
  no weird stares though , the restaurant was quite empty . 
  that would definitely lead to using less plastic in the first place . 
  plus blasting rockets into space also emits co2 , so it seems kind of counterproductive . 
  not so much `` translation '' as it is convention . 
  in spain , and many other countries , we 're taught that there are five continents ( asia , africa , america , europe and oceania ) , while i think people in the us are taught seven ( asia , africa , north america , south america , europe , `` australia '' , and antarctica ) . 
  it depends where you went to school .

  i thought most people did that ... 
  i 'm disappointed to learn that it 's not a common thing .

  when i hear `` america '' as a continent , i think of the * whole * america . 
  i guess it is a less common tern in the us , but it 's not strange to talk about america as north + south america where i 'm from , so i 'm sure op is in a similar situation and not just looking for problems .

  kiwis tend to not like being called part of australia . 
  new zealand and nearby islands are part of `` australia '' , but they tend to not like that much . 
  i do n't actually know what countries people mean when they say `` central america '' ( mexico ? 
  ) , you should probably ask someone who was taught the 7-continent model . 
  definitely real , i grew up in nz !, 
  long story short , the ancient greeks saw that the mediterranean divided europe from africa , the red sea divided africa from asia , and with their limited knowledge of geography , assumed the black sea divided asia from europe ( [ a map ] ( https://i.imgur.com/ssqpsld.png ) ) . 
  later european colonialists also wanted to make a distinction between europe and asia which only reinforced this notion and has since been reinforced by a culture divide that runs roughly along the same lines . 
  as my teacher told us , `` it does n't count because there are no people '' . 
  we do n't count antarctica as a continent . 
  i 'm not defending anything , i 'm just saying how things are taught .
