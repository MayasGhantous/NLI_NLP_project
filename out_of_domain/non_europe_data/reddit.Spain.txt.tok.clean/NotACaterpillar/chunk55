  nah , the mossos would n't stand a chance !, 
  i checked my source and it seems to be from 2010 . 
  it 's true things have probably changed since then . 
  well , that at least gives a more positive light to the whole thing , the country has improved !, 
  i would n't even * recognise * my country 's anthem ( i 've heard it all of once because i looked it up on youtube ) . 
  forcing someone to stand up for their anthem is completely ridiculous ( needless to say , overly nationalistic too ) . 
  in the year 2017 , soon 2018 , i think it 's completely shameful to even be thinking about bombing a capital full of innocent people . 
  bombing korea is simply not an option in my book . 
  the people who live in nk are brainwashed , but * not evil * , they are not their dictator . 
  those in pyongyang especially have been becoming more and more aware that there are lies going around , to the point that there are over 30,000 nk defectors living in sk right now , and that 's just the amount of people who have 1 . managed to escape nk successfully , 2 . managed to not get caught in china and sent back and 3 . finally managed to arrive to sk safely . 
  it 's only a small fraction of those who have tried , plus there are defectors living in other countries too . 
  i think , in a way , we need to stop thinking about what we could do to `` beat '' nk , because it 's not ** them against us ** , it 's the world against their ** dictatorship ** . 
  we need to try and help the people in pyongyang get out of the situation they 're in . 
  giving them knowledge about the world , giving them an education about countries , different people and customs , history told correctly . 
  let them meet people from around the world to show that the lies they 've heard their entire lives are wrong . 
  right now they are being used as puppets , but if we want to be any better than kim jong un , we have to treat them as people . 
  i think the best way to tear down kim jong un 's dictatorship is from inside . 
  i do n't mean sending secret soldiers to attack headquarters or anything , i mean getting the people of pyongyang to uprise against their leader . 
  foreign tv series and movies are already being watched secretly by many regular people in pyongyang ; let 's make it more . 
  let 's give them series , movies , books , answers and show them that the outside world is different to what they were told . 
  tell them that people have escaped and show them how they live now . 
  tell them that they can be someone and do something , and more than anything try and ** give them a way to communicate with each other ** , without the knowledge of the government , and a way to know that others are thinking what they 're thinking too . 
  perhaps it 's a highly idealistic thought , but maybe not impossible since it 's already started to happen . 
  north korea is a big country , but the world around it is bigger . 
  i do n't want to hurt nk because that would mean hurting all of the people there that have nothing to do with their leader 's cruelty , i do n't want to be seen as someone who has the power and armies and weapons needed to take them down and i definietly do n't want a country to defeat and take control of nk because that will lead to rapes and murders and tortures and yet another hierarchy between the people of nk and those with more power . 
  kim jong un and other government officials need to be get out of the way , but i want the people of the country to know that they 've been lied to , i want them to know the truths , to be able to talk without getting killed and to be able to rejoin the families separated from sk . 
  bombing or attacking nk like trump keeps threatening is going to get thousands of innocent people killed . 
  there 's a youtube channel , asian boss , who [ has interviewed many north korean defectors ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyquw0wywoc&amp;t=2s ) who live in sk now , their videos are interesting if anyone wants to learn about life in nk . 
  which part of having a war with north korea that would kill thousands of innocent people in pyongyang do you define as `` not losing '' ? 
  just because americans would n't die , it does n't mean that it 's okay , the point is to ** not hurt people ** who have done nothing wrong . 
  kim jong un and other high officials are of course a bunch of idiots but the people of his country do not deserve to be caught in the middle of this . 
  it 's also sad to see how said war starts right in front of us when it could be avoided if people had a bit more empathy and listened/thought things through properly . 
  how is he defending japan and south korea ? 
  if he bombs nk , the first thing kim jong un would do is start sending bombs to the countries he has nearby , the easiest ones to attack and would hence be more effective ( sure , and the us too , if they can actually reach it ) . 
  either way , the fact that you think killing the ( brainwashed , but still innocent ) people of north korea is better than killing americans shows what is wrong with the world . 
  spain . 
  * , but i think that only comes out half way through , i would probably already be fired as a football player by that point . 
  `` defence '' is often used as an excuse for violence . 
  it would be much better to try and find a peaceful solution rather than going straight to the threats . 
  your solution is war then ? 
  how can killing thousands of innocent people be considered a viable option ? 
   none of the citizens have political power . 
  do you think they are stupid ? 
  they live in a constant state of government surveillance, 
  did you read my post ? 
  i suggested we ** give them a way ** to talk with each other without the government surveillance . 
  that was one of the main points of my `` plan '' . 
  i am very aware that they do n't have political power , however if many of them revolt , the government can not kill thousands of people all at one time . 
  ( or , it * can * , but that would basically be the end of the population 's love towards their leader . ), 
   most defectors want violent overthrow of the government . 
  source ? 
   they are sent to concentration camps for holding onto materials that you want to openly distribute !, 
  the north korean interviews i have seen say otherwise , but it does depend on where these movies are from ( ex . 
  a movie from south korea is much worse than a movie for finland ) . 
  either way , nobody would be * forcing * them to watch and distribute these illegal materials , we should simply facilitate that option . 
  selling videos in north korea would be a good business ( secret , black market , but business all the same ) because many people actually want them , believe it or not . 
   people are being raped and murdered now by the government . 
  correct , but it 's obvious that when someone invades a country , violence against the `` natives '' is very common . 
  just because the korean government is bad , it does n't mean that a foreign government would be * good * . 
  it can still also be bad . 
  i have read that book . 
  however , note that that is the story of * one * north korean and his life . 
  plenty other north koreans have different lives , especially when so many things are going on in a country like nk . 
  i suggest to you to find stories from many nk , and not just take one as the rule of thumb . 
  i already admitted i was wrong because the source was outdated . 
  i feel that if someone * really * wants a source for everything people are saying in this post , they can go ahead and ask for it , otherwise people here would spend more time digging up that article they read than actually talking to each other . 
  but hiroshima was a totally cruel thing to do . 
  sure , the japanese were absolute monsters during the war , but the people * in hiroshima itself * were mostly women and kids , the men who were actually doing the fighting were n't there . 
  actually , the island near hiroshima that held the `` hospital '' for the injured fighters turned out to be fine after the bombing anyway ( and then served as an evacuation spot for all the injured in the bombing ) . 
  it 's easy to say that doing bad things is necessary , but it is * better * to find a peaceful option ( or at the very least * look * for it and try it first ) than going straight for the weapons . 
  the world is never going to be without war if people keep thinking war is a necessity . 
  yes , it has not ( yet ? ), 
  started , but my comment is more in referance if it were to start . 
  i think there are ways to avoid it . 
  maybe having the people of north korea revolt , get china to stop helping north korea , negotiate with kim jong un his situation ( if there 's a war , he 's dead for sure , perhaps there is a way to convince him that he will not be killed ? ) . 
  these are just ideas , but if we had more people ( powerful people ) thinking of ideas instead of threats and bombs , maybe we 'd be a step closer to solving the problem without getting people killed . 
  i think this is where we disagree then . 
  nk has been doing threats for years , has been doing tests for years . 
  tensions have started escalating as soon as trump becomes president , and what he does best is make threats and do things without thinking much first . 
  i think trump will likely be the one to fire first , because i also believe he does n't care much about the people of nk themselves and would not stop to think about saving their lives . 
  i 'm not saying war is imminent , but if someone fires first , i 'm inclined to believe it will be trump . 
  it is n't the only solution . 
  i 've answered in too many comments already , but there are numerous ways to go about this differently ( click on my username to read them ) . 
  war can be avoided , at least this one can . 
   i hate to break it to you , but the world is never going to be without war, 
  i agree , but the very least we can do is strive to not be the people who start the wars in the first place . 
   his entire country is run on the ideal that one day they will strike and destroy the great satan ( the us ) . 
  yes , but it 's important to note that what his country is run on is n't necessarily the truth . 
  north korea 's dictatorship is built on lies and the people who like him like him precisely because they believe those lies . 
   at one point something is going to happen . 
  either he 's gon na go completely off his rails and actually carry out his threats , or someone out there is going to do something to stop him . 
  yes and no . 
  i do n't think he will actually dare to bomb another country , simply because he knows very well that there are many countries in the world and not many of them like him . 
  it 's obvious to everyone ( besides the brainwashed people of nk who lack a proper education about the world ) that kim jong un would n't stand a chance . 
  he knows very well that once a war tarts , he will end up dead , and his glorious days of dictatorship will end . 
  kim jong un currently lives a great life , why would he sacrifice that ? 
  his bombs are built to defend himself in case someone else attacks first , but it is unlikely he will use them to ruin his own life . 
  i agree that `` at some point something is going to happen '' . 
  however , that does n't have to mean war and `` someone doing something to stop him '' does n't have to mean bombs . 
  there are numerous ways to go about this situation and i think at least trying for a more peaceful plan could be equally as damaging for the korean government itself and more beneficial for everyone else involved .
