  for example , if the people of north korea were to revolt against their leader . 
  the lack of empathy i am talking about is that of americans ( and people from other countries too ) who think the north korean lives do n't matter , do n't matter as much as american lives , or simply do n't think about them at all . 
  ( of course , nk think americans are the devil , but they have no political power or influence over what their leader does as of yet . ), 
  the fact that some people think bombing korea is better than bombing america is sad , because in the end human lives have equal value , no matter where they are from . 
  i can understand the feeling of preferring a different country to be attacked rather than one 's own ( i live in barcelona , and the terrorist attack here hit much closer to home than when i heard about attacks in other countries ) , but the option of `` nobody gets attacked '' should be preferred over `` kill them just in case '' , especially when the first possibility very much exists . 
  i. . . have no idea what you 're talking about . 
  trump is very much nationalistic , but i have no idea what you said in whatever other post . 
  thinking = / = acting . 
  the actual problem is that people are not involved in this . 
  honestly , i think that if the world actually put pressure ( and money and volunteers ) into finding a solution , this would move quicker . 
  having an intelligence group think about it and governments politically fight over it is great , but the biggest changes come with the unmbers of the `` regular '' crowd . 
  i doubt any positive books have been written about north korea ( at least since the start of the dictatorship ) . 
  but i never said `` positive '' books , i never said `` books '' at all actually , i said `` different stories '' . 
  there are people who have it worse and people who have it better , even in north korea , kang chol-hwan is obviously one of the worst-off . 
  my opinion has not been constructed from one particular book , it has been built on hearing from many different defectors over time talk about their opinions of their country . 
  i 'm simply saying , look for * more * people 's stories , in general , since it is hard to fully understand a topic if we only listen to one source and one side . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehmzpmp3bee ) would be a good place to start . 
  that is like saying `` if julia is going to come home today , why is n't she here already ? '' . 
  it 's entirely possible she might come home later , the fact that she simply has n't come home * yet * does n't mean that it wo n't happen at all . 
  i do n't know if trump will attack north korea , but if * someone * does , i 'm * more inclined * to believe it will be him . 
  i 'm not saying he ** will ** , i 'm not even saying that * someone * will at all and i 'm definietly not saying that ** it 's clear ** . 
  ( u/h24l and u/kickababyv2 ), 
  how many people from north korea have you had the opportunity to listen too ? 
  one thing that i have heard quite a few north koreans say is that , despite the bad conditions they lived in , they were ultimately not unhappy . 
  of course some have it worse than others , and some live terrible lives , but actually most north koreans do not live in concentration camps . 
  i think that most would prefer to live than have a `` mercy '' - kill by someone who has based their thoughts of the country on media stereotypes . 
  maybe some do want to die , but i think human survival instinct tends to make many people want ot survive rather than being bombed . 
  listen to [ what north koreans have to say ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehmzpmp3bee ) about their life . 
  [ something like this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/71zr6l/us_bombers_fly_close_to_north_korea_to_show/dnerkwv/ ) , maybe . 
   this is an undisputed fact . 
  i never disputed said fact . 
  my moral position is `` let 's not bomb nk becase it will kill many people , instead let 's try to find a perhaps less violent option '' . 
  it 's not really about how big or important a country is , it 's about how much that country likes to play it . 
  i have never heard spain 's anthem before , so of course i would n't recognise it . 
  however , many americans i hear have actually pledged to their flag in school when they were younger , with the anthem playing in the background , or listened to it at sports games or military funerals or in movies and whatever other place . 
  it is clear that the us plays their anthem much more than spain does . 
  whether that is good or bad i do n't care , but the fact that forcing someone to know a song and pay respect to it as a symbol of `` patriotism '' , regardless of whether that person agrees with the lyrics or the act itself , and if they do n't they lose their jobs , * that * is n't right . 
  north korea has concentration camps ... so we should bomb the country to get rid of them ? 
  i already answered this below , so i will simply quote :, 
   the lack of empathy i am talking about is that of americans , and people from other countries too , who think the north korean lives do n't matter , do n't matter as much as american lives , or simply do n't think about them at all .

  while i agree , i think we should find a way to avoid this lasting for 50 years rather than simply assuming it will and counting the numbers with that estimate . 
  i understand defence , the thing is we are n't actually being * attacked * . 
  killing people because of a `` just in case '' instead of trying to find a peaceful solution does n't sound like the best plan to me . 
  yes , * stereotypes * . 
  i did n't say * you * particularly had those stereotypes , but you would n't be the one throwing the bombs and there are a large number of people who * do * base their image of nk solely on stereotypes . 
  it 's hard to have a discussion about this topic if people get so defensive , so i 'll pretend to ignore your last comment . 
  i agree with some aspects of your nk definition ( very little to eat , little connection to the modern world , very little freedom of expression ) , but not all . 
  - what do you mean by labor camps ? 
  while work is very hard , most people do not live on camps and they are not actually forced to work . 
  unless one lives in an actual concentration camp , they can perfectly well choose not to work if they want ( of course , then they die of hunger , but i guess that 's their consequence of not working ) . 
  - `` access to education only for the elite '' , [ not quite true ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m4l2rfqmig ) . 
  actually , many kids , at least in pyongyang , actually do go to school . 
  it is `` obligatory '' and an easy tool to brainwash and manipulate kids from a young age . 
  * university * , on the other hand , * is * definitely solely for the elite . 
  - '' [ ... ] that will work your grandchildren to death if you try to so much as leave the country . '', 
  actually not . 
  north korean defectors get punishment if they are caught and the family may also get punished if it is thought they helped in any way or even knew about it , but even the defectors themselves do n't usually face death , rather just a punishment or prison time for a few months and then back to their previous north-korean lives . 
  unless it is somebody important ( like jeon hye-sung , someone who insults kim jong un himself or a high official or something ) , of course . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kw97cjpmrxw ) is a defector who was actually caught by the government . 
  look , i 'm not saying we should protect the north korean way of life , * of course we should n't * , their lives are horrible , but ** killing ** these people is n't any better , especially when they want to live .

  hmm , it 's true that there is no easy way out , but it 's a difficult situation all around . 
  i believe that the best would still be to put our efforts and minds into solving it more peacefully rather than with bombs . 
  ah , i never said simple !, 
  there is no easy way out , it 's a difficult situation all around . 
  i still believe that the best would still be to put our efforts and minds , the world has many people with brilliant ideas and plans , into solving it more peacefully rather than with bombs .

  some people have found solutions , they simply have not been listened to by the main population and they have not been invested in and properly carried out . 
  thank you !, 
  even though some are downvoted , quite a few of my comments actually have numerous upvotes too , it 's nice to know that not everyone disagrees !, 
  personally , i find it hard to feel proud of a country 's history when people `` fought and died for the flag '' . 
  it makes it feel to me like it is pride from spilling blood and winning over others . 
  because i am against the idea of a military , at least ideally speaking , it 's difficult to take a stand in honour of their achievements . 
  whether veterans would consider this an insult is irrelevant to me , because i am against their work as a veteran to begin with . 
  but i think the way spain and the us see the military is very different . 
  personally , i do n't know anybody who has worked in the military and i think most people here think of people who work for it kind of like `` high school dropouts '' who coul n't find a better job , or are people who are agressive / have alternative ideas of peace . 
  it 's not really talked about so i do n't know what other spaniards think , but the few who have mentioned it also had similar opinions . 
  perhaps other spaniards have different opinions . 
  i would almost see working for the military as a source of shame because i think fighting and killing is a sad thing , no matter the circumstance ( the fact that people kill each other is sad ) . 
  it is not something to ever be proud of or to respect . 
  although , i can definitely understand that if this kaepernick is who did so with his ideals , it would `` taint '' the whole movement . 
  i already said below that i was wrong , but * fine * i edited it too . 
  there is no need to be rude . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  in ** no moment ** did i say i 'm okay with people in concentration camps , i am most definitely * not * okay with that . 
  it is true that most people do not live in camps , but it 's not * okay * that some do . 
  i said ** we should not kill the people of north korea ** . 
  i think , in any case , * you * are the one with poor morals because you say we should bomb the country and kill them so koreans do n't have to suffer through a situation that * most koreans are n't even in * . 
  in a way , your vote actually helped trump win . 
  the only real competition was between trump and hillary , and so voting for a third party was almost like not voting at all . 
  the fact that you did n't vote for hillary meant that there was less of an opposition to trump . 
  `` everyone wins '' but the thousands of innocent north koreans that the us kills . 
  i do n't usually want to read major character death because i 'm very sensitive to the topic of `` losing a loved one '' . 
  i did read a fic once that was n't tagged as such and it made me cry for hours , really ruined my day . 
  i would prefer that such important things be tagged .
