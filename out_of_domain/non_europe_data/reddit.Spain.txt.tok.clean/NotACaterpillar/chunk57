  it 's true that some readers may be scared away , but these are usually the people who do n't want to read about that topic in the first place . 
  no surprise is better than a bad surprise . 
   us , russia , britain , china , france , india , pakistan , israel and nk, 
  i was a bit surprised to see france on the list , nuclear weapons are n't what i think of when someone mentions my neighbours . 
  it 's unfortunate that the biggest countries are those with the weapons . 
  nine countries have actual weapons or have done tests ( us , russia , uk , china , france , india , pakistan , israel and nk ) , unfortunately 3 of those are very big . 
  i did n't suspect france though . 
  sweden did n't . 
  why would you not want them to sign ? 
  after a bullying incident , they made us write a page about what empathy was , cellotape is to our folders so we 'd see it every day and sign it so we would all be vouch to be more empathic to one another . 
  slightly ironic that you mention gandhi , since india is one of the 9 countries that have nuclear weapons . 
  actually there are many north korean defectors who have managed to escape ( 100,000 -- 300,000 ) and now about 30,000 of them live in south korea . 
  you should watch [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kw97cjpmrxw ) . 
  i do n't really understand why people want to visit north korea , especially knowing that the money they earn from tourism is put towards building their army and weapons . 
  perhaps you should take [ this quiz ] ( https://www.sporcle.com/games/g/africa ) then . 
  as the title says , i have three days . 
  i want to see :, 
  - bitchu-takahashi ( walking to the castle and down again ), 
  - kibi plain cycling + a couple of museums in soja, 
  - shizutani school ( will walk there from the station and last entry is at 4:30 , so i 'll need to be on the train from okayama at around 1pm tops ), 
  i was thinking of doing a full day for takahashi , another day for okayama + kurashiki , and the third day for kibi plain + shizutani . 
  but i 've heard the kibi plain takes about 4h , plus the extra museums i want to see and i do n't want to rush , so i do n't think i 'll make it to shizutani in time . 
  how would you group this up with the time i have ? 
  considering i can start very early every day and be at each place at morning opening time . 
  after the ` things to do in tokyo ' map that steweinjapan generously posted a few days ago , i thought i 'd contribute to people 's future itineraries and post maps of kyoto and hiroshima to go alongside it . 
  - kyoto : https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=1mdh5l4wd2dcjy8gjgurcziape5o, 
  i have n't been so creative with the icons since i found them a bit confusing . 
  i 've left the map open so you can all add your own suggestions !, 
  hiroshima unfortunately is a city that many people only do as a day trip and do n't know what there is to do there beyond the peace museum + dome and miyajima , so here are 50 + things to entertain yourself if you have an extra day or two !, 
  i know japan has restrictions on some of the medicine / drugs that are legal in other countries , so i wanted to make sure my medicine is okay . 
  i do n't think it 's common in the us since i have n't found an english name for it , but it 's called espidifen in spanish ( over the counter , i do n't need or have any prescription for it ) and i take it sometimes for back pains . 
  if i do n't then i usually have to stay in bed for a couple of days and ca n't do much of anything ; needless to say , that 's not how i want to spend my holiday in japan . 
  each packet ( hoping to take two or three ) has :, 
  - ibuprofen 600mg ( arginine ), 
  - excipients : aspartame ( e951 ) , saccharose , sodium hydrogencarbonate and other excipients, 
  would i be allowed to take this with me ? 
  sorry if this has already been asked before , i could n't find any information about this particular one and thought to ask just in case . 
  better safe than sorry , as they say . 
  thanks !, 
  so i was supposed to spend an extra day in okayama prefecture , but after a heat and fainting incident -- long story short -- i have a full day in osaka that i was n't expecting . 
  i have n't the time to sit down and do the research on what there is to do now , so i 'm hoping you could all help me out !, 
  my plan is to go to osaka open air museum of farmhouses in the morning , then i was thinking of osaka castle . 
  at 7pm they are doing a celebration along the river so i want to be there for that . 
  really nothing else planned . 
  debating whether the ramen museum is worth it . 
  i 'm a huge museum fan so any museum recommendations would be appreciated ( though not art museums ) , bonus points if they are close to osaka castle . 
  i have already been to dotonbori and tsutenkaku . 
  and as a side question , where would i buy natto ? 
  i want to take some home so my sister can try it , but i 've been to a few konbini and 100yen stores food sections , and i 'm not finding any . 
  thank you !, 
  hello to all . 
  as the title says , i returned from my second trip only a couple of days ago and i thought i 'd share a few tips with you . 
  i 'm going to jump right into it because nobody really cares about the introductions anyway :, 
  - there 's no such thing as a ** language barrier ** ; if you do n't speak any japanese , do n't worry about it . 
  gestures , exclamations , showing an image or word written down , etc. 
  will get you a long way . 
  that being said , the more you know the better , and do try to at least learn basic words like please , thank you , excuse me ... i studied japanese for a year back in high school so i know the basics ( + can read hiragana and katakana ) , but the phrase i probably used the most as a solo traveller was ` shashin o totte itadakemasu ka ? ' -- ` can you take a photo of me ? ' . 
  - there are n't many ** rubbish bins ** so you 'll probably have to carry around your own rubbish until you get back to the hotel / hostel / ryokan / whatever . 
  the bins next to the vending machines are usually just for bottles/cans and should n't be used for other rubbish . 
  - the amount of ** walking ** you 'll be doing is going to be painful to your legs , even if you are n't going hiking . 
  there are n't that many benches in public places . 
  onsen are supposed to help but since that 's not really my thing i aimed for stretching and massaging my legs when starting and ending the day . 
  you get used to it as the days pass . 
  - not everything is going to work out ( probs ) . 
  on my first trip i got sick and nearly vomited behind a temple in the middle of nowhere , then it started to pour . 
  then they locked the gate and i could n't get back to the main honden and to the road . 
  i ended up ditching my plans and going back to tokyo to sleep ( and silently cry ) . 
  though it 's a pity , consider it an adventure and make the most of it . 
  an open mind will really help you enjoy every second of your trip regardless of what happens !, 
  - have ** shoes ** that are easy to put on and off if you plan to visit castles , residences , some shrines and temples , etc. 
  since you wo n't be allowed to wear your shoes inside . 
  also make sure your socks do n't have holes !, 
  - the earlier you get to a place , the less crowded it will be . 
  especially important for popular shrines and temples in kyoto . 
  while i wake up at 6am every morning , i do n't expect you to be so eager , but try to get to the places as soon as they open ( usually ~ 9am ) . 
  - i used ** google street view ** to ` walk ' from the station to my hostel virtually before my trip because the last thing i wanted when i got there in person was to get lost and walk around in circles trying to find my hostel while i was tired and carrying my backpack . 
  it was very useful . 
  - some of you clever people may already know how to do this , but before leaving i discovered how to ** format the memory card ** for my camera , and i gained extra storage space for over 2000 photos . 
  you might be interested in looking into this if you 're lacking storage ( formatting a memory will delete all photos inside the card though , so empty it out beforehand ) . 
  - you might not always need a ** jr pass ** . 
  it is recommended for those taking a few shinkansen journeys ( if you 're doing the golden route tokyo-kyoto-osaka-hiroshima-tokyo via shinkansen , then it is advised that you buy one , check to compare the jr pass and individual ticket prices before you buy one to see if it pays off for your route ) , but it is also most definitely not the cheapest way to travel !, 
  consider night buses , which also save you from paying for a night 's accommodation , and a bus pass for multiple journeys , or take local trains instead . 
  if you are taking locals for a long distance make sure to make a few stops along the way to stretch your legs . 
  - as always when travelling bring ** extra money ** in the case of an emergency or mishap . 
  i also keep my money in at least two-three different places just in case . 
  also , all those annoying 1yen coins that i did n't know what to do with were used as donations to temples / shrines or for that 8yen tax added on at 100yen stores . 
  - if you 're starting your trip in tokyo and do n't already have one , in akihabara you can easily find a ** charger converter ** . 
  just exiting the station you 'll find the main street ; cross that and go into the back streets which are packed with many diverse electronic stores or go to radio centre ( you can also find memory cards and other similar things ) . 
  just show them your plug and they 'll help you find one that works . 
  i found one for spain-japan in less than five minutes for about 150yen . 
  also might want to look out for the voltage converters depending on where you 're from . 
  - i did n't have any ** portable wifi ** or international data since i did n't feel like i needed it . 
  but i am a detailed planner and already had my own maps of the places i 'd be going to as well as the train connections sorted out , so if you plan to not have an internet connection accessible , do make sure you have all the extra information already sorted out beforehand . 
  do n't rely too much on finding wi-fi on the go . 
  there was always wi-fi at the hostels though . 
  - i 'm mostly an independent person so i never felt lonely ** going solo ** . 
  at the hostels it was very easy to talk and meet new people , and the locals always seemed to be excited to see a foreigner in smaller towns . 
  going solo also meant going at my own pace , so i was able to move around my plans or spend a longer / shorter time at each place depending on my mood . 
  - as a 20f i also felt ** safe ** at all times , even walking around alone at night ( though i did n't go out partying or drinking ) . 
  i even felt safe falling asleep on trains in the city ; you do that in the metro in barcelona and you might as well say goodbye to your money .
