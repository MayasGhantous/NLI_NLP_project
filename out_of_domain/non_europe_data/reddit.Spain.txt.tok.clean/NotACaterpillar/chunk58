  - it is very ** hot ** now in japan . 
  i got used to carrying around a small wet towel around my neck that helped cool me down . 
  and if someone offers you one of those fans with advertisements : * take it * . 
  and that 's really all i can come up with for now . 
  if you want to know something specific please feel free to ask !, 
  i hope this was useful to someone . 
  i guess i 'll add more if i think of something i have forgotten . 
  i 've already posted some tips and comments on another post , but since travel costs seem to be a recurring question for first time travellers , i wanted to post a breakdown of how much the trip i just did cost me . 
  i usually took the cheapest options in every situation , so consider this low-budget . 
  of course this is only for reference and budgets may change greatly from person to person , so please only use this for reference and not as a definite answer to travel costs . 
  long story short , my route was from osaka kansai airport to hiroshima ( okay , fine , up until iwakuni , but fewer people know where that is ) with many stops along the way . 
  - ** transport ** : 21,820 \u5186 total ( about 1450\u5186 / day ), 
   i did n't have a jr pass since it did n't pay off at all for the trip i wanted to do and many of the places i went to did n't even have a shinkansen stop . 
  i usually used local trains to get around between cities and towns . 
  taxis and ropeways were a big no-no for me since my budget did n't allow it , so in most cases i walked or hiked if possible . 
  the price for transportation this trip was much higher than my last trip where i stayed in tokyo for the two weeks . 
   as for passes , i did have a ` visit hiroshima tourist pass ' ( small version 1000\u5186 , lasts three days ) , which allows you ` free ' rides on trams and inner-city hiroshima buses , as well as the ferry to and from miyajima . 
  if you 're doing hiroshima / miyajima as a day trip maybe the one day-pass would be a better option , but i was there for almost a week . 
  - ** accommodation ** : 38,800 \u5186 total , 14 nights ( about 2600 \u5186 / night ), 
   j-hoppers and hana hostel chains offer a discount of 300yen every three nights , so ask for their discount stamp sheet if you want . 
   people sometimes run the other way when they hear the words ` hostel ' or ` dormitory ' , but hostels in japan are very clean and it 's a great way to get to know other travellers , especially if you 're going solo . 
  many hostels are in old houses and have tatami too , if you 're looking for something more traditional . 
   though this does n't really apply to big cities , in smaller towns i usually had the dorm all to myself anyway , and in most cases there was a separation of some kind ( may it be a curtain , half a wall , a more pod-like bed , etc. ), 
  so i could n't see the other people sleeping in the same room from my bed . 
  - ** food ** : 17,990 \u5186 total ( about 1200\u5186 / day ), 
   if you enjoy your food or like trying new cuisine while you 're travelling , then i 'm sure you 'd want to use a bit more than this on meals . 
  this gave me a bento breakfast bought in the konbini ( sometimes just an onigiri , other times i went for the whole sushi set with soba and boiled egg ) , a lunch for 600-800\u5186 and a dinner also bought at the konbini ( sometimes cup noodles or some other fast food , sometimes any bento that were on sale ) . 
   maybe not the healthiest way to eat , but for two weeks while travelling i survived just fine . 
  alternatively you could cook your own food at the hostel , but i was too lazy and did n't want to waste time . 
   i do n't drink so beer is n't included , but i usually had a vending machine drink every day at around 130\u5186 . 
  when it started to get hotter and i needed to drink more than that , i started buying big bottles of water or juice and it lasted me the whole day . 
  i made a point of tasting each local speciality if it looked good enough too , so i did n't feel like i was missing out on the japanese cuisine or something ( i 'm not much of a foodie ) . 
  - ** sightseeing ** : 11,770 \u5186 total ( about 850\u5186 / day ), 
   well , i 'm a huge museum fan . 
  if there 's a museum i 'll probably go there , whatever the topic may be . 
  to each their own , i guess . 
   here i 've included of course entrance fees to museums and gardens , as well as things like renting a bike , entrance to a kagura show in hiroshima ( 1000\u5186 ) , a boat ride in kurashiki ( 500\u5186 ) , etc. 
  i know in kyoto you have to pay for entry to many shrines and temples , but i did n't go to kyoto and visited none that had an entry fee . 
   look out for combination tickets to places within cities , for example the combination ticket for himeji castle + koko-en , or the one that includes kintai-kyo + ropeway + castle in iwakuni ( plus a discount ) . 
  when in tokyo on my first trip i had the grutt pass which was very very useful . 
   as a side note , ( small ) lockers at stations added up to 900\u5186 in total after 3 uses . 
  as a side note , the hiroshima prefectural museum of folklore in fukuyama ( next to the castle ) has lockers for 100\u5186 and they return the coin after use , so if you are going to fukuyama it might be a good idea to use those since the station lockers were more expensive than others i have seen ( entrance to the museum is 270\u5186 , while station lockers are 300\u5186 -- only 2 small ones -- and 700\u5186 the big ones ) . 
  - ** shopping ** : 10,830 \u5186 total ( about 730\u5186 / day ), 
   on my first trip i had about 7000\u5186 / day spending money and it was way more than enough for the type of things i wanted to buy ; i ended up buying so much that i thought i could do with much less on this trip and still have a great time . 
  after all , it 's the experiences you remember , the junk will eventually be lost or thrown away . 
   what took most of the money from this category were the goshuin temple stamps i got , at 300\u5186 each one . 
  the stamp book ( shuinch\u00f4 ) cost me 1000\u5186 at engyo-ji of mt.shosha ( himeji ) . 
   other examples of things i bought are a couple of books at hiroshima peace museum ( 2550\u5186 total ) , two tenugui that i used as towels and are now good souvenirs ( 856\u5186 the two ) , packet of 8 batteries ( 600\u5186 ) and a rice scoop at miyajima ( 360\u5186 ) . 
  well , there you have it . 
  ** total of everything ** : 100,610 \u5186 ( plane not included , since it depends on where you 're coming from ) . 
  that means about 6700\u5186 a day including accommodation !, 
  although last trip i had 15,000 \u5186 a day and definitely found a way to spend most of it . 
  ps : my plane ticket cost 585 euros roundtrip from/to barcelona and kansai airport ( osaka ) . 
  my father insisted i get an insurance just in case , so that was an extra 77 euros . 
  # packing list, 
  i tried to bring as little as possible in my bag so i would n't have to pay for the larger lockers ( many of the stations in small towns only have small sized lockers anyway , if any ) . 
  small lockers usually cost 300\u5186 and were much bigger than i was expecting . 
  i do n't know the exact measurements , but think two small school bags side by side would fit fine . 
  i always take ages to make my packing list , so for your convenience :, 
  - clothes ( 5 shirts / undies / pairs of socks , 1 jumper , 2 pants [ long + short ] , a very thin scarf ) + 2 pairs of shoes ( what i call my emo vans for the city + some sandals with straps ) . 
  i had to buy some extra underpants because i ran out of clean clothing ( i was trying to save money and not wash my clothes ) , so next time i think i will bring a couple more and also less socks . 
  - a wallet for coins + a money belt with my passport / plane ticket / insurance / most of my money hidden under my shirt, 
  - a plug converter , my tablet , cable for my tablet , camera + an extra memory card . 
  ca n't bring batteries on the plane , so i bought some while there . 
  - toiletries ( comb , toothbrush + paste , deodorant , shaver ) + ibuprofen . 
  i bought two small towel tenugui once i was there to use after my showers , and i had some packets of shampoo and gel that i used in some hostels where they did n't have any . 
  and a few extra things like a padlock for hostel lockers or my bag , an alarm clock ( not necessary if you have a phone with an alarm , but it always comes with me on my travels ) , origami paper for cranes since i was going to hiroshima and a foldable bag to carry with me during the daily sightseeing . 
  all of this easily fitted into a small bag that i had on the plane with me . 
  on my way back i filled this bag with food and checked it in , and bought another one at daiso that i filled with the rest of my stuff ( mostly just because they sell nice bags in japan and because i really like bean chips [ crisps , for those of you from the us ] that i ca n't find in spain ) . 
  anyway , i 'll stop talking now . 
  feel free to ask any questions !, 
  you can see photos here : https://tokyoanecdote.wordpress.com/2016/08/01/peace-sites-of-hiroshima/, 
  warning for this will be an emotional post ( and somewhat graphic ) for my first day in hiroshima visiting the peace park and museum . 
  i fitted in most of the a-bomb related sites into one day so i could enjoy a different and happier side of hiroshima for the days to come , but it ended up being pretty upsetting . 
  for the worst of reasons , hiroshima needs no introduction . 
  i had n't really learnt about hiroshima much at school : since i 'm from spain , spain and other european countries usually took the spotlight when it came to the history we learnt . 
  it was mentioned as something that happened but we spent very little time learning about japan or the us . 
  so before going i wanted to know as much as i could about the tragedy to properly understand the experiences of those who lived it and had been reading quite a bit about the bombing before i arrived . 
  unfortunately i was n't able to complete my senbazuru ( 1000 origami cranes ) in time , so i only brought 50 small squares of paper with me and made some cranes while there , leaving them at the different memorial sites individually . 
  leaving the hostel at 7:15 am i crossed the peace bridges south of the peace park along heiwa odori as i made my way to first find some breakfast . 
  i 'd seen old photos of one of the bridges from 1955 ( they were built in 1952 ) and had seen it pictured a couple of times as i was reading about the bombing before my trip . 
  i read that there had been a competition to design the bridge and the one existing today is that of the chosen winner , isamu noguchi . 
  one is named tsukuru ( to build ) while the second is yuku ( to depart ) , they are a symbol of the reconstruction of hiroshima after the bombing . 
  both are easy to find ; they 're on either side of the park behind the peace museum . 
  after buying my sushi breakfast at a konbini near hondori i decided to eat next to the dome . 
  it was constructed in 1915 as a facility for the display and sale of commercial products within hiroshima prefecture and was the location for the hiroshima prefecture art exhibition and other such events . 
  seeing it in 2d in photos was very different than having it right in front of me , the burns were so clear and i wondered how the building still managed to hold itself up . 
  the dome survived because it was almost directly below the explosion , meaning the pressure pressed down vertically and saved a few of the vertical walls . 
  of course there are other more technical reasons but that is n't my area of expertise and explaining it would be much too difficult for me . 
  if anyone is interested i 'm sure you can look it up and take it from someone who knows more about this . 
  i imagined people of the past walking around inside the building when it was still in its original shape . 
  what were they wearing at the time ? 
  were they in a hurry ? 
  were they talking to someone ? 
  what were they thinking about ? 
  i 'm sure their life was very different to mine , and yet we were both in this city with the same name . 
  before any sightseeing , i went to the bus centre to pick up a discount pass i 'll talk more about in the next post , but they turned me away since apparently i could only buy it the day before activating it or the same day . 
  it was almost eight and i had a date with the seiko clock at 8:15 so i walked there slowly over the t-shaped bridge . 
  otherwise known as the aioi bridge , this was the apparent target of the bomb . 
  even being so close to the hypocentre it somehow managed to survive and after a few repairs it was still usable for over 35 years .
