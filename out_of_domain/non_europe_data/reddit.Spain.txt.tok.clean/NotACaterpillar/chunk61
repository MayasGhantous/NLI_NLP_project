  thanks !, 
  i 'm a travel consultant and building my website , i need some photos that are n't `` homely '' , i 've had the same camera for about 10 years and while it still works it is n't good enough for the more professional photos i 'm needing to do now . 
  i know nothing about photography , as you 've probably noticed . 
  i have little intention of buying new lenses or building up a gear collection , i 'm really just looking for something that does higher resolution photos that i can also use to do videos . 
  i 've heard of point and shoot but i think a dslr would be best . 
  so far i 'm looking at buying [ this one ] ( https://www.amazon.co.jp/%e3%82%bd%e3%83%8b%e3%83%bc-sony-%e3%83%87%e3%82%b8%e3%82%bf%e3%83%ab%e4%b8%80%e7%9c%bc%e3%83%ac%e3%83%95-f3-5-5-6%e4%bb%98%e5%b1%9e-dslr-a350k/dp/b0013uvqr2/ref=sr_1_7?s=photo&ie=utf8&qid=1491245540&sr=1-7&keywords=dslr#productdetails ) but have no clue if it 's `` good '' or not . 
  my budget is anything under 600 us dollars , though i 'd be more comfortable if it 's closer to 300 , and i 'll be buying it on amazon japan ( i have many gift cards ) . 
  any help on decision-making or recommendations would be great . 
  thanks !, 
  i 'll soon be spending a week in yamagata prefecture and while there i would like to attend a maiko show . 
  of course , this is a quite popular show so i need to make a reservation in advance . 
  they do n't speak any english ( nor i japanese ) so with the help of google translator i 've managed to write more or less the email i 'd like to send them . 
  i 'd really appreciate if any of you could make sure it 's well written ( or at least makes sense ) , as we all know that google translator is n't always the most reliable source . 
  this is what i have :, 
  that second sentence is supposed to say `` i 'd like to make a reservation for the maiko performance ( no meal , i would like the 2pm show ) . 
  would july 2nd be okay ? '', 
  i 'm also worried this may be too direct or informal ... ? 
  thank you for any help i can get !, 
  i think there are few proper full reviews about using highway buses in japan . 
  most people use a jr pass and shinkansen to move around and the people who do use buses do n't seem to talk about it that much , so i thought i 'd contribute my experience for those looking for a cheaper way to move around . 
  i used willer 's bus pass and did 5 overnight trips . 
  # buying / using the bus pass, 
  there are many versions of the pass depending on dates used and amount of days the pass will be active . 
  i bought the ** mon-thu 5 day ** one for ** 12,500 yen ** . 
  this is the best deal , even though the 3 day one is cheaper , since five nights at that price amounts to 2500 yen/night , about what i 'd pay for a night in a hostel anyway ( the 3 day pass would be 3333 yen/night ) . 
  i was quite confused at the start about how the payment would be done , but the process is straightforward and easy once it is understood . 
  the bus pass is n't a physical pass per se , they give you no tickets or papers , but rather more of an online reservation method . 
  clicking on the [ `` buy bus pass '' link here ] ( http://willerexpress.com/st/3/en/pc/buspass/#buy ) will get you started . 
  ** how to use the bus pass : **, 
  1 - ** become a willer member ** ( meaning , simply register to their website ) . 
  once you 've registered you 'll be able to make bookings ( and later check , edit and cancel them ) via your ` my page ' . 
  2 - ** buy the bus pass ** . 
  you click on the button saying `` buy bus pass '' and it 's pretty straightforward from there . 
  though their faq mentions various payment methods , these are only when buying tickets individually , and not when using a pass . 
  when using a bus pass , they will charge you directly through your bank account . 
  3 - ** book the trips ** . 
  once you 've bought the bus pass ( and they 've taken your money ) , you can start making the reservations for select journeys . 
  there 's a convenient map of all the journeys the bus pass offers [ on their website ] ( http://willerexpress.com/st/3/en/pc/buspass/ ) , note that willer has other buses that are n't available to use with the pass ( such as tokyo - mt.fuji ) . 
  each journey has [ more than just one pick-up and drop-off place ] ( http://i.imgur.com/6jezrwc.png ) . 
  for example , if going from kansai --  kanto , you can hop onto the bus at osaka , kyoto , kusatsu or hikone , and get off at either kawasaki , shinjuku or disneyland . 
  if you were to buy the tickets individually choosing one option or another would impact the price ( going from osaka to disneyland would be more expensive than going from osaka to kawasaki ) , but with the bus pass you 've already paid the fixed fee . 
  after the [ confirmation page ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wuuoz1q.png ) , the journey will be added to your cart . 
  however , the process is n't over yet . 
  you can either go to the bottom of the page where there 'll be a button saying something like `` add another journey '' , from which you can select another route to add to the cart if you wish , or you click `` reserve '' once all the journeys are added and go through another confirmation screen . 
  it 's similar to amazon 's `` proceed to check-out '' once you have all items in the cart . 
  if using a bus pass make sure to select the `` use the bus pass '' option ( [ see red box ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wof2l9t.png ) ) so you wo n't have to pay the fee separately . 
  once finished , an email will be sent to the address given when you registered as a willer member , with the mentioned ** maps of the boarding locations ** , your ** reservation number and details ** , etc. 
  this email works as your bus ticket , you might have to show it when getting on the bus ( although they never asked me to show it , they had my name written down and that was enough ) . 
  # journey reviews, 
  ** departure ** : 24:40 hikone station rotatory bus stop 2, 
  ** arrival ** : 07:25 kawasaki station east exit , next to la cittadella, 
  hikone 's bus stop is very easy to find as it 's a small city and there is n't much room for confusion . 
  the bus arrived a few minutes before departure time and the luggage in the boot was sorted by arrival location . 
  because i had been told that the buses were very uncomfortable , i was expecting the worse , however i was quite surprised by how good it was . 
  the bus had outlets for me to charge my tablet ( although i did n't discover this until the end , they were on the wall but quite far down and hidden ) , because i was in last row the seat leaned backwards very far and i could stretch my legs in the isle . 
  the bus was almost totally dark , save a line of blue futuristic lights on the floor , and each seat had a sort of cover/hat that could be pulled over one 's head to hide from any light or prying eyes . 
  it was , however , quite chilly ( similar to airplanes ) even with my jumper on so i used both my and my absent neighbour 's blankets . 
  we did three rest stops ; somewhere in aichi ( judging by the omiyage ) , shizuoka ( they sell mt.fuji shaped mochis for 1000 yen , but really nothing else you ca n't get at a regular konbini ) and somewhere else . 
  i fell asleep before we 'd even made it out of hikone and slept almost through the entire ride , only waking up for the first two rest stops . 
  because of this , i was worried that i 'd sleep past my stop too , but it was fine since the driver turns on the lights and announces the arrival through the mic . 
  i arrived fully rested at kawasaki , but i did miss not being able to have a shower or wash up properly . 
  ** departure ** : 21:40 shinjuku station bus centre ( south exit ), 
  ** arrival ** : 05:05 morioka station west exit , bus stop 27, 
  the shinjuku bus centre may seem hard to find but the signs in seibu-shinjuku station are quite clear if you pay attention . 
  coming from the yamanote line to shinjuku station , the signs are less clear , so it 's best to simply find the south exit first and go from there . 
  there are apparently two bus terminals , you 'll probably want the one on the south exit , check your details and only follow the signs for the south exit bus terminal . 
  my biggest complaint about the terminal is that the seats do n't have a back , meaning i ca n't lean back and instead usually lean forward , constantly putting weight on my legs all day , and that they have no plugs . 
  they do have good fast wifi though . 
  the bus terminal was quite crowded , while they do have lockers ( small ones are 100 yen for 2h ) they were usually all taken at all times . 
  there 's a door leading to the sky deck in case you want to eat your bento/snacks up there , the shopping mall next door has a robot and there are also nice views of the train tracks from the bus departure gates further away if you 're doing a loop to stretch your legs . 
  the announcements are only made in japanese so pay attention to the time and the screens with your gate yourself . 
  this ride was less comfortable than the first , there were no plugs and i had a window seat in the middle of the bus so i had less space . 
  however , i did fall asleep for longer and only woke up at one of the rest stops ( miyagi ) . 
  after departure the driver kept talking through the mic for quite a while , which was slightly annoying . 
  because it was my second night in a row on a bus , once in morioka i realised that my feet were * very * swollen and had to spend most of the day sitting down . 
  on future journeys i wore some of my looser socks that would n't be tight around my legs , as well as putting my legs up while waiting for the bus , and that seemed to help .
