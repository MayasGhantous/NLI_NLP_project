yep , i 'd love to see something similar to the codex in swtor . 
  i need that mistwild greatsword , please do n't be a npc-only item ... 
  nice , i 'll get onto it this evening . 
  this is why i avoid dubbing . 
  woah . 
   i ca n't see a downside to having the info boss mods provide, 
  it 's all pretty much redundant once you get the hang of a fight and know when something is coming , the default ui has had alerts for years now . 
  hell , if it were up to me i 'd kill all the apis related to them so people would have to start raiding by looking at the boss animations instead of a bunch of numbers , if there 's something great about guild wars 2 is the addon-less raiding experience . 
   young gays really need to learn about our history and culture, 
  what does homosexuality have to do with history or culture ? 
  there 's no such thing as the `` homosexual peoples '' , or a homosexual language , or a homosexual philosophy , or somewhat unifed homosexual moral derived into a homosexual law , or homosexual customs nor have homosexuals ever formed and lived in their own specific societies ... you know , all the things that define what a culture is . 
  am i supposed to learn about the `` history and culture '' of my brown eyes or my counterclockwise hair patterns too ? 
   * reasoning , how does it work ? 
  i guess expecting a person to have arguments to back their preaching is too much , at least on reddit . 
   * a bunch of trolls post some shit on some internet forum . 
   `` lgbt family mod sparks homophobic backlash '', 
  is this journalism ? 
  it will be onyxia ... ** reborn ** ... again . 
  sounds like you dislike videogames . 
  successful means the boss is dead , period . 
  that 's the goal that this particular part of the game is designed around , everything else would be nothing more than your own arbitrary restrictions . 
  raids are not competitive play . 
   its a game mechanic, 
  we 're also living in the current year , but that 's not an argument either . 
   bioware, 
  it 's funny how some people still think that andromeda wo n't be another blunder , assuming it releases at all . 
   bioware started by following market trends . 
  which at the time , meant dnd based ip 's to tap into the rpg market , and using star wars to tap into the star wars fan market, 
  the rpg genre has always been absolutely nothing more than a niche . 
  one wildly sucessful game ( skyrim ) does not change that fact , specially when as far as design goes the open world stuff that bethesda does has pretty much nothing in common with the good games that bioware used to make . 
   the pressure is on for andromeda . 
  if it fails it might well be the end for bioware . 
  oh it will , you ca n't make yet another mediocre gears of war clone in 2017 and have the success that ea expects when they put the big bucks just because you made the cutscenes a bit fancier and slapped an `` rpg '' label on it . 
   the critically acclaimed success stories of the past two decades from bioware that have net probably a couple hundred million dollars in total profit revenue, 
  let 's put things in perspective , skyrim ( or any other similarly successful game ) made more profit than absolutely everything bioware has done in the last 20 years combined . 
  between the gear from marks of honor and invasions i do n't think there will be a significant amount of demand for fairly expensive crafted stuff that is 5 ilvls higher at best . 
  but as usual , if you 're the only one posting , it will probably sell . 
  trying to make some kind of point about the total revenue being similar when he 's comparing a single development cycle to almost 20 years of running an expensive studio is beyond ridiculous to begin with . 
  but i certainly wo n't bother explaining basic high school math / economics to random people on reddit . 
  fact is that bioware never made big bucks but they used to make great ( cult even ) games , now they do neither . 
  edge extensions , android notification mirroring and the ubuntu subsystem ( i 'd rather see cmd slowly replaced by bash for the long run , but it 's something i guess ... ), 
   i played dota 2 for a while , and i 've heard the word faggot and the phrase ` eat shit and die homo ' so many times i 'm almost used to it . 
  good , keep working on it , being a sane adult includes being able to filter noise when interacting with complete strangers over tcp/ip . 
   i guess it 's just part of being straight . 
  * i guess being a delicate flower it 's just a part of being gay . 
  your bigotry is showing , i 'm not sure if you 're aware . 
   also i tend to mod the game a lot before i play them , and it 's really tiring trying to find mods that i like.for example , when i tried to play fallout 4 , i had to look very hard to find mods that were for male characters.when you browse websites like nexus mods , it 's all boobs and pussies and hairstyle for female characters . 
   and you know they are all for straight guys.there are like 2 or 3 mods in the ocean of ` more hairstyles for females ' and ` vivid pink vagina and absurdly huge tits ' . 
  like anyone who has ever worked on mods could tell you they are completely thankless efforts and absolutely nobody cares about how entitled you might feel to have modded penises in some videogame . 
  if you want to be useful , stop complaining about heterosexual programmers / artists not working on homosexual stuff for free and ** go make them yourself ** instead . 
   i swear sometimes it 's almost exhausting being a gaymer in the a world filled with straight guys . 
  oh dear ... that 's like worse than being drafted into the ww2 , i do n't know how you live with such plight . 
  i 've met lots of great people playing dota2 and heroes of the storm , you might be doing something wrong . 
   i doubt we 're gon na get reinhardt in a singlet . 
  good , because i 'd spend any money necessary to get that , and according to the `` only on this time limited lootboxes '' leak that could be thousands of euros . 
   it means they are exclusive which is what you want in skins . 
  i want skins that are visually appealing , why the fuck would i care if other people have them as well ? 
  hell , ideally i would want everyone to have access to all the skins , exclusivity is objectively inferior . 
   its the same reason we ca n't just print more money when the economy gets bad without having inflation . 
  did you just try to compare the concept of fiat money to a bunch of pixels on a computer game ? 
  i ca n't even .

   if you have openssl installed on a linux box you can try throwing some passwords at it . 
  sounds like a great excuse to play with bash and the linux subsystem that was just added to windows 10 . 
  from ubuntu 16.04 onwards, 
  works too . 
  \\  tfw you go back to the 90s, 
   tfw you ca n't escape reddit 's formatting, 
  i do n't want anything with the prefix `` open '' installed in mah c : \\ program files \\, 
  who do you think i am ? 
  a communist ? 
   i do n't blame you for not keeping with the story . 
  i think you are correct in saying the best story ended with wrath and i 've got no idea about wod either . 
  except mists of pandaria had 10 times better lore than wrath , they actually expanded the universe in several different directions and introduced lots of new interesting elements ( like the sha ) instead of endlessly milking the unfinished arthas campaign from warcraft 3 :, 
  \\ - * here , have this vanilla raid upscaled to lvl 80 , lul ... *, 
  \\ - * welcome to ulduar , the only genuinely interesting thing from this expansion . 
  \\ - * icc is still not ready so have this filler patch with by far the worst wow raid ever created . 
  \\ - * here , have icc and the end of arthas ' story , it only took us 6 years \\ o / *, 
  wod was indeed nonsense though . 
  the legion invasions and broken shore event starts in a week , august 9 . 
   women are disadvantaged all over the world, 
  nope . 
  some women are massively disadvantaged in some regards in some places while other women are massively privileged in some regards in some places , just like men . 
  i know that acknowledging that the world is a significantly more complicated place than `` muh women are oppressed lul '' is scary when you like dogma-style simple ideology , but the universe does n't care . 
  every single country on earth . 
  now choose a particular aspect if you want to look at the differences . 
   show me a country where men are culturally disadvantaged in power roles . 
  government , family , etc. 
  every single representative democracy where women represent more than 50 % of the voting base , which is most of them since the worldwide gender distribution is roughly 51-49 % in favor of women , not to mention they get to live significantly longer within the voting age ( thus having a couple more opportunities to exercise that power ) . 
   show me a majority matriarchal society . 
  first you 'd have to give your particular definition for the buzzword , if you mean a society politically led by a woman then germany for example is a `` matriarchal society '' , so were brazil and argentina until very recently , so will probably be the united states in a few months . 
   there are men who end up culturally disadvantaged in every country of the world , but ** never simply because of their gender ** . 
  remind me , how many millions of women got indiscriminately drafted to die in the ww2 ? 
   that is definitely unfair towards men , and should be revised, 
  or should it ? 
  a woman army is objectively inferior to a men army . 
  is knowingly making an inferior army the right choice ? 
  like i said before the universe does n't care about people 's feelings and no amount of political correctness will ever change biology .
