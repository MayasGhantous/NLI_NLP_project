  nope , wasapi ( win vista/7/8 / 10 ) has lower latency on decent hardware . 
  audio on off-the-shelf gnulinux is indeed a mess though . 
   when competitors have 200-400 ms of latency, 
  where did this stupid meme come from ? 
  my home , full of crap , win10 installation has a roundtrip latency of ** 5ms ** ( wasapi exclusive ) . 
   using windows 7, 
  there , i found your problem . 
  using a ** 7 years old ** os and expecting modern hardware to work properly is simply absurd . 
  ahh yes , the * copying = = stealing * meme again . 
  it 's getting a bit tiresome already . 
   console 's convenience overwhelms other pcs benefits more and more . 
  when was the last time you touched a console ? 
  they get less and less convenient with each iteration . 
  the idea of coming home with a game , pressing a button and be playing in 20 seconds is pure fantasy at this point . 
  you should play the other three , not because they 're necessary ( this is a reboot in everything but name ) but because they 're vastly better than what andromeda will end up being if inquisition was any indication . 
  did you just imply that men do n't suck dick ? 
  check your heterosexual privilege . 
  it 's fine , middle of the pack , decent utility . 
  welcome to the internet . 
  deal with it . 
  why should anyone give a single fuck about wikipedia 's rules though ? 
  this is not wikipedia . 
   there 's a reason wikipedia is a really good source of information . 
  this is the most stupid thing i 've read in like 48 hours . 
  just ask 2 guildies for a favor , it 's literally 5 minutes ... 
   what the fuck is `` spanish heritage '' ? 
  good question . 
   what the fuck is `` spanish heritage '' ? 
  good question . 
  the second thing i do when installing a browser is blocking remote fonts . 
  i love the new horse , i just hope it replaces the divine steed model . 
  ret is not `` super strong '' by any possible measure . 
  we 're * fine * , middle ~ upper of the pack . 
   * characters with gear that has only dropped for the blessed 0.0001 % can do top parses . 
  amazing insights , are you a data scientist ? 
  games between 2 and 7 , 2 for things like counter strike and 7 for something like gtav or the witcher 3 . 
  but the general * snappiness * of your computer will be a 12 in comparison . 
  nah , i 'm a perfectly fine ret paladin but we 're not talking about me . 
  [ reality ] ( https://www.warcraftlogs.com/statistics/10# ) gives zero shits about impossibly optimized sims . 
  yep , legion is awesome . 
  we 're still kinda drowning in content and there 's a miniraid ( 3 bosses ) coming next week , along with a few suramar story quests every week , the nighthold ( 10 bosses ) in less than two months and they have already presented the next big patch with lots of open world content and another big raid + dungeon at blizzcon ... 
  swtor however is still nice if you come every now and then to do the story stuff . 
  obviously not , that 's exactly how the reddit works . 
   if this subreddit has that much worthless fluff then dont come here . 
  self-awareness levels are below sea level already ... 
  maybe you 're the one that should leave if you do n't like how people vote ? 
  just maybe eh . 
  then feel free to do so , you do n't need upvotes for that , just sorting `` by new '' . 
   no one likes visiting a place that is constantly negative . 
  i like it here . 
  maybe you should stop selling your purely personal opinion as some sort of fact ? 
  i do masturbate furiously , but that has nothing to do with r/swtor . 
  i 'll be playing the story with my ~ ~ now force sensitive mary sue ~ ~ trusty trooper , but i 'll probably leave afterwards . 
  it would be nice to have some sort of stat to back it up . 
  not to distrust your wild imagination , but i 've yet to encounter anyone that sounded under 20 in overwatch . 
  widowmaker had a husband , that 's it . 
  blizzard is widely known for generally avoiding sexual / romatical stuff ( not just the homosexual one ) but i guess that does n't fit the perpetual victim narrative . 
  why would anyone care about what other people assume though ? 
  it literally can not change your experience with the game in any way . 
   and they want to see their own lives reflected, 
  yeah , i 'm an edgy supersoldier zombie and i wo n't feel validated unless reaper says is homosexual . 
   cause the designers are going to have their own opinions about gay people anyway , if they are homophobic and do not wish to have anything to do with the lgbt crowd , so be it . 
  designers portraying a wildly homophobic world as homophobic does not make them homophobic , it makes them good , consistent designers , that 's why they created what i think it is the best [ homosexual character ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maarmhjfp9o ) in games so far . 
   trust me . 
  us lesbians want this kind of representation . 
  why am i supposed trust you ? 
  that 's absolutely nothing more than your personal opinion ... 
  yes , raynor / kerrigan , thrall / aggra , malfurion / tyrande and jaina / arthas . 
  that 's only four somewhat important romantic elements shown in more than 20 years of making games . 
  that sounds like `` tumblirinas agree '' to be completely honest ... guess we 'll never know . 
  yeah , i 'm really not feeling the dubstep / inceptionlol trash . 
   i really hope we do n't get a `` chosen one '' plot with this ... 
  i really hope we do , because i ca n't see bioware pulling any other story tbh . 
  there 's absolutely nothing wrong with sticking to what you do best . 
  not sure if this is halo 6 , call of dooty or titanfall 2 . 
  gameplay makes for the objectively best trailers , since they 're the only ones that actually show the product . 
  [ skyrim ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsrtypnron0 ) , [ overwatch ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyc44ypb_5k ) or [ portal ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlurvbhmf8w ) are really great examples . 
  inquisition . 
  he 's supposed to be very young and it 's not uncommon to still have a patchy beard during late teens / early 20 's . 
  i 'd say it is a nice touch . 
  the slow pacing that me 's `` screw up '' allowed for is actually the thing that made kaidan 's relationship with broshep the most interesting romance in any bioware game , or at a very least , the most believable . 
  yes ? 
  the fact that shepard and kaidan are just * really good friends * in me is what makes the whole arc so much better , specially if you paid some attention to what he says in me2 . 
  also , liara was romanceable by femsheps . 
  i specially like how the cover goes from beautiful to hideous as you pay more for the game . 
  anyway ... `` preordering '' digital goods is so beyond retarded that i ca n't even begin to understand the support for it . 
  edit : ok , apparently he 's some youtuber that is buttmad because reddit has rules against his spam , how surprising ... 
   showing gameplay early results in whining about `` vertical slices '' and the industry being evil and misleading . 
  please point us to all these people complaining about companies like [ blizzard ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyc44ypb_5k ) , [ bethesda ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsrtypnron0 ) or [ valve ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlurvbhmf8w ) showing great trailers based on actual gameplay instead of a mix of bullshots , dubstep inspired * music * and stupid whaaaaaaaaaams . 
  it 's also not like decent internet connections are not 2mb/s anymore and games take minutes to download , right ? 
  in this universe , where fallout 4 ** is ** an ugly game by todays standards , what 's the problem exactly ? 
  that feedback was possible precisely because of that , please point me one instance of anyone complaining about them showing the ugly real thing instead of pretty bullshit . 
  reddit as a site has rules about spam , reiterated self-promotion is reason for a ban , it 's not a sub-specific thing . 
  absolutely nobody complained about bethesda showing a fallout 4 trailer , they complained about fallout 4 itself . 
  stop pretending that your reading comprehension is that of a 4yo , i 'm sure it 's not . 
  [ meanwhile . 
  as someone from across the atlantic , i 'm relieved . 
  i was not looking forward have a saudi-funded warmonger maniac in charge of the world 's biggest army , we really do n't need her and her colleages to destroy any more mena countries and leave the problem at our doorstep yet again , there are more than enough problems as it is . 
  and there 's good chance that trump 's disdain for nato 's leeches will speed up the eu army talks and increase european military spending across the board , which is something that i 've always supported . 
   psycology,
