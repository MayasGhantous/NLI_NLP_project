  lol, 
  he asked for actual , measurable evidence , and psicology simply ca n't provide it . 
   the minimum requirement for battlefield 1 is an i5-6600k . 
  that is bullshit , you can play bf1 perfectly fine with much weaker cpus . 
  studios just slap massively bloated requirements on the box these days , it saves them for giving support to anything below that . 
  if inquisition is any indication , bioware are nowhere near as good as dice with frostbite , it looked significantly worse than battlefield 4 while being more demanding even though bf4 is also a much bigger , multiplayer game . 
  garrus , by far . 
  it 's just a fact , not some sort of judgement . 
   at this point he looks too much like a high school teenager with some facial hair . 
  he pretty much is , so they did a good job . 
  we do n't know their exact age , but the ryder twins leave the milky way on their late teens / early twenties , they 're not supposed to be seasoned shepard-style elite soldiers in any shape or form . 
  define `` best '' . 
  in different ways and no particular order i 'd say mass effect 3 , the witcher 3 and telltale 's walking dead . 
  as a user , ** do not ** touch any program 's scheduling priority , period . 
  i still do n't understand why microsoft keeps shipping that option on non-entreprise windows versions ... 
  r/the _ meltdown, 
  low effort / low quality / literally useless posts . 
  such as this one . 
  did you just assume my epidermal melanin concentration ? 
  yep , get out . 
  i can see that kind of * exigence * being needed on a progression top 100 mythic guild , for anything else it 's completely unwarranted . 
   you 're really relating a simple , harmless , tweak to taking cocaine ? 
  wtf is wrong with you . 
  maybe , it 's mostly opinion of course . 
  i think it would be vastly easier for those new players to read the sidebar or make a 5 seconds web search . 
  i would n't recommend it even for free . 
   introducing ~ ~ visual studio for mac ~ ~ another monodevelop rename . 
   * dae le evil m$ trying to take over osx ? 
   spotify sucks , and spotify does n't care . 
  ftfy, 
  why . 
  this is getting more and more ridiculous ... 
  do n't forget about that sweet google drive client that was * almost ready * years ago . 
  vscode has absolutely nothing in common with atom other than both being text editors and being built on the electron framework . 
  that 's like saying that chrome is a firefox spin-off because they 're both web browsers built using c++ . 
   * a peek inside the application shows a number of atom resources . 
  those are electron resources as [ anyone can see on their github ] ( https://github.com/electron/electron ) , feel free to let the author know that he 's wrong . 
  vscode is [ monaco ] ( https://github.com/microsoft/monaco-editor ) running on that electron shell . 
  running swtor on a terminal would be even faster , but i would n't recommend it either . 
   is bastion cheese still a thing ? 
  it never was . 
   what is that about mercy flying forever ? 
  nothing ? 
  a flying mercy figuratively useless against many widely used heroes , she dies in 1 ~ 3 shots . 
   who can stealth ? 
  sombra can stealth for a few seconds , but it breaks on any hit and she has pretty low damage . 
   who has the best escape ? 
  sombra / tracer depending on the situation , usually the former . 
   who has an area of effect ultimate that kills everyone ? 
  many ultimates can kill an entire team , situationally . 
   and how well they have hidden homosexuality away . 
  that childish bitterness looks bad on you . 
  i find it vastly more engaging than the generic gow wannabes that me2/3 are . 
  because it 's an rpg with some shooting elements instead of a shooter with some rpg elements . 
  good rpgs with shooting mechanics are very hard to find while generic shooters are dime a dozen , why would i want to play mass effect 2/3 for it 's gameplay when things like vanquish or gears of war exist ? 
  it 's a much bigger game though , but they wo n't waste half of it on marketing . 
  if you find yourself saying `` joder tio '' on a regular basis , the answer is spanish . 
  stop telling people what to tell other people . 
  even norn armor looks better on humans lol, 
  feels good to be the master race . 
  i would rather not have such expensive weapons changed . 
  i crafted my fps because it was the only legendary with just one flashy effect that fit into a fairly subtle , tasteful theme instead of obnoxious sounds and completely unnecesary `` lel look at me '' auras , led footprints or modified skills . 
  now i have it transmuted away . 
  it should be extremely easy to make those particular waypoints have cost 0 for characters that belong to a particular account ( read : one that has purchased those items ) . 
   * influencer *, 
  that 's the most retarded buzzword i 've ever heard , and i 've head quite a few of them . 
   sociology, 
  lmao already, 
  extremely easy ? 
  if it 's not coming to winforms / wpf , i could n't care less . 
  well , they 're wrong . 
  that 's not how http works . 
  i wish blizzard would take note from arenanet and host [ their own wiki for players to create and use . 
  ] ( https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/main_page ), 
  we get the best of both worlds , a single source of truth for virtually everything in-game but without having to compromise on anything to stay up since the costs are fairly negligible for a big game company . 
  flux is a hack , and one that does n't even work with most exclusive fullscreen applications . 
  i 'm very grateful for the work that those guys have done ( i 've been using it for years ) but it 's time for operative systems to pick up on this , android / ios have already done so . 
  i use tkl because i 've literally never used the numpad . 
  why the fuck would i want to move my hands from the rest posistion to type numbers ? 
  they 've been always better , just much more expensive to the point where most people could n't justify buying them . 
  more people slowly buying them is what eventually made them explode , as production raises prices go down and thus even more people get into them as they slowly get priced into the mainstream , it 's a feedback loop . 
   those are not mutually exclusive when it comes to digital files , though . 
  yes , they are , regarless of how much copyright lobbies may try to twist extremely simple logic . 
  you can not steal something digital in nature , period . 
  you can commit copyright infringement or violate whatever some other law may say , but there will never be absolutely nothing being stolen , it 's being ** copied ** . 
  i reach all the numbers without moving my hand already . 
  easier in fact , since i can insert letters between them without having to find the rest position again . 
  ** tl ; dr ** : when two things have different names , it is because they are different things . 
  i do n't acknowledge buzzwords such as * intellectual property * , the government-granted monopolies over ideas ( namely : patents , copyright , etc. . . ) are all different in both nature and intent . 
  regardless on any reasonable person 's opinion on each one of them , trying to somehow make them all equal by trying to imply that they share their nature with the concept of property ( which is a concept that by its nature can only applied to physical things ) is completely absurd . 
  how supposedly reasonable people ca n't see through such cheap agenda genuinely baffles me . 
   the definition of stealing is to take someone else 's property without the rights to do so . 
  yeah , and copying takes absolutely nothing away , it just independently creates something . 
   if you were to steal something in real life , it doesnt matter if its a one-off item or something they have thousands of in stock . 
  if someone steals something i own my stock becomes ( stock - 1 ) , i lost a unit of whatever i owned . 
  if someone pirates something i created my stock remains _ infinite _ , i did n't lose absolutely anything about my idea , a completely independent copy was created . 
  even if you want to add capitalism into the mix design a way to monetize artistic ideas through a concept of copyright the situation stays the same , that particular copy will be illegal because it is a byproduct of ** copyright infringement ** , it was ** copied ** illegally , not stolen from anyone or anywhere . 
   say you spent hundred of hours making a mod for a game ... 
  whatever i do or do not do has absolutely no bearing on the nature of copyright or property . 
  you seem to think that i 'm somehow expressing my personal opinion about copyright ... which is not the case .
