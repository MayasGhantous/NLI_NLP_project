   uploaded it under your account on one specific site , specifying that others are not allowed to upload it on other sites , and people still did - maybe even on sites that charge for downloads ( or maybe getting adsense money ) . 
  you would be ok with that ? 
  whether of not i am ok with it is 100 % irrelevant , we 're talking law . 
  in spain or the us ( the ones i know ) that 'd be copyright infringement , certainly not theft thought , since nothing was stolen . 
   you wouldnt feel like it was stolen from you ? 
  again , i do n't see how * my feels * are relevant to anything , but no , i would n't feel like anything was stolen from me , i 'd feel like someone is breaking the copyright that the government gave me which of course could be a problem for me if i expected to profit from it . 
   since its `` just '' a copy ? 
  i mean , you dont hold a copyright on it or anything , so theres nothing legally preventing people doing so . 
  what ? 
  the fact that is called ** copy ** - ** right ** should be pretty self-explanatory ... the government has given me an exclusive right to make copies of that particular thing , other people making them would indeed be illegal . 
  again , copyright infringement , not theft . 
   i realize companies arent people and dont get their feelings hurt in the same way ( or at least they shouldnt lol ) , but its interesting nonetheless . 
  not really , copyright is something that was only created to make the monetization of openly shown ideas possible , it 's absolutely nothing more than economic interest made law , there 're no * feelings * involved . 
   the other argument is that whether or not the item was physically stolen or copied is irrelevant, 
  how is pointing out that two completely different things are completely different `` irrelevant '' . 
  in one case ( theft ) you have one item , which is taken away from someone , in the other there are 2 items : a new independently created one and the original one , which remains completely untouched . 
  there 's no loss anywhere , one thing existed , now 2 things exist . 
   revenue they are being deprived of regardless if its a physical or digital item in question . 
  being deprived of revenue is not theft . 
  the universe is definitely not `` stealing '' from beach bars when atmospheric variations cause rain . 
   at this point in the conversation , im not particularly leaning towards one side or the other , its just a interesting discussion . 
  there 's no discussion , really . 
  copyright infingement is not theft , regardless on anyone 's opinion on copyright ( or property ) . 
   the legal definitions are still lagging behind technical aspects , even though online pirating has been widespread for well over 10 years now . 
  i do n't think it is fundamentally a legal problem , i 'd say it 's a technological one . 
  the idea of the internet is simply not compatible with the concept of copyright , and to make it compatible we would have to somehow ban encryption worldwide in an enforceable manner ** and ** give absolute power over the networks to every single government in the world ... even if we were to disregard the privacy implications of that , i really do n't see how it could possibly begin to work in the first place . 
  so it comes down to a choice between entertainment-related ideas being something that you can reliably build huge industries around or giving up the internet as we know it . 
  personally , as someone who writes software for a living , i am not fundamentally against the idea of copyright and i genuinely think that it has been a very useful tool in the past , copyright today however , has not only become a monstrosity in most of the world ( we can thank disney 's influence over the us government for that ) but also something that is not realistically enforceable due to the creation of worldwide networks , and a law that can not be enforced should n't law just because there 're some big industries that pretend it could be . 
  so in the end , i 'll always take the idea of a free internet over a bigger selection of superstar-driven pop music or huge-budget movie entertainment but i do see it as what it is : a trade-off . 
  they ca n't even ban you , that 's simply not how tcp/ip works ... 
  if you put up a web server you know the deal , either do n't create a public website or go make your own internet . 
   because to be fair , unlike british , roman , persian , german , spanish , and muslim conquest ... 
  the colonials did n't actually try to conquer the native americans , they actually attempted to coexist, 
  meanwhile , in this universe , the by far biggest genocide in human history happened in north america and no amount of * evil spaniards / romans / muslims * memeing will change that fact . 
  if they wanted to move ** forward ** they 'd keep updating wpf with the latest and greatest . 
  but no , they want to move sideways ... and end up moving backwards , uwp is one of the worst jokes ever told . 
  it should have been resdesigned before launching windows 10 . 
  that you 'll see even more non-consistent elements around windows 's ui . 
   ip is a buzzword now ? 
  what do you mean now ? 
  it has always been . 
  buzzword , catchphrase , meme ... whatever you want to call it , it 's certainly something that is not defined in any clear way and carries a pretty heavy agenda with it ( trying to imply that ideas could be property ) . 
   you now have in your possession an item that you ** should have paid ** for and did not, 
  says who ? 
  maybe i 'm an anarchist that gives 0 shits about the concept of property , there would be no reason for me to care unless there 's a body to enforce some law that says i ca n't do that . 
  if we 're talking law , there 's absolutely nothing wrong with using law terms , quite the opposite . 
  it 's pretty cute how you think that anyone actually cares about anyone else 's armor . 
  i 'd pay ** big ** gems for a `` show standard models '' setting for pve that kept things somewhat lore-consistent . 
   that 's just a dumb reason honestly, 
  the fuck ? 
  if you have n't noticed this is mmo ** rpg ** and immersion is the cornerstone of anything that would call itself an rpg . 
   they make a weapon/armor look more elite-looking . 
  now i 'm starting to understand the shinny nonsense that plagues gaming peripherals , leds are 1337 . 
   character model quality  lowest, 
  does n't remove wings , random leds or the leaky nonsense that falls from most legendaries . 
  nice . 
   having feelings makes you a girl , got it . 
  no , you did n't get absolutely anything . 
   as long as we support windows xp , we have to support dx9 . 
  i ca n't believe that there is a non-negligible amount people still playing gw2 on windows xp ... 
  dorian and sera . 
  nah , keep that data hidden . 
  limiting the information that players have access to is very much a design decision , and one that has made gw2 a significantly more pleasing experience than other mmos , in fact , i 'd love if they removed damage numbers altogether . 
  it 's been more than 20 years , surely there must be more inmersive / interesting ways to give players feedback about their actions than to splatter unsigned integers all over the screen . 
   lets say a group asks for 100 legendary insights to join . 
  if they had a dps meter they would ask for 30k dps . 
  sure they could ... but they wo n't . 
  they 'll ask for both . 
  ** source ** : lot 's of years of experience dealing with humans and their reactions to natural incentives . 
   perform bad, 
  ** player 1 ** : 15k dps , 5k damage to breakbars , 6 downed people ressed, 
  ** player 2 ** : 17k dps , 2k damage to breakbars , did n't press f once, 
  whoops !, 
  dmg meter just made you kick a vastly better player for absolutely no reason , and this is an extremely dumbed down scenario , in a real raid there are a lot more variables , many of them class specific . 
   it 's really amazing what you can track there, 
  until it 's pretty much needed to perform well in mythic raids and you get tired of looking at graphs and spreadsheets during your ( usually ) limited free time instead of playing the game itself . 
  there 's a lot of value in being presented with a moderately challeging group content with lax requirements where you can just slay bad guys without worring about anything . 
   any team that is remotely serious uses logs, 
  this . 
  and like anyone who has ever lead a decent raid team could tell you , trying to find anything but the most obvious and specific mistakes in them to down that last tier boss ends up sucking a lot of time . 
   and then gw2 introduces raid - the most toxicity generating content in all mmos . 
  it is also the most casual raid in all mmos , by far . 
  which very much proves his point . 
   give them tools to actually improve at ... 
  a dps meter wo n't help anyone that needs to improve at forsaken thicket . 
  if you 're not succeeding at the most casual `` raid content '' ever created for an mmo then the solution is to keep practising your basic mechanical skills with the game , not potentially obsessing about optimized rotations . 
   and enjoy it . 
  i really do n't see how anyone could need an extra set of numbers on their screen to enjoy an activity that consists of 10 teammates killing some super-powerful bad dude ... other than a kinky integer fetish , that is . 
  if things magicly materilized out the ether then sure , why not , but new features require development resources that could have been spent elsewhere . 
  may i suggest the mythic race in world of warcraft then ? 
  because that 's not what guild wars 2 has ever been about , in any shape or form . 
   challenging content is the fun for a lot of people . 
  and yet that people seems to be arging for something that , if anything , would make gw2 less challenging . 
  economics . 
  people who do n't even raid to begin with outnumber raiders by an order of magnitude , if not two . 
  * eles confirmed to heal targets with their new pitiful mini-flames . 
  more like never , since they wo n't be able to keep alienating their core audience for much longer . 
  that much is obvious looking at the financial numbers . 
  i do n't believe anything should be removed , that was a shit-tier strawman . 
  there 's another raid almost done and throwing work away is pointless , but once it 's done , keeping them abandoned ( like dungeons ) is effortless .
