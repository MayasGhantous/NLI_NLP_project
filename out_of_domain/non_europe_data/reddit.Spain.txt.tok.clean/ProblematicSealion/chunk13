  i would be genuinely surprised if we had any more raids following the current formula moving forward . 
  compared to wow i 'd say fractals t4 are around the mythics +0 and the raid is on par with normal trial of valor , both with realistic gear ( read , ~ 820 for mythics and ~ 840 for tov ) . 
  but the comparison is a bit sketchy since the skillsets are very different , wow is more about rotational complexity and resource management while gw2 is all about pressing the dodge button at the right time , overall i find gw2 to be a lot easier but your mileage can vary . 
   coming from hc raids in wow you will get roflstomped . 
  i 'd say things like helya hc are ** vastly ** more difficult than any encounter in forsaken thicket . 
  i mean , the raid wings got cleared by pugs in an afternoon while you 're not going finish trial of valor hc with pugs anytime soon unless you join an already grossly overgeared group . 
   a dps meter is definitely among the necessary tools for serious raiding . 
  no , it 's objectively not . 
  you can see it in-game , right now , there 's no damage meter and people are doing the raid perfectly fine . 
   all anet has to do is flip a switch . 
  that 's not software development works . 
  at a very , very least , it would have to go through qa . 
  long overdue , it should have been a design requirement from the beginning . 
  i think it is poor characterization . 
  he 's supposed to be a norn , and yet he thinks and acts as a big human , but that 's the usual * problem * with fantasy / space opera universes , all the races / species are nothing more than humans in diferent colours and shapes . 
   with no empirical evidence, 
  so like most psychology ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
   well , very few games actually had `` easy '' or accessible raids from the beginning . 
  because during the themepark mmo boom it was n't a perfectly resolved design problem , now it is . 
  mainstream content should be scalable , leave any strict requirements ( future challenge mode ? ), 
  for the 1 % . 
  wow has a `` looking for raid '' queue that puts you right into a group with a much easier version of the normal raid . 
  it also gives the entire group a stacking 5 % damage / healing buff with each wipe so that every group will finish it eventually , the whole thing serves as a way to invest heavily in raids knowing that all people will be able to see that content ( they 've stated this several times ) . 
  it is also partitioned in chunks of 3 bosses so that it can be experienced in small play sessions . 
  swtor has a pretty similar thing , in fact , that difficulty is called `` story mode '' there . 
  buzzwords mate . 
  it 's nothing new . 
   what on earth is backup heals in wow ? 
  shamans , wws and rets have very quick casted heals for a reason , and in good guilds they 're are expected to ocasionally save people in clutch situations . 
  specially rets , if a tank dies and i still have loh off-cooldown then i fucked up just as much as healers did . 
  i 've heard the new discipline priest be called `` backup heals '' as well when running with an extra healer , but i do agree that the rest of his post reeks of bullshit . 
  strawman = / = argument . 
  the three bosses in halls of valor have as many mechanics as the entire gw2 raid , regardless of gear . 
  i do n't need to watch any video , people are clearing the raid , period . 
  ergo , it 's objectively not [ needed ] ( http://www.wordreference.com/es/translation.asp?tranword=needed ) . 
  thank you anet . 
  incremental improvements to the training area could be interesting , but please do n't add more in-context data to the game , we can slay the dragons without it . 
  low energy bait, 
  * [ laughs in vanguard ] *, 
   different combat is enough for a reason to stay here . 
  wildstar offers a more hardcore implementation of gw2 's combat . 
  also vastly more hardcore raiding . 
   that 's a much more fair and desirable outcome, 
  in your opinion . 
  yes , there 's absolutely no reason to kick anyone if they bosses are dying . 
   we 're using the tools to get you kicked anyway , unofficial tools . 
  and people will laugh at you once you get banned and nothing of value is lost \u00af \\ \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af, 
   actual video gamers, 
  lol 'd, 
   more combat info is never a bad thing . 
  how much about game design do you actually know ? 
  any relevant experience ? 
  because that 'd a pretty fringe line of design , to say the least . 
   i do n't get why casuals do n't understand that it 's important to have a 100 % accurate statistical average for each and every encounter , and each phase or moment in the encounter . 
  because it absolutely is n't . 
  ** source ** : the thousands of boss completions on live gw2 servers . 
   this game stopped being casual after raid was introduced . 
  ** newsflash ** : forsaken thicket is one of the most if not the most casual raiding experience ever created . 
  and it should stay that way imo . 
   this is how people are . 
  everywhere . 
  not really . 
  sounds like you live in a shithole tbh . 
  yeah , let 's subject game design to some online poll . 
  what could possibly go wrong ? 
  dae democracy ? 
  maybe . 
  depends purely on the context . 
  the eula is perfectly clear . 
   let 's get back to playing the themepark mmo, 
  the concept of raid as we know it today was created by themepark mmos . 
  initially losing up to ~ 1 % of their revenue and gaining a significant amount of press would indeed be devastating . 
  clearly . 
   can they just get an official statement on the unofficial dps meter already ? 
  [ they already did more than 4 years ago , and you 've already agreed to it . 
  ] ( https://www.guildwars2.com/en/legal/guild-wars-2-rules-of-conduct/ ), 
  ctrl + f `` you may not modify any part of the guild wars 2 client '', 
  it could n't possibly be more clear . 
   overlays like taco and gw2 navi seem to be tolerated, 
  it 's not that they 're * tolerated * , they 're simply not anet 's business since they do n't touch their software . 
  for a counterargument to exist there needs to be an argument first . 
   the only reason to hide combat info , that i could think about , is to hide game design flaws ... which is beneficial to the devs , but not to the players . 
  do you realize that most games are fundamentally based on a lack of information ? 
  having more information does not make the game good , or even better , it just makes it a different game . 
  like i said , if it does not touch gw2 's files / memory addresses then it 's simply not anet 's business . 
  no idea how could you possibly kill this boss without a damage meter . 
  ** lick me **, 
  ** lick me **, 
  ** lick me **, 
  ** lick me **, 
  ** lick me show you how it 's done **, 
   fat icons, 
   combined windows, 
   no labels, 
  no thanks , that 's a painfully terrible design . 
  they waste more vertical space ( which is far more valuable on widescreens ) and are harder to hit since the horizontal size is smaller while the vertical remains irrelevant ( you 're already pulling to mouse all the way to the bottom ) . 
  i still do n't understand why windows 7 butchered the default design , the one from win95 to vista is ** objectively ** superior if not using a touchscreen and * apple does it * is one of the most pathetic non-arguments i 've ever heard . 
  i would n't mind them wrapping the dragon theme and moving to something smaller , or at least different . 
  already going full retard less than a week into the expansion i see . 
  not sure if that means that there will be one casual oufit that is exclusive to the deluxe editon or if there are several , one of them being the exclusive one ...
