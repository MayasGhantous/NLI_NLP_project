   all i 'm trying to do is clarify what i think of when i think of gender inequality . 
  it really does n't matter because , again , reality does n't care about your opinion and gender inequality will keep affecting both genders in different ways in different places . 
  we 're not the same and we 'll never be , and that 's perfectly fine . 
  i 'd be more interested in knowing why would anyone be interested in forcing a gender `` equality '' based on giving positive rights to people based on whether or not you have a vagina instead of preserving the negative ones for everyone . 
  i 'd would expect people to strive for more freedom to live their lives however they see fit and let society be organically shaped by it . 
   is having women in the armed forces the same as having a `` woman army '' ? 
  no , but we 're talking about a draft not profesional military careers , when you pull people pretty much randomly women will be overwhelmingly much less suited for the positions that a draft mainly feeds ( read : combat based frontline duty ) , you do n't draft civilians into commanders and engineers . 
  if you get to make proper selections and dictate standards you end up with what is esentially a human army , most will be men because we 're equally or better suited for everything an army needs , there are plenty of women out there that are up to the task too , but that 's not what a draft is . 
  the more precise questions are : should women be drafted knowing that drafting only men will result in a objectively better army ? 
  and are n't the lives of women more important than those of men in such a situation due to how human reproduction works ? 
   are women entirely objectively inferior in every role in the armed forces ? 
  no , but they 're equal ** at best ** . 
  there 's no logical argument for artificially introducing more women into military carreers . 
   is modern warfare even remotely close enough to wwii warfare that a draft including women today and then could be objectively compared ? 
  no , but there 's nothing that would be women ( as a group , not individuals ) would do ** better ** in any circunstance either . 
  drones might be the new hot shit but male pilots are still stastically more capable than women , tens of thousands of years ago the men happened to be the ones hunting and natural selection evolved us into males having significantly better spacial awareness . 
   we should have an equal , objectively effective army . 
  and there are women who will meet and surpass those tests , and men who will fail . 
  it will not end up even distribution , but that 's never how equality works . 
  equal employment , for example , uses the phrase `` equal opportunity '' for a reason - equally employing people just to have fully even numbers is absurd . 
  the idea is that the door is n't slammed based on certain factors . 
  not that there have to be an even number of chairs for each protected class that must be filled behind the door . 
  well , i 'm glad to see we agree . 
  but sadly in most western countries the mainstream left has now become the regressive force pushing for latter instead of the former . 
   edit : also , quit making stealth edits . 
  if you have a new point to make , make a new comment . 
  i keep coming back after commenting and finding that the comment i 'm replying to has been changed to something significantly different . 
  english is my fourth language and i still have some trouble expressing mildly complex ideas in a way that reads * natural * , i 'm genuinely not trying to trick you in any way . 
   wow is designed so that people get all of the items though , this overwatch event is n't . 
  so we criticize that design . 
  it 's super simple stuff , you should be able to understand it just fine . 
  just call it the whale games event next time , so no one gets the wrong idea . 
  for those who ca n't read spanish :, 
   in honor to those fallen during the dark , even the darkest night gives way to the dawn , may they be reborn in the light and never be forgotten . 
  the `` dialect '' used in sombra 's hints reeks of poor translation more than anything else . 
  but assuming it is not , she could be from andalusia or the canary islands , not necessarily mexican . 
   that does n't sound like spanish from spain to me , lo siento . 
  a few million andalusians / canary islanders would like a word with you . 
  it 's always fun to see how foreign devs would try to represent the `` stereotypical spaniard '' that does n't actually exist . 
  [ phoenix from dirty bomb ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9uvgyci_k8 ) is my favourite attempt so far . 
  there 's nothing to pretend , skins objectively matter . 
  if they did n't , they would n't be in the game . 
   the game needs to have longevity , and that requires money . 
  that 's great , and i 'd be very happy to pay them a reasonable amount of money for the whale games content . 
  the thousands of euro poured into my battle.net account ( ~ 1500 $ from wow alone ) can attest to that fact , now if they want me to gamble for a chance at skins they can fuck off , the proper place to do that is a casino . 
  it 's called feedback , as it is right now there are two posible options as far as my relationship with blizzard regarding this particular event goes :, 
  ** option 1 ** : gamble to access the content . 
  - i am unhappy because i ca n't buy whatever thing i wanted . 
  - blizzard does not recieve any money and losses x amount of goodwill as result . 
  ** option 2 ** : selling the content, 
  - i am happy because i can enjoy that content . 
  - blizzard recieves monetary compensation for creating that content and more goodwill as a result of me being more engaged with the game ( since the sunk cost fallacy can be difficult to avoid ) . 
  one of the relationships is ** objectively ** superior in every single way to the other , it does n't take a genius to see it . 
  throwing the 99 % of the customers under the bus to milk the other 1 % as much as posible is an unnecesary business strategy , one that i did not expect a company like blizzard to take and will inevitably affect how i percieve their products in the future . 
   * if i choose to ignore the negative feedback all i end up with is positive feedback . 
  never go full retard , jeff . 
  he seemed like a genuinely reasonable guy , i 'm mildly disappointed . 
  * can you live without legs ? 
  yes ? 
  then having legs does n't matter . 
  nope , not anymore . 
  what kind of logic is that ? 
  if they did n't actually want people to change realms they simply would n't offer realm changes . 
  * inb4 people who has never touched a relational database come tell you how incredibly complex and difficult writting a two line update statement is because they read it somewhere on the internet *, 
  the top tier raiders will have finished the mythic content before the first lfr wing even releases . 
  if you were to be affected by this , you 're nowhere near the the cutting edge to begin with . 
   if you 'd apply this subbreddit to the real world , the garbagemen would rule over the lawyers and academics . 
  i take you do n't live in a representative democracy ? 
   do i get the same tier look as the more difficult versions ? 
  i just want to look badass . 
  lol, 
  insecure people do n't look badass , so you 're out of luck . 
  it takes its sweet 3 ~ 4 seconds to launch and ready on my fresh installed dev machine , [ which is not new ] ( http://i.imgur.com/gpocpto.png ) but still specced above 80 % of the pcs being sold today . 
  that 's orders of magnitude slower than notepad + + or sublime , which are virtually instant even on the crappiest of cheap laptops / ultrabooks . 
  i know you just tried to make * le fanny look at me i play support joek * but he 's absolutely right . 
  you had amp from the beginning and simply chose not to heal him , you where not completely useless ... but close . 
   for it to be worth doing it requires a lot of communication, 
  i would n't classify lucio saying `` i have ult , let 's amp to the point '' over the voice chat as * lots of communication * . 
   intellij takes 30 + seconds to start up on my laptop , and vscode takes less than 5 for a similarly high quality feature set . 
  what the fuck ? 
  intellij idea 's feature set is massive compared to vscode , that 's like comparing the wap browsers from 2005 's nokias to safari/chrome/edge on current smartphones . 
  an electron-based vscode with all the features of visual studio ( which are currently written in c/c + + ) would be hilariously slow in comparison , it completely defeats the point of a text editor ( being fast and efficient at opening and editing ** text ** ) . 
  almost literally . 
  a couple of dozen times during the working day , but how is that some sort of argument in the first place ? 
  text editors opened virtually instantly 30 fucking years ago already , this is massive involution . 
  from what i played in the beta ( lvl 110 , all the dungeons and a tiny bit of the raids ) legion is the best expansion . 
  the lore is finally moving forward , there are interesting characters everywhere , the class order halls are a much better concept than the garrison , it launches with two great raids , the dungeons are the best they 've done so far ( maw of souls is amazing ) , the professions are more fun than they have ever been , there are tons of things to do in the open world , mythic + dungeons finally bring really high difficulty to the 5-man content ... 
  literally the only thing i hate about legion is the new warrior `` class fantasy '' with the vyrkul / valhalla nonsense ( i 'm rerolling to paladin for legion and beyond because of it ) . 
  we should n't need 238472 tutorials to make a fucking os work properly . 
  osx any stable linux distro does it perfectly fine . 
  he 's not , he ca n't be . 
  did they change something about icc ? 
  stormheim , because i 'm a dog person . 
  no , stay away . 
  ashran is a part of the legion pvp system , so the supply wo n't die anytime soon . 
  that 's a pretty stupid design considering that most humans can see colors . 
  microsoft has always been shit-tier as far as design goes . 
  no reason to think it is going to change anytime soon , in fact , it 's getting even worse . 
  it 's a personal twitter account , he should be perfectly entitled to have opinions on things , including racist ones . 
  i ca n't understand this american obsession with mixing professional and personal life , whatever opinion he has on anything not related to game design should be 100 % not bioware 's business , period .
