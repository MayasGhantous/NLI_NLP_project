  this is exactly the kind of video that any reasonable person would expect from a sjw bully . 
  yet . 
  there should be a few short quests still coming before legion , and varian 's grave is still missing at new the new shinny park , so there might be some sort of funeral cinematic coming with that . 
  that 's completely irrelevant since microsoft is not a person . 
  source code or did n't happen . 
  that sweet raid paying off . 
   the health care is an absolute joke . 
  the healthcare is objectively better than the one in the us , regardless of how you might want to feel about it . 
  not to mention vastly cheaper , you 're paying more than 200 % what denmark spends per capita . 
   it 's just impossible for them to be sustained without taking more aggressive socialist economic policies . 
  that 's objectively wrong . 
  single payer systems are [ vastly more efficient ] ( http://www.oecd.org/media/oecdorg/satellitesites/newsroom/44222075health%20expenditure.jpg ) than the completely absurd scheme that you currently have . 
  economically similar countries have been running systems that provide better results than yours for ** literally less than a half ** of what you 're spending for decades . 
  this can help you :, 
   why do you or anyone else deserve my money ? 
  you do n't . 
  except it 's not all your money . 
  you did n't build the roads that transport whatever goods you might have manufactured to make that money , the police that provides physical safety are not your slaves , the army that guarantees the continuation of the state that enforces many laws that allowed you to make that money in the first place are not valueless either , `` private property '' for example is absolutely nothing more than a funny word without a monopolistic authority with the physical means to enforce it ... 
  i know that the idea of being atlas is attractive , but he does n't exist . 
  if we go deeper , the human brain is not some sort of magical machine that * creates * ideas out of the void , every single idea you have and will ever have is shaped by the society that you live in and the ideas from absolutely everyone that came before , they will never be * yours * alone . 
   take care of yourself . 
  writes the * enlightened * man on a website based on html ( a publicly funded european project ) sent over the tcp/ip protocol ( a product of the us military ) sitting on the confort of a home that is his because the state says so . 
   my problems are not your problems . 
  from the very moment you 're born into a society they all are to different degrees , and that much is obvious for anyone without actual autism ( this is not an insult , is a medical condition ) . 
  copays ( and/or coinsurance ) have absolutely nothing to do with whether a system is single payer or not . 
  so it was n't me becoming a significantly better mccree player all of a sudden ? 
  feelsbad, 
   she ca n't fly without her armor . 
  commando 76 activates his visor without his visor just fine ... 
  yep . 
  welp ... there goes a big part of the music talent , literally the only above average thing that heart of thorns had . 
  i 'm starting to feel a bit worried for anet . 
  one more reason to be a dog person . 
  yeah i 'm experiencing this on a fairly beefy pc as well . 
  i assumed it was tsm doing its thing ( i 'm running a pretty complex setup lately ) but it must be something else . 
   most fat people are fat due to psychological reasons . 
  no , they 're not . 
   ven if you assume that skinny and healthy are the same thing, 
  it generally is , you ca n't be obese and healthy just like you can not have cancer and be healthy . 
  you can be healthy and slightly overweight , it 's not like you need to be at 5 % bodyfat for your body to work properly , but the woman in the picture is well into obesity . 
  at least you 're honest , that 's good . 
   no , it 's badass if it 's close to source material . 
  i 'm pretty sure roadhog is not a woman . 
  that alone blows any closeness to the material to outer space . 
  ea and ubisoft let me buy their content , that 's ** infinitely ** better than the f2p shit that blizzard is doing . 
  dlcs come with a price tag and i easily decide if it is worth that cost , they do n't come inside gambling boxes with a theoretical infinite cost , if i wanted to throw away money on absurd gambling i 'd go to a casino , at least there they have the decency of entertaining me with games and fancy drinks while trying to shamelessly suck my money . 
   you people clamored for free maps and heroes . 
  who is `` you people '' ? 
  i did n't clamor anything since i 'm perfectly happy to pay for further development , put a fancy price tag on it and if i feel like whatever thing you made is worth it then i 'll happily pay it , so will many other people . 
  if you ask me to throw away my money supporting unregulated gambling schemes , then fuck you . 
   everyone got exactly what they paid for . 
  no , they did n't , people bought millions of boxes under the agreement that coins would buy any cosmetics . 
   if you want stuff to be rare, 
  i do n't . 
   * playing reinbro with randoms *, 
  not even once . 
  lmao, 
  i play with the skins that i find more visually appealing , period . 
  some of them happen to be the default ones , zenyatta or genji for example . 
  i 've yet to see a significantly overweight professional judoka , you seem to confuse muscle with fat . 
  and the sumo guys are ** really not ** an example of healthy humans . 
  #fun detected, 
   and everyone hated the garrisons , that 's why the class halls wo n't be instances . 
  not everyone hated garrisons , and most of the people that did was n't because of the reason that you 're implying , the vast majority of people had a blast with the garrisons during the first weeks of wod and if afking there was n't pretty much the only non-raid content wod had , people would not have grown weary of them . 
  but do n't take my word for it , the fact that the garrison is coming back with a different name is undeniable evidence that facebook-style games are there to stay whether the loud minority likes it or not . 
  sorry to break your bubble if you did n't play the beta and were hyped for the the class order halls , but they are absolutely nothing more than the garrison without the farm / mine and some other people phased in , they still are central to everything in legion and you 'll have to keep up with it on any character that you wish to use for mythic + / raids / pvp or else you 'll be gimping yourself . 
   and wow still has dungeons and raids and item progression . 
  wow has raids and dungeons because it would have figuratively nothing to offer if it did n't , which is by far the biggest complain about wod , the class order campaigns are an initial attempt into delivering a * decent * story-driven rpg product , but they 're still a massive joke compared to kotfe ( let alone the original swtor storylines ) . 
  and it 's funny that you mention item progression since legion is clearly the first iteration of game design without it , the pvp is already normalized ( the tiny extra scaling via ilvl is unnoticeable ) and the top end pve gear comes from literally everything ( including , gasp ... casual open world quests ) . 
  spot on . 
  i do think it is time for * some * group content though , i 'm not talking about hm revan kind of content for the 0.1 % since it is obvious that they ca n't even compete with wow in that regard , but having something to do other than running the story would break the current monotony and ultimately improve the experience even for the most casual players ( imo ) . 
   swtor is an mmo, 
  or not , that 's for ea / bioware to decide . 
   mmo 's have group content . 
  wow has that kind of group content , and the endless amount of themepark clones it has spawned ( including swtor until kotfe ) also happen to have it , but mmos existed long before `` raids '' and dungeons '' where a thing and will continue to exist with or without them . 
   paled in comparison with expansions released for the guild wars titles and with the world of warcraft ones, 
  ahh yes , heart of thorns , the half-expansion that managed to bring gw2 's revenue to its all-time low . 
  to put it in perspective , right now gw2 is making less than half the money they were making during the entire year without a single piece of content between ls2 and its release . 
  and warlords of draenor , the expansion that made wow lose such a ridiculous amount of suscribers that they do n't even release the numbers anymore . 
  great examples indeed . 
   world quests reward loot up to 835 which is same as lfr . 
  they * warforge * to 880 at release , and will go to 905 once the nighthold is out . 
  if by `` updated gameplay '' you mean `` mediocre gow copypasta '' like me2/3 then no , keep it the way it is . 
  sub for at least one month or move on . 
  it 's like the stack overflow of sysadmins afaik . 
   in mmo 's that have n't gone with the traditional mmo ( wow ) style combat system , sure , i bet they do have ` exciting ' * encounters . 
  i am just saying i have never seen one in a game with a combat system like swtors ( or wows etc ) . 
  are [ mannoroth ] ( https://youtu.be/8h1ixahk2na?t=9m4s ) or [ archimonde ] ( https://youtu.be/9mijqsdainu?t=9m59s ) exiciting enough for you ? 
  because many people still found them exciting after hundreds of tries . 
   knights of the fallen empire falls short content-wise of what heart of thorns offered to guild wars 2 players . 
  kotfe delivered absolutely everything that they said it would deliver , you know what you were paying for . 
  hot is half the expansion that i paid for , even things that were on the fucking game box ended up scrapped ... 
   they ca n't bitch about you drawing it because you 're spanish and even those losers are n't stupid enough to believe you have `` internalized whiteness '', 
  when have spaniards stopped being `` white '' ? 
  i certainly did n't get the memo ... 
  i 'm pretty sure ireland did not leave the eu , in fact , no one has left the eu ( yet ) . 
  yep , the commodity-style model is ** infinitely ** better than the auction house one . 
  that 's the only thing i miss from gw2 . 
  because it is a buggy mess . 
  no amount of smooth scrolling can justify using a browser that does wonky stuff in every single work session .
