  nice . 
  please break as much raid assistance as possible . 
  tl ; dr : wildstar has the best raiding experience and wow should copy it . 
  that 's a good thing . 
  you have 6 duplicates of a legendary summer games skin because summer game skins are supposed to be rare . 
  do n't ask me to explain blizzard 's logic though . 
  i preemptively laugh every time the average game dev thinks their system can position players better than elo . 
  this shit just keep happening , it 's hilarious . 
   individual performance impact can be a good in theory if you manage to make it fair for every single person on both teams . 
  this is literally impossible for any game that is played by humans . 
  there 's no possible way to measure `` personal performance '' . 
  there 's not even a way to reliably define `` personal performance '' in the first place . 
   it 's such a broken system, 
  a system that compelled you to spend +300 $ on content that at most took two months to make as opposed to 40/60 $ for the game itself which took years is not `` broken '' , it is ** massively ** successful . 
   who cares , they do n't affect gameplay . 
  people who like ** video ** games . 
   as a 730 blood dk i do not feel this is the case . 
  i live for a good 30s to 60s, 
   ignore pain is op, 
  it 's mediocre at 110 :(, 
  probably a 3 ~ 5 %, 
  if anything , the percentage would be massively higher here . 
  oh wow , i ca n't believe that telling the kernel to refresh some usb port an stupid amount of times per second would constantly waste energy and leave less cpu time for userspace applications . 
  who would have thought !!!?!!? 
  for better or worse , nobody cares about hots . 
  best drop since 9/11, 
  it should be fine as long as you do n't date lol players . 
  got ta have * some * standards at least . 
  the beard patch , time to reinstall gw2 . 
   then there are times when i wonder what kind of mental disorder is required to accept excel as a tool . 
  the fact that there 's nothing that comes anywhere remotely close to it . 
  start eating , any half decent bot easily outperforms any human by a sizeable margin . 
  i prefer having a lot less but more important buttons , 5 ~ 10 is the sweet spot for me . 
  my favourite online rpg so far was guild wars and the whole combat system was build around having 8 abilities at your disposal , which made your `` build '' an integral part of how you were going to perform . 
  not to mention that different builds even for the same class felt like completely different . 
   in higher level content it makes it easier by letting the player focus 99 % on the raid mechanics, 
  why do you assume that mechanics will stay the same ? 
  that makes no sense , the new combat shapes how the rest of the game is designed . 
  the point of making the combat mechanics less convoluted is to make the game more fun by leaving you more time to do more of the other stuff , you ca n't have truly engaging mechanics if you also want people to follow a 100 keybind rotation . 
   too afraid to google, 
  lol, 
  probably a sysadmin . 
  i 'm pretty sure a ban ca n't stop you from buying another copy of the game . 
  i think that it reflects a mental disorder that is clearly unsolved . 
   it does n't matter what 's her current stance is . 
  these agreements will happen . 
  when did americans give up democracy ? 
  sad stuff . 
  their ass . 
  that 's one steaming pile of bullshit . 
  * journalism : the . gif *, 
  pm me if you 're on eu . 
  you 're using the word `` entitled '' again , grandpa . 
  stop it . 
   idk i watched the trailers it looks like they copied mass effect 's storyline . 
  and the mass effect universe is a copypasta of [ revelation space ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/revelation_space ) with flashier aliens . 
  what 's your point ? 
   because wow is horrible these days, 
  legion is by far the best experience wow has offered me yet , and i 've only missed mists . 
  til changing some character 's haircut turns it from '' * le strong independent womyn !, 
  ! 11 * '' to '' * jerk-off material * '' . 
   trust me , my utmost priority is that the game remains artistically consistent . 
  that ship sailed long before release . 
  * i am repaired !, 
   nah , or you worked a trade through high school and landed a good job . 
  trade education here requires 6 years of secondary education , and then it takes another 2 years ... so assuming you do n't waste any time you start your career at 20 ( instead of 22 with a 4 year degree ) . 
  at 19yo you 're either studying or flipping burgers , none of which can finance a `` nice apartment '' . 
  rip butt . 
  is there any way to disable it completely for those who are using other software to capture gameplay then ? 
  will toggling it off and then uninstalling the appx work ? 
  for now . 
  welcome to tumblr . 
  check / r/tumblrinaction for more info . 
  nsfw ? 
  pm me if you 're around 60-65 solo . 
  sounds like we wo n't be able to play together in season 2 then ( the allowed sr range is tiny now ) . 
  but feel free to add me anyway , for some quickplays maybe ? 
  feel free to leave then . 
  hopefully non-existant . 
  i finished my 100 stack of each glyph restocking just an hour ago . 
  people have been dumping draenor herbs for down to 30s these last days , i might restock a bit more later today . 
  because homo / transexuality wo n't be normalized as long as it exists . 
   just compare our starting sword and board to the paladin equivalent, 
  i vastly prefer the warrior one . 
  yes we do , it 's hanging from your belt . 
  it just does n't show the offhand slot ( like the prot sword ) . 
  you can transmog it into a small sword . 
  i prefer the order hall version in with the yellow / red scheme and slightly less ridiculous shoulderpads . 
   there 's a clear lack of dedication , design and time spent on creating the model . 
  overdesign \u2260 dedication, 
  something having `` particles '' does n't make it better in any way , and specially not when we 're supposed to be talking about the * low fantasy * ( not really low fantasy , but the lowest anyway ) class in the warcraft universe . 
  ** tl ; dr ** : he 's upset that they put a lot of effort into legion stuff that is now useless . 
  and let 's not forget the obvious bias , dbm makes money , so take any dev 's words with a pinch of salt . 
   its isnt a chump with 3 users . 
  when the api owner can completely end your software with with a few method changes you 're indeed a chump . 
  my plant was to have fun with the new content , and i 'm having a blast . 
  he 's getting paid 1500 $ / month from patreon alone so dbm is absolutely nothing more than a job , please stop insulting our intelligence by pretending that he 's blessing us with addons out of the goodness of his heart when even my 8 year old nephew can see the painfully obvious bias in that text .
