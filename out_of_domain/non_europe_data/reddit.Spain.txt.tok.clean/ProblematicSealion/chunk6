  you ate the bait ... 
   y' all are complaining about . 
  not `` you all '' , people who know how to play paladin are doing the 200k + in most bosses just fine and having a blast while doing so ( bursting with 105 % haste during crusade is the highest apm requirement in the game right now ) . 
  but then again , the ones that spend all day complaining on the forums do n't have enough free time left to get their haste to ~ 25 % and educate themselves on how to use their talents or develop ashbringer . 
  til `` top tier classes '' do ~ 400k dps with their quest thrash rotation . 
   only the paladin seems to have a really small kit , in particular for aoe healing . 
  i 'm thinking about the naga packs in eye of azshara and the lantern dudes in maw of souls , for example . 
  do you have any experience with one there ? 
  what ? 
  on 5 man paladin has one of the best group burst healing . 
  beacon of virtue is a thing , and holy paladins need to know how to use it . 
   ( paladin , cough . ), 
  beacon of virtue is a thing that exists and allows you to top 4 people pretty much instantly if properly used . 
  you should meet . 
   what are you doing for spike burst on tanks ? 
  i 'm finding that to be my biggest weakness right now . 
  bad tanks are not a healer weakness , they all have tools to deal with spike damage by themselves . 
  right now there are just tons of dps mains with very little tanking experience trying to get fast groups . 
  a symbolic link works both ways , this is a terrible idea . 
  there 's a reason why windows and osx come with incremental backup tools , use them . 
  yes . 
  another uwp game with monstrous requirements for the subpar visuals . 
  why am i not surprised ? 
  since around 3 years ago ... 
  it was one of those things that origin did from the beginning but took steam almost a decade to implement . 
   if a woman has the right to her womb space then i have the right to my organ space . 
  in this case `` i '' does n't exist , it 's just a sack of meat wasting space on a bed . 
   the sack of meat still has n't consented . 
  neither does a fleshlight , but there 's no need for it since they both equally non-sentient objects . 
  if fucking corpses did n't come with an endless amount of health concerns , you probably could , there 's a good chance that you would still be considered a weirdo but there would be no reason for it to be illegal . 
  my recommendation would be to go back to wow because legion is amazing and you 're missing the best expansion launch in mmo history . 
  there 's not much ( if anything ) going on in gw2 so you wo n't miss anything by coming later down the road , one of the good things about gw2 is that the game is so casual that you can be up to speed in a couple of months even years after release . 
   * hosting on a windows machine *, 
  this is what you get . 
  you 're forgetting the fact that herbalists and miners get extra bos gathers at rank 3 . 
  making those offset the lost income from comparatively less valuable mats is just a matter of tweaking the numbers . 
  or have 5 , or have 8 , or have 13 or have 3 . 
  it 's ongoing development , changing that number takes seconds . 
  rannik # 21196 alliance-eu ( heal / dps ), 
  846 mythic raider turned filthy casual for legion will lend a hand in any dungeon ( including court of stars and the arcway ) in any difficulty , just let me know what you need . 
   they all want 12-24 year olds buying their products . 
  the 12-24-year-olds are playing hearthstone on their phones / tablets and could n't care less about mtg . 
  blizzard won . 
  i do n't go to the cinema . 
   what if the single player microtransactions allowed the single player dlc to be free ? 
  what makes you think that some people want dlc to be '' '' '' `` free '' '' '' '' ? 
  paying a fee for unrestricted access to the content is by far the simplest and fairest monetization scheme , it has been proven to work perfectly for hundreds of years in all kinds of markets . 
  no man 's sky . 
   everyone else basically auto attacks everyone to death . 
  actually , holy paladin has a rotation and pretty decent dps . 
   unless you 're a disc priest you do not, 
  but why ? 
  healers are indeed expected to do dps during low damage phases , on mythic anyway . 
  this , ret 's damage is perfectly fine . 
  the fact that you absolutely need a helper wa to perform an anywhere near efficient rotation is not , no human can reliably track the ** variable ** cooldown of 3 ( or 4 ) spamable abilities and overlap them properly while not losing charges , ending up with open gcd or being * forced * to dump hp without judgement while also keeping an eye on raid mechanics and people 's health to make the most of our utility . 
  i 'm willing to bet plenty of money that the reason why many people think that retribution is underpowered right now is the fact that there are tons of paladins out there trying to eyeball the rotation and failing spectacularly without even be able to realize . 
  because the timer is more of a `` you did n't wipe 20 times '' thing than a cm speed-run style challenge . 
  everyone with a clue . 
  mythic + is about killing trash efficiently , bosses are mostly a joke . 
  i generally prefer to play games than watching other people play them . 
   because in every rpg i 've seen , my character looks and acts the same at level 1 and level 50 . 
  and when they do n't , people complain , case in point : ** mass effect **, 
  \\ - `` why is my shepard is bad at shooting a sniper rifle ??!!? 111 !, 
  why does it not play like gears of wor ? 
  so clunky !, 
  \\ - how many points do you have on the sniper rifles ? 
  that particular path reflects how much training / experience shepard has with that type of weapon , mass effect is an rpg and you 're supposed to create a character with strengths and weaknesses . '', 
  \\ - `` none , but but but but shepard should have pinpoint accuracy and perfect pulse regardless ! 11 !! 1 !!, 
  ! 1 muh shooter muchanics !!! 11 !! '', 
  \\* * * mass effect 2 becomes a generic shooter with fancier cutscenes * \\* *, 
   yeah , they might not be the most practical, 
  actually , they 're far more practical than the shit you see in halo / me3 . 
  how can this not be bait ? 
  you called ? 
  insecure male teenagers think they need to dress a particular way to have sexual intercourse with females . 
   dress however you like but do n't be surprised if someone calls you a neckbeard after seeing your fedora , anime shirt and cargo shorts . 
  is that supposed to be a bad thing in any way ? 
  when i see guys with those shorts i think `` practical . 
  '' , which is exactly what i would want from anyone , be a coworker or a partner . 
  in the exact same way that i think `` form over function , avoid . '', 
  when i see those pointless skintight jeans that some * trendy * guys seem to wear at this particular point ( until the fad inevitably goes away ) . 
  but none of this really matters , irrational hate wo n't change the fact that `` cargo shorts '' are ** objectively ** superior to pretty much every other other kind of short legwear . 
   i carry 3 things keys , wallet , and phone . 
  those three things are better off hanging off on a side pocket than pressed against your leg in a regular one . 
  purses are also mostly pointless because backpacks are a thing that exists . 
  * if your blood still freely circulates up and down your legs , you 're doing it wrong . 
  not to mention fees for basic online services . 
  i 'm considering buying a ps4 pro mostly for ffxv ( pc version is not confirmed ) and the actual price over ~ 5 years is 650 $ plus 10 $ extra on each game , simply keeping my pc updated is cheaper no matter how i look at it . 
  this is why i buy music instead of renting it . 
   yeah , it 's rare, 
  oh god , my sides ... 
  good riddance . 
   why are there so many people like this in tech ? 
  because it 's full of socially awkard people that ca n't deal with them . 
  i do n't really like the whole `` beta males '' meme , but there 's definitely * some * truth to it . 
   `` my culture is cursing '' : linux kernel world is a hostile place -- by design . 
  good shit . 
   inclusive language, 
  what is the english language excluding exactly ? 
   jesus h. christ what world do these people live in .
