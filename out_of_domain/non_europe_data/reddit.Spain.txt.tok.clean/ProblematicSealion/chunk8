  i 've tried quite a few of them and the only one that was bearable ( not even good ) was firewatch . 
  the stanley parable was pretty neat exprience as well , but not really a game . 
   spear ranged warrior, 
  [ paragons from guild wars please . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7vy8zsn680 ), 
  yep , i finish the daily heroic with overall ~ 100k dps as holy . 
  ca n't get the huge rez if you keep them alive . 
  [ it 's feels time . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/fpe717qqjcm?t=55s ), 
  yep , i find details to be a pointless project . 
  nobody needs precise analytics in-game , most people need a simple meter with some breakdowns while anyone that wants to get more in-depth will be better off with the vastly superior log tools out there , not some overbloated skada . 
  afaik many of those auras rely on events exposed by boss mods , not blizzard 's ui . 
  what we really need is the webview that they use for support to be available on the api . 
  blizzord pls . 
  ** fact ** : there 's not a single mechanic in emerald nightmare that is not 100 % comunicated by the default ui . 
  we 've banned dbm because of il ` gynoth . 
   dbm will improve your play, 
  flashing my screen and yelling stupid stuff about some mechanic that i 'm already 100 % aware of at the third try will never improve my play in any way , quite the opposite in fact . 
   it is basically required to get a feeling for your optimal rotation as a dps class, 
  no it 's not . 
  logs are a vastly superior tool for analyzing any fight and they do n't require any in-game addons , the combat log txt output is part of the vanilla client . 
  when home computers had 512mb of ram sure , addons taking ~ 80mb could have an impact in some scenarios . 
  but i 'm pretty sure you ca n't even launch wow un such a machine anymore . 
   i blame blizzard for making that the only easily accessible metric , but still you really should n't care . 
  yep , the only relevant metric is cpu time / frame . 
  making visual mechanics that ca n't be picked up by addons seems to be the new trend , and i seriously hope they do n't stop , it 's the one thing that gw2 raiding does vastly better than wow . 
  i want to look at the spectacle that blizzard creates for every fight , not a bunch of bars and numbers . 
  even with those underwelming improvements the default ui is absolutely atrocious by 2016 standards . 
  and it 's not only the design , the art ** really ** needs higher resolution assets , it looks horrendously low res when scaled to a confortable size @ 4k ( looks pretty bad at 1080p already ) . 
  the same way you ca n't apparently `` steal '' bits of information by creating copies of them ? 
   the timers are the only worthwhile part of dbm . 
  i see literally no reason to use that bloated mess over bigwigs if you 're only using the bars . 
   hmm . . can you explain how to know if nightmare brambles is targeting someone then ? 
  by looking at them . 
  the patch of glowing evil brambles that moves around is a perfectly distinctive model , unless people are too clustered it is obvious who are they chasing and when do they change target . 
  and that 's exactly how every mechanic should work , fighting big meanie monsters    fighting a bunch of bars . 
  yeah , that 's exactly how the mechanic is supposed to and does work . 
  the exact same way heterosexual streamers do ? 
   long-term fans and professional gamers , you 'll be busy . 
  yeah , playing legion . 
  if it was hard , you 'd need 10 good people , not 3 . 
   not really . 
  yes , really . 
  the gw2 raid is more or less equal to the current `` normal '' difficulty in wow , which is widely regarded as the `` easy mode '' with hc being the real thing ( what `` normal '' used to be ) and mythic being the hardcore experience . 
  except in other game you 'd need 20 people performing well to even have a shot at it . 
  forsaken thicket is laughable for any players who are at least mildly interested in the game mechanics and that much is obvious for anyone that plays / has played any other mmo with `` raids '' where you have to progress through the content instead of just beating it in your first sitting with a mediocre group . 
  there 's a reason why mythic raids in wow or nightmare ops in swtor are not pugeable . 
   raids do not block your story progression . 
  that 's not the case in wow either , quite the opposite in fact . 
  gw2 ** does ** have lore and story bits locked behind those encounters , in wow you have the raid finder which allows literally everyone to experience the storylines in them . 
   so someone else does something that you ca n't do and suddenly it 's easy ? 
  no , it 's easy because it 's easy , however good me or these players may or may not be is 100 % irrelevant . 
   uhhhh yeah so what makes it easy ? 
  the lack of difficulty . 
  is there an argument somewhere in there ? 
   not having a tab target system and `` mechanics '' that do huge damage like wow makes it easy ? 
  yes , having a much less demanding dps optimization and vastly more forgiving mechanics does indeed make it a lot easier , anything but the most trivial mistakes on a mythic raid usually cause wipes , pretty much every single mistake in gw2 is solved by pressing f. 
  til there are brazilian speaking countries in europe . 
  literally every site with ads in it . 
   * implying that the web mess is any better than java *, 
  it 's really bizarre how some people think businesses have feelings or make decisions based on anything but profits . 
   * wo n't anyone think of the children ? 
  that 's not saying much considering that both are shitty shadows of what they once were . 
  til the most basic concept of how market-driven economies work is now considered `` tin foil hat '' stuff . 
  should n't be too surprising considering that people irrationally voting against their own interests is one of the recurring and biggest problems with our current understanding of `` democracy '' , it happens pretty much everywhere . 
  it makes sense that similar behaviours would show in a market space as well . 
   if a waiter does a good job , is friendly , helpful and goes the extra mile ; he deserves a good tip and a recommendation . 
  if you live in a country where waiters do n't get fucking paid for their job and people is ok with that then sure . 
  but people at blizzard do have an actual wage . 
   your waiter deserves a good tip if he gets the food to your table and was friendly and easy to work with, 
  that 's your opinion . 
  getting your food to the table is their job . 
  i 'd be far happier with a subscription and access to all the content without lootbox / unlockables shenanigans . 
   is that true ? 
  obviously . 
  the cost of bandwitdh has gone down massively from last decade and computing hardware is far more capable today than it was in 2005 , server racks are not an exception . 
  if cmangos is any indication you could run a full 2005 wow server during peak time on your today 's smartphone . 
  seems like a perfectly fair pricetag to me . 
   i could see that you log into porn sites and i could attempt to blackmail you, 
  this person whatches porn !!!!! 111 !, 
   right but what if we found out a president candidate watched some weird fetish porn ? 
  virtually nobody would give a fuck ? 
  i do n't know where you live , but i really ca n't see a single reason why anyone would care about what kind of porn some politician enjoys , that 's 200 % irrelevant to any politics . 
   they dont grt paychecks , douche . 
  that sounds an awful lot like slavery . 
  i do n't see why anyone in supposedly developed countries would support that kind of exploitation . 
   they go to the healer . 
  [ laughs in paladin ], 
  870 + bring flasks , food and pots . 
   clinton , trump ** and others ** . 
  lol, 
  time to break the circlejerk with some reality . 
   way better look and style, 
  personal opinion , the artstyles are very different , but wow 's engine is objectively far more capable :, 
  - 90 % of the playable area is open world ( no zone borders or loading screens ) . 
  - every single zone is seamlessly phaseable to individual players / parties / raids . 
  - dx11 on windows and metal on osx . 
  - more granular settings . 
  - an specific set of settings for high playercount content ( raids / battlegrounds ) that activates automatically . 
  - 4 ambient oclussion techniques to choose from .
