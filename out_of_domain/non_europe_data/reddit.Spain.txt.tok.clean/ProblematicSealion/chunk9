  - 4 antialising techniques ( fxaa , cmaa , msaa and ssaa ) combinable as you see fit . 
  - much longer the draw distances . 
  - macro support . 
  - a fully moddable ui using off-the-shelve languages ( xml for ui , lua for scripting ) . 
  - support for several accessibility software / hardware solutions ( including 4 kinds of color blindness ) . 
  - and most importantly , it performs vastly better than gw2 ( no trouble reaching 95th percentile 144fps ) . 
  anet used to have a very big advantage in the scaling system , but the legion 's scaling makes gw2 's system look like an amateur project . 
  for those who do n't play wow it works by scaling the world instead of the player , and it does this individually for each player , which means that you can have a lvl 10 player and a lvl 100 player fighting the same enemy . 
  that enemy will look like a lvl 10 for the low level player and like a lvl100 for the high level one and all combat interactions are not scaled but seamlessly converted into percentages to keep the world always in sync . 
  it might sound a bit complicated but it works flawlessly and is completely transparent for the players , unlike gw2 , where you go to queensdale and suddenly your superawesome spell is doing 1k damage instead of 10k because the game downscaled you to be a lvl10 peasant again . 
   epic world events that happen constantly, 
  legion 's world quests are a natural improvement on gw2 's events . 
   the dye system so you can look how you want without a hassle . 
  dyes are better in gw2 , but the sets + wardrobe system is better in wow . 
   - no monthly subscription . 
  and then you have most of the new stuff hidden behind * micro * transactions . 
  which business model is better comes down to pure opinion , i 'd love a no-nonsense subscription-based gw2 . 
   the environments are immersive and beautiful, 
  suramar city would want a word with you , we 've yet to see anything of that scale in gw2 . 
   deposit your crafting materials whenever you want, 
  that system is needed in gw2 because the game keeps throwing stupid amounts of completely worthless loot at you so we need tools to manage it somehow , that problem does not exist in wow to begin with . 
  except if your way is skipping over the mindnumbing stuff and focus on content that can offer a sizeable challenge . 
  which to this day it still does not exist in gw2 btw . 
  sounds like some ways are indeed * more correct * than others then . 
  thanks for further explaining my point , 
  dunno , i 'm just homosexual . 
  mercy main btw, 
  where did this stupid 30 % haste meme come from ? 
  the eu has 24 ** official ** languages , that should give you an idea . 
  lol, 
  have you even been to france , spain , italy or poland ? 
  heroes never disappoint !, 
  yeah , legion is amazing so far . 
  and there 's a big patch content coming next week , less than two months after expansion release . 
   * defending companies *, 
  people keep doing stupid things . 
  you 're not the only one , i used to be a `` semi-hardcore '' swtor player too but i love the direction the game is going , i do n't think the content is particularly good but i 'm happy with the format . 
  everything that swtor has ever tried in the `` wow clone '' mmo space has been mediocre at best , i rather see them focus on what they do best ( worldbuilding and personal stories with an illusion of choice ) and just log into wow to raid every weekend , this trooper that i 've been attached to for years will still be there for when there 's new story to be played . 
  for those still hoping for new operations / demanding group content i 'd genuinely advise them to just move on , legion is amazing and swtor still is a great experience if you take long breaks between the big patches . 
   * is jus game *, 
  if it released 4 years ago i might have thought about it . 
  how is the op any less fun without the gear ? 
  sounds like you did n't like raiding to begin with . 
   i ai n't never seen anything like this before in an mmo . 
  have you played any other mmo though ? 
  because this is nothing special . 
  wow has plenty of pieces of animated armor , they started adding them on bc more than a decade ago ... 
  looks like i wo n't have to spend a lot of money on it after all . 
  what ? 
  la will be full of copycat legendary armor characters in a few months , just like with the weapons . 
  [ battlegear of guiding light ] ( http://www.wowhead.com/transmog-set=1891/battlegear-of-guiding-light-recolor#modelviewer:1+0 ) for example . 
  your transphobia is showing , my dear . 
  i 'd be ok with 1080p on the dock and 720p on portable mode , give framerate , not a few more pixels . 
  i do n't need a 2650x1440 screen on a portable device , no matter how much phone makers want me to believe so . 
   there 's no difference between a regular subscriber 's benefits , and those for someone using a token , because blizzard does n't give a fuck where the money came from . 
  actually , blizzard benefits a lot more from tokens buyers than normal subscribers . 
  the subscription varies between 14 ~ 11 $ / month while the tokens are 20 $ . 
  --------- the rine ends here . 
  i wish i had doc as trooper , he and aric are the broest companions . 
  of course he picked up a very expensive professional microphone and made a really nicely ~ ~ acted ~ ~ * spoken * speech instead of using the more honest , neutral and suitable way to comunicate something on the web , which is text . 
  you 're gon na need ** a lot ** more subtlety to play on my heartstrings m8 . 
   it 's a severely underappreciated craft and vas rarely get royalties despite being central to projects that yield hundreds of millions . 
  neither do the sound engineers . 
  or the game designers . 
  or the managers . 
  or the engine programmers . 
  or the animators . 
  or the concept artists . 
  or the 3d modellers . 
  or the riggers . 
  or the animators . 
  or the writers . 
  or the qa team . 
  or the web backend programmers / frontend designers . 
  or the sysadmin . 
  or the ones creating the marketing . 
  all of those are vastly more important than giving a fancy voice to some character , and yet they do n't demand for the profits to be cut and distributed in 238343 little pieces , they just get paid a wage for their work . 
   even considering some of the best va work i know of , hale doing femshep in mass effect or blum as spike in cowboy bebop , it just does n't have nearly as big an effect on a final product, 
  they make the final product worse if you ask me . 
  i 'm so tired of hearing the same 5 voices in every videogame . 
   they also do n't have a union . 
  i 'm perfectly sure that i was part of a union before i moved into bi ( it 's the same one in fact ) . 
  in bwa 's case seems to be a general us thing , it has nothing to do with developing games specifically . 
  that 's not any of their business . 
  their work is to read some line in whatever way they 're asked to , that 's it . 
  no one should get royalties at all since it 's a profoundly stupid way to organize things to begin with . 
  demand . 
  higher . 
  wages . 
   zoe quinn, 
  how about no . 
  you do n't see why poinlessly getting control away from player is always a bad thing ? 
   because the existence of this thread is a testament to the fact that 90 % of the user base of this video game define the word crybaby ? 
  or maybe they just like good game design . 
   i do n't think that that has anything to do with game design . 
  you think wrong then . 
  control being taken away from the player is something that should be generally minimized , that 's game design 101 . 
  in games cutscenes are used because technical limitations make seamless exposition incredibly difficult to make right in some cases , not for the luls or to avoid fixing important bugs , it 's obvious that not every game can be as good as half life 2 in that regard , but this particular cutscene was completely pointless . 
   medium.com, 
   also , os x has a better audio engine from end to end , which means lower latency .
