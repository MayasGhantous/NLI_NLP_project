seems like the usage of m4a4 and m4a1-s has been balanced , which means that volvo did a great job this time . 
  is it yours ? 
  thailand i would say . 
  kapital is the club you are looking for , its a must if you come to madrid . 
  it has 7 floors , each with a different kind of music , so you will find what you want . 
  if you want something `` posh '' , where the rich people ( or just wannabes ) go , moma , serrano 41 , or gabana 1800 . 
  ( i like the last one the most ), 
  if you want something more like skater-ish ( i dont know if that word even exists ) , you should go to malasa\u00f1a . 
  its a zone full of people with caps and tattos , drinking beers on the street at night on weekends , with graffittis everywhere , and that kind of stuff . 
  i cant help you about the after-party cause i usually dont last that much :d the same about hostels . 
  and about the last one , no one here has problems with english-speaking people , nor with anyone at all . 
  madrid is one of the most open-minded cities in europe , you will find it out when you come here , and its full of students doing their erasmus here , so they wont even know that you are a tourist . 
  anyway , you dont have to worry at all , maybe be aware to dont get robbed , specially in summer , because the main streets are extremely crowded . 
  if you have more doubts just ask me . 
  maximum 600 #, 
  locations , i dont really mind . 
  i would prefer something quiet and surrounded by nature rather than in the city centre . 
  as long as the zone is well communicated i dont mind if i have to spend 20 more mins in a bus everyday . 
  i dont care about nightlife and all that , so something quiet would be perfect . 
  edinroom is the best choice , there are tons of ads every day . 
  they are expensive as f *** tho , because of the demand, 
  as i said , i would prefer something far from the city but surrounded by nature , that in the city centre . 
  and yeah , the price is an incentive too . 
  the thing is i have no idea about how the public transport work there ( i have never been in edinburgh before ) and i have no idea about those places like the one u mentioned . 
  i would prefer something out of the city , but well connected , i dont want to spend more than 1 hour by bus/train every day . 
  edit : i just googled the town that you said , and looks fine ( 30-40 mins by bus according to google maps ) so if you know more towns thus far i would love to know them :d, 
  and thank you !, 
  yeah , i saw the zone and the flats within 3 miles of penicuik , and it looks like the place i would like to live . 
  i do n't really care about nightlife , all i need is a bus stop , a supermarket , and nature :d, 
  i ca n't find many flats tho , i guess it 's normal considering the population . 
  the offer is small , but i guess the demand is similarly low , so i will look for flats in that zone frequently until i find a good one . 
  thank you again !, 
  do n't forget the super cool flamingo curtain :d, 
  a pen . 
  i will be moving there for 4 months or so , i dont know if you count that as moving or visiting, 
  anyway i knew i was going to struggle with the accent at the beginning , but now i am afraid of looking like a fool because i am not able to understand even the basic sentences . 
  i better catch the accent fast once im there . 
  i know that there are a lot of people from abroad , like students and tourists ( specially in summer ) that do n't speak with scottish accent , but still . . 
  would you guys choose eu over uk if the brexit finally happens ? 
  i hope so , 
  all the north , since its all the same . 
  they are all so similar , but if you want something `` unkown '' , the best place for me is cantabria , specially li\u00e9bana , where you can find super small villages with 30-40 ppl living there . 
  [ picture ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_oiafhqkvhuo/s8sp2in00zi/aaaaaaaaab0/vpk9ffgs91i/s1600/cantabria.+oto%c3%b1o+2008+243.jpg ), 
  if you leave the main town , potes , you wo n't find many tourists . 
  those villages are pretty unkown . 
  and if you want to go to the beach , you can do it in 1:30 h by car . 
  the beaches in the north arent that much crowded as in the south and are `` mixed '' with mountains and cliffs . 
  [ video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihkapwlyli4 ), 
  if i were you , i would stick to asturias , cantabria , and basque country . 
  from cantabria , which is in the middle , you can get the other two in 1 hour by car and a bit more by bus/train . 
  so its perfect if you want to see many things and you dont have a car . 
  you have [ picos de europa ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u1gmcgqu1q ) pretty close too . 
  if you go to asturias , you have to visit [ lastres ] ( http://www.lastresvela.com/img2010/galerialta/bahialastres2.jpg ) . 
  its amazingly beautiful . 
  and in basque country , [ san sebasti\u00e1n ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_c4ijsvkvaa ) , lot of people say its the best city in spain , and i also think so . 
  as i said , they are all so similar , you wo n't see many differences between one and another , so make your research and feel free to choose . 
  if you have some doubts ask me , specially about cantabria since it is where i live . 
  we do not say mande in spain, 
  actually it sounds kinda funny, 
  could you elaborate that ? 
  since spain has nothing in common with mexico except for the language . 
  when i was a kid , i thought that the goblet of fire was the first book ( do n't ask me why ) , and i read a few pages until i realized , enough to know that someone called sirius black was harry 's godfather . 
  5th birthday ? 
  did you read it when you were 5yo ? 
  you would probably miss and kill yourself . 
  just for those who do n't know :, 
  if you speak a romance language ( french , spanish , romanian , portuguese or italian ) , you can know what every spell does just by its name , because almost all the spells come from latin . 
  so those spells who sound familiar for you english-speakers is because those words were taken from latin probably . 
  for example :, 
  ** obliviate ** : from oblitus , it means `` to forget '' . 
  `` olvidar '' in spanish , similar right ? 
  ** incendio ** : means `` fire '' . 
  literally `` incendio '' in spanish . 
  ** protego ** : from protect . 
  `` proteger '' in spanish, 
  ** aguamenti ** : from `` agua '' , or water in english . 
  ** lumos ** : from esperanto , meaning `` light '' . 
  ** reparo ** : from `` reparar '' in spanish , quite similar in english aswell . 
  ** levicorpus ** : from `` levitar '' in spanish , or `` levitate '' in english , and corpus , meaning body in latin . 
  and last but not least , ** avada kedabra ** comes from [ abracadabra ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/abracadabra ) , a word used usually here in europe by magicians years ago , but we still use it when we make a magic trick ( i do n't know if in the us or in other countries you use it too ), 
  i did n't know . 
  here we use usually abracadabra . 
  so when i first read it in hp , for me it sounded retarded :d, 
  tried everything and nothing seems to work, 
  i have the pistons v2 and the sound is way better than my new hybrids , so i am starting to think that they are really fake . 
  the thing is that i bought them on amazon , so it 's weird . 
  if you come here to study your whole degree , you would be finishing it for 2020 or so , right ? 
  our unemployment rate for 2020 , according to the experts , should be around 13-14 % , meaning that with a ( useful ) degree and living in a big city , you should n't have problems to find a job, 
  if the unemployment rate is 13-14 % , in madrid or barcelona would be easily 7 - 8 % since it is always way lower than in the rest of spain . 
  the netbooks and laptops here always come with the spanish keyboard , so keep that in mind . 
  apart from that , i usually buy tech on amazon , but you can always go to el corte ingles or fnac . 
  the prices i guess will be the same . 
  hispanic is not a race , and being hispanic does n't exclude you from being white or black, 
  no , it 's not . 
  i am from spain ( so i guess i am hispanic ) , and i am white , so i ca n't be 2 different races, 
  actually the us census classifies `` hispanic '' as an ethnicity and not a race, 
  if hispanic and white are different races , how can i be both of them ? 
  it makes no sense, 
  as i said , the us census classifies hispanic as an ethnicity and not a race, 
  as you can see , hispanic and race are different sections,
