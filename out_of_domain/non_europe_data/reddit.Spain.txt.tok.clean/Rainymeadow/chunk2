   the irish rover . 
  i second this, 
  it is 50 meters from bernabeu , so you will be able to see and feel the atmosphere before and after the match with the fans , you will be able to see the bus with the players , etc. 
  i also recomend you taking the metro in nuevos ministerios instead of bernabeu , since the first one is always extremely overcrowded . 
  if you are from the usa you should compare the homicide rates of ur country first, 
  nothing personal against the russians , but it is on your president 's interests to see the eu destroyed . 
  that 's why all the european alt-right parties ' funds come from russia and the usa, 
   they were teammates last year , which explains why they are such good mates, 
  if something the f1 taught me , is that the teammates are usually the worst enemies . 
  i asked because that 's basically what [ this guy ] ( https://www.reddit.com/user/carlespuigdemont ) is doing . 
  he only posts about the independence and against spain . 
  ( seriously , it is hard to find comments not related to it ), 
  he posts only links of pro-independence media . 
  he uses every chance he has to turn a conversation towards the independence [ example 1 ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/678ogu/spanish_parties_save_podemos_back_macron_in_the/dgp67ox/ ) [ example 2 ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/67ks0k/is_it_just_me_or_does_madrids_metro_map_look_like/dgrjx52/ ) [ example3 ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5rw24y/4th_day_of_protests_in_romania_250000_protesters/ddbies2/ ) [ example 4 ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5m52yn/bavaria_not_allowed_independence_referendum/dc0xbos/ ), 
  and he even has as nickname the name of a pro-independence politician . 
  ** i am not saying that you should ban him ** , cause anyway i have him blocked so i could n't care less , but i was just curious if this was agenda pushing or not . 
  i really think that many pro-independence users are getting paid somehow to make this kind of stuff ( cause it is not normal that a user posts only about the same subject ) , and that 's what triggers me , i do n't want the people of / r/europe get tricked by politicians and their dirty tactics . 
  russia did n't break the eu , they made us stronger . 
  take a glance at the new franco-german relationship that we have now , we have never been this united in the whole history . 
  [ the 27 states are taking decisions in just a few minutes ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/apr/29/eu-leaders-set-to-take-tough-stance-in-special-brexit-summit ) `` a senior eu source said the leaders ' decision took only one minute of discussion . '', 
  the only one company that does n't rob the players , gets robbed . 
  life is not fair . 
  xenophobia is the word you are looking for . 
  because the richest players in the world are here , and are usually those the ones who evade taxes . 
  holy shit that looks awesome . 
  anyone mind telling me what cvs is ? 
  i googled it and all i found is a kind of pharmacy , which does n't help me much to understand the post . 
  now it makes sense , thanks , 
  is this for real ? 
  i mean , did you seriously spend 10 years working in 2 jobs to pay your student loans ? 
  is this a normal practice ? 
  i am not american so i have no idea about how things work there . 
  yep , you are right , i just saw another post 2 months old . 
  i had n't watched it untill today that the rm official facebook page posted it , so i thought the footage was just released although the match was time ago . 
  my apologies then , the mods can delete it if needed . 
  yes , we ( normal people ) pay around 40 % of our salary in taxes :(, 
  i mean , ronaldo started evading taxes since his time in manchester . 
  blame england also then . 
  we wo n't let them steal from us just like you guys did with cristiano when he was in manchester , 
  did n't expect you to be the kind of troll who runs when he is replied , my apologies then . 
  please notice that sweden and finland conform the penis of europe . 
  also if you hover your mouse over the flags , they will change into the rainbow one ( the russian one also lol ), 
  feel free to come and thank our mods , 
   also he is a stupid racist . 
  what did i miss ? 
  not really . 
  he hates basque and catalan ** independentists ** , which is quite different . 
  iniesta is not even catalan and busquets does n't support the independence . 
  yep , that 's true . 
  but that 's far from being a `` racist '' . 
  also , catalan and basque independentists are n't another race . 
  just a nationalist hating other nationalists . 
  i agree . 
  i also consider as a `` piece of shit '' those who disrespect and attack the anthem of a whole country . 
  nationalism is usually bad in any side . 
  and how a hispanic looks like ? 
  because according to the us government i 'm hispanic , but i am fully european and my skin is whiter than i would like, 
  i agree that he does n't look like the typical latino ( at least not at all , it looks more like a mix ), 
  i ca n't say that he does n't look `` hispanic '' becuase that term is so ambiguous . 
  [ this person is labeled as `` hispanic '' by the us government ] ( http://blog.pucp.edu.pe/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/135/2012/01/cons.jpg ) and [ this one also ] ( http://v.uecdn.es/p/110/sp/11000/thumbnail/entry_id/0_fypjtdaj/version/100001/height/480 ) . 
  that 's my point, 
  i am from spain , yes . 
   how many jobs go to other eu residents instead of british ? 
  the uk has an unemployment of about 4-5 %, 
  if the eu residents do n't take those jobs , who will ? 
  your view is a bit simplistic , it seems like you think that british people can not find a job with a 4 % of unemployment . 
  untill now , the uk has been trading with the eu like always . 
  literally nothing has changed yet , and the pound has already dropped 10 % . 
  imagine when they leave a market with a gdp of $ 14 trillion, 
  you are totally delusional . 
  the eu is just too big to care about the uk 's economy leaving . 
  just today we made a trade deal with canada and we are on our way of making another one with japan . 
  there you go , we already replaced the uk with countries with twice the uk 's gdp . 
  and they did n't even leave yet . 
  it was n't hard was it ? 
  good luck for the uk to find a 14 trillion economy to replace us , tho, 
  definition of latino, 
  : a native or inhabitant of latin america, 
  : a person of latin american origin living in the u.s. 
  and you are from denmark ? 
  i am disappointed :(, 
  catalan police is also spanish police , unless you want to use the terrorist attack to push your agenda, 
  `` spanish '' police is not an operative , it 's the nationality of the police . 
  inside of the spanish police you have different groups such as mossos , ertzaintza , national police , etc, 
  spanish police is not a group , is the nationality of the policemen and it involves all the police groups operating in spain, 
  spain has 2 main police groups operating at a national level , the national police and the guardia civil . 
  then there is another group called local police for each town/city . 
  and also all the autonomous communities can have their own regional police , right now only the basque country , catalonia , navarre and the canary islands have their own forces . 
  all these groups operate in the spanish territory , and therefore are part of the spanish police . 
  what part i do n't understand ? 
  catalonia is in spain in case you did n't notice yet , therefore the catalan police can be named as spanish police , or european police , or whatever you want to call it . 
  til football ( soccer as you call it ) is not popular , lmao, 
  thanks !, 
  i will check it out , but i dont think i will get my money back since i dont have the cpr number yet :( well , at least its something !, 
  yeah , they say so on the webpage, 
  they ask for nemkonto , which i believe is related to the cpr number, 
  aparently i will get another ticket within the next 6 months , so it 's fine, 
  i have to live in edinburgh for a while , and i would like to know if i should avoid some zones , mostly thinking about renting a flat . 
  if you could tell me the best and worst zones to live i would really appreciate it . 
  thank you !,
