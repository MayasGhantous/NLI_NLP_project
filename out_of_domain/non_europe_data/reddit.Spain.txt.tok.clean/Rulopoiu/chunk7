  never quite got the thing with the vanguard change . 
  anyone mind explaning ? 
  i can not wait to see some beautiful , developed plantside locations like this one . 
  the wastelands of the current planet tech are already breathtaking , but just thinking about the possibility of getting lost in the woods and then suddenly coming across with an output like this ... maaaaan , that 's the dream . 
  i do n't know why , but every since they announced the planetary tech i have always fantasised with a lake with a waterfall coming from the mountains . 
  to this day i believe that 's literally everything i expect from this tech . 
  give me that and i 'll be the happiest citizen in the verse . 
  hope you find some peace there . 
  despite everything that 's happened recently , the thoughts of all europeans are with you and the families of the victims . 
  stay safe everyone and stay together , we are better than them . 
  just raising a small concern about pink guns ... 
  i. . . do n't ^ quite ^ like ^ them ^ at ^ all, 
  well to me just seeing them around would be break immersion but i am getting downvoted so i guess nobody really agrees, 
  that 's thing , just seeing anyone else using them is what breaks the deal and the immersion , at least to me . 
  but , anyway , i see it 's a rather unpopular opinion . 
  `` all ... the time ? '', 
  get me some warfare footage of a pink weapon then . 
  edit : or maybe you dropped the ' / s ', 
  dude you keep using the expression `` get over it '' . 
  we are just contrasting different opinions , which have an impact on the final game . 
  chill the fuck out and maybe leave the community if you wo n't accept opinions different than yours . 
  the whole comment tree shows that different players will have different opinions and views on the game , and thus the options that satisfies the majority are the ones that should be picked . 
  if sc backers and cig are fine with said weapons , i 'll be fine as well cause i understand that 's what people want . 
  if you are too immature to see this , then fucking leave and close the door while you do so . 
  i see you know how discussing things work . 
  nice to have people like you in the community . 
  actually , you are absolutely right i should have simply said `` fuck it . 
  i dont like'em '' while not giving one single reason nor trying to argue my point as i did . 
  you smart guy . 
  wait i forgot this right ? 
  nice to have you in the community :d, 
  man this team alone would do great in first division by themselves . 
  what the hell, 
  i dont what to be mean , i swear . 
  but it looks like a straight rip-off from kurzegesagt . 
  like , i would n't mind , but he literally copied his art , as in just copy pasting some drawings . 
  that 's not cool . 
  wysiwyg is of those feature which i am gon na fucking love if they get implemented in the way you say, 
  i must agree with u/fredfredbug4 . 
  while i am 100 % sure that cig will deliver a complete game , it is hard to tell whether all the promises will be kept . 
  the truth is that , although the game is looking promising already , the initial promises and stretch goals were - to the least - set without a deep study of both their economical and technical possibilities so as to complete them . 
  in real world finance one single buck wo n't be spent without hundreds of pages if not thousands assessing and evaluating the risk of the investment and their probabilities to come off . 
  iirc , and i think i do , one stretch goal was simply , vr compatability . 
  like wtf , you had `` pets '' , `` modular ships '' as future goals , and all of a sudden vr , because why the fuck not . 
  one of the greatest landmarks in gaming history which has not been properly implemented in any aaa game yet , was promised in one of sc streach goal as long as their budget was increased in less than a 1 % of the one they currently have . 
  you see , that 's unrealistic and unprofessional and it could be argued as one valid source of criticism towards cig . 
  going back to the financial risk analogy , ** there were no guarantees nor guarantors which could ensure that one of the reasons for which some people had invested money on sc would ever be completed . 
  ** and those are some important words there . 
  hopefully sc seems to be doing great right now and although this goal , and maybe others , might never become a reality ; the truth is that the final product is starting to look very similar to what cr firstly announced , so those minor slips can be tolerated with no further consequences . 
  i am totally convinced that sc will be a great game but that does not quit the fact that its funding campaign was performed , at certain moments , in a somehow irresponsible way . 
  edit : words , * grammer * and mobile keyboards . 
  yeah i think you absolutely got my point , thanks for expanding on it . 
  regarding point 3 , we simply ca n't tell . 
  the truth is that , this observations which we are mentioning here attack the idiosyncracy of crow-funding campaings altogether . 
  in a nutshell , ** how could a company which did not even exist perform said risk analysis ? 
  how could they even assess the state of the art of the industry over a 8 year period , specially regarding leading edge technologies such vr ? 
  ** short answer , they ca n't , and maybe no other company in the world either . 
  so what were cr possibilities back then , so as to comply with the crow funding * code of ethics * and maybe with any possible legal future consequences ? 
  play it safe ? 
  well , if you ask me , in the * world of clickbait * which we have created it 's pretty much go big or go home . 
  had cr not being so grandiloquent with his words and aimed for the highest ever ( literally * ever * as never before in more than 70 years of video gaming history ) , sc might had never become a reality . 
  that 's sad but it is they way things work . 
  clickbait and all the cultural background which it implies ( i honestly think this is something huge , could write hundreds of pages about it ) have ended up builinding a society where one single man ( with no company nor prior analysis of what he was saying !, 
  literally zero credentials ! ), 
  ** had to promise that he would deliver the greatest product ever seen in a multi-million 70 year old industry ** for his ideas to get funded , ** with literally no guarantees , at all !, 
  ** it 's amazing when you put it with this words , huh ? 
  to me , the only way out of this ethical dilemma is to assume that money to crow funding companies ** can not be seeing as an investment ** , but rather as a ** donation ** ; yet , many people seem to fail understand this . 
  literally you are putting your money on ideas with no guarantees no external credit investments , it 's you and the creator and if he fails , that 's money you have lost and nothing can be done about it . 
  that 's why we can not be so picky about every single detail ever promised . 
  every backer ** should have gone through this thought process ** and should knew where he was putting his money into .
