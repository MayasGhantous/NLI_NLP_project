you ca n't use refresher on your ultillusion . 
  but you can use it on your main hero and create another ultillusion , what equals to 3 uses of items ( except wards and smokes cause they do n't copy , as well as refresher ) . 
  ofc , you can also use morphling to create another arc warden . 
  it 's nothing to do with luck . 
  pure skill . 
  we 're literally losing ^ literally ^ nothing . 
  it took only 6 years to finally make ta refractions visible kappa, 
  timber aether lens - new cancer . 
  cut cut cutcutcutcutcutcutcutcutcutcutcutcutcutcut !, 
  very cool of you !, 
   also no one expects legion to be useful at 9 minutes . 
  especially a jungle legion kappa, 
  that 's ass , luna, 
  sweet as icicles . 
  one of my favourite bots !, 
  good shit go\u0c66\u0501 shit thats \u2714 some good shit right th ere right \u2714 there \u2714 \u2714 if i do \u01bda\u04af so my sel\uff46 i say so thats what im talking about right there right there ( chorus : \u02b3\u1da6\u1d4d\u02b0\u1d57 \u1d57\u02b0\u1d49\u02b3\u1d49 ) mmmmm\u13b7\u041c \u041do0\u041e\u0b20\uff2foo\uff2fo\u041e\u0b20\u0b20oooo\u1d52\u1d52\u1d52\u1d52\u1d52\u1d52\u1d52\u1d52\u1d52 good shit, 
  only time i buy it is sometimes in safelane against dark seer . 
  can really help kill that shell creep quicker . 
  however , even then it 's highly situational due to probably better way existing to deal with seer and those ion shells . 
  it 's still in the beta . 
  i see what you did there, 
  sun tzu says, 
  ftfy, 
  shall we bring the pitchforks already ? 
  there are ... there are so many layers to this, 
  t1s got direct invites though . 
  wp guys , really nice game and you ( at least to a some degree ) kept your cool when needed . 
  hope you make it even further !, 
  as a support player , i absolutely agree with both of you . 
  the problem is that in lower brackets ( around 3k ) most carries are n't worth supporting . 
  i often give them absolutely everything ( depends on a game - stacks , ganks , easy lane , rotation , saves , teamfight utility ) and they still fail . 
  however , if i do my part , my understanding of a game grows with every match played , whatever happens - that 's why i just fuckin ' love playing supports . 
  hope we 'll be able to wave goodbye to this bug pretty soon . 
  man . 
  how do you toggle aura ? 
  hoho haha, 
  lane is better than jungle, 
  pretty ordinary knight . 
  what sum of money are we talking about ? 
  i 'm ready -- e, 
  g tanking and practically winning 1v5 fight play of the day man, 
  and now he 322s it with a dieback . 
  feeling very happy right now , 
  bad game by akke still , he should 've done much more . 
  s4 needed his presence - as a jungle cm , you can not just allow enemy chen to gank your mid twice so easily . 
  s4 got picked off in base when trying to defend t3 and went down for 70 seconds without buyback . 
  with od dashing out over 9000 damage per hit , that was the game basically . 
  finally vega understood they could just go there and hit the structures to win, 
  team spirit . 
  vp coolly saving lategame strats for the major . 
  so easy . 
  \\  game is hard, 
  fng was way too selfless . 
  shadow blade or agh 's could 've won the game for them actually there . 
  and bullying football fans . 
  depends on what is your native language . 
  most probably yes . 
  run while you can, 
  cm is a legit jungler , but she is much better as a # 5 support imo . 
   you have history of robbing people, 
  necrophos feeder, 
  shocking -- you 'll never believe what this jungling lc did !, 
  0/10 support tping to the lane from base, 
  -- e i 'm ready i 'm ready -- e oh wait * grumble *, 
  fixed a bug where anti-mage and terrorblade were able to see the map, 
  step 2 : purge their whole team of guardian angel / repel / whatever, 
  step 3 : ??? 
  step 4 : profit, 
  [ relevant ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkjc8ifzzmm ), 
  [ this ] ( http://imgur.com/pmn6kof ) just appeared . 
  for me , easily the third best item-for-the-value in the game , right after wards and tp scroll . 
  singsing just saved loda 's life in some match probably . 
  it was . 
  his bkb could 've protected him from lion easily . 
  you can bkb incoming ethereal before that , though . 
  of course . 
  his whole positioning in that fight was problematic , bkb was just an icing to the bitter cake . 
  and wards , smokes , courier and regen are going to buy themselves . 
  i 've got the same problem with witch doctor agh 's in 30 minutes , i do n't want to rush it because there are many more items my team needs before that . 
   there does n't seem to be anything here, 
  global silence . 
  i think they do that because the length of a ball is one foot . 
  so it 's a foot-ball , and sport is called after that . 
  i might be wrong , though . 
  op , do viper support guide next . 
  guidelines ? 
  buy orb of venom , level q and proceed to destroy every lane . 
  competitive arc warden , 7 feb 2016 - 7 feb 2016, 
  just make it that rapier does n't duplicate . 
  cleaner , better . 
   expect an actual game played only as an expansion of noobfromua highlight, 
  ftfy, 
  i find this image very funny , and i do n't know exactly why . 
  edit : here 's your floatboat . 
  yeah , so much fun, 
  free wards + slow from traps are doing work , man . 
  minus armor as well !, 
  and you can deny two creeps at once !,
