  my friend 's dad is a pretty respected mathematician ( eu member state ) . 
  few years ago ( 6-7 ) he attended a conference in iran that had to do something about cryptography - that 's his field . 
  he held few lectures there , he does that in many different countries and basically makes his living out of it . 
  what happened two years afterwards ? 
  he was denied an entry visa to the usa . 
  reason ? 
  cryptography is officially considered ` weapon ' in the usa . 
  the international traffic in arms regulation restricts the export of cryptography there . 
  so , from their standpoint , he was basically holding lectures about weapon in iran . 
  i 've never had so much laugh about bureaucracy as then . 
  we 'll see , it 's something to begin with at the very least . 
  it should be easier to fight his influence as puppet-master than as the official man in charge . 
  hi david !, 
  if you could choose any top footballer in the world to be an ` ambassador ' of your cartoons ( advocating them in public and such ) , who would that be and why ? 
  would you rather be seen in public naked or wearing ' i love fifa ' jersey ? 
  what d'you think will happen first - valencia winning the cl or england beating portugal on penalties in the wc ? 
  i can simply see pochettino crossing the names on the team table-sheet as this video progresses . 
  thank you for your answer !, 
  and your cartoons of course !, 
  admittedly , i had to google crawley town ... [ this ] ( http://www.crawleyobserver.co.uk/news/local/new-restaurant-to-open-in-crawley-town-centre-1-7493435 ) came as a top result , and i 'm saddened to think chances to win the cl for my club are roughly the same as theirs . 
   iceice is nicenice, 
  thank you so much that this was n't a shitpost . 
  great read and i agree with you - until we got some more official info , verodicia it is . 
  i feel left out . 
  i never got one in my three years of active dota . 
  nothing to see there , just a life of pl fan, 
  thank you based cut-inside-man, 
  do n't worry , reddit will kindly remind you of that in every possible opportunity . 
  in what regard ? 
  it 's the same everywhere m8, 
  well , he does n't, 
  hey sir it 's me your brother, 
  did she relocate as well ? 
  she 'll be back soon , do n't worry . 
  to hijack it with precise math , bo1 round robin number of games is, 
  ( n/2 ) * ( n-1 ), 
  where n is number of teams . 
  as we have bo2 series and 2 groups , number of games in a group stage will be 4 times that :, 
  that 's excluding possible tie-breakers , 
  something something backstab, 
  you did , against na \u00b4 vi in upper bracket finals in sl . 
  never knew they were welsh, 
  look who 's talking . 
  es por [ eso ] ( http://www.suvremena.hr/img/articleimages/58691.jpg ) :d, 
  flat is justice, 
  it was ** all ** a scheme to begin with . 
  yeah , valve will let us chose from the heroes which one will be voted most popular , but the contest for arcana was never between the * heroes * - it was between the ideas . 
  valve wanted io to win , he would 've won anyways , they just planted few random profiles on reddit to `` spread the religion '' so it looks that community actually had something to do with this - what arcana will be actually ** released ** . 
  they employed the man who made some io arcana ideas even * before * the quarterfinals . 
  they 're going to announce the pit lord , or *** the underlord *** . 
  it will be so easy to connect those two events on the main stage . 
  valve played us . 
  the cake is a lie . 
  i already did . 
  if you read carefully , you 'll see it . 
  there are dozens of us !, 
  that 's exactly when your bloodthorn comes online, 
  absolutely true . 
  but then again techies have very dedicated group of players that would almost certainly buy available sets unlike some other heroes . 
  keltic is in the word ` celtic ' as something derived from the kelts ( also music group ` celtic woman ' ) . 
  football club is seltic or even sellic . 
  i 'll jump in before meme warden returns, 
  [ ] ( / creepymaiden ), 
  why are you typing something that 's not in caps, 
  the old times < 3 i actually learned how orb effects worked with that shit, 
  it was first introduced somewhere back in 2013 , patch 6.77, 
  ca n't spell `` suka '' without the uk, 
  that also deals damage to the one target even through bkb !, 
  worthy of vac ban imo, 
  ok i 'll rephrase it so the message gets through :d, 
  in my opinion , doing that and ( eventually , maybe ) getting vac banned is worthy and 10/10 would get vac banned again, 
  no space, 
  i 'd rather not .

  thank god getafe finally got relegated, 
  also og, 
  can confirm , even i could carry with 6.86 spec, 
  every hero is a rapier hero, 
  ikr , casted repel once and am still waiting for it to happen, 
  i think it 's still very strong , but i like the concept . 
  just let me know if i understood correctly - if you cast let 's say level 4 bitter spirits on a target that 's missing 240hp , it will heal them for the first 4 seconds and then damage them for the next 10 seconds for 600 pure damage ( ` resetting the duration ' ) ? 
  that seems really strong for a nuke on an enemy . 
  what d'you think about spell ` checking ' the hp of a target every once in a while and setting the behaviour accordingly ? 
  she does n't have any , thank you . 
  poof out of here , all of you, 
  just use us-east , thank you very much jajajaja, 
  i have you tagged as banana , can you explain yourself ? 
  you could 've heard from his tone that he was nervous , but still i think he did a great job . 
  on point with analysis and very understandable , ca n't wait to see more !, 
  literally - thanks purge !, 
  seems good !, 
  well it took full 3 hours so i 'd call it a progress, 
  upvoted for visibility , a picture would probably help as well man !, 
  good luck !, 
  na crowd brokeback, 
  osfrog nothing wrong here osfrog, 
  same with repel here, 
  this comment was so american i probably gained around 100 pounds just by reading it .
