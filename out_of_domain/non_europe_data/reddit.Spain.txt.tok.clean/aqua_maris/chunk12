  the only ones who lose are actually leagues in between 5th and 12th place ( france , ukraine , belgium , turkey , netherlands and such ) , and i 'm afraid there are too few to raise troubles . 
  incoming hsv lawsuit ... there can be only one ** true ** hamburger, 
  pione sisto of celta and akram afif of sporting . 
  it 's the market pool share decrease - that money will be redistributed to the starting fees , hence they 're basically increasing the money you get when you get knocked out of the qualifiers . 
  market pool share is getting decreased and that money will be redistributed mostly into the starting fees and similar . 
  meaning you get more money for just being in the qualifiers . 
   i wonder if it levels out for teams like celtic who go through 3 qualifiers . 
  depends where you end at . 
  i honestly do n't think celtic will be good enough to play group stages if this reform lives ( i wish you good luck with it of course though ) , but money should level out with higher starting fees and ( it is still a rumour ) easier el qualification ( also more money in el ) if you drop out of the cl . 
   if teams such as barcelona will earn more money due to winning 5/6 of there group stage games, 
  yes !, 
  right now it is $ 1,5 m per win in a group stage , it will probably be around $ 2m or more . 
  also , more money based on performance means that if you , say , lose in the qf , you wo n't get $ 35m out of the cl , but around $ 55m ( the numbers are wide estimate ) . 
  however , your market pool share wo n't be $ 20m but $ 10m - but this only matters if you got majority from the market pool . 
  juventus wo n't be happy but teams from ` market irrelevant countries ' and teams that feature lots of clubs in the ending stages of the competitions ( spain ) will . 
  croatia and israel are the only countries whose neighbours do n't have a club in the european competitions group stage ( ? ), 
  if we understand the israeli specific situation , croatia really stands out . 
  well ireland also of course , but still . 
  you are correct , sweden should be included . 
  but sweden do n't have a club as well , israel and croatia do . 
   sign a striker ffs, 
   now with the new rules if a player celebrates with the crowd it 's a yellow . 
  that 's not new ; leaving the pitch without referee 's consent has been sanctioned with a yellow card for at least 15-20 years . 
  however , referees often ` shut their eyes ' and allow players to celebrate goal outside of the pitch bounds which is good ( it 's even written in the directions and interpretations ) - the ultimate goal of football is to score after all . 
  regarding your question , referee could potentially give player two yellows and thus red for this situation ; still , a * smart * referee wo n't do that . 
  his points stand about the european football . 
  non-league part is mostly influenced by salford though . 
  can confirm , fuck them, 
  blame it on mexico . 
  did they unbend his car though ? 
  they should 've unbent his car . 
  that explains the song - it 's not actually a fan chant , it 's a warning notice . 
  group 's communication :, 
  never , not in a single moment did we accept any compromise or half-solutions , and that will continue in the future as well . 
  nor it should be let 's be honest, 
  hellfire hellbitch, 
  what 's a spell ? 
  we were taught that 's a fail throw as the ball must be ` delivered over the head ' , not in front . 
  no kirintili , stanciu or jonathan dos santos . 
  ... interesting . 
  i would give him 7 . 
  typical klopp 's team , they 're all going to die out before february . 
  arsenal will be 4th to do that for sure, 
  what kind of username is this ? 
  why is hospital er ? 
  thanks fam . 
  i can totally imagine bielsa coming to take the reins and then resigning in the half-time of the first match . 
  good riddance . 
  well tiago is injured so i do n't think the first option is available . 
  that being said , handicap atleti . 
  i 'm aware , do n't worry . 
  of course , ** bayer ** leverkusen somehow escape the hate . 
  the whole match is just wonderful to watch . 
  work starts later and everything , also remember spain is positioned mostly further to the west than e.g. 
  england but is using cet so 22:00 here is more like 21:00 . 
  that 's a shame . 
  good luck granada nonetheless . 
  can we please give griezmann balon d'or ? 
  but seriously . 
  how much did you get paid to write this ? 
  but ... but ... klopp said ... b team would suffice ... 
  will grigg would be truly on fire, 
  do n't mention anything connected with `` leak '' as long as that keeper is in my games, 
  these are the things that can piss me off the most . 
  of course , if it was the male judge to make a mistake , nobody would say he should stick to the logging work or repairing cars . 
  players in interview would do that ? 
  or on twitter ? 
  let 's be real . 
  i actually am the football referee . 
  the whole point is there 's no ` male specific insult ' - that 's the problem of so-called ` equality ' . 
  but we could stray off topic here by continuing discussion in that direction . 
  female referees get both part of the insults , both ` cheating cunt ' and ` get to the kitchen ' , believe me . 
  depends how much you can pay, 
  more like adam johnson . 
  for me ( as a referee ) it 's not troublesome whether he gives decision in united favour . 
  it 's not about the impartiality , it 's about recognising that every referee , despite their best efforts to be completely impartial and professional , may make an error . 
  and if he really messes it up , and gets something blatantly wrong in one team 's favour , then inevitably questions would be asked about why that decision went wrong - no matter how innocent it might have been . 
  sign her up !, 
  it would basically destroy the rest of the teams ( those not invited in ) and consequently kill the professional football in the area . 
  true . 
  but most likely those teams would have to play for it against teams already inside the ` regional league ' and they 'll probably stand no chance . 
  champions league format works because you play it alongside the national league where you can struggle , be beaten and drop out of the qualification places . 
  imagine if you ( psv ) played only in the cl , got money , sponsors and experience from it , brought in better players to compete there ( obviously ) and then had to play ( at the season 's end ) against ajax or feyenoord ( who are without everything aforementioned ) for qualification . 
  would they stand a chance ? 
  for example , see balkan 's basketball league ( aba ) and how it killed basketball in small areas . 
  this is the league - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016%e2%80%9317_aba_league, 
  it 's a long story with probably better people to explain than me ... but just compare the results and popularity of basketball in smaller areas of these countries before and now . 
  before you had your own league where your club competed with sides playing in the euroleague and similar , now your own club is on brink of extinction with clubs playing in the regional league taking all the players and you 're forced to play with other weak clubs . 
  maybe . 
  but i daresay football is n't dying yet !, 
  brilliant player . 
  hope you 're not getting him . 
  rip guys , nice run though . 
  now that 's what i wanted to see !, 
  well , if we lose at least it will be against fellow la liga side !, 
  they actually smuggled it in parts and assembled it in the stands, 
  that would imply that crema went terribly , terribly wrong, 
  * male offspring, 
  muted and reported, 
  [ say what ?
