  i absolutely love dani , do n't worry :d, 
  pretty accurate, 
  our al capone , who art in tax haven ,, 
  un-gallowed be thy game, 
  axe was also bone3 +2 +2 , but yeah , he was axe in this case . 
  what art these devilish marks ? 
  real question is ... do they care ? 
  puppey , is that you ? 
  you got sing and sheever , you did your part for the dota world . 
  it 's jan in poland , do you even slavology ? 
  i love how dutch sounds and looks like english spoken by german from the room divided by moderately thick wall, 
  i know about the ` shut up ivan ' weatherman , do n't worry , 
  ` ivan ' and ` jan ' are the same name , some slavic countries use/prefer the first one ( russia , ukraine , bulgaria , croatia etc ) , some use the second one ( mostly poland and czech republic as well as slovakia ) . 
  so it 's ivan novoseltsev , ivan ordets , ivan ivanov ( yeah ... ivan , son of ivan ) and ivan rakitic ; but jan tomaszewski and jan koller , 
  hate those 6k scrubs really, 
  because you must n't restart play if it 's already stopped and player is down . 
   deport him, 
  ftfy, 
  watch your swords or she 'll be, 
  well caldwell was fired so there 's that , close enough, 
  he actually ended his career after this iirc, 
  nippy, 
   this turned out to be his last league match for hajduk , as he was injured in a pre-season friendly against blackburn rovers , missing the larger part of the 2009 -- 10 season and unable to get into the first team afterwards . 
  he was released on a free transfer to \u0160ibenik in august 2010 . 
  this video is from that blackburn friendly . 
  yes , this feint effectively ended his career  . <, 
  these are croatians protesting against the fa . 
  orjuna dublin confirms that 100 % , it 's a long story to explain , but these guys are croatians guaranteed . 
   in 2k people ~ ~ have basic knowledge about items and ~ ~ will flame you, 
  ftfy, 
  nah , he 's only 1 % of them, 
  you ca n't score an own goal from any set-piece + that 's not really new , 
  goal kick is actually retaken if the keeper knocks it in his own net as the ball did n't leave the box . 
   law 14 -- the penalty kick, 
  offence by goalkeeper and kicker, 
   \u2022 if both the goalkeeper and kicker offend :, 
   o if a goal is scored , the kicker is cautioned ( yc ) and play is restarted with an, 
  indirect free kick to the defending team from the penalty mark . 
   o if a goal is not scored , both players are cautioned and the kick is re-taken . 
  so , punishing whoever got the advantage . 
  interesting solution !, 
  unfortunately , that 's wrong . 
  you ca n't score an own goal from a set-piece for at least a decade ( that 's when i first had my football laws exam for a badge ) , and furthermore there is an article from 2002 ( [ http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/2262629.stm] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/2262629.stm ) ) addressing one such goal given ( referee mistake ) . 
  corner-kick is a regular set-piece and was n't excluded from that rule in any sort . 
  trust me !, 
  we had this on exam recently - you must retake the goal-kick as the ball ` left the field ' without actually leaving the box . 
  you can caution the goalkeeper for time wasting probably however . 
  it was only said in the rule 17 as a clarification of the existing rule ( that already covered corner-kicks as well ) , as mentioned below on the page 157 ( '' ** clarifies ** correct restart if a player scores an ` own goal ' directly from a corner kick '' ) because people thought unlikely something like that to actually happen , 
  that ca n't possibly work . 
  i like the idea of agh 's change on cm however , maybe it can become an item you can possibly want to buy in the lategame ? 
  it definitely should be retaken , 
  there is one , it 's something about some ship , must be premiership, 
  it actually says trigger warning . 
  well played bot , well played . 
  what about the dark lord meowron, 
  things like this ( and many more ) are why frog consults pro players for patches advice instead of * we did it reddit *, 
   europe, 
  quit playing , study more , watch pro dota to escape depression , go back to playing when you finish school . 
  all according to keikaku . 
  very nice analysis !, 
  how are your wildwings doing these days ? 
  from somebody casually watching your stream from time to time , you 've improved , man , good luck in your games , 
  people will pay boosters to play their calibration games . 
  more boosting + chaos ensues all over the bracket . 
  prime ranked is probably the best solution . 
  we 'll see what valve does but , no matter how much shit we throw upon them , i ca n't really imagine that they did n't already consider all of these scenarios , especially when you look that the same company makes cs : go . 
  and rest assured that , the moment it gets people to stop playing ( and therefore spending money on ) games , valve will do something about it . 
  they are a corporation after all , 
  i heard you actively upvote some specific posts, 
  of course it 's arsenal flair, 
  yeah but he had a smaller room !, 
  imagine the scenes if na ` vi gets back from the dumpster again . 
  this guy knows his hexameters, 
  ( chorus : \u02b3\u1da6\u1d4d\u02b0\u1d57 \u1d57\u02b0\u1d49\u02b3\u1d49 ), 
  watched euro 2004 with the greeks , can confirm, 
  na healthcare brokeback, 
  you think it is n't but nsa would disagree, 
  make it three . 
  reddit curse is real . 
  this is amazing . 
  thank you , production !, 
  if only we could ask somebody to ask him ... 
  half-life 3 confirmed by fly pogchamp, 
  cans in the air, 
  ancients now feed couriers and report you, 
  you ca n't steal mischief . 
  have a feeling mischief is n't even coded as your regular * spell * , as you get it on level 1 and ca n't level it . 
  also , rubick `` ignores '' casting mischief - for instance , if monkey king casts tree dance and then mischief , rubick will normally steal tree dance when targeting . 
  only if mk did n't cast anything but mischief yet will you get the message ` can not steal this spell ' . 
  you get subabilities when you steal the main ability , similar to ember 's remnant + activate remnant , earth spirit 's spells etc etc. 
  `` lj '' is one letter in croatian language . 
  it 's a soft `` l '' , something like `` ll '' in spanish or `` gl '' combination in italian , not exactly the same but it can give you some idea . 
  rooted to see mitch playing in his home city on this lan , but hey , this way we get to see og boys . 
  not bad . 
  congratulations to both teams !, 
  fml, 
  it 's ok paco , you can come back . 
  we 'll do our best to forgive you . 
  you are correct although your comment is humorous .
