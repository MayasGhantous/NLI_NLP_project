  you must n't do that . 
  good luck . 
  he probably gets to beat you with eibar in the el knowing all the football unwritten laws , scoring a brace and assisting for third in a process . 
  he and casemiro won this . 
  [ relevant xkcd ] ( https://www.xkcd.com/606/ ), 
  i agree with you , but i still do n't think leicester have more than 10 % chance to progress . 
  sevilla played really poorly today , sampaoli was n't on the touchline , and schmeichel saved basically everything ( including penalty ! ) . 
  it could easily be 0-3 in england . 
  it would be another leicester miracle . 
   based on past teams who lost the first leg 2-1 away, 
  man , if you watched the match , you know what i 'm talking about . 
  sevilla played a bad match for their standards , yet they missed a penalty , hit woodwork twice , and schmeichel saved three great strikes . 
  i do n't think leicester can ` not concede ' at home , it would be a damn miracle for me . 
  of course 2-1 is much better for them than 3-0 or 2-0 , but that away goal will be annulated . 
  oh , but i want them to progress < 3, 
  they do n't have to win , they have to win without conceding or win by 2 ( or more ) goal margin . 
  odds give them 25 % at the moment which is fair enough , i guess . 
  agreed , and agreed . 
  so voldemort should 've used photons instead of horcruxes ? 
  you mean he keeps getting heart diseases . 
  they have n't figured out the putting-back part yet , but hey , it 's a start !,

  still better love story than twilight though, 
  manu only have 1 fifa world cup . 
  or , if you count 1999 intercontinental cup , you still miss uefa cup winners cup from 1991 . 
  he did n't exactly land in prison . 
  nor he will i 'm afraid . 
  it 's not even the fans , it 's easy to ban the fans from away trips . 
  but seriously thinking that the embodiment of 4-5 most corrupt leagues in europe will magically rid them of corruption ... delusional . 
  it would be like the ex-yugoslavia league , where the winners would cycle around and be decided administratively . 
  i ca n't believe somebody seriously thinks it would solve anything . 
  exactly . 
  you probably know what 's happening in serbia , how their league is purely managerial interest contest to sell players . 
  now imagine that combining with zdravko mamic and his cliqu\u00e9 . 
  regional league ? 
  more like regional shitshow . 
  i do n't know man , we used to owe some money to the city as well . 
  it seems to follow me around - every club from the city i used to live in goes to trash . 
  maybe i should move to seville ... but then , knowing everything , poor betis would suffer :(, 
  inb4 levante win la liga, 
  i 'm okay with that . 
  obliterate !, 
  as is tradition . 
  total blackout . 
  bale is probably the last man i 'd expect to lose his nerves . 
  good play by referee though . 
  agreed - but that 's the big club home ground factor . 
  still a very solid refereeing in global by borbalan . 
  i do n't blame him ; when you give penalty and red card against madrid and disallow them 3 goals at the bernabeu you want to get off the fucking pitch as soon as possible . 
  but jokes aside , very solid evening of refereeing by borbalan . 
  once you see what nazi propaganda ( that also began as ` posting shit ' , just on different level ) has done for germany and consequently europe , you get to understand why are we so allergic to such things over here . 
  trust me , i feel the same about usa . 
  i could n't live there with things like these being allowed . 
  it 'd scare the shit out of me . 
  what 's flying rabbit carrying on his back ? 
  an eagle . 
  you should visit mestalla , steep angles would never look the same again to you, 
  to an outside observer it would take 3.3 seconds . 
  to you it would take 1/299 ,792,458 th of a second because your time is `` slower '' . 
  why the hell do you play national anthem before every league match ? 
  wow . 
  i actually did n't know that . 
  before every baseball , basketball , american football match there 's an anthem ? 
  man if somebody in europe did this , you ca n't imagine the cries of `` nationalism '' :'), 
  what time is it ? 
  fun fact :, 
  slavic people call germans `` niemcy '' ( polish ) , `` nijemci '' ( serbo-croatian ) , '' \u043d\u0435\u043c\u0435\u0446\u043a\u0438\u0439 '' ( russian ) , '' \u043d\u0435\u043c\u0441\u043a\u0438 '' ( bulgarian ) , itd. , compare any slavic language , for the same reason !, 
  it derives from the proto slavic word * n\u011bm\u044a for `` mute '' , or the people who do n't speak the language . 
  on the contrary , `` slavs '' derives from `` slovo '' , meaning `` word '' - people who speak . 
  this is correct , well done . 
  in short - yes , but not back to the romans !, 
  romans called `` slave '' * servus * . 
  word * sclavus * / * slavus * in meaning of `` slave '' in addition to `` slav '' started to enter medieval latin ( consequently french and thus english ) in 9th and 10th century because , most linguists agree , of the common enslavement of slavish people . 
  relevant flair for plumber videos, 
  here 's also a better video :, 
  security or police do n't bat an eyelid . 
  worth noting that the red card against angers was for a player on the bench . 
  still a red , but they did n't finish the game with 10 players at least , 
  the wolven storm from the witcher 3 is mine !, 
  what about over 9000 ?

  that would be lloyd dyer .

  ah , you sensed a tiny little chunk of sevilla fans attitude , nice < 3, 
  replacing griezmann at the calderon ? 
  honestly it 's just sad at this point, 
  trouble is he 's inciting people to start to look at the country that way . 
  his supporters will very soon start to ask for abolishing judiciary system because it ` holds him back ' from doing the right things .

  ten squats a day keep the cyka away, 
  which was exactly the point of giving the winner a direct spot , 
  your point stands , but keep in mind celta did rest some of their players in the el group stage . 
  they are getting better as the competition goes + they wo n't be focusing on league anymore, 
  iirc aspas and jonny did n't play , while orellana did n't start . 
  were they suspended or injured if they did n't rest them ? 
  ok i had to check to avoid confusion :d, 
  aspas did n't play in vigo , while he came off bench in amsterdam for the last 20 minutes ( and scored as well as you pointed out ) . 
  orellana came off bench in celta-ajax ( scored as well ) , did n't play in amsterdam .
