  jonny did n't play in either , pablo hernandez did n't play in amsterdam . 
  marcelo diaz did n't play in vigo . 
  so , while i absolutely agree ajax outperformed celta in both of the matches in group stages , i can also see why are celta viewed by the bookies as more probable to win it as their form is really on the rise and they do n't have domestic title race to think about . 
  as long as people watch cl ( and they will watch it even more ) , the trend is going to continue . 
  which is basically every game, 
  i checked the career of all players that have won the world cup since 1994 and nobody met the criteria . 
  if by ` world cup ' op meant ` club world cup ' , then fuck the op . 
  see , i am breathing oxygen ... 
  it 's very fresh today , is n't it , carbon comrade ? 
   if you had a kg of u238 and waited 4 billion years , you 'd have roughly half a kg of u and half a kg of pb . 
  sure ? 
  how many moles of pb will form at the end of the chain from one mole of u238 ? 
  thank you , i panicked a little bit thinking i learnt everything wrong in school as it usually happens with science , 
  no problem , 
  however - i do n't know if you 're english , but presuming you are - i always have the same type of discussion with football fans of english clubs . 
  you have to understand that the midfielder is n't what it was 10-15 years ago . 
  kante is an absolute beast of a player and covers every blade of grass on the pitch , but i do n't want a player who will only do defensive things and lay off the ball , because then i have to have another who will create things forward . 
  just football philosophy things i guess !, 
  just a correction - while mercury is tidal locked , it does n't always face the same side to the sun . 
  it maintains 3:2 ratio of rotation : revolution . 
  no atmosphere part is correct , but the thing is that it does n't have to always face the same side to be extremely hot or cold . 
  simply , if you do n't have an atmosphere , you 're gon na burn in the sun and freeze in the shade , no `` mid-zone '' . 
  actually , english one is . 
  you guys always have the broadcast on the different side , did n't you realize that before ? 
  :d compare zlatan 's goal in that friendly against sweden as well . 
  it would be ref 's decision nonetheless - it 's good to consult with the affected player if there 's only one . 
  i would give you hundred upvotes if i could . 
  great read , and very accurate as well !, 
  slabel, 
  reporter after the first half , probably :, 
  * `` how do you see the match so far , mr. 
  * `` oh , it 's a delight , thank you '' *, 
  pfff , whoever plays fm knew about this 2 years ago :d, 
  below 15 $ maybe , above not in the slightest, 
  it 's mostly the transfer update . 
  gameplay and engine issues are still present + goalkeepers got way stupider . 
  worth ~ 12 $ just for potential mods and new shiny feel imo . 
  oceanian teams in good position to qualify for the world cup :, 
  well with refereeing mexico had against trinidad they 'll win every match easily :'), 
  i learnt that one from dota 2 ... cyka blyat , jajaja and putang ina mo are basic vocabulary, 
  as far as i can remember , that 's the only one that you can easily miss and that significantly changes the ending . 
  there 's also visiting emhyr with ciri after kaer morhen battle ( but you ca n't really `` miss it '' , you can only undervalue its importance ) . 
  oh yes , there are some for sure !, 
  for example `` stranger in a strange land '' and `` cave of dreams '' ( two quests related to madman lugos ) become inaccessible if you complete `` king 's gambit '' ( bears crushing the party in kaer trolde on skellige ) before `` the phantom of eldberg '' ( guy in a hunted lighthouse ) because one of the guys that trigger these quests dies in a fight against bears . 
  you just kill the bastard in `` the sunstone '' . 
  as a good catholic people in red suits , we 'll gladly lend a hand if there are witches to burn . 
  call it a [ friendly match ] ( https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0402/6925/products/bday_1024x1024_44ca1ffb-4531-4621-8948-b7b1a10ee743_grande.jpg?v=1442963629 ) !, 
  not even necessary , just throw your keyboard away and zoom completely in, 
  he 'll do it himself soon enough . 
  love me some classic latin . 
  kurwa is kurwa in any language though, 
  i feel `` jusga '' is close enough for english speakers . 
  you take a long walk before using a knife to cut out horse 's heart in a cave under the light of the moon . 
  then , as you grow up , you never speak of it again . 
  am from an autosave , can confirm ... they lost 1-4 , 0-2 , 0-2 , 2-3 before getting this result, 
  `` sirius '' does n't mean dog , it means `` glowing '' because it 's the brightest star seen from the northern hemisphere ( and indeed the brightest seen in earth 's night sky ) . 
  however , it is located in the constellation canis major ( greater dog ) , and thus sometimes known as a `` dog star '' . 
  thank you sir , came here to write this . 
  [ here 's a link ] ( http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/killing_curse ), 
  [ here 's a useful map ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bb/roman_empire_125.png ), 
  melitene , samosata and zeugma are all marked , and you can see how perception on peutingeriana is different to the one we have today . 
  there 's something that you could find useful , however it 's catalan in original so i used the translate , 
  [ link ] ( https://translate.google.co.uk/translate?hl=en?sl=fr&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https%3a//ca.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/batiha ), 
  english text misses the important classical period and nearchus ' remarks about batihah , hence i linked the translation , 
  so that 's when wenger leaves, 
  football is much , much different sport from basketball or handball . 
  as a referee , i was ( rightfully ) thought that the idea of a `` foul '' in laws is that it is bad - it disrupts the flow of the game , it punishes the opponent ( who presumably had the ball/chance ) , it violates the game as the concept of a fair competition . 
  while in e.g. 
  basketball the foul can be acceptable and normal play for both sides , in football ( the way laws are written ) foul is seen as a sort of `` anti fair-play '' thing to do !, 
  bookable offence is obviously bigger - therefore it has to be punished more . 
  financial aspect is there to potentially deter and prevent future recurrence , and is very strange and aged today . 
  wwwwwwwdwdwwwdwwwwwdl, 
  it 's worth mentioning many members of malfoy/black/lestrange house are named after stars and constellations . 
  among the others - sirius , bellatrix , cygnus , andromeda , draco , even young scorpius , 
  fines for cards are imposed by the ruling national associations in all tiers . 
  in england it 's something like l10 for yellow ( in all tiers ) . 
  in spain it 's something like $ 600 for red in top two tiers , and $ 50 below that . 
  i can find you exact numbers later if you 're interested . 
  it depends . 
  neymar had to learn catalan , it was in his contract . 
   to put into context the series of defeats his team had suffered , foster said that for many of his players this was the first time that they had played a game on a full-size 11-a-side pitch . 
  he also said that in general the players were simply overawed with the occasion , noting that many of them had never even left their villages , let alone their respective islands and that during the pre-tournament training camp in guam a number of the players gained their first experience of an escalator or elevator . 
  following these defeats , several members of the squad said to the manager that they wanted to train as goalkeepers . 
  despite conceding a record number of goals , and with media outlets labelling them the worst team in the world , many of the outfield players were heartened by the cheers their goalkeeper received every time he made a save . 
   despite the heavy defeats suffered by the team , national media was upbeat about the overall performances , remarking that despite the results , none of the athletes ever gave up , that they won the respect of the opposition in all three games they played and that the team as a whole could be very proud of their efforts . 
  it was noted that if , as a result of competing the nation could join fifa that the benefits of membership would outweigh the losses in the tournament . 
  well , they 've got themselves a new supporter !, 
  compare valencian and catalan translations of the european constitution draft from 2004 . 
  spoiler : they 're identical to a single word . 
  you 're getting downvoted but you 're basically right , a little bit overblown but that 's just how it goes . 
  `` intimidating '' atmospheres smh, 
  about 200 of them . 
  happy cake day btw !, 
  w t f, 
  am i the only one who thinks barcelona actually played solid ? 
  they created three fantastic chances and should 've scored few goals ( even without suspicious penalty ) , how many teams do that against juve ? 
  idk man , juve were definitely better side , but in i.e. 
  paris barcelona did n't create anything . 
  here they had two clear cut chances that only heavens know how did they miss . 
  blood,
