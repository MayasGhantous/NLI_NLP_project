   but i can see some other referee saying ronaldo impacted defender by his reaction and call offside here . 
  this is referee 's decision whether ronaldo ` impacts ' on an opponent with his clear will to play the ball . 
  for me , no offside because there 's other madrid player on the far post so defence would still react if ronaldo was n't there . 
  if ronaldo even touched any atleti player , it 's offside . 
  but i can see some other referee saying ronaldo impacted defender by his reaction and call offside here . 
  in case you 're too young to remember , that 's an old dota2 meme . 
  in short , user u/esportsrep had a 10-year old daughter alexa who comitted suicide after hearing arteezy streamsniped during pauses on dotapit . 
  here 's the thread - https://www.reddit.com/r/dota2/comments/2xdw75/dotapit_secret_vs_empire_arteezy_stream_sniping/, 
  osfrog literally my finest creation osfrog, 
  yup , so our angel alexa died in vain . 
  tragic story . 
  just link him / r/prequelmemes , he 'll kill himself, 
  * power cows, 
  if you live together for a certain time it becomes absolutely the same as marriage in most countries , financially and otherwise . 
  oh you bet, 
  the feels . 
  alcoholism leads to ~ ~ some ~ ~ really fucked up lives . 
  for reading about history - wiki in english offers some actually ok info , [ here 's the link ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/valencia_cf ) .

  warning - it 's not easy to understand the full pain and feels these memories bring if you did n't live through them , but that 's only natural . 
  fun facts ? 
  about the city or club itself ? 
  city is the birthplace of paella , club was sued by dc comics regarding bat on the logo . 
  as bu3ny said many times :, 
   illusions fully bestow arcane aura . 
  your allied dark seer 's wall of replica created an illusion of the enemy crystal maiden . 
  that illusion bestowed arcane aura to your team while it was alive . 
   be a man, 
  lacks snow on the mountain fuji . 
  he 's got knowledge, 
  / u/leafeator please do n't make questions about how often we queue party/solo obligatory ( required questions ) because there are people like me who do n't play dota but would like to participate . 
  what has it got in its nasty little pocketses ?? 
  supports getting flamed for denies incoming, 
  i give it 7 max, 
  you underestimate my power, 
  no excuses , as a referee you must know this . 
  it 's on the tests all the time , at least it was for me , to ensure you remember it . 
  remove fences , animals kill each other ? 
  i offer help for 50 $ , you 'll save some money, 
  plus he gives navi golem just in time to end the game . 
  he and kotlguy are becoming my favourite `` smaller tournaments '' casting duo . 
  of course there are casters on a higher level , but it feels pretty good to watch these two guys , nice mixture of banter , game knowledge and hype . 
  very relaxing and solid cast . 
  his accent may sound strange , but there are stranger accents in casting ( looking at you , xyclopz ) and they are doing pretty ok :d, 
  depends . 
  xyclopz is fluent in a sense he does n't stutter or make mistakes , but i can barely understand a word when he talks . 
  may just be a regional preference . 
  lacoste speaks what you could call broken but understandable english - but i agree that it can sound irritating ( especially if you 're a native speaker ) and that he has to improve his conversational skills . 
  count the legs , 
  top kek, 
  so happy for rijeka . 
   provide the attending teams with the bootcamp for better ti preparation . 
  all the way to ti ? 
  because that 's very convenient for adjusting to timezone difference and stuff . 
  if they do n't get points deducted for this pitch invasion / s, 
  really happy for them !, 
  amazing season , deserved title !, 
  osfrog wathcing dreamleague obviously, 
  you meant to say `` how is this balanced unclenox '', 
  frostbite has a ministun at the beginning followed by a root . 
  overgrowth does cancel channeling spells . 
  it has a 0.1 seconds long initial stun . 
  if the correct name for that is interrupt instead of ministun , thank you for correction . 
  [ source ] ( http://dota2.gamepedia.com/crystal_maiden ), 
  hello future people, 
  that 's correct . 
  it 's obvious that you are referee  as a former one , i agree with you completely . 
  that 's a great leader 's speech if i ever saw one . 
  you do n't need news , america , he will tell you what you need to know !, 
  absolutely deserved , great season by them . 
  respect ? 
   who is so moved by her plight, 
  sometimes i wonder about how beautiful that song had to be to move mandos vala enough to change the fate and destiny of the peoples of middle-earth . 
  buyout clause works only between spanish clubs . 
   any player can pay his boyout clause and leave ... 
  player , yes . 
  and there is 44 % income tax on that . 
  but united 's bid to atl\u00e9tico means nothing . 
  griezmann has to buyout his contract himself , whereas spanish clubs can sue for the buyout clause and only pay 18 % tax . 
  played centaur warchief , back then he had an ability similar to axe 's call and strength grow as an ultimate . 
  been told to buy kelen 's ( that 's blink ) so that was my first item ( screw boots or any regen ) . 
  do n't remember the result . 
  it 's treason then . 
  probably you move on the y-axis , similar to torrent and earth spike ( creeps will spawn if lion stuns somebody inside the camp at :59 as well or whatever time needed that they are in the air at the spawn point , similar to kunkka 's torrent ) . 
  agreed . 
  however , it 's mostly meta thing ... she 's a queen of early game engagements . 
  i think ms nerf is a solid one that will come back to bite cm once meta changes a little bit . 
  if you nerf aura you 'll just dumpster a hero . 
  he basically wanted to stay , but we desperately needed money . 
  definitely , depending on your point of view . 
  i 'm just used to refer height as the y-axis outside dota !, 
  also , grip does n't affect chronoed units . 
  that early ( no boots ) you 'll usually smoke alone or with another support so that 's not such an issue . 
  well spanish has ` b ' and ` v ' as different letters , people just do n't learn to eber differentiate them . 
  game to decide artour 's destiny for this ti, 
  that is correct . 
  if players of both teams offend the laws , the kick should be retaken . 
  i can see ` douglas adams-esque ' paragraph about this . 
  pretty solid beam .
