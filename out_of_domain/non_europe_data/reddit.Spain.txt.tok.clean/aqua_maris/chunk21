   cm level 1, 
  pick one, 
  until they make bkbs . 
  it was more related to the ` much more situational lina ' part , as lina - against bkbs - is a right-clicking machine gun that has 850 pure damage magic piercing nuke with agh 's , while lich is basically food . 
  only if they hate sand . 
  you need manager on such event even more than coach , i guess . 
  you do n't want to handle ` outside dota affairs ' - transport , accommodation , travelling , food , schedule , interviews - by yourself . 
  hi envy , thank you for doing this . 
  happy belated birthday !, 
  1 ) what do you thing about new major/minor change ? 
  how many lan tournaments can we have throughout the season without it becoming a burden for players ? 
  2 ) any thoughts or hope of regional pro player associations that would work together ? 
  3 ) what data do you use to analyze the matches , other than looking replays ? 
  4 ) good luck at ti , i think you could have a very strong showing !, 
  yeah i 'm gon na trust you on this one, 
  ahfu is the most underrated pos4 in the world , the guy is really really good and often overlooked when talked about the best . 
   just look at how good people speak english in spain/italy compared to sweden/germany for example, 
  while your post generally makes sense , this part is very much off ... of course swedes and germans will learn english easily when their first language is germanic as well . 
  many spaniards easily learn italian and vice versa . 
  i hope you mean ` more populated ' :d, 
  canada is larger than china . 
   that cm is not right in the head . 
  you take that back . 
  or else . 
  [ ] ( / creepymaiden ), 
  uk just does n't do gaming on pc that much . 
  consoles are masterrace for you . 
  shame . 
  #zooming intensifies, 
  at least you will always have inside information about the next gui changes kappa, 
  man , china votes as well . 
  we 'll have ~ 4 chinese players in the all-star . 
  can you help me ? 
  i 've seen that website ( tvtropes ) linked a number of times and i do n't understand what it 's supposed to be : /, 
  thanks !, 
  so ` tropes ' are phrases used across repeatedly like the rhode island surface is always used in the us as a comparison for size ? 
  i just found it all really confusing without any tv and popular knowledge . 
  thanks !, 
  i was never into tv so i guess that 's why i could n't make anything out of that site . 
  thanks man !, 
  well , they did always write about * heroes * in the * ancient * times : thinking :, 
  catholic mass ( i do n't know how do you call the book from which you read the scripture in english ) will also transcript the old testament saying ` lord ' in place of \u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d4 , although bible translations itself usually use the name `` yahweh '' . 
  i mean , i understand what you 're saying and all , but only time it works is when you random it and want to play support . 
  otherwise there are many better # 5 heroes that do more stuff with less farm . 
  picking wr for hard supporting just feels not-viable . 
   why is / r/dota2 and twitch so eager to discredit mdl 's result and lgd 's win ? 
  because people are always bitchy like that ? 
  man , you take those places too seriously . 
  valve know their shit , they are multi-billion company and they 've probably resolved this thing long ago . 
  but why would they ? 
  nobody of players or organizations did speak up , meaning they 're probably informed that thing has been dealt with long ago . 
  same here , but only if i select team np ( which i wanted to do , actually ) . 
  others work ( tried for empire and og ) . 
  blood and wine does offer more of everything , but nothing will top the story of olgierd and iris von everec for me . 
  such sadness is the essence of witcher games , and ending of that quest was and will be the hardest decision i ever had to make in video games . 
  so did you take the rose ? 
  i want to know !, 
  what 's the good ending option ? 
  :o did you take the rose ? 
  she 's actually a girl , 
  he does n't have to pick it up . 
  if a defender uses tricks to bypass the backpass rule ( lowers his head to the ground to make the ` ground header ' or flicks it to his head etc ) the play stops and he 's given a yellow , regardless of what keeper does . 
  it 's the intent that matters . 
  source : ( former ) referee, 
   i 'm not from europe , but my family does originate from there ( 3 generations ago ? ), 
  american confirmed . 
  which 1/32 of you is irish , and which 1/16 italian ? 
  is he oppressed yet ? 
  horse meat may be my favourite . 
  it 's amazing and full of iron and b vitamins ( people diagnosed with anemia are often encouraged to eat it ) . 
  downside ? 
  it 's very expensive : /, 
  he was n't offside , no ` technically ' needed , 
  it 's actually a script !, 
  a little bit less , around 750 $ . 
  see this thread - https://www.reddit.com/r/dota2/comments/4xxyk5/the_shipping_for_the_mirana_statue_is_over_700_to/, 
  also , people did n't get what they ordered . 
  mate , i understand what you 're trying to say ... 
  but everybody can predict winning team in ** half ** of all 2k or lower games , even without looking at the lanes or team composition - you just always pick ` dire ' . 
  i hope you were fed in game at the very least . 
  now i feel old :(, 
  friends and i have picked up hearts and became hardcore players ... we still play it to this day when we gather , even made a ` team ' version when you play together with the player opposite to you, 
  the famous persian zombie pilots , first used on chariots in battle of issus 333bc, 
  i do n't think people outside us generally know about the guy ( i just googled him after your comment ) , but that does n't make the video less awesome !, 
  oh thank you now i want the icewrack map < 3, 
  every player now starts with hand of midas gaben, 
  fm regens i 'm telling you, 
  you can find enormous amounts of money in the sea around skellige , if you ever need more . 
  just go to those question marks and collect the gear to sell it . 
  with igni build these things melt like nothing . 
  near the middle of the game ( that skellige quest ) it took me cca 15 seconds to kill one . 
  vodu . 
  vodu . 
  soon ... soon, 
  yup , and in the same manner you ( or some hacking terrorist group , whatever ) can rendevous with the asteroid that is n't going to hit earth and threaten to move his trajectory a little bit closer , 
  and then it does n't rain for once in a decade,

  my guess - do n't chat , do n't get reports , give and get commends , do n't spam ping . 
  source - had like 9975 or something at one point , never flaming and always talking positive , and could n't get 10000 because i kept on using chat ( i guess ? ) . 
  or maybe i just lacked few more commends .
