  does imaginary madrid team have imaginary madrid fans ? 
  in that case , get him , he just called us getafe -- e, 
  it 's been like this for at least 20 years . 
  edit : also , i 'm very surprised that people did n't know about this , but then again la liga is n't that well followed . 
  i mean you literally have to look at the schedule for 3-4 consecutive weeks to notice the pattern , or follow two different teams :d, 
   4 heroes full , 5 heroes full , chuan trying for seconds , chuan 's gon na tap out . 
  i bought the story until this point, 
  relevant flair, 
  something something moba design past 13 years, 
  you can say that , but we all know the truth lies with unsatisfied io voters from last year 's arcana . 
  try viper, 
  jordanians are proud eu citizens anyway have you seen streets in germany and sweden, 
  i know you 're joking but do n't try it , seriously . 
  cm core ca n't really work . 
  been there , tried that . 
  at least it ca n't above 2k , presumably anything can work below that if you 're good enough player :d, 
  you ca n't win mid . 
  you obviously have no damage to contest right-clicks , so you have to rely on your q for last hitting . 
  however , the spell still costs mana to spam , and cm has no mana . 
  even with your aura and reasonably quick bottle nova does n't have enough damage to provide steady income ( it ca n't kill a ranged creep even when maxed ) . 
  you 're slow af , without escape mechanism , and super squishy . 
  even if you do n't get just ran at by the opposing mid , you can get easily ganked . 
  compare other heroes that can sometimes rely only on their spells for last hitting - lina can stay much farther behind due to range and travel distance on dragon slave ( that also kills a ranged creep when maxed ) , zeus has a way more spammable nuke so he can also drop deeper and bide his time , dk is super tanky , dp is much faster and can heal herself to escape the gank ... 
  i bought ps4 for this game !, 
  was worth it !, 
  guys i was watching from my internet explorer , did na ` vi win ? 
  pure skill by ana to survive this gank rofl, 
  thank you mr. assistant referee < 3, 
  he 's easily the best player in the croatian league . 
  but i do n't think he 'll leave , now that they are in playoffs . 
  honestly , this is inexcusable , var or not . 
  if you need var for this you should n't be refereeing at this level already . 
  i know ( hence the comment above ) , but i think that would happen if they dropped out . 
  he really is . 
  people just do n't rate defenders the same way as midfielders and forwards , but if there 's one player from hnl that could easily jump to some big teams if needed , that 's ristovski . 
  19 games more ( so 64 with aberdeen ) , way back to 21 sep 2014 ( 1-2 against dinamo ) . 
  edit : also , they never lost at this stadium , aberdeen was at the old one . 
  ( ttttntntntnn ), 
  freeze him, 
  this is ( i think ) his 3rd goal of the season from the direct free-kicks , plus he hit at least two crossbars as well . 
  in the end easier for osijek than one could ever imagine . 
  my predictions , bolded and explained :, 
  qarabag vs ** kobenhavn ** - qarabag with a chance , this one is not in the bag , but kobenhavn should pull it off, 
  apoel vs ** slavia praha ** - if the czechs do n't melt under the sun on cyprus , they should go through, 
  olympiakos vs ** rijeka ** - oly are favourites , this one will depend on the first match and i think rijeka 's got what it takes to end up undefeated in greece, 
  ** celtic ** vs astana - another ` super hard ' draw for celtic, 
  ** hapoel ** vs maribor - the israeli should go through, 
  istanbul vs ** sevilla ** - basaksehir have pretty strong squad , but i think sevilla are too strong, 
  ** napoli ** vs nice - napoli win both matches, 
  liverpool vs hoffenheim - could go either way , i do n't know how strong liverpool are at the moment, 
  young boys vs ** cska ** - cska going through pretty easily, 
  ** sporting ** vs steaua bucuresti - sporting are lucky again , first with miraculously getting into the seeded spot , now drawing steaua, 
  yes , i do n't watch pl , but i watch all games of croatian league ( and also every qarabag match in the qualifiers for the past 4 seasons ) , 
  thanks man . 
  i only know lovren and coutinho . 
  hoffenheim lost two of their key players so i guess tie is pretty favoured towards liverpool now . 
  no offence taken mate ... we ca n't all be the same !, 
  it depends on the legal system of the country ; usually there are two types of contract - one is ` work contract ' as the one you 've got with a company where you get a regular wage and basically can quit ( or get fired ) almost whenever , and the other is ` deed contract ' where you get paid to paint a painting , write a piece of music , build a bridge etc. , and you get your pay for that task . 
  in majority of the countries ( spain definitely ) football contracts are of the first type , meaning worker should be free to leave when he wants ( if he pays his contract off as neymar did ) . 
  however , some countries regulate it in a different way , some regulate football players as ` artisans ' who lend out their specific skills to a company ( football club ) . 
  started following a little bit after you became a hit with gurbanov , and more intensively after the title and rbs matches , 
  to ask akke, 
  no peruvians though, 
  one was cached , and the other was n't , 
   valencia finish in top 6, 
  this is a very simplified approach and basically football manager article ... arranging transfers is often much more complicated and involves lots of tinkering with different agents and agencies . 
  plot twist : he 's from sea as well and sleep deprivation made him go nuts . 
  vp are good, 
  inb4 lfy lose the upper bracket final on purpose to ensure all-china grand finals . 
  * tinfoil * * hats * * on *, 
  people overrate eg players individual skills , it 's been like that for a long time ... sure , universe is a great offlaner ( no ` buts ' here ) , sumail is one of if not the best 1v1 mids ( however , the midlane is n't 1v1 anymore anyway and sumail 's midgame decisions are n't that good as his laning ) , and that 's about it ... 
  artour is a good carry , but his cult on this sub is strange , he 's not one of the world 's bests . 
  zai understands the game very well but there are clearly better 4s , crit is solid but he 's not a good 5 ( he 's much better as 4 ) , you can see that from his movements and uncomfortable play with classic pos .5 heroes . 
  i 'd say while eg generally scored an underwhelming position on this ti , madness and incredible reactions about their play are way off . 
  whole year eg looked like a team that will lose to the very best teams , play even and usually win against teams at their level , and sometimes lose against the slightly ` worse ' teams . 
  edit : happy cake day !, 
  you are now banned from / r/pyongyang, 
  there are both true and pseudo random distributions in the game . 
  more [ here ] ( https://dota2.gamepedia.com/random_distribution ), 
  ok this game will go down in history as one of the best ever . 
  then you see translations of gregorian chants from latin ( where you have to translate perfect rhythm , metric , rhyme , sacred religious mysteries , balance of vocals and symbolism ) and it takes it even on higher level - you wonder how incredibly hard working people had to do that . 
  krappa, 
  mmr now divided into < 500 and  500 categories . 
   my car used to puke constantly, 
  sounds like you need a mechanic, 
  just for the record , english longbow required three fingers to operate , contrary to many other bows that require only two , 
  then you are a very strong person , 
  the war-bows of the medieval time , with a draw weight of around 100lb , would certainly have required all three . 
  even if it was , na power still makes no sense . 
  but this chain is a point of his observation anyway , 
  this is classic mafia warning , not assassination attempt . 
  no way you miss head that big other than intentionally .

  of course there is n't - there is only observer 's definition of simultaneity and something called proper time ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/proper_time ) . 
  however , it is not that important - since you ca n't transmit any information faster than light , nothing can influence you before you get measurable info on it , if you understand what i mean . 
  you ca n't look towards the sky , see a faraway star and say ` this star is probably dead right now ' , because it 's not dead for you , and there 's no way to transmit info that it 's dead towards your point faster than you can see it dying .

   can someone give me a good dl ; cr summary, 
  he was visiting his father 's relatives in herzegovina , two people allegedly burst out of the bushes , fired several shots , and escaped by a car . 
  one shot hit his thigh , he was rushed to the local hospital .
