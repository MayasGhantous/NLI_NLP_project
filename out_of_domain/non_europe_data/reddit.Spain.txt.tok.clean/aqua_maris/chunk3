  well if you 're going ancients mirana expect me to ignore those boxes right at the beginning of the game . 
  it 's official - https://twitter.com/teamsecret/status/712832331875270656, 
  empire twitter guy promptly reacts :, 
  try to not repel her and you 'll see how strong your relationship really is . 
  here , you dropped this : \\ \\, 
  because eg are known not to mess with a winning recipe . 
  obligatory translator 's note : plan means keikaku . 
   the humble support, 
   your sacrificial and selfless nature propels your fellow teammates to their maximum potential . 
  if only they could make the most out of your martyrdom then you would win every dota game . 
  every last hit your team misses hurts like a thousand pinpricks preventing you from achieving true glory . 
   lets face it - you 're kind of meta . 
  while everyone else is focused solely on the farm in front of them you are thinking ahead and anticipating future opportunities . 
  your ability to multitask and perceived map awareness let you keep your team in the loop . 
  sometimes you even like to tell then what abilities they should have used in the last team fight . 
  but that 's ... that 's me, 
  came here to see this, 
  our lord jesus played wraith king, 
  and thus , the schism broke our communion . 
  that 's got to be loda, 
  i feel you man , i bought a more expensive ticket to dotapit that included a `` free secret gift '' , turned out that the gift was a raffle ticket where we got a chance to win the online discount in the best videogame store evah, 
  maybe in your games . 
  i usually get 4 abaddons in my team almost until the creeps start spawning . 
  can confirm this, 
  wares = obtained, 
  any spell counts for damage increase ( except thing like lifesteal or bash ) . 
  items count as well ( urn , dagon , orchid , blademail too ... ) . 
  this sheds a completely new light on the meaning of the word `` assist '', 
  yeah seriously report that dude, 
  you could almost say the thread is haunted, 
  from, 
  mine . 
  my only two items when playing support riki, 
  he 's 3k now he 's stopped playing it, 
  if it bleeds ... 
  4 words check out, 
  at least golf does n't have toxic environment, 
  ori and the blind forest . 
  then ask your friends what would they do and do the opposite, 
  great stuff !, 
  please do more !, 
  ticketmaster are nincompoops , and we shall not toil with them no more ? 
  so drop it in base and pick it up every time when you need to resummon ? 
  cool strat i approve, 
  this is probably the best post i 've ever seen, 
  with orb of venom not being uam anymore support viper is a thing, 
  flair party !, 
  i love tundra warden , but for the best look usually mix arcana with the heart of the north set , maybe add icebound floret weapon . 
  it actually looks amazing in the game itself , not just on the screen . 
  see the white in their eyes caroleans are marching on, 
  to update , i 've just tested some things as well . 
  do n't know how to record though . 
  calling roshan with main axe outside the pit will ** end the bug ** . 
  after the call ends , rosh will head back to pit , but the bug can be reproduced at any time . 
  during the bug , roshan is actually ** killable outside the pit ** . 
  you ca n't rightclick him , but any spell damage still applies - tried it with axe ulti ( magical , slow but works ) , qop ulti ( pure ) and death prophet ulti ( physical ) - all of those killed roshan while he was under the effect of the bug and chasing after axe . 
  so while normally you would n't be able to do as much damage to roshan while he 's outside of the pit , this way you can safely kill it in base with , say , exorcism . 
  above mentioned things ** wo n't draw the aggro ** from axe towards the other heroes as they would usually do . 
  edit : [ here ] ( http://imgur.com/phnalty ) is a nice screenshot of aegis in radiant base , this is a definitely doable thing with every rosh respawn if you go for the strat . 
  supports that do n't buy sentries deserve to be killed . 
  neither can invis heroes . 
  roshan can be damaged , it just ca n't be rightclicked/targeted . 
  exorcism would kill it for example . 
  [ screenshot ] ( http://imgur.com/phnalty ) of aegis in base . 
  why are you posting something that is not 6.87 patch notes, 
  dignity of trump 's america, 
  throne means nothing , kills mean everything, 
  dreams of conquest, 
  destroyed, 
  my thoughts about bruno as well . 
  \\  well memed !, 
  a lot of lich ults . 
  a lot . 
  true na dota right there, 
  game of the year so far . 
  definitely game of the year so far . 
  it will require something amazing to overtake this . 
  not just the fights and flashy plays , but also positioning , tactical discipline , strategy , ideas , execution ... amazing . 
  davay empire !, 
  that would make him better in zoning . 
  i thought we already agreed you 're not empire twitter guy , turbo :p, 
  now i do n't know if you just want to reduce cooldown of telekinesis from 22 to 22.0 , but in case you 're being serious , the same applies ... +1 armor makes you able to trade hits like a beast, 
  true support, 
  can confirm there were . 
  maybe they 'll fix it now though . 
  just nerf that invoker and i 'm happy . 
  i do n't like it at all so far . 
  but let 's give it a try . 
  at least more cm buffs though ... 
  reduced cd on q is also fantastic , man . 
  i wish intelligence boosting spell damage could also buff cm . 
  but she needs some intelligence first . 
  faceless void approves, 
  na ` vi ti6 strat confirmed, 
  what took you so long ? 
  that 's how i see it too . 
  you farm utility items and spend teamfight in background double silencing or hexing people . 
  for me he now feels as a conductor of his team during fights , and splitpusher to a lesser extent between the fights . 
  do n't ever stop fixing that hero , man . 
  good luck laning with your armor against this new -2 armor stone,
