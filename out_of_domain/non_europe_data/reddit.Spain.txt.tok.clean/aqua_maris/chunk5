  mu 's 18793 net worth on qop at 30 minute mark was the ** 8th highest ** ever achieved on the hero . 
  if one looks only lan events , it jumps to the ** 2nd highest ** ever . 
  not sure if serious question , but you bind it to a different key ? 
  i use my steelseries keyboard macro for this instead of the script , but it 's basically the same . 
  my m2 key is bound to two `` v '' keys pressed in quick succession and i just put my armlet on v key . 
  in the same manner i use m1 key as a f5 -  f3 which makes quick buy + courier deliver items . 
  imagine the shitstorm that would ensue if that drops on 49.96 %, 
  * minecraft intensifies *, 
  and yet , somehow og just lost game 2 against newbee with literally 9k player playing slark !, 
  i was kidding , but what you say is actually not true . 
  it would 've been true if in every game there 's a same number of heroes on winning and losing side . 
  however , it 's not necessarily so , thus the all heroes winrate stat does n't have to be exactly 50.00 % at all times . 
  do i have to explain it further or you get what i mean ? 
  if somebody drops out before picking and does n't pick a hero , then 4 heroes win/lose ( usually lose ) , while 5 win . 
  imagine we had only 10 heroes available in the whole game , note them from a to j. 
  game 1 - heroes a , b , c , d and e play and win against heroes f , g , h , i and j. 
  game 2 - same heroes/teams , but different team wins ( fghij team ) . 
  game 3 - same heroes/teams , only this time player playing hero a does n't load and pick his hero at all . 
  his team ( bcde ) loses . 
  in total , hero a has 1/2 winrate ( did n't participate in game 3 at all ) , heroes bcde have 1/3 winrate , while heroes fghij have 2/3 winrate . 
  we calculate total average by summing up winrates of heroes and dividing the sum by the number of heroes . 
  1/2 +4 \\* 1/3 +5 * 2/3 = 31/6 , divided by ten heroes it gives 0.5166 or 51.67 % average winrate . 
  yes , i know and i absolutely agree . 
  that 's why it says 50.00 % in the first place . 
  but it 's not ` literally impossible ' as suggested above . 
  how do you push highground against that ... thing ? 
  while i really like both concepts ( some elements especially , spells depending on a day/night cycle are beautiful ) , they somehow feel slightly op . 
  but still , nothing that few doses of a carefully prescribed * frog balance * could n't solve .

  well they do it when you spin rylai wheel . 
  they banter each and every time , also when you drop those balls to get points lina says something like : `` now this is a true game of chance '' , and rylai responds : `` but i like my wheel ... '', 
  announcer with the two would be perfect .

  in short :, 
  in any given convex polyhedron , if v = vertices ( corners ) , e = edges , f = faces , euler says that, 
  v - e + f = 2 ( try it with anything and you 'll see it works ), 
  also , if p = the number of edges of each face ( or the number of vertices of each face ) and q = the number of faces meeting at each vertex ( or the number of edges meeting at each vertex ) , then :, 
  if we combine the two :, 
  1/q + 1/p = 1/2 + 1/e , since e is strictly positive :, 
  1/q + 1/p  1/2, 
  p and q must both be at least 3 , so the only five possibilities for { p , q } are { 3 , 3 } , { 4 , 3 } , { 3 , 4 } , { 5 , 3 } , { 3 , 5 } .

  help needed here !, 
  i 'm normally getting around 120 fps smoothly on the highest settings . 
  using vulkan , the game is lagging horribly for me . 
  literally unplayable . 
  also , some effects are ` delayed ' and graphics seem worse . 
  amd r9 380 4gb , win8 .1 , i5-4460 . 
  could it be just some cached particles/textures , or something bigger ? 
  it 's only logical . 
  i would buy them both of course , to rest a little bit when i 'm tired of lina bitching as usual, 
  here , you dropped this : \\ \\, 
  is it bad if i read all your comments in your gyro voice ?
