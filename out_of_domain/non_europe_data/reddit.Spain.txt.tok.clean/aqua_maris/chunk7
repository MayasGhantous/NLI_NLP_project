  you 're destroying back-line supports easily with it , or you initiate on a full hp carry and take away around 50 % of his health , 
  of course i did !, 
   ( ok , except for the item options , because i do n't have a ` feel ' for developing or understanding item builds for a hero i never played , just a personal thing ), 
  as a sort of dota developer / theory coach , the thing i first look with any hero is - why do you pick him ? 
  what does it provide and give to your team and overall strategy ? 
  for ** the collector ** , what would you say , as its maker ? 
  he 's a strength hero with terrible manapool , solid damage but abysmal base attack time and very low agility , meaning he ca n't carry really efficiently . 
  his not-so-good movement speed and long cooldowns do n't make for an easy roaming support - so what does he bring ? 
  provides you with an easy low cooldown nuke to start off ganks or solid heal when the ally is low and moving out of engagement . 
  healing occurring in 0.1 second intervals means you 'll rarely be able to avoid the nuke even with something like an armlet ( 5hp/s in 0.11 s intervals ) if you were on full hp or close to it . 
  this one 's huge - being able to deny enemy true sight is a big deal . 
  the radius is n't huge , but enough for your shadow blade slark to be unkillable , or techies to make highground breach near impossible . 
  respawn timer is just icing on a cake , and combining it with seance and bitter spirits , your carry should n't exactly be dead anytime you 're alive in the game . 
  *** dying light ***, 
  it 's vision again . 
  70 seconds cooldown is n't a small number , but it should only be used to secure kills or objectives - good luck fighting under this , or challenging rosh fight . 
  it also pierces bkb , right ? 
  do n't know what to say - this is a type of spell that must be tested through its use . 
  it could be alright , it could be too imbalanced , it 's hard to tell . 
  so what does this hero bring ? 
  utility beyond measure . 
  yes , his spells do have options for a counterplay , so does every spell in dota . 
  the thing is , they require so many different elements of a counterplay just to effectively block a single hero . 
  it feels ( at least to me ) that every one of his spells could be used as an ultimate spell for some other hero . 
  also , i 've said i do n't have a ` feel ' for developing item builds for heroes i 've never played , but it 's obvious there are two very core items for the collector - hand of midas and tome of knowledge . 
  all you need to be effective with this hero are levels . 
  how to balance this ? 
  well , there 's a one way for sure - do n't make him a strength hero , he 'll tank up and do his thing easily  make him dead by the slightest touch so that a team has to protect him and play around that , or that he has to use everything on saving his life . 
  they want national team to be thrown out , that 's it . 
  they 'll do it again . 
  they 're basically trying to dislodge the fa and focus the attention on the corruption in the domestic football . 
  the equation is - no nt on a big stage = no money in the fa = corrupted guys moving to something else than football . 
  what a brilliant , wonderful way to do it . 
  iq 150 minimum those guys . 
  math checks out . 
  czechs out . 
  whatever . 
  you ca n't even imagine . 
  but this is n't a way to put an end to it . 
  i 'm even starting to think the way does n't even exist . 
  they got their tickets for free and when there just to ensure croatia are thrown out . 
  is n't a first time , wo n't be the last unfortunately . 
  i gave up long time ago . 
  i 'm not supporting any croatian side , i 'm somehow glad if they win of course , but i 'm not willing to give my support . 
  it 's the big network , the head guys of the croatian fa are supporting the one party in the parliament , and they have their guys in judicial system . 
  it 's corruption at its best . 
  i can also see what they want to achieve - if there is n't a money in it , the corruption will probably go away - so if we make our football `` amateur '' , throw the nt out of everything , we 'll be able to play a `` clean '' football . 
  the trouble is that sort of football does n't exist anymore - and they 're giving themselves a right to decide what 's best to do with a football in croatia . 
  the vast majority of people do n't care about the corruption is football as the corruption is everywhere - they follow just the nt on big stages and are very upset right now , reasonably so . 
  it 's just hard . 
  it wo n't end easily . 
  those ex-communist ( but not just them , everybody pretty much ) are now breeding their younglings to take over once they finally die . 
  it 's a vicious circle , and we need to put an end to it . 
  but with honest , hard-working young people mostly moving out , i do n't see a bright perspective to it . 
  yes , very much of it . 
  it 's a long story , but the croatian fa is a cradle of money-extortion , corruption and anything you can name . 
  they 've got guys in politics and judicial system , making them well-covered from that side as well . 
  still , they ( flare-throwing maniacs ) should know the address of the fa , the address of the man they hate the most ( zdravko mamic ) , the address of the goverment and parliament - go there , throw the flares , do something ? 
  instead , let 's display the nazi symbols , let 's smash some shops , let 's hide between the thousands of other fans and throw the nt out of competition - because that 's brave , that 's how you fight for the sake of football and your country , that 's how you 're gon na help the honest people end corruption . 
  they 're just helping the `` big bosses '' - instead of corruption , now everybody will talk about flares and hooligans . 
  again . 
  this made me laugh so much :'d, 
  vu\u010dica is croatian surname , and `` livestock '' is used in slang as a `` fucker '' in a positive way, 
  this ^, 
  this . 
  i do n't need people to notice it . 
  if i do my job , we win the freaking game and that 's my reward . 
  definitely agree about kuro ... twitch chat ofc hated his voice but it was so amazing to listen to him . 
  i love listening to people who know dota so much as kuroky . 
   who is friendship , dedication , love ? 
  beesa the carry player & co. ( fronz , mjw , stan and one more guy ) . 
  pretty often in later stages of na tournaments . 
  there 's always a wild card spot , they could grab it . 
  we 're talking about realistic things here, 
  tfw reddit is your future wife / children, 
  qualifier # 2 still has many slots open ( 169/1024 taken at the moment ) ... 
  guess what ? 
  secret applied for both already :'d but team spirit did n't #confidence, 
  now give them the offside flags, 
  croatia are going for the 3rd place . 
  this lineup confirms it . 
  that 's actually pretty smart . 
  should be ready for the knockouts, 
  if the system allows you to lose some matches and get the final prize easier by doing so , then something 's wrong with the system . 
  well , it wo n't . 
  good luck against spain . 
  important thing was to miss the 2nd place . 
  when they saw the czechs were incompetent to do their part ... ` fuck it boys , we 're just gon na do it on our own ' . 
  i would n't count england out , portugal could be in the other half , and i do n't see other teams taking penalties that well, 
  on the riva was where i spent most of my days, 
  chillin ' out drinkin ' coffees yeah dude, 
  and all kickin ' some football outside of poljud, 
  i believe english word is ` stingy ' , or ` miser ' if you want a noun , 
  well , tbh , it 's not easy to play football when you 're on fire . 
  i was actually expecting him to come on during that rain and hail against ukraine to finally solve the problem , but what do i know, 
  meanwhile he rushes boots on a fucking flying hero aka bird, 
  more funds are needed to complete such a research , at the moment it 's out of our boundaries, 
  well pulisic is of a croatian descent after all . 
  france are still in euro , though, 
  bbc had `` saga of the group f '' as an introduction into the games .
