   that does n't mean it 's any good, 
  what do you mean, 
  that music video changed my life forever . 
  drinking his tears of despair and unfathomable sadness ? 
  thanks michael, 
  curse them . 
  pay debts, 
  fifa rating assassins, 
  i love how you mixed ` and ' and ` y ' throughout this :d, 
  without conceding in regular time as well . 
  now i got ta go again ? 
  tell that to andrea pirlo, 
   leapeator, 
  ### ^ ^ ^ over chaaaargeee !!, 
  except if the whole catalonia leaves spain :o, 
  i think he tried to translate parts of `` there are jerks sometimes '' through translate , so `` are '' somehow magically became '' \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c '' , `` jerks '' became '' \u0440\u044b\u0432\u043e\u043a '' because `` jerk '' in english means `` moving quickly '' and '' \u0438\u043d\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 '' is `` sometimes '' after all . 
  you underestimate supernova . 
  those are the names of my brother-in-law and father-in-law . 
  i like the idea . 
  space . 
  poland can into space . 
  i think \u041a\u0440\u044b\u043c \u043d\u0430\u0448 is probably the best choice , because it 's gon na offend either side , so if you ca n't tell if you 're dealing with the russian or ukrainian cyka , this is what you go for . 
  nowhere is safe, 
  also usa . 
  that sweet reddit karma though, 
  `` do you know why i pulled you over ? '', 
  relevant username, 
  who would 've thought, 
  horde the door, 
  relevant username :d, 
  also , if he did n't stop it when he saw the beach ball , he absolutely must 've done it when the actual ball hit it , as it interfered with the play . 
  the same with any ` external body ' , e.g. 
  if the ball hit the random dog or anything else that 's not supposed to be on the pitch . 
  i hated that game ... the weather , the result , gary and freaking luck , we should 've won 3-0 instead of losing, 
  none of them would survive one half in bosnia, 
  never go full agility, 
  not at all . 
  do n't you touch maiden . 
  this is the best contract extension for barcelona today , who cares about munir and samper :'), 
  me as well, 
  romanian . 
  i can play in several positions , and am basically okay with the air ( or the lack of it ) at wear . 
  # 20m will be fine for the basics , we can sort out the details later . 
  oh yeah , they are ` the smoggies ' after all . 
  well even better then , # 15m will do it . 
  where do i sign ? 
  [ i 'll take rodwell 's number then ] ( http://imgur.com/juvtj5q ) , and we 're left with # 15m to sign that other guy from the title ? 
  oh yeah , and ca n't forget , i 've always been a sunderland fan ever since i was a kid , and * i caaa n't help faaaalling in love with sunderlaaand . 
  tbf 1966 was the world cup of the biggest shocks in football . 
  what about the snow on the mountain fuji ? 
  i agree , espanyol looks really solid on paper , i 'm curious to see how will they play !, 
  they have n't . 
  i really , really , really hope segunda wo n't be officially called liga 1,2,3 . 
  - from el confidencial , [ link ] ( http://www.elconfidencial.com/empresas/2016-07-19/banco-santander-patrocinio-futbol-liga-bbva_1235934/ ), 
  lol . 
  meanwhile , no matter how forces and leagues shift , it 's known that arsenal can never play in our second tier anymore . 
  it is , their type of account - 1 | 2 | 3 . 
  logical name for a league of football :'), 
  idk , if they pick up subotic and avoid injuries in midfield ( especially de roon , clayton and leadbitter in holding positions ) , i think they will stand a chance against most teams . 
  adomah will provide , negredo wo n't so much , but hey , that 's why you have nugent and stuani . 
  i mean , i agree with you in a sense people are getting carried away - for me boro are n't really a mid-table contender , but they should be able to avoid relegation . 
  and i have some sort of felling one of those three ( nugent , negredo , stuani ) will score at least 10 . 
  fischer is great for them to give downing some rest when needed , that 's why i see them using those wingers to break with pace against the stronger teams and using stout midfield to try to control the game against the weaker ones . 
  laliga ( without space ) was the official name of the top flight for the last month . 
  before that , we had a contract with bbva ( bank ) and it was officially called liga bbva . 
  now we have another contract with santander and the name is liga santander . 
  meanwhile , you can always call it la liga or primera ( ` league ' and ` first ' ) and everybody will know what do you refer to . 
  everybody in spain uses one of those two names . 
  the same goes for the second tier , it went like this :, 
  liga adelante -  laliga2 ( for a month ) -  liga 1,2,3 ( the most retarded name ever , i know ) . 
  and you can always call it segunda ( ` second ' ) . 
  that 's how it goes in spain . 
  you can dive , make dangerous tackles , scream/shout and any other thing whatsoever and you 'll maybe be sanctioned . 
  however , say something ugly towards referee ? 
  direct red card . 
  ( to be clear , i do n't complain about the second part as such , but about the clear disproportion between the two ) . 
  you missed the chance to name it pre-season burn : ley . 
  awesome industrial rock band name, 
  this . 
  i do n't see it as much as a fan problem , you just forbid the away trips . 
  if i remeber correctly , there is n't much fans in those leagues globally , attendances are really poor . 
  thing is , why would croatian clubs ever want this ? 
  history aside , croatian league is much stronger than other balkan leagues at the moment and this would be a direct shoot in the foot . 
  that would demolish the weaker clubs that would stay out of such a league and pretty much killed the football in the area . 
  plus , i do n't think anybody ( at least in croatia ) would actually be interested in going to the matches against bosnian or serbian clubs ? 
  shame, 
  true , i have a feeling that gaya will get a chance 100 % , we 'll see for santi yet . 
  if fran develops as we all hope and all of them stay at the club ... the dream < 3, 
  and montoya . 
  do n't worry , we 'll get montoya :'), 
  upvoted for visibility . 
  not if you take in enough natrium / s, 
  as a support i actually use this one quite often to signalize my team we need vision somewhere in order to farm/fight , that i 'm on the task and to get the fuck out of those dark areas . 
  what if our eyes are mirrors ? 
  yes, 
  so \u0432\u0438\u0442\u044f would 've been vyitya , and the the second one is correct , \u0432\u044b\u0442\u044f , 
  i 'm aware , do n't worry - but help me , how can i explain ` hard ( like \u044b ) and soft sounds that have no pronunciation of their own without adherent consonant and only signalize something about the preceding one ' to the non-russian speaker ? 
  mind you , russian is not my first language , it 's my sixth one . 
  if you only knew,
