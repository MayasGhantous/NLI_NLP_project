  was hoping for the based god ... was disappointed . 
  what ? 
  no dude , that sausage , egg and cheese melt is delicious . 
  testing video games . 
  i did n't learn till i was 16 years old that i should lift the lid up before taking a piss . 
  city of god . 
  sooooooo good . 
  strawberry , blueberry , blackberry , and raspberry assortment . 
  i would not live long . 
  ok , i was stupid but that 's like ... i mean , you 'd have to make a conscious decision to have less surface area for your ass lol, 
  i 'm late to the party but human trafficking is a huuuuuuuuge problem in most parts of the world, 
  does bbb run the twitter ?

   declined, 
  do you really take this site that seriously ? 
  you do n't use 24 hour clocks ? 
  not to mention hockey and beautiful landscapes . 
  definitely not india either . 
  hmm , interesting . 
  i did ( or at least my family , friends and i did ) when i lived in spain . 
  i mean , they could always search/research it themselves . 
  my disconnect is : why is it ok to laugh at or about someone being raped , male or female ? 
  what 's so hahah lol lmfao about it ? 
  for me i had the opposite mindset . 
  the kid ( s ) with the old , busted ass shoes and gear was probably a regular to frequent player whereas the kid who has on a new pair of neon hyperdunks and a headband was probably compensating for his ass ability . 
  i do n't think i 've ever heard a `` dead baby '' joke . 
   either all hosts cook the way they want . 
  that 's not how a dinner party/get together works . 
  why even bother inviting someone for dinner if you wo n't serve something they 'll eat ? 
  would you want to eat at someone 's house who only cooks their meat well-done ? 
  of course not , so why would you force them to eat it the way ** you ** prefer ? 
  sarcasm is n't easily received/picked up on if communicating by way of text . 
  game streaming . 
  i do n't remember jim croce 's `` i 've got a name '' being in django unchained . 
  tbf he went to 3 consecutive nfc championship games . 
  six minute old account . 
  move along . 
  i often feel bad for tony because i know that one day all this shit he fights through is gon na catch up to him . 
  what the fuck is wrong with that assistant on a&m 's sideline ? 
  edit : i apologise for the circlejerk and my late comment ... i just tuned in and thought it happened just recently . 
  curse ? 
  source ? 
  so if someone is a twat to you , you should be a twat to them , also ? 
  be the bigger person . 
  no you dont understand the big 12 is quite literally * the * worst conference ever and they should all just drop football tbh, 
  not ok with how people treat you ? 
  dude , it 's fucking steak just be a good host and cook the way they want it . 
  fo3 is post apocalyptic dc . 
  new vegas is post-post apocalyptic nevada/arizona/utah / california . 
  edit : added a state, 
  iirc he never really developed the talent they had on defence as well as giving up some pretty big numbers . 
  this seems to happen to me every time i open a master lock . 
  i 've never gotten anything worthwhile out of them, 
  jose cuervo is really gross . 
  we wo n't get those sweet self-lacing nikes from back to the future . 
  oh no i totally understand what you 're saying . 
  i was just saying that fo3 is more of `` we just got hit by a nuclear bomb and we 're dealing with life '' whereas nv is `` the bomb hit us a while ago and now tribes are forming to build a new society . '', 
  did you have this saved for this very moment ? 
  i do n't think the location of his death is all that important , more so that he died . 
  that 's a fair point . 
  yeah , but in all honesty she 'd probably snap him in half . 
  i love your username, 
  that sooner fan is the worst . 
  he 's in every comment section and i swear 90 % of his comment history is `` flair up son ! '', 
  does he still make videos ? 
  everyone 's telling the same joke . 
  it 's still a circlejerk . 
  are they trying to take the wave from you ? 
  ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ actually ^ ^ ^ loved ^ ^ ^ those, 
  i absolutely loved your gray uniforms . 
  you guys seemed to be one of the schools that could pull it off . 
  so basically you do n't like mono color uniforms or the color gray ? 
  nd was the 39th state admitted to the us, 
  well we can revise history for a nickname / s, 
  i hope you 're joking . 
  for centur - oh wait, 
  i 'm going to correct you only for the fact that my name is michael so it bothers me much more than it should when i see people spell michael like * mike-eel * . 
  so it 's not, 
  it 's actually, 
  - michael scott, 
  i know i 'm being an ass , but have you or anyone else on planet earth met one of these false michael 's ? 
  ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ) here ya go , buddy .

  am i the only non-duke fan who legitimately does n't hate them and wants them to win ? 
  * ducks for cover *, 
  assmilk , earl , odd toddlers , slow it down , vcr/wheels , analog 1 & 2 , oldie , window , idk my opinion of classic may be slightly different than others . 
  fuck that took forever, 
  he may have chicken legs and does n't wan na show the country his embarrassingly small calves . 
  i employ the same tactic when i lift or play . 
  if i 'm not wearing sweats , then i rock [ tall socks and shorts with hightop shoes .

  context , please ? 
  is there a chance that the refs did n't have this angle ? 
  honestly asking, 
  patriots , duke , ohio state . 
  duke lacrosse championship confirmed for the 3-peat . 
  tyus jones and grayson allen were huge tonight no doubt . 
  it seemed like allen went after almost every rebound and loose ball . 
  not to mention his points off the bench , too .
