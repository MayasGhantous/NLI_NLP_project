  i believe that the further south you travel in mexico , the safer it gets . 
  i think that can be attributed to the fact that the argentine league ( s ) are simply inferior to the top flight ones in spain , germany , france , etc. 
  and the best players will play abroad . 
  you 're absolutely spot on with the germans and spanish playing together ; the best players are 98 % within their own country and that is a huge advantage over the south americans whose best players play in the pl , bundesliga , serie a and so on as they do n't have that experience playing together . 
  i understand it 's the whole separatist flag thing being a political statement , but what about the refugees welcome signs ? 
  or the bavarian flags being flown at bayern games ? 
  * note : i have no problem with the refugee signs or the bavarian flag . 
  in fact , i do n't have a problem with any of this .

  i 'm not naturally smart and often have to work harder than others to succeed . 
  any advice ? 
  thank you so much !, 
  i really appreciate it . 
  why bother commenting on something from five moths ago ?

   do n't forget how difficult it is to get a top level player to move to dallas,

  if you would read and find the context of the photo , you 'll discover that he often will retouch photos for other people . 
  this is not his mother and he is not claiming it to be . 
  he even states in the comments that it belongs to someone else . 
  - sex with clarinets, 
  - legitimately and honestly trying to summon satan, 
  - sharing toilets at the same time at band camp, 
  - couples making out inside instrument lockers, 
  - shitting in and filling 3 separate toilets, 
  - putting your dick in an instrument bell, 
  - drumline running shows at rehearsal with their testicles out, 
  - sex on the bus to band trips, 
  - multiple blowjobs/handjobs on buses, 
  - fingering on sousa cases, 
  - smoking copious amounts of marijuana on the way to a performance at carnegie hall, 
  - giving a respectful and crafty blow job to your mouthpiece/reed,

  i will update as i get more responses from my marching friends, 
  yeah , pentagrams on the ground , blood shed , candles , the whole nine yards . 
  it does n't matter if kids see it as long as the directors do n't know . 
  if a kid were to say something , it just becomes your word against theirs , and the directors do n't want the awkward headache of fighting with a phenomenon that happens every year anyway . 
  usually people without flair are the ones who talk the most shit , so in a way you do kinda need it for validity . 
  that 's just how it is . 
  but did you beat alabama ? 
  pittsburgh is the king of close losses, 
   three-song repertoire . 
  i think all the big schools do this haha, 
  \\ #lesmilestostatesboro,

  state, 
  if you squint your eyes he kinda looks like lane kiffin, 
  somebody needs to shop this to say `` send nudes '', 
  you ca n't be serious bruv . 
  none of those matchups favor the aac teams . 
  and if you wan na play the `` who lost to who '' game , houston lost to a bad smu team , usf lost by 20 to fsu , temple lost to army and memphis , and tulsa lost by 45 to osu, 
  they never were going to do anything about it, 
  friendly fire, 
  bruh what planet are you on, 
  last time i checked 48-3 = 45 . 
  hey you 're that guy that bitches about the people here and democrats yet still keeps coming back .
