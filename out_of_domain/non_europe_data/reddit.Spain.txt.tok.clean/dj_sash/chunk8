  as you can see , the tall strain is the one having problems , pretty sure it 's because of being too close to the light . 
  my question is , is there anything i can do to help them recover or did i just fuck up big time ? 
  also , since the yellowing is only occuring at the top of the plants , is this a lack of nutrients ? 
  i have n't watered with nutes in approximately a week and today i just watered them with regular water . 
  since i increased the height of the light , the `` soil '' ( coco-perlite ) has been taking longer to dry . 
  should i water again but with nutrients or wait another week until they get dryer again ? 
  thank you !, 
  i 'm familiar but i did n't want to venture into it during my first grow , but it 's definitely something i should have done . 
  i am using a 250w hps and i have that small black fan that appears in the back and today i added another fan on the floor . 
  also , as you can see the roof of the tent is open so that would be the main `` outake '' . 
  it 's the russian facebook, 
  that would be a wrong thing to do . 
  especially with the example in question , this man probably did n't speak much english at first and was being ripped off . 
  ever heard about the subprime crisis ? 
  yeah you would be making a lot of profit but , where are your morals ? 
  did n't know reddit could do this ... 
  ^ listen to this guy because that is what you need . 
  you should listen to an argentinian ... 
  ca n't believe there are still racist fucks like these on reddit . 
  thank you for you answer and the map , it was very enlightening . 
  ( ignore the racists ! ), 
  spain has everything . 
  yes , it has happened since the terrible update . 
  it really sucks !, 
  i came here just to look for that . 
  the drag and drop feature works so badly it is very unreliable , i really do n't understand why they would do this ... 
  21/m been using tinder since december in the us but moved into london since a couple of days ago and have only gotten one match . 
  something must be wrong ... 
  bio : yes i 'm not from here,

  i 've been told that before . 
  the group picture is n't really good , it is n't clear who you are . 
  but maybe i 'm just against group pictures on tinder . 
  it 's a masterpiece that has influenced many directors from our present . 
  this movie was the last one of the director since no one wanted to publish anything he did after this . 
  what an ignorant pig, 
  go ahead and read a book, 
  ca n't believe this guy is getting all these upvotes . 
  the troll and the racists . 
  very nice indeed . 
  the ones that i know are :,

  i do n't know what they will have this week as the big festive week in alicante is about to start . 
  it 's called hogueras and you should definitely come and check it out since it 's very unique . 
  there is a post about it [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/alicante/comments/39t604/big_festival_in_alicante_next_weekend/ ) . 
  stay safe . 
  but he has to do something to stop him . 
  he could be saving his friend . 
  that was amazing , it touched me !, 
  would be pretty cool though . 
  me too ... 
  we live in a white culture , white culture dominates and white culture is hegemonic in every aspect . 
  there is no point for having a white culture center . 
  missing color . 
  nope , you are not supposed to mix seafood and meat in the same paella . 
  that 's not authentic at all . 
  i think you misunderstand what authentic means . 
  something authentic is something genuine and truthful to its origins . 
  yes there are variations which are just as good but just not `` authentic '' . 
  if you want to argue you have to start by understanding what authentic means and we can go from there . 
  i was born and raised in the autochthonous region of paella . 
  it 's not about `` my way '' of doing things but about the way of people who have been cooking it for decades . 
  you may have cooked in sweden , denmark or even in mars but paella is from valencia and the traditional way does not mix fish and meat . 
  have a good day . 
  oh the coops have been my cup of tea for the past three years . 
  it 'll be hard to move on !, 
  how cool rachael !, 
  the battle of algiers ( 1966 ) is an absolute must, 
  so , i 'm visiting the campus this friday and i have a few questions ( i come from spain so i want to make the most out of it ) :, 
  - what is the cheapest way to get from detroit to ann arbor ? 
  - when my official visit ends at around 16 pm . 
  what would you recommend me to do ? 
  ( i come with my mother and my sister ), 
  that 's all basically but i am open to sugestions !, 
  thanks in advance =d, 
  edit : i would like to reply to you all but i 'm currently in dallas cause my flight got cancelled due to the tornado so i will answer when i get to detroit . 
  thank you all for the tips , you all seem very kind and i appreciate your suggestions !, 
  so , i 'm visiting the campus this monday and i have a few questions ( i come from spain and i will major in computer science so i want to make the most out of it ) . 
  when my official visit ends at around 16 pm . 
  what would you recommend me to do ? 
  ( i come with my mother and my sister ), 
  that 's all basically but i am open to suggestions !,

  i was wondering because one of my dreams is to find a decent sized island ( such as the one in cast away ) , sail there and set up my own paradise . 
  ideally , i would make a little civilization with people growing crops , others fishing , others taking care of farm animals and ultimately , just enjoying the life with no stress . 
  i know that there are private islands in many archipielagos but my question is , would it be possible to find a cool island with trees , jungle and a nice mountain ( like in lost ) which has n't been claimed by anyone ? 
  in the middle of the pacific ocean would be best . 
  tl : dr : i want to find an island ( like in lost ) to build my own country/paradise . 
  international freshman here . 
  i am submitting my housing application in a few days and after reading tons of posts about housing here in reddit , i have come to the conclusion that the best place for a computer science major to live in during his first year is central campus . 
  is that right ? 
  however , i have checked other options in north and i wanted to ask about the apartments with shared baths ( nw i + nw ii + nw iii ) . 
  i mean , they seem pretty cool and comfortable but how many freshmen are living there ? 
  is it good in terms of social life or is it like living in the north pole ? 
  i would n't mind living in a typical room with a roommate such as the ones in bursley which are the only one i had a chance to visit . 
  but after seeing the apartments options in north , i have to consider both . 
  so , any advice ? 
  what about baits ?
