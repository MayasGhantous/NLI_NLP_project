  my dog is 4.5 years old and is generally quite well behaved , but he does have some things we have been working on improving :, 
  furniture : when we are home , especially in the same room he will not dare get on the couch or bed . 
  as soon as we are out the door he will find his own way on them . 
  despite this we have tried everything ( covering the couch with sandpaper , blocking it off with chairs , and catching him in the act to be able to reprimand him ) nothing seems to work ... any better ideas ? 
  he has developed a strange habit of pressing his anus against furniture , the rugs , the floor , to then turn around and smell/lick it . 
  obviously this is nasty to humans , and it is making stains . 
  ( yes , he has been de-parisited ) why is he doing this and how can we stop it ? 
  he is a very lazy , but very fit dog , and loves people ( especially strangers ) , my girlfriend keeps trying to convince me to get another dog ( puppy rescue ) to keep him more entertained during the day . 
  he doesnt have any trouble with dogs when we are not there ( doggie hotel , vet , groomers ) , but if we are there ( walking him at park ) he gets very aggressive quickly with other dogs when they come to check him out . 
  this is thus becoming a problem . 
  the vet recommended to give him the chop-chop as most dogs are spayed in the uk and his testosterone levels are probably the issue as other dogs would see him as a threat . 
  we have done this , but other dogs still quickly become aggressive towards him . 
  does anyone know what else we could do ? 
  we have not being able to take him to the park everyday because other dogs are aggressive towards him ( meaning he never growls or scoffs first , he responds ) . 
  any recommendations ? 
  thanks !, 
  ps : yes , i am aware the breed is a stubborn breed , but no dog is a slave to its `` breed '' standard . 
  as noted ... i feel left out without cool friends that also play the best series ever . 
  who wants to join in ? 
  also help me find out what i have please !, 
  i added in flair my friend code is : 3136-6631-8995 xaval, 
  ill add everyone !, 
  thanks !, 
  who is interested in starting a multiplayer game today in about 2-3hrs from now ? 
  uk 7pm time as start time . 
  no specific rules as i am not sure what anyone would recommend . 
  i guess all levels of experience are allowed . 
  sorry for the dumb question ... 
  is each time i start the game different ? 
  for example i had a castille game going on in which from the start navarra , portugal , and aragon all liked castille and i was able to quickly set up vassal on navarra and pus with portugal and aragon . 
  i had a better terra incognita mod , which now seems to crash the game . 
  so i started a new one despite my frustration . 
  i started a new castille game with out the mod , and potugal , navarra , and aragon all hated me with a `` was at war '' massive penalty . 
  i went ahead and improved relations as quckly as possible with all three . 
  royal marriage into navarra and portugal , and in 1449 went to war against granada to start taking the provinces . 
  as soon as i did that both aragon and portugal declared war on me with england , naples , and france along for the ride . 
  i had not seen such a disastrous start ever . 
  is this normal ? 
  currently i have 2 acer s240hlbid 24 '' side by side , and was always going for the idea of 3 screens eyefinity . 
  seeing that beautiful 1440p is the way forward ( because 4k is ridiculously expensive ) i was wondering what would be a reasonable upgrade for me and if i would be better off waiting a few more months for a significant price drop in 4k . 
  in case there are doubts my gpu is a hd7950 . 
  ps : i am based in the uk at this time so any recommended vendors here will be well appreciated . 
  also if anyone wants to buy/trade my current monitors . 
  thanks !, 
  i am interested in starting crossfit . 
  i live in chiswick and are looking for somewhere nearby where i can do this ... google only gave me a location deep in central and east london . 
  any help appreciated !, 
  thanks !, 
  noob here , i am workign on preparing my own start up which leverages off a social network and its users . 
  i am looking at socialengine , phpfox , and drupal to start preparing and have a skeleton version of the site to show concept and idea to seed investors . 
  what do you guys recommend to use ? 
  thanks !, 
  ps : i have very little web development knowledge past basic html, 
  trying to figure out who to contact for an invite ... 
  thanks !, 
  hi guys , i am getting a bit frustrated as its been 6 + weeks and i 've seen no results at all ... let me take you through my usual daily meals :, 
  breakfast : black coffee , 2 eggs , 2 strips of bacon, 
  lunch : salad greens ( spinach , rocket , lettuce , mixed greens ) , chicken or turkey breast or canned tuna . 
  i would usually add a bit of feta cheese and olive oil to compliment . 
  mid afternoon : protein bar or black coffee, 
  dinner : chicken broth soup or green veg soup . 
  sometimes some sashimi or grilled chicken . 
  i think that i am simply not getting enough fat , but i am consuming basically next to no carbs . 
  i am also doing medium levels of cardio and higher levels of weights in the gym 3-4 times a week . 
  i am sure i 've put on muscle , but my body fat % if anything is getting higher . 
  what did you do to start and begin to see results , can you provide some of your experience from when you began from zero to results ? 
  earlier this morning there was a post about getting r/soccer users to fund buying a low tier club . 
  which a great idea , but absolutely difficult to manage . 
  what if we took it a level down , and with the funding pulled together , instead created a new football team a.k.a. 
  reddit fc , to kick off from regional/amateur league to grow into a professional team . 
  built from scratch by us , with us , for us ... heck and we can even start with players from this very subreddit . 
  / discuss, 
  do you still check those sites ? 
  what has happened to them ? 
  are you happier here ? 
  i am suffering from la decima, 
  edit : i did in fact completely hurt my vocal cords screaming last night, 
  hi all !, 
  i 've now been strict keto for a month now !,
