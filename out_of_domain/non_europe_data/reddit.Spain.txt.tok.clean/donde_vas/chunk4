  do drink the kool-aid !, 
  used to be . 
  [ [ disciple of bolas ] ] is taking the life points from the sacrificed creature , [ [ disciple of griselbrand ] ] is doing the same and so [ [ blood host ] ] is , in [ [ crypt incursion ] ] the player is ` eating ' the corpses . 
  usually black life gain comes from destroying and draining something , but this is not happening with this card . 
  the lifelink is coming with the creation , which is odd and out of the color pie . 
  on the other side , white is sacrificing permanents this set , which makes me think that mtg has maybe one color too much , given that white sometimes is too similar to black or green . 
  it 's the realisation of knowing that if i were 18 again as i was when i started i would n't play the game as it is now because i could n't afford it ( 99 % percent of the commons and uncommons they print today are constructed unplayable , budget decks are worse that they have ever been ) and also because of their focus on lowering the complexity and making sure that only midrange is played . 
  when i started playing mtg had control , aggro , tempo , combo , midrange , prison , ld , ramp , burn ... now almost all those archetypes are gone , and it makes me sad somehow . 
  it 's like watching a great band of prog-rock starting to do pop songs because they sell more and are easier to consume for the public . 
  for a much better explanation saying the same check the time spiral review from the ` killingagoldfish ' blog . 
  neither is devoid .

  +1 : gain 1 life . 
  starting loyalty = 1, 
  a common planeswalker would n't have abilities that would remove loyalty as it would lead to feel-bads in new players when they lose their pw . 
  it also should n't have any kind of ability that would lead to complex decision making for it not to confuse new players . 
  but as long as the damage redirection rule exists , a rule that new players often do n't know about , they ca n't print pw at common rarity . 
  and let 's not forget that pw are mainly to sell packs , they would lose their novelty and appeal if they were common . 
  the number of cards in your cube is very high and the power level is also very high , but at the same time there are cards that just too weak . 
  [ [ archetype of courage ] ] could be an example , but there are more . 
  i 'm also counting too few cards that care about enchantments for a list made of 720 cards :, 
  [ [ sigil of the empty throne ] ] , [ [ sphere of resistance ] ] , [ [ starfield of nyx ] ] , [ [ enlightend tutor ] ] , [ [ academy reactor ] ] , [ [ eidolon of blossoms ] ] , [ [ yavimaya enchantress ] ] , [ [ herald of the pantheon ] ] , [ [ argothian enchatress ] ] , [ [ sterling groove ] ] and i do n't see more of them . 
  the density is too low , and honestly , there are too many powerful cards in the cube , some of them even too powerful . 
  cards like [ [ viscera seer ] ] , [ [ nim deathmantle ] ] or [ [ sprouting thrinax ] ] should never belong to the same cube as [ [ wurmcoil engine ] ] or [ [ library of alexandria ] ] . 
  most of the decks in this cube would end as good-stuff midrange with some explosive and broken starts , but very little them in between . 
  the colors look balanced , although red seems too one-dimensional ( but i think that this is wizards 's fault ) . 
  green looks as a ramp color , but most of the mana ramping other than mana dorks are mana rocks ; if other players take the rocks the green player might find some difficulties to get to the high costs . 
  my first advice is to trim the most powerful cards in the cube that can win the game on the spot with no effort , specially the colorless ones . 
  once the cube has a more flat power level and has less cards , the archetypes in there could look more interesting to the drafter . 
  fun cube . 
  did a living death deck ( not very good ) . 
  if you wan na try mine , go to, 
  nice cube . 
  from a draft i 've made , trying some reanimator build ,, 
  here 's my impression :, 
  the power level is right on where i like it , not too weak , and not full of `` oops i win the game cards '' . 
  i tried drafting some reanimator deck , but it was hard as almost i did n't saw any looters , self-mill or cards with discard as a cost . 
  i think that your cards are on average too expensive . 
  you should try to lower the average cmc as i think that most people will find that they will have too many cards with cmc from 4 to 7 in their sideboards after drafting . 
  if you want to draft my cube , where i do n't follow my own advices :d , try here :, 
  a cube with so many graveyard resources forced me to draft a golgari midrange build :, 
  i expected more reanimator effects , as [ [ victimize ] ] was the only one i saw in the whole draft , but they are premium in this cube . 
  it 's a shame that the [ [ spider spawning ] ] i saw did n't wheel . 
  i remember when i used to play around specific cards in arena or even draft expecting seeing an specific card . 
  now i only expect my mage opponent to have a single flamestrike , the rest are random creatures without any sinergy . 
  they should really let player choose sets in arena or remove old sets from it . 
  another reason hs is more played is because its competitive standard decks do n't cost ~ 800 $ . 
  do n't forget how expensive mtg has become in the last years . 
  1cmc mana dorks are gone , so are good red burn spells . 
  rampart growth is too cheap , reanimation spells must cost at least 5 . 
  cheap board wipes for red are a thing of the past and countermagic is something that can only be attached to creatures . 
  at the same time we are seeing creatures that can rivalize tarmogoyf and baneslayer angel and `` mistakes '' like the eldrazi and coco that are the only cards that can do the jump into modern . 
  will this ever change or do you feel that you must compete in simplicity with hearthstone ? 
  speaking about unhinged , depending on how experienced your group is on mtg , [ [ a blast from the past ] ] should belong to the cube . 
  the 5 w is also a cute funny card and [ [ topsy turvy ] ] can be a odd and funny [ [ time walk ] ] variant with the chance of becoming part of a game winning combo . 
  [ [ booster tutor ] ] is well costed and interesting to resolve ( you can make a booster from non used cube cards ) . 
  [ [ staying power ] ] can become a good build around . 
  and do n't forget [ [ cheatyface ] ] but make sure that your opponents do . 
  i think that the gotcha cards should n't be in any cube . 
  they force players to be silent as it is the best way against them and having silent players is definitely what you do n't want . 
  started trying to do ninjutsu and then the cards dried but some small sacrifice deck emerged ( pun intended ) . 
  it 's a cube slow enough to have morph cards play a good role , but i still do n't think that morph is a good mechanic as it feels too slow most of the time . 
  why does n't have black and green almost any instant effects ? 
  i love pump spells ( specially when they are used as a counterspell for removal ) but the only way that a green deck can do that is by telegraphing a morph that most of the time cost 3 to play and 5 to flip . 
  and yet red is full of shock effects that prey on morphs . 
  it feels unfair . 
  edit : ur looks lovely , maybe too much as they said : http://www.cubetutor.com/cubedeck/583860, 
  a way to play with the counters could be changing the p/t from 3/2 to 3/4 and the counters from implication to -1 / -1 . 
  some nice synergy with +1 / +1 counters would appear although some flavor would be lost . 
  that 's even better . 
  i 'll paste the comments on cubetutor from my deck . 
  saw a [ [ moment 's peace ] ] and immediately wanted to make a deck full of wraths and value plays in gw . 
  i did n't realize that i was drafting a peasant cube . 
  passing [ [ kitchen finks ] ] due to a misclick was painful . 
  so an odd abzan midrange slow deck was salvaged . 
  my cubetutor link is on my flair . 
  edit : a lot of things changed . 
  [ [ despise ] ] , a much better card in limited , has never wrecked any limited format and it has been uncommon twice . 
  the only reason this card is rare is because wizards wants mtg to be seen as an investment . 
  that 's a beautiful way of saying that it was printed at a time when constructed playability-rarity was not a completely linear function . 
  you would have to make your whole cube around auras and equipments for sigarda blessing to be playable . 
  one way to do it without transforming the cube would be to swap your sorcery-instant removal to auras . 
  then the blessing would say : `` removal spells in your hand have flash '' . 
  but then bounce and sacrifice effects would become very , very good . 
  your cube would be very different compared to a normal cube , and that could be quite original , but would your drafters want to play that ? 
  it 's an odd thinking , but i 'd cube grenzo if if did n't have the goad ability . 
  drafted mono-red aggro , with a little bit of artifact reanimation . 
  i got the combo of sword-foundry but the mana base could n't support it , i think . 
  it 's my first time drafting a cube where ~ 70 % of the cards are pickable , so it was rather hard , but fun and refreshing . 
  the link for my way more generic cube is on my flair, 
  i 've found that with 2 , 3 or even 4 players this works very well :, 
  choose a color ( it can change every time you play ) and remove all the spells and dual lands with that color from the cube , before making the packs for the draft . 
  it 's up to you if you want to keep or not phyrexian mana cards , hybrid cards or flashback cards like lingering souls . 
  the decks will be more consistant , you 'll have both more playables and it 'll be less likely than you are not sharing any color . 
  doing this makes sealed also better . 
  i tried a failed grixis ramp-reanimator shell because i 'm not very good at drafting cubes not focused on midrange decks . 
  i 'm not a big fan of the mtgo legacy cube design , because of the big range of power level , but drafting your cube i 've missed greatly fixing that comes into play untapped . 
  imo , those 100 $ dollars would be very well spent in shocklands , painlands or checklands . 
  drafted this mix of artifacts and tokens , with a p1p1 skullclamp and p1p2 true-name nemesis . 
  it was almost forced .
