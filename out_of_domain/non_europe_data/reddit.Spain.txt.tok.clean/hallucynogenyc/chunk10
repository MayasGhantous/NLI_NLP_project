   so , since ~ ~ murders ~ ~ innocent people are murdered around the world each day , you would n't be surprised if i were to argue that ~ ~ murdering ~ ~ innocents being killed is okay ? 
  we 're not arguing the utility of your recommendation . 
  i 'm saying it 's condescending . 
  you ca n't use that logic when everyone breathes air but only muslim extremists go around killing people over drawings . 
  3 % of the world males are estimated to be sociopaths . 
  sociopathy is n't something that needs treatment or can be cured . 
  link ? 
  also , as i 've asked before ( yes , i 'll mention it every time you ignore certain question and then give the original answer again somewhere else , which you seem to do way too often in this thread ) , even if that were true how does it change anything ? 
  you 're just witch hunting now . 
  wait , the goal of prison is to punish people not to reform them in singapore ? 
  are you ok with that too ? 
  if you do n't know then you should n't comment on it . 
  all world countries refer to prisons as `` reformative centres '' in one way or another . 
  if he 's retained inside and he ca n't opt out it 's prison by definition regardless of what your legal framework wants to call it . 
  how do you know what would have happened ? 
  since you brought up the nazis first in this thread , let me say the argument that `` we had to do something about it or it would have ended with us '' is not precisely unheard of when trying to justify the means used for an end . 
  he refused to meet the officer because he was being charged with bullshit . 
  you should n't have to defend yourself vs bullshit . 
  not according to him !, 
  you would have just admitted guilt of a criminal charge to some probation officer and everything would have been fine !, 
  you said you believe in exceptions with human rights ( free speech in this case ) have to be made when it 's for the greater good . 
  you said exactly that . 
   if we are n't like the us then we must be bad . 
  but you are . 
  i ca n't even remember mentioning the us . 
  when did i ever claim to know more about his country than he does ? 
  quote me saying or implying that please . 
  how did you turn this conversation around from telling me to go learn about it to giving me humility lessons ? 
   exceptions in free speech with regard to social stability are very different from executing homosexuals ** with regard to social stability ** . 
  ftfy since that 's what i said . 
  now , how are they different aside from the magnitude of the punishment ? 
  is it that one concerns you and the other one does n't ? 
  does that somehow relate to the saying i quoted above ? 
  pd : i 'd be really great if you stopped cherry picking what questions you answer to . 
  again , when did i mention the us ? 
  because it 's word by word the same argument : ** it offends people and people have a right to not be offended ** . 
  bringing up charlie hebdo is just a means to show why this logic is dangerous and not valid . 
  so you 'll always believe whatever data your own goverment provides over indexes the rest of the world trusts to be accurate that imply your goverment is bullshitting you ? 
  am i by any chance talking to a member of this party ? 
  that would explain a whole lot . 
  no it was n't . 
  you brought it up in your first comment in this thread , did n't you ? 
  why do you need to lie so much ? 
  you 've repeatedly accused him of having mental problems and needing reformation ( sorry , prison ) all based on this post on which the guy supposedly tricks his father into beating him in an evil way and feels proud about it . 
  i just read it :, 
   and the abusiveness of my father , probably affected me in some ways . 
  during my childhood , my father would viciously berate me whenever he was upset with me ... and though i never saw it , i heard that my mother was slapped by him several times ... he did violently pin me down onto a bed when he admonished me for my chinese new year video a few years ago, 
  so he truly was abused or so he claims . 
  let 's see what this evil sociopath did :, 
   but , the exact moment that i would i want to talk about that i feel is most indicative of his abusiveness , is the incident that happened just a few hours before my first time in court . 
  i expressed refusal to do so , and thus commenced my father 's violent behaviour ... clenching one 's fist and pulling it back , threatening a punch on my face , if i did not comply . 
  ... my mother screamed , pleaded , and desperately attempted to pull me away ... 
  i refused to comply , and so went out of the toilet and told him : `` it 's either i 'm going to wear the black shirt , otherwise , i 'm going to wear pyjamas . '' he , with uncontrollable , savage anger , held my shirt again and incessantly pushed my body repeatedly on the doors of my cupboard as my mother resumed her fruitless screaming . 
  ** however , he , supposedly wondering why after all these years i had actually resumed a provocation even after threats of violence ... slowly released his grip and said something along the lines of , `` you know that if i hit you , and there is mark . . and then there are reporters out there ... . ' and of course , i grinned , and then responded , `` ahh . . 
  i see you have found out my plan '' . 
  did we read the same thing ? 
  please tell me we did n't . 
   this was the 1st ever instance in my life where i had overcome the threats of violence from my father , when i had not acceded to his demands , but he had to accede to mine . 
  there was a sense of victory, 
  so this is the famous `` he even is proud about it '' you talk so much about ? 
  who the hell are you working for ? 
  look at [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/3ak2lo/teen_atheist_facing_three_years_in_prison_for/csdmr9x?context=1 ), 
  see , you keep rephrasing it so that it sounds the way you want it to sound . 
  why do you put the `` exception '' word only on the side that is convenient for you ? 
  i said exception too . 
  why ca n't you just quote what i actually wrote like i 've been doing to you all day long ? 
  can you tell me why is it different instead of changing the sentence then commenting on it ? 
  sadly it 's not our business to help countries but to try to stick to the facts . 
  [ which you obviously do n't . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/3ak2lo/teen_atheist_facing_three_years_in_prison_for/csdmr9x?context=1 ), 
  [ well , you just tried to destroy a kid 's persona based on nothing ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/3ak2lo/teen_atheist_facing_three_years_in_prison_for/csdmr9x?context=1 ), 
  your lack of reply to such explicit accusation speaks by itself . 
  check out silicone sheeting , it can do wonders for people like you , even if it 's an old scar !, 
  fixed , thanks !, 
  well , define `` go away '' it varies from person to person and from scar to scar , but check [ these before & after examples ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=silicone+sheets+keloid+before+after&amp;tbm=isch ) i 'm using them at the moment to heal from some very nasty scars on my face ( check my submission history to r/wtf ) and they seem to be working great !, 
  after doing some research i recommend scaraway and dermatrix . 
  both available on amazon . 
  also , i do n't think you can get cosmetical surgery for 100 $ , probably not even for 1000 $ . 
  buy me a beer if you try it and it works and we 're even , 
  yep , it 's catalan , not italian , 
  i 'm a catalan . 
  what they are n't telling you is the mother works in homeophaty . 
  tricked my ass . 
  it 's funny how humans work . 
  mongols would kill a whole group of soldiers if any of them ran away and stuff like that . 
  it worked wonders !, 
  hey , thanks for the advice . 
  why do i need to fix the bite before everything else ? 
  also , what about the front teeth size ? 
  thanks !, 
  makes sense . 
  however , if later on they still look too big , would n't reducing their size force a third round of braces ? 
  sorry if it 's a stupid question , 
  thanks a ton for all the advise . 
  it 's the first time i feel i 'm talking to someone who both knows what he 's talking about and not trying to screw me over for the money . 
  how much should i be looking at for the braces , and , are these `` fast braces '' any good ? 
  i 'm looking at different clinics and they all seem to push for different solutions that are all supposed to be the `` best '' :p, 
  understood . 
  thanks again !,
