  he ended up agreeing to fixing it , and an hour ago i got my permanent crown fit . 
  he told the assistant : `` let 's but the bonding right away '' . 
  he put the permanent crown and after applying that blue light , asks me how it feels . 
  now , i ca n't bite properly at all , the crown makes contact before the rest of the teeth do and if i move my teeth backwards/forwards it 's like there 's a mountain in there . 
  he says it 's normal , and that i need to chew a lot on it for the next couple months and it will eventually fit itself . 
  i 've been struggling for the last hour to find any reference online that this is normal or acceptable without any success and at this point i feel like just switching dentists and never go back . 
  opinions , please ? 
  thanks . 
  i own the hubsan x4 and the v977 3d helicopter . 
  i know these are toy grade but considering i can handle inverted flight with the heli i would n't consider myself an rc beginner either . 
  i wanted to get into fpv and i 'm very tempted to just get the eachine racer on banggood which from what i can see , is by far the most cost effective way to get into the hobby . 
  this being said , i 'm afraid i 'll outgrow it too quickly and i 'd rather spend more and get something that will satisfy me for a long time while still on the cheap side of things . 
  ideally , i want a setup with goggles rather than a screen ( hk quanum ? ), 
  and 4s . 
  on top of that , if it 's diy then all the better since i can slowly upgrade over time . 
  any suggestions ? 
  thanks in advance !, 
  bought the miband from gearbest 4 months ago , it never arrived and gearbest forced me to wait until now to get a refund . 
  i was about to place the same order somewhere else when i realised something better might have been released in the meantime or about to come . 
  so ... is it still worth buying today ? 
  if so , is the heart rate version worth it if price is n't a problem ? 
  thanks !,

  i realise this is as controversial as it gets , but i thought some people may appreciate the external point of view , as i think there are some interesting parallels to be made , and i am on the opposite side when it comes to brexit . 
  i do n't intent to change anyone 's mind on any of the issues i 'll talk about , but rather shed some light into the opposite camp state of mind . 
  or maybe i have this rant inside me and i need to take it out , 
  a little background : secessionism in catalonia has been on the rise for the last last decades , but specially the last 10 years . 
  it 's hard to pinpoint the exact reasons this happened and i could write a wall on my personal motives , but it 's safe to say you can boil it down to a combination of these arguments that can take both unreasonable and reasonable shapes : feel free to skip this 5 point list if you 're not interested in the details . 
  sovereignty : nations are the true sovereign entity that shall never be dominated by any other nation . 
  this ranges from the classic `` spaniards are idiots we are the best '' racism to `` a plurinational state ca n't work when one nation is a huge majority , as this one will always put itself as the priority , creating a relationship that resembles parasitism rather than a symbiosis '', 
  economy : catalonia would do better economically outside of spain . 
  from `` catalan euros should stay in catalonia '' to `` the economy in catalonia and spain is so radically different having the same policies makes no sense '', 
  immigration : under franco 's rule , massive amounts of spaniards , specially from the poorer south , were sent to catalonia to work . 
  while a lot of them integrated ( i 'm the descendant of one ) , a lot of them created whole towns where they pretend they 're not in catalonia and some of them even demand their sons not be taught catalan . 
  politics : if you look at an electoral map of spain for any of the recent elections , the parties that win in spain are minorities in catalonia . 
  this , by proxy , means that catalonia is always ruled by parties that catalonia never elected who implement nation-wide policies that we do n't necessarily agree with . 
  democracy culture : pp , the party that rules in spain is the political son of franco , and founded by his ministers . 
  franco was n't defeated , franco died , but not his supporters . 
  still nowadays , there is a feeling in catalonia that spain 's democracy is n't precisely ideal : the highest court , the constitutional court , is made of 12 judges directly appointed by whichever party is in power . 
  catalonia has still not been allowed to vote and catalonia 's president at the time that the famous `` informal non-binding consultive poll '' was made is now being prosecuted for that . 
  4 days before the election last week , telephone conversations were leaked that showed how the government had been conspiring to fabricate corruption cases against catalan secessionist politicians . 
  nobody resigned and in fact , pp increased in votes 10 % . 
  as per the unionist side , i do n't feel the need to explain nearly as much as i 'm sure you can all relate : we feel spanish / the instability unleashed by a breakup could wreck the economy in the short term / we would get kicked out of europe . 
  my point here is that there are good arguments on both sides and that in the end , only each individual can balance the pros and cons for himself . 
  a lot of people are willing to accept an economic recession in the short term if this is going to make for a better long term prospect . 
  a lot of people are not . 
  and so on . 
  i 've put the pros and cons for both brexit and catalonia 's independence and come to the conclusion that i 'm in favour of independence , but against brexit ( main reason being , i feel while on the same arguments , when applied to the uk the case is much , much weaker ) . 
  this does n't mean i ca n't be sure the uk will be worse off in the long term . 
  it might be better , i do n't know . 
  ** what i do know , is how to not address the brexiters about it , because what i 'm seeing right now is a reflection of the last 5 years in catalonia : **, 
  ** do not tell them they have divided the country by asking for a referendum . 
  ** the country was already divided , just nobody talked about it . 
  exposing a problem and creating a problem are very different things . 
  imagine the queen saying that she abolishes democracy because it divides the country on every election . 
  that 's how silly the argument sounds from their perspective . 
  it is true that the campaign led by certain people had lies and whatnot , but ultimately brexit as a political option is n't responsible for that . 
  ** do not point out the pound falling or that ftse250 is in red . 
  ** anyone who voted for brexit clearly thinks to be playing the long term game . 
  it makes you sound short sighted and they 'll dismiss anything you say afterwards , as in their eyes , you 're chasing different priorities . 
  ** do not point at statements from eu officials or other governments or even financial experts ** . 
  these are , again , people with different priorities . 
  financial experts care about short term gains , and other countries care about ... other countries . 
  the best example i can think of is the current eu trade deal situation . 
  of course before the vote they would have said they would build a wall between the uk and the eu to stop any trade . 
  this is to influence the vote , anyone understands it 's not actually in their best interest and that afterwards they 'll try to make the best out of the situation . 
  it 's called game theory !, 
  even today , the statements they are making are trying to influence the uk 's government decisions more than anything else . 
  does anyone think the actual negotiation will happen in newspapers headlines ? 
  ** do not point at the leave campaign politicians as if they had elected them ** . 
  even in actual elections people are supposed to vote on policies , not on people . 
  grove , farage , boris etc are just random people who the media converted into the public faces of the movement . 
  in reality , most people voting for leave could n't care less who they are . 
  they voted in a referendum , not an election . 
  ** most importantly , do not call them idiots , racists etc ** . 
  while any of the individuals may very well be anything , to assume you know what they think is pure bigotry . 
  if something , that is what 's actually dividing the country . 
  hope this will be useful to somebody . 
  i was building my portfolio and it 's the only one i ca n't find out of 10 similar funds . 
  if not available , is there a similar tool you can recommend ?

  a friend and i planned a trip around scandinavia , with 3 days in stockholm for which we rented this airbnb room :, 
  we opted for airbnb instead of a cheaper hostel because we wanted to experience the city living with a local , being able to use their appliances ( e.g. 
  access to washing machine , a real kitchen , etc. ) . 
  the host sent a very copy-pasted message giving general instructions , then said he could n't be there for the check-in . 
  when we got to the house , we realise this is not where he lives , merely an apartment he has repurposed for airbnb ( living room is a bedroom ) and everyone staying in the apartment are also airbnb guests , effectively turning the apartment into a hostel but without a manager : the kitchen is lacking all the basic things ( not even kitchen paper ) , there is no washing machine , pans are dirty from other guests , the `` private balcony '' is split between two rooms that have access to it with a cheap old plastic curtain ... 
  is this normal ? 
  if it is , how do i avoid these in the future ? 
  is a bad review justified ? 
  tl ; dr : used airbnba to get the living with a local experience , got a subpar hostel , am mad . 
  hi guys sorry for the long post , 
  i 've always had an interest in photography and been the one teaching friends buying dslrs the basics on how to use manual control but could never afford one . 
  lately i have the budget but given how i 've been enjoying photography using my nexus 6p ( instagram bluehallu ) i thought i really did n't need more . 
  this all changed this week when i went on a trip to norway with a friend who brought a very modest fuji xq1 . 
  i thought inside from the very beginning he wasted his money on such a cheap compact already having a 6p like mine , but it became obvious that he consistently was getting better shots than me whenever the light was n't great . 
  this feeling culminated when we went to see the northern lights and i could n't even get them to appear on my phone ( yes , i should have known ) while he was getting not so great but decent shots after i taught him how to use the manual mode and long exposure times . 
  at that very moment i decided i 'd buy a camera as soon as i got back . 
  i want something i can take with me for travelling , and being a minimalist packer the idea of a bulky dslr with two basic objectives freaks me out , so i immediately turned to large sensor compact cameras , namely the rx100m3 and the tz100 . 
  i was almost ready to make the purchase on the tz100 for its 10x zoom when i saw this video on youtube :, 
  correct me if i 'm wrong , but the difference between the tz60 and tz100 , is almost unnoticeable and it 's twice the price and has 1/3 the zoom .
