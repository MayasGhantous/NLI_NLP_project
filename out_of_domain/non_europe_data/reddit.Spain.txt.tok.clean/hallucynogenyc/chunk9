  this is the same argument muslim extremists use to justify the charlie hebdo attacks . 
  ** there is no such thing as the right to not be offended ** . 
   i 'm saying they should not be slandering or crossing certain ob markers, 
  and again , the same argument extremist muslims use to defend the charlie hebdo attacks . 
   doing these things helps no one in opening up discourse . 
  and who are you to judge that ? 
  freedom of speech is supposed to be guaranteed precisely because no one , not even a 99.9 % majority should ever be able to shut up anyone . 
  if people does n't like what he says they should just not listen to him . 
   my analysis is that he did all that because he wanted to be jailed . 
  when he realised he would n't be , he escalated his actions . 
  even if that was the case ( which you have n't provided any meaningful evidence of ) , forcing the state to jail you by doing things that are illegal on purpose to show how ridiculous the law is is a totally legit form of protest . 
  ** edit : please people read [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/3ak2lo/teen_atheist_facing_three_years_in_prison_for/csdmr9x?context=1 ) before you take dsruix seriously : **, 
  so you 're defending that your country is putting a kid in prison because religious neighbouring countries blackmail you that if you do n't they 'll take action ? 
  even if singapore 's national security was genuinely threatened by this kid , the correct way to go about it would be to secretly pay him off , not put him in prison . 
  he 's a freaking kid for god 's sake . 
   now , freedom of speech always has its limits . 
  in europe saying that the holocaust is a hoax is punishable . 
  i genuinely ca n't believe i 'm reading this . 
   ** there is no such thing as any right to anything ** , either you are completely on your own in the world ( which is unlikely ) or you are allowed to do things by some governing body . 
  holy shit . 
  rights are concepts not pieces of paper . 
  they exist when people believe in them and they cease to exist when people ( not looking at anyone / s ) do n't . 
  people have died and keep dying all around the world to preserve basic human rights , and ** someone justifying putting a kid in prison to allegedly protect the country is an insult to all of them ** . 
  most crimes against humanity are done in the name of self-defense and it still does n't make it right . 
  everything you 've said so far in this thread has eliminated any possible doubts i had about two things :, 
  1 ) that it 's not a kid committing a severe crime ( the only thing that justifies incarcerating a kid ) but a society moral values being utterly fucked up . 
  2 ) i 'm never stepping into singapore given that the comments i made here could send me to prison . 
  so some unproven stuff that some kid wrote in a blog about an allegedly abusive father justifies sending him to prison now ? 
  where and when did that trial happen ? 
  i ca n't believe you 're comparing the two . 
  denying the holocaust is assumed to be a means of supporting the nazi regime and ideology given the fact that you can go to auschwitz and see it for yourself . 
  that 's why it 's forbidden . 
  this guy is not calling for anything illegal/dangerous himself . 
  the fact that some other people are saying his totally should-be-legal/non-violent speech will make them kill people is the problem not him . 
  probatory requirements put in place for his speech , right ? 
  was n't the requirement precisely to retract from what he said ? 
  also , reformative training you ca n't opt-out from and that denies you freedom of movement is prison regardless of what you guys want to call it . 
  i 'm actually quite sure `` prison '' in several eu countries is less harsh than whatever it is they 're forcing him to go through . 
  i 'm not arguing his imprisonment has n't followed singapore 's law , and i 'd like you to point out anywhere where i have implied such thing . 
  ** i 'm saying those laws that were followed are fucked up ** . 
  imagine you go to a country and you ca n't wear pants because some religion in there finds it offensive . 
  you are arrested for wearing them and asked to admit you intentionally incited for conflict . 
  when you do n't , you 're given even a harsher punishment for not admitting it . 
  this is what all authoritarian regimes do : build a legal case on ridiculous laws and then publicly state that they are following the law ( law they might have written a week ago themselves ) . 
  the fact that something is illegal does n't make it wrong , and the fact that something is legal does n't make it right , as history has taught us way too many times already . 
  human rights were designed precisely to avoid this sort of loopholes on what the world has decided is the bare minimum of dignity which ca n't possibly be argued against no matter what laws you make , or you 'll be prosecuted internationally for crimes against humanity ( i wish we all took the last part seriously ) . 
  you do n't seem to recognise that the human rights themselves are international laws that take precedence over any other law ( oversimplifying , i know ) . 
  if you do n't recognise them , then of course you can argue anything about morality and be able to justify it . 
  a government that puts those laws in place is authoritarian . 
  the part were they are enforced does n't matter . 
  i 've already told you , if it *** truly *** is a security problem , go , tell him that and deal with him morally . 
  again , prison is unjustifiable . 
  that said , i think the security problem is as genuine as the us using drones for self-defense on the other side of the globe . 
  yes there is a threat but the means used to defend from it are way out of proportion . 
   the nazi regime is dangerous, 
  i feel you have n't understood my previous point about that comparison : no one would ever be incarcerated in europe if they spoke against nazism no matter how many nazi countries were around it . 
  how are my comments any different from his comments ? 
  i 'm not surprised that the world ends up working like this . 
  i 'm surprised there are people who actually support the world behaving like this . 
  you seem to keep coming back to points i already replied to . 
  again , the fact that your legal system does n't call it prison does n't make it any less of a prison if the guy ca n't opt-out and he is going to have his freedom of movement denied . 
  then you 're surely going to be okay with it if those other countries force your country to punish homosexuality by death because some book says so or otherwise there 'll be consequences . 
  right ? 
  there 's a saying that goes :, 
  when they killed my neighbours i did n't help because i did n't know them . 
  when they killed my friends i did n't help because they would have killed me . 
  when they killed my family i did n't kill them because i alone would n't have be able to stop them . 
  when they came for me , i was killed because there was no one else left to help . 
  i 'm perfectly aware of how crazy the countries around singapore are , that does n't mean i believe a kid video on the internet is going to trigger anything . 
  also to be honest , having studied singapore in college should n't make you feel you have more knowledge about it than the average internet user . 
   you keep saying he was imprisoned for what he said . 
  that is n't true . 
  he was charged for what he said , he was going to get probation for being found guilty . 
  i do n't know how to explain you it does n't matter what legal procedures you 're using , he should have never been found guilty of anything in the first place . 
  ** this is my one and only argument . 
  ** i apologise if i led you to believe anything else , but please stop telling me he broke the law already . 
   his recommended sentencing to a facility, 
  i 've asked you to tell me what the differences between those facilities and prison are 3 times already . 
  you conveniently ignore me every time i ask it and i suspect it 's not going to be any different this time . 
  i wonder why . 
  so , since murders are committed around the world each day , you would n't be surprised if i were to argue that murdering is okay ? 
   one has a moral responsibility to disobey unjust laws . 
  - martin luther king, 
   an individual who breaks a law that conscience tells him is unjust , and who willingly accepts the penalty of imprisonment in order to arouse the conscience of the community over its injustice , is in reality expressing the highest respect for the law, 
  - martin luther king, 
   an unjust law is itself a species of violence . 
  arrest for its breach is more so . 
  now the law of nonviolence says that violence should be resisted not by counter-violence but by nonviolence . 
  this i do by breaking the law and by peacefully submitting to arrest and imprisonment . 
  our whole legal framework was built on individuals exercising civil disobedience , 
  so you go and tell people to learn about the subject and come back to you whenever your knowledge on it is in any way above the internet 's average ? 
  thank god we have a native here making this argument . 
  so tired of being told we just do n't understand the situation there . 
  *** edit : please see [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/3ak2lo/teen_atheist_facing_three_years_in_prison_for/csdmr9x?context=1 ) ***, 
  so , there is a single party by people 's will , freedom of speech restriction is totally justifiable and all these international reports are just biased and ignorant . 
  i would have never guessed people like you existed outside of north korea . 
  i mean , this is the country we 're dealing with here :, 
  there is a difference between hate speech and `` it 's bullshit '' speech . 
  how can you even start arguing what he was doing was hate speech towards a group ? 
  let me rephrase .
