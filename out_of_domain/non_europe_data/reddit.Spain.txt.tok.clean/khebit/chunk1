it 's a matter of time i guess , in the beginning i could do nothing more than huge explosions while trying to take off  ( which does n't imply i am able of much more now , though ), 
  deadly reentry , and some kerbals dying to show how difficult but interesting space travels are and to keep them entertained , for example . 
  you take off as usual , and then you have to set your orbit at 2868.75 km away from kerbin, 
  definitely want . 
  this has to be epic for screenshots of planets alignment ( imagine something like mun , minmus , kerbin , kerbol and a space station at the same time ! ), 
  i use right now home , kw rocketry and mechjeb , as well as some parts from other mods . 
  recommendation : download 2 copies of the game ( or copy/paste into another folder ) , add every single mod to the second one , and `` choose '' what you think is useful to avoid full ram usage, 
  actually there 's just one part ( at control window ), 
  if there 's air , easy solution : parachutes . 
  a damn lot of them . 
  actually you just ca n't use parachutes for mun as there is no atmosphere there to drag, 
  i would like to know what 's the big yellow building in the last pic with the ramp that looks like a house . 
  is it a part of home ? 
  which one ? 
  oh , it has space for kerbals too ? 
  i never use it for just one reason : there is no atmosphere on mun/minmus to profit from atmospheric miner :(, 
  although it is not induction , i think it is easier to consider the analysis you did . 
  - if n | 3 , then n ( n +1 ) ( 2n +1 ) | 3, 
  - otherwise , let n = 3k +2 , then ( n +1 ) = 3k +2 +1 = 3 ( k +1 ) | 3 , so n ( n +1 ) ( 2n +1 ) | 3 . 
  - or else , let n = 3k +1 , then ( 2n +1 ) = 6k +2 +1 = 3 ( 2k +1 ) | 3 , so n ( n +1 ) ( 2n +1 ) | 3, 
  it indeed uses no induction , but i just think the analysis to check whether the number is or is not divisible by 3 can be applied without using induction at any point, 
  why ? 
  any number can only be as far as 2 units from a multiple of 3 , as if you added another unit the number would be a multiple of 3 itself . 
  or just , a number can not be congruent with something bigger or equal than 3 mod 3 . 
  is n't it easier taking x to be the central one ? 
  you get ( x-1 ) ^ 2 + x ^ 2 + ( x +1 ) ^ 2 , so terms cancel easily . 
  expanding easily gives the asked 3n-1 form ( or 3n +2 , which is equivalent ), 
  the limit is actually asking you for the derivative of the funcion ( square root of x ) . 
  the derivatives are pretty simple if you know how to differentiate powers and exponentials , considering 1/t = t ^ -1, 
  it might be useful for you to know that the limit when n goes to infinity of ( 1 +1 / n ) ^ n = e, 
  say the number is less than 3 . 
  then both ( x-3 ) and ( x-7 ) are negative , so - * - = + , and the equation will be positive . 
  this also works for numbers bigger than 7 as both factors will be positive . 
  if x is between 3 and 7 , then ( x-3 ) is positive but ( x-7 ) is negative , so + * - = + and the equation will now be negative . 
  so , the equation will be positive for all x outside the interval ( 3 , 7 ) , and 0 at 3 and 7 . 
  i guess the question actually asks you to check when the inequality holds ( for which values of x ), 
  i do exactly the opposite : i start half throttle , at about 100 m/s , to avoid drag from affecting too much , and when i 'm out of the atmosphere i go full throttle . 
  i would say r = 0.8 and it is a sum of a geometric series, 
  just an equations system , with ax ^ 2 + bx + c = 0 . 
  you are given 3 different sets of data , plug them into the equation and solve the system in whathever way you want, 
  ( 3/2 ) ^ x = 3/2 , if you multiply both sides by 3/2, 
  i 'd say that 's not ceva , but menelao , although i guess it can be proven from ceva 's theorem if it asks you to do so, 
  mandatory question : what 's the name of the mods of the second vessel ? 
  for the transformations , my usual suggestion if you do n't really get it is : take f ( x ) = x ^ ( 2 ) , give values/modify the function and see what happens . 
  for absolute values i guess you have to understand how it works, 
  it is indeed , or that 's what i get from calculations, 
  please record it and post it here, 
  i would say yes . 
  10 cards , 10 days of offers , today 's top offer ( bioshock infinite ) has a card ... let 's hope ksp will get a nice offer , 
  as a guy from seville , i would recommend at least two days in seville , but i understand that 's not possible , so i think your planning is great . 
  for seville , visit the cathedral , the alcazares and the city centre in general , as well as the zone of the river ; i guess the weather will be fine in october ( still quite hot though ) . 
  cordoba is also a very interesting city . 
  if you are ever interested in returning to the south of spain , i would suggest you to come in abril to seville , cadiz , cordoba and granada , they 're all really beautiful . 
  and keep posting questions if you have any , someone will surely happily answer , 
  i 've received two out of two ksp cards , one of them foil . 
  lucky me , 
  it is indeed impossible to integrate if you have an asymptote as it would yield an infinite area underneath . 
  otherwise , in w | a we trust : https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=integrate+%281+%2b+cos2x%29%2f%281+-+cos2x%29+from+-pi%2f4+to+pi%2f4 ( nonintegrable expansion term ... ), 
  kerbal space program . 
  3 words . 
  hl3 confirmed, 
  there is no hope for this country . 
  because even if rajoy 's government falls , pp will still get most of votes in election , plus they control congress, 
  kerbal space program is now # 1 in sales in the whole steam shop . 
  they say that part of the track was n't automated as you are already going sow and you are about to enter a station , so manual contro is better to change tracks and that stuff . 
  still , i 'm kinda sure there was some technical device that failed there, 
  i still have no idea what the name of the headset at pear store means , just leaving that here ... 
  the same picture than my mousepad :d, 
  i vote for shank 2 ( or just shank ) , because why not . 
  i do n't know either how to fill the chart . 
  however it is straightforward to prove both triangles are congruent , because if < c = < f then sin < c = sin < f ( same for cos ) . 
  as you have sin < c = cb/ac , sin < f = fe/df , and , ac = kdf , it 's trivial to sea they 're the same triangles ( well , congruent ) . 
  also , i always learnt as a `` fact '' ( meaning it can be used as a proof , and you do n't have to prove it every single time ) that triangles with the same angles are congruent, 
  by arithmetic based on parity : 5 times whatever = odd , 3 times whatever = odd , 7 = odd . 
  odd ( 5n ^ ( 2 ) ) + odd ( 3n ) = even ( i ) , even ( i ) + odd ( 7 ) = odd . 
  the exponential has an interesting property : its derivative is almost the same ( the same when you take base e ) . 
  this means the rate of change of the function is proportional to the value of the function itself , i.e. 
  the higher the population the faster it expands , the less particles you have the slowlier they decay , etc. 
  no , because then you would have a prime factor with a higher exponent than one of the number , thus not dividing it . 
  if one has 5 ^ ( 2 ) and the other 5 ^ ( 4 ) , if you set the gcd to have a factor of 5 ^ ( 4 ) you 'll find out that this gcd can not divide the first number ( 5 ^ ( 2 ) / 5 ^ ( 4 ) is n't an integer ), 
  i think it 's impossible to rule a country for 36 years without doing anything right . 
  and , well , he also had a lot of help from technocrats of the regime 's families , which are responsible for many actions the govt took, 
  the uprising was supported , mainly , by military , mainly the african officers , excluding the navy , that stayed loyal to the republic . 
  they had as well support from wealthy people , important land-owners in the south of spain . 
  there was also the help of the church that lead to many right-wing politicians shifting towards franco , with many followers ( however , out of the most important right-wing politicians , none of them really helped the nationalist side ) . 
  funny enough , they also had support from alfonsinos ( who wanted alfonso to be back as the king ) , and the carlistas ( who wanted a monarchy lead by the heirs of archduke charles of austria ) . 
  for popular front ... it 's hard to say , it got to a point where nobody really supported it . 
  the hechos de mayo reflect how leftists fought against each other . 
  you can , however , consider that pf was supported by socialists , communists ( pro-stalin , after the poum , which supported trotsky , `` disappeared '' ) , anarchists ( very important in spain ) . 
  you also had a lot of republican politicians , people from the world of culture and from universities , etc. 
  however , the first ones were the most important ones as they were really organized . 
  while most mid/low class supported the republic , there was a division in quite a lot of places , and whenever somewhere was conquered , everybody tried to be the most francoist one . 
  edit : what a tl ; dr i just wrote : / church & catholics , military , monarchists , land-owners vs. mid-to-low classes , republicans , left/far-left parties ( i.e. 
  communists ) . 
  and a miriad of families divided in the middle, 
   thing is nuke is more ct sided than d2 is t sided , so i 'd rank this as more of a comeback than that game, 
  they had 13 rounds , needed 3 . 
  they should indeed have gambled more , a push as ct is risky but they had enough advantage to risk, 
  more deathmatch , public servers , some mm ... 
  i 've played for 280 hours and i 'm still not too good , if she wants to improve she just has to throw hours to the game in dm and in mm to learn strats and to try out what she does in dm .
