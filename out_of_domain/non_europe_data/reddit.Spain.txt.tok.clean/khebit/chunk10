  i guess then he has confirmation that tywin is dead , everything is gon na get fucked up and he 'd be better off far away from westeros, 
  `` your family is dead , your friends are dead , you are lost in the middle of nothingness ... '', 
  `` but am i going to walk again ? '', 
  goes to the wall because he has nowhere to go - saves the night 's watch . 
  finds an army of angry men who want to cross the wall - takes them with him as an army . 
  * good luck stannis *, 
  are n't the rhoynar the guys who went to dorne and created the martells ? 
  any book reasons to claim that title ? 
  arya was given an iron coin from one of the faceless men of braavos , and was told that , whenever she needed , she could get in contact with her by showing the coin to someone from braavos . 
  she wanted to go to the north , but as she hears that the captain is from braavos , she realizes it might be a better idea to go there , so she shows the coin to the captain and he recognizes it . 
  he is even surprised and `` treats '' her really well . 
  this was lannister 's very own red wedding, 
  no please no damn you dices :(, 
  i 'd like a gif of bran being told `` you wo n't walk ... but you will fly '' and then littlefinger smiling in the background ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
   constantly fanboying over nip, 
  he has actually said several times that he 's a fan of virtus.pro, 
  friberg going full aimbot < 3, 
  one of the most underrated entry fraggers in my opinion , specially in banana . 
  when he has his day , he 's unstoppable, 
  `` my crosshair is on them but they are not dying ! '', 
  offer/demand . 
  most people were speculating and hoping to make a huge profit until they realized nobody is going to buy a skin for that price , so eventually it will go back to its standard price ( a little higher but not as it was right now ), 
  i do n't like it , with the bars you * know * where you are aiming at , and it wo n't block your vision if you are covering one of those 1-pixel angles, 
  cis-white-able bodied-\u00fcber privileged here . 
  to be honest i love to sit down and watch interracial porn while i insult the women and compare her to the devil , as she was satan 's reincarnation . 
  there 's nothing more satisfying than that , it 's the only reason i watch it ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  your verdict has to be based only on what you see . 
  maybe he hacked in other rounds , yes , but if he did n't while you were suspecting him , you ca n't mark him as cheater, 
  p90 is the answer man, 
  firstly , i do n't think you can speak for `` the community '' as a whole . 
  also , are you talking as an esport ? 
  then ,, 
  * low tick servers, 
  * bomb timer, 
  * buy time, 
  are no problem as they are played in different , custom servers . 
  smokes and footsteps are bugged , yes , and as bugs they will eventually be fixed . 
  it is not a matter of days . 
  wallbangs and movement - i believe they have to be changed but not to 1.6 values . 
  i do n't enjoy a match were you spend 1 minute wallbanging `` just because someone can be there '' . 
  i do n't really like it when they kill you through a wall 5 ft thick . 
  stopspeed should be changed , but the rest of the movement seems good to me . 
  again , just because 1.6 was different does n't mean it was better . 
  cz is a little broken at the moment , and i believe it will be nerfed . 
  however , deagle is fine as it is right now . 
  if you want a 800 $ ultra op awp , go back to source where every other gun was senseless . 
  here you have a gun that one-shots from pretty much any distance but has a high recoil . 
  i 'll say the favorite buzz-word : skill ceiling - watch skytten , friberg , pyth plays ; just because you are not god with it does n't mean it can be used to a godlike level , right ? 
  money and probably buying all rights of the maps, 
   add an opportunity to choose the maximum ping of your opponents in mm . 
  i 'm tired of all those assholes whose ping is 200-400 and who still hit everyone while they 're almost unhittable . 
  also , add a minimum one . 
  i dislike playing with 100 ping against people with 5 ping that kill you before you see them, 
   remove an opportunity to throw a bomb away to any inaccessible ( for one player ) places . 
  i mean , how an opportunity to throw a bomb , for example , on the high boxes can be useful for a t team in any way ? 
  now it 's used only by the idiots who think that it 's very funny to deprive his team of an opportunity to plant a bomb . 
  it 's not that simple , it would mean reworking tons of stupid spots in all the maps . 
  spots that , for example , would be useful to through weapons in other teams ' ecos to prevent them from reaching them ... 
  asian rat doto best asian doto, 
  using song of the siren + refresher to have your illusions hitting towers while everyone is asleep . 
  wait - so is it confirmed that it will shoot in alcazar of seville ? 
  yay !, 
  i live there !, 
  i hope i 'll be able to appear in a small corner in the series :d, 
  only the two tree spots as far as i know, 
  ned stark not accepting renly baratheon 's offer of men to keep joffrey and cersei under control as soon as robert died . 
  like , you support the mannis , right , but you are getting nowhere if you do n't act quickly and you are giving them time . 
  so was joffrey . 
  and i 'd prefer to dethrone ( one way or the other ) renly than having to face a lannister-supported king, 
  we * suppose * it is true for * k * , and we prove it would work as well for * k +1 * . 
  now , give me a number , * n * , for which you want to check the hypothesis . 
  that number is * ( n-1 ) +1 * , so if we prove it holds for * ( n-1 ) * we 'll be done . 
  but we can do the same for * ( n-2 ) +1 * , * ( n-3 ) +1 , ... ( n-n ) +1 = 1 * . 
  but we proved it for the latter case , 1 , so it must be true for * 2 , 3 , ... ( n-1 ) , n * . 
  therefore , if given an arbitrary * n * , the hypothesis holds , it must be true for all natural numbers, 
   that is really unfair and the skins should n't be given or lost . 
  so you do n't care about the game , but about the skins , right ? 
  would you have considered trying it in other circumstances though ? 
  i have the feeling valve has been pushing them and trying to make them played for months , dropping things like * there will be a 7-map pool * when they added cobblestone and overpass , but nobody has ever paid attention nor offered suggestions ( or at least not in a public way ) , so valve has decided to go the hard way . 
  i 'm pretty sure valve would have supported small tournaments ( something like fragbite masters ) if they have added them to the map pool, 
   the m4 , ak , and awp are all very good guns that everyone uses , but no one complains about them being overpowered, 
  because for too many people cs is only ak , m4 , awp , deagle . 
  everything else is horribly bad and deserves being called cod , and no other playstyle or weapon is worthy, 
  chemistry and latin are both cis white men social constructs you shitlord, 
  as a non-reader that has been spoiled , the main concern is not the character , is the fact that it is able to do * something * as it opens tons of windows for the future, 
  [ video here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhw2lmcgw5m ) , saw it yesterday , and was sure i arrived at it from here . 
  she was feeling the opression of the patriarchy in her chest, 
  props to anders and semmler for their hard work , but i 'd also say thanks to the guys from caseking . 
  if i recall correctly it 's not the first cs : go tournament they have sponsored - and i think it 's great to have companies that care about competitive counter-strike and that are willing to invest on it , as more tournaments with more prize money for non top-tier teams is the only way the competitive scene will be able to grow . 
  good job !, 
  [ coup ] ( http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/131357/coup ) is a pretty neat board game , and could be easily adapted to be got-like . 
  something like `` small council '' :, 
  * duke becomes master of coin, 
  * assassin becomes ... 
  faceless man ? 
  * contessa becomes queen, 
  * captain becomes kingsguard, 
  * ambassador becomes master of whispers, 
  * inquisitor becomes hand of the king, 
  each player represents a house , and has infiltrated members on the small council .
