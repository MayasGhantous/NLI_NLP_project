  people from basque country , from galicia , from madrid , from andalucia , from canary islands , are all very different from each other . 
  probably there are more simmilarities between catalans and french people than there are between people from catalonia and canary islands , yes . 
  i 'd say there is no such thing as `` spanish culture '' , it 's a mixture of the number of different lifestyles from the different regions of spain . 
   is catalonia for spain somewhat like slovenia was for yugoslavia ? 
  ( where most industry was , where people had a different mindset , being more reserved , and where there were the highest standards of living ), 
  basque country ) and madrid are the main industrial foci of spain , and therefore have the highest quality of life/wealth, 
  no idea , but if you have nationality it should n't be a problem to get here . 
  call the closest consulate/embassy in the states . 
  not really , selectividad is done region-wide with all exams happening at the exact same time , so you have to do it either in june or in september . 
  different autonomous community will have different dates though , so just check which one has them before ( and you can also try and do it in the easier ones  ) . 
  yeah , you should be able to apply to as many as you want , all the applications should be free ( except maybe sending some faxes or official papers via post office ) . 
  commonly , every regions manages all the universities together , so it 's more comfortable if you do selectividad where you 'd like to study , but you can study in a different region than the one you did selectividad at . 
  spanish degrees , after bolonia 's decree , are at the same level than european degrees , so you should have no problem getting it accepted over there , with some exceptions : medicine , or law , for instance , might not be valid . 
  and maybe your degree will be undervalued with respect to american ones , that i just do n't know . 
  just take whichever document has the same number that you put in the form when buying , and if the driver asks for it , give him while pointing at the number . 
  i do n't think he 'll have any problem, 
  for granada - sevilla , the train is indeed the best option . 
  check out renfe.com , it 's the official spanish railways agency . 
  they also have an android app ( maybe for ios as well ? ), 
  to search for trains and manage your tickets so that you do n't need to print them . 
  if trains are expensive , you can check alsa.es for bus tickets , which should be more affordable . 
  for sevilla - barcelona , there 's 2 options . 
  train is the best in my opinion , there 's a high speed train ( ave ) connecting them in 5 hours ( not much considering it 's the other side of spain ) , but it might get pretty expensive the closer it gets to the departure gate , so check it asap . 
  you can also go by plane , it 's shorter of course ( around 90 minutes ) , but then you have to add time to go to the airport and then to the city center , etc. 
  i would very much prefer train as long as the prizes are reasonable . 
  guy from seville here , from what i know , it was pretty much impossible to see the actual filming part ( unless you had contacts working on the inside i guess ) , but you could meet some of the actors outside ( in their hotels , in the streets and sometimes even at pubs ) and greet them , and most would at least say hi . 
  the thing in the middle definitely looks to me llike [ manteca color\u00e1 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/manteca_color%c3%a1 ) . 
  i guess the outside must be some local pastries or some kind of bread to eat with the manteca . 
  the pink thing , i really do n't know - maybe [ york ham ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/manteca_color%c3%a1 ) ? 
  and with items like guardian greaves and solar crest he can still manage to have a decent impact in the teamfight by supporting the carries . 
   their offices are not as common as `` correos '' , so maybe it 's a few hundreds kilometers away and not worth it . 
  in sevilla you can almost always go to a local office . 
  local , however , might mean in outskirts , but if you have a car it should n't take that long ( and you can always take a bus or a bike ), 
  for me , it 's not interesting , it 's sad to see history being argued to be used as a political leverage . 
  the one proof i studied in my multivariable integration subject used essentially the lebesgue measure and simple , measurable functions . 
  i 'm genuinely not sure if calculus includes lebesgue measure wherever you study , but it 's not hard , and the only background it requires is knowing is lebesgue 's [ dominated convergence theorem ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dominated_convergence_theorem ) . 
  it followed a scheme similar to :, 
  * proof of cavalieri 's principle , that essentially becomes fubini 's theorem for a characteristic function ` [ ; \\ chi _ { a \\ times b }  ` defined in a x b. 
  * given a function ` [ ; f ( x , y ) : ( x , y ) \\ in ( a \\ times b ) \\ subset \\ mathbb { r } ^ m \\ times \\ mathbb { r } ^ n \\ rightarrow \\ mathbb { r } ^ k  ` , proof that the `` section '' with respect to y , ` [ ; f_y ( x )  ` , can be integrated over all ` [ ; x \\ in a \\ subset \\ mathbb { r } ^ m  ` . 
  you do this by considering simple functions ` [ ; \\ phi_j ( x , y ) \\ rightarrow f ( x , y ) , \\ , as \\ , \\ , j \\ rightarrow \\ infty  ` , and applying cavalieri 's principle . 
  * then you go on to consider ` [ ; f * ( y ) \\ , : = \\ int _ { a } f_y ( x , y ) dx  ` and again you prove that you can integrate it over all of b by using a succession of simple functions ` [ ; \\ phi_j * ( y ) \\ rightarrow f * ( y )  `, 
  * finally you have ` [ ; \\ int_b \\ int_a f ( x , y ) dx dy = \\ int_b f * ( y ) dy = \\ int_b \\ phi * ( y ) dy = \\ int _ { a \\ times b } \\ phi ( x , y ) dxdy = \\ int _ { a \\ times b } f ( x , y ) dxdy  ` . 
  this is just a sketch of the actual proof , and it 's missing a lot of details ( as well as some limits in the math ) , but i think the idea behind it is more or less clear . 
  the actual , complete proof can be found [ in this book ] ( http://www.edicionespiramide.es/libro.php?id=442697 ) ( albeit in spanish ) . 
  any chance you will take the leaderbords ' sign-in wall off ? 
  it 's pretty inconvenient when you just want to check how a player 's doing on phone and it asks you for login info , plus in dota you do n't need to sign in : /, 
   modern team game matchmaking systems do n't , as far as i know , use anything closely resembling elo anymore for this precise reason . 
  cs : go uses , as stated by valve 's vitaliy , a custom variation of glicko-2 rating system ( which in itself is a more complex version of elo that accounts for more factors ) . 
  so i 'd assume dota 2 's mmr is quite similar, 
  your english teacher experience might help . 
  both by working in an english academy ( there are tons in every major city ) as a standard teacher , or by giving lessons as a freelance to architecture students that are going abroad and teaching them technical terms et al. 
  or , for a calculus book , every epsilon is a shot, 
  if slark attacks a teammate during ww 's curse , will he steal his ally 's stats ? 
  well , given an arbitrary prime * p * , it appears in the factorization of * 2 \u00b7 p * , * p ^ 2 * , or * p !, 
  = p ( p-1 ) ( p-2 ) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 2 \u00b7 1 * , all of which are composite . 
  so yes , you can build a composite number with a prime factor given any prime . 
  madrid is a good option to stay , but you can check out other options like toledo or salamanca that are also relatively in the center of spain but may surely be cheaper . 
  salamanca especially , i think there are tons of ways to learn spanish there as the university is pretty known for their spanish classes . 
  you can do something similar with [ congruent numbers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/congruent_number ) . 
  you change the area of the triangle into an elliptic curve , then go on to talk about their ranks , and eventually prove 1 is not a congruent number . 
  and , as the ( sqrt ( 2 ) , sqrt ( 2 ) , 2 ) triangle has area 1 , and 2 is rational , we must have that sqrt ( 2 ) is irrational . 
  in case he 's going to granada , if i recall correctly the railways are being remodeled and there is no direct trains to the city , hence the need to stop several stops before and switch to buses . 
  based off your comments , i think granada would be a good pick . 
  have n't studied there , but their uni is pretty strong in several areas ( what are you studying btw ? 
  ) , it is pretty cheap ( 500 $ per month should be more than enough , granada is supposed to be cheaper than sevilla and here you can live pretty well with around 450 $ / mo. 
  ) , and there should be tons of accomodation available as the city is full of students . 
  the city is also small so you would n't pay much as transport , it is cheap to go out because you have a `` tapa '' with every drink you order , and a room in a shared flat should be really cheap . 
  also , you will be next to sierra nevada , so you 'll have some nice places to ski there if that 's what you like despite being in the south , as granada is a relatively cold city , but you 'll at the same time be an hour away from the mediterranean sea , and not far from algeciras or malaga if you want to take a ferry to morocco . 
  to add a bit to what others have added ( i agree 100 % with all of them ) , in sevilla the only problems you may face will be related with what you are wearing , not with your race . 
  so for entering some places ( pubs or clubs essentially ) you 'll need to have semi-etiquette to some extent . 
  but that applies to everyone , and only in the most `` posh '' places where there is a small case of clasism , which you can ( should ! ), 
  definitely avoid . 
  in most places tho you will have no problems . 
  [ example code for matlab ] ( http://pastebin.com/18zfgwps ) , if anyone 's interested . 
  i 'm pretty sure you should add, 
  * flying all teams to wherever the major 's taking place ( 80 players * around 1k $ each is a lot of money ) . 
  * hiring casters , production staff , analysts , panelists , cameramen , etc. 
  * paying for the production ( screens , stadium costs , etc. ) . 
  i 'm pretty sure that valve takes care of all those things in the majors , and leaves to the orgs ( dreamhack , esl ) only the organization while supplying them with money . 
  he 's a good player , a bit overated in my opinion . 
  but defenitely okay to be in a top team !, 
  to say that he is one of the best solo mids etc is really exageration , he played like 10 games in a high level lan , you need way more to compare him to dendi , s4 or fata, 
  do you have cameramen filming the players from different angles or are there also static cameras for each player ( like lol 's lcs , or cs : go at dh cluj napoca ) ? 
  * '' [ do n't just read it ; fight it !, 
  ] ( http://abstrusegoose.com/353 ) '' *, 
  only for the eu group qualifiers , they are now in the og/alliance/vp group . 
  my proposal is : allow brew to deny his own pandas . 
  that way you can initiate with 2 of them and keep one back , so if the two that advanced get caught you can just kill them and wait to respawn in the `` hidden '' one . 
  it 's not game-braking , and i think it would increase his survivavility . 
  to me , men 's is more physical ( just throwing cannons accross the pitch ) , whereas women 's is n't that much about strength, 
  checks out , considering it 's [ the most dangerous job in the u.s. ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/blake-fleetwood/how-dangerous-is-police-w_b_6373798.html ), 
  cs : go devs have stated that they use a variation of glicko-2 for matchmaking ratings . 
  considering that both are 5-players games made by valve , it 's pretty likely that dota also uses glicko-like ratings . 
  i guess the problem is they have not played `` officially '' with a changed roster . 
  so , valve may say `` you are qualified as this 5 , if you do n't like that , then go to open qualifier '' . 
   then again , i love me some ( well cast ) tier 2 dota . 
  i 'll watch almost any tournament on twitch , though that sadly means a lack of chinese teams most of the time . 
  sad thing about it is if feels like nowadays big studios only cover the main tournaments , so a lot of really good matches get over-looked , and are only casted by tier-3 casters that do n't have , for instance , dedicated spectator . 
  man , i sometimes wish i could speak russian just to follow ru-hub , that seems way more organized, 
  there should be a `` top 100 '' list , like the one in dota .
