  hi there fellow ib student . 
  in the spanish system to enter uni , you do 2 years of baccalaureate and , at the end , the selectividad exams . 
  your baccalaureate grades will account for 60 % of your final grade , the rest coming from the selectividad exams average . 
  that gives you a grade out of 10 . 
  the ib will give you this automatically based on your points out of 45 with some conversion . 
  however , during selectividad you can also do a `` specific phase '' : you take extra exams , and the results will be added to your grade depending on the subject and the degree you apply to . 
  for instance , if you take the math exam and score a 10 , you will get 0 ' 2 * 10 = 2 extra points for math/physics/engineering degrees , but probably no extra points for social sciences/law/humanities ... ( the 0 ' 2 part is what eill change : for instance technical drawing exam only counts as 0 ' 1 for math , while chemistry counts 0 ' 15 ) . 
  you can use up to two subjects this way , earning up to 4 additional points . 
  so , with your ib exams , you could get a 9 for instance , and then take 2 exams ( check which subjects will give you more points for the degree you want ) , and if you have a 7 ' 5/10 in both of them you 'll end up with a total score of 12 . 
  so tldr : take into consideration that in the spanish system you can have 14 points . 
  i 'm not sure what the rules are for students wanting to take only specific exams for selectividad , but i know there is a system in place to allow ib students to do it . 
  no es suficiente con cagarse en la leche . 
  may i suggest another thing : add a round-end notification at the top right , in the kill feed . 
  that way it 's easier to know , in last second hunting , whether someone was killed before or after round end , which means whether they will receive money next round or not . 
  overall , what heroes performance have suprised you/disappointed you at boston major ? 
  no , just as a poll of 1000 male farmers from the same town is not representative . 
  people on reddit are already in specific segment of players . 
  thank mr seangares, 
   it almost does n't matter what film he 's holding, 
  is n't he holding `` the grasshopper lies heavy '' ? 
  european here : i 'm finishing my degree , and as i want to go into academia ( because i want to do research basically ) , the next step should be a master 's degree , but the question is , what factors should i take into consideration in order to choose which one is better ? 
  i 've been looking into several universities , but i have no knowledge of their `` prestige '' or anything , and i do n't have the tools to measure the `` quality '' of teaching beforehand . 
  so how should i assess the programs ? 
  is there a way to know what european universities have the stronger math departments , if possible by fields ? 
  ( i 'm looking at algebra/number theory , and i have no idea what universities or departments are considered `` strong '' in that area ) . 
  also , is it better to choose a very specific program with subjects i 'm really interested in over one that looks less interesting , but comes from a `` better '' institution ? 
  and last , for people familiar with the american system , how common is it to receive some sort of funding at master 's level ? 
  ( not a full salary , just a tuition waiver or something similar ), 
  if everybody is op , then nobody is, 
  you can input twitch streams to vlc via livestreamer and rebroadcast from there , so no need to capture screen, 
  take those shots , but remember that you are drinking to the lady in the white shoes, 
  another suggestion : invert colors . 
  it 's much more convenient to have white background on images . 
  if you have access to software like mathematica or maple , they should be more than enough to cover your needs . 
  an open source option is python with matplotlib ( see for example [ this ] ( http://matplotlib.org/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/tutorial.html ) ) . 
  ( ( ( physics ) ) ), 
  it is just unlikely that someone without credentials ( in general , someone that is n't a `` professional '' mathematician ) will be able to prove a conjecture that has been open for a century . 
  there should be no worry about `` making a fool out of yourself '' , though . 
  everyone that works with math eventually misses details and gets wrong results , and only by seeing those mistakes he can improve .

  thick is re ( \u03b6 ( z ) ) = 0 , thin is im ( \u03b6 ( z ) ) = 0 , so the intersections of two lines are zeroes of \u03b6 ( z ) . 
  dotted lines are the 10 x 10 grid , light grey is the critical strip . 
  the text gives some extra information , if you are really interested , pm me and i 'll try to translate it . 
  but how can i be the bad guy if i 'm just following orders ? 
  but usually typing more related things might work , i.e. 
  searching `` l2 functions math '' takes you to the right answer . 
  the imaginary part of the first zero of ` [ ; \\ zeta  ` is 14.13 ... , so in the graph , the point represents ` [ ; \\ zeta ( -28.13 ... + 14.13 ... ) = \\ zeta ( -14 ) = 0  ` , because it is a * trivial * zero ( as is every negative even integer ) . 
  the riemann hypothesis says * nontrivial * zeros ( i.e. 
  all those that are not at -2 k ) have ` [ ; \\ im ( \\ rho ) = 1/2  ` . 
  negative exponents are better understood with the definition of * inverse * , in my opinion . 
  what is a ^ ( -1 ) ? 
  well , it is the number you have to multiply a with to get 1 . 
  for example , modulo 7 , what is 3 ^ ( -1 ) ? 
  because 3 \\* 5 = 15 = 14 + 1 = 1 mod 7 , it is clear that 5 = 3 ^ ( -1 ) . 
  and for a ^ ( - n ) , just write it as ( a ^ ( -1 ) ) ^ n , find the ( mod ) inverse of a , and use regular exponentiation, 
  fwiw , her advisor is actually a fields medalist ( akin to nobel prize winner ) , working in a relatively unexplored area of mathematics . 
  try ireland and rosen 's [ * a classical introduction to modern number theory * ] ( https://archive.org/details/springer_10.1007-978-1-4757-2103-4 ) . 
  the beginning assumes just basic knowledge of algebra , and although at the end it is very much geared towards algebraic number theory , the first chapters are very good . 
  well yes , surely first year stuff like intro to linear algebra , real analysis , discrete math and some of the easier abstract algebra would be easier . 
  however , for the rest of subjects , all of their advantage is in their ability to understand and produce correct proofs , which is not much . 
  what is true , however , is that imo medalists would be among the top students , so one can imagine that they will perform better during their undergrad . 
  have you tried adding, 
  to your preamble ? 
  imagine you have to pick a random real number from 0 to 1 . 
  what is the probability that you end up picking exactly 1/2 ? 
  well , one could say it is favorable cases / total cases = 1 / amount of real numbers between 0 and 1 . 
  but we know that there are infinitely many real numbers in any interval , so it must be that the probability of picking 1/2 is 1 / \u221e , which has to be zero . 
  so you have a 0 % probability ... however , that does n't mean it 's impossible to pick 1/2 . 
  for the 100 % , just do the opposite : consider the probability of picking a real number from 0 to 1 that is n't 1/2 . 
  overwatch is supposed to tackle people that are intentionally running down mid lane to feed , or cliffing their allies with io or kotl , not people playing legion commander jungle and dying to ganks all the time due to their level . 
  double elimination ( upper bracket/lower bracket , like ti ), 
  that 's common indeed , but there are several variants .

  better granada first then sevilla i 'd say , it may be easier to find a flight to barcelona, 
  so , pitchforks down ? 
  pitchforks up at valve for trying to bring our pitchforks down ? 
  ** rule 7 : ** germany just wanted to defend europe from stalinist bolshevism , they fought 12 to 1 in the eastern front , defending the fatherland in the motherland agains the mass of soviets that wanted to rape their women , crimes against civil population ? 
  not real .

  surely that was the polizei !, 
  oh , you mean there were partisans around ? 
  then it 's fully justified !, 
  comments are also a world on their own . 
  i think the key statistic for p3 is 608 attendants got zero points , 5 got partial credit , 2 got the 7/7 . 
  that is way worse than p6 , and according to [ this ] ( https://www.quora.com/what-is-the-toughest-problem-ever-asked-in-an-imo ) , it may be considered the hardest-ever imo problem with an average of 0,042 / 7 . 
  i 'll go ahead and recommend everyone [ the euclidea app } ( https://www.euclidea.xyz/ ) , in which you have to try and recreate classical constructions of the elements ( midpoint of a line , tangent to a circle through a given point , etc. ), 
  using only compass and straightedge in the least possible number of movements . 
  it 's not easy to see . 
  if you remember the waterfall , there is a small park going down the stairs , and to the right a passage that goes down to those baths .

  as hltv is going full madness with it , let 's see what fellow redditors think . 
  for those who were n't watching :, 
  1 ) nuke , last map in a bo3 . 
  aug was `` banned '' for both teams ( gentlemen 's agreement ) . 
  2 ) delpan ( esc ) buys it as ct in the first half ; * the agreement is broken * . 
  3 ) second half , h2k uses 2 or 3 augs consistently . 
  3 ) [ spoiler ] esc buys it as well during overtime as ct. 
  this subreddit receives a lot of visits from people lloking for suggestions for their spanish trips . 
  whenever there is one mentioning sevilla i try my best at pointing out interesting things to do , but it can get too repetitive . 
  i think it could be a good idea to each week hold a discussion about a specific city ( or maybe region ) , in which locals talk about things to do , places to eat at , etc.
