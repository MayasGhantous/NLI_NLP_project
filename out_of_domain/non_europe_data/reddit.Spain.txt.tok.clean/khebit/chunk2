  oh , and she needs to enjoy the game ( playing it , watching it , learning how to play ) . 
  otherwise she 'll probably end up quitting : /, 
  with stuttering you mean 3 seconds at standard fps and , suddenly , the game `` stops '' for one second or so ? 
  if you mean that , i have the same problem : /, 
  definitely , just see that with a horrible f0rest they ended up 15-15 on nuke . 
  if they had had a better momentum with f0rest landing shoots and get_right with his usual clutches , they should have won . 
  i think it is , as etherfast says , something mental . 
  losing 4 rounds in a row being 1 far from getting to a third map ... it 's just not normal , even less when vg is half-ecoing, 
  i 'm surprised i have n't seen it yet ... http://i.imgur.com/f74311x.gif, 
   why do people in this sub-reddit think this is acceptable or justified ? 
  nobody gives a shit who said what or what happened , this kind of thing is completely unsportsmanlike . 
  it would n't be tolerated in football , basketball etc so why should it happen in esports ? 
  this just proves ** both ** teams were acting childish . 
  if you are `` harassed '' , and blame lgb for not playing fair , then you should n't do the same . 
  both teams should recognize this is just a game , and should ' t be that offended for these reasons . 
  it gives a bad image of both of them that helps nobody, 
  eswc said they would only release vods and replays with the commentaries from the french streaming :(, 
  i guess being defeated by verygames was bad for them , and losing straight afterwards against ad was horrible . 
  they will surely need some bootcamping to get their things together , as they seem depressed now and that way they 'll not even have a chance of winning dhw, 
  a fantastic interview : the right questions and mainly the right , truthful answers from fiffie . 
  nice to see he 's not trying to hide the truth and is speaking honestly about the matches, 
  well i 'm pretty sure to answer those questions you should get in contact with people over the [ philosophy ] or [ religion ] guilds, 
  yep , i understood it as `` what a shame we lost in the finals in my last apperance here !, 
  '' , not as if he 's retiring because of the defeat, 
  anders tweeted about it : apparently he has the videos from the streaming saved and will be uploading them soon :, 
  it would be awesome to watch a mixed-teams match , lem me explain : na'vi and fnatic rosters mixed randomly , so we could see for example f0rest , get_right , markeloff and starix in the same team improvising , 
  i 'd be fine with that too actually ( if it 's after an evening of competivie cs ), 
  and you also have in-game attributes such as [ colour-blindness ] or [ daltonism ], 
   in my experience , la mancha is lovely to visit ( part of my wife 's family is from there so i 've been plenty of times ) ... 
  but without being too mean , i 'd say it 's a little backward and conservative for my taste . 
  maybe just ` old fashioned ' is a better way of putting it ? 
  i think i 'd go mad if i lived there . 
  as a southern spaniard , i have never understood where that comes from . 
  yes , old people from towns tend to be more racist and traditional , but in general young people is respectful with everybody and there are no gender issues, 
  yeah , and not only in the coast . 
  in general it happens throughout all andalusia at least ( even zones far from the sea such as jaen or cordoba ) , and in 12 hours it rains the same that would rain in the north during two weeks . 
  luckily enough , it does n't last for too long, 
  seville , capital city of known universe , 
  how long are you staying ? 
  the best places to visit are : plaza de espa\u00f1a , cathedral ( including the giralda ** ) , reales alc\u00e1zares , the setas ( a.k.a. 
  metropol parasol , google it and check street view ) , city center in general ( mainly the streets near the cathedral , and barrio de santa cruz ) . 
  other possible places to visit are palacio de pilatos , maria luisa 's park , hang out around the river , cross to triana through triana 's bridge ( there 's a caf\u00e9 right there in a tower , great to have something in the afternoon with a fantastic view ) , iglesia del salvador ( first cathedral of seville ) and a lot of hidden places ( for example , the iglesia de santa mar\u00eda la blanca is fantastic ! ) . 
  if you have any questions , just feel free to ask :d, 
  ** if you 're more than 10 , [ this might be interesting ] ( http://www.cubiertasdelacatedral.com/node/8 ) ( only in spanish tho , ca n't find an english link ) . 
  i have n't done it yet so i ca n't really tell you how it works , or if there is any chance of joining a smaller group . 
  [ these are the views ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d66ljo5o0xy ), 
  do n't forget , when tweeday appeared the whole shitstorm had already started . 
  so loads of people , before knowing the other part of the story , were already blaming him , accusing him of scamming and harassing him . 
  so yeah , i guess a lot of people just enjoy attacking people for free ( tho i guess if it happened to them they would never give the knife back , ofc ), 
  i 'm from spain . 
  as someone from a town that was arab for centuries ( seville ) , i have to say : thanks muhammad . 
  the legacy of the arabs for spain was impressive , in culture , agriculture , architecture , knowledge in tons of areas ... so yeah , whoever did that video should double-check the facts . 
  claw for index and middle finger , palm for the rest, 
  yeah , but i guess in quite a strange way, 
  it 's senseless . 
  also , according to some of the people involved , `` they did that because everybody did it as well '', 
  and do n't forget that you 're given z , so you 're supposed to give it in your answer as well , so you 'd have x = a + bt , y = c + dt , z = t, 
  kudos to fragbite ( and to anders and semmler as well ) for a great stream , nice to see gotv and match streams improving so much and making them easier and funnier to watch, 
  you 're talking about '' \u00d8 '' , right ? 
  it kinda looks like geogebra to me , but it could be anything i guess, 
  it is exactly the same . 
  btw , in that link there is a kind of discussion ... 
  i stick with the `` all commit suicide/all fire the webmaster '' option , are there any other possibilities ? 
  or is that the right one ? 
  in dm , considering players may appear at every possible angle , 4 at a time , is a waste of time unless most of your team is `` camping '' an area, 
  that 's because sin ( x ) = sin ( 180-x ) . 
  in general calculator will only give you the result in the interval [ -90,90 ] . 
  intended behaviour , if you have a molotov blocking your way , throwing a smoke grenade at it will end it . 
  similarly , throwing a molotov to somewhere covered by smoke will simply have no effect, 
  yeah , that final round with kucher alone against 2 in season was just fantastic, 
  well , why not ? 
  that 's an interesting point you 've made . 
  and as there are women and black people that suffered gun crimes , that 's both a racist and a misogynistic term that should totally be eliminated, 
  if you win the first round , enemies will just have pistols for the next 2 , so the pro90 is a cheap and convenient option for a first buy . 
  me maybe ? 
  suppose * i *  0 , then by squaring both sides * i * ^ ( 2 ) = -1  0 : contradiction . 
  now let 's say * i * < 0 , by multiplying for * i * ( and changing the order because * i * is negative ) we have * i * \u00b7 * i * = -1  0 * i * = 0 : contradiction again . 
  therefore , * i * is neither positive nor negative . 
  you just can not have the `` traditional '' sense of order in the complex field . 
  you could try substituing s into p and then that into l , and treating it as a second degree equation , tho i 'm not really sure if that works or fails at some point . 
  i got :, 
  a\u0394rb / r ^ ( 2 ) x l ^ ( 2 ) - l + lo = 0 , therefore l = ( r ^ ( 2 ) \u00b1 \u221a ( r ^ ( 2 ) - 4a\u0394rb ) ) / ( 2a\u0394rb ), 
  started thinking that in ems finals , continued in eswc and now it is confirmed for me : ** friberg is the man ** . 
  seriously , he has stepped his gameplay so much , and he wins a lot of rounds alone for his team , not receiving as much attention as g_r or f0rest . 
  with xizt being a fantastic leader and fiffie improving his awp skills , nip roster is just ridiculous . 
  on the matches : oh shit , i ca n't believe it 'll be over in three days . 
  stunning action in almost every map !, 
  can it get any better for the finals ? 
  seriously , epic match , dust2 being one of the best i 've seen during the whole dhw . 
  great job for the whole nip , and fantastic job as well for vg ( shoxie and smithzz were godlike ! ), 
  6 sensitivity ? 
  that 's a lot , i 'd go for at least less than 3 . 
  many players use 1.5-2 .5, 
  i think those are `` professional '' matches stats . 
  in matchmaking maps tend to be more t sided , mainly in lower levels , because of lack of communication/harder to hold sites if you are not in a 5 men premade, 
  i do n't think so , as far as i know if you want to treat infinity you have to expand the reals to things such as the [ surreal numbers ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/surreal_number ) . 
  * `` c'\u00e9tait peut-\u00eatre mon dernier eswc , \u00e7a fait quelque chose quand m\u00eame , d\u00e9sol\u00e9 . . '' * = `` that was maybe my last eswc , that 's kind of something , what a shame '' ( more or less , my french is n't too good ), 
  * all teammates died *, 
  * feel them judge *, 
  * your every move *,
