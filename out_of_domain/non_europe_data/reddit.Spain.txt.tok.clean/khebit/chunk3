  i agree with you . 
  it kind of stopped but momentum , but hey , nip was already far ahead vg , so you ca n't blame that pause for the defeat . 
  in my opinion , inferno has been fnatic winning lots of rounds for small details ; col did good as t but every round someone from fnatic would stand out and crush them . 
  i 'm pretty sure that 's racism either to people living in the north pole/scandinavia/northern canada , or to the ones living in the sahara . 
  you cis racist scum !, 
  as a spanish , i never have a team to cheer , nor a player to support :(, 
  my favourite is nip and ( spoiler ) it 's losing :( ( ( ( ( ( ( (, 
  check your continental-privilege !, 
  because random . 
  also , two of the world class teams ( spain and netherlands ) in the same group ( back to 2010 's final ) , and france , which almost did n't qualify , in the easiest group ... 
  you could check edmund landau 's `` foundations of analysis '' : it covers the creation of the real numbers from peano 's axioms ( the ones of natural numbers ) . 
  while it is not easy , you can work out and understand most of the results , and it gives a fantastic hindsight into the importance of rigurous proofs for everything in math , and how to work from something simple and apparently basic to something way more complex . 
  much thanks !, 
  something like :, 
  ( i do n't know the console codes for tab and opening scoreboard : / ), 
  i think that 's a known issue , are you using a mac ? 
  someone mentioned it could be because of that . 
  check :, 
  i 'm starting to study haskell right now . 
  for math ( which is what i 'm doing ) is great , because it simplifies a lot of things ( lists , comprehension , declaring * mathematical * functions , etc. ), 
  and allows you to write cleaner code . 
  however , i do n't really like it for other things , i prefer python int the way it allows you to treat several variables or create loops . 
  take into consideration that my knowledge of both languages is very limited , so do n't take my opinion too much into consideration, 
   rather than trying to get comfortable with a new version of counterstrike, 
  i think that 's important , lots of older pros played for ~ 12 years cs1 .6 , and it might be harder for them to adapt to cs : go than to younger people who are n't as used to 1.6 ( although the nip showmatch showed old-nip players were in form with go !, 
  i have some photos like that as well from when i was there . 
  also , do n't tell me if i should commit suicide or not . 
  or without the space :, 
  cl_crosshair_drawoutline 1, 
  just to clarify , you mean 7 ^ ( n ) -3 ^ ( n ) and not ( 7 ^ ( n-3 ) ) ^ ( n ) , right ? 
  they are not disbanding however : `` the whole team have now decided to stick together , staying together under any circumstances '' . 
  [ link in russian ] ( http://www.virtus.pro/news/bomba-ad-bolshe-net/ ) ( from [ seized 's tweet ] ( https://twitter.com/seizedwf/status/417721836240003072 ) ), 
  i like how he looks up when he realises the nade failed and he 's gon na die, 
  man , now i feel empty without knowing the nsfw explanation of the frobenius ' method :(, 
  so , it 's gon na be pretty much vg vs col vs ibp rite ? 
  i do n't think the other na teams can be a challenge for those three , sad to see that a tournamente that could have been really interesting loses so many good teams, 
  * niptv : where magic happens *,

  are you interested in several b smokes-flashes ? 
  i could tell you where to aim , but i ca n't upload videos : /,

  thank you tanari \\ o /, 
  : [ shoxie apparently heard you ] ( http://beta.twitch.tv/shoxcsgo ), 
   i just wanted to shed some light on esports and how cutthroat and greedy it can be , and how morals and ethics are thrown out the window , even by a respected organization . 
  that applies to everything in life , i do n't think there 's anything we can do . 
  furthermore , they are completely free to do * what they want * , so if lemondogs wanted the money , let them have it . 
  enjoy capitalism \u2122, 
  when markeloff switched to go from 1.6 , he said he had been a few weeks playing ~ 11 hours a day . 
  if you wan na go pro , just invest all the time you can [ practicing ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slcrftmbsgs ) . 
  99.99999999 i would say !, 
  also , have n't you seen all the complain threads we 've had lately since payback ? 
  you will , ems katowice is in around 2 months . 
  if you mean the qualifiers , i do n't think so , depends on the server they are playing at, 
  ak47 black laminate sure can ( it dropped me once ) . 
  i think it 's everything except for knives and red quality items, 
  fifflaren is clearly cs 's sexiest player, 
  ( no homo ) ^ ( not too much ), 
  the fact that he is a good streamer and player does n't automatically makes him world 's # 1 awp . 
  also , i 'm guessing reaction time can not go down a certain number ( or it 's very difficult ) , so nobody can really go beyond 180ms, 
  pretty sure hiko has something to do with that, 
  show_fps 1, 
  semphis guilty, 
  just one thing : if they are 4 you should follow their orders , it 's senseless having one guy doing something and the other 4 doing the opposite, 
  well , to be fair , homeless * should * have won if they had n't forgot to put the bomb down ( or whatever happened ) in that 1v2 against hiko, 
  there are 2 or 3 commands wrong there ; if you have more doubts about a command try * find whatever * and it will return all the commands with that word . 
  pretty useful for crosshair and viewmodel, 
  or add - console to launch options ( or both ) . 
  if you add it to launch options it will be opened automatically each time you start the game , so if you start it and nothing happens there 's definitely something weird, 
  sometimes it 's better to use voice commands , ie if you are alone in a bombsite you might prefer to send a `` negative '' or a `` roger '' without having to speak , that makes more noise . 
  2v2 , you are retaking and you fail and flash him , making him die . 
  you are still alive and trying to clutch , but you say sorry * just because * . 
  to be honest , it 's useful for those who use voice commands , and there are many useless ones , so i do n't think it would be a big deal adding it, 
  we could have an irc channel during the match or something like that ; it takes 5 secs and we can have some fun there, 
  yes , use * net_graph 1 * . 
  if you type in console * find graph * you 'll get a bunch of different options to customize it . 
  why not middle-range ? 
  what i do is : go to search game ( casual/mm ) with your ping to 5 max , open console and you 'll see the game `` pinging '' tons of servers ; example :, 
   [ mm ] server responded ' 146.66.159.224:27044 ' , ** dist 121 **, 
   [ mm ] server responded ' 146.66.158.124:27076 ' , ** dist 121 **, 
   [ mm ] server responded ' 146.66.158.157:27060 ' , ** dist 121 **, 
  you can see when it * jumps * location ; in my case some servers are around 115 and afterwards it jumps to 140 ; put then your limit to something which includes the servers you saw with lower ping ( you can use * mm_dedicated_search_maxping x * ) . 
  or you could even check with the ip where those servers are located . 
  apparently fifflaren is now the igl and xizt is back to rifler, 
  csgolounge.com probably is the best option, 
  it can be worse : people that buy the four grenades but do n't use it, 
  plus , it 's an online cup , and i do n't think they care too much , so as long as both teams think it 's fair , they do it . 
  1 ) take control , make them do whatever you tell him . 
  it 's ok if they take the initiative to try to peek some angle , but if you tell rush b , they all have to rush b ( it 's frustrating when because of someone not obeying you lose an easy round ) . 
  2 ) do n't get stuck with a strat ; if you were going b but you get 2 picks in short , then maybe changing and going a is the best option . 
  from my very small experience those are the most important factors . 
  and apparently mainly in na , almost every team did it whereas en eu only some do it and others go for pure ecos, 
  if you do n't really know how to play the game , do n't play competitive ; go deathmatch to train your aim and casual to know the maps . 
  that screen also appears when you trade someone and receive items , and in that scenario you can get loads of items, 
  check http://tacnet.io/tacsketch/, 
  try adding * echo `` hello '' * at random points and then execute it , and see what appears in console, 
  excluding knives : stattrak ak-47 fire serpent . 
  although a souvenir m4a1-s varicamo would be great as well ... 
  i 'm guessing you have * g * as a function ; then * g : a -  b * .
