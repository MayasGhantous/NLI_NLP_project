  this is , if g ( 5 ) = 1000 , then 5 belongs to g ^ ( -1 ) ( 1000 ) . 
  note that g ^ ( -1 ) ( 1000 ) is a set of numbers , not only one ( unless * g * is injective ) .

  i think you could try * mp_death_drop_gun `` 0 '' * so that ts do n't drop weapons when they die, 
  hiko did it like 4 or 5 days ago , but only for a match . 
  try going to his stream next time and ask him to do it again , he might : dunno :, 
  in what sense ? 
  armor does n't do much , only removes damage ( mainly from grenades ) and prevents you from being aimpunched, 
  is cache your only option in terms of maps ? 
  afaik there are n't many silver players playing bravo , therefore it will more likely match you with players who are ahead of you, 
  i just love the varicamo ( even better if it 's souvenir ), 
  i actually find more amusing the fact that in the next round there were 3 m4s but a pro90 got a quadkill . 
  them silver strats !, 
  1 ) i 'm not sure about what `` active '' means for a starcraft player , but almost every weekend there are at least small tournaments with some top teams and many medium teams . 
  and usually every 2 months or less there will be a `` major '' with all top tier teams involved ( next one will be ems one katowice ) . 
  check anders ' nipgamingtv and jay_atkins at twitch , they are the top english streamers for cs : go . 
  2 ) there is a matchmaking-style league , where you play and , depending on the match result and your performance , you will rank up or down . 
  silver i is the lowest , global elite the highest rank . 
  however , if you want to play competitive , i 'd suggest you to ( a ) play a lot of casual and watch games until you know the maps/control the weapons/understand the general metagame and ( b ) play with people you know will communicate , as communication is key to victory ( in matchmaking you are given the chance of queing with up to 5 friends ), 
  i have to agree 100 % with you : i 'm sure there 's a reason behind getting left out , and while i think he 's one of world 's top awpers , i think being in a good mood with the team is more important than being a good fragger, 
  is betting worth it ? 
  well , you could get 300m $ one day , or you could spend money for the rest of your life without getting a cent back . 
  same applies to opening cases, 
  there is an european cup : http://e-frag.net/euchamp/, 
  if it was world cup instead not much would change , apart from the us all the top countries are in europe, 
  the problem is , for lots of countries i do n't think top 5 players would want to work in tactics . 
  i mean , i do n't think get_right wants to spend time in training with rival teams, 
  i 'm just waiting until we get * hats *,

  apparently someone lost internet connection , so server paused . 
  it 's already like that by default as far as i know, 
  to be honest , i think that they were the best team and also that having a stand-in should be penalized in some way . 
  i think it 's unfair to be able to play with someone that 's not from your team , then i could play with two mates and ask get_right and f0rest to join and i 'd be wrecking everybody ... 
  and in my opinion delpan is in a much higher level than players on both team .

  fun fact : ( at least before ) killing chickens will give you points in deathmatch . 
  maybe you killed one without noticing, 
   wondering if there is anything i can do to become unbanned , i tried contacting support but have n't gotten a response and it 's been over 24hrs . 
  they unbanned those that received vac bans , i think he 's talking about the cooldowns received from servers going down and game crashing . 
  unfortunately , i do n't think valve will do anything to remove those competitive cooldowns : /,
