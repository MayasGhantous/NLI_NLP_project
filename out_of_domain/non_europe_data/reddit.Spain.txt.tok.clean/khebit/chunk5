  valve said one time that they wanted to make movement much more realist , so the answer to yout petition might be there, 
  deagle fix ? 
  in my opinion ( and in the opinion of many others ) it was fine before . 
  the fact that you like something does n't mean the game has to be like you want it to . 
  aug will be fixed , stop whining , and remember you need 16 rounds to win so if you start as ct you can make a comeback . 
  i do n't like it because it involves buying nothing for the pistol round , so if you do n't kill anyone in time or try to push you might get easily killed and throw the round because you did n't have that flash/kevlar/smoke . 
  a normal day at / r/globaloffensive : * hurr durr volvo bring 1.6 back this game sucks so much this is not cs pls do n't add other weapons except the ones i want to see added pls nerf every weapon except the ones i like fuck volvo worst company u destroying cs it 's only cs if i say so *, 
  and do n't get me wrong , i 'm against new aug. 
   play a wee bit of mm with a team who doesnt have autism, 
   1v1 me rust you trash fgt, 
  yeah well ... that 's the spirit i guess, 
  plus , you ca n't hold an angle because you can never be sure if your teammate has n't sold you and your back is n't covered , so you have to keep checking or you 'll get backstabbed, 
  '' * online * pauses '' that 's the problem : in an online tournament you have 10 players at 10 locations , everyone with a different connection , everyone might face some problems , server might be ddos 'd ... 
  try :, 
  * mp_buy_anywhere `` 1 '' ;, 
  yep . 
  the actual one will always be the one of net_graph as far as i know , the one that appears in the scoreboard is n't always right ( mainly when there are lag spikes ), 
  try setting the language to english ( or your lang ) and verifying cache afterwards, 
  it still does n't guarantee anything . 
  you could have a guy betting a bizon and receiving 30 stattraks . 
  obviously if you are planning on taking items you wo n't write it down . 
  and i 'm not saying you [ for csgolounge ] are scammers , i 'm just saying you accidentally scammed loads of people and are acting like nothing happened . 
  if it does n't work , delete the whole cfg folder , and verify game cache . 
  i think you can turn up people 's voices without changing other sounds , if that 's what you mean, 
  yes - the only way to play ranked matches is through valve 's mm service, 
  and do n't tryhard . 
  prior to a game , play a dm with a ridiculous weapon ( like , only with tec9 ) . 
  you 'll get killed again , and again , and again , and you 'll rage because you shoot them and they do n't die , but the rage will decrease slowly . 
  after some minutes , you 'll be dying constantly without getting frustrated and will be able to focus more on the present and forget your last death . 
  ^ ( this is weird , yes , but hey , it works for me so you might like to try it ! ), 
  i really like the five-seven contractor which is like 10 cents and looks great even if it 's not fn, 
  you can rent a server ( for free ) at :, 
  - http://freegamehosting.nl/ 64 tick , no time limit , low ping at least for me in spain . 
  10/10 would recommend as it 's easy to set up . 
  does n't have built-in casual config , but i believe you are able to set it through the console as they give you access as admin to the server . 
  - https://www.gameservers.com/free/ 128 tick , london-based server . 
  you can rent it for 3 hours if there 's nobody there before you . 
  comes with built-in configs of several leagues , including the casual game config . 
  google `` free csgo servers '' for more info , for me at least those are the 2 best in terms of ping ( there are others with swedish servers i think ) . 
  to be honest , the glock train , 5 guys with glocks and kevlar ( i.e. 
  100 bullets ) , seems much more powerful , at least to me, 
  then , if it 's a 4-guys premade ( except me ) , and someone tks me , if i do n't forgive me my team will blame me , and they will kick me , and all of a sudden it will be a 3v5 . 
  valve 's idea is : blame the system , not the player, 
  * rip in peace * is a bait to troll people who really think the poster does n't know what rip means . 
  very common in twitch kappa, 
  fast question : what are your video settings ? 
  my weapons look really blurry although the textures look really close to yours :|, 
  can i give myself to gabe for a night instead of my wife ? 
  ^ ( no homo ), 
  you are n't , it 's a `` bug '' that has been happening since last update . 
  try going to steam -  cs : go -  properties -  local files -  verify integrity, 
  ems one katowice ( 14-16 march , 250.000 $ in prizes , a hundred grand for the winner ) . 
  right afterwards there will be copenhaguen games ( although i do n't know how many top tier teams will assist being the dates so close ), 
  each person uses a different one , use the one you 're comfortable with . 
  i 'm using atm 400dpi 2 ingame sens, 
  adding : de_cache :, 
  * a & b site : destroying old soviet weaponry, 
  [ some men ... just want to watch the world burn ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnt0anp7wk8 ), 
  if you know they will try to kick you - be ready to disconnect as soon as the message pops up . 
  if you are disconnected , they wo n't be able to kick you while you are n't in the match . 
  then reconnect - disconnect until match ends . 
  i was going alone as ct in banana to b ( inferno ) in a retake situation , and i threw a smoke to ct. . and then i flashed . 
  and then , i tried to flash * again * . 
  of course , they killed me easily, 
  because they need to be worse than real people just so you do n't kick everyone in your team because you prefer bots . 
  i just wish i lived in a country that supports e-sports so much :(, 
  cl_crosshair_drawoutline `` 0 '' maybe ? 
  ** shotguns ** : they are fine . 
  one shot kill if you are 1m away from him , with distance ( this is , after 3rd round ) is just useless . 
  and is like a p250 at short distance ... so it 's a nice reward if you take the risk . 
  ** smgs ** : they are fine . 
  mac10 has a really high damage and is very cheap . 
  bizon is n't that great if they have armor , so it 's a risky weapon . 
  ** awp ** : it 's fine too . 
  it 's risky to buy awp : expensive and low kill reward , but deadly , so use it with caution . 
  ** cz-75 ** : 24 bullets is a joke for me , you can be out in 20 secs ... so it 's a good weapon for its price . 
  i agree that the kill reward should be shown as a number though, 
  but that 's e-sports in general ( except for south corea ) . 
  the amount of big touraments , lans , teams and players sweden puts her years ahead of other countries , even though e-sports are n't as good considered as sports . 
  * sv_gravity 400 *, 
  sv_cheats 1, 
  sv_showimpacts 1, 
  sv_grenade_trajectory 1, 
  sv_infinite_ammo 1, 
  mp_buy_anywhere 1, 
  this should do the trick, 
  you just ca n't go above 68, 
  go to steam apps  common  counter strike : global offensive  csgo  cfg . 
  open the file config.cfg with notepad or whatever , and find crosshair . 
  i guess all the commands will appear there . 
  alternatively , try writing `` find crosshair '' in console , and write one by one the commands afterwards . 
  if you type nothing afterwards ( like * cl_crosshairthickness * ) it will tell you its current value . 
  thorin wants head * kappa *, 
  [ arguably the best commercial ever ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9w5pgur-ous ), 
  how big do you guys think counter-strike can grow competitively with respect to other games such as lol , dota2 or scii ? 
  as / u/hellkittyanarchy said , forget about those weapons . 
  go deathmatch and practice ak , m4 ( try both and go with the one you prefer , both are great and choosing one or another is a question of preference ) . 
  as a pistol , try the p250 , it 's really powerful . 
  aim should be the first step , and training is the only way to improve . 
  afterwards , check pros matches .
