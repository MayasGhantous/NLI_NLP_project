  you can either watch mm of high-ranked players or check live streams ( like nipgamingtv or jay_atkins at twitch ) . 
  look at how they face the rounds , where do they play , how they push , how they defend , the movement and rotations to defend sites . 
  then , economy . 
  you have to know when you can buy and when you ca n't . 
  kevlar + helmet is a must . 
  eco if the team ca n't buy , try to know how your enemy 's economy is like knowing the rounds each one has won . 
  better weapons will make you win rounds . 
  and in the end , grenades . 
  knowing good smokes will prevent enemies from appearing/give you easy kills . 
  same for flashes , and hes . 
  low-ranked people underestimate grenades too much when they 're one of the most powerful things in the game . 
  nope . 
  it 's valve 's problem , not yours . 
  [ they make the game 20 % cooler ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcejodcqumm ) ; kudos to fragbite !, 
  it 's powerful enough for its price , it would be a senseless weapon if it worse in every single aspect to other weapons . 
  the symbol just tells as what * s * is . 
  before , * s * could be pretty much anything , depending on the context . 
  after you write s : = { ... } , you are defining that , from now on , s will be a certain set/function/etc , while before you just could n't say * s = { ... } * because you did n't know what s was . 
  in practice , however , when defining things '' = '' is used too , and people will understand you actually mean `` by definition '' . 
  the notation is the same ( \u225c and : = are equivalent ) ; for the second one , the place of the colon ( left or right ) indicates what you are defining :, 
  a ) a : = b if b is something you already know/makes complete sense and a is just how you * name it * . 
  b ) a = : b , now a had a meaning in itself and it 's b what you are defining . 
  steam -  cs : go -  properties -  local files -  verify cache integrity ( something like that ), 
  [ this guy ... fuck him :( ] ( http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198013899386/inventory/#730 ), 
  server admins , when choosing options for their match , can configure voice chat in order to be disabled if you die , so it 's not a bug but a * feature * . 
  the armor effect is the same if it is at 100 % or if it is at 10 % . 
  also , you wo n't lose more than 40 armor per round , so it 's safe to rebuy only when it hits ~ 30 . 
  helmet stays as well , even with headshots, 
  then you need some '' ; '' between them ( i.e. 
  * command1 ; command2 ; command 3 '' * ), 
  i think that should work, 
  2 ) back to # 1, 
  ak-47 | red laminate, 
  if you are playing against good players , going with 5-7 all the time will mean getting killed all the time . 
  plot twist : that 's what everyone you play with thinks about you !, 
  try going for :, 
  bind uparrow incrementvar cl_crosshairgap < minimum value  < maximum value  1, 
  bind downarrow incrementvar cl_crosshairgap < minimum value  < maximum value  -1, 
  i 'd say the top 8/16/32 teams in ems one katowice will get something like that in an * esports sticker capsule * . 
  it would really be neat, 
  and cts should play with 25 players because , hey , they 're the army , they can get as many people as you want !, 
  realism !, 
  did you change the < min  and < max  values to your own ? 
  are uparrow/downarrow their actual names ? 
  the minimum and maximum values for the crosshair gap, 
  the 1pixel high gap to watch short from ramp with awp is still there though, 
  inferno and dust2 are now hostage rescue maps, 
   the winner and contestants must be ( ... ) a resident of the united states of america, 
  opening cases is like gambling : no profit . 
  just wait for darude then ^ ( dududududdududu ), 
  only boosters , there is no `` reason '' to ban people being boosted . 
  then , no proof = no crime . 
  yes , i think they 're stupid , but they are just playing with friends , you ca n't prove they paid them to rank up . 
  and even if you could , paying to rank up is n't illegal . 
  i 'd say closest thing is hltv.org , although i do n't think there is a rank of teams . 
  for a list of all the skins : http://csgostash.com/ . 
  you can purchase the skins directly from people , yes . 
  in the same link , click `` search steam market '' under the weapon and it will redirect you to steam market , where you can buy or sell skins with money from your steam wallet . 
  note skins have different qualities , so the better looking ones ( factory new ) are more expensive than the others . 
  no , the skins stay in the quality they started forever . 
  if you buy the skins from the official steam market there is no risk of scam, 
  not really . 
  there are no official leagues sponsored by valve . 
  however , there are big tournaments with valve 's funding ( this week , ems one katowice with 250.000 $ ) , and also leagues featuring top tier teams that do n't receive financial support from valve ( main examples are esea invite league or starladder ), 
  i think it 's one of these :, 
  gameinstructor_enable 1, 
  same here ( although with a mobile graphics card , not that beast ) , it comes and goes all the time and some games are fine . 
  tell me if you find a solution, 
  it was added some weeks ago , and yeah , pirrate be the best addition fer ' sailors, 
  i do n't think you mean what he means . 
  he is talking about your previous ranks , not your way to your next rank . 
  items are given back to their owners, 
  too unstable in my opinion, 
  factory new ? 
  if so , there was a guy offering like 1.5 k $ for it i think ( or was it standard bayonet ? ), 
  pretty surprising , i did n't really think reason 's new lineup would be able to perform as well as the old one did , and they proved me wrong, 
  that 's what i 'd call * a shot of adrenaline after an amazing comeback * . 
  they went and talked to titan guys afterwards , so i do n't see the problem as i do n't think he meant to insult them, 
  i 'd say it 's just trolling . 
  people spam * usa usa * when americans win , they spam * fuck us * when they lose , but they also spam things against other regions ( see the classical * what up now swedes ? 
  whoooo * ), 
  rounds 2 and 3 were just mind-blowing , eight kills in two rounds, 
  in 11 hours and 40 minutes , translate that to your local time, 
  steel should have reported him for sure, 
  people just trolling ( and those who get upset are the ones that feed them ), 
  the smoke kill would be very hard to implement as you ca n't determine whether a player is smoked or not . 
  i do n't think so considering he sits in the far right , whereas most igls sit in the middle, 
  they said that when they lost against virtus.pro old squad almost a year ago . 
  then again when they almost went out of dhs against publiclir.se . 
  and then again after the losses in the finals against verygames in raidcall ems and eswc . 
  and yet again when they lost against fnatic in the finals of dhw ... 
  and here they are , again reaching the finals of the most important cs : go tournament . 
  vp had studied nip a lot , i 'm sure they knew who they were playing against more than the ninjas . 
  and also , i 'd say that , except for the finals , fifflaren had one of his best tournaments, 
  however , there are always small gaps between smokes that you can profit from ( see : smoking yard in nuke can leave places open for an awper to shoot ), 
  pure gold , congrats, 
  look at players and see how they know by heart every single corner of every map . 
  they know the grenades , the smokes , the flashes , the strats , how to plant , how to defend , which angles are safe , where to peek , when to use awp , places to jump to , places to hide ... you ca n't expect pro players to know all those things for ~ 12 different maps, 
  my 6770m works fine ( even though my processor is worse than yours ) , giving around ~ 80 constant fps . 
  i do n't think you 'll have problems,
