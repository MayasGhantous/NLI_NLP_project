  i have other binds for voice messages . 
  also , i do n't fail at taking out knife , and can also press 3 as usual . 
  and well , i am happy with my binds , and they work for me . 
  also , pretty much everything in this game is personal preference , i 'm not silver and i think default setup is extremely bad . 
  i think we were missing the fact that meta has apparently changed and train is now even slightly t-sided if you play it well . 
  virtus.pro was wrecking the ninjas as terrorists , but on the second half nip showed they know really way how to play train 's t-side . 
   additionally i personally believe that there is a direct correlation between the production value and the future possible sponsors willing to put in money for future events as the main basis for them to support e-sports tournaments is essentially the viewer count . 
  fragbite masters is a great example : they now have solid sponsors , with personalized ads , a huge fanbase waiting for their third edition , a lot of viewers during their last matches , fantastic appreciation of their work by the community ... and it 's * just * an online tournament . 
  i think it 's people playing more and more , and trying new stats ( like the rush to plant in a with nobody dying ) . 
  it 's like nuke 's wallbangs : everybody used to think they were impossible , but lately nip has been showing a lot of work in several places . 
  as time passes more strats , spots , nades , and meta will appear,

  * shut up faggot *, 
  max is 68 afaik, 
  check [ this ] ( http://www.twitch.tv/copenhagengamescs/b/521174672?t=691m55s ) for de_dust2 , the rest of the match is just before in the same vod . 
  you know what is childish ? 
  having those 2 options . 
  is it so hard to just put yes/no and accept people 's opinion ? 
   utting the hacker and his friend in a 2v5 every round which should get the game to ? -15, 
  a hacker can really easily kill all 5 enemies by himself, 
  calling you out / u/bigjsc2 . 
  do you even understand was guardian was complaining about ? 
  then , as your rank is determined by the ranks of the people you play with/against , they 'd have to recalculate everyone in their matches , then every match involving someone in a hacker match , then everyone involved in a game with someone involved in a game with a hacker and so on and so forth . 
  believe me , that grows really quick . 
  [ hellraisers ] ( http://www.hltv.org/?pageid=179&amp;teamid=5310&amp;eventid=0&amp;gameid=2 ) and [ reason ] ( http://www.hltv.org/?pageid=179&amp;teamid=5208&amp;eventid=0&amp;gameid=2 ) . 
  they generally have all the stats , but they are really hidden . 
  do n't search for teams at stats page , look for one of their players instead and in the player profile they 'll have a link to its current team . 
  ( no homo ), 
  hl3 confirmed, 
  based on pro feedback, 
  i would like to have a nip vs 5 global elites game just to prove they can 16-0 them and ranks do n't mean anything in competitive cs, 
  + kqly , i love his awping, 
  wait is n't kqly already in ldlc ? 
  kqly + shox + apex + maniac + happy ( although i 'd love to see kioshima as well , but both maniac and happy are great players ), 
  do n't run through smokes, 
  are they in different lines ? 
  also , i 'm not sure if you are using the right names for weapons ; i think you should use, 
  bind x `` buy weapon_m4a1 '', 
  ehem , the whole idea of being disrespectful begins from the fact that you should not insult those who are worse than you . 
  exploit : make all weapons horribly big and you 'll easily be able to see your enemies, 
  4 - it happened already , that 's why f0rest is playing from jail,

  i 'd much rather go for head armor + p250, 
  iirc walking with knife is 250 u/s whereas walking with any grenade is 245 u/s . 
  there 's a difference , but not a big one, 
  i do think it will be alliance , yes . 
  sir scoots , who used to work with eg , has mentioned some times that they have shown interest in picking up a cs : go team , and them being so closely related to [ a ] , i really think it is a strong option . 
  also i 'd love to see how far can lgb get with such a big organization . 
  * at faceit 's twitch channel *, 
  ** sirscoots ** : hey i went to bed and sk was teasing an announcement and since i am lazy , did they announce a cs team ?

  then people would kick each other all the time because it would be better to have a bot you can control, 
  it is intentional , so it does n't stick further than other knifes and ca n't be easier/harder to see, 
  there is a last `` tick '' after the red line disappears , so it was n't actually defused yet, 
  he 's not doing giveaways because they are n't in twitch . 
  he is doing giveaways in a completely independent page that just asks you to log in with your twitch account , which is n't forbidden, 
  i do n't think they will be hiding if they are terrorists , plus if i am ct in a buy round i just take my m4 , go to a site and wait until someone walks into my crosshair to start shooting . 
  not a big difference tbh, 
  i 'd love to see the guys from dk winning as the dota they are playing right now is outstanding when compared to others ... * but * at the same time i 'd like to see eg winning to have an american ti winner, 
  that 's only for tournaments tho , it does n't include partnerships for example . 
  f0rest ( from cs 1.6 and cs : go ) has supposedly earned more than 700k $ , so the figures might be way higher for other esports . 
  still , 520.000 $ is just a sick figure, 
  it 's not heavily ct-sided in my opinion ( not like train or nuke for example ) . 
  9-6 would be a respectable score for cts, 
  top lel, 
  nobody ever said dhs would be a `` sponsored '' tournament . 
  dreamhack winter will get money from valve and surely another tournament in between will as well . 
  i just think valve does n't want to give that much money only to dreamhacks, 
  why are so many people * mad * at bts for singing the anthem without being serious ? 
  is it `` disrespectful '' towards the country or what ? 
  [ the * actual * prize ] ( http://dev.dstadvisors.ru/bp/uploads/photo409.jpg ) is also gorgeous . 
  apparently that prize is awarded in several categories ( pretty much like nobel i guess ) , life sciences being one of them, 
  * we fucking lost yeeeeeeeahhhhhhh *, 
  dota 's sea and australian servers are down too ( and have been for a lot of hours now ) , there are some serious problems in their servers i guess, 
  clearly natus vincere ( it 's from latin , meaning * born to win * ), 
  try :, 
  mp_maxmoney 1000, 
  mp_startmoney 1000, 
  mp_afterroundmoney 1000, 
  i 'm not sure but i those work server-side . 
  maybe someone else can tell how to force the server to load a certain configuration, 
  try :, 
  bind f `` use weapon_knife ; use weapon_flashbang ; buy flashbang '', 
  bind c `` use weapon_knife ; use weapon_smokegrenade ; buy smokegrenade '', 
  bind x `` use weapon_knife ; use weapon_hegrenade ; buy hegrenade '', 
  bind z `` use weapon_knife ; use weapon_molotov ; use weapon_incgrenade ; buy molotov ; buy incgrenade '', 
  it will buy one and select one if you have it . 
  maybe garrison takes some time , but you can insta-garrison when you are dead so when you come back you are already there ? 
   not 100 % sure what causes this . 
  there is no difference in spanish between the pronunciation of * b * and * v * , both sound like english * b *, 
  they do hear what is said in this subreddit , as well as other forums like hltv . 
  however , their * policy * is not to directly address the community , so it is unlikely that they 'll answer in the threads ( although they do sometimes , vitaliy iirc ),
