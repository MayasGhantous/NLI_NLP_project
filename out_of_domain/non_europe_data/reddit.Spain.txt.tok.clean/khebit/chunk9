  for the braces : * \\ left \\ { * and * \\ right \\ } * should work, 
  [ theoretically ] ( http://www.fundeu.es/consulta/pronunciacion-de-las-letras-bv-e-yll-852/ ) they are pronounced the same , but there are a lot of differences between spanish in spain and in south america . 
  it is true that in south america ( at least in some countries like argentina ) they tend to pronounce the * v * as an * f * , so that might be the reason why they pronounce them correctly in english . 
   i expect decades of constant laughs and reminders . 
  in a 2v1 i do n't recall having seen it , but a 15-3 4v1 bomb planted 15 seconds ago ... it 's not they do n't trust him , because he might be telling them that it 's impossible , it 's just being realist ; those rounds tipically are n't won by a team but lost by the other, 
  if you throw a nade you automatically switch to your primary . 
  by taking out the knife you can avoid the primary animation , and can throw one grenade after another faster . 
  and because there 's a bind for the nade afterwards , you wo n't even see the knife, 
   please do n't tell him i think he 's a slimeball . 
  why ? 
  would n't you like to try parachuting ? 
   the only one i could see sneaking up on him ( and i very much hope this happens ) is varys . 
  i ca n't see varys in the throne because i do n't think he would be supported , for one reason : he has ( and wo n't have i guess ) no heir . 
  so , if he reigns , i guess it will be with the support of someone and with the promise of reigning after him or something, 
  world would implode, 
  can any * expert * in the french cs scene give me his honest opinion about his addition ? 
  song name ? 
  and how can that be less challenging ? 
  more like * choose between good servers and bad servers *, 
  f0rest said once that he wanted their enemies to hear him so they could focus him instead of his teammates .

  if you asked `` do you want to remove forever cs : go and source to make 1.6 the only counter-strike ? '', 
  they would surely vote yes . 
  what does the b in * beno\u00eet b. mandelbrot * stand for ? 
  another version i really like :, 
   there are 10 types of people in the world : those who understand binary , those who do n't , and those who do n't expect this to be a base-3 joke . 
  i prefer the system of having several majors ( 250 000 $ ) funded by the community throughout the year , maybe even one in na . 
  what i hate from ti is the fact that top1 to top4 get so much many whereas top 9 to top 18 get nothing , which makes it harder for some teams to stick together . 
  i 'd prefer 5 teams winning a lot instead of having a na'vi - like team getting rich as fuck just from a win and two top2 finishes ( and do n't get me wrong , i love puppey and na'vi ) . 
  well this one is actually true lol ( [ news in spanish from europapress ] ( http://www.europapress.es/chance/gente/noticia-cristiano-ronaldo-corazon-oro-pagarle-operacion-erik-nino-afectado-displasia-cortical-20140313114649.html ) ), 
  apparently it was some kind of experimental treatment that could n't be performed in spain and was n't covered by spanish social security, 
  smokes , split through mid . 
  smokes . 
  smoke , and flashes towards a site . 
  additionally , get two guys to go from short so they ca n't focus at a single place . 
  you have to increase the digital vibrance in your nvidia control panel .

  more like `` look , there 's a pro player streaming but he only has 50 % of what a woman showing her boobs and not even playing has ! '',

  the spoilers were false !!! '', 
  and then ... :(, 
  it looks like proving the product of four succesive numbers is divided by 24, 
  water comes out with sandstorm 's rhythm dudududu, 
  he means head armor ( buy kevlar at pistol round and head armor at second if you have n't received damage ), 
  carries trilane feeding, 
  mods , video makers , additional view for spectators , as far as your imagination can go, 
  my mouse does the same , and it 's because of the mouse ( it does the same in desktop and other mice work fine for cs ) . 
  so ... it definitely might be a hardware problem, 
  newton knew so much about electricity and did n't share it ? 
  what a douchebag !, 
  in seville it is common for places to only have paella one day of the week ( mainly sundays ) , and they are nice . 
  so yes , if they have it always it might not be too good, 
   me and some other guy get kicked cuz we shot them, 
  fix yourself, 
   but i heard that it 's primarily win/loss that matter, 
  * lies * , pretty much nothing is known about elo system , people have hypotheses but they might or might not be true, 
  i think i 've played once maybe in an edited version of dust2 in a public server that had that part indeed , but it is just a modified version of the actual map, 
  merlini drafted * divided we stand *, 
  the title is clearly missing a * kappa *, 
   the player base for the game , especially over the past year has exploded . 
  the problem is , the player base is mostly european and american as well , whereas in dota2 you have tons of chinese and sea teams . 
  so , an `` international '' would end up being a mostly european event just like current 250k $ majors, 
  `` actually , andersen was black , but he has been whitewashed by the white-hetero-cis-capitalist-mason-illuminati-patriarchy !! '', 
  i just ca n't even imagine the cons of such a relationshio,

  try faceit , altpug or leetway . 
  maybe even cevo will allow you to pug ... or , just matchmake .

  ** tl ; dr ** they were really happy with wizards club , but og offered them a lot more of options , and they chose to leave for higher budget to compete in europe and be dedicated full-time . 
   this thorin guy he seriously just sounds like a problem .

  just ... thorin . 
  spain here , i pronounce it as * log * even though i commonly write * ln *,

  [ s1e10 ] ( #s `` i kinda miss khal drogo though :( '' ), 
  fnatic is playing too agressive in my opinion . 
  jw pushing with awp , the 3-man-down-banana as ct getting picked one by one ... more passivity and they could be 11-4, 
  are you calling thorin , a legend of e-sports , a `` random ginger '' ? 
  lol, 
  yes there is , and it is actually one of the best ways to catch a cheater because they show themselves, 
  thorin is probably the best analyst you can find because of all his knowledge from years working in e-sports , understanding of players/teams motivations ... but he 's not a good caster . 
  he gives no emotion to the cast . 
  he 's in a 1v1 and starts talking about how good whoever is in that kind of situations or how that makes him remember another situation . 
  at the post-match analyst desk he is the best there is , yes , but i do n't really like him as a caster, 
  lol , post pics when you have the result , and gratz !, 
  jumpy played out of his mind , congrats to f3 !, 
  [ my humble opinion ] ( #s '' = ddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd '' ), 
  the story advanced a shitton . 
  [ s4e10 ] ( #s `` stannis comes back from braavos , mance is captured , wall is safe , bran finds the 3-eyed crow in a curious way , hound ( or not ? 
  ) , brienne finds arya , she leaves to braavos , cersei says she 's not marrying loras , tywin = gg , jaime helps tyrion , tyrion escapes with the help of varys who goes with him ( i would n't want to stay either ... ) sooo much into a single episode ! '' ), 
  maybe what it missed is something epic as an ending . 
  although that last scene with the music ... wonderful, 
  if you were selling them , could you advertise us via pm though ? 
  my intentions are to start from book one now . 
  to be honest when i re-watch scenes from season 1 i ca n't really remember them , so i guess going back to the beginning is the best choice, 
  as a non-book reader who has been spoiled , i 'll tell you [ ( no actual spoiler ) ] ( #s `` they saved a huuuuge thing for next season even though it should belong to this one '' ), 
  he was seeing the ship off ... until he hears the bells .
