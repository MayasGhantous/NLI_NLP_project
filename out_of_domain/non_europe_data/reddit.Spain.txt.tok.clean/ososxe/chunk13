  i kinda see aalst as florida when it comes to weirdos, 
  i 've done that , but hidden in between . 
  fuck the law !, 
  we 're taking pics every day/every 2 days , to document how quick the wet areas on the beams spread . 
  i do n't mind being a member of that club ... but in hindsight we should have bought a newer house, 
  the ice forms from the perspiration and humidity that the house and us exhudes . 
  it goes up and condenses on that spot . 
  at least that what they told us . 
  it kinda makes sense , as it only happens on the side of the roof that is on the shadow the whole day now in winter . 
  we had some days of heavy rain right after the work was finished and there was n't any leaks , i do n't htink the water/humidity comes from outside, 
  thanks !, 
  i 'm on the other side , closer to ninove than to brussels, 
  is it reposting if is on https://www.reddit.com/r/brussels/comments/5q93us/game_of_brussels/ ? 
   it 's cyclocross ... 
  in the us . 
  you do n't see that in belgium . 
  i give you that , your style looks more fun . 
  however , some of the crowds here could give you a rub for your money on the drunk front, 
  well , this is cx after all . . 
  some examples https://youtu.be/7qsizem6wxa https://youtu.be/6vtvqbs7p-u, 
  have in mind that most of the elite races finish around 3 pm , and there are races ( and music and beers ) since maybe 11 am ... 
  looking is what i do best . 
  thank you for those amazing pictures, 
  looking good for me , using ublock/chrome, 
  always offer less than the price stated in the ad . 
  always . 
  you know more than me on that field , so i trust your word . 
  but they will not talk , only write, 
  depends on his hard they smash the keyboard, 
  i 'm binge reading the expanse books . 
  great series . 
  there 's 5 books and 5-6 minor stories . 
  i 'm happy i read it on my kindle , 
  the tv version is also really good , but it does not follow the books 100 % ( and that 's fine for me ), 
  ready player one is a quick read , not sure when the movie is out , but unless is out in a month , i think you 'll be done with it before it happens . 
  saw the documentary and reminded me of some cases we had some years ago back in spain : a few imams that were preaching how to hit your wife without leaving any mark and things like that , they were expelled from the country . 
  sean young in fucktards , first antihero video, 
  i do n't think so , every other pic and video show him with the same stance, 
  p50 is aimed at developers , is a beast and quite heavy . 
  if you plan to carry it home daily or travel , try to get the carbon, 
  technical lead, 
  international company, 
  having to learn lots of new things to work with this company, 
  artificial intelligence applied to the healthcare field is very promising, 
  we are now ibm, 
  ** cons : **, 
  my managers are based in ny and india , so more times that i would like i end having calls with them when i 'm supposed to be done with my day , or working until late at night because something needs to be fixed/updated, 
  dealing with our indian-based contracted developers can be a pain sometimes, 
  we are now ibm, 
  * edit : format *, 
  like [ this ] ( https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3121849/foto%209-2-17%2011%2026%2046.jpg ), 
  is cramped as hell . 
  i need to get me a trackball to save some space, 
  2 laptops . 
  migration from old one ( left , before acquisition ) to new one ( right , post acquisition ), 
  did n't thought about the dual usb plug , i have one already , that makes the set up easier , thanks !, 
  what about other banks ? 
  i hope if someone from this subreddit got the tickets , that appears on tv with a / r/belgium banner, 
  the have an aisle for school and office supplies, 
  i never cared much for my cars . 
  i had a twingo for 10 years that had it 'd own micro natural environment . 
  but never thrower trash from my car into the roadside, 
  i do n't know , truckers can always stop at a service station , and for illegal workers i guess that would be construction materials , but what i see more are cans , bottles , etc. 
  but whoever it is , is a disgrace, 
  are you sure ? 
  is the only explanation i find to the beer cans on the roadsides at the highway exits or at smaller country roads . 
  yeah , you pay by weight when you go to the container park to recycle , but is not that much , i think i usually pay less than 2 $ for 25 kilos or so . 
  and what you see on the roadsides are cans or bottles or regular trash that you can leave on bags at your door and they pick it for free . 
  are you sure ? 
  maybe is because i can only compare flemish tv to spanish tv , but for me it has been an improvement . 
  less ads ( really , the bigger channels in spain cut scenes mid-sentences to insert ad blocks that might be 15 minutes long ) , and everything is dubbed . 
  own productions are bland as they want to target all audiences at the same time . 
  and there 's nothing like canvas in spain . 
  love that channel . 
  laptop , lenovo p50 or macbook pro, 
  probably . 
  it was now we try to keep it average clean , in and out, 
  an aeropress might be even cheaper , and is easier than a french press, 
  i use moka pot at home , aeropress is what i use at my job for how easy is to use and clean , and is very easy to.get a good cup of coffee with it, 
  in our case the boiker is ina small storage area under the stairs , with a door . 
  the kitchen is 4-5 meters away , there 's no door at the kitchen . 
  would it be better to put the nest in the boiler room under the stairs , or in the kitchen as close to the boiler as possible ? 
  you got ta love the cobbles . 
  is the law . 
  my first times were `` well , cobbles are not that bad , i kinda like them '', 
  then i tried them uphill `` ugh ... they are kinda bad , but i still can do it '', 
  and when i mixed cobbles , rain and tight turns : `` ouch !!, 
  shit , cobbles hurt a lot when you fall !!, 
  rain and cobbles do n't mix well , at least my bike is ok '', 
  they might have to pay any healthcare expenses beforehand , though, 
  i binge watched the first season , looking forward to the second , but for what is shown on the teaser , they are drifting a bit apart from the books ( that 's not bad per se ), 
  since yesterday , i 'm on a [ integrity - systems overload ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_r5pxkx1x4 ) mood , listening to that song a lot . 
  shit , i missed being in a band , loved to sing integrity covers . 
  when i moved to belgium i thought i would go to lots of shows . 
  now with a peuter i do n't have much time , and most of them are fridays either at roeselare or hasselt . 
  driving from liedekerke puts me off a bit , but i 'm so looking forward for madball in opwijk, 
  i go to ieperfest , not the 3 days as before , but at least one day, 
  yes , for sure, 
  i do n't wait for that , i scroll to [ the right moment ] ( https://youtu.be/d2pgg-a2ij4 ), 
  almost ... my original intention was [ this ] ( https://youtu.be/d2pgg-a2ij4?t=2m42s ),
