  price difference is more around 5-7000 $ , but in those conditions it might not be worthy . 
  and now that i think of it , i find it odd that some models have heated seats and steering wheel , belgium winters are not * that * hard , right ? 
  we were thinking about the state versions of hyundai i30 , kia c ` eed or ford focus , but my wife thinks that they are to big , so now we 're looking into skoda fabia combi , seat ibiza st , peugeot 2008 , etc , ... 
  but from dealerships those models fall into our budget then . 
  we have a baby and we need the boot space . 
  our current car is peugeot 206 sw that is getting to old now, 
  ... and i thought that this reddit included also moto x 2013 ... 
  i think transport , but i 'm in a situation very similar to you , it 's all new to me . . 
  i go yearly to ieper , i still have to visit the trenches , but the in flanders fields museum is a must !, 
  this must be the 2nd or 3rd update that app got in the last 4-5 months ... so yeah , not counting on the update anytime soon , sadly, 
  madrid , spain . 
  i 'm from madrid , what can i say . . :-) and there 's more spots that do n't appear on that promo , check the welcome video , must be on this subreddit somewhere . 
  bilbao has a lot of great skateparks , too . 
  and malaga is a hidden gem . 
  ( edit : here 's the welcome shop video , most of the spots are madrid , a few us ones , and the rest is all around spain https://vimeo.com/48842217 ), 
  ugh . . that swellbow . . we 're not that young anymore , are n't we ? 
  from spain , now living in belgium . 
  trick names are the same , mostly . 
  in madrid some of my friends said the right name , some said an approximate pronunciation of it , such as `` tailes '' for tailslide . 
  from my experience on previous years , if you go to a lesser know puerto de monta\u00f1a ( mountain top ) , you can drive and park with a few hours in advance . 
  if you go to some of the most famous ones , you might need to go really early as there 's hundreds or thousands of people going there . 
  if you 're looking for some non-edible gift , i 'd go to [ taller puntera ] ( http://www.puntera.com ) , at plaza conde de barajas , great leather artisans , not expensive , and you can find great wallets , handbags , etc. 
  i 've used [ bike citizens ] ( http://www.bikecitizens.net/ ) and [ ride the city ] ( http://www.ridethecity.com ) , they have a limited number of cities , but their planning seems to be on point , taking in account speed , safety , etc. 
  have n't used [ cycle route ] ( http://www.cycleroute.org/ ) , but my coworker likes it a lot . 
  i 've a pair of [ assos insulator ] ( http://redkiteprayer.com/2012/12/assos-early-winter-and-insulator-gloves/ ) , they are discontinued but perhaps there 's some leftover stock somewhere online . 
  they are meant to be worn under winter gloves as first layer , but can be used on their own . 
  they have no padding and i 've used them on rainy days around 8\u00ba-13\u00bac and my fingers did n't went numb . 
  have n't used them over 15\u00bac , so not sure if they might get too hot when over that . 
  [ lean ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1zffwoalf4 ) , but even sometimes [ it does not help ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nqm_38oovo ), 
  tech support here , i work at the european hq of an american company and one of the first things they told me is that i 'm free to organize my time as i need , s long as my work gets done . 
  but as i 'm part of a team , i have to do my shift , but is never more than 38 hours per week . 
  eu unlocked version, 
  i have the [ tubus fly evo ] ( http://www.tubus.com/product.php?xn=27 ), 
  it holds my pannier good , unobstrusive , and good looking . 
  lbs mechanic praised me a few times for it , even if i did n't bought the bike in their shop . 
  if you want to try something different , try the beans sold in local roasters like [ la mexicana ] ( http://www.lamexicana.es/ ) ) 1890 suave is my favorite ) or [ caf\u00e9s pozo ] ( http://www.cafespozo.es/ ) , or the coffee sold at [ toma caf\u00e9 ] ( http://www.tomacafe.es/ ), 
  probably not . 
  depending when my phone dies , and i hope it last long , i would go for a sony zperia zsomething , xiaomi or nexus . 
  i worked at fon.com , proximus had nothing to do with the portal but providing their logos and implementing the fon api, 
  oh yeah , that portal will only load when connected to a proximus_fon hotspot , so no bother loading it . 
  one more vote for mobile vikings as pay as you go , cheap and good service . 
  visit / [ tribu urbana ] ( http://www.triburbanashop.com ) at bordadores 6 , is downtown , very close to sol . 
  they can tell you if there 's any party , open mic , battle , show , etc. 
  13 days `` amazon sale '', 
  in gent there 's several across town , with the benefit of just pressing a button http://www.mobiliteitgent.be/met-de-fiets/nog-meer-fietsinfo/openbare-fietspompen, 
  the one closest to my home pump up to 100 psi , more or less . 
  not sure the others . 
  for the city bike , more than enough . 
  for the road bike , is not optimum , but not bad neither . 
  yesterday i saw a man using the pump to fill his inflatable pool . . and it was n't a small one , 
  i use strava , free version , is all i need to know if i did it better or worse on a segement , i do n't care about koms . 
  in the past i 've used endomondo , but i do n't like it as much as strava, 
  try to ride earliy in the morning and as late at night as possible/safe . 
  use sunblock spf 50 . 
  stop often . 
  use sports drink such as gatorade , aquarius , etc. 
  did i say hidrate ? 
  all that / u/seemsfine2me and / u/j1mjam2112 said , plus put water on your head and neck whenever you have the chance . 
  my girl and i did a 40-50 km route some years ago back in spain , hottest day of the year , 42-44 degrees ( before anyone asks why : because it was the only day we both could do it ) . 
  we rested in the shadows as much as we could , drank lots of water ( but no eletrolytes , it would have helped to carry some ) , and put our heads and caps and tshirts underwater whenever we had the chance . 
  still , it was one of the hardest days on a bike for me . 
  i 've used eltiempo.es back in madrid , never thought it could be useful over here . 
  shame their app is ( was ? ), 
  so ugly ... 
  yeah , i forgot to add that i use that . 
  is mostly spot-on . 
  i 've used also rain alarm , highly recommendable . 
  thanks , will check that out !, 
  thanks , will bookmark them !, 
  stupid , sexy fans of flanders . . 
  that 's why i 'm happy with the spanish national anthem lyrics , 
  i speak some dutch , but my girl is flemish , so what i do n't understand she does \u263a . 
  we plan on checking all the main banks , but i wonder if different branches of the same bank can offer different conditions, 
  thanks !, 
  will check when on my computer later tonight, 
  so you had to relearn the language ? 
  thanks !, 
  1 : those are my thoughts sheet comparing the online simulations from this month 's with the ones i did a month ago . 
  only checked fixed rate , not sure if variable or mixed is worth it with the actual situation . 
  2 : we just moved our savings back from spain to our belgian bank ( rate was marginally better in spain for savings ) . 
  we both have fixed contracts at good companies ( american and belgian multinationals ) , and what i think is a good salary , not big , though . 
  no debts , a son , and family help if needed . . o hope they give us anything under 3 % at least, 
  now , for the important questions about liedekerke :, 
  what are the best bakery , pizza , burger , caf\u00e9 and frituur ? 
  thanks !, 
  knowing that , and that there 's a small skatepark and good cycling routes , i think liedekerke and i will get along fine, 
  thanks !, 
  i got my trusty kryptonite ulock from when i lived in madrid , as long as i lock it better than the next bike i should be safe . 
  we will move in november , so i 'll go to the park only in the weekends with daylight anyway.i 'm used to shady figures , but thanks for the warning !, 
  post pictures , i will translate, 
  as long as the keyboard has the correct mapping for what you 're used to . . , 
  it was my first event , i thought i was not prepared for it . 
  never made more than 50 km ( and that was weeks ago ) , and my average speed was 24-25 kms tops . 
  i thought i was going to suffer , but it went easier than i expected , even the cobbled sectors . 
  64 kms ( strava stole the first ones ) might not be such a big distance , but for me it is ( or should i say it was ? ), 
  thanks / u/sp4m / u/vectorbug / u/s3rious _ simon / u/ilivefortaquitos and / u/legitgangster-not for the encouraging words the days before !!, 
  now , should i do a 70-ish hilly kms one in 2 weeks ? 
  i 'm bored of flat rides . .  i have some hills not too far , though , but what i really miss is real mountains, 
  i do , is jsut that the flat rides are closer home and sometimes i only have 1 hour or so . 
  and when i take the hilly route is about 110 meters for 40 or 50 km,
