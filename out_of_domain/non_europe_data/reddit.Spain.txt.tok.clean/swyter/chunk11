  one year later i 'm halfway jlpt 1 ( kanji list ) just by being constant . 
  the downside is that i have n't studied much grammar yet . 
  i prefer _ ` playing pictionary ' _ . 
  i have installed it in tablets and small phones , and the big surface _ really _ seems to improve the calligraphy accuracy due to the improved touchscreen resolution and finger movement . 
  but yeah , the functionality is still not perfect for complex shapes . 
  there 's a small button in the backlog to mark them as correct and report your take to the developer , too . 
  anyway , i think it 's the best all-in-one learning tool , and i 'm very picky with these things . 
  with the amount of crapware in the app stores these days finding this kind of quality for free is getting hard . 
  if you want to sound a bit patronizing and approach the situation inoffensively and humorously you can say : _ `` \u00a1 venga , a correr ! '' _ or _ `` \u00a1 vete a tomar viento ! '' _, 
  latest _ vmware player _ ( which is free , money-wise ) + [ this neat mac os x patcher/unlocker ] ( https://github.com/drdonk/unlocker ) . 
  i have an amd processor , so i tried to install mavericks with a custom kernel in virtualbox and it just did n't install correctly , it got stuck . 
  vmware actually is the only software that supports guest tools/additions in mac os x , which improve a lot the general usability . 
  screen auto-resizing is a life-saver , and there 's clipboard integration . 
  no 3d pass-through acceleration in os x , though . 
  using vmware in linux is not pretty but works . 
  i would n't recommend it for anything else where virtualbox does the trick . 
  i really like vbox for hosting linux and windows guests . 
  yeah , these adapted songs are pretty neat . 
  the only thing i do n't like is that they often change some of the lyrics for no reason . 
  for example , i do n't know why they switched `` que es mi dios _ la _ libertad '' into `` que es mi dios _ mi _ libertad '' . 
  there 's a world of difference between the individualistic ( and selfish ) take of the group and the original claim to universal freedom in the original poem . 
  rubs me in the wrong way . 
  i think we can all agree that espronceda is a much better lyrist . 
  i remember reading it aloud in my _ lengua espa\u00f1ola _ class and the powerful musicality gave us goosebumps . 
  it 's like the spanish-language counterpart to william ernest henley 's _ invictus _ . 
  something like this ? 
  you can probably find one of those cheaper somewhere else . 
  they are not exactly rare gems , even my high-school had a bunch of them . 
  if you are a good typist you can just ignore your current keyboard 's key labels and work with the spanish layout full time , as the keys are all positioned the same . 
  the spanish keyboard is mostly a superset of the english one . 
  _ ps _ : the funny thing is that we non-us it people ( while installing things like linux via command-line ) are almost forced to learn the opposite ; memorizing how a bunch of symbols ( like # ~ / \\ , . - _ [ ] ) are supposed to map into the en-us layout so that we can use things like bootloaders in the boot shell . 
  it 's not fun , there 's a lot of trial and error involved . 
  spot on . 
  i tried to combat this problem with my own texture pack : https://forums.dolphin-emu.org/thread-sphinx-and-the-cursed-mummy%e2%84%a2-hd-texture-pack, 
  * no high definition textures for tiling surfaces or low poly models . 
  * extra effort in 2d elements , text , interface elements and decals . 
  * only redraw the lowest of the lowest . 
  avoid anything disruptive . 
  some screenies :, 
  i think tasteful mods are still doable . 
  they take much more effort , though . 
  well , it 's unfinished . 
  the problem with textures is that they depend on _ how _ they are mapped to 3d models . 
  the geometry , texture mapping , vertex coloring and shape of a mesh is _ just _ as important as the texture definition it sports . 
  in the same way that painted abs in a fat man look out of place . 
  nintendo has it easy because it has access to the models and the original ( higher quality ) source art assets . 
  they also do n't just update the textures , they fix the seams , improve the geometry , lighting , particle effects and animation . 
  i work with the limitations i have . 
  it 's easier to see the seams and discontinuities in more detailed textures . 
  i ca n't fix that . 
  sometimes lower resolution is better because leaves more to the imagination . 
  i certainly prefer to leave it as-is when my variant is not substantially better/out of place . 
  texture packs should be there to improve legibility , not to make doom look like crysis . 
  i think there 's just a lot of language friction and social inertia going on here . 
  is your spanish alright ? 
  were they talking in galician ? 
  most americans have a * different * cultural notion of how social encounters should be approached . 
  the warm-up time and ice-breaking cues are not as similar as you would think . 
  specially in large groups of people that already have their own dynamics ... and that makes you stick out until you get accepted . 
  maybe they are just not confident with their english or they think you are uneasy , apathetic and introverted and they let you alone , falling back and isolating yourself in an english bubble will make you appear even more awkward . 
  next time just try to be more forward and approachable , and try to enter the conversation early on so that they know you want to be there . 
  they probably could instinctively know that you were uneasy in the same way that same feeling oozes out your text . 
  you might think you are hiding your social cues well , but we are very sharp with that kind of thing . 
  ** edit ** : also , there might be just a teeny bit of culture shock there . 
  galicia is less touristy than other parts of spain , that does n't mean they will look at your like an alien , but they ( maybe ) just do n't know how to proceed in a more intimate ( 1v1 ) environment if your communication skills are not up to par . 
  i can tell you that even the most awkward kid in a spanish school has more social prowess than the usa equivalent . 
  it 's not just the compiler . 
  _ - w64 _ has updated headers and up-to-date crt components . 
  counterintuitively it lets you target both _ i386 _ and _ x86_64 _ architectures under windows . 
  if you want to cross-compile from linux there is no alternative in most official distro repositories . 
  go with the fork . 
  manual downloads and nightly patches ( in the same vein as _ the last days _ ) should come relatively soon \u2122 . 
  _ edit _ : there you go -  https://swconquest.github.io/, 
  even better , i 'll make a download page just like this one : https://tldmod.github.io, 
  downloads on moddb have to be sent manually , screened and put on hold for a day . 
  at the rate we want to push updates that just wo n't work . 
  add to that people not reading which files are the most current ones or how to install them properly and you 'll arrive at my little conundrum . 
  the workshop is neat because solves most of my distribution problems . 
  it came in handy for doing a private beta until a few days ago . 
  i 'm working alone for the time being , add to that that i have my own things to do + fixing the mod itself + community engagement , so sorting all into something manageable will take a while . 
  stay tuned . 
  as someone said before , right now it 's in the workshop because that just makes it easier for me for improving stuff , allows me to iterate quickly in a single place , with everyone getting the latest stuff minutes after things get implemented and with almost instant feedback . 
  now think about what happens with manual downloads , with people trailing behind reporting problems that have already been solved . 
  organizing all that is a chore , specially when things are still a bit unstable , this is the second week after the port . 
  also , setting up the manual patches takes time away from actually working on the mod . 
  i do n't want to make it ` exclusive ' or anything . 
  it 's just too early , manual patches will force me to do an initial release with many defects . 
  if i post it in moddb many people will just download that file without learning to patch it properly . 
  third party pages will start to host it for polish , french , russian and chinese players without asking for permission and leaving them permanently stuck in that revision . 
  believe me , you can put as many giant red blinking warnings as you want . 
  people go for the download button without reading anything else . 
  but they do have time to post a entitled comment detailing in explicit detail why my mom sucks and this mod is buggy compost . 
  ah , the joys of modding games for free ; all the cons and none of the pros . 
  for nightlies you basically need three files : _ the base game for m&b 1.011 _ + _ the little warband patch that makes it compatible with the game _ + _ the latest nightly patch _ . 
  you download them and extract them in order in the same place , replacing any previous files . 
  if you visit https://tldmod.github.io every now and then you can see if there 's a newer nightly and extract it right over any older nightly you had installed . 
  you only need those three files the first time , after that is just stacking nightlies over nightlies . 
  sounds easy to me !, 
  swc will have the same thing .
