  this has more to do about how chrome/webkit triggers the callbacks . 
  i 've found out that firefox does n't suffer from this and you do n't even heard the very first second ( s ) . 
  something i used to do to _ fix _ it is to keep the chrome tab always active in a separate window . 
  seems like chrome gives lower priority to scripts in hidden tabs to save processing power . 
  i know that one is n't normally looking at the page while listening . 
  tell me if works for you too . 
  alternatively , running my extension in firefox may be even better . 
  the workflow is sensibly worse than in transifex . 
  for example , while in crowdin you can only suggest , in transifex any can replace the current unreviewed string , there 's always a historic log with diffs , so that the reviewer can take a look and revert if needed . 
  now it is more about `` suggesting '' , voting and watching how only half of your strings are accepted . 
  with a lot of wasted effort , instead of improving on other people 's work . 
  transifex has a client for pulling and deploying easily , too . 
  bad move , reddit . 
  if some people were having trouble with the older site , then they may not have been the ideal translators . 
  i have lost my interest , that 's for sure . 
  i take part in another good deal of open source projects which are nicely centralized in transifex and works wonders . 
  thanks for appealing to the lowest common denominator !, 
  just look at the site and the general tone , if not , you just can take a look to its demographics . 
  nowadays even the formerly formal microsoft is starting to translate their products informally , instead of going down the '' _ usted _ '' or '' _ haga _ '' route . 
  reddit uses a young and playful tone . 
  so , take note and contextualize . 
  the thing is , vandalism does n't really matter when you have all the previous strings just down there , ready to replace and diff with a click , anyone can contribute and improve on . 
  and the strings are n't going to be published until someone reviews it anyway . 
  it 's just like wikipedia . 
  imagine that instead of improving on somebody 's else article all of you would be working in parallel to '' _ suggest _ '' and only one of these would be the final . 
  it 's more about competition than collaboration , and sometimes the voting is n't even fair . 
  that 's why i like transifex better , is less about privileges and more about contributing revisions freely without somebody dictating and abusing of their rank , whereas the grunt translators do n't have much power . 
  it 's rare to find people wanting to intentionally sabotage translations . 
  i 've coordinated rather big projects like _ megaglest _ or _ 0 a.d. _ and i can tell you that the noise ratio is negligible , sub-par translators can be talked to and given hints to improve , and even a bad translator can slightly improve a bad translation or correct other people 's mistakes . 
  works well for me , and people tend to correct my errors too . 
  that 's fine , my word is n't final . 
  you know , flat hierarchy and all that . 
  all the new office file formats ( like ` * . xlsx ` ) are just simple xml file descriptors and image-like resources inside renamed zip files . 
  i would n't call that complex . 
  you would n't see anything but filenames and magic numbers with an hex editor until inflating the stream with zlib . 
  entropy analysis is your friend . 
  what the hell ? 
  i 'm just saying that can be easily parsed with a zip extractor and a text editor . 
  calm down . 
  try making sense of a office 2003 file format , and see what one is easier . 
  sure . 
  but i was talking more about searching for content directly with an hex editor instead of reversing the format . 
  which , is normally hard . 
  in this case there 's very little plain text and a lot of `` noise '' because of the deflate compression . 
  there you go : http://userscripts.org:8080/scripts/show/183023, 
  ** edit ** : seems like *userscripts.org * has finally died . 
  i 'm using * greasyfork * from now on , experience should be more of the same :, 
  the death gate cycle is a hidden masterpiece , severely underrated by any means . 
  i really hope it gains some traction in the near future . 
  the world-building ( all those appendices and diagrams , background information , the way everything feels organic and makes sense ) , the character development , the surprises , the humor , its fourth-wall-breaking ( bond , james bond !, 
  ) , the accessibility , the various levels of interpretation and the scale and classic epic of the tale . 
  i mean , seven books of tight storytelling . 
  you wo n't find any padding . 
  it 's excellent . 
  the demon cycle is formulaic but enjoyable in its premise . 
  i can actually see how the author got inspired from other known and not-so-well-known fantasy books . 
  it 's a mix-and-match , still good . 
  ** edit ** : for those curious , he clearly bases his wards and * special * tattoos on the runic system of * the death gate cycle * , and that 's just an example , copy-flattery and all that . 
  i bet you do n't have the guts of staying alone in front of a huge bull , i know i do n't . 
  it 's a bit barbaric , but one has to be brave to do it . 
  you ca n't take that away . 
  you do n't seem to understand what is it about . 
  talking snarkly from the ignorance does no good , even if you are right . 
  the thing i like the most of * the death gate cycle * is how actively subversive and anti-cliche is . 
  coming from people writing things like the dragonlance , which can not be more hardcore fantasy and formulaic ( which can be a good thing too ) . 
  feels like a breath of fresh air to me . 
  and way different than anything else , i appreciate how they tried to innovate and how well it reads . 
  still has things like racial conflicts and timeless problems sprinkled with a bit of tolkien-esque good-evil equilibrium over it . 
  balances very well mature themes without being dark , gritty , pessimistic or naive . 
  i would say that is a bit like recommending star wars . 
  you see it everywhere , it does n't need promotion . 
  it 's normal that the show is now more famous than the books . 
  specially in the us . 
  good username . 
  maybe it 's better to keep it like now , general attention wo n't make the series better ( see what happened with asoiaf ) , even if i 'd like people to know about it . 
  i have n't actually read the original version , but the spanish/spain translation captures the tone very well without sounding dated . 
  sometimes the translation makes or breaks the book , you know . 
  at least i think that modern fantasy authors have drawn concepts from it , for example , the entire runic system and patryn tattoos in * the warden man * from * the demon cycle * saga , or the societies shaped by the hardships of monster-filled labyrinths in * the maze runner * . 
  i see this kind of references to stuff from lesser known books all the time . 
  looks like they are going to release it at siggraph 2014 . 
  it has just been announced now . 
  yeah , they normally enforce showing the video window . 
  i 've seen a bunch of related projects forced to shutdown for the very same reason . 
  try to download it using jdownloader or something alike . 
  you copy the link and it saves it wherever you like . 
  a-m-a-z-i-n-g response . 
  this was great . 
  this reminds me to the portal 2 turrets somehow . 
  it does n't mean that is going to be easier , it means that running software on the same architecture will be intrinsically faster than recompiling by converting instructions/opcodes . 
  that means that the future ps4/xbone emulation will be proportionally faster than emulating a ps3 or ps2 . 
  * running x86 instructions on x86 processors -  fast, 
  * running arm instructions on arm processors -  fast, 
  * running mips instructions on x86 processors -  slow , even with jit, 
  do n't confuse * easier * with * faster *, 
  but is faster to run if matches with the target architecture . 
  i think that that is the main point . 
  try updating graphic drivers and staying on the bleeding edge , specially with slow-moving distros like ubuntu . 
  if you wa n't to squeeze performance try the official proprietary blob . 
  even if i 've heard that the open source gallium ones are catching up . 
  overclock as last option .
