  genial . 
  well done . 
  i loved the opcode remapping part . 
  it 's a pretty accessible read too , great for newcomers . 
  his entire channel is pure gold . 
  i just casually found it out in my suggested videos . 
  they are entertaining and more than informative . 
  there 's a lot of work behind them . 
  that 's because it measures the other application 's timing , and when it believes it 's going to take a photo it captures another one from the other application . 
  it 's not snooping on the other apps , instead of that it 's guessing based on certain factors and acting accordingly . 
  in spain we have something called * formaci\u00f3n profesional * , they are l1 advance education diplomas regulated by european standards . 
  basically they are two-year , mostly hands-on , professional education which opens the door to going to proper university . 
  it 's roughly like this :, 
  ( 6 years ) ( high school - 4 years ) ( uni prep - 4 years ) ( entrance exam ) ( university ), 
  primary education =  obligatory secondary education =  bachillerato = = = = = = = = =  selectividad =  4-year degrees =  2-year masters =  doctorate, 
  =  medium grade fp = = = = = =  superior fp = , 
  ( 2 year prof. edu ) ( 2 year prof. edu ), 
  superior level education varies inmensely from country to country . 
  even between those sharing credits and all that . 
  talk for yourself . 
  i 'm doing alright , thanks . 
  do n't try to shoehorn millions of decent people into the failure of a few inepts . 
  yeah , nice ... let 's turn this into the ebola world cup . 
  cut down the superiority syndrome . 
  do n't mix up the independentism in all this . 
  the catalonian goverment ( ciu ) is right-wing , and as corrupt as the central one ( pp ) . 
  they actually share many of their politics and crisis-related policies . 
  including cuts . 
  i 'm not talking about that . 
  they are just better at marketing , while sharing ideology and shitty tactics . 
  ciu is a pp flavor in disguise . 
  in fact , ciu has plummeted lately and people seem to prefer the original party instead of its conglomerated copy . 
  my point is , at least in this kind of topic , having the independence would n't solve anything , specially with ciu on charge . 
  they are just hyping it . 
  independence is not a panacea , even if * we all * here in spain are growing tired of the moncloa shenanigans . 
  there are other solutions , just wait until the elections . 
  this is fantastic , here 's the full film . 
  the putin-depardieu love story :, 
  great work on many levels . 
  * el pollo diablo * , from the * curse of monkey island * ( [ video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e28wrhptzqa ) ) . 
  i 've read a good bunch of the * sword of truth * series and i do n't remember anything of that sort . 
  oh , right , in the tribal village of the mud people . 
  in the would-be-wedding ... 
  i think . 
  poor kahlan , creepy as hell . 
  spanish from spain , it was * chip y chop , los rescatadores * for us here :, 
  this is fun as hell . 
  pretty easy to do , and very rewarding . 
  * edit * : here 's a gallery with the making of , for those interested :, 
   has anyone really been far as decided to use even go want to do look more like ? 
  not that hard . 
  maybe something like this :, 
  we use it all the time over here . 
  for example :, 
  which translates fairly well into :, 
   if you had studied as you should you would n't be in this situation right now . 
  i 'd say that over latin america they make a laxer , simpler use of this . 
  choosing simple grammatical structures and tenses which in spain would be arguably incorrect , sounding plainly ugly and bastardized . 
  yeah , noticed after posting it . 
  you are right , but i figured out it may still be useful . 
  i did n't think about it because it 's second nature for me and we use them interchangeably . 
  i agree that it 's now just used for legalese and archaisms . 
  a correct example used in normal conversations today would be :, 
  or , for a more more hollywood-y dialog :, 
  they are still making references to the future . 
  i can hardly see the difference . 
  and here are their translations , for completeness :, 
   if he does that i ca n't even think about the consequences . 
   if as such he hath got that mortal hurt or is affected by such terrible pain , this would be finally marked upon , with the consequences dictated below becoming irreversible . 
  has been signed , remaining said ; as stipulated above . 
   if something goes awry tell your mother ... now go , run !, 
  thanks for the great freely available content . 
  i know there 's a lot of love and dedication put into it . 
  `` a decent loneliness without conflicts is better than an incomplete relationship full of shortages . '', 
  you do n't know what you are talking about ; the module system ( a python based pseudo-assembler ) is where the actual mod logic is laid out . 
  then is converted/compiled into the obscure . txt files you see , the ones which are distributed with the mod . 
  they are arrays of ( text-based , but that does n't matter ) opcodes and parameters interpreted by the engine . 
  that 's what he decompiled . 
  it 's interpretation , just like you interpret java , python or lua opcodes , or the cpu interprets your x86 instruction set . 
  does n't matter if the opcodes are in text or binary form . 
  the module system is a higher level scripting language . 
  you do n't really know your stuff . 
  again , they do n't have access to the rgl engine source code , they are selling a mod ; an updated version of * brytenwalda * . 
  they asked * taleworlds * for some features , which were added for everyone in the latest few patches . 
  this guy grabbed the * . txt * files , * parsed * and * decompiled * some of them into legible source code . 
  in the same way the hexrays decompiler from ida pro reconstructs c from straight assembler , propagating globals , filling tags , reversing flags , understanding the code flow , ... 
  decompiling involves `` parsing '' , or `` reading with a program '' , the original * . txt * , but that 's just a tiny step . 
  i know this very well because i did more of the same with wfas when it came out , way before they even released their * module system * :, 
  now you are just plainly demonizing , the oldest technique known by man :, 
  somebody forgot to normalize their skinning matrices !, 
  funny enough , the text that appears in the consoles of this gif consists of snippets of a c program using winapi for dumping the local system 's process list * for a tentative memory injection or hack of some sort . 
  so there 's that . 
  \\* slow clap *, 
  ( * ) the createtoolhelp32snapshot family of functions used by the task manager , for those curious : https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms682489%28v=vs.85%29.aspx, 
  i 'm from spain and i have n't used * usted * in years . 
  it 's getting less and less popular here . 
  nowadays even things like the windows 8 dialogs are written in informal castilian . 
  so you get the idea . 
  yeah . 
  that 's pretty spot on .
