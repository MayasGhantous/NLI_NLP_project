  ** note : ** this mod was originally developed for mount and blade 1.011 , and was ported to work with warband by swyter . 
  this led to strange issues that was not originally found in vanilla m&b .

  i 'm a tld dev , ask away !, 
  we 're in maintenance mode . 
  there are a couple of loose ends , like half finished quests , opengl shaders for linux and mac os x , and ironing out warband quirks . 
  to track our progress/bugs you can [ take a look at our trello board ] ( https://trello.com/b/ntzyndea/the-last-days-of-the-third-age-warband-port ) . 
  we plan to release the updated source code under a liberal creative commons license soon , so that others can expand on it . 
  you are right . 
  i plan to disable the testing mode in the workshop version to hide unfinished quests and cheat menu options . 
  i was worried that recompiling the mod would break savegame compatibility . 
  we shared our dev/nightly builds with the general playerbase to ease bug hunting , but that strategy is breaking immersion for some people . 
  we are aware of that . 
  should be now fixed in both 1.011 and warband . 
  but will only start working if you start a new game in a recent-ish nightly patched version , as far as i know . 
  tld is a complex beast , and save corruption problems have plagued it for as long as it has existed .

  we just posted the steam workshop announcement yesterday . 
  this [ m&b 1.011 screenshot is ours , too ] ( http://www.moddb.com/mods/the-last-days/images/smiles-epic-screens-3122#imagebox ) . 
  so not even warband . 
  i do n't get why this low effort submission gets 125 votes while our detailed announcement only 20 . 
  sigh . 
  pretty much . 
  that 's precisely the reason . 
  until level 8 you experience a soft tutorial to get you acquainted with what you will be doing once the war of the ring finally breaks . 
  he should have downloaded tld from here : https://tldmod.github.io, 
  it took me a good few afternoons to transcribe it . 
  it turned out to be his last great interview before he exited real madrid . 
  i thought it might be useful for mid-level students . 
  glad to be of help . 
  there i am , can confirm on the sheer amount of variants . 
  there you go : https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/bulder, 
  use the transliterated `` * hacer b\u00falder * '' , `` * escalada en bloque * '' , or even `` * escalada libre * '' may work in certain situations . 
  also , hle bios ` es are not really any kind of actual bios . 
  they are a part of the emulator that oversees the game from a higher perspective and mimics the responses of the original proprietary code to a certain degree . 
  in the same way the rest of the emulator mimics the hardware . 
  the game normally does not talk with the hardware directly ( as even between versions of the same console things change ) , when it tries to save data to the memory card , or retrieve the gamepad button presses it asks a lightweight operating system stored permanently in a rom chip mapped in ram at a certain place ( often unofficially called bios ) instead . 
  thus hle is much more incomplete , it does just enough to fool the game and hook the bare basic functions that make it tick . 
  if you can dump it yourself , yes . 
  also , sounds like a fun afternoon project if you have a psx with a legal game ( to hotswap ) , a memory card , a memory card reader and a blank cd :,

  if you have an arduino board [ you can read memory cards too ] ( http://shendohardware.blogspot.com/2013/06/memcarduino.html ) . 
  that 's completely outdated . 
  download the mod from here :, 
  now the mod is in the steam workshop :, 
  if you prefer to download it manually , do it from here :, 
  _ orbis os _ in playstation 4 , for those scratching their heads . 
  in castilian we say ' _ asignatura _ ' for school subjects . 
  ( just for completeness , as ' _ materia _ ' is used for physical ' _ matter _ ' here ), 
  it 's pretty common , but if you are not extremely acquainted with the language , culture or situation i would recommend against using it . 
  the general rule is that gesticulation , body language and knowing your moment is what makes it acceptable . 
  any ambiguity will raise eyebrows or make people cringe . 
  you can convey many things without using expletives , which language learners tend to overuse . 
  there 's also the more mild and reasonable variants : ' _ \u00a1 mierda ! _ ' , ' _ \u00a1 vaya ! _ ' , \u00a1 _ aiv\u00e1 _ ! , \u00a1 _ jobar _ ! , pick , mix and match . 
  ( i still remember listening to david beckham giving interviews during his real madrid phase ; _ palabrotas _ all over the place . 
  it was \\* extremely * ridiculous ... and painful back in the day ), 
  on a more personal note , i almost never use it without reason . 
  i find it pretty basic and vulgar . 
  what about pointing to the official download page ? 
  you guys are making it more difficult than it really is . 
  go here and follow the neat instructions : https://tldmod.github.io, 
  also , i 'm a tld dev and i 'm constantly pointing people here , do n't misinform . 
  taleworlds did a shoddy work with their font dds texture decoder , looks like it only loads dxt3 files , so any mod using a custom font will give problems , or that 's what is seems . 
  also , i 'd appreciate if someone could post a screenshot of the font problems in a mac . 
  i 've seen plenty of people complain about it but no actual proof so far . 
  it would come in handy to _ actually _ \\* see * the problem . 
  yes . 
  that error happens when you try to run the m&b 1.011 version of the mod in warband . 
  next time download it from here ( https://tldmod.github.io ) , which is the official download page , and follow the instructions . 
  it 's not rocket science , but i 'm starting to sound like a broken record because people do n't seem _ read _ on the internet , only skim and click on green buttons . 
  we literally point to that page everywhere we have direct control on . 
  that is completely outdated . 
  do n't misinform . 
  those are interpolated normal vectors represented as pixel/fragment shader colors . 
  i bet because of an overheated graphics card or a driver problem . 
  put more fans on it . 
  first of all , that 's a random , old and unofficial video . 
  we do n't use installers anymore , we do n't have release versions anymore , we support two games in tandem . 
  we are doing something better than hand-holding people through a brain dead video tutorial , and that is making the installation simple . 
  you go to https://tldmod.github.io ( which is always automatically updated with automatically-generated patches as we develop every change in our dev repository , all of that uploaded by a bot i made ) , you choose the game , you download the three files in order , and follow the explanation made for people who do n't like to read . 
  see ?
