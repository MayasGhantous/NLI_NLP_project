  people just do n't read , and then they help each other . 
  first time i heard about it . 
  does not seem like like a tld-specific problem to me . 
  it could be anything , from hardware problems , like laggy memory swaps , to overheating . 
  yes , i plan to . 
  my modding time is limited , i 'm juggling lots of projects in my free time , and one has to prioritize . 
  tld is totally finished , that 's why i ported it to warband first . 
  i had problems with linux last year , but they have made changes improving the situation with the texture loader and glsl shaders . 
  i think their porting job is based in android , that 's why they stripped out so many features . 
  i actually had tld working in linux pretty solidly until they switched to a new cached shader format , as the preprocessing was taking a * lot * of time at startup , freezing the game . 
  now the startup times are pretty decent and fonts are n't glitched anymore , but this has slowed down my porting attempts considerably . 
  i 'd also love having editor mode in non-windows platforms , writing this from arch linux . 
  one can dream . 
  okay , cool !, 
  ping me with a / u/swyter in the thread and i 'll take a look . 
  well , _ latin american _ spanish is the one mixing up sounds . 
  over here we do n't have that problem , except andalucia . 
  well , _ zer _ and _ cer _ always share sound , but there 's not mixing up . 
  it 's phonetically consistent , they are duplicated . 
  you wo n't find many native words that are n't using _ c _ , tho . 
  okay , so it does n't have anything to do with the ` font.dds ` , which loaded just right , it 's a problem with the ` font_data . xml ` file . 
  that makes it much more difficult to fix . 
  linux certainly does not suffer from this problem . 
  i bet the mac engine is using the native ` font_data . xml ` ( which tells the game the position and size of every glyph in the texture atlas ) with the custom mod font texture ( ` font.dds ` ) . 
  the result being that letters are getting cut out at the wrong place and with the wrong size . 
  that means that the overriding mechanism for ` < game root  / modules / < mod name  / data ` vs ` < game root  / data ` in the mac engine is just broken , leaving me with nothing to do . 
  only taleworlds is able to do anything . 
  can you temporarily replace the common ` font_data . xml ` with the one from tld ( at ` < root  / modules/tld/data ` ) into the game 's ` < root  / data ` folder and take a screenshot while keeping the custom ` font.dds ` in the mod 's ` < root  / modules/tld/textures ` folder ? 
  if still does n't work we may still have some hope . 
  it 's unlikely , but they may have changed the xml format for mac . 
  uploading the original mac ` font_data . xml ` to https://pastebin.com may also help . 
  download it from the official site : https://tldmod.github.io, 
  also , what operating system are you using ? 
  it 's only for windows . 
  and that , kids , is why you must use proper vertical raycasting when building your real-time ik ( inverse kinematics ) controllers . 
  sigh . 
  i corrected it to sound a bit more natural , the structure was pretty englishified :, 
  pretty good job , better than your average translator . 
  have fun and give credit where is due . 
  well , i usually translate in _ proper _ spanish by following rae recommendations . 
  rae is the ultimate language authority . 
  unlike english here we have actual standards for everyone , no matter the region . 
  i took a quick look and the spanish version seemed to follow common anglicism patterns . 
  in any case the english version is better than its spanish counterpart , which is phrased very poorly ; with repetitive structures and butchered expressions . 
  pretty ugly and uneducated for a college professor , if you ask me . 
  the original text is pretty silly . 
  i probably would . 
  that 's your problem . 
  the proximity with usa dilutes the expressiveness and cross-contaminates the language . 
  the original text lacks the complexity that makes me take it seriously as a scholarly work , improvised or not .
