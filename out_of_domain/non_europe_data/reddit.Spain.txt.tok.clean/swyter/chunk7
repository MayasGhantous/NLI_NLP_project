  yikes , the reddit markup is giving me a hard time with the layout , hope it 's still readable . 
  you are very welcome , it 's a fun song for kids . 
  works for me on _ arch linux _ with the latest open source mesa/gallium drivers over an integrated amd aruba ( r600g ) graphics card . 
  i can play with everything maxed out . 
  it exposes opengl 3.3 , but you have to install the 32 bit versions of everything to get 3d acceleration with most steam games working ( not many of them are 64 bit , warband is not ) . 
  you might not meet the opengl requirements . 
  unlike the mac os x port third party mods should work flawlessly , unless you put custom shaders into the equation . 
  that 's planned to change . 
  it 's not trivial for a mod of such complexity , though . 
  it 's also used for some abbreviations of common names , like _ maria _ = _ m\u00aa _ , which for many women in spain is an official prefix of their actual name , only used in legal documents and such . 
  _ ** e.g. 
  _ references _ :,

  yes . 
  computer science will teach you exactly how the various stages of a cpu work , its various caches , registers clock , timings , and sub-parts , the way opcode interpretation is laid out on the chip and many more interesting details in between useful for emulation , like bus/dma/peripheral communication . 
  you will learn to read and understand assembly , compilers ; parsers that read text/code , tokenize it , make sense of its structure and work on converting it down to optimized assembly and from that to isa-specific opcodes . 
  you name it . 
  there 's much more theory than hands-on programming , though . 
  computer science is the perfect match for someone who likes to know about internal stuff and what makes it tick . 
  of course everything from chip to jit can be learned auto-didactically online with some passion and a bit of willpower , some of the best hackers/emulator makers are self-taught . 
  but the paper framed in the wall comes in handy if you want to spice up your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 . 
  http://rtve.es is the equivalent to the bbc in spain . 
  i do n't know if video contents and podcasts are restricted overseas , but it 's worth a try and has all kinds of media , news and articles . 
  i translate foss programs to castilian and one of the most glaring issues i see while reviewing lazy and sub-par translations is copying the passive english structure . 
  a good translator flips it around from passive to make it sound much more natural , apart from removing superfluous commas and other stylistic fixes . 
  you wo n't believe the sixth sense i have developed recognizing english patterns and mannerisms in all kinds of local literature . 
  it irks me a little so see such a sloppy work . 
  _ car\u00e1mbano _ is a pretty pretty basic word , at least in spain . 
  i can imagine the reason behind the lack of winter vocabulary in the warm south america , though . 
   la influencia cultural suele fluir mayormente/principalmente de forma unidireccional . 
  to be fair , retroarch is pretty ugly for a front-end . 
  i mean , even standalone emulators like dolphin have better multiplatform guis than it . 
  the problem with ` libretro ` front-ends is that most of them are n't even good , and making an interface is exponentially easier than programming an emulation backend . 
  when your whole project revolves around one thing ; unifying emulators under a single program , at least do it right , have a decent design that integrates with the host system , dammit !, 
  right now is just not worth it . 
  the premise is good , but , specially the android port , is pretty shoddy , orthopedic , unconventional , and alien . 
  someone needs to give it another go and flesh this whole thing out . 
  use real java activities in android , winapi in windows , qt/gtk in linux , ... keeping in mind the dpi and user experience instead of wrapping the same full-screen sdl thing in every conceivable platform . 
  you so ugly !, 
  in spain we would say : _ \u00bf donde naciste ? _ or _ \u00bf de donde eres ? _, 
  that use of _ cual _ sounds totally weird . 
  _ cual _ is often used singly as a quick explanatory question when you did n't hear or understood correctly :, 
  - __ \u00bf has -- ido h-bl-r d-l - e -- ? __, 
  it 's also pretty used jokingly as an ellipsis in the loose expression `` _ ya , tal , cual y pascual ... '' _ , which works in the same vein than '' _ and so on . . _ . '', 
  or '' _ and all that ... _ '' but much more informal , lazy and tongue-in-cheek :, 
  this last case seems to be specially used in enumerations and not-so-serious ranty monologues , like in this case . 
  first of all , i do appreciate the premise of ` libretro ` . 
  also , i know how to program , i 've been doing it since i was twelve , contributing in many foss projects for years , some of them pretty hardcore , like improving the ssl/tls support in wine/reactos , and making changes in kernel mode . 
  i did n't want to sound dismissive or entitled , i 'm sorry if sounded harsh , re-reading my post sounds like it , but was n't my intention . 
  i get crap all the time on the internet too , i know the feel . 
  the ratio of appreciative users/assholes is always alarming when you think about the time and love one pours into it . 
  when one is anemically low also tends to read any text like it has a darker undertone . 
  i want it to improve , and sometimes people work in a project so closely that get lost in the details , forgetting the bigger picture . 
  things like integrating a bit better by tailoring interfaces to the guidelines of the target platform does n't sound far-fetched . 
  but i understand that you are using the kodi/xbmc approach and doing it all the way around , having the rest of the ecosystem trying to adapt around you . 
  that 's another way of doing it . 
  _ ps 1 _ : the ps3-like skin looks cool , by the way , i had n't seen that one . 
  _ ps 2 _ : the wiki has [ lots of spam pages in it ] ( http://wiki.libretro.com/index.php?title=special%3asearch&amp;profile=default&amp;search=skin&amp;fulltext=search ) , i know that mediawiki is a pain in the ass . 
  i kind of solved it in my wiki adding custom question fields in the forms and using [ badbehavior ] ( http://bad-behavior.ioerror.us/ ) , that makes automated registering a little harder . 
  _ ps 3 _ : let 's not forget that we are all accidental part-time assholes , from time to time . 
  this is all pretty informal stuff , as you can probably guess :, 
  - _ umjum ... _ ( general/onomatopoeic ), 
  - _ ya ves ... _ ( agreeable ), 
  - _ vale ... _ ( agreeable ), 
  - _ afirmativo ... _ ( cheeky , `` roger that '' ), 
  - _ s\u00ed se\u00f1or ... _ ( depends on context , used ironically many times ), 
  - _ por supuesto _ ( elegant and frugal ), 
  - _ jah ... _ ( for the lazy , as interjection while someone is speaking to you ), 
  - _ \u00bf t\u00fa que crees ? _ ( for extra badassery/tongue in cheek ; body language and intonation are important cues here ),
