  there are many reasons for this . 
  but recently that there has been a sense that the ukr is going to be left high and dry . 
  the us will not arm them and the eu has no stomach to fight . 
  while nato could help , the western european members do not feel like doing this . 
  moreover , the european press is filled with reports of ukr corruption , human rights violations , etc. 
  merkel and hollande went to see putin today , the market probably thinks there is a deal in the works . 
  yes , it will also scare the east european nato members out of their wits . 
  if ukr goes to putin , the belorussia and the baltic states are next . 
  for all of us that have been bullied . 
  we were nothing to them in many cases . 
  that 's the spirit !, 
  good comment . 
  the whole miadan protests seemed delusional . 
  all built on energy and emotion . 
  that said , those who encouraged it and who thought that they could pull manipulate them and pull a fast on putin - during his olympics , no less !, 
  well - the mess we are in today . 
  the darker one that keeps falling on his den mates - too cute . 
  some things never change -- i graduated in 1982 and evidently the bathrooms are sill gross !, 
  the amount of money it costs is huge . 
  if you can swing without debt - you will love it . 
  they give grants to top students like you . 
  check it out . 
  miami is incredibly cool . 
  only , go back to nj in the summer , trust me . 
  you ca n't go around doing stuff like that and then expect to be taken seriously . 
  what kind of allies do we have and is arming them an good idea . 
  at that point , you ca n't stay - `` hey , they started it . '', 
  it 's an agreement and you have wait for the other side to break it . 
  when you are the weaker party , you have to keep to moral high ground . 
  yes - it looks like in the past few weeks , they have lost 500 sq miles . 
  ( per guardian - ca n't find the link now . ), 
  so they want a cease fire at any price and to regroup . 
  the situation is serious , and putin is seating pretty . 
  i always thought that her death from jordanian airstrikes was too convenient , hard to believe and out and out lie . 
   but i moved on to another career, 
  why did n't you stay in the old one ? 
  did she badmouth you to others in the industry ? 
  have you recovered ? 
  unfortunately , anyone serious about their job puts up with the commute . 
  is n't it horrible -- same thing happened to me . 
  people can get away with saying anything in a work and no one challenges them . 
  btw , the investigation was not to exonerate you or , even `` convict '' you . 
  once the rumor was out there , hr wanted to know if there was any liability or licensing repercussions to them . 
  after they found out they were in the clear - former co-worker was obviously lying ; they did n't to rehabilitate you . 
  and , it is very hard to get over . 
  take care . 
  yes , that 's why the answer : my company moving to < someplace 50 miles  is not a good reason for leaving . 
  i know i tried . 
  hope the best for you . 
  i just thought another point -- `` if you think need a lawyer , you do . 
  you 'd be surprised how quickly everything dies a natural death . '', 
   but its gon na leave a scar . 
  i 've turned to writing , keeps me from going over and blowing up the place . 
  hope your ok too, 
  what does n't kill makes you bitter . 
  please consider working as medical/clinical tech writer . 
  pays very well and , pm , if you are interested in . 
  you need to see it in color and standing up -- [ check the heart on the crotch ] ( http://isabelrose.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/17867-barbrastreisandowl.jpg ), 
  so sultry , it just emanated from her . 
  was this requested by the company or a outside recruiter ? 
  often , recruiter will ask for bosses for their own canvassing reasons - i.e. 
  to call them and see if they have open positions . 
  be the person who can talk to the clients - own the relationships . 
   it may be worth noting that this was not a posted job position anywhere but someone i knew knew someone at the firm and they were looking to bring on someone in the near future . 
  can you use your connections to find out what happened ? 
  do n't mention it unless the interview is looking very promising . 
  if they say nothing , go away and then if want you 're present - let them know . 
  second this !, 
  dranthe - yes , this type of thing is unnerving . 
  it sounds like he wants to help you for some reason . 
  take the help . 
  look at the worst possible scenario - you ignore it , he forgets about it and then downsizing happens anyway . 
  completely correct -- i long ago stopped believing any information coming out of the front . 
  i saw a map on ** the guardian showing the salient around debaltseve closing ** and russia gaining 500 sq. 
  miles . 
  ** then i realized the encirclement had not happened , ** the ukr was holding its own and the us wanted to armed the ukr . 
  oh - and yes the ukr is full of neo-nazis , the russians are going all soviet and crimea was stolen , yik-yak , yik-yak . 
  none of this is productive . 
  it seems like a killing field in the making , with neither side willing to listen and to find middle ground that allows people to live in peace . 
  ( that said - if it 's true the ukr is so indiscriminate in its bombing civilians get hurt [ note i did not say target civilians - there is a distinction ] , then they are losing the moral ground . ), 
  there are people who will manipulate the pettiest circumstances to embarrass you . 
  ask yourself why it so easy for them to do this . 
  that you are viewed by your company as an individual -- you are just commodity/resource . 
  that we are all living the american dream - that went out a long time ago ; but many outside the us believe it . 
  til gum work and reconstructive surgery costs a fortune . 
  drive thru or take out food, 
  i was born by c-section, 
  conservatives - teachers unions, 
  because the fbi/cia/nsa are actually looking for plots such as these instead of focusing exclusively on copyright infringement . 
  yourself, 
  relentless optimism is also a stereotype, 
  no - they institute rules that limit the work they do . 
  i am thinking of `` whole language learning '' where the teacher just reads a book ; when forcing students to read aloud themselves is more effective and a hell of a lot more trouble . 
  do n't get me started on math . 
  i agree with this - the answer is to, 
   is it true that the 1960 's -1970 's middle east was super civilized and progressive , and if so , what the hell happened ? 
  no it was n't . 
  do you want to hear my story , instead . 
  let me know . 
  because the entertainment industry , the software industry - really , all california creative industries are big contributors to the democratic party .
