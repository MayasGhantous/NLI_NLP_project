  astrology -- some people purchase expensive books , pay to have their chart created , and who knows what else . 
  in fact , all that new age stuff . 
  i realized my first husband was an idiot when he purchased a crystal -- he was a national merit scholar . 
  my mother , an astronomy minor , was shocked when a co-worker asked her to create her chart . 
  omg !, 
  here 's my story -- it was described as magical . 
  a few ground rules --, 
  - combine the ceremony and the reception . 
  ( no limos , no church , no decorations in two places . 
  we at the venue before it started and left in my husband 's truck decorated by best man . ), 
  - use a family wedding / engagement ring . 
  - get a caterer - spending more money on the reception than on your dress is the key to a beautiful budget wedding . 
  here goes -, 
  1 ) *** rented a historical home for the wedding and the reception . 
  one place for everyone . 
  *** it was gorgeous , on the water in ft. lauderdale , glamorous with all the outdoor lighting . 
  stranahan house also provided free tours of the house , allowed photos to be taken there . 
  the ceremony was in front of the doorsteps and the reception in tented patio . 
  there were gardens to explore - the open bar was in one of them . 
  all the tables , table cloths and seating was included . 
  cost : $ 2,500 . 
  2 ) open bar -- ** bought all the liquor in costco . 
  returned all un-opened bottles . 
  ** this impressed everyone - bar , part of venue location , cost of liquor : $ 300 - including the champagne and the wine . 
  ( i should have gone for more expensive red ), 
  3 ) catering - provided a buffet , bartender , waiters for the champagne and wine . 
  apprx : $ 3,500 ( 75 guests @ $ 50 a head ) they provided all the place setting and they distributed some skimpy hors d' oeuvres . 
  5 ) invitations - ** from a common printer ** - looked through the book until i found square invitations - used a classy silvery ( but not embossed or anything fancy ) font and classic wording from emily post . 
  printed out the envelopes on my printer with another fancy deep blue font that looked like handwriting . 
  cost : $ 125, 
  6 ) cake - went to a specialist baker and ** had her duplicate a martha stewart cake . 
  ** cost : appx : $ 300 . 
  cake was dessert . 
  7 ) photography : $ 1,500 . 
  color and ** black and white . 
  8 ) flowers : $ 700 - the venue had many natural flowers , these were place settings ( used my collection of depression glass to hold them ) and the flowers for me ( bride ) , one maid of honor and one flower girl . 
  9 ) menu cards and place cards - ** printed out my own using a kit and my printer . 
  8 ) favors - truffles , in little boxes , with ribbon . 
  prepared them myself . 
  the menu cards , the place cards , the depression glass with white roses and the favors all gave it a look of elegance . 
  9 ) wedding dress - $ 350 - ** vintage silk and lace from ebay . 
  no veil . 
  10 ) hair - $ 50 - in a fancy updo , did own makeup, 
  11 ) fancy dangling liz taylor earrings ( costume ) - $ 20 in consignment store . 
  12 ) wedding rings - ** my grandparents -- free . 
  ** lots of compliments - antique and diamonds for me - a lovely gold and platinum band for husband . 
  13 ) minister - ** my uncle is justice of the peace - free . 
  ** ( everyone thought it was beautiful . ), 
  15 ) music - dj -- $ 600 . 
  i think that 's all - hope you get some ideas - the best idea is really ** one venue **, 
  thanks -- looks like they did n't have reserves and when they started retreating , stopped the fighting . 
  did n't know how much a-h , romania and bulgaria impacted things . 
  i guess things were desperate in germany , but they should have held out for peace terms . 
  i am not an expert either - but its important to note russia was in a different situation vis-a-vis the us . 
  it did not need to import cotton and it was not on the atlantic , so at that time , no rivalry existed between it and the us . 
  finally , russia freed its serfs in 1862 , so the tsar might have been sympathized with freeing the slaves . 
  no love for scarlett o'hara ? 
  right now -- i quit smoking on new years - so dealing with the cravings . 
  ( i am on nicoderm lozenges and hypnosis , but i still get overwhelming urges . ), 
  a good man is hard to find -- or -- the mae west version `` a hard man is good to find . '', 
  this is a promotional shot from elephant walk ( 1954 ) - she was 22 . 
  this is from richard 's birthday party ; around 1973-74 . 
  the dress resembles the versace demi moore wore in indecent proposal . 
  love the necklace -- one of the best pieces in her jewelry auction , around $ 5.5 million - description below -, 
  a sapphire and diamond sautoir , by bvlgari, 
  suspending a detachable pav\u00e9-set diamond octagonal pendant , set with a sugarloaf cabochon sapphire , weighing approximately 52.72 carats , with calibr\u00e9-cut sapphire trim and bullet-cut diamond accents , to the pav\u00e9-set diamond neckchain , spaced by calibr\u00e9-cut sapphire geometric links , mounted in platinum , 1969 , 29 3/4 ins. , pendant may be worn as a brooch, 
  thanks so much all you --, 
  wow !, 
  yeah - that 's what i heard , never goes away completely . 
  thanks - this is not a problem for me , as none of my friends smoke . 
  or , better put , i am the last one to quit . 
  i 've had the hardest time . 
  i 've quit a few times before -- but as a result of a stressful life situation my drinking and my smoking got out of control . 
  this is the worst it has been for me . 
  thanks ,, 
  yes , the fairest of them all . 
  okay -- there is other medication that may not affect you that way . 
  please look into it . 
  well - the smoker 's cough is gone as is the phlegm . 
  for practical reasons mostly . 
  early on , i read `` gods , graves and scholars '' a popular book for early archeology . 
  i surmised that initially and to this day , grave sites provide the best insight into art , how people viewed their worth in life/afterlife , social hierarchies , and private life ( artifacts buried with them . ), 
  moreover , religion was the system of control for early societies - so funerary evidence is very helpful in this area . 
  in most cultures , these mark the few areas left untouched -- and even then there were grave robbers . 
  the cities , written documents , and other aspects of day-to-day life were lost to the centuries . 
  ruins , vague folk memories , undecipherable carvings . 
  some cultures have surviving written records - most notably the clay tablets of mesopotamia , crete and archaic greece and the papyrus of egypt . 
  these have to be deciphered and there is one system of writing from crete ( minoan - linear a ) that i believe has not yet been . 
  lately , with underwater archeology - we are finding shipwrecks that expand on the knowledge of ancient cultures . 
  this shows what goods were traded , and in some cases , show surprising levels of advancement . 
  it also gives insight into the commercial side of things , less likely under control of religion . 
  here is some information on black sea digs --, 
  [ black sea archeology !, 
  ] ( http://archive.archaeology.org/online/features/crimea/ ), 
  you are correct - i should not have made such a sweeping statement . 
  however , if you look at the earliest societies that harnessed agriculture - sumer , for example -- their temples and priests managed the agricultural production , the irrigation , etc. 
  in egypt , the bureaucracy , heavily influenced by religion ( the pharaoh was considered a god ) controlled agricultural society . 
  i was thinking of these examples , but , obviously , there are others - archaic greece , comes to mind - where the link is not clear . 
  this is very interesting , i would certainly take a look at it . 
  thanks you very much !,
