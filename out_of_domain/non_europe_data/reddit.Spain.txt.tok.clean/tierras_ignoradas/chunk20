  that 's pretty big on its own . 
  do n't know about moses existing - but , no the torah does not its appearance on mt. 
  agreed -- it was more along the lines of execute plan crimea 6 . 
  do n't blame him , now the eastern ukr is looking like a killing field and ... it is real prime real estate ? 
  oh ... so she was keeping stuff secret . 
  i still do n't understand the importance of this tree . 
  you are joking , right . 
  jews control the world economy and the media . 
  appeal to prejudice . 
  it does n't matter if it 's treason or protected by the first amendment . 
  a message needs to be sent to this congress that foreign policy is the purview of the executive branch . 
  after negotiations are complete , they are more than welcome to see if they wish to pass it into law . 
  nothing has made me sadder as a white american than realizing the racial polarization the election of black president has been . 
  he is a transitional figure - he can win elections , but they will cripple his ability to govern . 
  but , to actively interfere in foreign policy negotiations -- never seen it in my lifetime . 
   openly , seditious and subversive is new, 
  i am so worried that lines keep getting crossed . 
  they want one in ukraine , too . 
  check out this article on the german reaction to neocons currently in charge of ukrainian policy .

  me , too . 
  it wo n't be my blood or my treasure . 
  more importantly , it wo n't be my vision of america as it is supposed to be . 
   it 's like you guys do n't even know you were abused sometimes !, 
  it carries into adulthood . 
  i put up with a lot from people . 
  it 's only in retrospect or when someone points it out that i realize the person was disrespecting me , playing with my head , making me a target , giving me lots of orders to keep me off-balance , etc. 
  i am glad you have some to validate ( and educate ) your experiences of abuse . 
   i 'm sure i seemed weird , just talking about them gets me antsy and nervous , like they 're gon na overhear me . 
  boy , i know this feeling . 
  i transferred a lot of my feelings to a boss that completely took advantage of them . 
  i was terrified to even remotely criticize him , let alone reveal to others what he was doing . 
  he totally factored that tendency of mine , right in . 
  i am glad you found your neighbor . 
  this is so true -- i left an abusive boss . 
  but , before i left , i found out one of his fave topics was `` how bad tierras_ignoradas is . '', 
  it was like being horrible to me was not enough ; he needed to `` relive it '' or `` reframe it '' or simply make up stuff to keep the good feelings going . 
  being a boss , he had toadies who agreed with him . 
  glad you are aware of this . 
  now remember , those people your nparents talk to , do n't know the truth about you , be careful around them , consider them contaminated in a way . 
  until they prove otherwise . 
  thanks !, 
  you take a tongue scraper and use it once across the whole tongue . 
  you keep using it until there is no more gunk in lip, 
  you take the scraper and go as far back as you can without gagging and keep scraping until no more gunk . 
  then a using a special toothbrush , put oxygenated toothpaste on it and spread it all over the tongue with back of this special toothbrush . 
  the back has little nobbles , but no bristles . 
  you then wait 90 seconds for the toothpaste to kill all the bacteria in the fissures . 
  a timer is recommended . 
  you rinse with water until you get it all off . 
  finish off with a rinse of chlorhexidine . 
  i think you only have to do it at night . 
  should i just brush my tongue at night , then . 
  i have a sonic toothbrush , but i do n't have the tongue attachment . 
  and which of you dental jockeys down voted my question . 
  i have already spent almost $ 20k and shown a slide of my teeth with little bacteria swimming around and then they showed me my tongue . 
  it was disgusting and this was after i had a periodontal cleaning . 
  no -- if done right , there is n't . 
  i will be down voted , but i dated a dentist a long time ago and i had all four wisdom teeth removed at once . 
  i went to the best oral surgeons in his opinion . 
  he told me that done right there is minimal pain or swelling . 
  no swelling , no downtime , no pain after the procedure . 
  and i have a very small mouth , with huge teeth and constant problems with roots going every which way . 
  i should have stayed in touch with him . 
  cuban here -- my family fought in the independence war - which you may know as the spanish-american war . 
  my great grandmother and great grand aunts used to embroider these flags . 
  they are not based on us state flags . 
  here 's the [ origin story of the flag ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_cuba ) . 
  it was inspired by the french revolution and some poetic license . 
  the flag symbolizes the independence and sovereignty of the cuban people . 
  moreover , during the time the us occupied cuba , the stars and stripes flew over the island . 
  after cuba was granted independence , the old independence flag was flown . 
  see above article . 
  although castro created a communist flag , it is only a party flag . 
  castro sees ( sells ) himself as a cuban patriot and nationalist ; the rightful heir to jose marti the 19th century cuban revolutionary and martyr . 
  more important , he positions himself against the us . 
  to remove a flag that symbolized independence from spain and the us was against the stated goals of the cuban revolution . 
  he left it alone . 
  also , please see [ chile 's flag ] ( http://www.mapsofworld.com/images/world-countries-flags/chile-flag.gif ) does this remind you of [ texas ' flag ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/flag_of_texas.svg/2000px-flag_of_texas.svg.png ), 
  the chilean flag predates the one from texas ( 1817 vs 1838 ) . 
  the us does not have some sort of copyright on flag designs . 
  [ here you go ] ( https://marxistleninist.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/cuba-pcc.jpg ), 
  note how the traditional flag obscures and has precedence over the red flag . 
  you may have been thinking of the [ puerto rican flag ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_puerto_rico#mediaviewer/file:flag_of_puerto_rico.svg . ), 
  the story behind this flag --, 
  `` the adaptation of the cuban flag with the colors inverted was suggested by the patriot francisco gonzalo mar\u00edn in a letter which he wrote from jamaica . 
  i made the proposition to various puerto rican patriots during a meeting at chimney hall and it was approved unanimously '', 
  there are other [ stories ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_puerto_rico ), 
  however , you see the blue closer to us flag . 
  yeah -- the flag is very important ; today , you can see all over miami , as anti-castro cubans consider it their own , too . 
  if i remember correctly , there is a patriotic poem about a woman who embroidered a flag for each one of her fallen sons . 
  no matter the bad news , she started embroidering another one . 
  i can only think that even fidel heard these stories and poems . 
  edit : castro went to belen , a jesuit run prep school that was very patriotic .
