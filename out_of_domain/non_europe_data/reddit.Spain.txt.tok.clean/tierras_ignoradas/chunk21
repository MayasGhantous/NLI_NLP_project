  the human form , a fiery forge . 
  the human face , a furnace seal 'd, 
  the human heart , its hungry gorge . 
  -- end, 
  i am older than most of you and have had a hard life . 
  completely agree , they are their own category . 
  european in terms of appearance , but very different . 
  yep . 
  true - russia took the brunt of all those land attacks by nomadic people and allowed europe to develop more peacefully . 
  although the spanish repelled the turks , both from vienna and at lepanto . 
  i did n't think of it - but , if the byzantine empire had survived , it 's culture would be very similar to russian culture . 
  well - and the animal ? 
   wanted to see the island annexed to the united states , and he designed the flag while he was in new york . 
  so i 'd say it 's quite possible that the flag was literally designed to be a u.s. state flag , not just to look like one . 
  you are correct that initially the cuban independence movement was centered entering the union as a slave state . 
  so there maybe truth to that . 
  i am not a flag expert . 
  see below - flag_log makes an interesting point . 
  be careful with authority figures - bosses , teachers , hall monitors , etc. 
  realize you maybe giving vibes that attract these predators . 
  geographic tongue is what i was told - they even gave me a mirror and point the fissures in my tongue . 
  i just finished being yelled at by nsis for an hour - i like your `` shriek at me and out-bellow '' to describe attempts to defend yourself . 
  elizabeth i and ivan the terrible . 
  he proposed . 
  my nsis temper tantrums . 
  the discovery of the scientific method in early modern times . 
  practice public speaking ; take improv classes, 
  it 's unlikely either way . 
  absolutely , space travel was not even on the radar screen until sputnik . 
  if i made add , it was a tangible goal that seemed achievable with the tech available . 
  i second this . 
  i 'm in love, 
   rather it was the meticolous prussian attention to detail in staff work . 
  officers , while often noble in extraction , were promoted on seniority and performance , and had to go through a very good training and studies at the prussian military academy . 
  the prussians formed a telegraph corps as early as 1830 , understood logistics , large-scale manouvre and how to use their troops and keep them supplied better than any other army during the 19th century . 
  this is the answer , mostly . 
  the prussians almost invented staff work , logistics were taken very seriously and they adapted new communication and transportation innovations almost immediately to military applications . 
  i believe there is saying that goes - `` amateurs talk military strategy ; experts talk logistics . '', 
  there was a proud tradition where on day 1 of a battle the general staff had nothing to do . 
  i believe one general - the elder molke - read a novel on one day 1 . 
  just to show everything was ready . 
  another point was that the prussians adapted a very flexible field command structure . 
  a field commander was expected to be so thoroughly trained for any possible scenario that he could execute orders to deal with it on the spot . 
  this prevented delays and allowed them to take advantage of opportunities , while their opponents needed approval for hq . 
  source -- the guns of august . 
  not going to happen . 
  the nato alliance will collapse if poland is left alone to deal with the russians -- poland is safe under the us nuclear umbrella ; putin is too smart to risk nuclear war over poland . 
  so far he has been very cautious about everything . 
  completely agreed -- this is just fear mongering and saber rattling - like at the same time . 
   fuck i would n't be surprised if there were legitimately ` most dangerous game ' type hunts in secret . 
  neither would i. 
  so many people go missing in the us , where some effort is made to track them . 
  now move to a country with less developed infrastructure , with people of different race . 
  could happen . 
  horrible conditioning from childhood . 
  unless you have something congenitally wrong with you , get good advice on grooming and dressing and then forget about it . 
  then find a social anxiety group to help you deal with the problem . 
  i was born because my mother was afraid of my dad leaving her . 
  she was honest about it . 
  yes, 
  very true - a little more info . 
  the soviets were shocked ; khrushchev 's son explain the utter terror in the kremlin that they would be blamed and war would start . 
  rfk and jackie both sent back channel communications to the soviets letting them know they were n't suspected by the kennedy family . 
  that leaves the cubans . 
  from your description , it looks like they were trying to frighten you and your friend . 
  i do n't think they would have put on the high beams otherwise . 
  or , it could have been gang related . 
  so true !, 
  weird, 
  i also find it the strangest that he accurately pointed me to a spot of four leaf clovers , even if that was by pure accident . 
  he probably knew about it before . 
  yes , right now this is the best theory so far . 
  it fits the evidence - lho acted alone at dealy plaza . 
  he had just come back from mexico and told the cubans what he was thinking of doing to impress them . 
  the ** cia did stop all investigations into the mexico connection ** , as both embassies were under surveillance and they knew of lho 's visits and activities . 
  it was pretty blatant to the point that j edgar hoover caught them not sending this info to the fbi . 
  hoover was essentially cya - do n't try to pin this on us , you did n't tell us about lho 's activities or else we would located him before kennedy 's visit . 
  the cubans , thinking they had found a useful idiot , had lho meet with the kgb station chief in the russian embassy , who would only talk to him over the phone . 
  this person , first refused lho 's request to * re-defect to the ussr * because he thought unstable/suspicious and let him babble on . 
  the cubans did encourage him , only in that they did n't dismiss him and actually treated him courteously , with respect . 
  something no one else did in lho 's life at the time . 
  they did n't provide him with arms , co-conspirators or a getaway , etc. 
  cuba , unlike the ussr , went on high alert right after the assassination . 
  castro seems to have expected an invasion until - not clear how - he was reassured that the us would not fight a war over this . 
  well -- that 's why everyone thought it was a conspiracy . 
  even when it happened , if you view news reports from that time . 
  lho was a very disturbed individual . 
  the cia was tracking his activities , thinking he would lead them somewhere , so they do n't tell the fbi . 
  because they want to see where he goes . 
  the fbi does n't hold him because he is not on the radar . 
  i 'm not sure , but the secret service was n't notified either - they either were supposed to get the info from the fbi or cia - forget which . 
  it might be that a conspiracy was not uncovered , simply because everyone was trying to avoid culpability for the actions of a disturbed individual and stymied the investigation . 
  jack ruby points to internal political enemies , in my view . 
  but who knows . 
  the owners must be rich ; the pug looks like it understands , keeps looking up at his owner and doing his trade mark pleasure snort, 
  different cubans . 
  the mexico cubans were ** castro 's cubans ** . 
  lho wanted to defect to castro 's communist cuba and was seeking to impress them . 
  the mafia and the cia had ties to ** cuban exiles ** living in the usa and trying to overthrow castro and reestablish a capitalist dictatorship , like batista 's . 
  the mafia had lost their considerable investment in their casinos in cuba when castro nationalized them .
