  let 's not forget ray is just a television character . 
  in context , i think it meant sex . 
  absolutely ... so much was borrowed/lifted/inspired / etc. 
  this has always been the case with noir - people trace it back to early 20th century short stories and silent films . 
  the key ... 
  i think ... does it present a fresh , contemporary approach or is it a second-rate imitation ? 
  the jury is still out for td2 . 
  sorry -- i was just influenced by the suicide thread . 
  yes , it was the drugs . 
  hello ... this is everyone 's unanswered question . 
  all sort of theories -- none explain why he was allowed to live . 
  it 's unlike season # 1 -- it more like chinatown , james ellroy novels and the noir canon . 
  if you like noir ( not everyone does ) , you 'll like td2 . 
  the jordan/frank angle - well , let others more informed write about it . 
  ( i am on the fence on this , btw . ), 
  the biggest disappointment to me would be ray and ani riding off into the sunset , so to speak . 
  you seem confused , though . 
  many share your opinion , i am afraid . 
  noir is a specific style , with key dramatic elements -- the most important is paranoia . 
  the protagonists are n't paranoid , they are clueless . 
  at least until the last few episodes . 
  for noir to work , the paranoia needs to start much earlier . 
  in a sense det. 
  dixon was the most noir character because he suggested to avoid a shoot-out and wait until the perp walked out . 
  he knew things were n't what they seemed . 
  our heroes did n't . 
  do n't wait until you get a review . 
  this is n't a `` getting over it '' situation . 
  you need to be proactive . 
  being torn down the way you describe sounds like they are building a case against . 
  so , first things first --, 
  - is there anyone that can give you an honest assessment of said work ? 
  is it really bad or not ? 
  because your response will depend on this . 
  - most likely , your work was okay at the beginning then started to degrade as the abuse took its toll . 
  please understand that if this is the case , it is being done on purpose . 
  - go see a doctor and get time off from work . 
  try for at least a week . 
  or , go on vacation . 
  - update your resume and visit the appropriate agencies during your time off . 
  when you get back , this is what you do during these `` counseling sessions . '', 
  - do not respond to the person emotionally , keep a blank face . 
  - on a small notebook , take notes on what the person says . 
  - do n't ask for clarification unless absolutely necessary . 
  ** under no circumstances , get yourself in an argument defending yourself **, 
  - when asked if you have questions , say no , or limit yourself to at most two . 
  very specific - takes notes during the answers . 
  - basically delay everything until you have another job . 
  turn things in right when they are due , not before . 
  if they begin the process of firing you , ** read the handbook ** and find and use every avenue to delay until you can leave . 
  if your work is still good , then go to everyone that sees it and ask for advice on how to improve and mention your sessions with the boss . 
  you are looking for allies - i think you will find out all sorts of interesting stuff . 
  do what i mentioned earlier regarding counseling , etc. 
  if the work is and has always been below par - you need to determine if this is the right field , etc. 
  do what i mentioned earlier regarding counseling , etc. 
  regardless of the cause , you need to be proactive and leave this situation before you deteriorate further . 
  wow -- this is so imaginative , he needs to write fiction . 
  oh ... he 's a politician , he already is producing fiction . 
  can one still be summoned to rome ? 
  this picture should be a classic -- please send to the holocaust museum . 
  first class stuff - absolutely . 
  vince vaughn wakes up and tells jennifer aniston he had a strange dream . 
  he looks at the ceiling and begins describing it . 
  she interrupts . 
  `` ok , stop talking . 
  no more dreams , no more childhood stories , and stop it with avocado trees . 
  this is why we are breaking up . '', 
  love the caricatures - your kevin spacey is great . 
  in this set , i love paul and frank best , but all are great . 
  could refer to the raven flying near the vw minivan . 
  this makes them think they parked in the wrong place . 
  we like to take the car and re-park it the same spot but backwards , like taillights in first . 
  they will think they are crazy . 
  i do something similar . 
  i am a white cuban with no accent in either english or spanish living in miami . 
  i get tired of tourists asking for directions in spanish . 
  so , i say in english accented spanish - `` noh ahh-blow espanol . '', 
  i am being serious -- a startled `` take me to your leader . '', 
  why not begin with a little levity . 
  i was born in havana . 
  so , i would say , rum & coke ( cuba libres ) , mojitos , and daiquiris . 
  listening to my parents , pre-castro havana was one big party . 
  agree -- more people need to be aware of this . 
  no they are not , sorry . 
  the uk 's troops are on it , it 's theirs . 
   you 're a batista supporter , of course you 'll side with thatcher ... how thrilled are you for marco rubio ? 
  not a batista supporter , my family was against him during both terms . 
  thatcher was a conservative of the worst kind . 
  rubio is a lightweight . 
   i would love to see ray tell ani about killing the guy he thought was the rapist, 
  yes , ray is the anti-elliot . 
  elliot would not impose his will on others - a wonderful philosophy ; but is it realistic ? 
  i mean he did what elliot shoulda done , but it was completely messed up . 
   she really seemed jealous when ani and ray were talking at the bar . 
  strange , but i like her and ray more the ray and ani . 
  she seems like a lovely person who wanted to get ray out of town because she is worried about him . 
  she has scars on the outside , ani on the inside . 
  i hope she makes to san miguel allende with ray . 
  i can see knifing someone in a last ditch effort . 
  having been brought up in a machista culture - when my friends and i hit puberty , all our fathers began talking about how they would kill anyone who raped us .
