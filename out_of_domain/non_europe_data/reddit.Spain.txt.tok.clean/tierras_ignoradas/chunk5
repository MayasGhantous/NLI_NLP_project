  larger than the soviet union 's ? 
  this makes more sense than person or persons unknown stole the plane . 
  illuminatedowl , please !, 
  it is not going to fall on you or hurt you , the plane wo n't come anywhere the us . 
  this is wonderful -- i have been thinking of doing this for my pug . 
  i agree with your theory - i also felt the flight to the andaman islands before the turn south was made to avoid radar along sumatra , malaysia , indonesia , etc. 
  this is very good , please keep posting it , so it does not get buried beneath comments about aliens , malaysian authority incompetence , hijackers with long-range , secret plans , etc. 
  this needs to be higher . 
  this is excellent -- and the info about him being on leave , from a malay language site is very good investigating . 
  perhaps the steep climb to 45k ft was to throw everyone off balance at the very beginning right before he depressurized the cabin . 
  take care . 
  i do n't think you need anti-depressants or anything like that . 
  this is simply a bit of growing up that you have to do . 
  yes , things would have been much better if you had been accepted , but they rejected you - probably out of meanness . 
  cliques like fraternities only exist if they have someone to exclude - otherwise what is the point . 
  this does n't make easier when you are the one being targeted for exclusion ; but ... well ... that 's the whole point . 
  you are supposed to feel `` less than . '', 
  you did n't do anything wrong - if you were `` wrong '' for the fraternity , someone should have told you in high school to not to get your hopes up . 
  by waiting until rush week , they revealed they were planning a switcheroo all along . 
  you need to forget and move on ... accept it for what it was , do n't analyze it , and never speak to anyone that reminds you of it again . 
  concentrate on what you can do today to make things better for yourself . 
  or , more simply ... stopped crying over spilt milk and carry on . 
  d_ne -- i agree with 1000_eyes ; you should not breed pugs ( or any other breed for that matter , but especially pugs ) . 
  i let my little girl have one litter - thinking she would want this . 
  i was wrong . 
  she was terrified of the birth , i did n't know she was in labor . 
  i ran to a pet emergency clinic where they had to induce labor . 
  she hated the puppies . 
  after much effort , i raised four lovely puppies , found them all good homes and even visited them 1 year later . 
  the whole thing , including prenatal visits , induced labor , vaccinations for the puppies , deworming , etc. , cost over $ 2000 . 
  if she had not had induced labor , she might have died . 
  i had no idea what to expect and did n't even recognize she was in labor . 
  this last because the vet thought she was much less further along than she was . 
  we were n't expecting for a few more weeks - so yes , maybe pugs carry in a way that seems less far along . 
  but i do n't know . 
  when she got preggers the second time ( to that handsome pug two doors down ) , i aborted and fixed her . 
  no way was she going to be a puppy machine . 
  how do those french bulldogs sneak in ? 
  there are pug meet ups in many cities . 
  that everyone who is having a hard time is somehow completely responsible for their circumstances . 
  there are evil people everywhere , who commit acts of abuse , both large and small , with impunity . 
  there are many victims . 
  but , calling them out would break the social contract . 
  the first us president to try to legislate some form of national healthcare was theodore roosevelt ( 1901-1908 ), 
  this will get buried , but here goes -- i was born in cuba , raised in the us , spent most of my life in international business . 
  i have met people from all over the world . 
  a great conversation starter is always - what do you think about america ? 
  everyone has an opinion . 
  of course , the guns , the friendliness ( bothers the russians a lot - `` all that smiling '' ) , the patriotism , the openness and largeness of the place . 
  very similar . 
  two comments always struck me --, 
  * 1 - ** a japanese gentleman explaining why he wanted his son to have a green card ** - `` you see in america everything is possible , and in japan so many things are not possible . '', 
  he meant that americans had much more latitude to determine their own destinies and identities . 
  * 2 - ** a belgian living in florida ** mentioned that he despite the friendliness , he perceived that ** americans are much lonelier ** than other people . 
  and , it is true - americans move around more and do n't have as many life long friends , multiple marriages are common and families sometimes only meet during thanksgiving . 
  ( which can be traumatic , as i understand it . ), 
  but it 's more that - and it gets to what the japanese man stated , the same freedom to create themselves also makes americans much lonelier . 
  the price of individualism , the lure the open road . 
  this is just excellent -- the whole chinese just finding it is so out coincidental . 
  once the japanese accept you as part of their group , you are part of their family , so to speak . 
  well the belgian was in florida and japanese man in la. 
  these areas have more transient populations . 
  yes -- this really explains what i was getting at . 
  yeah -- that 's why i do n't understand the american dream in denmark - the lure of what open road . 
  i totally agree about the open road illusion . 
  my pug snoring at the foot of the bed - who is that ? 
  i am not sure the average ukr would be better off part of the eu - they will have to pay back loans , under imf austerity measures . 
  under putin , the ukr currency dissolves and they join the russian federation . 
  no eu , no imf , nothing . 
  totally agree that gas subsidies are not used for development . 
  having relatives in spain , i am not a fan of the eu ; having lived and worked in latin america , i do see the imf as benevolent . 
  the old loans represent money that was to a great extent stolen ; i disagree that the general population has to pay for this to avoid default . 
  look at iceland - that 's the model , imho . 
  wow - sorry , no can do -- if i did n't borrow the money for speculative real investments , i should n't pay . 
  two parties are responsible :, 
  * the borrower - seize his assets . 
  * the lender who the made the unwise investment while chasing yield . 
  good to know your wife has you in portugal and therefore has options . 
  i am afraid the ukr is on its own . 
  i live in the us and no one here wants war and putin knows it . 
  take care, 
  this !, 
  i had a weird guy following me around in publix and asked a cashier to walk me to my car . 
  he stopped following when he saw that . 
  again , you are the voice of reason - malaysia should not be allowed to be alone in a room with them ... 
  i would let the aussies keep them . 
  i know what you are going through -- you need to break off all contact . 
  it 's tough , but the first step . 
  me , too - this is vizcaya, 
  this is awesome !, 
  i agree with this distinction - if not related specifically to commerce - then dedicated office space goes back to the beginning . 
  in the middle ages , many church buildings , palaces , and monasteries could also be considered offices - in the sense of spaces dedicated to administrative work . 
  however , i seem to remember reading translations of sumerian tablets , where there would disputes over merchandise that needed to be resolved . 
  i mean countless complaint tablets - someone needed to be writing , noting , archiving and , hopefully resolving these issues . 
  presumably they needed space to work .

  thank you very much, 
  what is the difference between athena nike and pallas athena ? 
  wow - thanks !, 
  i am sorry - but what are you implying ?
