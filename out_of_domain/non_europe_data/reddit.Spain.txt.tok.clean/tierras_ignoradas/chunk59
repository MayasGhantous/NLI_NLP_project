  a real heart attack ? 
  in new york , where he did n't have time to get to a hospital in time ? 
  edit : i am was being sarcastic . 
  oh ... that 's probably already happening . 
  trump put up the let 's make a deal sign right after the election . 
  what trump does n't realize is : if he does n't come through , he 's dealing with some unforgiving characters . 
  i wonder how putin feels about all this coming to light ? 
  how does netanyahu respond now that he has reneged on the one-state solution ? 
  even taiwan - two china/one china policy . 
  china broke their own law to give a trademark on his name right after he reneged on his promise to taiwan . 
  i did n't think of that , but yeah . 
  absolutely . 
  ** norman ** is ironic to ** normal ** . 
  and ** norman bates - really means norman baits . 
  ** he uses his motel as bait for lonely travelers . 
  you can see this when anthony perkins looks up from his reading at marion 's car to see if it will stop . 
  moreover , he already has the peephole drilled , and the lake scouted . 
  the police mention that they pulled many ditched cars from it . 
  good point . 
  my favorite is asshai because it permeates so much of their world and , i think , is based on a legendary city : scholomance in romania . 
  excerpts from wikipedia below . 
  keep in mind that many go to asshai to learn the dark arts , including our favorite red priestess , melisandre . 
   the scholomance was a fabled school of black magic run by the devil , supposedly located near an unnamed lake in the mountains south of the city of hermannstadt in transylvania . 
   here the devil taught all the secrets of nature , the language of animals , and all imaginable magic spells and charms . 
  only ten scholars could matriculate at a time . 
  after finishing their courses , nine sorcerers returned to their homes ; the tenth remained with the devil as payment . 
  he rode on a zmeju ( dragon ) and became the devil 's aide-de-camp . 
   the small lake , immeasurably deep , high up among the mountains , supposedly held the cauldron used to create thunder . 
  in fair weather , a dragon slept beneath its waters . 
   the nine remaining sorcerers , known as solomonari , are `` tall , redheaded men clad in white wool ... [ possessing ] several instruments of magic and a book of instruction . '', 
  asshai is also a formerly large , now depopulated city , devoted to religion . 
  rome in the dark ages is good for this . 
  i have n't been able to locate asshai 's other characteristics : the polluted river with deformed fish , the creepy black stones , the absence of children , the grim countenance of the citizens , a place so poisoned it has import food and water . 
  you are right ; glass candles may be magical objects that mimic advanced technological equipment , such as light bulbs , phones , even skype . 
  without electricity and generators , it 's hard to posit they technologically advanced devices called by different names . 
  dany , if jon is a love child . 
  jon , if he is legitimate . 
  as the last male of the first born male , he is the precedes dany and viserys . 
  just like prince george precedes prince harry in the uk . 
  during watergate , nixon who started with 60 % approval rating at his inauguration , reached around 30 % four months before his resignation . 
  he lost 30 points in approximately 16 months . 
  despite everything that happened those last four months , the approval rate did not decline . 
  those supporters became known as the `` nixon dead-enders . '', 
  obviously , more than 100 words is too much for the tea party representatives controlling the house . 
  many of the people left behind by neo-liberalism live in the blue firewall states . 
  they took them for granted because no one ever spoke to them . 
  trump did because he lies shamelessly . 
  a jackhammer inside my head pounded as i woke up from a blackout . 
  through the slits of my red-shot eyes , i saw mabel sitting in front me . 
  `` jimmy-boy , you got ta stop doin dis . 
  a woman ere waitin for ya . . '', 
  with enormous effort , i moved my head to see . 
  an old broad , face ravaged by liquor and cigarettes . 
  she looked rich ; i got interested . 
  yep . 
  not to mention , the elites do n't want to share their money with the working class . 
  she did n't have insurance through her work ? 
   but it was different with him , it 's hard to articulate what was different , it just was . 
  how did you feel about it ? 
  sometimes hard to articulate things can be expressed through your reaction to them . 
  coke from cans is swill compared to a fountain coke , one with the right combination of syrup and seltzer . 
   said they were very particular about employee dress ,, 
  in high-end hospitality , this is a par for the course . 
   the people he dicked over in real estate, 
  tbh , you ca n't survive in real estate otherwise . 
  the education scams were probably an ill-considered venture , where some charlatan got trump into the for-profit college scam when so many people thought it was an excellent idea . 
  your overall point is well-made . 
  does it matter if trump is kind to his employees when he 's in the mood and a jerk to others when real money is involved ? 
  no , the issue is whether he will be an effective president . 
  wil we think we are better off in 2020 than four years earlier . 
  the suits -- some unfortunate children do this because their parents approve . 
  can someone please explain to me what a darknet is and what is a rando hacktivist collective ? 
  i am not so sure . 
  you are assuming trump takes a hard line against russia . 
  i do n't he can , at this point . 
  the infighting is putin 's biggest problem . 
  the kremlin is not a one-man dictatorship ; it 's a group of people representing different interests . 
  like the old soviet politburo . 
  some in the kremlin advised against dealing with trump and messing with the us election was too dangerous . 
  they were forced out . 
  if this blows up in putin 's hands , some influential russians will be very disappointed . 
  remember how they got rid of khrushchev after the missile crisis . 
  page appeared on a british newscast and was grilled in a way that it became obvious he was guilty , although he did n't admit it . 
  when he said fake news , the interviewed ended .

   and even if you ca n't be successful at any level without being scummy , why is someone who has no problem screwing people over for his own financial gain the type of person we want for president ? 
  i agree with your opinion . 
  thanks !, 
  thanks !, 
  yes , putin 's problem in a nutshell . 
  the sanctions are now politically radioactive . 
  in trump 's case , i would hate to be on putin 's bad side . 
  thanks !, 
  i think the cat is out of the bag on the sanctions . 
  everyone is talking about a spy revolt , but that 's not what should worry trump . 
  essentially , all spy agencies know about trump 's issues with russia and ukr . 
  so , even if he muzzles the fbi and cia , the brits , canadians , nz and australia ( the other part of the five eyes that share information ) can leak damaging information to their press . 
  same for the israelis ( already double-crossed on the promise of a one state solution ) and various intelligence agencies in the eu . 
  so , he can keep his head down and control us investigations . 
  but , if he moves to overturn the sanctions , then all the above agencies start pushing again .
