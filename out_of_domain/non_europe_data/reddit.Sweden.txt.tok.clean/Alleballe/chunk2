  my opinion is that asians are far to hard to beat in starcraft 2 . 
  damn you south korea for being so good !, 
  and thank you for making e-sports a thing !, 
  greetings cock !, 
  svtplay, 
  got a degree in engineering fom a hve ( higher vocational education ) - school . 
  working as an hvac-engineer now . 
  works is overwhelming and there 's a huge lack of engineers in this field . 
  i studied for a bachelor 's in computer science and only had 1 term left when i dropped out . 
  shit was n't funny anymore and i had a couple of jobs before settling with the hve just so i could get a job with a decent salary for minimal effort . 
  back to the topic . 
  it 's incredible easy to get a job in the hvac buisness and the salary is good . 
  the stuff a swedish hvac-engineer do is a bit different then in the rest of the world in that you have to be able to do heating , ventilation , airconditioning , cooling , plumbing and gas-systems . 
  usually when i speak to foreign consultants they have separate guys for most of those jobs . 
  this is my favourite swedish folksong : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfyvcz7h3o0,

  my advice is to skip the `` trying '' part in `` i 'm trying to learn swedish so i 'm going to write it in swedish '' and go for `` i 'm in the process of learning swedish . '', 
  it implies that you 've got your mind set on it . 
  it 's never wrong to show confidence when applying for a job . 
  sweet !, 
  perfekt !,

  i have n't bought one yet because i still have too good framrates with my two 7950boost in cf but i dream about the 970 and 980 almost every night . 
  but my guess is that it 's because the same traits that gave us well-paying jobs also made us informed enough to choose pc-gaming over peasantry . 
  i bet you can still get better performance then with a console with that , 
  well , you can comfort yourself with the fact that you use mouse and keyboard instead of handcontrollers . 
  ehm , what ? 
  yeah , thing is . 
  we probably get the same framerates if we use the same gpu .

  there 's nothing there in terms om native art or home-made jewlery worth bying in my opinion . 
  yes .

  i usually buy it at the local store . 
  it 's more like 4chan but for sweden .

  stayings away !,

   are there things i should know ? 
  there 's nothing you really need to worry about . 
  i do n't think there are any major do n'ts in sweden . 
  try not to stand in peoples private space when you talk to them . 
   how expensive is beer in sweden ? 
  you get decent beer for 1-1 .5 euros in our government run & regulated line of shops called [ systembolaget ] ( http://www.systembolaget.se/english/ ) . 
  in a bar you 'll end up paying around 5 euros for 45cl of their worst beer . 
   also , if i 'm allowed to study in sweden it 'll be from september till november . 
  which part ?
