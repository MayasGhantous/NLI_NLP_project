  there 's really a quite big difference in climate depending if you 're going to the southern or the northern parts of sweden . 
  ok , then the weather is nothing to worry about .

  what ? 
  is there something wrong with the photo ? 
  thanks btw , going to use the drawing you made as my new fb profile pic !, 
  i can see why being fed lies by friends and family your entire life and suddenly realise it would bring a person to depression . 
  i do n't envy people who has to through the painful process of dropping their religion . 
  i 'm grateful i never belived the priests or the stories in the bible . 
  being an atheist does n't affect my mental health negatively . 
  my first thought was : `` are you living in lule\u00e5 ? '', 
  because this perfectly describe the situation . 
  either people do n't use the turnsignals or they use use them incorrectly . 
  on topic : i know that i use them correctly because i check from time to time just so i can be a besserwisser . 
  i always use the turnsignal because i would n't want to give other people the same fear of being crashed into as people who do n't use the turnsignal gives me . 
  i feel that the subject is relevant and that people need to take it seriously . 
  as long as he has a pci-e slot he 's fine . 
  i have one of those gfxcards and my 500w power supply is more then enough . 
  i think he will be fine .

  i live and work in lule\u00e5 and as far i can tell the biggest problem you face is n't not being able to speak swedish when you are looking for a job . 
  the biggest problem is that there are no jobs to be had . 
  if you want a job you better have an education , a few years experience in the field and you are expected to work full time . 
  if you do n't speak swedish does n't matter . 
  i 'm pretty sure they are all taken already . 
  the youth unemployment is fairly high here . 
  you have to fight tooth and nail for the low wage jobs . 
  selling sex is n't illegal in sweden and you do n't have to pay incometax for sexwork . 
  just sell your body at a high price . 
  another option is to get into the real estate busines . 
  klokt !, 
  best feeling ever . 
  men so what ?

  but it has been posted here , like a million times . 
  lights out . 
  but why does that have to be depressing ? 
  the universe is fking amazing and i live and amazing life . 
  i know that i will grow old and die , probably experience alot of pain during the process . 
  but that does n't bring me down . 
  i plan on making life worth it while it lasts because i do n't think it 's reasonable that all this is created with me in mind and that `` there 's a plan for me '' . 
  the problem with worrying about death is that it takes time away from life . 
  my worst problem with the concept of heaven is that you can only enter it if you avoid doing alot of really fun stuff in life , like sex before marriage and eating shrimp . 
  let 's say you avoid doing that in life and make it into heaven . 
  i do n't think the guy who told you not to do those things in life is all too keen on letting you do them in heaven . 
  that would mean you go through life not doing stuff you like just to end up in a place were you are n't allowed to do them for eternity . 
  yeah . 
  the concept that jesus took the punishment for all our `` sins '' is disturbing in many ways . 
  it lets you off from responsibility for your actions and lets you into heaven regardless of what you have done . 
  if there was a heaven and you got there by asking for forgiveness you would probably not like the experience though . 
  you still like the stuff god do n't like . 
  there 's really not alot of people who should be able to find joy in heaven if it existed .

  just det. 
  everything has changed so significantly since you were last online . 
  in my opinion it does n't matter if you choose to use it on a completely new toon or and old one . 
  the tradeskills take no time at all to level from zero to six hundred once you reach the latest content so do n't take any old tradeskill levels into consideration .
