   hey guys !, 
  is sweden really the perfect place to live ? 
  in general , is society happy with the government and the decisions they make ? 
  sweden is n't the perfect place to live in . 
  we are not at all happy with the current government and we were fed up with the last one so we changed . 
  but even so sweden is still probably the best country in the world to live in . 
   i always take your country ( denmark and finland too ) as an example of ` how a country should be managed ' in terms of human rights , equality and economic stability . 
  it is pretty good , not perfect but if you compare it to the rest of the world it 's by far the best . 
  not because our way is the perfect way of doing things but because everyone else is so horrible at handling stuff . 
   i play dota 2 and csgo . 
  i also play eve online . 
  i thought every single one of those games were toxic communities . 
  and your first approach to the sc2 community is `` go fuck yourselves . 
  all of you '' . 
  486 dx4 100mhz, 
  oh it was really small and did n't need an active fan . 
  it was really quiet unlike the harddrive . 
  whatever you do , do n't try to hitchhike . 
  in 2009 i picked up a german guy in skellefte\u00e5 on my way to lule\u00e5 . 
  he told me it had been fairly smooth to hitchhike from stockholm to ume\u00e5 but it had taken him two days before he got a ride from ume\u00e5 to skellefte\u00e5 and he had been standing for another two days in skellefte\u00e5 before i came along . 
  i gave him a ride to lule\u00e5 but i 'm not sure he reached his final destination which was sarek national park . 
  perhaps [ this ] ( http://www.svansele.se/en/ ) might be what you 're looking for . 
  [ l\u00e4nk ] ( http://www.therichest.com/top-lists/top-100-richest-musicians/ ), 
  sure , check with [ tieto ] ( http://www.tieto.com/ ) for work and the [ migration office ] ( http://www.migrationsverket.se/english/private-individuals.html ) for information on how to migrate to sweden . 
  i 'd suggest that you farm in ashran . 
  i get so much honor on both my allie and horde chars in there that i do n't bother with bgs anymore . 
  actually that sounds like some really good advice . 
  if you ca n't handle a fat woman throwing glassware at you you might not be that big of a looser to stay committed to a crazy feminazi and you should move on . 
  perhaps he just misses the social aspect of life ? 
  have you tried not talking to him for a few weeks ? 
  shuting the hell up is a big part of being swedish . 
  my impression is that you are into art and that you think alot about what other people think about you . 
  it depends on the competition . 
  i have no idea how much you can ask for but if you move to stockholm i would n't be surprised if you could maintain that level of salary . 
   i want to sustain a family of 4 , kids going to a good nursery and kindergarten . 
  would be renting a 2-bedroom apt , preferably in a quiet nice area . 
  if that is all you want the money to cover then you do n't need more then $ 50 000 - $ 60 000 per annum , $ 30 000 - $ 40 000 if your wife works full time . 
  i should tell you since you are from germany that there are no real taxbenefits if your wife chooses not to work . 
  you are correct !, 
  they did a gig in lule\u00e5 last friday . 
  hehe , it is a bit of a giveaway !,

  you look like the kind of guy that sees an oilchange on your car as something challenging and you would prefer it if a real man could do it for you . 
  yeah i was n't going to mention your sexual attraction to your car ... , 
  brothers to be specifik ... 
  women do n't care for appearance . 
  they like : money and status . 
  get either one or both of them and you are set irregardless of your looks . 
  well then , you are set !,

  * 1 flaska absolut, 
  you look like you coach marines how to shoot their load over you just the way you like it . 
   contemporary atheist leaders, 
  wait what ?!, 
  we have leaders ? 
  i 'm so guilty of doing the same thing . 
  now that we live together i had to connect the extra computer to her tv since it was the only electrical equipment in our combined home not connected to a pc . 
  just nu ja . 
  * status, 
  sounds like someone is having a hard time grasping b\u00d6rk b\u00d6rk !, 
  i 'd say that the one thing you need to know about swedish culture to be able to work with swedes is that you do n't need to know anything about swedish culture to be able to work with swedes . 
  holy shit yes !, 
  if you have n't played through them already you drop everything you 're currently doing and start playing . 
  it may be hard to adjust to the controls but the story is so good !, 
  yes , plenty of people live here without knowing a word of swedish . 
  it 's possible to retire in sweden after living all your life on the wrong side of the atlantics . 
  however you will have to fund everything by yourself . 
  the government only gives a pension to swedish citizens . 
  when the doctor said it however ... 
  tvi tvi tvi . 
  men !, 
  the future holds great things for us indeed !, 
  google to hard for you ? 
  must be because you have n't managed to find out that it 's free in pdf-format all over the world . 
  you could just download the pdf and send it to a printing company . 
  have it custom made and be the hipster nazi .

  the ikea killings never included a beheading . 
  the rapewave is an exageration of epic proportions . 
  there has been alot of death-threats from muslims but only a few attempts on someones life has been made and except from the worlds clumsiest terrorists failed attempt in stockholm the only non-muslim target has been lars vilks . 
  how new are you to wow ? 
  have you reached lvl 100 yet ?
