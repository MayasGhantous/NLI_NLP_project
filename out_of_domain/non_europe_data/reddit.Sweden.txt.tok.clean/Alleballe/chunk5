  if you are still leveling i 'd say that anything goes when it comes to gear , as long as it 's cloth and have intellect on it . 
  getting gear comes naturally with questing and doing instances . 
  if you have reached lvl 100 and are looking into raiding i 'd suggest you visit icy-veins webpage and read up on the basics . 
  there are also alot of guides on youtube . 
   1 . is there racism against indians ? 
  you might experience racism but not particulary because you are from india . 
  people here would n't be able to tell were you are from but they might think less of you because you are a foreigner . 
   2 . how is video game industry in country ? 
  pretty fucking good . 
  3 . how government view video gaming ? 
  i do n't think they know about videogaming . 
  say what ?!, 
  men det skiter kommunen i. 
  `` ravioli ravioli give me the formuoli '', 
  just a sword/knife . 
  definitivt jo, 
  i still remember going banans in quake 1 and later quakeworld on a 486 with 12 megabytes system memory which the onboard gpu snatched some of . 
  the pic op posted makes me feel so fking old . 
  klart som fan det var du din pretenti\u00f6sa j\u00e4vel . 
  holy shit !, 
  glorious !, 
  [ i approve of your choices in life !, 
  31 and i 'm still certain that mumintrollen is a documentary and was filmen on location in finland and given a cartoonish look so it would n't scare away foreigners from visiting . 
  i forsee the title of your biography : `` a life full of rejection '', 
  being the victim of a group rape could explain the cum styled hair but not the thousand yard stare . 
  let me guess . 
  you have visited stockholm or one of the other asshat congregations in sweden . 
  [ vi vet ingenting ] ( http://www.svenskbladet.se/uploaded_images/moa_malm440x300_1259530234.jpg ), 
  det \u00e4r bara feelgood utan effekt , precis som earth hour . 
  sure you got time for that ? 
  it looks as if you are waiting for your next client to get his dick hard . 
   anything i can do about this ? 
  yes , do n't be offended by stupid people . 
  it 's not worth your time . 
  evil people like nationalists however should be a priority . 
  how much did you have to pay her to pose for this picture ? 
  how funny would n't it be if the shotguns really just were imported for legit huntingreasons ? 
  yeah they are probably not but you would n't be able to tell from normal huntinggear . 
  i 've been out hunting with far to many who look more like they are going into a warzone then going out to shoot some birds . 
  [ not really though ] ( http://i.imgur.com/b3jukdq.png ), 
  [ s\u00e5h\u00e4r ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvns8gwhde0&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=26m10s ) illa kan det g\u00e5 om s\u00e4kerhetsventilen till varmvattenberedaren har rostat fast . 
  would n't it be easier to draw the new border all the way down to the coast and at the finnish border . 
  i 'm sure stockholm and the rest of southern sweden wo n't mind . 
  they hardly know norrland exists . 
  hahahahahahahahaha !, 
  yeah . 
  he aint comming back man . 
  i forsee that we get the `` after picture '' for faces of meth in about 6 months . 
  nothing is really hard to aquire in sweden as long as it 's legal to own . 
  road to 69 ... 
  probably not since they usually do n't return the favour in prison . 
  enhance sham : such pets , very stormstrike , so selfheal , many purge , sweet ascendance . 
  han drar en [ carpe yolo ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbwbdn1huhe ) s\u00e5 \u00e4r han hemma i tid . 
  masturbate in public, 
  this is not 4chan . 
  but i can see why you might think that since op is a massive faggot . 
  i bet your partner still wants to do it with the lights turned of though . 
  stay strong kiddo . 
  [ det blir b\u00e4ttre ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohbv6hai1aq ), 
  i suggest you start looking for help with your life in general but in your case i 'm not sure there are any working treatments . 
  oy vey i think your parents have n't told you everything . 
  you seem like a very kosher shiksa !, 
   im not fat im fluffy, 
  you 're not good looking either !, 
  insatsstyrkan . 
  men v\u00e4nta nu . 
  just keep eating man , getting slim ai n't gon na help !, 
  \u00c5h\u00e5 ? 
  oh yes i will, 
  y not both ? 
  how come the pipes to the radiator on floor seven turn left just before the ceiling but seem to be passing through floor eight ? 
  it 's as if the pictures are in the wrong order . 
  aaaw , that 's so sad . 
  they have so much in common . 
  how come they ca n't be friends ` ? 
  tableflip-moments :d, 
  you think they 'd go through the hassle of suing me when they could simply just send a hitman ? 
  no probably not though i bet noone would be surprised if they did . 
  they do however have a habit of getting really angry at people who talks shit about what a backwards fucking shitty county they are . 
  that would be the best solution for everyone on the planet . 
  not everyone in nazi germany was a bad guy , in fact most germans were n't nazi party members , but it 's totally acceptable to attribute bad behaviour to nazi germany in it 's entirety . 
  slow down salman . 
  i was n't talking about saudis supporting isis . 
  i 'm talking about saudi arabia being probably the worst place on earth . 
  it 's governed by a monarch and it 's legal system is based on sharia . 
  what the general person in saudi wants to do in life has nothing to do with this . 
  it 's what the saudi officials fuck up in saudi arabia and elsewhere that is comparable to nazi germany . 
  living in saudi arabia is as far as the rest of the world is concerned just as bad as living under isis rule . 
  which song is that ? 
  yes it does . 
  i imagine that somewhere in sa there 's sitting a guy yelling at his screen : `` more saudis are is then germans where nazis !, 
  so sa and isis conflict is comparable to catholics and protestants in northern ireland ? 
  i think we at least can be a bit glad over the fact that we ca n't find a perfect comparison to the sadui vs is conflict, 
   the principal threat in the kingdom is boredom , not stoning . 
  the principal threat ** from ** the kingdom and isis is the same though , namely export of an extremely shitty form of islam . 
  the only thing that separates the two groups from each other is the method they use to spread it . 
  isis uses twitter and sa offers to build mosques around the world with the condition that they get to choose imam . 
  we could always take a look at the conditions which guestworkers from india live in and work under in sa if we wanted to further smear shit over sas reputation . 
  i do n't hate the player , i hate the game . 
  the people in ksa are n't responsible for what their government does , it 's not like they got to vote on anything .
