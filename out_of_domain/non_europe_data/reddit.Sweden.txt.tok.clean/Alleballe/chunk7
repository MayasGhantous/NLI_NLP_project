  this is like saying : `` if we make it illegal people will just continue doing it in secret and that would force us to crack down on it in order for it to stop . 
  and we do n't like enforcing ours laws so we are just going to make it legal '', 
  this is so fucking wrong on every level . 
  why is cracking down on people who want to destroy other peoples genitalia wrong ?

  i too feel that the zone could use some tweaking . 
  the effort/skill needed to navigate the area is too great for people to do it instead of just bruteforcing through or using gliders to circumnavigate difficult parts . 
  having loads of random heroes show up and slaughter all the guards multiple times per day does take away from the whole `` oppressed society '' - feeling . 
  in my opinion the guards need to be alot harder to kill and perhaps a bit easier to avoid . 
  yeah that 's absolutely true but my regard is that instead of having a sneaky zone were one would spend perhaps a bit more time for each quest but still having fun sneaking around we are stuck with a zone were people either rage behind their screens as they are detected for the fiftyninth time in five minutes or just bliz through with great vengeance and furious anger . 
  yes it is one way to look at it , that it 's just a labeling issue and smacking a `` group '' - label on the quest would end all discussion .
