  it 's crazy rap , is n't it ? 
  or is it called colt 45 ? 
  i blew some air out my nose, 
  light beer is misunderstood by beer enthusiasts , they usually say it 's beer that tastes like water , but they should think of it as water that tastes like beer !, 
  here have an \u00f6, 
  emma used to have a huge crush on tom felton , she mentions it in a couple of interviews, 
  you can pretty much always play the pentatonic scale over any song and it will sound ok . 
  if the song is in c major , you can play am pentatonic , if the song is in em , play em pentatonic . 
  basically , if it 's a minor key , play the minor pentatonic in that key , if it 's in a major key , play the minor pentatonic in the relative minor . 
  this only works if the song is the same key throughout the whole song . 
  start simple , work your way up . 
  you can get a 12 bar blues in whatever key , and play the pentatonic or blues scale in that key over it , as long as you stay in the scale you will always be in key . 
  try to play songs that stay in the same key throughout the whole song ( or maybe one key change , as long as you know when it happens you should be able to handle it , if not , that 's your next step , after you 're comfortable in the blues . ), 
  i read music terrorists, 
  we 're below schalke still , 
  when i was in beijing two years ago they were selling fake beats , but when they were shouting to us to come buy them they were saying ` beats headphones ' with an accent that made it sound like pizza-phones . 
  it was amusing , and now that 's what i call them . 
  well that 's just like your opinion man, 
  since when is arsenal swedish ? 
  is the background blurred with photoshop ? 
  the british are good at adding r 's as well, 
  do n't worry , show people this http://www.nextmovie.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/hhc-hi-res.jpg, 
  \u00d6zil and doge , brilliant . 
  you will win everything . 
  imagine taking that picture . 
  buildings collapsing in front of me , i better take a picture on the people behind me . 
  if he is n't worshiping the bagel god full time now i 'm disappointed . 
  you 're right , i accidentally that one . 
  wrote it all from my phone so mistakes are likely . 
  he 's right , i misspelled it . 
  and i wrote them all with the root of c , as the app was designed to pick a root , and then select which kind of chord you wanted to see in staff . 
  is that the right way to put it ? 
  in staff ? 
  i 'm not that good with english terminology . 
  yeah , i 'm a jazz guitarist , so your analysis is spot on !, 
  but alright , it 's a name for a function of a chord that 's enharmonically the same as a dominant , but is used as a predominant . 
  well , i guess , but i would write it out as a dominant rather than a german 6th . 
  generally i write things the way that makes most sense from my perspective , so that i can quickly see which chord to play and which notes to play over it , rather than which harmonic function it has . 
  unrelated , but i keep reading terrorists instead of theorists ... 
  i was about to ask how you would write it out if not as a ` root ` aug6 , but then i remembered that aug6 is probably not that common in music with the chords written out by name , as , like i said , i have n't seen it before . 
  so `` staff '' is like , the name of `` the lines on paper '' , rather than the `` language '' in which you write music , which would be `` notation '' ? 
  sort of ? 
  i found [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/2yexwhu.png ) on wikipedia which seems to show that an it +6 works in the same way as a tritone sub , the tritone sub even puts the db and b in the bottom/top to lead to c and c , it 's just written as an cb instead of b. huh . 
  i wrote on a comment a bit further down that i found [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/2yexwhu.png ) , which shows that it +6 is used in the same way as a tritone sub in jazz , which is pretty common . 
  jazz really did n't bring much new stuff to musictheory after all ... 
  whenever my dad comes into my room and i 'm playing a game , he casually says `` jobs done '' ... 
  '' ~ ~ almost politically correct ~ ~ * funny * redneck '', 
  yes , a 22 '' , plus a second monitor that i only use for spotify and chrome etc. 
  is there any kind of compatibility issues that i need to look out for ? 
  motherboard . . ? 
  unless there are some standard ? 
  my machine is pretty normal , i think it 's a bit taller than the old dell dimension ones i 've had before . 
  i 'm not sure how to check that pci-e and wattage , but i looked up what 's required for the card i already have and it said the following , which i guess i have in that case ... 
  - pci express \u00ae based pc is required with one x16 lane graphics slot available on the motherboard, 
  -400 watt or greater power supply recommended ^ 7 ( 500 watt for amd crossfirex \u2122 technology in dual mode ), 
  btw , what is crossfire ? 
  i 've seen it mentioned a couple of times here . 
  great minds think alike . 
  this is not a gif , but a damn good picture i saved , from when bvb beat bayern at i think pep 's first real game ? 
  maybe . . 
  # freeshinji, 
  i opened it up and took [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/cmjzcxa.jpg ) picture , it seems it should fi . 
  i 'm little worried that it would be hitting my ram slots though ( which are slightly higher than the gpu card , my photo angle makes it look different , so the card can continue quite a bit in a horizontal direction ) , as it looks to have large fans , but it would be put in upside down compared to the pictures in the newegg link , so it should n't be a problem , right ? 
  it seems i have pci e of some sort , but i do n't know how to check which kind . 
  [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/sglfyzq.jpg ) is what the psu label said , 500w max peak means up to 500w should be fine , right ? 
  [ chet baker ] ( http://www.biography.com/imported/images/biography/images/profiles/b/chet-baker-9195815-1-402.jpg ) ? 
  would it be enough for the 7750 you suggested ? 
  how about the 7870 that was suggested a bit higher up ? 
  man their legs are too long, 
  she 's so fine, 
  let 's see if someone gets it, 
  `` according to bild '', 
  good one !,

  leonard gren has a dayviews [ here ] ( http://dayviews.com/leogren/2006/10/ ) where you can find his stuff , there are quite a few ones with rebecca , and more pretty pictures !, 
  i tried centipede , water beetle and some scorpion when i was in beijing a few years ago . 
  even if you go into it thinking it ca n't be that bad , it really is . 
  tastes like anything fried at first , but the aftertaste is disgusting . 
  awful , would not recommend . 
  i can see just fine that close , i need my glasses for things that are 2 meters away and further, 
  well we could just play games instead of reddit, 
  or , adblock, 
  fcb and bvb in finals , just before the game someone leaks that g\u00f6tze is going to bvb , bvb wins .

  imagine it from her perspective , show a guy your room obviously hinting something , he says nice room and leaves . 
  shot down . 
  such lazy, 
  `` john guidetti commentating over his goal . '', 
  maybe ? 
  i love how cats walk backwards in that way when somethings stuck on their heads , that old one with the post it sticker is hilarious . 
  we can be your girlfriend , it 's ok, 
  i hope langerak is ok , he hit his face pretty hard during the 2-0 goal, 
  accounting is n't a competition ... 
  it sure is . 
  he seems to be using a dvi converter to a vga cable because his card does n't have a vga port ... 
  solitare and freecell are slightly different on 7 , my grandpa went back to his really old xp because he wanted the `` real '' freecell : /, 
  dvi has the same quality as hdmi , as they 're both digital , but vga is not .
