  google image search , legless lego legolas , second result . 
  i have absolutely no idea who did it first . 
  weaver, 
  bounty hunter, 
  she mentions her guy friends , i 'm sure they are happy now, 
  with mag you do n't need bf though, 
  good thing sony vegas has that logo thing that blocks the subs so i know which program to never use . 
  yeah \uc2a4 is `` s '' in the end . 
  i would write tess as \ud14c\uc2a4 though , \u3150 is `` ae '' ( pronounced as a single vowel , sort of like `` bear '' , and not `` ah-ee '' . ), 
  and \u3154 is `` e '' . 
  but now you can learn korean !, 
  these are soo smooth, 
  that 's where mmr is in ranked though, 
  a reason wow is so huge is that it 's relatively easy to run at an ok level on lower end pcs . 
  i have a lower end pc ( runs skyrim on low settings with decent fps ) and with ultra low settings i get an average of 15 fps . 
  is this something that can be optimized to work better ? 
  or its it simply targeted at higher end pcs ? 
  jun or jeon . 
  jeong would be \uc815, 
  i was listening to this song on the bus a year ago or something , and i was probably listening pretty loud , and my headphones are kinda leaky . 
  when it was my stop , and i got up to leave , the song ended , and there was a quiet moment between the songs , and i heard the dude who was sitting next to me say `` oh well , no more jazz ... '' to his friend . 
  i hope he was n't sarcastic about it ... 
  i did n't know i was forcing my music on people that much . 
  it 's more fun watching the kittens than the games, 
  live stream of a dota2 game championship qualifier . 
  they have kittens on a separate camera . 
  i do n't know how much calories is in a bavarian beer , but i think they count 50cl for a beer , and not 35cl like those links . 
  i 'm more like [ this . 
  ] ( http://37.media.tumblr.com/8f0b223fcfef4ef79b8ccc9eac5d708f/tumblr_miadpno4ir1rgz9z1o1_1280.jpg ), 
  i read japanese boner several times what is wrong with me, 
  we usually say something like `` ja !, 
  in that situation . 
  fat lawsuit from samsung though, 
  what about / r/wayandfood ? 
  there was a post somewhere on reddit that took up this issue , but it was comparing usa to the rest of the world . 
  they said that in just about every country except usa , you are always a foreigner unless your family has been there a few generations . 
  in usa , you are an american simply when you are an american citizen . 
  someone said that it is due to america having all kinds of nationalities , and a very small minority of native population . 
  in most other countries the population is fairly homogeneous , which makes the difference between native and foreign much more prevalent . 
  and we can buy cheap asian fake brand clothing that fits !, 
  it 's a decent show , i could do without the parallel theories or whatever they call them , but it 's not that big of a deal . 
  the zephyr days are over !, 
  all hail mvp !, 
  is it still no one doing softsubs for this show ? 
  ah i see , i did n't check the last post after i got the hardsubbed link . 
  cool !, 
  oh she romanizes her name as hyoseong on her instragram , cool . 
  they are not yet uploaded , the subbers said that they will do it tomorrow . 
  i got the sheet music at my other house , but yes it 's 11/8, 
  edit : actually checked the sheet , it 's 11/4 , check my link that i posted . 
  wildstar is by many considered to be a potential `` wow-killer '' , and without the lower end gamers it simply wo n't be able to compete . 
  i do have a better pc , where i max out skyrim , but on that pc , with ultra low on wildstar i get about 50 average fps , which is too low as well . 
  someone said it 's because i use an amd gpu and that for some reason wildstar performs worse on amd ? 
  i do n't know , now that the beta is over i 've decided not to play it anyways . 
  [ first part in the official sheet music ] ( http://i.imgur.com/h5ptu3h.jpg ), 
  i just watched 38 and 91 , gon na watch 140 as well before i watch this one . 
  so good !, 
  well , it 's credited to avishai . 
  for this particular book , shai maestro ( pianist ) is credited with compiling the charts . 
  there are 3 official songbooks , one for gently disturbed ( the whole album , which is where eleven wives is from ) as well as songbook 1 and 2 , which features various compositions by avishai . 
  they are all available for purchase [ here , ] ( http://avishaicohen.com/digitalshop/index.php?cpath=4&amp;oscsid=6a2dc008900d411870418af0375ea41b ) for $ 20 each . 
  http://kshowonline.com/ is another one . 
  wow i really did n't expect to see crayon pop for this week !, 
  but i guess bababa was a leg workout so why not, 
  dude will die, 
  nothing to see here , comments are shit . 
  well , did n't it go in again like right after ? 
  it 's not really the same ... 
  where is this from ? 
  what the fuck, 
  i used [ this ] ( http://www.aeriagloris.com/learnkorean/ ) flash game to learn hangul . 
  duolingo is being developed for korean to english right now , and english to korean will come shortly after . 
  until then i like http://www.howtostudykorean.com/, 
  the mmr system is better than most people seem to think . 
  just play ranked and you 'll get to where you should be soon enough . 
  they have [ ryu hyunjin ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hyun-jin_ryu ) which surely helps . 
  it might be different depending on which browser you have , but in chrome , you can right click a picture and choose to google search the picture . 
  the only `` delay '' in dota is turn rate and cast animations . 
  i heard people talk about the inbuilt delay way back in the beta , but i have never seen anything from valve about it . 
  all i know is that there is no such thing now . 
  this video should show how the courier starts its turn animation without delay . 
  this is done in a local game , so there is no server ping present . 
  huskar is kinda weak though , he wrecks in low tier pubs , but that 's about it . 
  different type of balancing . 
  in lol , spells scale with items , in dota , you need to balance your team hero picks so that you have enough early and lategame , this is done by utilizing those heroes . 
  spells and heroes are all strong in their own ways . 
  a 4 second stun in lol would be broken , in dota it 's not . 
  they are both moba games . 
  that 's the similarity . 
  the genre was called aos back in the days of custom maps in sc and later wc3 . 
  aos being aeon of strife , which i think was the first map that had that design . 
  hon is bleeding . 
  i watch heen stream whenever he 's on pretty much , is anyone else in the team streaming ? 
  or going to ? 
  and since he does n't have a twitter , maybe put his stream in the op ? 
  heen speaks english as well , he lived in nj for some years iirc, 
  i was playing a noobs only game on wc3 ladder way back . 
  my friend told me to pick lich , but he had no idea what to build , so i went desolator . 
  i have all my songs as mp3s , so i just import it to spotify and sync with my phone . 
  when i play i have 60-80 ping to euw , but when i refresh the server list i have 200 + to all servers ...
