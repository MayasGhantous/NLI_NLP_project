  i do n't trust that thing, 
  mvp i wan na get korea involved, 
  betting is illegal in korea . 
  people in starcraft got jail time for matchfixing . 
  i really doubt they 'd risk it . 
  technologic is 4 syllabels , re-buy it is 3 . 
  and they are going to start an english podcast soon , they just had the final episode of their swedish one . 
  as a swede , i occasionally say sentences in english with my friends . 
  we know both languages , and some sentences or phrases just sound better in one language . 
  my swedish vocabulary is by far the bigger one , but i do n't have to look up words in my english course literature for uni , so it 's not that bad . 
  skitfint, 
  the thing is , in res you can view pictures , gifs , videos and such in the reddit page , without opening the link . 
  if you open the image anyways , and then drag , it works . 
  so there is no loss . 
  where do you find the softsubs ? 
  play hereos you play well , and try to stay in about two positions that you feel comfortable in . 
  for me i usually play offlane , and when i wanted to climb i played almost only weaver and mirana , ( sorry about the potm ) and i 'm still above 60 % winrate with both , climbed almost 1k . 
  my friend did the same , but he was support and supporting jungle , playing aa and chen . 
  people who says that you ca n't climb as support probably buys wards and hug their carry all game thinking they 're doing fine . 
  when i think of mmr , i do n't see it as my allround dota skill , i see it as my most recent performance doing only what i did in those recent games . 
  if i played high impact mid heroes i would lose a lot before i 'd reach my solo-offlane-mmr . 
  for the trolls , try to be nice to people , even if the are mad . 
  you play to get better , not to win , really . 
  lliterally as old as the winter olympics , why are you posting this ? 
  is there possibly a set of images like this ? 
  with the rest of the girls ? 
  this just became my favorite picture . 
  [ alot ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_d_z-d2tzi14/s8trio4br3i/aaaaaaaacv4/zh7_gcmlrko/s400/alot.png ), 
  he 's been doing a bunch of sea casts lately . 
  i watched them live in dotatv , i think it was in the good play sea invitational together with blaze ( maybe ? ), 
  dives are bad , sometimes yellow , but headbutts are red . 
  no matter what came before . 
  double clicking blink will always give you the short blink though . 
  `` the term soccer originated in england , first appearing in the 1880s as an oxford '' - er '' abbreviation of the word `` association '' . '', 
  blame the english !, 
  this goalie just ca n't grip that ball . 
  leoric does ok though, 
  i personally think that necro ult should , because reasons, 
  eo usually does worse , people think of it as ee-oh instead . 
  because op only took the first part of the video , which was with 33 kids . 
  well there you go !, 
  pkf replaces mvp, 
  [ andwaeeeeeeeeeeeeee ] ( http://image1.frequency.com/uri/w354_h200_ctrim_ll/_/item/1/5/4/0/kwang_soo_s_andwae_compilation_running_m_154053509_thumbnail.jpg ), 
  in lol , you ca n't deny . 
  i 'm kinda new to pro smash , what is this `` jv '' stock people talk about ? 
  ah , thanks . 
  does the jv stand for anything ? 
  i 'm playing dota , so 9 is the way to go . 
  the `` russian '' server is located in stockholm , sweden , so yes , there is no real ping advantage for russians . 
  \\ # 20 though, 
  she picks mirana , she 's basically 5k, 
  no it 's illegal in korea . 
  her name can be romanized as yuna as well , it 's just not as common . 
  there is no correct way to romanize , \uc5f0\uc544 can also be yeona . 
  or yeon-ah . 
  or yun-ah . 
  like i said , there is no correct way to romanize it . 
  \u3160 is `` yu '' in written language , and often , but not always yoo in names . 
  for example , yura in girls day is \uc720\ub77c . 
  it would be yoora if what you said is the correct way to do it . 
  for some reason i ca n't seem to like anything fx does ... : /, 
  if you ca n't get it to work on itself , try this program http://www.dota-utilities.com/2008/11/downloads-warcraft-iiiwindows-mouse.html, 
  it locks your cursor in the current window by pressing a hotkey . 
  which is your favourite match ever ? 
  when you * feel * it, 
  end . 
  the last stop on busses or subway is called slutstation in sweden ( and probably norway as well ) .

  mvp-vp game 1 , not banned , not picked . 
  literally the first game of ti . 
  for medusa and gyro , mkb are better , because multi shots ca n't crit, 
  is n't cs at least 3 games ? 
  good for tobi and lumi , but i think i 'll be watching with korean casters anyways . 
  there is no `` european '' keyboard . 
  huh i did n't know g\u00f6ran would be george in english . 
  powertab and guitarpro can do it, 
  they also link to their memrise flashcards decks , which are pretty good . 
  which comes from [ beg - abracadabra ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofwfr8o8p0y ), 
  try / r/kpop , theres more where that came from, 
  well it is based on abracadabra , but slightly changed , yes . 
  / r/kpics, 
  i do the opposite , 0.01 % increase , but is like , a pink mankini , i 'll wear [ that ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-uwwyjc5zsdy/tjxkp7ogqdi/aaaaaaaaabe/npqxuljcyxy/s1600/nhbtk.jpg ) . 
  asians ... 
  when you get fat your waist to hip area kinda evens out , and underwear does n't have anything to hold on to . 
  i started with snsd shortly after their debut , 2007 sometime maybe ? 
  as for best year , i ca n't really pick , new songs are great , old songs are great , i 've liked kpop more and more for each year . 
  it 's by far my favorite genre right now because of the constant flow of great songs . 
  they do that a lot , they 're mostly just teasing, 
  except it 's no longer random . 
  it 's illegal , which is why they do this, 
  yes, 
  i really like both dortmund kits , might be expensive, 
  there is a beta for korean -  english , and they said english -  korean will come shortly after, 
  where is this from ? 
  winrate does n't mean anything in that way . 
  if you have above 50 % you are climbing in mmr , or running out of better opponents . 
  not a specific mmr value . 
  if someone is on reddit from the iss , how would it show on this map ? 
  i believe the dadd jazz light are .11, 
  it 's called fotmob .
