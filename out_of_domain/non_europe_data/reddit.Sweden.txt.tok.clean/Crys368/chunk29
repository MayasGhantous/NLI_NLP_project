  man i miss the good old days . 
  there was always one . 
  do n't lie . 
  all of them, 
  mediacrush works fine on my computer , but on my phone it does n't work properly . 
  it loads up , plays for a fraction of a second , and then stops , but the progress bar keeps going . 
  to watch it i need to spam pause/unpause to get that fraction of a second to play . 
  i use the stock browser on my galaxy s2 ( no space for other browsers ) . 
  oh and i ca n't get the download link to v work either ... gfycat is slightly more reliable but still not good . 
  sojungs birthday as well , she 's going in for surgery now and does n't even know eunb passed ... 
  it 's scary how often you hear about idols in car accidents , i guess it was just a matter if time before something serious happened . 
  i really wish they 'd take safety more serious now ... 
  nah they 're not , they 'll think you 're weird if you do . 
  it 's crazy . 
  another one from 9/11 , http://i.imgur.com/5jewx4i.jpg, 
  the techies hype to die ... 
  asia is just different , we do stupid weird shit as well .

  blueshell in dota , might as well have inhibitors , uh i mean rax respawn , right ? 
  to each his own i suppose . 
  every time this is posted i ca n't help but think tom hardy would be a great bond . 
  something about that last frame really reminds me of him . 
  right now i use the logitech g400 , best mouse i 've ever used . 
  well , you get 50 gold back , and a sentry has shorter duration than an obs . 
  worth it ? 
  not everyone , i only read manga ... 
  and yet the kamprad family does n't come close to what h&m boss stefan persson has . 
  ( kamprad family : 3.3 us $ billions , stefan persson : 28 ), 
  you get to pay for the assembly though , you wont save anything . 
  you 'll also get unbalanced performance ( powerful cpu , weak gpu , usually ) . 
  a cheap-ass psu ( on my pre-built from a few years ago the psu could n't even power the hardware it came with properly , and things started breaking ) , weak fans , sometimes not even a single case fan , with a shitty `` nice and small '' case , etc , so overheating and dust buildup can become issues . 
  if you want to upgrade things later on you got a bunch of parts you ca n't find info about , so compatibility can be troublesome , and limit your options . 
  in the end , it does n't really matter how you see it , it will be shitty value for your money to get a pre-built , non-gaming ones are not any better . 
  j.league , the japanese football league ? 
  i do n't watch it myself , but if you have n't tried it already , [ wiziwig ] ( http://www.wiziwig.tv/competition.php?part=sports&amp;competitionid=128&amp;discipline=football ) has never failed me before when it comes to football . 
  to be fair , without minwoo and his shenanigans s1 would 've been even more sleepy . 
  gladiator is top warrior spec , being the protection dps talent ? 
  swedish has the same enter key , but a little bit of \u00e5\u00e4\u00f6 around there as well, 
  the stockholm metro is actually an art gallery . 
  the architecture as well as using much of the advert space for artists to show their stuff . 
  i guess they all left after 0-3 in the first half, 
  yeah you 're right , they usually do n't wear seatbelts in the backseat . 
  due to many reasons , neither of which makes sense in my mind , but that 's how it is . 
  just tested this , my dps did not change when i did `` buy available upgrades '' for grant 's 25 % dps all heroes skill . 
  i just got the 25 % to all heroes from grant using the available upgrades button . 
  not any change whatsoever . 
  i just did a test , i ascended , got tree to lvl 10 , nothing else bought whatsoever , hit the buy all available to get his lvl 10 skill , no change . 
  got him to 25 , got his skill manually . 
  dps increased ... 
  i 'm not at my pc right now , but when i tested it , it seemed like it happened no matter what i did . 
  every upgrade i did with that button did not update my overall dps , it did update each individual hero dps though . 
  i should add that i play on armorgames , for the online save , so i do n't know if i 'd get the bug on main page . 
  someone said in this thread that it 's just a display bug , that the dps will update properly again if you buy something manually , i did not test this , but it seems reasonable as my progress does n't seem to slow down even when i buy most upgrades with that button . 
  i got 3k games on euw , never heard it . 
  first game i played on use everyone was a gamburger apparently . 
  looked through a semi dictionary i had , not sure how accurate these are , but yeah . 
  not just verbs , just a bunch of random words with repeated syllables .

  do n't shoot the messenger !, 
  the | z is \u3141 , | d is \u3142 , and the scribble 3 is \u3139 . 
  it has to do with stroke order and writing fast . 
  i 'm swedish , when strangers talk to me , i assume they 're drunk , have some mental issues , or they 're foreigners . 
  as long as you do n't talk to us , absolutely !, 
  we can be quite talkative on the internet , being anonymous and all . 
  unfortunately it seems like whenever i meet swedish people in games online , they 're assholes ... 
  i blame the lack of everyday social interactions . 
  it 's forced upon on us through school , work , sports , friends , etc. 
  i count that as foreigners , i always use my phone for directions , as do most of my friends . 
  it can be seen as creepy , although it does happen . 
  if you 're both at a party it 's fine though . 
  i guess it can be seen as a mental issue ... , 
  well , at bars people drink , right ? 
  so we do even . 
  yep , found the sd : are ... 
  we can be talkative , just not with strangers . 
  if you are colleagues then you are already past that stage . 
  mental issues \u2611, 
  but yeah those people would n't make much sense if they just stood by themselves all the time . 
  sure , but when i 'm out with my friends we often have small chats with other people nearby . 
  so social interactions with strangers do happen , occasionally . 
  answered this further down , but usually it 's through school , work , sports , friends of friends , and so on . 
  you basically either extend your social circle , or are `` forced '' to meet people through school/work . 
  you just think `` oh she 's pretty cute '' and that 's it . 
  it 's not that we stop ourselves from talking to strangers , it simply does n't happen naturally . 
  but yes , it 's really silly . 
  well , it 's not rude , it 's just weird and a lot of people are noticeably uncomfortable when strangers talk to them . 
  when foreigners do it it 's not as weird , but people usually do n't like it .
