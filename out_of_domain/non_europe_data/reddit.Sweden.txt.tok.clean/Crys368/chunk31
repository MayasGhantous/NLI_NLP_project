  your accent is very similar , but not as heavy , as my friend who 's from england , so that 'd be my guess , although i 'm not sure . 
  your r 's sounds slightly too far back in the mouth , if that makes sense . 
  in english the r 's are usually done by putting the tip of the tounge up towards the back in the mouth while the swedish are a bit more towards the teeth in the front . 
  also , when you said veta , it sounds a bit like you say vieta . 
  leffen chocolate feet kirby though, 
  so i study korean at uni , and everyone there 's at least semi-into kpop , so we 're all equal . 
  outside of uni , it seems like either people ask me to send some youtubes , songs ( or pictures \u314b\u314b ) or they just do n't give a fuck at all . 
  i also like to tell people there 's more than the girl group doll factory in kpop . 
  khiphop is my jam, 
  also , i 'm swedish , if that makes a difference . 
  the wow soundtracks i like the most would probably be karazhan and hellfire peninsula . 
  great music in that game . 
  some games age really well . 
  ok so i 'm short ( 5 ' 7 '' ) , so i do n't really belong here , but i was seated , like i did n't choose , [ this seat ] ( http://i.imgur.com/5icey5g.png ) once , for a 6 hour flight . 
  tall people did n't look to happy when they walked past me . 
  i have bad handwrting and when i write fast \u3139 usually looks like it does on that shirt . 
  http://help.diotek.com/data/diopen/android/10/resources/img-cons/04.bmp is basically how it happens . 
  bullshit but i liked it, 
  dota has big prizepools , but league is the bigger esport for sure .

  kagawas is pretty cool huh, 
  its really a 9 eposode series that someone put in one video , id recommend watching those shorter videos instead, 
  yes , ` studying ' and ` study ' would probably be the best translations . 
  uhh for me it removes borderless window mode which is a bit annoying , but fps got a lot better, 
  i might be wrong but i think i remember reading that its an obsolete consonant that was sort of z like . 
  i 've played kerbal for a total of 214 hours , ca n't remember it crashing ever . 
  my brother had frequent crashes though which turned out to be a corrupt savefile causing it . 
  yes , idk what those people are talking about ... 
  if i 'm not mistaken it would be `` il classico '' in italian either way . 
  the swedish keyboard has a button for \u00b4 ` . 
  \u00e1 becomes really easy for us , and we do n't have \u00e1 in our language . 
  we do n't have \u00e2 either , and we can still do it ( ^ + a ) . 
  same goes with \u00fc ( \u00a8 + a , we have special dedicated buttons for \u00e5\u00e4\u00f6 ) and \u00f1 ( ~ + n ) . 
  so , we have 3 more letters than you , and still have buttons for things we do n't use !, 
  oh this is my jam, 
  documentary and twitch . 
  well there 's lots of korean for memrise already , and several free online courses . 
  duolingo would be great , but japanese would also benefit from it , and japanese is still a much more popular language to learn for english speakers . 
  the time you 'll spend getting the smurf mmr to your real mmr will be slower than doing it on your main account , unless the smurf has a starting point closer to where you are . 
  the smurf will always have a mmr when starting ranked . 
  it uses your hidden mmr from playing normals until lvl 13 when calibrating your first ranked games . 
  these are some of my favorite ballads , you should be able to find them on youtube i believe . 
  i tried to get the most common english titles for them , i have many of them with korean titles , for vos - \uadf8\ub7ec\uc9c0 \ub9d0\uc790 i coulnd ' t find it with english title anywhere , or at youtube at all , but i found the video here http://pann.nate.com/video/215506389 so i left it in korean . 
  it 's geureoji malja if you want it romanized . 
  i 'll see about adding links for these later on if i have time , but like i said you can probably find them fast with some copypaste to youtube . 
  some new , some old , some ballad singers , some idols , some are more soul/rnb some are standard ballads .

  its funny that \ud55c\uae00 itself is romanized with u rather than eu , i guess it is using an older standard ? 
  putting this sub on my frontpage was a great decision . 
  i did not read which sub this was from when i saw it , i just thought that it was a pretty cute commercial . 
  the title was subtle enough . 
  good job .

  dotabuff calculates things differently , i had to do 15k hero damage , and i completed it , but dotabuff said i did 11.4 k.

  i have bound my scoreboard so i can still swap without problem . 
  is n't it bound to something by default ? 
  my parents have never supported my gaming , they would just say things like dont play that game if you 're going to be unable to help us, 
  sure , being with friends , even if all we did was gaming , was always fine . 
  the problem was that doing it alone was seen as a complete waste of time . 
  nowadays its not a problem , i can do whatever , but at 16-17 that was a big deal , and i 'm sure it is for many others as well . 
  `` bara is charging qop who is not near cm , qop is near the throne '', 
  i was in the game , and i believe he did n't have it yet . 
  you are right , i tested and it is the charge giving vision . 
  it 's also a word meaning a small walking path , usually in the woods . 
  well , if anyone of the 4 would die it would be pretty big , this is not that huge though . 
  \uc9d1\uc774\uc5d0\uc694 means it is a house , i 've never seen \uc9d1\uc5d0\uc608\uc694 but i 'm a noob so what do i know .
