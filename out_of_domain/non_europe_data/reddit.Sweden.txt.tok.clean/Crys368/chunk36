  [ inga problem \\ ( featuring : petter , snook \\ ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bj5woznl4ik ), 
  i just have n't found a single f ( x ) song that i like , yet every release they have is praised by what feels like everyone . 
  hangul is wonderful , but the language can be quite difficult depending on which languages one knows already . 
  as for apps , duolingo for german chineseskill for chinese . 
  check out r/languagelearning as well . 
  the best time to start was years ago , the second best time to start is today . 
  22 is still young . 
  it 's a heart . 
  some common methods of heart signs can be found here, 
  it 's not unique to asia though , in sweden we never wear shoes in our homes . 
  just a few simple ones , still learning so if im wrong please let me know !, 
  5 ) \uc11c \uc788\ub2e4 standing \uc549\uc544 \uc788\ub2e4 sitting , someone else might have to provide an explanation here though ... 
  etc, 
  14 ) x\uc5d0 \uaf2d \uac00\uc138\uc694 would be `` you should definitely go to x '', 
  \ubabb is a bit softer than \uc218 \uc5c6\ub2e4 , i think \uc218\uc5c6\ub2e4 would literally mean that there is no way for one to do something . 
  if you use \ubabb\ud558\ub2e4 for `` do poorly '' i think \uc798 \ubabb\ud558\ub2e4 is more suitable, 
  for 14 ) you could use it that way as well . 
  maybe you could say \uaf2d \uba39\uc5b4\uc57c\uc8e0 for a less commanding phrase but im not sure, 
  i also added 2 more short answers btw, 
  as in richard ? 
  i think the common way of hangulizing it would be \ub9ac\ucc98\ub4dc or maybe \ub9ac\ucc28\ub4dc , or in my case i just use \ub9ac\ud0a4 . 
  it can be a bit awkward to use \u3137 in the end like that if you want to have an english d in the end . 
  well mostly because pronounced on its own you do n't voice a final consonant , so in this case you would form a t but not actually say it . 
  you would pronounce it like ri-chaht , but it would sound like ri-chah ( or more often li-chah , unfortunately ... ) . 
  so you 'd usually use \ub4dc to get a nice and audible `` d '' sound in the end . 
  probably due to caffeine, 
  same in sweden . 
  generally hanja is traditional and kanji is mixed . 
  but chinese has sort of drifted away from some hanja/kanji and use different hanzi to say certain words . 
  for example weekdays , in korean and japanese youd say \u6708\u66dc\u65e5 for monday , and in chinese youd say \u661f\u671f\u4e00 . 
  head over to r/kpop for more !, 
  i heard that norwegian-swedish-icelandic would be the optimal order for those languages . 
  but i only speak swedish so i cant verify . 
  i 've never eaten surstr\u00f6mming and i 've lived here for all my 22 years so far ... 
  they did record a song though , so technically kpop . 
  cant quite remember where but i heard hola had some sketchy botnet things going on . 
  not sure how serious it really is but might be good to keep in mind . 
  motivation is like sailing , easy , fast and free as long as there is wind . 
  no wind and you wont get anywhere . 
  discipline is like oars , you will have to work hard , but you 'll reach the end eventually , no matter what . 
  combine the two and you 'll get there fast . 
  they 're currently on a hiatus . 
  lately it 's only their drummer ayeon doing youtube covers . 
  i got some more, 
  and a discounted one for lefties, 
  [ this music video comes to mind . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ajw4chksqm ), 
  well actually it 's `` jag blir b\u00e4ttre '' as in ' i become better ' . 
  you 're doing great !, 
  huh , i do n't think i 've ever heard `` ett apelsin '' or `` en mos '' ... maybe its a regional thing ? 
  i 've heard people say that `` paraply '' could also be both , but again , never heard `` en paraply '' . 
  it 's all good , you 're mixing \u3142\ub2c8\ub2e4 and \uc694 right now , which are different levels of speech . 
  you could say minyaden\uc774\uc5d0\uc694 or maybe \ubc18\uac11\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4 instead . 
  it 's not that imporant at this moment though , but usually if you use \u3142\ub2c8\ub2e4 with people of similar age it sounds kinda weird . 
  do you understand what i wrote ? 
  i 'm still learning as well , but if you have any questions feel free to ask !, 
  btw , check out / r/korean if you have n't already !, 
  literally means something like `` are you at peace ? 
  '' , but is used like `` hello '' . 
  it 's technically a question but you are not actually asking anything . 
  i 've seen people write with all kinds of punctuation after it , so it 's not very strict . 
  i can give a little word for word transcript so you could see a bit of the simple grammar that you 'd learn in the near future . 
  `` hello . 
  i ricky am . 
  sweden person am . 
  now university at , korean studying . 
  which country person are ? 
  why korean study ? '', 
  the twister build requires globes to provide arcane power , thus you need a group . 
  the arc orb is more well rounded , being quite tanky while also doing good dmg . 
  there is however a quite special build that uses twister in solo , on the chinese server , that has done 83 . 
  do n't have a way of linking the build right now , but here is a picture of the current top setup , i 've seen some variations with passives though . 
  the spell runes are in order :, 
  raging storm, 
  safe passage, 
  static discharge, 
  conduit, 
  crystallize, 
  exhaustion, 
  you actually spell the `` karak '' slightly different though . 
  morikarak is \uba38\ub9ac\uce74\ub77d and sonkarak is \uc190\uac00\ub77d . 
  you also have \uc813\uac00\ub77d and \uc21f\uac00\ub77d ( chopsticks , spoon ) . 
  i think it means something like `` a long slender thing '' , but a native speaker might have to clarify that . 
  i 'm also curious why \uba38\ub9ac\uce74\ub77d uses the \u314b instead of \u3131 . 
  as for the word `` hair '' , there is also \ud138 which i * think * refers more to body hair , or fur . 
  lol all my texts costs . 
  i have unlimited 4g instead . 
  i play idle , and use an autoclicker for clan fights , as there is no other way to `` idle '' those fights . 
  yuna is 163cm and hyejeong is 170cm ( they are not always honest with height though ... ), 
  it is true though , generally speaking . 
  this guy is not the average hc player . 
  this is not really a recent change , i 've used this feature for months , but yeah , it was a welcome change when it came for sure !, 
  top 4 wizards world is using the dmo twister solo build , and rank1 is at 87 . 
  the damage with solo twister is insane , but you 're quite squishy compared to the arc orb build , but if you know what you are doing the twister build seems faster . 
  well , i personally prefer android , but switching to an android phone would probably cost more than $ 25 ... 
  when people talk about languages being easier or harder they usually do n't include individual motivation in their reasoning , because it 's individual . 
  japanese might be easier for you because you are interested in japanese culture , but for someone without that interest , but likes chinese culture , mandarin might be easier . 
  there are tons of resources for all big languages . 
  what you really is saying is `` if you like culture related to a particular language , it might be easier to learn that a language you do n't care about . '', 
  but like you said , mandarin is easier than japanese , technically , and that 's what matters .
