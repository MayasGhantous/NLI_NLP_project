  you 'd have to pick a hanja you like , really . 
  a quick search tells me that the ` slave ' , ` servant ' meaning is not connected to hanja , so that should n't be a worry . 
  but it also tells me that the common name hanja for \uc885 ( \u7a2e ) means ` species ' . 
  there is also \uc885 ( \u9418 ) , which means bell , but i do n't think it 's commonly used for names . 
  i do n't think it matters though , really . 
  also , as you might know already , \uacbd\uc8fc is the name of a city in korea . 
  oh , well there you go , \u7a2e was the only one i got names as a result from , so that 's what i got it from . 
  900 people are n't many by any measure either though . 
  from personal experience , if you have a name that koreans have trouble pronouncing , they often ask if you have a korean name , and after that if you have a full korean name . 
  i do n't know how common it is , but when my korean friends started giving me a name they thought it was kinda important that the whole name had a good feel , last name and all . 
  \ubc30 would normally be the hanja \u88f4 , which does n't really have a proper meaning as far as i can tell , if anything it means the ` flowing of some sort of clothing ' but it seems to be kinda archaic . 
  it is a homonym of \ubc30 as in boat , but that would be a native korean meaning , along with pear , and stomach . 
  not really a name people would think ` ship ' when they hear . 
  i 'd say going with your real name would be the best , unless it gets horribly butchered to the point of being embarrassing or straight out unrecognizable . 
  it can be fun to have a korean name though , and the process of researching korean naming practice , with hanja and all that , can be quite interesting .

  korean is very simple to read compared to english . 
  english has so many irregularities that you often need to hear the word to know what it should sound like . 
  even simple words can be pronounced differently to mean different things . 
  this video comes to mind , at 0:55 onwards . 
  edit : this one is also relevant https://youtu.be/1edpxkqiptw, 
  certain things when reading korean are a bit tricky , but it 's mostly about learning the rules . 
  hangul fits korean phonology much better than the latin script fits english , so its only natural , really . 
  well actually i learned hangul way back , to read song lyrics , and then i was listening to korean music and reading along with the lyrics in hangul , way before i actually understood anything . 
  a while later when i started studying korean for real , i had quite a headstart in terms of reading and pronounciation compared to my classmates . 
  i 've always tried to practice as much as i can with native speakers , and through that it sort of came naturally . 
  i never really did any formal reading out loud kinda stuff . 
  as for hiphop , if it appears on show me the money it becomes popular , otherwise itll mostly be underground , unless its an act from a major label, 
  the caveman grunt though, 
  my saved on reddit is essentially a collection of irene pics/gifs, 
  no shame ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ maybe ^ a ^ little, 
  i 'd be so happy if we could get a server in japan or korea so we can use lockstep in korea . 
  when singapore ( 120 ~ ping early on a good day, 
  ) is acting up california is the best ping at about 180 ... 
  do n't have our wonderful letters on this keyboard so to avoid having this look stupid i 'll just take it in english , but this really confused me a while back , but i figured it was something like the `` f\u00e5 , f\u00e4rre , * f\u00e4rst * / minst antal '' ( copypastade lite ) kinda stuff where you would just simply use another word . 
  interesting to see that it 's supposedly technically correct to write with double t 's like that . 
  even though it looks odd and i do n't think i would use it anytime soon . . 
  btw , when googling fa farre farst to get the copypaste , i found out that apparently [ you can say * f\u00e4rst * now ] ( http://www.sahlstrom.info/sprakliga-funderingar/fa-farre-farst/ ) . 
  yeah , i 'm aware of that , but certain public computers are very limited in terms of settings , and this one allowed me to change between added languages , but not add any new ones . 
  you should n't use \ub098 and \ub108\uc758 to people you are not close friends with . 
  use \uc800 instead of \ub098 and the persons name/titel instead of \ub108 . 
  ( using \ub108 to someone who is n't your friend is way worse than \ub098 , so be careful with that one ), 
  never heard/seen that before , what does it mean exactly ? 
  i 'm swedish , and our right is further left than your left . 
  it 's all relative , so that center makes no sense . 
  not in terms of money though, 
  heck, 
  90k life would be something though huh, 
  if you did n't play any of the games before you will probably have more fun with d3 . 
  well i had no choice . 
  but my friends here in korea who are studying swedish usually say they want to live in sweden because of things like welfare , high living standard , equality for women especially in the workplace , design ( ikea and h & m ) , metal ( music ) , clean air , nature , and good looking boys ( most who study swedish here are girls ) . 
  these people are all majoring in swedish at a university in korea btw . 
  very rarely do they learn swedish with the intention of making use for it in korea , but unfortunately they usually only live in sweden as exchange students for a semester or two . 
  seoul line 1 though smh, 
  this is it boys . 
  we have peaked as a civilization . 
  usually most restaurants will have signs or notices in menus indicating where the meat is from . 
  i 'd take 18k life though that would be neat, 
  and ? 
  play hc and remake when you die, 
  ggg confirmed non-ethical dogs, 
  the teachers are usually speaking in a way that you will understand , even if you are a beginner . 
  do n't worry about that, 
  there is also \ud558\ub3c4 which is used with negative expressions of reason , such as in ' \uc74c\uc2dd\uc774 \ud558\ub3c4 \ub9e4\uc6cc\uc11c \uba39\uc744 \uc218\uac00 \uc5c6\uc5b4\uc694 ' , and \uc644\uc804 which means completely , totally , and \ub418\uac8c wich means very , extremely . 
  someone is frustraded , hehe . 
  this happens all the time in sweden , to foreigners attempting to speak swedish . 
  almost always its simply because english is more convenient . 
  if you would tell a swede that you want to practice your swedish we would probably agree to stick with swedish , but if you would for example attempt to order food or something in broken swedish you might be making things difficult for the staff , and it 's understandable if they want to keep things simple . 
  it mostly depens on when and where you try . 
  korea and japan are generally very pleasant though . 
  the korean word for nuclear souns like heck , and when the english word hack was loaned to korean , it got the same letters, 
  asking for upvotes = recieve downvotes . 
  japanese and korean are quite different from english , in terms of syntax , grammar , vocabulary , pronounciation etc. 
  also , both are popular languages with a lot of good learning material available . 
  this gon b gud, 
  one page i like is called ` spr\u00e5kf\u00f6ralla ' , its a guy who grew up with immigrant parents in sweden and makes a lot of comedy videos . 
  might be a bit hard to follow what he 's saying if you are new to swedish though , as he usually talks a lot of immigrant slang . 
  edit : for memes , ` the typical jag ' posts a lot of decently fuktiga mejmejs . 
  the fuktigaste mejmejs are over at r/sweden though, 
  time goes on as normally as ever . 
  nah dude its only that bald guy on tv . 
  everyone else is straight and normal etc. . . 
  \uc548\uc9c0\uc601 from \ubcfc\ube68\uac04\uc0ac\ucd98\uae30 has a pretty unique style . 
  are they even known in the international kpop community ? 
  you hear them all the time in seoul but i ca n't recall seeing anything about them on reddit . 
  ` the korean way ' is actually way more hype than anything done in english , ` english in korea ' is different though . 
  idioms are very common in all languages , german has tons as well, 
  its regarded as one of the more difficult languages to learn for native english speakers, 
  idk tzuyu and dahyeon are great here, 
  thanks, 
  duolingo is a nice stepping stone to language learning , but it wont really get you anywhere . 
  there are great free resources for east asian language learning available , that are much better . 
  more difficult , sure , but they also give actual results, 
  try not to be embarrassed . 
  you 'll learn from your mistakes , and no one will judge you for trying . 
  being shy and easily embarrassed is such a hindrance from getting actual useful practice . 
  be proud that you took a step out of your comfort zone . 
  korean and japanese are very similar in terms of learning . 
  korean pronounciation is slightly harder at first , and japanese kanji is also hard at first . 
  the grammar and vocab are basically equally hard throughout .
