  get someone swedish to talk to, 
  the new generation of girl groups has taken over, 
  im from sweden , and swedes might know kimchi , but probably not ( unless theyre food hipsters ) . 
  i like that korean food embraces the simplicity , keeping thimgs simple and relatively cheap but still great . 
  at \uc678\ub300 it was fine as long as my home uni was ok with it . 
  certain mountains have restrictions on photos due to military defence and stuff , so might wan na keep that in mind/look up before going , if taking pictures is the goal . 
  in a related , but backwards kinda way , most people in korea does n't care about rookie groups unless they are big3 or go viral for some reason . 
  international fans seems to know everything about every new group . 
  also , \ubcfc\ube68\uac04\uc0ac\ucd98\uae30 is basically unheard of on r/kpop but is played all the time in korea . 
  sort of how it was with busker busker . 
  ost/ballads in general are much bigger in korea than on r/kpop . 
  a lot of hip hop and semi viral edm music from korea does n't make it far overseas . 
  in that case it 's another backwards way at play . 
  it took a while for them to become popular here in korea , but they 're pretty big nowadays , and nowadays you do n't see them mentioned on r/kpop . 
  i do n't recall them getting attention here when they debuted but i 'll take your word for it, 
  also worth to note is that the artist is korean , and it shows in parts of the design , noteably the shoulderpads, 
  i 'm not new , but i also do n't dig very far down the comment sections . 
  the thing is though , here in korea they are an act rivaling big kpop groups , played everywhere all the time , and on reddit they are a group that apparently get namedropped in indie discussions . 
  it 's still one of the biggest korea and r/kpop differences . 
  it might have more to do with who said it , rather than what he said, 
  why are you bringing me into this ? 
  i simply explained what might be going on . 
  i opened this in a new tab along with a bunch of other stuff , then i forgot about it . 
  tabbed to this one and got greeted by that face in fullscreen . 
  spit my coffee everywhere . 
  ' \uc798 \uc5b4\uc6b8\ub824\uc694 ' always feels awkward to say for some reason . 
  it reminds me of speaking danish . . 
  you ca n't really isolate any health effects from a particular food like this without some huge research study , and even then , you might not notice anything . 
  eat whichever one you like . 
  the `` i f\u00e4rd med '' phrasing has a very `` written '' feel to it . 
  ca n't remember ever saying it unless i read something out loud . 
  i 'm pretty sure naver considers [ \ud68c\uc774 ] to be a ` correct ' pronunciation, 
  there are many koreans on hellotalk as well , and there is tons of material available . 
  check the sidebar in r/korean, 
  s\u00e5ng ca n't really refer to an instrumental track , other than that they 're essentially the same in regards to things like music players, 
  yea track fits decently . 
  musical piece would be a ` stycke ' , musical work would be a ` verk ' . 
  the news are only making it mainstream now , so right now we do n't know much more than this, 
  fan va fint !, 
  usually it is peaking late october-early november , so you should be fine, 
  woke up with 146 notifications ... 
  just curious , what exactly do you consider ` european ' pronunciation to be ? 
  british ? 
  equipment matters , but its not the * only * thing that matters . 
  sure , i 'm swedish myself , so i 'm well aware of that . 
  i just feel that saying `` european pronunciation '' is strange , considering how many different languages there are in europe . 
  miracle is pretty good at this game huh, 
  pretty sure it has to be a legit completion, 
  i hope you 're not my friend, 
  got ta get those fuktiga mejmejs, 
  at times it sounded like odpixel, 
  most basic advice that usually works well enough is that \u3157 has rounded lips and \u3153 does n't . 
  poe and d3 are both mmos , technically . 
  not open world mmo , but mmos nonetheless . 
  \ud5e4\uc774\uc990 would be a decently ` korean ' way to romanize it , but because of z -  \u3148 it might not be that great for you . 
  its up to you to decide , really, 
  bibimbap usually has stir fry-ish vegetables , right ? 
  koreans will often place their bags/phones on tables while they go off to order things . 
  in most of western europe thats basically equal to giving your belongings away . 
  its the sad reality we live in . 
  i 'm a stockholm native , and a prime offender of the * stockholm ` i ' * . 
  for your own sake , avoid learning it . 
  other swedes laugh at us , and we usually do n't notice the difference at all . 
  this varies between countries though . 
  just something to keep in mind . 
  stay strong , religion is a big part of ones life , and you will miss out on many things by leaving . 
  being honest to others and yourself is worth it in the end though . 
  people lose their stuff all the time in stockholm as well , but outside of the big cities , its pretty safe , youre right, 
  yeah , dubstep in gaming events always feels a bit fellowkids to me . 
  this was a huge upgrade, 
  they 're all proud fathers , evidently, 
  a couple of my korean friends have done it as well , it 's fairly common to change names due to superstition in korea . 
  this gif is top 5 all time on that sub as well , so it all checks out . 
  there is an offbrand duolingo style app for chinese called * chinese skill * , you could give it a try, 
  ironic , sure , but liking and defending everything a country does because you enjoy certain things from that country is pretty stupid as well . 
  ( not saying they 're reasonable , but just to be fair . ), 
  the us is a country that manages to be both 1st world and 3rd world at the same time . 
  no0ne is great dude, 
  i play sc because i want to do maps drunk without waking up in standard the next morning . 
  agree 100 % . 
  it 's a pretty hard language to learn if you come from a germanic language background , but with the culture and all it 's so easy to get hooked . 
  i originally planned to take 1 semester at uni just for fun , and now i 've studied full time for 3 years , and just about to wrap up my 1 year exchange in seoul . 
  doesnt tao do something similar in some exo song ? 
  oh , i was actually thinking about the end of [ overdose ] ( https://youtu.be/ti0dgvqkzti?t=3m59s ) , but that works too . 
  to be fair , i think i 'd be flying around a lot as well if i could, 
  i 'm at \uc678\ub300 , or internationally hufs . 
  it 's a pretty small university , but the focus is on foreign languages , so it 's a lot of language exchanges going on . 
  it 's the only uni that teaches swedish as well , which makes it extra fun for me . 
  as for food , the better places are around \uacbd\ud76c\ub300 , the big brother uni right next to us . 
  it 's especially known for \ud30c\uc804 , there is a street which specializes in it ( you could naver \ud68c\uae30 \ud30c\uc804 \uace8\ubaa9 for blogs and stuff ) , but kinda ironically the best \ud30c\uc804 i know is instead at a tiny little place right in front of \uc678\ub300 , called \ub2e4\uc0b0\ucd08\ub2f9 . 
  it has a cozy traditional feel to it , and the dude who works there makes amazing \ud574\ubb3c\ud30c\uc804 . 
  might not be worth traveling far to get it , but if you 're ever in the area i 'd recommend it . 
  there is the grenade ue build as well , which ended up being the strongest build for dh solo gr . 
  it 's functional with less but scales a bit differently . 
  i do n't have any personal experience with other programs in seoul , but from speaking with friends at other schools it seems like \uc678\ub300 has one of the better language programs . 
  i 'm not sure what kinda lesson plan the summer session will use though , i 've only been in the regular intensive language course . 
  there is a decent amount of speaking practice in class , which is really useful if you do n't have a lot of native friends to practice with . 
  ( if you do however , real conversations will be way better . ), 
  i 've heard that many in the lower levels struggle a bit with keeping up though , so you ca n't slack off too much . 
  other language programs tend to be very heavy on writing , which is n't nessecarily the best approach to language learning imo .
