  currently ranked # 2 on [ miom summer 2017 ranking ] ( http://wiki.teamliquid.net/smash/ssbmrank#2017_summer ), 
  that ending though, 
  this happens normally in the campaign . 
  take the last waypoint and work your way back .

  reading posts like this makes me so happy that i grew up in a country with so little religious presence ... 
  come on over !, 
  it 's great , 
  i used to be like this as well . 
  when i was younger , around high school years , i studied spanish , italian , japanese , german , chinese and korean . 
  just low level basic stuff , but it * felt * like i knew tons . 
  as soon as i realized how far off i was from actually being able to use any of my `` 3rd languages '' compared to my 2nd language english , i decided to just focus on one language , and korean was the one . 
  it 's just sooo much more satisfying to actually be able to hold a conversation in a language than just figuring out a written sentence . 
  whenever i feel like ` perhaps i should give french a try ' i think about how long it takes to learn a language , and how much more satisfaction i will get from spending those hours on my korean . 
  at this point i want to reach that breakpoint where i can comfortable use korean without thinking . 
  whenever that happens i can learn entirely by using , instead of studying , and then i will have the time to perhaps attempt another language . 
  who knows how long that will take , but i still enjoy learning korean , so i 'm in no rush . 
  hey that 's dean, 
  online competitive team pvp game = toxic . 
  buff everything, 
  he 's handsome and some pros posted pictures they took with him on twitter and then it snowballed and now it 's a meme . 
  do what you want, 
  they used bloodseeker 5 games out of 8 until grand finals . 
  played it all three games in winners finals . 
  makes sense to keep trying , it worked great up until the gf . 
  july and august tend to be quite rainy, 
  they only picked bs the first game ... 
  mistake, 
  https dude, 
  etc, 
  the dish used to be called seonnongtang ( \uc120\ub18d\ud0d5 ) ages ago but has gone through some spelling and pronunciation changes . 
  nowadays it 's called seolleongtang ( \uc124\ub801\ud0d5 ) . 
  seolnongtang ( \uc124\ub18d\ud0d5 ) seems to be a restourant name indeed . 
  basically dialects of ` scandinavian ' . 
  learn norwegian if you want . 
  swedes will understand you and you will understand us . 
  theres no one answer to it . 
  culture is complicated . 
  because \uc721 is special . 
  iirc , coming from chinese ` liu ' it used to be ' \ub959 ' but since ( south ) korean doesnt use \u3139 in the start of words anymore ( unless loan words like \ub77c\ub514\uc624 , \ub77c\uba74etc ) it is spelled \uc721 but sometimes becomes \ub959 or \ub275 . 
  rap is no longer limited to black americans from the ghetto , you got people from all over the world from all kinds of social situations getting involved . 
  its become a mainstream thing and this is only a natural consequence of that . 
  like it or not , its here to stay . 
  if you want to skip the translation phase you should learn it from neither language , rather than both . 
  this can be really hard if you are self studying though , depending on the material available . 
  if you have a practice partner/teacher that can help you , try to ge them to explain grammar/vocab/phrases etc using the target language rather than english or whatever . 
  the first couple months might need some input from another language , but once you get going you should be able to drop the translation phase completely . 
  spectral throw and blade flurry sounds like shit though . 
  have to turn of sounds when playing those skills, 
  a good mechanical keyboard . 
  or anything you invest a lot of time in really . 
  r/korea is for general korea related stuff , but most people are american english teachers . 
  r/hanguk is general korea related stuff but in korean . 
  not very active though . 
  edit : smartphone being dumb, 
  great post but in yellow, 
  not at all pcbangs , i 've been to a few that even blocks steam from starting . 
  quite similar to the japanese war flag , a flag you should be a bit cautious with . 
  cool idea though !, 
  i was really close to switching during ti ... stay strong brothers, 
  i keep seeing this , people thinking its ironic that its blocked in the country it came from . 
  that 's exactly the reason why it is blocked . 
  its monetized in korea from whatever source it comes from so it cant be on youtube for free . 
  in other countries you can only see it on youtube so its not blocked . 
  that `` probably '' might be the reason why . 
  they 're not gon na let you watch something for free if they could be making money on it if/when they decide to . 
  broadcasting rights and stuff, 
  its a simple risk reward thing . 
  im for this change rather than making rifts bland by nerfing dangerous stuff, 
  [ spinach ] ( https://www.google.se/search?q=sigeumchi+namul&amp;rlz=1c1ggrv_svse759se759&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewis7vzbx_rvahwkzpokhwbedzoq_auicigb&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=958 ) is fairly common in korea . 
  iirc we are the most vegetarian country after india . 
  when i was in highschool it felt like half of my friends were vegetarians, 
  keep in mind that even from the closest drive spot it takes a while to get to the top . 
  no idea , honestly never seen them in sweden . 
  what are they called in english ? 
  one piece is huge in korea . 
  by far the biggest manga/anime . 
  i disagree , hall\u00e5 is perfectly fine to use when saying hello . 
  ( especially on the phone , where it is basically the standard phrase ) variations like hall\u00e5 i stugan , hall\u00e5hall\u00e5 , hall\u00e5j etc are also fairly common . 
  disclaimer : might be a regional thing . 
  apart from answering with only your name i ca n't recall hearing anything else than hall\u00e5 to be honest . 
  it 's not negative , but it is often used to get attention or sometimes when you are surprised . 
  it is not * as * neutral as hej , but it definitely does n't have to be negative . 
  a hall\u00e5 variation to rule them all, 
  is this in the us ? 
  what about international shipping ? 
  there are quite a few euros ( and other continents ) here as well . 
  processed cheese in ramyeon is very common in korea . 
  my friends that like cheese all do it , my local pcbang has it as an option for all soup ramyeon available , and all ( non japanese ) ramyeon places ive been to has the option as well . 
  in addition , you can also say `` vad h\u00e4nder ? '', 
  to which the logical answer is `` f\u00f6tter '' . 
  i would say that languages do click ( xhosa hehe ) but there are certain thresholds that can be quite hard to reach, 
  hard and soft vowels . 
  aou\u00e5 , eiy\u00e4\u00f6 ( loan words are often exceptions ; keso , kebab , * kex * are all with hard k 's despite the soft vowel . ), 
  technically it 's wrong grammar rather than spelling . 
  `` hanom '' would be a spelling issue . 
  han and honom are different grammatical forms of the same word , but both are spelled correctly . 
  some dude posting his clickbait csgo videos anywhere he can to get more views , downvote and move on, 
  you 're never going to find a bug free private server . 
  even retail has bugs .
