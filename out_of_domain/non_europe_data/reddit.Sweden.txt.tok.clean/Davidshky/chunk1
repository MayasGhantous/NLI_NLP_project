that part was easy and fun as hell , only failed once . 
  also , if you have trouble , make a big pile of magnuson devices at the last teleporter , then use them to kill both hunters and striders , the guys with rocket launchers also help . 
  not the same was as with the striders , but the devices are apparently pretty heavy or something so a few of those to the face of a hunter and it 's dead . 
  since the teleporter spawn them slower than you can throw them i just made a huge pile of 20-30 devices at the last teleporter and spammed them at any hunter i saw . 
  she dies if you do n't give her an escort or if the escort is n't loyal . 
  ca n't come up with one , but most of the songs on the divernie album by ludovico einaudi , heron blue by sun kil moon and otherside by rhcp . 
  i think alyx and barney would like to know about this . 
  `` no it would n't . '', 
  - george carlin, 
  iirc they say in me2 that the haestrom sun is acting the way it does because of dark energy . 
  ty ! , i knew i had seen it somewhere irl . 
  `` decoy , combat drone , sentry turret , and geth turret powers, 
  decreased the maximum number of enemies that will target them at the same time . '', 
  as if millions of engineers suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced . 
  i specced turret for healing , hunter mode for weapon bonuses , overload for some chaining but also the 100 % bonus to shields and barriers . 
  do n't remember what i put in networked ai and fitness . 
  i use the avenger with extended barrel and piercing mod due to it 's weight and lack of drawbacks . 
  sometimes i carry the geth smg with ulm as a backup gun but it 's usually not needed . 
  could i get `` falling outside the normal moral constraints '' ? 
  when it comes to weapons for the geth engineer i actually really like the avenger . 
  it 's light so you can spam overload more often but it 's also a very good weapon , even more if you spec huntermode for gun bonuses . 
  damn nature , you scary . 
  agreed . 
  i also think that you should get points when someone fires at something you have weakened with cryo blast , justicar bubble etc , so if they normally would have done 100 damage and they now do 125 damage the extra 25 damage should count as your points . 
  the new dialogue will just be every major character saying `` congratulations '' . 
  if you played firebase white , geth , gold and failed it probably was n't just you since a competent team can do it quite easily ( though slowly ) with just 3 players . 
  only things i can think of people doing in fbw/g/g that really causes trouble is if they try to camp outside at the l chaped cover . 
  if they get overrun they can make enemies come in through the backdoor , flanking and making it very uncomfortable for anyone inside . 
  also , try to team up your justicar with an asari adept or human sentinel and focus on causing biotic explosions . 
  try searching for fbw/geth matches in the future if the goal is to extract . 
  when it comes to the salarian infiltrator i would say you can use it with the widow or mantis . 
  mantis would actually be preferable if you have it at a high level since it will do almost as much damage but having a lower weight and thus allowing you to spam more energy drain . 
  i take it you all got overrun and murdered ? 
  the main issue with camping out there is that you can and will get flanked by enemies coming out through the rear door of the computer room and that you have nowhere to fall back to . 
  if you stay in the computer room all enemies will come from the stairs or the right door and you could possible retreat to the outside . 
  considering how my latest gold matches have been , i would take a team of me + two drunk players rather than the morons i 've played with . 
  add me as well . 
  origins : davidshky, 
  krogan infilmanguard, 
  tactical cloak , barrier/nova , biotic charge . 
  sneak into the enemies and detonate barrier or nova and then follow up with charge or melee . 
  oh yeah , people do it all the time . 
  pisses me off to no end and i wish i could report them or something . 
  geth infiltrator with the kishock harpoon gun . 
  by combining the proximity mine with a fully charge and cloakbonuses shot i can instakill most enemies even on gold and it 's just silly on silver . 
  enemies get hit and fly around in the air . 
  once i somehow nailed a phantom in the roof by shooting her in the foot . 
  any of the batarians . 
  i have unlocked patterns on both the geths and the justicar but i still do n't have any of the batarians . 
  woohoo , i did n't miss it this time . 
  so could i get `` falling outside the normal moral constraints . '', 
  not completely untrue so i 'll take it . 
  like this ? 
  i do n't think the cloaking bonus will apply in the same way it doesnt apply if you fire a charged shot from the gps/kishock/graal if you charged it before you cloaked . 
  from the in-game description . 
  deploy a multifunctional turret that deals heavy damage and repairs the shields of allies within ** 8 meters ** every 8 seconds . 
  then be the host . 
  also the falcon is best used with some ammo power like cryo ammo or disruptor ammo to cause tech bursts . 
  i think you 're thinking about a different ai . 
  ca n't decide between geth , asari and volus . 
  i 've loved how the geth look and sound since me1 , but then the asari is a race of blue pansexual hotties and lastly the volus just look so damn funny . 
  a warhammer 40k movie with lots and lots of imperial guardsmen . 
  any of these would be nice . 
  `` just another victim of the ambient morality '', 
  `` all through with this niceness and negotiation stuff '', 
  `` you may not be the coolest person here '', 
  `` another fine product from the nonsense factory '', 
  i disagree about them being the only viable weapons . 
  in fact pretty much all weapons are viable with a few exceptions like the arc pistol . 
  i 've even found the incisor to be a good gun in the hands of a geth infiltrator as long as i can manage the recoil . 
  just add the piercing mod or armor piercing ammo and you 're good to go . 
  i once had an atlas bug on top of the bunker in hydra shooting down at us as we were trying to extract . 
  though it was easily fixed with a missile . 
  i kinda like it but i 've actually wanted weapons like the firestorm and geth spitfire to be normal but very heavy weapons with maybe an additional drawback like not being able to carry a second weapon and still having a 200 % penalty . 
  i would love walking around with a minigun as a krogan sentinel or a turian soldier and just destroy everything in sight . 
  well the darkstar would be a bit too op and also too similar to the missile launcher . 
  but the arc projector and collector particle beam would also work as normal heavy weapons . 
  i remember reading/hearing about it somewhere . 
  something about their eyes being on the side of the head like prey animals compared to turians who have them on the front like predators . 
  also that they were low on the tuchanka food chain until they got technology . 
  yes , if you have over 100 % stability bonus , like a turian using an assault rifle with a stability mod will result in downwards recoil . 
  it 's not that bad . 
  after getting it to lvl 9 i decided to try it out with the geth infiltrator , with the piercing mod and extended barrel it turned out to be a beast as long as i could manage the recoil and had access to ammo . 
  with the high rof , fast reload and penetration i could dispatch groups of enemies much faster than i could with the black widow while still being pretty effective at taking out bigger enemies . 
  your misspelling of lift grenade made me very confused . 
  though we were getting some sort of healing grenade . 
  soldier really need some better bonus towards weapons . 
  maybe giving adrenalin rush and marksman minimum and maximum recharge times so a soldier with heavy weapons still can use them quite frequently . 
  i think we 've all done this . 
   the nutter, 
  plays as krogan , celebrates each completed wave with several headbutts . 
  overjoyed to see other krogans on the team , as he 'll try ( and usually succeed ) in getting them to join in the headbutting between rounds . 
  bonus points if there is a single team member of another race , standing by puzzled and lonely as three krogan merrily headbutt each other . 
  ** geth soldier **, 
  huntermode . 
  the ultimate fullauto glasscannon . 
  the grenade works by having a small aoe ( for a grenade ) but then chaining around several times from each enemy caught in the initial aoe to hit additional enemies . 
  ** biotic god **, 
  reave . 
  shockwave .
