  a swedish military draft on the other hand is a different thing . 
  then it would depend on who we 're fighting and if we 're attacking or defending . 
  if we 're attacking i would dodge it mostly because i do n't believe we should invade any country at all . 
  but let 's say denmark or finland invaded us , i guess i would join . 
  but if for example russia declare war on us i 'm pretty sure i will have left the country a week or more before . 
  since the driver was able to speak and scream , him being gordon freeman is impossible . 
  we should be able to upgrade scouts to some new units over time . 
  something like scout  explorer  commando . 
  explorer could be a scout with +1 movement , +1 sight and +1 embark movement radius or something like that . 
  then the commando could be something very different , like a pillage/stealth oriented unit . 
  maybe the ability to move undetected as long as they stay x tiles away from enemy units and cities and do n't pillage . 
  useful for scouting ahead of your army and pillaging stuff in the late game . 
  you should post this in / r/ladyladyboners, 
  reminds me of [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/sym89/mom_sent_me_4_justin_bieber_tshirts_while/ ), 
  see if your wife ca n't get something like that for christmas . 
   a quiver for crossbow bolts . 
  with a more useful crossbow we can finally fulfill our fantasies of being daryl from walking dead . 
  [ \u0ca0 _________________________________________ \u0ca0 ] ( http://ciahome.net/forum/index.php?topic=2477.0 ), 
  not much of a feature but i would love it if you added the an-2 to the game . 
  with a chance to spawn at balota , ne airstrip and large fields . 
  more islands and boats around the coast . 
  it would give the slow boats some actual use and the pbx would become highly sought after if there is good loot on the islands . 
  my guess is that he ran/got a ride up to a camp were they have an infinite number of duped guns . 
  i 'd rather just wait for the next version that should come `` soon '' . 
  1.7.2.5 is almost unplayable with even more artifacts and with vehicles and tents not workning properly the whole looting and survival aspect is pretty much completely lost . 
  this made me think of all the loyal fans who have died during all these years and will never play hl3 . 
  maybe we should have a moment of silence for them when hl3 is finally released . 
  is that nicolas cage in the right end of the middle row ? 
  oh yes . 
  especially if you can fire from the side seat . 
  i would also love it if they added the an-2 biplane since it 's already in operation arrowhead and should be really easy to put in the game . 
  after looking at invasion 1944 i now want a ww2 dayz mashup . 
  imagine no night vision , gps , rangefinders and thermal scopes . 
  most people only having normal rifles , automatic weapons would be rare and the `` big '' guns would be stuff like stg44 , mg42 and bar rather than as50s and l85s . 
  exloration . 
  two or more new unit types . 
  explorer . 
  upgraded scout , 2 + embarkedmovement speed , 1 + movement and sight . 
  possibly an ability to create some money everytime an explorer finds a new type of luxury resource . 
  commando . 
  lategame scout unit . 
  can move undetected unless within x tiles from a unit/city upon which only that civ can see the commando . 
  can pillage improvements without movement cost . 
  `` uppsala would be killed rather easily '', 
  what does the death of a city have to do with anything ? 
  [ anne elephant ] ( http://grooveshark.com/#!/s/anne+elephant/4i1gmd?src=5 ) by someone still loves you boris yeltsin . 
  have they fixed the demoman mvm bug yet were you lose all your shield upgrades if you lose a wave or change class ? 
  rather , this is how hl3 will end . 
  the combines defeated and all is well in the world . 
  gordon is enjoying his early retirement and suddenly ... 
  roll credits . 
  when are you guys gon na start the next world war ? 
  as a swede it would be nice to know in advance so we have time to prepare our neutrality . 
  what do you mean went downhill after ct ? 
  it was the last game in the series . 
  though i would really love it if they made a fourth splinter cell game . 
  i 'd rather not remember him at all . 
  ever . 
  my guess would be , in the camp . 
  reminds me of when i got about 100 mamlukes as garrison when i was revarded a city and a castle . 
  i wiped out entire armies with maybe 1-2 dead and a few wounded ( with 100 % damage ) . 
  oh the joys of a good surgeon . 
  because the dmr is much better than the m24 . 
  only advantage the m24 has in the zeroing and once you get used to the dmr that advantage is pretty pointless . 
  well , you 'll use less backpack space with the dmr since you can keep all your ammo as dmr mags while you need to have one as 4x m24 clips with the m24 taking up 3 extra inventory spaces . 
  not only can they embark from the start , their `` coast only '' boats seem to be able to cross the ocean as well . 
  i do n't really see why not as long as it is realistic . 
  reduced accuracy , no ironsight , double ammo consumption . 
   i had the same reaction when i first encountered you talking apes . 
  ftfy, 
  akm bulles in fal mags ? 
  really ? 
  converting dmr , fal and m240 mags between each other wold have been reasonable since it 's all 7,62 x51mm nato rounds but the akm rounds are kinda different . 
  [ here ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ab/rifle_cartridge_comparison.jpg ) is a comparison between a few cartridges , the .308 winchester = 7.62 x51mm nato and the one to its right is the akm ammo . 
  and pretty useless except for killing zombiesn at close range and maybe surpressing fire . 
  no problem . 
  and i agree with you about converting dmr mags and fal mags between each other . 
  possibly the ability to make 5 mags out of a m240 mag since the gun itself is extremely rare while the ammo is not . 
  i 'm pretty sure hl3 will be announced in some arg . 
  or maybe not announced at all and simply released on steam without any warning . 
  except that it would probably only take a few minutes before someone notice it 's in the store , a few more minutes until the entire gaming community finds out and maybe an hour before the news stories about gamers running around shouting gibberish . 
  and what exatly did you think greenlight was for ? 
  any mi-17 civlian in takistan ? 
  i would really love to see that helicopter in chernarus . 
  either as a new addition or as a replacement for the huey since it would fit in better in a post soviet state than an old american helicopter . 
  if you do n't , get the +1 faith from tundra and chop down the forests . 
  then get the `` buy soldiers with faith '' belief and conquer the world . 
  well that 's not surprising since i 'm preeeeeeeeeeeeeetty sure that 's a polder . 
  i know it 's a tulip field near amsterdam but i would assume it 's in a polder . 
  oh yes . 
  i 've suggested adding the an-2 as well but i would also like to see the mi-17 more than the huey . 
  mostly because i think a game in some russian place should contain more russian things and it should take almost no effort to replace the huey with the mi-17 civ . 
  another example of a lack of russian stuff are the machineguns , we have the m249s , m240s and mk48s but no pkms or rpks , m9 sd but no makarov sd and m16s and m4s with grenade launcher but not a single ak with a gp25 . 
  well since the new sam neither looks like sam or act like sam i do n't think they 're gon na bother having him sound like sam . 
  just pretend sam fisher is a code name that agents inherit when the previous agent die/retire . 
  it sure looks that way, 
  i guess i wo n't be seeing chernarus in a while . 
  we all started out playing it as a pure survival game , running from zombies , searching for loot , avoiding players as much as possible . 
  but after a while , things got too easy . 
  we had collected a respectable amount of vehicles and loot and had no reason to scavange anything other than crash sites and possibly the barracks .
