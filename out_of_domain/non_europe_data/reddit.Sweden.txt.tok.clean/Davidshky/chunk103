  the french has a shitty little mortar car with 17 ( !!! ), 
  rpm that 's pretty effective at creating smoke so it could be worth it to replace one aa with that thing . 
  and replace that logi helicopter with something cheaper . 
  reminds me of one game of 10v10 asgard where one ally had like 40-50 tanks in a blob ( preparing for the final push ) and got the whole damn thing destroyed in one giant artillery strike . 
  you somehow manage to look both ridiculous and awesome at the same time . 
  also , you really need a shield ( like an old-school shield , not a force field ) . 
  i made a scandinavian deck that used wave after wave of reservists to keep the reds away while the bkans hammered down on them . 
  afaik that 's pretty close to our real cold war doctrine . 
   for armor , anything good , especially physical augmentation ones . 
  what about the 8472 counter command armor ? 
  with its 30 % bonus to physical damage it looks like the best armor so far . 
  and the 2p set bonus has a +5 % crth bonus . 
  so maybe 8472 cc armor and kit + the shattering harmonics crystalline sword and shield . 
   you 'd also lose a knockback weapon if you go for the 2 part bonus . 
  how so ? 
  i would get the knockback bonus from the shattering harmonics 2p set bonus and i would have a spare weapon slot for a pulsewave or similar if that 's what you mean . 
   i was saying if you went for 2 part counter command, 
  the counter command set has a kit so if i use that and the armor i would get the 2p bonus and have a free weapon slot . 
   not sure there is an equivalent in most other militaries . 
  do n't think there is . 
  the wiesel is an `` armored weapon carrier '' so it 's basically just small lightly armored platform made to transport a big gun ( or other heavy equipment ) . 
  most countries just use an apc/ifv chassis or something similar . 
  i guess some of the heavier [ ugvs ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/unmanned_ground_vehicle ) could be seen as a more modern equivalent of the wiesel . 
  actually , an unmanned wiesel could be pretty interesting . 
  tiny little glass-cannons with no self-preservation . 
  i 'm hoping for a kdf raptor 3-pack . 
  for some reason there 's no t5 c-store raptor , only standard , mirror and fleet raptors . 
  a romulan carrier would also be nice ( especially if it could use the scimitars drone-ships ) . 
  they have also been talking about improving the small-craft content for a while so maybe kdf could finally get some new fighters and shuttles . 
  like orion interceptor fighter , marauder runabout etc etc. 
  first of all , use all your activation points :p, 
  secondly , if you 're new i think you should probably avoid using decks that are too specific . 
  maybe make a commonwealth deck instead . 
  you 'll have access to all the anzac units + the uk and canadian units . 
  when it comes to logistics , you probably wont need that many command units so remove the rover cp or tac hq . 
  you should probably also replace one supply unit with an fob . 
  imo one of the best things about supply helicopters is how easily they can fly back and resupply at a fob . 
  also , anzac should have access to the rbs 70 that should be much better than the redeye . 
  otherwise i 'm not really sure . 
  not at home so i ca n't really check what 's available for an anzac airborne deck . 
  coward tactics !, 
  get a team armed with swords and you 'll cut through the borg so fast they wont even have time to assimilate you . 
  edit : i 'm actually serious . 
  5 players with swords ( not bat ` leths/lirpas ) and the right kit powers is imo the best way to kill borgs in most ground stfs . 
  high dps , 80 % shield penetration and no adaptation . 
  well the upcoming dlc is about updating the smaller east-bloc factions ( and the next one about scandinavia ) so do n't get your hopes up for us stuff . 
  the first ones were delivered 2012 . 
  you better change it to `` strv 2000 for sweden pls '' when it 's time for the scandinavian dlc , mkay .

  unless you 're a scientist since then you can just spam-heal yourself to glory . 
   what is the next dlc for red dragon ? 
  the east-bloc faction update, 
   what are the maps & units . 
  no one knows except an e-german tunguska , a polish and czech mig-29 and some sort of anti-ship vehicle . 
   what it 's purpose ? 
  to update the minor east-bloc factions to 1991 . 
  first of all i would remove one supply truck and maybe replace another with a supply helicopter . 
  possibly replace the cv car with command infantry or something with some armor . 
  when it comes to infantry , maybe put the rbs 90s in strf 9040s . 
  imo they 're worth the extra 10 points over the pbv 302a , especially for infantry that already have low availability and highish cost . 
  i would probably replace either the noah or hawk with a veak 40 spaag . 
  maybe remove one leopard 1a1no . 
  mid-tier tanks are n't that useful atm . 
  replace or remove one of your recon infantry in trucks . 
  at least personally i have never needed that much recon infantry . 
  maybe replace one of your planes with the cluster-bomb viggen . 
  unless the danish f-16 has cluster bombs . 
  you should probably have some spare activation points now so get some more vehicles ( you 're mechanized after all ) , like the danish thing with an auto cannon . 
  [ h\u00e4r finns n\u00e5gra exempel p\u00e5 wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/political_spectrum#other_proposed_dimensions ), 
  indeed . 
  they 're simply named after the manufacturers `` design bureau prefix '' + a number . 
  well when it comes to arty , i think it means `` when you have enough arty to kill your target before the player can react '' or something like that . 
  5 howitzers are more than 5 times as powerful as one , simply because the targets wo n't have time to escape . 
  ** generic changes wrote : **, 
  - new audio option `` ambiance volume '' that controls the `` background operator voices '' volume ( yet to be translated ) . 
  - minimum time for infantry units to exit a building increased from 3 to 6 seconds ( this addresses the exploit known as `` bunny hoping '' ) . 
  - reducing the chances of critics by 50 % for all ground vehicles when driving through forests, 
  - adding an explanation in the combat debriefing in campaign displayed when the combat ends because no units are able to shoot the enemies ( tank vs helicopters for instance ), 
  - new icon for south korea 's km132 to better represent its flamethrower role, 
  ** bug fixes wrote : **, 
  - increasing eryx 's minimal range .
