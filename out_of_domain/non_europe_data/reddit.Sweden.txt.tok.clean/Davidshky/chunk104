  they were able to shoot on their own position and crash the game . 
  - fixing a maze in japan map preview that was not displaying the starting zones colors, 
  keck graduate institute of applied life sciences, 
  indeed . 
  for example i used [ this fit ] ( http://eve.battleclinic.com/killboard/killmail.php?id=14381372 ) just so it would make a pretty lossmail as `` eternal '' proof that i once pvpd with a hulltank . 
   once you 've earned the corvette or the luxury cruiser , the risians will give you a significant discount if you want to pick up another one !, 
  ( any character on your account will get this discount once you 've unlocked it . ), 
  as someone with waaaaaaay to many characters this is the best thing ever . 
  yeah , but they got new equipment in the early 90s . 
   there is no ` the best deck ' . 
  yeah , but there are shitty decks and i think the point of this is to give people some `` approved '' decks they can use while they 're still figuring out how to make their own . 
  finally we got [ the best izana face ] ( http://i.imgur.com/45rw5pm.png ) !, 
  i actually made an a2b risian corvette with beam arrays for shits and giggles . 
  basically i just took the stuff i had on my fleet assault cruiser and put it on the corvette . 
  it was extremely fun ( oh god that speed ) but i would n't really recommend it except for bored players who like me already have the necessary equipment . 
  that was another maquis ship . 
  the maquis raider was slight bigger, 
   i 'm wondering what xl rage torps would be good for . 
  killing the new super-titans, 
  well li jian 90s ca n't really do much vs anything with armor . 
  get a decent ifv or fire-support vehicle and they 're screwed . 
  edit : also , iirc their launcher does n't work in cqc so if you fight them in a city , get in the same building-zone as them . 
  maybe something for the next anniversary . 
  a bunch of ships with some old models and textures . 
  ifvs , fire-support-vehicles or cheap tanks with some infantry support should work . 
  something in the 10-30 point range , with enough armor to take a few thermobaric rockets and enough firepower to kill stuff . 
  the centurion avre should be pretty effective . 
   ags-ifv, 
  i know what an ifv is but what does ags stand for ? 
  we need thermobaric weapons for everything . 
  imagine an mi-24 with thermobaric rocket-pods . 
  well that explains why i could n't figure out the acronym , it 's in russian . 
   canadian shield, 
  why not just make a regular deck ? 
  i do n't really see the advantage of having a support deck with that build . 
  so switch to regular , get rid of one command unit and one supply truck . 
  replace the blowpipes and canadian rifles with canadian rifles 85 . 
  get some recce . 
  recce is one of canadas best units . 
   nuclear winter, 
  get rid of the era restriction . 
  imo it 's not worth 10 more points . 
  get rid of the cv jeep and maybe replace the mtp-lb with a supply helo . 
  replace the manpad and atgm infantry with some better versions . 
  also consider putting them in the skrezhet ( spelling ? ), 
  transport . 
  this way you 'll get a cheap spaag for no extra activation point cost . 
  the sapery have access to a transport ( btr-t ? ), 
  with thick armor and grenade launchers . 
  it 's really powerful vs infantry and light vehicles . 
  get 3 cards of motostrelki 90 , put one or two of them in the bmp-1d . 
  vdv 90 and gornostrelki 90 can be pretty useful as short/mid range at infantry . 
  if possible , get better artillery . 
  get a better spaag . 
  possibly only one card if you also have skrezhet transports and afghansky vehicles . 
  get rid of most of the tanks . 
  replace one recon vehicle with recon infantry in a helicopter . 
  get a zhalo and to-55 . 
  if you have any spare activation points , get some more planes . 
  apparently enough ap4 hits from point blank will kill just about anything , the dude was so pissed off . 
  well the cv90 has the [ ke ] tag which apparently means that for every 350 meters closer than max range it gains 1 ap . 
  [ source ] ( http://wargame-series.wikia.com/wiki/damage ), 
  at literal point blank range this would be 1925/350 = 5,5 extra ap, 
  also `` at below 350m , any ap weapons will do 1 damage on its target . '', 
  the damage formula in wargame is `` damage =[ ( ap - av ) / 2 ] + 1 '', 
  so at short range the cv90 can get 9 ap, 
  the [ t-72bu ] ( http://wargame-series.wikia.com/wiki/t-72bu ) has a rear armor of 5 . 
  so be afraid of [ ke ] weapons . 
  there should be some sort of reminder that your clone is outdated . 
  like when you die , the clone window opens automatically and if you try to undock with an outdated clone , the game will tell you . 
  i remember flying around in it territory in a stealthbomber only to realize i had n't updated my clone . 
  do n't think i 've ever been as paranoid as i was during that trip to npc space . 
  delta quadrant stuff has been on [ this page ] ( http://sto.gamepedia.com/upcoming_content#expansion_ii_.28late_2014.29 ) for a while . 
  looks like they 've removed the stuff about talaxians and kazons being added as playable races though ... 
  well apparently that 's not enough . 
  and i ca n't really imagine why someone would n't want to update their clone so i do n't think many players would be annoyed by the reminder ( ofc it should also be possible to turn it off ), 
  does it really matter ? 
  just put a universal console in there and pretend it 's a science console slot instead . 
  i would try to get one card of atgm infantry . 
  at least for me , atgm infantry is more or less a must-have . 
  i would also replace one pongae-3 with a radar-sam . 
  the north-koreans have a shitty ifv with 4x aa missiles that could be worth consideration if you want some extra aa capabilities ( they 're hilarious in large numbers btw ) . 
  3 cards of fire-support-spaags might be a bit too much . 
   ditch the spaags . 
  not all of them . 
  one aa spaag is always good to have and one card of fire-support-spaags can be really really useful vs infantry . 
  you lossmail will look better with a hull-tank . 
  well since crew is basically useless we might as well ignore that bonus . 
  then the only difference is the durability , agility and the lt boff slot . 
  personally i would either stick with the farvr or get something that 's `` more different '' like maybe the [ fleet reconnaissance science vessel ] ( http://sto.gamepedia.com/fleet_reconnaissance_science_vessel ) or a [ vesta ] ( http://sto.gamepedia.com/multi-mission_reconnaissance_explorer ), 
  i wish we could pay them to fight for us . 
  get high enough standing and gain the ability to hire npc mercs for lp and isk . 
  could have done what i did last summer . 
  get keys , transfer character to tribble , give keys to another character , transfer character again , rince and repeat, 
  and this year you can just transfer lobi crystals and since he coul\u00f6d have gotten like 200 for free it would n't take that many transfers . 
  just checked , airborne , motorized and support, 
  so yeah , no zhalo for mechanized, 
  i do n't think she has either . 
  basically , if they `` find a mate '' they 'll change gender to the opposite ( not sure if permanently ) . 
  also , if they do n't have a partner they can asexually produce their own clones .
