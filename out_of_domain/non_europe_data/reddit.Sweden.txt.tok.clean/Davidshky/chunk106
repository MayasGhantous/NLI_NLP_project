  [ this one ] ( http://weaponsystems.net/weapon.php?weapon=ii02%20-%20130mm%20ak-130 ) can be worse . 
  2 barrels with 10-35 rpm per barrel . 
  so potentially 70 rpm . . 
  though personally i prefer the [ oto melara ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oto_melara_76_mm ) with it 's 85-120 rpm with just one barrel . 
  they 're even making a [ spaag ] ( http://www.military-today.com/artillery/draco.htm ) with the damn thing . 
  i wonder if it would fit on a cv-90 chassis . 
  imo , the best alternative to a sead plane is tube-artillery ( the high caliber sniper howitzers ) + recon . 
  maybe a bomber/multirole fighter with high ecm . 
  but i 'm not sure if rd has something like that and i would n't really recommend it anyway . 
  mmmmmmaybe get a plane with high ecm and use it to bait the enemy radar-sams into revealing their position and then use artillery to take them out . 
  i know , but tube-arty is imo the best counter against radar-aa if you 're not using sead . 
  personally i would keep the sead plane and napalm arty but he as asking for alternatives . 
  i 've seen this suggestion before and most people seemed to agree with it . 
  maybe the resistance to suppression could be based on the units armor value ? 
  too bad they ca n't do something like [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/77npquo.jpg ) with them . 
  replace one supply helo with a supply truck . 
  maybe replace the cv squad with a lightly armored cv vehicle . 
  replace one of the fallschirmj\u00e4ger with the 90s variant and maybe replace the second with panzergrenadiers 90 in a marder . 
  replace a roland 2 with a decent spaag . 
  you need recon helicopters so replace maybe one luchs and a hussards with some recon helos . 
  if you keep both hussards , put one of them in a fast ground transport . 
  with that little air-power you probably wo n't really need a sead plane . 
   the inevitable helo and cheap tank spam ? 
  the what now ? 
  i pretty much never see this . 
  is it because i mostly just play 10v10 ? 
  also , you could just do what i tend to do and save like 200 points at the start . 
  well there 's always the bkan, 
  sometimes i join games just to change deck because for some reason , whenever someone join or leave a game or the timer ticks down one second i go back to the top of my deck list . 
  this can get really annoying in 10v10 lobbies . 
  sometimes i leave an rejoin a game because i do n't want to be on/near the top of my teams list because that 's the guy who get all the units from those who leave . 
  yeah but that was total destruction without a time limit . 
  with something like a 20k point limit germany would have won after a few months . 
  the what now ? 
  is it the [ otomatic ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/otomatic_air_defense_tank ) or some prototype i 've never heard of ? 
  ok i 'm gon na assume these are not joke decks . 
   flapjacks & pain, 
  remove one fob and replace one supply helo with a supply truck . 
  upgrade your infantry overall ( eg , canadian rifles 85 ) . 
  one card of manpad infantry should be enough so get more regular infantry . 
  if available , get the th-something ifv . 
  you need anti-air units . 
  the adat is one of canadas best units so get like 2 cards of those and a spaag . 
  less tanks , 2 cards should be enough . 
  some of your recon infantry should be in helicopters . 
   meatball, 
  less aa units . 
  skip at least one m42 and maybe a hawk . 
  get one card of artillery . 
  replace one recon helicopter with recon inf in a helicopter . 
  get uhm ... some better vehicles ? 
  i 'll come back once i 'm home and can actually check the armory . 
  imo , if you 're gon na use a smerch ( or similar unit ) you should have at least one fob . 
  they use an insane amount of supplies and there 's no better source for that than a fob . 
  just do n't fire from it . 
   general ussr, 
  looks really good . 
  maybe consider putting your manpad squad in the skrezhet transport for some extra aa . 
  also , if you have two cards of infantry in skrezhets you could possibly skip the manpad infantry completely and bring something else . 
  except in eve , as long as the target is in range the missile will hit . 
  instead we have explosion velocity and explosion radius so even if the missiles have 100 % hit chance , they 're less effective against smaller/faster targets . 
  well your low expectations and the extended cut dlc did probably help a lot . 
  but for us fans who had loved the series for years this was supposed to be the ending and we were hyped as fuck . 
  then we got some strange conversation with the space-brat and 2-3 different ways to commit suicide , followed by some short cut-scenes and the normandy crashed on a planet . 
  in retrospect it 's not `` that horrible '' but when the rest of the trilogy is this awesome it should n't end with a big fucking `` meh '' ( or eh ? 
  yeah , but that 's a range thing . 
  that 's because our doctrine is based around fighting a russian invasion . 
  since they would outnumber us by a lot , each soldier must be able to outgun his opponents . 
  for example , [ here is a picture of a typical home-guardsman ] ( https://i.imgur.com/uz5lhcj.jpg ) . 
  this is also why we have [ so many officers ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/military_ranks_of_the_swedish_armed_forces#distribution_of_personnel_vs_ranks ) because according to simulations , the higher your rank the better you are in combat . 
  in case this strategy fails , finland has proved that snipers are a very effective counter to russians . 
   the great freedom fighters that reddit worships because they battle the evil man crossed a red line or something along those line ... 
  it 's a bit more complicated than `` rebels vs government '', 
  indeed . 
  basically the catalyst gives you 2-3 ways to kill yourself . 
  why would the reaper-destruction device be activated by shooting an explosive pipe ? 
  why would grabbing two electrocution-thingies give shepard control over the reapers ? 
  and jumping to your death ?!, 
  seems more likely that this is just some plot by harbinger to make shepard fail . 
  personally i 'll just pretend commander bailey found the actual big red anti-reaper button while shepard was tripping balls somewhere and that the last few minutes never happened . 
  afaik it 's pretty common to borrow weapons from the host nations during exercises . 
  not just because of logistics but also because of paperwork . 
  yeah , but i probably would have trusted that fucker even less . 
  i mean , at least the catalyst was kinda neutral but if harbinger told me that the only way to defeat him and his buddies was to commit suicide ... 
  yeah ... 
  imo they should just have removed the entire catalyst and choice part . 
  and no bullshit control or synthetic endings , just destroy . 
  shepard pushes the big red button , the reapers become extremely weakened ( but not insta-killed ) and then the forces you 've gathered fight them ( defeat should be possible ) and then you get a few cut-scenes depending on your choices throughout the trilogy . 
   no manpads as i play infantry supported with vhc strellas . 
  i think you should reconsider . 
  with 3 cards of mot-schutzen i do n't think you should need the motostrelci . 
  and if you take a card of manpad inf you could skip one fla-kom strela and get something else . 
  iirc it 's a special friday 13th mission that has been around for a while . 
  if grrm had written the ending it would have been like the me2 suicide mission except there would n't be any correct choices . 
  iirc , england/britain and france has the record for most wars fought between two countries unless you count the 100 year war as one war , then the record goes to sweden and denmark . 
  remove two amfibiebil 101 , get a supply helo, 
  replace one fallskerjeger with kustj\u00e4gare, 
  replace one lvkv fm/43 with a veak and the other one with either a bkan or the lvrbv 701, 
  replace both laro 106mm with another nm142 and a m/92 pnmk . 
  replace the danish f16 block 5 with the norwegian f16 fighting falcon .
