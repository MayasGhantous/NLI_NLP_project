  imo , 2x 1000 kg bombs is much better than 12x 227 kg bombs . 
   what design would you like to see ? ', 
  more non klingon ships for kdf . 
  like a science focused gorn cruiser . 
   ** more ** non klingon ships for kdf .

  not quite, 
  technician doffs reduce all current boff ability cooldowns by x % when you use a2b, 
  with 3 purple technicians this means that you can reduce all cooldowns by 30 % every 10 seconds . 
   redfor, 
  you do not need 3 command units . 
  replace one command inf with a fob . 
  imo you have a lack of normal rifle infantry . 
  not 100 % sure what 's available but i would try to fill the last infantry slot and replace maybe the sapery 85 with 2 cards of some regular infantry . 
  i think i 'll have to check what 's actually available when i get home before i give any more advice . 
  i rarely make any mixed decks . 
  first of all , always use all your activation points . 
  i would recommend getting a supply helo and maybe replacing the hemtt with something cheaper . 
  at least for me , supply vehicles have a tendency to die so i prefer using 10-20 point trucks and ferry supplies from the fob . 
  maybe replace the cv humvee with something with some armor . 
  i would probably use a lot less heli-transports for the infantry . 
  marines and smaw both have access to the ltvp-7a1 which is awesome so i would totally recommend putting both of them in that instead . 
  maybe replace the smaw or engineers with more marines ( they kinda do the same thing ) . 
  not really sure if the delta force is worth it . 
  maybe get some manpad infantry instead . 
  less tanks !, 
  you do n't need 3 cards of mid-tier tanks . 
  get rid of two of them and spend the points elsewhere . 
  replace the recon cobra with the longbow . 
  it 's one of the best units the us have . 
  put one of your recon infantry in a ground transport . 
  if you 're not gon na use more planes than that i would probably replace/remove the wild weasels . 
  if you need to kill some aa you can use your m110 arty . 
   the t-55 first entered service in 1946 . 
  huh ... 
  i always assumed it was around 1955 but according to wikipedia you 're kinda right . 
  why should there be ? 
  sure it was a swedish cb90 ? 
  i checked google and could n't find a single picture of a swedish cb90 with more than the standard weapons . 
  on the other hand the americans like to do stuff like [ this ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9b/flickr_-_official_u.s._navy_imagery_-_sailors_assigned_to_riverine_squadron_%28rivron%29_2_participate_in_pre-deployment_exercises_in_a_riverine_command_boat_%281%29.jpg ) with theirs . 
  yeah , i just figured that it would make sense for higher caliber artillery to produce more smoke and decided to test it . 
  then i also remembered [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo1s-ahew6m ) video about the bison being op so i tested some mortars as well . 
  i 'm tempted to make a canadian infantry charge deck with a ton of bison mortars and infantry in bison/grizzly transports and just charge straight into the enemy lines . 
   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_armed_groups_in_the_syrian_civil_war, 
  kolla bara `` syrian government and allies '', 
  probably the `` marauder shields '' comics . 
  it 's about the heroic marauder shields that tried to save us from the me3 ending . 
  you can find them [ here ] ( http://koobismo.deviantart.com/gallery/ ), 
  basically the same thing here . 
  shepard pushes the big red button ( who makes a device that 's activated by shooting a pipe ? ), 
  and then we get an ending depending on our choices throughout the trilogy . 
  instead of being an instant-kill device the crucible would only weaken the reapers and then it would be up to the forces you 've gathered to beat them . 
  if your score is too low the reapers could win and if it 's really high it would just be a mop up operation . 
  they are ? 
  i assumed ecm only affected missiles . 
  does it affect the cannons on spaags as well ? 
  as whatsupsteve said , [ manpad ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/man-portable_air-defense_systems ) is a weapon class . 
  the one in the piture is the [ robotsystem 70 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rbs_70 ) . 
  even non-radar spaags ? 
   that swedish gun is more to fast moving , road based urban areas than northern wilderness, 
  what ? 
  [ this ] ( https://www.google.se/search?q=volvo+a30d&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=ddefu9snfuwc4gsiv4dwcg&amp;ved=0cayq_auoaq&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=945 ) is what the used for the chassis and according to wikipedia the archer `` is capable of traversing snow up to a depth of 100 cm '' . 
  made for urban areas my ass . 
  basically . 
  iirc , it can undeploy and start moving while the first shell is still in the air . 
  combined with the 30-60 km range this means that by the time the enemies have located where the shells came from the archer is far away . 
  looks pretty solid . 
  personally i would put the panzergrens in the marder 1a1 . 
  that thing is totally worth the 10 points over the m113 and unlike the a2 or a3 it does n't reduce the availability of pzgren 90 . 
  skip one of the mid tier tanks and get another vehicle or the french tanks with wheels . 
  put the hussards in a heli transport and the fernsp\u00e4her in something better than a jupiter . 
   and that 1 meter snow is just not enough for ie . 
  norway , finland etc. 
  if it works in sweden it should work in 99 % of finland and norway . 
   upvet or rookie ? 
  good question . 
  personally i hate irreplaceable units but a lot of people here on reddit says that you should always upvet your asfs . 
   lastly is that sead plane worth it ? 
  if you intend to use your other planes and helicopters offensively then i would say yes . 
  also , sead planes are extremely nice in destruction since good aa units tend to be pretty expensive ( 85 point buk ) but are ( usually ) just as vulnerable to sead as their cheaper counterparts . 
  do n't think you can avoid them but there are ways to kill them with stealth + hacking . 
  at least the monitor 105 and the landing crafts can . 
   run azure nebula twice , once for rom marks and once for nukara, 
  cee is imo much better for nukara marks and less boring than anr . 
  and the dyson and undine battlezones are not far from each other so he could easily mess around in both . 
   only problem is that soviet transports are expensive as heck, 
  maybe so but imo they 're usually worth it . 
  i used to hate expensive transports but now i rather pay 20 points for something that can actually do something than 10 points for a can on wheels with a mg . 
  he could do what i did . 
  basically i tried making some armor decks but got annoyed by the unit restrictions and i realized i did n't really need that many tanks ( ever ) even when i used an armor deck . 
  so instead i just made some regular decks with 5 cards of good tanks and then ( while not really optimal ) used recon tanks and fire support vehicles to kinda fill the `` spam tank '' role . 
   i guess the heat gun property applies to all of them incl the amx30b2 brennus ? 
  check the armory if they have the [ heat ] tag or the [ ke ] tag . 
  the vast majority of tanks do not have heat weapons . 
  instead they usually have [ ke ] weapons that gets +1 ap for every 350 meters closer than max range they are to their target . 
  they need buffing in general but those thermobaric rocket-launchers should be nerfed , hard . 
  it probably would n't be so bad if it was n't for the damage bonus from veterancy but still . 
  atm redfor has a huuuuge advantage in forests and urban combat just because of li jiang 90 and spetznaz . 
  o __ o, 
  what were the stats back then ?
