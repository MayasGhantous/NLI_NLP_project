  maybe they could increase the turn-rate bonus aux is apparently supposed to give . 
  or maybe aux power could give us an accuracy bonus since it apparently does something with the ship sensors . 
  i had heard that aux gave a small turn-rate bonus and just assumed it was so small i did n't notice it . 
  in that case then maybe they should reintroduce it . 
  imo aux should basically be the `` 101 minor bonuses '' power . 
  no huge bonuses , but a lot of them . 
  a few wounded and stunned survivors from a crash i assume ? 
  damage type is usually pretty irrelevant except for min-maxers . 
  as long as you do n't mix them you can use whatever you want . 
  though using the same damage as the special ability can be useful . 
  for example , i once did over 100000 damage with a crit from the nadion saturation bomb and without the 5 phaser damage consoles it would n't have been anywhere near those numbers . 
  i would actually like having a charge-up pistol . 
  though i have to agree that it is boring to have it as the faction trait for so many of our `` special '' weapons . 
  imo it 's an ability they could give to the beamer and some other weapons . 
  or maybe as a weapon attachment if they ever decide to add empire-specific attachments . 
  the eidolon and corvus could be nice with some extra ooompf at long range . 
  * logistics, 
  replace the command infantry with something like the bdrm-2u . 
  also , transport helicopters are generally not recommended for command infantry unless you 're airborne or have a ground bases cv unit as well . 
  * infantry, 
  replace the bmp-1 with the glorious bmp-1d . 
  replace the gornos ( or maybe the morskayas ) with the best atgm infantry . 
  * support, 
  replace the malka with the msta . 
  maybe skip the nona mortar . 
  * tanks, 
  i would probably remove the t-62m or t-64bm . 
  you should n't need more tanks than that . 
  * recon, 
  if you removed the nona you should now have enough points to get a ka-52 . 
  imo one of the ussrs best units . 
  * vehicles, 
  you should also have saved 2 points from removing a tank so get the zhalo . 
  another really awesome ussr unit with high speed and an awesome gun . 
  i would probably downgrade the mi-24 to the one that costs 85 points but it 's not really necessary . 
  or maybe downgrade it to something even cheaper like an mi-4 . 
  [ indeed ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bm-21_grad#operators ), 
   is there any way to do so without leveling up a few times , which may take quite a while ? 
  unless you 're playing as a lonewolf you should be able to recruit a new companion in the halls of heroes and turn him/her into a crafter and/or blacksmith . 
  [ general info on the upcoming balance changes and dlc ] ( http://www.wargame-ee.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=155&amp;t=46090 ), 
  [ unit of the day ( rd version - dlc # 1 ) ] ( http://www.wargame-ee.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=155&amp;t=46456 ), 
   what do they mean by re-balance of both infantry and tanks ? 
  well my guess is that they 're gon na re-balance infantry and tanks . 
   what do they mean by re-roll and re-armament ? 
  well for example the us mountaineers is going to be transformed into cavalry scouts , a 5 man recon infantry unit with some variant of the dragon atgm . 
  iirc , fjb 40 90 has pretty much been confirmed but they have n't given us any details yet . 
  i would assume that they would at least get igla missiles instead of the strela . 
  that 's why i like the bm-24 so much . 
  it only has 12 ( 10 he ) rockets so it does n't take long to fire a salvo and run away . 
  east german commandos with strela manpads instead of an mg . 
  50 % more damage can be pretty significant . 
  for example it would only require 2 hits to take out a plane instead of 3 . 
  hopefully we 'll get several different variants including an asf . 
  scandinavia does n't have any sead planes or decent atgm planes so that could be some useful roles for the gripen . 
  maybe a multirole version with some he bombs so i do n't have to play as scandinavia or the the fucking sk-60b . 
   so you 're hungry for a pure swede deck ? 
  i 'm pretty fond of making national decks in general but the lack of a decent he bomber makes it kinda annoying to play as sweden . 
  scandinavia as a coalition is pretty decent when it comes to planes . 
  the asfs are pretty good , the norwegian f-16 with 2x1000kg bombs is awesome and the viggen with 10ap clusterbombs kinda makes up for the lack of a good atgm plane . 
   sweden left a lot to be desired at release . 
  well the scandinavian and nswp factions havent been updated to 1991 like all the other factions . 
  and imo sweden is probably the strongest of the 3 scandinavian factions . 
  i mean , the other 2 does n't even have atgm infantry : /, 
  yeah , max speed is apparently 706 km/h and cruise speed 560 km/h . 
  the il-102 on the other hand had a max speed of 950 km/h and it could use a speed buff . 
  also , wikipedia had a [ picture of an il-102 with rocketpods ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/26/i%c5%81-102_ntw_3_95_2.jpg ) so i googled a bit and found [ this pciture ] ( http://topwar.ru/uploads/posts/2011-05/1305517831_il102-1.jpg ) . 
  i need this !, 
  it would be like a bm-21 with wings !, 
   saw a guy the other day with a danish marine deck . 
  i want to know what he was smoking when he made that shit . 
  probably r\u00f8d p\u00f8lse . 
  barely playable faction combined with the most annoying deck-type : /, 
   to be honest , i do n't find myself using atgm infantry that often, 
  huh , for me they 're pretty much mandatory . 
  atgm vehicles are nice but they ca n't hide in buildings and forests the way infantry can . 
  it might be a bit too early to speculate about dlc # 2 except for what units the scandinavian factions will get ( pls give strf 9040/56 ) . 
  but since they 're also changing some stuff for other factions than the nswp in dlc # 1 ( like mountaineers becoming us cav scouts with atmgs ) and doing some balancing stuff in general it 's possible rd will also get some minor changes in dlc # 1 or that they 'll do something similar when they release dlc # 2 . 
  [ it 's not fabulous enough ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a6/pt-91_twardy_ntw_5_93_6.jpg ), 
  more like 3 hours of standard server maintenance + a few minutes of patching . 
   just invest in transports that can be used independently once you 've dumped the inf . 
  well there 's not really any options ( except for sk ) when it comes to transports for reservists . 
  most of them are just basic 10 point transports with an mg . 
  the only one without a weapon is the m6 mosegris . 
  at least personally i do n't really find those transports worth 10 points except maybe those with .50 cal mgs . 
  i would actually rather spend 15 or 20 points and get them a good transport with some firepower . 
  well apparently the il-102 is a ground-attack plane similar to the a-10 so it would make sense that it could have weapons like that . 
   aa other than spamming vtt-323s is also weak . 
  in case you have n't noticed , nk has a 10 he aa missile which means that if it does hit , it 's a kill . 
  sacrifice a lamb to rngesus and get a bunch of these . 
  looks pretty good . 
  personally i would remove ... something and fill the last two infantry slots with a light riflemen 90 and probably stinger c in humvees . 
  sometimes you just need a ground transport . 
   russian motorized, 
  i would probably remove one nona mortar and mmmaybe the zsu-23 and get more recon and vehicles . 
  i would really recommend the bdrm-3 recon vehicle . 
  it 's like a btr-80a with good optics and it can be incredibly useful for just driving around alone and killing stuff . 
  i would also get some cheaper recon infantry , 80 points is a bit expensive . 
  czechoslovakia + poland, 
  cost efficient spammable infantry, 
  a lot of interesting transports for said infantry .
