  air superiority fighters would probably be a lot more useful if you 're not planning on using your planes offensively . 
  i searched the forum for the word articulated and what i could find was, 
  * people talking about the swedish prototype articulated tank udes xx20 . 
  * people talking about articualted vehicles like the bv206, 
  * people talking about articulated wheels which i assume means that the wheels on the unit can turn . 
  first of all you should pretty much always have a fob since they 're the most cost efficient source of supplies and they make supply helicopters 10 times better . 
  when it comes to infantry i would probably remove one canadian rifles , one javelin and the maw and replace them with one canadian airborne in a grizzly/bison and one in a helicopter plus some engineers/pioneers in a grizzly/bison . 
  for support you 're missing one of the best canadian units . 
  the bison 81mm mortar . 
  it has the magic hidden ability to produce 2-3x more smoke than other mortars and are amazing for attacking heavily defended positions . 
  i would probably use a bit less tanks and you really should use the 15pt centurion as it 's incredibly cost efficient in terms of durability . 
  you want some sort of recon infantry and as canada you should imo get both the recce and the pathfinders . 
  the former are extremely sneaky and have a .50 cal sniper rifle and the latter are really good in combat . 
  for the vehicle section you do not need 4 cards of atgm vehicles . 
  remove like two of them and get one card of cougars . 
  the canadian atgm helicopter is extremely shitty so just skip it . 
  you probably also want the ch-135 gunship instead of the ch-118 . 
  if you have 5 points over now , get one card of electric voodoos , if not , remove one card of freedom fighters . 
   this is what i currently have . 
  should i get rid of one airborn in favor of the fob ? 
  no , you pretty much want as much infantry as possible . 
  get rid of a freedom fighter instead , that should give you 5 points which would afford you a fob + something else . 
  also , replace one airborne with some canadian rifles in the th-495 . 
  ifvs are really useful for assaulting positions . 
  and you do n't need two cards of javelins so get some pioneers in a grizzly/bison or th-495 . 
  you also want one of your recon infantry in a ground transport . 
  something like this, 
  when you 're making a deck and add a unit you can choose to get fewer units per card but at a higher veterancy level . 
  it 's just the way german grammar works when it comes to compound words . 
  [ `` rinderkennzeichnungs - und rindfleischetikettierungs\u00fcberwachungsaufgaben\u00fcbertragungsgesetz '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/compound_%28linguistics%29#examples_from_different_languages ) is a good example of way too long compound words . 
  same thing with swedish . 
  we can just combine words into extremely long super-words if we have/want to . 
  as long as you know the individual words it 's not hard at all . 
  here 's a swedish example . 
   could you show us what this would work in english if we did the same in that language ? 
  well you already have short compound words like firefighter , teacup and battleship . 
  if you know what the words fire and fighter means you can kinda figure out that firefighter means someone who fights fire . 
  now imagine doing the same thing but with more than just two words . 
  like firefighter education that in swedish would be `` brandmansutbildning '' which is a compound word of brand ( fire ) , man and utbildning ( education ) . 
  when it comes to the rules when you should and should n't i really do n't know . 
  it just kinda comes naturally . 
  `` northern baltic sea coastal artillery reconnaissance flight simulator facility equipment maintenance follow-up system discussion post preparation work ( s ) . '', 
  it was never given back irl either q __ q, 
   each post should have a screenshot of the deck, 
  first of all you do n't want two cv vehicles . 
  remove one of them or replace it with command infantry . 
  you also probably want a supply helicopter . 
  when it comes to infantry you want some atgm infantry , better manpad infantry and some spetsnaz . 
  for transports you should also probably use the bmp-1d instead of the 1p and the btr-zd zkrezhet instead of the robot . 
  other transports that are good are the btr-80a and btr-90 , bmp-3 . 
  actually , i 'll just post a picture instead . 
  something more like [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/to2ebgl.jpg ) deck . 
  it 's b, 
  / u/davidshky, 
   i do n't take both just the one with the aa missiles, 
  they both have 4x aa missiles . 
  yeah but the exceptional optics on the ka-52 can be very useful . 
  personally i pretty much always start with a recon helicopter for spotting airborne/motorized rushes , bombers etc etc. 
  another important change . 
  cheaper infantry transports !, 
  no idea , i just solved the puzzle . 
  i think one or both of the trucks in the front are asm trucks and the one in the background has the neva cs aa missiles . 
  edit : they 've added [ some more pictures ] ( https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.265787076949159.1073741836.116711115190090&amp;type=3 ) on facebook . 
  so yeah , new neva sc truck . 
  [ more new stuff ] ( http://www.wargame-ee.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=155&amp;t=46872&amp;start=190#p620724 ), 
  fire support infantry with an ags-17 gmg !!!!!!!!, 
  edit : apparently that picture could be a cruel lie . 
  nothing ... 
  it 's basically just delayed content . 
  with a major content update . 
  i think you could benefit a lot from putting the canadian rifles and/or the pioneers in the th-495 ifv . 
  while they are a bit slower , you should have enough infantry in fast transports to move around quickly and then the ifvs can arrive later and kill shit . 
  i also think that one of your recon infantry ( probably recce ) should be in a ground transport for those situations where a helicopter is n't the best option . 
  also , you want the 15pt centurion instead of the 25pt version for maximum spammability . 
  [ more interesting changes ] ( http://www.wargame-ee.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=155&amp;t=46090&amp;start=650#p620067 ), 
   the british gr .7 are no longer atgm planes , nor are they `` dumb '' bombers : twisted :, 
   su-24m has taken the role of the il-102 . 
  it is now the iron bomber extraordinaire . 
  all hail its 7500kg payload . 
   il-102 behaves lore like the su25 now . 
  its a cas aircraft of a different sort , but one that has its niche . 
  prepare yourselves for the [ flying grad mlrs ] ( http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--tw8mkk7d--/c_fit,fl_progressive,q_80,w_636/acfwo7kaq6gytg9ktcdf.jpg ), 
  maybe so , but the captain got the medal for his `` service as the commanding officer of the vincennes '' and at least in my opinion after a fuckup of that magnitude you should n't be getting anything except an `` early retirement '' ( which i guess he kinda did ) . 
  sometimes i wish it did n't happen in destruction either . 
  it 's basically free magical intel . 
  just imagine if they removed the + x popups unless you had a visual on the target and that the score would only update once every minute or something . 
  recon would be even more important and artillery would get an indirect nerf . 
  could you be a bit more specific ? 
  there are 9 different harriers in the game . 
  and personally i thought the gr .7 was pretty decent though it would have been much better if it had f&f atgms . 
  oh i agree , but i think destruction would be a lot more interesting without the instant kill-confirmation . 
  like a +85 telling you that the damn buk is dead . 
   the ones with mavericks only have 2 of those iirc , which is 1/3 what you could get with a warthog, 
  the mavericks are better in terms of accuracy and ap and the harrier is 50 % faster than the a-10 and it has better ecm . 
   and the ones with bombs on them only get 2-4 instead of the 8-12 that most other jets get . 
  not really . 
  4x500kg is pretty normal for a multirole fighter . 
  those with 6-8 bombs either have much weaker ( 250-350kg ) bombs or they suffer some other penalties like lower availability , higher cost etc etc. 
  the ones with 2 bombs are also pretty normal for cheap spam-bombers . 
   they 're also so painfully slow,
