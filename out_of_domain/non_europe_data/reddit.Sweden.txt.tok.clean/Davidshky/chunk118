  imo , ussr , china/rd , east germany , east block and canada all work pretty well as motorized . 
  the key is ( kinda obviously ) the transports , the vehicles and the recon units you can get . 
  first of all , redfor has more or less slapped 14,5 mm hmgs on 80 % of their apcs and those things are fucking awesome . 
  1 ap is n't much but against a 10pt tin-can it 's enough and it gets higher the closer you get . 
  china , nk and ussr all have some wheeled transports with autocannons which means that you can both be fast and have some decent firepower . 
  the btr-80a and 90 also have 30 % stabilizers so they 're more accurate on the move than many ifvs are while stationary . 
  poland and czechoslovakia also have the skot 2 with an atgm which can also be kinda useful . 
  the reason i kiiinda like east germany as motorized is because i can get a metric ton of fjb 40 in fast transports  , 
  canada is good because they have some really fast transports , decent infantry and the bison mortar . 
  magical super-smoke + really fast transports = frontal assaults . 
  yeah , liquorice is pretty much only popular in the north for some reason ( viking ancestry maybe ? ) . 
  i feel sorry for all those who ca n't enjoy the awesomeness of [ turkisk pepar ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/62/tyrkisk_peber.jpg ) , [ djungelvr\u00e5l ] ( http://www.scandinavianstuff.com/shop/11328/art28/h7733/3247733-origpic-02bf78.jpg ) and [ gb gr\u00e4ddglass laktrispuck ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9pf0nrbsh_g/tpm189rj3gi/aaaaaaaabh0/ibuqufzb74e/s1600/lakritspuck.png ) . 
  i havent really had much success with them either and usually prefer the skrezhet but i 've lost enough vehicles to them to not underestimate them . 
  quality does n't really matter that much when 10 of the fuckers fire at the same target . 
   you can move this ghost without affecting the spawn zone . 
  this is gon na be very useful . 
  so far i 've basically been calling in the units from the zone where i want them , forget about them for a minute or two and then move them to where i want them . 
  maybe asgard will be less frustrating to play now . 
  my guess is that it 's a recon unit, 
  or maybe they 've changed the komandosi somehow and this is the replacement . 
  [ video with humans for scale ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_ixamdnfm ), 
   there should be a way to not receive teammates units when they quit . 
  do n't be on the top of the playerlist . 
  legend of galactic heroes, 
  110 episodes and pretty much as many characters, 
  * infantry, 
  imo replace the m67 with some japanese rifle infantry in that ifv and the hudou-ren with some elite infantry . 
  * support, 
  imo you could use a bit more aa and japan has some of the best non-radar aa units in the game . 
  personally i would remove the mlrs and one of your aa units and replace them with one card each of the short/closed arrow units . 
  also , if you want a spaag the korean one is considered to be better . 
  * tanks, 
  i would probably remove one of the 55pt tanks and the 10pt one as well . 
  you do n't need that many tanks and sk has the m18 vehicle that 's better for spamming . 
  * recon, 
  consider replacing the km900 with the one that has a gmg . 
  also , you should have some spare points so i would recommend getting the japanese recon vehicle with a 30mm ac for driving around and hunting . 
  or get a cheaper recon helicopter to use for those tasks where you do n't want to risk one of your ninjas . 
  * vehicles, 
  remove the chu-mat and get an m18 and the flamethrower m113 . 
  * planes, 
  not 100 % sure what bd has in terms of planes but i would not recommend the a-37b so replace it with something else . 
  ** edit : ** i made an [ example deck ] ( http://i.imgur.com/a7yfjae.jpg ) of what i mean . 
   rifle infantry disappoint me on paper due to their sub-par range . 
  what 's their actual performance like compared to m67s ? 
  well they 're better in general except for shooting stuff at 1,4 km range which is basically all the m67s are good for . 
   the gatling gun units , i take it ? 
  no , the closed and short arrow missile units . 
   what does the hellcat ( ... ) have that the 10pt tanks do n't ? 
  100 km/h offroad speed . 
   again , what do those vehicles have that the chu-mat does n't ? 
  well you still have the tow-2 jeep so the chu-mat is kinda redundant and the m18 and flamethrower m113 would give you more variation . 
  and do n't underestimate flamethrower vehicles , there are few units as effective and murdering infantry as them . 
   picked the a-37 because it 's a decent multi-role aircraft by the looks of it . 
  iirc , it has 2x shitty he bombs , 2x shitty clusterbombs and 2x shitty ir missiles + it 's kinda slow . 
  so it 's not really good at anything at all . 
  edit : i 've booted up the desktop so now i 'm able to check the armory and as i remembered the a-37b is just bad , so fucking bad . 
  2x 245kg clusterbombs ( clusterbombs are in general shit in rd ) , 2x 250kg he bombs and 2x ir missiles with 30 % accurate , 600 km/h speed and 0 % ecm . 
  also , the f-4ej and kf-5e are not very good either . 
  personally i would recommend the kf-16c for killing planes and maybe the f-16c block 30 if you want something with ir missiles . 
  i would replace one avenger with a paladin or atcam so you have some counter artillery capabilities .
