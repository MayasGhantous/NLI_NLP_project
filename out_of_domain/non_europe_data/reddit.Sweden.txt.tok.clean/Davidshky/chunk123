  you do not need 3 cards of logistic trucks ... 
  remove one and replace another with a logistic helicopter . 
  maybe get a second cv card as well . 
  * infantry, 
  personally i would put the javelins and the airborne in a grizzly/bison . 
  one card of infantry in helicopters is usually enough for regular decks and you usually want some infantry in something fast without all the penalties of a helicopter . 
  the ability to unload manpad infantry in a second is also incredibly useful . 
  * tanks, 
  i do n't think you 'll ever need that many tanks . 
  * recon, 
  put one of the inf recon in a ground transport . 
  replace one cougar with a helicopter . 
  * vehicles, 
  replace the 35pt m150 with a cougar . 
  remove/replace the shitty atgm helicopter . 
  * planes, 
  get some electric voodoos . 
  blue dragons, 
  * logistics, 
  i would maybe replace the cv jeep with the wheeled cv with 1-2 armor that i can never remember the name of . 
  * infantry, 
  imo you could benefit from some infantry in an ifv . 
  i 'm also not sure if engineers are worth it when you only have 5 infantry slots . 
  personally i would remove the gongbyung , the udt/seal and the hudou-ren . 
  instead i would get the japanese elite infantry in a helicopter , atgm infantry in something fast and the japanese regular infantry in their awesome ifv . 
  if you think the japanese ifv is a bit expensive the kafv 25 or kafv 40/50 are also nice . 
  * support, 
  4 cards of aa units is a bit too much . 
  remove one to save some points . 
  * tanks, 
  imo , remove two of the top-tier tanks , get another k1 and the japanese gmg tank . 
  the k1 is probably one of the most cost efficient tanks in the game and the gmg tanks is insane vs infantry . 
  * recon, 
  replace the kafv 90 with something with wheels . 
  maybe the japanese recon vehicle with an autocannon . 
  it 's faster and the ac is usually more useful . 
  the fiat something is also pretty nice . 
  advanced light cruiser aka miranda 2.0, 
  ** boff seating **, 
  * commander engineering, 
  * lt. com tactical, 
  * lt. com science, 
  consoles : 4 engineering , 3 science , 3 tactical, 
  4/4 weapon layout . 
  turn rate : 10 ish, 
  can use dual cannons . 
  +5 power to all subsystems . 
  all 4 cruiser commands . 
  special ability/console/item : i dunno lol, 
  a new modern spiritual successor to the old miranda light cruiser . 
  a small , agile multi-purpose cruiser with a flexible boff layout . 
  should have the same basic design as the miranda ( ie , nacelles under the saucer ) but much more modern/white/shiny . 
  inefficient = the ap of your tanks gun is too low to penetrate the armor ( av ) of the target . 
  damage done = ( ( ap - av ) / 2 ) +1, 
  this basically means that the ap has to be equal or greater than the av of the target to do any damage unless the weapon has the [ heat ] tag . 
  [ heat ] means that it will always do a minimum of 1 damage regardless of the targets armor . 
  most tanks on the other hand tend to have the [ ke ] tag . 
  [ ke ] means that for every 175m closer you are to the target you gain 1 ap . 
  you simply have shitty tanks and unless you can hit the sides or rear of the target you 'll have to get closer so that the [ ke ] bonus will make your ap high enough . 
  the homeguard basically rely a lot on `` hand-me-down '' equipment that the `` real '' military has stopped using . 
  before they got the ak4 in 1995 they used the [ m/96 mauser ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swedish_mauser ) so even if the ak4 is kinda old compared to the ak5 it 's still a lot better than what they used to have . 
  one thing i really like about playing mechanized as sweden/scandinavia is that you can get manpad and atgm infantry transported in ifvs . 
  it is kinda expensive but i like ifvs . 
  even the pbv 302 can do a lot of damage against infantry and light vehicles . 
  i would hardly call them excellent but for 15 points they 're good enough . 
  it 's just that they 're a lot better than what most nations get for their manpad/atgm squads when making a mech deck . 
  well sweden will probably get the aa version of the cv90 and on the forums people keep saying that denmark will get the prototype otomatic 76mm spaag . 
  well he 's in a science ship so he want a lot of aux-power but he should get more weapon power . 
  iirc gold members can refine ** up to ** 56k dil at the same time because they 're able to simply refine once per week and 8 * 7 = 56 . 
  from the wiki, 
   8k per day ( automatically upon logging in , up to one week 's worth per login ), 
  i guess op got confused by this somehow . 
  what if the plane had to return home to provide any intel ? 
  like you temporarily get some sort of `` snapshot '' of where the enemy units were when the plane passed over them . 
  kinda depends on how damage bonuses are calculated . 
  afaik the bonuses from the extra console and weapon power will be stacked additively while the sa bonus might be multiplicative . 
  does catching , domesticating and exporting animals have any effect on which animals will be available when i embark the next time ? 
  any way to find out which animals are available before embarking ? 
  and some people say the 14,5 mm hmgs are bad :p, 
  yeah , but they stack additively . 
  my point is simply that some bonuses are added multiplicatively which can make them a lot more powerful than they sound like . 
  as you said , a 4th 25 % damage console would only increase damage by 14,2 % compared to 3 while sa `` should '' always increase the damage by ( up to ) 30 %, 
  found this post on the forums, 
   the problem with this way of thinking is that tac consoles will give a maximum of +31.9 % damage each ( and a bit of crith/critd ) but this is only a category 1 damage buff - it 's effectively additive to base damage , not multiplicative . 
   the new variant of sensor analysis grants 5 % per stack and stacks up to 6 times over 18 seconds , for a total of +30 % . 
  but that 's category 4 ( or even category 5 ? ), 
  damage - it effectively multiplies everything you throw out just prior to your shot actually hitting the enemy and being affected by enemy damage resistances . 
   in a normal build you will end up outputting around 700-900 % of your `` base '' damage - this is the result of buffs and skillpoints and weapons power , meaning that every point of + damage you get from multiplicative buffs such as sensor analysis is going to be worth approximately 8 points of + damage from category 1 buffs like tactical consoles . 
  after just 3 seconds , sensor analysis will be granting additional damage equivalent to more than the additional damage granted from one tactical console . 
  after the full 18 seconds , it 'll be ridiculously higher ( working out at roughly the same as about seven and a half tactical consoles ! ), 
  sweden : [ 22 ] 180 to 500, 
  pretty much every country on that list had more volunteers than sweden , even those at war/invaded by germany . 
  [ indeed ] ( http://a.pomf.se/avcnpw.webm ), 
  buy it somewhere else then ? 
  for example , what 's the price on [ gmg ] ( http://www.greenmangaming.com/s/se/en/pc/games/strategy/civilization-beyond-earth/ ) for you australians ? 
  that 's where i 've been buying most of my games the last year since except for steam sales gmg is cheaper 90 % of the time . 
  or is there some evil region restriction preventing you from buying it on some foreign site ? 
  ouch ... 
  is there really no online store that does n't give you aussies horrible prices ? 
  can you at least use the 20 % off voucher ?
