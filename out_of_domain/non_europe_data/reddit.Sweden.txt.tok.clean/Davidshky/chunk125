  iirc they 're thinking of replacing the ac-130 in the future and just imagine a vtol with a 105mm howitzer and a 40 mm autocannon . 
   lock the doors to the hatchery and/or make sure the eggs are disables for all your stockpiles . 
  i still do n't understand why some people think accuracy bonuses are additive . 
  just imagine if elite ifvs got a 32 % additive acc bonus . 
  bmp-2s with 47 % accuracy : /, 
  i also still do n't understand why so many of you keep writing like `` 70 + ( .24 * 70 ) '' and `` 86.8 - ( 0.40 * 86.8 ) '' instead of just 70 * 1.24 and 86.8 * 0.6, 
  probably this one, 
   [ gr ] increases damage of ambush by 100 % , but all bonus damage is now a dot, 
  well the lsv is an improved version of the [ desert patrol vehicle ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/desert_patrol_vehicle ) that came into service in 1991 . 
  if the next wargame takes place in the middle east or something like that the dpv would be a pretty nice recon vehicle for the us but in wg : rd. . . nah . 
   hy should it not be included ? 
  i would be a neat fast recon ? 
  well that role is already filled by the m151a2 mutt , fav , the two different humvees , the v-150 and the lav-25 . 
  the us does n't really need another fast recon vehicle . 
   and why would it be limited to the middle east ? 
  well it would kinda feel wrong to have the desert patrol vehicle in ... `` not the desert '' . 
  exactly !, 
  personally i do n't really give a shit about winning . 
  it 's not like i gain anything from it and i 'd rather lose an intense slugfest where people go all-in than win a 1 hour trench warfare snorefest . 
  one of the most fun games i 've had was a 10v10 on gjoll where most of my team left and we ended up in a 3v9 game where i and the other two dudes just stubbornly tried to hold our ground against the communist horde until the time or points ran out . 
  the video is from 2012 though . 
  could you like post a picture ? 
  iirc it just looks like the silenced [ type 85 smg ] ( http://world.guns.ru/smg/ch/type-5-e.html ), 
   the crazy part is that i swear i have seen that gun somewhere before . 
  maybe you 're thinking of the soviet as val ? 
  i 'm not sure if those are actually desert maps . 
  might be a bit dry but at least two of them are in korea which ( afaik ) does n't really have any deserts . 
  i have n't played the campaign though so i guess it 's possible some of the maps are in one of the chinese deserts . 
  tbh the game kinda need more dil sinks right now . 
  the fleet starbases/embassies/etc were some of the biggest dil sinks but most of those are finished and with nothing else to really spend their dil on , people buy zen , which is kinda why the cost of zen has been constantly increasing for a long time ( was 200 !!, 
  dil per zen for a while a few days ago ) . 
   what other debuffs could there be ? 
  * squad leader is dead/wounded : increased suppression and reduced morale recovery for x seconds . 
  * machinegunner/flamethrowerdude/rocketlauncherguy is dead/wounded : the related weapon is disabled for x seconds . 
  * bored ( if they 've been inactive for too long they 'll become bored and pay less attention ) : reduced optics, 
   us military legal adviser told helicopter crew that iraqi men were valid targets as they could not surrender to aircraft, 
  maybe that is the `` standard procedure '' nowadays ? 
   that game was had the rockiest , fuckedest , rollercoastest balancing period in the first year ~, 
  i remember when the tyranids range synapse aura gave ranged units a chance ( 35 % iirc ) to knock down infantry . 
  one warrior brood upgraded with the venom cannon ( for the range synapse ) + a fuckton of termagants and no infantry even stood a chance . 
  good times, 
  i 'm 99 % sure that at some point the range synapse did give a knockdown chance bonus and not just a damage bonus . 
  [ synapse guide from 2009 ] ( http://www.gamereplays.org/dawnofwar2/portals.php?show=page&amp;name=dawn-of-war-2-beta-tyranid-synapse-overview ), 
   ranged synapse, 
   increases ranged damage by 30 %, 
   ** adds chance to knockback on hit **, 
   multiple upgrades do not stack, 
  [ patch notes from february 2009 . 
  ] ( http://www.gamereplays.org/dawnofwar2/portals.php?show=news&amp;news_id=451106 ), 
   termagant knockdown chance while under ranged synapse reduced to 25 % , from 35 % . 
  some balance changes to rebel armies ( not civil war rebels ) . 
  imo they should n't have access to anything but shit units unless they 've conquered a city with a barrack and still then they should be pretty limited . 
  it 's annoying to lose a city to a rebellion and a few turns later the rebels have a stack of 20 units that are even better than the stuff you can recruit . 
  it 's like they 're being helped by russia or something . 
  good question, 
  i checked the [ upgrade list ] ( http://www.arcgames.com/en/games/star-trek-online/news/detail/7002163 ) and the normal obelisk is n't even on it . 
  i guess this applies to the normal obelisk since it was a mission reward at first . 
   tier 5 starships that have been omitted from this list , as they do n't qualify for an upgrade , are those that fall into one of the following categories :, 
   starships with a dilithium or rank-up token cost, 
   starships that cost fleet credits only, 
   ** starships that are awarded from completion of an episode **, 
   mirror universe starships, 
  personally i would wait until after the release to be sure . 
  maybe they 'll change their mind and at least allow people to buy an upgrade for the normal obelisk since it kiiinda is a fleet ship as well . 
  actually i would recommend you to wait with buying anything expensive until after dr is released . 
  why not ? 
  they have some interesting ships , battle cloaks and can have a full crew of romulan operative boffs . 
  iirc walls built from blocks are also climbable but much harder to climb than rough walls . 
  maybe because of this ? 
  first of all , why not just use both ? 
  with the loadout system and the ability to quickly change ship in space there 's not much stopping you from using several different ships . 
  when it comes to why the ambassador is better , it 's mostly because it has a lt. com science station . 
  section 31 uniform code : ~ ~ msmcgxsb ~ ~ yteyv0fy, 
   tal shiar adapted battle cruiser ( t5-u ) : 4 eng , 4 sci , 3 tac, 
  upgrades :, 
   enchanced weapon banks : ** +15 % critical severity **, 
  well my romulan main in an adapted bc is about to get even better  , 
  upgrades :, 
  precise weapon systems : +2.5 % accuracy, 
  enchanced weapon banks : +15 % critical severity, 
  devastating weaponry : +2.5 % critical chance, 
  enchanced weapon systems : +10 % kinetic and all energy damage, 
  i just ... wat ... 
  need winter event now !, 
  maybe they 're using some really old soviet base that used to contain kirov airships or something . 
  sounds kinda like he embarked just at the end of winter and all the snow quickly melted away or something . 
  try using more auxiliaries . 
  it can make each campaign a lot more unique as you 'll end up using different units depending on which part of the world you 're fighting in . 
  ofc other factions can do it as well with mercenaries but oh god the upkeep . 
  there can be snow in spring as well depending on where you are . 
  they can be pretty useful for automatically dumping ore , economic stones and coal down to your magma forges . 
  i think something similar could also be useful for keeping your refuse stockpile somewhat empty . 
  how about a `` unit type of the week '' discussion . 
  it would be a bit easier to do ( fewer threads ) and would n't take several years . 
  like one week we discuss manpad infantry units , the next , sead planes and after that , cavalry tanks . 
   to make it last several years you could break it down by faction . 
  maybe , but personally i would like to for example discuss the pros and cons of similar units on both sides , like ifvs with autocannons and atgms . 
  this week i learned that i can check what kind of flux stone ( s ) i have available on my embark by checking the stone tab . 
  basically , if for example there is chalk on my embark , it will not be restricted in the stone settings . 
  i also kinda learned that i can simply dig/channel a hole into the soil and build a roof over it to have a perfectly safe `` surface '' farm for strawberries , rope reed etc etc.
