  just smoked the shit out of everything with some bison mortars ( < 3 their superior smoke ) and then charged in with canadian rifles and engineers in bisons/grizzlys . 
  a mass rush with a ton of shitty north korean helicopters also comes to mind . 
  basically overwhelmed the defenders aa with a swarm of mi-8s , mi-4s and md 500s + some recon helicopters . 
  every room except archery ranges . 
  some different cv90 variants . 
  strf 9040/56 ifv ( cv90 with rbs 56 atgm ) lvkv90 spaag and the strf 90105 or 90120 light tank/fsv . 
  tbh , sometimes i really wish i could let my boffs do the button pushing on some of the ground missions . 
  i 'm an admiral , not a handyman !, 
  ensign redshirt can go fix the bajorans damn plants and stuff . 
  when defending on some map with a lot of forests like gjoll , the avre + recon combo is insanely awesome . 
  basically put 1-2 avres and some recon vehicle with very good/exceptional optics about 1,5 km away from the edge of the forest that you except enemies to come from and then laugh as 2 squads of komandosi are wiped out in one salvo . 
  the problem is that the reason we got the strv 121 was because the germans were selling off a lot of their military equipment after the reunification and gave us a good deal for some leo 2a4s while we were negotiating the deal for the leo 2a5 . 
  so with no leo 2a5 deal and no german reunification the strv 121 does n't make that much sense . 
  the strange this is that it looks like there are at least 2 other delta-quadrant ships in dr. 
  [ the hazan destroyer and benthan assault cruiser . 
  3 lockbox ships seem kinda odd since they pretty much always comes in pairs . 
  i guess one of them could be a sort of mission reward ( later on sold in some new fleet holding ) and the other 2 the lockbox + lobi ships with some sort of 3p item set . 
   it is , probably , entirely the wrong idea . 
  probably yes . 
  as icaria said , you basically want all 7 weapons to fire at the same time . 
  your build means that 3 of your 7 weapons will be useless most of the time which is very inefficient . 
  either go with a broadside build with beam arrays + the omni and cutting beams or a `` front heavy '' - build with dbbs/dhcs in the front and the omni + cutting beams + turrets in the aft . 
   fleet ap dbbs [ dmgx3 ] [ critd ], 
  also , avoid the [ dmg ] modifier in the future . 
  it 's basically considered the worst of the 4 standard weapon modifiers . 
  i imagine it something like this, 
  picard : number 1 , the bajorans have a bunch of boring shit that needs to be done . 
  assemble an away-team to deal with it so i do n't have to . 
  riker : we could send laforge , broccoli and crusher to do it . 
  picard : make it so !, 
  the rest of the episode is crusher awkwardly flirting with some bajoran girl while geordi and broccoli are trapped in a jem ` hadar combat simulation with no safety systems on . 
  well [ accx2 ] would still have been better since accuracy can increase both crith and critd . 
  also , if your goal is to use bo then you should probably avoid having any beam weapons other than dbbs . 
  otherwise you risk wasting the bo attack on a much weaker weapon . 
  from [ wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/combat_vehicle_90#variants ), 
   stridsfordon 9040/56 : prototype version of the cv 9040 equipped with the bofors rb56 anti-tank missile . 
  issues with the sight alignment were unsolved and no units ordered . 
  imo they really should try to fix this . 
  modern ifvs kinda need atgms . 
  i wonder if they could put an rbs 70 on the lvkv90 as well . 
  ^ ^ ssssssssshhhhhhh, 
  ^ ^ ^ it 's ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ secret !, 
  because i do n't want to think about the cost but i still kinda want to brag about my luck . 
  from wikipedia, 
   the vehicle chassis is based on that of the combat vehicle 90 . 
  since the cv90 can carry 8 passengers i guess they still had some room left even with the extra stuff . 
  tbh the pl-01 kinda feel like a slightly more futuristic-looking cv90120-t . light tanks/fire-support vehicles with the same ( ish ) chassis , 120 mm guns and ir-stealth . 
  i guess bae systems might have something to do with that . 
  probably bad timing . 
  when i 've sold contraband in bulk i usually sell them at the lowest price per unit and they usually get sold really fast . 
  eg , one time i put up 7 stacks of 250 contraband and i think 5 of the stacks were sold within like 30 minutes and the last two not long after that . 
  i 'm sorry but i do n't think many people would be willing to sell you that much at 20-30 % below the exchange price . 
  it would be a 2,5-4 mil loss per stack . 
  well if you have access to a lot of wood it could be worth it to make wooden crafts for trading . 
  the only thing i personally consider `` mandatory '' is one cat for killing vermin but there are other animals that can be pretty useful, 
  * dogs : useful for defense and when/if you end up with a ton of them they can be a decent source of meat , bone , leather , etc. 
  you can just lock them in their own 1x1 pens and forget about them . 
  might not be worth it to embark with them but totally worth to request from the traders . 
  * birds : can be a nigh-infinite source of food and lag and they 're cheap as fuck . 
  10 hens and 2 roosters cost 72 points and can feed you for a long time . 
  just remember that if you intend to breed them you 'll have to disable eggs from your stockpiles or lock the door to the room with the nest-boxes . 
  * sheep/alpacas/llamas : grazers that can be both milked and sheared so they provide both food and cloth . 
  the latter two are kinda expensive though so i would n't recommend embarking with them . 
  * goats : very cheap milkable grazers . 
  cost half as much as pigs and sheep . 
  if you have access to grass/moss these are probably the most cost-efficient animals for cheese production . 
   the frequency with which animals are able to be milked is defined in the raw files with the tag [ milkable : local_creature_mat : milk :20000 ] . 
  all milkable creatures currently have this tag set to 20000 ticks , which , at roughly 1200 ticks per day , means they all can be milked every 17 game days . 
  my recommendation would be to use the manager for milking and cheese making . 
  yeah there are some bugs when checking the stats of weapons outside of their `` natural environment '' . 
  sometimes if you check your ground weapons in space it will give you something absurd like 2000 dps . 
  maybe space weapons do have much lower damage but there 's some sort of `` in space '' damage modifier ( or vice versa ) . 
  but should it really be that low ? 
  and how would that explain the high damage of ground weapons in space ? 
  o ________ o, 
  also , how do you get that much energy drain from plasmionic leech without a ton of flow cap consoles ? 
  ok , i only thought the embassy console was a flow cap console but you 're probably right about the other one . 
  i just got confused since i have a character in a sci ship with maxed out flow cap skill , 4x purple mk xi flow cap consoles and a mk xii tachyon deflector with [ flwc ] and he drains 3.5 power with plasmionic leech . 
  i guess ur mk xiii stuff is better than i thought . 
  i think they 're fleet spire damage consoles . 
  there is no such thing in sto . 
  pen them in there before locking the door . 
  i 'm pretty sure fleet elite pets have always been ur . 
  if you 're patient you could just do the hourly romulan reputation project over and over again . 
  though it might take a while since the reward is random it is a pretty cost efficient way to acquire vr mk xi-xii weapons . 
  maybe they could do something like this, 
  the first two traits are determined by the ships class ( escort , cruiser , carrier , etc ) and the other two by the ships `` secondary focus '' or whatever you should call it . 
  lets use the odysseys as an example , instead of, 
   enhanced hull plating +25 all energy and radiation resistance rating, 
   armored hull +10 % hull hitpoints, 
  the tactical odyssey would get, 
   enhanced weapons systems +10 % all energy and kinetic damage, 
   devastating weaponry +2.5 % critical chance, 
  and the science odyssey, 
   enhanced restorative circuitry +10 % to hull and shield healing abilities, 
   enhanced particle generators +15 % damage to exotic damage abilities, 
  or something like that . 
  it would still be fairly standardized ( though they could ofc mix it up a bit ) but would still create a bit more variation than the current system . 
  ** edit : ** more ideas, 
  some ships might need some different treatment , like bops and carriers .
