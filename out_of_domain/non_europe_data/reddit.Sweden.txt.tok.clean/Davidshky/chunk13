  everything gets wiped , even the characters . 
  this makes me happy that i have no friends . 
  awesome aws-8q with either 4 ppcs , 4 large pulse lasers or 4 large lasers , a smaller engine and a ton of heatsinks . 
  removed all armor in both arms since i do n't use them ( might be a bad idea but it has worked so far ) and put even more heatsinks in the rest of the mech . 
  then i slowly walk around and blast things from afar . 
  but this will just result in people going `` esamir !, 
  why should i fight there if i 'm not getting any resources to do so with ? '' . 
  now ofc people will do so because esamir is new and exciting but later on when we have several continents people will most likely avoid those were they have few/no bases . 
  especially since auraxium is so important . 
  also , if they just share auraxium between continents and not the other resources it should still be pretty balanced since most unlocks are sidegrades rather than upgrades . 
  i 'm talking about the sequel . 
  since most of the classes we saw appeared to either be new or use powers the existing classes of that race ca n't use i 'm gon na assume all we saw was new classes . 
  and this mean we 're getting more geth !, 
  ace = turret iirc, 
  transport cert for the liberator . 
  you lose the big gun but add the ability to transport 4-6 guys who can fire from it . 
  and while on the topic of aircraft certs , add a bomber cert for the galaxy , replacing the transport capabilities , reduces armor and maybe removes 2 gunners for the ability to drop bombs on people . 
  this would give us something similar to the ps1 liberator while the ps2 liberator can remain more of a gunship . 
  what if the cert gives the lib a speed and agility bonus because of the reduced weight from not having a huge cannon + a few tons of ammo, 
  as someone who just recently decided that i was gon na watch through tng ( near the end of season 2 atm ) yars death changed the way i viewed the series . 
  a major character dying like that for me meant that it 's more likely to happen again and that all major characters do n't have top grade plot armor . 
   i disagree with moving the repair tool to the `` toggled special ability '' button . 
  that 's not what he said . 
  he said the ace tool should be moved to the f key . 
  my guess is that they are finally getting rid of the limitation in which class can have which powers . 
  it kinda began with the vorcha soldier having flamer ( a tech power ) and the n7 sentinel not having any biotic powers . 
  now we 're getting biotic infiltrators !, 
  came here to say this . 
  with no timer , whoever has to defuse it do n't know if it 's inactive , is about to explode or will explode somewhere around the release of half life 3 . 
  on the other hand , if the resources are shared and lets say one continent is evenly divided between the factions while the other is mostly controled by one faction , it would be easier for the two losing factions to make a counterattack using the resources earned from the bases they have on the first continent . 
  though i agree that what you 're saying can happen i still think sharing resources would be for the best , or as i said in my previous post , at least the auraxium . 
  not really . 
  when i see 8-12 people around some small base it 's kinda safe to assume that most of them are in the same squad . 
  it 's even easier to tell of you see some of them using spawn beacons . 
  i 've been saying this even before the n7 paladin . 
  now can i please have my geth sentinel with defense matrix . 
  i 'm vs, 
  it 's gon na have to be a draw between the magrider and scythe with the flash close behind . 
  the magrider is just too much fun with its extreme offroad capabilites , strafing and speed boost . 
  then the scythe is awesome because of its agility . 
  i can win most dogfights and i can do crazy maneuvers when attacking ground targets or fleeing hostiles . 
  and then the flash , that i used to hate but learned to love when i spent my spare aruaxium on the m20 machinegun . 
  i 've gotten so many vehicle kill assits , shot down mosquitos , a sunderer and kill ( + pissed off ) a ton of infantry . 
  an alarm sound/light would be great but how about reducing the speed of the vehicles as they leave the spawn . 
  10-20 km/h should be slow enough for people to get out of the way . 
  looks kinda like the illusive man to me . 
  i agree that the handling is pretty damn horrible , but if you treat it as a mobile weapon platform it 's really fun to use . 
  if you have 2,500 auraxium to spare , unlock the 20mm mg and mess around . 
  as long as you use your speed to avoid being on the wrong and of a tank gun and do n't stop close to enemy infantry you can do a surprising amount of damage for a 50 resource vehicle . 
  and here i came to suggest a map with a big mountain in the middle only to find this awesomeness instead . 
  they really should implement a test area like the one in ps1 where you have access to any weapon , vehicle and cert that you want , so you can test items before you buy them . 
  also to practice without risk of being shot at . 
  iirc , we 're supposed to get resources from several continents which is why almost everything in the store costs an arma and a leg . 
  well i think that soon enough the population will become balanced like it did after the recent server wipes ( vs had 50 % for a few days on heres and then it became a fairly even split ) but until then some people are gon na try to get as much auraxium as possible . 
  i am a leaf on the wind , watch how i soar . 
  [ because i can ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujzp9ffpwpm ), 
  i think they should change the model of the entire middle section depending on what you 've specced your sunderer for . 
  teleporter/cloning vat for spawn , big pile of ammo boxes for ammo and a some sort of futuristic repair crane for repairs . 
  just something so we can tell what it does by looking at the silhouette . 
  on a minor unrelated note , i also think they should give us a new utility item for the sunderer that we all start with . 
  if equipped , the passengers should be able to fire out of the sunderer with small arms to turn it into a battlebus . 
  edit : [ here 's a picture ] ( http://www.planetside-universe.com/media/main/wallpapers/wall_official/ams_1600x1200.jpg ) of the old ams to give you an idea of what i mean . 
  well what if that specific utility item reduced the armor of the sunderer when equipped . 
  yeah , maybe reduce it to 6 passengers instead of 9 , still a significant amount of troops but not as much as the normal sundy . 
  you buy them with auraxium . 
  this gave me an idea for a nuclear wasteland continent . 
  lots of ruins and craters + some areas are full of radiation giving you the classic geiger counter noise and filmgrain . 
  could work . 
  i was rather thinking of the aftermath of a short nuclear war between the tr loyalists and the first rebels on one of the continents . 
  tr forces being outnumbered and surrounded decided to use nuclear weapons as a last resort and things kinda escalated . 
  now i imagine [ atlas ] ( http://fc07.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2011/124/7/b/atlas_portal_2_fan_render_by_toughraid3r37890-d3flvnf.jpg ) from portal 2 with a volus instead of personality core . 
  it 's both glorious and horrifying . 
  edit : jongglr8 apparently have similar thoughts . 
  there should be a special place in hell for people like that . 
  well in ps1 there were faction specific buggies + the [ harasser ] ( http://www.planetside-universe.com/media/album/o9uff5kzh/harasser_640x480.jpg ) buggy . 
  nc got the [ enforcer ] ( http://www.planetside-universe.com/media/album/o9uff5kzh/enforcer_640x480.jpg ) buggy and tr got the [ marauder ] ( http://www.planetside-universe.com/media/album/o9uff5kzh/marauder_640x480.jpg ) jeep thingy and vs got the [ thresher ] ( http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb57887/egamia/images/c/c8/planetside_thresher.jpg ) hover thingy . 
  then they all got different versions of the [ deliverer ] ( http://www.planetside-universe.com/media/album/o9uff5kzh/deliverer_640x480.jpg ) medium troop transport but those just had different weapons . 
  / r/ps2outfits, 
  they 've buffed the korgan vanguard . 
  now any kill with biotic charge counts towards your rage . 
  with barrier , rage and biotic charge it 's almost impossible to die . 
  i would say that if you glitch out , you 're guaranteed to die no matter what class you play , how skilled you are , how you are specced or what gear you have . 
  i guess vanguard does n't suit everyone but i would recommend you to give [ this ] ( http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#53laqop[9@0@a@@l4k4@0@0 ) build a try . 
  replacing the standard lightning turret with something like that would be pretty cool . 
  20mm minigun as a sort of all-purpouse weapon with same/similar damage and accuracy as the m20 but with much higher rof . 
   llu runs were great . 
  but again , that 's been done before . 
  i 'd love to see other capture mechanics as well . 
  you hack some sort of console inside the enemy base and then an item or vehicle spawn in the closest large base and has to be brought to the enemy base within a certain timeframe in order to capture it . 
  the enemy ofc will be warned of this and will know the item/vehicles position or at least know were the item/vehicle spawned so they have some idea were it is . 
  if destsroyed the vehicle/item will be spawned again and will keep doing so until you succeed or run out of time . 
  or in other words , it 's kinda like tf2 payload, 
   batarian brawler ( biotic charge , blade armor , lash ), 
  edit : also , still not a single class with defense drone . 
  there should be a class with defense matrix , defense drone and then either a tech ability or a biotic ability depending on if it 's a engineer or sentinel . 
  because lash or charge + batarian melee =  :d, 
  add blade armor and you can just falcon punch yourself to victory . 
  i allready love using the batarian punch but i usually have to rely on staggering my targets with ballistic blades first and then run up and punch them . 
  now i can either lash them over to me or charge over to them . 
  6/6/6 / 5/3 n7 paladin should be pretty damn intresting to use now .
