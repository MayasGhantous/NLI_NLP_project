  * the specialization system . 
  while a pretty good idea on paper , kinda makes this even worse . 
  a character that has ( somehow ) maxed out the specialization system will have a fairly significant advantage over one that just got to lvl 60 . 
  did n't they actually change the entire reputation trait system just to prevent stuff like this ? 
  instead of an old character having a ton of smaller bonuses you got to choose 4 bigger bonuses for space and ground so it would be easier for alts/new players to catch up . 
  the specialization system does n't work like this and right now it takes 60 ( !!!! ), 
  specialization points to max out all 3 spec-trees . 
  tl ; dr : cryptic made sto feel more like a korean grind-fest mmo and made it much harder to have a lot of alts except as a source of dil/ec . 
  i think we have very different opinions on what 's a `` big deal '' . 
  considering how grindy i found just getting to lvl 60 the very thought of getting to `` lvl 110 '' ( or 95 if i skip ground ) with just one character is enough to kinda make me just wan na stop playing sto and go mine asteroids in eve . 
   inb4 they change it so that you pick 4 or 5 perks from the skill tress you invested in . 
  we can bloody hope so . 
  the changeable trait system was imo one of their better ideas . 
  mega grindy power-creep system = bad . 
  personally i think you could basically get rid of everything that 's not a unique/special/hard-to-get item ( ie something you ca n't buy from the exchange ) and the stuff that you actually use . 
  also , imo you should wait with upgrading ** anything ** until much later when you start using fleet/reputation/crafted gear . 
  it 's pretty expensive so do n't bother doing it with stuff you do n't know you 'll use for a long time . 
  the older ships can actually be kinda useful as storage for ship equipment so unless you need the ship slots you could just keep them . 
  it can also be kinda fun later on to bring them out of storage to see how they look with different reputation shields . 
  btw , while maybe not so relevant , could you post a screenshot of your ship loadout ? 
  i 've just found that new players sometimes ( very often ) could use some advice when it comes to stuff like that . 
  i 'm actually wondering about that myself . 
  from the sto wiki, 
   [ amp ] +3.3 % ** all damage ** for each sub-system with 75 or more power, 
  as long as you have at least 3 subsystems at more than 75 power ( which should n't be hard ) the amp bonus should be equal or superior to the obelisk 2p bonus . 
  i guess it could also depend on which damage bonus category they belong to . 
  and at least personally i would consider bonuses like, 
   +10 % to base resistance rate of all power level, 
   +66 % to base regeneration rate of all power levels, 
  to be superior to the obelisk core bonuses unless you really want that extra aux power . 
  and while the obelisk core does have the advantage of being fee i get the feeling that op does n't really have any problem with the cost of his gear . 
  btw , an interesting part from the patchnotes, 
   omni-directional antiproton beam array from the mission reward for `` sphere of influence '' : renamed to `` ancient omni-directional beam array '' to reduce confusion between this and the similarly-named crafted beam arrays . 
   this mission reward no longer shares a equip limit category with the crafted beam arrays , allowing both to be placed on any ship simultaneously . 
  this means you can have ** two ** ap omni-beams in the aft if you 're willing to spend the ec ( which i get the feeling you are ) on a crafted omni-beam . 
  it 's been a while so i might be wrong , but iirc , back when we did n't have cruiser commands and other power drain reduction bonuses , having more than 6 beam arrays did n't really help much because of the extra power drain . 
  i even remember some people saying they were getting lower dps when using 7 or 8 beam arrays . 
  as a result , 3 beams and 1 torp in both fore and aft was usually considered the optimal standard cruiser build . 
  now that we have cruiser commands , plasma-integrated war cores , plasmonic leech for fed characters , etc etc the drain is n't that much of a problem anymore so 7 beams and a kcb is basically the new standard . 
   ** category 1 **, 
  well that certainly makes [ amp ] a lot less useful than it sounds like from the description . 
  i always kinda assumed it would be cat 2 or something . 
  the amp bonus is apparently a category 1 bonus which makes it kinda useless . 
  personally i think they should start as stations but if they get a steady trade partner and survive long enough they should eventually be able to turn into something like a city state . 
  imo they should also have some territory ( 1 tile radius ) and maybe 1-2 units as stations but not much else . 
  i also think they should be vulnerable to aliens ( even when they 're green ) so if you want a future cs buddy then you might have to defend your neighboring station for a while . 
  improvements with maintenance cost . 
  imo a pretty nice way to add really powerful improvements while still keeping them somewhat balanced . 
  the `` quest '' ( if you can call them that ) system that lets us customize our factions even further . 
  could use some balancing though but i really like the idea . 
  i kinda like the aliens in theory . 
  they 're a bit too passive right now ( could n't make them hostile even when i tried ) but once they work the way i think they 're supposed to work they should be a lot more fun than the old barbarians . 
  i actually want the barbarians in civ vi ( whenever that 's released ) to be more like them . 
  lets say that instead of just having one big angry barbarian faction you have several different `` tribes '' that can be neutral , hostile or friendly ( to both different civs and different tribes ) depending on how they 're treated . 
  and instead of city states being there from the start , tribes could eventually evolve into them . 
  later on they could be replaced by rebel groups that could be similar . 
  imagine just sitting there and aiding some different rebel groups that are hostile to some civ you do n't like , sending them gold so they could spawn more units or something  :3, 
  ok , good thing i asked because ( no offense ) that build is pretty shitty . 
  but that 's ok because you 're new . 
  i recommend you to visit / r/stobuilds but i 'll give you some advice as well . 
  1 : do n't mix damage types . 
  choose one and get the appropriate damage consoles . 
  you would be better off using common mk ix weapons as long as they 're the same damage type . 
  2 : replace the beam arrays with turrets . 
  that way your aft weapons can also hit things in front of you . 
  3 : do n't put universal consoles in the tactical console slots . 
  dps is too important to waste a tac console slot like that . 
  4 : avoid chroniton torpedos . 
  they 're pretty much the shittiest type of torps in sto . 
  tbh you should probably skip the torpedo completely . 
  when it comes to your bridge officer loadout, 
  1 : get 2x tactical team 1 , it 's pretty much the best ensign tanking ability i the game and basically mandatory . 
  2 : get cannon scatter volley for doing a lot of damage to anything in front of you . 
  3 : you should probably put an engineer in the universal station . 
  having another emergency power to shields would be really useful . 
  4 : you want/need hazard emitters for your sci boff . 
  it removes so many unpleasant things like plasma dot and it 's a pretty nice heal . 
  an upgrade tree for the damn explorer . 
  at tier 2 it should get some extra combat strength and something like some bonuses for detecting ruins/crashed satellites/etc , resource pods and maybe even resources you do n't have the technology to see yet . 
  at tier 3 and 4 it should turn into something more like a military recon/commando unit that could have bonuses like the ability to hide in rough terrain and pillaging tiles with no movement cost . 
  i also think the standard explorer could use a combat strength buff and that the lvl 1 purity bonus should be something like + x % when defending against aliens . 
  other unit ideas, 
  * bomber : the good old anti-ground/city aircraft . 
  maybe the t3/4 harmony bomber could have the ability to drop miasma bombs !, 
  * vtol gunship : fast glass-cannon unit that can move over impassable terrain . 
  * combat engineers : infantry unit with some of the capabilities of workers , like remove miasma and build roads . 
  could possibly get some special affinity related defensive improvement later on . 
  or maybe this could just be an ability for the soldier you unlock with some tech or virtue . 
  * command unit : like a great general but with some combat strength and later on some more interesting affinity related bonuses instead of just +15 % strength . 
  are there any biomes with a lower % of flying animals ? 
  i 've been messing around with hunting + leather and bone industries lately and i 'm getting a bit annoyed at how hard it is to kill birds . 
  since new animals do n't really spawn until the current animals die or leave this can be pretty annoying . 
  my guess is that the delta rep system was designed just as all the others since they all worked fine before dr. 
  the morons who fucked up the advanced queues probably never even thought about the fact that it would now be really annoying to get the ancient power cells . 
  tbh i doubt they 're even capable of any higher thought processes like that . 
  personally i 'm just gon na do a few normal queues once in a while to get enough marks for the 20h thing and then play something else while i wait for cryptic to cave in to the rage/lack of players and undo the shit they did to all the advanced queues . 
  it did help but personally i 'm not really satisfied until they 're back to pre-dr levels . 
  i would consider myself to be a fairly high dps player ( 27 % crit chance and 6 [ crtd ] x3 ap beam arrays ) but i still find the advanced queues to be too damn tedious to be worth it . 
  and yes there are other problems they should fix but first i would like them to make combat fun again . 
  yeah the reward nerf should also be undone .
