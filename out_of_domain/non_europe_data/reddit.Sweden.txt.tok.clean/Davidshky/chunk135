  i think the assimilated set would probably look better if the shield effect covered a larger area of the ship instead of just some random spots here and there . 
  give the whole ship a borg-like texture or something . 
  imo the only ships that actually look good with it are the tal shiar adapted ships and that 's kinda because they 're 50 % borg to begin with . 
  something i really dislike though is people who do n't disable the visuals on the damn borg console when they 're using some other shields , deflectors etc. 
  it looks like the ship is infected with some ugly parasites . 
  it 's a good thing we can just disable the visual effects cause otherwise i 'm not sure i would be willing to use that console . 
   well well well what do we have here . 
   oh thats right . 
  in your faces you apologists !, 
   i told you they should have added delta marks just for sheer consistency . 
  but oh nooo im just asking things for free . 
  did n't they say that it was a bug and that we were supposed to be able to claim delta marks from the start ? 
  am i the only one who actually like the jupiter , or at least the basic design ( the model is kinda old ) ? 
  a higher-def model and texture and maybe a slightly wider belly and it would be the perfect fed carrier with frigate pets . 
  looks like a good build , but why flow-cap consoles ? 
  well if you 're a romulan with sro boffs then you should already have a fairly high crit chance so getting [ crtd ] weapons first would probably be better . 
  it 's not over until you 've maxed out the specialization system , which is the equivalent of another 50 levels per character . 
  what i want is a sort of spiritual successor of the miranda . 
  not a refit or retrofit but simply a new shiny cruiser with the same basic design ( nacelles under the saucer etc ) . 
  like a sort of t6 `` advanced light cruiser '' that 's fairly agile , can use dual cannons and have a versatile boff layout like commander engineering , lt com science , lt com tactical and lt + ensign universal . 
  now that i think of it this would kinda be like the bastard offspring of the eclipse and guardian cruisers but i think i 'm ok with that . 
   bleth choas fighter, 
   plesh brek frigate, 
  it 's basically 99 % confirmed that we 're getting a breen carrier with frigate pets . 
  also , unless they give us a dreadnought , a fighter or make something new , the carrier is the only breen ship left so it 's been like 75-90 % certain we would get it since last winter . 
  tbh , the only reason to open lockboxes is to get lobi crystals or other account bound items or if you simply like to gamble . 
  for everything else , sell the keys for ec and then buy what you actually want . 
  i mean , the drop chance of the lockbox ships is 0,5 % . 
  this means that on average it will take 200 keys to get the grand price and iirc , keys sell for 2 + mil ec on the exchange . 
  so on average , each lockbox ship takes around 400-500 mil ec worth of keys to acquire . 
  that 's up to you to decide . 
  the 11th console , boff and console layouts and their special consoles/abilities/etc make most of them both perfectly viable and pretty different compared to the current z-store t6 ships . 
  like the recluse with a whole whooping ** commander ** universal station and some of the best carrier pets in the game or the adapted battlecruiser that also has a comm uni station and mother fucking sensor analysis . 
  lockbox ships also give you access to stuff that your characters faction might not have , like 2-hangar carriers with frigate pets , decent science vessels or ships with warp cores . 
  / r/stobuilds would probably be a better place to ask that question though it should be enough for a decent basic beam-build . 
  also , i would recommend the [ nacine dreadnought ] ( http://sto.gamepedia.com/xindi-aquatic_narcine_dreadnought_carrier ) instead of the jhdc since it does n't require you to own a 500 + mil ec ship to get the frigate pets . 
  unless you plan on actually opening them , yeah . 
  personally i just discard them as soon as i notice them piling up in my inventory . 
  uhm no , it 's 200 keys on average . 
  that does n't mean that opening 200 boxes = 100 % chance of getting a ship . 
  it can take 1 or 1000 but the average is 200 . 
  well yeah , but on average it takes 200 tires in the same way that on average it takes 2 tries to get tails in heads or tails ( if you pretend it 's an exact 50/50 chance and ignore stuff like the coin landing on the side etc etc ) even though the chance of getting tails in 2 tries is 75 % . 
   winter ** 2015 **, 
  well yeah , the chance of getting a ship is 1 - ( 0,995 ^ ( amount of boxes opened ) ) so there 's always a small chance that rngesus hates you , but on average it still takes 200 tries . 
  what i want is breen kit modules . 
  cryo mortars for engineers , cryo grenades for tacs and ... cryo spray/blast for sci . 
  future reputation system maybe ? 
  like after they 've added the cardassians as a playable faction and a dominion rep system , the breen ally with the dominion again and we 'll get some breen episodes and queues and new special gear . 
  i want the [ run ] modifier ( +20 % run speed ) that we were supposed to be able to get when crafting ground weapons . 
  i mean , you want to get close with a shotgun so [ run ] ( or [ run ] x3 ) would be pretty nice to have . 
   i just want to be able to outlast my enemies, 
  you 're an engineer , you could outlast the npcs in almost anything . 
   i ca n't imagine that being useful for ground infantry, 
  i 'm 99 % sure it is in no way meant to be used by ground infantry . 
  well imo the question is what else do you want than survivability ? 
  dps ? 
  science ? 
  a hangar bay ? 
  what about the [ tal shiar adapted battle cruiser ] ( http://sto.gamepedia.com/tal_shiar_adapted_battle_cruiser ) ? 
  * like every t5 + cruiser it can tank like a champ, 
  * it has a versatile boff layout with both a universal commander and ensign station, 
  * an lt com science seat that enables you to use gravity well . 
  * 4 sci console slots ( with the free t5u upgrade ) to put universal consoles in , or actual sci consoles if you 're into that . 
  * it has sensor analysis which can boost your single target damage by a ton . 
  * aaaand it 's one of the few ships that does n't look like shit in the borg set . 
  do n't mix dbbs and beam arrays like that . 
  focus on either broadsiding or frontal firepower . 
   ss uniforms, 
  the secret service could use a new name with a different acronym . 
  well they could at least use a different acronym , like usss or secse ( pronounced sexy ) . 
  kos was gon na be my answer as well . 
  had i not been such a fan of scifi i would have dropped it after the first 2 episodes but after episode 4 and that evasive maneuver scene i was sold . 
  i ended up reading and preferring the manga but the anime still has a special place in my heart just for the sound effects . 
  some warning though , make sure you have enough armor for your militia before you do this , or at least add some normal shirts , pants and shoes to their uniform . 
  otherwise they 'll get unhappy from being uncovered . 
  the cc weapon/console set has 2 consoles , 1 universal from the rep grind and 1 tactical that you get from an episode . 
  i honestly do n't know what to say except that this was one of the best anime episodes i 've seen this year . 
  need moar now !, 
  [ and this fucking punch !, 
   ** could n't ** care less, 
  ftfy, 
  i 'm pretty fond of the vaadwaur tricobalt cluster torpedo . 
  when me and my friends were grinding the japori system patrol i noticed how effective the vaadwaur torp could be at times and tried it out myself . 
  eventually , me and a friend were both using a silly little makeshift loadout for our t6 raptors , with the vaadwaur torp in the front , a tricobalt mine in the aft and dispersal pattern beta 3 as the commander tac ability . 
  basically we would fire the torps , use evasive maneuvers to fly past them , drop a bunch of mines in the enemy group and then try to gtfo before everything blew up . 
  it was especially effective when another friend would use gravity well first so that everything was grouped together when we did our bombing runs . 
  grind specialization points . 
  each tree has a ship trait you get after spending a certain amount of spec points . 
   520,000 specialization points, 
  do you mean skill points cause you only need 15 spec points for the pilot and commando traits and then ... some more points for the intelligence trait . 
  but yeah , not really worth grinding for until cryptic caves in some more and increase the amount of skillpoints we get , or realize that the specialization system is a bad idea and change it like they did with the reputation trait system . 
  crafting mk ii gear and then upgrading those with good modifiers is the way to go . 
  that way you only invest a lot of ec/dil after you get lucky with the crafting-rngesus . 
  iirc , it 's also easier to increase the rarity when upgrading a low mk item . 
  and since it only cost 75 dil to instantly finish the crating of mk ii items it can actually be worth it to spend a few thousand dil to quickly craft a lot on mk ii items . 
  i would be happy if we could just do this with our smallcrafts . 
  let a boff fly around in it , using whatever equipment you put on it and maybe more than just the ensign ability ( since a player in a shuttle/fighter can use all his/her captain abilities ) .
