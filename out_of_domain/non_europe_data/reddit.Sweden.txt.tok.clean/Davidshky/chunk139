  except for some torpedo and/or exotic-damage focused builds , always keep your weapon power at max . 
  go into the custom power level settings ( the 3 over your weapon power display ) , choose the weapon power setting , pull the weapon bar to the max , lock it , then put all your remaining power in aux and save the setting . 
  then switch to the balanced power setting and do the same except with max aux and the rest in weapons . 
  the weapon power setting should now give you something like 110-125 weapon power and 100 aux power and the balanced/aux power setting the reverse . 
  yeah i forgot that it 's a romulan ship ( iirc -10 power to each subsystem ) and that you do n't really have any of the universal reputation consoles and other gear that give power bonuses . 
  your skills might also be a factor since some of them affect your subsystem power levels . 
  fortunately the consoles are kinda easy to get . 
  iirc they usually require tier 1 or tier 2 reputation which takes 2 or 6 days to reach and with the current 50 % mark bonus + the 55 mark daily bonus it should n't be that hard to get them as long as you have some dilithium . 
  i would also recommend getting the romulan prototype plasma beam array if you 're gon na use plasma weapons and probably the borg kinetic cutting beam . 
  the prototype beam does n't use any weapon power and the 2-piece set bonus with the console gives you a 7,6 % plasma damage bonus . 
  the kcb does fairly high dps against non-shielded targets and the 2 piece bonus with the console is a 2,5 % chance for each hit with an energy weapon to get +10 weapon power and a power-drain resistance bonus . 
  check the wiki guide on [ ship gear ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/stobuilds/wiki/build_anatomy/ship_gear ) to find more stuff you might want . 
  i think he 's talking about automated workers who will run around and remove it even if you 're like tier 14 harmony . 
  not really sure if this counts ( since it 's more like a matter of personal preference than stupidity ) but i used to be a bit of a purist using nothing more than a graphic pack and the basic settings like disabling aquifers and auto-saves . 
  nowadays i ca n't imagine playing df without dwarf therapist , workflow and the minor stuff that dfhack adds like search functions , box-build , planning mode , using prospect in the world map to make sure that marble is n't the only flux etc etc. 
  also , editing the announcement file to disable pausing for cave-ins , babies being born and other annoying minor announcements . 
  i honestly do n't know how i did n't go insane playing df without this . 
  personally i think you should wait with spending money on a ship , even if it means you miss this sale ( there will be more ) . 
  it 's better to spend 2500 zen on a ship you know you want than 2000 on something that might just end up collecting dust . 
  and as syanda said , head over to / r/stobuild and get some advice on how to properly use the ship you have first . 
  a decent build is worth far more than an extra console slot and some special console/weapon/ability . 
  then i would recommend you to buy some mirror universe ships from the exchange to try using a t5 escort and science vessel . 
  you might end up preferring those over cruisers . 
   i mean , my ship is so bad it could barely limp its way through the delta quadrant campaign on ** advanced ** ... 
  that does n't really say much since cryptic kinda messed around the the hp of enemies on advanced and elite . 
  when it comes to your build , first of all , start grinding towards getting some of the reputation universal consoles to put in your engineering and sci slots . 
  pretty much all of them are worth using and they 're waaay better than some shitty neutronium alloys or field generator . 
  replace bo3 with faw3 or apo1 or apb2 . 
  bo is n't really worth it for most normal builds . 
   because i heard something somewhere about aux2bat being good . 
  a2b is really really good ** if ** ( !!! ), 
  you have 2 copies and a bunch of rare or very rare technician doffs . 
  check the wiki in the sidebar for a2b builds . 
  it could have been made using one of those materials or something similar . 
  the galaxy-x dreadnought can get some pretty respectable firepower , has a giant phaser lance ability and a fighter hangar . 
  i wish they would go back to red and green again , but with the swords this time . 
  or maybe they 're saving that for the next event in time for the release of episode vii . 
  just checked [ a screenshot ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wqw6cab.jpg ) here and this does seem to be correct . 
  stuff like engineering team and emergency power to weapons have up-arrows , jam sensors has a down-arrow and the disruptor aoe ability thingy has an x. 
  edit : checked [ another screenshot ] ( https://i.imgur.com/c2g5hnf.png ) and it seems there are also + signs for some healing abilities . 
  hazard emitters also have the plus sign so i think it 's more like heals without buffs . 
  imo 1 vr and 2 rare technicians is good enough . 
  the difference between 26 % and 30 % cd reduction is n't really noticeable when you use a2b every 10 seconds . 
  the difference between a 30 % and 26 % cd reduction for a 30s cd ability like tt1 is only 1,2 seconds . 
  so if you already have blue technicians then i think it would be better to spend your ec on other stuff . 
  somewhat related question , does anyone know if the starship traits work for small craft ? 
  as the others have pointed out , it 's a compound word of 4 different words . 
  basically german and many other languages pretty much allow you to macgyver together as many words as you like to create some very long and specific name/description/etc . 
  as long as you know the individual words you should know what the compound word means , even if you ca n't even find it in a dictionary . 
  sweden does use the l96a1 aw ( we call it psg 90 or prickskyttegev\u00e4r 90 ) so you 're probably correct . 
  personally i would either remove the bo3 or one of the attack patterns to fit a second copy of csv . 
  since most of your weapons are cannons you should probably try to maximize their efficiency . 
  basically something like this . 
  ** commander tac **, 
  apb has a shorter cd than apo so having 2 copies should let you cycle it every 15 seconds . 
  tractor beam repulsor + the doff that makes it pull stuff towards you + eject warp plasma ( or similar ability like the meteron gas ) and/or photonic shockwave can be a kinda interesting combo in pve . 
  ewp is usually a pretty shitty ability but when you have the ability to tow a few enemies behind you through the plasma cloud it 's actually kinda hilarious . 
  imo it 's a good idea to have both faw and ss for intel beamboats and simply use whichever is best for the current situation . 
  apparently it 's a [ pvpjtgb 1111 ] ( http://uploads.ifokus.se/uploads/270/2707ddfc74aa393006bfc47a68dd3d25/img-9762.jpg ) with an rbs 56 atgm . 
  yeah but it does n't look as hilarious as a bunch of ships being dragged through a cloud of plasma/farts/explosions by a facr . 
  you need more than one copy of a2b even with 3x purple technicians . 
  the only builds with 1x a2b are some strange ( ish ) builds that have limited engineering capabilities , need aux power or have other ways to reduce cd and only need some extra cd reduction once in a while . 
  i do n't really think it 's an fsv . 
  i kinda get the feeling op just made that part up since he did n't really know what it was . 
  because scandinavia need more than just top tier +100 pt late-90s prototype units . 
  there are plenty of holes in the unit rosters that need to be filled , including some cheaper shittier units . 
  depending on the stats , cost and availability this thing could turn out to be an awesome cost efficient little ambush vehicle . 
  maybe you could get the [ bioneural gel-pack ] ( http://sto.gamepedia.com/delta_alliance_ordnance ) console . 
  it reduces the cd of all boff abilities by 7 % and gives you 2 power to each subsystem . 
  i 'm getting kinda tempted to get a bunch of beam arrays with [ over ] just to mess around a bit , possibly with a ship with limited tac ability slots . 
  with 8 arrays you should have a 19 % ( 1-0 ,975 \\ ^ 8 ) chance to proc at least one bo1 each cycle so it should happen somewhat frequently . 
  cost 10 points and does n't even get an mg . 
  the 20pt polish mi-2 / 4 with some mgs and a 23mm autocannon . 
  is it actually useful for anything except finding enemy aa ? 
  the brits fucking buffalo transport or whatever it 's called : it 's just soooooooo slooooooooow . 
  like 35 km/h offroad speed ... 
  all of the bmp-1 transports except the 1d . 
  the 73mm gun is just so shitty and the atgms are n't really good enough to make up for the cost . 
  any commonwealth unit using those `` atgms '' with 30-35 % accuracy , like the canadian at-helicopter or those silly little cars . 
  tbh , leveling up a character to lvl 50 is ( or at least was ) easy as fuck . 
  back when we had the good old daily mirror universe event you could gain several levels in an hour , which is what i did with my alts when the event popped up . 
  you can also pretty much reach lvl 50 in one or two day during a double-xp weekend event . 
  i even have some contraband-farming alts that have reached lvl 40-50 + from basically just doing marauding assignments . 
  and this is one of the things i liked about sto , how easy it was to level up . 
  ** add : ** a sort of nursery/daycare/school zone where the babies and children can be dumped and taken care of by dwarves with a certain childcare labor . 
  childcaredwarves should also be able to teach the children different skills , depending on their own skills and the teaching skill . 
  ** tweak : ** the undead ( from necro towers and evil biomes ) . 
  imo they 're way too damn strong for a bunch of rotting corpses . 
  ** remove : ** miserable dwarves from abandoned fortresses still being miserable when they arrive as migrants to your new fort . 
  ca n't they cheer up a bit during the trip or at least go insane and die . 
  i remember one time when i locked the gate as the second wave of migrants arrived ( wanted to wait until they became a bit happier before letting them in ) . 
  one miner instantly had a tantrum and killed 5 other migrants . 
  this caused one dwarf from the first wave inside the fortress to go from happy to miserable ( he knew some of the victims ) , tantrum and destroy the fucking gate . 
  one of the new migrants then killed my expedition leader and the rest was like 28 days later . 
  personally i think it should simply get a price reduction to 5 points . 
  this gave me a stupid idea . 
  gold ship materials that you unlock by filling your ship with epic items . 
  is that the dauntless starship trait , cause then the answer is yes and it 's pretty neat for any ship with a hangar . 
  that gif was one of the reasons i watched it and [ this gif ] ( http://www.gfycat.com/weeklyflimsybumblebee ) ( spoiler warning ) should be enough to make people watch the latest ova . 
  ofc they can get lucky once in a while .
