  depends on the core . 
  the breen core for example does apparently get [ eas ] which is a 1 % chance to get +10 aux power when you 're hit by an energy weapon . 
  i think someone posted a list of all the ur upgrades of rep items and stuff like that either here on / r/sto or over at / r/stobuilds quite recently . 
  fyi , that does n't make me hate you any less , you rich and lucky bastard . 
  though tbh , the reason i have both the monbosh and the s'golth is because i got two s ` golths and then bought the bosh by selling one of them . 
  contribute to the `` reunite davidshky 's monbosh and s'golth with their long lost family member foundation '', 
  yeah bug hunt is even puggable on elite since it 's so straight forward and the `` optional '' objectives are pretty easy . 
  as already mentioned , you want an armor with high toxic and physical resist ( but especially toxic ) and an aoe weapon . 
  personally i would recommend the cc armor + the free cc [ will ] x3 kit from surface tension ( for the 2p set bonus and to resist the hold from the flying bastards ) + a phaser or disruptor pulsewave assault weapon + something with longer range . 
  when it comes to kit modules these are the ones i 've liked using, 
  * chroniton mine barrier : probably the best ability for this since you 'll get assaulted by swarms of melee enemies that can pop up from nowhere . 
  * medical generator : you need to hold position quite often so this will be really helpful for your whole team . 
  * quantum mortar : more glorious aoe damage . 
  the delay is n't that bad since the bugs kinda tend to stay in your face . 
  * embassy flamethrower turret : usually i 'm not that fond of turrets but the cone aoe attack at short range this thing has makes it pretty useful vs the bugs . 
  * shield pulse or whatever it 's called : an aoe shield heal ability that can be a real life saver for your team . 
  it 's also totally worth it to play surface tension one more time and get the ground trait . 
  it gives you a toxic resist bonus but most importantly has a 10 % chance to remove toxic dots every time you take toxic damage . 
  this is a reply to some deleted comment, 
  the damage bonus calculations in sto are pretty strange . 
  basically we have damage bonus `` categories '' that work kinda like this . 
  all bonuses in the same category is stacked additively . 
  ie , two 25 % bonus consoles + a 10 % set bonus = 60 % bonus . 
  the categories are then stacked multiplicatively . 
  ie , if you have 60 % bonus in category 1 , 25 % in category 2 and 5 % in category 3 it will be calculated as 1,6 * 1,25 * 1,05 = 2,1 = 110 % damage bonus . 
  [ here ] ( http://sto-forum.perfectworld.com/showpost.php?p=15821071&amp;postcount=4 ) is a list of which bonus fall into which category . 
  as you can see , tac consoles are category 1 together with a lot of other bonuses which is why they in the end do n't provide as much of a bonus as you might think . 
  in the list of bonuses i linked , rarity/quality and mark is in the list of category 1 bonuses and iirc i 've read discussions about how damage bonuses are kinda calculated with a sort of `` common mk 0 '' weapon . 
  see the part about standard issue damage values . 
  iirc that 's what some people call `` mk 0 '' . 
  basically it works something like this . 
  the `` mk 0 '' base weapon does 100 dps ( cause i 'm lazy ) and you add two 30 % tac console ( no other bonuses ) which now gives you 160 dps . 
  at mk x that weapon should do 200 dps . 
  the thing is that this is because the mk x = a 100 % damage bonus . 
  now this bonus is stacked ** additively ** to all the other cat 1 bonuses ( in this case the 2x tac consoles ) , giving you 100 dps + 160 % ( 260 dps ) and not 200 dps + 60 % ( 320 dps ) . 
  so even at mk v , viii or xiv , a 30 % tac console would give the same bonus in dps because it 's only boosting that mk 0 number . 
  tbh , what gear you want really depends on which queues/missions/etc you plan on running . 
  for example in bug hunt the sonic pulse ability is incredibly useful , especially with the 6s root doff , but otherwise its kinda meh ( unless you like melee ) . 
  one thing i would recommend is looking into expose bonuses from traits and gear . 
  a lot of the offensive sci abilities are expose abilities which can greatly increase the damage output of you and your teammates . 
  for example the xindi kits can have a [ exphit ] mod that will increase your expose chance by around 12 % . 
  edit : if you 're gon na do some ground stfs and do n't have the tr-116b or the shotgun , a medic kit and a sword ( 1h sword , not lirpa or bat ` leth ) can be pretty awesome . 
  run up and stab the borg to death while spamming heals and the melee damage bonus thing . 
  re-modulating weapons is for plebs . 
   gear/doff/trait synergies, 
  aight , everything that gives expose chance bonuses + expose abilities ( most of the damage and debuff abilities ) + weapon with exploit secondary attack . 
  the traits lucky and telepathic both give expose chance bonuses . 
  aliens , betazoids , ferasans and letheans are the only races that can have both those traits ( if we count those that have them included in their racial trait ) which gives them an advantage for these builds . 
  then there 's the pack leader trait you can get from the exchange which gives you and your teammates a 10 % expose chance bonus . 
  i have an alien character that by combining these traits and a [ exphit ] kit has a 58 % chance to expose stuff with her expose abilities . 
  i could increase it by another 5 % with some armors but they 're not that good or too expensive . 
  the dyson rifle is pretty awesome for this because the main attack will have half your normal chance to expose and when your target is exposed the secondary will change from the normal wide-beam expose attack to a sniper rifle exploit attack , enabling you to do ridiculous amounts of damage at times . 
  the cc rifles work in a similar way though they have a different secondary attack . 
  the delta rep rifle does have a expose main attack but from my own experience it does n't get any bonuses from my traits and gear like the dyson and cc rifles . 
  melee weapons can also work and they do n't even get the 50 % expose chance reduction so you could have a whole whooping 58 % chance to expose your enemy with each strike . 
  honestly , expose stuff is awesome because exploit attacks get a 200 % ( or more ) damage bonus against exposed enemies . 
  works really well with pretty much any offensive sci build and will help your whole team . 
   why the sword ? 
  swords have a longer `` charge range '' or whatever you should call it . 
  basically , when you get within x meters of your target you will charge forwards , even defying the laws of gravity if you have to . 
  so with a sword you can fly around like a mass effect vanguard with a machete but with a bat ` leth or lirpa you must walk up to your target to stab them . 
  my suggestion would be any escort-type ship with an lt. com science/universal station so you can use gravity well 1 to cluster your targets together . 
  the kazon raider is afaik pretty cheap so you could buy that one to mess around with . 
  it has an lt. com and 2x lt. universal stations so you can build it in many different ways . 
  also consider using a tricobalt mine launcher in combination with the cluster torp . 
  me and a friend did this for shits and giggles and if you launch the cluster torp at a distance and then use evasive maneuver or some other speed boost ability you can reach your target before the torp and drop some mines on them for the biggest explosion you 've ever seen in sto . 
  the exchange, 
  nah , afaik only the ships with 2 hangars really count as proper carriers . 
  op simply listed all the different types of ships with hangars . 
  only if he really likes the ship . 
  the only reason i really suggested it is because it 's cheap , tac-focused and can use gw1 . 
  that way he would n't have to invest too much ec/zen/dilithium to find out how viable his build idea is . 
  o ___ o, 
  now i need to know if this applies to the bop and fer ` jai frigates hyt and the obelisk swarmers bo . 
  could someone find out for me while i 'm stuck at work ? 
  hardly the best unit but i have a soft spot for the fjb-40 . 
  fairly cheap , decent availability and access to some nice transports . 
  can kinda replace both your line infantry and manpad squads which makes them even more cost efficient . 
  on the second high res picture it kinda looks like a wheeled vehicle to me . 
  a wheeled vehicle with a really big gun . 
  some sort of fsv or recon unit like the zhalo or the french car-tank thingy ? 
  edit : looks like i was correct . 
  vickers mk 11 , a wheeled fsv with a 105 mm gun for anzac . 
  the one we 're getting will be an fsv though so no transport capabilities . 
  they 've already said no . 
  it 's apparently gon na be an fsv to keep the cost down . 
  if you have fleet credits all you really need is an invite to the appropriate fleet holding to buy stuff like fleet singularity cores . 
  there 's a channel called nop public service or something like that that 's made for getting invites and stuff . 
  no need to join a fleet , just get into their holding and buy what you need . 
  spaag = self-propelled anti-aircraft gun . 
  the naval version can apparently even shoot down anti-ship missiles and they recently developed guided shells for even better aa capabilities . 
  make a room with a small-ish platform surrounded by magma , drop the prisoners on the platform and then drop rocks and stuff into the magma to incinerate the prisoners ( + their corpses and their non-metal items ) with clouds of magma mist . 
   but that 's not how the game should be balanced . 
  indeed , each unit should imo be worth the points they cost , regardless of what transports they might be able to use or what other units the faction has . 
  i 'm ok with stuff like the us having shit infantry in exchange for a lot of other awesome units , as long as their shitty infantry are priced accordingly . 
  i really really wish they would just stop with this whole `` increments of 5 '' shenanigans when it comes to unit costs , at least for stuff that cost 30 points or less . 
  i just looked it up and how the fuck have i missed this thing ? 
  and it 's only 30 lobi crystals !, 
  qib/eclipse + ss2/3 + a2b build is one of my new favorite builds . 
  i can have tt1 , faw2 and apb2 in the lt. com tac station and spam lasers like a normal beamboat until i want/need to really murder a specific target and use ss instead .
