  cheap , fast and really effective against infantry in the right situation . 
  transport with an aa gun . 
  yes it sucks but it 's cheap and it 's a transport so it can kinda save you some activation points when making your deck . 
  kinda wondering about this myself . 
  recently specced one of my marauding alts as a tac buffer and i 'm not sure if i 'm doing something wrong or if it 's simply not that useful . 
  my biggest issue though is probably the lack of doffs for most of the team buff abilities . 
  from what i could see on the wiki only rally cry and overwatch had some related doffs and the very rare rc doff has a 8 % proc chance ... 
  most of the self-buffs and offensive abilities had some useful doffs ( melee had a lot ) but that 's not very useful for this kind of build . 
  well now i know what i 'll be doing to the karlings when i get home . 
   cause personally i kinda like ** having both ** faw and ss, 
  like [ this ] ( http://skillplanner.stoacademy.com/?build=asasfasfafasfa_0 ), 
   to unlock the recipe for crafting a specialization manual players must have spent 10 skill points within the desired specialization . 
  to unlock the additional higher ranking ability recipes , players must spend around 20 skill points within the desired specialization . 
  well even if i use locators and build around using faw , ss should still be better against single targets as long as i have decent crit severity . 
  when playing as ragnar lodbrok i seduced pretty much every pagan woman with a good genetic trait and filled the world with legitimized bastards . 
  my entire family hated me and my dynasty became an insane clusterfuck . 
  later on i also turned my tribal scandinavian empire into a trade republic just to find out what would happen . 
  first of all replace the dce doffs since a2b makes them useless . 
  then i would recommend something like this for your boff layout . 
  ** ensign universal **, 
  tt1 , faw2 , apb2 or tt1 , apb1 , faw3, 
  ** comm engineering **, 
  ** lt eng/intel **, 
  oss1 , eptw3 and dem3 should give you some pretty respectable firepower , gw1 is almost a must have for ships with lt com sci stations and it should be pretty damn tanky with et , epts , he and st. 
  and as others have already mentioned , try to get more [ crtd ] weapons . 
  also , replace the ancient anti-proton omni-beam with another plasma beam array . 
  not really sure . 
  i took a break from that game after my character died and my heir was like 6 years old . 
  what i do know is that the ai in charge granted independence to norway a few years after i lost control of the empire . 
  i did n't mean ducttaping some missiles to the turret . 
  what i meant is that designing an ifv or upgrading an old one with decent optics and an atgm would be a lot easier than making a vehicle that can engage armored vehicles with its main gun while still being able to transport infantry . 
  the bradley , marder , bmp-2 etc etc are imo proof enough that this solution works . 
  also , are you sure that the problem was n't the atgms themselves rather than the difficulty of adding them to the ifvs ? 
  probably stuff like my nk mechanized deck that spammed the vtt-323 apc that has aa-missiles . 
  they 're not that good and kinda expensive but when you have like 20 + of those bastards any blufor plane that comes too close is fucked . 
  i did that on gjoll once and spammed like 20 squads of rifle infantry into the central mountain and then just sat there laughing when they tried to counter my infantry swarm with bombers . 
  i do n't want each faction to get identical copies but i do want them to have at least some equivalent stuff . 
  like the feds getting an engineering focused carrier with `` sciency '' beamboat frigate pets . 
  it would n't be very similar to the vo ` quv or doom-cathedral but it would give the feds a frigate carrier . 
   can utilize two antiproton 360 beam arrays, 
  one thing i want to know is if these are actually worth using over a [ crtd ] x3-4 beam array . 
  join the nop public service chat channel and ask for a starbase invite . 
  that channel exist purely to give invites to fleet holdings and tuffli/suliban ships for free . 
  afaik there 's no need to join any fleets or contribute anything as long as you 've earned the fleet credits somewhere . 
  damn those tier 1 ground traits actually look pretty damn nice . 
  with 5 stacks you 'd get +50 % runspeed , +10 % expose chance , +10 s expose duration , -37,5 % incoming flanking damage and +100 % exploit damage ( i assume % ) . 
  now if they would just give us enough skillpoints to actually get these traits ... 
   all it takes is ** time **, 
  a lot of time , at least too much for me to really wan na invest in ground traits . 
  though i guess i could turn one or two of my marauding alts into dedicated ground characters - by lvl 60 they could have 5 points in command and 5 points in commando . 
  i know some people like that but one got banned because his no-lifing was mistaken for botting and the others mostly started playing other games after dr was released because even they could n't really stand it . 
  there 's a difference between taking time and taking an insane amount of time . 
  it takes around 150k skillpoints to get a specialization point . 
  argala is one of the most popular ways to get skillpoints and reward around 10k . 
  this means that you need to run the argala patrol 15 times per spec-point . 
  lets say that on average it takes 6 minutes to do a patrol . 
  10 patrols per hour = 1,5 hour per specialization point . 
  lets also say you 've just reached lvl 60 so you already have 10 . 
  in order to max out command , intel , commando and pilot you would need 90 specialization points . 
  judging by how much time i spend on sto i would say this would take me maybe 1-2 months if i simply did nothing but grind patrols in the delta quadrant . 
  and that 's just with one character . 
  yeah i agreed with your post , it 's carrowcanary who for some reason seem to be ok with this shit who i 'm disagreeing with . 
  i did not . 
  it 's just that 99 % of the assignments reward a pathetic amount of skillpoints and cryptic somehow `` forgot '' to increase the sp reward from doffing when they increased the sp requirement for gaining spec points by 200 % . 
  personally i prefer saying asperger since the word autism makes me think of rainman level autism or worse . 
  it 's only on tribble, 
  [ assassination classroom ] ( http://myanimelist.net/manga/39883/ansatsu_kyoushitsu ) : ended up binge reading it after watching the first anime episode . 
  i do n't know how i had missed this because it 's one of the best manga i 've read . 
  i love the characters , the humor and the mc is like a scary/adorable male tomboy lesbian . 
   no one uses a2b2 now , except in the very rare instance of using an a2b build on a ship with only a lt. cmdr engineer, 
  or ships with a commander engineering seat but no lt or lt. com seat , like the d'diridex . 
  i just put oss2 in the lt. sci/intel hybrid station on my a2b eclipse and qib . 
  according the memory alpha ( the star trek wiki ) they somehow built it themselves . 
  one of the guys in our fleet was somewhat insane to the point where we joked that he was an ai or an `` emergency farming hologram '' because he and his alts kinda funded 80 % of our fleet holding projects . 
  he basically set his alarm to when our fleet project would finish so we could start the next ones withing 5 minutes or so because his goal was to win the race to complete the fleet holdings first . 
  ( i do n't think we ever won but we did complete our holdings before the reddit fleets most of the time . ), 
  he had a personal fleet called the house of storage or something that he made just to get more fleet bank slots where he stored all the commodities needed to upgrade our fleet . 
  all of this was mostly funded by his army of marauding alts that just kept on producing tons of contraband . 
  one thing i would recommend is getting the experimental proton weapon from the dyson rep. you already have 2 pieces and the 3p set bonus is a +10 % bonus to crit chance and crit severity for photon torps . 
  i do think your idea about using dbbs do have some merit . 
  if you replace the exocomp and hakeev with 2x conn officers you would only need one copy of tt1 and could then have 2x faw as well as 2x ts and 2x apb . 
  with a dbb , the proton weapon and a omni beam only the heavy turret would be left out and imo that 's not such a big deal . 
  how about a risian science ship with 1 hangar and some new risian shuttles/fighters . 
  super speedy shuttle pets with emergency power to engines 1-3 and beam arrays , maybe also faw1 at elite . 
  yeah with 0,5 % chance per box the odds of not getting a single carrier with 120 keys is 1-0 ,995 ^ 120 = 0,452 = 45,2 % so it was n't even that unlikely . 
  personally i would go with something like tt1 , faw2 , faw3 , apb3 in the com tac slot and tt1 , apb1 in the lt tac slot . 
  this would let you cycle all the tac abilities you need without any doffs . 
  maybe put tykens rift 2 or gravity well 1 in the lt com science slot for some aoe drain or crowd control and use some deflector officers and a gravimetric scientist for cd reduction and extra rifts/gws . 
  btw , your second link is the same as the first one . 
  if you 're using 3 rare conn officers then i really really think you should consider changing your boff seating to something like my suggestion and use those 3 doff slots for something else . 
  i kinda get the feeling you might enjoy assassination classroom that started this season . 
  one thing i think cryptic could do ( on top of increasing the sp from doffing ) is adding a new assignment that exist just for giving skillpoints . 
  some sort of captain training assignment with a 20h duration and cooldown that reward something like 20-30k skillpoints , 5 dil and some cxp . 
  this would give us like 1 level/spec point per week and cryptic fucking love time-gated daily stuff with 20h cooldowns . 
  yeah but i 'm not really sure that +24 in attack pattern is worth 3 doff slots when the cycle issue could be solved by simply having two copies of tt1 . 
  and since you have two copies of apb you could just cycle those two constantly so apo would n't be that useful either imo except for when you wan na go fast . 
  and if you do n't want to use gravimetric or deflector doffs ( though i would still recommend it ) there are other things you could use those doff 3 slots for . 
  maybe throw in a 3rd dce and 2 maintenance engineers that reduce the cd of engineering team for some extra durability . 
  maybe you could do something like this . 
  just as a somewhat cheap experiment .
