  replace the phaser consoles with more photon consoles and put the epw in the fore together with a dbb . 
  iirc the epw does kinda decent damage to compensate for the fact that you ca n't really boost proton damage that much and you would n't lose out on the damage from an aft weapon like you did when you put it in the rear . 
  then put the ancient obelisk omni-beam in the aft . 
  afaik your only bonus to energy damage should be the fairly small phaser and disruptor bonuses from the cc tac console and set bonus so throwing in an ap beam would n't be that bad . 
  ofc a phaser/disruptor omni-beam would probably be better but not really worth it for this experiment . 
  now you can use all your weapons in your forward arc and 3 of your 4 energy weapons could use faw and bo . 
  the biggest problem would probably be that you would totally look like a noob using a shitty rainbow build with an orange dbb , red omni beam , green turret and blueish epw . 
  actually it does . 
  i tend to do it with my dining halls and barracks just to get rid of cave adaption . 
  just now my military was able to run outside without getting dizzy or nauseous after spending like 3 years indoors . 
  the warhammer fantasy universe is kinda like a corrupt late-medieval earth with some standard fantasy elements mixed in like elves , magic , demons etc etc. 
  here 's a quick summary of some of the different factions from someone who do n't play whfb tabletop but kinda like reading the lore once in a while . 
  ** the empire of man ** : basically the holy roman empire from medieval 2 total wars late-game + magic . 
  bunch of germans that worship their lord and savior ~ ~ sigmar ~ ~ [ conan the barbarian ] ( http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130815220801/warhammerfb/images/f/f0/sigmar23_03.jpg ) and wage a constant war against the demon hordes in the east . 
  use halberd , muskets , 2h-swords and stuff like that . 
  ** bretonnia ** : pretty much just medieval france . 
  lots of knights in shining armor . 
  ** kislev ** : russia/poland + magic . 
  ruled by a tzar , their basic infantry is called kossars , their elite infantry the kreml guard , their elite cavalry the winged hussars and they also like horse archers . 
  so yeah , fantasy eastern europeans . 
  ** dwarves ** : ye old standard tolkien dwarves . 
  short people who live in the mountains and fight orcs . 
  ** high elves ** : snobbish elves who like magic and were driven away from the old world/europe after they shaved a dwarf . 
  ** wood elves ** : high elves who managed to hide from the dwarves in some large forests and eventually became a different civilization of sneaky hippie elves . 
  ** dark elves ** : evil elves who like bdsm and strange fashion . 
  arch enemies of the high elves . 
  ** orcs ** : green , violent , like fighting . 
  i think you all know who they are . 
  ** chaos ** : demons and demon worshippers who live around the north and south poles . 
  worship 4 different gods , slaanesh , khorne , nurgle and tzeentch . 
  the standard evil bad guys who everyone hates . 
  * ** slaanesh ** : god of decadence , excess , pleasure and self-indulgence ( sex , drugs and rock 'n' roll ) , most popular of the 4 chaos gods . 
  seem to be very fond of boobs . 
  have androgynous demons with boobs and giant claws that do horrible things to people . 
  * ** khorne ** : god of hate , rage and bloodshed . 
  strongest of the 4 chaos gods since he is fueled by people hate , rage etc etc. 
  the best way to worship khorne is to pick up an axe and chop someones head off . 
  * ** nurgle ** : god of decay , despair , and disease . 
  makes stuff rot and decay and generally become dead and slimy . 
  `` ewwwwww '' is probably the best way to describe him . 
  oddly enough he 's apparently the only nice chaos god . 
  * ** tzeentch ** : god of change , scheming and magic . 
  basically the geeky bookworm god who prefer schemes and deception over normal fighting . 
  ** norsca tribes ** : fantasy vikings . 
  some are kinda civilized while others are pirates/raiders . 
  afaik the most popular religion is chaos worship . 
  so yeah , demon worshipping viking raiders . 
  ** skaven ** : mutated rats with high-tech weaponry who live in caves and sewers . 
   summary ** of some ** of the different factions, 
  i 'm not listing all of them you crazy fuck , i have stuff to do . 
  oh fuck it 's been 3 years already ... 
  * the korean k1 mbt : it 's like the most cost efficient mid-tier mbt in the game ( at least for blufor ) with 17 front armor , a decent gun and 85 point cost . 
  * btr-70 / skot-2 and their cousins : wheeled transports with 14.5 mm hmgs that can really fuck up lightly armored blufor victims and they only cost 15 points . 
  pretty much one of the main reasons that redfor factions are so fun as motorized . 
  * fjb-40 : elite infantry with manpads , fairly high availability , low-ish cost and access to nice wheeled transports . 
  the ability to attach agents/special characters to units in battles . 
  so far we 've had agents that can run around on the campaign map and do stuff or be attached to cities and armies to provide passive bonuses . 
  what i would like is the ability to give the command of a specific unit to an agent/character to give that unit some big passive bonuses and/or special abilities . 
  some examples, 
  * a [ warrior priest ] ( http://whfb.lexicanum.com/mediawiki/images/1/14/warriorpriest.jpg ) giving morale and melee bonuses + some sort of chant/inspire ability/aura to the unit he 's attached to . 
  * a [ bright order mage ] ( http://whfb.lexicanum.com/wiki/bright_order ) that might not give any passive bonuses but would add a bunch of offensive fire-magic abilities . 
  * champion of khorne , crazed fanatical warrior that would increase the melee attack and charge of the unit + give it a demoralize aura like berserkers in rome 2 . 
  some agents should ofc not be able to do this , like spies/assassins and other less fighting oriented agent-types . 
  on the other hand some character types should n't have any campaign map abilities and would instead only be useful for providing passive bonuses to armies and units . 
  edit : i would also like retinues and items that can give generals special abilities and bonuses instead of just '' +3 zeal '' and stuff like that , like a magic sword that can shoot lightning or a standard-bearer that add some buffing aura . 
  from wikipedia, 
   bretonnia is based on real-world medieval france ; its name is clearly derived from the french province of britanny although arthurian legend is also clearly one of the inspirations as many of the characters have arthurian connections eg . 
  the lady , the green knight , are both arthurian based . 
  also , their geographical location in the old world matches france , so it 's medieval france with some english spicing . 
  edit : there 's also albion which is basically celtic britain , a rainy misty island north-west of the empire with druids and stuff . 
  iirc it 's the inbred trait . 
  i was gon na complain about the mixed damage types but then i realized you had [ + beam ] consoles . 
  ofc damage specific consoles are better but the difference is not that big , so shine on you crazy rainbow diamond . 
  deflector , engines , warp core and shield looks fine , it 's one of the standard builds around here . 
  since you have deflector doffs i would replace the gw1 with tykens rift 2 . 
  that way you can kinda cycle between them and since the gravity well lasts a bit longer than their 15s shared cooldown they make a pretty nice combo since you can then use your tr2 on the enemies stuck in the gw . 
  if you have the r&d science school trait i would personally use 5 particle generator consoles for some really nasty exotic damage . 
  otherwise i would probably recommend more flow cap consoles to boost your plasmonic leech , tykens rift and energy siphons . 
  that 's pretty much my answer as well . 
  engi a with 2x ion blast mark ii , 1x heavy ion , 2x combat drone mk i , 1x anti-ship beam drone , automated reloader and drone recovery arm . 
  i pretty much just disabled my targets weapons , shield and oxygen and spammed drones at them . 
  it was n't just my most evil ship ever but also the ship that gave me my first victory . 
  i just shut down the flagships weapons and let the drones do the rest . 
  imo engineers pretty much make the best carrier captains in sto ( though ofc all class + ship combos are viable ) . 
  tac abilities do n't really affect the damage of your hangar pets that much and staying alive is even more important than usual since if you die so does your pets and they will then lose their damage bonus . 
  that guy does n't look that much like cruhteo but [ this guy ] ( http://i.imgur.com/zav4fq6.jpg ) is waaaaaaaay to fucking similar except for the hair . 
  maybe they actually mass-produce nobles in some factory and cruhteo was just a `` blonde series mk iii '' or something . 
   for a second i thought i saw cruhteo in the opening, 
  you 're not the only one . 
  except for a slight difference in hairstyle/color [ this guy ] ( http://imgur.com/a/eqaxt ) looks pretty much exactly like cruhteo . 
  dude , this could revolutionize binge-watching !, 
  i admit this was a bit too fast for me to read all of the text but i think it would be possible at maybe 3-4 minutes per episode . 
  that would be 15-20 episodes per hour . 
  i could watch all 110 episodes of legend of galactic heroes in a single day at that speed !, 
   crth : 30.6 %, 
   antiproton dual beam bank mk xi [ acc ] [ crth ] [ dmg ], 
  i swear that if i was n't so damn poor right now i would buy you some fucking [ crtd ] x3 dbbs . 
  that ship deserves better guns damn you !, 
  it could still be him !, 
  it would n't be that strange for him to have a slightly different hairstyle after being hit with a giant death-ray .
