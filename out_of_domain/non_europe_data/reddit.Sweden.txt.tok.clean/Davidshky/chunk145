  we can rebuild him , we have the technology , but his instructions to the hairstylists were unclear . 
  i currently run argala until the character reach lvl 58 after which i switch to gerren . 
  the best thing about gerren is that i can either do it in like 2 minutes or i can just afk and let the npcs and my plesh brek frigates do the work for me . 
  you have to start the last of the generic system patrol mission episodes ( taking care of enemies ) and then get the special mission from that romulan chick . 
  i got a bunch of dil from foundry missions long ago and invested some in character slots that has given me a pretty decent income from doffing ( marauding + tau dewa aid assignments ) with all my alts . 
  if rngesus smile on me i could make maybe 50-40 mil ec in one week from selling contraband and suliban slaves on the exchange . 
  i could probably make more than that but i keep all the sulibans worth less than 2 mil since they 're useful for doffing and selling a lot of stuff can be a pain in the ass . 
  i should also do some b'tran cluster colonization to get technicians but you cant get contraband in that area and i 'm too lazy too move around . 
  yeah i just sell all of my contraband . 
  i 've saved enough dilithium during these years to keep me afloat for a while and i could also get quite a lot of dil from doing the reputation grind on my alts . 
  if you want to be really really safe just make a bridge as a gate and hook it up to a lever . 
  this can on the hand get kinda boring and having to wait for the enemies to leave in order to get surface access can be a real pajn . 
  the other options would be tons and tons of traps or a decent militia . 
  then you must have built it wrong . 
  afaik raised bridges cant be destroyed by `` building destroyers '' from the bottom-side so if it raised inwards then they ca n't do anything . 
  if you like the neutronic torpedo then i guess you might enjoy some sort of drain build . 
  something tactical and sciency with decent turn rate , like the plesh brek or the dyson destroyer . 
  lots of flow cap consoles + protonic polaron weapons ( and maybe the delta rep weapon as well for the set ) + tykens rift and/or gravity well for aoe-drain and/or crowd control . 
  deflector doffs for cd-reduction and a gravimetric doff for extra tykens rifts or gravity well would be useful but not necessary . 
   ** if rngesus smile on me ** i could make maybe 50-40 mil ec in one week from selling contraband and ** suliban slaves ** on the exchange . 
  some of the doffs i can get from the tau dewa aid assignments are worth 5-10 mil ec on the exchange so ** sometimes ** i can make that much in a week . 
  the advanced fleet armors that give +10 % crit chance or +80 % crit severity are also pretty viable and fairly cheap . 
  not that good for protection but really nice for glass-cannon builds, 
  two of my characters use the crtd armor and with some traits and gear they get like 25 % crit chance and 170 % crit severity . 
  first of all you should make some changes to your boff layout to something like [ this ] ( http://skillplanner.stoacademy.com/?build=bastionasdfgh_0 ) . 
  then i 'd suggest you get the romulan rep console for more crits and some fleet embassy sci consoles with [ pla ] for some extra damage with the plasma dot . 
  if you can afford a plasmonic leech console then i would really recommend getting it and using flow cap consoles to get even more power . 
  one important question is , what 's your budget when it comes to ec , dil and fleet credits ? 
   as my build is 100 % anti-proton . 
  i 'm not sure how those specialty consoles work that you are describing . 
  the embassy plasma consoles give all non-plasma weapons a plasma dot proc which is actually better than the damage bonus they give to plasma weapons . 
   in general , i do n't seem to have a problem with power levels , they 're usually all above 100 with aux to bat during combat . 
  you can never have too much power !, 
  but i guess it 's not really in your budget so nvm . 
  do you have romulan embassy sro boffs ? 
  they cost 80k fleet credits and some dil and give you +2 % crit chance and +5 % crit severity . 
  also , even if you ca n't afford it now , make it a sort of long term goal to get some beams with [ crtd ] x3 or better . 
  well he 's already using an a2b build so i went with that . 
  technicians are expensive so if he already spent ec on those then i 'm not gon na tell him to join the cult of zemok . 
  or rather , i prefer refining builds and ( if possible ) use what they got when giving build advice . 
  you can get romulan boffs from the fleet embassy but only the rare male tactical boffs have the sro trait . 
  are you playing as [ harry mudd ] ( http://thisainthell.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/harcourt_fenton_mudd_2267.jpg ) ? 
  the jimmies of some redditors, 
  somewhat related question : in theory , would the waq-torp be useful for a beamboat if combined with the command specialization ? 
  like how much of a punch could it pack if it ignored 150 kinetic resistance ? 
   how do i ensure i embark on a sedimentary layer ? 
  i 've embarked on metamorphic 3 times in a row and i just want some useful metals darn it . 
  the prospect command in dfhack will give you an estimate of what you will find in the area before embarking . 
   how on earth do i manage a clothing industry efficiently ? 
  clothing seems like a very labour intensive industry , with so many pieces the dwarves need . 
  for 60 dwarves you need 120 socks , 120 mittens , 60 cloaks , 60 hoods , etc etc the laundry list goes on and on . 
  have you heard of our lord and savior workflow ? 
  it can turn clothing industry into something almost trivial by allowing you to keep stuff on repeat and set some sort of production limits . 
  basically , you make a job , set it on repeat and use the workflow settings . 
  then you can give an order like , `` if we have less than 50 shirts , produce shirts until we have 100 shirts or more '' . 
  so if you have 20 shirts , workflow will keep the job going until you have 100 shirts and then automatically suspend it until you have less than 50 shirts after which it will unsuspend it . 
  i ca n't even play df without it anymore because it 's so good . 
  people of the same dynasty are automatically allies and since the karlings control a lot of countries they kinda form a really big european military alliance that can be really fucking hard to defeat . 
  i know but clothes are pretty valuable for something with an infinite raw material so i tend to make a lot to export and it trains my clothiers . 
  ask for a starbase invite from someone in a fleet with access to elite hangars . 
  there 's a channel called nop public service ( or something like that ) that gives out invites to fleet holdings to anyone who ask . 
  the red alert soundtrack is strong in this one . 
  maybe he was saved by [ pseudo-cruhteo ] ( http://i.imgur.com/zav4fq6.jpg ) that we 've seen in the op, 
  [ attack on titan is knights of sidonia on the ground mkay . 
  yeah , i just think it 's important to point out that snk is older than snk since people think it 's the other way around just because the snk anime came out before the snk anime . 
  in japanese , knights of sidonia ( shidonia no kishi ) and attack on titan ( shingeki no kyojin ) has the same abbreviation , snk . 
  my advice is to not open them at all unless you really want lobi crystals . 
  i would recommend something like [ this ] ( http://skillplanner.stoacademy.com/?build=dasdasdadfffffs_0 ) . 
  a2b is pretty pointless on this boat since it has enough tac abilities as it is and it 's kinda supposed to be a sciency escort thingy so you should imo use the lt com station to get gw1 . 
  get some damage control engineers for cd reduction for the epts and eptw abilities and then maybe a gravimetric officer for more gravity wells . 
  if you really want a torp + torpedo spread then maybe get 2 conn officers and replace one tt1 with ts1 . 
  why 2x rsp when you have a2b ? 
  personally i would go with something like this, 
  more weapon power and you have what is imo the best intel power , override subsystem safeties . 
   a2b with just one copy would n't do that . 
  with a2b you should be able to use rsp every 1 minutes with just one copy as long as you cycle a2b properly ... 
   rsp2 has a cooldown four times longer than any of these . 
  that makes it even easier to a2b since the cd reduction from technicians is in % . 
  3x vr technicians = 30 % cd reductions . 
  30 % of 2 minutes is 36 seconds . 
  so every 10 seconds you would reduce the cd of rsp by 36 seconds . 
  edit : why would you have to do it in 18 seconds ? 
  i think one or both of us ( probably you ) are very confused about how a2b works . 
  it will also be nice to get a proper cruiser for romulan characters . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://eve.battleclinic.com/killboard/killmail.php?id=14381372 ) my very old myrmidon hull tank fit if anyone is interested . 
  it even saw some action before blowing up . 
  i really want it for one of my kdf characters . 
  supremacy , frontal assault and advanced firing solutions could result in a pretty fun cannon build . 
   comes equipped with the well-known polaron barrage console , seen frequently in use by vaadwaur in space combat . 
  my suggestion is to buy some mirror universe ships from the exchange to play around with . 
  that way you can get cruisers , escorts , science vessels and now even stuff like kazon raiders for a fairly low cost . 
  [ never forget !, 
  i would seriously pay zen to get the romulan mirror material for the rest of my romulan ships , it 's one of the best looking materials in the game . 
  cryptic plz , space-barbie for my spaceships . 
  they have fucking [ scuds ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scud ) ?????????????? 
  now i 'm gon na have to play this mission with all my characters ... 
  can we really protect every potential target with patriots ? 
  afaik , infantry fighting vehicle means that it fights with infantry , not that it 's an `` anti-infantry vehicle '' . 
  actually i do n't see any mention about reducing the squad size of the swedish hemv\u00e4rnsm\u00e4n ( in these patchnotes ) , just the danish and norwegian militias . 
  i know but it does n't say so in the patchnotes .
