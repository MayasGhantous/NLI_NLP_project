  they probably just forgot to include it in the notes but still . 
   yellow omega trace, 
  made some `` minor '' modifications to your build, 
  you should probably get a fleet warpcore with [ amp ] , the borg set console and better weapons and consoles in general . 
  you should probably get some damage control engineers to reduce the cd of epts and eptw as well . 
  basically some sort of strange and rare rich kid phenomenon . 
   but since im stuck with the star cruise, 
  you 're hardly stuck with it . 
  you can buy mirror universe escorts , cruisers , sci vessels and more on the exchange for a pretty low cost . 
  yeah they seem to forget a lot of zeroes fairly often ... 
  depends on the type of cluster munition does n't it ? 
  sounds more like science oriented battlecruisers kinda like the sci versions of the oddy , bortas and scimitar . 
  one thing i really want is a list of unit abilities and traits , with detailed information about what they do and which units have them . 
  [ this ] ( http://dsi0fanyw80ls.cloudfront.net/en/manual/single-player/0086_enc_page_battle_play_phase_conflict_attributes#enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_attributes_disciplined ) list barely gives any information at all ... 
  i would also like the ability to sort units by a specific stat, 
  ehm no , this is 100 % normal . 
  you usually only get the current lock box . 
  in fact , the special promotion event is when they allow all old boxes to drop the week before they release a new box . 
  so for the next 2 months or so you 'll only get vaadwaur boxes . 
  brent spiner !, 
  not only could he do data but also [ picard ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqcammv9g1y ) or at least data talking like picard . 
  goblin sieges are borked in 40 . xx . 
  apparently they actually have to travel to your fort now and afaik they rarely succeed due to lakes , rivers and hostiles . 
  i think i 've critted 1 million damage with the nadion bomb once against a borg cube . 
  i suspect that there were quite a lot of damage resistance debuffs involved but still . 
  maybe not the answer you 're looking for but my recommendation would be to simply get the [ support cruiser ] ( http://sto.gamepedia.com/support_cruiser ) from the temporal ambassador mission and move on . 
  before you know it you 're lvl 30 and will get a new free ship . 
  the heads still had heads and skulls that were `` mangled beyond recognition '' but apparently you cant like totally crush them or something ... 
  basically you need magma or atom smashing to get rid of them . 
  i think i 'm gon na collect a bunch of caged zombie heads and let them fight the clowns someday . 
   where it can not be damaged nor damage anyone else . 
  actually i lost 4 hammerlords to 3 heads and in the combat log i saw that one head bit the ear of a hammerlord . 
  40.24 and it 's not the bug where dwarves refused to attack stuff . 
  the heads simply wo n't die after being bashed with steel hammers or turned into pin-cushions ( one head had 50 bolts stuck in the head ) . 
  i had 10 hammerlords , 10 markswarves , 3 wrestlers and 50 civilizans + 10-15 dogs fight against two heads until they were getting dehydrated and the heads were just as `` fine '' as they were before . 
  they had also survived my weapon and spear traps that killed the 80 normal zombies . 
  my next experiment will either be dropping them 100 + z-levels or letting them fight the hfs . 
  i know that human and elf heads have the same problem and i suspect that giraffe heads does as well . 
  maybe it 's because they were resurrected by a necromancer after being turned into a pulped mess . 
  i 'm not in an evil biome but i have a trapped necro that i throw refuse to for my anti-goblin defense system . 
  i do know that they 're vulnerable to magma ( though they take surprisingly long to die ) since that 's how i dealt with them the first time . 
  not sure if normal fire like a forest/grass fire or burning lignite works though . 
  i think they can look good by mixing some of the parts but yeah , the standard versions are kinda horrible . 
  on the bright side , kdf finally got a proper sciency cruiser ( 4 sci consoles and lt com science ) in the z-store . 
  `` ok '' said cryptic and reduced the exp from assignments by 90 %, 
  would n't aa that 's ineffective vs small ships be considered `` crappy aa '' ? 
   although powerful in an anti-ship role , it was ineffective against agile starfighters . 
  so yeah , they were pretty crappy for aa since they were n't designed for it . 
  but did n't you say '' [ not crappy aa ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/starwars/comments/2vte0d/7_star_wars_quotes_that_would_have_saved_the/col1xe4 ) '' ? 
  they might have been awesome anti-ship cannons but if they ca n't hit small stuff they 're `` crappy aa '' . 
  yeah , but since the ds1 apparently did n't really have any other proper aa turrets to complement the xx-9s and apparently not that many tie-fighters either they must ( imo ) have been relying on the xx-9s for aa as well . 
  welp , looks like i just found the next thing to waste my ec on . 
   cheapest dil wise, 
  well that would be the omega upgrades since they do n't require any dil to use ( iirc ) . 
  well tbh that should make the decision waaaaaaaaaaaaaaay easier . 
  i could totally love cf if it only gave the bonus hyt to people with torps and if we had a command escort . 
  especially if it was a kdf escort so i could combine it with the mat ` ha raptor trait . 
  inb4 t6 defiant for the gamma quadrant/playable cardassians/dominion invasion + rep grind expansion . 
  nope , nope nope nope . 
  boxes are like lottery tickets , unless you get really lucky you 're just gon na waste a lot of ec/dil/zen . 
  selling the keys on the exchange is a much much better way to get ec . 
  honestly , do n't open boxes unless you want lobi crystals or some other account bound item or you just like gambling/wasting money . 
  i think playable jem ` hadar could work if they 're like jh rebels like the ones in ds9 who somehow have become friends with the cardies ( common hatred for the dominion maybe ) . 
  iirc that 's because they die in battle . 
  it 's not really clear how long they could live if they lived in peace or something . 
  and i meant like rebels who had fled from the dominion somewhat recently , through the wormhole or maybe an iconian gateway . 
  the jem ` hadar in ds9 looked pretty different from each other ( because of actors and stuff ) . 
  also , even though they were grown in birthing chambers they might not be identical clones . 
  there could be come variations engineered into them . 
  i never said they should give the cardassian faction jem ` hadar ships , just jem ` hadar as a playable species . 
   it was stated no jem ` hadar lived to their 30 's, 
  they never said they ca n't , just that they have n't . 
  could be that 30 years was simply the record for not dying in combat . 
  also , as i 've already said , i 'm not talking about jem ` hadar who have survived since ds9 but new younger jem ` hadar who have fled from the dominion . 
  they could be like 5-10 years old or something . 
   also jem ` hadar do not rebel , the dominion panicked when they did, 
  well obviously they can since they did . 
   they rely on ketracel white that makes then fanatic loyal to the dominion, 
  lets just pretend that bashir eventually developed a cure for this ( as he started trying in [ hippocratic oath ] ( http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/hippocratic_oath_%28episode%29 ) ) and that garak `` somehow '' got his hands on this cure . 
  when you download the files they 're encrypted ( as an anti-piracy thing afaik ) and now steam is simply decrypting everything . 
  edit : i had no idea the romans ever fought the chinese, 
   according to r. ernest dupuy and trevor n. dupuy , in 36 bc a han empire expedition into central asia encountered and defeated a contingent of roman legionaries . 
  my tactic as the geats was to simply start migrating early on and move south as fast as i could , avoiding larger armies and doing my construction and recruitment in the lands of factions i had non-aggression pacts with . 
  before i knew it i was down in greece/turkey fighting the ere , sacking cities and liberating minor factions . 
  no idea but i do n't think so . 
  i did n't really move by sea except at the start to reach germany and later on when one horde had to cross the black sea . 
  tbh my initial goal was to attack italy but then i kinda got friendly ( ish ) with the wre and due to a combination of sucking at geography , being chased by hostiles and being too zoomed in on the map i ended up in ukraine . 
  i 'm probably gon na continue moving south after fucking over the ere a bit more . 
  producing more food and lowering taxes are probably the simplest solutions . 
  also , as a horde i think you get a big growth bonus when in your `` camp mode '' or whatever its called . 
  well this game is about the [ migration period ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/migration_period ) so you are kinda supposed to migrate south/west to escape from either the cold or the huns . 
  that 's what happened irl and is kinda the reason the wre fell . 
  large numbers of migrating tribes started arriving/invading and just overwhelmed the romans . 
  also , most factions can go into migration mode and turn their armies into mobile cities just to gtfo easier . 
  pikes are ( usually ) extremely powerful against anything in front of them while they 're in the pike wall/phalanx formation . 
  as long as they do n't get flanked or killed at range they should be able to hold a defensive line or a choke point better than most units . 
  oh , so they got nerfed/bugged in attila . 
   should of been, 
  indeed . 
  my campaign as the geats ended with a last stand in alexandria .
