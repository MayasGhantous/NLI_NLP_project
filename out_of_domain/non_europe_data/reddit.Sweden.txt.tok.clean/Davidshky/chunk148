   has grenades, 
   small unit, 
  since i have n't used them myself , could you tell me how the ammo refill thing work and how small the unit is ? 
  they 've been doing something similar to me in my current ere campaign . 
  i 've fortified edessa a lot ( full stack + upgraded city ) and now the sassanids are just doing a conga train with 4 armies around it , moving around a bit and entering fortification stance pretty much every turn . 
   am i the only one who misses this system ? 
  ofc not ( i miss it as well ) but imo we simply have to accept that dlcs are here to stay . 
  games cost a lot more to develop nowadays ( unless you like make an indie game with 90s graphics ) and the companies do have to make a profit . 
  they could either add more content and increase the standard price , release extra content as dlc later on for a minor cost or simply not add any extra content at all . 
  i have to agree with cattbooty, 
  i used to be a bit of a purist but now i ca n't even imagine playing without dfhack and dwarf therapist . 
  workflow ( semi-automated production ) , planning mode ( makes placing furniture 1000 % easier ) , partial mouse control and prospect ( command that tells you what stuff is/will be available in the area , can be used to find good embarks ) makes everything so much easier and enjoyable . 
   note : newly purchased research and development packs will only offer the chance to win the jem ' hadar strike ship during this promotional event . 
  ** once this event ends , the packs will revert back to their previous state and no longer offer the bonus lobi or the jem ' hadar strike ship . 
  i guess i should sell my old seshar promotion packs asap in case cryptic decides to fuck with them as well . 
  and as i mentioned , you can make a pretty great/popular game ( like minecraft , ftl , bastion , binding of isaac and kerbal space program ) with a low ( ish ) budget but then you 'll probably end up with dated graphics , sound or like less content . 
  it would probably be possible to make an awesome total war game with great gameplay for a low budget if you had something like [ darwinia ] ( http://www.introversion.co.uk/darwinia/sharedresources/screenshots/image19.jpg ) graphics and 8-bit sound . 
  ( i do kinda want that if the battles could be waaay bigger ) . 
   if we did this , we would have to do this for every total war game that has a encyclopedia . 
  that would mean that we would have a huge lost of links in the side bar . 
  if you do n't want a long list in the sidebar then my suggestion would be to only have the encyclopedia for the latest tw game in the sidebar and the rest in the wiki . 
  also , would a long list really be that much of a problem ? 
  you could just make it compact like the resources list . 
  click the + sign for more detailed information . 
   also is it possible to convert to `` minor religions '' ? 
  i think that would be a hilarious playthrough . 
  apparently so . 
  plant/fruit gathering zones . 
  dwarves with the plant gathering labor will automatically gather plants , fruits etc within these zones . 
  remember to make some step ladders for them as well . 
  o ________ o, 
  you should also learn them for fishing zones , meeting areas , animal pens , garbage dumps , pits , pottery , glassmaking etc etc. 
  same here . 
  if we can trust spotted flowers it 's pretty likely that [ hato is actually a mtf transsexual , which could explain a few things . 
  maybe things would be easier if he/she would come out as a bisexual trans-woman instead of being a `` straight with exceptions '' crossdressing guy ] ( / spoiler ), 
   is there a way for some of the viking factions or other `` barbarian '' factions with fairly low or non technology like crossbows and such to recruit such units ? 
  without the units being mercenaries . 
  well the germanic factions have [ these guys ] ( http://attila-enc.totalwar.com/#/unit/att_ger_germanic_crossbowmen ), 
   i would like to see a mod that lets you `` merge '' factions you subjugate into your own , like of you come across a city that has a building that let 's the `` original '' faction recruit crossbowmen or heavy armor units , it would let you recruit them as well . 
  well we can already buy some units from our subjugated factions and the ostrogoths have the ability to recruit roman units from roman buildings in captured roman cities as part of their faction trait . 
  edit : maybe they could add some sort of system similar to the romans auxiliaries in r2 to attila so that you could get access to some new units if you construct the right building in the right province . 
   also sort of irritates me that i have germanic units in the roster , i.e. 
  why is my gothic general accompanied by `` germanic nobles '' ... 
  the visigoths have n't been in german lands for a while according to the history !, 
  and ? 
  they did n't stop being germanic just because they moved a bit . 
  `` germanic '' is cultural/ethnic thing not geographical . 
   they also have gothic units , so what are they gothic or germanic ? 
   the goths ( gothic : * gut-\u00feiuda , [ 3 ] * gutans [ 4 ] ; old norse : gutar/gotar ; german : goten ; latin : gothi ; greek : \u0393\u03cc\u03c4\u03b8\u03bf\u03b9 , g\u00f3tthoi ) were an east germanic people , two of whose branches , the visigoths and the ostrogoths , played an important role in the fall of the roman empire and the emergence of medieval europe . 
  yeah but they still kinda need some infantry to support their cavalry . 
  some steppe spears and archers and maybe an onager or two to form a basic infantry force that can hold the enemies in place for your cavalry or get into the meat-grinder in sieges . 
  maybe an eastern or nomadic faction pack . 
  both culture groups only have 1 playable faction atm so they could use some additions ( like the roxolani , armenia etc ) and the basic unit roster , buildings etc are already there . 
  i 've had some success with pikes in town defense by `` embedding '' them in another unit . 
  basically i put the pikes and some more durable spear/melee unit in the same position except the pikes are one row further back . 
  that way they can still poke the attacking enemies with their pikes while the spear/melee dudes prevent the enemy units from reaching the pikemen . 
  start by getting rid of all the churches in all your provinces and then use the money to upgrade your farms and fishing ports until every province except maybe thrace and one recruitment province ( basically a province that you stop taxing and then fill with stuff like all 3 types of barracks and other military buildings . ), 
  is producing surplus food . 
  also , recruit a priest or two while you still can . 
  then try to take out the visigoths asap so you can focus on how to deal with the sassanids in the future . 
  befriending armenia is also a good idea . 
  you can get a marriage with them from the start and they will usually join you instead of the sassanids when the war starts if they like you enough . 
  in the province overview screen there 's a checkbox for taxing the province . 
  if you uncheck it you wo n't get any money from that province but it wo n't use any food or get the growth and public order penalties from taxes . 
  since barracks use food it can be a good idea to make a dedicated military province with all 3 barracks and just stop taxing it . 
  it 's also a good idea to stop taxing some food consuming province if you 're running low on food in order to avoid the starvation penalties . 
  i 'm talking about [ this one ] ( http://attila-enc.totalwar.com/#/building/att_bld_roman_east_military_1att_cult_romanatt_sub_cult_roman_east ) and its upgraded versions for the ere . 
  afaik upgraded settlements get more barricades . 
  well the main problem could probably have been games workshop and the license issues . 
  it 's also possible ca wanted to focus on historical eras rather than fantasy . 
  but since a warhammer fantasy total war is apparently being developed atm this has changed . 
  the predicted po is 40 so he must have -15 per turn . 
  fyi it 's gon na be a warhammer fantasy total war game , not warhammer 40k . 
  it 's gon na be more like late medieval total war + dwarves , elves , orcs , magic , demons , zombies , vampires , satanist vikings , mummies , lizard people , rat people , conan the barbarian etc etc. 
  check out the wiki page on melting and check the melting efficiency on different weapons and armor pieces , ie how much metal do you get when you melt an item compared to how much it takes to make it . 
  some items have an efficiency over 100 % but if you 're like me and think that 's a bit cheaty then use something with 90 % . 
  then you simply start mass-producing the item and melt down the low-quality items they make to get some metal bars back to continue making new weapons/armor . 
  with dfhack and workflow it can even be automated . 
  you can make a stockpile that automatically designates the stuff in it for melting so you could make a weapons and/or armor stockpile that only allow low quality stuff that takes from your normal weapon/armor stockpile and workflow will keep the item melting and weapon/armor production up and running even if you temporarily run out of bars or melt-designated items . 
  war and hunting animals will simply follow the person they 're assigned to and engage hostiles/targets . 
  try assigning one to a hunter in the future . 
  that way it will follow him/her around and attack the animals the hunter is shooting at . 
  yeah pastured animals will stay in their pasture even if assigned to a dwarf . 
  also , iirc unpastrued and unassigned war/hunting animals will follow their trainer around instead . 
  i 'm not i would like an entire tw game around the americas but i think an expansion/dlc could work , kinda like the america part of the kingdoms expansion for medieval 2 . 
  like when/if they make medieval 3 a dlc campaign about the early exploration/colonization could be nice or something similar ( but later on ) when/if they make empire 2 . 
  well it 's not really that clear that heroes = units with the encourage trait . 
  edit : also , in r2 heroes were an agent type which makes it even more confusing . 
  so from what i have read it 's possible to transport water and magma with minecarts by submerging them or pouring the liquid on them . 
  now what i would like to know is if exposing a minecart full of magma to water would give me a minecart full of obsidian . 
  if so , could this be used to make an automated obsidian generator ? 
  galatia is playable in rome 2, 
  yes . 
  if you buy the caesar in gaul dlc galatia and some other factions become playable in the normal r2 grand campaign . 
  i think the province governors kinda fill the same role ( ish ) as the council in ck2 . 
  you give some character the job and he then gives some bonuses to a region depending on his skills/stats . 
  the offices in attila are sort of the other way around , the position gives bonuses to the holder but have to be earned first . 
  [ well it looks like rosaxchris will get back together next episode ] ( http://i.imgur.com/yvfsfjy.jpg ) ^ ^ very ^ ^ briefly, 
   edit : should i install the lazy newb back ? 
  imo yes .
