  it makes small settings like texture packs , autosaves , disabling pet burials much much easier and it gives you stuff like dfhack and dwarf therapist that i personally really do recommend . 
  they could be debuffed my whistling arrows or settlement destruction ( if you 're defending in a siege ) . 
  look at the sidebar . 
  enemy reinforcements arriving behind my neat little defensive line . 
  afaik [ this ] ( http://attila-enc.totalwar.com/#/unit/att_ger_barbed_javelinmen ) is the only skirmisher in attila that 's actually somewhat decent in melee but i 'm not sure it 's worth the extra 170 upkeep . 
  edit : [ these guys ] ( http://attila-enc.totalwar.com/#/unit/att_nor_elite_saxon_javelinmen ) appear to be even better at melee but they 're also even more expensive . 
  one unit you really wan na get is the ballistarii , especially for defending your frontline regions . 
  very high damage ( 100 with flaming shot ) , decent range , plenty of ammo . 
  put one group on a barricade with a sacrificial melee unit in front and they can get a ton of kills before running out of ammo ( my current record is 696 ) . 
  press insert, 
  as the others have explained they 're all `` chods '' and he also called it a chodfie in the description on [ instagram ] ( https://instagram.com/p/0vvkmvhtcw/ ) . 
  you usually use chode though , not chod . 
  since this is the fixed version it must mean that this is totally 100 % intentional and not a buggy unintended exploit like the previous version of doping , 
  min !, 
   * all units in the celtic faction rosters have the guerrilla deployment trait . 
   * as ` children of the night ' , the picts rightfully earn their reputation as skilled nocturnal combatants at land and sea , and may always choose to attack at night . 
  well that 's gon na be a pretty awesome/ridiculous bonus combination . 
  has to be english . 
  we swedes can kinda understand norwegian but danish is just really strange and the finnish language has to come from outer space or something . 
  you might be friendly with the nearby human civilization but that does n't mean that you 're friendly with every human group in the area . 
  yeah they really need something to nerf their spamming ability . 
  together with their friends and puppets they just have soooooooo many armies . 
  even worse , they 're the most cowardly bastards i 've ever seen . 
  instead of attacking my cities they 'll put like 6 + stacks in fortification mode outside them and just sit there . 
  i also really hope ca release a eastern culture pack soon . 
  i really want to play as an eastern faction but not as the easy mode ggwp sassanids . 
  i tried them out but when i made 20k + per turn after 5 turns i realized it was gon na be a bit too easy . 
  i actually want armenia to be one of the factions in the pack . 
  they 're a fairly major faction ( imo ) and they have a nice starting position . 
  also , a lot of the eastern units even are armenian . 
  and being a puppet could be interesting . 
  you probably do n't wan na stay as a puppet forever but you also probably do n't want to face the wrath of the sassanid blob , creating a nice little catch 22 . 
   * africa, 
  my guess is that it has to do with the ais dislike towards big empires . 
  in the new patch notes they say `` great power ' trait has been rebalanced . '', 
  so maybe things will get better next week . 
  maybe they could do this with the gift region thing . 
  like if the romans gift a region to a horde faction it will become a puppet state . 
   * diplomacy with the barbarians, 
  like the africans this might also be solved with the great power rebalancing . 
   * the armies, 
  some more internal loyalty/po/integrity problems in exchange for better relations with the barbarians could be interesting . 
  one thing that bothers me when playing as the wre and ere is their garrisons . 
  replace the damn exploratores with a levis armatures or something and add some garrisons to the barracks . 
  like a comimatense ( spelling ? ), 
  spear from the t1 barrack , then a legio from the t2 infantry barrack , a sagittari or funditores from the t2 range barrack and a scout equites from the t2 cav barrack . 
  then mmmmmaybe a numeroi from the t3 infantry barrack , a ballistarii from the t3 range barrack and some cav unit from the t3 cavalry barrack . 
  imagine combining a good general unit with an ybor that has the [ godan 's blade trait ] ( http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=402761831&amp;insidemodal=1 ), 
   melee damage : +15 % ( commanded force ), 
   melee attack : +15 ( commanded force ), 
  something like [ godan 's chosen ] ( http://attila-enc.totalwar.com/#/unit/att_ger_godan%27s_chosen ) with those bonuses would be insane . 
  yeah -21 morale is evil , even more so vs christians as the huns for that extra -10 morale . 
  if possible i will often try to save some ammo for 1-2 archers so that i can use the fire/whistle combo when the enemy units are shaking/wavering . 
  actually i find this combo even more useful for shitty archers since they ca n't do much damage anyway . 
  i mean usually i wo n't really get the shitty archers at all but sometimes you get a few in a garrison or i might have hired some mercenaries for an upcoming battle ( like an enemy stack just outside a settlement ) . 
  like the 1 sagittarii that you get as a part of the garrison of roman t2 settlements . 
  it ca n't kill much but if you save it for later and then use it to cycle fire and whistling arrows at the enemies at the right moment it can basically win the entire battle . 
  i have n't played much as the wre but i 've done a lot of attempts as the ere so here are my tips . 
  1 : get rid of all the churches asap . 
  damn things drain money and you should try to convert to graeco-roman paganism anyway . 
  also , recruit some priests if you want to before destroying the churches . 
  2 : try to make every province produce its own food . 
  there 's a -25 % income from buildings and some po penalty to provinces that import food and it 's a good way to avoid famine from strange events , sacking and stuff like that . 
  3 : make 1-2 recruitment provinces near the frontlines . 
  ie , pick a province that you wan na use for recruitment , stop taxing it so it wont use any food and then build all 3 barracks in it + other military buildings and then upgrade the settlements for bigger garrisons . 
  4 : upgrade your minor settlements in general for some extra wealth but most importantly a better garrison . 
  random hordes and rebellions are much easier to deal with if you have non-shitty garrisons . 
  5 : try to unlock the ballistarii asap . 
  those bastards are so good they should have their own religion or something ( 100 damage with fire ammo ) . 
  a general with 4 ballistarii can together with the garrison hold of a lot of hostiles and is basically the most cost efficient defense in the game . 
  [ just look at this shit !, 
  ] ( http://cloud-4.steamusercontent.com/ugc/527258867807182167/ab11e5d1548d50d12708d82b277874a667a4c938/ ), 
  6 : do n't be afraid to raze enemy settlements . 
  taking and holding territory can be really hard when you 're in a n-front war ( n = more than you can handle ) but you can at least deny the region to your enemies and maybe even wipe out some smaller factions completely . 
  one tactic i often used against the sassanids was to send 1-2 good legions on a suicide mission , sneaking around the frontline and then razing as many settlements as i could before they were killed . 
  make a desert and call it peace . 
  you have two armies fairly near the city they basically always attack turn 1 so move one army into that city and give it all the units from the other army . 
  kick their asses and then take out the survivors in the following turns . 
  you can easily wipe the out in like 2-5 turns this way . 
  edit : also , after winning that battle , make a new save that you can use if you want to restart the ere campaign without having to repeat the whole church removing , farm making and visigoth killing thing every time . 
   spies help with hinder army to slow down retreating hordes . 
  or you can use them to reduce corruption in your main money provinces . 
   build a military port in berence , egypt and have them train 1-2 fleets to help sack ( and eventually occupy ) the sassanid persian gulf cities . 
  how have i never thought about that ... 
  i 've only had fleets in the mediterranean to defend my coast and islands and deal with transport fleets . 
  i 'm seriously considering a new ere campaign just to do this to the damn sassanids . 
  i kinda suspect they might be saving the t6 defiant for when they add the gamma quadrant since they kinda belong together like the intrepid and the delta quadrant . 
  germanic crossbowmen . 
  they 're kinda like a slightly shittier version of the elite ballistarii but the most important thing about them is that one of the buildings you can recruit them from can be unlocked in two turns ( tier 3 goat pen ) . 
  if you have the dlc the langobards godansmen are really a must have ( berserkers with armor ) and their basic clubmen are really good for their cost . 
  the grp bonus is +2 sanitation in all regions and you get access to a province edict that gives 2 more sanitation . 
  it 's not fucking released yet ... 
   release date : 25 mar , 2015, 
   pre-purchase total war attila : celts culture pack, 
  special promotion !, 
  offer ends 25 march, 
  one thing i really really want is a '' [ miranda ] ( http://41.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m7ea7trfrr1rzu2xzo1_1280.jpg ) - style '' cruiser in terms of design . 
  fairly compact with no neck between the hull and saucer and the nacelles under the main hull and a handlebar-thing on top . 
  and no i do n't mean retrofit or refit but rather a modern spiritual successor . 
  edit : basically something like the [ merian-class ] ( http://www.shipschematics.net/startrek/images/federation/explorer_merian.jpg ) in terms of design .
