  1 being hardest , 6 being easiest . 
  collectors : oh shit , oh fuck , oh crap , nonononononono !, 
  geth : fucking staggerhaxorzbasterds !, 
  reapers : get away from me you screaming maniac , and oh great , i stepped on a walking acid-sack again . 
  pathetic cerberus trying to kill me with smoke , have a taste of my shotg ... is that a turret ? 
  it 's a turret !, 
  geth when playing a class with energy drain : drain , drain , drain , drain , drain , drain , drain etc etc etc. 
  geth when playing krogan vanguard : punch me prime , punch me in the face !, 
  is that the best you can do ? 
  getting the mass effect banner unlocks the real ending . 
  [ krogan vanguard ] ( http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#53laqop[9@0@a@@l4k4@0@0 ) with the reegar . 
  try not to charge things like pyros and brutes that have other units nearby and you should be able to just fly around the map and reegar things to death . 
  throw on some ammo power and a cyclonic modulators and you 'll be extremely hard to kill . 
  if you 're good at avoiding sync kills it also works for platinum . 
  i would just cover every spaceship i build with weather baloons and launch it when i reach the max altitude of the baloons . 
  just imagine not having to use any fuel to reach 40 + km altitude . 
  nah , just attach all the balloons to the top half of the ship and it should point upwards , then disconnect them and activate the rockets . 
  so steinmann got planetside 2 . 
  i expect a lot of good machinimas in the future . 
  we need a continent where night is as dark as [ this ] ( http://youtu.be/v_rpedz2xcm?t=28s ) . 
  then headlights and flashlights would actually be useful . 
  i always let my mantis pilot the ship . 
  his repair penalty makes him less suited for working in the rest of the ship and if i 'm borded i know my bridge is safe . 
  now paint a slug and/or a rockman piloting a ship and then we 'll see who looks silly . 
  there should be a character pack , maybe 99k credits to get a single character card . 
  a crow of murders, 
  they changed the prowler deploy so it needs to be certed . 
  i really enjoy using the harrier with my vorcha soldier . 
  the high dps should enable you to quickly kill 2-3 hostiles and then move in for flaming and meleeing everything to death . 
  i would rather recommend something like [ this ] ( http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#53laqop[9@0meill4k4@0@0 ) . 
  barrier : 10 % less damage reduction for faster power recharge . 
  biotic charge : more damage instead of aoe . 
  fitness : martial artist rather than shield recharge since you 'll be using charge for that . 
  since charge kills now count as melee kills for getting rage , charging more frequently and with more power makes getting rage much easier which in turn makes you even harder to kill . 
  i believe i had the same problem . 
  if everyone sound like the [ hecu soldiers ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlwuhoeyhlc ) from half life like everyone did for me , decrease the voip volume and it should hopefully make it easier to tell what people are saying . 
  maybe if one civ founds a religion , and then lose its capital to another civ who in turn loses its cities and only has the first civs ex-capital as its only city and then found a religion . 
  then maybe a city can be the holy city of several religions . 
  reminds me of [ this ] ( http://mr-culexus.deviantart.com/art/promotions-121733891 ) by mr-culexus . 
  not really a top priority but i would recommend you to buy a weapon for the atv as soon as you feel you 've unlocked everything important . 
  i 've managed to kill mosquitos and sunderers + get a ton of tank kill assists with the 20mm mg . 
  besides , all the other vehicles start with weapons but the flash doesnt , so this is a pure upgrade rather than a sidegrade . 
  the damn thing will never die . 
  with orbs specced for power recharge and shield boost for 50 % damage reduction you should be able to just charge , boost , charge , boost , charge , boost etc etc etc and not die . 
  now imagine a flash wih rank 5 afterburner and rank 5 speed or hill climbing . 
  i would n't be surprised if you 'd be able to reach the top with the atv . 
  upgrade it with guns as well and you have the ultimate indar vehicle . 
  try to get a key from [ here ] ( http://www.planetside-universe.com/keyexchange.php ) or see if you cant get one from twitter or a friendly redditor . 
  iirc there 's info we 'll be able to `` pilot '' large ships and not only fighter style ships , but is there any info if we can do this early on or is it lategame only ? 
  i think they should just give everyone the holo sight from the start . 
  it does the same thing , but better , and it would fit better with the whole sidegrade thing . 
  give it a 20mm gatling gun instead of the current cannon . 
  same damage and accuracy as the 20mm mgs but with much higher rof . 
  should slaughter infantry at short range , fuck up light vehicles , annoy tanks to no end and murder any aircraft that 's flying low and slow enough to get hit . 
  also , put the old gun in the store for almost nothing at all . 
  i posted a [ similar idea ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/planetside/comments/11aoit/walking_techplants_faction_wide_orbital_drops_and/c6ku23s ) a few days ago . 
  too bad they removed auraxium cause it would have been the perfect resource for things like this . 
  how about some good old unguided bombs , something between 2-6 bombs with a long reload time . 
  add a [ stuka siren ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcb8zvxkqyi ) cert on top of that and it would be awesome . 
  edit : forgot to add a link for the stuka siren sound . 
  i would n't call the liberator a bomber . 
  nowdays it 's more of a gunship , like a small ac-130 . 
  giving the esfs unguided bombs would n't impose on the role of the liberator . 
  it would be more of a hit and run tactic compared to the `` circle and bombard '' thing i usually see liberators doing . 
  the thing with rockets is that they have a pretty long range but do n't actually do that much damage . 
  they seem more like an all-purpouse secondary weapon for the esfs since they tend to be used quite successfully in air to air combat as well . 
  bombs on the other hand would be better for things like tank collumns and stationary targets while rockets are better for things that wont stay still . 
   it would also be great if it could specialize in a longer sniper rifle like cannon , that is specifically design to take out base turrets from long range . 
   ap rounds , no splash damage , low speed projectile , but extremely accurate . 
  optics would basically be a requirement . 
  would n't that be the ap cannon that 's already avaliable for the lightning ? 
  didnt they use to have something like galaxies being unrepairable while deployed and removed it because it made it impossible to keep an ams galaxy alive . 
  if thet returned that and changed the galaxy so that the ams removed the transport ability then maybe they could put it back in the game . 
  * shadow headbutt, 
  * tech armor, 
  rage , rage everywhere . 
  they 're just krogan scouts that understood that scouting = !, 
  charging the enemy and then reporting back about how glorious the fight was . 
  tech armor and blade armor both give 40 % extra melee damage when specced for it . 
  i guess the advantage of blade armor would be the damage return but i 'd still prefer the extra damage reduction of tech armor . 
  total 40 % damage bonus . 
  edit : unless ofc the character creator lies, 
  mid and lategame version of the scout . 
  explorers , unlocked somewhere around the medieval/renaissance era, 
  something like +1 sight , +1 movement and some bonus for finding new resources ( as in those you havent seen before ) and natural wonders . 
  special forces/infiltrator/recon , unlocked somewhere around the industrial/modern era, 
  invisible to all other factions unless within x tiles of a unit or city , can pillage without movement cost . 
  i forgot to rejoin after the wipe . 
  char name i davidshky so invite me and i 'll come . 
  not that obvious . 
  i managed to get +60 turns of golden age with 4 great artists on standard . 
  historic is by far my favorite game speed . 
  only problem so far is that you tend to improve your cities so fast compared to the `` time '' that has passed so even though you tech slower , you can still tech flight around the 1300s without too much problem . 
  i used to run something like [ this ] ( http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#43pkrlah9%400%40a%40%40q4p4%400%400 ) with the kishock . 
  charge the gun , wait for a target , cloak , fire proxy mine , fire harpoon , rince and repeat . 
  would take out pretty much any normal enemy in one hit . 
  i have an idea . 
  in ps1 the terran max has the ability to anchor itself to double its rate of fire . 
  why not give something similar to the skyguard . 
  if deployed it gets some bonuses , for example , less recoil , shorter reload time , increased rof etc etc.
