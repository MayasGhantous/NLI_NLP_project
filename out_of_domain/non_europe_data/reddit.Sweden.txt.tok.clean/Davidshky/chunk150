  i 've suggested some sort of disguise module before . 
  something like a cloak in terms of drawbacks ( slightly less severe though ) that could disguise your ship as something from either a different faction group , tech level or size ( only + / -1 size though , so no frigs disguised as battleships etc ) with some scripts and/or disguise menu . 
  eg , an omen could disguise as any t1 cruiser-sized ship from any faction , any t2 cruiser-sized amarr ships or any t1 amarr destroyers or battle cruisers . 
  imagine disguising your curse as something less scary or vice versa to bait or scare targets/threats . 
  the nebula is more like an accident in the galaxy factory . 
  it 's also big , fat and hideous unlike the miranda or merian . 
   finally , we are considering adding interbus shipping abilities , which could reduce logistic hassle for small volume of items to fit a ship , but at a specific cost : a npc convoy would spawn and manually move to the destination , being highly susceptible to disruption from other player groups . 
  oooooh , i like this idea . 
  imagine a really big trade-hubs with convoys of yellow itty-vs constantly arriving and leaving . 
  more piracy stuff is also nice . 
  well i think it 's meant for low value cargo that you ca n't really justify using player logistics for but do n't really wan na move yourself , like for example ammo . 
  i think he meant the old raze option when occupying cities that destroyed all the buildings in the city instead of just damaging them . 
  yeah not even the huns want to mess with the sassanid blob of doom , especially when there 's a falling wre to raze instead . 
  geats , picts and the ere . 
  i found [ a bunch of other photos ] ( http://imgur.com/a/9jbnl ) and he 's most definitely a coastal ranger . 
  while i 'm not sure how i would deal with them on the open field , germanic crossbowmen should murder them ( and anything else for that matter ) in siege defenses , allowing you to use less troops for holding your frontline settlements . 
  in my ere campaign ( s ) the basic ballistarii were the keys to holding the sassanids and their puppets at bay . 
  [ example ] ( http://cloud-4.steamusercontent.com/ugc/527258867807182167/ab11e5d1548d50d12708d82b277874a667a4c938/ ), 
  i do n't have a clue about the armor ( i do doubt it 's a cosmetic change though ) but afaik melee damage is determined by the weapon type ( like 1h-axes doing 32 damage in a 16/16 split between normal and ap ) and i 'm 90 % sure that it does have some influence on the melee attack . 
  different weapon types also have different bonuses vs different targets . 
  example from the patch notes, 
  * heavy spear replaced by regular spear -- less damage vs cavalry, 
  maybe / u/walrusjones could dig out the different weapon types and their stats for us sometimes . 
  could you link the list of weapon and armor stats please ? 
  is the `` bonus vs x '' in damage or melee attack ? 
  both ? 
  o ___ o, 
  like the +30 vs cav on heavy spears and horse hewers = +30 melee attack and +30 ap damage ? 
  yeah that 's just mean . 
  the damn uar warriors also have +20 vs infantry and the same traits and abilities , so they 're basically huscarls with 40/30 damage and less charge in exchange for some shields . 
  and the [ frankish skirmishers ] ( http://www.honga.net/totalwar/attila/unit.php?l=en&amp;v=attila&amp;f=att_fact_franci&amp;u=att_ger_frankish_skirmishers ) have heavy spears in melee ... 
  does that mean they would fuck up cavalry in melee even though they 're a bunch of flimsy little skirmishers ? 
  judging by [ this picture ] ( http://i.imgur.com/9ewkiz5.jpg ) i would guess it was some international thing . 
  i would n't have called it a free-lc myself ( `` content-patch would have been better ) but i 'm not gon na complain about them calling it a free-lc cause it 's not entirely wrong . 
  i mean they could have put the celtic mercenaries and stuff in the payed dlc as well and left the ai celts with the nordic roster for those without the dlc . 
  the romans could ( imo ) use some better garrisons though , like maybe another ranged unit instead of an exploratores . 
  except the c stands for content so if its just a balance/bugfix patch with no new stuff then no . 
  i 'm actually gon na share one of the ais annoyingly cunning maneuvers it used against me recently in attila . 
  basically i had almost a 15 ish unit army in a city in africa and was waiting for a 10 ish unit army to arrive before taking out a full stack from whatstheirname ( axum ? ), 
  and then proceed to take out their last city . 
  what happened was that after my half-stack finally arrived , the enemies moved up a single lone general and besieged the settlement that my larger force was in and then attacked my half-stack with their full stack . 
  since the settlement was besieged the troops could n't come as reinforcements and their full stack could completely wipe out my half-stack , even though it was right next to the main force . 
  it would be nice if some of the emergent factions could be playable . 
  like if a player decided to play as for example gaul or britain they 'll start as a rebel army that normally would n't exist . 
   i like rome 's unit 's but rome is n't really that fun to play because their turns take so long . 
  it would be nice if some of the emergent factions like gaul , britain and pontus could become playable . 
  new interesting starting positions , faction bonuses and some local units mixed into the roster . 
  lets say that if a player decides to play as one of them they 'll start as a rebel army that normally would n't be there . 
  killing the human traders and especially their diplomat can provoke a war so do n't give up yet . 
  i want either an eastern or nomadic faction pack next ( preferably eastern ) since both those culture groups only have 1 playable faction each and the sassanids are waaaay too easy imo . 
  yeah i read about that but that 's too much imo . 
  i would just like something minor like one extra ranged unit from the start ( possibly as a replacement for the exploratores ) and then like 1-2 extra comiwhatever spears for lvl 2 and 3 settlement . 
  alternatively they should add some garrison units to the barracks . 
  like 1 comi-spear from the tier 1 barrack and then +1 cohort or / protectores from the tier 2 infantry barrack , +1 numeroi or protectores from the tier 3 infantry barrack , +1 ranged unit from the tier 2 range barrack , +1 ballistarii from the tier 3 range barrack , +1 scout equites from the tier 2 cavalry barrack and then one extra cav unit from the tier 3 cav barrack . 
  tbh the attacking testudo should only be used for approaching the enemies while under fire and should n't actually be used at all in melee so it might be working as intended . 
  * boats and ships , ranging from small wooden row-boats to larger trade ships . 
  could be useful for travel and fishing and maybe even as a new type of invaders . 
  * gunpowder for making explosives and muskets . 
  good for removing a lot of rock/soil in a short time or turn attacking enemies into a red mist . 
  * the ability to send trade caravans to neighboring civs and fortresses . 
  like you make a caravan and assign it some traders , animals , wagons , an escort and ofc trade goods and then send it somewhere with a list of stuff you want/need and then hope it makes it back somewhat safely with the stuff you asked for . 
  imo they should just change it so it does n't do anything except give the unit a huge missile block chance bonus in exchange for a speed reduction . 
  / r/stobuilds, 
  edit : just saw you 've already posted there so carry on i guess . 
  the romans have 4 starter technologies that become `` obsolete '' when you research other technologies ( the ones in the middle of the civ tree ) , making you unable to build certain buildings . 
  apparently its supposed to symbolize the transition to the dark ages when stuff like plumbing and concrete were kinda forgotten for a while . 
  probably because you 've been kinda public about both making mods and looking at ( + understanding ) the hidden stuff in the files . 
  personally i do n't mind that much . 
  games kinda need rules , limitations and stuff like that . 
  also , the technologies that make other technologies obsolete are kinda disconnected from the rest of the tech-tree . 
  you can research the entire civ tech-tree except for 5 technologies without making any of the legacy technologies obsolete . 
  so it 's basically an optional choice between keeping or replacing the old stuff . 
  personally i would like more options about stuff like `` military reforms '' . 
  like when you unlock a new unit you could get a choice between unit a and unit b. 
  eg , instead of the normal [ barbarian brigands ] ( http://attila-enc.totalwar.com/#/unit/att_ger_germanic_brigands ) being replaced by [ mounted brigands ] ( http://attila-enc.totalwar.com/#/unit/att_ger_germanic_mounted_brigands ) i could choose to unlock a better infantry version instead , but i have to choose one of them . 
  i 've actually had the same ( ish ) idea myself and i ca n't imagine it being that hard to shuffle stuff around manually if you know which filed to edit , but it might be much harder to make a mod that randomizes the starting positions each game . 
  though maybe someone could make a sort of program that could generate random starting position mods . 
  like a program that can edit the files that decide the starting positions , the relationships between factions , the buildings in the regions , the units in the armies etc etc at the beginning of a campaign . 
  then you make a bunch of rules about who/what can replace each other and let it shuffle stuff around . 
  like if it gives the saxons the wres starting position it would also change the buildings and units to barbarian/saxon stuff , the latin christianity to germanic paganism and make sure you 're allied with whoever replaced the ere and at war with whoever replaced the jutes , ostrogoths etc etc. 
  animal stockpiles, 
  yeah invincible zombie-parts can be kinda useful . 
  when i did my experiments with undead heads ( [ thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/dwarffortress/comments/2visir/zombie_heads_the_new_giant_sponge/ ) ) i ended up turning 90 % of the fort into legendary observers , strikers , fighters etc. 
  then later on one of my civilians killed a giant cave spider by himself by punching it to death . 
  i actually just caught 4 necromancers so i 'm currently planning to make a little sparring partner for my militia . 
  edit : locked a goblin crossbowman in a room with a horse hair and now he 's a hammer lord . 
  so i guess invaders can also increase in skill . 
  now i 'm tempted to try to catch more goblins and make some form of gladiator arena in the caves . 
  lock them in a training room until they 're legendary and then put them in a pit down in the caves to fight random monsters . 
  i assume you meant unkillable and it was autocorrected . 
  did ... did you read the stuff about the nda ? 
   as the game is still in development and nothing is final , you are not allowed to publicly talk or write about the game , or release images or video captured from the game . 
  now i 'm having flashbacks to my attempts at colonizing the new world in medieval 2 . 
  yeah i had a bad experience with some old leftovers once . 
  it was some thai food with green curry and it did n't look or smell bad at all . 
  two bites later and my brain decided to hate green curry for about two years before eventually getting over it . 
  i kinda wish there were also some soldiers and stuff running around . 
  like the city watch , locals who used to be soldiers , some mercenaries that were in the city when it was attacked . 
  could depend on the buildings in the city like if it enables the recruitment of a certain unit there could be 10-20 men of it marching/panicking around on the streets .
