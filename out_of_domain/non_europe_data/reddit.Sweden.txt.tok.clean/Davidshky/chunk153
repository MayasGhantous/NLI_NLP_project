  * some enemies should have a small chance to drop their `` special faction weapon type '' ( dominion polaron , romulan plasma , refracting tetryons ) with anything between uncommon and vr rarity . 
  * some new gear mods that you can only get from dropped items . 
  i 'm not talking about a huge increase in rare and very rare item drops , just enough to compensate for the reduction in vendortrash . 
  or as i mentioned , the npcs could just drop ec instead . 
  enemies dropping money is pretty standard in most mmos . 
  at least it 's not a [ gev\u00e4r m/96/swedish mauser ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swedish_mauser ) . 
   in service : 1895 -- 1995, 
   the m/1894 carbine is still used for ceremonial and guard purposes by the royal guards . 
  iirc the time it takes to get sieges kinda depends on how close you are to the goblin civ and how many rivers and lakes they have to run around to reach you . 
  hawaii pizza is probably one of the most common/popular pizzas here in sweden as well . 
  should have, 
  i kinda wish the aliens were divided into a few randomized `` factions '' (, 
  i know they 're kinda supposed to be a hive mind with the planet but there could be like rogue groups or something . ), 
  that could have different standings with each faction + humanity as a whole and maybe use a few different units ( could depend on where they live ) . 
  like you have one group of aliens far north that absolutely hate you because of your expansion/aggressions while the rest of the aliens are still neutral-ish . 
  this could also make it possible to try to piss off the aliens near your enemies while still being on decent terms with your own local aliens . 
  maybe harmony could have some sort of `` anger the aliens '' ability/unit, 
  i also think that the ultrasonic fence should be changed so that instead of simply blocking aliens it should either hurt them and/or nerf them when they 're too close to the city . 
  2 days donation for / r/millionairemakers, 
  imo the enhanced plasma manifold pales in comparison to oss . 
  it only increases the max power by 10 compared to the 30-50 bonus from oss and it does n't even buff your weapon power which is like 90 % of the reason that oss is so awesome . 
  could be kinda useful for a new alt with shit gear but not worth using a console slot for on a character with decent gear . 
  this reminds me of my first mun landing in 1.0 . 
  basically , after getting into orbit around the mun i decided to do a space-walk only to find out that one of the parachutes blocked the door . 
  i decided to land anyway since i could at least run some experiments . 
  what happened next is that after landing , i ran out of power because i basically landed just as the sun was setting and the sas was deactivated . 
  and as a result , some parts broke . 
  this gave me an idea . 
  after multiple attempts i eventually managed to remove the parachute from the hatch by `` carefully '' sliding my lander across the surface until the damn thing exploded and i was able to do an eva , plant a flag and all that crap . 
  go get yourself some finasteride and rogaine . 
  a couple of at least moderately reasonable ideas . 
  * m3 lee with the 37 mm replaced by a 75 mm gun or the 75 mm gun replaced by two 37 mm guns . 
  basically i just want multiple guns with the same rof and velocity . 
  * m2 medium tank with all .30 cal mgs being replaced by the .50 cal mg from the m2a2 . 
  ( or just all .30 cal mgs in all us tanks replaced by .50 cals ), 
  * t-60 with the nerf-gun replaced by a real autocannon , like the one that pz ii has . 
  for engineers the kit modules you want really depends on the mission . 
  when it comes to the kit frame i would either go with a [ crth ] kit from the exchange or the 8472 cc reputation kit + another piece for the 2p set bonus . 
  if you need to keep moving , shield heals , buffs and debuffs are probably your best options but in missions like bug hunt where you spend a lot of time just holding a position , turrets , mortars , mines and generators are really really powerful . 
  ftfy, 
  1.51 ca n't come soon enough cause i need that hurricane mk iv, 
  one thing they could do is to enable prosperous stations to eventually turn into city states . 
  like if they survive long enough and have some steady trade partners they 'll be able to upgrade their station . 
  it 's a [ boforst 57 mm gun ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bofors_57_mm_gun ) and it 's supposed to be used against both surface and air targets . 
  also , they apparently unveiled a new ammo type for it in april, 
   using a 4-canard actuation systems to guide the round . 
  it is fitted with a multi-mode imaging semi-active seeker that can be guided through laser designation or autonomous targeting by downloading image of the target prior to firing, 
  override subsystem safeties, 
  +0 -30 / 40/50 ** max ** and current all power levels, 
  [ they 'll never see it coming ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yybfjj3kz5a&amp;app=desktop ), 
  yeah ... 
  maybe some nomadic or eastern faction so there 's more than one option for those . 
  on the other hand , i do believe that the suebians start position could make them kinda interesting to play as even if they are just another group of germanic barbarians . 
  a t6 conny with identical stats to the t1 conny except it would have starship traits , access to the t6 skin and would cost 3000 zen . 
   thought it was bad cos it 's ferengi . 
  this + `` water crates '' from the ocean and i would be happy . 
  there are waaaay to few water chests in each world imo so some crates would be nice to for example get the water walking boots . 
  though ( imo ) not quite as annoying as being raided by a hundred mini-armies in emprie total war , running around and burning all your farms and shit . 
  i 've had the same idea myself and imo this could be the role of an npc . 
  like a record keeper that arrives after you have 20 filled chests . 
  then he/she would have a search function like you described while also calling you a messy slob . 
  money money money !, 
  + / u/user _ simulator / u/davidshky, 
  option a : use explosives to mine for a while, 
  option b : fish for crates until you have enough metal to craft a pickaxe ( imo the best option since you can get a lot of hardmode metal this way without having to break any altars and you can get metals otherwise not available in your world ) . 
  option c : fight the eow/boc boss and make a demonite/crimtae pickaxe and then mine hellstone for a new molten pick, 
  option d : fish in the ocean until you get a reaver shark ( a fish pickaxe that 's equal to the molten pickaxe ), 
  imo there should be a bunch of basic space traits that could be available for most boffs so that even if each race does n't get their own unique trait ( most races should though ) it would still be possible for a boff to get a space trait regardless of their race . 
  maybe science boffs could get access to astrophysicist , engineers could get access to techie and tac boffs ... something ( accurate ? ) . 
  there should also be basic , normal and superior versions of them . 
  eg , basic/normal/superior astrophysicist trait with +5 / 10/15 to sensors , flow cap and particle generators . 
  here 's my guess . 
  in the first be factions , the leaders ( and probably the vast majority of the population ) were convinced that earth was basically screwed no matter what we did and that humanity 's only hope would be the seeding projects . 
  for them , the high cost and low odds of success did n't really matter . 
  meanwhile in the nsa , the so called green/resilience coalition ( and probably the population ) seemed to have had the opinion that earth could be saved and that the resources that a seeding project would take would be better spent here and has had that opinion for around 80 years !, 
   crop salvage , disease prevention , education -- all these are more worthy programs than the colossal gamble of seeding, 
   to my mind , nsa chose the better course ** eighty years ago ** when we renounced our seeding program the first time around, 
  note , while tabbed out , terraria will still register your mouse clicks so make sure you 're not holding some bombs , a ranged weapon or some tool while smart cursor is on ( can result in accidental removal of blocks and furniture ) while tabbed out . 
  / s means sarcasm and i guess / j means joke, 
  ainz ooal gown, 
  there are a few things i kinda want that ( afaik ) are n't in rising tide . 
  1 ) city states . 
  stations are kinda neat but i still miss the civ v city states . 
  imo stations should be able to eventually upgrade to a cs if they 're prosperous enough . 
  2 ) `` alien factions '' . 
  i 've always disliked that the civ barbarians are one giant unified faction and i mostly feel the same about the be aliens . 
  i know they 're supposed to be a hive mind but lets say there could be some rogue groups . 
  the point of this would be that you could have different relations with different groups of aliens . 
  like you could make the northern aliens right next to your main rival hate all humans without pissing of all the aliens in your own neighborhood . 
  3 ) explorer upgrades . 
  i wish explorers could be upgraded into some new unit types later on to keep them more relevant throughout the game . 
  like some sort of military recon/commando unit with stuff like stealth and maybe pillaging bonuses . 
  i kinda wish we had some sort of auto-loot setting like in dungeons of dredmor . 
  basically in dod you could choose which types of items you would automatically pick up by walking on them so you disable it for stuff you did n't want . 
  in dod the filter was for item type categories , like potions , crafting materials , weapons etc etc. 
  the byzantine union . 
  roman style greek/turkish/balkan faction with togas and stuff . 
  edit : maybe throw in italy as well and just call it the `` roman union '' or something . 
  maybe turkey could be split in two like along the `` europe/asia border '' and the byzantine union could look something like [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/76/the_byzantine_empire%2c_c.1180.svg ), 
  would have *,
