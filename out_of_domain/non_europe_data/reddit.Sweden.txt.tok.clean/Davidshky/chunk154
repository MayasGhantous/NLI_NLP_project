   they are just stupid and have no real purpose . 
  well they can be kinda threatening early on and slow down exploration and expansion . 
  tbh i would actually just be happy if the barbarians were just split into a few factions and mostly neutral unless provoked . 
  personally i would do something like [ this ] ( http://skillplanner.stoacademy.com/?build=asfgasda_0 ), 
  since you 're using the chrono dbb and have omni-beams in the aft you should use more dbbs in the front and simply keep your targets in the 90 degree arc . 
  torps are n't that good but since you apparently like the temporal torp i left it but it could be replaced by another dbb . 
  2x tactical team , faw and apb means that you can constantly cycle those powers . 
  same thing with the emergency power to shield and weapons abilities . 
  i also removed the bio-neural gel pack and the regeneration field consoles for two extra tac consoles . 
  any particular reason why you 're not using auto-fire and max weapon power ? 
  kpv mg squad for some redfor faction . 
  15 ish points , 5 men , regular training , glorious 1,4 km range + [ ke ] . 
  maybe also a cheaper .50 cal equivalent for some blufor faction . 
  i would also like some sk-60 version armed with the 12x 135 mm rockets and/or the 2x 20 mm autocannons that it used irl . 
  or maybe an eugene version with both 12 rockets and 2 autocannons . 
  sounds like china is preparing for civilization : beyond earth - rising tide, 
  now i 'm torn between wanting some cutesy romance yuri harem anime and an anime adaption of [ yuricam ] ( http://dynasty-scans.com/series/yurikas_campus_life ), 
  thanks for the offer but i kinda like the satisfaction of getting something the hard way . 
  howitzers with [ high explosive incendiary rounds ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/high_explosive_incendiary ) . 
  some countries ( at least usa and france iirc ) had n't agreed to the phosphorous weapons ban back then . 
  even the devs have problem getting all their characters to lvl 60 . 
  fishing-rod of cthulhu , dropped by the moon lord , 60 fishing power , launches several fishing lines/tentacles at the same time . 
  why not both ? 
  the twin rod could be a rare ( ish ) drop ( expert mode is a bit too harsh for a fishing item imo ) as a early hardmode `` multi-rod '' and then the cthulhu rod could be the ultimate end game rod with like 8 tentacles at the same time . 
  one thing i plan to do is to hook them up to my pressure-plate activated teleporters in my farms so that i can use a switch/lever to temporarily stop enemies from getting teleported into the killing-chamber . 
  imo the dirt rod should basically just be like the living tree wand or whatever it 's called . 
  consuming dirt to place dirt . 
  then it could at least be useful for filling random holes and stuff at long range . 
  well it could be extremely fast or something and maybe work with the smart-cursor so you can just hold mouse 1 and quickly fill every empty block within a 5 tile radius of your cursor . 
  oooooooooh !, 
  i really hope we can get these materials ( and the romulan and kdf mirror materials as well ) through the mirror rep grind somehow . 
  or maybe they should just start selling ship materials already . 
  i 'm far more interested in space barbie stuff for my ships than my characters and would n't mind paying like 500-700 zen to unlock a ship material for all ships on a faction . 
  more terraforming stuff . 
  basically there should be an alien , terran and artificial version of stuff like grasslands , forests etc etc that can give you some bonuses depending on your affinity levels . 
  like a terran grassland could give a purity player +1 food . 
  at some point after getting your main affinity and researching some tech , your cities should start spreading the appropriate vegetation type and your workers should get the ability to spread it as well . 
  eventually you could also get access to satellites that can spread your vegetation type as well . 
  purity players would basically turn their territory into something earth-like , supremacy players would cover their territory in more `` efficient '' plants like gmo [ energy crops ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/energy_crop ) and harmony players would just like to preserve/spread the alien flora . 
  and ( iirc ) at the beginning of the war they were basically just fanatical amateurs compared to the normal army . 
  oh great , now i 'm having kekkai sensen flashbacks . 
  maybe a remodeled [ juptier-class ] ( http://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/sto.gamepedia.com/8/8d/jupiter_class.png ) ship ? 
  hopefully the next two culture packs will be one for the steppe tribes and one for the eastern factions ( armenia would be interesting ) . 
  i agree that it is pretty ugly but mostly because it 's such an old low-res model . 
  i just think that if it got a new model with a wider `` belly '' ( to fit hangars for frigate pets ) and better positioned pylons + nacelles it could be a pretty neat federation carrier . 
  plot twist , they 've been banging all this time , just not when we 're watching . 
  to be more specific , yozakura quartet hana no uta , not the original anime . 
  [ here is a video ] ( https://vimeo.com/92383943 ) from malm\u00f6 taken last week . 
  please send help . 
   ~ ~ the remainder of the arc , beginning with `` second wave '' , will remain unchanged . ~ ~, 
  yeah i only saw the cross-faction part of the [ mission list ] ( http://sto.gamepedia.com/cardassian_struggle ) so i only counted 8 missions before second wave . 
  my bad, 
  we started ours yesterday and they 'll be finished in 9 days and 15 hours from now so i expect more fleets to finish theirs around that time as well . 
  [ archer artillery system ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/archer_artillery_system ), 
  a t6 vo'quv would be pretty nice , especially if it could use the old bops and came with some new hangar-pet as well ( like a new bop with pilot or intel powers ) . 
  yeah the omega is pretty much the t6 juptier-style carrier i 've been hoping for . 
  they 're not saying you have to watch it legally , just that you 're not allowed to talk about your criminal ways on this subreddit . 
  * make it possible to add new wood to a fireplace to keep it alive longer/forever instead of having to build a new one every 4 days . 
  maybe add an old school wood-fueled cooking stove as well . 
  * colonists should be able to carry sidearms . 
  lets say weapons are categorized as small/medium/large and a colonist could carry two small or one small + one medium weapon . 
  would make it less pointless for a character to be good at both shooting and melee and it would be nice if ranged combatants ( and especially hunters ) could kinda defend themselves in melee with a knife or something . 
  * colonists should only visit the graves of other colonists and mmmaybe strangers but not hostile pirates/tribals/etc unless they 're gloating or something . 
  * mad animals + the infection mechanism is a bit too evil imo . 
  either smaller animals or infections should be nerfed a little bit . 
  could possibly be solved with sidearms . 
  i just do n't like people getting killed by fucking squirrel-bites . 
  * moods are a bit too unstable imo . 
  maybe the mood bonuses/penalties could build up over time so that we get more time to deal with the causes like the unburied corpses in the freezer or the temperature in the bedroom . 
  * shields could be pretty interesting . 
  from wooden shields that are only useful against primitive weapons to nigh impenetrable high tech shields sold by merchants . 
  could help dedicated melee fighters in open field combat and against ranged enemies with melee sidearms . 
  do n't want no damn neck on my carrier . 
  oh god , never skip leg day . 
  while i 'm not sure that i agree that the early game needs to be harder i do agree that we kinda need more low-tech stuff early on , like the manually operated turrets and old-school stoves you suggested . 
  i still want the auto-turrets and electric stoves and stuff like that as well but those should be something you unlock through research . 
  i 'm not that fond of how electricity is not only something you can get early on but basically something you must get early on , just for basic stuff like cooking ( fireplaces are annoying and barely count ) . 
  i basically just kinda want a longer early game with less need for electricity . 
  torches instead of lamps , trading with neighbors instead of spaceships etc etc. 
  to compensate for this there should be less pirates early on and more extra shitty tribals instead . 
  like small scouting parties that might run away just from taking too much fire before even taking any losses . 
  but tbh , there are ofc mods and the game is still in alpha so a lot of stuff like this might be planned but not implemented yet . 
  i 'm kinda looking for a mod and figured i might as well ask here instead of making a new thread . 
  basically , is there any mod that turns cooking , butchering and brewing into three separate columns in the work menu ? 
  i really wish i could give those things different priorities and stuff . 
  also , is there any mod that changes cooking so the chef will attempt to get like 2 * 75 ingredients and make 15 meals in one go instead of running around and getting 10 ingredients at a time ? 
  for a second there i thought you meant [ this tank ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/t-28 ) and wondered how the mm could become that fucked up . 
  then i googled t28 and stuff made sense again . 
  * cooking , butchering and brewing need their own separate columns in the work settings so you can give them different priorities and delegate these tasks to different colonists if you want to . 
  * when cooking , the colonists should try to grab a lot of ingredients ( like up to 2x75 ) and make a lot of meals in one go . 
  i mean who cooks one portion of food at a time , especially if when cooking for a group of people . 
  same thing with brewing and making artillery shells . 
  * items dropped by broken colonists should n't be forbidden by default . 
  * boxes , bins and barrels for storage . 
  boxes for storing weapons and apparel ( like up to 10 per box ) , bins for stuff like textiles , medicine , beer and stuff like that and barrels for storing foodstuff ( like up to 150 or 300 per barrel ) . 
  also , stuff in boxes and bins should not deteriorate even if outside and food in barrels should last much longer even if not refrigerated . 
  * a few different variants of some of the crafting stations . 
  like tier 1 = non-electric version , eg a wood-fueled stove or a more simple smithing table , tier 2 = electric versions with some bonuses in stuff like production speed and maybe even resource usage and item quality and in some cases additional crafting options and then tier 3 = very advanced versions that require a lot of power but are even better than the other two . 
  possibly the tier 2 and tier 3 versions could be bigger as well , like the tier 2 is like a 3x3 u shape ( the colonist stands in the middle ) and the tier 3 is like 3x5 . 
  for example , the tier 2 smithing station could allow the production of pistols , shotguns and survival rifles and the tier 3 the rest of the modern firearms .
