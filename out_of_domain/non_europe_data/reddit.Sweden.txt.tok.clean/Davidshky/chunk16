  then nerf it a little bit to decrease its effectiveness while mobile . 
  so in the end a moible skyguard would be maybe 20 % less effective than they are now but a deloyed skyguard is 20 % more effective . 
  after more thoughts about it , i think that recoil and reload time should be the only things affected by deploying but by a great deal . 
  also , while accuracy shouldnt be affected by the deployment , it should be reduced while moving . 
  then when deployed , stabilizers should reduce/remove the recoil and the autoreloader should be able to work at least twice as fast with no fear of roadbumps and other things that might shake the tank around . 
  was thinking the same thing . 
  i prefer her sweet and `` innocent '' with the exception of [ this ] ( http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lw1m1wi2nl1qauu1io1_1280.png ) scene . 
  [ you 're welcome ] ( http://www.planetside-universe.com/keyexchange.php ), 
  they must have run out quite recently then . 
  hopefully they 'll get more soon , either from players or the devs . 
  some sort of artillery/support platform . 
  think of it as a mix between a slow glasscannon and a sunderer . 
  big , slow , health of a lightning and very very expensive . 
  shows up on the map for all to see after firing too much . 
  its only defense is a 20mm mg because even when deployed it 's incapable of hitting things nearby . 
  inspiration , the [ archer artillery system ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/archer_artillery_system ), 
  capable of hitting bases outside the range of the turrets , and by `` hitting bases '' i mean hitting somewhere in/around the base . 
  rocket launcher :, 
  think of this as something like the [ us mlrs ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/m270_multiple_launch_rocket_system ) or the [ soviet katyusha ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/katyusha_rocket_launcher ) . 
  capable of unleashing a wall of hurt towards an area , but with a painfully slow reload time . 
  200-300mm mortar : inspiration , the [ churchill avre ] ( http://i5.photobucket.com/albums/y155/ultimate_raven/churchill_avre2_zps48b25f2d.jpg ), 
  for when the enemy has grouped 5 ams sunderers together behind a rock/wall and a swarm of infantry defending them like ants defending their queens , a few shells from this should dislodge them from their position , or at least make them rething their idea of bunching their sunderers together like that . 
  either a big missile launcher , or a big flak cannon like the german 88mm flak 36 . 
  long range , high damage , slow rof . 
  should be worthless against esfs unless they 're stupid enough to stay still in front of it but fully capable of keeping liberators and galaxies away . 
  shield generator :, 
  generates an umbrella/myshroom shaped shield above itself , stopping incoming liberator and artillery fire but provides no protection against direct fire . 
  air radar :, 
  something like [ this thing ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/98/55zh6me_long-range_mobile_radar.jpg ), 
  either a big proximity radar , detecting enemy aircrafts in a fairly large radius around the vehicle or something the driver must aim manually but automatically spots aircrafts withing the cone and range . 
  unfortunately it also reveals the vehicle to all enemy aircrafts within this radius/cone . 
  i remember that as well , and as a 21 y/o with receding hairline, 
  please please please be true . 
  pretty please with a cherry on top :(, 
  there has to be something that he 's missing . 
  i play vanu and i usually feel that vanu has the best guns , at least in the carbine and lmg department . 
  do vs have lower recoil than the other races ? 
  is he wrong about the damage stats ? 
  there has to be something wrong , because this study implies that vs has the worst guns for all classes . 
  but ingame this doesnt seem to be true at all . 
  we need aa to be rebalanced so they all counter different targets in different ways . 
  max bursters and ha launchers should be the emergency aa for when you do n't have a vehicle spawner or base turrets but are still getting attacked by hostile aircrafts . 
  not that effective but capable of preventing aircrafts from totally dominating infantry . 
  skyguard should be the escort aa . 
  mobile but with limited range . 
  any esf doing a strafing run towards the skyguard should die a quick death , and liberators in range should also die or at least be chased off but anything keeping its distance should barely take any damage . 
  should also be pretty effective against infantry and light vehicles . 
  base aa guns should be the no-fly zone gun . 
  anything that attacks a base before ground forces have taken out most of the aa do n't would have to be very lucky or very skilled to survive . 
  then lastly , we need a mobile heavy aa . 
  something with a slow turning turret , that sucks against esfs but will have no problem taking out liberators or galaxies . 
  something like a new 100mm gun for the lightning . 
  you might be right about magrider vs vanguard , but i havent seen a vanguard with a shield in almost a week . 
  for me it has mosly come down to distance and luck . 
  in short range battles i feel the vanguard has the advantage because of the turret , but at medium and long range the strafing ability of the magrider makes it extremely hard to hit . 
  and unless they 've changed it since i played tr , the scythe is more manouverable and i prefer it in both dogfights and for attacking ground targets . 
  tech and time progression is at marathon speed , everything else is at standard speed . 
  this way you have time to actually experience each era before the next one comes . 
   scythe maneuverability-advantage was removed early in the beta . 
  it 's about the same as the others , with slightly more strafe . 
  well that sucks . 
  it really should have an advantage in pitchin , rolling , vertical movement etc , but a very small one . 
  and after all this i 'm starting to wonder if maybe vs is kinda bad and it 's simply me being good . 
  i want an ftl/dwarf fortress/evil genius hybrid . 
  manage a ship with hundreds of crewmembers ( that you can put in groups for easy management ) , deal with things like food , ammo , morale etc. 
  not only different types of weapons but also different shield generators , life support , engines etc etc , all having variation in stats . 
  for example . 
  performance : for a shield this would be the shield hp and shield regen . 
  durability/repair : how much damage it can take , how easy it is to repair . 
  safety : what happens when it breaks ? 
  does it flood the room with radiation or does simply stop working ? 
  operational safety ? 
  is it safe to use even when not broken ? 
  is there a risk it might give someone a small electric shock or outright turn them into a pile of ash ? 
  and finally , no end goal . 
  you play till you lose , and losing shall be fun . 
  a white moose cow with her equally white calf , standing in a small clearcut area in v\u00e4rmand , sweden . 
  [ here ] ( http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=78516377&amp;searchtext= ), 
  i agree that burster max should be to chase of enemy aircraft rather than obliterate them , but i 'm not sure that a aa missile would be the right way to fix this . 
  but while we 're on the topic of homing missiles , they should give back the factions old aa guns rather than give veryone the burster . 
  i want my vanu missile spammer of death . 
  imo , the real issue is that the max at weapons are so incredibly weak . 
  they 're not supposed to be efffective at range and tanks do quite often get within range when attacking bases and outposts , its just that they can retreat long before a max would kill them . 
  awesome idea , but this sounds like something the nc should have since it 's pretty much their unique max ability from ps1 . 
  sounds like a big version of the tf2 sniper , so no thanks . 
  as i 've been saying in several threads about aa , we need a heavy mobile aa gun . 
  give the lightning an aa version of his 100mm guns . 
  something with a slow turn radius so it ca n't do shit against esfs but capable of doing some serius damage to liberators and galaxies at long range . 
  that way we have a counter to liberators even if the skyguard and burster become fairly uselss against them . 
  this means that sweden is a 3rd world country , which just feels wrong . 
  also , i get the feeling this will show up in / r/todayilearned very soon . 
  maybe not that fast , but when you have a few thousand soldiers with muskets the combined rate of fire would be high enough to compensate for this . 
  nope , it should guard against things from the sky , not guard the sky itself . 
  what i 'm suggesting is that we turn the skyguard into a short range aa that specializes in taking out esfs attacking its position and low flying galaxies + liberators . 
  then we add another aa gun that 's not very good against esfs but very good at taking out liberators and galaxies at long range . 
  this way we can nerf skyguards and fix liberators without the latter becoming an unstoppable rain of death with no counter . 
  infiltrators should have smgs instead of the shotguns . 
  longer range but much less damage . 
  kinda like a weaker carbine . 
  would also give the supressor a reason to exist .
