   [ they 're adding tau ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3alwkeseys ), 
  ftfy, 
  yeah this is something i 've wanted since the beta . 
  what makes it even worse is when ships that are obviously supposed to use front engagement ( like ork escorts ) are on the broadside setting by default . 
  the olympics have allowed trans women to compete as women for like a decade as long as they had been on hormones for two years and had had the genital reconstruction surgery ( though this is no longer a requirement ) since they apparently found that trans women did n't have any major advantage and since we so far have n't seen a bunch of trans women dominating the last two olympic games i assume they were right . 
  personally i would recommend using them at short range but you can often fire one salvo at long range and have the nova cannons ready to fire again before the enemies get too close . 
   i 've afraid of firing shorter range shots that might smash my own fleet with unlucky rng . 
  that 's pretty much impossible since the nova cannon has a minimum range of 6k . 
  you can find the stats of their ships [ here ] ( https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0b-axa8fc5aq8fmpvuetsb1ixcdm5m2pbzjvgcfm5mtlwejvqvkt4vxzzx3e1ywq0oer5vnc&amp;usp=sharing#list ) in the bfg rulebook - armada.pdf, 
  i guess we might also get the [ vanguard cruiser ] ( http://wh40k.lexicanum.com/wiki/vanguard_cruiser ) . 
  basically it looks like they 're gon na be a heavily armored variant of the in with a bigger focus on short range combat and boardings . 
   like battlebarges , strike cruisers do not represent a single class of vessel , or specific configurations of weapons and systems , but rather represent a broad range of different space marine vessels used for largely similar tasks . 
  i guess this would also mean that they could get a bit creative with the space marines ships . 
  ** edit : ** just noticed something after looking at their ships , their escorts are pretty damn fast . 
  the gladius class frigate have 30 cm speed which translates to 225 speed in bfg : a. 
  every 5 cm speed in the tt is basically 37,5 speed in bfg : a. 
  but the hunter class destroyer and nova class frigate , their equivalents of the cobra destroyer and firestorm frigates has 35 cm speed which would be 262 ( !!!!!! ), 
  in bfg : a, 
  but not only that , the lance weapon on the nova cass apparently has a 270 degree firing arc . 
  spess muhreen escort spam here we go !, 
  i will drink delicious chaos tears as they 're hunted down by the nova frigate of doom . 
  their favors might be other sm chapters . 
  i think the imperial fists will be the default since they 're in the campaign and the launch trailer and the adeptus astartes favor for the in makes their ships yellow . 
  according to the pdfs i linked the sm escorts only have 5 + armor so they should only get 50 armor in bfg : a but tbh 6 + ( 75 ) would be pretty insane . 
  the blood ravens are also known as the [ bloody magpies ] ( https://1d4chan.org/wiki/blood_ravens#bloody_magpies ) that like to steal shiny stuff . 
  slaughter and carnage class cruisers are really good at mid/short range combat . 
  they 're able to defeat pretty much any imperial cruiser in a brawl as long as you can avoid torpedoes and rammings . 
  the slaughter is especially interesting since it has the speed of a light cruiser . 
  a fleet of both the imperial navy and space marines . 
  i actually kinda want her to win just to spite reddit after all this bernie and trump spam . 
  you can use the ship replacement button to change the weapons but you 'll lose any upgrades and skills on the ship ( you keep the favor , level and crew points though ) . 
  two guys that take turns with the oral and the choking, 
  [ she truly is the best mom ] ( http://i.imgur.com/6xywrk7.gif ), 
  some form of `` apprentice system '' for generals and agents . 
  we kinda got this in attila for generals but not for agents , and not in the way i imagined it . 
  when an agent or general has reached a certain age and level they should start getting apprentices . 
  eventually these apprentices should have a change of being added to the recruitment roster as a lower level copy of their master ( ie , if you specced the general in cunning the apprentice will also be specced in cunning , minus 2-3 levels ) . 
  for example a spy or assassin might have some companions they met during their travels , like a young orphan thief . 
  a geneal should have a whole staff of younger officers that could eventually become generals themselves if they show promise . 
   that song was the best thing to ever come from eurovision . 
  how can you possibly forget [ this song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfjhjnevone ) ? 
  maybe a rare event where you find a duplicate of your starting system , even if it 's a randomly generated system . 
  fanatic xenophobes , fanatic militarists and fanatic spiritualists all in one little renaissance age mushroom species . 
  edit : unfortunately these guys are n't in my territory so for the moment i ca n't enlighten them even if i wanted to . 
  i guess i could conquer the area and then give them some new colonies far away from me just to see what happens . 
  maybe they 're a [ clonal colony ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/clonal_colony ) so they 're all just part of one giant planet-wide mega fungi . 
  people have already linked some mod like that in the comments . 
  no mods . 
  primitives can get some of their ethics changed by events which is what i think happened to these guys .
