  silly idea , total war : civilizations, 
  randomized world map each campaign with a mix of different factions from many different eras , like the civilization games , but with total war gameplay . 
  they could still count it as a dlc even if it 's free . 
  personally when playing as the dwarfs i rarely really charge with my infantry and instead just continue to destroy my enemies with my quarrellers and artillery . 
  my recommendation would be to conquer your starting province asap and then turtle for a while until you have upgraded your settlements ( and their defenses ) and get access to better units . 
  also , learn to love the tunnel stance . 
  it lets you travel under mountains and underground battles are really easy as the dwarfs since you get a very long map map where you basically ca n't get flanked . 
  archers tend to stop firing by themselves when friendly units are kinda in the way , but if you just give them the attack order manually they will usually start firing , though i guess there might be some friendly fire . 
  a stationary compact blob of enemies makes a pretty nice target for your crossbow dudes . 
  though as the orcs i would avoid using archers against the dwarfs since they have stupidly high armor . 
  get some rock lobbers instead and later on doom divers if you want to attack the dwarfs at range . 
  the norscan tribes should get access to some more chaos units . 
  from reading the [ this wiki page ] ( http://warhammerfantasy.wikia.com/wiki/norsca ) i get the impression that they should at least have access to chaos warriors . 
  i also hope they add some more heroes in the future , like a dwarf slayer hero , a chaos cult acolyte hero ( or something like that ) and an orc big boss hero . 
  i can kinda accept the vc not having any ranged units , but the dwarfs not having any form of steam powered ground vehicles despite having helicopters makes me wonder what the hell they were thinking over at games workshop . 
  i 've had plenty of siege defense battles but that 's mostly because i usually do n't bother with sending an army to help as long as i 'm confident the defenders would win the battle . 
  their armored guys would basically be the elite of the norcan tribes so maybe there could be a limit of x chaos warriors per army or tribe so they ca n't spam them but still have access to some armored infantry . 
  * ai-rights advocates : empires that are like 90-100 % synths and really dislike factions that treat their own robot/droid/synth pops badly . 
  * proxy war militants : two neighboring fallen empires with completely opposite ethics that are locked in a form of cold war but compete with each other by occasionally aiding other factions that are at war with each other , depending on those faction ethics . 
  * `` peaceful '' invaders : will occasionally demand migration treaties with you to get rid of their undesirable pops with shitty traits and ethics , like repulsive rapid breeders . 
  i get the feeling that op should have been born in ancient greece or rome where he could have enjoyed some pretty catamites without being called gay . 
  well that explains wtf was going on yesterday . 
  i guess i might use some torpedo ships after all . 
  the light cruiser vandguard comes in 3 variants . 
  they all have 400 hps , 75 % armor , 225 speed , a 2 dps weapon battery ( 3x6/9 ) on each side and an ordnance bay with thunderhawks . 
  one variant has a 4x torpedo launcher , one has a 2 dps prow bombardment cannon ( 30/15 ) and one has two 1 dps prow lances ( 8/8 ) . 
  the strike cruisers also have 3 variants . 
  iirc they have 600 hp , 75 % armor and 188 speed . 
  all variants have a 6 dps weapon battery ( 4x18/12 ) on each side and a 3 dps bombardment cannon turret ( 45/15 ) . 
  one variant has a torpedo launcher ( i think it 's a 6x launcher ) , one has 2x ordnance bays and one has a 3 dps prow lance ( 24/8 ) . 
  yeah i expect some form of nerf for their homing ability soon ( like after x seconds they stop homing in ) , or maybe they could make them easier to destroy with the turrets . 
  according to a post here on reddit they 're currently bugged and do n't get their ap bonus . 
  apparently the devs knows about it so i guess it will get fixed soon \u2122 . 
  they are . 
  they have repeater rifles with twice the rate of fire of normal handguns so 60 outriders do 33 % more dps than 90 handgunners . 
  on top of that they 're just waaaaaaay more mobile and have vanguard deployment and the cost difference betwen outriders and handgunners is minimal . 
  i really hate this whenever i 'm defending against the greenskins during a siege . 
  all of the sudden some ladders just appear at the walls somewhere and a bunch of night goblins start climbing . 
  yes please , maybe with some form of stealth mechanic as well so it can be used as a sneaky intel ship during wartime and if you want to explore without getting contacted by too many annoying xeno factions . 
  the night goblins have vanguard deployment , can hide anywhere and they have poison arrows that reduces the targets speed and damage . 
  the strike cruisers batteries got a pretty nasty dps nerf though . 
   the macro-batteries damages have been reduced from 18 to 8 and its reload time reduced from 12 to 8 . 
  they 're armor piercing and anti-large so they 're my favorite basic infantry as the empire . 
  some unit ideas i got after reading the warhammer fantasy wiki . 
  * [ norscan bersekers ] ( http://warhammerfantasy.wikia.com/wiki/norscan_berserker ) some high/mid tier damage dealer infantry for woc and the norscans . 
  * [ mutated norscan berserker ] ( http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/warhammerfb/images/3/35/chaosheavyinfantry.png/revision/latest?cb=20150807172656 ) ( i need this ), 
  tbh i kinda just want to flesh out the norscans a bit more , especially since you 'll end up fighting them so much as most factions . 
  * some form of [ chaos cult ] ( http://warhammerfantasy.wikia.com/wiki/chaos_cults ) agent for woc . 
  like some form of corruption spreading assassin . 
  * [ veteran slayer ] ( http://warhammerfantasy.wikia.com/wiki/slayer ) . 
  basically an agent version of the dragonslayers and daemonslayers mentioned in the wiki . 
  would give me a reason to actually build the damn slayer shrine . 
  edit : some other ideas . 
  like quarrellers with less armor , more speed , vanguard deployment and some stealth bonus . 
  * some region/province specific empire units like the nuln ironsides just to make the different empire factions a bit more different and create more reasons to capture certain provinces . 
  this is something kinda silly i 've wanted for several total war games . 
  basically some form of horde mode campaign where you 'll have to defend a few cities against a never ending stream of enemy armies . 
  you 'll get to fight all the different factions and they 'll just keep getting better units with time and there 's no way to really win , you just have to last as long as you can and then brag about it or something . 
  yup , after the `` the world is round '' event you unlock some naval stuff that allows you to sail to the west . 
  discovering the americas and expanding the map . 
  yes, 
  yeah , though i guess that the groups of slayers are all new slayers or something that wo n't mind following an army in order to find some big foe to get squashed by . 
  imo they should get a big buff but be reduced to the same unit size as irondrakes . 
  like a dwarf infantry equivalent of demigryph knight . 
  [ kislev seem to have some unique stuff ] ( http://warhammerfantasy.wikia.com/wiki/kislev#military ), 
  though it looks like they mostly use [ this rpg ] ( http://khorne.ru/2nd/wfrp_web/realm_of_the_ice_queen.pdf ) as their source . 
  anyhow , some kossar variants could give them some basic infantry types like axe + shield , great axes , and bow infantry . 
  not that different from the empire but it 's something . 
  the streltsi could be interesting with both handguns and pole-axes which should make them pretty good in melee and maybe a bonus vs large . 
  horse archers would also be kinda different from pistoliers and outriders . 
  then they would have the winged lancers and their elite variant , the gryphon legion . 
  at least it 's something and a bit more interesting than an empire clone . 
  this is probably it , but i kinda wish we could get an option for ranged empire captains or something in the future . 
  altdorf might not have been the best example but you can build mage colleges and similar buildings in other cities . 
  it 's not that i think the cities really need garrison heroes , but it would make siege battles more fun if you could have some hero leading the defenses , dueling the attackers lord or spamming various abilities around . 
  looks like you found the `` good twin '' of [ these guys ] ( http://imgur.com/6v4bzly ) i found a few months ago . 
  more hero types like the orc big boss , some form of veteran slayer and maybe a chaos cultist . 
  i also wish we could get some different weapon type variants for the different melee heroes like the captain and thane . 
  like a greatsword captain that has better offensive stats but worse defense and maybe a captain with a repeater rifle that has slightly worse melee stats overall . 
  the norsca tribes should get some new units so they do n't just spam blobs of marauders ( though their armies should still mostly be shitty marauders ) . 
  from what i 've read they should kinda have access to chaos warriors though they call them huscarls and the lore mention norsca berserkers which i think would make a pretty interesting unit for both the norsca tribes and the woc . 
  just look at [ this picture ] ( http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/warhammerfb/images/3/35/chaosheavyinfantry.png/revision/latest?cb=20150807172656 ) of a `` mutated norse berserker '' . 
  ok , i based it on [ this page ] ( http://warhammerfantasy.wikia.com/wiki/norsca ) with this line . 
   aside from the hundreds of chaos warriors ( huskarls in the norscan lexicon ) forming styrbjorn 's elite warriors ... 
  and from what i 've read some norscans can get their hands on chaos armor . 
  they should also get the page about the support skills for the army/nearby troops . 
  not only are the gorebulls monsters in melee but they 're also really good `` officers '' . 
  probably because it is new and ca has learned how to make the heroes skill-tree more interesting since the release . 
   the night goblin fanatics should be amongst the most fun units to use , but currently stand out as unpopular choices in a greenskin roster that is otherwise full of viable crazies . 
  it takes balls to be a night goblin fanatic . 
  we want to reward this bravery by making them a bit more predictable . 
  imo they should just give the units a `` launch fanatic '' ability with limited amount of uses . 
  some vortexes also count , like the fire skull thingy . 
  how exactly does the witch hunters accuse ability really work ? 
  i mean , how can you physically hurt someone by accusing them of something ? 
  or do they do something like [ this ] ( http://cdn.duelinganalogs.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/digfinal.png ) against their target and hurt them through embarrassment/shame ? 
  yeah i also thought it was a station somewhere in the stockholm region and found it amusing that you were in fact a swede . 
  personally i relied on either merging + recruiting new units to replace my losses or using the replenishment bonus from the moon events . 
  and with all the money you get from looting settlements you do n't really have to raid that often . 
  personally i would n't mind at all as long as it fits with the lore .
