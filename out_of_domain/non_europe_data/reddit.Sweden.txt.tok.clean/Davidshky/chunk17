  this was [ posted ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/11tatg/amazing_piece_of_artwork/ ) 4 days ago , then [ posted ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/11vz8i/star_trek_the_original_series_by_dusty_abell/ ) again 2 days later , and then [ again ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/11xz2y/star_trek_tos_in_one_piece_of_art_xpost_from/ ) after that . 
  and i 'm pretty sure i 've seen it before with more comments . 
  and now this ... 
  was gon na suggest the same thing . 
  before lowering the volume everyone sounded like the [ hecu soldiers ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlwuhoeyhlc ) from half life to me . 
  but with the volume at about 60-70 % people just sound like they have a cheap microphone . 
   scythe default and ** rotary nose cannon ** projectile speed increased, 
  if rotary nose cannon = hailstorm , then yes !!, 
  yes !!!, 
  yeeesss ! 1 ! 111 !, 
  i already love it , and with faster projectiles it will be even easierto hit things . 
  probably wo n't change its effectiveness against ground targes much but it was already op against that . 
  would i get 100k points from soloing bronze or would i have to step up to silver ? 
   ** would of **, 
   genders and sexualities . 
  i do n't know about you but i 'd be perfectly ok with a lesbian james bond . 
  just because of this i had do dig up [ this ] ( http://furiousmiles.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/1213-e1325825528425.jpg ) picture again . 
  i hope you all enjoy . 
  edit : found [ more pictures ] ( http://www.flickr.com/photos/74226795@n06/7500734976/in/set-72157630418167682/ ) of her . 
  though with a wig this time . 
  i think it 's pretty clear they simply do n't want [ eddie izzard ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtakvn6au48 ) in their group . 
  i do n't know her real name but she 's called cloudninja9 on deviantart . 
  unfortunately she removed her cosplay pics some time ago but you can still find most of themwith google . 
  20 % less damage iirc . 
   bolt action rifle : sooooooooooooo much better than the standard tr sniper . 
  if you play infil a lot , especially if you often find yourself at long ranges , get this . 
  same for vs , and with the lack of bulletdrop , sniping has become ridiculously easy . 
  mossy is 20 km/h faster than the scythe and reaver , 220 vs 200 , not counting afterburner or using spacebar . 
  while this will probably be balanced , when it comes to the standard weapons , nc has the best sniper , tr the best pistol , vs the best lmg . 
  then it 's pretty much a draw between the factions carbines and assault rifles though personally i prefer the vs ones due to the low recoil . 
  then when it comes to vehicles , the nc has the vanguard tank that 's pretty much your basic lump of metal on caterpillar tracks . 
  55 ish km/h , big cannon , pretty much the mbtg from bf3 . 
  the tr have the prowler tank , with cannons that both deal about half the damage of the nc cannon . 
  fastests of the mbts with +60 km/h speed . 
  usually concidered the worst tank at range but can murder infantry at medium/short range better than the other tanks . 
  vs has the magrider , a hovertank with no turret but the ability to strafe . 
  the special ability is a speed boost doubling your speed to 100km/h for a few seconds . 
  is often concidered the best long range tanks because it can strafe around to avoid fire while having its front armor towards the enemy . 
  when it comes to aircrafts , trs mosquito is 20km/h faster than the others and seem more manouverable , has the highest dps but will run out of ammo faster . 
  the vs scythe is supposed to be more manouverable but i 'm not sure what its bonuses actually are nowdays , could be vertical speed but i ` mnot sure . 
  the nc reaver is the most durable , has the lower rof but higher damage per shot so the ammo last longer . 
  supposedly has the best afterburner . 
  the aa weapons has to be divided into different roles . 
  bursters and ha launchers should be the emergency aa , for when you have no access to skyguards and baseturrets . 
  bursters for short range aa protection , preventing enemy esfs from simply strafing you all to death , but not to outright kill it in a few seconds . 
  pretty much just reduce the range/accuracy and to some extend , the damage or rof . 
  ha launchers for keeping enemy liberators at bay and hurt.ing enemy galaxies at long range . 
  not that effective , but cheap and capable to hit things a burster ca n't . 
  should remain mostly the same , possibly with a longer lock on range but slower lock on . 
  then we need some dedicated aa , skyguards , base guns and imo , a new gun for the lightning . 
  the skyguard should fill the same role as the max but better . 
  completely destroying any esf attacking its position and capable of forcing low-flying liberators to retreat . 
  faster , more durable and higher dps than the max , but more expensive and unable to hide inside buildings . 
  like the burster it should get a range/accuracy nerf to prevent it from killing enemy aircrafts several hexes away while still being capable of defending its own position . 
  base turrets should be the real `` no-fly zone '' guns . 
  any aircrafts attacking a base before ground forces have taken out most of these should die a quick and painful death . 
  should remain the way it is . 
  then i think they should add a 100mm aa gun for the lightning , with a slow turn radius and the same rof as the other 100mm guns . 
  something that ca n't do shit against esfs due to their speed but very dangerous against liberators and galaxies . 
  think of the german 88mm flak 36 . 
  slow but with high damage . 
  then i also think skyguards should get a minor buff in its anti-infantry capabilites . 
  at least give it the ability to aim low enough to protect itself . 
  iirc think it 's because the reegar does n't really have special projectiles . 
  it fires a stream of hitscan bullets hidden within the big muzzle flash . 
  indeed , they 're my greatest fear when driving a magrider . 
  strafing do n't do shit against those things . 
  and tbh , the normal launcher need a big fat buff , more damage and/or speed . 
  i was expecting her to take of a wig and turn out to be a guy . 
  i 'm both sad and happpy i was wrong . 
  well i gues we could use our imagination . 
  then i hope you enjoy [ this ] ( http://kunai-master.deviantart.com/art/rapunzel-cosplay-tangled-210165457 ) picture as well . 
  as someone who nowdays uses his skyguard more than any other ground vehicle . 
  nope , nerf this shit . 
  most pilots die long before they see where i am and even if they are able to locate me and reveal my position to the rest of their team , i am either really fast , or really tiny plus i have fuckhuge range and can just stay behind friendly forces . 
  skyguards and bursters both need a range/accuracy nerf so they can only protect their own position and whatever is in that place , not the base several hexes away . 
  all this would accomplish is , tanks would now have no aa escort + skyguards would still be able to just sit somewhere and turn several hexes into a no-fly zone . 
  not only that , but this would make skyguards even less rone to be near the frontline and instead just camp on hills or near the ammo pylons in bases . 
  with a range/accuracy nerf they would instead have to be on the frontline , in the heat of it , to actually accomplish anything . 
  as i 've suggested in other threads , if they nerf the range of aa ( which they should ) , they should also add a new aa gun for the lightning . 
  an aa version of the 100mm gun . 
  something with a slow turn radius and low rof , but fairly high damage and very long range , so that it can use it against high-flying libs , galaxies and to some extent esfs , but not at all against low-flying esfs and not as good as a skyguard against low-flying libs and galaxies . 
  do n't forget the defense drone !, 
  i would like to see a class with defense drone , defense matrix and some offensive tech power . 
  a short range engineer/sentinel . 
  place faction colored neon-lights on all vehicles , yellow for nc , red for tr and purple for vs. 
  that way we can easily tell what team a vehicle is on , even with camo or in low-light conditions . 
  if q worked all the time i would agree with you , but it does n't . 
  q is unreliable as hell and many times have i suffered for it . 
  krogan with, 
  * armor power, 
  * bloodlust, 
  use ballistic blades to stagger everything , then begin the rage + bloodlust massacre . 
  krogan with, 
  * tactical cloak , but with shotgun damage bonus . 
  * armor power, 
  * shadow strike , with his head . 
  come out of nowhere and start shotgunning/meleeing stuff to death . 
  * defense matrix, 
  * some sort of anti-shield/barrier power that fires a continuous cone of electricity .
