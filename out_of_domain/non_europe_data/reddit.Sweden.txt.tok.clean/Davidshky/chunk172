  eternal guards can become pretty tanky though . 
  one tech gives +20 armor for all elves , you can get +12 armor from the lord skills and one of the council positions you can unlock gives +20 armor for eternal guard units in that lords army . 
  that means that one of your lords can have eternal guards with a whole whooping 92 armor later on . 
  you mean [ these ? 
  ] ( http://whenc.totalwar.com/#/building/wh_dlc05_wef_outpost_slaughter_1 ), 
  i 'm like 99 % sure they 're supposed to stack , otherwise they would be pretty useless and iirc the devs did mention stacking them somewhere . 
  it says +20 % armor but it gives +20 armor units . 
  one thing i wish they did when it comes to the lore of metal is replacing one of the buff spells with `` enchanted blades of aiban '', 
   enchanted blades of aiban, 
   grants a unit a hit bonus , armour piercing , and magical attacks . 
  this dramatically increases the damage output of any unit , for either close combat or shooting , against pretty much any target . 
  there 's not really that much to say about this spell : it 's great , you should use it . 
  magical armour piercing sword masters hitting on 2s are pretty cool . 
  so a bonus to melee attack and accuracy , should convert some/most/all normal damage into ap damage and makes the attacks magical . 
  imagine using that on a helstorm rocket battery, 
  i would say that orc boyz with spears are also kinda missing though they 're not really necessary . 
  apparently the swedish armed forces have mostly shared showers ( some have shower curtains ) and from what i 've read no one gives a shit after the first few weeks . 
  i hope they go for the last option and give us the brute ( i think that 's what it was called in the campaign ) with the quad rocket launcher as a flying rocket spammer while the northstar is turned into a better sniper . 
   contrary to popular belief wrs are not anti-monster units . 
  that 's mostly because they do n't have their special bonus from tt . 
  they 're supposed to be the we anti-large ( or well , scary , but large units tend to be scary ) unit but because they lack this bonus they do n't function the same . 
   guardians of the wildwood : if a model with this special, 
  rule is in base contact with at least one enemy model with, 
  either the fear or terror special rule , it has + 1 attack . 
  the space police ~ ~ at ~ ~ from some glitterworld catch a trader ship filled with drugs and find out you 're the source . 
  then they launch a raid to get rid of you rather than just chase traders all day . 
  and maybe instead of a raid they could sometimes drop incendiary bombs or agent orange or some other nasty shits from orbit on all your growing zones . 
  you 're right . 
  maybe they 're originally from a glitterworld sent out to patrol a rimworld and deal with stuff . 
  though tbh a local rival drug cartel as someone suggested would make more sense . 
  ** shinsekai yori ( 1-25/25 ) **, 
  [ spoilers ] ( / s `` i absolutely loved it but it also made me pretty damn depressed . 
  things just got darker and darker throughout the entire show and ended with death and misery . 
  i was especially disturbed by the fate of maria and mamoru . 
  when they left the village i expected them to eventually return and when the queerats were helped by a human i assumed it was maria ( mostly because of sakis comment in one of the earlier episodes ) but then the show went `` lolnope '' and the villain turned out to be their daughter . 
  and despite all the horrible shit that happened i can still empathize with both sides in the conflict . '' ), 
  oblivion, 
  it 's [ haku ] ( https://www.google.se/search?q=naruto+haku&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=940&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewiwtfkjw6jrahvc6cwkhsrydywq_auibigb ) who is a very very pretty dude . 
  i 'm hoping for a slayer dlc/free-lc at some point that add the various missing slayer units like slayers with great weapons , giant slayers , dragon slayer heroes and maybe daemon slayer lords . 
  made your shitty wall of text a bit more readable for you , 
  * peasants need a nerf , and their knights need a buff, 
  ** beastmen **, 
  * gor herds could use a little buff, 
  * malagor need some buff, 
  * rune lord 's rune of wrath and ruin could use a nerf , a longer cd or a charge limit per game or deal less damage, 
  * organ guns need some buff, 
  ** empire **, 
  * greatswords need some help in single player , they are worse than halberds because the honest steel skill ,, 
  * gelt , he is just useless in both sp and mp ,, 
  * pistolliers are just terrible, 
  * lore of life spells should not be healing steam tanks, 
  * helblaster volley gun is still useless, 
  ** green skins **, 
  * boar boys and savage orc boar biguns need a buff, 
  * nasty skulkers need a nerf, 
  * boar boy biguns need to lose some anti large while buff their weapon damage , because they are too good against heavy cav but do n't do enough against infantry, 
  * squigs could use a little buff , i think they are over nerfed a bit in the last patch, 
  * spider queens summons need a hard nerf, 
  ** vampire counts **, 
  * black coach is still worthless, 
  * kemmler need some help, 
  ** wood elves **, 
  * arrow of kurnos need a charge limit, 
  * wildwood rangers need a nerf to their weapon damage, 
  * more ammo for waywatchers, 
  now i want a hanzo skin that turn his ultimate dragons into those goofy chinese dragons . 
  just imagine [ this face ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/ee/73/64/ee7364211d454cb9d84ccd5e53d9bc64.jpg ) suddenly appearing through a wall . 
  imo it 's not that similar to the miranda . 
  it lacks the `` roll bar '' the miranda has . 
  personally i really really really hope they 'll eventually add something like [ this sexy beast ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/a5/51/3e/a5513e16520fcc909c160934fd1528af.jpg ) to sto as a t6 light cruiser inspired by the miranda class ( not some retrofit or temporal thingy ) . 
  yeah i was hoping the brets would get some really powerful cavalry bonuses in their red tree , like at least 15 % charge bonus and 18 ma . 
  when ca adds kurt helborg and/or grand masters in some future dlc it will be interesting to see if they have some major cavalry buffs and make the empire the masters of cavalry in the campaign , 
  you get lobi crystals from opening lockboxes and certain r&d packs during some events . 
  getting 800 lobi crystals will cost you a lot of zen or ec so you 're better off trying to save up enough ec to simply buy it from the exchange . 
  hmm , now i might actually have to get a set for the pewpew . 
  also , why are you using dual beam banks ? 
  from what i 've read this is pretty much it . 
  the who has decided to do some changes to the idc ( international statistical classification of diseases and related health problems ) so now sweden is updating their version as well . 
  it 's a `` love dodecahedron '' romance manga . 
  [ mal ] ( https://myanimelist.net/anime/32949/kuzu_no_honkai ), 
  i personally like it and the anime so far . 
  well it would be pretty nice to be able to put your outriders on the walls . 
  i 've been looking forward to this part ( ep 1 made me read the manga ), 
  the reveal of akanes motivations and the new unhealthy relation between ecchan and hanabi just makes all of this so much messier . 
  i love it !, 
  i also like how they manage to get really `` lewd '' without really showing much . 
  like the sex scene in this episode and the handjob in the previous ep . 
  mainly just sound and facial expressions . 
  also , for some strange reason knh makes me think of shinsekai yori . 
  they 're really not that similar but i guess it 's the whole `` calm yet unsettling and things keep getting worse '' thing they both share . 
  someone who can draw should make some tanaka-kun x kuzu no honkai crossover fanart . 
  i was thinking more like drawing them with each others art styles but your idea works too . 
  personally chinstraps make me think of anders breivik so i guess he sort of ruined it the same way hitler did with his mustache . 
  quark : i want you to try something for me . 
  listen to a bit of this . 
  garak : what is it ? 
  quark : a human song , it 's called `` where my heart will take me '' . 
  garak : nah , i do n't know . 
  quark : come on , are n't you just a little bit curious ? 
  song : i got faaaaith of the haaaaaaaaaaaaaah !!!,
