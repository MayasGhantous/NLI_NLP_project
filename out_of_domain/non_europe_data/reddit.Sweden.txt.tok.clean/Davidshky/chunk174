   using giant slayers as the great-weapon units would be cool too . 
  personally i would like to see the giant slayers as a really small elite unit , sort of like the aspiring champions but with a big fat anti large bonus . 
  gw slayers could simply be a normal slayer unit with slightly lower md and no whirling axes trait . 
   teutogen guards could be a ror i suppose . 
  imo they should be a replacement for greatswords . 
  they have the exact same stats in tt except the tg have white wolf hammers and cost 12 points instead of 11 . 
  i believe there are much worse subreddits around , but t_d is probably the largest vile , worthless piece of trash subreddit . 
  possibly to stay true to the source material . 
  for example flagellants have both frenzy and unbreakable in the empire army book . 
  a poleaxe would have been perfect for them but apparently gw did n't think so . 
  it 's pretty much a halberd but it 's sort of an axe , so it should have been halal for dwarfs . 
  i thought that chad and possibly ride would die when i saw that shot ( though i was expecting a sniper ) but not orga . 
  i wish they could reduce their upkeep but increase the recruitment cost or something so they could potentially be worth keeping for at least a few turns . 
  tbh crossbows also had a really really low rate of fire . 
  smaller , weaker crossbows could fire relatively quickly but iirc the heavy crossbows with a crank could take almost a minute to reload . 
  also , apparently well trained soldiers in the 18th century could fire 3-4 rounds per minute , though i 'm not sure if it would be comparable to the muskets in df . 
  safari ! . . 
  well i do n't have any mods installed . 
  personally i want the shittier skills to get buffed/changed rather than the good skills to get nerfed ( though i guess there are some skills that are too good ) . 
  more mutual exclusive skills would also be a nice change though as long as all the options are equally powerful . 
  i was thinking the different variants could be in the same list but have some text/icon that tells you their type , like when you recruit a lord . 
  oh wait , are you talking about the multiplayer unit selection ? 
  i guess in that case some other method would be necessary . 
  i kinda forgot about this game having multiplayer . 
  also , we do n't need every possible weapon variants for every hero . 
  for example adding a greatsword and a handgun variant would be enough for the captain imo . 
  it would n't have to mean the list would get any more crowded than it is now , you would simply not have all the variants available at all times . 
  i 'm hoping they 'll show up in rebels in the future . 
  they would work pretty nice as dangerous opponents that are still relatively disposable ( since they 're faceless and all that ) unlike named characters that usually wo n't die until a season finale or something like that . 
   adding another 7 variables on top of that will lead to you never getting the combination you want . 
  i never said we need every single possible variant , just a 2-3 per hero would be enough . 
  for example just adding a greatsword and a handgun variant would be enough for the captain imo . 
  and weapons that require or restrict the use of mounts would n't be necessary either . 
  yeah that would also work , some form of menu when you recruit a character with several weapon options . 
  what i mean with disposable is that they could be killed in like 1-2 episodes after showing up , unlike characters like the inquisitors . 
  i 'm thinking something like a royal guard showing up in some episode ( for some reason , like guarding someone important as you said ) , kicking the main characters asses a bit and basically establishing himself as a bamf but eventually getting killed at the end of the next episode in some difficult fight where the main characters have to gang up on him to win . 
   when 're we gon na see total war : future ? 
  you could totally pretend it 's historical , but in the future . 
  total war : post-apocalypse, 
  set in the future but most technology is gone so we 'll end up with some strange mix of old stuff like swords and bows and new stuff like a salvaged plasma cannon that they 've attached wheels to and now use as artillery . 
   tactical commander seat , 7 weapons and 1 ** or fewer ** hangar bays will receive a heavy weapons slot, 
  so escorts without hangar bays should also get the slots , but not the giant tactical focused carriers . 
  i was thinking something more like [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/jaivan_cannon_2.jpg ) except the cannon is salvaged from a ship or some huge tank . 
  also , i really want something like the cannon in the picture as a ror . 
  a unit with just one huge cannon with insane damage but low rof and shitty accuracy . 
  i 'm imagining some form of africa themed beastmen faction [ down in the southlands ] ( http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/warhammerfb/images/6/68/800px-beastmen_map.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20131005205254 ) with elephant , rhino , lion and gazelle-people . 
  elephantmen archers with bows that are basically just tree trunks and the arrows are just smaller tree trunks . 
  and i would feel sorry for whoever discover the old worlds equivalent of australia and the beastmen over there . 
  he was in two episodes , but he was also faceless . 
  edit : also , he died in the damn season finale . 
  yeah i could n't find one on the map but there has to be some place similar where everything is extra dangerous ( unlike the rest of the warhammer world where everything is just really dangerous ) , they just have n't found it yet . 
   saltwaterohjesusaligatormen, 
  that 's basically the kroxigors ( though they 're crocodiles , not gators ), 
  i kinda want something like a school reunion ova so we can find out what happened to them afterwards . 
  i wish they were better in melee or that we at least could make them better in melee with some lord skills . 
  like the reiksmarshal and grand masters getting the equivalent of honest steel for cavalry if/when they 're added . 
  what about would ` f ? 
  [ s\u00e5 h\u00e4r ska proportionerna vara ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cf/sweden_flag_construction_sheet.png ), 
  has al bickham done the voice of any character ? 
  he sounds really familiar for some reason . 
  i 've always wanted some form of 360 degree torp launcher that fires the torpedoes vertically ( [ sort of like this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpu_rl7ncao ) ) and the upcoming heavy weapons could work quite well for it , though tbh i would like it if cruisers could use them because they would look cooler launching torp salvos like that ( imo ) . 
  maybe they could give the pistoliers some form of `` burst fire '' mechanism to sort of simulate their brace of pistols . 
  basically they would fire 6-8 ish shots ( dunno how many pistols each of them carry ) very rapidly followed by a really long reload time . 
  that way they could at least function a bit better as a hit-and-run unit . 
  femboys are n't convincing enough . 
  then you missed most of the interesting stuff . 
  ** spoilers **, 
  the main character basically goes insane because of the wp scene ( you hit some civilians ) and in the end it turns out he 's been hallucinating the things the bad guy said/did ( the guy was already dead at the start ) so he had someone else to blame for all the horrible stuff you did throughout the game . 
  it was probably because of [ operation lilla b\u00e4lt ] ( https://streamable.com/y7mlf ), 
  because with / r/place we had the ability to undo the stuff the trolls did . 
  afaik a down attack is when you do a heavy attack mid air . 
  your name can show up during ending e. 
  i think a 9s pillow could be nice but that 's because he needs a hug . 
  [ not a country but the european union has a very nice anthem . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo_-kobibg0 ), 
  agreed . 
  also , if they had really low firing arcs then they could possibly also add some larger ships that also have heavy weapon slots as their special feature and still keep it kinda balanced . 
  something like a dreadnought cruiser that comes with a heavy weapon version of the phaser spinal lance ( though iirc they did say no hw would use normal daamge types but oh well ) . 
  maybe make it a lock box/lobi ship with a giant spinal railgun with kinetic damage . 
  i think op might be mtf . 
   ** avoid high yield 1 at all costs . 
  ** the nuclear warhead inflicts a 10s cooldown no matter which rank of hy , but rank 1 ( bug ? ), 
  only increases the damage to just under 4000 kinetic . 
  hy2 doubles this to over 8200 . 
  including hy1 granted from concentrate firepower ? 
  cause i kinda wanted to use this weapon with a command cruiser ( or something similar ) and spam high yield torps while broadsiding . 
  they 're not too terrible in melee ( compared to swordsmen and other similar units ) once you get the +12 ma and md from honest steel and they have some fairly respectable firepower for a melee unit ( though they are technically a range unit with decent melee stats ) and on top of that they 're pretty fast and not too expensive . 
  tbh i wish she had some special ability while in pilot mode in ow . 
  imo it would kinda depend on how they look . 
  i mean do they look like [ buck angel ] ( http://media.winnipegfreepress.com/images/buck-angel.jpg ) or do they still look like a tomboyish female ? 
  the lizardmen will have access to javelin infantry iirc so soon enough we 'll be able to test this , 
  damn ... 
  so basically between ending c/d and e the remaining pods somehow hunted down and killed all yorha survivors . 
  that 's cold ... 
  i really want to know just much the pods knew and how much power they had since they kinda had the job to oversee the whole project . 
  they do have a unit named kroxigor and we all know that gor = beastmen . 
  would be a really cool ascension perk . 
  the ability to basically build mobile habitats with ftl capabilities . 
  instead of colonizing planets you just make a giant nomadic fleet . 
  you could also rp as the tyranids much better if you could play as a nomadic devouring swarm ,
