  i 'm honestly kinda surprised the mosin-nagant is n't in the game . 
  should be a bit more common than the kar98 in russia . 
  not only will i have pineapple on pizza , i will also have bananas , at the same time !, 
  banana , chicken , peanuts and curry is one of my favorite pizza topping combinations . 
  i was honestly trying to avoid combat by hiding but the game decided to bring the combat to me . 
  the merge of / r/anime _ irl and / r/traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns / continues . 
  would have , not would of, 
  [ revolutionary ( and clearly superior ) version ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xt0h3ze.png ), 
  he should also work at the brothel but serving female customers . 
   nobody whispers your name in the cold cold night for fear that you might appear before them, 
  i see you have n't met the ladies over at / r/gendercritical, 
  some evil mage tries to summon a demon but accidentally summons a waffen ss company instead that become a new nomadic faction .

  she could also be a slaaneshi [ keeper of secrets . 
  ] ( http://warhammerfantasy.wikia.com/wiki/keeper_of_secrets ), 
  * some form of robot/nanite based faction that tries to mindlessly spread and multiply and could potentially become a mid game crisis if left unchecked . 
  uses large swarms of weak ships . 
  * raiders/slavers that attack poorly defended planets ( especially pre-ftl species ) to kidnap like 1-2 pops before running back to their well defended base . 
  * some form of strong aggressive alien lifeforms that travel between systems without any ftl drives . 
  their fleets should be relatively powerful but you 'll get plenty of time to prepare . 
  exactly . 
  and if they all had their own unique little mechanics and features ( right now most of them just occupy some random system and do little else ) it could make each game much more different even if we ignore each species special technologies . 
  i guess , though imo all spaceborne aliens should have some events , including the old ones ( pirates extorting resources , space whale mating seasons , amoeba mass migration ), 
  i forgot that he = high elves and thought you meant a high explosive bolt thrower ... 
  i wish some factions like skavens and the dwarfs had access to mining when besieging a settlement . 
  mining is basically digging beneath the walls to make a part of it collapse . 
  so if you spend a few turns mining instead of building towers or rams you could end up with a few breaches in the walls ( though it should take more work per breach than building siege equipment ) . 
  it 's actually called mining which is not the same thing as sapping, 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mining_ ( military ), 
  they actually had mining in the old [ warhammer siege rulebook ] ( https://www.scribd.com/document/100197148/warhammer-siege ) and it kinda worked like sapping in older tw games . 
  though it would probably be easier to add it as an option together with building siege towers and battering rams . 
  i wish gw had been a bit more imaginative when they made the beastmen and added more stuff than mostly just goatmen , cowmen and horsemen . 
  ( hippos , elephants and rhinos would have been great for human animal hybrids ) . 
  imagine a unit of cassowary-men doing [ this rumble thing ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wb3bkhmxz4 ) causing fear and shit . 
  i want the glock 18 . 
  full-auto 9 mm pistol would be pretty nice in cqc . 
  i wish we could use our pistols when driving and maybe when knocked down so there 's some use for them even after you 've found a real gun . 
   why waste winds of magic buffing a unit when you can wipe 2-3 out easily with him !, 
  well i was suggesting it should be a bound spell so it would n't cost any wom but it would have a really long cooldown . 
  basically their leader came to the conclusion that the quran did n't actually say anything about trans people while it was totally clear that gays are haram . 
  would you rather have teeth for pubes or pubes for teeth ? 
  i 'm still hoping for some small dlcs for game 1 with the last missing units and characters . 
  ( [ ca please give me big stabbaz ] ( http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/warhammerfb/images/1/1c/savage_orc_boyz_%2812%29_-_big_stabba.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160806133314 ) ), 
  maybe if they add the huntsmen they could make a ror named after wulfhart . 
  in tt , if you had wulfhart in your army you could make one group of huntsmen monster hunters . 
  yeah there are a lot of missing lords and heroes for the game 1 factions . 
  not that we need all of them but there are still too many missing . 
  some examples, 
  * savage and black orc warboss . 
  the former would be really useful as long as it gets the same savage orc buffing skills as wurrzag . 
  * savage and normal orc great shaman . 
  * normal goblin warboss ( not really necessary imo unless they give it the gigantic spider mount ( bigger than the normal giant spiders ) ), 
  * normal , savage and black orc big boss . 
  i would really like the savage and black orc variants so the greenskins could get some really nasty melee heroes . 
  * battle wizard lords . 
  the empire has access to so many lores of magic but so far their only mage lord is balt . 
  * grand master ( knight lord ) . 
  give them a cavalry focused skill tree and they could be pretty interesting in the campaign . 
  like replace honest steel with a cavalry equivalent . 
  * master engineer . 
  i really hope this guy will be added . 
  they have access to hochland long rifles ( should have about 200 range in tww ) , pigeon bombs ( homing missile attack that can backfire ) and mechanical steeds ( fucking robot horses ) . 
  * daemon slayers . 
  are apparently not allowed to lead armies in tt but meh , they could still make an interesting lord option with some extra slayer buffing skills . 
  ( i 'm hoping for a karak kadrin dlc/fc with all the missing slayer stuff ) . 
  * dragon slayer . 
  anti large/duelist hero for the dwarfs could be useful for murdering monstrous units . 
  * glade captain , hero equivalent of the glade lord . 
  might be too similar to the waystalker but in tt the gc and gl could be upgraded with the different ammo types the we have access to ( they waystalker could not ) . 
  imagine a hero riding a giant eagle while spamming starfire or swiftsilver arrows .
