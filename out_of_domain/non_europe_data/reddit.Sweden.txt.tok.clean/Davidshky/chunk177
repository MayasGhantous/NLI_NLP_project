  imo the arch lectors already have enough flagellant-buffing skills , +12 % damage and speed , +30 % charge bonus and 50 % missile resistance are some pretty significant bonuses . 
  we 're talking about the skill trees . 
  her study only shows that trans people are still more vulnerable than the general population even after transitioning , not that transitioning increases the risk of suicide . 
  nah it 's more like serving pork to a jew or vegetarian without telling them . 
  i looked up the zoats and to me it sounds like they 're more associated with the wood elves than any other faction . 
  they live in forests and dislike greenskins and beastmen . 
  wood elves apparently seek them out to learn stuff about the lore of life from them and there are apparently tales about them aiding the elves against greenskins . 
  edit : they do look kinda similar to dragon ogres so they could probably use the same animation so it would n't require that much work to add them . 
  i guess they could work as some form of mercenary/ally unit for the wood elves if we ever get some form of mercenary/dogs of war dlc . 
  but most of the work they do they do for `` fun '' . 
  there 's no need for them to do it but some of them want to work . 
  iirc the only real work the people do are diplomatic and spy stuff . 
  i would suggest crooked moon then . 
  not having access to any orcs for most of the game makes it a pretty interesting campaign but once you 've leveled up skarsnik a bit and gotten his insane +36 melee attack bonus your gobboz become absolutely insane . 
  my main issue is that it 's pretty hard in the beginning when you do n't have that massive buff and have to fight a bunch of heavily armored dwarfs . 
  nooooooo !, 
  i was hoping for more news !, 
  when it comes to names my favorites are `` falling outside the normal moral constraints '' and the full name of mistake not ... ie `` mistake not my current state of joshing gentle peevishness for the awesome and terrible majesty of the towering seas of ire that are themselves the mere milquetoast shallows fringing my vast oceans of wrath '', 
  i guess i 've been a bit spoiled since their last 4 posts have been posted 13:00 gmt ( 15:00 for me ) . 
  maybe , but grace post history is all over the place , from mondays to saturdays . 
  and with so few days left i expected something today to satisfy my tw news addiction . 
  gelt is kinda decent now imo . 
  +10 armor for all units factionwide is a really nice bonus and the lore of metal is much better now . 
  he also starts with a unit of greatswords and a mortar which is really handy early on , especially against walled settlements . 
  we do n't know because ca and the streamers are blue balling us . 
   `` starts with a demagogue follower '' ( ?! ), 
  according to this wiki it 's just a +4 % horde income bonus for that horde . 
  unless ofc they 've changed that follower . 
  maybe they 've saved that for tomorrow , or a paid dlc later . 
  i know i know . 
  what worries me the most is that if this is the last flc then i ca n't hope for a karak kadrin faction led my ungrim since they ca n't really sell him again . 
  i 'm still gon na hope for a slayer dlc though . 
  maybe mousillon could get access to some of the bretonnian peasant units . 
  that 's nice . 
  now we just need the rest of the slayer units . 
  / u/grace _ ca , just some quick questions , iirc i 've heard that this will be the last flc ( y/n ? ), 
  but are you planning any more dlcs for tw : w1 ? 
  i know i am willing to give you guys money in exchange for stuff like a playable middeland faction ( with their unique units ) or more of the missing lords , heroes and units . 
  well since a lot of us will get the norsca dlc from preordering tw : w2 i think it will be pretty successful . 
   wait , if i got the norsca only , will i get a discount on tw : w2 ? 
  no idea but i would guess not . 
   i mean , if i already planned to get w2 , i could 've gotten the norsca for `` free '' ? 
  yeah and iirc they announced that even before we knew the dlc was norsca . 
  if you bought the norsca dlc on steam you should be able to simply get a refund instantly and then buy tw : w2 . 
  are the marauder units for woc getting updated with the rage mechanic ? 
  should n't they be the same for both factions ? 
  off topic but i somehow read the title as a skin wolf chariot and now i want that as a mount for the skin wolf hero . 
  i love using fcm . 
  if it was n't for the semi-broken autoresolve i would use them as my standard infantry instead of swordsmen or spearmen . 
  yeah their basic marauders really could use some lord buffs . 
  just a leadership bonus would help so much . 
  on the other hand you can buff your hunters and berserkers a lot and you get access to those really early so it 's not that bad . 
  the issue is that when you ar most of the damage seems to be distributed between your melee units and if you 're using fcm as your standard infantry unit that will result in your few remaining melee units like your lord taking waaaay more damage than they would otherwise . 
  i 'm mainly worried that they wo n't update the old world in the normal tw : w1 campaign . 
  for example the bigger settlements like they 've mentioned for the combined map . 
  the combined campaign map will probably have longer turn times so if i want to play as for example the empire or the vampire counts it could be nice to just have an updated tw : w1 map as a sort of focused mini-campaign . 
  maybe they could be limited to non-infantry units , 
  like a massive horde of marauder horsemen with a few mammoths and stuff . 
  maybe , but wulfhart was only a hero in tt and i think there are other characters they should add as lls before wulfhart , like marius leitdorf mad count of averland , kurt helborg the reiksmarshal and boris todbringer . 
  waystones on all the province capitals to deal with rebels and then either more waystones or sacrificial grounds on the rest of the outposts . 
  that would be the point . 
  you would see the aghol doomstack and go `` oh fuck no '' before they mongol your ass . 
  me too thanks . 
  i would n't trust anyone who 's interested in me , because they 're either lying or there 's something wrong with them . 
  personally i 'm not particularly interested in just monstrous units like that but i really really really want more of the missing units for the old main factions . 
  some examples . 
  ** empire **, 
  * huntsmen . 
  in tt they were archers with vanguard deployment but i think they could also be given an anti-large bonus in tw : w . since they have the same range as handgunners crossbowmen would n't become redundant . 
  [ and then make a huntsmen ror named wulfharts hunters . 
  * celestial hurricanum . 
  magical aoe `` artillery '' that give nearby units a melee attack bonus . 
  * master engineer . 
  sort of like the dwarfs equivalent but with the option to use a robot horse as a mount and the ability to use bombs strapped on pigeons against your enemies . 
  * handgunners/marksmen with hochland long rifles . 
  in tt you could give one guy per unit of handguners a hochland long rifle that had 50 % longer range and better accuracy than normal handguns . 
  the reason i think this could be added as a whole separate unit is because ca ha already done stuff like this with the outriders ( grenade launchers ) and nasty skulkers who were both limited to 1 and 3 per unit . 
  then there 's the whole damn middenland roster but i think that should come in some separateboris dlc while these units could be added to the empire with lets say marius leitdorf `` the mad cunt ( sic ) of averland '' as a new ll . 
  ** greenskins **, 
  * black orc and savage orc big boss . 
  the greenskins have three different variants of the orc big boss hero in tt and i think both the black and savage variants could be added to tw : w with the black orc bb being a more defensive oriented hero in terms of stats and buffs while the savage orc bb is the opposite with offensive stats and buffs . 
  * stone and river trolls . 
  stone trolls have magic resistance and scaly skin and river trolls have strider and anyone attacking them suffer a ma penalty . 
  all the god damn slayer units , preferably with a karak kadrin faction . 
  * daemon slayer lords . 
  basically like ungrim . 
  should imo have some more slayer focused skills , sort of like the arch lectors with their flagellant skills . 
  i also think ungrim should get more skills like that as well . 
  * dragon slayers . 
  the slayer hero . 
  glass cannon anti-large duelist . 
  good at assassinations and removing corruption ( with violence ) on the campaign map . 
  could maybe have some bonus to success when assassinating but also a higher risk of critical failure because a slayer wo n't just run away . 
  * giant slayers . 
  veteran slayers with much better stats but much smaller unit size ( like 24 on huge or something like that ) . 
  * great weapon variants of normal slayers and giant slayers . 
  in tt slayers had the ability to switch between dual axes and a great axe when not in combat so unless ca add that ability i think they should add gw variants with armor piercing but even lower melee defense . 
  i also think that only the gw variants should require the armory building so the normal slayers and giant slayers can be recruited as long as you have the slayer shrine chain buildings . 
  exactly . 
  the hunters need to be micromanaged to make sure they 're attacking the right target , facing in the right direction , not being obstructed etc etc.
