  think overload combined with cryo burst/ballistic blades and flamer . 
  * then some sort of anti armor power , could be incinerate or flamer or something completely new . 
  unlimited powaaaaaahhhhhhhh **, 
  not only are they unreliable , but not really worth it when they actually do work . 
  not enough damage to destroy a tank even with 2 c4s , then there 's the problem of getting close enough to place it , and then to survive long enough to detonate it in a hot situation . 
  i usually just take the spawn beacon . 
   * [ new ] new combat system if you fire a weapon , someone fires a weapon near you , or a bullet/object impacts near you , then you go into combat . 
  during combat , `` abort '' is disabled . 
  if you alt-f4 / close anyway , your character is considered `` combat logged '' and instantly killed and leaves a body . 
   * [ new ] combat 30 sec timer . 
  i assume this means that combat ends after 30 seconds of no nearby gunfire or bullet impacts . 
  no idea . 
  if the zombie melee attack counts as weapon fire then probably . 
  otherwise , probably not . 
  my suggestion has been to reduce th range/accuracy of skyguards and bursters , and is till think they should . 
  but then also add a new slow aa gun for the lightning . 
  but if they 're gon na add faction specific aa tanks , then hopefully the latter would n't be needed . 
  my only fear would be that the new vehicles simply become stronger skyguards . 
  capable of shooting down galaxies , liberators and even low-flying esfs . 
  if they have a slow turn speed so they can only be effective at long range then i 'll have hope , but otherwise this sounds like it might just make the situation worse . 
  well the store has the compare option and i dont really see any reason to remove it . 
  doesnt bf3 have that ? 
  iirc , when you play as medic or support and aim at someone with low health/ammo and press q , you will call out something like `` have a medkit '' or `` here , have some ammo '' . 
  i also think the reverse was possible , aim at a medic/support and press q and you would say you need health/ammo . 
  at least we 're not danish !, 
  a skyguard on top , an aa lib hovering below and all gunner seats on all vehicles taken . 
  whoever does that should call themselves the [ deff skwadron ] ( http://www.cold-moon.com/40k/deff%20skwadron/warhammer_40k_deff_skwadron_gn_%28wapazoid_dcp%29_32-33.jpg ), 
  unlocks for the vs carbine and lmg . 
  spawn beacon and probably ams . 
  then it depends on how aa in general and skyguard in particular is after the wipe . 
  if it 's still op , then skyguard , if not , then hailstorm turbolaser . 
  good thing i 'm swedish \u1d98 \u1d52\u1d25\u1d52\u1d85, 
  i would recommend old man 's war as well . 
  kinda similar to forever war and also quite absurd , baby eating deers and the main character fighting lilliputians by stepping on them . 
  i mainly use it on the n7 engineer , and the vorcha soldier . 
  n7 engy first because the ammo dispenser counters the harriers main drawback , low spare ammo . 
  with the mag upgrade and stability or extended barrel , you can just sit behind cover and quickly deal with individual enemies , saving your grenades for larger groups . 
  the vorcha soldier ( and sentinel i guess ) because it allows you to get a few kills very quickly , giving you the vital health regen and allowing you to get in flamer/melee range . 
  +30 hp heal per turn to units inside or next to a city with the religion/pantheon . 
  op as fuck when defending . 
  i 'm just gon na assume you do n't have g&k . 
  it 's a religion pantheon you can chose . 
  there 's obviously only one way to find out . 
  you 'll have to [ ** read ** ] ( http://nerdfighters.ning.com/group/gamesworkshopnerds/forum/topics/deff-skwadron-full-comic ) the entire thing :d, 
  you can disable religion in the advanced settings and afaik , they did n't really remove anything . 
  how does the age of consent in sweden have ** anything ** to do with assange ? 
  unfortunately for you , karma police is already here . 
  take him away boys . 
  i was hoping they would merge doreah with irri 's `` special scenes '' [ season 2 ] ( / s `` but we could n't have that now could we !?!, 
  q ____ q '' ), 
  the fun thing about the hailstorm is that it 's supposed to be the anti-air weapon , but i use it primarily against infantry , light vehicles and base turrets . 
  the high rof is really good for strafing runs , the short reload time gives it a high sustained dps and the spread makes hitting infantry so much easier . 
  who the hell need rocketpods when you can just hose the enemy with plasma . 
  i guess i was wrong then . 
  it 's probably just because to me , they are southeners . 
   ** should of **, 
   liberators --------  ground-based aa, 
  hahahahaha !, 
  it should be a red arrow from lib to aa and a black arrow from aa to lib . 
  they should add faction-colored lights on all common pool vehicles until they come up with a better fix , like unique models or maybe a working spotting system . 
  red for tr , yellow for nc and purple for vs , like the tracers . 
  yes . 
  it 's quite hillarious to hack a turret , kill the guy as he 's ejected and then use the turret to wreak havoc . 
  this is very similar to my idea . 
  nerf aa maxes range and damage/rof so they work as a short range deterrent and not a mini-skyguard . 
  nerf the range/accuracy of skyguards so they can only protect whatever is near them and not several hexes . 
  but then add a new gun , to fill the long range aa niche , a 100mm flak gun for the lightning , good against libs , but with low rof and slow turn speed so a single esf could destroy these with ease . 
  kinda like, 
  skyguard = good short-range aa, 
  max = decent short-range aa, 
  100mm flak = good long-range aa, 
  ha aa launcher = decent long-range aa, 
  long-range aa --  liberators --  short-range aa --  esfs --  long-range aa, 
  i 'm not sure about vehicles with people still inside , but i 'm 99 % sure you could do it to empty vehicles if you had the right cert in ps1 . 
  i agree that the reaver flies like a shipping container with wings compared to the scythe , but just wait until you try the mosquito . 
  the damn thing makes both reavers and scythes look like some ww1 biplanes . 
  i 'm vanu so i havent used the vortek rotary , but if it 's anything like the hailstorm turbolaser , then it should also murder ground target without too much problem . 
  i once ran into a minor tank + infantry offensive near the terran bl-l4 crash site on esamir and i was able to kill several lightnings , get critical damage on a few prowlers and destroy the base aa guns just by strafing with the hailstorm . 
  and i did all that without the magazine upgrade . 
  well only nc has the vanguard and the magrider doesnt even have a turret so giving it a flak cannon would be difficult until soe gives us a magrider with one . 
  i also want the long range aa to be fragile so it can be easily killed by an esf and the vanguard is the opposite of that . 
  the flying stug iv, 
  there, 
  ^ i 'm ^ sorry ^ but ^ i ^ had ^ to . 
  or maybe just the lack of laser or foregrip ? 
  i honestly do n't think a fully loaded galaxy would give a shit about a single aa max . 
  this is sarcasm right ? 
  [ here 's ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/planetside/comments/12i3p2/vehicle_interaction_stolen_from_vg/c6v9n2h ) a different explanation i 've posted . 
  how about replacing the rockets with bombs ? 
  it would require a lot more skill to hit something and require the esf to practically fly right over its target , but in return , they would deal more damage than rockets . 
  rather than the esf being a frigging [ a-10 warthog ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fairchild_republic_a-10_thunderbolt_ii ) it would be more like a [ junkers ju 87 stuka . 
  it would be even better if they added the [ stuka siren ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcb8zvxkqyi ) to esfs with bombs . 
  i think a liberator would be both too big and too slow for an attack bomber role . 
  on the other hand , both the esfs and liberator could get iron bombs . 
  the esfs would get about 4 bombs , + -2 that deal enough damage to destroy an mbt ( without upgraded top armor ) if all the bombs hit ( which should be hard ) making it a very powerful weapon in the hands of skilled pilot , but fairly useless against anything but infantry and damaged tanks in the hands of a less skilled pilot . 
  then the liberator could get a large amount of bombs , enabling it to slowly carpet bomb larger areas . 
  should probably get an armor penalty to make it easier to shoot down . 
  no , the short for automobil ( e ) is bil - a swede, 
  maybe a significant rof nerf and a small damage nerf . 
  that way the ttk would be longer and the esf would have to stay in the area longer , making it easier to kill/chase it off with aa .
