  armor piercing melee and ranged attacks , anti-large bonus in melee and charge defense vs large . 
  i need it . 
  pretty much , but unlike the infernal guards we would n't have to wait for tw : w3 for the streltsi . 
  sure bear cav will be fun and look cool but i 'm still waaaaaaaaaaaaaay more interested in those shooty halberdiers . 
  yeah i did expect chaos to get some new units in the flc . 
  i also expected that the marauder units that woc already have would get the rage mechanic . 
  you forgot about the grand master lord . 
  another unit they could add are handgunners/marksmen with hochland long rifles ( ca please ) and maybe a repeater rifle variant . 
  they have stupidly high dps even against non-large unit once you get the lord skill + the tech that increase their damage . 
  once they get some experience they get around 4 second reload time resulting in around 60-70 missile damage . 
  then add 15 damage per javelin when used against large units and it becomes even more insane . 
  and if you get the drake hunter banner they can reach 150-160 ( +75 vs large ) missile damage wich is higher than the base damage of a dwarf bolt thrower . 
  ofc with a 2 second reload time they will use up all their ammo very quickly but it 's totally worth it . 
  [ here 's an album with some of the stats i 'm refering to . 
  1 : was n't even aware of this but yeah it sounds really stupid . 
  3 : yeah this is rather pointless , especially with these shitty garrisons , otherwise at least rather weak armies might besiege you . 
  4 : yeah i also found it pretty useless but i get the feeling it could become useful on the combined campaign map with more factions , including some norscans in the new world . 
  5 : i guess ca want us to repeatedly sack the nearby regions or something . 
  6 : the gods of chaos work in mysterious ways . 
  my own nitpicks . 
  1 : too much unit variety in the garrisons . 
  forces me to micromanage/babysit too many individual unit . 
  really minor issue but it does get kinda annoying after a awhile , especially compared to other factions . 
  2 : no fucking hunters with javelins in the garrisons , at all ... 
  it 's the only good low tier anti-large unit they have and instead we get the axe variant . 
  3 : defeating a norsca faction leader lets you force them to confederate but ( afaik ) being beaten yourself does n't come with any extra penalties other than the usual troop/army losses . 
  if i play as norsca and my army led by wulfrik is beaten by for example surtha ek i should get some penalty imo . 
  4 : the generic lords skill tree locking all the other gods options when you choose one of them . 
  imo it should only lock the opposite god ( khorne vs slaanesh and nurgle vs tzeentch ) so you can spend more than 7 skill points for the lords personal combat skills . 
  5 : lack of skills that buff normal marauders . 
  most other units can get fairly big stat buffs from at least some lord but the normal marauders and their gw variant does n't and as a result i just do n't use them after the first few battles . 
  6 : the lord skill that buff marauder horsemen increase their melee damage rather than their ranged damage ( though the 3rd point give them a roof buff ) . 
  i 'm not even sure if this is on purpose or not . 
  maybe , but even when i devote my attention to microing a chariot unit it still tend to get stuck in the enemy infantry unit while the enemy chariots just drive through my infantry like some recreation of the 2016 nice attack . 
  yeah i ca n't see any chaos faction or a dark elf working together with anyone else . 
  i could imagine some form of dlc/expansion with new groups and maps though . 
  like 4-5 chaos characters fighting skavens . 
  that 's also something i 've been thinking about . 
  like maybe some more advanced random quests . 
  for example some randomly generated quest chains with objectives like , deploy hero here , then raid this region , sack a settlement and finally assassinate a character from faction x. 
   yo that poison item though was sick , ca n't remember what it was called . 
  you mean the weapon from the forest dragon ? 
  that thing is honestly like the most op thing in the game . 
  fucking hilarious when attacking a city and you just take out 80 % of the health of any units at the gate . 
  but yeah , more stuff like the items from the monster hunts but maybe not quite as powerful and not only as quest battle rewards . 
  i realize ca are somewhat limited by the official books and stuff but since they got to make norsca i hope they can take some liberties and add some more fun items . 
  just a few items with some bound spells or maybe some nasty effects like frostbite or sundering . 
  i hope they 'll eventually add dragon slayers ( + the other missing slayers ) so the dwarfs can have an assassin/duelist hero and have it available from the tier 3 slayer shrine . 
  then the dwarfs can get some payback and assassinate , or rather slay , all those damn greenskins and other grudgemakers . 
  but your posts barely contain any information , just names of units . 
  googled the pic and i think this is the artist ( ca n't read moonrunes so i 'm only 99 % sure ), 
   supposedly orcs and dwarfs can swap basic catapults as well . 
  i kinda wish more races could steal some pieces of each others artillery . 
  i know it would n't be totally lore friendly ( or like , at all ) but i still think it could be fun to use some stolen dwarf cannons as the greenskins ( imagine the grudges ) or any artillery at all as the vampire counts ( ofc with reduced fire rate from having an undead crew ) . 
  ** problem : ** information about melee attack speed is not shown ingame . 
  ** explanation : ** units in the game have a different interval between melee attacks but unlike missile damage it is n't shown anywhere in the game , only the damage per hit is . 
  ** possible solution : ** display the attack interval when hovering the mouse over a units weapon strength or display damage over 10 seconds like with missile damage . 
  ** example : ** spearmen with shields have an attack interval of 3.8 seconds but spearmen without shields have an attack interval of 5.7 seconds , which means their dps is waaaaay lower but their damage per hit is the same so in game it appears they do the same dps . 
  afaik the emperor edition is just the standard edition , so no dlcs at all . 
  they simply renamed the standard game after they reworked a lot of stuff . 
  or they get a different version that fires slayers with a significant anti-large bonus . 
  nope , it really does n't . 
  units with halberds also have lower attack speed so unless the target is heavily armored the spearmen with shields are better . 
  and oh yeah , chaos warriors with halberds have a decent attack speed of 4,2 while the chosen with halberds have an attack speed of 5,6 so the chosen actually have slightly lower dps ( it 's like 8 vs 7,5 dps ) than their inferior bretherens ( ofc all their other stats are better . ), 
  [ this wiki has the attack speed of all units if you 're interested ] ( https://oldworldwiki.com/ ), 
  this might be controversial but i would like the ability to acquire some non-historical ( or for tw : w , `` lore unfriendly '' ) units in the campaign through our alternate history shenanigans . 
  i mean as our campaigns progress we stray further and further away from history and i kinda wish that your technologies and unit roster could reflect that . 
  like you `` steal '' technologies , tactics or just good ideas in general from other factions . 
  rome in rome 2 was actually the main inspiration behind the idea with all their unit upgrades from all their military reforms and a fuckton of auxiliaries . 
  imagine if you could conquer greece and realize that pikes can be kinda useful at times and get the pike legionaries with the hedgehog testudo . 
  and when you play as the dwarfs in tw : w you can sometimes get an event about sharing the secret of their flame throwers with the empire . 
  imagine being on the empire side of that event and getting access to some new campaign only flamethrower unit . 
  [ triggered ] ( / triggered ), 
  fyi , if you press space there should be a menu to the right with the option to automatically make trees transparent/invisible where you 're looking . 
  yeah dwellers below is like the most evil anti-blob spell in the game . 
  it will take out about 80 % of any normal unit caught in the aoe . 
  it 's even better when you get it as a bound spell as norsca . 
  59s cd and no wom cost . 
  i just looked it up in the dwarfs army book and in tt their magic resistance gave them a bonus to dispelling spells rather than a damage resistance ( save ) . 
  so imo it should be a spell resistance rather than magic resistance , so it wo n't affect magic weapon damage . 
  imo you should play the dwarfs since they have some really powerful garrisons making it easier to defend all your settlements . 
  you are building the garrison buildings in every settlement right ? 
  yeah personally i consider the garrison buildings to be mandatory for every settlement except as bretonnia ( because their minor settlements get walls by being upgraded to lvl 3 even without the garrison building ) and norsca ( usually only worth it for the province capitals to deal with rebels ) . 
  it has been a while since i played the other tw games but iirc in shogun 2 you got larger garrisons by upgrading the main settlement building . 
  same thing in rome 2 . 
  in medieval 2 militia units did n't require upkeep when stationed in cities , up to a certain limit ( larger cities = more units without upkeep ) . 
  blame games workshop , because in the lore they 're a bunch of really stubborn bastards that basically refuse to use any melee weapon that is n't an axe or a hammer ( no idea why gw did n't give them any poleaxes though ) . 
  they 're honestly pretty stupid for a race that has steam powered helicopters . 
  a standard size spear would be much better than an axe or hammer in a cramped tunnel since you wo n't even need to swing it . 
  would you rather have teeth for pubes or pubes for teeth ? 
  most fun is probably the empire or norsca . 
  the empire has such a diverse unit roster only really lacking in the monstrous and flying departments . 
  you also get to fight almost all the different races since almost everyone kinda dislike you . 
  i like norscas unit roster with their berserkers and javelin spamming hunters and i love the monster hunts with their awesome rewards ( dwellers below as a bound spell ftw ) . 
  least fun is probably the dwarfs or the vampire counts . 
  as the dwarfs you basically just fight greenskins and once you get a decent army and fortify your settlements it 's fairly easy to just conquer all the badlands . 
  you 're also pretty far away from norsca so the chaos invasion usually does n't really bother you except for your northernmost provinces . 
  and i just have a hard time enjoying playing as the vampire counts . 
  yeah but they 've managed to create and adopt cannons , handguns , helicopters and other technologies during the last few centuries ( even though many are still grumpy or suspicious about it ) so a few dwarfs using some newfangled spears or polearms would n't be that strange . 
  i know they 're old and stubborn , but they 're so stubborn that they become kinda stupid .
