  ** reaver : shield . 
  ** pretty much the same as the vanguard shield . 
  temporarily protecting the reaver from damage . 
  could be on a timer or it could be more like the default ha shield and absorb an finite amount of damage before being disabled . 
  ** scythe : maneuvering thrusters/evasive maneuvers . 
  ** kinda like the magburner except for the scythe and able top be used in any direction . 
  when activated , the scythe would get a sudden and extreme speed boost , but not just forward . 
  let 's say the pilot is holding space and a , then the scythe would go to the left and upwards , if he 's holding control and s , it would go backwards and downwards . 
  should help scythe pilots do some extreme maneuvers to avoid incoming fire or get behind someone in a dogfight . 
  ** mosquito : assault mode . 
  ** this would be some sort of toggle on/off ability , taking maybe a second or two to toggle . 
  while active , the moquito would get a 50 % speed and agility reduction , but also a 50 % rof bonus . 
  this would be used when the mossy pilot needs to do a lot of damage in a short timespan and is willing to temporarily sacrifice his mobility . 
  comments and other ideas would be appreciated . 
  i got an idea som time ago after the removal of the auraxium resource , during some discussions about super vehicles . 
  the idea is basically to put auraxium back into the game , as an outfit only resource used for things like orbital bombardment , super vehicles , supply drops etc etc. 
  unlike current resources , it would be earned by active participation by the outfit members rather than a passive income from territory . 
  once ( if ) the mission system finally makes it to the game , it could be a major source of auraxium for the participating outfits . 
  let 's say a defend/attack mission is issued for a few bases , then auraxium would be awarded to the outfit for ( i dunno ) every y xp earned by an outfit member in a successful mission . 
  this would hopefully mean that outfits would clash over these specific bases as a way to get this resource rather than fighting over the crown for certs . 
  another thing auraxium could be used for would be if soe nerfs/removes instant action like suggested in [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy2piyj2mam ) video . 
  then auraxium could be used to purchase a temporary `` deploy '' button for the outfit , enabling it to do what they did in that video , but with a cost and maybe a 1-2h cooldown . 
  while this system would benefit larger outfits the most , there could be a lot of cheaper things that smaller outfits could buy with their auraxium , and with abilites like steel rain and orbital bombardment having outfit wide cooldowns , a rich outfit would still not be able to spam them constantly . 
  some things might have prices that increase with the amount of members in the outfit , favoring smaller , more active outfits compared to enourmous mass invite outfits . 
  comments and further ideas are appreciated . 
  currently we have two different weapon categories , scout rifles and battle rifles , that both more or less serve the exact same role , medium-long range combat . 
  the battle rifles are pretty much just a middle ground between the semi and full auto scout rifles in terms of damage and dps . 
  what this would do is enable has and engineers to use the current scout rifles and infiltrators to use the current battle rifles . 
  it wo n't really change the guns in any way ( though they really need a buff ) but it would give us some more options for different loadouts . 
  so unless soe are planning on giving us several new scout and battle rifles anytime soon , or rebalance the current ones in a way that would make them more different i think this would be a good change . 
  this is an idea i 've had for a while , and even suggested a few times but never made a thread about . 
  the basic idea is that soe should add a targeting ability that can be used against vehicles . 
  this ability would n't do anything like helping you aim , or assist with lock-on weapons or anything like that , but it would help you keep track of enemy vehicles . 
  most dogfighting games have something like this , helping you keep track of your target and even gives you an arrow poiting towards it ( should also be included here ) if it 's outside your fov . 
  the idea is that you 'd aim at a vehicle , and then hold q. 
  then a square/circle/etc would appear around your target , in order to help you keep track of it in the chaos of battle , even if it 's an esf you 're dogfighting or a specific tank you want to focus fire on during an enemy tankrush . 
  if there is a building or terrain between you and the target for x seconds you would lose your `` lock '' on it , to prevent this from being some sort of magical way of knowing where a vehicle is even if it 's behind a mountain or inside a techplant . 
  secondly , there should be a squad leader cert that would make you share your target with the rest of the squad/platoon , in order to coordinate fire against a specific vehicle without having to go [ full buzzcutpsycho ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmhqfrblsfu ) . 
  feedback and suggestions is appreciated . 
  this is a very simple idea i got recently during the discussions about vs design . 
  basically , each faction should get their own drop pod model , both because it would look nice and because it would make it easier to tell which faction is dropping in , especially during night . 
  * ** vs ** could get something like a man-sized cyan/purple oval ( or hexagonal ) shield bubble generated from a small pad they 're standing on . 
  would look more high-tech and sci fi than the current one . 
  * ** tr ** should get a black/dark grey sleek tube , with some red details and red thruster flames . 
  would fit better with the trs round design . 
  * ** nc ** would get something cuboid , like small repurposed industrial shipping containers , bluish grey with yellow details and yellow thruster flames . 
  possibly nc could keep the current pod design , though i 'd prefer something smaller . 
  additionally , each factions pod should have its own sound , to further help identification and make them feel more unique . 
  extra idea : maxs dropping in through instant action would n't get a drop pod at all but would simply land on their feet . 
  maybe there could be some faction colored braking effect so that a max drop would n't be stealthier than normal infantry . 
  been looking for information about when we 'll be getting the other factions equivalent of a weapon we 've bought with sc . 
  could n't find anything on the roadmap ( might be blind ) and the best information i got is [ ** this ** ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/planetside/comments/1apgor/account_wide_unlock_faq/c8zn0f7 ) month old post . 
  my friends are playing as both tr and vs but i have all my sc unlocks on my vs character making it less fun playing as tr . 
  so does anyone else know anything more about this ? 
  bonus question : does anyone know if the nvidia camo will become account wide as well ? 
  i know i 'm not the only one here that think bases need to be more defendable , so here are some of my suggestions . 
  ( i swear i did not see the frontpage thread until i had already written most of this ), 
  * ** 1 : doors **, 
  this is one of the suggestions i 've seen very often and is one i really agree with . 
  destructible and hackable doors should be added to bases and most larger buildings . 
  this would help defenders by allowing them not to guard every single entrance against enemies , but could also give a false sense of security since they might then be caught unaware if one of these doors would be hacked or destroyed . 
  doors should either belong to a faction or be neutral . 
  a neutral door opens for anyone while a door belonging to a specific faction would open only to friendlies . 
  hacking a door that belongs to an enemy faction should take maybe 5-10 seconds , maybe more , to make it neutral , and 30-45 seconds more to capture it completely . 
  the owners of a base would have a bonus when recapturing doors . 
  when a base is captures/defended , all doors would belong to the base owners . 
  doors should come in several types , let 's say light , medium and heavy . 
  main difference between the doors would be hp and how long it would take to repair . 
  could possibly also affect hack-time . 
  this way less important bases and buildings could have weaker doors while major facilites and important doorways could have heavier doors making them harder to break through . 
  a light door for example could be destroyed by a single c-4 or a few rockets , while a heavy door would require either several players , a vehicle or a ha with access to more ammo . 
  destroyed doors would require an engineer ( possibly a repair sundy ) to repair quickly , but if left alone they should be able to use nanites to repair themselves after maybe 5 minutes , same should apply to consoles and defense turrets . 
  this would mean that a base that have n't seen combat in a while would be perfectly functional and ready for use . 
  * ** 2 : defense shields **, 
  defense shields would be like a weaker type of the spawnroom shields , that would either give a damage reduction to people on the correct side , or have a finite amount of health , possibly a combination of both . 
  these could possibly be placed in some windows , doorways or other places that could need some extra protection . 
  but most of all in bunkers . 
  these would help defenders to survive a little bit longer , not be instakilled and generally make them a bit harder to kill . 
  third idea is that specialized defensive buildings should be added to the game , small bunkers/pillboxes with few entrances , like tunnels , elevators or ( heavy ) doors . 
  the embrasures would be protected with defense shields , since otherwise the defenders would probably be killed very quickly , most likely by infiltrators , since their position would be fairly obvious . 
  the bunkers should come in several different shapes and sizes , some designed for being placed in the open , some in cliffsides ( imagine a bunker in the cliff over the stronghold , only accesible through a tunnel and elevator ) and some inside larger facilites . 
  hopefully bunkers would allow smaller groups of defenders to hold their ground for a while against a larger attacking force but most importantly , provide protection against vehicles and snipers since these , at least from my own experience , tend to be some of the biggest threat to defenders . 
  on the other hands , if the enemies can get close enough or even inside the bunker , the defenders would most likely quickly succumb to grenades , shotguns and in the future , melee/flamethrower maxes . 
  these could have the unwanted effect of nerfing tanks even more by making infantry even harder to kill , but that 's another issue . 
  after some recent discussions about esfs , rocketpods , aa vs air balance etc etc i 've decided to refine one of my earlier ideas about a helicopter-type vehicle for this game . 
  basically , this aircraft would be a hybrid between the [ ps1 phantasm ] ( http://wiki.planetsidesyndicate.com/index.php?title=phantasm ) stealth transport and the [ ps1 reaver light gunship ] ( http://wiki.planetsidesyndicate.com/index.php?title=reaver ) . 
  the idea is that it should be an aircraft made for transporting small groups of infantry and provide some amount of short range air-support . 
  think of it as a hybrid between the blackhawk and mi-24 . 
  1 pilot , 1 gunner , 4 passengers . 
  the pilot would have access to some forward pointing anti-ground weapons and the gunner would have a nose mounted turret . 
  [ here ] ( http://imgur.com/a/0vbrp ) are two pictures of the ps1 phantasm with some ms paint stuff to explain what i mean . 
  * ** 1 ** this would be where the passengers would sit . 
  open doors for the passengers to fire out of the phantasm . 
  only primary weapons and pistols should be usable , that way we wo n't have has launching death from the sky nor engineers repairing the phantasm in the air . 
  doors should possibly be closable by the pilot , in case the safety of the passengers is more important than the extra firepower . 
  doors would also close when the phantasm cloaks . 
  * ** 2 ** main weapon position . 
  this is where the main weapons or cloaking device would be . 
  main weapons and cloaking device would take the same slot , similarly to the esfs fuel tanks and rocket/missile pods . 
  this would prevent phantasms to turn into an invisible murdermachine in the sky , something this game does n't need .
