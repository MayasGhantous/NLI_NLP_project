  * ** 3 ** secondary weapon position . 
  this is where the secondary weapon would be positioned . 
  there to provide some extra anti-ground firepower , even to cloaky phantasms , but not to fight of esfs like the guns on libs and gals . 
  * ** 4 ** wings should be moved higher up on the phantasm , this is just to provide more space for the doors to the passenger area without having to make the phantasm bigger . 
  main weapons, 
  * heat autocannon ( default weapon ), 
  this should be the default anti-ground weapon , decent against both vehicles and infantry . 
  lower burst dps than the rocketpods but with a larger magazine and ammo pool , giving it similar or higher sustained dps . 
  imagine a lower caliber version of the lightnings 75mm gun , with a larger magazine and higher rof but less damage . 
  this would be the anti-infantry main weapon . 
  fairly similar to the default weapon but with less damage in exchange for more aoe . 
  alternatively , the anti-infantry weapon could be something like .50 cal miniguns , doing no damage to heavy vehicles but quite dangerous to infantry . 
  once again fairly similar to the default weapon , but low/no aoe and most likely lower rof in exchange for higher damage . 
  none of these weapons should be even close to the damage of the current rocketpods but would instead have larger magazines and ammo pools , allowing the phantasm to keep on fighting longer . 
  all weapons should also have fairly short range , either through low accuracy , damage drop off or a combination of both , forcing phantasms to fight at short range to be effective unlike the liberator . 
  * cloaking device, 
  this is what makes the phantasm the phantasm . 
  could possibly be the default `` weapon '' , but i think it would be better as a 250 cert unlock . 
  would give the phantasm the ability to cloak but while doing so , the passengers and gunner would be unable to fire . 
  taking damage or going too fast would make the phantasm fairly visible , but otherwise it should be pretty hard to spot , especially against the sky . 
  unlike the wraith cloak for the flash , this cloak should have infinte energy , let 's say because the phantasm has a better power supply and/or cloaking device . 
  secondary weapons . 
  i think you all know these weapons so there 's no need to describe what they do . 
  m20 basilisk/drake ( default, 
  m40 fury, 
  possibly the m60 bulldog and maaaaaaaaybe the e540 halberd, 
  mainly weapons for fighting ground targets at short range and not other aircrafts or stuff far away . 
  additional stuff . 
  it should have afterburners by default like the esfs and not as a cert like the liberator . 
  should take damage from small-arms fire but should have enough health to not be too bothered by it . 
  should be fairly fast and agile , somewhere between esfs and the liberator . 
  should have low accelration , especially vertically , making it hard to dodge incoming fire unless you 're already moving . 
  one thing in this game that there seems to be a lot of discussions and different opinions about are the max anti infantry weapons . 
  two common complaints are that the ncs shotguns are too good at short range and that nc have no decent weapon for longer range . 
  another thing that at bothers me a little bit is that the tr and vs guns are fairly similar . 
  also that nc and tr basically got max versions of their es ha weapons while vs got ... something else . 
  so i got an idea . 
  basically , create two categories of max anti infantry weapons . 
  kinda like with the av weapons , where all factions have one group that are `` kinda similar '' to each other ( comet , falcon and pounder ) and one group that 's more `` faction flavored '' ( vortex , raven and fracture ) . 
  category 1 would be kinda like max machineguns , basically what vs and tr already has . 
  all factions should get 2-3 different `` max mgs '' , and while they should be pretty similar they would still have some differences like tr having the higher rof , nc the highest damage and vs something else . 
  kinda like the differences between the other classes weapons . 
  when it comes to how they would look and sound the vs ones would pretty much be the same , the tr ones could possibly look different ( not like chainguns ) but work and sound similarly to their current guns and nc would get something like .50 cal mgs . 
  pretty much like this . 
  nc would get m2 browning .50 cal mgs ( big , bulky , loud and american ) . 
  tr would get mg42s ( high rof and facism ) . 
  vs would stay mostly the same but could at least be more `` lasery '' . 
  then there should be a group of more faction specific max weapons . 
  nc would have their shotguns since that 's what they 're supposed to have . 
  tr would have miniguns that looks the same ( or very similar ) to their current guns , but should work more like the new mcg . 
  let 's say there 's a delay before they start firing , or that they start with a low rof but rapidly accelerates to insane levels . 
  basically it should be proper miniguns and not hand cranked gatling guns from the 1800s . 
  vs would then get some sort of lasher/ppa type weapons as their special max guns . 
  vs maxs should also be 100 % immune to the aoe ( i know we got the new damage reduction but maxs does n't have shields so it would still be kinda annoying for them ) of these weapons . 
  maxs would probably make pretty good platforms for lasher type weapons since they should have the health to survive long enough to kill their target even if the weapons have a fairly high ttk . 
  this way all factions would have access to some sort of fairly similar weapons without them being ns weapons , nc would finally have something to use at range other than their ravens ( the sound !!! ), 
  and vs and tr could get access to some weapons that would hopefully be more interesting and fun than the current pewpew/dakkadakka guns as well as fitting their factions better . 
  after messing around a bit in bnw i noticed that some civs were geetting something called reformations beliefs . 
  i decided to try it out for myself and got piety my next game . 
  later on i decided to check [ the wiki ] ( http://civilization.wikia.com/wiki/religion_%28civ5%29#reformation_beliefs ) for the whole list since some were already taken when i could choose and i did n't bother looking at the other religions . 
  one beliefe that caught my attention was heathen conversion . 
  would it really be as simple as putting a missionary next to a barbarian ? 
  no need to use spread religion or anything ? 
  i obviously had to find out so i started a new game with extra raging barbarians and focused on faith and culture . 
  it did n't take long before i had my new belief and a new missionary . 
  i then sent him out towards an encampment i had found earlier . 
  as soon as he got next to the encampment , the unit in it was instantly converted to my side . 
  any unit that got next to the missionary would be converted , even naval units . 
  my missionary had now become a neverending source of free units ( though i still had to pay upkeep ) . 
  then i noticed something interesting . 
  i converted a barbarian swordsman without having any iron and found that he did n't need any . 
  i now had a swordsman that did n't require any resources . 
  if this works for other units , it would mean that not only can you get units for free but you wo n't need strategic resources either . 
  and now there are somethings i need to find out , possibly with your help . 
  * 1 : can the missionaries convert the barbarians that spawn because of unhappiness ( the rebels ) . 
  * 2 : would converted giant deathrobots require any uranium ? 
  edit : progress so far . 
  i 've been running a horrible boring game in order to try test this . 
  unfortunately the game has refused to spawn any robots yet , it might have to do with difficulty settings but i 've been spammed with paratroopers , tanks , at guns , mechanized infantry and xcom squads etc etc and all were quickly converted by my circle of missionaries . 
  so unhappiness + heathen conversion = free units spawning at your capital . 
  unfortunately , unlike swordsmen , it appears that tanks ** do ** use resources so converting too many of them would result in the 50 % combat penalty ( on the other hand , they 're free ) so infantry , and in particular xcom squads would probably be the best units to keep while the rest can be deleted for quick cash . 
  as i said , i have n't been able to test it on the gdrs but i assume that the swordsmen were simply an exception/bug and that all other units you convert will require resources . 
  i 'm just wondering if there 's any way to recruit steppe spearmen or steppe archers or if they 're just garrison units . 
  one thing that bothers me with r2s army , general and agent limits is that imo it really promotes quality over quantity . 
  in older tw games this was mostly just balances by upkeep and recruitment costs . 
  better units were usually more cost effecient but you could still kinda rely on geater numbers and spam militia/levy/peasant units . 
  in r2 we first of all have an army limit . 
  later on it does n't matter as much but in the beginning when you can only have 3 armies you want those armies to be as good as possible . 
  then as you start getting army traditions and high level agents and generals its also preferable to have a few really good armies than several cheaper ones . 
  no point in wasting all those bonuses on a bunch of peasants . 
  units like levy freemen , eastern spearmen and egyptian infantry are thrown out as soon as i get my first barrack , and most mid tier stuff will also be disbanded once i get access to wodanaz spears , praetorians , royal peltasts etc. 
  in the end , all the low and mid tier units just kinda end up being used in some sort of backup army ( mostly when i start running out of money ) . 
  only to be used for repression , garrison and other simple tasks . 
  my idea is that r2 should have a sort of `` pop-cap '' system similar to some other rts games . 
  basically , each army should have 30-40 unit slots instead of the curent 20 . 
  to balance this , some units would take more than one slot . 
  for example , egyptian infantry would take 1 slot , galatian swordsmen 2 slots and galatian royal guard 3 slots . 
  this way we would be somewhat prevented ( or rather deterred ) from having full stacks of praetorian guard and royal cataphracts without using the `` max x of this unit '' system like sparta . 
  i 've gotten kinda interested in the new ghost sites added in rubicon , but after my catastrophic first encounter with one in highsec i realized that i need to get a lot better at the minigame and/or get a different ship . 
  so now i 'm wondering which ships would make good ghost site ships and how to fit them .
