  i 'm thinking about factors like, 
  * warp speed, 
  * ability to survive/avoid pvp, 
  * ability to survive ghost site explosions, 
  * cost effeciency, 
  while interceptors and cov ops frigs probably win the first two , could i possibly survive a failed ghost site in one ? 
  how much damage does the explosion actually do and do speed and/or sig radius affect the damage i take ? 
  if not , what would be the best ship that could actually survive a failed attempt ? 
  a t3 cruiser would probably be the best choice , but how cost effecient would it be ? 
  i could get a lot of t2 frigs or a fuckton of t1 frigs for the cost of one t3 cruiser . 
  when it comes to fitting , what rigs should i use ? 
  warp speed rigs ? 
  analyzer rigs ? 
  resist/hp bonus rigs ? 
  tl ; dr. what would be the most cost effecient ship and fit for running ghost sites in 0.0 ? 
  one thing that has kinda bothered me in starbound is the fact that as long as there 's light , we can see what 's behind solid objects . 
  i can see a robot behind a closed door in a uscm base , or a monster behind a rock in a cave . 
  when mining , my torch is apparently so bright i can see iron ore behind a meter of solid rock . 
  what i want is a field of view setting , both for single player and when hosting a server , that would limit what the player can see to what 's actually within the characters field of view . 
  it should n't be that hard to do this with the games light engine , since solid objects block light . 
  edit : maybe we could get some sort of sensors to reveal stuff to us . 
  * alien style motion sensor : it would show hidden enemies within range as red blinking dots and make a beep , beep , beep sound when they move . 
  * geological survey scanner . 
  will reveal metals , minerals etc within x meters . 
  * echo-scanner . 
  some sort of sound-imaging device that would show you the silhouette of the terrain around you but not the type of blocks . 
  could possibly attract enemies . 
  they could be some sort of handheld tools ( the geo scanner could work as the multi-tool but with longer range and a bigger scan area , like 5x5 ) or maybe just as backpack slot items that constantly scan stuff . 
  from what i have heard so far about the different game modes i 'm kinda dissapointed . 
  sure `` drop everything on death '' and permadeath settings will make the game harder , but at least to me they 're not that interesting . 
  what i want is something similar to the game options in for example civilization v , where you can do stuff like limiting yourself to a single city , or increase the spawn rate of barbarian units , or simply disable stuff you do n't like . 
  here are some examples, 
  * friendly fire/pvp mode : players can now kill eachother . 
  * disable hunger : self explanatory, 
  * baby mode : makes the game a lot easier , for kids and stuff . 
  or more interesting options like, 
  * it runs on water : the ship wo n't require fuel . 
  if you do n't want to chop down a forest or mine coal to travel . 
  * navigation offline : instead of choosing your destinations you can only choose if you want to change planet/moon , star system or sector . 
  * wtf scotty : teleportation is random . 
  you do n't know where on the surface you 'll land and sometimes you 'll end up in the air or in the ground . 
  * where the fuck am i ? 
  : enables line of sight . 
  solid objects now block your vision . 
  should make exploration a lot more challenging . 
  should n't be that hard to do with the games light engine . 
  * glitchcock , the birds : more flying monsters that are all very agressive . 
  like how the game was after a certain update . 
  * there 's no such thing as good weather : every planet now has hazardous weather . 
  * booby trap : some chests are booby trapped and will explode shortly after being opened . 
  maybe some sort of booby trap item in the chest , for identifiying and maybe disarming the trap . 
  ofc most of these could probably be done by modders but i would still prefer something official . 
  sometimes modding can be kinda annoying , especially when it comes to stuff like compatability with the game version or other mods . 
  since ( afaik ) starbound will be updated quite often in the future , not having to deal with these problems would be nice . 
  it would also make it easier when it comes to multiplayer . 
  from my own experience , mods + mp can be kinda troublesome and frustrating . 
  you 'll need the same version of the mod , or you 'll have to get it from the server and sometimes stuff just wo n't work and no one knows why . 
  i have some ideas for new mbt abilities i would like to discuss, 
  * ** high-powered shot ** : an ability to put all your vanguards power into the main gun for one extra powerful shot . 
  it would increase the velocity and direct damage of the shot but would also temporarily reduce the mobility and turret turn rate of the vanguard ( due to low power ) and/or make the vanguard unable to fire for a while due to overheating ( could have a visible effect ) . 
  * ** infantry protection shield ** : a shield bubble around the vanguard that would provide damage reduction against bullets for anyone inside it . 
  useful for supporting your infantry vs enemy infantry . 
  could be a toggle ability with a drawback or something with a time limit that has to recharge . 
  * ** flanking speed ** : the opposite of the anchor ability . 
  a toggle ability that would give increased speed at the expense of rof and turn rate . 
  useful for getting into short range combat or just getting around in general . 
  * ** loader overcharge ** : disable the safety systems of the automated loader and go nuts . 
  you get an increased rof but also risk the loader jamming ( which would disable the main gun for a while ) or even detonating a shell inside the tank ( which would be bad ) . 
  i 'm not sure this is a good idea but i ca n't come up with anything better for tr since you 're all rof and speed :(, 
  * ** ambush cloak ** : a toggle ability that would cloak the magrider but also disable weapons and movement . 
  when cloaking , weapons and engines would turn off immidiately while it takes a few seconds to cloak . 
  then when uncloaking the cloak would instantly turn off while the weapons and engines are still coming online . 
  uncloaking would also show the magrider on the minimap for nearby enemies because restarting the hover generators is easily detectable or something . 
  * ** mag-scorcher ** : use your hover generators to temporarily send out deadly face-melting radiation or other nasty technobabble stuff . 
  while active the magrider would do aoe damage around itself . 
  should be pretty effective vs infantry ( friendlies are immune ) and do some damage to vehicles . 
  imagine turning your magrider into a big lasher and charging into the enemy zerg . 
  * ** magburner ** : ok , this one we already have but i think it should be changed so we can use it in any direction . 
  it should still be more powerful for forward movement due to the giant rocket in the back but it should still be possible to use backwards or sideways ( maybe also upwards ? ) . 
  comments and more ideas would be appreciated . 
  one thing i really like about ps2 is that it feels like a mix of modern-ish warfare with vtols , lock-on missiles , and thermal optics , old-ish warfare with `` massive '' infantry charges , at-grenades and stationary weapons and really old school warfare with giant walls and towers . 
  my suggestion is that there should be more old school stuff ripped straight out of ww1 and 2 and given a new fancy sci-fi makeover . 
  here are some examples ( some of which are not so serious ), 
  * unguided bombs for liberators . 
  liberators should be able to carpet bomb areas like they did in ps1 . 
  extreme damage but low accuracy at high altitudes , would require the liberator to fly straight over the target and some decent timing from the gunner . 
  * unguided bombs for esfs . 
  2-4 unguided bombs as a secondary weapon for esfs . 
  should be the best hit-and-run a2g weapon but would also require more skill and risk taking . 
  should also include a [ stuka siren ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzz504tgdpe ) when diving . 
  * open top sunderers . 
  turn the sunderer intosomething more like an [ m3 half-track ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/m3_half-track ) or an [ sd.kfz 251 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sd.kfz._251 ) . 
  remove a large part of the rear area including the second gun ( could take the secondary weapon slot ) and allow the 10 passengers to fire out of the sunderer ( possible only main and secondary weapons ) . 
  should also increase the speed but reduce the health of the sunderer due to the removed armor . 
  * rifle grenade attachment . 
  a barrel attachment that would enable you to fire reifle grenades . 
  some ideas on how it could work . 
  a ) like a grenade launcher except the grenades act more like normal frags b ) it could be used to fire the grenade you have equiped c ) a combination of a and b. 
  it would fire smaller/weaker versions of the grenade you have equiped . 
  a barrel or rifle attachment that would increase the range and damage of your melee attack ( not ohk ) .
