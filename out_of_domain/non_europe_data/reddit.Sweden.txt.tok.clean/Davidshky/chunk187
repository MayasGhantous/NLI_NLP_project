  could be useful for indoor combat . 
  * swords . 
  a melee secondary weapon . 
  would have better range and damage ( not ohk ) than the normal melee attack and would also be able to hit several enemies in one swing . 
  maybe some ability to wave it around and shout inspirational stuff with no effect whatsoever . 
  * melee charge . 
  probably a horrible idea . 
  if you have a bayonet or swordequiped you should be able to hold down the melee button and sprint for a few meters to go into a melee charge . 
  when charging you would scream at the top of your lungs , get a small speed bonus and a bonus to melee damage ( ohk ! ) . 
  should not be effective but hilarious . 
  * passenger seats on mbts . 
  give all mbts 4 extra seats where infantry can ride along outside the tank . 
  they would not be able to use their weapons because they would need their hands to hold on . 
  * tank traps . 
  cheap deployable consumables for engineers . 
  a small force-field generator that would create a small obstacle that would let allied vehicles through . 
  fairly durable for their cost but easily removed with the repair tool . 
  tl ; dr : make ps2 more like ww2 with lasers and less like a normal modern-military-shooter . 
  there are some things that really bothers me when it comes to the max ai weapons . 
  nc have shotguns as their `` special '' weapon . 
  they have the jackhammer as their es ha gun , the m30 mustang ah as their esf a2g gun , the c85 canister as their mbt/harasser ai gun and plenty of shotguns as their max ai weapons . 
  tr are kinda the same with chain/miniguns . 
  mcg , g20 vulcan , m14 banshee and collection of chainguns for their maxes . 
  us vs have our ppas and lasher ( that due to lack of lashing are kinda the same ) . 
  lasher for ha , ppa for the magrider/harasser and light ppa for the scythe . 
  then for some reason , we have pewpew-laser-crabclaws as our max ai guns . 
  another problem is that ( at least to me ) the tr max chainguns feel more like some 19th century hand cranked gatling guns . 
  this also results in the tr and vs guns being ( imo ) too similar to each other , both simply being low rof machineguns . 
  so i have some suggestions for new max ai guns to make things a bit more interesting . 
  * mini-lasher/ppa . 
  ok , this one is kinda boring but since we for some reason do n't have our es anti-infantry gun for our max i think it should be added . 
  * heavy lasher/lasher cannon/blast lasher/blasher ? 
  a heavier slow rof ( semi auto ) version of the lasher . 
  can be charged to fire a big slow moving lashing ball of energy/plasma/science . 
  * light cycler . 
  a chaingun with really high rof , some spin up time , lower initial rof and a lot of recoil/bloom . 
  since the tr max chainguns are barely worth calling chainguns i think they should get a proper max version of their mcg . 
  since maxes are kinda durable they could also actually survive the initial spin up time . 
  * rapid fire grenade launcher . 
  like a lighter version of the marauder . 
  tr seems quite fond of high rof explosive weapons so another one as a max ai gun could work . 
  * max hmg . 
  since tr and vs already have 4 machineguns each nc should at least have one . 
  similar to the current tr and vs guns but with lower rof , higher damage etc etc. 
  should look kinda like an m2 browning . 
  * gauss cannon . 
  an accurate , high damage , low rof `` auto '' cannon . 
  even though they have a shotgun fetish nc is also supposed to be the best at accurate low rof weapons . 
  should be absolute crap while on the move but pretty accurate while stationary . 
  while it could be a bit similar to shotguns with slugs , some sort of long range anti-infantry gun would imo fit nc . 
  my suggestion for wds is that when defending you should earn points for every x experience instead of when succesfully taking the points back . 
  this would reward the defenders even if the attackers fail to take any points and if the attackers overwhelm them . 
  the attackerrs on the other hand should only be rewarded when capturing the base , but instead of the reward depending on how long the base has been held , it should depend on how hard it was defended ( not sure how this should be calculated though ) . 
  that way larger fights would be more rewarding and the defenders would be encouraged to fight even if they ca n't really win . 
  it would also make ghost capping pointless and make counter-attacks really rewarding even if the base has only been held for a few minutes . 
  so a few days ago i finally recieved my 7 day competative cooldown ( not gon na rant ) after getting disconnected and failing to reconnect in time again . 
  what i 'm asking for is help with fixing this problem . 
  i do n't experience any connection problems otherwise so it might be limited to cs : go or even just competative . 
  my main problem is that due to the punishment system i ca n't really do this with trial and error ( did n't work so far ) since that could take a few months . 
  so is there any way to test my connection with cs : go and its servers without actually trying to play competative . 
  right now i 'm gon na wait a few weeks so my cooldown level decreases but while waiting i 'd like to figure out how to prevent this from happening again . 
  any advice ? 
  after seeing [ this post ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/planetside/comments/1xjnxh/my_liberator_transport_variant_valkyrie/ ) about a transport liberator i was reminded of [ my own old idea for a phantasm transport/gunship ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/planetside/comments/1dcnud/idea_phantasm_gunship/ ) so i decided to try to refine and improve it . 
  ( i have some horrible pictures in the old thread ), 
  in ps1 there was a 5 man transport aircraft called the phantasm . 
  it was unarmed , equipped with a cloaking device and had very high speed ( with afterburner ) but poor accelration . 
  so here are my ideas about a phantasm in ps2 . 
  6 slots . 
  1 pilot , 1 gunner , 4 passengers . 
  in terms of speed , agility and health it should be somewhere between the esfs and the liberator . 
  the passengers should be able to use their main and secondary weapons ( no tools or launchers ) but with an accuracy penalty . 
  can not transport maxes . 
  should be capable of squad spawning . 
  limited fall damage protection . 
  you 'll need to slow down and get somewhat close to the ground or your passengers will take some fall damage , but it will give them some protection . 
  * ** main slot **, 
  * ** mobility enhancement ** : think of this as a combination of an airframe and the esf fuel tanks . 
  bonus to ab fuel and ab fuel regeneration and mobility in general except speed . 
  should make it very agile but not as fast as an esf . 
  you can cert it to increase the ab fuel bonuses but not the agility bonuses . 
  this is basically the littlebird configuration . 
  you can get in , drop of your passengers and get out as fast as possible . 
  should probably be the default unlock . 
  * ** phantasm cloak ** : this is the main feature of the phantasm but i feel that it should probably be something you have to unlock . 
  it should either work like the ps1 phantas cloak and have infinite energy but the faster you move the more visible you become or like a normal ps2 cloak and have a limited amount of energy but you 're completely invisible even at max speed . 
  * ** autocannons ** : low ( ish ) dps ap , heat and he autocannons with a ton of ammo . 
  would enable the phantasm to provide some additional fire support to ground troops . 
  while they should have pretty low dps ( especially burst dps ) compared to the esfs and liberator weapons , these guns should be fairly accurate and have large magazines and ammo pool enabling the phantasm to stay in the area longer and provide some extra firepower to the squad . 
  with one of these equipped the phantasm would be more like a blackhawk/huey/mi -24 helicopter gunship . 
  ** secondary weapons **, 
  the phantasm should have a small turret in the front ( horrible pictures in the old thread ) to attack ground targets . 
  it should have access to mostly the same weapons as the rear gunner on a liberator , maybe also the fury grenade launcher . 
  * ** supply drop ** : this cert would enable to phantasm to drop ammo crates containing both infantry and ground vehicle ammo . 
  the crate should have a limited duration and/or a limited amount of ammo . 
  it should either have a long cooldown that can be reduced with certs or it should be `` ammo based '' requiring you to get a new one at a landing pad and the cert would instead increase the duration/supply of the crate . 
  * ** smoke drop ** : this would enable the phantasm to drop/launch a bunch of smoke grenades to provide cover when unloading troops or to help allies/annoy enemies . 
  * ** radar/sensor jammer ** : an aoe ability that would temporarily mess with the enemies minimap and iff system . 
  would disable the minimap , spotting , doritos and names in general and the friendly fire warning beep . 
  you would get assist point for any friendly fire/teamkill your affected targets cause . 
  might also do stuff against lock-ons .
