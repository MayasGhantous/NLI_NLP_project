  * ** grav chutes ** : would give full protection against fall damage like the galaxy . 
  useful if you do n't like landing . 
  ** brainstorming **, 
  * a main slot thing that would enable you to carry harrassers and flashes . 
  * a utility cert that would enable you to drop giant sensor darts with parachutes . 
  * illumnation flares, 
  * door guns : a main `` weapon '' that would give two of your passengers copies of your secondary weapon . 
  * repair supply drop : a crate with some sort of aoe repair effect for ground vehicles . 
  tl ; dr : aircraft that would fill the role of very fast light transport , cloaky transport , gunship and utility helicopter . 
  since the original idea about a shotgun firemode was scrapped and people ( afaik ) do n't like the new point-and-click adventure game version i figured i 'd post my own idea . 
  ( note that i 'm tired so i 'm probably not typing very well ), 
  basically , instead of having a shotgun alternate firemode it should have a shrapnel round alternate firemode . 
  [ shrapnel shells ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shrapnel_shell ) are basically airburst shotgun rounds launched by artillery that detonate mid-air into a hail of bullets/shrapnel/flechetes . 
  the idea is that when using shrapnel rounds , the player would first have to set a detonation distance ( by aiming somewhere and pressing a button ) and then fire . 
  the round would then detonate at that distance - x meters . 
  if the round detonates too early it would n't do much damage ( like a shotgun at range ) and if it were to hit the target before detonating it would do like 400 damage . 
  but if the shooter manage to both aim and set the distance correctly it should do a lot more damage than other sniper rifle . 
  not sure if it should ohk but i guess that could be possible if the round detonates less than 1 meter from the target . 
  it would also be kinda useful against moving targets since it would be fairly easy to hit it with a few pellets . 
  or you could use them against groups of enemies to annoy more people per shot . 
  find a zerg and bombard it with shrapnel . 
  or you could team up with some other snipers and wipe out groups of people with one big salvo ( not really realistic but hey , someone would probably do it ) . 
  it should probably have a minimum detonation distance ( `` safety reasons '' ) and you would have to ads to do it so it would n't be very useful at short range . 
  tl ; dr : airburst shotgun rounds for ncs es sniper . 
  combining long range combat with ncs shotgun fetish . 
  i 'd like to have a discussion about the balance of the normal ha launchers . 
  one thing i 've realized is that when playing ha , about 90 % of the time i 'm using the nemesis ( aa lock-on ) and 10 % of the time the hades ( av lock-on ) . 
  the reason why is simply that ( imo ) the drawbacks of the nemesis are overshadowed by the ability to lock on to aircrafts . 
  while the hades and s1 are better vs ground targets , the nemesis is still usable , but try using the s1 or hades vs aircraft . 
  and when it comes to the hades vs s1 , the ability to lock on to ground vehicles is ( imo ) usually better than the slightly ( 13,5 % ) higher damage . 
  the increased accuracy tends to make my actual dps much higher . 
  and sure it can be countered with smoke , but it does n't take long to reload . 
  unfortunately i ca n't comment on the annihilator or decimator since i do n't have them but i guess someone else can . 
  so , what are your opinions about the non-es launchers . 
  do you think they 're balanced or not ? 
  what would you change about them if you could ? 
  currently , the flash is the only vehicle in the game that comes with an empty weapon slot . 
  back in the beta people complained about the empty secondary weapon slot on the esf so the devs gave us the external fuel tanks . 
  it was n't a weapon but at least it was something . 
  my suggestion is that the flash should get a weapon or a `` utility device '' for the weapon slot by default . 
  an easy but very boring solution would be to give it the kobalt or basilisk by default and give some cert refunds to those who bought it . 
  so instead i figured we could try to come up with some ideas for what the devs could give the flash . 
  remember , as long as you do n't have the power to make them reality , bad ideas are better than none . 
  * ** pistol akimbo module ** : the flash would get 2x of your currently equipped sidearm , including attachments . 
  no ads would make the accuracy somewhat shitty but the flash has a steady `` grip '' so there 's less recoil . 
  * ** shield bubble ** : give the flash a 500-1000 hp shield that would protect the driver , passenger and the flash itself . 
  no firepower but a lot more durability . 
  1000 hp would be enough to absorb an entire lock-on missile so it might be a bit too much , but against small arms it 's not much at all . 
  maybe less hp but a resist against small arms . 
  ** class specific utility device ** : ok , this idea is kinda silly and would probably be hard to do , but i 'm just here to brainstorm . 
  you would use it with m1 ( since you might have turbo , cloak etc ) and the energy would be displayed as the ammo bar . 
  basically , it would be a sort of utility device that would do different things depending on the class of the driver . 
  * ** light assault , [ rcs thrusters ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/reaction_control_system ) ** : since we already have the turbo i had to come up with something else . 
  the rcs thrusters would be a sort of stabilization and landing device . 
  while activated the thrusters would try to turn you wheels down and after doig that it would try to slow your fall ( if you 're falling that is ) . 
  so if you hit a rock and your flash decides to do a little air-show into the j908 crater this could possibly save you . 
  * ** heavy assault , shield projector ** : this could either be similar to the shield bubble idea or it could be something like this . 
  while active it would project a `` small '' shield 1 meter ( ish ) away in the direction you 're aiming . 
  would drain a lot of energy while active but could absorb a lot of damage . 
  * ** medic , medic tool/regen field ** : pretty much the medic tool with some extra range + a constant but pretty weak aoe heal . 
  turn your flash into a rapid respone ambulance and drive around saving lives . 
  * ** engineer , repair tool/ammo dispenser ** : similar to the above . 
  a repair tool + a built in ammo box . 
  turbo your way to the burning mbt or drive around and make sure no one is lacking ammo . 
  * ** infiltrator , sensor stuff ? 
  ** : since both the cloak and radar already exist i had to come up with something else . 
  one idea would pretty much be the recon tool but imo that 's kinda meh . 
  maybe some sort of advanced directional radar . 
  could detect vehicles , mines and devices at decent range in a small cone where you 're aiming . 
  would be handy for finding and then hunting or avoiding stuff . 
  this is a pretty simple suggestion . 
  merge the scout rifle and battle rifle categories into one ( dmr ? ), 
  that is avaliable to infiltrators , has and engineers . 
  both categories basically have the same role , accurate medium range rifles . 
  statwise the brs might just be the bastard offspring of the semi and full auto srs . 
  to me it just feels strange that they 're separated like this , especially since if you put a scope on a battle rifle you get a dmr . 
  it would n't really do much except give us some more loadout options , reduce weapon categories and give people more bang for their buck .

  edit : unfortunately i do n't know more than what is in that article and [ chribbas forum post ] ( https://forums.eveonline.com/default.aspx?g=posts&m=4296329#post4296329 ), 
  if anyone has more information , please post it in the comments . 
  so i 've had some ideas about base design after various discussions about citadels , spawnless outposts , bridges etc etc. 
  first of all , i have some ideas about capture points and generators . 
  i would like to add some new types of cps and generators . 
  subpoints and power-conduits . 
  subpoints ( sps ) would be similar to normal cps in terms of appearance and how you capture them . 
  the main difference is that they do n't help you capture the actual base itself but rather a specific part of it , like a gate or an elevator . 
  also , there 's no long timer . 
  when the point is taken you capture whatever it 's attached to . 
  power-conduits ( pcs ) would be similar to generators but ( like sps ) used for less important stuff . 
  they would overload much faster but would also be easier to repair . 
  could look more like a sort of maintenance panel/hatch so it can be attached to walls and other flat surfaces . 
  when it comes to what sps and pcs would be used for , here are some examples . 
  ** mobility related **, 
  * gates and doors . 
  simple shield gates that block hostile vehicle and/or infantry . 
  anything from the giant vehicle shields to small doorways . 
  * energy bridges : a big bridge like this was added in the amerish update but there should also be some smaller , 2-3 m wide versions for infantry . 
  * elevators : could just be the actual field-thingy or a shielded room with elevators in it . 
  * jump pads : no explanation needed . 
  * teleporters : no explanation needed .
