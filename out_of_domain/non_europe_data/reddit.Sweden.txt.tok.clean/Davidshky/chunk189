  ** utility/defense **, 
  some of these could also be used as independent outposts . 
  `` bases '' without spawnrooms scattered around the maps . 
  * ammo towers : good old ammo tower . 
  the tower itself could possibly be used as the sp . 
  * firebase : a small group of phalanx turrets and some decent cover . 
  * radar station : a structure with a long range scout radar . 
  * vehicle spawner : no explanation needed . 
  * landing pad : no explanation needed . 
  * bunker/pillbox : a defensive structure with some damage-reduction shields in the embrasures and a shield-gate in the door . 
  * jump hub : a sort of cluster of jump pads . 
  like a platform with 4 jump pads somewhere in indar , enabling 1-way trips to some elevated positions . 
  ** `` buff generators '' **, 
  these would be some capturable and overloadable generators giving some sort of local buff to the owners . 
  examples, 
  * facility nanite auto repair : all turrets and consoles get the equivalent of a lvl 1 nar cert . 
  after a few minutes it should also try to reconstruct destroyed stuff . 
  * hoplite shield generator : would give all phalanx turrets a forward facing shield . 
  not sure if it should be `` limited health + regen '' , damage reduction or complete damage negation , but you get the idea . 
  * triage generator : same bonus as a biolab but only in the area in and around the base . 
  * `` remote charging field '' generator : would increase the regeneration of infantry abilities , like cloak , resist shield etc etc. 
  * production effeciency generator : would give a decent discount to ground vehicles in the facility . 
  ofc not all bases should have all of these . 
  maybe just 1 or 2 . 
  also , not everything must have a sp or a pc attached . 
  or there could be more than just one . 
  there could be something important , like a large bridge , with several pcs and you have to overload all of them to disable the bridge . 
  some stuff could have several sps and if it 's a draw the bridge , gate etc could become neutral instead . 
  normal capture points could also be used instead of sps . 
  lets say point a in northern whatsitsname has two infantry bridges attached to it , enabling a shortcut to whoever holds it . 
  and now my lunch break is up so this is it for now . 
  will probably add more ideas and horrible mspaint `` concept-art '' later, 
  i 've been playing a lot of 10v10 lately and one problem i 've had is that for some reason the game just loves to hand over all the units of any leaving teammate to me . 
  all of the sudden i have two or three times as many units , scattered all over the map , in strange positions . 
  one game i basically had to take care of 1/3rd of the map by myself . 
  another game i got units on both the left and right side of the map while my main force was slugging it out in the center . 
  so is there any way to simply tell the game to fuck off with all this responsibility i do n't want ? 
  while browsing the armory yesterday i noticed that the a-10 actually had a few points of armor ( 2 front , 1 side/rear/top iirc ) and after some quick searching found that the su-25 was the same . 
  then i looked at some aa units and all of the spaags i checked had 1 ap and all the aa missiles were pure he damage . 
  so now i have some questions . 
  * a : do any other aircraft have armor ? 
  i did n't really check all of them so the only one i found were the a-10 and the two su-25s . 
  * b : does any of the helicopters have armor ? 
  i havent really been paying attention to the armor stat since afaik it 's pretty much always 0 . 
  * c : how does this affect spaags . 
  if they only have 1 ap power , how effective are they against the a-10 ? 
  would the front of the a-10 be immune ? 
  * d : how does this affect aa missiles . 
  i 'm not really sure how he works against armor ( except badly ) so how much damage would they do ? 
  i guess the radar sams would still be effective since they have fairly high he ( like 8 ish ) but most of the ir f&f missiles have like 3-4 he . 
  * e : since i had n't noticed this before , are there any other units with some `` special '' stats that are easily missed ? 
  like units with silencers ( btw , how do i tell if they have them or not ? 
  ) , the f&f missile vehicles that can target ground units etc etc. 
  edit : here 's what i mean with `` units with some `` special '' stats '' . 
  france has two cheap mortar cars with short range and low he damage ( 60 mm ) but a whole whooping 17 rpm . 
  i had n't seen these before since i had n't made a french or eurocorp deck but now now that i have , all i can say is that these things are scary . 
  i would like some help with making a melee focused character . 
  so far i 've figured out that a tactical klingon would be the best race/class combo ( only lvl 5 so far so if i 'm wrong this can be fixed ) but now i 'm trying to figure out the rest . 
  * a : traits , both standard and the reward pack traits . 
  * b : equipment ( weapon , armor , shield etc ) in terms of stats and set-bonuses . 
  * c : kits and kit modules , best bonuses and powers for melee . 
  * d : reputation traits, 
  * e : duty officers ( i guess the melee crith/critd doffs would be best ) . 
  a few days ago i decided to test some different mortars and howitzers of different calibers to see if higher caliber = bigger smoke cloud or if i should simply focus on rof . 
  one thing i noticed was that the canadian bison 81 mm mortar created much larger smoke clouds than even the west german 120 mm mortar . 
  then i did another test with only 81 mm mortars and 155 mm howitzers and found that the bison 81 mm and some uk 81 mm mortar ( fv something ) created much larger smoke clouds than the other 81 mm mortars i tested . 
  end result was that caliber did n't seem to matter ( except the french 60 mm mortar that barely did anything ) but that some units for some reason created more smoke than otherwise equivalent units . 
  so now i 'm wondering which units are best for smoke generation and if there are more mortars like the bison with xl smoke puffs ? 
  also , are there howitzers with similar traits ? 
  the 5 different 155 mm howitzers i tested all created equally large smoke clouds . 
  my fsj90 found that out the hard way . 
  edit : fyi , cqc in wargame is when infantry units are fighting in a contested ( purple ) building zone , not just combat at short range . 
  so [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/sto/comments/2evaau/rep_shields_on_rmor_science_vessel/ ) recent post reminded me of an idea i 've had for a while . 
  basically i think it would be pretty nice if there was some sort of database/gallery of all the different ship + equipment visual effect combos in sto . 
  like a page in the / r/sto [ guide list ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/sto/wiki/guides#wiki_guides ) with a list of links to some imgur galleries for all the ship showing off all the different shield visuals ( and maybe some different ship models and skins ) . 
  i 'm pretty sure i 'm not the only person who would find this really useful , especially since google is surprisingly unhelpful when it comes to this stuff . 
  together we should easily be able to get all the different combinations and since changing ships is really easy nowadays it should n't take long to take some screenshots and upload them somewhere . 
  well the title kinda says it all , but basically i 'm looking for stuff like science bops and other `` suboptimal yet somewhat functional '' and most importantly fun builds . 
  i 've done a few share of these when i 've wanted to use a different ship for some change of pace but could n't be arsed to retrain my boffs or get new equipment . 
  for example i 've used a risian corvette with a a2b cruiser loadout . 
  was it a good build ? 
  was it insanely fast and went out in a blaze of glory by using apo3 and faw3 ? 
  yes !, 
  so , what kind of abomination-builds do you have that would make / u/mastajdog cry ?

  basically , i 'm looking for all the different buffs you can get from shooting at stuff and the different procs based around your crits . 
  examples of `` self-buffs from weapons '', 
  * the assimilated set 2p bonus . 
  2,5 % chance to get +10 weapon power and a huge bonus to drain resistance . 
  * fleet elite phasers : 2,5 % chance to heal your shield or hull ( ca n't remember which ) . 
  * the solanae set 3 or 4 piece bonus that gives your weapons a hull heal proc . 
  * the delta pack agent nerul doff bonus . 
  0,2 % hull hp healed per hit with an energy weapon while apb is active . 
  examples of `` crit based procs '',
