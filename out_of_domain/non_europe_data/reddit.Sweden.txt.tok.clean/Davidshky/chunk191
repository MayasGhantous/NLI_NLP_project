  the baserunner ca n't build sensors or landmines anymore . 
  i 'm also pretty sure that some unit ( s ) have gained some aa capabilities because i 've lost fighters to groups that afaik did n't have any aa . 
  so how many differences like these are there ? 
  so i 've played a few skirmish games as the gaalsien to get used to their units and one thing that bothered me was their baserunner . 
  it only has one ability ( unlike the coalition br that can deploy turrets and launch a small uav ) , an aoe heal that costs resources to use and disables the br for a while . 
  also , it 's pretty much the only gaalsien unit without self-repair . 
  all the other units from the sandskimmer to the honorguard cruiser has the self-repair passive and the carrier can put some power into the repair subsystem to repair itself . 
  so am i missing something or is this unit basically a waste of cus when not playing artifact retrieval ? 
  so i recently felt like playing some me3 coop again after like 2,5 years of inactivity and i think one of my guns have gone missing , or to be more precise , the m-7 lancer . 
  i 'm pretty sure i remember using the damn thing but now it 's not available . 
  have anyone else here experienced anything similar and if so , is there a solution ? 
  like reinstalling some dlc ? 
  i know it 's not that bad but it 's kinda annoying since the m-7 is ultra rare and i remember that i enjoyed using it . 
  so yesterday when i was playing i looked at the tooltip for asteroid fields and noticed this sentence, 
   an asteroid field reduces the precision of enemy ships that are targeting vessels inside it by 2 . 
  does anyone know exactly what this means exactly ? 
  is it like a 2 % accuracy penalty ? 
  and if so , would for example 50 % accuracy become 50 * 0,98 = 49 % or 50-2 = 48 % ? 
  or do they mean that it divides the accuracy by 2 ? 
  basically , if we had a person who basically gets a panic attack if they find themselves in a room with a homosexual person sort of like how someone with severe arachnophobia would react if they were in a room with a bunch of spiders , would that person simply have homophobia or is there another word for it ? 
  kinda wondering since there are stuff with the phobia suffix that afaik are n't really phobias . 
  so two days ago i posted [ this post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/stellaris/comments/4jsk9j/i_really_hope_no_one_ever_decides_to_enlighten/ ) about some very unpleasant mushrooms i had encountered . 
  yesterday i decided to mess around an enlighten them to see what would happen since the game had sort of stagnated . 
  i managed to get control of their home system by pushing my neighbors border with a frontier outpost and then i just had to make an observation post and wait . 
  unfortunately , when enlightened the damn bastards learned the joy of materialism and lost their fanatic spiritualist ethic , but oh well , they were still fanatic xenophobes and militarists , so i guess they became mushroom nazis or something . 
  after that i donated a nice little planet to them ( a holy gaia planet next to a fallen empire ) to help them get their empire going . 
  it did n't take long before they ended up in a way against the nearby powers , a war they unfortunately but not surprisingly lost . 
  the result is quite tragic . 
  [ their home planet is now under the control of xenophilic birds ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wwif5e5.png ) and lets just say the native mushrooms [ are n't very happy about their situation ] ( http://i.imgur.com/4of4vqh.png ) ( except [ these fuckers ] ( http://i.imgur.com/nulrmiq.png ) \u0ca0_\u0ca0 ) . 
  fortunately the mesh ` ben empire was still around since they got to keep the gaia planet and they managed to colonize another planet nearby . 
  unfortunately , because the gaia planet used to be under the control of my little individualist multicultural society the planets ended up like [ this ] ( http://imgur.com/hd1q1hd,kec0tmp ) . 
  i realize this is kinda petty but i 'm actually a bit annoyed that your starting system is n't more developed or even surveyed . 
  your civilization has apparently reached the point where they have developed ftl travel , built a giant space station , a construction ship , a science ship and three corvettes , but have n't bothered to properly survey their home system yet . 
  so what are the best items you 've received so far in tw warhammer ? 
  yesterday i got a talisman that gives the character hp regen during melee combat which makes grimgor even more ridiculously powerful in combat than he already was and i 've gotten some items with pretty nice abilities in some of my campaigns , like an item with a -56 melee defense hex and a ring that allows the character to throw fireballs with a 45s cooldown but no magic cost . 
  basically , i wish we could get things like great weapons , halberds and maybe even some ranged weapons options for most combat hero types and the basic non-magic lords . 
  for example the empire captain could have these extra variants . 
  * greatsword variant : no shield , lower melee defense , more damage . 
  * halberd variant : no shield , lower melee defense , bonus vs large . 
  * rifle variant : overall a bit worse in melee but has a powerful long range rifle like the dwarf engineer . 
  this is something that 's kinda bothering me with tw : warhammer , the fact that units like lords and heroes do n't heal unless your army is replenishing . 
  the fact that they also take a ton of damage if you auto resolve makes it even worse . 
  these units really should have some slow health regen each turn even if they 're marching around in hostile territory . 
  the varghulf even have health regen in battles but not on the campaign map ... 
  would it be possible to make a mod that gives only certain units replenishment anywhere ? 
  edit : maybe it could be an agent skill , for example warrior priests can get the heal troops skill that increases replenishment , so maybe that could also give some health regen to wounded units each turn even without replenishment . 
  yesterday during a siege defense with balthasar gelt i tried using searing doom against a siege tower that was almost dead but unfortunately it did no damage at all . 
  so does anyone know if there are any spells that can damage siege towers or battering rams ? 
  basically i 've been having some fun with the new space marine ships and i 've kinda come to the conclusion that homing boarding torpedoes are awesome . 
  as a result , the hunter destroyer ( unlike all the other torpedo escorts in the game ) is actually pretty damn useful . 
  262 speed + an infinite range homing weapon you can put on auto-cast gives you the least micro intensive ship so far . 
  all you have to do is keep them far away from the enemies and then you can focus on micromanaging your bigger ships . 
  basically , if for example altdorf is attacked and you have the colleges of magic built there , then mmmaybe some random battle wizard could join the battle . 
  or like a captain from a tier 3 barrack etc etc. 
  basically , i 'm a bit curious if there are any really interesting mounts that we can expect for some of the future factions or maybe even in a update/dlc for the current factions . 
  in particular , are there any monstrous ground mounts ( i know that the ogre kingdom will have some but that 's to be expected considering their size ) ? 
  unless i 'm forgetting one , right now all the monstrous mounts are flying units so if you want your lord/hero to stay on the ground they basically have to settle for something horse-sized . 
  basically , me and some friends have been playing the [ escape from tanoa ] ( http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=700221852 ) mission a lot lately but i 'm wondering if there 's any similar mission where you get to play as csat against nato so you get to encounter ( and loot ) different types of enemies , weapons , vehicles etc. 
  basically , a few days ago i was playing as spain ( iirc ) and dropped a nuke on china and this really sad song immediately started playing . 
  and no , it was n't field of poppies . 
  it kinda sounded like air raid sirens or something similar . 
  basically , i 'm a bit curious about what the wh lore says about siege equipment and `` deployable equipment '' like the bretonnian archers and their wooden stakes . 
  do the lore restrict ca to only adding battering rams , siege towers and stakes or could they in theory add more stuff like for example [ mantlets ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mantlet ) , the ability for dwarfs to '' [ mine ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mining_ ( military \\ ) #middle _ ages ) when besieging a settlement or maybe some deployable explosives ( like landmines ) . 
  i have n't had time to try out the new chaos units yet so i was wondering if someone else had and could give their impressions about them . 
  so basically there are a bunch of different slayer units missing from the game so i figured that this could be a decent theme for a future free-lc/update . 
  for a start , ungrim should get his own faction since he 's the god damned slayer king and either start in karak kadrin or have an objective to retake it like belegar and k8p . 
  the new units should be daemon slayers ( lords ) , dragon slayers ( heroes ) , giant slayers ( high tier slayers ) and slayers with great weapons . 
  ungrim and the daemon slayers should get some new slayer buffing skills ( like volkmar/arch lectors and their flagellants or wurrzag and his savage orcs ) that should make it viable to not only have some slayers but a lot of slayers in an army . 
  stuff like more ma , charge defense etc etc. 
  the dragon slayers should basically be a glass cannon duelist with some anti-large bonuses , making him the best hero at engaging large dangerous foes . 
  on the campaign map they should function like an assassin and corruption remover . 
  possibly they could also get a trait that gives a small bonus to critical success when assassinating but also a higher risk of critical failure . 
  giant slayers are an upgrade for normal slayers in the tt and they 're basically just much better but also much more expensive slayers . 
  i figured that in tw : w they could be sort of like the aspiring champions , very high stats but like 16-24 guys per units . 
  in the tt game , slayers have some rule about getting to choose between using two 1h axes or one 2h axe at the start of combat so adding a great weapon variant of the slayers should be halal . 
  i guess they would lose some melee defense in exchange for additional charge bonus and a lot of armor-piercing damage . 
  they should probably also lose their whirling axes trait that give the normal slayers the 15 % `` shield '' . 
  tl ; dr : give me more slayers !, 
  the fact that you ca n't build walls in karak eight peak is one of the things i dislike the most about the k&w dlc . 
  you do get more garrison units from the k8p settlement than normal settlements but it 's still a [ pretty shitty garrison even when upgraded to lvl 5 . 
  ] ( http://whenc.totalwar.com/#/building/wh_main_special_settlement_eight_peaks_5_dwf ), 
  in comarison karaz-a-karak has a great garrison from the [ level 5 settlement . 
  ] ( http://whenc.totalwar.com/#/building/wh_main_special_settlement_karaz_a_karak_5_dwf ), 
  so i really think that either k8p should get a garrison like kak or just be more like a normal settlement and have the ability to build walls . 
  also , i kinda wish that clan angrund got some rangers in their standard garrisons to make them a bit more different from the normal dwarfs . 
  edit : [ the crooked moons version ] ( http://whenc.totalwar.com/#/building/wh_main_special_settlement_eight_peaks_5_grn ) is also really shitty compared to [ black crag ] ( http://whenc.totalwar.com/#/building/wh_main_special_settlement_black_crag_5_grn ) or even a normal settlements + walls . 
  i mean , only 2 archers and you get 4 fucking standard goblins . 
  they could at least give is nasty skulkers instead of the goblins so we could deal with heavily armored foes . 
  so i 've been reading about the [ lore of life ] ( http://diceofdoom.com/blog/2011/07/warhammer-magic-guide-lore-of-life/ ) and [ lore of shadow ] ( http://diceofdoom.com/blog/2012/02/warhammer-magic-guide-lore-of-shadow/ ) but i 'm kinda curious how they will implement some of the spells in tw : w. 
  like steed of shadows, 
   steed of shadows is a fairly simple spell : it allows the caster or another character to make a single fly move , immediately . 
  will we get the ability to make anyone fly , or will it be something like a major speed bonus ? 
  i 'm not talking about some form of corruption mechanic . 
  when an empire faction capture a region in bretonnia the trees change from deciduous to conifer trees ( and vice versa ) and when the greenskins capture a dwarf region they install some new decorations and stuff on the campaign map . 
  so right now i 'm kinda curious about how the different parts of the world will look when conquered by the we . 
  just imagine the badlands , norsca or the mountain regions with a fuckton of trees everywhere . 
  if i change the allowed age range , will this affect all characters or just the starting characters ? 
  i kinda want to change it to reduce the amount of characters with the frail , bad back , dementia etc etc traits when i 'm randomizing my starting characters but i do n't want it to affect the rest of the characters . 
  basically i want some form of warpaints for the titan weapons so i can make sure the titan and its gun are matching . 
  i 'm gon na try to conquer all of norsca before the chaos invasion just to see what happens when the chaos forces are n't backed up by the norsca doomstack spam .
