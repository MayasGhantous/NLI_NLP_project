  throw . 
  aoe reave + aoe shockwave for maximum , multiple , simultaneous biotic explosions . 
  ** quarian soldier **, 
  something defense related ( like fortification , shield boost etc. 
  an offensive power like concussive shot/incinerate that would work well against frozen targets or possibly energy drain for added survivability . 
  cryo grenade would simply be a cryo blast with a much larger aoe , freezing and weakening the targets . 
  similar evolution options to the cryo blast . 
  oh god . 
  this reminds me of homeworld 2 and its difficulty system . 
  if you did well in one mission the difficulty would increase in the next , if you had more units left at the end of the mission the enemies would start with more ( since you got to keep all previous units ) , if you had lots of resources so would the enemy etc etc making it nigh impossible to complete some missions if you did well the previous . 
  it works by reducing the damage reduction armor otherwise has . 
  on gold armor will reduce the damage from each round with 50 , so your shredder mod would reduce that to 17.5 . 
  since it 's calculated for each individual pellet ( ? ), 
  it can be quite significant for shotguns . 
  how about letting them link their hunter mode so that a geth close to the enemy can provide vision assistance to one further away . 
  like having an engineer with gps and 30m vision revealing enemies to the geth infiltrator some distance away . 
  i usually just deconstruct the depot when they have unloaded all the goods . 
  enables me to steal even from dwarf caravans and all it costs me is some of my masons time . 
  i once had a team that decided to stay at the ladder . 
  and since no one joined me in the server room i decided to join them . 
  we completed it in 18 minutes 36 seconds . 
  we had a salarian engineer and the rest of us were infiltrators , it was a complete massacre of everything trying to approach us . 
  so while the server room is the easiest way , standing above the ladder can work if you know what you 're doing . 
  * geth soldier . 
  * turian infiltrator and engineer . 
  * batarian infiltrator . 
  * something with both shockwave and reave . 
  * quarian soldier . 
  * another engineer with the normal combat drone . 
  * an engineer or possibly sentinel with the defense drone . 
  true , but it was pretty damn hillarious . 
  iirc we had 2 black widows , 1 valiant and 1 widow and everything that walked around the corner outside the server room or came out of it just got completely destroyed . 
  almost nothing spawned on the landing pad and when something did it got killed just as fast . 
  but yes , you have to know what you 're doing . 
  i have unlocked all the classes except the drell vanguard !, 
  i consider that a great achievement . 
  could work for a krogan adept . 
  barrier , reave and shockwave . 
  all up in their face , shotgunning , meleeing and blowing stuff up . 
  no , like all other upgrades they compenate by having it take up one of your two upgrade slots . 
  i 'd rather make a geth sentinel for tank , defense matrix , energy drain and some other offensive tech ability . 
  ( i do n't care that sentinels should have biotic powers ), 
  my idea of a geth soldier is kinda like a fullauto glasscannon . 
  marksman , huntermode and a new overload grenade . 
  well , the cooldown is only 3s if you fire/use a power almost immediately after cloaking . 
  so if you need to use the cloak to move around , to for example do an objective you will have a very long cooldown . 
  yes , someone poster a til about dr pepper outdating coca cola by 1 year . 
  [ book spoiler ] ( / b `` i wonder if doreah will sex with dany later in the series since irri is dead . '' ), 
  kishock and incisor with my geth infiltrator . 
  proxy mine + fully charged harpoon shot , both with cloak bonus can instakill pretty much any non-boss enemy . 
  incisor with piercing mod is awesome against groups of enemies and is still pretty good against larger enemies . 
  i agree about the victory packs . 
  it would be better if it was something like a specter pack or a psp . 
  nothing you could n't get otherwise but still a better reward than what we currently get . 
  i 'm imagining a geth infiltrator with cloak and huntermode specced for damage . 
  the incisor is actually really good in the hands of a geth infiltrator , put an extender barrel and a piercing mod on it and you can kill both individual targets but most importantly , groups of enemies very fast . 
  i found myself able to kill groups of enemies much faster than i did with the black widow while still being fairly effective against larger enemies . 
  as long as you can compensate for the recoil and have an ammo box nearby it rocks . 
  indeed , though i think i should point out that you do n't get a damage bonus if you fire while cloaked with a previously charged shot . 
  you need to do something that will decloak you and then fire during the 3 seconds of damage bonus . 
  i used the geth infiltrator and used the proxy mine to decloak me and then fire a cloak bonused harpoon . 
  awesome weapon for the geth engineer . 
  with hundermode and chain overload you can stun and headshot enemies without a problem . 
  i used the stability mod rather than the scope to make it a better medium range weapon but both should work . 
  yes but i think they have to give it more than just increased damage . 
  i 'd like it if it had higher rof and less recoil so it would work like an smg that i can fit a piercing mod on . 
  avenger , mantis and katana are good even at gold with the right classes and mods . 
  i think you only get the damage bonus during the 3s after decloaking . 
  i used the kishock with the geth infiltrator and from what i could tell i did n't get a damage bonus if i charged , cloaked and then fired while cloaked . 
  but if i fired a proxy mine to decloak and then fired i did get a damage bonus . 
  well as i mentioned in my post , if you use an ability and then fire during the cloak window you can fire a fully charged kishock shot with the cloak bonus . 
  i thought hackett might become evil . 
  he kept reminding me of [ tarkins ] ( http://images.wikia.com/starwars/images/e/eb/tarkin1.jpg ) from star wars . 
  i went with [ this ] ( http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#14lmaor@0@0 ) build . 
  i can equip a eviscerator/katana/scimitar + the geth smg with ulm and have 200 % recharge speed . 
  then i walk around spamming ballistic blades at stuff . 
  it sucks at fbw farming but is very useful for maps when you have to stay on the move . 
  not to mention it 's hillarious to spam explosive blades at reapers at short range . 
  i think you will get points from objectives , and if you sabotage an atlas or a turret they will kill things for you giving you points . 
  you will also have to take out the atlas by yourself unless you manage to get cerberus to do that for you . 
  do n't feel bad . 
  i kinda thought the character was ftm transgender for a while . 
  ** the kishock does n't do the most damage **, 
  what ? 
  a fully charged kishock shot does almost as much damage as a javelin . 
  add the dot and it is the most damaging gun in the game . 
  let 's hope they make a war of 1812 expansion . 
  i do n't really see how it could be stressfull . 
  with 4 batarian soldiers spamming ballistic blades everything should just be staggered all the time . 
  maybe you had some problem with the cover + ballistic blade bug which made it harder ? 
  i havent found the batarian sentinel very useful but the soldier is a close range murder machine . 
  only problem is that ballistic blades do n't work from cover so you 'll have to stand in the open to use them . 
  ** tech armor power - base damage protection increased from 25 % to 35 % **, 
  soooo ... 50 % damage reduction krogan sentinel ? 
  edit : just started me3 to check . 
  yup , 50 % damage reduction krogan sentinel ... 
  well the batarian sentinel does n't have tech armor so this does n't affect him , only human , turian and krogan . 
  i think the geth turret damage is per shot while the quarian turrets damage is in dps . 
  bonus points of you do it as drell adept .
