  a big flat grassland with a ton of rivers , similar to amerish but with less mountains and more water . 
  i mean a bigger crater . 
  afaik searhus is a big volcanic mountain with a crater in the middle . 
  so the area around the crater will be on a hihger altitude than the warpgates . 
  what i mean is that the entire map is 70-90 % crater . 
  the warpgates are on the highest points of the map and pretty much everything else is in the slopes of the crater . 
  as i mentioned in [ my thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/planetside/comments/12ra47/melee_weapons_and_bayonets/ ) about it , i really really want swords , bayonets and other melee weapons !, 
  like i really really really want it . 
  i want to be able to pull out a sword and become [ this guy ] ( http://cfile26.uf.tistory.com/image/1379f0404fdd60392647d8 ) before being gunned down . 
  i do n't think so . 
  [ this is cyssor ] ( http://www.spectaclerock.com/spec/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/cyssor1.jpg ), 
  two very large islands and eight medium/large sized islands . 
  i mean that each warpgate get an island the size of the aja/bomazi islands to the left and the medium sized ones ranging in size from the ekera island to the gunuku islands , and then a ton of really small islands , kinda the like one south of bomazi . 
  i did actually suggest in [ another thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/planetside/comments/12q082/idea_for_an_outfit_based_on_warhammer_40k/c6x7k79 ) that squad and platoon leaders should get special skins so you could tell them apart from the rest of the squad . 
  and this kinda how i could envision a low battlerank ( br would determin the amount of bling ) nc squadleader would look like , except ofc , blue and yellow . 
  my suggestion wasnt just that we should be able to replace the knife with something else , but to have a melee weapon as secondary weapon and/or a pistol + melee combo as secondary ( with penalties to the pistols accuracy , recoil , reload and weapon switching ) . 
  just imagine running out of ammo for your main weapon , so you pull out your secondary , sword in right hand , pistol in left , and charge . 
  if nothing else , you 'll look cool as you die . 
  unfortunately there 's not that many pictures of jack churchill , and even fewer of him with a sword . 
  wow , just wow . 
  i never liked the reaver and felt it was weaker than the other esfs , because imo it had the handling of a brick and looked like it had a pretty big hitbox but i guess i was very very wrong ( unless this is a recent buff ) . 
  the reavers advantage should pretty much just be more health and higher damage per shot and possibly access to a shield like the vanugard ( other esfs should also have special abilites ) but not the ab bonus and smallest hitbox . 
   the great barrier reef is a natural wonder which can be found on coastal ocean tiles . 
  unlike other natural wonders , there can ( and often will be ) multiple great barrier reefs ( usually two ) , all of them found near each other , reflecting the great size of the real-life reef . 
  from the civ wiki . 
  [ this is an internal joke but i hope you 'll enjoy it anyway ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jkods.jpg ), 
  what about the lack of swords ? 
  maybe each faction could get their own sword + one that 's common pool . 
  something chainsword like for tr , something big , square and solid for nc and some lightsabresque for vs. then something like a katana or sabre for common pool . 
  well it should look futuristic and glow purple or cyan ( or both ) . 
  something like these . 
  or you know , a lightsabre . 
  we have motorized horses , they 're called flashes . 
  now imagine driving around on a flash with the ability to use your sword , grenades or c4 if you have any equiped .

  i play on medium/low and i have this problem . 
  everything else seems to render , buildings , vehicles and infantry , but then suddenly ammo tower , 10 meters in front of me . 
  oh god yes . 
  tried out the vs scout rifle yesterday and it was like the assault rifle and semi auto sniper fucked and had a baby . 
  20 round mag , high accuracy and with foregrip , compensator and reflex sight it became extremely accurate and i could just sneak around and ambush peopleat medium/close range . 
  might also be the first weapon were a silencer would be useful . 
  got asari sentinel and batarian vanguard in one psp and i finally got the ppr in the loyalty pack !, 
  and fyi , a vorcha flamer soldier with the ppr is the most fun i 've had in me3 for a long time . 
  the lack of swords . 
  we 're getting skull helmets ( and more afaik ) but so far no mentions about swords . 
  and melee weapons for maxes !, 
  a max using its charge ability to close the distance between itself and that cowardly engineer behind his mana turret to bash his head in ( or chop it off depending on the weapon ) , and then the heads of anyone not smart enough to run away . 
  it would be glorious !, 
  it reduceds hotizontal recoil and the downside is that it takes up your rail slot . 
  a second seat could be a main weapon slot item , so a 2 seat atv ca n't have a weapon but instead must rely on the passenger for shooting stuff . 
  while it 's not sci fi i would still recommend dwarf fortress to anyone who likes ftl . 
  just download the [ lazy newb pack ] ( http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=59026.0 ) , install one of the graphic packs that come with it and watch a few tutorials and you should be fine . 
  i would also recommend reading [ boatmurdered ] ( http://lparchive.org/dwarf-fortress-boatmurdered/introduction/ ) to get an idea what the game is all about . 
  written by hand , in cursive, 
  they need to fix the melee hit detection , add collision with enemy players and ofc , add swords . 
  it 's been a while since i tried meleeing enemies but in the last sword discussion here people said there 's no collision with enemies . 
  i did some testing and while i ca n't be 100 % sure since it 's kinda hard to get into bumping range but i 'm fairly sure there 's collision with enemies . 
  maybe they saw the melee thread and fixed it . 
  actually i think there is collision with enemies . 
  played a bit to test it and i 'm 95 % sure there 's collision with enemies . 
  any info on how all these chassis will work ? 
  do we unlock them or are they all avaliable from the start ? 
  do we chose them in the vehicle customization screen ? 
  player collision should be on with enemies and only half on with friendlies , like you collide but can still push through them if you have to . 
  i already said this in another thread but i can say it again . 
  tr squad and platoon leaders should look like [ this ] ( http://images.dakkadakka.com/gallery/2009/1/17/16256_md-commissar,%20imperial%20guard,%20vostroyan.jpg ) and ncs should look kinda like [ these guys ] ( http://fc02.deviantart.net/fs17/f/2007/190/a/0/imperial_guard_officers_by_ncodb.jpg ) . 
  squad leaders would get a hat , platoon leaders would get a hat and a cape . 
  the amount of bling would depend on battlerank ( and possibly how many medals you have ) . 
  no idea on how they would look like for vs but if anyone has any ideas i would be grateful . 
  then we just need swords and the look would be complete . 
  well even if they made a new interface , the modelers wouldnt have anything to do with it so they could still make hats and capes . 
  yeah , vanu reminds me more of eldar than tau . 
  maybe a vs officer would look kinda like an eldar warlock . 
  i disagree . 
  the nc are much more like normal guardsmen than catachan . 
  they have more conventional weaponry , armor , vehicles and tactics and they even look kinda similar , with their love for beige baggy pants and angular armor . 
  take the guy to the right on [ this ] ( http://www.games-workshop.com/media_customproductcatalog/m1241804_99060105209_cadianofficerspowerfistsmain_445x319.jpg ) picture . 
  make his armor blue and yellow rather than green and suddenly you have the perfect nc squad leader and the guys in the first picture would be the perfect platoon leaders . 
  besides , the nc are more organized than you think . 
  they 've devloped their own weapons and vehicles so they 're not just some random rebels who grabbed what they could and went to war . 
  they could get a special helmet or a hood . 
  imagine something like [ this ] ( http://i19.photobucket.com/albums/b170/saussure/eldarranger001.jpg ) but more vanu . 
  snarare `` i tried submitting this video to pornhub but it did n't let me because they do n't accept rape . '', 
   any more than 1 unlockable pistol ? 
  each faction has 1 unlockable pistol but i think the complaint here is about the umpteen other pistols we havent gotten to try yet . 
  kerbal space program ( hopefully 0.18 will come soon ) , dayz , me3 multiplayer . 
  larger magazines or extra spare ammo is worth it on most vehicles . 
  the first will result in less reloading and the latter is less trips back to the nearest friendly base . 
  this would have been really fucking cool , if we had swords . 
  the extra max burster cost 725 certs last i looked . 
  yup and the ha aa launcher , luckily the esf rocket pods cost 725 certs as well so at least ground units wo n't be completely murdered by air the first week ,, 
   ** incompetent ** squad leaders, 
  then do n't be in squads with bad squad leaders . 
  if you 're kicked from a squad because you were doing `` valuable , but xp-less tasks '' they would be doing you a favor since you can now find a good squad . 
  when i get 0.18 i 'll send an entire mun base over to bob . 
   if the squad leader is bad , then the valuable players will leave . 
  if the squad leader is that bad , then everyone should leave and join/create a better squad . 
   but it would definitely be a hostile atmosphere if new players join a squad , are n't doing too well , and get removed by the squad leader without so much as a word . 
  then maybe the new guy should join squads without xp sharing where this wouldnt be a problem or just squads that arent run by complete douchebags .
