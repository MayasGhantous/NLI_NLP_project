  i noticed this during the beta but i just assumed it was on purpouse and only for my own ammo pack as a way to prevent engineers from becoming one man artillery platforms . 
  but if the same thing happens with other engineers ammo packs it has to be a bug . 
  * 105mm zephyr for the lib, 
  * rocket pods for the esfs, 
  * he cannons for lightning and mbt, 
  * 20mm mg for flash, 
  * some gun for the sunderer and galaxy, 
  havent used it in a while but in the beta i found it kinda useful to drift around corners at `` faster than sprint '' speed and surprise people . 
  well i guess it should n't be spammable , and i doubt too many people would buy it . 
  i remember someone suggesting that all bases should get some sort of patroling defense robot that would walk/drive around and try to deal with attackers , like some sort of ai controlled super max . 
  but zebra camo , hood ornaments , chassi lights and skull masks fit into the `` lore '' ? 
  i think we crossed that line long ago . 
   [ plane girls ] ( http://madamepickwickartblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/plane1.jpg ) [ teeth ] ( http://imagecache6.allposters.com/lrg/27/2728/ajknd00z.jpg ), 
  that 's just some good old fashioned nose art , besides , i never complained about decals . 
   [ skull masks ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_vmls-x2tt9c/sabwvu3pj3i/aaaaaaaaaju/i2in36bwc-4/s400/army+soldier+skull+mask.jpg ), 
  the difference here is that in the ps2 universe someone is mass producing military grade helmests with skull motifs for all classes for all factions while your example is just some tacticool soldier who bought a cloth mask with a skull on it . 
  if real soldiers ran around with [ these ] ( http://img.alibaba.com/img/pb/668/305/503/503305668_752.jpg ) you would have a point but i 'm pretty sure they do n't . 
   [ camo ] ( http://hsfeatures.com/features04/images/c202_icr02.jpg ), 
  that 's real camo , like actual functional camo . 
  blue white zebra camo is n't . 
  i 've suggested this before but i can say it again . 
  they should change the role of the rocket pods from a2g to all-purpouse and give us a new a2g weapon , like bombs as a replacement . 
  rocket pods should have their damage reduced ( and possibly aoe as well ) , but increased projectile speed and less drop to compensate , making it better against aircrafts and individual units , but worse against tanks and groups of infantry . 
  the bombs should be good old unguided bombs , requiring more skill from the pilot since where you hit would depend on your speed , altitude and the direction you 're going and not just where you 're aiming . 
  plus you would n't be able to just hover somewhere and spam rockets at your target but rather you 'd have to fly towards them . 
  but for those who can use them they should be much more rewarding than current a2g rockets with a much faster ttk if you hit with all your bombs . 
  ** tldr : rockets should be changed into an all-purpouse weapon for skilled dogfighters and bad a2g pilots and a new weapon , bombs should take the a2g role , but requiring more skill **, 
  * defense matrix, 
  * an anti-armor tech power like incinerate or flamer , or a completely new one, 
  * lastly , an anti-shield/barrier power that hits everything in an arc , like snap freeze or ballistic blades . 
  * same shield and hp as the current geth soldier . 
  basically a tanky short range engineer with some cc from the electricity-cone ability . 
  melee weapons . 
  a new weapon type that would greatly improve your melee capabilities in exchange for taking up one of your weapon slots and adding weight . 
  would get benefits from both melee and weapon bonuses and the effects of ammo powers . 
  it appears to have rcs thrusters but even without them it should be able to turn , at least my ion rover did . 
  i have to go with pulaski just because i found crusher to be so damn boring . 
  well the main problem is that ha is right next to engineer in the deployment screen so sometimes you 'll accidentally spawn as ha and get into your vehicle thinking you are an engineer , only to find out you are not when you blow yourself up a few minutes later . 
  i do that in eve and star trek online . 
  good ship names and a way to find fellow culture fans . 
  good thing too because that 's how i found out about the hydrogen sonata . 
  pretty much what i was gon na say . 
  with a cyclonic modulator iii and some other gear i had my first platinum victory just because this class will not die ( unless sync killed or lagging ) .

  [ 6/6/0 / 6/6 ] ( http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#soldier/vorcha/poaop/particlerifle1ad5af5///// ) with a focus on durability and flamer damage . 
  ppr with extended magazine and piercing mod . 
  the reason why i like this combo is because i do n't have to worry about ammo so i never have to stop fighting and the recharging ammo synergizes very well with the flamer recharge so i can just alternate between them for a neverending stream of damage . 
  quite a contrast to [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wwie6dkqza ) ad . 
  soooo ... 
  [ crazy legs scout ] ( http://www.teamfortress.com/images/posts/crazylegs.jpg ) did n't actually die , he just changed to another red team . 
  i think they should get access to a timed charge instead . 
  a lot more powerful than the c4 , but it makes a beeping noise , has ( faction colored ) flashing lights and can be defused by an engineer or infiltrator . 
  they should also be able to plant bombs generators without sounding the alarm ( but again , beeping noise and lights ) to make them better at infiltrating bases and taking out unguarded objectives . 
  sharpening the sword/blade/something [ fed ] . 
  i would n't say it 's a good mission , but it 's fairly short , space combat only and the enemies can be surprisingly though , mostly due to their use of abilites all the time . 
  tldr : defeat 6 waves of federation ships , get profit . 
  q __ q, 
  they 're not exactly the same , they 've kinda swapped the engineering/tactical on the two science vessels and science/tactical on the cruisers but otherwise yes , they 're the same as the standard ships . 
  why what happens ? 
  me and my friends used to think like that , until we played dayz . 
  and the ability to timewarp ( to a certain extent ) while the engines are on . 
  i did n't know that , and i agree about the ion engines . 
  maybe the max timewarp could depend on how many newtons of thrust you have , so with ion engines you could timewarp maybe 1000x but with a mainsail , just 4x . 
  when ( if ) they add supervehicles similar to bf2142 titans , then they should cost so much resouces you 'd need something like the resources of an entire platoon to afford one . 
  another idea would be that auraxium would return to the game , as an outfit only resource , that is earned by the outfit memebers ... doing stuff ... and can only be used for huge special things , like titans , large ships , maybe oribtal bombardment etc etc. 
  in one of my older posts about something similar i suggested something like a maximum of 3 titans ( supervehicles ) per faction per continent . 
  then add an extremely long spawntimer ( and maybe even a shorter one applying to everyone on your faction on that continent ) to prevent a new supervehicle to pop out everytime one is destroyed . 
  best i can do is 3.50 . 
  could take the main weapon slot , so you 'll have to rely on the passenger for shooting stuff , and he ca n't shoot things in front of you . 
  i really like ezri dax . 
  they 're already making namalsk intresting , these and the blowouts that is . 
  do the probes have any solar cells or are they suppose to survive on their batteries ?

  ( confused gandalf ), 
  new packs ? 
  i think infiltrators should get something like a timed charge rather than a remote detonated c4 . 
  make it a lot more powerful than the c4 , but give it a 20 ( ish ) second timer and have it beep and stuff so it 's fairly easily noticable . 
  engineers and infiltrators should be able to defuse by aiming at it and pressing e. 
  as a bonus , maybe they could use it on generators to blow them up without sounding the `` base has been compromised '' alarm , or maybe just give infiltrators that ability by default . 
  i 've had some ideas for something like this . 
  a big fragile support vehicle that can be equiped with howitzers , large mortars , rocket launchers , aa guns , shield generators and radars . 
  should be as big as a sundy , slower than an mbt and be as fragile as a lightning and they should show up on the map after a while . 
  might make a thread about it later ,, 
  well i think that they 'll add the [ deliverer ] ( http://wiki.planetsidesyndicate.com/index.php?title=deliverer ) from ps1 to ps2 in some future update so that would cover the jeep part . 
  and i think you 're right about the tracked sunderer just being some special esamir sundy . 
  if you just want a beamboat , buy a mirror universe cruiser or science vessel on the exchange . 
  the science vessels are extremely cheap , 50-70k ec . 
  what if taylor and adele got together and then broke up after a year or so ? 
  same here . 
  luckily i got my xi borg set on my main long ago , before they added the reputation system because after looking at this i 'm pretty much just gon na give up on improving my reputation . 
  if soe would give us swords as a secondary weapon ( and some big ones for maxs ) we 'd be halfway there . 
  edit : and bayonets as a rail attachment , same damage as the current melee but faster and with longer range . 
  op probably just did n't know that you can respawn if your leg is broken .
