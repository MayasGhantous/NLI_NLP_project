  i started to like siam quite recently after i finally noticed that pledging to protect increases your standard relation with a city state by 10 . 
  since it stacks with the social policy that increases it by 20 i could be friend with every single city state at the small cost of having to spam `` you will pay for that '' to every other civilization in the game . 
  yes it does , but i did n't know about that until recently . 
  and wince i now know that by simply putting two social policies into patronage and then pledging to protect every city state i find i can get some very nice culture and faith bonuses for almost zero effort . 
  the reason this makes me like siam is simply because now i can use his ua without bothering with bribery , missions or election shennanigans . 
  then they 're not really bronies , just mlp fans . 
  yes . 
  not my hardest but one that i have to make very often , where should i put my citadel ? 
  maybe so but arma 2 and 3 has ( imo ) a lot more color than most shooters . 
  if they would get an information era upgrade i 'd prefer a new ground unit ( nanosuit commandos ? ), 
  than them suddenly becoming aircrafts . 
  predator drones could be some sort of alternative to jet fighters , with lower production cost and not requiring any strategic resources , but lower combat strength and only capable of attacking ground and naval units . 
  indeed . 
  infantry displacement for max should be the upcoming melee weapons . 
  a max charging at you with a 2m long sword should get anyone to displace as fast as they can . 
  unfortunately according to [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/planetside/comments/1ac90s/game_update_4_content_analysis_80_images_of/ ) tr maxes will get some [ spiky glove/giant brass knuckles ] ( http://i.imgur.com/w4vbffp.png ) for melee while vs and nc will get swords and hammers . 
  tr should just get chainswords , especially since in ps1 their knife was literally a small chainsword . 
  [ r.i.p. 
  i actually still have it installed . 
  is there anyway for me to extract the files and share them ? 
  i think most bonuses stack additively . 
  i have to agree with some people here that one of the main problems with vanu is that they do n't feel right . 
  weapon sounds are pretty bad , weapon model variation is horrible ( can barely tell the difference between my lasher and my orion ) and our infantry just look ugly . 
  then there 's the fact that our `` special '' niche when it comes to infantry weapon is n't that useful , noticable or fun . 
  one thing soe could do is to make the so called laser weapons act like actual laser weapons , with hitscan or something , like the saron or hailstorm turbolaser . 
  at least then we 'd have something really unique . 
  i only have 3 ha main weapons so my way of telling what weapon i have is to check if i have 50 ( orion ) , 75 ( lasher ) or 100 ( dunno ) round mags . 
  from planetside syndicate about the different max abilites . 
  * ** new conglomerate max units are equipped with a light energy shield . 
  the shield draws power from from an onboard max capacitor . 
  once depleted , the capacitor will recharge . 
  the max unit can not fire when the shield is active . 
  * ** terran republic max units have 2 special abilities . 
  the first is the ability to `` lock down '' , doubling their rate of fire and reducing the cone of fire at the cost of no movement . 
  aiming is possible , but the range of pivot is extremely reduced . 
  the second is `` overdrive '' which , similar to the nc and vs maxes , works off capacitor . 
  when active , the max can fire at 1.5 x the normal rate and still move around . 
  overdrive is `` all-or-nothing , '' meaning that once active , it can not be turned off until the capacitor is drained . 
  the max may not lock down or auto-run while in overdrive . 
  maxes with overdrive active will glow red . 
  * ** vanu sovereignty max units are equipped with limited jump-jets . 
  these jump jets draw power from an onboard max capacitor . 
  once depleted , the capacitor will recharge . 
  so nc had a tanking ability , tr and rof ability and vs a mobility ability , like it should be . 
  let 's hope we ( the community ) can get soe to cave in and give us the jump-jets . 
  otherwise i suggest cloaking as the vs max ability , we do seem to be portrayed as the stealthy faction pretty often . 
   but the range of pivot is extremely reduced . 
  i could think of some reasons , like maybe the high energy laser will hit some dust particles in the way , that turn into plasma , that in turn heats up the air , which then expands , some of which right in front of the `` barrel '' , causing some minor recoil and a visible beam . 
  yeah , those were the old ps1 max abilites . 
  that 's kinda my point . 
  it 's called the hailstorm turbo ** laser ** but does n't act like a laser at all . 
  so they should either change how it works or change its name and description . 
  try [ this ] ( http://www.mediafire.com/?ctqptidb23hjlry ) . 
  it 's a rare file of the extended eras mod folder . 
  put it in < my documents  / my games/sid meier 's civilization v/mods / and tell me if it works . 
  not really . 
  there 's no way to tell if a tank was spotted by you , your squad leader or some other random dude . 
  besides , in any larger engagement everyone will just spam q anyway so pretty much every enemy vehicle will be spotted all the time ,, 
  they could have used young comstocks voice for the alternate bookers voxophone recordings and the voice we hear is the one booker hear . 
  i mean , we do n't hear our own voice the same way everyone else does . 
  i forgot . 
  you have to choose historic as game speed . 
  contracry to popular belief , most vs weapons are in fact not really laser weapons but rather plasma weapons . 
  from the ps wiki `` the vs weapons rely on quickly energizing a splash of plasma-like ammunition '', 
  or this from planetside universe, 
  `` directed energy arrays that accelerate highly confined plasma using ultra-short , high intensity laser pulses , producing a series of charged particle pulses in quick succession which kill either by rapidly vapourising the surface of a target into more plasma ( causing its outermost layers to , essentially , explode ) , or by ( in the case of anti-armour weapons ) suddenly losing confinement upon coming into contact with the surface of the target , where a single larger plasma `` shot '' explodes upon contact . '', 
  so essentially , vs guns use lasers to launch plasma at their enemies . 
  but i do agree with you on the beam thing , or at least for weapons like the saron hrb and saron laser cannon . 
  as many have pointed out , one the things vs really needs is a overhaul to make them look and sound better . 
  i think one thing vanu could get to make their weapons feel a bit more special ( other than the accuracy , recoild etc ) would be for some weapons to have a charge mechanic , similar to the lancer . 
  imagine if we could charge the beamer to fire one very powerful shot , that you then follow up with a series of weaker ones . 
  this could potentially be added to pretty much every vs weapon capable of firing in semi-auto , with possible exceptions like the shotguns and sniper rifles since those could be pretty op . 
  well that 's not really that bad for a burster max , but the limited arc of fire would be pretty bad since you 'd be unable to track your target . 
  mostly, 
  because soe hates vanu . 
  i personally really liked flotilla and would say that it alone is worth the 1 $ . 
  it 's kinda like a roguelike simultaneous-turnbased space combat game . 
  the video exlains it pretty well imo . 
  the community says yes , but soe says no . 
   it would be op beyond belief and simply break the game . 
  it was op beyond belief and did break the game . 
  i guess i just got stuck on your choice of words . 
  `` would be '' just makes it sound kinda hypothetical . 
   after a while you do n't care because the innocent people are dumb for getting into a bad situation . 
  exactly . 
  only people i feel sorry for are suicide gank victims , or at least those who did n't bring it on themselves by being valuable enough to kill . 
  i did n't even feel bad when me and some friends accidentally got a whole bunch of allies killed during a station siege . 
  they though our little 3 man gang was a part of a larger group of reinforcements so they left the station in a counter attack and ended up getting massacared . 
  personally i think vs should sound [ more ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3nnj1qaszc ) [ like ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w7fpwdkvi0 ) [ eldars ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qofzfwi4om ), 
  edit : or possibly like the [ sm librarian ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf_3ztp4eg4 ) . 
   the shield damage resistance and shield regeneration attributes of this power now last 20 seconds , down from 30 seconds .
