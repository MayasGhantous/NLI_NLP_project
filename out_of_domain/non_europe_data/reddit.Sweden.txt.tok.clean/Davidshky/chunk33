  after trying out the iroquoi i have to say [ mohawk warriors ] ( http://civilization.wikia.com/wiki/mohawk_warrior_%28civ5%29 ) . 
  i was going tall and had very little iron ( 4 iirc ) but these fuckers saved the day . 
  with the absurd production i got from the forests i was able to just spam these at my attackers and in the end pretty much made a defensive line stretching all around my kingdom . 
  only problem is that you 'll need access to some iron to upgrade them to musketme later since you have to turn them into longsword men first but that 's not too hard . 
  mortars need a slight decrease in damage and a major decrease in aoe . 
  i think flamethrowers are mostly fine , the problem is rather the fact that it 's so easy to just charge the enemy straight on . 
  if i have some grenadiers , lets say 2 squads , sitting behind some cover , and a russian engineer squad with a flamethrower comes charging right at them in the open , the engineers should die long before getting in range . 
  i think the russians need some better at options for infantry . 
  a damage increase or cost decrease for at grenades and maybe some sort of ability for guard infantry that would damage/destroy a random part of the target vehicle at the cost of 20-30 munition . 
  i once threw 8 at grenades ( by accident ) at a flakpanzer and the damn thing only got immobilized . 
  t34/85 and is-2 need a buff in armor penetration . 
  someone on the forums dug through the files and found all the vehicle stats and the t34/85 and is-2 have the same armor penetration as the stug 3 . 
  the stug 3 could either need some sort of nerf or an increase in cost . 
  200 manpower and 50 fuel just makes them too spammable . 
  bunkers need a hp buff or something because imo , they die way too easily . 
  the russians need some sort of defensive building as well , something like the british slit trench on coh : of . 
  support weapon teams should be able to build some sort of improvised firebase around themselves ( possibly through a doctrine ) that would give them some protection against bullets and a lot of protection against the aoe from near misses . 
  edit : maybe the firebase could be a new building built by engineer/pioneers that 's very similar to a bunker , but made for hmgs , mortars and at guns . 
  that 's what i did . 
  took a while since i had a fuckton of warriors but that was a good thing since then i ended up with a lot musketmen with the mohawk bonus . 
  what kind of pictures are you looking for ? 
   the russians really need a bunker emplacement, 
  trenches . 
  the russians should get trenches like the coh : of brits that are very cheap or possibly even free that can be built by engineers and maybe conscripts/penal squad/etc with a doctrine . 
   a significant damage reduction of about 75 %, 
   an accuracy reduction of about 80 % to all weapons firing at the entrenched unit, 
   complete immunity to suppression, 
  i see what you mean but there 's no reason the russians could n't get a slightly less op trench . 
  just because something is op in one game does n't mean it 's op in every other game . 
   though it would help against all those late game explosions . 
  exactly . 
  also , the slit trenches could have some penalties , like having their fov and field of fire obstructed more by terrain compared to infantry out of or in normal cover . 
  so it effectively they would trade offense for defense . 
  that 's because the of trenches were too good . 
   a significant damage reduction of about 75 %, 
   an accuracy reduction of about 80 % to all weapons firing at the entrenched unit, 
   complete immunity to suppression, 
  remove the dr and change the last point into a resistance to supression rather than an immunity and they should n't be so horribly op . 
  well then . 
  the reason i think the russians should get trenches is mostly because you need some way to protect infantry against artillery . 
  units in the trench could get penalties to their fov and field of fire to make it more balanced and make the sandbags remain useful . 
  i feel like lategame is mostly just tanks and rockets . 
  the latter forcing people to use the former . 
  and about the firebases , my idea for a penalty would be that it would take longer for a unit to get out from a firebase . 
  like it would take a few seconds to untrench ( ? ), 
  the unit before you can even give the retreat order , making them much more vulnerable to grenades and being flanked since they would n't be able to just run . 
  i once managed to win a 3v3 match with 29 points remaining by desperately rushing the two enemy vps with conscripts in scout cars . 
  strangely enough , the enemy never tried to take back the left vp i had captures midgame even though we had nothing anywhere near it . 
  best part was that i did n't just succeed at capturing the undefended right point , but also the middle one even though there were about 4-5 tanks shooting at my conscripts . 
  give the esfs a few seconds of invulnerability as they exit the tube , and if they collide with an enemy during these few seconds it will be the enemy who blows up . 
   they should have never allowed more than one character on a server cross faction . 
  no , they should just add a timer or something so to limit the amount of character changing . 
   a ** vs max ** is still going to ** tear ** an nc max up at ** ~ 50m **, 
  haha , no . 
  at 50m the nc max could just ignore the vs max and walk somewhere else . 
  maybe if the nc max was immobilized or afk and the vs max had a lot of ammo . 
  i 'm just upset the shield will be an nc ability rather than a `` weapon '' that all factions had . 
  just let me steal the shield from a mana turret and put in on one of my arms . 
  50 % less firepower for some extra forward protection . 
  hmmm , 100 % dr to the front in exchange for only being able to bunch people . 
  could actually be balanced . 
  unless you stand in a corner or doorway or something . 
  i was thinking more like the soldier standing on a purple frisbee that has some built in anti-grav and force field generators . 
  we 're talking about theoretical shields that would take up a weapon slot and he would like to use two of them , thus not having any weapons . 
  i want ** many ** things , this is just one of them . 
  well maybe not a frisbee . 
  but imagine a large , fairly thick , purple metal disc , about the size of the bottom of the [ current drop pod ] ( http://oi45.tinypic.com/slgrqo.jpg ) , maybe a little bit smaller , that generates a force field around itself and its passenger and uses some sort of gravity tech , both for control and deaccelration but also to give the passenger a comfortable ride as he falls towards the ground . 
  yes , but then he would only have 1 shield . 
  and ? 
  it 's not like the factions ca n't start making their own pods . 
  well it 's apparently only once per city and i guess you can only steal technologies the owner of the city has so you 'd be going up against a technologically superior foe , or there would n't be much to steal . 
  the snipers did n't get decreased damage though , they were exactly the same as the nc and tr snipers . 
  their leader is a viking king standing on a longship . 
  one of their uus is the berserker and their ua is called viking fury . 
  hodor !, 
  hodor, 
  lashers secondary fire should be a charged shot , like the lancer and upcoming vs pistol . 
  i can give you deus ex 1 , devil may cry 3 and half life 2 eiposide one . 
  while i do agree , i also think they should change the default voices . 
  forcing people to pay to not sound like little kids would just be evil and besides , i think the default voices should match each faction better . 
  vs should sound more calm and cyborgy , kinda like [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3nnj1qaszc ) , [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qofzfwi4om ) or [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf_3ztp4eg4 ) . 
  current voices just sound too `` normal '' . 
  tr and nc are trickier but i guess tr should sound more like experienced professional soldiers and nc more like rough working class people or something, 
  maybe also give maxs different voices . 
  imagine a vs max sounding like [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w7fpwdkvi0 ), 
  and one of the swedish uus is finnish . 
  could also be the fleet version . 
  it 's pretty popular since the fsms are avaliable on the market so you can get it with ec instead of dil/zen . 
  it 's because you need several lashers to be effective . 
  unless you 're working as a team , an lmg will be better 90 % of the time . 
  one lasher = low dps over a small area . 
  your ttk will be too high and your target will most likely be able to kill you first . 
  a couple of lashers = good dps over a small area or low dps over a large area . 
  with maybe 2-4 lashers , your combined dps will be high enough to kill the target before he kills any of you , and you 're able to hit several people at once . 
  or you can do low dps to many targets at once , but then you 'll have the same problem as with one lasher . 
  many lashers = good dps over a large area . 
  now , if you have enough lashers , you can just spam at any enemy you see and your combined dps will just melt any infantry in range , but this is hard to pull off since you 'll need many has with lashers . 
  yeah . 
  the russians need some buffs . 
  especially in the anti-tank department .
