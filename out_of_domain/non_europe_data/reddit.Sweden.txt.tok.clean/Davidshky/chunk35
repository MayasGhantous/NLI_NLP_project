  the `` helicopter '' could be a 6 seat aricraft , 1 pilot , 1 gunner , 4 passengers that can use their weapons . 
  this aircraft could be good at fighting ground forces but would be a lot more exposed to both aa and normal weapons than the liberator . 
  20 + and they get the ability to fly . 
  swarms of vs maxs flying over the battlefield like mini-liberators launching hot plasma death at the plebs below . 
  i agree . 
  i do n't wan na put all my schrecks in one basket . 
  i prefer having 1 schreck per squad , but more because i want to keep the squads anti-infantry capabilites and because other than xp , my squads would then be more equal and losing one would n't hurt as much as losing a dedicated at squad . 
   t70 , ** su76 ** and halftracks are considered 320 hp units, 
   su85 , t34 , ostwind , panzer 4 , ** stug ** are considered 640 hp units, 
  well that explains a thing or two . 
  yeah i guess it could be useful against cover , and a direct hit does most likely kill a soldier , but from my own experience , an stg 44 is generally a better alternative for fighting infantry , or at least it 's more reliable . 
  yeah . 
  i found out about that later on the beta forums . 
  how would a futuristic version of [ this ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-o0yvpvpy0t0/t1kirs5amvi/aaaaaaaab4u/bxp0y0cgst0/s1600/mil_mi-24_hind_helicopter_art_asa+rotativa.jpg ) = = liberator ? 
  sexcelsior obviously . 
  just a guess but i would say kv-1 and 2 . 
  the first one because i swear the kv-8 calls itself kv-1 sometimes when it talks , so there 's probably a kv-1 or they were planning on having a kv-1 in the game . 
  kv-2 because for me , it 's one of the iconic russian tanks , even if it was pretty rare . 
  edit : also the [ 88mm flak ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8.8_cm_flak_18/36/37/41 ) and [ 20mm flak ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2_cm_flak_30/38/flakvierling ) cannons . 
  mostly because i think these are the guns you can see in one of the loading screens . 
  the 20mm gun could be an intresting doctrinal upgrade of the hmg . 
  maybe the simulation is running so fast that the entire human history , from the beginning to it 's end , will pass in the blink of an eye for them , and maybe , just maybe they 'll notice us in a log at the end of the simulation . 
  edit : reddit gold , 
  well last night was after the last patch was it not , cause then the is-2 would have been buffed . 
  some way to upgrade the su-85 to a su-100 maybe , like a with tank destroyer doctrine . 
  it 's already in the game as one of the russians late-game units . 
  you get it from the same building as the su-76 and su-85 . 
  flamethrower engineers in a scoutcar is always nice early in the game , especially vs support teams . 
  consctipts/engineers in a scout car also makes a very nice and cheap vp rush unit , won a game with 29 tickets left once by sending two scout cars with conscripts to the enemy vps . 
  building a sniper as soon as possible can be very useful as long as you can provide it with a squad for protection . 
  forced 6 russian squads to retreat with just a sniper and a grenadier squad because the enemies did n't have the equipment to take out a sniper in a building without first having to get through the grenadiers . 
  the longbowmen start with the +1 range upgrade , but afaik , that means you ca n't take it again . 
   completing the full tour the galaxy challenge now rewards the `` well travelled '' trait as a free bonus trait . 
   this trait grants your captain a permanent reduction in transwarp cooldown . 
  well i know what i will be doing with my sexcelsior . 
  only problem i have with the ns weapons is that as a vs , i get confused when my teammates are using them . 
  ns vehicles on the other hand i do n't like . 
  they should at least have different models . 
  the ns vehicles just look so ... nc . 
  but what about this ? 
  how are ost squads ? 
  weapons , upgrades , abilites etc ? 
   we had # 2 back in beta , and what often happened was people would roll in and cap the scu before the battle even begun, 
  i might be wrong , but did n't you destroy scus and other generators in the beta by shooting at them ? 
  a squad shooting at a generator took it out in a few seconds unlike now when the attackers would have to wait for a while . 
  as long as there is some `` scu under attack '' thing on the map and the scu is close/right next to the spawnroom in smaller bases i think it would work . 
  if the defenders are unable to get out of the spawnroom and defuse the scu in 1 minute they 've probably already lost . 
  the 5th russian commander in the beta have the rapid conscription ability which replaces losses with conscripts while active . 
  indeed . 
  the first group to to succesfully domesticate , breed and sell red pandas would probably swim in money . 
  iirc , back in the beta , scus and other generators were blown up using good old firepower . 
  that way a squad could blow them up in seconds with rockets , c4 and even normal weapons . 
  nowdays we ca n't do that but instead we have to overload the reactor and then prevent the defenders from defusing it . 
  i agree , but only as long as the scu is fairly close to the spawnroom . 
  it should only really be possible to blow it up once the defenders have been driven back into the spawnroom so that destroying the scu is used to reduce the time spent spawncamping rather than a way to win the fight itself . 
  support it with cheaper vehicles and infantry . 
  panzergrenadiers with panzerschrecks should be pretty effective . 
  and use something to scout ahead since tanks tend to have much longer range than sight radius . 
  if you can start shooting at the t-34 before it 's in ramming range it 's pretty screwed . 
   definitely a tier 50 light cruiser, 
  yes please . 
  been saying the same thing myself . 
  it should be a cruiser/escort hybrid since it 's pretty small and can use dcs . 
  should look very similar to the miranda but more modern and have access to the tye 6 material . 
  it 's not about the weed . 
  it 's about sending a message . 
  come on . 
  the jenner class is not that ugly . 
  i think it as changed . 
  i 'm pretty sure that the is-2 got a penetration buff , same for the stug but that thing also became a lot more expensive . 
  what about a completely new ship that just kinda based on the miranda but is in no way the same ship , like the stargazer class and the constellation class . 
  similar placement of the parts but nothing more . 
  and no access to the light cruiser parts in ship customization . 
  i 'd like a kotor/dragon age type game made by valve , set in the team fortress universe with the 9 classes as party members . 
  my soviet build order lately has been like this . 
  * 1 second engineer squad . 
  * 2 build special rifle building . 
  * 3 build scout car and snipers . 
  * 4 ammo/fuel dumps . 
  * 5 keep building scout cars and infantry, 
  * 6 tank building, 
  * 7 t-34s , lots of them . 
   new design unrelated in all ways to the t1 light cruisers, 
  i 'm talking more about a completely new ship that 's a spiritual successor of the miranda class rather than a retrofit or a refit . 
  it should be to the miranda what the [ heavy cruisers ] ( http://www.stowiki.org/heavy_cruiser ) are to the [ constellation class ] ( http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/constellation_class ) . 
  similar basic design , with the nacelles under the hull and saucer and a `` roll bar '' on top , but not a single light cruiser part in it nor avaliable in the ship customization . 
   then i do n't get what the point is . 
  the point is that the miranda class is one of the more unique looking ships that 's very different from the standard federation ship design . 
  it 's a shame to simply let the whole design go to waste because of cbs . 
  i 've only done this once but it was hillarious and i hope to do it more times . 
  i play as engineer and a friend as ha with the striker . 
  we then get on a flash with him as the passenger and then drive around and try to kill aircrafts and annoy tanks . 
  it also allowed us to get to strange camping positions where pilots would n't expect to take fire from . 
  hopefully i can get some other friends to start playing again cause then we 'd be able to have 2 has with lock-on launchers and take out esfs in one salvo . 
  rather than just having a slot for stuff like that , you should get a menu with all the ornaments avaliable for that vehicle ( those you own at the top ) and checkboxes for which ornaments you want to equip . 
  that way you could equip as many ornaments as you want unless they are mutually exclusive , ie , are the same type of ornament . 
  people would buy more ornaments , soe would make more money , soe would hopefully keep improving the game . 
  everyone is happy . 
  the whole idea is that i use a very few troops in the beginning , mostly just a sniper squad in a scout car to support my allies and hunt enemy pioneers ( very effective ) and some engineers to do the capturing and building . 
  this allows me to spend almost all my manpower on fuel dumps instead of units .
