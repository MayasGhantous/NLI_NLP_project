  i still think that the shield should have been a `` weapon '' rather than an ability . 
  in exchange for sacrificng 50 % of your firepower the shield would make you extremely hard to kill unless flanked , like maybe a 75 % damage reduction to the front . 
  pretty much just a modified mana turret shield strapped tou your arm . 
  i do n't get it . 
  and now i feel stupid . 
  yeah , it should also work very well with the max melee weapons that are propably coming . 
  close , tr will be getting brass knuckles . 
  yes , but at least that would require some amount of skill and it would still be better than no warning at all . 
  yes , yes it is . 
  but according to [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/planetside/comments/1ac90s/game_update_4_content_analysis_80_images_of/ ) tr will most likely get brass knuckles . 
  imo , you should get chainswords , like a huge version of the tr ps1 knife . 
  yes , but replace the wax with a gold coin and the parchments with banknotes . 
  after all , it is nc we 're talking about . 
  i have n't seen any stug spam since they buffed it and increased the cost , now it 's like a german su-85 . 
  you mean something like [ this ] ( http://imgur.com/ax10f2n ) ? 
  i think they renamed that category `` heavy '' or something . 
  bursters maxs are too powerful for their price , size and avaliability . 
  lolpods turn a2g combat into a point-and-click game unless there 's aa shooting at you . 
  they 're also too good vs gals and libs making them at least decent vs everything but other esfs . 
  g2a missiles more or less force people to have flares , should have shorter range or be more `` dodgable '' . 
  all aircrafts are imo too slow , especially esfs . 
  i 'd like to see a test where they increase the speed of all aircrafts by about 50 % but reduce health as well . 
  imo , the time should depend on the size of the base , which in turn should decide how far the scu is from the spawn . 
  the larger the base , the longer the timer is , but the scu is further away from the spawn . 
  i know . 
  but scus used to be destroyed by pure firepower , meaning that a group of players could take one out in a few seconds . 
  5 guys could run up to the scu , empty one mag each and all of the sudden the battle was more or less won . 
  since that is n't possibly anymore there 's no reason soe ca n't find a way to reintroduce scus to all bases . 
  this might be a stupid question but are you sure it 's the same account ? 
  fall of the samurai . 
  artillery , units to protect the artillery , some cavalry to charge the wavering enemies and hopefully a decent fleet giving support . 
  i usually just line up my artillery and infantry together , put cavalry and sharpshooters at my flanks and go to work . 
  with 4 + groups of parrot or armstrong guns you should be able to simply bombard the enemy until they 're so weak that you can simply rout them with the rest of your army . 
  once i attacked a citadel defended by about 15 groups of imerpail infantry , some garrison troops and a general . 
  i only lost 16 soldiers and i think most of those were from friendly fire . 
  6 groups of parrot guns + a general with the 50 % extra ammo upgrade enabled me to simply sit outside the citadel and bombard it until everyone was routing or dead . 
  3 barrages of 48 explosive shells each also helps . 
  i 'd prefer the esfs as the light fighters and some sort of ns `` helicopter '' as a heavy fighter . 
  the esfs could get a speed and agility boost but also a hp reduction . 
  the ns `` helicopter '' could be like a futuristic blackhawk/mi -24 with some passenger seats and weapons suited for short range fire support . 
  i think it would have been better if you said `` ns fighter '' since the liberator and galaxy are already ns aircrafts . 
  the liberator is more like a small bomber / [ ac-130 gunship ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lockheed_ac-130 ) hybrid made for shooting at stuff from far away . 
  i 'm suggesting something more like a hybrid between [ this ] ( http://www.giornalettismo.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/mi-24.jpg ) and [ this ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9a/us_army_uh-60_black_hawk_%282053749088%29.jpg ) . 
  maybe so , but i think changing the lib like that could be kinda tricky and would probably require a major change to the model . 
  also , iirc , they 're gon na try to put most of the ps1 vehicles into ps2 , and this could possibly double as both the phantasm transport and something like the ps1 reaver light gunship . 
   esf 's are too good at everything at the same time . 
  exactly . 
  rocketpods are good vs everything but other esfs . 
  imo , they should have a role change from anti-ground to all purpose and be rebalanced to be decent vs everything rather than good vs everything but esfs . 
  it should be the secondary weapon equivalent of the default esf main guns . 
  then they should get bombs ( or something similar ) as a new anti-ground weapon to take the role that the current rocketpods are supposed to have . 
  they could even be more powerful than the pods in exchange for being harder to use rather than just point and shoot . 
  that way we 'd also have anti-air , anti-ground and all-purpose weapons for both the main and secondary slot of esfs . 
  i do n't doubt for a second that in the hands of a good pilot , they can be very effective vs esfs , but i 'm not one of those pilots , nor are the majority of pilots i 've fought . 
   i see not a single reason to pull a skyguard over a max, 
  speed , but that 's about it . 
  well we might be getting max melee weapons `` soon '' . 
  someone found the model files in some previous gu . 
   less durable than a skyguard, 
  someting which is completely made up for by the maxs small size . 
  i once saw a burster max take 3 full rocket salvos to kill , something i have never seen a skyguard do . 
  just make one character of each faction , play around a bit with the starting weapons and then visit the vr to try out the rest . 
  good point . 
  though at least the skyguard would be able to fire on the move unlike a travel max . 
  no , i 'm pretty sure it was called `` heavy gun '' last time i checked , though that might just have been the test server . 
   think long duration cloak is a better option, 
  this could be an option but then the cloak should also be better , like for example not being affected by the speed of the phantasm . 
  i also agree that infantry should n't have the fall damage immunity like those jumping out of a galaxy . 
  possibly a slight resistance , so that they can jump out at , lets say 5 meters , and not take any damage as long as the phantasm is n't moving too fast . 
  well the galaxy would have more health , unit capacity , aa defenses and hopefully in the future , the ability to transport vehicles . 
  i do n't think i have ever seen a galaxy die before it reaches its target , and since infantry can just jump out and not take any fall damage it does n't even have to land . 
  well the name is n't important , i just chose to call it the phantasm because well ... that 's what the stealth transport was called in ps1 . 
  i feel the same way . 
  i wish we could at least switch to semi-auto . 
  i 've had more or less the same ideas about air balance . 
  turn the current esfs into your asfs and introduce a new aircraft for the ground attack role . 
  esfs would get an increase in speed , agility and rof , but also a significant reduction in health . 
  would have to have some way to avoid lock-on missiles without flares . 
  rockets would be turned into an all-purpose weapon ( better vs air , worse vs ground ) and bombs would take up the a2g role , enabling esfs to act as dive bombers . 
  make them more like vtol fighters and less like attack helicopters . 
  for the `` gsf '' the phantasm gunship i 'm suggesting in [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/planetside/comments/1dcnud/idea_phantasm_gunship/ ) thread should fit that role pretty well . 
  more or less a hybrid between the ps1 reaver and the phantasm . 
   none that can handle general purpose . 
  esf with rockets and default main gun ? 
  i just want to make esfs more like vtol fighters and less like helicopters . 
  they should still be perfectly viable for a2g combat but in form of quick strafing runs or dive bombing rather than just slowly hovering around and firing rockets at infantry . 
  well the laat is apparently [ based on the mi-24 hind ] ( http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/low_altitude_assault_transport#behind_the_scenes ) and so is my idea ( to some extent ) so yes . 
  looks like someone had been playing company of heroes 2 just before that . 
  to some extent , yes . 
  imo , the best solution would be to change the speed and maneuverability on the flash and/or the harasser so that the flash has superior mobility in all ways . 
   to my knowledge there is no way to keybind switching autofire on and off, 
  pressing the keybind for the attack you have on autofire ( usually 1 ) will make you stop firing . 
  this is imo the best idea so far . 
  sometimes i wish spawnrooms had painfields that affected friendlies . 
  it could have a delay or something so people have time to use the consoles and stuff but after that , out you go . 
  it could be activated when the enemy has a majority of the control points so that it only forces people out when they 're losing the battle . 
  the sniper is far from worthless imo , he just need some protection . 
  i once managed to hold of several soviet attacks simply because i had a sniper in a building and a few squads preventing the russians from ever reaching him . 
  he got vet 3 about mid-game and last time i checked his kills he had about 60 so i would guess he killed abouy 70-80 enemies in total . 
  suddenly every single vs weapon has a charge mechanism , except maybe snipers and shotguns .
