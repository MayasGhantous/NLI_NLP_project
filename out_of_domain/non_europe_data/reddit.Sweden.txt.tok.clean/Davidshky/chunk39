  some people have pvpd in the alliance tournament price ships so ofc there 's gon na be a ton of people pvping in this beast , especially those with alts . 
  try to bring more hp/shield heals with you , both for your boffs and yourself . 
  i 'm a science officer myself and by simply spamming all the heal abilities from the medic kit i can survive almost anything . 
  planetside 2 's learning curve is flat as hell . 
  if you 've played almost any multiplayer fps before it 's not hard at all to learn how to play planetside 2 . 
  a bi old but [ here 's ] ( http://zkillboard.com/detail/-468053/ ) one of my ccp kills . 
  killwhored myself onto some other kms but got both top damage and last hit on ccp guard . 
  now there will be a use for all those midslots the scanning covops frigates have . 
  [ never forget !, 
  i posted [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/planetside/comments/1dcnud/idea_phantasm_gunship/ ) idea a week ago . 
  it 's basically an aircraft that could fit the roles of both your light air transport and heavy attack fighter . 
  like a ps2 version of the [ mi-24 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mil_mi-24 ) mixed with some phantasm and ps1 reaver . 
   lodestar harness :, 
  i think mbts should be excluded from being carried as well . 
  they 're pretty big and ( most likely ) heavy and are n't really supposed to have the mobility a galaxy would give them . 
  would also work as an indirect lightning buff by enabling them to reach places mbts ca n't . 
  i use my [ other character ] ( https://gate.eveonline.com/profile/max%20von%20sydow ) to post on the forums . 
  people seem to like him more than my main . 
  edit : remembered that one of my friends found another use for this . 
  one of his alts on another accout had finished training every production/construction related skill ( except some obscure ones that no one really needs anyway ) to lvl v so he moved it to his main account so he would n't have to pay/use plex for a char he was n't gon na train anymore . 
   incursion ones, 
  unless they 've changed it when i was gone , incursion sanshas have even resists so all damage types are equally good . 
  i wish this just simply was n't allowed to happen . 
  this game need some better way to balance teams because this is just bad . 
  i still think that at least for now , we should just be able to join any server we want whenever we want like normal multiplayer fpss . 
  since the servers ca n't balance by forcing people to swtich team it should simply force people to go to another continent and in cases of extreme imbalance , another server . 
  when we can lock continents and have outfit owned bases and stuff like that , then there should be limitation on changing servers , but for now , the game should like a really big battlefield and less like an mmo . 
  no , it should never force people to leave , but it should prevent more people from joining if their faction is already overpopulated . 
  i think nc and tr bolt action rifles and rocket launchers got new bolting/reload animations in gu8 or at least around the same time . 
  not as big of a change as the lasher but it 's something . 
  i 've posted an idea about adding a `` targeting '' ability to the game . 
  let 's say that squad and platoon leaders could mark a specific vehicle for the players under their command . 
  this would be done by aiming at it an holding q. 
  it would be kind of like spotting except that the target would have a special sumbol , or possibly even a box/circle around it , that designates that specific vehicle as your target and not just another spotted enemy . 
  could possibly require someone in the platoon/squad to keep the target in their line of sight , but as long as someone does that after it has initially been marked , it should stay that way . 
  it should n't really provide any other bonuses than simply being an easier way to coordinate fire/keep track of a target without having to yell at everyone like a certain semi-famous ps2 player . 
  they would only be unable to play the game if their faction has something like +35 % population on every continent on every server . 
  i highly doubt that would ever happen . 
  if this would actually happen , soe would already have a pretty big problem on their hands . 
  how would they be prevented from playing ? 
  this is pretty much the same way most multiplayer fps games work . 
  if one team has too many players , either force someone to switch team ( wo n't work in ps2 ) or simply do n't allow more people to join that team . 
  it 's pretty much the standard solution to team imbalance . 
  let 's say you have br50 tr character on server a , but when you want to play , the game tells you that tr in server a is full , so you check the server list , see that server e is fairly balanced and join that server for a while , with the same br50 character , all your certs , all your gear same friendlist and everything you had on server a and continue playing . 
  i guess that to make sure that everyone would be allowed to play even un the extremely unlikely event that one faction would be overpopulated everywhere at the same time , the game would let you join the server in your region where your faction is the least overpopulated to even out the overpopulation . 
  pretty much every name of every famous person or character has been taken by filthy little trial accounts that never even left the starting corp. 
  imo , if you have n't subscribed within , let 's say 3 months , after the trial ended , the account should be deleted and the character names put back into circulation . 
  but if you have subscribed , even if only for a month , even if it was with a plex , your name is safe forever . 
  we 'll if it was just a trial account they would n't lose much progress . 
  i guess there could be two timelimits , one for the name and one for the entire account . 
  after the first is reached , the characters go into limbo , are more or less removed from the game and their names become available . 
  after the second limit is reached , their account is simply deleted and the account name and stuff like that will be available as well . 
   i 'm displeased with how `` helicoptery '' the esfs feel . 
  that 's how i feel as well . 
  i wish esfs were faster but more fragile so that they were better at dogfighting and strafing runs but a lot more vulnerable to ... anything when just slowly hovering . 
  i also think that the rocketpods should be rebalanced into an all-purpose weapon and that bombs , similar to the ones op wants , would take over the a2g role . 
  this reminds me of the [ stockholm public library rotunda ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c2/stadsbiblioteket_2008e.jpg ) and while it 's not as old or as impressive , it 's pretty cool for a normal library . 
  higby kinda says [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/planetside/comments/1apgor/account_wide_unlock_faq/c8zn0f7 ) that we 'll probably get the other factions equivalent of stuff we have bought , but it will take a while . 
  it 's not guaranteed this will happen but i really hope it does . 
   sisilauncher is no longer supported and is being replaced by the new eve launcher . 
  i wish gallente navy ships looked like the [ federation navy npcs ] ( http://games.chruker.dk/eve_online/graphics/ids/1024/2138.jpg ), 
  from what i 've read , the us army only started using these 2012 or something . 
  there 's also the factor that the cg can fire many different types of ammunition . 
  from wikipedia, 
   the m3 maaws fires the following ammunition :, 
   * high explosive dual purpose ( hedp ) round, 
   * high explosive anti-tank ( heat ) round, 
   * high explosive ( he ) round, 
   * illumination round, 
   * smoke round, 
   * area defence munition ( adm ) flechette round, 
   military cap, 
  something like [ this ] ( http://www.simons.ca/_static/webupload/731/29_9415-121432_35_6.jpg ) but blue and with the nc logo ? 
  capsuleer ships are also crewed by humans , it 's just the bridge that has been more or less replaced by the capsuleer . 
  i wish the magburner could be used in any direction . 
  wasd and space decides which direction you go , upwards ? 
  backwards ? 
  both at the same time ? 
  all should be possible . 
  edit : i would also like this for the scythe as well if they ever add special abilites to the esfs . 
  yeah , did n't think about what this could mean for engineers . 
  one magrider decided to burn backwards and causes a chain reaction of magriders bumping into each other , killing every single engineer in the area . 
  i still think something like this should be resticted to squad and platoon leaders , and that infiltrators should get something else . 
  they should add some sort of free officer hat/helmet/headwear that all squad and platoon leaders get ( like a normal commissar hat , without the gold , goggles etc ) , and then sell things like this as `` officer bling bling upgrade '' packs . 
  i think shuttles and rookie ships do n't need a crew when used by a capsuleer but all the other ships do , or at least they should . 
  [ here ] ( http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/new_eden_crew_guidelines ) is the list of crew numbers for ship classes . 
  as someone who have never fwd and have been gone for over a year , could someone explain this picture for me ? 
  the evelopedia article i linked says otherwise . 
  charge mechanism barrel attachment for carbines , assault rifles and some other weapon . 
  would give the weapon a charge mechainc when using semi-auto . 
  that way whoever it is on soe that really really likes charge weapons will be happy and we can get something else for our `` special '' weapons . 
  that 's what i 've been saying !, 
  give nc something esle for their max ability and give all faction access to max shields as weapons . 
  pretty much just a mana-turret shield strapped to the left arm . 
  max melee weapons are apparently already coming ( someone found the models in a previous update ) and we need shields to complete the set . 
  then add swords as sidearms for normal infantry , bayonets as rail attachments and we 're good to go . 
  all aboard the planetside 40k train !, 
  choo chooo . 
  [ and no , i am not being sarcastic .
