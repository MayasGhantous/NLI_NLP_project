  well it would only be for a short time , and the bonus would n't that big , just enough so that people will bother using their warcry . 
  i think [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_3vzdb7pj4 ) would be more accurate . 
  [ the final form ] ( http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20090604205310/half-life/en/images/c/c9/advisor_ep2_model.jpg ), 
  personally , i hate attribute implants and would like to see them removed . 
  but that 's not gon na happen . 
  so i 'm gon na suggest this instead . 
  attribute boosters . 
  works the same was as attribute implants but for a limited time . 
  would not stack with implants . 
  you would instead recieve the higher bonus , so if you have a +4 implant and use a +5 booster you would get the +5 effect . 
  would serve as an alternative to implants for those living a more risky life or just want to do some casual pvp for a few days . 
  would create a new medical industry . 
  infiltrators should have some sort of instant smoke dispenser as a grenade . 
  like the ninja smoke bombs in popular fiction . 
  would be kinda like a smoke grenade , but rather than being something you throw , it would detonate instantly as you press g. like an infantry version of the vehicles ir smoke . 
  i 'm gon na say this again . 
  we should be able to switch server whenever we want and still use the same character , at least until we have continent locking , outfit owned bases and stuff like that . 
  then soe could implement some normal team balancing stuff like almost every other multiplayer fps has . 
  it would help balancing the teams on continents/servers and allow us to group together on the same servers during the off hours rather than being spread out . 
  something like this . 
  * you start the game . 
  * select your faction x br y character, 
  * select server . 
  * select continent . 
  * if the continent is too overpopulated by your faction , chose another continent . 
  * if all continents are too overpopulated by your faction , chose another server . 
  * in the unlikely event that your faction is overpopulated on every continent on every server , the game will be nice and let you join anyway but should also remind you that you 're part of the problem and that you 'll get extra xp playing as the underdog . 
  * play, 
  soe giving us account wide unlocks of each empires equivalent of a weapon we have bought would also help since we could then join an underpopulated faction without losing more than our certs . 
  i think that at least for now , we should be able to change server with our character whenever we want and that soe should implement faction balancing stuff to prevent extreme population imbalance . 
  sweden because i 'm swedish and ca n't stand that horrible fucking voice acting . 
  sometimes i declare war on sweden just to make the fucker shutup for a while . 
  the race of your character is almost completely irrelevant . 
  it might save you an hour ( ? ), 
  or skilltraining if you 're gon na fly the ships of the same race as your character but other than that , it just determines how your character looks and what rookieship you 'll recieve . 
  well recent events are suggesting that this could change . 
  i just put mine on the market for the minimum amount to get rid of them . 
  no , more like an instant smoke grenade you use in combination with the cloak . 
  like if you get ambushed at close range , you deploy smoke , cloak , and run like a bitch . 
  no , it would replace the grenade . 
  i thought the starting skills was something like racial frig 1 and racial weapon 1 and most of the other skills were universal support skills . 
  edit : racial frigate 2 and racial small weapons 3 , the rest of the skills are universal . 
  reminds me of when i was traveling through lowsec/0 .0 in a travel fitted punisher ( cloak , ab ,2 x wcs , 2x nanos ) and ran into a gatecamp . 
  started warping around between planets and moons like a madman while being hunted by an interceptor , and during this chase my wallet blinked . 
  when i eventually had time to check , someone had given me 2 mil with the message `` for your ship loss '' . 
  nicest gatecampers i 've met so far , though not very good since i left the system without them even scratching my armor . 
  how about something like [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/planetside/comments/1dcnud/idea_phantasm_gunship/ ) ? 
  i made a suggestion about a `` mobile support platform '' type vehicle . 
  like a modified sunderer with the rear section replaced by a flat platform where different types of equipment can be mounted , including artillery . 
  about the same speed and mobility as a sunderer , but less health and only 1 gun . 
  would have to deploy to use the main gun/support equipment . 
  it could have access to stuff like howitzers , rockets , long range radar , aircraft landing pad etc etc. 
  generally stuff that you 'd want to use some distance from the actual fighting . 
  also , to makre sure that they ca n't just be hidden away somewhere , extended use of these would result in their position being revealed on the map to the enemy . 
  let 's say after too many shells/rockets having been fired ( in total , not just per vehicle ) or having the radar active for too long in a hex , a symbol would appear on the map . 
  that way you would either need to stay mobile or have someone defending these vehicles . 
  i posted that idea months ago so no worries . 
  my suggestion is that we should have free sl/pl hats ( like a normal commissar hat ) and then soe could sell something like a `` sl/pl hat bling bling upgrade pack '', 
   some way of prolonged siege like in ps1 with ntus, 
  how about this . 
  each base is supplied with power/nanites through the lattice network . 
  if a base is completely cut off from its warpgate , a timer will start counting down . 
  when it reaches 0 , the base will become neutral . 
  larger bases = longer timer . 
  when a base is cut off , a convoy of ai ants will spawn from the center of the warpgate and start driving towards that base . 
  each ant that reaches the base will add x minutes to the timer . 
  if a convoy is destroyed or at least have taken heavy casualties , a new one will spawn . 
  this will keep going until the base is lost or reconnected to the lattice network . 
  well i just thought that driving them could be extremely boring . 
  i also wanted them to follow designated routes so that both sides know where to go to destroy/defend them . 
  what if only maxs could do it ? 
  `` i like the gnosis because i can highlight my entire hangar of modules , click ` fit ' , and the ship is good to go for combat . '', 
  you think beverly crusher is cool ? 
  they should change the lightning so it 's more like its [ ps1 ancestor ] ( http://www.planetside-universe.com/media/main/wallpapers/wall_official/official_wall_lightning_1600x1200.jpg ) but with a turret . 
  jumped into a liberator . 
  everything was really fucking dark . 
  got 17 kills by shooting at tiny things that moved in the shadows . 
  good times were had by all . 
  source ? 
  is this some fan photoshop or are ccp [ teasing pretty ship skins ] ( http://imgur.com/a/hxmqv ) again ? 
  edit : did n't look at the logo closely enough . 
  you can put bounties on yourself without an alt . 
  could n't there be some sort of true way/kdf alliance ? 
  what i want is for ship skins to be lp store items . 
  each faction selling their own colors , ie , red + grey for roden , digital camo for caldari navy etc etc. 
  would come in 3-4 sizes , small , medium , large and possibly x-large . 
  should work on any ship of any race , so a dominix with the imperial navy colors or a rifter with the lai dai brown + orange would be possible . 
  this could create a new isk sink and we would finally have some sort of ship appearance customization . 
   i think simply having alternate paint job versions of the ships for sale for more expensive costs would be the best way to do it . 
  that way if the ship gets blown up , you 'd have to rebuy the whole thing for lp . 
  then not as many people would use their pretty ships for dangerous stuff , reducing the amount of ships being blown up and thus reducing the demand . 
  it would also mean that the lp stores would either have to be bloated with a fuckton of ships or the amount of ships avaliable with the special skins would be extremely limited ( like only navy ships ) . 
  i 'm not really sure it would be that difficult . 
  could n't they do something similar as they did with the turrets ? 
  the question is , when ? 
  it 's not supposed to be good in a2a combat . 
  i think you 're just too used to the airhammer . 
   double airhammers, 
  nope, 
  nope nope nope,
