  for example , vs cultust/templar/zealot pack . 
  a mix between a monk/cleric and [ this ] ( http://www.thehealthygamer.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/templar_knight_in_battle_dress_by_angelfire7508.jpg ) , but modern and vanu . 
  helmet could be a hood or a helmet similar to the templar in the picture . 
  the armor would be a surcoat with the vs colors and the vs logo and the voice pack would be like a mix between calm/wise and religious fanatic , think wh40k space marines . 
  they would also use the word `` vanu '' 150 % more than other vs soldiers . 
  other vs themes could be something like cyborg/transhuman ( not sure if still human ) and scholar/scientists ( hightech soldier + field researcher ), 
  nc could have `` grumpy old veterans '' ( older equipment and faces ) , mercenaries ( more casual equipment , like baseball caps ) and anarchists ( [ these guys , but blue ] ( http://deathandtaxesmag.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/anarchists-black-bloc.jpeg ) ) as theme packs . 
  tr could have veteran ( like a propaganda poster veteran ) , political soldiers ( waffen ss minus nazism ) and conscripts ( no beard/stubble , would get ncs current voices ) as theme packs . 
  why not introduce some sort of special `` sub-class '' airframes for that ( or something for a new slot like aznox suggested ) . 
  single level airframes that give significant bonuses in some areas but harch penalties in other , like more speed in exchange for less health . 
  should be a new pirate faction . 
  could be caldari + amarr since they like shields , railguns , missiles and amarr hulls . 
  no , i 'm 99 % sure they use hybrids . 
  i think there are some strange mercenaries that like to do shit like that and that they can appear in several missions . 
  also , the railguns look kinda like lasers . 
  i like how the nimbus desert is just full of quantum mortars . 
  any larger fight will just be full of blue circles as +10 mortars continue to bombard the enemies . 
  ] ( http://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/k%c3%a4rn%c3%a4mne ), 
  strange . 
  [ this is how it looks for me . 
  because otherwise bots will steal the keys 0.000000001 seconds after him posting that . 
  i think we need a bit more modern defenses , like trenches , bunkers and pillboxes . 
  weak force fields ( like 50 % damage reduction ) in the embrasures to give some protections and possibly hackable and destroyable force fields as doors . 
  for example , imagine a large pillbox ( think omaha beach ) built into the cliffside above the stronghold . 
  or a bunch of smaller pillboxes and trenches scattered outisde the bases creating some sort of loose defensive line before the walls and buildings and phalanx guns . 
  that 's why i suggested force fields in the embrasures . 
  with a 50 % damage reduction you could survive a headshot from a bolt action sniper . 
   maybe make it less efficient vs air and a bit more vs ground, 
  i think they should do the opposite and turn the pods into an all-round secondary weapon for esfs and give them bombs as their a2g secondary . 
  that way we would have an a2a , an a2g and an all-round secondary weapon , just like the main guns . 
  this reminds me , i still want [ empire specific drop pods ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/planetside/comments/1c75ku/suggestion_faction_specific_drop_pods/ ) . 
  the current ones look very nc ( like most ns stuff ) and es pods would help to identify the faction dropping in , especially when its dark . 
  tr should get something more round and sleek , like a torpedo with a human payload . 
  vs should get a pod that 's pretty much just a disc that projects a force field around the passenger . 
  kinda like [ this ] ( http://imgur.com/a/pioil ) ( i only have ms paint ) . 
  also , yay , the pods open !, 
  yes !, 
  i agree about everything but the ohk ( ohk backstabs woukd be ok ) . 
  i hate how the current knives look , especially the `` chain blade '' that does n't even have a chain . 
  and while on the topic of melee , we also need swords as secondary weapons ( not ohk but longer range and can hit several enemies in an arc ) and bayonets ( replaces the quick knifing with a bayonet stab with longer range ) as weapon attachments . 
  both the swords and bayonets should look similar to the normal ( ps1 ) knives , except the swords would obviously be bigger and longer , possibly the bayonets as well . 
  beatrice ask, 
  my suggestion is that the rockets should be turned into an all-round secondary weapon for the esfs , reducing its effectiveness vs ground but making it better vs air . 
  then the bombs would take over the a2g role . 
  i would like this , but only as long as it can not carry sunderers or mbts . 
  i just think that low mobility should be one of the ( if not the main ) penalties of mbts . 
  allowing them to be carried by gals would mean that mbts could go anywhere , including places that the maps are designed to prevent them from reaching . 
  also , if mbts could n't be carried , it would create a new niche for the lightnings . 
  well it 's not like the pimps hoard all their money in some sort of scrooge mcduck money bin . 
  [ really ? 
  how did you think we magically replaced dead crew in the middle of combat ? 
  starfleet has been replicating people since enterprise since that 's pretty much how transporters work . 
  [ yup ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_aircraft_carriers_by_country#numbers_of_aircraft_carriers_by_country ), 
  while the nerada is a mining vessel , it was apparetly upgraded with borg tech ( as an experiment or something ) by the tal shiar after the destruction of romulus . 
  from memory beta, 
   the vault 's commander , d'spal , sensed nero 's hunger for vengeance and offered to fit the narada with the vault 's prototype hybrid romulan-borg technology . 
  the system gave the narada enhanced cloaking and sensor capabilities , and a self-repairing nanotechnology that could anticipate threats and adapt , growing the ship to face the challenge . 
  looks like they refitted it into a combat ship with borg technology . 
  i guess that most of the original ships systems would be replaced anyway so if it was a d'diredex , a tos warbird or a civilian mining ship would be irrelevant . 
  lower tier z-store ships are pretty much nothing more but special consoles or weapons with pretty packaging . 
  for example , the kdf vandal destroyer comes with the plasmonic leech console which is awesome as fuck , but the ship itself is pretty irrelevant . 
  i think [ this ] ( http://xkcd.com/659/ ) is relevant . 
  also , i diagree . 
  first of all , [ replicators are transporters ] ( http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/replicator ) . 
  the difference is that they use matter to create something else . 
  transporters on the other hand scan will scan an object , break it down into subatomic particles , transport these particles somewhere else and use them to reassemble the object . 
  this is kinda as if i killed you , chopped you up into tiny pieces , sent the pieces + an ikea manual to your destination and had you reassembled and revived by a bunch of very skilled surgeons . 
  then there 's also stuff like the two rikers . 
  either one of them was made up of other particles , or they were both reassembled with a mix of original riker particles and new particles . 
  that is ofc unless the riker particles were magically duplicated mid transport . 
  imo , the whole `` it 's the same thing since it uses the original particles '' is just a convenient lie everyone choose to believe in because without transporters you would have to use shuttles everywhere and that would just suck . 
  do n't forget that when low on fuel the ai will fall back to `` if current resources  resources needed to build mortar or mg team , build mortar or mg team . '', 
  * got a roadkill with my scythe when doing a strafing run against a lightning . 
  i flew really low and kinda hit the ground a few meters from the tank and killed the engineer repairing it . 
  * once miraculously survived a fall after getting blown out of the sky by a burster max and landed just a few meters away from the very same burster max , and before everyone brutally murdered me i managed to empty a battery into the max and throw a grenade , killing it as i stared at my death screen . 
  * was bored and decided to try ramming some aircrafts with a galaxy . 
  ended up in a `` dogfight '' with a mossy over the j908 impact site . 
  after failing to kill it , my health eventually went into the red . 
  i then noticed that the mossy was right below me , so i bailed out of the galaxy , making it fall to the ground as a rock , crushing the mossy on the way . 
  i think he meant [ the refit ] ( http://sto.gamepedia.com/escort_refit ) ship and not the retrofit . 
  [ the raven ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eraemvpuwpi ), 
  the sound !, 
  there is no escape from the sound !, 
  [ only the dead can know peace from this evil !, 
  ] ( http://i1.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/009/968/only%20the%20dead%20can%20know%20peace%20from%20this%20evil.jpg ), 
  i 'm pretty sure [ this ] ( http://sto.gamepedia.com/crew ) is what they mean with `` crew '' and i think that `` stealing crew '' is just a fancier way of saying '' - x crew on enemy ship '' unless maybe it leeches crew over to your ship . 
  will the romulans ever get their own fleet elite weapons or would it be too similar to the romulan rep stuff ? 
  will there be repeater pistols , piercing rifles etc etc with other damage types anytime soon ? 
  and will they be avaliable as fleet versions ? 
  why do n't romulan engineers make plasma turrets instead of phaser/disruptor turrets ? 
  any plans on a k'tanco retrofit ? 
  they 've played it a few times before in the show . 
  it 's often played in the background during lannister scenes , as it is their themesong . 
  tyrin whistles it a few times in season 2 . 
  bronn and some soldiers sings it before the battle of blackwater . 
  it 's played in the credits after the battle of blackwater ( and some other episode iirc ) . 
  the brotherhood without banners sings it at some point . 
  then cersei explains exactly what the songs means to margaery . 
  why do n't you just shave your head ? 
  that 's what most of us future baldies will do .
