  my kdf main flies a vo'quv with 2x b'rotlh birds-of-prey and i really enjoy them ... when they work . 
  the biggest problem with carriers is that the ships you launch are completely and utterly retarded , but when for example by bops do what they 're supposed to do , they are extremely powerful . 
  sometimes they will just fly around in circles and shoot with their single turret doing crap dps , but once in a while they will do a proper attack run with high yeild torpedos and cannon rapid fire . 
  other ships are more reliable , like the orion slavers . 
  they use beam arrays and mines so they can just orbit the target and continue doing decent damage . 
  i think that so far they 've talked about making 3-4 types of industrials , so at least one iteron would probably be removed . 
  i think the roles they talked about were , tank , speed/agility , cargo space and possibly a ship transport ( not sure about that one ) . 
  [ found it ] ( https://forums.eveonline.com/default.aspx?g=posts&amp;m=3015066#post3015066 ), 
  ofc , it 's not official or anything but it 's the best info we got so far . 
  also , i think i remembered the ship-hauler from some other thread ( or the umpteen hundred of them ) and not something ccp said so ignore it . 
  indeed . 
  lock-on is just a boring game mechanic . 
  i 've been using the vs lock-on launchers a lot since they became cheap and one thing that really bothered me is that the aa missile is pretty much undodgable . 
  ofc i already kinda knew it from flying esfs myself but after standing on the ground and watching mossies and reavers do absurd evasive maneuvers that should have turned the pilot into a puddle of goo in the cockpit , and still get hit by my missile i realized just how stupid the damn thing was . 
  imo missiles should turn a lot slower ( and maybe fly a bit slower as well ) so that an esf can dodge them as long as it does some evasive manuvers like a loop or a couple of hard turn , or the classic of flying towards the ground and pulling up in the last second . 
  av lock-ons are also pretty annoying but the main issue with those is more about tanks vs infantry balance and range . 
  since has can just hide behind stuff , be revived , spawn endlessly etc etc they 're really hard to get rid of . 
  they also lack a real counter . 
  they can either use the annihilators/strikers to enable them to counter air and tanks at the same time , or they could just get aa launchers if needed . 
  and if they get attacked by infantry they are very capable of defending themselves against those as well since after all , they have lmgs , shield abilites and more shield hp than anyone else . 
  sometimes i wish has would have to choose between having a main weapon and a launcher since then they would have a real weakness that can be exploited . 
  maybe there could be `` light '' and `` heavy '' launchers so that has can choose between having a weak launcher and having a good launcher but no main weapon . 
  i 'm pretty sure norway and denmark would n't have entered any war either if they had n't been invaded . 
  both of them were declared as neutral countries and would most likely had stayed that way if they had been able to . 
  also , had [ plan r 4 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/plan_r_4 ) been carried out norway and sweden might have become axis powers . 
  imo , any country that did n't enter the way by themselves should be concidered neutral since they did n't really choose a side but rather had it chosen for them . 
  oh god , ca n't unsee it . 
  now i 'll never be able to rewatch tng and ds9 , thanks a lot . 
   oh right , of course . 
  i fit ** warp stabs ** did n't i. 
  please link your fit so we can laugh at it and then give you some advice . 
  would n't surprise me if they made ricochet 2 and released it at the same time as hl3 , kinda like the orange box . 
  should n't take many man-hours to do . 
  and just to fuck with people they announce ricochet 2 before hl3 . 
  russian scout car . 
  put something fun in it and go kill some facists . 
  extremely fun to use early game but still useful later on , especially to capture vps . 
  with engineers or penal squad with flamethrower it becomes an improvised flame tank . 
  extremely powerful vs mortars and mg teams . 
  with guard rifles ( especially with mg upgrade ) you get a mobile early game anti-everything machine . 
  with scout snipers it can be used to harrass the enemy from afar or provide fire support for your allies wherever it 's needed . 
  it 's also very useful to defende against enemies trying to sneak around and capture undefended points . 
  load it up with an assault squad with ppshs and charge the enemy . 
  fairly suicidal but it can allow your as to get in murdering range much faster and take less damage when doing so than if they had gone on foot . 
  an engineer in a scout car can be extremely useful when using t-34s since it allows the engineer squad to keep up with the fast tanks . 
  also , with the doctrinal ability to repair itself when out of combat combined with the overdrive veteran ability it can be very hard to kill . 
  just do n't expect them to be very useful when the germans start spamming tanks or pz grens . 
   ** the majority of the players ** want it . 
  nope . 
  i 'm pretty sure even the players who have never even tried flying in ps2 can agree that aa is too powerful . 
  heck , it was n't until i bought the aa launcher after the price drop that i truly appreciated how broken it was . 
  i 've seen my victims do maneuvers that should turn the pilot into a puddle of goo from the g-force except my missile does n't give a fuck and will just turn and hit anyway . 
  i personally think that aa weapons ( and to some extent at weapons ) were `` balanced '' when almost no one had them . 
  imo they were never underpowered , it was just that when every single br1 player could spawn an esf we ended with with situations like [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mtlllcq0au ) . 
  then people cried and cried and aa ( and at ) was buffed and buffed and buffed and more and more people bought them , and here we are . 
  i had a 3v3 game where one of my allies got a vet 3 flammetrack , poor fuckers never had a chance . 
   f you cant afford to specialize , then you cant afford t3s to begin with . 
  now that you mention it . 
  op , how much isk do you have ? 
  it just feels kinda odd that you can afford to just buy a tengu like that and not know how to use it . 
  cause if you really can afford it ( and to lose it ) , then carry on , learn by your mistakes and stuff , but if you ca n't , you ought to buy something else . 
  give it to your alt and gank it with your main so you 'll be know as the guy who killed it rather than the guy who lost it . 
  what if we had to commit ourselves to a class when we choose it , for like an hour or something ( even 15 minutes should be enough ) . 
  could work as a compromise between switching class whenever the fuck you want and ps1s system of forgetting certs every 6 hours . 
  that way people would n't be able to just change class to whatever is best for the moment but would instead have to plan ahead . 
  like if your group encounter some tanks and you do n't have enough has , too bad , you should have thought of that earlier . 
  probably not the best idea ( but at least it 's an idea ) and i have no idea how to apply this to vehicles or max armor , but it would at least be intresting to try it on the test server . 
  one advantage for fed rommies is that you can get the plasmonic leech console for ec . 
  in ps1 you could forget certs every 6 hours so you could spend the points on something else . 
  this meant that your choices were n't permanent but if you for example spent all your point to make something like a ha , you were stuck that way for 6 hours . 
  that way players could n't just instantly adapt to counter the current threat ( unless they had a lot of points to spread around ) and had to plan ahead , at least a little bit . 
  currently in ps2 , you can just become whatever you need to be for the moment . 
  if i 'm killed by a liberator i can just respawn as a ha with an aa launcher , shoot it down or at least force it to retreat and then switch back to the class i was before . 
  lots of friendly armor around ? 
  switch to engineer . 
  long range combat ? 
  be an infiltrator . 
  biolab fight ? 
  max time !, 
   ostwind and the brumbarr occupy virtually identical roles, 
  i 've never seen a brummb\u00e4r shoot down my il-2 ( though if it happened i would n't even be mad ) and personally i think the ostwind is better as a defensive unit and the brummb\u00e4r as an offensive unit . 
  i still think something like that would be better than the current situation , at least for vehicles vs infantry balance . 
  currently , we have situations like this . 
  bob the medic , frank the engineer , lisa the infiltrator and kenny the la are running around fightiting and having fun . 
  suddenly a liberator/esf/mbt appears and blow them up . 
  10 seconds later we have bob the ha , frank the ha , lisa the ha and possibly kenny the dual burster max emerging from the nearby spawnroom/ams sunderer . 
  the liberator/esf/mbt is then blown the fuck up . 
  bob , frank , lisa and kenny can then switch back to the classes they were before and carry on doing what they like to do . 
  well since i tend to play as the soviets most of the time i would say very rarely . 
  but i have lost units to il-2 strafing runs when playing as the germans and i 've had my il-2 shot down when playing as the soviets so the ostwinds aa capabilities should n't be completely ignored . 
  as long as all the bulletins are somewhat balanced i do n't have any problem with this system . 
  you can only use 3 at a time so unlocking more will only give you more options . 
  i think flares should just come by default . 
  the cert should then just be a cooldown time reduction bonus . 
   not to mention that i 'm sick to death of the whole usa-focus . 
  oh god yes !, 
  since pretty much all modern shooters are about fictional wars anyway there 's no reason they ca n't be a bit [ creative and make shit up . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/games/comments/1erm3f/have_we_reached_the_wwii_oversaturation_time_with/ca324f6?context=3 ), 
  and while i do understand that a large portion ( or even majority ) of their buyers are americans they could at least do it like the old call of duty games and have several campaigns . 
  a new enemy would also be intresting .
