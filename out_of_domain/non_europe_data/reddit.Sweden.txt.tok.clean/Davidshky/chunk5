  l4d style missions would be great . 
  rather than just running around in circles in a small area you would be moving towards a certain objective in a more linear map . 
  possibly some sort of take and hold objective where you capture points as you progress along the map and at each point you have to defeat some entrenched defenders and then defend against a counter attack before then moving on to the next point . 
  each point will be harder than the one before and the money you get depends on how far you got before failing . 
  [ combine ? 
  ] ( http://davidinorlando.files.wordpress.com/2009/11/combine.jpg ), 
  i had some great success using a 6/6/6 / 5/3 human engineer against reapers during the banshee event . 
  combat drone, 
  * shields & damage, 
  * shock, 
  * chain lightning . 
  * recharge speed, 
  * shield damage, 
  incinierate, 
  * burning damage, 
  * armor damage, 
  drone was used as a distraction for banshees and brutes but also to deal with swarmers since i find myself being killed or at least taking heavy damage from these more often than i 'd like . 
  overload was used both for crowd control but also to deal with the banshees barriers which is why i chose shield damage rather than chain in the last evolution . 
  incinerate is pretty straight forward , spam it at anything with armor until they fall over and die . 
  i prefer the geth engineer for fighting geth and cerberus but the human is one of my favorite classes for fighting reapers . 
  in my victory pack i got the n7 valiant and my 7th ex-cerberus vanguard which means that i now have all the weapons and still do n't have a vorcha . 
  in my victory pack i got the n7 valiant and my 7th cerberus vanguard which means that i now have all the weapons and still do n't have a vorcha . 
  the damage reduction is only when shooting through objects . 
  and the armor piercing buff is that you will suffer less from the damage penalty of armor . 
  on gold armor reduces damage by 50 for each bullet making smgs , shotguns and assault rifles pretty bad at dealing with armor . 
  piercing mod v reduces that penalty by 65 % meaning that you only lose 17,5 damage per bullet instead of 50 . 
  your typo got me thinking and i have come to the conclusion that a weaponized combine would be a terrifying weapon against smaller enemies . 
  also other enemies afaik . 
  possibly friendlies as well . 
  normal weather . 
  i live in sweden and from april to august the weather goes full retard . 
  have only opened the victory pack so far but in that i got an n7 valiant and my ** 7th ** ex-cerberus vanguard . 
  this means that i now have all the weapons and still only two rebellion characters . 
  so you have scorching sun , rain and hail in the same 30 minute walk in april ? 
  i have extracted but i do n't think i 've ever gotten a full extraction on gold . 
  i once managed to extract by running around is circles while chased by all the banshees and brutes until the last 10 seconds . 
  how about adding one unique unit to each army like the spitfire prime . 
  * a harbinger controlled reaper unit for absolution legion . 
  * a squad leader centurion for hephaestus , having more health/firepower and increasing damage or accuracy of nearby units . 
  * thantos could have cloaked nemesises , being able to move while invisible but becomes visible for several seconds after firing . 
  * zeta wing could have better hunters ( hp/damage/speed ) that can also throw grenades to flush out enemies . 
  maybe some sort of limited cloak for normal troopers . 
  i hope they increase the damage and health of the turret and maybe change the armor piercing ammo evolution for disruptor ammo so the qe can do something against shielded enemies . 
  well , if it trades cluster grenades for reave it could work . 
   maybe replace ** cluster grenades ** with warp . 
  ftfy, 
  i would rather see a new prequel trilogy . 
  something similar to aaron diaz [ star wars : 1999 ] ( http://dresdencodak.tumblr.com/post/22782364818/here-are-some-common-questions-i-get-about-star ) project . 
  immortality and shapeshifting . 
  i would live forever and be able to change my appearance both for fun and to not stand out when the rest of humanity change . 
  i frigging love lash !, 
  it can usually kill troopers/cannibals in one hit and sometimes even heavier enemies like rocket troopers and centurions if you make them fly into walls and stuff . 
  its also my favorite ability vs cerberus engineers since i can easily lash them away from their turret or prevent them from putting one down in the first place . 
  n7 is 250 . 
  highest ultra rare is wraith iii . 
  highest rare is ... all of them at x , except the rebellion guns . 
  i would n't say it sucks , just that its worse than the vanguard . 
  lash and smash are really powerful so if you ignore singularity completely you should have a decent long/medium range character . 
  tech armor , barrier , fortification , hunter mode , cluster grenades . 
  then i 'd put it on a drell or a vorcha for increased mobility . 
  immortal , speedy , shooty murder machine . 
  i would get over 100 % damage resistance just from tech armor , fortification and barrier . 
  why would i need reave and defense matrix ? 
  got another one . 
  hunter mode , cloak , marksman , tactical scan , adrenaline rush and the magical ability to use adrenaline rush and marksman at the same time . 
  put on a turian for the stability bonus . 
  [ pew pew pew ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qd0pporwbog&amp;feature=related ), 
  * geth turret, 
  * geth turret, 
  * geth turret, 
  * geth turret, 
  * bloodlust, 
  on a krogan or batarian for health and heavy melee . 
  launch all turrets where you want to be , absorb bullets like a man . 
  another one would be, 
  * tech armor, 
  * biotic sphere, 
  * energy drain, 
  * geth turret, 
  on a batarian . 
  place bubble and turret at a chokepoint .

  dear everyone, 
  please stop killstealing !, 
  also , is it just me or is the vorcha dodge broken ? 
  no matter how much i dodge around an atlas will still hit me with every shot and i 'm fairly certain i dont have the same problem with any other class . 
  well for vorchas and to some extent krogans killstealing is a big deal . 
  a raging krogan is much more durable than one who is n't and vorchas need to get kills to survive at all . 
  the base hp regen of bloodlust is crappy but with 2-3 stacks you 're almost unkillable . 
  who said i does n't stay in the hack circle ? 
  i 'm talking about the umteenmillion times i 've died because i havent been able to get bloodlust going because some infiltrator insists on killing the trooper i 'm 1 nanosecond from killing . 
  you really would n't want to play with me . 
  i have somehow managed to lash primes and atlases towards me . 
  i know i should n't be able to but that didnt stop them from flying towards me . 
  if we could do it on purpouse it would be aweomse . 
  but doing it accidentally once in a while ? 
  it 's even more important than that since before you get that first kill you regen maybe 1/4 healthbar per second . 
  defense matrix, 
  heat blast : a short range cone of energy that does increased damage to armor and shields . 
  biotic missile : a missile with a biotic warhead based on warp ammo and cluster grenades .
