  * hmg dshk38 squad ( 360 manpower .50 cal mg ), 
  the last 2 are n't avaliable atm but both of them are in [ this ] ( http://coh-moderncombat.com/coh2stats/infantry.html ) list so i suspect they 'll be avaliable as doctrinal units . 
  let 's call it the `` early game dominance '' commander . 
  i use the boosters , nanite autorepair and saron hrb so i 'm pretty much always at range , can get away really fast and do n't have to stop for repairs unless i 'm on fire . 
  so good luck getting in c4 range . 
  yeah , but it 's much cheaper than the is-2 . 
  the feds should have counter piracy assignments where you keep the stuff you confiscate . 
  pretty much the same as marauding except with different names and descriptions for the assignments, 
  i kinda agree , but pretty much everything else is identical for both factions , except diplomacy vs marauding ( latter being awesome and prints money while the former is ... meh ) so as a start i think diplomacy should get some `` anti-maurading '' stuff . 
  `` patrol trade lanes for xxxxxx '', 
  `` take out orion pirate base in x sector '', 
  `` ambush nausicaan pirate raid '', 
  `` assist x colony against raiders '', 
  idea no 2 . 
  the german spiky turtle doctrine . 
  in no particular order or cp level . 
  * hull down, 
  * entrench . 
  same as hull down but for mgs , mortars and mg teams . 
  turn your unit into a crappier version of the brits defesive buildings . 
  entrenched units will have light/medium cover from direct fire , but very high cover vs aoe damage ( like artillery near misses ) . 
  mobilizing would take longer making retreating harder . 
  * [ flak 38 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2_cm_flak_30/38/flakvierling ) 20mm aa autocannon . 
  360 manpower `` hmg '' team . 
  very effective vs light vehicles . 
  imagine the guard rifles at rifle with much higher rof + supression . 
  * sector artillery, 
  * lefh 105mm howitzer/pak 43 88mm at gun/flak 36 88mm aa gun/flak 40 128mm aa gun . 
  some type of big stationary cannon that blows shit up . 
  ask the nc . 
  you 'll find that the answer usually is `` you do n't '' . 
  i also think that esfs should get a speed increase , but with a reduction in health to compensate . 
  the idea is that they should be just as hard to kill right now when flying at their top speed ( or maybe a bit harder even ) but when for example slowly hovering and lolpodding they 'd be much easier to kill . 
  make them more like vtol fighters and less like helicopters . 
  might also require a change to lock-ons so that they 're possible to evade without flares , but that needs to happen anyway . 
  i bought it on green man gaming for about 25 % less than if i had bought it on steam ( 32 gbp vs 50 euro ) , though i had a 20 % voucher . 
  edit :, 
  idea no 3 ( i prefer separate posts so people can agree with one idea and disagree with another ), 
  heavy armor assault tactics, 
  * conscript assault package upgrade ( ppshs ), 
  * vehicle crew repair training or conscript repair kit, 
  * 203mm artillery strike . 
  i think they should save the wirbelwind in case they want to add another german faction like in of . 
  iirc , in coh1 , wermacht had the wirbelwind and pe the ostwind , giving them similar yet different anti-air/infantry tanks . 
  one faction having both would just be kinda overkill since they fill the same role . 
   i do n't see why it should be a doctrinal upgrade . 
  imo , it 's because the germans are kinda supposed to have a lack of light armor while the russians have a lack of heavy armor . 
  and both should then use doctrinal units to fill the gaps . 
  the russians do n't have any default unit equivalent to the panther and brummb\u00e4r and the germans do n't have any equivalent to the t-70 or su-76 . 
  the russians then have t-34 / 85s , kv-8s ( and hopefully other kvs ) , is-2s and isu-152s as heavier doctrinal armored units . 
  so to be fair i think the germans lighter armor should also come in doctrinal form . 
  like a bunch of skdfz 250 variants ( at , mortar , clowncar ) and maybe a panzer 3 as something between the t70 and t-34 . 
  huh , i 've pretty much stopped using those completely ( if the russians get any at it 's 120 munition down the drain ) but then ofc i 've never been much of a fan of using the `` best '' tactics since i think that 's just boring as fuck and it 's kinda predictable so most players will be prepared to counter them anyway . 
  i tend to simply use grens , mgs and paks in the early game ( also kinda predictable but it 's cheaper ) and then i can use the ammo and fuel i saved on the flammtrack to get some schrecks ( or mg42s/flamethrowers ) and to reach the next tier a bit faster . 
  i usually used mine as rear guard/counter attack units , only really getting into battle if the russians swarmed/flanked me with inf , but i still kinda prefer investing the muntion in something else . 
  mgs , mortars , upgraded grens , pz grens are all good counters to russian infantry and the 120 munition can then be used to faust some clowncars , upgrade some other units or get you both a medic and a reinforcment bunker . 
   might also require a change to lock-ons so that they 're possible to evade without flares , but that needs to happen anyway . 
  you obviously did n't read what i wrote . 
  i kinda agree with you about how the prowler wants to be a cqc tank , but i still think the anchor mode fits it . 
  trs two traits are rof and speed . 
  anchor mode lets it trade the latter in exchange for the former . 
  if they ever give us more faction specific abilities for our faction specific vehicles , the prowler should have something like a `` flanking mode '' toggle ability ( if you 've played company of heroes : of , think of the cromwell tank ) that boosts its top speed while active , but decreases the turn speed a bit and takes a few seconds to reach ( unlike the magburner that 's just an instant boost . ), 
  or it could decrease your rof while active making it the opposite of the anchor ability . 
  it would hopefully become something a [ cruiser tank ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cruiser_tank ) with that ability . 
  the vanguard could have a shield bubble ability that gives a damage reduction from smallarms fire to anyone inside , but does n't really help the vanguard itself , except maybe against 20mm mgs . 
  like an [ infantry tank ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/infantry_tank ) that can be used to provide cover for advancing troops , but would have to move at infantry speed to do so . 
  magrider could have a camofluage ability that lets it become invisible but also immobilized and unable to fire . 
  reactivating the engines and gun after decloaking would take a few seconds and possibly give a small `` minimap ping '' so that victims would have some time to react . 
  kinda like a stealthy [ tank destroyer ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tank_destroyer ) / [ assault gun ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/assault_gun ) . 
  i kinda like them , they can be useful for flanking manuevers and surprise attacks , and for putting mines in enemy territory , but sometimes i wish there was a filter in the matchmaking so i could choose if i want to play a winter map or not . 
  one tactic i 've started uusing as the russians is to abuse their cheap mines ( 30 munition , build caches and spam ) and put them around fireplaces . 
  send an engineer behind enemy lines in a blizzard and put mines at every unguarded fireplace you can find/reach . 
  also put some near the points in case you capture one with your engineers and the enemy will send some squad to take it back . 
  also put some on the roads , near corners and chokepoints . 
  first of all , which ship did you get ? 
  the battlecruiser ( the picture you posted ) is from the lobi store and is a huuuuge fat cruiser while the destroyer ( the one you get from the boxes ) is more like a ( also fucking huge ) `` sciency '' escort/raptor . 
  i have both and i really like both of them , though i prefer the battlecruiser because of aux2bat . 
  one thing i really like is the lt.com science station that both of them have , but that 's just because love gravity well . 
  the way i use mine it is pretty much a [ fleet support cruiser retrofit ] ( http://sto.gamepedia.com/fleet_support_cruiser_retrofit ) with more shields , a cloak and sensor analysis . 
  the destroyer i flew more like any other escort , but with a bit more science and engineering than the average escort . 
  he only said `` later this june '' and it 's not over yet . 
  since they do n't work on saturday and sunday i guess we wo n't have to wait longer than friday . 
  the only things i usually use rifle nades for are support weapons and people in buildings . 
  the former because they ca n't really escape and they also tend to be annoying to kill with their huge squads , so a bit of aoe damage helps , but only if i feel i have anough ammo . 
  the latter is because i 'm pretty sure it has a bonus against units in buildings ( and i do n't really have flamethrowers avaliable all the time ) or i just got lucky a few time and is suffering from confirmation bias . 
  i think only the owner should get the bonus and that only one opel could be used per sector so if there are several players with that commander they could end up competing about the resource bonus . 
  maybe the owner could choose between keeping the bonus resources for himself or sharing them equally with his teammates . 
  maybe also give the russian the magical ability to know if a sector contains a truck or not ( sneaky partisans in the bushes/grass/snow ) so they have an easier time finding them . 
  i 'm not sure if that 's how the want to balance things , but that 's what i think it looks like . 
  i mean , the russians can often get t-70s and/or su-76s before the germans reach tier 3 , giving the russians cheap tanks and assault guns while the germans still only have scout cars and halftracks . 
  but eventually the germans reach tier 3 and 4 and then the russians just do n't really have anything equivalent . 
  also , if every ww2 vehicle was added to the game it would end up being a total clusterfuck , especially when it comes to balance . 
   if they wanted to give the germans light armour , there are more than a few available options . 
  indeed . 
  most likely candidated would be some of the many sdkfz [ 250 ] 8http : / / en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sd.kfz._250#variants ) and [ 251 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sd.kfz._251#variants ) variants . 
  also the sdkfz 234 ( puma ) and panzer i-iii . 
  an `` open top '' 250 would be nice as a german clowncar , i would love to put a pzgren squad with schrecks in one , or a fully upgraded gren squad with mg42 and g43s , if both would be avaliable that is . 
  a halftrack with a 75 or 37mm at gun , most likely a 250 with 37mm since that 's the one the pe had . 
  a command halftrack could be interesting . 
  a muntion halftrack that can buff units and build goliaths could be nice to have .
