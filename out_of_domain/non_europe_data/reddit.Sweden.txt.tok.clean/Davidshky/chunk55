  that 's why most people use 3 beams and 1 torp in both fore and aft . 
  edit : also , ask / r/stobuilds , i think they 're better at this, 
  since you 're too late for the pre-order bonus i think you should wait at least a week . 
  after a few patches and maybe some more info about the future ( like new commanders , and will they cost money ) we 'll be able to make a more accurate judgement . 
  well he could , but it does n't look like he 's wearing a parachute so maybe they figured it would be pointless to have a feature that would only let the pilots fall to their death , especially since you could do it by accident in the scroll menu . 
  edit : imo , they should allow pilots to eject without a parachute , but not through the scroll menu . 
  iirc , 2x v is supposed to be the eject command and i ca n't see myself using it by accident . 
  it probably would n't be veru useful but i guess you could do it if you 're not too far above the ground . 
  as someone whos kdf main flies a vo'quv , i agree , beams are superior , but i still think that in theory a turret build could be viable for carriers . 
  turrets to 25 % less dps than beam arrays , but if a target gets outside the broadside angle of a beamboat , you will only do 50 % of your beam dps . 
  so i guess a turret build would have the advantage of always doing its crappy dps regardless of where you point your ships . 
  also , since you 'll most likely want to use sci abilities as a carrier you would have to turn towards your target once in a while . 
  if nothing else i guess it could be relaxing not having to give a shit about maneuvering . 
  yeah . 
  go into the editor and mess around with date , time and weather . 
  for example , 23:55 1st january + clouds = you ca n't see shit . 
  edit : removed quote reddit added for no reason . 
  naval warfare would be pretty nice . 
  i could imagine a few ships/boats like these, 
  * ** ships **, 
  * destroyer : general combat ship , medium speed , health and firepower . 
  possibly best aa . 
  * cruiser : long range bombardment ships . 
  good at fire support and long range naval engagements . 
  low speed , high health , high firepower , lack of aa . 
  * amphibious assault carrier : the naval ams . 
  infantry spawn room and a vehicle spawner for [ deliverers ] ( http://wiki.planetsidesyndicate.com/index.php?title=deliverer ) and possibly esfs and/or some cheap landing craft . 
  medium speed and health , very little firepower , maybe just a few 20mm mgs . 
  * ** boats **, 
  * attack/patrol boat : smallish 4-5 man boats made for hit and run attacks vs ships and short range fire support for ground troops . 
  could possibly have torpedos as a weapon option . 
  * landing craft . 
  a sunderer in the water . 
  1 captain , 2 gunners , 9 passengers . 
  cheap crappy box of death to be used to recreate the omaha beach landing scene as it 's usually shown in popular culture . 
  * assault boat : 6 man boat . 
  fast , agile , loooow health , low protection for passengers . 
  1 drivers , 5 passengers . 
  cheap simple boat for transporting small groups of players . 
  not made for combat but simply to get people across water . 
  a flash in the water . 
  also , the flash should have a cert to become amphibious . 
  ships should require some sort of combined effort of a platoon or outfit to get and should cost a lot of resources ( i think auraxium should be reintroduced as a `` team '' resource for stuff like this ) . 
  boats should be like normal vehicles . 
  then there should be two new type of bases . 
  small coastal outposts , kinda like towers and outposts . 
  not really that special except they have boat spawners . 
  then there would be harbor/shipyard facilities . 
  these would be large bases like biolabs and techplants . 
  these would be the only bases capable of spawning ships and could be pretty valuable if one wants to launch a naval invasion . 
  could maybe have some special lattice system connection over the seas . 
  edit : renamed the amphibious assault ship to amphibious asssault carrier . 
  ok , i need that corvette ... crap . 
   starting june 27th and running until august 2nd . 
  during this time , players will need to participate 25 times in order to earn their free starship . 
  that would be the [ amphibious assault ship ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/amphibious_assault_ship ) . 
  those things are small carriers and troop transports . 
  unless you can somehow still get the preorder bonus and you really want that , i 'd recommend you to wait until they 've patched the game a few times and told us more about the future . 
  i want darker nights but not nvgs . 
  instead we should get more and better light sources . 
  like flares as weapon attachments , secondary weapons and consumable utlility stuff . 
  maybe give esfs and/or libs an illumination flare cert so they can drop really really big flares and turn night into day . 
  quark : i want you to try something for me . 
  listen to a bit of this . 
  garak : what is it ? 
  quark : a human song , it 's called `` where my heart will take me '' . 
  garak : nah , i do n't know . 
  quark : come on , are n't you just a little bit curious ? 
  song : i got faaaaith of the haaaaaaaaaaaaaah !!!, 
  garak : it 's vile !, 
  quark : i know . 
  it 's so bubbly and cloying and happy . 
  garak : just like the federation . 
  quark : and you know what 's really frightening ? 
  if you listen to enough of it , you begin to like it . 
  garak : it 's insidious . 
  quark : just like the federation . 
  adaptive camofluage . 
  not an invisibility cloak , but simply a camo that changes the color palette to match the surroundings better while the pattern is the same . 
  kinda like [ this ] ( http://dragonartz.files.wordpress.com/2009/04/_vector-camouflage-seamless-background-cs-by-dragonart.png ) , but with an almost infinite variety of colors . 
  or possibly it could come with a set of pre-programmed colors to choose between . 
  should at least be avaliable for vehicles but i could also imagine it as something for special forces . 
  another thing would be some sort of portable thermal camera/binocular . 
  some of the missile launchers have thermal optics ( titan for example ) so a device that just has the zoom and thermal optics without the targeting system and missile launcher parts should n't be that large . 
  a perfect tool for special forces and spotters . 
  [ electrolaser ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/electrolaser ) weapons . 
  with lethal and non-lethal firing modes . 
  can be used to mess with vehicles . 
  should work as an npc squad member with a veeeery large inventory . 
  maybe a bigger armed and armored version with a remote controlled mg or gmg on top ( like the cars we 've seen in some screenshots , but with legs ! ) . 
  just imagine having a walking portable mg/gmg that you can give simple orders too and/or control with something like a laptop . 
   at the end of february 2013 , boston dynamics released video footage of a modified bigdog with an arm . 
  ok , let 's give it two arms as well so it can use normal weapons . 
  same here . 
  just remove the guidance system and give it drop . 
  it would hopefully still be strong at medium-short range and vs stationary targets but not able to snipe moving vehicles and infantry ( i mean seriously , fuck that ) half a click away . 
  they should just remove the ability to tell how many people are in a vehicle . 
  i mean , how can we do that anyway , x-ray scanners , a 6th sense , special eyes ? 
  i still think tr should get chainswords ( like op ) . 
  it fits them a lot better than brass knuckles ( they seem more nc than tr to me ) and their knife in ps1 was a mini-chainsword .
