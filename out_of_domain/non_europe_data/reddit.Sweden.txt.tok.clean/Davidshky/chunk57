  i do n't think realism is that important for multiplayer . 
  as long as the japanese do n't show up on the east front or the russians on iwo jima in some sp missions i wo n't mind them showing up in strange places in multiplayer . 
  i 'm pretty sure there are maps in coh1 where the us or brits should n't be but that did n't prevent us from playing them . 
  sure they were a little closer than europe and the pacific but it 's still not historically accurate . 
  japan vs us could work since then you could throw in a little japan vs russia ( border skirmishes and manchuria ) and us vs germany ( ardennes for example , lots of snow and cold ) , at least as mp maps and/or tow . 
  and how do we judge wether a call is important or not ? 
  is the fury actually op or is it just the cloaky flash + fury combo that 's too good ? 
  cause if it 's the latter they should just make weapons and cloak on a flash mutually exclusive . 
  make the cloak something that takes up the weapon slot , like the esf fuel tanks . 
  no weapons + cloak but we 'd be able to have some other cert in the slot the cloak used to be in . 
  also , why does n't the flash have anything for that slot by default ? 
  i do n't think there 's any other stock vehicle with an empty weapon slot, 
  but then people would bitch and whine and say `` i paid to watch this movie !! 1 !! 111 ! '', 
  and possibly be even more disturbing than before . 
  rr mayb they would even resist the `` bouncers '' . 
  could also lead to lawsuits over use of excessive force or something . 
  i 'm already loosing my fucking mind about barney . 
  [ ** where did he go ? 
  ** ] ( http://half-life.wikia.com/wiki/barney_calhoun#half-life_2:_episode_two ), 
  i 'd say that since you already have an awesome ship , spend the ec/zen on your other characters , unless ofc they also already have awesome ships . 
  or you could spend the money on another type of ship , like and escort or a cruiser , giving you the option to fly something completely different rather than something that 's that 's almost the same as the ship you have . 
  that sounds more like guerilla warfare . 
  terrorism is about fear , that 's why it 's called ** terror ** ism . 
  if they ever became common i 'm pretty sure it would n't take long before they require some sort of licence and have strict rules about how they 're allowed to be used . 
  or they might just be banned . 
  thanks . 
  i knew about the nerfs but did n't know how much it had been nerfed . 
  btw , does anyone know if effecient stack ? 
  if so it could be interesting having a crew of saurians . 
  as the others said , save your money unless you really really want that ship . 
  you level up very quickly in this game and once you reach lvl 40 you 'll get a better ship for free , making any lower tier ship you have pretty much completely useless . 
  to compensate , they 're extremely weak to boarding parties . 
  well with the lack of boff space traits in this game , effecient is still better than nothing . 
  this gave me an idea . 
  a glider-wing cert for the flash . 
  a toggle on/off ability that while on would extend some ultra-light wings and allow the flash to glide gracefully through the air . 
  imagine driving off some cliff on indar and just gliding across the map , with no sound but the wind and the travel music . 
  i do n't think it 's illegal but rather just frowned upon . 
  iirc the pvp quests does have timer/cooldown which would prevent you from making `` too much '' dil per hour . 
  also , talking about this in public probably is n't such a good idea if you want to do this , since it might result in more people doing it ( dilithium inflation is bad mkay ) or more people complaining about it which might result in cryptic `` fixing '' it . 
  maybe the mortar halftrack if you 're using that commander . 
  not that its mortar is better than the mortar teams , but it comes with the incendiary barrage ability . 
  should be pretty effective at dealing with stationary conscripts . 
  not the mention that the extra mobility and durability is pretty handy for keeping it alive . 
  now let 's just hope the same thing is true for commanders as well . 
  i think it 's because in singleplayer you can have several `` hq '' ( some points count as hqs ) while in multiplayer you only have your base and then they just did n't bother changing the text for multiplayer . 
   nobody here bitches about the mexican who was cast to play a sikh, 
  it 's because all brown people look the same / s, 
  because not everyone want/is able to grind 8k dil per character per day . 
  i know i did n't . 
  then there was a foundry `` exploit '' some time ago that allowed people to get a lot of dilithium very easily . 
  people were able to get about 50k dil ( or more ) for about 20 minutes of work . 
  combined with the upcoming release of the romulan expansion increasing the demand for zen the prices went from around 100-105 dilper zen to 140 . 
  so yes , dilithium inflation is possible . 
  i 'd be happy with just my gear . 
  [ this post ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/planetside/comments/1apgor/account_wide_unlock_faq/c8zn0f7 ) by higby does indicate that we might get account wide unlocks of the empires equivalents . 
  ie , have/buy striker , get lancer and phoenix for your vs and nc characters . 
  unfortunately it 's been 3 months since that post and unless i 'm blind it 's not even on the roadmap . 
  why not ? 
  i mostly play vs and most of my friends play vs as well and thus most of my sc is invested in vs stuff . 
  then i have another friend who play tr who i also sometimes like to play with , and i kinda enjoy playing tr once in a while just to have fun with their high rof weapons and fast vehicles . 
  i 've also spent some time messing around as nc and loved using a `` normal '' tank for a change ( i still prefer the magrider ) and their infantry weapons sounded powerful, 
  but in the end i end up playing pretty much nothing but vs , not because i prefer vs ( though i do ) but simply because that 's were my money is . 
  i 'm not complaining that it 's not done yet but rather the complete lack of info about it . 
  other than that post by higby i have n't heard anything about it and it 's not even on the unschedueled part of the roadmap . 
  but is `` single faction play '' really a good thing ? 
  and getting into the lore ? 
  you mean this ? 
  * everyones cut off from earth . 
  * vs secedes, 
  * endless waaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrr !!!!!!!, 
  i know there is more backstory than that ( [ link ] ( http://wiki.planetside-universe.com/ps/lore ) ) but there 's not really any ingame lore at all . 
   i think soe needs a way to make money so they wo n't ever unlock weapons across all factions, 
  i disagree . 
  i think that the people buying the same/equivalent weapon for several factions is a very small minority so not much profit would be lost from them . 
  on the other hand , getting more bang for your bucks might result in more people buying weapons , i know i would . 
  i would like some sort of [ ac-130 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lockheed_ac-130 ) or a future equivalent of it ( an av-22 ? ) . 
  it would be worth it just for the visuals . 
  edit : or the ac-27j that dissidentproletariat mentioned . 
  or maybe if this was combined with some actual incentives to join/play as the underdogs people would instead switch to the underpopulated factions , possibly fixing the population imbalance problem . 
  could you tell us how you try to play your engineer ? 
  we might be able to give you some advice . 
   1 tact with grenades , lunge , and sweeping strikes . 
  if enemies are getting stunned or knocked down , they 're not shooting at you . 
  i did this with 4 tacs once . 
  photon grenade , plasma grenade , lunge and sweeing strike ( do n't remember the order ) , i 've never seen the enemies die so quickly . 
  unfortunately , when things eventually go to hell , you barely have time to blink . 
   alas , it probably has too much firepower for an arma aircraft . 
  i do n't think there really is such a thing in arma . 
  power usually comes at cost of rarity . 
  some things are `` better '' but pretty much always much less common . 
  a spectre gunship would probably be incredibly powerful but at the same time it would probably also be extremely rare . 
  also , according to wikipedia there is a total of 47 ac-130s built so it 's not like they 're common irl . 
   and is probably also too large, 
  that 's why i mentioned `` a future equivalent '' since that could mean something lighter and smaller , like the ac-27 , a gunship version of the v-22 osprey or maybe a [ quad tiltrotor ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bell_boeing_quad_tiltrotor ) gunship . 
  the two latter would also have the advantage of being vtol aircrafts making them a bit easier to use . 
  on the other hand , the size of the ac-130 might be a good thingwhen it comes to balance . 
  its massive size could to some extent compensate for its equally massive firepower . 
  pretty much yes . 
  i had enough boff slots to have 4 of each class , and with the breen and jem ` hadar boffs combined with my previous tac boffs i had 4 , so i decided to have some fun .
