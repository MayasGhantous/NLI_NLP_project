  does increased damage to barriers and armor . 
  ** geth soldier **, 
  defense matrix, 
  deployable cover . 
  a small cover similar to the cover used by geth in me1 . 
  will break after absorbing a certain amount of damage and will not block movement for friends or enemies . 
  then either the biotic missile or the heat blast . 
  some sort of glovecannon ability , maybe higher damage but lower rof than the phantom glove . 
  do n't know about the last ability . 
  maybe a flashbang that will provide a large aoe stun but no damage . 
  increased mobility . 
  normal melee is a quick sword slash . 
  heavy melee is a slower stab . 
  if the target enemy would be left with less than x % health left after a heavy melee you would do a one-hit kill instead . 
  i thought about a sort of high-power shot ability ( or laser targeting ) for it . 
  but if you can use it at the same time as the cloak it would probably be overpowered , and if you ca n't it would just be the cloak minus cloak . 
  hunters, 
  reduce/remove the stagger from their gps and fix the bug where they fire while staggered . 
  pyros, 
  make the tank on their back harder to pierce . 
  ** reapers **, 
  i 'm not sure if its lagg or intentional but they are able to fire their guns in completely different direction than they are pointing . 
  it could be biowares way to compensate for their low turn speed , or they can turn but lag makes it seem like they are looking at something else . 
  either way , remove that and give them something else to compensate . 
  just do something with them so that a drell wo n't die from getting hit by 1-2 swarmers . 
  if you spec fitness and cloak for melee damage combined with a heavy melee ( that should have about the same damage as the batarian ) you 'd have a very dangerous melee infiltrator for single targets . 
  maybe give the final fitness melee evolution something like , after killing an enemy with heavy melee , speed is increased by 20 % for 20-30 seconds and giving it maybe 10 % increased speed from the first rank of fitness . 
  i just think it should still be viable as a long range infiltrator with increased mobility . 
  me1 : tie between leaving ashley to die and fighting through the citadel . 
  me2 : probably meeting garrus . 
  me3 : infiltrator boobs . 
  i would like to disagree . 
  a salarian infiltrator with widow or javelin is in my opinion much better than any infiltrator with the valiant . 
  since energy drain will take care of the shields for you shield gating wo n't be a problem . 
  claymore , reegar and harrier are the weapons i 've found useful for the vorcha . 
  while the reegar is pretty mcuh the best shotgun for the vorcha since you 're most likely already fighting at point blank range so the limited range of the reegar wont matter . 
  on the other hand i personally prefer the claymore since it allows me to get kills at a bit longer range allowing me to get some regen before i get withing clawing distance . 
  then i like the harrier because it allows me to fight at any distance and it 's still pretty effective at close range for when you want to get up and flame things . 
  just seeing some children from different races . 
  i never found out how all the krogan babies will look like . 
  and the blueberry baby shepard and liara could have had . 
  i mean , for all i know asari lay eggs that then hatch into larvae only to take humanoid forms later in life . 
  well , the larva could come from an egg and then live on breast milk or whatever asari have . 
  well they would n't really be biotics just as the krogan sentinel is n't really a biotic . 
  they just use biotic based munition . 
  i 'd love getting civ v , now with the upcoming expansion and all . 
  spare ammo mod for assault rifles . 
  stability mod for smgs . 
  shield gate reduction mod for sniper rifles . 
  since energy drain gets a 3x multiplier vs shields and barriers and get bonus from cloak it should be able to take out the shield of hunters and pyros in one hit . 
  [ this spec ] ( http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#41paklp@0@0aa@@ ) does 495 damage with energy drain , multiplied by 3 and 1.9 it would do 2821 damage to shields which is well enough to take out the shield of a hunter or pyro if [ this ] ( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0arnvjesdlubfdezxsu5gtkvwvmywcm1fu3ayuhl6ehc&amp;gid=2 ) is correct, 
  i just tested this and you are wrong . 
  i had as much spare ammo with the clip extender as i had without . 
  not only the same goal but the heat sink is superior to the mag upgrade since you end up being able to fire as many bullets per mag as if you had the mag upgrade but you will use less ammo so your spare ammo lasts longer . 
  according to [ this ] ( http://social.bioware.com/forum/1/topic/347/index/10796091 ) on bsn it should be multiplied meaning that the damage should be ed damage * ( 1 + 0.9 ) * 3 . 
  i [ specced ] ( http://narida.pytalhost.com/me3/classes/#14lmaop@0@0aa@@ ) my batarian soldier as a ballistic blade spammer with blade armor . 
  i usually used the eviscerator x for 200 % recharge and toggled blade armor on and off depending on the situation . 
  works pretty well against anything though you might have some problem with armor unless you use your gun for that . 
  i do n't want them to hit me but since i 'm using shotgun , ballistic blade and falcon punch i tend to get punched sometimes . 
  i know it makes more sense with shield regen , but when a hunter smashes you in the face it 's nice to know he took damage as well . 
  should also be effective against phantoms but i 'm not sure since i 'm too busy spamming ballistic blades and punching them in their faces to notice if how much damage they take . 
  pretty much this . 
  tactic is fairly straight forward . 
  spam ballistic blades and shoot things . 
  if it 's only one enemy , falcon punch him . 
  with that build you can fire another salvo of blades before the first one explodes and just slightly after if the armor is active making you very good at crowd control . 
  focus on weaker enemies since you 're not very good against bosses . 
  best against geth and cerberus since they have the most `` humanoid '' enemies that you can stagger but still ok against reaper . 
  this is a step in the right direction but i still think that the turret and drone need much more health . 
  now tell me how you got a krogan/batarian/vorcha infiltrator . 
  since the damage of lash is so low ( 200 ish ) i would say yes since the 30 % extra damage would n't do much . 
  if it increased the force by 30 % as well it would be more useful but alas . 
  but if you 're not going to use it for biotic explosions you might as well get the extra damage . 
  i really hate it when we have completed the wave 10 objective and then get overrun by phantoms/hunters/banshees and everyone dies . 
  except for that one guy who keeps using his medigel and survival packs to stay alive , but for some reason wo n't use his rockets . 
  and then runs around the map for over 5 minutes taking potshots at the enemies before eventually running out of medigel or get caught by a phantom or banshee . 
  all i can think is [ this . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bifzyyt1oho&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=36s ), 
  try it with batarian soldier or a vorcha . 
  ballistic blade is the most op thing i have used on bronze and the vorcha health regen means that you can completely ignore such things as cover and common sense . 
  the ballistic blades hit everything that 's in range and in a 90-110 degree cone in front of you . 
  it 's pretty much impossible to miss and it does high damage , staggers enemies and have a short recharge time . 
  helpdesk/techsupport ? 
  except for when they 're playing chess . 
  i 'm surprised as well . 
  i liked vegas [ bromance ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsyafltjwo4 ) with garrus and found him to be a pretty cool guy . 
  edi was my least favorite , mostly because i did n't like her creepy body . 
  i prefered her as a faceless voice with a sense of humor . 
  me , since there 's not that much replay value in a puzzel game . 
  end of 9th grade in sweden . 
  final english exam . 
  test have n't started yet but we are to write our names and such on it . 
  girl behind me ask what the words `` male '' and `` female '' next to the checkboxes meant . 
  she did n't even know how to pronouce them . 
  my general rule for safe distance is 5 meters . 
  i 've been tractor beamed across entire rooms after running from a banshee . 
  why shoot it in the first place ? 
  who designs a giant anti-reaper doomsday device that activate by someone shooting a pipe until it explodes ? 
  i would give the ec ending a 4/10 . 
  not good but much better than the original ending .
