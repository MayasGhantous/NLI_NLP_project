  and fleet ship modules right now go for [ exactly 5 mil ec ] ( http://i.imgur.com/auf9g9c.png ) each so 6 fsms = 30 mil ec . 
  edit : also , keys go for [ 1,47 mil ec ] ( http://i.imgur.com/zn9gdom.png ) each . 
  20 x 1,47 mil = 29,4 mil = almost 30 mil . 
  i actually missed that part but now i checked the exchange and yeah , 34,5 mil price difference ( 94,5 vs 60 mil ) . 
  kinda ironic that if op had n't allowed himself to be ripped off like that he would n't have this current problem ( unless he had spent his profit on stuff ) . 
  being on the internet and anonymous gives you the licence to be whatever the fuck you want . 
  all i 'm saying is that people are rude and nothing you do will change that . 
  the problem is that no one reads the rules or they do n't care about them . 
  the point i 'm ( very badly ) trying to make is that reddit ( and the internet in general ) is full of assholes like mountainpew posting horrible shit and that there 's a whole bunch of other assholes upvoting it and nothing will change that . 
  browsing reddit and getting offended by these peoples comments is kinda like watching a tarantino movie and getting offended by the language . 
  i mean , what did you expect ? 
  just suck it up , downvote them , move on , downvote more assholes , rince and repeat . 
  most of these people probably care more about their imaginary internet points than the feelings of a total stranger they 've just seen a picture of . 
  nah , canadians are just europeans ( brits and french ) on a different continent . 
  same goes for the australians and new zealanders , and the rest of the colonies are honorary europeans or something . 
  the battlerifles and scout rifles make me wish we could get cert refunds for weapons we bought before they added the vr . 
  or at least give us the [ gu9 price reduction ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/planetside/comments/1evom3/gu9_weapon_price_adjustments/ ) in certs , ie , 750 certs for the brs and auto srs , 250 for the semi-srs , etc etc. 
  buying an expensive weapon and finding out it 's bad is one thing , but the gun then becoming `` cheap '' without being fixed is almost insulting . 
   ** price reduction **, 
  the br was reduced in price from 1000 to 250 certs so i think that since the damn things still suck the people who bought it earlier should get 750 certs . 
  if both of you do n't mid a little grinding it should n't be that hard . 
  lets say you get 20 keys to cover the difference . 
  that 's 2250 zen which at the current dilex price would cost 26100 dil . 
  ok , that is quite a lot of dil , but with two players grinding together it should n't take too long . 
  if you both have lvl 50 kdf characters , find out if you can do the [ empire defense ] ( http://sto.gamepedia.com/dilithium#empire_defense ) and [ pi canis daily ] ( http://sto.gamepedia.com/dilithium#pi_canis_daily ) missions together , it should n't take `` that '' long if you 're able to run them together . 
  the pi canis daily used to take 30-40 minutes for my character in a vo'quv and if both of you do it together ( if it 's possible that is ) it should take about 20 . 
  well the effecient trait is pretty easy to get as long as you do n't mind ugly boffs . 
  letheans ( kdf ) and saurians ( fed ) often have effecient . 
  imo , the av mana turret is almost worse because you ca n't counter it like a lock-on , people can use them to snipe infantry from really long range and on top of that it has infinite ammo . 
   you ca n't snipe infantry ** unless they do n't move ** , so they deserve to die then . 
  hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha !!!!!!!!!, 
  if you do get a bortas , get an aegis shield from the exchange . 
  it 's worth it for the visuals . 
  not all vaccines are compltely harmless though . 
  i do n't think they cause autism but they can have side effects , sometimes even permanent ones . 
  [ pandemrix ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pandemrix ) ( a vaccine against the 2009 swine flu ) for example seems to have been the cause of a few hundred cases of narcolepsy . 
  ofc people should still have been vaccinated but there were better alternatives . 
  you should still get the standard vaccinations ( that has been tested and used for years ) , but i think it 's ok to be skeptical when it comes to the newer ones . 
  yeah , the panzerwerfer is better for actually killing something but the katyusha is better for area denial . 
  i 've won entire games because i had one or two katyushas and used them to keep the enemy infantry away from the vps . 
  that player was just bad . 
  i 've used the russian mines a lot and the only times i 've killed german tanks with them , they were already damaged from something else , like a zis . 
  they 're really good for slowing the germans down by forcing them to reinforce squads and repair vehicles , but not for actually killing stuff . 
  it 's more like an anti tank version of the german mine field ( area denial ) and an anti personell version of the germans at mine ( kaboom , stuff dies ) . 
   it 's just testing . 
  are you sure ? 
  is n't it possible stuff like that would be in the game as captured and repainted vehicles ? 
  and concidering how the soldiers in arma 3 gets winded from jogging up a small hill , you ended up with that effect quite a lot . 
  that 's becaue he somehow fucked up and added the title to the end of the url . 
  also , it 's the same article as the current top post about veteran ships . 
  i tried it out on tribble and damn that thing was fast . 
  i tried using it with both a standard escort build ( dhcs + turrets ) and taking stuff from my a2b cruiser ( beams ) . 
  i actually found it better with beams because i could just keep moving all the time and just fly circles around my target and with my a2b spamming i was pretty much always at 125 engine power , making it faster than i thought possible . 
  it was kinda like flying a really big smallcraft with absurd firepower . 
  from what i 've heard and experienced , the western part of sweden in general uses that kind of kebab sauce . 
  all the places in sunne use similar kebab sauces and i 've heard that they have it in gothenburg as well . 
  edit : there is one place in stockholm around [ here ] ( http://kartor.eniro.se/m/ngryv ) that iirc had the same sauce as in sunne , or something extremely similar . 
  i have no idea if they 're still there though and it 's been a few years since i ate there so i could be wrong about the sauce . 
  well i guess that a majority of them wanted to but those who did n't are n't very happy about it . 
  i hope soe changes their mind about the tr brass knuckles . 
  it does n't fit them at all . 
  imo they should get chainswords , like much bigger versions of their ps1 knives . 
  cryptic should start selling ship skins like these . 
  they even have a ship costume category but the only thing in it is the nx ship registry . 
  i would love to have the romulan mirror skin ( dark red with a green shine ) on all my other romulan ships , and the federation type 6 skin ( the white refit skin ) on for example my excelsior . 
  if you want beams , get a recluse some tholian mesh weavers or the elite widows . 
  the mesh weavers have 2x dbbs , 1x ba and faw , the elite widows have 1x dbb 1xba and faw . 
  i tested the elite widows on tribble ( you can get the nukara rep stuff for free on ds9 ) and the result was beams , everywhere , all the time . 
  i thought it was illegal to buy games via proxy due to tax fraud . 
  i like to do the atmosphere assault once in a while just for fun . 
  smallcraft combat is a nice change of pace after flying around in a big fat spacewhale ( i like cruisers and carriers ) and i can get a few marks for it . 
  using a dbb and a torp launcher and dogfighting the shuttles can be really fun , or you can make some sort of attackbomber and focus on killing the walkers . 
  i really hope cryptic will add more smallcraft content in the future ( like pvp , an stf ) , and some more smallcrafts for kdf ( orion slaver and interceptor for example ) . 
  lets say a pvp mission , where both sides have 10 object they need to defend , like sattelites , disabled ships and other stationary targets . 
  you win by either destroying all enemy objects or having destroyed the most at the end of the match . 
  there is some info about it [ here ] ( http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/breen#apocrypha ) but since it 's not in any of the movies or tv series it 's not actually canon . 
  ofc it could become canon in the future since apaprently non-canon stuff has been added to canon stuff later on . 
  well i doubt that really means anything . 
  lots of `` religious '' sayings eventually just become normal expressions . 
  i 'm an atheist and i think everyone i know is that as well ( or agnostics ) and we still use all kinds of expressions and curses involving god and satan and religious stuff simply because it 's part of our language . 
  yup , but you can onyl have 2 of them because none of the dreads have 2 hangars (  :( , i really hope that when they give the romulans a real carrier it can use the drone ships as well ) while a recluse can have 4 mesh weavers flying around . 
  how about this . 
  let pioneers build them with ammo . 
  it is then remote controlledr by the pioneers who built it and the controlled have limited range so the pioneers must be within x meters for it to work . 
  maybe force one of the pioneers to run around with the controller while the goliath is active , making him unable to fight . 
   fleet pets are 50,000 fleet credits and 45,000 dilithium each . 
  do n't they cost 100k fleet credits each ? 
  is he wrong or have they changed it ? 
  this is important since that would mean i need to grind 100k less fleet credits than i thought . 
  i would be ok with a carrier that does n't have a battle cloak . 
  maybe an ordinary cloak , the same way the vo'quv does n't have a cloak at all unlike most of the other kdf ships . 
  that 's what i thought as well but they claim several times they just cost 50k fleet creds and 45k dil . 
  well it 's just that most kdf ships have cloaks , and most/all romulan ships have battle cloaks . 
  so i figured that since the vo'quv does n't have a cloak it would only be fair if this theoretical romulan carrier only had a normal cloak . 
  that 's more cloak than any other carrier . 
  also , the romulans ( or at least the remans ) should be pretty good at carriers . 
  while i ca n't provide a source because its buried deep in the sto forums , apparently the guy who designed the scimitar for st : nemesis claims it had a whole whooping five thousand scorpion fighters . 
  edit : i 'm pretty sure that ( so far ) the only romulan ships that can not use dual cannons are the two shuttles . 
  even their sci vessels can use dcs . 
  on the other hand , none of the kdf support vessels ( sci ships ) or flight-deck cruisers can use dual cannons .
