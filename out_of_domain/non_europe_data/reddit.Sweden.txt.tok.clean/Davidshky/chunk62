  i also think there are a lot of people who would be star trek fans if they just swatched it , or maybe even gave it a try but were put off by the cheesyness of tos or the quality of the two first seasons of the rest of the shows . 
   would the abrams-continuity fans not be confused with sudden 50 years of backstory they were not aware of ? 
  how do we avoid that confusion ? 
  was that a problem for any of the other shows ? 
  i was n't confused watching tng without first watching tos ( except wrath of khan ) . 
  even ds9 and voy are watchable without knowing anything about star trek . 
  well it would mean that there is a new lockbox with new fancy stuff out and everyone would start opening those boxes instead , reducing the supply of the stuff we get from romulan lockboxes . 
  i did n't like it at first , but after i had listened to enough of it , i began to like it . 
  [ it 's insidious . 
  ] ( http://24.media.tumblr.com/a2f3b2122488833281cca96aff3a6165/tumblr_mmeyha3o9w1s123tlo2_1280.png ), 
  how can you hate ezri ? 
  that 's like hating puppies !, 
  that was my first questions . 
  i basically just want to know if it would be possible to get an endless stream of free deathrobots that does n't require any uranium . 
  at that point the penalties from not having any money and too many units would n't matter as your robot army takes over the world . 
  exactly . 
  i was unsure if they were actually rebels or not so i did n't know what to call them . 
  i know that !, 
  the thing is that converted swordsmen did n't require any iron for upkeep . 
  ehm ... could you give us some more info other than that you 're a sci captain and fly a carrier ? 
  like , what weapons , boff powers and hangars do you currently use ? 
  how much ec would you be willing to spend on doffs ? 
  edit : i noticed you 're the op of [ this post ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/sto/comments/1id2xb/anyone_knows_about_this_cloack_ability/ ) so i assume you 're flying a burningdoomcarrier . 
  since you 're using gravity well , try getting a good gravimetric doff , blue or better . 
  these are almost mandatory for anyone using gw since it makes the power soooo much better . 
  also , head over to / r/stobuilds and get some help with those boff powers . 
  edit 2 : since you 're a sci officer , see if you can find some of the [ melee crit doffs . 
  ] ( http://sto.gamepedia.com/specialization:_security_officer#melee_attack_variant ) on the exchange . 
  my favorite part about having double trade routes is when you reach the late game and can adopt freedom . 
  one of the avaliable tier 3 tenets is +4 influence per turn to a city state you have a trade route with . 
  this means that venice can completely take over the world congress unless ofc there is an embargo towards city states , but then you could just use your merchants and gold to bribe them . 
  yeah , they look kinda ... cartoony with those colors but there 's also something off about the shape . 
  the 006 is almost too round , like it 's a stolen tr design with some vs stuff added later . 
  the 008 also looks kinda off , the mouth thingy does n't really fit vanu and for some reason the whole thing gave me an ns vibe ( which is kinda ironic since the new ns helmets look vanu as fuck ) . 
  on the other hand , you ca n't see any face !, 
  yay !, 
  it 's an ability right next to ( above or below ) the trade mission option . 
  just get the mov in the cs territory and use it . 
  new puppet city . 
  one thing they could do is make a spiritual successor of the miranda . 
  not a refit/retrofit but a completely new ship with a similar design , like how the connie , excelsior and galaxy all have the same basic design . 
  kinda like the [ stargazer class heavy cruiser ] ( http://sto.gamepedia.com/heavy_cruiser ) . 
  it 's named after the uss stargazer and have a very similar design with 4 nacelles but it is in no way a constellation class refit or retrofit . 
  maybe you were playing a occ . 
  this is gon na be hard to unsee ... 
  edit : i just had to make [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/y6lyggf.png ) . 
  not perfect but close enough . 
  `` rebels '' are just like normal barbarians and can be converted by missionaries . 
  unfortunately i never got any gdrs ( could be because of my difficulty ) and the `` bug '' that i experienced with my converted swordsmen ( not requiring any iron ) did n't apply to the rebel tanks and oil so i 'm assuming that it wo n't work with gdrs and uranium either . 
  on the other hand , i got buried in pretty much all the other atomic , modern and information era land units , including several xcom squads . 
  the jem ` hadar heavy escort carrier looks pretty sweet . 
  that could work for balance if everyone got some permanent implant for free that 's equally good to those bought with certs/sc . 
  though i would prefer them having drawbacks like jtgates suggested . 
  while i have never been saved by the rebels , i tend to play with raging barbarians and it has happened that attacking armies have been weakened by the hordes swarming out from the nearby encampment . 
  yeah , it 's kinda silly that the atrox is the only ( proper ) carrier without frigate pets . 
  they even gave the scimitar frigate pets for some reason even though that thing is more like an escort carrier/fd-cruiser bastard thing than a carrier . 
  i also feel sorry for the jh dread since you need to own an jhas with the same character to use their frig pets . 
  would have been more fitting if he had the heathen conversion reformation belief . 
  if you 're gon na be using a lot of faith to for example buy religious units , buildings and stuff like that df would be better but gof would give you a very nice culture boost and most likely enough faith to get you a religion early . 
  all the prevous vouchers have worked for me here in sweden . 
  i even used a 20 % voucher when preordering bnw and that worked . 
  dude , they had it for 28 % off even before release . 
  10 % normal pre-order bonus and then a 20 % voucher ( 0.9 * 0.8 = 0.72 ) . 
  edit : also , [ cartels ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cartel ) are kinda illegal mmmmkay . 
  afaik , unfortunately yes . 
  fortunately for me though , sweden got british prices ( i guess it 's because we do n't use the euro ) on gmg so bnw for example cost 20 gbp instead of 30 euro . 
  men carl philip \u00e4r ju [ the king in the north ] ( http://i.imgur.com/lqqeaih.jpg ) !, 
  i take it that your byzantine tactic works because at that point no one has the culture needed to defend against all that tourism . 
  apparently there have been 8 ships named [ hms vengeance ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hms_vengeance ) . 
  i can think of several reasons . 
  feeling that a character is `` done '' , ie , it has a good ship , very good gear , tier 5 reputation and stuff like that meaning that there 's pretty much nothing to work towards , no way to improve that character . 
  i personally have a lot of characters but i do n't spend more time playing because of that . 
  many of them are only used semi-passively for stuff like doffing but will eventually be used once i 'm `` done '' with my current character . 
  then there 's also the aspect of trying different class + ship combinations . 
  that 's what i 'm thinking as well . 
  though imagine if the shields were white . 
  equip the ns lmg , the new ns helmet ( why soe why ? 
  ) , a nice camo and active your shield . 
  heavy assault just became eavy infiltrator . 
  shrapnel and fragments . 
   [ the percentage of casualties caused by artillery in various theaters since 1914 : in the first world war , 45 percent of russian casualties and 58 percent of british casualties on the western front ; in the second world war , 75 percent of british casualties in north africa and 51 percent of soviet casualties ( 61 percent in 1945 ) and 70 percent of german casualties on the eastern front ; and in the korean war , 60 percent of us casualties , including those inflicted by mortars . 
  field artillery and firepower ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/artillery#modern_era_.e2.80.93_rifling ), 
  as you can imagine , having a helmet against shrapnel would have been kinda important even if it did n't do shit against a direct hit from a rifle . 
  heck , even modern helmets are ( afaik ) kinda crappy against bullets . 
  how ? 
  maybe so , but shrapnel was the main reason we started using helmets again . 
  we stopped using helmets at one point because firearms made them completely pointless . 
  it was n't until ww1 when there was shrapnel and crap flying through the air all the time that there was a point to start using them . 
  but does a bullet have enough force to do that ? 
  the force of the impact will be even less than the recoil from firing the bullet . 
   for all the daily missions carriers are now less effective . . 
  it 's a 4 % damage reduction . 
  ** 4 percent !, 
  no , they just become sith themselves . 
   those of us that already are at maximum bank and inventory space . 
  they really should increase the limit of how many extra bank slots you can purchase . 
  should n't be that hard to do and it would probably make them more money . 
  i think there is one way . 
  while i did n't do this as venice ( played france ) , i did manage to get a settler by using a missionary with the heathen conversion reformation belief and converting someones stolen settler . 
  someone should do a duel with a friend and test if this is possible as venice .
