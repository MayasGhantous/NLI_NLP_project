  well panzerkampfwagen roughly just translates to armored ( panzer ) fighting/combat ( kampf ) vehicle ( wagen ) so the name is n't that strange . 
  i guess german is kinda like swedish were there are few/no limits to how many words you can combine into one . 
  for example there is, 
  which roughly translates to, 
  `` northern baltic sea coast artillery reconnaissance flight simulator construction equipment maintenance monitoring systems talk posts preparation works . '', 
  i guess it 's because that 's the size of a roman [ centuria ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/roman_infantry_tactics#force_structure ) . 
  melee weapons ( that do physical damage ) really are the ultimate anti-borg weapons . 
  when me and my friends run ground stfs we pretty much only use melee weapons and the borg just do n't stand a chance . 
  yeah , but personally i prefer 80 % shield penetration vs range . 
  and if you 're using swords and not bat ` leths or lirpas you have the superior gravity defying charge which means that range is n't that much of a problem . 
  if you 're ambushed you will have no control over your troops until the ambushers actually attack or are discovered . 
  so you will be forced to watch your army march in a long collumn while the enemies sneak around and prepare their sneaky little sneak attack . 
   do you think they will add the cardassians as a major race, 
  i 'm like 90 % sure the cardassians will be the next mini-faction ( hopefully with jem ` hadar defectors and mmmmmaybe even vortas ) . 
  i think they even mentioned it or at least kinda hinted towards it in an interview . 
  maybe they 'll also add a dominion rep system and anti-dominion fleet actions . 
  let 's say the dominion is fucking around and has once again managed to rush through the wormhole and taken over some new systems and the cardassians are forced to defend themselves because the federation is too busy hunting space bunnies on new romulus . 
  according to [ this ] ( http://www.army-guide.com/eng/product2819.html ) site they cost about $ 4.16 m each and [ swedish wikipedia ] ( http://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/artillerisystem_08 ) says 27m sek each which is about $ 4.15 m. 
  higby did say some stuff about that [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/planetside/comments/1apgor/account_wide_unlock_faq/c8zn0f7 ) but that was over 4 months ago , i havent seen anything else about it , he did n't answer my messages and last time i checked it 's nowhere on the roadmap . 
  looks like a [ saab 29 tunnan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saab_29_tunnan ) and a modern fighter had a child . 
  the crecent wave cannon comes with the escort but the heavy crecent cannon is part of a new 3 item lobi store set . 
   an all-new 3-piece space set also being added to the lobi crystal store will allow players to combat the elachi using some of their most potent experimental weaponry against them . 
  the heavy crescent wave cannon can be fitted on any starship and has a 180-degree firing arc . 
  this weapon is similar to existing single cannon weaponry except that it fires fewer bolts in shorter , much heavier bursts , with a longer cooldown between firing cycles . 
   the elachi subspace torpedo causes local disruptions in subspace at the point of impact , without causing permanent damage . 
  this temporary distortion has a high chance of briefly disabling the ship functions of enemies caught in the blast . 
   available alongside these two potent weapons is a universal console -- bioneural infusion circuits , which enhances many different ship systems . 
  equipping any two of this set will enhance your shields and disruptor damage , while having all three pieces fitted on a ship will cause an effect known as haywire . 
  once haywire is in effect on your ship , you will periodically gain orbiting energy charges which have a chance to reflect incoming energy weapon fire in the form of disruptor pulses that penetrate the shields of the enemy which triggered the pulse . 
  haywire is more effective if this set is fitted onto an elachi starship . 
  well i assume that a warhammer tw game would be about whfb and not 40k . 
  no , but it 's ( imo ) slightly less silly . 
  and there 's not many warhammer fantasy games out there . 
  when i use the russian mines i do n't just use them but i abuse them . 
  i will get as many muniton caches as i can ( my team probably hates me ) , a small force ( 2 in squads , mg and at gun ) and some engineers . 
  then i run around and place as many mines that i can around c/vps , chokepoints , fireplaces , corners , building entrances , roadd and anywhere else i feel like . 
  on winter maps , i like to use the blizzards to run into enemy territory and mine their fireplaces ( an other places ) and then gtfo before they have time to deal with me . 
  in the end , i will have so much fuel ( and usually manpower ) left due to not building any buildings or vehicles other than the t2 for at guns that i can spam whaterver vehicles i get from my commander . 
  one time i got 5 kv-8s and an is-2 and just steamrolled the germans together with my allies su-85s . 
  are you sure you 're not just playing the civil war scenario ? 
  well the game continues into the industrial , modern , atomic eras and beyond so you 'll get more modern stuff . 
  i once captured jerusalem during a counter-attack by rushing the walls with some pilgrims and ladders , capturing the gate and then charging into the town square with all my cav ( except two that captured the other gates ) and then using all my pilgrims and fanatics to defend the ladders for 3 minutes . 
  yeah . 
  imo , if it 's a boarding action the ship should try to slow down more before impact to prevent damage to both ships . 
  that way the lack of damage would n't be a problem . 
  dual cannons do the same damage as dual heavies per cycle . 
  it 's just that dcs fire in 2 second bursts and dhcs in 1 second bursts . 
  and since procs are per cycle ( or at least should be ) it should n't be any difference between dcs and dhcs for procs . 
  on the other hand , dhcs are better due to their crtd bonus and better power usage so get those anyway . 
  i 'm pretty sure procs are per cycle so the proc rate should be the same . 
  according to [ wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sling_%28weapon%29#combat ) slings did have greater range back then with the exception of the composite bow but then the sling was a lot more cost effecient . 
  maybe some sort of [ octeres ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hellenistic-era_warships#octeres ) ? 
  google gave me these two pictures . 
  so i guess it would be one of those but with two towers . 
  that 's what i meant with their power usage being better . 
  using 12 power for 1 sec is better than 10 for 2 . 
  it 's pretty `` samey '' as in the factions are very similar but it does ( kinda ) have more units , or at least types of units than s2 : tw . 
  you still got access to samurai as well as different types of line infantry , marksmen , cannons and firearm cavalry . 
  it 's also fairly balanced in terms of modern units vs old units since if you can get your kachis ( samurai ) into melee it 's gon na be like the beginning of the last samurai but it can also end up like the end of the last samurai . 
  ship combat is like a much more polished version of e : tws but with steam-powered ships , ironclads and torpedo boats . 
  i 'm at work ( gaming sites are blocked ) so if someone could mirror it to imgur i would be very happy , 
  armstrong and parrot guns in fots . 
  destroy half the enemy army from across half the map , watch the survivors rout the second they get into a fight with your line infantry . 
  later on you will be given the choice of becoming the imperial/shogunate vanguard or declaring yourself independent . 
  the only real advantage ( afaik ) of independence is that you can conquer japan for yourself . 
  think of it as hard mode where everyone declares war on you . 
  wee 're posting chivalry : medieval warfare quotes . 
  no more 9615961895691 tiny tiny armies ( like 1-2 units each ) that the ai spam everywhere to block paths and pillage everything all the time that you can not kill because they just run away all the time . 
  maybe combat-speed should be a game option . 
  use mines , lots of mines . 
  the soviet mines are extremely spammable and should be used around chokepoints and c/vps as often as possible . 
  if it 's a winter map , try to sneak around and mine fireplaces behind enemy lines . 
  a german tank is much less dangerous with a damanged engine and half its health gone and same goes for infantry squads . 
  from my own experience with pre-order bonuses and physical copies , you tend to get a paper with a code with the game . 
  then you redeem the code somewhere ( steam , origin , etc ) and recieve the bonus . 
  ofc this might not be true for rome 2 but that 's the way it usually works . 
  ofc there will be a cd-key since the game requires steam ( afaik ) but usually for pre-order bonuses there will be a second key on a separate piece of paper that you redeem after the game . 
  iirc , gmg did n't have any problems with the bnw release . 
  the thing was that they released their codes on the world wide release date which was [ 3 days after the us release . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/civilization_v:_brave_new_world ), 
  this meant that it was only `` delayed '' for any americans who bought it on gmg since they had to wait until the 12th like the rest of us . 
  might be because gmg is from the uk . 
  strange . 
  i remember / r/civ having lots of americans complaining about having to wait for the ww release . 
  warhammer total war . 
  plenty of different factions , lots of lore to work with , almost neverending war between everyone and everything . 
  it would be perfect for a tw game . 
  well i 'm talking about fantasy warhammer that 's pretty much the medieval world + magic , demons , orks , elves etc etc etc ( and satanist vikings ) . 
  here are some art examples . 
  [ empire soldiers ] ( http://cdn.obsidianportal.com/assets/39897/empire__1_.jpg ) . 
  [ chaos warriors ] ( http://images.sodahead.com/polls/0/0/0/8/6/7/9/8/5/warhammer_mark_of_chaos_battle_1521.jpeg ) . 
  [ a skaven ] ( http://images4.alphacoders.com/267/267106.jpg ), 
  [ another chaos warrior ] ( http://i.imgur.com/frm0ffz.jpg ) . 
  hmmm, 
  i 'm not sure if 28,4 zen is really worth the wait . 
  i think all ships should be able to board and probably ram but that some ships are better than others at it . 
  i 've found that having lower taxes can be a quite effective way at increasing your income since it will increase city growth and reduce the amount of units needes to opress the population . 
  it 's extra useful in m2 since the size upgrades for cities ( that unlock better buildings ) require a certain population so having lower taxes and better farms will make your cities grow faster and give you better stuff faster . 
  i think they 've mentioned that navies will get something pretty much exactly like this but only in friendly waters . 
  basically , any enemy fleet entering the region of water would get into a battle with the fleets defending that area .
