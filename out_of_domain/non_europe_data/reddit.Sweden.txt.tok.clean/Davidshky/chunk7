  i might even let casey hudson live . 
  most countries were or wanted to be neutral . 
  i do n't doubt that 90 % of the countries involved in ww2 would have sold anything to any side if it meant not being invaded . 
  unfortunately most countried did n't get to choose . 
  you could be right . 
  another explanation is that all 3 ( now 4 ) options are just ways to make shepard commit suicide . 
  instead of finding the actual way of activating the crucible shepard dies of an explosion , gets electrocuted or jumps of a ledge . 
  and thus the cycle continues . 
  like italy . 
  thank you . 
  not many people seem to know that most of the world stayed neutral or simply jumped on the bandwaggon when the allies were winning . 
  belgium , the netherlands and norway all declared neutrality . 
  only reason people do n't whine about them being neutral was because germany invaded them anyway . 
  i 've declared war just to use up all my nukes before i get my science victory . 
  one small adition would be to make the space ship , un and utopia project avaliable for construction even if that victory type is disabled . 
  just make them really great world wonders . 
  i would also like more atomic and future era gameplay . 
  especially future era since the only future thing about it is the giant death robot . 
  i want space elevators , orbital bombardment , missile defense systems etc. 
  problem with the reegar is you 're completely worthless at medium/long range . 
  i prefer the claymore or harrier since then you can get your hp regen going from a distance and still be extremely effective at short range . 
  which is a damn good thing since that 's what you 'll be using 90 % of the time if you 're not a soldier . 
  though in most games that 's every other civilization so i usually just try to nuke every capital . 
  i do n't know why i find [ this ] ( http://desmond.imageshack.us/himg52/scaled.php?server=52&amp;filename=brlipnem.jpg&amp;res=landing ) so funny . 
  [ i disagree ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hycuey4dpga ), 
  weeeeeeeeeeeeee, 
  any zelda game or any pokemon game . 
  in my defense i 've never owned any sort of console ever and i do n't like emulators very much . 
  here 's a list of things i would like, 
  * ** new enemies **, 
  * ** new enemies **, 
  * ** new enemies **, 
  * ** new enemies **, 
  * ** new enemies **, 
  * ** new enemies **, 
  * ** new enemies **,

  you 're actually not really supposed to retire . 
  it 's just that in the rest of the world the life expectancy has gone up without anyone changing the retirement age . 
  for example , in 1960 the life expecanty of a man was 67 years . 
  that means that a lot of men did n't live to retriement and those who did most likely did n't have much time left . 
  well , with the mercs , mechs and collectors you could have 5 new factions . 
  combine that with [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/mecoop/comments/v0959/idea_for_new_enemies_split_each_faction_into/ ) idea and you should have enough factions . 
  i sometimes do that but i really really love engraved walls . 
  we could also call it a plaza , but the word square is more common . 
  i feel the same way . 
  it has so many more problems than just the ending . 
  it 's just that they were n't very noticable during my first playthrough , mostly because then i was too busy playing the game to analyze everything . 
  currently replaying me1 and loving it and will probably replay me2 soon but i doubt i will touch me3 in a long time . 
  except maybe if they add something fun in multiplayer . 
  what i want to know is how it changes synthetics . 
  i can imagine organics having synthetic upgrades . 
  but does this mean that the geth now have organic fleshy squishy bits ? 
  secondly , i do n't really see how synthesis fixes the problem . 
  what will stop the synth/org hybrids from creating pure synthetics ? 
  would these new synthetics somehow magically become hybrids themselves after creation ? 
  are they gon na activate the crucible every 5 years or something to make sure everything is properly hybridized ? 
  cause if not i do n't see any reason the organic vs synthetic conflict would n't continue except that now it would be hybrids vs pure synthetics . 
  not sure when they started but for example i found a thread from aprid 2010 where they call it the circus . 
  so it 's been around for a while . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.flickr.com/photos/74226795@n06/7500734976/in/set-72157630418167682/ ) are some more . 
  ballistic blades are also very good against phantoms . 
  mostly because they stagger and pretty much ca n't miss . 
   guardians : have their shields be truly impenetrable and cover the window slit with atlas glass that can break first or be penetrated , not the whole shield , and make him pick up his shield when if he loses it, 
  oh god . 
  how about just increasing speed and hp , maybe adding some armor on top of his health ? 
  cause guardians with inpenetrable shields would be worse than a hunter/pyro hybrid in close quarters . 
  is this the same glitch as the scorpion rocket glitch ? 
  `` we must embrace pain and burn it as fuel for our journey '', 
  that 's most likely just simple [ protest voting ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/protest_vote ) . 
  i already find them kinda dangerous at close range unless i have a cover piercing weapon or something accurate enough to mailslot them . 
  i usually do n't play against cerberus without something to counter guardians . 
  the problem with changing it back to rivers being on tiles would be how they affect movement and combat . 
  you could change it so that a river tile acts like a forest/hill etc , costing more movement points and gives the unit on it a defense bonus . 
  though i kinda like the tactical thing about rivers only giving a bonus if the enemy has to attack over it . 
  this is what happen when you get banned from ( r / ) pyongyang . 
  because right now guardians are useless because they move slowly and do n't have much health . 
  if they could actually get in range faster and take more damage before dying they could actually be dangerous . 
  possibly give them an anti-headshot helmet as well . 
  i tried amazon plus and got a map that was mostly jungles but had some pretty large areas of nothingg but rivers and marshes . 
  i would like a show in the stargate universe following one of the deadalus class ships . 
  / r/rainbowbar, 
  just do n't show them to / r/masseffect . 
  not sure if it 's really supposed to happen but i 've gotten panzers from budapest and have seen other civs using units they should not have access to . 
  i 'm with you on that one . 
  i still have n't forgiven her for doreah . 
  now after g&k i really like starting in a desert area . 
  with desert folklore and holy warriors i can pull an army out of my ass in just a few rounds . 
  not sure about the ua but i think he shold have red army infantry and katyusha rocket launchers . 
  ra infantry would either replace great war infantry or normal infantry , have some sort of tundra/snow bonus and maybe 15-25 % increased combat strength if a friendly unit is in a nearby tile or something like +10 % for each nearby friendly unit . 
  katyusha rocket launchers should be like artillery that does n't need to set up before firing and probably be able to move further . 
  how about both ? 
  they 're cheaper and weaker but if you buch some together they 'll be as strong as the units they replace . 
  it 's not really the ied that 's indisciminate but rather the guy who detonates it . 
  they 're usually detonated remotely by someone in the area . 
  if the same person could drop a smartbomb it would be just as indisciminate . 
  celts and ethiopia are really good for getting religion early but spain is my favorite if you get lucky with natural wonders . 
  get the +4 faith bonus from natural wonders which is then doubled from spains ua and you will be swimming in faith . 
   blade armor power,
