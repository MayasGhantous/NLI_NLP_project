  all + x % bonuses except the lvl 1-3 equipment upgrades stack . 
  i tested it as the iceni and suebi by recruiting the same units at different times and then comparing the stats . 
  i even destroyed one of the buildings ( after saving ) to see if the stats dropped , and they did . 
  i could recruit longbow hunters with 51 damage as suebi by building a bunch of lumber mill thingies and the temples that give range damage bonuses and that was without upgrading all of them to max level ( should be 54 damage/100 % bonus with 4x t4 lumber mills and 4x temples ) . 
  another example would as rome . 
  get 4 temples to mars and a training field and you 'll get +25 % morale . 
  well dignitaries boost the authority of the general and at least personally i prefer authority over zeal in terms of abilities and bonuses and while cunning is also nice military intelligence is n't very useful . 
  ouch . 
  my parthian civil was was waaay too easy . 
  i only owned two regions of the starting province , was at friendly terms with the seleucid bloc and had turned my northern neighbours into satrapies . 
  as a result i had about two provinces of allied territory between my capital and my other regions . 
  then they ended up with negative food and started losing troops . 
  my capital had 0 net food and it did n't take long before they conquered some food consuming region from my satrapies . 
  then my cataphract stack and satrapy blob reached them and it was over . 
  that was my plan as egypt . 
  i have 7 stacks of egyptian infantry and one lone general sitting in a recruitment province just waiting for the civil war . 
  got to imperium lvl 3 and had only 37 % support but for some reason the civil war wo n't start . 
  i just want to stampede around with elephants and laugh . 
  they should add [ the ( ericsson ) globe ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ericsson_globe ) as some sort of happiness/culture/tourism wonder . 
  any changes to whistling arrows ? 
  well here 's the thing . 
  for me , the authority stat bonuses are the best , followed by cunning . 
  by those i mean the + x % something to the general and the in-battle abilities . 
  on the other hand i 'm not very fond of the authority skills . 
  by attaching a dignitary to the army my general will get a huge authority boost giving him a larger command aura and the authority abilities . 
  then i can spec him in zeal or cunning in order to get the skills i want , like night battles . 
   ** 50 % eastern swedish and 50 % central swedish !, 
  ftfy , rebel scum . 
  well i 'm pretty sure that for non-senate factions , having less than 50 % support should be low enough for a civil war . 
  i assume you mean parthia . 
  in that case , tech eastern cataphract , train eastern cataphracts , get royal cataphract general , charge with 20 groups of cataphracts . 
  also , put their trample ability on auto-cast ( right click on it ) so the cataphracts will use it automatically when charging . 
  i would say the suebis longbow hunters just because you can get a 100 % damage bonus by building 4x builders hall ( 20 % bonus each ) and 4x the thunaraz religious buildings ( 5 % bonus each ) in a province . 
  the builders hall also gives them lvl 3 ammo so they 'll get 80 % more ammo . 
  this does require some teching and quite a lot of food but i think it 's worth it when you have archers with over 50 damage . 
  tl ; dr , suebi longbow hunters because barbarian bonus stacking is op . 
  all + x % bonuses except those with a lvl will stack additively . 
  ie , 2x iron workshops wo n't give you any additional bonuses but 2x bronze furnaces will . 
  4x bronze furnaces + 1x iron workshop would give you +100 % melee attack for infantry , +40 % melee defense and +10 % armor . 
  on the other hand this would mean -50 public order from squalor . 
  did n't feel like waiting over 30 turns for the iron workshop so this is just an 80 % attack bonus . 
  4x bronze furnace , 1x mead hall , 4x the religious building that gives +8 public order . 
  i built 4 bronze furnaces in the same province . 
  since all + x % bonuses ( except the ones with levels ) stack additively , this gives me plus 80 % melee attack and 40 % melee defense for all infantry units recruited in this province . 
  unfortunately non-barbarian factions are n't as good as this since other they do n't really have anything equivalent to the bronze furnace or builders hall . 
  what they can do , or at least rome and the hellenistic factions can do is something like this . 
  4x [ temple of mars ] ( http://dsi0fanyw80ls.cloudfront.net/en/building/rom_roman_temple_mars_3rom_roman ) / [ ares ] ( http://dsi0fanyw80ls.cloudfront.net/en/building/rom_hellenic_temple_ares_3rom_hellenisticsc_rom_greek ) . 
  the [ practince castrum ] ( http://dsi0fanyw80ls.cloudfront.net/en/building/rom_roman_military_buff_inf_defence_2rom_roman ) / [ practice camp ] ( http://dsi0fanyw80ls.cloudfront.net/en/building/rom_hellenic_military_buff_inf_defence_2rom_hellenistic ) and the [ combat post ] ( http://dsi0fanyw80ls.cloudfront.net/en/building/rom_roman_military_buff_inf_attack_2rom_roman ) buildings in the province capital . 
  at least i think you should be able to build both , have n't tried but i think it 's possible . 
  the melee barrack . 
  armor and weapon upgrade buildings . 
  now you should have able to recruit rank 6 ( or higher ) melee units with 30 % more morale and a whole bunch of other bonuses in defense , attack , charge , shield and armor . 
  fyi , since patch 4 fire arrows have been changed into anti-morale ammo like in previous tw games . 
  my favorite build is something like this . 
  conscripts --  maxim mg --  at-gun --  another conscript --  maybe a mortar or more infantry --  more engineers --  mines !, 
  glorious mines !!!, 
  --  more mines !!!, 
  --  additional mines !!!, 
  mine everything everywhere all the time ( especially fireplaces ) and then just sit back and watch the germans cry because no one ever uses minedetectors . 
  i think the other factions should have some limited auxiliary access . 
  like you would have to build a tier 3 barrack and you 'll only get the melee units with the melee barrack and range units with the range barrack ( except for parthia since they 're strange ) . 
  so if i 'm playing as sparta and build a hoplite barrack somewhere in france i should at least get access to celtic warriors . ', 
  build a skirmisher camp in rodhos and get access to auxiliary rhodian slingers . 
  i kinda wish they swapped some regions between carthage and nova-carthago . 
  let 's say carthage got ncs african regions and nc got lilybaeum , `` sardinia '' ( forgot the name of the city ) and mmmmmmaybe qarth hadasht ( spelling ? ) . 
  that way carthage would be the african half while nova carthago is the colony half . 
  when they do that they could also make nc a playable faction . 
  would n't require much except coming up with 3 new traits . 
  since carthage and egypt have already been mentioned i 'm gon na say pontus . 
  mostly because you have so many different neighbours . 
  if you play as the barbarians you 're surrounded by other barbarians , if you play as parthia you 're surrounded by horse archers ( unless baktria does stuff ) and if you play as a greek faction you 're surrounded by greeks ( !!!!! 1 ! ) . 
  as pontus you have several hellenistic factions around you but also celts , thracians , steppe nomands and eastern factions nearby . 
  the seleucid clusterfuck is also fairly close . 
  fyi , if you stop taxing a province it wo n't produce or consume food . 
  this is useful as a sort of emergency band-aid when you have negative food since it can prevent starvation until you 've fixed the problem . 
  super-late-game unit added in bnw . 
  it 's an upgraded paratrooper with longer jump range and higher combat strength . 
  the difference is that khanid ships are pure missile ships . 
  roden ships mix hybrid and missile bonuses and generally have less drones `` to compensate '' for the extra missile launchers . 
  [ `` the slow blade penetrates the shield '' - picard ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkqfhpjuxgk ), 
  well he could play as macedon and you as a greek faction . 
  yes it is . 
  civil wars are supposed to be hard , it 's not a minor rebellion or a slave uprising . 
  well afaik , the amount of stacks varies depending on some factors , difficulty being one of them . 
  riker convince picard to take a short vacation . 
  picard goes to desert planet with some old friends . 
  things do n't go as planned as they are attacked by `` old deryck whimbley '' and his nephew , `` young deryck whimbley '' . 
  reminds me of [ this guy ] ( http://i.imgur.com/uz5lhcj.jpg ) ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ sorry ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ for ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ shitty ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ quality, 
  in my current seleucid campaign one of my newly conquered and poorly defended cities was besieged . 
  after sitting there for a few turns , the ai finally decided to attack ( i guess waiting one more turn was n't honorable ) and i figured it was worth a try to defend since i had boiling oil and a hoplite general . 
  that plan did n't work out since the ai decided it would be much more fun to use 12 siege ladders instead . 
  while my slingers did some damage before they reached the walls they were quickly overwhelmed . 
  my eastern spearmen managed to hold them off at some places but my entire right flank collapsed . 
  then the enemy decided to start burning down the gate as well , most likely to get his cavalry inside . 
  in the end my general was running around killing spearmen on the wall while my levy pikemen sat in the gate and repelled all the horses since the rest of my forces where dead , gone or just generally useless . 
  9/10 , would have desperate last stand again . 
  i think you get 4 free instant ladders since after the patch ( at least i did ) so i guess it was only 2 turns . 
  i really wish satrapies , clients , defensive allies and military allies had different colors . 
  maybe also one for factions you have a non-agression pact with . 
  royal peltasts .
