  bunch of crazy murdermachines that would scare a suebi berserker . 
  honorable mentions : dogs , ballistas , pikemen in general and all cavalry with the tramble ability . 
  maybe he confused the training camp with the barrack . 
  i think rome 2 could use something like this . 
  every faction should have an `` area of interest '' ( or whatever it should be called ) around their starting position . 
  for example , a germanic faction would have most of germany as their aoi while the etruscans would have the three italian provinces as theirs . 
  if an outsider starts to intrude in this area the faction would get a bit annoyed ( ie , diplomatic penalty ) . 
  the more regions they take and the closer to their starting position they get the more annoyed the faction will be . 
  the idea is that this should result in a sort of local realm divide as several smaller factions are gon na gang up on you to defend their aoi . 
  like if you 've conquered about 1/3rd of germany as a non-local , the remaining factions are gon na realize that they 're next , stop fighting each other and create a big military alliance to counter you . 
  imo they 're actually not that bad . 
  ( though they could use an attack buff ), 
  one of my more succesful egypt tactics was to just use full stacks of egyptian infantry . 
  this allowed me to field more armies at the same time . 
  to for example leave one army behind in a new city for repression while the others continued on , or to spread them out and intercept enemy armies . 
  and since egyptian infantry only require a hellenistic hamlet/settlement to be recruited it makes it extremely easy to replace casualties even in your new regions . 
  tl ; dr , embrace their worthlessness and compensate with numbers . 
  `` quantity has a quality all its own '' . 
  if they get rhodosian slingers i would so love to play as them . 
  maybe a minor greek faction pack with rhodos , knossos ( cretan archers !, 
  ) , massalia and crimmeria . 
  since you 're playing as the nomads it 's possible that you do n't suck . 
  i 'm pretty good at this game ( i think ) but i 'm worthless as the nomads . 
  it might be because i 'm playing on very hard but i 'm getting my ass kicked a lot . 
  only succesful tactics i 've found so far is, 
  a ) get a stack of armored horse archers and just kite the enemy . 
  since horse archers can shoot backwards just slowly walk away from the enemy units ( until they get too close , then run for a bit ) and keep bombarding them with heavy arrows . 
  b ) get a ton of young axes and some ballistas and blob like a motherfucker . 
  young axes suck but when you throw like 34 groups of them at the enemy it does n't really matter , though i wish we could at least recruit steppe spearmen and steppe archers . 
  thracian/dacian culture pack . 
  odrysian kingdom , tylis , getae . 
  tried them with the all-factions mod but they could use some fleshing out and the odrysians need hellenistic temples . 
  `` minor greek factions '' pack . 
  rhodos would have rhodos slingers and knossos cretan archers . 
  they could possibly get even better versions ( like an elite version with better armor and morale ) . 
  massalia and cimmeria would have a mix of barbarian and hellenistic units . 
  dunno about syracusae but i 'd like to see them a bit more fleshed out . 
  maybe something italian . 
  maybe he should wait until season 8 and use some marks to give his other characters a boost , unless ofc they 're also at tier 5 . 
  but can you recruit them ? 
  might just be that the encyclopedia is n't updated and i havent been playing long enough but i ca n't find out how to recruit steppe spearmen or archers . 
  if you check their encyclopedia pages there 's no building requirement listed . 
  to me it looks like they 're just garrison units . 
  i think it should be possible for generals to `` fall '' in battle and survive . 
  something like this . 
  * minor injury : the general is incapacitated for the rest of the battle but will quickly recover afterwards . 
  * serious injury : the general is wounded and will spend a few turns recovering . 
  same as if he was wounded in an assassination attempt . 
  * crippling injury : the general is permanently retired but will still be able to work as a statesman . 
  * fatal injury : the general dies . 
  maybe so but i still think it would make sense . 
  like your general is hit by an arrow . 
  it could be serious enough that he 's carried away to his medicus/healer/druid but after a week or two of recovery he 's back in action . 
  well they throw spears when charging and have `` use the whip '' and having a full stack of them cost about 1000 in upkeep ( ( 50 x 19 + generals upkeep ) * any upkeep modifiers ) . 
  well they have higher armor , melee defense and a bit more morale and health than egyptian javelinmen , slingers and archers . 
  they also cost about 30 % less in upkeep . 
  and as i mentioned , `` quantity has a quality all its own '' . 
  [ steppe archers ] ( http://dsi0fanyw80ls.cloudfront.net/en/unit/ste_archers ), 
  [ steppe spearmen ] ( http://dsi0fanyw80ls.cloudfront.net/en/unit/ste_spear ), 
  [ tribesmen ] ( http://dsi0fanyw80ls.cloudfront.net/en/unit/ste_tribesmen ), 
  i do n't see any building requirement ,, 
  afaik , all those are exclusively garrison units . 
  check again ... 
  royal scythia ( or the other steppe nomads , but scythia start with a 4 region province ) because of bonus stacking . 
  like the other barbarian factions they have access to bronze furnaces and builders hall . 
  if you build 4x builders hall and 4x temple of whatshisname in a province you 'll get a 100 % damage bonus for missile units . 
  this means horse archers with 60 range damage or royal horse skirmishers with 80 ( !!, 
  ! 1 ) range damage . 
  if you stack 4x bronze furnaces you 'll get an 80 % melee attack and 40 % melee defense bonus . 
  if you add lvl 3 weapons on that and you should get a 100 % melee attack bonus . 
  for me it took some getting used to ( understatement of the day ) , but it 's not that hard . 
  horse archers can fire behind them while moving so they can just kite infantry around the map until they run out of ammo or targets . 
  another good thing is that ( except for the cheapest crappiest ones ) even their range cavalry is pretty good in melee . 
  [ armored horse arhcers ] ( http://dsi0fanyw80ls.cloudfront.net/en/unit/ste_armour_horse_archers ), 
  [ scythian royal skirmishers ] ( http://dsi0fanyw80ls.cloudfront.net/en/unit/ste_scythian_royal_skirmishers ), 
  just look at the royal skirmishers stats . 
  weak in melee and poor morale my ass . 
  i still miss that smug face . 
  i gave up recreating it after too many hours in the char editor . 
  the way i use missile units is simply as anti-morale units . 
  basically , there 's a small morale penalty just from being under fire and an even bigger penalty if its fire arrows/javelins . 
  at first , i use normal ammo for max damage . 
  then i focus fire on either, 
  * a ) the squishiest target since it 'll die/rout faster and cause a morale penaly faster, 
  * b ) the enemy general . 
  if he dies all enemy troops without the diciplined trait will get a morale penalty . 
  * c ) the biggest cluster . 
  hitting more enemies = better . 
  then once the enemies start being shaken or even wavering , i switch to fire ammo . 
  combined with advancing my melee troops and maybe a cavalry charge the battle pretty much ends right there . 
  they might not kill much but they 're still extremely valuable . 
  well i 'm currently playing as scythia on vh and i 'm not having any problems ( anymore ) . 
  yes the beginning can be extremely hard but it 's not that bad . 
  my best strategy so far has been to take out cimmeria asap . 
  i 'll get 14 armored horse archers and 5 ballistas . 
  then i 'll quickly steamroll them and get a nice little province with 3 harbours . 
  now i got food and income . 
  after that i 'll focus on getting the rest of my capital province , by force or confederacy . 
  then i 'll just do whatever i want . 
  afaik , if you give an attack order they 'll fire even if there are friendlies in the moshpit .
