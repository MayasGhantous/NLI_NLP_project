  at least i havent had much problem getting my archers to rain arrows on the enemies fighting my melee troops . 
  on the other hand , units that are just firing at will rarely fire if there are friendlies in the way . 
  imo this is a good thing . 
  a lot of the defense against range attacks come from the shield and that only works against attacks from the front . 
  as a result , the enemies had a better defense against your arrows than your own troops since they were usually facing the right direction and could block them while your own troops were hit in the back . 
  maybe they should increase the cost of agent actions ( and decrease the ais tendency to use them ) but also make them more effective . 
  should hopefully result in less spamming without really nerfing them . 
  added a missing word . 
  which is like the dumbest system ever . 
  if we take x % casualties then each units should take about x % casualties . 
  problem solved . 
  he could also quicksave when leaving so in case something happens he can just quickload and if nothing happens and he 's still just coasting towards his destination he did n't waste any time pausing the game . 
  for my military recruitment province as rome .

  * 20 % bonus to melee defense ( for infantry ) , armor and shields, 
  * 15 % bonus to charge,

  rank 8 heavy infantry straight from recruitment . 
  your champions will instead be used to keep the population happy in this mountain of squalor . 
  congratulations , your praetorians are now even more op . 
  this also works for most hellenistic factions . 
  pirate ships for the other faction combinations . 
  each `` pirate '' faction has one primary and one secondary `` race '' , the primary deciding stuff like weapon systems , sensor type , background color of the thumbnail etc etc. 
  so far we have minmatar/gallente ( angels ) , gallente/minmatar ( serpentis ) , caldari/gallente ( guristas ) , amarr/minmatar ( blood raiders ) , amarr/caldari ( sansha ) and soon amarr/gallente ( soe ) . 
  this leaves gallente/caldari , minmatar/amarr , minmatar/caldari caldari/amarr , caldari/minmatar and gallente/amarr . 
  i actually like it . 
  it 's easier to tell how much my population is growing and when i can upgrade my province unlike m2s ( havent played rome ) system where you had a big number and once that number became bigger than another unknown big number you could upgrade the city walls/fortress . 
  i did n't know if it would take 2 or 20 turns until i could upgrade my city , just that more growth and population = it would happen sooner . 
  in r2 i can quickly tell how much my population has grown , how fast it is growing and get a rough estimate of when i can get a new slot . 
  also , there was no city specialization needed in m2 , as long as you had the money and city level you could just build and upgrade everything . 
  it 's also better than s2s system where population was just ( afaik ) more income and building slots were tied to the level of your fortress ( city in fots ) . 
  it 's also muuuuuuuch better than empires damn system of cities that could have almost everything at the same time ( sometime you had to choose between two options and you were also limited by technology ) + a crapton of tiny tiny settlement popping up all over the world as the population grew . 
  damn i hated managing those . 
  and maybe to make shon and worf appear more badass . 
  well yeah ... worf did n't need the boost . 
  i guess he got the special power not to apepar more badass but simply because he is badass . 
  i hate how the middle `` nacell '' does n't match the other two `` nacells '' . 
  not a big deal but i prefer it when all my engines have the same color . 
  well if you 're flying an anti-proton beamboat then i guess there 's no reason to not use it , but otherwise , nah . 
  one thing i am concidering is getting a beam-bop with this weapon and a kcb in the aft and dbbs in the front . 
   and rocks picked off the field could also be used . 
  i wish this was an ammo option for slingers like the flame/noise/heavy options that javelin and archer units have . 
  less damage ( maybe no ap damage at all ) and accuracy but they wo n't consume ammo when firing . 
  bows are very useful as anti-morale weapons . 
  with their longer range and higher ammo count than javelins it 's easier to keep shooting at stuff and unlike slingers they have flame arrows . 
  there 's a morale penalty just from being under fire and an even bigger one for flame ammo . 
  combining a large salvo of flame arrows with a cavalry charge to the flank can win entire battles . 
   and maybe its just because i have to run it twice per character x 11, 
  i wish we had something like this . 
  after you 've completed an event with x characters you 'll get an account wide unlock , like maybe just the ship and not the warp core or beam array . 
  since people like us with a smaller legion of characters are probably very good and loyal customers this could be a nice reward during special events , especially for the more grindy ones like the summer and winter event . 
  or maybe they became [ pro-democracy anti-taliban fighters ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/conflict_in_afghanistan_%281978%e2%80%93present%29#anti-taliban_resistance ), 
  i think i might do it with my romulan main + a romulan bop . 
  ap weapons + the romulans insane crits should be a nice combo . 
  mixing cannons and beams is usually a bad idea except maybe on a science ship ( not enough tactical for weapons to matter much but agile enough to use turrets + dbb ) . 
  wait ... 
  1 fore weapon and 2 aft weapons ? 
  who designed these fighters !?!?!, 
  ( the same people who made [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/archer_%28tank_destroyer%29 ) thing ? ), 
  i would recommend berserkers and wodanas spears . 
  you get berserkers from the [ mead hall ] ( http://dsi0fanyw80ls.cloudfront.net/en/building/rom_barbarian_commons_public_4rom_barbarian ) and wodanaz spears from the [ grove of wodanaz ] ( http://dsi0fanyw80ls.cloudfront.net/en/building/rom_barbarian_religious_germanic_wodanaz_2rom_barbarian ) . 
  sounds kinda like you want a barbarian invasion dlc for r2 . 
  personally i think that they should a ) change the ai of certain factions , like rome , to make them more militaristic and expansionist . 
  b ) fix the quantity vs quality balance for autoresolve . 
  yes , i do this as rome all the time though not to this extent . 
  i 'm tempted to do it as sparta for the monument of leonidas to get some extra unroutable units . 
  edit : barbarians are also pretty good at stacking bonuses, 
  edit 2 : carthage has [ this ] ( http://dsi0fanyw80ls.cloudfront.net/en/building/rom_hellenic_temple_punic_tophet_5rom_hellenisticsc_rom_carthaginianrom_carthage ) building so if they built 3x temple of astarte , 1x precinct of astarte , 1x tophet and 2x training field buildings they should get a 75 % morale bonus on recruitment . 
  that should give sacred bands 122 in morale , before other bonuses . 
  any info on how armor actually works ? 
  does it reduce damage by a % ( eg , damage * 0,7 ) , or by units ( eg , damage - 20 ) ? 
  can it block damage completely ? 
  and how is melee defense vs melee attack calculated ? 
  and missiles vs shields . 
  [ give me information !, 
  ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_zsu5am3bkso/tkzqnt4tmwi/aaaaaaaabli/lrz3qxib29c/s1600/picture+4.jpg ), 
  sant, 
   so let 's say for rome it would take 7 or 8 turns to recruit legionnaires ( even longer for veterans and praetorians ), 
  [ the training took 6 months , not 7-8 years . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tirones ), 
   soccii hastati , who are basically a bunch of plebs who got fancy armor, 
  socii were just non-roman italians who fought for rome . 
  also , post-marian reform legionaries were also `` a bunch of plebs '' . 
   however i think a cap , similar to what we already have with berserkers and royal spartans seem a bit too `` gamey '', 
  exactly . 
  for me , the problem with limiting it by recruitment and upkeep cost is that you could either end up with a ) the unit becomes too expensive and wont be used ( i 'm looking at you , you bloody [ heavy tower octeres ] ( http://dsi0fanyw80ls.cloudfront.net/en/unit/egy_infantry_eight_dbl_hft ) ) . 
  b ) not doing anything except hurting our income a bit . 
  longer training time could work but personally i 'd rather wait a few more turns unless i 'm in a hurry . 
  you also have to concider the effect the tradition , general and agent have on an army . 
  since bonuses are % based , the better the unit the bigger the bonus becomes . 
  the `` xp per turn '' and upkeep reduction bonuses from champions and dignitaries is kinda wasted on a bunch of plebs . 
  and once a general has gained a few ranks you do n't want to waste a single slot in his army on cheap crap . 
  do frigates really out-dps fighters all the time ?
