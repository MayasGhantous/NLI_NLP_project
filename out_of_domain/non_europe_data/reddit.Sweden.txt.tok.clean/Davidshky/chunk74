  mmmmmmmmmaybe also playable vortas ( veteran reward ? ) . 
  a mix of playable cardassian and dominion ships , both old and new + maybe some `` hybrid '' ships the cardies and jhs designed together . 
  dominion reputation system !!!!, 
  help defend the alpha quadrant against the dominion onslaught . 
  sets and consoles and weapons and stuff . 
  gamma quadrant fleet outpost . 
  establish an outpost in the gamma quadrant . 
  more stuff !, 
  fleet bugship !, 
  ( not really though ), 
  well then you should just avoid discussions like this . 
  if you havent read the books and start reading a discussion about characters from the books then you 're not allowed to complain about spoilers . 
   their military is the equivalent of the modern day japan 's self defense forces . 
  my solution for this is that the cardassians have built new fleets in secret . 
  they could hide entire shipyards in the badlands and no one would notice . 
  and when it comes to their relationship with the federation , that could change , or maybe the federation is simply too busy with the borg , elachi , voth etc etc to send enough aid . 
  maybe this becomes another case of the feds and kdf working together like they seem to do all the time nowdays . 
  i 'm so gon na enjoy playing ( a fleshed out ) bactria . 
  a hellenistic faction surrounded by cavalry factions . 
  impaling all those easterners and steppe nomads on pikes is gon na be so very very satisfying . 
  a fleshed out odrysian kingdom ( currently their culture and temples dont match for example ) would be awesome . 
  imagine doing [ this ] ( http://imgur.com/a/enpwt ) ( 4x bronze furnace in one province ) with [ these ] ( http://dsi0fanyw80ls.cloudfront.net/en/unit/thr_nobles ) . 
  did i post that spoiler ? 
  you mean unlocked them by editing the . ini file . 
  for me , . ini has become the name for `` files i open with notepad to change a few lines of text in order to change stuff in games '' . 
  looks like batteries turned inwards . 
  imo , we should be able to recruit steppe spearmen from the bronze workship and steppe archers from the woodworker . 
  i also think that maybe they should add one new unique unit for each of the 3 factions . 
  like an armored archer for royal scythia , armored spearmen for roloxani and armored axemen for massagetae . 
  basically dismounted cav units and upgraded young axes . 
  the steppe nomads would still be stuck with crap infantry but at least they would have something . 
   the name j\u00e4germeister literally means `` master of hunters '' in german . 
  the word is an official government title for a high-ranking officer in charge of matters related to hunting . 
   the term j\u00e4germeister has existed as a job title for many centuries . 
  it was redefined in 1934 in the new reichsjagdgesetz ( imperial hunting law ) . 
  the term was applied to senior foresters and gamekeepers in the german civil service, 
  i thought it was a feature . 
   i was going to buy a excelsior class , duty officer pack and maybe a new bridge for the hell of it . 
  i 'd recommend against that . 
  before you know it you 'll reach the next rank and that ship will pretty much be completely useless . 
  wait until you reach level 50 and get tier 5 ship instead . 
  i think some of them only cost 2000 zen . 
  well then you could buy the [ tier 5 excelsior ] ( http://sto.gamepedia.com/advanced_heavy_cruiser_retrofit ) for 2000 zen . 
   pike armies just focus around waiting until the other force hits you . 
  well you can move your pike phalanx forward . 
  as long as they dont run they 'll keep their pikes down and impale any enemy who get in their way . 
  a moving pike phalanx with some archers and cav for support is almost like an unstoppable force . 
  i second this . 
  they also got access to [ royal peltasts ] ( http://dsi0fanyw80ls.cloudfront.net/en/unit/gre_royal_peltasts ) and some really good archers ( [ persian light archer ] ( http://dsi0fanyw80ls.cloudfront.net/en/unit/eas_persian_light_archers ) and [ syrian heavy archer ] ( http://dsi0fanyw80ls.cloudfront.net/en/unit/eas_syrian_heavy_archers ) ) . 
  i think the only thing the seleucids lack is a good mid-tier spear unit . 
  they got eastern spearmen , persian hoplites , thureos spears and shield bearers . 
  sure the middle two are decent but they dont have phalanx formation and kinda low morale ( 40 and 50 ) and stats in general compared to normal hoplites . 
  shogun 2 and the fall of the samurai dlc . 
  razing is the same . 
  barbarians just destroy it , civilized factions keep it . 
  for barbarians i guess the point of razing a city is to fuck with the owners while for civilized factions its just a way to get rid of unwanted buildings and resistance to invaders faster . 
  that 's probably an mg3 though .

  you get a bigger instant penalty ( -50 compared to -25 ) but the lasting penalty ( the one that goes down by 1 per turn ) is smaller . 
  i 'm 99 % sure you ca n't change the profession of your boffs but i do n't really see the problem here . 
  you can have 6 boffs ( more if you 're willing to spend zen/dil ) and the vast majority of ships do n't use more than 2 of any type of boffs . 
  so if you have 2 of each you should be able to use most ships without having to do much more than maybe visiting the boff trainer and changing some skills . 
  strange . 
  i remember one battle as parthia where i split my army in two groups and tried to attack from two different directions . 
  the ai responded by `` bending '' its line in the middle , forming a sort of v or h formation so that each half of its force faced half of mine . 
  personally i think the ai has become ( somewhat ) better at this compared to previous tw games where it could end up facing some imaginary `` middle point '' of your army if you split your forces . 
  [ subscription ? 
  ] ( http://sto.gamepedia.com/bridge_officer_slot ), 
  i think they should swap the building requirements for the scorpion and the ballista . 
  i mean , the scorpion should ( afaik ) be much easier to build . 
  it would also give us a reason to build siege buildings . 
  i think they should divide infantry into even more `` classes '' . 
  assault infantry . 
  this would be legionaires , egyptian infantry and other units that throw spears when charging . 
  no changes really , i just think it should be easier to tell if a unit will throw spears or not . 
  like javelin units , but with less ammo ( lets say 3-4 ish ) , decent/good melee stats and melee infantry sized units . 
  they would have skirmish mode and fire-at-will like range units but are in the end actually melee units . 
  would also throw spears when charging . 
  this could be units like thureos spears , light hoplites , ( maybe ) royal peltasts and other `` lighter '' spear throwing melee units . 
  like a middle ground between peltasts and normal infantry . 
  where ? 
  i tired talking to the guy on ds9 but he was still only giving free nukara rep stuff . 
  edit : it 's on drozana station . 
  edit 2 : [ looks pretty nice on the adapted bc and the bortas ] ( http://imgur.com/a/jop7w ), 
  if you 're patient you can even run lvl 4 missions with one . 
  iirc , in m2 we actually had 2 years per turn , but characters aged 0,5 years and the seasons changed . 
  is this some sort of limited reward ship or are we finally getting t2 shuttles ? 
  fly faster ? 
  something that 's better than a normal shuttle but more disposable than a t2 frigate . 
   anyway , stories aside . 
  i clearly need to buy a beefier ship , what class should i look at next ?
