  so if a creature is covered in spikes and claws and death and shit , odds are that its a scary carnivore that will attack you , but unless every single bodypart had a modifier of 1.0 there would be a small chance that its peaceful . 
  also , agressive creatures should attack other creatures once in a while . 
  that way we could kinda tell if something is agressive or not by observing its behavior . 
  i also think there should be less types of creatures per planet . 
  its kinda annoying when new creatures appear from nowhere every few minutes only to pretty much never appear again . 
  instead i think there should be variants of each creaute . 
  like young , adult , male , female , alpha etc. 
  with different sizes , stats and maybe behavior . 
  this could also create more variation between planets since each one would have a limited but more unique fauna, 
  a stratios could also work , but concidering their high cost , would n't a t3 cruiser be better ? 
  all you really need to do is travel around a lot , preferably in low populated areas and make sure your scanner show anomalies , then check the list of anoms for ghost sites . 
  the jupiter could make a good carrier with frigate pets ( mirandas ? ), 
  for the feds . 
  big and slow and that fat belly would make a good hangar bay . 
  looks like a relative to the one electronic from the webcomic rice boy . 
  they could make it even fatter ( it would probably need a new model anyway ) to make room for a miranda-bay . 
   but i do n't think they can fix the ugly . 
  i never said they should , but the model is kinda old . 
  this is completely normal . 
  you get a free ship every 10 levels up to level 40 and you get to choose between a battlecruiser , a raptor and a bird of prey ( more options at lvl 40 ) . 
  you mean like the pixel compressor ? 
  or do you mean a bank where you can get a loan ? 
   these bombs then launch a bomb that has no vector and sits ontop of the ship . 
  huh ? 
  i thought bombs always flew 30km before exploding . 
  exactly . 
  just because something was overpowered for a while in ps1 does n't mean it should never be added to ps2 . 
  personally i think they should change the role of bfrs . 
  lets say they could get the role of `` light/medium all-terrain fire support '' or something rather than `` heavy armored pew-pew behemoth '' . 
  their advantage should be mobility and jump-jets , enabling them to reach places most vehicles ca n't and outmaneuver their enemies . 
  their weakness should be speed , health and size . 
  same/lower speed than mbts , similar health to lightnings and much taller than both , making them kinda easy to hit . 
  think at-st in star wars , or like a slower jenner from mechwarrior . 
  i like the sword and hammer , but an aa melee weapon ... 
   also do something like this for maxs . 
  everyone should have melee weapons, 
  give maxs melee weapons and shields as two separate `` weapons '' ( also , give nc a new max ability ) and give normal infantry swords as a secondary weapon option . 
   but i want it to be able to survive for constant shelling for a some time, 
  i think mbts should kinda fill that role . 
  increase the health/armor of tanks by ... a lot and add the ability to both slow and immobilize them by hitting the tracks/hoverthingies and engine . 
  they would be much harder to kill in terms of how much firepower you would need , but if for example they drive into a group of infantry or get ambushed they would end up unable to escape , pummeled with rockets and covered in c4 in no time . 
  the magrider could have some sort of resistance to it , lets say a backup hover thingy so it can still kinda turn and move when damaged but much much slower . 
  maybe at mines , at-grenades and c4 could have a bonus to immobilization . 
  i agree that lock-down prowlers could be a problem with that , but i still want mobility kills . 
  i think tanks are both too fragile and too durable at the same time . 
  they melt when under any serious firepower but if they can run away or just retreat behind cover and repair , they can take a million at rockets , as long as its just a few at a time . 
  and i also want a heavy vehicle . 
  something big , fat and slow with a lot of guns . 
  like a nanite system baneblade ripoff . 
  i expected something honor-tanked ... 
  can we do this with the unmanned probe modules ? 
  could i make some sort of `` science retrieval probe '' that just stores a bunch of science and flies back to kerbin ? 
  like if i have a rover/base/ship with a science lab , do a lot of experiments , load them into a tiny probe and launch it back to kerbin . 
  well the probe modules are computers so imo they should have some storage space . 
  good point . 
  maybe they could add some sort of small storage module in the future that we can put a limited ( like 10 ish ? ), 
  amount of experiments in . 
  basically i just want [ rocket mail ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rocket_mail ) in the form of small science delivery probes . 
  imo , start by getting a mirror science vessel from the exchange and mess around with it for a while . 
  also , if you have a lvl 50 kdf character without a battlecruiser , get a mirror vorcha from the exchange and put dual heavy cannons and turrets on it . 
  this should give you a general idea of what its like flying a science vessel and a dhc battlecruiser before you spend any zen . 
  i think they 've talked about adding more small-craft content . 
  personally i want stuff like this, 
  * small-craft only pvp , with team deathmatch and a gamemode ( similar to the one in world of warplanes ) where the objective is to destroy some sattelites/ships/stuff belonging to the enemy team . 
  * small-craft only fleet actions that does n't suck and give decent rewards . 
  * more kdf small-crafts . 
  orion slaver shuttle , orion interceptor and marauding force runabout . 
  plenty of countries would most likely have bent over for the nazis if given the option . 
  denmark , norway , belgium , the netherlands and luxemburg all declared neutrality and if they had n't been invaded they would probably have acted just as we did . 
  besides , since norway , denmark and france had all fallen and finland was kinda allied with the germans , and the germans controlled the baltics , we did n't really have that many options when it came to trading partners and we could have been invaded from pretty much every directions if the germans wanted to . 
  so trading iron in exchange for food and coal + not ending up like denmark was a pretty sweet deal . 
  but at the same time we leased our 8000 sailors outside the baltics to britain , spied on germany for the allies , saved a bunch of jews , leaked intel about the battleship bismarck , resulting in its destruction , helped the norwegian resistance movement and planned an operation to liberate denmark . 
  also , back then germany was n't really concidered evil incarnate so it 's not like ww2 was a war between good and evil , especially not with the soviet union , our 2nd biggest enemy , on the allied side . 
   wherever money is , our tongue will surely be there as well . 
  you mean like the rest of the world . 
  because to steam , having the launcher open = playing the game . 
  so if you forget to turn it off after you stop playing , steam will still think you 're playing . 
  i kinda like frigates so i would say an electronic attack ship , some sort of tackle and something with dps . 
  like a sentinel to td and neut , maybe a taranis/ishkur/vengeance / dramiel/daredevil ( so many options ) for tackle and extra dps and then something with enough dps to kill whatever you 're hunting . 
  though as i said , i like frigates so i 'm kinda biased . 
  or you could get something hull-tanked and get some extra manly lossmails . 
   and not regular joes . 
  but ... 
   a team composed of a technician and five ** conscripts **, 
   faw is far from fixed . 
  they are just fixing the fast power regen , seen as no weapons drain , without putting back in accuracy overflow into crit . 
  a fix is still a fix even if it does n't solve every problem . 
  unless ofc it makes a new problem . 
  well the way i read it they mean that 1 trained technician and 5 conscripts with basic training can do it as long as they follow his instructions . 
  the fact that they pointed out the team has 1 technician kinda implies that the other 5 are not . 
  1 technician and 5 conscripts with several months of training as flight-mechanics just kinda turns into 6 trained flight-mechanics . 
   what i want is a field of view ** setting ** , both for single player and when hosting a server, 
  ie , it should be optional . 
  indeed . 
  my friend got the tier 10 armor and he can fly all the way to space by tapping the key . 
  exactly . 
  lets say you launch the game ( and thus the launcher ) at 5pm and play until 7pm but forget to shut down the launcher until 10pm . 
  even though you only played for 2 hours , steam will think you played for 5 . 
  personally i prefer the ability to adjust the difficulty through different settings rather than having to choose between easy , medium and hard or something like that . 
  pros : more tactical boff layout , more weapon power , comes with the wide angle quantum torp ( almost worth the zen just for this ) and the meteron gas canister ( can only be used by assault cruisers though ) and will give you a discount on the fleet assault cruiser .
