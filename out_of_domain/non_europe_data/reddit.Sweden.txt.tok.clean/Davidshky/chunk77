  depends, 
  the main advantage of the waq-torp is that it has a 180 degree arc of fire , so you can use it while broadsiding with your beam arrays . 
  on the other hand it has lower dps than a normal quantum torp but it usually makes up for it by being able to fire more often . 
  maybe it was a boolean or ? 
  i just got ta ask , what 's the total bonus from all those implants and what kinda of stats do your probes get ? 
  pretty much killing pirate npcs ( aka , rats ) outside missions for their bounty and loot . 
  i guess the kdf romulans could get a special skin if they get a d7 . 
  i think it 's because no one is gon na fight a curse unless they outnumber it ten to one or something . 
  well they have the best slingers of all the barbarians and they can [ stack builders halls and temples for a 100 % range damage bonus . 
  ] ( http://imgur.com/a/xqci4 ) ( pictures are kinda old so the stats are outdated ), 
  they have briton skirmishers with javelins , though they 're so shitty they should probably just be ignored . 
   but 20 mil ec is n't hard for me to gather either . 
  so maybe i 'll do that instead . 
  this is probably the best option . 
  it 's better to save the lobis for stuff that you ca n't get on the exchange , like everything that 's `` bind on pickup '' . 
  knossos symbol is the labyrinth of knossos where king minos put the minotaur . 
  do you have a flag ? 
   i 'm just wondering if its a part of the difficulty setting to create the challenge or is the computer down right cheating to prolong the inevitable, 
  yes to both . 
  the ai in most strategy games , including total war games , has to cheat to have a chance and the higher the difficulty , the more cheaty it gets . 
  i think the ai get more money , food , public order and pretty much everything else . 
  i 've also heard it has a bonus to agent actions which would explain why i have to replace the general of an army every turn for 30 turns in a major war . 
  edit : [ found some old and possibly outdated info about bonuses and penalties from difficulty settings .
