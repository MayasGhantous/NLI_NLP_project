   base damage reduction increased from 15 % to 25 %, 
   base encumbrance penalty reduced from 60 % to 50 %, 
   base melee damage return increased from 75 % to 100 %, 
   evolution 4 melee damage return bonus increased from 75 % to 150 %, 
   melee damage return cap increased from 1000 to 2000, 
  now i want to go and fight phantoms as bat soldier . 
  if a phantom hits me she should lose most of her barrier and probably be staggered . 
  not sure , but with 250 % damage return i 'm pretty sure she 'll reach the 2000 damage cap . 
  my theory is that santorum was an undercover democrat sent in to take out the gop from the inside . 
  this kills the grenoble . 
  but it does kill grenoble as well so i 'm still technically correct . 
  i 'm not so sure about that . 
  you see several smaller ships that look like smaller versions of the collector ships in me3 . 
  edit : nvm , apparently those were just oculus . 
  just image atlases , primes , ravagers and banshees at the same time . 
  banshees forces you out of cover and the rest turns your body into a red mist . 
  my geth engineer will love this objective . 
  healing turret is my one of my favorite powers for pizza delivery and should be just as good for this . 
  indeed . 
  if they do that i might be able to forgive them for doreah . 
  because sentinel seems to have been changed to `` tanky caster class '' . 
  rather than tech + biotic class . 
  i want to try out a team of just demolishers . 
  4 supply pylons and a fuckton of grenades . 
  killstreaks everywhere . 
  oh yes . 
  4 demolishers , 3 with harriers and one with a falcon . 
  death and tech burts everywhere . 
  i think bioware has simply changed sentinel to `` caster with tank ability '' rather than the old , `` caster with biotics and tech '' . 
  i see it as a good thing since it allows bioware to be more creative when making classes . 
  maybe now i can get my geth sentinel without a horde of lore fanboys pointing out how impossible it should be . 
  i 'm a big fan of [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/mecoop/comments/v0959/idea_for_new_enemies_split_each_faction_into/ ) idea . 
  i would also like to see mercs and collectors , maybe a faction of me2 style mechs . 
  mercs would be very slow and methodical , staying at a distance and throwing grenades , with the exception of the bloodpact units who would be a lot more agressive and try to get into melee/flamer/shotgun range . 
  collectors would be ... like the me2 collectors . 
  the mechs would be slow and ignore cover . 
  should use tons of loki mechs that just walk towards you and shoot . 
  ymir mechs could have their rocket launcher replaced by a flamethrower to make them less similar to atlases and make them extremely dangerous at close/medium range . 
  fenris mechs should be the mech factions main way of getting players out of cover . 
  they should be very mobile and capable of leaping over cover faster than any other enemy . 
  should also explode a few seconds after death dealing similar damage to a grenade . 
  then add some new mechs to cover some other niches and you 'd have a new faction . 
  or you could watch the series in the [ machete order ] ( http://static.nomachetejuggling.com/machete_order.html ) ignoring episode 1 completely . 
  i would like something scout related . 
  a unique scout or just a bonus to scouts . 
  i think you all accidentally a legen . 
  exactly the same problem here . 
  if i search for a/a/a i find a lobby in a few seconds but anything else and i wo n't find anything at all . 
  i 've also been disconnected 3 times since yesterday which is more than the last 3 months combined . 
  edit : was actually right now able to find a game by searching a/a/g . 
  saw an update by bioware on bsn about fixing the matchmaking so i restarted origin and updated me3 and was then able to find a game . 
  edit 2 : was now able to find a fbw/g/g game so i guess the matchmaking is fixed . 
  i 'm guessing no since that would make the acolyte even more useless . 
  i agree completely . 
  with some minor buffs and ulm v i can really imagine it as a popular backup weapon against cerberus and geth . 
  was gon na ask the same thing . 
  i 've lashed both primes and atlases with horrifying results . 
  hunters . 
  bloody cheating hunters . 
  first i stagger him , he does n't give a shit . 
  then he staggers me , i lose all my shields . 
  then i die . 
  could i get one that 's mako related ?

  [ the finns were good but not that good . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/winter_war ), 
  heat sing gives each shot a 45 % chance of not being used meaning that your total ammo per mag is magazine size/0 .55 which is on average an 81 % increase , so the heatsink will on average give you a little more ammo per mag . 
  -10000 karma , i 'm impressed . 
  because 55 % is 100 % minus 45 % . 
  and 55 % = 0.55, 
  because that 's how math works . 
  lets get very basic . 
  replace shots with apples and ammo with money . 
  lets say each apple costs 1 dollar and you have 40 dollars . 
  that mean you can buy 40 apples . 
  if we now have a 50 % price reduction on apples you can buy twice as many apples . 
  because 40/0 .5 = 40 / ( 1/2 ) = 40 * 2, 
  with a 45 % price reduction this means that you can buy 40 / ( 1 - 0.45 ) = 40/0 .55 = 40 / ( 11/20 ) = 40 * ( 20/11 ) = 72.72 apples . 
  72.72 / 40 = 1.81 which means that a 45 % price reduction means you can buy about 81 % more apples . 
  you mean dead ash . 
  if you are a player , you are likely to be shot on site regardless . 
  tell that to my character who starved to death after visiting the airfield and looting the barracks . 
  visited pretty much all of vybor and all i found were 7 czech backpacks . 
  well if you go there again . 
  bring plent of food . 
  i 've been in the area again and it 's almost impossible to find any . 
   having a 2.5 second heal, 
  irrc , the turret , when specced with restore frequency , recharge shields about once every 5 seconds . 
  well unlike the other shotguns the reegar has a finite range of just a few meters so you have to be close to hit anything at all . 
  it 's best used with vanguards , infintrators , vorchas and any other short range class . 
  it also does n't benefit from the smart choke at all so you 're better off using some other mod . 
  i prefer extra ammo and armor piercing . 
  the first is because the spare ammo is ridiculously low and the latter because it does very low damage to armor without it . 
  just get close and you should cut through enemies like a hot knife through butter . 
  other than that i ca n't really think of much to say . 
  the wiki says 5.6 seconds but i think it should recharge every 5 seconds . 
  it has an 8 second delay between heals as standard which is 7.5 heals per minute . 
  a 60 % increase would be 7.5 * 1.6 = 12 heals per minute which would mean it heals every 5 seconds . 
  though i guess there 's a .6 second extra delay due to the healing animation or something . 
  exactly .
