  like a tiny flying repair tool that you throw like a grenade . 
  it would then target nearby friendly vehicles and ( slowly ) repair them until it 's destroyed or the battery runs out . 
   fuel & food are non-issues . 
  right off the bat you can produce trees and hunt food easily enough . 
  which is exactly why it might as well be optional . 
   pvp ?!, 
  how would you have that work ? 
  server setting, 
   beam down from ship on a permadeath char !? 
  well then do n't enable it if you 're also gon na play with permadeath . 
   do you really want to make this part further difficult ?!? 
  what kind of argument is that ? 
  maybe i want to make the game more difficult but does n't like `` item drop '' or permadeath mode . 
  in the character editor , it appears that the base fertility is 50 % , whatever that means . 
  the wiki also says that the fertility of both parents are taken into account . 
  my extremely uneducated guess is that it works something like this, 
  fathers fertility * mothers fertility * x = % chance the mother gets pregnant each day/month/year . 
  so something like 0.5 * 0.5 * x = 0,25 x % chance of pregnancy, 
  i think we should get a sniper rifle with a charge mechanism . 
  uncharged it would do about the same damage as a semi-auto sniper and fully charged the same as a bolt-action sniper . 
  it would have a battery size of 100 , but each shot would cost between 10 and 20 ammo ( ish ) depending on how charged it is . 
  edit : more ideas, 
  lasher sniper ? 
  a sniper rifle with some aoe so we can annoy more enemies per shot . 
  laser beam rifle . 
  super duper accurate , no drop , no recoil , insane `` bullet velocity '' , high `` rof '' ( it 's a continuous beam ) and low dps . 
  bzzzzzzzzzzzzt !, 
  dot sniper . 
  unstable plasma projectiles causing burn damage over time but less instant damage and maybe has lower bullet velocity . 
  anti-shield sniper . 
  does more damage to shields but less damage to health . 
  would possibly slow down the targets shield recharge for a while . 
  best used as a support weapon . 
   they all play pretty much identically these days . 
  indeed , except when it comes to mbts , has and maxs . 
  i know a lot of people hate it but imo a charge up mechanism would probably work very well for sniper rifles . 
  tbh , i think we could use more charge up weapons ( do n't shoot me yet ) but in the form of attachments/ammo or a firing mode added to some existing weapons instead of being the devs go-to choice for vanu es weapons . 
  well obviously it would have to have some drawbacks . 
  it could be like the worst semi-auto and bolt-action sniper in one weapon . 
  well that 's the problem with large fleets . 
  i mean , i 'm in a somewhat small fleet with around 10 active members and we 're almost never short on fleet marks . 
  start as bj\u00f6rn ironside , form the kingdom of svitjod/sweden , turn gotland and/or austergautland into a vassal republic , save , resign and play as a viking merchant republic . 
  then try to aquire a wife and 3 concubines with good traits or just go for max fertility . 
  then just breed , raid and conquer . 
  `` they '' are already there , just look to the northeast . 
   or care about who owns the territory, 
  what about a one way lattice connection . 
  owning a real base nearby would allow you to capture the mini bases but not vice versa . 
  i also have some other ideas for other bases, 
  * firebase : a couple of phalanx turrets and some cover . 
  * jump-station : some jump pads on a platform that would provide alternate attack routes . 
  * tunnel control : a small base that controls the doorway shields to some tunnels . 
  * radar station : simply a proximity radar with long-ish range . 
  here are some very non-serious ideas, 
  * shrapnel sniper : fires small airburst [ shrapnel shells ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shrapnel_shell ) . 
  low rof , very high potential damage . 
  you would ( somehow ) be able to set the detonation distance when aiming . 
  tada , shotgun sniper !, 
  * [ tit ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tit_%28bird%29 ) missile rifle : the ncm3 raven in the form of a sniper rifle . 
  laser-guided rocket-propelled bullets that makes a similar sound to the ravens missiles . 
  * dual barrel bolt action sniper : fired two bullets at the same time , twice as many as any other bolt action rifle . 
  problem is that it 's not very accurate and the bullets are the same as those used by semi-auto snipers . 
  * belt fed rifle : reloading is a thing of the past . 
  now all your ammo is in one long belt so you never have to change magazine . 
  while it might be kinda heavy and prone to jamming the overall increased rof should be worth it . 
  i think we should start reminding higby about [ this old post ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/planetside/comments/1apgor/account_wide_unlock_faq/c8zn0f7 ) more often . 
  if i got the empire specific equivalent of all my sc weapon purchases i might actually be willing to spend money again . 
  i want something similar and have an [ old thread about it ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/planetside/comments/1dcnud/idea_phantasm_gunship/ ), 
  i mean , afaik most ps1 vehicles will eventually be added to ps2 some way or another and personally i think the phantasm would make a great `` helicopter gunship '' . 
  i kinda think that the defense slot on most vehicle should be turned into a second utility slot . 
  maybe some certs would be mutually exclusive in case they are too op when combined ( nano regen + fire supression ? ), 
  but that in most cases we should be able to mix defense and utility certs as we wish . 
  i also have some ideas for attachments, 
  ** all factions **, 
  * extended barrel : better accuracy but worse handling . 
  kinda boring but oh well . 
  * bayonet : a rail attachment that increases the damage and range of your melee attack . 
  * charge adapter : a rail attachment that would enable you to charge your shots when using semi-auto . 
  a fully charged shot would do 2x damage and have a higher velocity but would consume 3 ammo and have a higher recoil . 
  * incendiary plasma ammo : unstable plasma projectiles that have a softer impact but would continue to burn on/inside the target for a while . 
  increased total damage from dot but lower instant damage and lower velocity and/or increased damage falloff . 
  * stun rounds : militarized version of crowd control ammo . 
  causes the target to flinch more but has lower damage and/or velocity . 
  * [ jungle style magazine ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jungle_style ) ( rail attachment ) : every second reload is much faster and the others are slightly slower . 
  * scavenger ammo adapter : a weapon modification created in the early rebellion that enables your gun to use many different kinds of ammo . 
  every shot could be anything from a pistol to an br bullet . 
  the result is that the damage , recoil , velocity etc etc is very random , but the overall effectiveness of the gun should be kinda increased . 
  * shot/bullet hybrid ammo : every shot would fire one normal accurate but weaker bullet and a few tiny shotgun pellets . 
  iirc , higby have said ( like a year ago , i 'll try to find it ) that the medic is supposed to be the best general anti-infantry class . 
  think of them as medium assaults with healing capabilities . 
  personally i hope they 'll add the [ phantasm ] ( http://wiki.planetsidesyndicate.com/index.php?title=phantasm ) as a light transport . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/planetside/comments/1dcnud/idea_phantasm_gunship/ ) is an old thread of mine with some ideas . 
  we need anti-coward painfields . 
  stay in spawn too long and you 'll die . 
  lets say tr invented this because putting a commissar in every spawn room just was n't viable . 
  nc and vs then adopted this idea while officially blaming tr for sabotage . 
  in that scenario you should spawn somewhere else . 
  yeah , it should probably only activate if the base is under attack or maybe only if the attackers are winning . 
  imo , spawncamping is a symptom of a problem . 
  even though the attackers have won , the defenders are still able to spawn until the timer reaches 0 .
