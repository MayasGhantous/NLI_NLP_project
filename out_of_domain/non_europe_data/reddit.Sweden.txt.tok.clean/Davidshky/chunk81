  this forces the defenders to camp the spawn to prevent any futile counter-attacks . 
  imo they should put scus right outside the spawnrooms and make them vulnerable once the base capture reaches a certain point . 
  if the defenders ca n't get like 10 meters from the spawn in 1-2 minutes to defend/defuse the scu they do n't deserve to spawn there anymore . 
  i 'm 99 % sure they have stated multiple times they 're gon na change the resource system `` soon '' . 
  for example i recall them saying they 'll remove the different resource types so people wo n't be sitting on resources they do n't need/want while being low on the one they do need/want . 
  only the `` 1 % chance to strip a bonus proc '' bonus is exclusive to the galor and jh ships . 
  * ** 1 ** : continental lattice and locking . 
  * ** 2 ** : tank changes . 
  enable mobility kills but buff all tanks hp/armor a lot . 
  * ** 3 ** : account wide unlock of equivalent es-weapons as mentioned [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/planetside/comments/1apgor/account_wide_unlock_faq/c8zn0f7 ) . 
  * ** 4 ** : [ phantasm gunship/transport ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/planetside/comments/1dcnud/idea_phantasm_gunship/ ), 
  * ** 5 ** : resource revamp, 
  agreed , but it 's hard to come up with stuff when tr is pretty much just `` more dakka , red goes fastah ! '', 
  not instant death , just damage and one hell of a reloading problem . 
   i advise against support tools on mbts . 
  that fits the sunderer mo , but not mbts ' . 
  well the inspiration for it was [ ww2 infantry tanks ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/infantry_tank ) that were kinda used as slow infantry support and mobile cover . 
  maybe it would work better for the collossus if we ever get it . 
   jamming mechanics are not a good thing , especially random jamming mechanics . 
  yeah , i just had a hard time coming up with a drawback . 
   the ability sounds fine , but ally immunity does not . 
  well they should at least be resistant . 
  it should be like a giant lasher and if allies werent resistant/immune it could be a nightmare to use . 
   if you 're running out of ideas for tr , consider passive abilities, 
  maybe some sort of command tank ability . 
  tr is supposed to be the most organized faction so a command vehicle would kinda fit them . 
  not sure what it should do though . 
  a passive buff to nearby allied vehicles ? 
  a directional scanner that automatically spots enemies where you aim ? 
  propaganda speakers that plays inspirational music/speeches ? 
   rumble seats, 
  imo this should be avaliable for all factions . 
  well with the esfs you use them to switch between your main and secondary weapon . 
   and the max melee weapons, 
  not just that but also swords as new secondary weapons for normal infantry and bayonets as new rail attachments . 
  when it comes to race , unless you 're a powergamer it does n't really matter . 
  if you 're a trekkie , just pick your favorite race or something . 
  when it comes to classes, 
  for space combat , tactical for damage , engineering for tanking and science for spacemagic . 
  for ground combat , tactical for buffs , stealth and grenades , engineering for summons , debuffs and explosives and science for immortality ( medic kit ftw ) and more magic . 
   the show does n't have an ongoing plot so you could start anywhere you want . 
  i think the most common recommendation is start of season 3 . 
  well as bimonscificon and pgrily have pointed out , there are some episodes in the first two seasons you should watch since they 're part of some long story arcs . 
  does indirect kills count ? 
  a few years ago me and some friends had joined a new corp in fatal ascension and moved into 0.0 for the first time . 
  even though we were a bunch of cowardly nullbears some of us had very little regard for our own safety or kb effeciency . 
  then one day the intel chat went insane because a somewhat large hostile gang ( 40 ish ) had arrived in d2-hos ( the system right next to our hps5-c and inhabited by our `` friends '' fidelas constans ) and were camping the station . 
  as usual everyone followed the standard procedure and docked up . 
  me on the other hand being the dumbass i am jumped into my purifier and went to take a look . 
  two f-con carriers were outside the station spamming drones at the attackers while the rest hid in the station . 
  after talking to some corpmates the three of us decided to attempt a hit-and-run attack ( we were bored ) and after having a conversation with an alliance director ( who probably did n't understand wtf we were doing ) we jumped into d2-hos and to our glorious deaths . 
  i dropped a bomb , realized how stupid this idea was and warped away while my friends who had even less of a clue what they were doing ( an abaddon is not a good hit-and-run ship ) were blown up . 
  now the interesting part begins . 
  apparently the f-con guys saw our three man kamikaze group and thought we were reinforcements from fa ... and undocked ... 
  even though i got a lot of shit for it i still giggle at the thought of how us three carebears managed to get a bunch of f-con lemmings skilled and directors in both alliances in a bad mood . 
  i second the h-v45 though personally i do n't think it 's the greatest gun to ads . 
  it has the smallest cof when fired from the hip of all vs assault rifles and it has access to the advanced laser sight attachment ( which afaik reduces the cof by 50 % ) . 
  when combined you can just run-and-gun in cqc . 
  add some soft-point ammo to that and you 're a short/medium range murder machine . 
   make it more of a plane than a helicopter on steroids . 
  imo they should try reducing the hp of esfs in exchange for increased speed and some way to dodge lock-ons with `` skill '' . 
  maybe they should make a second test server for stuff like this . 
   speedy tank great for blitzing , but our ability makes us immobile . 
  tr have speed and rof as your main traits and the anchor ability simply trades one for the other . 
  i agree about the max though . 
  imo , each faction should get a new max ai weapon . 
  * vs should get a lasher/ppa type weapon . 
  we have this as our ha es weapon and as our anti-infantry weapon on the magrider , harrasser and scythe but for some reason we have a pew-pew-pew thingy as our max gun . 
  * nc should get a hmg . 
  they already have their faction gimmick as their max gun so they could get something like an m2 browning ( murica ) . 
  * tr should get a proper chaingun . 
  something with an insane rof but also some drawbacks like spin-up time , firing delay , low accuracy or something like that . 
  when firing it should go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrt !, 
  instead of dakka-dakka-dakka . 
  sounds like a pretty interesting idea for some sort of fantasy mod . 
  a two layer map with very limited access between them but also some way to build new passages . 
  instead of using ships to cross the ocean you could dig downwards , conquer your way to the other side and build a huge staircase right beneath the enemy capital . 
  like humans , elves , orcs and stuff on the surface and dwarves , kobolds and mole people beneath . 
  i have a somewhat similar idea . 
  the flash is ( afaik ) the only vehicle in the game that starts with an empty weapon slot . 
  my suggestion is a sort of shield generator for the weapon slot that would create a shield-bubble around the driver or the entire flash , with about 500 hp . 
  so a weapon and the shield would be mutually exclusive but it would give us something for that slot by default , similar to the esfs ab-tanks . 
  imo , the main problem with this idea is that `` soon \u2122 '' they 'll add the continental lattice which ( afaik ) will make most wgs capturable . 
  this removes the whole `` push to wg but no further '' problem you mentioned unless one faction achieve total victory or something . 
  maybe they should turn the capturable wgs into something like this . 
  the current ones pretty much just rely on the `` do not enter zone '' as their main defense . 
  they could turn the capturable wgs into giant citadels with defensive structures everywhere , tunnel networks , pillboxes and trenches . 
  maybe even some ai-phalanx turrets in decent positions . 
  my favorite thing about it is that you can easily make it match the color of your weapons . 
  same here . 
  another thing that bothers me is that [ higby kinda said ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/planetside/comments/1apgor/account_wide_unlock_faq/c8zn0f7 ) we would eventually get account wide unlocks of equivalent weapons for the different factions . 
  now it 's been 10 months and i havent heard anything more about it . 
  the reason why this bothers me is that currently i kinda feel stuck as vs due to my purchases . 
  i can live with starting from scratch when it comes to certs , but getting decent weapons for tr or nc means i either have to grind a lot of certs or spend even more money on overpriced weapons which i 'm simply not willing to do . 
  well that sounds pretty damn boring . 
  the wgs should be like a boss battle at the end of the level . 
  oh god , a sniper mana turret for infiltrators !, 
  they 're the most interesting part of this lock-box for me . 
  the possibility of a cheap negh ` var with a non-sucky boff layout , a cheap t5 heavy cruiser and the super-mega-awesome romulan mirror skin for my dhelans . 
  the [ schmidt scout ] ( http://counterstrike.wikia.com/wiki/schmidt_scout ) from counter-strike ( though with a new name and model ) .
