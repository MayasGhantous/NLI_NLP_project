  a bolt-action sniper that for some reason makes you move faster . 
  since one of trs main traits is speed , this would be perfect for them . 
  imo , one of the main problem with infantry vs vehicles is that infantry without av/aa capabilities can very easily resupply/respawn as something that does . 
  kill a squad of infiltrators with your mbt , get killed by a squad of annoyed has appearing from the nearest spawn . 
  i know that i have a tendency to respawn as the counter to whatever just killed me . 
  killed by a tank ? 
  hades time !, 
  killed by an esf/lib ? 
  nemesis time !, 
  killed by an infiltrator ? 
  countersniper time !, 
  then once the `` threat '' has been dealt with i just switch back to whatever i actually want to play while the tanker/pilot will have to do something else while waiting for the timer . 
  in ps1 you could only re-cert one cert every 6 hours , so changing `` class '' could take days . 
  in ps2 it takes a few seconds . 
  imo , instead of changing a2b in any way they should make aux power more useful for non-science ships . 
  aux power is mostly useless for cruisers , escorts etc so the drawbacks from a2b is pretty damn insignificant compared to the bonuses to boff power cooldown and weapon/shield/engine power . 
  because finland and germany were allies vs the soviet union so finland got a lot of free stuff . 
  with the advanced laser sight and soft point ammo ( how ? ), 
  it 's a short/medium range beast . 
  best rof and hipfire accuracy of all the vs assault rifles . 
  and though i sometimes wish i could use it with more classes , i ca n't really complain since the medic is ( imo ) the best anti-infantry class overall . 
  giving the whole overpop faction a penalty is kinda unfair to the individuals unless they can actually do something about it without losing all their progress . 
  * allow the members of an overpopulated faction to join another server with their character . 
  * give new characters who join a very underpopulated faction a nice bonus , like a character bound 7 day xp boost . 
  * prevent people from joining the overpopulated factions . 
  i also think we should get account wide unlocks of equivalent empire specific weapons as kinda somewhat maybe promised by higby [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/planetside/comments/1apgor/account_wide_unlock_faq/c8zn0f7 ) . 
  that way people who have spent a lot of sc on empire specific weapons could join another faction and only have to start from scratch when it comes to stuff they got with certs . 
  well actually i agree that the overpopulated faction should be punished as long as they can do something about it . 
  it would really suck to get a big penalty of some sort because your faction is overpopulated and only have the options of living with the penalty or start over as br1 . 
  the incentive of joining another server/faction must be bigger than the penalty . 
  if i had to choose between a 75 % xp penalty or starting over as br1 without all the vs weapons i 've bought with sc , i would pick the former or stop playing . 
  agreed . 
  i 've even suggested this myself . 
  though there should be some limit , like the scu only becomes vulnerable when the capture timer reach a certain point or something like that . 
  last time i checked www.soe.com still worked so try that . 
  imo , they should remove the difference between utility and defense certs on all vehicles and just give us two whateverthefuckyouwant slots . 
  but they should also make some certs mutually exclusive in case some combos would be too overpowered . 
   1 ) no knifing while sword is out, 
  the sword should probably replace the knife as well so yeah . 
   2 ) sword ohkos when hitting from behind, 
  this would make infiltrators and las kinda op . 
  the thought behind the melee charge idea was that it would give the target some warning while still enabling melee ohks . 
   3 ) sword hit is nullified if it is used at the same time as your enemy 's sword . 
  maybe secondary fire should be block ? 
   4 ) pulling it out makes a noise . 
  maybe the sword should make noises all the time while drawn . 
  a sort of humming/buzzing sound for nc , a crackling/electric sound for vs and an engine sound for tr . 
  though maybe it should be louder when drawing it . 
   99 % sure max melee weapons are being worked on . 
  yeah , but i have n't heard anything about swords for normal infantry . 
   we use ai mana turrets for this because they 're almost impossible to kill from the front , but it 's not practical for large numbers . 
  exactly . 
  the idea is that an engineer could deploy like 4 of these ( with lvl 1 cert ) and that they would cost something like 10-25 ish resources . 
  it would also make engineers a bit more useful for other things than repairing vehicles/maxs or giving people ammo . 
  imo they should reduce the limitations a bit so that there 's still a max speed but diving still makes you go much faster . 
  or maybe they could just make it harder to pull up after diving too fast , so afterburning straight down at 800 km/h would result in rapid unplanned disassembly of the esf as it hits the ground . 
  i think he mean tank zergs . 
  in small numbers tanks are weak as fuck ( or rather , infantry is op ) but in large numbers they can quickly overwhelm almost any defense . 
   essentially sounds more like a multi-person buggy than a sunderer which is heavily armored ( more than a tank ) . 
  well it should n't be that much faster or fragile . 
  maybe + 5-10 km/h max speed and -10 -20 % health ? 
  i just figured it would make sense if you removed a ton of armor . 
   edit a squad full of rocket launcher heavies firing off the back of a truck would be pretty deadly . 
  that 's actually why i suggested that maybe the passengers should be limited to their main and secondary weapons . 
  otherwise we could end up with self repairing `` no-fly/drive zones '' moving around at 70 km/h . 
  maybe they could make a `` t5 constitution '' that has the exact same stats , consoles and boff layout as the [ tos constitution ] ( http://sto.gamepedia.com/tos_constitution_class_cruiser ) , costs 2500 zen and require you to be vice admiral . 
  i wish nc got something completely different as their max ability so all factions could get shields as max `` weapons '' when they eventually add the max melee weapons . 
  well i 'm mostly joking , . 
  if they did this , anytime someone says they want a t5 conny everyone could just point at the new overpriced t1 conny . 
  since it 's a vice admiral ship it would be a t5 ship even if the stats says otherwise . 
   i want a flamer for my max, 
  well maybe they 'll eventually give us the ns flamethrower . 
   i also want the abilty to grab an enemy by his head and then crush it and throw it away . 
  that ability is reserved for the bfrs . 
  imo another problem is that for some reason the cloak and weapons are n't mutually exclusive . 
  cloaked has making life even more terrible for vehicles . 
  i have an idea for an infiltrator `` grenade '', 
  `` ninja smoke bomb '' : it 's like a smoke grenade , except you do n't throw it and it 's instant . 
  basically , if you 're caught with your pants down at short range , press g to deploy your emergency smoke screen , cloak and run like a bitch . 
  i wish ground forces had some better ways to coordinate with aircrafts . 
  like a cert to `` call in '' airstrikes , a special waypoint/symbol visible to friendly aircrafts so they know where their target is before reaching the fight/the enemies render . 
  maybe esfs could get a new radar cert . 
  lets call it the opportunist radar . 
  it would detect damaged ( smoking or burning ) enemy vehicles within x meters so the esf can go in an finish them off . 
  could be handy vs vehicles hiding behind cover to repair . 
  i hope the colossus will be something like this . 
  one thing i wish they added ( or at least tested ) is a mobility kill mechanism for tanks in exchange for a large health buff . 
  make them harder to kill in terms of damage , but make it possible to slow or immobilize them . 
  even if they did n't add that to mbts and lightnings , it could work for the colossus . 
  it should be a big fat monster that could take an incredible amount of damage , but if immobilized , it could be flanked , overwhelmed and covered in c4 . 
  maybe at mines , at grenades and the default + ns dumbfire launchers could have a bonus to mobility kills and lock-ons a penalty . 
  that way infantry support would be necessary to protect it from short range attacks , repair the tracks and protect the engineers . 
  imo they should add empire specific abilities for the esfs to make them a bit more different . 
  like some bastardized versions of the mbt abilities ( probably a horrible idea ) . 
  * ** reaver ** assault shield : temporary damage reduction/immunity from frontal attacks . 
  maybe it would be unable to fire when the shield is on . 
  * ** mosquito ** havoc mode ( toggle ability ) : reduced speed and agility in exchange for increased rof and reload speed . 
  toggling it on and off would take a second or two and the ab would be disabled when in havoc mode . 
  * ** scythe ** evasive maneuver : a very poweful speed boost in any direction ( determined by wasd , ctrl and space ) . 
  useful for evading incoming fire or to get the edge in a dogfight .
