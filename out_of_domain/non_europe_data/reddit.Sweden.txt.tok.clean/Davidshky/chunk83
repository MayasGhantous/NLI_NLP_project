  i also think they should add a [ helicopter gunship phantasm ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/planetside/comments/1dcnud/idea_phantasm_gunship/ ) in the future . 
  like the ps1 phantasm except you can replace the cloak with some weapons if you want to . 
  should also have rumble seats ( only main and secondary weapons ) and a small secondary weapon . 
  new vs default camo ... on esamir . 
  or maybe it should come with built in lumifibre . 
  a whole platoon reported you because you kept killing them as a raven max ? 
  i mean , i also hate those things ( the noise ! ), 
  but not that much . 
  am i the only one who wish soe would just remove it completely ? 
  we already have a semi-dedicated av class , the heavy assault . 
  giving the engineer a long range av weapon is like giving the ha a repair tool . 
  i think the engineer need more non-vehicle related stuff ( though tank traps could be a nice consumable ) . 
  it 's a combat engineer and should imo have more roles than repair , resupply and minespam . 
  like deployable cover , a special repair gun that can heal shields , a deployable rc robot instead of the turret ( should cost resources ) , a bonus to blowing up generators , the ability to hack stuff etc etc. 
  well they should probably be much worse at it , like it takes longer , they can only hack terminals , only works in friendly bases or something like that . 
  + they do n't have a cloak . 
  raven : [ hey , want to hear the most annoying sound in the world ? 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eraemvpuwpi ), 
  reminds me of when i ran into a gatecamp once . 
  i was in lowsec omw to 0.0 in my travel fit punisher ( 2x wcs , 2x nanofibre thingies ) and jumped straight into a 10 ( ish ) man gatecamp . 
  due to being lazy and atm using an implantless clone i had n't bothered fitting a cloak and mwd on it so i could n't use that trick . 
  all i could really do was pick a celestial and run which i did . 
  ofc one of the interceptors followed me and we did a merry little dance around the system as i tried to shake him . 
  efter a couple of warps i was finally alone with no ships on d-scan , then i noticed my wallet was blinking . 
  i had recieved 2 mil isk ( lol ) with the message , `` for your loss '' ( or something like that ) . 
  probably the first ( and last ) time i flew into a gatecamp and left richer than when i entered . 
  it was in lowsec . 
  [ for vectron !, 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ictrzuuwlhi ), 
  could i get a few and put them on my scythe ? 
  i promise i 'll only use them vs tr . 
  yeah no . 
  that would be extremely unbalanced when it comes to new vs old players . 
  give the infiltrators an unlockable advanced hacking tool or something instead . 
  trading the sensor darts in exchange for better hacking would at least kinda be a sidegrade , though ofc soe seems to have forgotten about that thing compltely . 
   as it gives me little incentive to buy stuff like this with real money now . 
  it gives you incentive to play more and people who play more often buy more since they get more bounce for the ounce . 
  free stuff also make us players happy which is probably a good idea in the long run . 
  without decent prices people would n't care much about the wds . 
  a huge competition like this can probably create some cheap publicity and draw new players . 
  this would n't work if people did n't care about the wds . 
  turns out that it 's hard to balance 3 factions so soe have decided to nerf tr until it 's pretty much just nc and vs left . 
  then they 'll remove tr completely , allow the few remaining tr players to change faction ( and keep their rank and get new equivalent es stuff ) and then recycle most tr stuff as ns . 
  the mossy is turned into a fragile scout fighter , the prowler into mobile artillery . 
  nc combine their shotgun fetish with trs gatling and explosive technology to create gatling-shotguns with explosive ammo . 
  the tr color theme is divided , nc getting red and vs black . 
  people start complaining about 3rd factioning . 
  maybe it should be limited to unmanned vehicles ? 
  i often end up killing engineers repairing their vehicles so the ability to steal it afterwards would be nice . 
   and may be soviet propaganda . 
  i feel this way about all the record snipers . 
  you could have a bunch of skilled snipers , give them the same equipment and uniform and then give all the credit to one person and no one ( except those involved ) can really confirm or deny it . 
  i mean , [ this is simo h\u00e4yh\u00e4 ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f0/simo_hayha_honorary_rifle.jpg ) in his winter camo . 
  with those clothes in a snowy forest at a distance you could make michael jordan look like h\u00e4yh\u00e4 . 
  it actually took me a while to realize you people were talking about the radeon 7950 and not the [ nvidia card ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/geforce_7_series#geforce_7950_series ) . 
  i was so confused, 
  probably [ bygg bilar med mulle meck ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dmqfqe4kj0 ) or rymdjakten . 
  the problem is that if they change server or faction they lose most if not all of their progress . 
  imagine being one of the nc players who 's been loyal from the start , even when nc was concidered the worst faction . 
  you 've spent sc on extremely expensive weapons and cosmetics and you 've invested a lot of time on your character . 
  all of the sudden you 're being punished because your faction became the fotm and you ca n't do anything about it . 
  soe needs to both punish overpop , remove the penalties of changing faction/server and give more incentive to play as the underdog . 
  enable free server transfers for the overpopulated faction , give account wide unlocks of equivalent empire specific items so changing faction wo n't suck , prevent people from joining the overpop faction etc etc. 
  i mean , 90 % of my loyalty to vanu is because my weapons were fucking expensive . 
  if vs was the fotm with 50 % pop on all servers and my choices were, 
  a ) live with a horrible penalty, 
  b ) start a br1 tr or nc character without most of my expensive weapons, 
  c ) play something else, 
  my choice would most likely be c, 
  how about only rewarding points for every x xp when defending and only for base capture when attacking . 
  that way defending against a zerg would be rewarding even if you lose the fight but there 's no point for the attackers to farm kills . 
  maybe base the attack reward on how many defenders there are rather than how long the base has been held . 
  [ they do n't look better to me ] ( http://i.imgur.com/oanuuok.png ), 
  a lot more cost effective but not better . 
  well afaik they 're inferior when dumbfired . 
  lower projectile velocity and more drop iirc . 
  though ofc the lock-on ability makes them worth it . 
  and i want a rocket launcher for my engineer, 
   what 's next ? 
  maxes with jetpacks ? 
  or engineers with rocket launchers !, 
  how about it being less effective sideways and backwards since then it ca n't use thee main engine/thruster . 
  personally i 'm hoping we 'll get something like the ps1 phantasm transport . 
  made a [ thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/planetside/comments/1dcnud/idea_phantasm_gunship/ ) about it a few months ago . 
   it might make more sense for a `` small aeriel transport '' to exist in a place between the liberator and an esf - no firepower or armor , with the ability to quickly drop or extract units . 
  * airburst [ shrapnel ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shrapnel_shell ) round . 
  explodes mid-air after a certain distance ( that you somehow decide ) into a cloud of pellets . 
  ie , you fire a mini-shotgun that fires a mini shotgun shell mid-air . 
  the vanguard could ( and probably will ) get a canister round ( huge shotgun shell ) weapon . 
  a 100mm flak cannon for the lightning is something i also have suggested . 
  made to engage liberators and galaxies at high alltitudes and be somewhat effective vs vehicles ( kinda like the he cannon ) but really bad vs esfs and infantry . 
  well my idea was that you should set the distance by aiming somewhere and pressing some button . 
  maybe something like this . 
  press and hold m1 . 
  when you press m1 you set the detonation distance to wherever you aimed - x meters . 
  release m1 to fire , press r to cancel . 
  or it could be a single shot rifle and r could be the detonation distance button . 
  and players who were gon na log off but decided to wait because their faction is winning . 
  i know i 've logged in with a character for my daily certs , noticed we 're gon na win an alert in less than 30 minutes and decided to stay longer than my usual 30 seconds . 
  but mostly it 's probably just fotm and the fact that switching faction sucks if you 've bought empire specific stuff with sc .
