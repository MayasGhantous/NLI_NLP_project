  has the cloak ability and power cell kit . 
  should mainly focus on dealing with enemy titans . 
  * marksman squad : armed with dmrs and g2a4 rifles . 
  has the cloak ability and enhanced parkour kit . 
  should focus on finding a decent sniping position and camping there . 
  * guardian squad : armed with spitfire lmgs and archers . 
  no ability or kit , just a lot more health and melee/execution resistance ( maybe they could choke pilots like specters do with grunts ) . 
  should focus on defending hardpoints and flags or simply holding a position in other game-modes . 
  could be some sort of heavier specter variant . 
  maybe also some vehicles . 
  * mbt : those 2-barrel tanks that we see on some maps . 
  big and slow but with plenty of health ( maybe even some shield ) and firepower . 
  should be somewhat threating to a titan and require at-weapons/explosives for pilots to take them out . 
  * drop/gunship : basically the normal dropship except it will fly around the map and let the grunts onboard shoot at stuff on the ground . 
  possibly , the type of npcs dropped in could depend on the current situation . 
  like if we 're on the defense ( controls more points in hpd or has more captures in ctf ) a guardian squad could be useful while an assault squad would be better if we have to capture some points/flags . 
  or of the enemies have a lot more titans an at squad could help . 
  when it comes to game-modes , maybe some sort of hardpoint domination , except only specters can capture the points . 
  ** pilot favorites **, 
  car smg . 
  it 's so good when i 'm parkouring around like a maniac . 
  smart pistol . 
  like the car it 's very useful for parkour and its ability to spot stuff can be very handy . 
  i rarely use it , but it 's kinda fun to punish people who are standing still long enough for the incredibly slow bullet to reach them . 
  charge rifle . 
  best at weapon ever . 
  and the amped version is just evil . 
  satchel charges . 
  why would anyone use anything else ? 
  ** pilot least favorites **, 
  i just do n't like it . 
  kraber ap or g2a4 works much better for me . 
  i rarely like shotguns and this is no exception . 
  hemlok bf-r . what is this thing supposed to be good at ? 
  it 's like a bad hybrid of the carbine and g2a4 . 
  ** titan favorites **, 
  triple threat . 
  titans have a hard time dodging it and it 's really fun to spam it against pilots , or even better into a room with a pilot in it . 
  titan punch . 
  with the heavy punch perk ( name ? 
  ) , getting up close and personal is both effective and satisfying . 
  works great with the triple threat or quad launcher . 
  really nice for hit-and-run with the stryder . 
  also very useful vs minions . 
  ** titan least favorites **, 
  railgun . 
  most maps are n't big enough to make it that useful and i usually prefer fast cqc . 
  40mm cannon . 
  it 's kinda boring . 
  a jack of all trades weapon . 
  exactly !, 
  i agree with some of the merges , like the ams + sunderer and only having one atv . 
  but stuff like a transport liberator is just too much . 
  to me that 's like asking for a cert that would turn the sunderer it into something like [ this ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wsnxiutbf2m/tnyqiequ1vi/aaaaaaaab8m/fhqapsfrhyk/s1600/vw_bus.jpeg ) instead of adding the [ deliverer ] ( http://wiki.planetsidesyndicate.com/index.php?title=deliverer ) . 
  you put the gem in the kits gem-slot in the character equipment window . 
  make sure you 've equipped a new kit first since the old ones do n't have gem-slots . 
  how effective are power drain attacks/abilities in pve ? 
  polaron weapons , tykens rift , energy siphon , plasmionic leech , etc etc. 
  how much power and power insulation does the npcs have ? 
  i did try it with one char in a varanus and it did seem pretty powerful vs bigger targets . 
  focusing several drain abilities + a target shield attack could really fuck up a target . 
  actually , which offensive science abilities are worth using in general ? 
  also , what kind of science related doffs are worth using . 
  like the gravimetric scientist for gravity wells . 
  considering how insanely slow the bullets are it 's almost underpowered which is kinda pleasantly surprising . 
  ohk snipers are usually the weapon i hate the most in fps games , the awp in counter-strike , most bolt-action snipers when you play battlefield on hardcore etc etc. 
  but the krabers bullets move so slow that hitting anyone who 's moving is really damn hard . 
  you even have to lead your target when shooting at titans . 
  it 's also pretty easy to notice for everyone around you . 
  the sound , the tracer and the fact that you show up on the minimap . 
  stay in one place too long and you 're fucked . 
  but since the kraber is the worst weapon in the game when moving you basically have to rely on your pistol when changing position , so staying mobile is also hard . 
  sure you can use a supressor , but then it wo n't ohk unless it 's a headshot , making the hitscan dmr much much better for sneaky sniping . 
  the one thing i do like using it for is as a support weapon . 
  players using the archer or charge rifle tend to be easy targets while locking/charging so it can be useful to protect your teams titans . 
  just find a place with a good view and look for people standing still on rooftops . 
  one time when playing as the norse republic of gotland ( created it manually as svitdjod ) i married my brother to one of the princesses of norway . 
  20 ish years later we suddenly became the republic of norway because my brother had somehow become the king and as a family member he was a vassal of gotland . 
  somehow this gave us the entire kingdom and my brother lost all power ( though he and his wife kept their king and queen titles ) and his children would n't inherit anything . 
  not only heavily augmented but possibly also cloned . 
  why else would they sometimes say `` he 's gon na hold a grudge '' after you kill someone . 
  maybe that 's why people are willing to go through the 98 % fatality rate training program , because if you succeed you 're rewarded with `` immortality '' . 
  what if after you become a pilot , they kinda make your consciousness digital . 
  a constant uplink between the pilot and the ship/base/hq could save your consciousness when you die . 
  that way the `` new you '' is n't just a copy with your memories and personality but rather your old mind in a new body . 
  kinda like the players in eve or dust 514 . 
  yes , but how can a dead person hold a grudge ? 
  what i mean is that the reason we 're even able to respawn is because when we die , our mind is uploaded into a new body . 
  usually people stay dead when they 're killed , but a pilot is just temporarily disembodied . 
  well yeah , i 'm kinda overanalyzing stuff . 
  but either pilots have some ability to come back from the dead or the guy doing the `` hold a grudge '' comment is breaking the 4th wall and i kinda prefer the former . 
  in for example cod , you might play as spetznas_dude_1516512075 and if you die you respawn as spetznas_dude_1516512079 . 
  in titanfall , the `` hold a grudge '' tcomment means that an ingame character is aware that pilots can respawn . 
  this means that either a ) pilots can somehow respawn in the titanfall universe or b ) that guy is breaking the 4th wall . 
  data loss maybe ? 
  die too many times and the software-mind start deteriorating . 
  or maybe the augmented clones simply cost a lot more than a dropship . 
  so even though they have the ability to more or less churn out pilot-bodies on a conveyor belt , a drop ship is less advanced and made mostly out of metal which by the looks of things is n't that hard to aquire in the titanfall universe . 
  use the triple threat or quad rocket . 
  my go-to stryder build has the triple threat or quad-rocket with extended mag , rocket salvo , vortex shield , dash quickcharger and big punch .
