  use the nuclear ejection kit or the burn card and use your stryder as a running bomb . 
   could of, 
  do n't write `` could of '', 
  maybe a map where parts of the floor is lava . 
  like a base in a volcanic area . 
  4 ground passives , 4 space passives and 4 actives ( ie , the tier 5 ability ), 
  ** isolationist sparta ** : unless someone wipes them out they 'll just stay in their itty bitty town and cry . 
  ** the eastern bloc ** : most/all of the seleucids satrapies break free and then form a huuuge military alliance with each other and then invite some other eastern factions . 
  they can just spam eastern spearmen and slingers against everything until they win . 
  ** syracuse stronk ** : somehow this shitty little shit faction always manage to survive and expand . 
  they do n't become an empire or anything but a faction that 's wedged between rome and carthage has no business surviving . 
  reminds me of a suggestion i made on the forums a few years ago . 
  basically a region ( jove space ? ), 
  with half broken warpgates and probably cyno jamming . 
  not really wh space because it 's using gates but not that different . 
  some examples, 
  * one way gates . 
  you can use them to go to a new system , but the gate on the other side is broken . 
  getting from a to b is easy , getting from b to a is a bitch . 
  * gates with size restrictions . 
  only ships below a certain size would be able to jump through . 
  a to b , 5 jumps with a cruiser , 22 jumps with a bs . 
  * gates with a mass limit . 
  after enough mass has passed through , the gate shuts down for a while to recharge . 
  like a wh except it 's always in the same place and ( probably ) leads to the same system . 
  * gates with power problems . 
  sometimes they 're online and sometimes they 're not . 
  should n't be random but it should be something like a cycle of `` 541 seconds offline , 817 seconds online '' ( would vary per gate ) so it ca n't be predicted too easily . 
  * gates with random destinations . 
  it no longer points towards the intended target but some gates are able to intercept/recieve the signal . 
  so everytime someone jumps through they could end up in system a , b or c. 
  * w-space gates . 
  these gates are so fucked up that there 's a small chance they 'll throw you into w-space by accident . 
  * hidden gates . 
  not that special except they do n't show up on the overview so someone has to probe them down first . 
  * locked gates . 
  wo n't let anyone through until someone hacks it . 
  a successful hack will open the gate for a few minutes minutes , a failed one will activate the gate guns . 
  they could also be combined , so for example you could have a one-way gate with a random destination and a 1 % chance of ending up in w-space . 
  you should never get stuck ( unless in w-space without probes ) in a system because of offline gates and stuff like that , but it could result in some long detours . 
  well when they updated the character creation i spent waaaay too much time trying to make it look somewhat similar to the old portrait . 
  no idea about the original though . 
  the `` friendly pilot on your titan '' message should come much much earlier . 
  like as soon as they start climbing . 
  iirc he had 500 kills with his mosin-nagant and about 200 kills with his smg . 
  also , how confirmed were these kills ? 
  i 've always been skeptical when it comes to all these super-snipers from ww2 . 
  i mean , you could dress up almost anyone like h\u00e4yh\u00e4 in that picture and from a few hundred meters away it would be impossible for the enemy to prove it was n't him unless he 's killed or captured . 
  i know , and that 's kinda the point . 
  well you havent missed anything when it comes to the crafting system . 
  you 're better off to simply sell the materials and buy what you want . 
  iirc they have said they 're gon na revamp it and give it a reputation system ( no april fools joke ) so it might become interesting in the future . 
  the injury system is pretty much just debuffs of varying severity that you can get when you die ( usually only in difficult stuff like elite stfs ) and have to use repair/heal items or visist the repair/healing npc to get rid of . 
  i do hope you repair/heal yourself and do n't have a long list of injuries like some idiots do . 
  i think it 's probably a design choice . 
  full 3d movement can easily get chaotic and confusing . 
  it would also require very different level design . 
  with 2.5 d we have up and down and we can have some sort of cardinal direction by simply calling the top of the 2d map north . 
   i just want a space game that feels like space . 
  please explain . 
  personally i love sto because it 's one of the few space games where i can actually command space ** ships ** . 
  i do n't really like dogfighting so all those games where you 're basically just flying around in a tiny fighter-jet in space just is n't my cup of tea . 
  here 's the picture, 
  hmmm ... 
  sounds like it could be very useful when assembling stuff in space . 
  no more need for extra docking ports to use a tug-vessel . 
  does grabbing a ship work like docking ? 
  does it become one vessel ? 
  can the claw lead fuel ? 
  i actually had pretty much the exact same idea except that the bomb would be carried by a titan . 
  it would replace the main gun and give the titan a significant speed penalty so it would be pretty vulnerable . 
  tactical abilities , ordnance and melee would still work so the titan would n't be completely defenseless . 
  might make instant-titan burn cards kinda op , though tbh they are for most game-modes . 
  make sure you 're always ready to deal with small enemy forces coming to raid and pillage . 
  in e : tw , a lot of the `` buildings '' will be outside the main cities . 
  you have these small towns scattered everywhere and more will pop up as the population of a region grows . 
  these can be turned into schools ( research ) , church schools ( religion ) , craft workshops ( dosh ! ), 
  and coaching inns ( happiness ) . 
  then you have farms , mines and other resources spread around the regions . 
  the problem is that they can easily be attacked and damaged by enemy units . 
  if your enemies can get a single unit into your territory they can cripple you for several turns . 
  your research is halted and income reduced and you have to spend money to repair the stuff afterward . 
  and trust me , the ai love to do this . 
  well i was n't planning on using them for construction that way 8except for an asteroid base ) . 
  it 's just that i usually have a tug-vessel attached to my space stations to collect and attach new pieces . 
  the claw should reduce the need for extra docking ports . 
  quark : i want you to try something for me . 
  listen to a bit of this . 
  garak : what is it ? 
  quark : a human song , it 's called `` where my heart will take me '' . 
  garak : nah , i do n't know . 
  quark : come on , are n't you just a little bit curious ? 
  song : i got faaaaith of the haaaaaaaaaaaaaah !!!, 
  garak : it 's vile !, 
  quark : i know . 
  it 's so bubbly and cloying and happy . 
  garak : just like the federation . 
  quark : and you know what 's really frightening ? 
  if you listen to enough of it , you begin to like it . 
  garak : [ it 's insidious .
