  and a nuclear war would probably end in a `` draw '' since we also have some nukes . 
  sure they have a lot more nukes than the eu but that would n't really matter . 
  500 nukes would be enough to nuke the shit out of western russia . 
  when did i mention america ? 
  cannons , dual cannons or dhcs ? 
  cause normal cannons are kinda useless : /, 
  how does it work exactly ? 
  do i still need to encounter some of the events or do i just have to get him to the rock homeworld ? 
   in case a character was there when the user logged out . 
  would n't it be easier to just put them back in their ship in the system/sector or something like that ? 
  the doff `` law '' is pretty easy to get . 
  he 's a purple torpedo doff ( chance to reduce torpedo cooldown ) that you get from one of the missions in mos eisley on dune . 
  nah , it 's the same weapon . 
  it 's just that the whole name wo n't fit in the box . 
  like how chain lasers become chain l. 
  probably engi a with vulcan , ion blast ii and ion stunner i + 3x combat drone i. i just had to target their shields , launch drones and laugh . 
  rock c ( i think ) cruiser with 2x breach missiles and an ion bomb + the missile fabricator thingy was also pretty op . 
  iirc , hw2 had some sort of `` adaptable '' difficulty , so if you did really great one mission the ai would get more ships , resources and other bonuses the next one . 
  i remember some guide that pretty much told you do recycle most of your units before ending a mission because of this . 
   never seemed to work right, 
  you can say that again . 
  i remember that damn mission where you had to defend a shipyard . 
  i did great the mission before ( saved all crew ships ) so the game decided to kick me in the groin and block out the sun with infiltrator frigates . 
  lots of delta quadrant stuff apparently . 
   talaxians , ocampa ( fed ) and kazon ( kdf ) as new playable races, 
  i 'm gon na have to make a talaxian and kazon character just to annoy people . 
  did some googling and this was the best i could find . 
   raiders are a lot of fun . 
  indeed, 
  i had some fun making an a2b science b'rel with one character . 
  gravity well , photonic shockwave and charged particle burst combined with a [ purple gravimetrics doff ] ( http://sto.gamepedia.com/specialization:_gravimetric_scientist#gravity_well_variant ) and a purple [ photonic shockwave doff ] ( http://sto.gamepedia.com/specialization:_photonic_studies_scientist#photonic_shockwave_variant ) resulted in a pretty evil aoe bop . 
  i also made a power-drain bop with another character . 
  polaron weapons , plasmonic leech , tykens rift ( with purple grav doff ) , energy siphon and target shield subsystem . 
  not as effective as i hoped but i could basically shut down one or two enemies completely . 
  [ never forget !, 
  i 've suggested something like this as a sort of disguise module, 
  * high slot modue, 
  * similar drawbacks to cloaking modules ( but not as severe ), 
  * would come in both normal and cov ops versions . 
  * scripts would be used to choose apperance . 
  * would be limited to changing race , size or tech . 
  ie , an omen could disguise as any cruiser sized amarr vessel without a script , t2/t3 cruiser sized vessels with a tech script , amarr bcs with a + size script , amarr destroyers with a - size script and any t1 cruiser sized vessel of other races using a faction script . 
  the cov ops version should allow both warping and locking while disguised but has the same ship restrictions as cov ops cloaks . 
  possibly , when activating it , a small list off avaliable disguises should appear . 
  well hopefully it could be balanced with some decent drawbacks . 
  like cpu usage , target lock delay ( for the normal version ) , sensor resolution and stuff like that . 
  should probably also be mutually exclusive with cloaking modules . 
  ie , you ca n't have both equipped and online . 
  and mmmmmaybe the normal version could be countered with a ship scanner or maybe just by locking on to it . 
   i have a gallery of images that i want to submit , is this allowed ? 
   collections are no longer allowed because many if not all collections rarely fit completely , there are usually one or two images that are n't appropriate for the subreddit . 
  we suggest that you either post the images individually or submit your favorite and then link to the collection in the comments of the post . 
  fr\u00e5n [ sumbission rules faq ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/militaryporn/wiki/faq ), 
  imo they should make a `` t5 '' constitution , but it should be exactly the same as t1 version . 
  same console and boff layouts , same stats , etc etc. 
  the only difference would be the price ( 2500 z ) and level requirement ( 50 ) . 
  so anytime someone asks for a t5 conny they can just point to the new extremely overpriced ~ ~ t1 ~ ~ t5 conny, 
  i made a tos klingon ( alien ) tactical character recently and stacked a bunch of expose chance traits . 
  i reached 45 % chance to expose ... 
  i intend to give all my boffs split beam rifles and then focus on exposing everything ( grenades and pulsewave ) and then enjoy the carnage . 
  later on i 'll probably get the dyson or undine reputation rifles since the primary attack is an expose and the secondary an exploit . 
  you should probably have targeted the shields first . 
  imo it 's usually quicker to take out/weaken the shields and then take out the missile launcher than trying to take out the missiles first . 
  unless you have boarders or a lot of missiles/bombs . 
  the best defensive counter to the missiles are cloak , upgraded engines , and defense drones . 
  whenever the flagship fire a missile salvo , put as much power into your engines as possible . 
  take the power from oxygen , shields and medbay or something . 
  if you use defense drones , only power them when you have incoming missiles . 
  90 % of the time you wo n't need them and rerouting power is easy as long as you pause . 
  another advice is that unless you really have to , never vent your door room . 
  while you did have a lanius , it 's still not a good idea . 
  something similar happened to me once except i had a cloning bay and i did n't notice until several minutes later . 
  my entire crew had lost all their skills from dying over and over again for 10 minutes . 
  in sector 8 ... 
  stay out of tractor range ( 5km ) and shoot down the heavy torps ? 
  i wonder if they 'll add stridsvagn 2000 as a swedish prototype unit, 
  140 mm main gun + a 40 mm coaxial gun . 
  it remembers my password, 
  sidebar , game guides . 
  iirc , they 're adding a purple mk xii bio-torp to the undine reputation and they 'll replace the mission reward with some sort of disruptor torp . 
  i suspect they messed up the boff seating on the dromias bio-cruiser again or that thing will be ~ ~ op ~ ~ awesome as fuck . 
  could you possibly make one with only t5 ships and possibly split them into fleet and non-fleet ( so 7 categories ) ? 
  or maybe even `` free '' ( dil/mirror ) , c-store and fleet categories . 
  ( or tell me which program you used and i 'll make my own chart ), 
  i think that the klingons and romulans are a lot more even in terms of non-fleet t5 ships . 
  ( 26 vs 23 i think ), 
  this reminds me . 
  it would be really nice if someone could make a sort of comparison chart for cloak visibility . 
  different graphic settings , distances , backgrounds ( bushes , snow , building ) , daytime and infiltrator movement ( sprinting , walking , crouching etc ) . 
  i know it could be a lot of work but i think it would be really useful , both when it comes to talking about this problem and for learning how to be a better infiltrator . 
  can we have normal turrets and flamethrower turrets at the same time ? 
  the scandinavian and nswp factions will ( according to [ this ] ( http://www.wargame-ee.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=155&amp;t=35576 ) ) be updated to 1991 for free later on . 
  personally i think it 's `` possible '' sweden could get strv 121 & 122 ( leopard 2 ) , saab 39 gripen and mmmmmmaybe strv 2000 ( mbt with 140 mm main gun and 40 mm coaxial ) . 
  possibly as prototype units . 
  i think op for some reason believes that a lot of green nodes is a good thing . 
  imo , the redder the better . 
  more enemies = more scrap = more stuff . 
   a superheavy would be lovely , perhaps an indigenous design ? 
  [ i mentioned strv 2000 ] ( http://www.ointres.se/strv2000_attrapp-web.jpg ), 
  the program ran from 1984 to 1991 so it could make sense that in the wargame universe it went into `` mass-production '' or something .
