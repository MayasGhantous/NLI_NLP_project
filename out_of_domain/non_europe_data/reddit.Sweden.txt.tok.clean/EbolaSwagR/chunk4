  guarder m100 and break it in, 
  do you have the velcro belt thats supposed to sit in ypur normal belt and loops of the pants ? 
  the molle belt should velcro itself to that underbelt and be very secure . 
  you need to get an aimpoint cs replica or something that looks like it and a bog standard foregrip . 
  m90 uniform is a must aswell is it not :p,

  ** backstory : ** aurene daughter of a nord mercenary and dunmer farmer came to skyrim to find home since she felt more as a nord than dunmer . 
  what she met was racist hostility for her not being a pure nord . 
  this led her to hone her magical abilities to perfection and try to win over people even though she was a half elf by her good heart and actions . 
  right now she has settled down for a while at her hearth in falkreath after returning home from solstheim and enjoys spending time with her wife muiri and their adopted kid sofie from windhelm . 
  she plans on attending the collage of winterhold when she feels rested enough . 
  ah i contacted them , unfortunatly device was already tossed but gave them all the info i could and that was that . 
  as for the infection its mostly healed up nicely with only slight scarring . 
  they would have offered a replacement if i 'd have asked for one im sure but since i live in sweden and i get mine for free anyways i felt like it didnt matter . 
  i sent them the serialnumber for the other sensor i got from the same batch . 
  ( have n't had a problem with these tho ) they 'd contact me if they required any more info . 
  also owner of we glock but glock 17 , im also wondering what upgrades are necessary ? 
  thus far the only thing i 've noticed to be bad is the hammer bearing which should be switched to a ball bearing one , and that upgrade is only 7 dollars . 
  the stock hopup is also good as long as you do the hopup mod which is free . 
  never seen a meatball pizza . 
  how was it ? 
  ohhh it looks slick af in tan !, 
  own the black version myself and mine has been running flawless . 
  i recomend you do the hopup mod for it , which really helps range and accuracy and doesnt cost a penny !, 
  i and my mates run almost exclusively asg 85 rnds and havent had any problems . 
  they feed great in my ca delta 10 , my mates g&g raider , amoeba am016 and older jg g36 with m4 adapter . 
  only bad thing was that my crappy super cheap flimsy speedloader jammed a bb under the feed knob to the spring . 
  got it out by throwing the mag on the ground a few times and has been working great since . 
  could have bought 2 more . . my dude . 
  it would !, 
  its rebranded by asg but made by classic army and its from their latest skirmish line which is good . 
  it 'll work no problem . 
  and you got a really good deal aswell . 
  bought a 5 pack for roughly the same here in sweden . 
  insane the differense huh ? 
  i would n't say they 're bossy but rather condescending . 
  they should try to be more friendly so the sport is more inviting to new players . 
  cant recommend the skirmish line enough, 
  yup !, 
  i run one and the stock performance is pretty incredible . 
  if you pick one up also get a picatinny keymod rail section for a foregrip or something . 
  [ here you go ] ( http://www.airsoftcanada.com/showthread.php?t=165305 ), 
  ptfe grease and silicone oil is all you need . 
  silicone oil for o-rings, 
  ptfe grease for the slide and all the major stress points, 
  also pick up some lower power green gas since the tm 's plastic slide might crack with regular, 
  maybe a kjw kc02 ? 
  i think i saw a video of a custom suppressed version of it that was almost as quiet as a tm mk23, 
  kjw kc02, 
  well i see two problems, 
  your phones might get shot and break, 
  phone gps is generally not that accurate outside driving on roads . 
  if you play on fields it wont be useful at all since fields are usually pretty small . 
  id practice game sense and awareness instead, 
  ooooo that ak is fiiiine . 
  if you have genuine surplus m90 trousers there should be a tab to lock with the boot laces [ like this ] ( http://img.rodastjarnan.com/faltuniformer-faltbyxa-m90-18723-c7.jpg ) which should guaranteed keep the snow out . 
  really sexy kit my man , it looks very genuine except for the side rails on the helmet and the optic which needs to be an [ aimpoint cs ] ( http://www.midwayusa.com/product/119389/aimpoint-cs-red-dot-sight-26mm-tube-1x-2-moa-dot-with-integrated-picatinny-style-mount-matte ) which you actually can get as a civilian in the us unlike sweden . 
  rush with 5 min regroup when point is taken is really fun in woodland . 
  i 've been lookin at one of those rails , can you send me a link and say the inner diameter of it ? 
  want to do a recessed suppressor . 
  too much hopup maybe ? 
  and clean your inner barrel with rubbing alcohol and wipe with a microfiber cloth, 
  settle down kids , he asked a valid question . 
  i would look up a danish facebook group or forum and ask the question there . 
  asg just rebrands the kjw cz p09 , they 're the same gun . 
  ca n't go wrong with either really . 
  you 'll need to take syringes before every meal , big or small . 
  and before bed . 
  and then you 'll have to deal with self loathing . 
  i dont know how the paintball magazines look or which pouches fit them but i can help you with the lightweight plate carrier, 
  the most common small light pc is the jpc , i have one from emerssongear and its good enough . 
  goes like modi - [ emerson ] ( http://www.taiwangun.com/en/vests-rigs/lightweight-jump-plate-carrier-with-dummy-sapi-plates-olive-em?from=listing&amp;campaign-id=14 ) - flyee-crye in terms of quality . 
  if you want something even lighter maybe you should look at [ something like this ] ( http://gunfire.pl/product-eng-1152209721-laser-cut-plate-carrier-tactical-vest-tan.html ), 
  that, 
  made, 
  leak, 
  like, 
  the asr is made by aps which is not very like in this sub , and i personally sont have any experiance myself with them . 
  consider the cyma cm .45 c which is a full metal ak74u with tactical rail foreguard . 
  solid internals and built like a tank . 
  $ 180 euros . 
  holy shit that was really great . 
  some of the best editing i 've seen in an airsoft video !, 
  i have never used tracer bb 's but i have used regular blaster bb 's and they 're good . 
  i reckon you 'll get more value out of the blaster ones even tho g&g might be slightly higher quality, 
  ah another who likes fireballs at work . 
  only way to survive with stacys nagging huh ? 
  i think ehobbyasia has a glock red dot with mount for ~ $ 35 but im not sure it works on ksc . 
  red hot 1000 degree knife vs loaf of bread . 
  been playing in the thick green forrests of sweden in multicam and it works really good . 
  have had atleast 3 people approach me saying how they did n't see me . 
  im a sucker for pistols and a glock would be neat but not the fullauto version .
