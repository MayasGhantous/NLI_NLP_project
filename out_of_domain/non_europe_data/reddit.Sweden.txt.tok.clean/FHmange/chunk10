  i do n't even understand how your mind managed to wrench what i wrote into what you are saying now . 
  to compare shooting/escaping enemies in a room you just entered , and bailing out of a jet out of bounds , is like comparing stone and water . 
  what * i * said , was that what you 're saying is that it should basically be okay to be able to insta-suicide ** right when ** you realize you ** wo n't ** win the dual you are in , just to deny your opponent * what he deserves * . 
  all of this , plain and simple because you 're a dick . 
  nothing more , nothing less . 
  you gain nothing on it , your team gain nothing on it . 
  enemy team lose nothing on it . 
  all that happens is that you deny your opponent what he deserve to get . 
  now you 're just plain stupid . 
  bff never cease to make me laugh . 
  they 're awesome .

  [ yeah , this is not true at all .

  football stadiums are sacred ground where we go to let our steam out . 
  just like our father before us , and their father before them . 
  * wow * , small children might eat chocolate i leave in the middle of the room for two weeks ? 
  i 'm never gon na get any of those fucking monsters . 
  and how do you know that ? 
  just because they did take a picture does n't necessarily mean that 's * all * they did . 
  i do n't get the hate in this thread . 
  it 's a damn kid , probably barely 2 years old . 
  she took some chocolate , so what ? 
  i honestly think it 's pretty damn strong of her even to wait two full weeks when they leave the chocolate like that , and do n't hide it somewhere . 
  kids do stuff like this , what 's the big deal ? 
  haha yeah , hopefully she will learn her lesson . 
  well that was really uncalled for . 
  i 'm pretty sure you get to a point in your life where you 'd much rather cuddle up before a good movie with chocolate and wine than , e.g. 
  go out and drink . 
  hell , i 'm barely 20 and i 'd love to watch a movie , drink wine and eat chocolate with a girl i love . 
  sounds like a pretty fucking sweet life in my opinion . 
  you may be correct . 
  but in her defense , if that 's the case , that she * just * found them , no one could 've told her that she was absolutely not allowed to eat them . 
  i bet her parents tell her not to eat candy etc other than when they give it to her , but let 's be honest here ; what child on earth would n't eat found candy if he or her has not been * specifically * told not to eat that exact piece of candy . 
  well , we do n't use that letter in sweden , though . 
  here we only have \u00c4 , \u00d6 and \u00c5, 
  ( \u00c4 = \u00e6 ), 
  just say you 're updating some software or something and it ca n't be used at the moment . 
  she probably wo n't question it . 
  \u00c4h l\u00e4gg av , hoa hoa `` pulls it off '' * . 
  my first name is fredrik ya basterd ... quite common here in sweden, 
  they were so special back then . 
  remember how the further you got in frontline , enemies `` advanced in level '' , and had much more hp ? 
  and then when you met the main bad-nazi-guy at the end he took like 400 bullets to kill . 
  like a damn fantasy game boss . 
  god i fucking loved that game . 
  edit : ord, 
  the swedish version of ` the girl with the dragon tatoo ', 
  it 's probably for the best if a lot of people does not see this . 
  you see , jagex will obviously be informed if thousands of people knows how to vote twice on this poll , and that may force them to reset it . 
  and if they were to reset it in the next couple of days , chances are great that many will miss it , and we will end up with less votes than we would 've in the original poll . 
  i do n't want to spoil the movie for anyone , but i 'm sure you can take a guess, 
  and swedish * kejsare *, 
  ( k being pronounced as * sh * ), 
  also , swedish equivalent of `` cock '' ( kuk ) origins from the word describing a part of a tree that 's sticking out . 
  [ like this ] ( http://f1.pepst.com/c/43b095/54969/ssc3/home/024/singleboy0/albums/big_wood.jpg_480_480_0_64000_0_1_0.jpg ), 
  hmm , i 'm really bad at explaining words and language , but i 'll try . 
  k in swedish , if it 's the first letter of a word , is either pronounced as c in `` core/call '' etc or * sh * . 
  however it can only be pronounced as * sh * if it also has a vowel after it . 
  which one you use basically depends on what word it is , and in some cases * which * vowel comes after it . 
  you just have to learn and remember it . 
  ** example of words pronounced * sh * : **, 
  k\u00e4ra - in love/dear, 
  k\u00f6r - drive ( this one is funny because k\u00f6r can also mean choire , and is in that case pronounced the `` c '' - way ), 
  k\u00e4nna - feel, 
  ** example of `` c '' : **, 
  kunna - be able to, 
  kol - coal, 
  kall - cold, 
  knapp - button, 
  yeah , i suck at this . 
  i 'm sure some other swede can explain it much better , but hopefully now you atleast understand it a bit better !, 
  edit : added some examples and changed some words to make it a bit clearer, 
  nice man, 
  did you read the same thing the rest of us read ? 
  yeah honestly it 's more like * bad luck every straight guy in the seven kingdoms * when the gay guy marries the hottest girl, 
  the vikings discovered america before columbus , yes . 
  whether or not the chinese discovered it even sooner , i have no idea . 
  never heard of it either actually .

  even worse when someone lie about being friendly and then kills you the second you show yourself . 
  i hate it so much . 
  i actually first found out about reddit because of f7u12 , and for the first couple of weeks was the only subreddit i was on . 
  now i * hate * it . 
  ah , well , i did n't mean exactly a '' * couple * couple '' . 
  it 's just something you say when you do n't recall the exact number y' know ? 
  it was probably 4-6 weeks atleast . 
  i love people like you , who actually ask for gunners instead of just leaving as fast as they can on their own . 
  especially when it comes to helis . 
  for the first time in months i actually felt hope when i woke up and stepped outside . 
  it was glorious . 
  yeah , that would be hot, 
  yep . 
  as a kid i spent * countless * hours in front of pharaoh and caesar iii . 
  holy fuck i loved those games ... got ta replay them, 
  empire earth 1 was lots of fun . 
  never played 2 though ... 
  honestly did n't even know they released a second one, 
  do n't worry , i often think girls are cuter when pale rather than sunburned . 
  and i 'm sure i 'm not alone in that .
