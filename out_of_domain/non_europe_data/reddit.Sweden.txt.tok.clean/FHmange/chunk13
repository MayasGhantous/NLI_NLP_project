  thanks mate , now i wo n't have to feel as alone anymore, 
  yeah , we probably did  sk\u00e5l !, 
  aw man sorry about that . 
  i actually just passed my driving test today , so i 'm celebrating with a bottle of whiskey ... 
  but i 'm 20 so do n't feel bad about failing , * lots * of people do . 
  where are you from mate ? 
  i mean , not all countries can drink when 18 . 
  also , happy birthday !, 
  thanks !, 
  haha alright man i 'm from sweden . 
  in stockholm the waiting time for the driving test is also like 2 months , fucking insane . 
  but i did it in a small town called falun , so i could do the test almost at once . 
  also , shit , is it that easy to get alcohol in norway ? 
  sweet man . 
  i 've never actually been to norway , but i really should go . 
  i 'll pm you when i get there and force you to buy me several drinks . 
  so fucking expensive in norway . 
  damn rich norwegians . 
  i do n't even know what you mean but yeah cheers man !, 
  holy goddamn shit norwegian dude . 
  that 's nice . 
  especially the alcohol shit, 
  oh wow sorry about that , i 've never heard about a parent not being allowed to buy alcohol just because of their child being with them ... must have been a real cunt , sorry about that . 
  in sweden , wherever i 've been so far , you also have to show id , even if your friend is 20 and buys the alcohol , but i guess thats not too weird . 
  you still owe me a beer though you oil-rich basterd, 
  no we did n't norrj\u00e4vel , but i like norwegians , so if you come to stockholm , just send me a pm and i 'll buy you a drink, 
  all . 
  however i do prefer cash 's later songs , they are amazing, 
  they are soccer supporters , unfortunately also of the same team as i am , aik stockholm . 
  this was right outside of the arena before a qualification game for europa league , against the polish club * lech poznan * . 
  they were trying to loosen the trash can so they could throw it against lech poznan fans / police . 
  i arrived a few moments after the crowd was driven away by police , and the street looked like a damn war zone . 
  ridiculous . 
  [ a video taken roughly at the same time ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztom2jiluyw ), 
  [ we value our trash and do not want anyone taking it from us ] ( http://www.mnn.com/lifestyle/recycling/blogs/sweden-runs-out-of-garbage-forced-to-import-from-norway ), 
  ever heard of a hoarder ? 
  is that a hare ? 
  how the fuck did a hare get up there ? 
  i mean they can jump , but jeez , this is n't a damn cartoon, 
  op must feel so lucky right now, 
  quality family time right there, 
  itt : people reminding op of every country of the world that reddit has ever mentioned, 
  yeah honestly i do n't agree with this one bit . 
  you hav n't lost the argument only because you 're short tempered . 
  if you 're right you still won even though you scream . 
  i 'm all for civilized arguments , but this feels like som fucking kindergarten rule or something . 
  you suck op !, 
  in my family we ussually eat it on [ hard tunnbr\u00f6d ] ( http://recept.citygross.se/productimages/pfi_11410_3.jpg ) with some crushed cooked potato , onion , sour cream and dill or chives . 
  it 's supposed to look something like [ this ] ( http://blogs.sweden.se/photo/files/2012/09/surstromming_summer_tradition-02.jpg ) . 
  you drink beer and [ snaps ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/snaps ) with it . 
  it 's not for everyone , but personally i love it . 
  edit : added chives , forgot about those . 
  they 're actually nicer than dill in my opinion . 
  * well then * , have a bite if you * dare *, 
  usually you start with the one on you right , then the one on your left , then the one seated opposite to you . 
  then you do it backwards after the drink . 
  but of course it sometimes gets messed up, 
  `` this video is not available in your country '' what irony since i 'm a swede . 
  [ and also this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znrt0pehiyq ), 
  edit : [ and this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=byfmz_wuqxi#t=62s ), 
  i was very young though , probably one of my first boners and i did n't even understand at the time that it was awkward , but afterwards ... 
  look at happy videos on youtube . 
  like [ where the hell is matt ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlfkdbwwruy ) and stuff like that . 
  yeah sweden officially recognized ( is that the right word to use ? ), 
  the genocide a few years back , resulting in turkey bringing their own ambassador home , and forcing the swedish ambassador out of turkey . 
  it 's extremely ridiculous . 
  lots of fans also bought roses at the entrance which was then placed behind the goal , and t-shirts with # 27 and turina printed on them . 
  if i 'm not mis-informed , the money will be donated to turina 's pregnant wife and 1-year-old twins . 
  i 'd also like to thank the ifk gothenburg supporters and players for showing so much respect towards the memory of ivan during this game , it was great sportmanship and it moved me . 
  this is a match i will never forget . 
  last time i checked we 're northern european , though . 
  not eastern . 
  beautiful, 
  nothing in the article op posted says the two attackers are dead , so if op had actually read the article * he * posted , he would n't have been misinformed . 
  i see . 
  the newspapers i read never change their articles , but instead write new ones ( and of course inform in the old article that it was wrong ) . 
  i just assumed all did the same , but i was wrong . 
  ( i 'm from a different country , maybe that 's why , i do n't know ) i apologize . 
  yeah i know it 's too bad ... 
  the only picture i know of though, 
  it 's an archer reference . 
  there 's a club called `` sommar ! '', 
  which is pretty good , majority of the crowd are around 18-21 years old . 
  they have a couple of different dance floors with different music ( like house , dubstep , hip hop , 80 's / 90 's etc ) , and also a lot of bars outside , which is very nice when the weather is good . 
  not too expensive either , even though that was n't a problem for you . 
  i highly recommend this one . 
  it 's located on [ flemmingsgatan 2 , kungsholmen ] ( https://maps.google.se/maps?q=fleminggatan+2&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=0x465f9d63b5ba0227:0x8056b3a100ffc510,fleminggatan+2,+112+26+stockholm&amp;gl=se&amp;ei=_y2mucm5noel4gs-loh4ag&amp;ved=0cd0q8gewaq ) down by the water . 
  another one i can recommend is laroy , this is a bit smaller and only has a small space outside for you to smoke on , but it 's still always very crowded with people aged ~ 19-22 . 
  i guess laroy is not quite as `` relaxed '' as sommar !, 
  is ( there are more rich kids with expensive clothes that order champagne there ) , and it 's basically only house music . 
  but i have had some fun there . 
  also , this mean that you have to dress up atleast a bit , but a nice shirt some clean jeans and not too shabby shoes is enough ( if you are males that is , if you 're girls ... 
  i do n't know , i 'm sure you 'll figure it out ), 
  it 's located on [ stureplan ] ( https://maps.google.se/maps?gs_rn=12&amp;gs_ri=psy-ab&amp;tok=6ertj3rk1_c6dy6wirzxha&amp;cp=9&amp;gs_id=z&amp;xhr=t&amp;q=stureplan&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_cp.r_qf.&amp;bvm=bv.47008514,d.bge&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=955&amp;um=1&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;hl=sv&amp;sa=n&amp;tab=wl ) . 
  unfortunately many clubs have a strict 20-year-old age limit on weekends , but these two are in my opinion quite good , and there should n't be any problem getting in as a 19-year-old . 
  especially if you 're girls . 
  there are a few more of course , but these are the ones i personally would recommend . 
  edit : if you 're still here next wednesday i suggest you go out , since there are always a lot of people out on wednesdays in sweden , and almost every club is open to 3 am and crowded . 
  plus , it 's a lot easier to get into clubs as a 19-year-old on wednesdays,
