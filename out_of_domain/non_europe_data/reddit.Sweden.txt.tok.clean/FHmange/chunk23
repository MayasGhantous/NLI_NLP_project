  the reaction in the comments i can see on my phone make it seem like it 's just a joke . 
  well that 's certainly not very funny . 
  well that 's fun . 
  i had n't heard they were going offline - and i just bought bfii on the steam sale two days ago because my ps2 controllers has been fucked up for some time now . 
  and , of course , steam reached their cd-key limit so i have to wait , for perhaps weeks , before i get mine . 
  god damnit . 
  for me , op 's link is to the explosion that happened a few days ago . 
  [ this one . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxdbenbtgp0&amp;feature=youtu.be ), 
  not the one on / r/syriancivilwar frontpage today . 
  the first time i had sp there was a man-like shade standing beside my bed pushing down on my chest so i could n't breath , that was the most terrifying experience in my life . 
  another time it was just like for you , i woke up on my stomach facing the wall but could feel an intruder climbing in through my window ( which is open when i sleep ) . 
  i was laying there just trying the hardest i could to force my body to wake up so i could fight whoever was entering my room , but it was impossible . 
  i knew what sp was by then , but i was still certain someone was climbing in through my window . 
  it 's possible . 
  i 've had it several times now , and while i ca n't make the paralysis go away any faster just because i 'm aware of it , atleast the scary stuff is gone . 
  i just wake up and am like `` meh , here we go again '' and wait until i can move again and then go back to sleep . 
  the first time i had sp i felt as i could n't breath ( because of the demon dude pressing down on my chest ) , but that was the only time i had problems breathing . 
  i have a weird relationship to paris . 
  i 've been there three times now , and every time i 'm there i just want to leave - but every time i leave i kinda miss it . 
  when you 're in the capital it could be nice to visit [ old town ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gamla_stan ) , [ stockholm palace ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stockholm_palace ) ( changing of the guards is popular ) , [ skansen ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/skansen ) and the [ nordic museum ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nordic_museum ) to name a few . 
  i do n't know how much time you 'll have on your hands but those are probably among the most popular places to visit . 
  there 's an amusement park called gr\u00f6na lund which could be fun as well , depending on weather i suppose . 
  you have to be 18 to drink alcohol so bars/clubs are not an option i 'm afraid . 
  the archipelago is beautiful , but i do n't know how expensive or time-consuming it would be to go sightseeing with a boat , since i 've never been a tourist in my own town . 
  i do know there are hop-on hop-off boats , and people going around selling tickets to those who you could ask about that . 
   isis is ` good ' in the sense that it fights syrian president assad ,, 
  this is obviously just a matter of which stance you have towards the syrian conflict . 
  however , even if you hate assad and support the opposition , isis are among the most genuinly * fucked up * people walking this planet , and if dying is the only thing that might make them go away then kill them fucking all , because it will make the world a better place . 
  also , not even the opposition in syria agrees with isis , and there are internal fights between , for example , fsa , al-nusra and isis . 
  worth mentioning is that al-nusra is allied to al-qaeda , and * still * even * they * think isis are too fucked . 
  if isis would gain any kind of control over syria it will make it infinitely worse than it ever was under assad 's regime . 
  the * vasa museum * could be worth mentioning , though . 
  i forgot that one . 
  joke 's on you , jag f\u00e5r aldrig sex !, 
  haha !, 
  this does n't belong anywhere . 
  just delete it from fucking existence . 
  as long as we have time for a fika, 
  most of the times it 's a very limited knowledge of the second language after english as well ( german spanish french ) . 
  i studied german about 2hrs every week for 6-7 years in school but never use it , so i 've forgotten most of it . 
  i can understand basic german when spoken to or if i read it , but i would n't be able to speak it for shit . 
  the irish during [ the siege of jadotville ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/siege_of_jadotville ) in congo were the coolest . 
  `` the besieged irish radioed to their headquarters : `` we will hold out until our last bullet is spent . 
  could do with some whiskey '' . 
  i 'm swedish so obviously my favourite songs are on the carolus rex album . 
  but other than those , * the price of a mile * is my favourite as well . 
  i guess you listen to the english version ? 
  the swedish one has even better lyrics on most songs . 
  on the second throw , do the guy with the bat hit the other guys ' hand with the bat ? 
  is that normal in baseball ? 
  i 'm not american so naturally i never ever watch baseball so i have no clue . 
  it feels like a lot of hands must break in baseball . 
  f.\u00f6 . 
  gold after 9 minutes , that 's the fastest one i 've seen so far, 
  i work at the swedish probation and prison service ( kriminalv\u00e5rden ) , i can safely say that the vast majority of criminals i see everyday are immigrants ( i 'm not going to comment on rapists because i rarely meet any ) , but when it comes to crime in general sweden is probably still one of the safer countries on earth in my opinion . 
  i 'm 21 and i 've been robbed twice , but both time i was younger , drunk out of my mind and alone on empty streets ( which i 've been * several * times , so it 's still not * normal * to be robbed just because you 're in that state ) . 
  but of course it 's still positive not to be traveling alone on empty and dark streets late at night - especially if you 're drunk . 
  seriously it feels like i 'm taking crazy pills when reading this thread . 
  am i the only one who gets attacked by these fuckers basically everytime i 'm in deep water ? 
  [ yesterday in sweden as well ] ( http://www.expressen.se/nyheter/vakt-svimmade--foll-rakt-i-gruset-fore-dopet/ ) ( article in swedish but the video will show you enough ) . 
  i did basic with the royal guards so i know several people there , from what i 've heard he 'd been ill , so the warmth and standing with that strict posture for a long time was too much for him - like it would 've been for anyone . 
  this was during the baptism of princess leonore yesterday . 
  that was a better answer than i ever expected . 
  ** carl larsson-g\u00e5rden ** ( the carl larsson garden ) . 
  home of famous 19th century swedish artist carl larsson and his family , the house has been open for tourists to visit . 
  the house is located in the beautiful village sundborn , about 20 minutes with bus from falun . 
  it 's open everyday from may to september , with several guided tours each day . 
  more info at www.clg.se, 
  just make sure you know when the last bus of the day go back to falun . 
  pretty sure they got a corey ... 
  to be fair they have hundreds of these threads every week , and it 's always trolls . 
  then it turns out that one guy that one time was n't a troll , and everyone are like `` omg 4chan 's fault fucking psychopaths '' . 
  it 's like you had a friend who 's been jokingly telling you for years that he 's gon na kill himself , at first you 're like `` do n't talk like that , man '' , but then you realize it 's just his thing to say stuff like that , it does n't have any meaning , because he seems just like your avarage bloke . 
  then one normal day he 's like `` oh man jason fucked me up on call of duty i 'm gon na fucking kill myself lol  '' and you 're like `` yeah man sure whatever '' , and then he actually kills himself - and everyone are like `` omg wtf this is fucking / u/poor _ holy_shit 's fault fucking psycho wanting people to kill themselves '' . 
  y' kno, 
  edit : by the way i 'm not really * defending * their actions , but on a site where everyone constantly cries wolf , someone is bound to be eaten and it 's not really the town people 's fault . 
  on the plus side there 's always the few who tracks down the posters ip and notify police if it actually seems like it 's someone serious . 
  sadly not always fast enough . 
  i 'm not totally sure about the entire country , but atleast in stockholm and a few other cities , kids who graduate from high school gets these trucks ( called studentflak ) that they ride around on through the city blasting music and drinking/showering in beer to celebrate . 
  [ here 's a video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fodnswy3ky#t=314 ), 
  there 's a lot of mixed feelings about this `` tradition '' ( it 's not that old ) , and whether it should continue to be allowed or not , but i 'm sure everyone who did it thought it was a lot of fun . 
  i did . 
  the thing about this post is that usually you are 40-100 people on one `` studentflak '' , whereas this guy is totally alone . 
  but it 's just a marketing trick for his new song . 
  there are companies that offer these services , so there are never students driving , but `` professional drivers '' . 
  there are usually also another guy in the front seat from the company making sure the students are n't making too much fuckery like throwing beer at people on the street etc , or they get kicked off . 
  plus they require someone in the back of the truck to be 25 + and sober to keep some kind of order . 
  most students does n't get too drunk either since after the `` studentflak '' , you go home and have a gathering with friends and family , and it 's kinda awkward to be drunk out of your mind when you 're constantly center of attention at the party . 
  but , yes , many see it as stupid and childish , which i can understand . 
  order ( idk if you can get it in ny ) some [ nubbe/snaps ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/snaps ) online , make a traditional swedish midsummer meal and learn a few swedish `` snaps songs '' . 
  or drive to maine and pretend it 's sweden - the nature is pretty much the same ( depending where in sweden your gf is from though ), 
  this was very interesting to see , as i am a correctional officer ( kriminalv\u00e5rdare ) in sweden . 
  it seems like sweden and finland are pretty much alike when it comes to prison and probation service , atleast in termes of quality . 
  thanks op, 
  i 'm sorry but that 's hilarious . 
  swedish recruits are normally given the red dot right away . 
  source : have been swedish recruit . 
  i do n't know why these guys are n't using the red dot , but there are a few explenations . 
  the most reasonable is that their officers wanted them to be just as good with iron sight as with the red dot i guess .
