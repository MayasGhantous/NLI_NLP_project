  some might get angry at me for saying this , because i 've never been poor , and even though i 'm new to this job , i 've seen enough to realize that many of them are just weak and stupid . 
  for heavens ' sake , if you are fucked up enough to shoot a fully automatic 7.62 mm ak47 into a bunch of innocent people outside a hot dog stand because there 's * one * member of a rival gang in the line , you ca n't blame that shit because you grew up in a low income suburb outside stockholm , you 're just a weak person . 
  there are many who have it a lot worse who still chose a right path in life , these kids just think they are worth all the riches in the world , and they do n't give a shit about how they are gon na get it . 
  that being said , do n't think i do n't have respect for these people . 
  i treat them as i would any human being , because that 's what they are . 
  and i hope , and i 'm sure , that many of them can eventually turn their lives around and realize what they 're doing is n't worth it . 
  edit : spelling . 
  probably some more words i 've spelled wrong because i 've been drinking quite a bit of whiskey tonight and english obviously is n't my irst language . 
  ~ ~ pioneers , not engineers . ~ ~, 
  also , if anyone noticed that they were walking pretty slowly , they were . 
  ffl march in 88 paces per minute instead of the standard 120 . 
  i see , my bad . 
  i thought they were two different units . 
  this is n't that weird , though . 
  i imagine the surviving gunners just clinging as hard as they can to whatever they were holding on to at the time of the colision , which just happens to be their machine gun , with the finger on the trigger . 
  never forget . 
  i did basic training ( gmu ) at livgardet , but my platoons f\u00e4nrik ( second liutenant ) was a ranger from k3 . 
  he was badass . 
  he was joking . 
  thank you . 
  it was more annoying than i 'd like to admit . 
  what was going on at 05:30 ? 
  seemed more like a brawl between hooligans after a football game . 
  italy was part of the axis . 
  it 's a bit ironic that op is wearing a shirt supporting the country that his grandpa was in war with . 
  nothing wrong with it , just ironic to a certain degree as / u/catsrule362 said . 
  how someone can get only 15 years of prison for a completely unprovoked murder and attempted murder of two young men is beyond me .

  does n't look very brown or dried up for me . 
  i agree , they are the shit . 
  never seen that one before . 
  pretty cool . 
  you can open it near my house anyday . 
  i love me some surstr\u00f6mming . 
  as someone who does n't have english as a first language , til draught is pronounced like `` draft '' and not `` drought '' . 
  thanks , will save me from further embarrassing myself when ordering beer . 
  my older sister has misophonia , there are * a lot * of sounds and repetative movement i ca n't do around her or it 'll trigger her misophonia . 
  i feel really bad for her , and other who has it , because they just ca n't do anything about it except close their eyes and cover their ears . 
  she explained it to me that when someone repeats a sound/movement that triggers it , it 's pretty much like someone is poking her with a pen in the ribs over and over and over . 
  it 's impossible to ignore . 
  now , i 'm not saying your family members have misophonia - i 'm just saying that this is the reason some people seem to overreact so drastically over things that we do n't think about at all - and often they do n't even know themselves they have it , they just think they 're being unreasonably oversensitive , without a clue it 's actually a kind of condition . 
  tl ; dr : condition that make people * extremely * sensitive to repetitive sounds and movement . 
  i usually pronounce it as `` kernal '' and `` liutanent '' , rather than colonel and leftenant . 
  obviously a lot of sounds and repetitive movements are generally considered annoying . 
  but when you have this , by me and many others considered a condition , it 's * far * more than annoying . 
  like i said , it 's like being repeatedly stabbed by a pen in the ribs . 
  not impolite , but impossible for me to answer because i 've never asked her what her sex life is like , 
  my sister went to a doctor and got it diagnosed ( in sweden ) . 
  another redditor suggest a psychiatrist instead of a doctor , though , so you could try that as well . 
  i thought the sneak class in dark messiah : might and magic was really fun . 
  it was released almost 8 years ago , but the graphics are still pretty good imo . 
  this obviously is n't a shooter , though , it 's fantasy . 
  not as an ordinary visitor . 
  the museum has had over 20 million visitors since it 's opening in 1990 , so if they all were allowed onboard it would cause too much damage to it . 
  however , you can pay to become a gold member of the museum , and after two years of membership you can book a guided tour in the actual ship . 
  after that , you can do it every seven year ( of continous membership ) . 
  it only cost 300sek ( 43 dollars ) per year for gold membership so it 's not very expensive at all . 
  nope . 
  too many would do that . 
  urin for a treat, 
  no it 's another soldier at his left firing his weapon . 
  you can briefly see the barrel of the gun and the case from the bullet flying past the camera if you look in slow-mo . 
  hooray hooray we get tear gas today, 
  i remember a few years ago i saw a dad ( whom i assume was either a single dad or the parents were just divorced ) with his goth daughter at an airport in sweden . 
  the dad had booked them a flight to mallorca and you could see he just wanted to spend some time with her , but she was furious about it . 
  you could see how sad he was about her being the opposite of excited , and he kept trying to make her happy about it , saying things like `` it will be fun honey , we will spend every day at the beach and the pool . 
  youll get a really nice tan ! '', 
  but she just responded with `` i do n't want a fucking tan , dad ! '', 
  ( cuz goth i guess ) . 
  i obviously do n't know anything about their relationship , but i felt so fucking bad for that father . 
  it must be extremely hard to be a single parent with a child that 's so hard to understand . 
  time for the swedish armed forces to bring some welfare to north korea . 
  it 's a nato-operation and we 're not members of nato , plus we only contributed with ~ 1200 soldiers per year ( 600 at a time in 6-month-deployments ) , so it 's not weird if a lot of people do n't know that sweden was in afghanistan . 
  we left afghanistan this year for those who do n't know . 
  you want some welfare aswell ? 
  an islamic terrorist did try and blow himself up on the busiest stockholm street during a christmas rush in 2010 , fortunately his device failed and he only killed himself ( so , i mean , he did manage to blow * himself * up ) . 
  it has been estimated that if he had succeeded around 200 people could 've died . 
  but that 's not the reason we were in afghanistan . 
  f.\u00f6 . 
  does n't it say at the back of the can how strong it is ? 
  often does . 
  i guess it 's in swedish , but you should be able to figure it out anyway . 
  tumblr, 
  ingenting . 
  men , som sagt , spekulationer .

  i have been using it for six years now , have n't noticed a thing . 
  pretty sure smoking is worse to your teeth and gum than snus is . 
  i guess you 'd just have to do it again and film it . 
  oh man , now i 'm sad . 
  you 'll find time . 
  worst case you can do it when you 've retired . 
  it 's never too late . 
  i agree with you as well . 
  absolutely the worst south park episode made , and the only episode i hav n't watched several times again .
