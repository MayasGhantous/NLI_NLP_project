  yes . 
  i 've met him on the front page several times . 
  you write really weird, 
  ah , well , auto-correcting on phones is a bitch . 
  that is true , it 's not my first language for instance , - but i figured since he said his sister was in texas , he 'd be an american . 
  i see . 
  good luck with your sister by the way , i hope it turns out okay . 
  especially since marijuana really should be legal in my opinion ... 
  there is no country i want to visit as much as i want to visit ireland . 
  i 've been all around the world , but never to ireland - and while watching the game tonight , and hearing you sing , i figured it 's about damn time i go there . 
  the people seem amazing . 
  edit : by the way , how come everyone seem to know the lyrics for this ballad ? 
  what 's the story behind it ? 
  haha i see . 
  i 'm listening to the version by the dubliners right now , i must say it 's really good . 
  that 's another thing i like about ireland - this kind of music . 
  i once accidentally put glue in my friends hair . 
  he had to cut it off . 
  perhaps it would be wrong to take that in this thread as it would totally change the subject , but if you feel like you want to tell me i 'd love to hear . 
  i 'm really intrested in these kind of stories . 
  mainly because i plan to join the swedish armed forces next year and do a tour to some country myself when it will be needed , but also because they 're just plain intresting . 
  we tame our mooses for that . 
  [ here 's an example ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzebbz2irxe ), 
  vikings , and perhaps even egyptians , discovered america before columbus did . 
  ] ( http://originaldialogue.blogspot.se/2009/12/did-egyptians-discover-america-in-232.html ), 
  yeah he 's a dick . 
  i may not be a norwegian , but a swede , and therefore i too cheer for leif erickson . 
  vikings unite . 
  you have the bravest 6-year-old in the world . 
  i mean i usually scream like a 6-year-old when i encounter a snake . 
  that went through my mind aswell , - but i decided to go with brave . 
  australians . 
  same here . 
  she ussually came by my house and basically all we did was that we had sex , played some ps3 , had sex , watched a movie , had sex , took a shower , had sex etc etc. 
  needless to say i 'm still not over her . 
  well i for one prefer totally shaven . 
  especially when licking a girl . 
  i do n't wan na spend the rest of the day coughing up hair you know . 
  you would think that after 19 years on this planet you would 've heard of all existing countries . 
  i was wrong . 
  well ... 
  i just graduated from the swedish equivilent to high school and i have no money to spend on games , and no job . 
  plus many of my friends have gotten jobs or are traveling , so i have nothing to do during the days . 
  especially when the weather is as bad as it is right now . 
  also this is the kind of game i ussually enjoy so i 'd love to play it . 
  [ surstr\u00f6mming . 
  this swedish delicacy/traditional dish is growing old even here in sweden , and very few of my friends enjoy it . 
  but the tradition still grows strong in my family and every october we all gather with surstr\u00f6mming and [ snaps !, 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/snaps ), 
  it 's actually really good if you eat it the right way . 
  [ here 's ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7wjz2apwyk ) a video of foodforlouis eating it . 
  but he 's doing wrong . 
  i could n't watch that for some reason . 
  however i think a lot of people are familiar with the bag of milky way 's because of [ this video ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etlwbtz62z0 ) aswell , even though it is n't the original . 
  leave the hobo 's out of this !, 
  she could probably be sami aswell . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.samer.se/images/350px/3damer_350px_vsbm.jpg ) is how sami people with `` pure '' genes looks . 
  far from how the average scandinavian person looks as the sami has lived as far north as possible for thousands and thousands of years , and has n't really mixed their genes with people from further south until now . 
  you see , the last couple of hundred years the sami people were considered a lower form of people in scandinavia , and treated as such . 
  [ star wars episode vi - victory celebration ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mykotkkkhy&amp;feature=plcp ), 
  happiest fucking song there is . 
  [ good job . 
  english is n't my first language . 
  during the summer the sun basically does never go down in the most northern parts of scandinavia . 
  i live in stockholm , which is pretty far down south in sweden , and yesterday was `` solstillest\u00e5ndet '' as we call it . 
  the longest day every year . 
  even in stockholm it never got pitch black , but it was pretty dark at around 11.30 pm till 1.30 am . 
  in lappland , which is the furthest north you can get in sweden , the sun basically never even goes down . 
  in the winter however , in stockholm it can some days be pitch black from 16 pm to 9 am . 
  even worse further north . 
  i do n't smoke , i use [ snus ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/snus ) . 
  took my first one when i was 14 because i wanted to be `` cool '' . 
  now i use it because it helps me relax . 
  plus it has so many advantages compared to smoking . 
  you can use it everywhere anytime ( bars , planes , during classes and work etc , you do n't have to go outside because it bothers no one ) , it is faaaaar from as dangerous as smoking is , but a normal snus is still about 10x stronger than a normal cigarette . 
  i feel nothing after a cigarette . 
  edit : seriously people , use snus instead of cigarettes . 
  this creeped me out . 
  i figure 9gag would enjoy this more . 
  this guy has already been on the front page atleast five times , and been posted to reddit thousands of times . 
  yes , he 's awesome , but shit 's getting old . 
  we have that in swedish aswell , ` skadegl\u00e4dje ' . 
  but there probably is no english word for it . 
  though i believe it is possible to use the german version , schadenfreude , in english actually . 
  that title would be more fitting for some kind of messed up porno . 
  he really need to get his shit together . 
  the sooner the better . 
  as we sing in the swedish national anthem `` jag vill leva , jag vill d\u00f6 , i norden '' , which in english would be `` i want to live , i want to die , in the north/scandinavia '' ( can mean both , but as you said we often say norden instead of scandinavia ) . 
  this was confirmed fake about a week ago . 
  now i have to keep my feets high above ground for atleast an hour . 
  first , this was stolen from a comment some guy made in a thread here on reddit about a week ago . 
  second , this picture has already been posted . 
  so much anger in only one man . 
  that may be correct . 
  however , in swedish you never say `` slutet '' at the end of a story/movie . 
  you always say `` slut '' . 
  actually there is something called [ snuff ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/snuff ) which you snort ( not to be confused with [ snus ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/snus ) which is sometimes refered to as ` swedish snuff ' ) . 
  it is not perticulary common in any country i know of , but a friend of mine found some of it when he was in germany - and another friend of mine actually made snuff of his own - but that was pretty shitty . 
  it often has `` taste '' like mint to it , so it 's actually quite nice to snort . 
  makes everything smell minty .
