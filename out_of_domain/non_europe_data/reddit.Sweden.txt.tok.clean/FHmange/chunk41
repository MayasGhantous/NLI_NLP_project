   abundant alcohol , drugs , gambling , and prostitutes . 
  * sweet *, 
  what is that thing they 're playing with anyway ? 
  edit : well , seeing how fun they apparently are , i 'm now a bit jelous we did n't have them in sweden . 
  atleast not when/where i grew up . 
  some more pictures from the event . 
  also maybe should 've mentioned in the title that this is in stockholm , more precisely at the stockholm palace . 
  photos are taken by petter persson from the swedish armed forces . 
  i have milder paruresis , i suppose you could say . 
  it 's impossible for me to pee in a close proximity to people , or trying to go in a public restroom even if it 's empty , knowing someone can enter at any moment . 
  behind a locked door usually is n't a problem though , even in public , unless someone keeps banging on the door or w/e . 
  ca n't go with someone close to me ( like at another bush a few meters away ) even if it 's one of my best mates i 've known for alomst 20 years . 
  anyway , i do n't know how basic is in your country , but when i did basic training in sweden it was never a real problem for me . 
  all the toilets at the barracks had doors with locks , and if i had to go out in the field i was almost always able to go far away enough and behind a tree for no one to see me or have to worry about anyone walking `` in on me '' when i went . 
  sometimes i did have to go when i knew others could see me , even if they were pretty far away ( which otherwise would be basically impossible for me ) but in a way the uniform and all the equipment you carried and made you look like everyone else , often helped me being able to pee in those situations . 
  the only time i can remember not being able to go was on the first day , when we were given a really short time for the whole platoon to take a toilet break . 
  like 10 minutes for 45 guys sharing 2 toilets or something . 
  even though i could lock the door , the knowledge of all these people behind me that i did not know , and the stress that they all wanted to get in quick , was enough for me not being able to go . 
  but i think that 's the only time i ran into any problem during my basic . 
  would make for some interesting / r/combatfootage, 
  probably because most people do n't have a masters degree in the first chechen war , and for most people this picture looks like it could 've been from the first chechen war ? 
  99 % of people who come here do it to see some combat footage , not research every single post . 
  i 'd tell you to get off your high horse but they do n't make ladders that tall . 
  because they look like one would ( or could ) expect chechen militia to look . 
  sure it 's strange that it takes place in a stadium , but as i said , most people are n't scholars in the first chechen war so they ca n't possible know that this event took place years later . 
  you must 've missed a word or two in your question because i do n't understand it . 
  what is it you do n't understand ? 
  this picture looks 100 % like it * could * be from the first chechen war , so there is nothing strange about people believing it is , especially since it 's what the title claims . 
  now it so happens that it is n't from the first chechen war , but how can you expect everyone to know that ? 
  it 's ridiculous . 
   and 0 % from the second ? 
  just why ? 
  what even is that argument ? 
  i 've never claimed so . 
  are you actually not understanding my point ? 
  you said op idiotically said it was first chechen war , and sure , he 's wrong in that ( does n't necessarily make him an idiot tho ) . 
  but you also ask why it 's so heavily upvoted , and that 's what i explained to you . 
  it *** looks *** like it could 've been from the first chechen war . 
  it also *** looks *** like it could 've been from the second , but that has nothing to do with this so i do n't know why you brought it up . 
  i hope this will create some nostalgia for all on here who have been in the military . 
  especially other swedes . 
  i took this one evening when we were released early , during my basic training in 2013 . 
  as you can see some of my mates decided to finally get some longer sleep than we were used to , while others did some pt or went to buy some snacks in the regiment 's kiosk . 
  in basic when we were on base we lived in rooms with our squad , about 10 people . 
  it looks almost identical in every room all around sweden , no matter what regiment or branch you are in . 
  basically it 's the lockers that may differ . 
  the bathroom was shared with the rest of the platoon , and it was 4 toilettes , 4 showers and a long sink ( like 6m ) , where we could shave and brush our teeth etc. 
  how did you live in the country you served ? 
  damn , i guess full metal jacket/jarhead etc gives a fairly realistic picture of marine boot camp then , huh ? 
  i honestly ca n't complain at all when it comes to our living quality on base . 
  we were allowed to keep a lot of personal items in the lockers , phones included , and could use them whenever we were released for the day . 
  but obviously the free time was extremely scarce , and most days were n't spent on base except to sleep and eat breakfast . 
  usually when we got released we only had time to polish our boots and then go to bed . 
  but still , it was some freedom to be able to keep civilian items . 
  we even had a room with a couple of sofas and a tv that was shared by the company , but it was basically never used since there was no time . 
  my guess is that it lives on from conscription times , which ended just 2-3 years before i did my basic training . 
  since they were technically ( not so much during the last years of conscription ) forced to be there , they were probably given these bonuses so it would n't be as `` inhumane '' to force someone to give 9 months of their life to the military . 
  `` never give up '' is the last stage of the current swedish military basic training . 
  the basic training itself is 3 months , and the `` never give up '' phase is a 7-9 days field exercise which sucks . 
  i guess it 's the swedish equivalent to hell week . 
  these recruits come from the `` life guard '' ( * livgardet * ) regiment , a light mechanized infantry regiment . 
  honestly , we were issued way too much shit to be able to keep it on our beds or in a single footlocker . 
  3 uniform sets , winter gear , field gear , combat gear , etc. 
  it barely fit in the lockers we had , but it still had to look tidy and organized in the exact same way in everyone 's locker ( one part of the lockers were for civilian stuff , though . 
  the officers did n't give a shit about how it looked in there but it was n't allowed to keep military gear in that part of the locker , so it was a lot of wasted space ) . 
  as you can see we kept some stuff outside the lockers when we slept , so it would dry easier overnight . 
  but when morning came nothing was allowed outside of the lockers . 
  ah well , if it 's one thing i learned in basic it 's that nothing is impossible , and if you think something wo n't fit , all it needs is a little more violence . 
  i think they do in most western countries today tbh, 
  & gt ; holy shit your barracks is giving me anxiety . 
  haha , we were allowed to keep undershirts and socks etc out of the lockers overnight so they 'd dry easier , since it was so cramped in the lockers . 
  we always woke up one hour before breakfast to clean the room to the last speck of dust , and make our beds perfectly . 
  sometimes the officer in charge that morning would bring a boiled egg and roll on the floor to see if there were any dirt on it . 
  if it were , we had to redo the entire room . 
  or they 'd bring a coin and drop on the blanked ( which we have to stretch out in a certain way ) and if then coin did n't bounce because it was n't stretched well enough , we had to redo all beds , etc. 
  no need for anxiety , it only looked like this when we were alone during the night . 
  while i suspected they 'd take away our phones completely when we got there , i was n't shocked to learn we got to keep them in our lockers . 
  while i see the idea behind not allowing phones at all , i do n't think it disturbed training in any way . 
  we were n't allowed to have them on us during the days on base and we were n't allowed to bring them when we had field exercises where we left the base . 
  the small amount of time between being released and going to bed is the only time we 'd be able to check them , which was nice since you could check up on family and friends and check your mail/pay bills etc. 
  yeah we did . 
  but it was pretty small , barely enough for everyone to fit their uniform jackets . 
  so , obviously we had to prioritize what went into the drying room and what we hung on our beds etc. 
  depends what branch and regiment you apply to . 
  basic training for the home guard ( reserve force ) has pretty relaxed requirements to get in , an lower than average 18 year old would make it with no problem . 
  rangers/marines have the hardest , obviously , but i do n't know what exact requirements they have . 
  iirc most regular infantry units had a minimum requirement to make the beep-test to at least 10.2 or something like that , being able to hang static with your chin above a bar for at least 45 sec , being able to run 2km with full combat gear in somewhere around 10 min ( 8-12 i do n't remember ) and a certain number push-ups and sit-ups but i do n't remember what the minimum was for everything . 
  12 weeks . 
  while we may have had some higher living standards on base than in the us , believe me , being allowed to have your phone in your locker does n't make basic training a dance on roses . 
  it only looked like this during the night when we hung stuff so they could dry . 
  we spent an hour cleaning our room/hallway/bathroom each morning , and if the officers found a speck of dust or a wrinkly blanket we had to do it all over . 
  have you done basic training ? 
  being allowed to keep a phone in your locker to look at 5 min every other day does n't really make it easy , and being without it is not what would make basic hard . 
  i know military stuff always turn into pissing contests , but it 's pretty ridiculous with all the americans in here being `` wow you had a phone , so easy '' . 
  it 's a goddamn phone , not a care package . 
  9 months was standard for most . 
  it was longer for rangers/ncos/reserve officers etc, 
  the sodomy is just another bonus in my book, 
  yeah i 'm honestly surprised how many americans are reacting about the phone rather than the room . 
  if i had to choose between our smaller rooms without a phone or your big sleeping halls with my phone , i 'd throw it out of the window in a heartbeat .
