  `` women have always been the primary victims of war . 
  women lose their husbands , their fathers , their sons in combat . '', 
  same in sweden . 
  i ca n't find any picture of swedish `` swat '' ( * nationella insatsstyrkan * ) in jeans right now , but i am 100 % i 've seen it . 
  i did however find [ this one ] ( https://i.imgur.com/rtzq8u7.jpg ) , of a cop ( center ) wearing `` workers trousers '' ( no idea what they 're called in english ), 
  / r/hmmm, 
  he is talking about meatballs . 
  he was probably about to start saying `` meatballs '' but changed his mind the second he started pronouncing the word . 
  i 'm not a native english speaker so i 'm no expert , but it does n't seem too off to me . 
  like if you 're about to say meatball , but the * exact * moment your lips start to form the word you change your mind , you 've just gotten to the `` mmm '' - part , if you get what i mean ... and it 's very natural for people to , when they start saying one thing but changer their minds , throw in a quick `` uh '' , which might be why it sounds like he 's saying `` muh '' , because he 's literally like `` m. . uh '' . 
  not funhaus, 
  i actually think all movies were pretty good . 
  live stuff is n't great , though . 
  may very well be . 
  i was in duskwood when they ran past about 30 minutes ago , and then it crashed 5 mins ago . 
  they were . 
  i saw atleast 60 hordes running together through raven hill in duskwood , and i 'm sure more came after that group . 
  apparently they summoned a bunch of people when they arrived at stormwind too . 
  like many arenas , friends arena is also very often used for concerts and whatnot . 
  i suppose that 's one of the reasons . 
  i logged in about 20 minutes ago , been lagging like hell all the time . 
  i have 20ms but there 's a 3-7 sec delay on anything i do . 
  a server reset would be good ... 
  not safe for white people, 
  check her post history ( nsfw ) . 
  that 's why people know who she is, 
  i guess in a way i should be thankful for my fear of heights . 
  i would never , even when i was a teenager , do stupid shit like lifting the safety bar or throw snowballs . 
  i just sit there and pray the lift wo n't stop while i 'm too far up . 
  and therefore i never got close to falling off a lift .

  hehe a couple of years ago my neighbors cat wondered into my house in the middle of the night . 
  i thought `` hey , in all cartoons cats love milk so i 'll give him a bowl '' . 
  he slurped some milk and then was on his way . 
  i hope the cat did n't get sick , but in a way it 'd be pretty funny if my neighbor woke up to their cat shitting everywhere because of my incompetence with cats . 
  yeah , i know , that 's exactly the issue . 
  if you start running with the loot screen up , it should automatically close after a few meters . 
  what ? 
  i do n't understand your point . 
  imagine standing irl , looking into your backpack , and someone start shooting at you . 
  is your reaction to start running while you keep looking through your bag ? 
  if it is , you 'll be dead as fuck in a real life apocalypse . 
  and , if you 're in a vehicle it obviously would n't close since that would be retarded . 
  do n't break an arm jerking yourself off, 
  is \u00df actually in the alphabet ? 
  one time this was posted and the same question was asked , someone said something about not wanting a bunch of dust in the air while filming . 
  do n't remember exactly what the guy said , but it seemed logical when he explained it . 
  m ` monarch, 
  hehe . 
  i did mean the hole in the fences . 
  they are big enough for a person to fit through , but at the moment the game do n't allow you to go through them . 
  and you ca n't jump over the fence either , which make it even more annoying that these holes are there , laughing in your face . 
  lol . 
  look at every single country ever that has embraced communism , and how it turned out . 
  that 's why people mind it . 
  the ideology in theory is fine , it just does n't work out in the real world . 
  `` and jump too ? '', 
  `` ok thx good ama '', 
  it 's probably more of a pissing contest than anything else . 
  it 's photoshopped . 
  the original says `` sipping on white tears '' and it 's clear water in the glass . 
  i marked this as nsfw as some of the people you see in this picture might be dead .

  if your aim was to take on the `` alt-smart '' ( hurr durr everyone who do n't support large-scale immigration from mena as much as me is a nazi ) , this probably was n't the best post to do it on . 
  whether or not they are refugees , they are still immigrants or `` foreigners '' . 
  so anyone who * actually is * alt-right would n't care anyway . 
  not like you really proved any point that would make an alt-right rethink their opinions . 
  i 'm mainly surprised an ex-mormon is welcome to keep living in that town , seeing how hundreds of males supposedly have been banished for breaking the rules of their church . 
  conscripted teens with a couple weeks training , most likely . 
  and most of the training was beating discipline into them , not teaching them how to fight . 
  check ur prejudices, 
  who the f goes into a building and immediately start loading a crossbow ? 
  at least do a quick sweep of the room with your loaded weapon first, 
  anytime , friendo !, 
  there 's a nice way to do that, 
  how, 
  few things make me more irrationally annoyed than youtube-videos where they do n't list the songs they use , and do n't respond in the comments when asked . 
  wait , this was n't a parody with an actor who looked identical to cantwell ? 
  what the fuck, 
  lots of people actually do call the russian separatists terrorists . 
  just read basically any thread on any subreddit that 's related to the conflict in ukraine . 
  barbarer . 
  iljm, 
  seriously . 
  if you 're gon na stream with no delay , accept the consequences . 
  the big streamers get a lot of perks by streaming with no delay too , several times i 've seen streamers being shot at and not realize where it 's from - so they ask the chat `` where did that come from ? '' . 
  or they kill someone and are not sure if they want to risk looting the body , so they ask `` did anyone see what level helmet/backpack did the guy have ? '', 
  then they have the audacity to complain about being stream snipes . 
  such little children . 
  sure , give stream snipers a couple of hours ban , i do n't mind that . 
  it 's still entirely the streamers fault for letting it happen . 
  also , the biggest problem is that people are getting banned left and right with literally no evidence of stream sniping , it 's just the streamers who cry to the devs when they die `` suspiciously '' , and the devs are being pussies . 
  the comment was that the perpetrators mainly associate with others in the muslim community . 
  none of what you said disprove that theory . 
  that said , i understand what you 're saying . 
  many terrorists in europe have lived their entire lives in the country in which they commit their act of terror - and often `` started being muslims '' just a few years before becoming radicalized and start killing people . 
  [ # 4 top voted post on this subreddit ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/pubattlegrounds/comments/6q0otl/duo_partner_banned_for_7_days_for_stream_sniping/ ) . 
  i 've seen more examples in different threads about this happening , but i have n't saved them . 
  there are also clips from grimmmz , shroud and other big streamers when they tell their chat to essentially witch hunt and report players who `` obviously was stream sniping '' , plus they send clips directly to the devs and ask for the player to be banned ( and often the devs comply ) .
