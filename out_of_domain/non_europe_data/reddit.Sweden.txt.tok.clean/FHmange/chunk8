  especially when you 're under 20 . 
  trust me , i 'm a 19 year old swede living in stockholm , it sucks . 
  do n't come to stockholm expecting to have a fun night out if you 're under 21 and do n't want to spend money on extreme prices . 
  however , if you go to the bars not aimed for kids ( 18-20ish ) , and can agree on spending $ 9 ~ on each beer , you can probably have a pretty good time with nice bartenders and people . 
  edit : sorry for your bad experience by the way , i love meeting tourists in stockholm when i 'm out . 
  i always have a blast when i do . 
  oh ... then you probably just had some bad luck . 
  my experiences in small towns in sweden is almost always good when it comes to bars etc - unless the bartenders hate people from stockholm , like some do . 
  usually they 're very kind in the smaller places in sweden . 
  anyway , as i said , sorry for your bad experience , i hope you atleast had some other fun experiences on your trip to sweden . 
  and [ this ] ( http://imgur.com/ye4ks ) is the first ticket , ever . 
  ah , shit , i messed up . 
  should i delete it ? 
  misleading information is n't good for anyone . 
  i 'm trully sorry for previous post where i wrote opening of disneyland , 1955 . 
  i had the wrong information . 
  this is disneyworld , opened 1971 . 
  thanks to / u/boppa30 and / u/time93 for correcting me . 
  guilty, 
  ah too bad , there were some cool ones in that thread, 
  anyway it usually pops up a thread like that once a week or so , just keep your eyes open , 
  sorry my man , english is n't my first language . 
  in swedish , when there 's two words like that , we put them together as one, 
  who does n't ? 
  as a straight man i 'd still be flattered as shit and feel pretty awesome . 
  he lives ( fully recovered ) , and is currently chief of police in orland park , illinois . 
  in sweden , you can only buy alcohol stronger than 3.5 % at stores owned by the state , called `` systembolaget '' ( this was to minimize alcohol consumption in sweden ) . 
  since there are n't that many of these stores , and most swedes are fond of drinking , lines can get pretty long at days such as new years eve . 
  and that is what you see here !, 
  td ; dr : swedes buying alcohol for new years eve, 
  he probably wants to work, 
  someone really oughta slap some humour into that woman, 
  i 'm terrible at explaining the meaning of words , but if i 'm not mistaking , `` orka '' is a word that do n't exist in english . 
  it 's a word for expressing that you 're too tired to do something , or just do n't feel like it . 
  i believe you say `` i ca n't be bothered '' in english , whereas in swedish you simply say `` jag orkar inte '' ( i * orkar * not ) , or , if you 're really lazy , you can just say `` orka '' . 
  it 's not really correct swedish i suppose , but it 's common , especially among youths . 
  example :, 
  `` wan na go play football ? '', 
  yes , that too . 
  but i think mostly brits use that one , right ? 
  i remember when i was playing wow people always said `` cba '' ( ca n't be arsed ) , but when i 've been touristing in other countries in europe , north america , north africa and asia , `` ca n't be bothered '' is the one i 've heard the most . 
  thus i picked that one in my explenation . 
  if i were you , i 'd tell them to stop . 
  i know how was phone, 
  actually it escalated during the course of several months ... 
  indeed, 
  an ex of mine said she was gon na take a shower everytime she had to poop . 
  i never asked her , but i knew . 
  when i first figured it out i thought it was kinda cute , in a weird way . 
  not everyone on reddit has english as first language you know . 
  good point, 
  or the vikings, 
  sorry man , this was on the frontpage just a couple of hours ago . 
  and it was a repost that time also . 
  good luck man, 
  or maybe op is just a stinking liar, 
  you 're a nice guy, 
  le gem, 
  damn , nz seems like such a cool country . 
  think i 'm gon na move there in a few years . 
  i 'm swedish . 
  is racism a common thing in nz ? 
  i 've been here for more than a year . 
  still trying to find it . 
  [ high frequency active auroral research program ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/high_frequency_active_auroral_research_program ) i guess, 
  i do n't know , man . 
  i just googled haarp to see what it was . 
  anyway , you never know with those damn danes . 
  how are you oa for watching your so shower , though ? 
  personally i just ca n't stand apple pie . 
  i feel sick when i eat it . 
  the only other person i 've met that seem to agree with me is my grandpa . 
  i agree . 
  well , to be fair , this is a tram . 
  they run very quiet and are normally not allowed to go faster than ~ 50 km/hr . 
  probably a lot safer than living next to a road where cars are allowed to go as fast . 
  scandinavian bro do you even sauna ? 
  not really . 
  just chaos as all cars need to switch lanes at the same, 
  time, 
  not really . 
  personally ( as a swede ) i think they 're absolutely fantastic . 
  it was the swedish parliament ( riksdag ) that approved it , even though it was very unpopular amongst the citizen . 
  however , i * think * ( i have no source ) it 's been proven that right side driving is better/safer than left , so it had to be done sooner or later i guess . 
  if it makes you feel any better you 're more than welcome to clarify it . 
  i 'm truly sorry for my english not being 100 % perfect . 
  you see , i 'm swedish , and therefore english is n't my first language . 
  i gave it my best , sorry it was n't enough . 
  yes , there is . 
  but if you look closely you can see a swedish flag a couple of meters behind it . 
  i can assure you that this is kungsgatan in stockholm . 
  i 've been there hundreds of times . 
  unfortunately i 'm not entirely sure why the flag is there ... 
  edit : f.\u00f6 . 
  i would n't say it is . 
  if you look at [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkh_gkl4vn0 ) tv ad , they continue by saying `` we are defending human rights in war-torn countries '' . 
  i think you should read it like you put weight on you and we . 
  `` what are *** you *** doing ? '', 
  '' *** we *** are defending human rights in war-torn countries '' . 
  it may be a bit provocative , but i do n't think they mean it like `` what the hell is wrong with you '' .
