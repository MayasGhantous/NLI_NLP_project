  rather `` you should stop and think about what you are doing , when so much bad is going on in the world '' . 
  atleast that 's how i understand the ads . 
  somewhere in sweden i guess . 
  ca n't find the exact location, 
  i 'm surprised this post has n't gotten more attention . 
  i certainly enjoyed watching it !, 
  sure does n't look like it, 
  did your teeth make it ? 
  gebirgsjaeger is mountain ranger for anyone wondering . 
  he is kind of short . 
  but , to be fair , the man at his left looks very tall , around 200cm, 
  edit : words, 
  i guess what could 've happened is that this was a bit staged , and he fired his javelin at an eod bot that was right at his feets ... just a theory though , it 's probably not even possible to fire a javelin at an object so close to you . 
  anyway it gave me a good laugh !, 
  edit : i guess my theory has been proven wrong, 
  not on this subreddit i believe . 
  actually sweden would n't out-smug anyone . 
  ever heard of [ law of jante ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/law_of_jante ) ( or ` jantelagen ' as we say in sweden ) ? 
  it 's basically a cultural norm in scandinavia that we are never to think that we are any better than anyone else . 
  i sometimes work on this street , just past those rocks . 
  beautiful view of stockholm from there . 
  it 's interesting you want to move here when i so badly want to move to nz . 
  wan na trade places ? 
  mainly because of your extremely cool and beautiful nature . 
  the fact that you can basically go skiing , surfing and trekking in jungles , forests and plains on the same day . 
  mind blowing . 
  sure , sweden has great nature aswell , - i love our mountains , archipelago and great forests , but nz feels like a totally different league . 
  plus , from what i 've heard , the people of nz seem very friendly , and you seem to have a good government etc. 
  m39 emr with iron sight look incredible . 
  m249 saw with iron sight is also a beauty, 
  allegedly my family is in some way related to king gustav i of sweden ( aka gustav vasa ) , probably the most famous king of sweden for most swedes . 
  * but * i ca n't show any proof of this . 
  yeah i have my doubts aswell . 
  unfortunatly my grandpa is dead now so i ca n't ask him for any details , but i think he went through churches and websites etc. 
  we do n't , sorry . 
  however , our little brother , norway , has a lot of oil , and also a lot of atleast as beautiful women as we do . 
  so , you know , go catch 'em buddy, 
  i see no reason why guidetti should n't be the one playing when it comes to friendly matches , though, 
  no , but was sick for some time last year . 
  healed now though . 
  have in mind that he 's still only 20 ... 
  i think we should give him chances to play during friendly matches , to make him comfortable in the blue and yellow . 
  as a swede i felt the same . 
  never seen it before in english , and thought it only existed in swedish . 
  what 's weirder though is how genuinly shocked i was . 
  it was like if i had stumbled upon some great ancient secrets or something . 
  hold on to her , man . 
  i had a girlfriend just like that , and i loved her as hell , but eventually started taking her for granted etc , so she left . 
  needless to say , after almost a year , i 'm still not even close to being over her . 
  i 'm guessing it 's [ this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slpfu1kptfs ), 
  nah man , 9 is who 's getting scared . 
  7 ate 9 , you know . 
  it 's basically fermented baltic herring . 
  a delicacy here in sweden . 
  of course you do n't eat it straight from the can though , as food for louis does in [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7wjz2apwyk ) video . 
  you eat it on crispbread with cooked potatoes , sour cream , basilica and red onion, 
  the description was so alike . 
  good luck finding it !, 
  sleeping . 
  [ johnny cash - i wo n't back down ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yilitpbfpqm ) . 
  i 'm not really sure how * happy * it gets me , but it sure helps me keep my chin up . 
  i felt really stupid after my first thought was `` that 's not 3 words '', 
  i hope you ca n't bail out of the plane in air superiority . 
  i think we all know that a lot of players bail out of their plane seconds before it explodes , even if they are way out of bounds and will die anyway , just because they are dicks and do n't want to give you the kill , which is lame as shit . 
  wow , i do n't even know how to respond to that other than to just tell you that i despise you and all other people like you . 
  if i were able to i 'd ban you for life in all kind of online games . 
  edit : and no , i 'm not saying that you 're not allowed to do some `` trolling '' or stuff like that from time to time , that 's perfectly fine . 
  but when you admit that you play only to ruin other people 's good time , you are nothing more than a massive cuntbag , probably with the mindset of a 12-year-old boy . 
  edit : i was wrong , that was not him . 
  your team will lose a point if someone commits suicide aswell . 
  if you bail only by the sole purpouse to deny your opponent the kill and points he earned by shooting you down , it * is * douchy . 
  of course you should bail if you can still survive and play the objective . 
  i 'm talking about those who bail even when far out of bounds and will die anyway , only they do it by suicide instead . 
  so after winning a dog fight you do n't earn it ? 
  there 's no logic at all in what you just said . 
  i could n't disagree more with anything of what you just wrote , and honestly have a hard time even understanding how you can have this opinion . 
  if you 've played enough jet you 'd know that a vast majority of people bail out after losing a fair dog fight , even if this means suicide for them . 
  this is * only * pure dickery , because they do n't want to give you the points you just earned . 
  it 's not even close to bailing a tank , since if you bail a tank you can always keep keep playing the objective . 
  as i said before ; bailing a jet over bases is of course something you should do , because in that case you can also keep playing the objective . 
  i 'm talking about those who are out of bounds and have no chance whatsoever to survive after bailing . 
  how am i a spoiled crybaby for having the opinion that if you 've chosen to fight in a jet and you lose a dogfight to another , you should of course stay in the jet and allow him the kill if you have no way of surviving anyway ? 
  there 's no chivalry at all in bf3 . 
  uh , no , not if you play against someone who 's even half decent at flying a jet . 
  please explain to me how it is stupidity . 
  you have chosen to fight in a jet , and you get shot down in a dog fight when out ouf bounds , so no matter what you do , you will die . 
  * how * on earth is it stupidity to actually give the opponent who shot you down fair and square what he deserves ? 
  do you also think infantry should have a button bound to insta-suicide so that they can easily deny someone a kill when they realize they 're about to die ? 
   in the grand scheme of things , what you expect is the exact same thing as sitting in any disabled vehicle and letting someone get a kill credit on you . 
  it 's like talking to a brick wall . 
  have you not read what i wrote ? 
  it 's absoultely * not * the same on * any * level . 
  do you know what `` out of bounds '' means ? 
  god you just do n't get it , do you ? 
  ** they . 
  will . 
  anyway . 
  ** bailing out ** wo n't ** save them , all they do is ** deny ** their opponent the kill and score he ** deserves ** by ** shooting them the fuck down . 
  you do n't kill a jet in 0.1 second , people * always * have time to react fast enough to bail out . 
  as for your take on my infantry comment , that is not even remotely close to what i said .
