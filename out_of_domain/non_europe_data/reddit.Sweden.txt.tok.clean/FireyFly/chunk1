hmm , look really interesting . 
  i 'll take a closer look when i have time , but i 've always been eager to try new paradigms , and reactive programming looks ... interesting . 
  mdc for reference , [ eloquent javascript ] ( http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html ) as a tutorial . 
  mdc was linked by previous redditors ; another tip is to simply append mdc to your search terms , such as `` array push mdc '' or similar . 
  edit : and yeah , never ever use w3schools . 
  their website contains invalid code , et cetera . 
  awesome , i was looking for this language a few weeks ago . 
  i remember reading about it a year or so ago , but could n't find it by googling ... so yeah , thanks for the link , bookmarked it now . 
  should try it out some day . 
  i find [ this wikipedia template ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/template:programming_paradigms ) pretty awesome for learning ` bout new paradigms . 
  thought it was a bit relevant ... 
  i prefer [ this ] ( http://erkie.github.com/ ) by far though ... 
  precisely this . 
  one piece of software i ca n't live without , eh ? 
  the linux kernel , i suppose . 
  upvoted for cyndaquil . 
  great list !, 
  i 'll see if i can add anything to it later on . 
  i instantly thought of ii at least . 
  this was my reaction as well ... never heard of anything similar to this . 
  obligatory, 
   redditor for 53 minutes, 
  comment . 
  apparently . 
  the first one is wrong . 
  or technically undecidable , i suppose , since all are valid conditions . 
  you 're correct , but the expression `` controlvariable = 10 '' actually evaluates to 10 . 
  ctrl + f quarter \u2192 upvote, 
  this is my typical `` worst execution method '' example . 
  [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_methods_of_capital_punishment ) is a neat list of execution methods , btw . 
  my first instinct when i heard of scrolls was `` magic the gathering with some tactical rpg elements '' . 
  you 've quite obviously been inspired by mtg and other tcgs , but have you been inspired by/played any tactical rpg ? 
  ( e.g. 
  final fantasy tactics , disgaea , tactics ogre , maybe even wesnoth , etc. ), 
  soon ( compose t m ), 
  they still need css3 though . . as well as jscript improvements . 
  but it seems they 're working on these , so that 's nice . 
  you mean , like , shit bricks ? 
  yep , some css3 , though definitely not all of it . 
  also by jscript improvements i 'm mostly thinking of es5 and js1 .8 extensions , and so on . 
  not necessarily performance , but rather features . 
  that said , i definitely like the direction the ie team is heading !,

  nice list !, 
  i can definitely see what you 're aiming at , but fyi i 'm pretty sure most engines support foreach , map , reduce and so on . 
  the api changes are easy to support , so most engines have already implemented them . 
   sweden, 
  we do n't even have \u00fc : s. . did you perhaps mean * german * beer ? 
  mystery meat ? 
  amazing !, 
  that looks like an interesting game ; i 'll check it out . 
  the civilization series is probably the game i 've played with the most complex tech tree , so far . 
  i got linked to [ this blog post ] ( http://gafferongames.com/networking-for-game-programmers/what-every-programmer-needs-to-know-about-game-networking/ ) today , maybe it helps you . 
  precisely why i ca n't play the game ... 
  i should probably dual-boot windows, 
  me too , high five !, 
  edit : and hopefully it 'll start to work for others soon as well . . 
  [ quicksort ] ( http://p-nand-q.com/humor/programming_languages/other/quicksort.txt ) ( courtesy of [ p-nand-q ] ( http://p-nand-q.com/ ) ) . 
  i guess they need a sortingfactory which creates an object that sorts sortables , with the use of a sortbycomparator function taking a comparator . 
  i did n't create it , but you could nag the creator over irc , mail or whatever . 
  check out [ his homepage ] ( http://www.aiju.de ) , i 'm pretty sure there 's some contact info there . 
  oops , looks like someone else [ already reddited this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/geek/comments/gtysi/heres_a_nickel_kid_go_download_yourself_a_better/ ) ... 
  did n't find it when searching , but you should upvote his post instead of me . 
  from [ notch ' earlier blog post ] ( http://notch.tumblr.com/post/4955141617/the-plan-for-mods ) :, 
   mod developers can download the source code from our svn repository . 
  as soon as we commit a change , it will be available to all mod, 
  developers , ** unobfuscated and uncensored ** . 
  i have n't seen any other mod-heavy game release all of its source code * for free * , no . 
  i think it 's quite a difference to freely allow mods through an api ( like nwn , civ4 , many other games ) and ( monetarily ) free access to the source code of the game . 
  good question ; have an upvote . 
  yes , i 've never had anything against that practise . 
  i think it simplifies the code and utilises language features better , and i have n't had any problems with it so far . 
  i do n't extend object though ( for obvious reasons ) , and nowadays i try to use object.defineproperty to make sure that my new properties have [ [ iterable ] ] set to false . 
  i 'm afraid i did n't develop it though , i only found a link to it and decided to post it . 
  if you 'd like to contact him , you could try the means mentioned [ here ] ( http://aiju.de/ ) . 
  that said , i might still be interested in joining in on an emulation project . 
  i started on a java bytecode interpreter once , but never got around to implement object instanitation . 
  oh , and by the way , it 's ** really ** cool to see good ol' pok\u00e9mon crystal running inside my web browser . 
  great work !, 
  i. . thought i replied to your post a few days ago , when i first noticed it ... 
  apparently i did n't , maybe reddit had some hiccups or something . 
  anyway , i did n't create this emulator , [ this guy ] ( http://aiju.de ) did . 
  i simply found his awesome work and wanted to share it . 
  i was going to comment `` i 've already seen it , but upvoted for kirby !, 
  '' , then i noticed the post was in r/kirby and not r/gaming ... oh well , have an upvote anyway . 
  reminded me of [ this final destination variant ] ( http://s3.amazonaws.com/kym-assets/photos/images/original/000/118/542/bayeux_final_destination.jpg ) ... 
  i like the style . 
  nice !, 
  i recall playing some foss puzzle game where you play as a ball ( or something similar ) , where one moved about in 3d space along walls/floor . 
  it was a bit like you described ; not much sense of gravity . 
  ca n't remember its name though . . :\\,
