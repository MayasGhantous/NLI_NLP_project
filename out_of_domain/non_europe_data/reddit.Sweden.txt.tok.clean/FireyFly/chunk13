  i have it bound on caps lock . 
  some people use `` jj '' or something like that , but i just find that strange ... 
  fair enough . 
  i stick to linux , and i use my own symbols file on my own machines and otherwise just xmodmap it there ( or simply use the regular esc key if it 's just a short session ) otherwise . 
  it 's directly related to your question though ( why other devices can use the cards when the pi ca n't ) . 
  information about brand , class and so on can help answer why it does n't work with the pi . 
  `` i 'm freezing '' ) would be more common in day-to-day speech , it feels more idiomatic to me at least . 
  i thought your link would lead to [ this file ] ( http://www.csua.berkeley.edu/~ranga/humor/pi.txt ) . 
  for maximum performance , [ solve it before runtime ] ( http://www.ioccc.org/1995/vanschnitz.c ) !, 
  try adding ` http : / / ' . 
  [ turn-based tactics ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turn-based_tactics ) ( both [ trpgs ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trpg ) and [ tactical wargames ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tactical_wargame ) ) . 
  mostly trpgs though . 
  compared to `` typical '' rpgs , the battles are much longer , and more of a part of the game . 
  typcial fights take around a quarter ; `` boss battles '' might very well take an hour . 
  however , compared to `` regular '' rpgs , trpgs usually have less story-y storylines , and the overworld is usually just some small hub location or just a map with dots for locations . 
  some examples of tactics series include advance wars , fire emblem , disgaea , tactics ogre , final fantasy tactics . 
   that 's not true because of the user agreement buying the disc legally entails . 
  it might not be legally all right to use all the content on the disc , but in any case `` stealing '' would be the wrong term for using what you 're not allowed to , would n't it ? 
  hamsteroj actually emphasized the `` stealing '' in `` it 's certainly not stealing '' , which leads me to believe that this was what his point was , and as far as i know he 's correct about that . 
  german , sexy ? 
  what . 
  coming from someone with a french-y username ? 
  i 'm terribly confused here . 
  gs/gg and action replay is basically the same thing . 
  it 's a device that allows you to manipulate portions of the console 's ram during runtime . 
  the 3ds was n't really `` built against cheaters '' , it 's mostly a neat side-effect as far as nintendo 's concerned ( as far as i know this is the case , anyway ) . 
  the main purpose ( again , afaik ) is to prevent piracy and block flash-cart devices , but incidentally this also protects the device from gs/gg/ar-style devices since they both work in a similar fashion . 
  ` true `, 
  in all honesty , both the ds phat and the ds lite is known to have had problems with the hinges . 
  i do n't think it 's too unreasonable for people to be worried about it . 
  that 's the only huge problem i know of with a nintendo console though , and they can take an incredible amount of physical harm before breaking ... 
  most of the female ones i was going to suggest has already been mentioned , so i 'll add two male names instead : ernst and serge . 
  i second the last part . . 
  i 'm very sad that i might not be able to play the game , since i only have linux boxes setup at home . 
  i suspect that switching from unity to another engine would be way too much work in such a late stage , though . 
  the other replies seems to have covered it pretty well , so i 'll just add that a neighbour of mine only speaks english , and he 's been living here for a couple of years now . 
  it 's certainly possible to do so , although some might consider it rude . 
  also that one has white buttons whereas the original silver ds had black/dark-grey ones . 
  i started playing ptcg around that age , if not even earlier . . 
  i think it 's certainly possible to grasp the concepts at that age , but i suggest simplifying the game a bit for the first few games ... 
  i seem to recall skipping weakness/resistance ( and maybe also the concept of retreating ) when teaching the game . 
  take this with a pinch of salt though ; it was many years since i played and the game seems to have changed quite a lot since then . 
  ppk 's [ blog post ] ( http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2012/05/face_opera.html ) about the rumours and possible reasons for why it would make sense for facebook is pretty interesting , too . 
  they 're not submitted by the same user ( from what i can tell ) , but the students have systematic usernames based on which class/person in class it 's posted by , or something ( i think ) . 
  and yes , at least earlier the students were encouraged to check out the comments on their comic . 
  do n't tell elan !, 
  i also missed hjkl at vim 's command line ( well , only jk really . . and ` c-a ` , ` c-e ` ) , so what i did was to bind ` c-j ` and ` c-k ` to do the right thing :, 
  yes , but usually only minor edits whenever i see something that looks off in an article that i happen to visit . 
  the only wikis i can recall that i 've edited are en wp , sv wp and english wiktionary . 
  you 'd have to replace the orange cards with upvotes though , otherwise it fits pretty well . 
  i always run vim from a terminal . 
  if i need to do file management i just ` ^ z ` out of vim , move stuff around and then ` fg ` vim again . 
  i really love to use the shell for file management , so i personally do n't see any reason to try to integrate it in vim instead . 
  i prefer [ this graphical notation ] ( http://worrydream.com/alligatoreggs/ ) . 
  i had this very same problem , but rather than using make i usually use a certain shell snippet via ` : ! ` . 
  i bound ` < leader  . ` to repeat the last shell snippet executed from inside vim , via ` nnoremap < leader  . 
  you can replace ` : ! ` with ` : make ` and it should work as a general-purpose `` repeat last ` make ` '' command . 
  ( you can map the ` < leader  ` key via the ` mapleader ` variable ; see ` : h leader ` . ), 
  i 'm not sure why it 's such a big concern . 
  surely the font size will be configurable , and the user can increase the font size of the editor to fit their personal preference . 
  heck , it might even listen to system-wide settings of default font size , in case any such settings are detected ( depending on the environment ) . 
  i do n't mean to imply that readability and font-size is unimportant , but complaining about the font size of a text editor seems rather pointless to me , precisely since it 's almost guranteed to be configurable . 
  it does look really awesome though , very nice colours !, 
  and it 's huuge . 
  i do n't think the `` only one tablet controller '' is an arbitrary limitation -- i 'd say it 's probably for performance reasons . 
  maybe it does n't have enough power to stream output to/handle that many controllers at the same time . 
  replacing the tablet controllers with 3dses would n't help much in that regard ( sure , the 3ds might have lower resolution but it 's still a lot of data to stream ) . 
  it 's the webkit developer tool ; it 's part of the engine that the browser uses . 
  i 'm pretty sure that both safari and chromium ( and chrome , of course ) use the same developer tools too ( i have n't actually checked with safari since i run linux ) . 
  firefox has actually had built-in developer tools for more than half a year now ( console , dom inspector + style viewer , some more ) . 
  imho these tools are far superior to firebug , but of course your mileage may vary . 
  and yeah , the modern developer tools were basically pioneered by firebug . 
  i think opera was the second sorta major browser to implement one ( opera dragonfly ) , followed by chrome and the webkit devtools . 
  they 're all pretty awesome . 
  i 'm pretty sure linux ends lines with just a * line-feed * , not a carriage return . 
  but yes , that might indeed be a problem, 
  it should be pretty easy to write a little sed script that replaces the line breaks with < cr  < lf  though , as to generate a windows-friendly file . 
  a workaround , but i think it should work fairly well . 
   ... since the world seems now to be `` anti-two-sentence-spaces '', 
  funny , i recently started doing this myself since i actually * like * it ... 
  i have n't seen any sort of opposition towards it , but then again i guess most people do n't really care . 
  oh yes , i definitely meant in monospace contexts ; sorry about the lack of clarity . 
  i absolutely would n't do it in a proportional typeface setting . 
  i find it useful in e.g. 
  latex or markdown source , or in documentation/comments embedded in code , as you suggested . 
  i actually find it * snappier * than before ... odd . 
  maybe in your case it is indeed related to the plugins/plugin system ? 
  you could try installing e.g. 
  [ flashblock ] ( https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/flashblock/ ) and see if that fixes the performance issues ( it deactivates flash elements until you click on them ) . 
  on that note , maybe it 'd be a good idea to include a screencast and write/edit a file for a bit while mentioning how one would solve each problem as they happen . 
  preferably one would try to make use of the above mentioned operators as much as possible . 
  ` . ` repeats more than just plain * insertions * , i 'm pretty sure . 
  if you insert `` use ` p ` to paste whatever is in the buffer '' between the insert and the ` . ` , you 'll see that ` . ` will repeat the paste , although insert mode + ` < c-a  ` would repeat the last insert ( even if a paste happened between the two ) . 
  simply beautiful explanation . 
  really easy to understand and reason about . 
  i also like that the post both has really nice visualisations of data , but is also * about * visualizing data and why it 's important . 
  oh cool , i did n't even notice that part at first !, 
  i love the whole interactiveness of the essay . 
  trains ... istors, 
  the rhs is coerced into a string ( ` tostring ` is applied to it ) by the abstract equality comparison algorithm .
