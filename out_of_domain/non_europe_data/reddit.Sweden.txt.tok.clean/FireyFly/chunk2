  that would be awesome . 
  burn him ? 
  [ http://bellard.org/jslinux/tech.html] ( http://bellard.org/jslinux/tech.html ), 
  '' ( it does not work with chrome 12 beta . 
  as far as i know , it is a bug in the browser '', 
  also , [ the author of that thing ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fabrice_bellard ) is so awesome ... 
  i want to be him . 
  as a long-time opera user , i have to agree with you . 
  as an avid js programmer , i kind of understand him . . `` too old '' in this case seem to be the fact that opera and safari has n't implemented typed arrays . 
  they are crucial for the performance in this case , and , well , at least he 's doing feature detection and not browser detection . . 
  function gf ( ) {, 
  return ( window.uint8array & & window.uint16array & &, 
  window.int32array & & window.arraybuffer ) ;, 
  he 's awesome . 
  i thought he was awesome a year ago , and now he 's even more awesome . 
  it does n't use browser detection , so that would n't matter . 
  fwiw i did n't downvote you . . heck , i 'll probably upvote you since this is oftentimes an actual issue . 
  last time i checked , the readability of the code does n't have anything to do with the licensing . . ? 
  [ there 's a word for that ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ras_syndrome ) , btw . 
  [ i think it 's `` it '' ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtqfgd3g6dg#t=4m40s ) . 
  it 's a very crappy translation of `` put x in bag '' , i think ... 
  there is n't only the `` degrees of separation '' aspect , but also the `` click on the first link '' part . 
  i think the fact that 87 % of articles lead to a specific article , only by clicking * a specific * link each time systematically , is quite impressive . 
  i agree with advance wars , definitely a great game . 
  if advance wars is something you enjoy , it might be worth to try out the [ trpg subgenre ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trpg ) ; i 'd recommend [ disgaea ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/disgaea_ds#disgaea_ds ) for example , which is a remake of a great psx trpg . 
  edit : but start with advance wars and see if the tactics subgenre is something you enjoy at all . 
  the same works in opera , for the record . 
  is that really what your answer would be ? 
  yeah , well , that works too . . 
  are you certain [ that you 're seeing it ] ? 
  you 're welcome . 
  fun idea !, 
  my guess : $ 11.28, 
  how do you mean ? 
  the combination was stated to be random , and the dial reset would of course not alter the actual combination required to unlock it ? 
  i 'm afraid i 'm missing your point entirely ; could you elaborate ? 
  i did n't know this was a common trait with women ? 
  i 'm a skinny male and i like showering/bathing in really hot water . 
  the proper term for displays is actually [ ppi ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pixel_density ) , or pixel density . 
  dpi refers to the dots a printer prints , but in practise the words are both used interchangeably . 
  i 'm new to this subreddit , so pardon any mistaken assumptions about the people and topics here . 
  it is a game in the turn-based tactics subgenre , so it is n't a `` traditional '' tbs in the 4x sense ; it is a tactical wargame ( i.e. 
  similar to advance wars for the gba & ds if you 've played that ) with rpg elements . 
  i personally find the game enjoyable , but that 's obviously subjective . 
  i do know people who generally do n't enjoy tactics games but find wesnoth interesting though , so i 'd definitely say it 's worth a try !, 
  19/m/student / sweden, 
  no , it is a language feature . 
  javascript as a language is event-driven ; it has an event loop that handles invoking of things in a systematic fashion . 
  it 's actually the opposite ... no-one in sweden seems to give a fuck , but apparently reddit finds it noteworthy since it 's reached the frontpage . 
  upvoted whole tree . 
  i 'll syn you later .

  i can probably do an online map viewer in javascript if/when you post the tileset . 
  this happened to me . 
  it took me a long time to learn the correct pronounciation of `` busy '' ... 
  [ sage ] ( http://www.sagemath.org ) might be interesting to r/math . 
  i think it 's based on python , but it aims to be a viable alternative to maple , matlab , mathematica etc. 
  i 've played around with it a little , and i liked it . 
  i 'm more of a programmer than a maths guy though so my view might be biased . 
  at least he * did * end with, 
   stop . 
  i tried it out quite a while ago , and i could n't remember exactly . 
  [ you know like they did in telegrams stop ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/full_stop#use_in_telegrams ), 
  yeah , `` does n't teach you how '' would 've sufficed . 
  [ sorry , i had to do it ... ] ( http://xkcd.com/417/ ), 
  `` death by spider jockey '', 
  `` river still continues '', 
  personally i think it 's much more fun to play the co-op with someone who has n't already finished it though .

  ... wait . 
  is it possible that there will ever be a re-release of [ penn & teller 's smoke and mirrors ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/penn_%26_teller%27s_smoke_and_mirrors ) ? 
  that 'd be awesome ; i 'd definitely buy it . 
  upvotes for making me giggle at * blood red cell * . 
  suggestion : link to [ wikirby ] ( http://wikirby.info/wiki/main_page ) in the sidebar . 
  compared to wikia wikis , the niwa wikis are independently run ; see [ the about niwa page ] ( http://www.niwanetwork.org/about.php ) for more info . 
  also , it 's awesome to see that this subreddit is actually going somewhere !, 
  i had n't noticed until now that it 's been an actual subreddit for the past four months !, 
  keep up the great work .

  [ original post ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/gamernews/comments/l9dz8/kirbys_return_to_dreamland_overview_trailer_japan/ ) . 
  it might be worth noting that cnet bought both metacritic and gamespot . 
  yes , i know that metacritic only aggregate reviews from different sources , but it 's still a bit unsettling to know that they 're owned by the same company , imo . 
  yes , and it gives the illusion that the approximations approach a circle because the * area * does , but not the * perimeter * . 
  i instantly thought of the hack . 
  was years since i last played it ... 
  is that a strong and repeating '' ... open open open ... '' ? 
  yes . 
  well , not fighting as in trying to destroy the other browser through monetary means , but fighting as in actively trying to improve over the other browser . 
  take for example [arewefastyet.com ] ( http://arewefastyet.com ) , created by the mozilla js engine team . 
  they actively compared their speed to v8 , trying to beat their benchmark results . 
  also , google have their `` do n't be evil '' motto ; suddenly impairing mozilla monetarily probably would n't be very good pr for them . 
  i , uh . . 
  i usually let it brew for about 10 minutes for a pot . 
  nope . 
  for me it looks smooth in both firefox and chromium : http://i.imgur.com/4b8y4.png, 
   yes coffeescript is javascript , but learning coffeescript now is n't going to help you learn more javascript . 
  it depends on what you mean by `` learn more javascript '' .
