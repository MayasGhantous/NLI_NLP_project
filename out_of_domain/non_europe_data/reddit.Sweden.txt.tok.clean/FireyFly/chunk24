  it 'd probably both hurt the interest in the game and require a lot of time and effort to recreate media and come up with new stuff , unfortunately . 
  well , it certainly hinges on whether you enjoy the battles . 
  i also do n't enjoy typical rpg battles terribly much , but battles in trpgs are vastly different to those in `` typical '' rpgs ( ff , ct and so on ) . 
  but then again , i like strategy games in general , so it 's only natural that i 'd like tbts too . 
  maybe a more interesting question : is it possible to implement multiplication hardware that runs in * o ( k ) * time ( i.e. 
  `` steps '' of depth of the circuit ) , where * k * is the number of bits for the numbers ? 
  are those from the tcg ? 
  i find that the fact that you do n't really know much about the game makes you a lot more cautious , which i find adds to the immersion of the game . 
  for instance i was cautious when it came to the `` some traps have been destroyed , sound outside '' event since i knew i was virtually defenseless , and i was cautious when i saw `` battlefield '' tiles on the map later in the game since i was afraid of a hard battle . 
  i guess some would say that not knowing the game mechanics is a bad thing , so i guess the game is not for everyone ... 
  it gives a visual representation of the tab groups and allows you to easier keep track of which is which , and it also persists through restarts . 
  imagine switching to your school tabgroup while doing school stuff , having all your relevant wikipedia articles and schedule and whatnot there , without having to have a specific window around there all the time . 
  i guess it caters mostly to the kind of users who like persistent tabs in their browsers . 
  here 's what my tabgroups currently look like : http://i.imgur.com/bp3ieyq.png ( as you may be able to tell i 'm not terribly good at keeping the groups to their topic ... ), 
  here 's a closeup of my `` main '' tabgroup , for comparison : http://i.imgur.com/zypr84s.png, 
  i half-expected the readme to end with `` thanks for flying vim '' . 
  looks nice , powerline never really stuck with me but this seems hackable and configurable enough that i might give it a go . 
  for the `` regular font '' version you could use more unicode characters in place of the powerline special symbols , like \u240a or \u2424 for newline and maybe \u2387 for branch ? 
  i use vim , since it allows me to do some degree of sketching with ascii art . 
  not as good as pen & paper when it comes to diagrams and such , but quicker for text , and searchable and always with me wherever i go . 
  the benefits outweight the downsides for me , since i know i wo n't put in the effort to digitalise my notes later on , and i 've found my digital notes useful even after a course . 
  fair enough . 
  as long as it 's configurable it 's all fine and dandy . 
  are you sure you should n't rethink your priorities ? 
  same for me . 
  as for keeping awake , i tend to stick to black tea instead . 
  surely your own browser will intercept the keys before the website receives them , though , no ? 
  i 've never had any problem with google groups ( though i do n't use it a lot ) , nor with google reader or any other site , in either of pentadactyl , luakit or vimperator . 
  ( well , none that i can recall anyway , though it was a while since i used pentadactyl . ), 
  in fact , i 've had more issues with the `` inverse '' of the problem , so to say , with pass-through mode in the firefox-based browsers actually passing keys on to * firefox * and not directly to the site itself , which usually means random new-tab or new-window actions rather than the page 's own binding of ` ^ t ` or ` ^ n ` . 
  i believe it depends on the overall language . 
  the very `` free '' syntax of lisps and concatenative languages like forth makes it easier to learn to parse them as identifiers than , say , compared to c-like languages . 
  in these two language categories ( lisp & concatenative ) whitespace delimits valid tokens , and there simply is n't any meaningful token other than the identifier ( well , almost , in lisps ) . 
  `` multi-platform '' meaning iphone and ipad ? 
  :\\ that does n't seem terribly multi-platform to me , though i could only find links to the itunes page so i assume it 's what was meant . 
  too bad , since this looked decent but i do n't have any i-device . 
  ... is this the typical atmosphere of the australian parliament ? 
  if so , i hope there 's a dedicated stream broadcasting all their discussion , because i want to see more of it ... 
  i do n't know , i 'm a relatively new subscriber . 
  skimming through the first page of the sub , i guess not . 
  i was kinda expecting more web-based content , and i 've done some half-hearted attempts at making my own web-based digital card games , so i guess that 's what piqued my interest . 
  wait , the ds did n't have ir , did it ? 
  and i do n't really see any benefit over using only wifi for battles and trading ... 
  because children , i suppose . 
  same reason you have to jump through hoops and add each other 's friend codes in order to get two-way communication at all . 
  that said , they seem to be gradually allowing more and more stuff , what with miiverse and streetpass . 
  oh , that clarifies things ; thanks . 
  still , i 'm clueless why they went with that over just plain wifi . 
  i doubt it 's power consumption concerns , considering streetpass works over wifi passively even in stand-by mode . 
  haskell * sure is * confusing , especially if you have plenty of experience with imperative programming languages . 
  i 'm sure you 've already seen it , but [ learn you a haskell ] ( http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters ) is a widely popular introduction material for haskell and i 'd recommend checking it out . 
  do n't worry about taking baby steps ; it took me a while to get through it the first time and i certainly did n't understand it all after i had finished it . 
  it 's pretty eye-opening once you get things though , since it 's so * different * . 
  ... or if my guess is wrong and you have no interest in any kind of programming , or just no interest in haskell , maybe you should try another tiling window manager instead for a change . 
  if you know teco , implement your favourite esoteric programming language in it . 
  like , say , [ brainfuck , for instance ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/teco_ ( text_editor \\ ) #example _ 3 ) . 
  i ca n't seem to remember my password right now , but last time i played it ( about a year ago , i think ) , this was n't the case . 
  sure , you get plenty of cards to start off with , but there 's still more to get by winning and then you can also upgrade all the cards to make them stronger and better , too . 
  what about a simple, 
  ( function ( ) {, 
  var blah = my.long.name.blah, 
  / / ... use ` blah ` here, 
  or , if you want to `` import '' plenty of stuff from a given object , just abbreviate the container object instead inside the iife : ` var m = my.random.module ; / * ... use m.blah , m.foobar , ... * / ` . 
  ( modulo code style preferences ), 
  any particular reason for not running latest stable release ? 
  i think that `` game '' is too vague to be able to categorize as art or not art . 
  on one extreme end , we have pure puzzle games like tetris or tetris attack , which most closely resembles abstract board games . 
  on another end some would count visual novels and interactive stories as video games since they too are interactive , and these are really light on game mechanics and place all the focus on the story . 
  i 'm not sure if `` game '' could even be considered a single medium . 
  in my mind it 's a bit like grouping all `` written media '' together into a single category , no matter if it 's a novel or poem or informational flyer or scientific paper , and then claim that written things are n't art because no-one would call a scientific paper or a flyer art . 
  so yeah , sorry for sidestepping the main point of discussion a bit , but i do n't think anything meaningful could be said about the topic because the term `` video game '' is too inclusive and hard to define .

  and category theorists turning ffee into ... something . 
  well , really , considering font glyphs are already vector graphics based on bezier curves , * presumably * using something similar to svg paths , it seems to me that it makes most sense to just re-use that ( which seems to be what microsoft 's doing ) . 
  i was really surprised to see it mentioned in the article that the variant being standardised embeds svg in the font file instead ... 
  i wonder how isup.me works ... 
  i would 've thought they checked whether there is a web server answering from their end , but evidently they check for something else instead . 
  yeah , both have pros and cons . 
  some pros mentioned elsewhere in the thread is the smaller size ( and generally `` cleaner system '' so to say ) and if a vulnerability in a library is fixed you get it `` for free '' when the system-wide library gets updated . 
  as you mentioned there are benefits with supplying dependencies with the program as well , which is why many games and proprietary programs take that approach . 
  as long as they honour the unicode description of the characters involved ( and i do hope they do n't stuff them all into the private use area ... ) i do n't see a problem . 
  and hey , colour support would make [ these ] ( http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/1f34e/index.htm ) [ characters ] ( http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/1f34f/index.htm ) make a bit more sense at least !, 
  [ ultimate tic-tac-toe ] ( http://mathwithbaddrawings.com/2013/06/16/ultimate-tic-tac-toe/ ) is a pretty deep and interesting variant of tic-tac-toe that seems worth mentioning . 
  so did i. 
  which is ironic considering i 've been reading `` snowden '' as `` sweden '' the past few days ... 
  i agree . 
  though , more importantly , i think we need to leave the `` block terminal '' and have the cli be . . well , a * command-line * interface . 
  move line editing from the shell to the terminal ( i believe almquist was onto something with the original ` ash ` ) . 
  of course we need some sort of old-terminal-emulator mode integrated , since we need backwards compatibility with existing terminal applications ( curses-like or not ) . 
  i 'd want the terminal to allow me to input commands in a line-oriented fashion , and have the output ( `` plain '' \u00e1 la ` ls ` , `` curses-like '' , an x window ) appear in a dedicated rectangle as the result of the command . 
  allow me to full-screen such an output box and you could still have curses-like programs ( vim , nano , htop , what have you ) work as before . 
  they did n't say to pointy-clickifying things , or at least i did n't interpret it that way . 
  i think making ` ls ` , ` ps ` etc not only deal with text but with more meaningful ( meta ) data instead . 
  i think it 'd be awesome if ` top ` would take arbitrary input with a time dimension and show it to me in a sortable table , and if ` watch ` would take an arbitrary command which outputs some arbitrarily typed data and add a time dimension to that , thus allowing not only ` watch ps | top ` but also ` watch ls | top ` or ` watch lsof | top ` . 
  would n't that make it show up as title '' * . pdf.windows.will.be.confused.by '' and `` unknown this file '' or something ? 
  i 'm aware of plan 9 ( though i have n't used it a lot , sadly ) . 
  it 's definitely a step in the right direction , and i * love * `` everything is a virtual filesystem '' and 9p and all that .
