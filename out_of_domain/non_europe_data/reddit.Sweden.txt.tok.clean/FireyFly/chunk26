  sure , it may well be more `` fundamental '' in a mathematical ( and `` natural '' , in such a low resolution as molecules ) sense , but i think orthogonal grids have another benefit : it 's way easier to construct a grid ( just draw a set of parallel lines , and then another set of parallel lines orthogonal to the first ) . 
  if anything , i think triangular grids would be more likely than hexagonal ... though i may be wrong , since chinese checkers is merely a hundred years old ( and wikipedia does n't mention any older similar games that it 's evolved from ) . 
  are there any older or simpler games played on a similar grid ? 
  on the topic of game board grids , i found [ this set of lists on bgg ] ( http://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/gameboards ) to be interesting . 
  [ shimubi ] ( http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamefamily/13434/shibumi-family ) is a family of games played in a 3d pyramid kind of shape . 
  a stacking game using marbles like this does n't seem too unlikely to be invented early on from a `` theoretical '' perspective , though getting nice , round marbles might be difficult from a practical perspective using primitive tools . 
  is district heating/teleheating rare in the us ? 
  it seems to have the same benefits as a tankless water heater , but is cheaper ( ? ), 
  and not dependent on power . 
  ( well , not dependent on power on * your * side of the system , that is . ), 
  i googled the swedish equivalent of `` fireball '' , and most of the hits used it to refer to a meteor . 
  so , well , that 's another possible source of the idea . 
  there 's also will-o ' - the-wisp and similar concepts , though those are more balls of light than of fire , perhaps ... 
  honesty , i think that would surprise me * more * than the current behaviour as specced in js . 
  i mean , if one writes ` for ( var i = 0 ; i < 10 ; i + + ) ` does one actually expect each iteration to declare a separate ` i ` ? 
  it seems pretty clear to me that it is the same variable being altered each iteration , since the semantics have always been ` ( < once-before-loop  ; < condition  ; < after-each-iteration  ) ` for the parts of a ` for ` loop header ... 
  is n't it only two lines ? 
  or is there a newline before the content of the ps1 ? 
  unless the company is targeting companies primarily ( e.g. 
  dustin ) and you 're using their webshop , though usually they prompt you and ask whether you want prices with tax included . 
  or dejavu sans mono or envy code r. 
  wait , are n't they just unicode codepoints , but in decimal instead of hex ? 
  ( well , maybe with the lower 255 as cp437 for some reason ... ), 
  \u0399t allows you to enter ( somewhat ) esoteric characters via a sequence of regular keystrokes ( after hitting the compose key ) . 
  for instance , ` compose < < ` gives you * `` * , and ` compose a e ` gives you * \u00e6 * . 
  * [ compose key on wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/compose_key ), 
  * [ ` xcompose ( 3 ) ` ] ( http://linux.die.net/man/3/xcompose ), 
  is n't this mentioned on the wiki ? 
  to add some more : ` / usr/share/x11 / xkb/symbols ` have files for different xkb layouts , and if you look inside a file you see the various variants it offers . 
  for instance , if you want to use the swedish dvorak variant , you 'd put ` option `` xkblayout '' `` se '' ` and ` option `` xkbvariant '' `` dvorak '' ` . 
  oh , and there 's also ` `` xkboption '' ` for incomplete extra modifications such as `` swap caps lock and escape '' ( see ` / usr/share/x11 / xkb/symbols/capslock ` ) . 
  this looks like half a blog post to me . 
  all right , you found a nice utility that changes the background based on the ambient light level , and based on the title and introduction you want to write a vim plugin that does the same thing with vim colourschemes . 
  but the post just suddenly ended after pointing out that the input is n't all that precise ? 
  or did i mis-infer the point of the post ? 
  ( and if i did , what does this have to do with vim ? 
  the repo seems to contain nothing really vim-related as far as i can tell ... ), 
  heya , thanks for the response and suggestions !, 
  sorry for the somewhat late reply ; i 've been pondering what you wrote and let me start by saying that i agree with ( what i see as ) your main point : the / r/ambigrams community is n't very good at giving constructive criticism and there are too many posts with no replies . 
  i 've been thinking a bit , and i think something akin to what / r/pixelart does would be a good idea for this subreddit as well : mandate in the sidebar that posts are to be tagged with [ cc ] or [ c+c ] if the poster requests comments and criticism , [ oc ] for original content , and something ( maybe [ jfs ] , i dunno ) for `` someone else 's '' content . 
  moving on , regarding * grading * the readability i have to disagree with you . 
  to begin with , there 's the whole issue with everyone 's scale being different -- if you were to ask me , i 'd let 5/10 mean `` readable but nothing special '' , but if i were to guess most people would think their ambigram was quite unreadable if i were to give them , say , a 6/10 rating . 
  also , even if i were to receive , say , a 2/10 rating , that does n't tell me anything at all about how i can improve the readability . 
  instead , i propose that we modify the sidebar to encourage commenting and criticizing both visual beauty and readability , and to point out how readability could be improved or what parts are hard to read . 
  i think such textual comments help the ambigrammer even more , and i think anyone could look at an ambigram and comment which letters were easy to read and figure out and which were harder , so i think this approach would have the same effect on the community 's ability to provide input . 
  finally , the best way to encourage better criticism of submitted ambigrams is , of course , to contribute such criticism and lead by example . 
  considering how slow-moving this subreddit is , it should n't be too hard to provide such comments on the majority of the topics . 
  in fact , i 'm planning to do this once i get back from my ill-timed ( with respect to the subreddit acquisition ) holiday trip , and this post 'll hopefully serve as a reminder to do so . 
  anyway , i feel like i 'm rambling now , so i 'll shut up , but please do tell me what you think of my alternative to your rating suggestion . 
  luckily ` echo ` is probably a shell built-in in the shell he 's using . 
  crisis averted !, 
  no , \u00fc is pronounced like most languages ' `` y '' ( ipa / \u028f / i believe ) . 
  i do n't think the sound is present in english . 
  ninjaedit : hrm , if you take the i 's of * mini * , and round your mouth a bit , then you basically get the right sound . 
  must be dutch , because it looks like a mix between danish and german . 
  though then again , it might have a bit too few double vowels for being dutch ... 
  interesting . 
  reminds me of the [ referendum on prohibition of alcohol ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swedish_prohibition_referendum,_1922 ) here in sweden , from 1922 . 
  i wonder how history would 've played out if the referendum would 've passed , considering alcohol prohibition is pretty much unthinkable of today . 
  great post . 
  if you do n't mind me asking , where do you live now and which of these do you prefer ? 
  ( taking into account the higher tax that comes with having the government pay for universal health care . ), 
  ( i 'm from sweden , and it 's very hard for me to imagine myself living in the us ; the lack of universal health care is one of the reasons why , hence the question . ), 
  i 've found that the smaller and more niche the subreddit , the less memes and derailed threads and the more news , informative and interesting discussion . 
  which is probably why i mainly subscribe to a tonne of small subreddits . 
  / r/disgaea and / r/nipponichi are two other nice ( but focused ) subreddits , to add to the list . 
  question about rule 8 : to run some of the civ games on linux through [ wine ] ( http://en.wikipedia.com/wiki/wine_ ( software \\ ) ) one has to apply a no-cd crack on a legit copy of the game to circumvent the copy protection . 
  of course , this opens up the possibility to run a pirated copy as well , but it 's literally the only way to run a legally bought copy if you 're on linux . 
  would discussion about this ( such as links that explain how to get civ running on linux ) also be forbidden by rule 8 ? 
  not sure how relevant it 'll be to the subreddit as i just resubscribed to it , but i figure a rule clarification ca n't hurt . . 
   the backtick ( \\ ` ) requires you to push ( english keyboard equivalents ) shift = followed by any other character that is n't a letter that can have a grave accent . 
  and then deleting the extra letter . 
  this is known as a [ dead key ] ( http://en.wikipedia.com/wiki/dead_key ) , and as far as i know you could either press the dead \\ ` key twice or press dead - \\ ` space to insert only a ' \\ ` ' letter . 
  but yes , while it hurts programming a bit it at least makes it possible to type e.g. 
  \u00e9 ( which are needed for some swedish words and names ) , which is n't possible on the standard us layout ( afaik ) . 
  so yeah , while the swedish layout is n't terribly good for programming the us layout is also far from perfect . 
  is this for switching between layouts ? 
  i thought that was on alt + shift or alt + ctrl , though maybe they changed it in win7 or win8 ? 
  if you want a really good understanding of c/c + + , you 'll want at least a brief understanding of ( some ) assembly language , and to have written some simple routines in it . 
  do n't worry about it now , but when you feel that you have a good high-level understanding of c++ you might want to look into that . 
  for me , i never * really * understood c until i did the equivalent manually in assembly -- concepts such as pointers , function pointers , structs , unions , stack memory and so on ) . 
   htop ... without the list of processes ... 
  this is fairly common in the unixporn screenshots . 
  i 'm * guessing * it 's just a carefully resized terminal so that the process list does n't fit . 
   most swedes have never eaten reindeer in their entire life either though , so it 's no big whoop . 
  what , really ? 
  i thought * renskav * was a fairly common dish . . 
  did you try the `` salvi '' one ? 
  i 'm not too fond of liquorice , but the salvi l\u00e4kerol i find all right . 
  i agree with you that there is n't much difference between watching the two . 
  as far as the difference between sports and gaming go , i 'd say the same argument pretty much applies to motorsports too . 
  i 've also been served it as a child , and i 've grown up in stockholm . . granted , my father grew up in dalarna so i suppose that 's why . 
  still , it genuinely surprised me to learn this . 
  she * single-handedly * responded to everyone 's question . 
  * literally * . 
  that makes us two ... 
  in case your curious , * herbst * means `` autumn '' and * luft * means `` air '' . 
  so it 's actually the autumn-air wm. 
  i imagine that the two-pin schuko plug tilts easier if you happen to step on one lying upside down , so i 'd think the uk plug hurts more . 
  what i wonder is , who the heck leave plugs unplugged in places where you could easily step on them ?
