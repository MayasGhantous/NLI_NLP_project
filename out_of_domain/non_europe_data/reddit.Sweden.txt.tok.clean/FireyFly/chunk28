  :p i also noticed the repeated ` * d/h-d/2 , ` substring , but it 's too short for any savings given it only appears twice . . 
  well , it likely works with the majority of the population . 
  too much hassle ; easier to pay and read the article . 
  depending on how famous they are/were , you could 've collected cutouts of headlines from newspapers praising you ( well , actually the player ) or pointing out how you won or whatever . 
  i used to have a few as i share first and last name with a famous hockey player , though surprisingly people do n't usually joke about the name . 
  haha , fair enough . 
  that is indeed the case . 
  the guy who shares my name has played in a bunch of canadian teams though . 
  i 'm but a layman with a passing interest in typography , so you should probably take what i say with a grain of salt , but . . with the letters containing ( at least almost ) a circle , e.g. 
  c , d , g , o , q , i visually see the sides `` bulge in '' , i.e. 
  like ` ) ( ` ( but not as exaggerated , of course ) . 
  this is of course just an optical illusion , and having them bulge out a bit to counteract this takes away from the design , so that 's not a good solution . 
  perhaps something could be done with the way the `` arcs '' at the top and bottom connect with the sides . 
  these connections feel a bit `` hard '' to me ; maybe they could be smoothened out a bit . 
  oh , and was n't this font extended to cover all english phonemes earlier ? 
  what happened with those extra letters ? 
  and, 
  overall , i really like the design !, 
  i was curious as well , so i decided to toy around with it a bit . 
  i find the effect to be most prominent when i move away a bit from the monitor , so give that a try if you find it hard to see what i 'm seeing . 
  or maybe it 's just me . 
  i do n't see the relevance to this subreddit ( tragic as it is ) . 
  very nice !, 
  this subreddit is rather quiet as you might 've noticed , but hopefully that 'll improve over time . 
  glad to have you on board ( assuming you subscribed :p ) !, 
  i 'm a fan of twinings earl grey personally , but then again i 've more or less grown up drinking it . . so i recommend giving twinings a try . 
  as a european non-smoker , i envy you ... having to stand smokers every day while waiting for the commuter train annoys me a bit .

  wait , is n't that last one in hungarian ? 
  thank you . 
  it 's really fascinating how much information you can extract from the pixel values of camera ( in this case with an external light source though ) . 
  reminds me a bit of [ the eulerian video magnification ] ( http://people.csail.mit.edu/mrub/vidmag/ ) . 
  are there childrens ' ( 3 ) ds games with game content localized to scandinavian languages ? 
  i 've never that on any nintendo console ; i think such games usually get released as pc games ( e.g. 
  one million bytes is approximately 70 % of the amount of data that 'd fit in a 3 1/2 '' floppy . 
  afaik linux is n't technically unix . 
  as in , it does n't use unix-derived source code ( as opposed to osx and the other * bsds ) , whereas android definitely does use the linux kernel . 
  but yeah , i kinda see your point . 
  oh , okay , seems i had misunderstood things then since i thought bsds were considered unixes ( for the reason i stated ) . 
  thanks for the correction !, 
  and yes , i realise posix compliance is what really matters in the end , and in that regard linux fares well . 
  a distro might well use another shell & coreutils package though , no ? 
  such as zsh + bsd coreutils or ash + busybox , e.g. 
  i 've never really gotten the '' ( probably ) gnu coreutils , therefore gnu/linux '' argument -- by that matter surely it should be called gnu/freedesktop/linux or something , considering x11 is also a very central part of linux systems today , no ? 
  i believe what you 're * supposed * to do is to use media queries for ` screen ' or ` handheld ' media types , which to me makes more sense -- handheld in practice today translates to `` touch device '' ( smartphone or tablet ) . 
  i do n't know how widely implemented support for the ` handheld ' type is , though ; maybe the width-query thing is more popular due to lack of widespread support . 
  and yes , it 's a bit annoying to get mobile versions every now and then on my laptop ( 1366x768 ) because my browser happens to not be maximized ... 
  yeah , okay , i suppose . 
  but it 's arguably less of a difference than ( laptop | desktop ) computer vs. ( smartphone | tablet ) `` touch device '' . 
  talking purely about screen dimensions , yes . 
  but my laptop does n't do much if i poke its monitor , and has a physical keyboard and a mouse cursor . 
  in terms of web design differences i 'd still claim that the pads and the phones are more similar . 
  using an interface clearly designed for touch usage with a mouse is horribly awkward , and using an interface designed for keyboard usage is often impossible on a phone or pad . 
   interestingly , that patent also talks about a `` game server device , '' a hint at the in-home game streaming that was revealed in the steamos announcement possibly . 
  to me it just sounds like a legalese/formal way of saying `` video game console '' . 
  nope , but that seems like a pretty nice monospace font i had n't heard about !, 
  it 's envy code r. 
  or / r/gamemusic . 
  probably buy . 
  it depends a lot on the availability of a physical keyboard for me , but i did go for a $ 100 preorder back in july ( i think it was ? ) . 
  apart from keyboard , i value some things that ( hopefully ) sailfish will offer : being able to pull up a terminal and use plain ol' linux tools , good multitasking ( `` actual applications '' rather than apps going to sleep \u00e0 la android/ios ) and overall innovative user interface . 
  i currently have keyboard & sane multitasking out of these ( nokia e7 ) , but i 'm desperately missing being able to write code on and for it as i could with the n900 . 
  so , the opposite of narcissism ? 
  the relevant colourscheme is [ located here ] ( https://bitbucket.org/firefly/dotfiles/src/tip/vimperator/colors/firefly.vimp?at=default ) . 
  the colours are mostly based on the jellybeans colourscheme . 
  here are two screenshots showcasing it : [ scrot 1 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/sc5at82.png ) , [ scrot 2 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/lva4zpr.png ) . 
  oh , maybe i should mention that the panel near the top is in fact not a panel , but a single-line terminal emulator . 
  i figured that since i did n't use dzen2 's clickable areas or image support i might as well replace it with a terminal , and as a bonus that means working unicode as well . 
  i occasionally write latex in vim ( for uni hand-ins ) . 
  i do n't really use autocomplete at all , and run ` : ! pdflatex % ` , and then subsequently press ` < leader  . ` to recompile ( which i have bound to ` : !, 
  ! < cr  ` , i.e. 
  repeat last shell command ) . 
  then , i keep my favourite pdf viewer pointed to the resulting pdf file , and it 'll simply automagically reload the file when it 's overwritten . 
  my workflow is possibly * too * lightweight for your taste ... but it works for me , at least . 
  nice setup , i like the colourscheme . 
   i have suddenly learned that imaginary numbers are wayy more important than anyone told me and essential to understanding quite a bit of how the universe works . 
  this got me a bit curious ; mind giving a brief example ? 
  or just a pointer to a wikipedia article or page to give a general idea of how it 's essential . 
  tangental : the built-in ` * ` , ` # ` and ` gd ` are useful for when the cursor is on the identifier in question , and if you only want to navigate in a singe file . 
  disgaea ds , sometimes advance wars : days of ruin . 
  good question . 
  i have ` gd ` in my muscle memory , anyway . 
  the docs for ` gd ` say `` first vim searches for the start of the current function , just like ' [ [ ' '' , so i 'd guess the idea is that ` gd ` is `` jump to local definition '' and ` gd ` `` jump to global definition '' . 
  ninjaedit : and yeah , now i see that 's what it says right at the beginning of the docs for ` gd ` and ` gd ` . 
  `` goto local declaration '' vs. `` goto global declaration '' . 
  more the former than the latter , anyway . 
  i tend to make use of the name randomizer , but since i 'll frequently use the same set of units i 'll kinda grow attached to them and get used to their names and classes , probably as much as with the story characters . 
  sometimes i re-use names from generics of an earlier game , too ( though originally those names were randomized ) . 
  and here i thought erlang would be great at translating swedish ... 
  awesome colours , i 'll have to give this one a try . 
  looks great !, 
  the first variant uses composition of functions . 
  ` ( very . 
  very ) succ 0 = ( very ( very succ ) ) 0 ` . 
  the latter is more interesting -- we invoke ` very ` with ` very ` as its parameter . 
  if we expand ` very very ` according to the definition you cited , we get ` \\ x -  very ( very ( very x ) ) ` . 
  if we invoke this with ` succ ` as the parameter ` x ` , we get ` very ( very ( very succ ) ) ` . 
  the resulting function is then called with ` 0 ` . 
  since each ` very ` calls its function thrice , we get 3 ^ 3 = 27 invocations of ` succ ` . 
  so , ` very ` is something that calls its function thrice .
