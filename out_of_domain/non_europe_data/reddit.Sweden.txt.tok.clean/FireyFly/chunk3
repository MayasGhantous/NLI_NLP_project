  if you 're talking about the language , the standard library ( array , boolean , other builtins ) and similiar things , it definitely will . 
  if you 're talking about the syntax , then no , it wo n't . 
  there 's a lot more to a language than the syntax , though . 
  ( it should be noted that i 'm using coffeescript without using its classes though , instead relying on good ol' functions and the same old prototypal oop . . so i might be biased . ), 
  i have similar passwords with a few characters changed , those characters being related to the site/tool in question . 
  for example , i might use the prefix `` s '' for all school-related sites , `` r '' for reddit and so on . 
  easy to remember and hopefully subtle enough for someone not to realise if they do crack the password . 
  scala is n't really scrited though , is it ? 
  i 'm fairly sure it compiles to java bytecode , just like java does . 
  also , rhino is available in the j2se standard library as a scriptengine , since java 6 , which might be worth considering . 
  the scriptengine api is extensible to other languages as well . 
  i have n't used java , but from what i know of scala ( which is n't all that much ) you compile it with the compiler `` scalac '' . 
  it does support a repl though ( a console where you can input statements and have them evaluated ) , but so do other compiled languages as well . 
  would it be easy to integrate scala or groovy as scripting languages inside a java application , and execute a source file given at runtime ? 
  i 'm not familiar with how jquery works . 
  can you explain what $ . extend does here ? 
  intuitively , it looks like something i 'd use [ object.create ] ( https://developer.mozilla.org/en/javascript/reference/global_objects/object/create ) for . 
  omg , aktivitet !, 
  not everyone uses the qwerty keyboard layout , either . 
  nah , too many letter characters for j. teco on the other hand ... 
  [ probable reason ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/common_user_access ), 
  wow , you 're a fast typist !, 
  it 's worth noting that advance wars and final fantasy tactics are parts of different subgenres of [ turn-based tactics ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turn-based_tactics ) . 
  advance wars is a tactical wargame ( you produce units in-battle , there 's no equipment , units do n't have stats , etc ) whilst final fantasy tactics is a trpg . 
  i hope this does n't sound too much like a rant . 
  my point is that different kinds of games appeal to different people . 
  i enjoy both of these subgenres and i do n't necessarily find either a `` lesser '' version of the other ; i 'd say they simply focus on different things . 
  that said , i agree that improving the ai is always a better approach than a cheating ai . 
  linux , you say . . do you think there 's any possibility that you 'll release arm linux binaries ? 
  it 'd be awesome to be able to run it on [ my phone ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nokia_n900 ) ; currently i only have two or three games on my phone , and you do get tired of angry birds after a while ... 
  also , awesome graphics !, 
  keep it up . 
  edit : oops , i just realised the post is five days old . 
  looks like i was a bit late to the party ... 
  yes . 
  maybe not in the kind of game you were thinking of , though . 
  i enjoyed a music game homebrew for the ds for a while , [ video games hero ] ( http://www.videogameshero.com/ ) , and what kept me playing it was actually their [ leaderboards ] ( http://www.videogameshero.com/scores.php ) . 
  probably because i actually landed in top-10 on quite a lot of songs , and even held the first place of one or two songs for a while . 
  but yeah , the driving motivation was the fact that i actually had a chance for the top places . 
  there 's a reason for that though . 
  to add dvd support they 'd have to add royalty cost for the dvd format to the price of the console . 
  they 're nintendo , they want their console as cheap as possible , so supporting dvd playback was n't an option to them . 
  i 've no idea , but [ the wikipedia article on dvd players ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dvd_player#manufacture ) says :, 
   these producers have to pay us$ 15 -- $ 20 per player in license fees , to the patent holders of the dvd technology ( sony , philips , toshiba and time warner ) as well as for mpeg-2 licenses . 
  now , 15 usd is n't all * that * much , but to some people it probably matters . 
  you could argue that nintendo could 've released multiple versions of the wii , but that implies additional complications when certain features are only available on certain wii units , and it might confuse customers . 
  personally , i do n't really care . 
  i have a dvd player in my computer anyway ; that 's enough for me . 
  sure , but the wii is 6 years old , and as i said , i 'm just basing this on what it says in a wikipedia article . 
  you do n't want it to point to another comic tomorrow !, 
  neat , i agree . 
  look for flair , over in the sidebar . 
  `` how to bury a bay plant town '' is an anagram of `` probably not what you want . '', 
  that 'd be an [ abbreviation ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/abbreviation ) , in that case it 's also an [ initialism ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/initialism ) . 
  i agree . 
  i 'm fine with anything , as long as people use it as a * library * , and as long as people know what their code is actually doing . 
  i really dislike reading settimeout/setinterval callbacks getting executed hundres of times per second , that has dozens of ` $ ( ' #foo ' ) ` calls , all fetching the same element . 
  store it in a variable , damn it !, 
  and if it 's possible to fetch it outside of the callback , then do so !, 
  quick , switch to another tab !,

  apparently the `` two spaces at the end of line '' trick works . 
  ( two spaces at the end of a line gives a hard line break in reddit formatting . ), 
  indeed it does !, 
  [ screenshotty ] ( https://dl.dropbox.com/u/24715905/tmp/nyan900.png ), 
  i blame artifacts on maemo . 
  any particular reason for not using ` : sh ` ? 
  ( or ` : ! grep ` ), 
  i see , good point about ` : sh ` . 
  i 'm much of a novice user myself . 
  indeed it is . 
  high grove . 
  i have [ one of these ] ( http://www.elec-intro.com/cms/plus/view.php?aid=11659 ) , it costed me ~ $ 15 and it works like a charm . 
  i ca n't speak for bluesoleil though ; i 've only tried it under linux . 
  edit : err , for clarity , i meant the first one pictured : http://www.elec-intro.com/ex/05-14-06/bluetooth-usb-dongle-edr-2-0-class1-.jpg, 
  i was under the impression that bluesoleil was a bluetooth stack ? 
  is n't a `` bluetooth stack '' essentially a driver ? 
  why would it always jit ? 
  what if it judges that the jit compilation in fact takes longer than simply running it in the vm , and it 's anyway just gonig to be run a single time ? 
  i barely have any experience with android , but i 'm pretty confident google knows how to handle the `` when to jit '' issue . 
   nintendo has n't even started making it, 
  you do n't know anything about that actually ( assuming you are n't a nintendo employee ) . 
  from what i can tell , it talks about visualising 3d through the integral of 2d images . 
  not sure where the fourth dimension comes from ? 
  the same goes for nmap , i suppose ? 
  or just about anything that deals with penetration testing and stuff like that ? 
  i 've tried cave story + , super meta boy , night sky and bit.trip so far , and they all worked out-of-the-box for me . . 
  though i 've had to mess a lil ' bit with dependencies with games from the previous bundles , so i see what you 're getting at . 
  indeed , that happened to me as well . 
  apparently they released a new version which fixes that issue , but instead i get no bgm ... ( can you confirm that this is the case with the new version ? 
  the bgm works with the old version , so i do n't think it 's anything on my side ... ), 
  actually , there seems to be yet another release , which adds back a 64-bit executable . . since i 'm on a 64-bit system that might be the reason it failed for me before . 
  anyway , it works now !, 
  there are lots of patented game mechanics , unfortunately . 
  [ here 's atb ] ( http://www.google.com/patents?id=t_mqaaaaebaj&amp;printsec=abstract&amp;zoom=4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ) . 
  it 's somewhat common in smaller foss projects . 
  i think it 's usually `` if you like this software and we ever meet , please buy me a beer . '',
