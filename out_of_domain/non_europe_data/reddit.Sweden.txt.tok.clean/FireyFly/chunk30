  would n't this be [ backface culling ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/backface_culling#backface_culling ) ? 
  during winter i * walk * on the road , simply because cars have gotten rid of most of the ice there . 
  good idea . 
  have fun !, 
  what course was this in ? 
  somewhat offtopic , but here 's a great video on the inner workings of chiptune music , somewhat complementary to op 's video : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aejck5jfefe, 
  my first wondertrade , i received a spoink called `` suck my cock '' . 
  you know the good ol' notation for floor and ceiling , \u230a x \u230b and \u2308 x \u2309 ? 
  those [ were introduced 50 years ago ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/floor_and_ceiling_functions#notation ) by kenneth iverson in his book apl . 
  which , by the way , has a rather interesting take on maths notation in general ( even though floor/ceiling is probably the only part of it that has become widespread ) . 
  if you 're curious , [ here ] ( http://www.jsoftware.com/papers/apl.htm ) is the original book on apl ( its notation is a bit less cryptic than the cryptic programming language spawned from it with the same name , since it is n't restricted by the ibm/360 's printing hardware ) . 
  i find it fascinating , anyway . 
  or get one of those usb charger cables perhaps , and charge via the laptop -- then it could be re-used when they get back to england too . 
  surely you could at least install ` vi ` , no ? 
  kolourpaint , basically kde 's version of ms paint . 
  nothing fancy . 
  the northern isles used to speak [ a scandinavian language ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/norn_language ) , as a leftover of early ( ~ 800-900 ) norse settlements of the islands . 
  it went extinct sometimes during the 1800s . 
  it 's interesting how easy-to-understand the sample text on that article is , too . 
  so , my point is that at least part of scotland did in fact speak ( for a long time ) a scandinavian language . 
  well , maybe not . 
  :p i think it 's notable that norn was spoken for so long , though , and how similar it is to modern scandinavian languages . 
  but then again , i do n't really know more about norn than what i 've read on wikipedia . 
  retroactively updated acronyms is the best kind of acronyms . 
   disable syntax in markdown files, 
  you could set it to ` ft = markdown ` instead to use vim 's built-in ` markdown ` syntax file , for an even more pleasant experience . 
  ( though , one thing that 's a bit annoying with it is that it highlights indented lines as block-code even when it should n't , such as when indenting the second line of a bulleted list . ), 
  hm , huh , seems interesting . 
  very interesting , actually . 
  i guess i should 've paid more attention to the thread ; thanks !, 
  edit : not too fond of some of the conceals though . . # to \u00a7 ? 
  seems kinda weird to me . 
  ooh , very nice . 
  i attempted an ambigram for ` reddit ' once , it did n't turn out well ... 
  nl $ 1 | grep ` grep - no i $ 1 | uniq - c | sort - n | tail - n1 | cut - c9 - | head - c-3 ` | grep - op ' \\ s + $ ', 
  i 'm sure there are tonnes of improvements to be made , but at least it 's a start . 
  not too fond of that tail-cut-head-grep sequence ... 
  btw , i think it 's customary to add flag length to character count , at least in some other codegolf communities ( e.g. 
  cgse ) . 
  what 'd you submit ? 
  here 's more on that topic , for your reading pleasure . 
  please do , i love reading about clever obfuscation techniques . 
  but is n't that kinda how it is ? 
  i mean , psychic pokemon are weak to psychic whereas ghost pokemon are resistant to it , and e.g. 
  flying pokemon are typically weak to lightning even if they are normal or fire or whatever . 
  and it 's not only in weakness/resistance : sometimes pokemon have one type as `` their '' type and use another type for their moves , to reflect it being a dual-type / `` different '' - real-type pokemon . 
  ( granted , i have n't played the game in a very long time , so i 'm in the same situation that you are , more or less . ), 
  have you tried the second game in the series ? 
  ( only released in japanese , but there 's [ a fan translation ] ( http://tcg2.luminaskies.net/ ) that makes the game playable if you 're familiar with the rules already ) . 
  also i really really wish they 'd 've continued that series . .  . <, 
  ( there 's also an [ incredibly slow-moving subreddit ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemoncardgb/ ) for both games ), 
  good point , but as someone who rolled a fire deck back in the day i 'm happy with how the types turned out . 
  but you 're right , at least grass/poison ought 've been split up i think , and maybe also rock/ground and fighting . 
  fairy as its own type does n't make much sense in the grand scheme of things , and yes , they 're probably mainly added because new games and new gimmicks . 
  should be safe to just put single-quotes around it , i think ( assuming posix-compatible shell ) . 
  ninjaedit : oh , except that / is forbidden in file-names for ext { 3,4 } i think ? 
  do millennium problems grow linearly ? 
  did he create them though ? 
  from what i gather , he wrote a guide for how to create them , which would be akin to making instructions of how to create an illegal weapon , given sufficient material . 
  [ hybrid ] ( https://github.com/w0ng/vim-hybrid ) with [ some modifications ] ( https://bitbucket.org/firefly/dotfiles/src/d61694163488a5dd1db0dcd73d0a59540432f3e4/vim/vimrc?at=default#cl-195 ) and `` transparent '' background ( = # 02080f , set by my terminal emulator ) . 
  except that my e7 refuses to focus ... 
  i have n't tried yandex , but as far as apk 's go , you just browse to a . apk file to download it , then tap it in the downloads list to install it . 
  it appears next to the other programs in the list of all programs , and all ( three ) that i 've tried thus far seem to work just as well as native apps . 
  there 's two soft-buttons for back / `` other applications '' , since android requires those buttons . 
  hm , what is the benefit over built-in ` k ` ? 
  ` ` keywordprg ' ` allows you to configure what shell command is run to open documentation for the keyword under the cursor , and it could be set locally depending on the filetype using ftplugins/autocommands . 
  nope , i do n't use that feature a whole lot . 
  i should probably use it more than i do ... 
   this is n't most influential or successful swedes , its greatest . 
  to quote the article :, 
   the book is a list of the 100 swedes that according to the authors has had `` the greatest influence on swedish peoples lives , and also peoples lives around the world '' . 
  ... which sounds like `` most influential '' to me . 
  very nice , i really like the pixel art . 
  you did a great job with the limitations of pure black + white . 
  yes !, 
  it 's the best thing since buttered bread . 
  well , almost . 
  i still wish caps lock was split into two physical keys though , because i want < super  somewhere around there too ... 
   if you want to replace all previously specified options , use the - option flag with an empty argument first . 
  would n't that be ` setxkbmap - option '' '' - option ctrl : nocaps ` ? 
  i imagine it 'd choke on ` - option - option ctrl : nocaps `, 
  i thought the * ty 's were emulating [ teletypes ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:teletype_model_28_nytm.jpg ) ... 
  nice , i bet the r/o was tricky !, 
  since no-one has done so yet , i 'll go ahead and add some links to sensei 's library :, 
  * [ introduction to life and death ] ( http://senseis.xmp.net/?introductiontolifeanddeath ), 
  * [ two eyes ] ( http://senseis.xmp.net/?twoeyes ), 
  * [ eye shape ] ( http://senseis.xmp.net/?eyeshapes ) ( bodies of region inside `` your '' territory , of which you can form eyes ), 
  * [ basic living eye shapes ] ( http://senseis.xmp.net/?basiclivingeyeshapes ), 
  * [ killable eyeshapes introductory ] ( http://senseis.xmp.net/?killableeyeshapesintroductory ), 
  first , you want to understand the concept of an eye , and why a group with a single eye has to be killed by putting the last stone in that eye , and from there why two eyes causes a group to live . 
  after that , learn about the concept of eyeshape , and why the living eyeshapes are living ( how would you defend against each possible attack inside it ? ) . 
  ( i should add that i 'm very much a beginner myself , though i 've spent quite some time reading theory on sl . 
  :p you 're probably ahead of me in `` real games '' . ), 
  and he 's armed ? 
  tom tanks, 
  pardon the phone screenshot , but it * is * a linux box , even though it might be pocket-sized . 
  and hey , at least it ships with a terminal . 
  the archey output is a bit messed up since apparently while it does use gnu coreutils , it 's an incredibly dated version . . oh well . 
  it 's v6 .9 , copyright ( c ) 2007 fsf . 
  comparing with the wikipedia article on gplv3 it looks like you may be right .
