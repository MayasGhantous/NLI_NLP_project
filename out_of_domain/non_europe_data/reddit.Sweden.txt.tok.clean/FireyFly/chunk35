  edit : oops , actually , looks like it 's another one now that i actually watch it ... but hey , it 's good as well . 
  anyway , there should be an older youtube upload of the one in the op as well , but i ca n't be bothered to find it now . 
  [ exactly what it says on the tin ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fan_death ) . 
  uh , hmm . . 
  i think i drink about 1.5-2l a day and have done for a couple years . 
  i hope that 's not too much . 
  a bit more than two cups a day on average ? 
  that does n't seem like a lot ... 
  `` pipeline '' ? 
  do you mean the `` statusbar '' with url/position/etc at the bottom ? 
  because that 's just a regular firefox toolbar , so it 's at least easily hideable in nightly ( right click , customize , hide toolbar or some such ) . 
  yeah , that 's what i do , i.e. 
  ` 99g ` if it 's reported for line 99 . 
  also the related ` | ` motion for moving to a particular column . 
  i realised i really never use line numbers apart from occasionally wanting to know what line i 'm currently on , for which the ruler in the bottom right is sufficient ... so i disabled it as well . 
  check out the built-in ` ^ g ` and ` g ^ g ` as well , or ` : set ruler ` if you want to keep track of your current position without requiring full line numbering . 
  this is what it looks like when i try to hide it in nightly : http://i.imgur.com/2gmgxek.png, 
  although i noticed now that there 's a thinner bar below it if you try to hide it , so that did n't work out as well as i thought it would . 
  i ca n't find any vimperator option for hiding it either . 
  you could have just updated your ` / etc/hosts ` file with an alias for the ip in question , although the ` ssh-config ` approach has other benefits , like being able to supply a username and port to use . 
  i 've supplied both to my servers and devices , so i virtually never have to use the long name anymore . 
  edit : oops , i did n't read the other comments carefully enough . . 
  bonus tip : ` zsh ` provides tab-completion for remote file-paths as arguments to ` scp ` ( meaning you could do ` scp host : path / < tab  ` and so on , to complete a remote filename ) . 
  combine this with the controlpath tip mentioned in the blog-post , and it 's really handy !, 
  ( also , minor bonus bonus tip : the path component of a ` host : path ` combo passed to ` scp ` defaults to ` ~ ` ( i.e. 
  where you end up if you just ` ssh ` in ) , so ` host : ` is the same as ` host : ~ ` and ` host : foo/bar ` the same as ` host : ~ / foo/bar ` . ), 
  i 'm pretty sure `` sanitize '' in this context is often taken to mean `` escape '' , at least by competent developers ( i.e. 
  i consider myself indifferent to the drug legalization topic ( maybe slightly on the disallow side ) , but i do think that the political climate regarding the question could improve a lot . 
  regardless of one 's stance i think it should never be seen as something negative to just discuss an issue , however taboo and controversial it might be . 
  something i find odd , though , is the stark contrast between peoples ' views on cigarettes and e.g. 
  cannabis . 
  cigarette smoking seems to be almost ubiquously seen as something that is `` obviously '' allowed , but i would n't mind seeing it banned in public places . 
  others have already mentioned that it 's a very broad subject , but i did n't see anyone link to the wikipedia article on the topic , so i thought i should do that ( as obvious as it is , i think it provides a good overview ) : [ theoretical computer science ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/theoretical_computer_science#scope ) . 
  it 's easy to see from the subfields listed there that it 's about the mathematical side of computer science ( hence `` theoretical '' ) , and also that it covers a huge spectrum of things . 
  ^ ( disclaimer : i 'm an undergraduate ), 
  remember that you 're still supposed to make a profit , and presumably a bigger profit than the regular edition ... but i agree about `` making of '' , i 'd like to see more of that . 
  and an art book and soundtrack is always nice . 
  this is great . 
  my current high-score is ~ ~ 1890 ~ ~ 2110 :d , the parentheses are the worst . 
  i 've managed to tame ` y ` at least . 
  for the confused , i suggest reading wikipedia on [ lambda calculus ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lambda_calculus#informal_description ) and [ ski calculus ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ski_calculus ) . 
  i imagine in part it has to do with efficient hardware implementations , but honestly i 'm not sure why . 
  ieee specifies other behaviour that is similarly arbitrary : there is both +0 and -0 , and although they compare as equal they are still distinguishable . 
  the sign of the infinity produced when dividing by it depends on the sign of the divisor and of the zero dividend , so e.g. 
  ` -3 / -0 = infinity ` but ` 9 / -0 = -1 / 0 = - infinity ` . 
  another fun one is ` nan ` , `` not a number '' , which essentially represents `` indeterminate '' . 
  especially interesting is that it 's required to compare as inequal to * anything * , * including ` nan ` itself * . 
  so yeah , basically ieee floats are just a bit weird . 
  [ wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ieee-754 ) has all sorts of fun information , if you 're curious . 
  no , they do n't use two 's complement . 
  i 'm not sure if that 's even an option for floating-point numbers ( and i 'm too tired to think about it at the moment ) . 
  the representation is ` sign * mantissa ^ exponent ` . 
  i found [ this section ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/single-precision_floating-point_format#ieee_754_single-precision_binary_floating-point_format:_binary32 ) useful when learning about how they are represented . 
  the mandatory registration is a bit annoying ... 
  thanks . 
  mmm , very nice colours !, 
  [ there are worse ] ( http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:y8wamfpfd1mj:richardhartersworld.com/cri_d/cri/2001/badsort.html+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;client=firefox-a ) , if you really want to . 
  `` the worst possible '' way does n't make much sense ... 
  indeed . 
  a tail call is a call whose result is immediately returned from the function . 
  it 's worth noting though that there are cases when functions could automatically be rewritten to put calls into tail position , such as [ tail recursion modulo cons ] ( http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~jrw12/tail-mod-cons.html ) where the final operation before the recursive call is a list-construction operation . 
  i think the apl family deserves a mention , too ( not least the modern relatives j and k ) . 
  in a sense it 's the best of both worlds : allows for high-level reasoning while operating on arrays of of data at a time to allow for the implementation to use simd-tuned hardware when necessary . 
  there 's also a lot of nice anders och m\u00e5ns clips that would be fun to share , but alas , make no sense at all unless you understand the language . 
  for instance , [ the one about our dotted letters ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlavq6l9wfc ) .
