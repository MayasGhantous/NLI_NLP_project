  fira sans is neat . 
  for a serif font i 've recently taken liking to [ linux libertine ] ( http://www.linuxlibertine.org/index.php?id=1&amp;l=1 ) , personally . 
  it especially has some nice ligatures , and renders fractions using fractional slash prettily . 
  looks like the [ hqx upscaling algorithm ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hqx ) . 
  yeah , gone for me too . 
  i 'm not in the us , which might impact what 's shown ... 
  writing the digits of that number out on a4 graph paper \u00b9 would require over 700 sheets if using both sides .

  envy code r ( [ screenshot ] [ ] ) . 
  some other interesting monospaced fonts : dejavu sans mono , ubuntu mono , source code pro , m + 1mn , fira mono . 
  before envy code r i used dejavu sans mono -- most of the others had some glyphs that i found weird ... 
  i cover a lot of things via external shell tools , i.e. 
  ` : ! ` ( with a range , it pipes lines through a shell oneliner and substitutes the output into the file ) . 
  i do n't have a lot of plugins , and the ones that i do have are almost exclusively small enhancements ( e.g. 
  adding text-objects ) . 
  ninjaedit : not sure how on-topic this reply is , since ` : ! ` is probably well-known ... but it might be underappreciated/underestimated . 
  civ2 had , not sure about 1 and 3 . 
  if the outing of the developers/company holder ( or whatever you would call that . ru article ) is what sparked this , i think it 's safe to say that the plan backfired ... heavily . 
  that article should probably be submitted on its own , wrapped in google translate .

  i do n't use facebook , but when i want to interact with a website that listens for keystrokes i just use pass-through mode ( ` < s-esc  ` or ` < ins  ` ) . 
  and sidebar ? 
   a subreddit dedicated to the swift programming language released by apple , inc. 
  swift is a fantastic way to write ios and os x apps , and will continue to evolve with new features and capabilities . 
   ** input data ** will contain three ` n ` - number of values to generate and ` f0 ` , ` f1 ` - two initial elements . 
   ** answer ** should give precisely ` n ` values of the sequence . 
  weird phrasing , but aiui the input is ` n f0 f1 ` . 
  i 'll give a go at golfing this ... 
  edit : so i did give a go at it yesterday , but i feel stupid for not being able to get under 40 chars ... 
  i 'll have to think harder i guess . 
   later games you can increase the chances of them by certain means , but i 'm pretty sure 1 is just random . 
  not purely random -- the chance ( given as a percentage in the top-left , as op pointed out in an edit ) depends on the classes involved and the teacher-student relationship , iirc . 
  i do n't remember where i got that from , though . 
  about the slow leveling/money : check out the bonus items and see whether it 's worth going for geo effect chains to gain cash . 
  depending on the map it might be better to save geo panels for + exp or + hl effects instead , though . 
  you 're still really early on , so presently you do n't have many alternatives . 
  later on the item world will be accessible , which is pretty useful for training . 
  how far exactly are you ? 
  you said chapter 1 , but which battle , and are you having trouble with the battle ( and therefore training ) ? 
  about gear : to increase the selection you need to pass bills , either product-rank bills or ones about particular classes of items ( shoes , glasses , ... ) . 
  the product-rank only goes as high as your customer-rank is , though , so you need to alternate buying gear and increasing product-rank . 
  yes , you 'll need to bribe the senators to pass those bills ( and others ) -- it 's not terribly late-game stuff , but it 's certainly not chapter-1 stuff either . 
  maybe chapter 3-4 or so , when low-end items are cheaper so that you can go into the assembly with a full inventory of bribe material . 
  in postgame you 'll find it easier to just kill the opposing senators , at least that 's what i do . 
  xp is only for killing blows in disgaea 1 -- in disgaea 2 healers get xp for healing , too . 
  dunno about the other games in the series . 
  my solution for that annoying quirk was to have my healer create a mage pupil , and have the healer learn a basic offensive spell so that it could level up that way . 
  to have the teacher learn a spell , put the pupil next to it and you should be able to use the spell , and when you pass rank 1 of the spell you 'll have learned it . 
  i did things a bit differently , and it worked for me ... so i 'll add to this for contrast . 
   thieves are important, 
  i did n't bother to get one until postgame , at which point i found it easier to just create an offensive-class character and buff it with good gear , level it up to something high-ish and especially get its sword mastery up to whatever enables winged slayer , and then reincarnate it to thief and level it up a final time . 
  i ca n't think of many places in the main storyline where i 'd 've wanted stealing , but it 's certainly useful in the item world . 
   do n't bother reincarnating your other characters until you hit 1000 or so anyway . 
  i reincarnated for my first time roughly after i 'd beaten the main story , which i think could be a good idea -- not because you want the total levels , but because of bonuses to the aptitudes . 
  but i agree about not reincarnating during the main story , anyway . 
  looks better now !, 
  another thing : what is the behaviour of ` ; ` once the input is exhausted ? 
  would it be safe to assume that it stores 0 in the current cell then ( that is the behaviour of most implementations for ` , ` , leading to the traditional definition of unix cat in brainfuck : ` , [ . , ] ` ) . 
  haha , fair point . 
  i got the zombie items during a second cycle , but it 's a good point . 
  as for reincarnation , i meant for generics , i guess i should 've made that more clear . 
  i 've only played d1 and main-story d2 , so i do n't know how exciting they get in later games . 
  yeah , it 's not defined , but returning 0 is a common choice . 
  i had an idea for a solution where that behaviour would be useful , but it did n't work out in the end anyway , so never mind . 
  i managed to figure out the 31-char solution now . 
  by the way , when i submit something for the brain fibo task , it replies with, 
   you now are allowed to see other 's solutions of this task !, 
  even though that is n't the case ( due to it being a challenge task ) . 
  at least you have an android phone . 
  it gets more fun when you run neither of android or ios . 
  people seem to mistake sailfish for windows phone for me ... 
  although in many other languages the abbreviated form is pronounced by repeating the same syllable thrice . 
  wikipedia has a fun article on [ the pronounciation of `` www '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pronunciation_of_ `` www '' ) . 
   it 's probably easy to check automatically if a stage is beatable with original mario bros. mode since the possible actions are quite limited, 
  nope !, 
  it has been [ proven np-hard ] ( http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.1895 ) by reducing 3-cnf-sat to various old nintendo games , including smb . 
  what this means in essence is that it `` ca n't '' be easy to check whether a smb level is beatable automatically , so i 'm guessing the game will require you to beat the stage before allowing you to publish it , thereby providing a proof that it is beatable . 
  that 's what i read it as until i saw your post ... 
  some people enjoy levels like that ( see super kazio world and similar hacks ) . 
  it 'd be nice if mario maker catered for that crowd as well .

  edit : an overview of styles : http://xen.firefly.nu/up/filters.html, 
  i did n't always keep all my characters equipped with the latest equipment money could buy ... 
  i primarily used the money for healing , and secondarily for equipment and stuff . 
  watch out with having characters killed , because reviving them is pretty expensive . 
  otherwise , i dunno , i liked to stay a bit below the level of the opponents because i liked the challenge in that . 
  since you have the item world available now , you could try to level up some of your better items there a bit , and remember to transfer eventual unlocked innocents ( giving various bonuses to stats and other things ) to new equipment before selling the item . 
  i do n't really remember how i worked my way through early-game , so this probably is n't terribly helpful . . one thing though , make sure to have a healer on par with the rest of the party .
