  edit : which it says right in the wikipedia article you linked to ... 
   poor processing power, 
  the thing is , consoles ( nintendo 's in particular ) tend to have subpar all-around performance in favor of advanced gpus with lots of special effects . 
  minecraft is rather ram intensive , and the 3ds has got only 128mb ram , compared to 512mb on galaxy s and 1gb on galaxy s2 . 
  i actually think modern smartphones might be technically more feasible for minecraft than e.g. 
  the 3ds . 
  that said , the controls would of course be far superior on the 3ds . 
  i just want to chip in and mention that this sounds like material for a [ / r/truegaming ] ( / r/truegaming ) discussion to me . 
  i 've nothing to add to the discussion really . 
  i guess you do have a point , and i can see it being an `` unnecessary '' component in e.g. 
  advance wars . 
  perhaps it 's simply part of the `` cartoony '' style that many nintendo games follow , and maybe it helps keeping esrb ratings down ? 
  how do you figure ? 
  useful announcement , though imho capsing `` attention '' would suffice . 
  thanks for the heads up anyway . 
  edit : by the way , `` letter box '' = = `` swapnote '' i take it ? 
  i 've seen the latter mentioned now and then , but i had n't heard of letter box before . 
  all right , good point . 
  i ca n't really say that i disagree with it either . 
  apparently [ according to wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swapnote#swapnote ) letter box is the name of swapnote in pal regions . 
   there 's currently a good preview of the gameplay in the eshop if your interested . 
  what region are you in ? 
  i ca n't find any preview of it , when i search for `` dillon '' or `` rolling , '' in pal ( europe ) . 
  from what i can tell , it 's pictochat over wifi with people in your friends list . 
  relevant links with info :, 
  [ \\ [ 2 \\ ] ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/3ds/comments/nk1p8/ability_to_send_messages_and_images_via/ ), 
  [ \\ [ 3 \\ ] ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhex1oyhmri ), 
  i agree . 
  btw , apparently left/right in a similar manner switches power saving mode on/off . 
  as far as i know , . com domains are originally meant for commercial entities worldwide . 
  though . . well , the * registrar * is american . 
  so i guess you `` import '' the domain if you buy a . com domain , since it 's bought from an american company . 
  usa has their own country tld , just like any other country : [ . us ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.us ) . 
  oot 3d , disgaea ds ( well , it 's * on * the 3ds , even though it is n't 3dsware ... ) , some pushmo ( well , `` pullblox '' for me ) . 
  it 's nice that so many people enjoy tbt games . 
  it 's my favourite genre < 3, 
  i 'll go get my kssu and join you :3, 
  i greatly prefer ffta to a2 . . imho a2 was a dissapointment ( but it might just be me . . 
  i 've grown a lot since i played a2 , so perhaps i 'm just a bit nostalgic ) . 
  by the way , if tactical rpgs are your thing , you might enjoy disgaea ds . 
  that 's what i 'm currently playing . 
  i added you ; i could do with some practice of my german as well . 
  my friend code is 4554-0352-3499 . :-), 
  i added you :3, 
   the ds brings a pointing-device , but it 's physically painful to use ... you have to hold the ds one-handed ( with a hand that 's still operating buttons ) while the other hand operates the stylus . 
  i 've only played metroid prime hunters ( mostly the first hunt demo that came with the ds phat , but a bit of the real deal over wifi ) . 
  i found the [ wrist/thumb strap ] ( https://www.nintendo.com/consumer/systems/dslite/wrist_strap.jsp ) great for navigating in that game . 
  definitely better than using the actual stylus . 
  that said , the rear touchpad of the ps vita sounds really interesting as well . 
  i 'm always advocating new ideas and technology ; i hope sony continues on that path . 
  i just got here , at 01:21 2 jan 2012 utc +1 , from [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/nymwh/strangest_party_ive_ever_been_to_happy_80th/c3d021p ) . 
  the game manual link 404s for me . 
  i 'm fairly sure you used to be able to walk on the upper deck of vasa a few years ago . 
  it probably got closed down for preservation reasons . 
  reminds me of [ this ] ( http://www.die.net/earth/ ) image of earth that is updated every third hour . 
  note that only the clouds are actually real , though . 
  please elaborate . 
  i feel your pain . 
  i share the name of a swedish ex-nhl player who takes up all the google hits . 
  sounds pretty awesome !, 
  oh , and you 've gotten me rather curious what game developer that might be . 
  multiplayer works well for me on linux . 
  as others have pointed out , there 's a native linux client , so there 's no need to mess around and run it in wine . 
  i 'd also like to add { and } for quickly moving through `` blocks '' of text . 
  i find myself often using these when i feel navigating with j/k is n't fast enough . 
  . . and the rest of us * ca n't * participate , and wo n't even get any coin codes with our games . 
  not sure when that 'd be a problem ; i 'd just fire up a gui editor if a non-vimmy person needs to edit a file on my computer ( not sure why i 'd want them to do that anyway ) . 
  now that i think of it , my keyboard layout of choice ( dvorak ) and wm ( awesome ) will probably cause them more trouble than vim will . 
  have you tried kdes [ kate ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kate_%28text_editor%29 ) ? 
  i used to use it quite a lot , and it reminded me of np + + ( but better , imho ) . 
  please read the sidebar . 
  i 'm very sure that is not the reason . 
  it is in many ways about automating other peoples jobs with technology . 
   people like getting their food from people , first of all . 
  yes , this is much more likely to be the reason . 
  people not wanting to be served by machines is an entirely different reason than mcdonalds not wanting to fire people and save money . 
   also , tell me what you expect all those unemployed people to do if you automated every fast food chain . 
  find a new job ? 
  just like in every other industrialisation . 
  a quite famous example is the industrial revolution in england , when lots of weavers found themselves without a job beacuse mechanical , automated weavers were more cost-efficient than artisans performing their work . 
  see e.g. 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/industrial_revolution#luddites . 
  indeed . 
   i 'm sorry but this isaac guy is a complete fucking idiot . 
  that 's a rather strong statement . 
   politics ? 
  aesthetics ? 
  how about its in the fucking [ 1 ] ecmascript standard !, 
  i think they meant `` the best reason that people use excessive semicolons compared to other approaches specified in the spec . '', 
  for reference see [ ecmascript section 7.9 ] ( http://es5.github.com/x7.html#x7.9 ) :, 
   for convenience , however , such semicolons may be omitted from the source text in certain situations . 
  these situations are described by saying that semicolons are automatically inserted into the source code token stream in those situations . '', 
  i 'm not sure what the purpose of linking the spec was . 
  i 've read parts of it multiple times , and i 'm well aware that it exists . 
   `` you are using a hack that js parsers implemented to fix your shitty code '', 
  `` how about it 's in the fucking ecmascript standard '' , to use your vocabulary . 
  if you actually read the page i linked to , you 'd see that it references lots of other posts on the subject . 
  i 'd recommend reading [ inimino 's blog post ] ( http://inimino.org/~inimino/blog/javascript_semicolons ) , for example . 
  it references the spec a lot , so i 'm sure you 'll enjoy it . 
  i 'd also recommend taking the [ asi quiz ] ( http://asi.qfox.nl/ ) .
