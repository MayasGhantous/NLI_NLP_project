  no , but as others have said , it 's just the clone tool and then layer masks to smoothen the edges between what 's cloned and what is n't .

  do you have the image open still ? 
  it 'd improve quite a bit if you get rid of the outline of the cutout by simply magic wanding the transparent area , grow the selection by a pixel or two ( select  expand or something ) , feather it a bit and then delete . 
  then if you want to , you could mess some with the saturation/brightness sliders to have her fit in a bit more lighting-wise as well .

  i think the ` | sum , x | sum + x ` is a lambda function , corresponding to ` \\ sum x -  sum + x ` in haskell e.g.

  i 'm not very fond of any of the default subreddits -- i much prefer being subscribed to a large amount of nich\u00e9 subreddits , e.g.

  i 've installed and started it , but not played a full game ( i do n't remember whether i 've popped a hut ) . 
  my laptop is n't beefy enough to play the game without putting it on fire ( although , it does run smoothly so props to the people doing the linux port ) . 
  a sizeable subset of the people not having popped a hut might be in a similar situation .

  last i checked ( a few months ago ) v8 still did n't support fat-arrow functions and i think also template strings and maybe destructuring ( and yes , i use ` -- harmony ` ) . 
  sm have supported fat-arrows and destructuring for a long while , so there 's that at least . 
  looks like the next firefox will add template strings as well . 
  those ( and api changes , which seem to be pretty well-implemented in sm ) are probably the es6 changes i 'm personally the most interested in . 
  hoping v8 catches up so i can use them in node . 
   this album is empty !, 
  where did you find it ? 
  why would this be an anagram ? 
  this looks like the kind of puzzle one is supposed to solve alone , and just blindly guessing it to be an anagram probably wo n't help you much . 
  i 'm pretty sure this is n't an anagram . 
  i 'd start by looking into classical crypto if i were you . 
  wikipedia has a [ good introduction ] [ 1 ] on the topic .

  the css selectors spec has a [ nifty table ] [ 1 ] that i tend to use as a reference . 
  bookmark it !, 
  ( and learn about the selectors you do n't know about ), 
  oh , i had no clue -- that 's pretty nifty . 
  i wonder if there 's any language ( or implementation ) relying on these to define identifiers . 
  edit : c # seems to do this ( [ stackoverflow ] [ 1 ] ) :, 
   regarding c \u266f , from [ msdn ] [ 2 ] :, 
    the rules for identifiers given in this section correspond exactly to those recommended by the unicode standard annex 15,

  tables are fine if you use it for tabular data !, 
  the spec guys if anyone would know that . 
  i think you mean s/memory access/disk access/g ? 
  so s/in-memory/in-cache / in that case . 
  the point was that / u/mcphage seemingly compared memory access to memory access , which does n't make much sense ( or at least , is ambiguous at best ) . 
  i can navigate back and forth to that even if i click on it and whatnot . 
  not sure what kind of problem you 're having . 
  one thing that annoys me is when browsers force insert mode ( google docs ' writer thing springs to mind ) , so when you 're idly navigating between tabs you suddenly get stuck and have inserted a bunch of garbage in some document instead . 
  i 'm more of a kss person , but they 're all nice .

  all i 'm hearing is bor.bf is a oneliner . 
  wow , so expressive !, 
  when i play video games , i rarely ever finish them , at least not initially . 
  that 's not because i dislike the games -- some of my favourite games are games i have n't finished , even -- it 's just that i tend to get bored of the gameplay after a while , so if i get stuck and ca n't advance the story i tend to put the game aside for a while . 
  for instance , i first played disgaea eagerly , then got stuck at a particularly hard ( to me at the time ) level and put the game aside . 
  about a year after that , i got interested in the game again after a let 's play of it , and finished the main story and proceeded to do some postgame stuff . 
  eventually i got tired again , and about a year after * that * i picked up the game and beat it entirely . 
  i think i 'm a bit of an oddball since i 've always played games like these . 
  plenty of the games that i regard highly from my childhood are games i still have n't finished , simply because i enjoy the gameplay and sometimes ( what i know of ) the story . 
  and i think that 's fine , as long as it entertains me . 
  i agree about the `` if it does n't grab me in the first 3-4 hours , drop it '' that the op points out , though it 's hard to give a precise time i find . 
  sometimes i try a game for merely half an hour and decide it 's not for me , sometimes i 'll even play it over some days . 
  i know that if i really enjoyed the game i 'll pick it up again eventually .
