  regarding winters , it also depends * a lot * about where in the country you are . 
  winters in e.g. 
  stockholm are n't terribly harsh usually , and most of the population lives in stockholm or south of it . 
  i think your post ended up in the wrong thread ... 
  there 's a link in the box to the right in [ the racket page ] [ 1 ] : [ tasks not implemented in racket ] [ 2 ] .

   but if he steals from the bottom , after \u03c9 days , you have none . 
  i. . do n't follow . 
  hm okay , i see how that even/odd thing works . . but in my mind , even if the thief takes from the bottom , on day * n * i would still have the coins * n +1 . .2 n * since each day * i * i get the coins * 2i-1 * and * 2i * . 
  so while it is true that for every coin , the thief will eventually steal that coin , it is also true that at the point of stealing said coin i would have as many coins left in my pile . 
  well crap , i 'm not the only one who thought of poker ... oh well .

  yes , although not as much as, 
   i 'm designing a low-level language ( although with quite a bit of higher level features ), 
  which is fundamentally flawed i think . 
  i 'm of the opinion that the bulk of a program should be written in a high-level , memory-safe language with rich possibilities for abstraction , and only when necessary ( to interface with hardware , or c libraries , or simply for performance reasons ) implement * certain parts * in a low-level language . 
  i think trying to add high levels of abstraction on top of manual memory management just does n't work . 
  in a high-level language i do n't mind it however ( although i still find zero-indexing more aesthetically pleasing to me ) . 
  edit : i might 've been a bit harsh and gone off on a tangent , but i 'm just trying to answer what * would * be a buzz-killer for me . 
  but of course , there 's always exceptions , so take the above with a pinch of salt i guess . 
  rust seems interesting , even though it tries to mix low-level and high-level . 
  i would think twice ( or more ) before going down the low-level-but-high-level line . 
  i use `  ` / ` < ` or ` i _ ^ t ` / ` i _ ^ d ` ( that 's ctrl + t/d in insert mode ; they 're ` : help ` able ) for indentation , and when i need it i find ` i _ ^ n ` / ` i _ ^ p ` suffices for completion . 
  ` ^ o ` / ` ^ i ` are way too useful for jumping in the jumplist to pass out on . 
  in insert-mode i map tab to literally insert a tab , since that is handy occasionally . 
  blah , wrote up a reply but accidentally lost it . 
  what exactly is the defining difference between low-level and high-level ? 
  i think rust is a bit borderline between the two , and it sounds like you 're aiming for something higher-level than that . 
  i think we might be disagreeing only in terminology ( i might be in the wrong here , i dunno ) . 
  you are a madman . 
  i 'm still stuck at the core in my no-capsules playthrough . 
  i think the main thing ( for me at least ) is to get into the rhythm of dodging the x and getting rid of the bullets . 
  the rest is just a matter of time . 
  i buy the cheap-brand jeans at jc .

  to be fair , underneath the cheesy and buzzword-laden presetation , [ clickjacking ] [ 1 ] is a serious security issue that has to do with * positioning * two elements on top of each other . 
  the idea is that the user sees something harmless ( for instance an interesting ad ) but underneath it e.g. 
  an iframe pointed to some other domain with a prefilled form such that when you press the right part of the ad , you submit the form . 
  thanks to autologin being stored in cookies , and those cookies being sent as usual within the iframe , your click performs some action on the other domain . 
  if you give them some slack , the elements * are * stacked on top of each other , and each of them * is * powered by separate code ( the ad probably contains tracking stuff in js , and the victim site has a form and some server-side code to process it ) . 
  if they consulted someone for advice , i 'm guessing clickjacking was the original suggestion and then they added their hollywood spin to it to make it sell more or something .

  which is why dijkstra suggested to restrict the iverson-notational meaning to explicit square brackets . 
  well , this makes me curious : does the lcm have an analogous group-theoretical interpretation ? 
  perhaps the grader is old . 
  the widespread floor/ceiling notation that we use is only about 50 years old . 
  naturally . 
  seems likely .

  i do n't get the reference , but your comment made me think that strong ~ 1.exe would be more appropriate . 
  also much more awful . 
  i have n't heard of them before , but playing the devil 's advocate . . all i know about levada is that they are somewhat against putin and quite trusted by foreigners and perhaps also russians . 
  considering the reputation puting/kremlin has , would n't such an entity be a great resource to spread propaganda and keep things under control ? 
  i 'm not saying that / is / the case , just that it would be a clever play if it was the case .

  this is similar with later generations as well , although to a lesser extent it seems . 
  i 'm going to guess gibberish , since otherwise it 'd give an unfair advantage to those who learn it ( if it contains information relevant to the game ) , which i do n't think ninty would want for a multiplayer game .

  new advance wars , yes please !, 
  also disgaea would be neat , too . 
  i 've apparently played disgaea ds for 175 on the 3ds . . wonder how much i played it on the ds . 
  anyway , yeah . 
  there 's some other nis games for the ds/wii , but not a whole lot . 
  yes , but the person you responded to explicitly pointed out that even then , many parents might not know this . 
  yeah , and you can also go stockholm \u2192 \u00c5land and then \u00c5land \u2192 helsinki if you want to visit \u00c5land briefly as well . 
  i think one can usually pre-order an on-board buffet around lunch time ( we did when travelling to mariehamn at least ) , and it was pretty awesome , so i can recommend that . 
  the thing about fat arrows is that they 're really nice for higher-order functions like array 's map , reduce , filter , some and every , where the function body will usually be a short expression . 
  it does n't matter much if the fat-arrow does n't get its own line in the stack trace in many cases . 
  but then again i guess ymmv , it probably depends on one 's coding style ( i.e. 
  where along the imperative-functional spectrum one is ) .

  although , the controls seem a bit subpar to me at first glance -- the menus seem awfully small for a phone screen if they 're to be interacted with using fingers ( which is apparently the case ) . 
  well ? 
  it 's pretty straightforward , at least the first few steps are . 
  it 's not really a cipher per se , more a bunch of encodings layered upon each other . 
  think about some common encodings and pay attention to the numbers you posted , and it sould n't be too hard to figure out the first step . 
  a few steps down , there 's something that looks like a 128-bit hash digest , perhaps a md5 hash . 
  a quick google did n't yield anything , so perhaps the hash is simply what you 're meant to find . 
  shrug . 
  that is a heavily distorted top-left corner of a qr code . 
  at least distort the whole code , not just a quarter or so .
