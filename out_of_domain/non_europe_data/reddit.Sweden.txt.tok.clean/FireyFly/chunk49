  ohh , i see . 
  i 'm on 9.2 , so i should be fine without a dongle then . 
  this was pretty much my reaction too !, 
  good thing they 're so easy to spot with a thumbnail . 
  swede here , i think greedy/cheap is the first stereotype that would come to my mind for scotland . 
  ( the other greedy/cheap stereotype we have is more local , [ sm\u00e5land ] [ 1 ] ) . 
  it 's quite long , but [ shenanagan 's 151-pokemon run of blue last week ] [ 1 ] is * very * glitch-heavy , and they ( he and the couch ) explain what 's going on pretty well . 
  if it 's too long , you can skip close to the end for a * blindfolded * any % speedrun ( race between two runners , actually ) of blue . 
  speaking of blindfolded runs , [ runnerguy 's oot child dungeons blindfolded ] [ 2 ] also contains a few glitches ( in particular , i think he pulled of a frame-perfect one that would 've skipped mido in kokiri forest , but did n't go through with it because he assumed he did n't get it ) .

  it requires rank 33 + though . 
  as someone who started playing very recently ... argh !, 
  oh well , i 'll get there eventually . 
  that was great , thanks for the link !, 
  you should still be able to use the eshop from your region as far as i know ( i see no reason why you would n't ... ) , but you wo n't be able to access other regions ' eshop . 
  i love using braille as pseudo pixels . 
  nice !, 
  heh , more that i like using it as pseudo pixels in my own terminal programs too . 
  but that 's nice . 
  well , the problem is that afaik the romfs content is signed , so you would need to re-sign it with nintendo 's private key when reassembling it , which we ca n't do . 
  unless there 's some way to bypass the sign check , that is . 
  relatively recently a very old exploit in ocarina of time 3d was revealed , which be equivalent to cubic ninja in terms of what it allows . 
  i hope you 're joking . 
  i have n't played 4 , but in disgaea 1 and 2 during the main story i mainly used the item world to unlock innocents so i could move them to new items/combine them . 
  i do n't think i ever levelled an item above 10 until postgame in those games . 
  meanwhile , `` smoking '' is also a kind of clothing . 
  joy !,

  i was assuming it 's just changing the exploit payload to match a particular firmware version . 
  eh , it depends . . they could do user-agent sniffing , for instance , or detect what device is used via some other means . 
  another tiling wm for wayland is [ orbment ] [ 1 ] . 
  i tried it out a while ago , and it 's pretty decent , although it 's automatically tiling rather than manual which i 'm a bit unused to . 
   which is weeeeeeird, 
  eh , i think you 'd get used to it fairly quickly . 
  i find that when i type , i only hit one of the sides anyway ( depending on which thumb i use ... which , i notice now that i 'm writing , is almost invariably the left thumb ) . 
   to transfer a large enough set of key data that you can communicate securely, 
  just to clarify/add to this , you need as much key data as the data you intend to encrypt , since the point of a one-time pad is that it should be used only once . 
  putting milk in a kettle would be weird to me ( from sweden ) -- i 'd make hot chocolate on the stove as well . 
  disgaea ds is a remake of the first game . 
  as far as i know , d2 is only available for the ps2 & psp . 
  disgaea 1 is a wonderful game , i 'll happily recommend it , but like others have said it 's a lot more silly than ff : t. 
  [ except tetris ] [ 1 ] . 
  well , really , if you 're that good with any game , i 'd be impressed . 
  [ 1 ] : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daxpmcx2g0i?t=39m25s, 
  on a more serious note , we use [ one of these ] [ 1 ] , and i have no idea why those do n't seem to be a thing elsewhere .

  ... that 's not * mildly * inconvenient !, 
  they put up a facebook page bragging about it , apparently . 
  see [ this article about it ] [ 1 ] . 
  [ 1 ] : http://motherboard.vice.com/read/no-one-told-us-two-people-planned-to-shoot-up-the-pokemon-world-championships, 
  disclaimer : i 've only played d1 and d2 . 
  if you 've gotten to 2-2 , why are you grinding 1-1 ? 
  how does your level compare to the enemies on 2-2 ? 
  have you bought any new/higher-ranked equipment from the shop ? 
  disgaea puts a relatively high emphasis on equipment compared to stats gained by level-up . 
  i found d1 to be pretty hard until i realised i should make a healer and a mage . 
  d2 early game was a lot easier for me since i knew from the start that i needed to create a healer and rank it up . 
  at least in the first games , it helps a lot when you have a healer that could aoe-heal the entire party every turn . 
  i never felt that i had to grind all that much in the early game in the first two games , so i think there 's something you 're missing . 
  it 's hard to put a finger on what that would be , though . 
  speaking of mmos using an isometric perspective , there 's also wakfu , which i played for a bit . 
  [ screenshot ] [ 1 ], 
  ( although being a tactics game , an isometric perspective is n't too surprising . ), 
  my thought exactly . 
  reminds me of [ soundhax ] [ 1 ] ... some ds game used a similar protocol to save map data . 
  turns out you could overflow a buffer in the map data , which is n't too uncommon . 
  whoops . 
  [ 1 ] : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zed4vw2bmbe, 
   because i would then have to type ` : q ` twice to quit . 
  personal preference , but another thing that i learned to love is to use ` ^ wq ` instead of ` : q ` . 
  it 's a minor thing , but it saves having to hit enter and is a bit faster to input twice in a row for me . 
  there 's plenty of other nice ` ^ w ` commands as well , like ` ^ wv ` and ` ^ ws ` for splitting . . 
  it does -- it increments the next number after the cursor . 
  see ` : h ^ a ` . 
  it should be similar to d1 ( the only game where i 've played postgame ) , meaning after finishing the main storyline you should be able to start a new cycle , essentially new game + ( levels , equipment and money carries over , but storyline characters get locked again until you unlock them ) . 
  the first thing i 'd do is beat the main storyline again , reaching the final chapter . 
  after that it depends , you could level up your characters a bit , unlock sidequest areas ( probably as bills ? 
  ) , go into the item world in order to steal better equipment for your characters . . probably other stuff that i do n't know about , too . 
  oh , if you 're going to grind levels a bit , remember to reincarnate in order to get delicious bonus stat points . 
  if there 's a postgame-only story akin to etna mode in the remakes of d1 , i 'd probably start with that before doing other postgame stuff . 
  all in all , i would n't be too worried about doing all the postgame stuff in the second cycle -- going through the main storyline does n't take too long once you have overpowered characters , so you 'll always get a next chance . 
  depending on what you fancy , you could also try going for another ending -- i went for the best ending in my first d1 cycle and the netural one in my second cycle . 
  do these have a common name ? 
  i wonder whose great idea it was to re-use the number scheme for [ e-roads ] [ 1 ] but have them cover entirely different distances ... 
  [ 1 ] : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_e-road_network, 
  i think you 're right . 
  i stopped playing half a year or so after bc was released , and recently my brother has started playing . 
  when he showed the specialization interface i was pretty confused . 
  it also seems that various abilities have changed significantly , e.g. 
  i remember having to stand still when casting aimed shot whereas he could apparently move around during the casting time . 
  it sounds like the protocol the article discusses is a separate protocol , \u03bctp , which seems to have a bit higher amplification factor ( around 10 ) if you take retransmissions into account . 
  hm , measuring across the widest point of texas , it seems to be about as wide as germany + poland ( using google maps ) : both about 1200 km . 
  what stretch in europe did you measure ? 
  [ here 's a list of linux-native games available on steam ] [ 1 ] . 
  i sorted by user reviews , which i guess could act as a quality indicator ( kind of ) .

  first-generation ipod would like to have a word with you . 
  at least , i 'm * fairly * sure they contained small hdds , which is why their storage space was huge compared to the competition . 
  but yeah , you 're right that the 3ds 's system memory is flash storage .
