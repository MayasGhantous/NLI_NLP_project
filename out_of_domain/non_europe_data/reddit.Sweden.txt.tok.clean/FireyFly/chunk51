  i think russia is more into doing the opposite . 
  ah yes , the good old days ... when `` railroad '' meant `` infinite mobility '' and so with a railroad network connecting one 's cities one could move units to the frontline in a single turn . . 
  i do n't think civ2 had much in the way of borders either ( at least not in the sense of later games ) , though you 're right that there was a minimum distance between cities ( although i think it was pretty short ) . 
  oh , nostalgia -- now i want to play civ2 again . 
  depends , probably plenty of people want your computer/phone/printer / whatever as part of a botnet , or to install ransomware on it , or ... 
  yeah . . 
  i 'd probably pay for a full set of those . 
  i 'm pretty thrilled for this , never expected to see a pc version ... probably a bit selfish and probably wo n't happen , but i 'm hoping for a steamos release down the road ( since i 'm on linux :p ) . 
  that said , i wish they would 've done a better job with upscaling the sprites ... only giving the options of `` nearest-neighbour upscaling or bilinear interpolation '' seems pretty lazy to me . 
  there are much better scaling algorithms specialized for sprites and similar graphics , and using one of those and perhaps manually adjusting the sprites afterwards if necessary would be much nicer i think . 
  yes , that is my point ( they support nearest-neighbour or bilinear interpolation for upscaling ) . 
  in my opinion , they could 've put some more effort into actually scaling up the sprites offline ( i.e. , the actual images ) rather than just implementing two simple upscaling algorithms ( neither of which is really designed for that kind of graphics ) . 
  `` unassisted run only -- tool-assist prohibited '' was a nice touch . 
  i think it 's pretty common to have arrow keys hidden under a modifier + [ wasd ] or some such ( or [ hjkl ] if that 's more your thing ) . 
  otherwise i guess one just lives without arrow keys . 
  there 's plenty of programs and tools where vim-like keybindings work just as fine , and then there 's the mouse for pointing at things . . 
  we tend to call those chemical weapons . 
  well , about the sim card and countries ... op explicitly pointed out that it 's `` only for sale in mainland china '' , so that 's not really a valid point in this case . 
  i agree about the other points though . 
  as a followup question , i 'd be interested to know how shipping scales with multiple boards . 
  i 'm only interested in one board personally ( probably either way as long as shipping does n't end up crazy high ) , but in case we could save on shipping costs ( and split it ) i might be able to get some nearby friends onboard as well . 
  i 'm pretty sure `` vill du fika ? '', 
  is the correct spelling for ( a ) . 
  ah , that 's too bad about the price ... 
  i 'll have to pass on this one . 
  thanks for looking into it either way , though !, 
  is n't she always erupting though ? 
  i do n't think i 've ever seen her calm . 
  fair point !, 
  bell pepper , red onion , hard-boiled egg are all pretty nice, 
  case in point , i did n't realise until relatively recently that ` l\u00e5ngtbortistan ' was in fact coined in donald duck . 
  at least [ according to swedish wikipedia ] [ 1 ] -- seems it was coinvented by a swedish and danish translator , or at least they ca n't make their mind up who of them invented it . 
  i agree , just seems like a commonplace word to me !, 
  [ 1 ] : https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/l%c3%a5ngtbortistan, 
  i always read it as l\u00e5ngt | bort | i | stan ( `` far-away-in-the-city '' ) ( with the - istan being a pun on the aforementioned countries too , in addition to that ) ... 
  i do n't know if that 's intended , or just something my brain made up . 
  hmm , i would say that goofy is mickey 's sidekick , but i agree that donald duck would be the main character i associate with disney . 
  because it 's broadcast at the national public tv channel at that time . 
  he should be . 
  makes the player have to hesitate to pick it up and consume it . 
  well , curse of no map ( i like your names :3 ) is essentially `` disable map-related items and effects '' . 
  if i pick up say blue map , i want to actually make use of it . 
  similar in other germanic languages , fwiw , so i guess english is the odd one here ( which often seems to be the case ) . 
  swedish : `` underg\u00e5ng '' ( downfall ) , `` g\u00e5 upp '' ( to go upstairs ) or `` uppg\u00e5ng '' ( rise , in the sense of e.g. 
  also e.g. 
  `` p\u00e5 ing\u00e5ende '' ( `` on their way '' , literally something like `` in a state of in-going '' which sounds terribly awkward ) , `` genomg\u00e5ng '' ( walkthrough -- heh , never realised it 's that similar to english actually ) . 
  my bad then , hmm ... must 've been some other song not-quite-by-some-band that ended up consisting of members of said band . 
  ( have n't played 3 , but ) you could try to go for combo attacks with a strong character against less strong ( but still significant ) enemies to boost them ahead a couple levels , maybe ? 
  or you could just give them good equipment and that should hopefully boost their stats enough to take on chapter 2 . 
  btw , you might want to elaborate on what you mean by `` late game '' here . 
  around what level are your characters ? 
  how far in the story are you ? 
  yeah , personally do n't like grinding much during the main-game story . 
  that 's usually much easier in postgame anyway ( which is designed to be more grind-friendly in general ) . 
  the way the disgaea games are designed , after beating the game a first time you finish your first `` cycle '' -- you can then start from chapter 1 but retain all characters , items , stats etc. 
  this way one can explore different endings , grind more if that is desired , etc. 
  anyway , sounds like you 're set when it comes to levelling up your new units !, 
  ... because it was incorrect ? 
  i do n't want to spread misinformation . 
  although apparently my other comment is also getting downvoted , so maybe people preferred when i ( accidentally ) spread misinformation ? 
  i have no clue . 
  [ x ] all of the above . 
  and we ( sweden ) had the christmas goat bring us gifts back in the day too , unsurprisingly . 
  these days there 's just straw goats of various sizes left , [ some ] [ 1 ] of which get regularly torched . 
  oh ... you 're completely right . 
  i 'm not sure how i managed to mix 'em up , thanks for correcting . 
   i 've personally gone into houses ( disabled people ) , or into various businesses and also people in `` unorthodox '' places, 
  please do n't enter other people 's `` unorthodox '' places -- that sounds rather painful for the recipient . 
  heads-up display . 
  now you know !, 
  tuborg x , i love it . 
  for me it 's paren [ these ] s , [ square ] brackets , braces , angle brackets ( though mostly for ` <  ` for me ) . 
  that was about kaizo 3 ; dram plays kaizo 1 . 
  aha , did n't know there was a 2 and 3 of the smw romhacks too !, 
  yeah , dram plays kaizo mario world at least : [ agdq 2015 ] [ 1 ] , [ wr run ] [ 2 ] .

  well , the problem is that if you pick a known game and hack it , then glitches to the original game would still apply , and so tas : ers familiar with the original game would be at an advantage . 
  another issue is that the game has to be free to distribute legally to everyone praticipating , which i think is the main reason why the two games that have been used so far are not-widely-known ( basically , homebrew games ) . 
  in other words , the game needs to be legal to distribute , short enough to be viable to tas in a short amount of time , hopefully to have some interesting glitches to exploit , and just the right amount of depth for routing to be interesting without being overwhelming ... certainly not an easy task to find a good game . 
  the point is that it was a competition announced 4 hours earlier during agdq , and the tas-ing competition ran parallel with the event itself . 
  i think the race was more a reward to the winner of the competition than supposed to be entertaining ( or at least that 's how i perceived it ) , and compared to racing against a `` perfect '' tas/one from tasvideos.org the human racers actually had a chance . 
  but sure , it was n't perfect ; they 're still experimenting with the idea of tas competitions . 
  this is only the second attempt so far -- it 's pretty clear that the one last agdq was more successful . 
  you 'd think that would refer to people from the americas . 
  not really spices , but i love this recipe for cous-cous even though it 's rather different from how one usually prepares it :, 
  mix 5dl cous-cous , 5dl orange juice , 1dl olive oil in a bowl . 
  put in fridge for ~ 30-45 min . 
  chop almond and fresh parsley , mix into bowl . 
  store in fridge until it 's time to serve it . 
  originally found in a recipe to go with barbecued salmon , but i find it works well with a lot of things -- meat , sausages , what have you . 
  apparently i 'm supposed to post something here . 
  does cities : skylines count as aaa ? 
  although regardless , i think there 's different degrees of `` murder '' . 
  i mean , the violence in an fps like cs or tf2 is n't really comparable to the ` violence ' in e.g. 
  mario maker even if both involve some kind of death . . 
  speaking of curiously short fibonacci implementations , there 's a [ dialect of apl called fac ] [ 1 ] that essentially tries to tweak apl into something more functional . 
  among other things it introduces lazy arrays , which means they might also be potentially infinite . 
  it defines a recursion primitive called ` \u233c ` , and due to how it 's defined ` 1 + \u233c 1 ` ends up yielding the infinite sequece of fibonacci numbers !, 
  but then the definition of ` \u233c ` is pretty much so close to fibonacci that it 's not much of a game anymore .
