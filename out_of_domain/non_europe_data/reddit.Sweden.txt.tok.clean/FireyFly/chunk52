  yeah , but what are the chances of that ? 
  consider that the game has been ported to the psp and ds too ... 
  i think `` it was probably the oldest stuff they had lying about '' is more likely in that case . 
  well done !, 
  tcrf has some other unused content as well : https://tcrf.net/advance_wars:_days_of_ruin, 
  as someone who also enjoys searching for unused material in games , seeing this makes me happy . 
  :p i have n't looked at the aw games myself , but i 've looked a bit at disgaea and helped with reverse engineering some file formats in other games . . 
  just a quick suggestion , i would disable autofocus when recording if that is possible . 
  it 's pretty distracting that it tries to refocus each time the screen goes black . 
  apart from that , looks good !, 
  while i agree with you ( in the sense that i also personally prefer tactics battle systems ) i do n't think it 's as easy as `` x is better than y '' . 
  i think there 's a place for both tactics battle systems and more traditional menu-based ones with all the variations it has . 
  consider battles in pokemon e.g. , i would n't call them boring , yet they 're just plain turn-based menuing . 
  there 's also hybrids -- the [ battle system in radiant historia ] [ 1 ] comes to mind .

  also , i 'd like to add that there 's plenty of modern tactics jrpgs as well . 
  a big company in that market is nippon ichi software , and the disgaea series is still going strong . 
  i 've only played disgaea ds so far . 
  i love the story in d1 !, 
  i hear gameplay-wise the later installments are better ( in particular it 's pretty annoying to have to pass bills to adjust enemy/shop level one-by-one when you 're in postgame ) . 
  i 'm thinking of getting a pstv to enjoy the rest of the series , though !, 
  in some cultures d2 's act as currency -- instead of swiping your debit card , you trade d2 's for items . 
  it 's weird , i know . 
  i use it as both ctrl and esc via [ xcape ] [ 1 ] . 
  that 's a screenshot of a 4chan post , not a patent application . 
  my personal style is to only omit braces if the * whole conditional/loop statement * is in one line . 
  ` if ( some condition ) continue ; ` , ` for ( size_t i = 0 ; i < length ; i + + ) something ( arr [ i ] ) ; ` etc are nice sometimes . 
  i can comment out the whole conditional/loop with a / / comment . 
  there is no risk of commenting out or inserting statements such that the indentation deceives . 
  if i make it multiline , whether it 's because the body is more than one statement or because putting it on one line would look too clunky/be too wide , i always add braces . 
  huh , apparently you are me . 
  this is my personal style exactly . 
  found by golds on tcrf , to give credit where credit is due . 
  i 've done some file format reversing for tcrf-related investigations recently , it 's a fun way to study file format reversing if you enjoy that sort of thing . 
  and of course , it 's always cool to help reveal unused content . 
  sure , the convenient of commenting out is n't the main motivation . 
  i make use of ` / / * ... / / * / ` comments too , they 're really handy !, 
  which one i go with kinda depends on how often i 'm going to toggle between them and how many lines it is . 
  but anyway , as i said that is n't the main motivation -- the main reason is that i just find it tidier that way and easier to tell at a glance what simple statements do . 
  i like the [ ice path theme ] [ 1 ] from gsc quite a lot . 
  i do n't know if it counts as `` less popular '' , but there you have it anyway . 
  the surfing themes throughout the generations are also a bit underappreciated , possibly since you never really get to hear them much in-game -- it 'll be interrupted with another tentacruel fight every couple tiles .

  to my knowledge there is n't a game directly related to the animation per se , but the animation is named after ( and inspired by ) a series of romhacks of mario games called kaizo mario . 
  http://kaizomario.techyoshi.com/downloads.html this page seems to have ips patches for the smw romhacks ... you 'll have to have the proper smw game , and then apply the patch on top of it . 
  that 's about as much as i can help , i 'm afraid . 
  yes , that 's true , i forgot about that . 
  i read about it but never dug into it ; my bad !, 
  it 's the opposite here . 
  or rather , it 's not related to how it 's paid , but how it 's received . 
  if you receive the bill by the mail on paper you have to pay an extra fee , in order to encourage the use of `` e-bills '' . 
  if it passes tonight , maybe . 
  we ca n't vote tonight . 
  could n't tell if `` woo '' or `` boo '' or both . 
  i think woo ? 
  yeah . . very colourful . 
  is n't that most years though . 
  maybe i 'm boring , but i 'm usually more entertained by them . 
   are there any mods for it that help with the interface ( for example - showing a + / - for the stats when you are changing equipment rather than just the end value ), 
  ca n't really help you out here -- i do n't have the pc version myself . 
  i have n't heard of any such mod though . 
  i think it indicates somehow ( colour ? ), 
  which stats increase/decrease though ( but not by how much ) , which is something . 
   also , should i grind before i finish the main quest ? 
  if so , how much is too much ? 
  your choice . 
  some people like to grind a lot and then sail through the story . 
  i personally intentionally kept myself a few levels underlevelled throughout the main story in order to encourage more tacticsy gameplay . 
  play it however you enjoy it the most , basically . 
   how about going into the item realm , when is it `` safe '' level wise or should i just wait . 
  during the main storyline all i used the item world for was unlocking innocents and for some quick money occasionally i guess . 
  the level curve in the item world could be pretty unforgiving , so be sure to always save before entering . 
  i would n't pay too much attention to it during main story personally . 
   how should i grind my characters ? 
  should i just take them into a level with their mentor and a healer and roflstomp it over and over or is it better to level everyone together . 
  i prefer to level mine together as a party , focusing on the lowest-levelled one i guess . 
  kinda like i play pokemon . 
  skipped over the questions where i do n't have anything to add to what / u/yoshikyon said . 
  perhaps when we lost east-sweden ( i.e. 
  finland ) to russia . 
  or maybe we could just complain about the danes -- we 're good at that . 
  well , they were selling slowpoketails too , i guess that 's a bit like shark fins . 
  did you ever sell this ? 
  i 'm interested in it if you still have it , have been looking around for a pos keyboard with blue switches but they 're kinda hard to come by . 
  the lack of an in-game sandbox to experiment with different designs lead me to create this simple syntax file for vim ( my text editor of choice ) . 
  if you do n't use vim , feel free to ignore . 
  if you do , this syntax file might come in handy for easy mockup of designs -- i also included a textual version of the factory for good measure . 
  for now , i 've only included the buildings i have unlocked and actually use myself ( i do n't want to read too much about the game since i find it more enjoyable to discover new materials myself ) . 
  anyway , it should be easy to extend with your own characters if you want , or to edit the colours . 
  this is what the example looks like with this file : http://i.imgur.com/fb4uaof.png, 
  hm interesting , will have to give that a look later . 
  was thinking of some analysis tools that would be nice to add , but was n't sure how to extract the game state easily ... ( mainly : it 'd be nice to have some `` balance '' / `` expenses '' view per factory that aggregates money spent per component type , to make it easier to tell whether `` reduce expenses '' upgrades are worth it ) . 
  edit : i 'll add characters as i go along , but the general idea is to use lowercase for buyers , uppercase for makers and symbols for others ( ` $ ` for all sellers because the type is obvious depending on context ) . 
  i 'll probably just use the first letter of the material for as long as there 's no collision . 
  i dunno , i actually find it easier/faster to edit in vim than in-game ... there 's some features that help a lot compared to conventional text editors , like the ability to copy-paste a rectangular block . 
  it 's kinda weird but it works surprisingly well ... 
  hm , interesting . 
  once i researched plastics i decided to try to design rectangular units that i could easily just `` copy-paste '' , which while not always optimal gets pretty good results . . so my a7 looked like this , with two 4 \u00d7 10 designs stacked atop each other : http://i.imgur.com/yzleqju.png, 
  thanks for replying , i 'll be on the lookout elsewhere then .
