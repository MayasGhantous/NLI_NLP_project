  ## console, 
  * looking at the screen it looks like is 1080p multi-touch screen , according to the spec show up on the software test, 
  * can see the 5x0 .8 cm heat sink from the vent on the 0.8 cm width , 12cm l shape heat pipe , looks quite shabby but heat performance is really good , not too hot from the console , the software demo testing is millions of fish and running almost 8 days , there 's no single frames drops, 
  * the screen is not very bright , speculated ca n't see clear from outdoor, 
  * looking at the core , it 's a 10x10 core , from the test , cpu 1785mhz , gpu 921mhz , emc 1600mhz, 
  * speculated cpu is arm a73 pascal , much powerful than x1 , when tested it only shows arm_v8 structure hence the speculation, 
  * confirmed it 's usb-c charging, 
  * speculated the core is made by tsmc , but it does n't have its logo on it , looking really good, 
  * running thousands of fish software demo to make sure the system is running fine, 
  * saw orange and blue controller, 
  * heating fan noise is not loud, 
  * power adapter is external, 
  * there 's 4g console version , confirmed, 
  * can be charged while playing, 
  * battery 4310ma , 3.7 not changable, 
  * it 's been testing over 11750min , it 's all running stably and smoothly , not single frame drops using the software demo ( fish ), 
  * speculated 2x ram = 4gb, 
  * about 300g weight , thought it was 1000g or something and was pretty surprise it 's 300g console only ( excluding joycon etc ) , used digital scale to weigh, 
  ## joy-con, 
  * there 's 2 shoulder button on each joy-con , they are called sl , sr, 
  * it 's very complex inside , apart from the motherboard in the console , screen , joy-con is the most valuable in the whole system, 
  * the battery inside joy-con is about 5cm x 2cm x 0.5 cm, 
  * very light , about 50g, 
  * ( 22 nov update ) battery 525ma, 
  ## production, 
  * produced 2100 units per day in one line , the whole factory can produce 20000per day, 
  * very good quality control , do n't worry about the build quality, 
  * they shipped to japan , and australia recently, 
  ## advance version or devkit version ? 
  * a much powerful version , producing 2000x units for now, 
  * the core is 1x times bigger than the one above ,200 m , looking it looks like 12x18, 
  * 2 extra ram , this version is 8gb, 
  * 2x wifi , 1hdmi , 1x mini dp , 1x ethernet , 2x unidentified socket , 3x network led indicator ,, 
  * looks much more complex than the normal version , 6 , 7 extra unidentified storage , different socket, 
  * not sure if this is devkit , or it 's an advanced version , not sure if nintendo will release it ( 22 nov 2016 update ) confirmed it 's a devkit , and nintendo was coming to exam the devkit today, 
  * no dock for this version for now, 
  * can be plugged into tv without docking , power is inside, 
  * speculated provided the core is only include gpu , it would be even more powerful than ps4 pro, 
  * screen is the same size as the normal one, 
  * it 's much more powerful , but also much heavier , not feeling great in hand , speculated for 4k gaming, 
  * have n't seen such a huge core , and it 's 16nm + 100mm2 main core, 
  * there 's no battery inside this version, 
  will be great for me , since i 'm pretty sure i 'll want to lend it to friends when i 'm travelling , or create an account for them for local multiplayer purposes etc. 
  something i was thinking of is that it 'd be really nice if one could mark savefiles inside games with an account , since not all games have file names for their saves . 
  oh , i guess i phrased that weirdly . . that was what i meant . 
  bringing it with me to whomever i 'm visiting , lending it temporarily to them if they want to try some singleplayer game i have ( or of course playing multiplayer games with them ) . 
  i guess i had the singleplayer games in mind when i thought of several savefiles : say i want a friend to try an rpg i have ; then i 'd want a brand new savefile associated with them probably . 
  while we 're at it , might as well link to the [ movies featuring nmap ] [ 1 ] page on nmap 's website . 
  oh yeah , j 's syntax is ... well , not always the best , and could be quite bizarre sometimes . 
  the obscure number literal syntax is definitely an ugly wart in my opinion . 
  oh , it was intended as motivation for why mixed-radix bases are also common in our everyday lives , moreso than a suggestion that one should implement dates like this . 
  i agree , for actually representing timestamps/dates one ought to use a proper , well-tested calendar library . 
  time is tricky business to get right !, 
  it would probably have been better to use something like imperial units as an example , like you said . 
  i guess the 24-hour clock was just the first example that came to my mind , heh . 
  it appears to be a [ mirror-image type ambigram ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ambigram#types ) . 
  either way , i would say it 's pretty clearly along the same vein as rotational ambigrams when it comes to toying with typography/art . 
  a big difference i imagine is between crt and lcd monitors , too . 
  just like how certain dithering techniques relied on crt blending adjacent pixels together , it 's possible that one simply did n't notice the seam as visibly as with modern emulators . 
   being able to manipulate a machine is fascinating . 
  [ ... ] i 've heard people say it before . 
  you 're basically chasing that high . 
  to get that reward . 
  this is interesting . 
  i 'm not really interested in hacking-esque stuff at all , but i enjoy reversing ( especially of data rather than programs , trying to uncover how a file format works by studying samples of it ) and occasionally get sucked into trying to figure out some particular format ... and at that point it 's hard to step away , and even when i do i 'll keep pondering the data/structure i was looking at . 
  ... well the disgaea 2 pc translation contains at least two literal typos that they evidently did n't proofread , heh . 
  ( i do n't remember where offhand , but i know i stumbled upon that at twice while playing it . ), 
  incidentally , the scandinavian languages call it `` wienerbr\u00f6d '' ( or similar ) , after vienna . 
  i mean i run my fingers through my hair all the time , but i 'd really prefer to run them through someone else 's hair ... 
   because of how much public transit they use without having to drive . 
  this is the case in europe too though ( although the population density is still way lower ) . 
  ooh , very nice !, 
  the ` hash ' name definitely predates twitter . 
  ` hashtag ' derives from the ` hash ' name for the sign rather than the other way around . 
  there 's one [ by gro\u00dfglockner ] [ 1 ] in austria , which might be more accessible for central europe . 
  incidentally the one i 've seen , even though i 'm from sweden . 
  it 's a hard decision . 
  it seems to me that most ccgs ( especially digital , but also common amongst physical ones ) seem to be heavily inspired by * magic : the gathering * when it comes to game design and mechanics . 
  i 'm curious about examples of ccgs that * do not * play like mtg. 
  here are some features that i consider essential to * magic * :, 
  * players have health , and the goal is to have the opponent 's health reach zero . 
  * there is a concept of mana , which is used in order to play cards . 
  * there are creature cards , and creatures have statistics `` health '' and `` attack '' . 
  creatures are used to fight other users and to deplete the opponent 's health . 
  some may disagree with my choice of features , and may want to include features which are more general ( e.g. 
  `` phases '' of a turn ) or more specific ( e.g. 
  equipment cards or instants ) . 
  as i mentioned earlier , i 'm curious about ccgs that use notably different mechanics . 
  the only such example i know of ( which incidentally is the ccg i have most experience with ) is the * pok\u00e9mon tcg * , in which there is no concept of magic 's mana , players do not have health and creatures work in a notably different way ( and do not necessarily have an `` attack '' stat ) . 
  add examples of other non-mtg-like ccgs below !, 
  i 'm your new ~ ~ benevolent dictator ~ ~ moderator . 
  i noticed that [ one of my posts ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/ambigrams/comments/1ggxi7/firefly_ambigram/ ) to this subreddit a while ago got stuck in the spam filter , so i sent a message pointing this out to the moderator of the subreddit : / u/nickmcclendon . 
  however , i never got a reply so i figured he 'd gone inactive and proceeded to [ request to take over the subreddit ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/redditrequest/comments/1hgre4/requesting_rambigrams_inactive_moderator/ ) about a week ago . 
  and , well , here we are . 
  sadly , my timing for ~ ~ stealing ~ ~ attempting to the revive the subreddit is n't all that perfect since i 'm going on a month-long holiday relatively soon . 
  if you 'd like to help out with approving posts that get stuck in the filter maybe once a week or so , please post a reply below and i 'll make you a moderator . 
  oh , and i 've approved the last month 's worth of posts that were stuck ; if you have any posts/links older than that that never got any replies , feel free to repost them . 
  i ca n't seem to find a way to distinguish a comment hidden because its score is below the comment score threshold ( as defined in my preferences ) from a regular comment via a css selector . 
  it 'd be useful for styling purposes if these were somehow distinguished ( perhaps via a ` below-threshold ' class or something similar ) . 
  since comments below threshold are relatively rare with default settings , it should n't impact the size of a served page by any considerable amount .
