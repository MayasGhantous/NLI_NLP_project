  why , hello there , ol' chap . 
  would n't it make more sense to plot no . 
  of bands per capita ? 
  the bands/population ratio . 
  well , it is n't weighted by population ... 10000 metal bands in sweden would mean one metal band per 1000 persons . 
  looks like someone lying on their back with their face down to me . 
  i did n't even notice the link ; i thought it was a self post ... 
  i wonder when i became blind . 
  edit : nice and informative post though . 
  modern art ? 
   sl ( steam locomotive ) runs across your terminal when you type `` sl '' as you meant to type `` ls '' . 
  it 's just a joke command , and not usefull at all . 
  the detect edges and neon whatever filters just happened . 
  who 's there ? 
  i 'd also like to add that the newspaper that has allegedly read the internal wikileaks memo is a tabloid newspaper , so one should indeed probably take it with a pinch of salt until more reputable sources confirm the allegations . 
  a cock ? 
  [ like so ? 
  you can write to / tmp / < yourtmpdir  ( the working directory when you first log on ) . 
  or [ / r/nordiccountries ] ( / r/nordiccountries ) . 
   how ever the strict definition of scandinavia is only the 3 monarchies of the scandinavian peninsula . 
  last time i checked , denmark was still attached to continental europe ... ;-), 
  looks like enter works a bit funny in firefox , at least for me . 
  pressing enter seems to first jump down one line and properly indent , and then jump down an extra line without any indentation at all . 
  this makes it rather painful to use . 
  ( that said , i 'm also having issues with jsfiddle & jsbin when it comes to indentation ... maybe it 's just me . ), 
  i guess i should 've said that they are n't attached to the scandinavian peninsula , rather . 
  yes , i 'm aware of that . 
  as far as i know , they 're not strictly speaking on the scandinavian peninsula though ( as in , the piece of landmass that sweden and norway are located on ) . 
  denmark is made up of one piece connected to continental europe , and a bunch of islands , no ? 
  yeah , i agree . 
  some sort of tactics game . 
  ( [ crosspost from r/metal ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/metal/comments/q2flb/map_of_countries_by_metal_bands_per_capita/ ) ), 
  so ... how informative is this when we do n't know which country each of the dots represent ? 
  tactics games !, 
  really impressive demo !, 
  i 'm not sure what to add . . keep up the good work . 
  same for the norwegian royal family and sweden 's gossip magazines . 
  ... as far as i can remember from the last time i had a haircut . . 
  yes , there 's [ dslinux ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dslinux ) , but without a ram-pack it 's rather worthless . 
  the original ds has only 4mb of ram . 
  if i recall correctly from when i gave it a try , piping anything to ` less ` caused it to crash with an out-of-memory error . 
  aside from linux , there 's a whole lot of emulators and other neat homebrew for the ds . 
  if you 're wondering what flash card to get , maybe ask [ / r/emulation ] ( / r/emulation ) , or read previous posts there . 
  i have a m3ds simply card ( same hardware as the r4ds card ) , and i have n't had any problem with it . 
  ** edit : ** i should add that even if dslinux is n't very * useful * , it 's still worth installing it and playing around with it , just because of how impressive it is to actually see linux running on a ds . 
  you seem to have gotten quite a lot of good , informative replies , but for the next time i 'd recommend [ / r/askcomputerscience ] ( / r/askcomputerscience ) ; it 's basically made for questions like this . 
  not that it 's necessarily off-topic in this subreddit , just that there 's another more specialised subreddit which i find more proper for these kind of questions . 
  what country , if you do n't mind me asking ? 
  i can imagine that ... have you considered doing an ama ? 
  weeee !, 
  ow . . it 's hard for me to even imagine a society with such inequalities , and such slow-paced technological development . 
  that would n't look the same . 
  his top one has an empty `` sub-block '' that a full block does n't have . 
  at least over here in sweden you can get used n900s for about $ 200 . 
  oh , and speaking of n900s ... mine got the usb-port hardware fault a couple weeks ago . 
  it was actually available in my country , but still . . the lack of a physical keyboard is definitely a showstopper for me . 
  i just ca n't use a terminal/vim/what have you without a physical keyboard ( and i probably used the terminal more than anything else on my n900 ) . 
  edit : though the n9 and its meego had a very nice ui , i must say . 
  here 's hoping we get a nice , tech-friendly tizen phone someday more or less soon . 
  cool site !, 
  it complains when i 'm trying to submit one particular snippet hough . 
  i think it 's my literal nbsp ( non-breaking space , though you probably knew that ) that 's causing it . . just an fyi . 
  edit : looks like that 's not it ... maybe it 's unicode characters in general that 's causing problems ? 
  i 'd try to submit without unicode characters , but that makes the snippet more-or-less worthless . . 
  not sure if [ does n't ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cups#history ) [ know ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cups#user_interface_tools ) or joking ... probably the latter though . 
  i 'm mainly a javascript programmer , and i wholeheartedly agree with you . 
  personally , my favourite lua tutorial is still [ programming in lua ] ( http://www.lua.org/pil/1.html ) . . though i guess it is n't so much of a crash course , but rather a full-fledged book . 
  interesting post . 
  i remember that there were once a [ similar task ] ( http://underhanded.xcott.com/?page_id=17 ) in the [ underhanded c contest ] ( http://underhanded.xcott.com/ ) , where one 's supposed to black out a portion of an image , but encode enough information in the image so that it can be restored . 
  ( the actual challenge in that competition lies in hiding what 's actually going on , though . ), 
  anyway , cool stuff . 
  it 's the browser that does it . 
  unfortunately , the way html ( well , sgml really ) works means that the browser more or less has to try to figure out a way to parse your html code , even if it 's invalid . 
  hixie has [ a nice article ] ( http://ln.hixie.ch/?start=1037910467&amp;count=1 ) on the subject , though it 's rather old by now . 
  the article shows how different rendering engines reacted on invalid html back in 2002 . 
  with xhtml/xml we do n't have this problem , since it 's more strictly specced , and conforming implementations * must * raise critical errors with xhtml , if the xml is syntactically incorrect . 
   phd, 
  i 'm on my fifth or sixth , depending on how you count . 
  not everyone buys a new phone every year . 
  [ ts ] rpg high five !, 
  personally , i see the whole 3d thing as a bit of a gimmick . 
  sure , there are games that utilises it in very clever ways ( most notably the ar built-in ar app ; it 's awesome ) , but personally i feel that it 's simply easier to play regular games with the 3d turned off . 
  currently my only 3ds game is zelda , and i pretty much only use the 3d effect during cutscenes . 
  so , well ... 
  i would n't be too concerned with the 3d effect giving a bit of a headache ( for me it 's more that my eyes `` get tired '' rather than headache ) , because ultimately the game is n't about those effects . 
  that 's my take on it ; as always your mileage may vary . 
  edit : it might seem odd of me to buy a 3ds and not actively use the 3d effect as much as others do , but for me the main reason for buying the 3ds was 1 ) new , better hardware & new games , 2 ) my ds phat has gotten rather worn out after a good 6 years , and the 3ds is barely more expensive than a ds these days anyway . 
  hm , i have n't read anything like that about mk7 . 
  i asked a friend of mine who has almost no depth perception at all , and who plays without the 3d effects , and he has n't noticed any problems at least . 
  anyway , yes , i 'd say you would n't lose very much by playing with the 3d effects turned off . 
  the first one looks like awesome , xmonad or another tiling window manager . 
  the second one . . well , it says `` wm : openbox '' right in the screenshot :p . the third one also looks like openbox to me . 
  what makes it even worse is that the exe contains an embedded flash file , _ , . 
  at least the manual for my samsung laptop did . 
  i 've seen people use aa/ae/oe , or aa/a/o , or even a/a/o for \u00e5 / \u00e4 / \u00f6 respectively . 
  it 's not anything that 's commonly used , but a swede would surely understand you if you used any of those combinations instead of the actual characters . 
  you may want to look out for ambiguities if you decide to just drop the dots/rings though . 
  there 's an [ international variant ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:kb_us-international.svg ) of the us layout . 
  i 've no idea if it 's widely used in the us though . 
  probably not .
