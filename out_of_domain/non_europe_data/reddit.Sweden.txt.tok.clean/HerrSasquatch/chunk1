you 'd rather lose your legs than your hands ??? 
  or did you mean you 're glad he did n't lose his hands also ? 
  if the mods are n't gon na delete crap like this , i 'd be delighted if they could tag it as fluff like they do in other subreddits . 
  why not scrap third person or atleast make a version where its disabled ? 
  its just annoying to have to swap back and forth when in gunfights and it can be abused to look around corners and see other players before they can see you .

  asdf, 
  press ctrl + alt + delete , under the tab performance , the number of squares in the section `` history for cpu usage '' or something similar , is the number you should put as cpu count . 
  agreed !,

  starting an offline map before going online seems to fix it somewhat . 
  also i have about 190 fps on max settings in offline and around 100 with min settings when playing online ? 
  is this just valves crappy servers or could this be something on my end ? 
  yeah , i realized when i added bots in offline , the fps went down almost to what i have online . 
  a strange thing though , is that in windows i get ~ 150 fps in both online and offline : /, 
  if you are unsure , just vote insufficent evidence . 
  you are wrong . 
  you can put ` nsfw ' in between the ` www . ', 
  and ` youtube.com/watch/blablabla' , that always works . 
  nice story , but the fox part really bothers me ( why a fox of all things ? 
  ) , is it a reference to something or am i missing something really obvious ? 
  yea , i mean , cool idea , but what the fuck is up with screen going black half the playtime , and sound and video just do n't matching up ? 
  really halfassed imo .

  that is refered to as a french omelette here in sweden , regular omelette is generally what you described up top but can have all sorts of things in it , but has eggs , cheese and sometimes cream or milk as a base . 
  i 'd fucking love a clucktrack \u2122 five-seven | fowl play . 
  i have good feeling about this guy , max on nip it is !, 
  fix the hltv link also, 
  even so , it looks stupid as it is now, 
  try posting in / r/tillsverige istead , you will get more serious answers there , and not so many ` funny ' people trying to express their exaggerated political beliefs . 
  suck . 
  wait atleast a week , i think prices will go up . 
  you cold also check the prices for the same drop but from other events on market to get an idea of what the price will end up being . 
  i think fnatic will take it , they have been looking so good this tournament . 
  nip was a bit shaky against tsm in the quarters , but on the other hand played amazing against nv in the semi . 
  gon na be a hell of a game , and i can totally see nip taking it too , but i would give fnatic the slight edge . 
  just my fem \u00f6re , i 'm not an expert in anyway , just felt like sharing my thoughts :p, 
  really happy with my bets !, 
  a bit shaky in the groupstage , but koopk 's analysis helped me make a profit from some underdog bets ( vox and keyd ) , after groups it 's all wins :d, 
  yeah , i think so , just do n't expect analysis on every game and for him to be 100 % correct all the time , like some people seem to do :p,

  gah , sorry , i just have to correct you . 
  it makes no sense to use ' < < < < < ' instead of just ' < < ' . 
  it relays no more information and just looks messy .

  nah , to clunky wording . 
  not ruling out armor gain but seems unlikely since warrior already got one new card with that mechanic . 
  my guess :, 
  forbidden weapon, 
  spend all of your mana . 
  equip a weapon with that much attack and 2 durability . 
  what is taunt ? 
  what is freeze ? 
  what is harrison ? 
  what is ooze ? 
  combined with you spending a whole turn on it , i do n't think its to unreasonable .

  you 're talking to a dev ... 
  i got +9 rating for a loss , that should not be possible unless ingame score is considered , right ? 
  i was playing against players of same rank as me . 
  what is wrong with this [ channel ] ( https://discordapp.com/channels/156815299864166402/157144409941606400 ) on discord ? 
  ok , neither did i until today so i do n't blame you . 
  i thought a little and realized that maybe it 's not so bad to have both a chat and a subreddit . 
  a is chat is good for people wanting to find people to play with immediatly . 
  a subreddit is more fitting for people wanting to form a team , or something , where more people see it without the need for you to spam it every 10 mins in a chat , and you do n't care if you have to wait a while for answers .
