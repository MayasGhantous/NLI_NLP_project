  i got a rhyme to work !, 
  hello there , cheerio !, 
  transcribed :, 
  i guess it 's something among the lines of :, 
  this product does not conform to the ( korean ) standby energy saving standards ( by the energy saving guidelines ) . 
  i just google translated it , and do not speak the language !, 
  you , my good sir , are a master troller . 
  google the hashes ? 
  otherwise , you 're screwed . 
  there is no other method that i know of . 
  same problem for me . 
  using xiaomi redmi note 3 ( kenzo ) . 
  cleared cache , data , and have reinstalled the app . 
  nothing of this helps . 
  it loads for a moment and then crashes again . 
  still crashes similar to 8.0.5.7 on 8.0.5.8 - still not working . 
  it works !, 
  but , ads randomly pop up now . 
  problem solved with 8.0.5.9 !, 
  it would take forever if they searched all usb drives . 
  however , pochta rossiya are known for stealing stuff , so keep that in mind . 
  please insure it , if it is n't too expensive . 
  abbyy finereader is a very good ocr program - it can scan japanese . jpg light novel scans and is very good at it ( only problems are small \u3084\u3086\u3088 and \u3046 becoming \u3001 \u3063 ) . 
  mtl-ing and learning through that is a good way to go , if you want to improve your reading comprehension ( if you have a dictionary with translation aggregator ) . 
  long sentences with many commas are a bitch to parse sometimes . 
  it 's actually not that bad . 
  that 's what i mean . 
  do n't get the cheap unbranded shit , go for the mid-to-high-range stuff ( chinese brands ) . 
  the more expensive chinese brands tend to be fine . 
  it 's fake , i would like to say . 
  open a dispute . 
  lol i 've never had that problem . 
  do n't buy the cheapest/crappiest , check the russian reviews for pictures of h2testw reports , and you 're good to go . 
  learn some kanji , katakana , hiragana , and some grammar . 
  it is less important to learn the kanji , as there are dictionaries , for this usage of the language . 
  you might want to learn more kanji for other stuff . 
  i would recommend web novels , then manga , then light novels . 
  aww yeah !, 
  it says \u30b8\u30c3\u30dd\u30fc \u30fb \u30b3\u30ec\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u56f3\u9451 ( jippou korekushon zukan ) , meaning zippo collection picture book . 
  under title : \u30ef\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9 \u30fb \u30de\u30fc\u30af 144 , meaning world mk . 
  publisher : \u30ef\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9\u30d5\u30a9\u30c8\u30d7\u30ec\u30b9 , meaning world photo press . 
  a title is \u88dc\u5145\u6ce8\u6587\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9 , meaning replacement order card , and under that are fields for a name and order . 
  ! translated, 
  too expensive . 
  2tb of dodgy baidu pan space that 's hosted in china and slow-as-fuck-but-free is my buddy . 
  ( edit : also , even public arrr files are seldom taken down ), 
  try autohotkey . 
  you can easily write a script ( or find one ) that does just that . 
  exactly . 
  luckily i do n't keep anything that is valuable to me there . 
  super !, 
  wow . 
  creative , man !, 
  i like it a lot , got a chuckle from this . 
  it sounds like this , but it probably is quite wrong :, 
  also , if someone would like to translate it , please do . 
  i have a hard time coming up with a translation for this . 
  in addition , if you feel like helping me out and transcribing ( or translating ) more of the song , please do so . 
  aha , that 's all i wanted . 
  thank you !, 
  i understand that this line contains some kind of `` identity '' connotation , is the '' \u3089\u3057\u3044\u3068\u3053 '' part literal or figurative ? 
  is the song ** literally ** about `` turning your eyes toward a place like mine '' , * or * `` turning your eyes toward my identity '' ? 
  ! translated, 
  thank you !, 
  i am so sorry for asking so much of you !, 
  it is not cancelled , the seller gave a fake tracking number !, 
  the seller will probably ship the item to you , as they want your money which they wo n't get until you have confirmed that the order has arrived , but it will probably take forever . 
  if it does not arrive within , say , 60 days , open a dispute and get a refund . 
  if there were subtitles and some money , this could probably be done by someone . 
  wow . 
  i am not angry , but amused . 
  that is a huge bundle of anger , better sort that out somehow . 
  thankfully , that problem would be very cheap ( if not free ) to solve here in sweden . 
  our ( sometimes immigrant ) doctors will be sure to help you , without prejudice . 
  i hope you visit soon . 
  try filling in the first box with your english name , and the second box with katakana - as far as i know , that 's what the error is . 
  nearly rivals some small cities in hertfordshire . 
  yes . 
  i 've seen worse . 
  holy fucking shit , that was so autistic that i started to feel like one myself . 
  i was in roseng\u00e5rd , malm\u00f6 yesterday and ate a really good kebab . 
  lots of arabic-looking people and serbs , but it did n't feel dangerous or anything . 
  my daily life has n't changed , and i do n't feel less unsafe than , say , 10 years ago . 
  isk and takstar stuff is very good . 
  you can check web.archive.org - i happen to know that the removed links are archived there . 
  daughterboard/usb board maybe dead . 
  it could also have something to do with the motherboard . 
  also , please stop being so bitter toward everyone here , we 're just trying to help . 
  about the motherboard :, 
  i would like to guess that the connection between the battery and motherboard is dead . 
  you could try to charge the phone with no battery , but via the motherboard connectors instead . 
  if it works then , the connection between the motherboard is unstable . 
  otherwise , the daughterboard could be dead and the battery charging is n't working . 
  the only way to try is to charge the battery by other means and re-connect it - if it works then , the usb board is dead . 
  i do n't really have much more to add . 
  have you tried a hardware reset ? 
  sorry about that , man . 
  i understand about the caps now , but you do ( without any context ) sound pretty angry . 
  please note that i am no professional . 
  ok there - i certainly understand you - i got screwed because of a faulty phone , 255 usd + shipping to china .
