  it even says that you can when you cancel a dispute in the app . 
  as long as you have purchase protection time left . 
  i find what you have written a little unclear - have you tried no symbols ? 
  that sucks . 
  therefore , it is a good oyaji gag . 
  if i were to purchase a cd or two from yahoo auctions or amazon , how much would your fee be ? 
  second-hand , under 500 \u00a5 ( +350 \u00a5 shipping ) a piece . 
  yeah , i agree . 
  yeah , it was the old policy , i remember it too well . 
  thanks !, 
   no tracking, 
  keep the items if you want , no-one will know . 
  or if you feel unsure , inform the seller and buy a new item , but ask the seller to not send it . 
  yeah , it took a few days for my tracking to show up too . 
  fewer than ten , though . 
  ahh , the 28 year memorial of nothing . . !, 
  the god . 
  when on hd mode , the images turn black and white . 
  ** device information : **, 
  relay version : 8.2.48 pro, 
  phone : xiaomi redmi note 3 ( redmi note 3 ), 
  android version : 6.0.1 ( 23 ), 
  you 're slightly screwed , i 'm sorry to say . 
  i have n't been able to cancel after the payment has finished processing . 
  the seller must accept it , which they most probably wo n't , judging by the cancellation message . 
  i guess so . . you could try messaging the seller not to ship it , and try chatting with aliexpress support too . 
  i have no reason not to post . 
  could you give these to me , please ? 
  the language is very archaic at times . 
  ( i believe that this translation is from 1917 ), 
  as emmison says , this is from the acts of the apostles ( 2:37 -2:40 ), 
  i will try my best to translate it literally , not like the english translations out there . 
  they can be found here :, 
  [ https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=acts+2:37-40] ( https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=acts+2:37-40 ), 
  ** 37 ** when they heard this , they felt pain in their hearts . 
  and they said to peter and the other apostles '' brethren , what shall we do ? '', 
  ** 38 ** peter answered them '' do better , and let all baptize you in the name of jesus christ for the absolution of your sins ; then you shall receive the holy spirit as a gift . 
  ** 39 ** for the pledge applies to you and your children , likewise to all those that are in the distance , as many as the lord , our god , calls . '', 
  ** 40 ** and with many other words he asked and cautioned them , in which he said '' let yourselves be redeemed from this distorted kind . '' '', 
  this week 's text ( in swedish ) :, 
  yes , to `` g\u00f6ra b\u00e4ttring '' is literally to `` do better '' , but is better conveyed by `` repent '' . 
  in this context , definitely repent . 
  this is not , however , the bible that is used nowadays . 
  `` bibel 2000 '' is widely used , and is in slightly more modern swedish . 
  what postal service is it sent with ? 
  if it is sent with any postal service that is not china post , the item is sent from china to a second ( transit ) country , and then to your country . 
  the second `` arrive export exchange '' is from when the item has left the transit country . 
  if it is sent via china post , it is normal . 
  china post is completely inconsistent , in terms of scanning . 
  if you want to , you can go to `` intmail .11185 . cn '' and give me a screenshot of the results you get when you search for your tracking number . 
  i might be able to help you . 
  it has been sent from shenzhen to shanghai and then to shenzhen again . 
  it could be a returned parcel due to it failing a x-ray scan or something ? 
  what have you purchased , and have you tried messaging the seller ? 
  it could also just be sent to shenzhen to be re-routed through another airport , but that possibility is low . 
  comfortable shoes . 
  some guy said that you should n't be frugal on stuff that keep you from the ground . 
  i agree - you can ( hypothetically ) forgo underpants , but seldom shoes . 
  i use xrecode ii to convert to wavpack ( except if i want to upload the music somewhere else , then it 's kept in flac ) , i use mp3tag ( most often , musicbrainz ) to tag them , and play them in foobar2000 . 
  swedish :, 
  the google translate voice is pretty good . 
  however , put the stress on `` kvar '' , not `` dr\u00f6j '' . 
  i really would like to purchase \u9ed2\u876a\u8776 ( kuroageha ) 's demos and videos . 
  if any albums are fairly priced ( not capriccio , please ) , i would be interested in buying those too . 
  also looking for any kind of information about skywings - the advent melody . 
  by `` information '' , i mean booklet scans , lyrics ( in japanese that i may or may not attempt to translate ) , rips ( of the long-oop remaster ) , or physical copies of the album that are n't 350 usd . 
  * ( my apologies if anything is prohibited to ask for !, 
  it 's a good enough approximation . 
  90 degrees ? 
  how are you still alive , you must be close to boiling !, 
  i do n't want to be a smart-ass , but yes , that was a celsius joke . 
  well , i have always received both epacket and sf express within 10-30 days . 
  in addition , epacket has tracking and express service/ems service in my country ( sweden ) . 
  for over-ear , isk hp-2011 . 
  in case you do n't find anything , i could do this for a small fee . 
  i have sent some stuff from here already ( fidelio x2 ) , and i have a few vouches . 
  i would really appreciate a digitalization of the record , maybe some more pictures ? 
  for archivation purposes . 
  cheers !, 
  i am looking for some chifi iems , sub $ 30 usd , with mic . 
  i like neutral-sounding ones , perhaps slightly v-signature inclined . 
  some bass would be wonderful too . 
  what can you recommend ? 
  are the tennmak pros any good ? 
  memt x5 ? 
  swedish :, 
  the usage of `` att '' is apparently subjective . 
  i would definitely use it , but i know people that would omit it . 
  i would like to take you up on your offer . 
  i will pm you . 
  to europe , it 'll take about two weeks . 
  every time . 
  i love it , it 's so consistent !, 
  mmm . 
  gift cards ... count me in . 
  fy fan . 
  this is indeed swedish , and the font of the little booklet thingy screams 1970s . 
  the company was named `` scandia present '' . 
  ~ ~ i might be able to translate this later . ~ ~ wikipedia : https://sv..wikipedia.org/wiki/scandia_present_ab,
