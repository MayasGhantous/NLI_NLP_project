  scandia present has developed a complete series of cast-iron products - a classic material for a real gourmet . 
  this is why we call this product series `` scandia gourmet '' . 
  the entire series is uniformly designed in a new , functional design . 
  at the same time as the food in the pot is cooking you can heat up or scallop another dish in the turned-up lid . 
  * ( but if there are any leftovers left in the pan , move them to another container . 
  a cast-iron pot is not suitable for fridge storage . 
  ( under this , there 's some maintenance information . 
  wash with warm water [ light heat ] and dry with paper after use , etc. ), 
  ** both lid and `` casserole '' at the dame time **, 
  the lid of the pots and the saucepan are turnable ( upside-down ) and become an extra `` casserole '' at the same time as they can be used as lids . 
  ** why is cast-iron from scandia gourmet so good ? 
  the surface is `` seasoned '' and ready to use . 
  simply wash in warm water and dry it with paper the first time . 
  the warmth is spread out properly . 
  the iron resists high heat . 
  the products have good frying properties . 
  they can be used both in the oven and on the stove . 
  * the wooden handles ca n't be used in the oven * . 
  definitely unusual , contact the seller . 
  this is entirely in katakana , meaning that it 's a loanword . 
  i find no good word for mead apart from \u30df\u30fc\u30c9 , and i would like to argue that \u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30eb\u30df\u30fc\u30c9 sounds better that \u308a\u3093\u3054\u306e\u30df\u30fc\u30c9 or any variation thereof . 
  i would like to call this correct , but please confirm with someone else . 
  turkdown . 
  i like it , but it 's a cbox . 
  turboencabulators , and the posters especially , are incredibly hard to get hold of nowadays . 
  your only luck will be e.g fischer ( or someone that is very close to his re-production facility ) - you should have his info in your torque ferbulator manual somewhere . 
  try needrom , do not flash bootloader . 
  what ? 
  only took 5 hours of wait plus 1.5 hours of interview for me . 
  that 's unfortunate . 
  this is absolutely not a hardbrick - mediatek devices are incredibly hard to hardbrick . 
  i am very sure that this is a softbrick , fixable by re-flashing the rom ( if you can find one that worls , that is ... ) . 
  you are , quite probably , encountering driver errors , hence the sp flash tools error . 
  check china-devices . com for a tutorial , needrom.com for a rom , and do n't flash the bootloader for the sake of god/allah/pizza !!, 
  i agree . 
  allison 's really good . 
  cbox = chatbox . 
  kensuke 's kingdom by michael morpurgo ? 
  not exactly that plot , but very similar . 
  baidu pan offered 2tb . 
  i was happy to take them up on that offer . 
  i never use it for personal stuff , so i really have nothing to lose ( yet !, 
  calling chinese emergency services be like :, 
  ( qualified guess of the translation : underwear - memories of the body : the soviet era . ), 
   the author/publisher should be :, 
  the credited curators are :, 
   moscow , 2000 . 
  additionally , there are some more names under the copyright notice :, 
  there are lots of other names that i ca n't be bothered to transliterate , but they should be largely irrelevant to a library , as they seem to be a full list of members of staff that worked with this catalogue , as well as dedications . . ? 
  this book is an `` exibition catalogue '' , i guess with images ? 
  i do n't speak russian that well . 
  i recommend that you wait for someone else to double-check . 
  thanks for the corrections !, 
  ! translated , i guess . . ? 
  however , the tracker really helps with seeds sometimes . 
  i recommend that you register an account . 
  i find no booklet scans either . 
  i guess transscription is the only way to go , but my japanese is not that good yet . 
  the first part looks to be \u5c0f\u54c8\u513f ( little ha ) , followed by \u8fd8\u8bb0\u5f97\u66fe\u7ecf something something ( \u4eec ? ) . 
  please keep in mind that my ability to read chinese handwriting is about as good as a penguin 's ability to fly . 
  especially the two last characters , are a bit like a hanzi smoothie for me , i believe that someone like / u/kungming2 or any other fantastic chinese-speaking guy/gal could help you a lot better . 
  thank you so much !, 
  exactly . 
  unbiased sources are not for / r/sweden . 
  the only things allowed here are biased socialist newspapers . 
  * fy fan . 
  older stuff , like billy & the sluts ? 
  think 1994 . 
  it wo n't be on spotify though . 
  i think they mean an invoice template ( a.k.a a sample of the invoices that are valid in mexico ) . 
  first of all , sorry for the crappy picture !, 
  second , i am so excited for the kimchi , and the other candy stuff i received . 
  thank you so much for doing this !, 
  by the way , i received this in 4 days . 
  for the record , i live in sweden . 
  this was over a week-end . 
  this was crazy . 
  i hope it has !, 
  i 'm waiting for any updates !, 
  yeah , same for me ( sweden ) as well . 
  however , this was really fast . 
  i guess that ems is really good ( and hopefully quite cost effective in asia ) . 
  ojojoj ... fy ... fan . 
  this is pathetic . 
  dispute it . 
  now . 
  with what letter does the tracking number begin and end with ? 
  it should be normal . 
  contact aliexpress , they might be able to do a courtesy refund . 
  have you got a tested carbon monoxide detector ? 
  there was a famous / r/legaladvice thread where a guy thought that his landlord broke into his apartment and put post-its there . 
  some commentor asked if he had a co detector ( because op said that ha had bad headaches , a symptom of co poisoning , [ co can make you do weird stuff while it poisons you ] ) . 
  op did n't , and the house happened to be full of co. 
  because of this question , op 's life was , quite literally , saved . 
  this question resembles that thread ( sleepwalking ) , and so i decided to ask . 
  the middleman gets better prices because they ship in bulk . 
  lyrics :, 
  martial soul ? 
  military soul ? 
  good transcription !,
