  however , i seem to remember than it was from jordan . 
  good luck , i guess ... 
  please tell a noob , why the downvotes ? 
  that message means that the parcel has been received in hong kong , not sweden . 
  check the tracking here : https://tracking.directlink.com/multipletrack-client2.php, 
  from there , i get `` 23/07/17 15:42 - order departed on flight from origin '' , which means that the order is somewhere between hong kong and singapore , where it is routed through . 
  this wo n't take much more than two weeks . 
  you will , most probably , see an update from singapore , as well as one from sweden , before the item arrives to your country . 
  downvotes , my good sir . 
  the song '' [ bha - vi kn\u00e4cker dig ] ( http://www.rappa.fett.nu/boltzmann_-_bha_vi_knacker_dig.mp3 ) '' ( mp3 warning ! ), 
  is so bad it 's good . 
  lyrics : http://www.rappa.fett.nu/bha.vi.knacker.dig.text.html, 
  also '' \u00f6ver-\u00f6vermorgon '' is used sometimes ( but it 's pretty colloquial , and not very common ) . 
  i am pretty sure that that address is for a shelf company , as i googled the address and found that multiple other companies are registered on the exact same address .

  kinesisk tull har jag ingen som helst koll p\u00e5 , men kolla [ h\u00e4r ] ( http://english.customs.gov.cn ) . 
  i might do , if nothing else comes up . 
  no , it is not valid , as china is not in the eu . 
  br\u00f6n . 
  open a dispute now . 
  ask for a refund . 
  give proof . 
  done . 
  after a while . 
  it takes time . 
  the link works for me as well . 
  open a dispute , and ask for however much money you want back ( refund only , not refund and return ) . 
  the seller is lying . 
  continue the dispute . 
  you can extend protection for 120 days . 
  i have had good experiences with the disputes ( refunds to me ) , but then , again , my account is in good standing . 
  you need some arguments for why aliexpress should refund you , the more the better . 
  if the seller does n't agree and aliexpress agrees with you , you will get the money anyway , because aliexpress holds the money until after you have confirmed the order . 
  that 's the right thing to do . 
  make sure to take some good proof pictures for evidence , and to argument well .

  thanks !, 
  `` to recount '' was the word that i was looking for .

  i am very jealous , and very intrigued . 
  ugreen ? 
  i would recommend / r/translator . 
  quite definitely not . 
  it may be better , but it 's still shit . 
  you can polish a turd , but it 's still a turd . 
  open a dispute a few days before then . 
  there is a reason for disputing that you can select , named `` tracking is invalid '' , or something like that . 
  do n't worry , aliexpress holds on to your money until you have said that you have received the item . 
  you will get it back . 
  do it . 
  it is n't really strange , different sellers use different shipping companies . 
  some sellers are good and ship fast , while some do n't . 
  i 'm not defending shoplifters , but i am `` condemning '' excessive use of force by loss protection . 
  in addition , in other countries that have a proper social security net , there is no real need for foodbanks . 
  if , for an example , the us had a proper one , i personally would think that the amount of people shoplifting food would be lowered ( however , now i 'm going politics and off-topic ) . 
  i do n't want to be an asshole right , but your local post office can probably help you with that . 
  i recommend dhl , or any service that is not-chinese-state-owned for china , as usps/china post will probably mess up and screw the recipient ( * what do you mean package , never received * ) . 
  tl ; dr : use dhl/fedex/ups for the shipment . 
  go to your local post office . 
  buy a shipping label . 
  write a cn22 label . 
  send it . 
  i agree . 
  can you maybe pm me the tracking number ? 
  i do have experience with shipping . 
  the number is in a valid format , but it has no tracking update at all - it 's a dud . 
  you have n't done anything wrong ( or stupid ) . 
  i recommend that you dispute it now . 
  either choose the reason `` purchase protection is running out , but the item is still in transit '' ( or something like that ) , or `` tracking is invalid '' ( or something like that ) , and add screenshots from auspost and ems.com.cn as evidence . 
  in the notes , write in simple english that there is no tracking , the method is invalid , the seller does n't answer to any inquiries , and that the purchase protection time is running out . 
  good idea . 
  that is , if they were sent using the usps ems service and not normal airmail ( normal airmail is delivered by china post ) . 
  in addition , ems is state-owned . 
  crashes for me when i long press the comment button .

  mate , no . 
  aliexpress will not accept it , probably . 
  in addition , i 'm sorry to say that it 's a dick move .

  i have the lyrics to the rest of the song , but i can not for my life hear what this person is singing in the outro, 
  one reason might be because this song is mixed like ass .
