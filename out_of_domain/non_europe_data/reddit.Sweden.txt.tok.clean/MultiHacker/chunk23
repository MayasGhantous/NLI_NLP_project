  i forgot !, 
  r.i.p headphone users !, 
  he 's especially bitter and jaded today , do n't take it personally . 
  aye , ok , it 's most likely to be so , right . 
  that is seriously close , but it is not dead end . 
  so that finish is called `` snake skin '' . 
  thanks !, 
  message the seller and ask them to make an exception . 
  you might get the discount ( a valid method to change prices ) , but in this case the seller is out to screw you . 
  dispute . 
  i beseech you , having wasted many seconds - please do not make the state obligatory . 
  is n't the `` word translation '' resuscitation ? 
  i believe that , the reading that is commonly used in japanese is `` kishikaisei '' . 
  same here . 
  the mp4 version works .

  is there a model number somewhere ? 
  a swedification of `` nice '' . 
  that sounds very plausible . 
  thank you so much !, 
  i got confused by the second sa in '' \u3044\u3055\u3055\u304b '' , and thought that the guy added a dakuten there . 
  `` stylish ( or cool ) '' , i guess . 
  ! translated, 
  for me , it can take from three days to two weeks . 
   mini cinnamon roll things, 
  they are called gifflar . 
  i might be able to exchange some time later this week/next week , in case you want swedish stuff . 
  i think that the good people at / r/tillsverige would know more than us , normal mortal beings . 
  all right !, 
  let us see . 
  ( edit : karmans v\u00e4gar \u00e4ro outgrundliga ), 
  this is not only tategaki , but also handwritten . 
  something i do not appreciate as a japanese beginner . 
  the singer sings '' \u611f\u3058\u308b '' in this place , but the text seems like it differs . 
  the song in question is `` sakrun - \u767d\u663c\u306e\u8db3\u8de1 '' . 
  thanks !, 
  ! translated, 
  sorry , please do n't count on me yet . 
  need to get my finances in order first . 
  * facepalm * is the third character a '' \u308c '' ? 
  thought it looked like some messy unknown kanji . . well well , you learn something every day . . 
  thanks !, 
  ! translated, 
  thanks !, 
  yeah , it 's painfully slow . 
  how are you pulling it btw ? 
  it has just left shanghai , according to the chinese postal service ( at intmail .11185 . cn ) . 
  i have successfully purchased with a debit visa card on aliexpress . 
  i have n't seen him , but i 'm going to wop his ass when i find him . 
  where is my toilet paper that he said he would go get ? 
  i gave money to that little bastard . 
  yeah . 
  in case you do n't want to be stuck there for hours ( because , inevitably , sally will speak to you ) , mackintosh 's on west has some good toffee . 
  if it 's untracked , i extend for 30 days when there is 10 days left , wait until there is 5 days left after the extension , and then dispute . 
  answered . 
  let 's see if this works out . 
  screwdriver ? 
  where ? 
  all of it . 
  ask for the live chat person 's supervisor , and ask for an update yet again . 
  you will probably receive the refund , but it will take a while . 
  ask a question that is bound to get you to a human ( what to do if a seller does n't answer ) , and ask the human for the supervisor . 
  or , ask the human for any more information . 
  there is n't really that much more to say . 
  ask the live chat . 
  they can help you better than we can over here . 
  why does my cassette rip drop out on the left channel , at places ? 
  can it have anything to do with the deck ? 
  at least it 's entertaining ... right ? 
  shaken , not stirred . 
  same here .

  where do to live , and how long exactly ? 
  want tabs ? 
  i can pm you . 
  i sent you a pm !, 
  living the vischan-life . 
  i am pretty sute that this post ( op ) is spam . 
  dhgate is good for stuff like this though . 
  yamaha decks are good too !, 
  what do you mean ? 
  i can find loads of tea if i search for it . 
  tea is not , and has never been , banned . 
  mate , wait a few more days . 
  three days in processing is nothing . 
  it might be customs , but i do n't know . 
  try compressing them further ( under 1.5 mb ) . 
  i had the same problem , before i started doing this . 
  i 'm sorry to say that you 're out of luck . 
  try the live chat , but do n't count on anything . 
  next time , check the quality before you confirm the order/the dispute time runs out . 
  yeah , the good reviews are always russians . 
  i do n't want to generalise , but i seem to see that they have low standards ( it 's a trend , really ) .
