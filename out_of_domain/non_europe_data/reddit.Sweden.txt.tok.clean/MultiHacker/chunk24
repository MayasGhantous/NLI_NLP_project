  fun fact !, 
  bl\u00e5man ( blue man ) is old swedish ( possibly existing in other language ) , meaning a dark-skinned person - early on , there was no word for `` black '' , only `` blue '' . 
  i try to open some imgur albums sometimes - sometimes it works , sometimes it does n't . 
  ** device information : **, 
  relay version : 8.2.63 pro, 
  phone : xiaomi redmi note 3 ( redmi note 3 ), 
  android version : 6.0.1 ( 23 ), 
  excuse my correction , but it 's `` ditt svar '' , because it is `` ett svar '' . 
  try delight mobile/vectone as well . 
  i seem to find that the rates are better with them . 
  figured . 
  i guess it 's from old norse , then . 
  where do you live , and what service was the tablet sent with ? 
  $ paid $ 9.30, 
  $ paid $ 9.30, 
  damn . 
  sorry mate . 
  transaction performed w / / u/roseychu, 
  op 's role : buyer, 
  skill/service provided : purchasing a cd from yahoo auctions ( japan ), 
  payment method & amount : paypal , 9.30 usd . 
  probably . 
  i have the same problem , and sure would appreciate help too . 
  however , do n't expect it - phone numbers in china are connected to picture id , so if someone does something dumb with an account verified by another person , that other person can get in trouble . 
  not to be that guy , but they are pretty raw ( non-edited ) . 
  speaking as an editor of the lns , volume 21 is in full swing after a. . . well ... longer break , so to say . 
  we are doing the rest of 21 first , then 22 , and then re-tling the shitty mtl volumes ( ~ 9-14 ) . 
  the series is finished - they got another editor to do the last two volumes , with the original writer 's plot . 
  the seller will probably not send , but it does n't hurt to wait it out - it might happen . 
  anyway , you will get your money back ( if the seller does n't send the item ) . 
  what site ? 
  different sites use different companies , that might have different solutions . 
  he 's just bitter . 
  renting first-hand is probably not an option , just so you know . 
  that 's when you rent from a landlord . 
  second-hand renting is when you rent from another person , that owns/is renting the apartment . 
  definitivt . 
  yeah , facebook groups are great . 
  food is definitely more expensive compared to montenegro , but i do n't know to what extent . 
  as i do n't live in stockholm , you might be better off asking someone else about this . 
  cheers mate , good luck !, 
  google ups my choice , and get it delivered to a local ups access point . 
  ! translated, 
  swedish ( nils ferlin - en valsmelodi [ a waltz melody ) ) :, 
  the day has ended , the darkness has awakened ,, 
  stars and cats and wrenches ,, 
  filled with filth , scum and vagrants ,, 
  police houses and jails sleep . 
  the child , it beholds , in the noise of its dreams ,, 
  how an angel with lanterns walks around our houses ,, 
  and alone in the late evening ,, 
  i fight with a languorous waltz ,, 
  and i am pretty skinny on my legs ,, 
  the same for my arms and neck . 
  i have sold my songs to places of enjoyment ,, 
  and god may forgive me for some of those lines ,, 
  for i am pretty skinny on my legs ,, 
  the same for my arms and neck . 
  the son of mortification in the grammophone ,, 
  flounces for hansel and for gretel . 
  buffoon oh yes , joker oh yes ,, 
  it can be good to know . 
  give me a word that rhymes with sun ^ 1 ,, 
  while i have already used fun and done ^ 2 . 
  alas , alone in the late evening ,, 
  i fight with a languorous waltz ,, 
  and i am pretty skinny on my legs ,, 
  the same for my arms and neck . 
  i have nothing at all in this world to win ,, 
  and soon in my pit the worms shall find ,, 
  that i am pretty skinny on my legs ,, 
  the same for my arms and neck . 
  notes :, 
  ** i have not bothered to preserve the original rhymes at all , since i have wanted to preserve the meaning rather than the feel . 
  1 and 2 : in the original text , the words are `` sun '' , `` violin '' , and `` violet '' , and they rhyme in swedish . 
  lille bror s\u00f6derlundh composed a song to this poem , with the same name . 
  it can be listened to [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlpevjsfxiu ) . 
  tsdm is a chinese forum , but a pain in the ass to use . 
  this is a tracking message from singapore post , and it means that the order can be anywhere between china and singapore - as sellers on aliexpress first print a shipping label ( which singapore post can see ) , but use a fulfillment company to take the order from china to singapore . 
  singapore post ca n't track the item that well , until it has arrived to singapore ( you will see a message that says `` despatched to overseas '' ) . 
  for further , more exact tracking for items sent using singapore post/aliexpress standard shipping , see `` xoms .4 px.com '' , the website to the fulfillment company . 
  everything is not epacket . 
  you can see if an item 's tracking number is epacket by seeing if the number meets the format l * ######### cn , where * is a letter and # are numbers . 
  they 're $ 6 . 
  when it 's closed , you can do absolutely nothing ( you ca n't dispute , etc. ) . 
  if the time is running out , ask the seller to extend it for another 30 days . 
  if that is running out , dispute the order a few days before it ends . 
  no probs . 
  just make sure to never let the time expire . 
  on another note , when you dispute , the seller might urge you to change the reason of the dispute , tell you to give them your paypal email so that they can refund you , or cancel the dispute . 
  do n't do anything of it , they 're probably out to save their skin and screw you over . 
  on yet another note , film when you open every package . 
  that film is the end-all of all evidence if an item is not as described , otherwise it 's the seller 's word against yours . 
  if the item 's broken , again , film it , and upload it to the dispute page . 
  yes . 
  sweden , denmark , and norway i know all have bottle/can deposits ( usually 1 crown/can ) . 
  the leaflet should be called `` v\u00e5ra objudna bes\u00f6kare '' , or `` our uninvited guests '' . 
  i found [ this ] ( http://hjak.se/2013/05/07/vaksamhet-samhallsanda/ ) page , that happens to have the leaflet scanned in . 
  if you want this to be translated , post this to / r/translator or pm me - we might give it a go . 
  what shipping method ?
