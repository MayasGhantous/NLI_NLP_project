  morning !, 
  i just had a minor messup : i am not located in china right now ( and hopefully wo n't be there at all , ever again ) and had a tiny ( 15 kuai ) sum sent to my wechat wallet . 
  it is n't verified , and i do n't have a guo bank account so i ca n't pay for anything or withdraw it : only send to friends i guess . 
  can anyone help me get it out of there , as i do n't want mah coffee money to become worthless . . !, 
  i found this song that i am trying to translate ( i 'm probably deep in over my head ) that uses \u6fe1\u308c in a way that probably does n't mean `` get wet '' , but something else :, 
  example :, 
  ( i translated this as :, 
  for the sake of love , the wetness is starting ,, 
  the heart is soaring upwards ), 
  ( i translated this as :, 
  for the sake of love : soaring ,, 
  the heart is starting to get wet ), 
  * how would you fix this ? 
  also , in the same song , i found that \u594f\u3067 is used in some kind of way that i presume does n't mean playing an instrument :, 
  ( i wrote : for the sake of love ; continue celebrating by playing . ), 
  * how would you fix this phrase ? 
  song : [ skywings - in bloom ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecabjqi_ehk ), 
  any help appreciated !, 
  i am trying to translate this song :, 
  [ skywings - in bloom ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecabjqi_ehk ) .

  i have tried , but nothing really seems right . 
  how would you translate them ? 
  thank you for any help !, 
  hi there ,, 
  i am looking for a japanese transcription of this song : https://youtu.be/vmr_wybvn5o . 
  any help would be gratefully appreciated . 
  please note that the short introduction does not need to be transcribed , only the song lyrics . 
  i ca n't really grasp the meaning of this verse . 
  ( or at least , i ca n't get everything to fit in ) . 
  thank you !, 
  ok , i believe that this guy is mentally ill ( in the song , of course ) . 
  text :, 
  i do n't understand what \u30e1\u30c3\u30ad means in this context : has it got to do with a personality `` shell '' ? 
  text :, 
  and, 
  i do n't really understand the whole '' \u6c42\u3081\u308b\u307b\u3069 '' thing . 
  so afaik , elfen lied has n't been released in english , right ? 
  what is the best scanlation ? 
  are there even any options , apart from shitty korean raw chapter 1 and comic sans jpg galore ? 
  i do n't know where to put this , so sorry if it 's placed wrong !, 
  in [ this song ] ( https://soundcloud.com/talib_official/d-s-p-a-i ) , there is this basmala ( 0:00 to 1:06 ) that is very good but i ca n't find the source of it . 
  it would also be nice to find the source of the songs that follow ( for an example 1:06 to 2:00 ), 
  so i 've got some ( coffee money-ish ) webmoney balance in an account online . 
  i would like to convert it to paypal or something , as i have nowhere to spend it . 
  is it possible to send it to friends and family or something ?

  hello ,, 
  my name is multihacker , aka bygghandel on baka-tsuki . 
  i 'm thinking of reviving shakugan no shana translations , but i need ( a ) translator ( s ) as i am first and foremost an editor , and can thus not translate ( so well ) . 
  i can probably mtl , at worst . 
  is there any interest , or ( obviously , most needed ) translator that would find it ok to pick it up ? 
  seeing that it has n't been released or updated ( dropped by viz ? ), 
  for about five years . 
  these genre changes were often crappy . 
  i am looking for the name of the program , and perhaps an example video ? 
  i am looking for a translation of the song \u30b2\u30eb\u30cb\u30ab by \u9ed2\u876a\u8776 . 
  i am trying to translate this song , but am having trouble with the line '' \u3044\u3048\u59cb\u3081\u305f\u50b7\u75d5\u3055\u3048\u3082 \u3001 \u3072\u3068\u3064\u3072\u3068\u3064\u53c8\u304f\u308a\u304b\u3048\u3059 '' . 
  could anyone perhaps clarify this line , or even better , translate the whole track so i know what i 'm doing wrong ? 
  thanks a bunch !,

  i 've been having a craving for dark-themed novels for a while now . 
  i really liked elvenblood , and the girl who ate death ( and other works from the same author ) . 
  is there anything good out there ? 
  give me your best . 
  edit : i also like it if people die when they are killed . 
  incredibly happy for any help . 
  this is ( probably ) totally over my head , the poetic qualities being higher than other tracks released by the same band ( \u9ed2\u876a\u8776 ) . 
  i have marked lines that i am more-than-usual unsure of with an asterisk . 
  once again , thanks !,

  i think that i have transcribed this correctly :, 
  i have tried translating this as :, 
  russian tea , net weight 100g, 
  tea product, 
  price for tea 96 kopek, 
  price for caddy 15 kopek, 
  gost . 
  no 1938-46 ( standardization number ? ), 
  ( mark of ministry of food industries of the ussr ? ), 
  is this correct ? 
  can you find out anything about the manufacturer ? 
  just like the title says - if anyone has the i 'll kill you 1985 ep in flac , please send me a message . 
  i am also interested in various bootlegs in high quality .
