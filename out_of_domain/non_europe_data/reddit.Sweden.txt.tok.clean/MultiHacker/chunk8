  yup - i can get the thai pocky here ( original , strawberry , banana ) , and i can probably get the japanese pocky somewhere , but i do not have access to the chinese variety . 
  a'ight fam , can you ship to sweden ? 
  what would be the most affordable shipping method , and how much would that cost per 100g ? 
  it 's their `` customs fee '' , meaning absolutely nothing . 
  so , their fee . 
  i agree . 
  hajime has that particular brand of op , i feel . 
  ( note , i do n't want to sound like a pretentious bastard . ), 
  well , in chinese postal terms , '' \u5f00\u62c6 '' does n't literally mean that they 've opened your piece of post , but rather that they have received the piece of post at the local office after the customs inspection ( that your piece of post has passed , they have opened the bulk mail bag , if you may ) . 
  likewise , '' \u5c01\u53d1 '' does n't mean resealing in this case , but rather that it has been sent to the next stop ( they have , most probably , put your piece of post in another bulk bag ) . 
  sometimes , that status does n't mean that your piece of post has left china , you might see something like :, 
  \u5230\u8fbe \u5317\u4eac\u822a\u7ad9 has reached the beijing air terminal . 
  \u79bb\u5f00 \u5317\u4eac\u822a\u7ad9 \u4ea4\u822a has left the beijing air terminal . 
  \u5317\u4eac \u542f\u8fd0 has left beijing . 
  china post is a heap of inconsistent madness sometimes . 
  good luck !,

  the isk hp-2011s are also absolutely fine !, 
  similar to the pro 80s . 
  yes !, 
  i recommend skywings for the more power metal side , and \u9ed2\u876a\u8776 ( kuroageha ) for the more speed/thrash metal side . 
  ok , the input worked , but my card did not . 
  what a shame . 
  btw you ca n't put in your country code , your number will then be in the wrong format . 
  add a zero , then your area code , then your number . 
  yeah , exactly .

  the literal translation would be `` a world-renowned '' . 
  it maybe could imply that the hat is world famous ? 
  yeah . 
  obviously my translation was n't literal , even though i wrote so . 
  wow , my brain makes small , irritating mistakes at times . 
  `` worldwide hat '' would n't really fit , and `` global/international hat '' would n't really cut it either , i feel . 
  probably . 
  thank you for your help !, 
  one word ... jcafe24, 
  no problem , the parcel is en route from changsha to beijing . 
  wait another day or two . 
  i can send to you , if you want . 
  pm me , if interested . 
  basically , the guy just said that it conforms to the specs but they have n't tested it ; a so-called `` declaration of conformity '' . 
  some test their stuff , and get a `` certificate of conformity '' . 
  there is no real difference except for the testing . 
  they do n't necessarily need to test the product in order to determine that it conforms to the ce standards and give it a ce mark . 
  i recommend vk.com , like facebook but hosts audio as well . 
  haruki murakami - the wind-up bird chronicles, 
  got the name ? 
  i could maybe find some information about them .

  can it be something like this : https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=540255403437 ? 
  i would like some recommendations for japanese metal . 
  i have listened to , and like , galneryus , x japan , skywings , kuroageha and aldious among others . 
  a'ight gov , i have listened to versailles too . 
  thank you ; the list would be a large help !, 
  thanks !,

  i would do positive , but write that it took a long time to arrive . 
  as a fellow swede , i can tell you that the postal service here is a tiny bit shite . 
  sauce ? 
  meanwhile in / r/chineseoldpeopleweibo , \u5c0f\u5fc3\u54e6, 
  has it got anything to do with touhou ? 
  for some older stuff , you can look for see-saw , nami tamaki and t.m.revolution . 
  high and mighty color is good as well , and so is access . 
  check for flow and sunset swish . 
  i can do it . 
  i helped some other guy with it a month or so ago . 
  pm me . 
  if it 's a forward service , which i am inclined to think , it is fine for you to ship to it , as the buyer loses his buyer protection .
