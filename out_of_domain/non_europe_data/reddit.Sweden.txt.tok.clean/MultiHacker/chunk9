  yes , but the series is kind of shite imo . 
  i found that the best part was the opening . 
  install nova launcher ? 
  ahh , i get it . 
  i have no solution . 
  well , it 's a vending machine . 
  obviously , you need to hop around on your left leg , muttering prayers to satan while spilling goat 's blood and draw a pentagram on the ground while you stick that fresh dollar bill in the slot , or else it wo n't work . 
  i like brennenstuhl stuff . 
  10 year warranty , and not too expensive . 
  well , some chords you 'll need to memorise . 
  ( e.g. 
  a , am , e , em ) however , you can usually raise them by barring them . 
  ( e.g. 
  playing an am , then barring the first fret and playing an am again under the bar . 
  that would make an a #m . ), 
  exactly . 
  thanks for the japanese suggestions , i listened to all the suggested bands and i liked a lot of them ( especially boris ) . 
  much appreciated !, 
  i use a pair of gediao gd-1 's as iems , and a pair of isk hp-2011 's as full-sized cans . 
  both are obscure but good imo . 
  sauce ? 
  it has not been licensed , and can thus not be purchased in english . 
  oj fan . 
  japan ( along with taiwan , korea , china but not hong kong ) can send stuff untracked very cheap . 
  i 'm talking $ 10/kg here . 
  well , it is the thing you must do . 
  i got a knife ( actually multiple ) , but this knife was the only one worth the ( relatively high ) price . 
  the blade is thick and it looks totally wack . 
  i recommend it .

  the same . 
  ok , pen island and not penis land . 
  i got kind of confused there . 
  penis\u00f6 ( n ) , which would be ( the ) pen island . 
  usually not , thankfully !, 
  you think i have friends ? 
  what country subreddit am i at ? 
  needs more jpg . 
  have you baidued the names ? 
  otherwise rutracker is a large help . 
  \u307e\u305f\u305f\u3073 ( matatabi ) , which i presume is silver vine , aka . 
  cat powder aka . 
  it seems to be a plant . 
  wow , i sure would like some of that . 
  check vk.com , a russian social media site with audio uploads . 
  otherwise just proxy youtube . 
  i 'm happy to be in a non-blocking country . 
  check jcafe24, 
  yeah , when d.n.angel and berserk still were typesat like that . 
  i do n't miss it , it looks like shit . 
  has anyone seen a better scanlation of chapter 1 of elfen lied , that has n't got korean raws btw ? 
  just a rendering error . 
  you 'll probably receive your parcel . 
  i 'm a mtl-assist bastard , what are your views on mtl assisted translations ? 
  it might be a vendor rom , it might be good to reflash the phone . 
  roses are red ,, 
  sidewalks are gray ,, 
  but it looks ok . 
  thanks for the answer !, 
  yeah , i found that , but i also would like to find out what nuances it has . 
  ( because it seems more dirty , does n't it ! ), 
  just what i needed !, 
  thanks !, 
  they use 4px that hands it over to singpost facilities . 
  4px goes from shenzhen , china to hong kong to singapore to your destination country . 
  tl ; dr they use a company to forward your stuff to singapore from china . 
  this company prints the shipping labels as well . 
  you 're looking for / r/translator . 
  it looks like the arabic script . 
  i can do swedish , if that ever is needed . 
  change the browser font ? 
  cobalt has put up the mtled google docs stuff on his blog and it is pretty good , for being a mtl . 
  he is translating again , but it 's so sloooow . 
  go check / r/mahouka . 
  if you can stand the chinese , of course . 
  aha , the summaries ? 
  that later stuff that is n't even completely mtled ? 
  my bad , that sucks . 
  oh shit , fucking shit , shitaroonies . 
  i feel your pain . 
  pm me , i might be able to help you about identifying them . 
  faster than china post , slower than courier . 
  i like the standard shipping . 
  exactly . 
  actually , it 's china - hong kong - singapore - japan . 
  it quite reminds me of dunc 's algomusic . 
  you 're in the right . 
  the seller might offer to send you paypal , do not accept that . 
  ask them to refund via aliexpress or resend the item , and you can close ( and re-open ) the dispute , as long as you have processing time remaining . 
  hi there !, 
  i am translating as we speak , but i really ca n't make out some words . 
  any other photo or scan ( from another angle ) would be helpful . 
  i will edit with translation . 
  p\u00e5 ? ),
