would you like the change in trillions or billions ? 
  london mm , got it from here http://www.dafont.com/london-between.font . 
  since it 's a free font i 'm not sure i could get the creator to change it for me . 
  is there no way i could do it myself though , by somehow editing the . ttf file ? 
  even more impressive [ from the ouside ] ( http://imgur.com/f7e4mau ) . 
  that cat has seen some shit . 
  would n't this explanation imply that it is only possible to divide by positive integers ? 
  after all , if we have 10 blocks it 's pretty difficult to divide them into -3.5 groups . 
  a lot of people seem to dislike the original image , so i went ahead and [ touched it up a bit . 
  wow so reagan wow, 
  such presidency, 
  wow, 
  keep in mind that this was still very early into the war , before any major confrontations between britain and germany . 
  i doubt downed german pilots were treated with this amount of respect during the bombing of london . 
  it 's still rather misleading to call it evolution in real time . 
  and suffer a -50 hit to swedish - [ german-brazilian ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/queen_silvia_of_sweden#childhood_and_parentage ) relations !? 
  also , thank you !,

  the picture is actually photoshopped , the original featured a lone russian war veteran with a sad look on his face because none of his old army friends had come to the reunion . 
  edit :, 
  [ here it is !, 
  from [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/1su7u4/what_photo_leaves_you_speechless/ce1dgqy ) post . 
  are you sure about that though ? 
  nothing in the post that i linked , nor the one / u/one _ dalmatian found seems to imply that is the case . 
  well it 's easier than you think , just press that up-pointing arrow over there to the left . 
  considering the term cold fusion seems to mainly be associated with pseudoscience i am rather sceptical of it being widely used by physicists today . 
  ( note : i do n't know much about this at all so this might be incorrect , however this is what my biology teacher taught me . ), 
  essentially , whenever there is a difference in koncentration between two solutions they will always try to equalize the difference . 
  the water in our body , namely the one in our cells , has a certain concentration of ions and other ... stuff . 
  the pure water on the other hand has none of this , and as such the water in the cell has a higher concentration of ions than the pure water outside of the cell . 
  because solutions will try to do away with any difference in concentration , the pure water will then move through the cell memebrane into the cell through a process called osmosis . 
  this happens all the time and is necessary for cells to survive . 
  the problem with extremely pure water is that way too much of it enters the cell , causing it to burst . 
  this kills the cell .

  during a single hour of night-time while visiting scotland we saw deer near the road on 19 separate occasions .

  do you understand what hdr is and how it is achieved ? 
  higher rarity =  lower supply =  higher value . 
  thus rarity increases value by itself , as well as increasing demand . 
  no no no , this is balancing at it 's finest :, 
  people whine about tec-9 being too weak .

  wierd , pretty sure i brought the width down to 1000px before exporting ... should i reupload it or do you think it 's ok as it is ? 
  reupload with smaller size because people have too small telephones .

  reminds me of a short lived carbonated drink we had here in sweden . 
  it was flavoured mango and orange , and the front of the bottle exclaimed `` 25 % fruit juice ! '' . 
  now , i suppose this was technically correct , but the list of ingredients revealed that out of those 25 % fruit juice , 98 % of it was apple ( not mentioned anywhere else on the bottle ) . 
  did i mention that it 's 100 % ? 
  god damn you 're full of yourself . 
  how is it `` taking advantage of the unexperienced listeners '' to provide them with something they enjoy listening and dancing to ? 
  have you been sarcastic this whole time ? 
  or do you honestly consider tricking natives out of their land to be comparable to making unoriginal music ? 
  too bad the custom game community that used to exist practically disappeared when the bots took over .
