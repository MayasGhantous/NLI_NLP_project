  you mean [ these ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8raylykjqrw&amp;t=1m20s ) soothing harmonies would n't enrich your dining experience ? 
  extratone really needs a bigger presence here at / r/edmproduction, 
  the video quite clearly shows how the technique is possible ( to some extent ) using a regular camera shooting in 60fps . 
  [ the version inside fl studio 12 just makes me feel bad about myself :( ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ehbtvul.png ), 
  but how can i reach the stars if i ca n't even go over 0db on the master ? 
  it can definitely be secondary in some cases , at least in the sense of composition that you can do with just a keyboard ( melodies , chords , basslines etc ) . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_esbwr3pb0 ) track by joe ford for example . 
  i think we can both agree that if we transcribed the midi and just used some random sylenth presets it would be a completely different song . 
  disclaimer : i looked into this about a month ago when i decided to do a working holiday in australia , but i might have gotten something wrong or things may have changed . 
  the change to taxation that forces everyone with a 417 to pay 32,5 % tax from the first dollar will notd be in effect until mid 2016 , so that should not be it . 
  you will , however , be taxed 32,5 % if you are not considered a resident for tax purposes . 
  people on a 417 may be tax-residents but also might not be , depending on circumstances . 
  i 'm not sure if there are any hard criteria but basically you need to stay in the same place most of the time and working should be a major part of your time in the country . 
  the thing is you can be considered a resident for tax purposes even if you are on a working holiday . 
  you do , however , need to stay in the same place for a significant time . 
  fixing your sleeping pattern is easier than going to a store and buying something ? ... 
  rip mr. 
  hands =(, 
  of course , just like homosexuality . 
  and sex outside marriage . 
  and masturbation . 
  god , i really wish we had more laws preventing people from harming themselves by doing disgusting and degrading things , the world would be a much better place !, 
  there is already a law against animal cruelty . 
  if it can be proven that the act was in fact not cruel , why should the human be punished ? 
  sorry , i think i misunderstood your original comment . 
  that is indeed a good point . 
  it is strange that there seems to be different ideas about what treatment is acceptable depending on if the animals are considered pets or livestock , and for what purpose it is done . 
  does look like hyperlapse from how the branches are sort of `` stuttering '', 
  i 'll admit i have not read any articles on the subject of animal consent , but at least from my own observations of animal behaviour what you 're saying does n't seem to be quite right . 
  i think most people who have been around male dogs have had them try to hump their legs at some point , and honestly , if a male dog is willing to have sex with a leg i do n't see why it could n't be willing to have sex with an actual person . 
  as for female dogs i guess it 's not as clear . 
  on one hand , a female dog that does not want to mate with a male dog usually makes this quite clear when the male attempts to initiate , so to say that an animal simply can not consent is obviously wrong . 
  on the other hand , there 's no saying this behavior would manifest itself in interactions with humans . 
  i 'd still argue that this should fall under general animal cruelty , and not be branded as a crime in itself . 
  i saw a few homeless `` encampents '' in tokyo and other major cities , mainly under overpasses and bridges . 
  the sad part is they seemed to be very entrenched with rather elaborate structures made from tents scrap building material . 
  that 's probably the reason you do n't see them around the popular areas . 
  as far as litter go i 'm surprised the central areas are as clean as they are , considering you need to go on an epic quest for a trash bin every time you need to throw away the tiniest piece of garbage . 
  outside of these areas though it 's a whole different story . 
  many smaller roads are completely lined with plastic bags , `` boss coffe '' cans and all other kinds of trash . 
  the same goes for the coastline where even the somewhat remote cape of southeast shikoku was heavily littered . 
  really sad to see . 
  if you 're going to write a wall of text you really should think about making it more readable . 
  edit : to the people that downvote me , would you honestly want every post on reddit to be formatted like the op ? 
  so why downvote when all i 'm doing is pointing out ( in a fairly non-hostile manner ) that ops writing could stand to improve . 
  i can write proper paragraphs in swedish , spanish , and english . 
  in fact , i 'm fairly certain most western languages use paragraphs . 
  i 'm getting downvoted but i 'll maintain that if you can put in the effort to write something as long as that , you can also put in the effort to figure out where you should break it up in to paragraphs . 
  it 's just common courtesy to the people you expect to read it , honestly . 
  i do n't understand why that would be hard to believe since studying three languages is the norm where i 'm from . 
  i never said anything about ops usage of english , but rather i suggested that he make an attempt to format it for readability . 
  the most obvious improvement would be to break the text up into paragraphs . 
  since he is german the concept of breaking up the text for readability should not be foreign to him . 
  i really ca n't see why this is controversial at all . 
  it might be difficult for someone who is mainly using google translate and ca n't really understand what they 're actually writing . 
  but in this case op speaks pretty good english , so it should n't be a problem . 
  op speaks as good english as most americans on this website . 
  the fact that he disregarded readability is most likely due to laziness as opposed to inability . 
  yes , if you do n't bother making any attempt at informing yourself on how to present a text in an easily read fashion . 
  which , by the way , you should do if you expect thousands of people to read it . 
  extremely individual depending on how much money you 're willing to spend and what you will be doing . 
  a portable light source is always good to have but most phones nowadays can do the trick pretty well . 
  yes , but that situation is n't very likely unless he 'll be camping or going into abandoned buildings or caves or whatever . 
  that 's sort of the point of noise gates . 
  started drawing this well over a year ago when it was actually somewhat relevant , but abandoned it because i realized the comic would kinda suck . 
  finished it today because i 'm now ~ ~ unemployed ~ ~ a full time redditor and i need karma for food . 
  no , but external validation suppresses hunger !, 
  oh do n't worry i 'm just messing around , only temporarily unemployed while transitioning jobs !, 
  sorry , i assumed the ban on certain fonts was mainly pertaining to the main text of the comic . 
  in my honest opinion it does seem somewhat excessive to remove a comic for two words where the font is clearly used tongue-in-cheek . 
  sorry , i was just giving my opinion . 
  i understand you have a lot to do , and i appreciate the work of the moderators but there really is no need to be rude . 
  doubt it 's hdr , looks more like the clarity slider in lightroom . 
  i definitely agree it 's excessive though . 
  reuploaded because even polan knows not to use comic sans !, 
  i think people giving money to romanians is pretty common all over europe nowadays . 
  that 's the reason i wanted to use it in the `` ad '' . 
  but alas , even tongue-in-cheek usage is banned =(, 
  contrary to popular belief , their economic troubles actually started when google translate got the capability to translate from nigerian to greek . 
  =( ok i 'm just gon na put this comic in the trash for now, 
  plastsoldat can not into / r/polandball, 
  we 'll see , but i 'm not very happy with the comic as a whole . 
  it 's too long and unfocused , and the graphical style completely changes halfway through because i abandoned and picked it up several times . 
  yeah but i do n't really like the comic anyway , started drawing it nearly two years ago and did n't bother finishing it until now , so i 'm not exactly in a rush . 
   having two paths , one going each way , makes far more sense than a single bi-directional path when you are trying to move large numbers of people in a small area . 
  not necessarily , if you anticipate that the flow of people will generally only be going in one direction at any one time it might be better to let both gates be multi-directional . 
  the situation in the video might not be one of those cases , but at the same time this setup is pretty common , and i doubt it 's because no one simply knows better . 
  i do n't think / u/berryblackwater is saying that the story of cyclops literally came from someone finding an elephant skull and made it up . 
  it 's just , as he said , a parable . 
  it is unfortunate that despite your infinite knowledge in animal physiology you completely miss the point . 
  really good work , and an extremely useful pack !, 
  enjoy the gold . 
   anywhere in the east , there 's really nothing there to see anyway . 
  [ i 'd say that depends on what you 're looking for . 
  at sebunirebun, 
  i 'm assuming you 're also talking about central asia/pakistan ? 
  either way it 's not really possible to answer your question since you do n't specify any countries and we 're talking about an enormous area . 
  you could go to iran and be very safe hitchhiking or riding a bicycle , but obviously that wo n't apply to syria , for example . 
  i feel like this is the prologue to interstellar or something,
