i find this relevant : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iezmighezro, 
  a more realistic and secular view on love and `` fate '' . 
  maybe someone can correct me if i am wrong :, 
  people 's braincells are dedicated to think about their current worldview . 
  ( maybe not all , but most ) . 
  and the older they get , the more it thinks ( uses braincells ) about this worldview/way of living . 
  kind of like a muscle . 
  one thing to get them to change is to get them to think outside their box and use braincells for a different view . 
  but the brain is more complex than this , it is n't all biology . 
  it is a chaotic system . 
  by that i do n't mean there is n't any order at all , i 'm refereing to the chaos theory . 
  a system which is hard to predict and small changes may have big consequences ( the bufferfly effect ) . 
  for example : someone says to you that you 're stupid . 
  but you do n't think you 're stupid . 
  `` why would he say that ... ? '' . 
  and maybe later you happen to read something , lets say mathematical , that you do n't quite get , which makes you remember that guy who called you stupid . 
  `` was that guy right ... ? '', 
  and then you get biased and it gets easier to take in stuff that makes you think you 're stupid and there 's a snowball effect . 
  soon , you 're confidence in yourself has gotten quite low . 
  the `` im-stupid '' - cells replicated quickly . 
  it just began by one little thing . 
  `` you 're stupid !, 
  overpopulation ? 
  damn , that 's smart . 
  get sympathy votes for being retarded .
