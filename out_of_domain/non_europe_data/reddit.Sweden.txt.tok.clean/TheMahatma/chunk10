  no , sounds really boring .

  sometimes things can be too awesome . 
  shut down the concentration camps . 
  and to make things super wild , i 'd allow one more hairstyle . 
  meh , the constitution is just a piece of paper . 
  a freezer . 
  no , it would be nice . 
  but if most people suddenly decided money 's useless , it 's useless . 
  it does n't have any actual worth . 
  it 's one of the least real things we have . 
  i do n't know , but it 's a sound idea since it 's playing havoc with their memories of the event . 
  you have my permission , go ahead . 
  guns . 
  you can poke someone 's eye out with those things . 
  polygamous marriages . 
  probably not harems , but maybe marriages with three people .

  an internet forum with over 65 000 different subforums . 
  sometimes different people have different words for the same things . 
  it 's called language . 
  there are totally different languages where almost every word is different , and there are accents and dialects within a language where some words are pronounced in another way or all together different . 
  in your example it 's the latter . 
  i imagined an ` eli 3 ' in your title . 
  right , of course . 
  now it 's more obvious that 's what you were asking and i answered sarcastically and trying make you look stupid . 
  `` they said they went to iraq because evidence was suggesting they might have nucular weapons . '', 
  ftfm, 
  would 've been a nice world if failed wars prevented other , future , wars . 
  edit : the term ` failed war ' may be redundant in most cases . 
  the words nuclear weapons and concentration camps might be enough for many parts of the world . 
  what does nic cage have to do with this ? 
  dinosaurs would still be running around doing whatever the fuck they wan na do , while mammals are still scared little underground rodents . 
   i guess you 're one of the billions of people that live outside the u.s. and did n't watch the super bowl .

  we all thought so .

  `` did you put your name in the goblet , harry ? '',

  and from order of the phoenix :, 
  harry : `` we 've got one thing that voldemort does n't have . '', 
  orange : `` yeah ? '', 
  harry : `` something worth fighting for . '', 
  that 's such a stupid line . 
  that 's true , i did say that . 
  so that 's what 10 is doing in that alternate reality . 
  curious how rory got there .

  i 'm not disagreeing with that harry and the others have something worth fighting for , but that voldemort does n't . 
  he 's fighting for his ideology ( wizard supremacy ) and world ( or britain ) domination . 
  and it 's not gon na be for quite a while . 
  no new tv-shows , movies and you 'll know about most big events . 
  that one 's staying blue . 
  where is that a popular opinion ? 
  edit : maybe here : http://www.reddit.com/r/niggers ( which also is my comment to op of the thread ) . 
  no , ( s ) he asked for something science never will understand , not something that has been understood for quite a while . 
  nah , but someone 's gon na attack them just out of annoyance . 
  `` mayonnaise is like a penis . 
  it 's fine to have one and it 's fine to be proud of it , but please do n't whip it out in public and start waving it around ... and please do n't try to shove it down my child 's throat . '', 
  seen misfits ?
