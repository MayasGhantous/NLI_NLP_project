  humanity evolves on pangea . 
  according to [ guns , germs and steel ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/guns,_germs,_and_steel ) one big factor for why europe and asia developed technology faster was because how the continent looked . 
  it 's bigger , and more wide than long ( as opposed to the americas and africa ) . 
  it would be interesting how things would look if humans lived on that one big continent instead .

  [ create thing-based memes . 
  yeah , it 's supposed to be . 
  edit : the deleted comment above me wrote : `` terrible '' . 
  why ? 
  where did your mind go when you read the word * thing * ? 
  anyways , nothing nsfw about it . 
  it 's probably downvoted because it 's lame . 
  which was its intent . 
  god damn it , marie !, 
  it 's dwayne johnson !, 
  thanks !, 
  that was the idea . 
  guess people did n't get the joke . 
  the comments above me joked about the non-specific * thing * . 
  i kept going with the joke and created a stupid meme about it , or as you said :, 
   this is the dumbest fucking meme ever . 
  mission accomplished . 
  or your memory of him gets wiped out , but some time later that time traveller buys you a lottery ticket . 
  he 's just beating the crap out of british people in india . 
  there might be some inaccuracies in this movie .

  it 's hot in the summer and cold in the winter . 
  it 's round and wet and crowded .

  i think it 's the opposite . 
  we 've never seen any real aliens before , but i 'm pretty sure they would n't look anything like us . 
  i like sci-fi and stories about aliens , but that can be pretty annoying . 
  or wants to be the original . 
  maybe she does n't want any copies of herself running around . 
  but not in more of a disadvantage in a pyjamas . 
  he 'd still be superman , the guy who has beaten both of them several times . 
  well , vader could n't imagine he 'd be any powerful at all by being struck down . 
  no , obviously . 
  it 's * bats lock * . 
  but there 's also * bat lock * ( num lock ) . 
  like you said , he has a name for every key on the keyboard . 
  can be pretty confusing . 
   press bat + bat + bat . 
  that 's not really viral , is it ? 
  at least not yet . 
  no , that 's not it . 
  one of my favoirites is a musical episode from the sci-fi show lexx .

  great music and a great story about what happened when a people discovered immortality .

  it 's someone they talk about on reddit all the time . 
  if the media is ( contributing to ) making people scared , does that make them terrorists ? 
  yes , that 's it . 
  thanks !, 
  the mirror of erised . 
  no shit . 
  that 's some aggressive balls . 
  seems a bit redundant . 
  look at leno when he 's commenting on something funny a guest says : `` hehe , yeah , hehe '' . 
  or `` beetlejuice '' . 
  `` what fits with a gold coloured suit ? 
  i know , a skirt ! '', 
  good instructions , you would n't want wreck dat ass . 
  never go shop while hungry . 
  i think kahless ' work would be more correct . 
  i agree that it was a great episode , but it still did n't beat 4x11 in my opinion . 
  that might 've been the greatest community episode ( in my opinion ) . 
  i expected nothing less of you , reddit ( mizzoufan12 ) .

  `` from the way this young caucasian woman interacts an african-american male i deduce she 's recently been kidnapped , likely for a prolonged time . '', 
  i do not know who the red shirt is . 
  i 'm fine with this . 
  memes and here worship of an actual hero instead of some idiot on tv .
