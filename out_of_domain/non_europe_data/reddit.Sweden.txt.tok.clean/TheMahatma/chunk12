  maybe the one who fought during the time war ? 
  the doctor was never really proud of what he did there/then . 
  or maybe something bad he will do ( future doctor ) . 
  maybe 11 saw the future and what this one will do . 
  dci hunt has to be mentioned too . 
  dci hunt !, 
  i would probably watch red dwarf if it was n't for that laugh track . 
  before , after , that 's all relative when time travelling . 
  yeah , you 're probably right . 
  but would n't it be cool if he had known all along that he would do something so horrible in the future . 
  that 's even worse than living with having done something terrible . 
  hahaha , his dad died !!!, 
  yeah , that does n't work . 
  it 's not really because of a principle , it 's that i ca n't stand it . 
  yeah , but in a sci-fi show it feels really off . 
  dynamite - sweden . 
  well , it was invented by a swede , but in germany . 
  does n't matter ; invented dynamite . 
  a bit quirky , but she 's a politician that 's really dedicated and really cares about her job and community . 
  a clown , a wrestler , a penguin furry , an enviromentalist , a scarecrow , an ice skater . 
  terrifying . 
  i do n't know about worst , but most of them are unnecessary since they all tend to recover from death . 
  [ relevant whitest kids you know ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhcqa1ejic0 ) . 
  how do you know that ? 
  `` sorry , i 'm a bit late . '', 
  was n't * that * great of an x-men question . 
  one drunken night between supes and bats , just to add a little bit awkwardness in between their mutual respect and their hope vs fear debates . 
  and [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/i2vzl.jpg ) is hilarious . 
  i 'm afraid i do n't . 
  when a star trek character grows a beard , you know the show 's gon na get better . 
  chewbacca exists only in han solo 's delusional mind , and everybody 's just humoring han . 
  yes , he knew about han 's schizophrenia and felt sorry for him . 
  it was only laser tag , anyway . 
  no , his name was george . 
  he took lsd and a bunch of other drugs , he tripped like crazy . 
  and like you said , he babbled about a bunch of space stuff . 
  nobody believed him . 
  his name was georgs lucaks , [ hungarian philospher ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gy%c3%b6rgy_luk%c3%a1cs ) . 
  decades later , [ george lucas ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/george_lucas ) wrote star wars , which did n't have anything in common with what was in georg lucaks ' lsd dreams . 
  yep . 
  although she did n't have any training she could manifest some abilities sometimes . 
  which is basically the same . 
  no , that was an actual wookiee there , but not chewbacca . 
  his work was instrumental in destroying the death star . 
  the rebels did n't give him any award because they 're a bunch of shits . 
  they did n't even invite him to the ceremony , he had to sneak in . 
  what if i 'm not a fan ? 
  did solo spend some time in 1950s america ? 
  and then went more insane and changed the name from harvey to chewbacca , and from a giant bunny to a hairy man-ape . 
  slippery floor . 
  that entire scene is also in han solo 's head . 
  or them being amir 's new business idea . 
  fine , deeper , and more complex . 
  a mass psychosis is ravaging the galaxy . 
  thousands of people think they have swords made out of laser and can move things with their minds . 
  it 's just people playing along , and sometimes moving things with strings . 
  a great psychiatrist , anakins skywalker , managed to cure almost everyone from this psychosis . 
  he travelled around the galaxy to do this . 
  han solo and obi-wan two of the few sick people left . 
  obi-wan thinks anakin is the villain ( and convinces solo of this ) because he made all his friends go away , when they just got cured . 
  19 ... if you add 1 + 9 , you get 10 . 
  which is how many fingers and toes each of them have . 
  * farscape * and * community * .

  i sci-fi book about gandhi being resurrected in the future , fighting a british dystopia . 
  very violent . 
  robert de niro . 
  no , that would make it worse . 
  what needs to happen is that white people need to start using it . 
  not to call black people niggers , but calling each other niggers . 
  that would make the word lose its power , making it more lame . 
  interpretation to ` there is no god ' : god is not there , he is here . 
  here in our hearts . 
  he loves you , and you 'd better love him too .

  *** i 'm *** the clone ? 
  doing what i want , when i want , how i want . 
  forrest gump , near the end when he 's super rich . 
  was gon na say rain man , but that 's a bad idea . 
  i ca n't bother thinking of 6 more characters who are n't that bright and who are n't poor . 
  edit : but i would feel so bad taking money from forrest , even though he can afford it . 
  santa claus conquers the martians . 
  ~ ~ 1950s ~ ~ 1960s sci-fi movie . 
  awesome and quite bad . 
  needs to get worse , i 'm afraid, 
  and people need to get it through their thick skulls that it 's not unpatriotic to protest , or revolt , against the governments . 
  marylin manson is probably misunderstood by many people . 
  he seems like a pretty normal and smart guy in interviews . 
  starting a bank .
