  i think he 'll be number 8.5 . 
  not super-important , but there was a [ mini-episode prequel ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3jrs-uhuo ) to the day of the doctor . 
  he was a warrior , and all that , but he 's still the doctor , that person . 
  i do n't think everything about him disappeared when he became the war doctor . 
  but , who knows ? 
  maybe that myth also stems from a goa'uld ruling on earth a long time ago , or an asgard protecting it . 
  are we going to get a morning of the inspector special , perhaps ?

  ** idris ** : i 've been looking for a word . 
  a big , complicated word , but so sad . 
  i 've found it now . 
  ** the doctor ** : : what word ? 
  ** idris ** : alive . 
  ** the doctor ** : : alive is n't sad . 
  ** idris ** : it 's sad when it 's over .

  he seems to be more of a attention whore than actually crazy . 
  yeah , i wonder if that was intentional or if the writers were just clueless .
