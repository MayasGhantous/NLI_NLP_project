  look at him . 
  `` fuck you , scott . '', 
  judging by the photo , he 's with all of them . 
  ` ultimate aunt may ' just has a nice ring to it . 
  looking great , thanos !, 
  have you lost weight ? 
  a point the i like about hans turning out to be evil is the twist on the typical disney-love-at-first-sight thing . 
  both elsa and kristoff think that it 's really strange how anna is going to marry a guy she met just a few hours ago . 
  how well could she have known him ? 
  yeah , not so well . 
  superman might join their society for powerful characters with their own actual fortresses of solitude . 
  yeah , but so is elsa . 
  she 's just wearing clothes to cover it up . 
  basically . 
  no , he knows what a gun is . 
  he does n't know what death is .

  even if it 's staged , it 's still really creepy .

  [ this one 's a bit creepy . 
  [ post-mortem photography . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/post-mortem_photography ), 
  this is a picture from the victorian era of two parents with their dead daughter in the middle . 
  apparantly , in the ninteenth century , people taking photos of their deceased loved ones was a thing . 
  `` fucking ... teddy bears ... '', 
  i got full mandalorian gear with pink/purple dye for iresso . 
  that 's why i do n't get rich , i spend credits on shit like that . 
  i do n't remember right now what it 's called . 
  mandalorian something . 
  bought it from the gtn . 
  it 's been out a while . 
  i logged in to check , and to take a screenshot : [ mandalore the preserver 's set ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xwkuvqx.jpg ) . 
  the the mid panel on the third picture , is that superman and supergirl who has time travelled to have adventures of the legion , or just future people wearing superman stuff ? 
  wow , they really lied n the fourth one . 
  instead of getting that fun inflatable bouncer , they got a small baby prison . 
  is n't making gifs from 5 second films kind of cheating ? 
  who ? 
  you likely saw an ad for the tv-show [ welcome to sweden . ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3463606/ ) . 
  it 's written by amy poehler 's brother , and i think she 's in it the first episode . 
  looks like aubrey plaza 's also in it . 
  it was n't the raid leader . 
  i was in a pug for df and unassembled arkanian headgear drops . 
  this guy gets two of them : `` does anybody need head ? '', 
  that cracked me up a bit . 
  you 're not gon na call them gaymers , are you ? 
  have you noticed any negativity towards those groups in the gamer community/communities ? 
  i mean , from the people playing the games , not the makers . 
  was it something like that that got you to write this article ? 
  yeah , they 're quite broad . 
  perhaps it would be better if he divided the questions in to a few more , and with multiple choice answers . 
  that 's probably better for an online survey . 
  `` showing that christian fundamentalism is present in the usa . '', 
  uh , what ? 
  was that news ? 
  did n't know you could smoke polyjuice out of the sorting hat .

  something like [ orion 's arm ? 
  [ and wiki . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/orion%27s_arm ), 
   anyone can contribute articles , stories , artwork , or music to the website, 
  i guess it 's universe building . 
  it 's got lots of lore , history , races , science . 
  there 's a few rules to it , what science to do/not do for example . 
  it 's been around for a little while .

  lucifer . 
  went his own way instead of dealing with god 's crap . 
  inside jokes joked to death . 
  another downside with super speed is living in slow motion . 
  7 1/2 actually . 
  i do n't know what it 's called ; an anthology movie ? 
  a movie with a few short stories instead of one bigger one . 
  these would be some of the more famous reddit threads . 
  a teenage boy breaks both his arms , the unfortunate events of a dog called colby , the anti-climatic story of a guy finding a safe , retards group together to find a bomber . 
  i do n't know what it would be called . 
  `` not 4chan , the cleaner one '' maybe ... ? 
  another comment will probably come up with something better . 
  do n't we see him returning the gun , a bit too late for freeze ? 
  load to before you went insane , and redo it . 
  unlimited little indian men ... ? 
  at least im not alone . 
  ** the agnostic code **, 
  we can not know with certainty if god or christ exists . 
  they could . 
  then again there could be a giant reptilian bird in charge of everything . 
  can we be certain there is n't ? 
  no , so it 's pointless to talk about it . 
  / / [ south park ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r66r_xmodkk ), 
  [ wonderful , wonderful ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ih0_xfxnxwi ) , although x-files already did that . 
  fuck , that was a creepy episode . 
  \u00d8 is not a swedish letter . 
  you know nothing , / u/the _ empyrean . 
  it 's about an ex-superhero who now works as a p.i. 
  there 's a scene where she 's out having a coffee with someone , when they 're interrupted by a spider-man and doc ock fight and have to leave . 
  maybe because of your reasons , and there are a lot of x-men characters . 
  x-men could have its own universe , instead of sharing it with all the other marvel people . 
  we do it to ourselves .
