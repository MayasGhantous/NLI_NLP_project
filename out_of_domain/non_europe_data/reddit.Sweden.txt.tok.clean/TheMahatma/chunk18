  did that ever cause a hilarious misunderstanding ? 
  she got all excited that alfred was calling her , only to find out he was making the call for bruce . 
  yeah , i have it , too . 
  people mentioned in in / general on fleet , too . 
  i hope it 's a bug and not permanent . 
  quick travel got nerfed , as well : 30 minute cool down now . 
  it was too much for him . 
  i think his power was that he could adapt to and survive a lot , not everything . 
  he 's a mutant , not ~ ~ a god ~ ~ wolverine .

  cool . 
  i like the city , and you can go a bit outside the city to hunt wild animals or crazed sith . 
  looks nice , but i do n't think i could deal with the politics or becoming an insect slave .

  if you have any newborns , now is the time to send them off to another planet , where they might fight crime in colorful tights . 
  maybe on a ski vacation .

  sure , why not ? 
  looks like loads of fun .

  your job is to be an inspiration for people . 
  someone they can look up to , someone they can aspire to be like . 
  in steadfastness , in character , in ideals . 
  and what did marvel offer ? 
  they said ` do n't worry , you do n't have to aspire to anyone in our books , you just have to * relate * to them . ', 
  and now we have an entire culture that thinks that who they are is just fine , and how dare anyone suggest that they can improve themselves ? 
  why aspire to be superman when it 's so much easier to relate to spider-man ? 
  no one wants to looks up to you superman , they do n't want to strain their necks . 
  i guess he did the charlie work . 
  pretty sure that 's taken .

  yes , the crimes are different , and i do n't think the people disagrees with that . 
  the hypocrisy lies in our reaction to them both .

  or a funny-looking person on the subway . 
  another scumbag aspect of this is the reaction when it 's pointed out how shitty it is to leak these people 's photos : `` shut up , they love it '' .
