  `` he says ` shut up , wankers ' , and like almost everyone in the whole place just shuts the hell up '' . 
  good for them . 
  a thor-off ? 
  what was he at first ? 
  that 's one of my all time favorite episodes from any tv-show , and yes , the rest of the show was n't great . 
  well , it started off as not great , but the quality declined after the first or second season . 
  [ stargate infinity ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67e-_sqlvro ) , the stargate cartoon . 
  the rest of the show is apparantly just as bad . 
  seriously , why did they pick that ent intro song ? 
  it does n't fit star trek at all . 
  while one of the main characters is being [ knocked out ] ( http://www.supermanhomepage.com/tv/tv.php?topic=reviews/smallville-knockout ) , too, 
  5 : e november . 
  no bonus points for me , then . 
  i do know who he is , mostly from cameos he does in tv-shows and movies sometimes . 
  i do know he was a las vegas host or something . 
  and that 's all i know about him . 
  i 'm not american , so i ca n't have intimate knowledge about all of your celebrities . 
  he ran away when nyx busted through the door . 
  shh !, 
  graphite is the only color available , so that 's the one i `` chose '' . 
  oh , yes . 
  what a fun game . 
  i 'm probably gon na buy it . 
  too bad i do n't know anybody else that plays it , but it can still be fun . 
  mercy became my favorite . 
   i play 4 heroes mostly . 
  the rest are on `` know your enemy '' basis , rather than mastery . 
  meaning , i do play them , but not with the same dedication or interest . 
  yeah , i 'm trying to learn all heroes a bit . 
  was n't sure how much was needed . 
   she [ mercy ] essentially boils down to rez timings and being able to stay alive for them . 
  that 's it . 
  now how you do so , is another thing entirely . 
  i 've been kind of trying to just fly around and healing everyone . 
  but often mainly staying behind a tank . 
  working on the `` staying alive '' part . 
  yeah , that sounds good . 
   be proficient in 1 character in each category ( att , def , tank , sup ), 
  yeah , that 'll be less time consuming than knowing all characters . 
  thanks !, 
  5 's better than 23 , and does n't take as much time . 
  and , yeah , variety 's good . 
  i have noticed that you sometimes need to switch roles . 
  allright . 
  yeah , i do n't have much game time , yet . 
  i 've barely been playing a week . 
  so , it 'll come . 
  i only have one monitor . 
  it 's fixed . 
  it * was * on another monitor , even though i just have one . 
  had to drag the window to visibility . 
  it 's fixed . 
  it * was * on another monitor , even though i just have one . 
  had to drag the window to visibility . 
  that looks good . 
  thank you . 
  i just do n't understand why . 
  peer pressure ? 
  has anybody ever started because you liked the taste of it ? 
  the current until the 28th , i think . 
  has he done anything , except being a leader of a big cult ? 
  what did the previous pope achieve , and others before ? 
  i 'm not saying they should , nor that they shoul n't . 
  but why are n't they ? 
  they went to iraq because evidence was suggesting they might have nucular weapons . 
  north korea are bragging about their nuclear weapons and how they 're gon na bomb usa . 
  i had this vhs when i was a kid , say about 15 years ago . 
  it was three , maybe four different stories . 
  one is the story of [ bluebeard ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bluebeard ) . 
  the main colour used was blue . 
  i think another story was about [ the flying dutchman ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flying_dutchman ) . 
  i think the third story was [ the snow queen ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_snow_queen ) . 
  there may have been another story , not sure . 
  the movie was in swedish , but it 's very possible it 's not made in sweden , just dubbed . 
  i do n't think the style of the animation was very swedish, 
  ** spoiler for frozen ( of course ) and watchmen , comic book and movie . 
  anybody else that 's noticed similarities between elsa and doctor manhattan from * watchmen * ? 
  both of pretty powerful characters , feeling isolated and detached , * frozen * . 
  maybe manhattan a little more so than elsa . 
  they run away from everyone and everything . 
  elsa to the north mountain , and doctor manhattan a tad farther , to mars . 
  there they then build their own crystal palaces . 
  anna comes to this palace to convince elsa to come back save arendelle . 
  in manhattan 's crystal place , silk spectre tries to convinve him to come back to save the earth , from a disaster that has n't happen yet . 
  both say no , but later come back , though for different reasons . 
  there was also a similiar plot twist about a good guy turning out to be a bad guy the whole time . 
  hans and ozymandias . 
  unfortunately i ca n't find a * frozen * equivalent of rorschach . 
  i 've got a 55 powertech tank , and would like to augment him , but i 'm not sure how . 
  it was a bit easier to augment my sage and operative , who just needed one kind of augment . 
  the tank , however , got three . 
  shield , defense and absorb . 
  i 've been reading some numbers , that i need about 40-50 % shield , about 40 % absorb and a little less defense . 
  the numbers arent the same on every site . 
  my question :, 
  how do i know how many augments of each to get before i 've gotten all the top gear , when it 's constantly upgraded ? 
  are they really long for everyone ? 
  or does it have something to do with class , rating or server ? 
  i 'm a healer who has done a few rwzs on red eclipse . 
  during prime time , 6-8 pm gmt +1 ( think thats prime time ) it takes about 1 hour to get in to a ranked warzone for me .
