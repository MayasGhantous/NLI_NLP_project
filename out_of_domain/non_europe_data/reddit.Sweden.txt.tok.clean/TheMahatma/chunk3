  there 's a pretty big country just south of canada that 's getting some power . 
  stuff like this happens once in a while , and it 's terrible . 
  i do n't quite understand either why , out of everyone , she gets the attention , but i do n't mind it . 
  let 's get some shit like this in the open and talk about it . 
  to do or say nothing , just ignore him/her . 
  or fuck a family member or two . 
  a reasonable assplanation .

  lexx , episode called brigadoom . 
  i do n't think the show was that great , with the exception of this awesome musial episode . 
  not just great songs , but a good story too , about a people who discovers immortality and what happens to them . 
  team-up ? 
  man on the moon . 
  it introduced me to andy kaufman and his great and weird sense of humour . 
  jim carrey is pretty good in it , too . 
  that sucks . 
  one should spend reddit cake days out celebrating with friends and/or family . 
  wake him up with something weird . 
  put on some halloween mask , if you have , light a candle and hold it and ride him while you chant `` praise zeus '' . 
  or something along those lines . 
  edit : or do n't . 
  yeah , do n't , blow him instead . 
  i hope not . 
  it 's nice to be able to learn other languages , and every language has some limitations . 
  old people and their old ways would n't die , and overpopulation would be a bigger problem way quicker .

  there is already a great trilogy post rotj : the thrawn trilogy . 
  movie version of thrawn trilogy would be nice . 
  sigh ... yeah ... 
  i have no idea , but as we 've all seen , star wars movies can be pretty damn good and pretty damn bad . 
  let 's hope for the former . 
  maybe the awesomness of star wars trilogies skips a generation . 
  i do n't think it will happen , but if it did , i would die too . 
  jeffrey combs ? 
  yeah . 
  new characters in the sw universe is what we need . 
  not like tpm , aotc , rots which had the same characters as the old trilogy . 
  we did get to see more jedi stuff from the wonder twins . 
  maybe star wars : the next generation ? 
  not that name of course , but a few decades later , new characters and stuff . 
  why not just give whedon all the money in the world to make the new star wars ?
