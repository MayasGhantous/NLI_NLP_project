  [ biggest tearjerker ever . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px0j1ehf8y0 ), 
  browsed ? 
  do n't you mean click and then immediately close and never go back ? 
  do n't communicate too much . 
  if your so loves you , they 'll be able to read your mind . 
  if they 're not , you have the right to retaliate , preferable with passive aggression . 
  yep . 
  yeah , that tl ; dr was better . 
  yes . 
  it 's sex with someone of the same gender , so that is gay . 
  can someone explain what catfishing is ? 
  taking advantage of people in any particular way ? 
  just messing with them , or trying to scam money or something ? 
  no , it was fringe . 
  doctor who would maybe be : time , space , running . 
  too bad . 
  there 's a bunch of old people in charge . 
  any damage done to me would instead be dealt to the one hitting me . 
  just tie me up somewhere . 
  the currently second highest rated pic ( from : all time ) is with a guy . 
  maybe it 's not limited to physical damage . 
  they 'll end up bullying themselves ( somehow ) . 
  edit : when they are about to say something mean to me , they 'll just end up saying something equally mean to themselves . 
  well , yeah .

  [ night skies ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0460883/ ) . 
  based on some ufo sightings in 1997 and testimonies by some crazy guy . 
  i feel so bad for posting that one ... 
  there 's nothing to suggest there is such a thing , just old fairy tales . 
  good point . 
  ~ ~ but in the phantom menace qui-gon explains that it 's actually quite scientific . ~ ~, 
  people . 
  well , ** most ** criminal . 
  so torture and rape first . 
  and if it 's a minority , make it ( look like ) a hate crime . 
  i guess these would be more like spin-offs , but buffy and stargate sg-1 . 
  arrested development , obviously . 
  x-files , totes awesome . 
  fringe , too .

  [ a bit relevant . 
  star wars jedi knight ii : jedi outcast . 
  did you see the [ observer ] ( http://www.fringefiles.com/gallery/albums/episodes/414/fringe414theendofallthings0001434.jpg ) in that episode ? 
  the future . 
  i already know what 's happened in the past , i want to know what 's gon na happen . 
  but yeah , if i go too far , i might not know what the fuck 's happening . 
  but it might also be difficult to deal with the lack of technology in the past . 
  knocking someone unconscious without any lasting consequenses . 
  i think smallville overused this . 
  every character has been knocked unconscious , so many times , to have an excuse to why they 're not seeing clark using his powers . 
  archer actually acknowledges that it 's bad . 
  archer : `` you did n't get knocked unconscious , did you ? 
  that 's superbad for you '' . 
  and then later mentions doing some neurological scans or something . 
  they would all hate maxxters . 
  `` why did n't you tell me before , colby ?! '',

  [ lexx . 
  ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0178149/?ref_=sr_1 ) i watched in and did n't think it was that good . 
  except for its excellent muscial episode [ brigadoom . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=_4o8z-ujsh0#t=397s ) great songs and a great story giving more information about an important race in the show . 
  an advanced race gains immortality , which is its downfall . 
  i think all dinosaurs when extinct then . 
  cool picture . 
  i like this trend , or meme , with often fictional or historical people riding some creature .

  yes . 
  * a whole new world * with darth vader . 
  yes please . 
  nice . 
  i got one just like it , too . 
  `` i have returned from germany with peace in our time . '', 
  british prime minister neville chamberlain in 1938 . 
  yeah , did n't quite work out like that . 
  what if my biggest wish is to have everyone believed i had my biggest wish fullfilled ? 
  that made a bit more sense before i typed it . 
  if you 're going with the stargate universe ( the universe , not just sg : u the series ) why not choose the ori ? 
  much more powerful , almost godlike . 
  but not the ascended ancients , because they would just not do anything . 
  or the star trek universe , q. 
  for the same reason . 
  or the universe according the christian beliefs . 
  i 'd ally myself with a vengeful and omnipotent being . 
  and i 'd prefer to ally myself to a single monotheistic god to several polytheistic . 
  the christian god would probably fight ( or smite ) and wage war , while greek gods , for example , would fight amongst themselves , have sex with goats and shit . 
  read this somewhere on reddit before :, 
  your girlfriend and mother have switched bodies . 
  to switch back , you need to have sex with one of them ; who would you rather do ? 
  excellent anti-theft app . 
  you can track it , take photos and videos that gets sent to e-mail and a bunch of other stuff , from your computer if it would get stolen .
