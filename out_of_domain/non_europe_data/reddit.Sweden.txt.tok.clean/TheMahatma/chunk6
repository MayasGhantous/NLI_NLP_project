  anything inflicted on you , is inflicted on the person inflicting it instead . 
  someone hits you , they hurt . 
  it 's not limited to physical damage either . 
  if someone tries to hurt you emotionally , they get emotionally hurt instead . 
  catch : it 's not just damage . 
  every hug , kiss , compliment and fuck , the other person will feel that instead , you wo n't . 
  [ hellenismos ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/religion_in_ancient_greece ), 
  * full house * and * it 's always sunny in philadelphia * . 
  those people are gon na fuck things up for that sweet little family . 
  maybe one of these :, 
  - the unknown . 
  they have no idea what 's gon na come after . 
  - nothingness . 
  the idea that there would be nothing , complete lack of anything might be scary . 
  - the afterlife . 
  what they think comes next , like hell . 
  that does n't sound nice . 
  spider-shark . 
  please specify . 
  no religion in politics here , that 's neat . 
  the prime directive . 
  sweden . 
  500 years in to the future . 
  i just want to see what happens . 
  i would travel further , but if i travel too far , maybe i wo n't know what the fuck i 'm seeing . 
  reed richards , most likely to find a cure . 
  what do you think i am ? 
  crazy ? 
  you 'd turn it off when i was half way across !, 
  a collaboration , maybe . 
  like the [ legion of doom ] ( http://comicartcommunity.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/legion-of-doom.jpg ) . 
  han looks like he 's kind of into mal . 
  and invisible woman and wonder woman looks just like elastigirl , but with different outfits and poison ivy is [ merida ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1217209/ ) with tits . 
  kinda liked iron man . 
  he looks like a kid with a goatee . 
  fits some parts of his personality . 
  [ like this . 
  ] ( http://the-trukstop.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/darkclaw.jpg ), 
  is it a parody ? 
  indeed he does , sometimes . 
  `` when you pray , do n't be like the hypocrites who love to pray publicly on street corners and in the synagogues where everyone can see them . 
  i tell you the truth , that is all the reward they will ever get . 
  but when you pray , go away by yourself , shut the door behind you , and pray to your father in private . 
  then your father , who sees everything , will reward you . 
  chocolate milk or orange juice . 
  but im not sure how i feel about drinking my own juices . 
  not to just to see that , but to experience the people at the time . 
  they 're watching it , just in awe . 
  and probably the optimism ( and maybe naivet\u00e9 ) they 're having ( maybe taking a little break from the ww3 fear ) about the future , and space exploration . 
  even better : '' * i finally read our book , what the fuck was that ? 
  i 'm out * . '', 
  or he creates an alternate reality where his parents were killed . 
  or the universe implodes . 
  or something else we ca n't conceive yet . 
  [ the actual ending . 
  the dogfather . 
  a better conclusion to stargate atlantis would 've been nice . 
  what kind of life exists out there in the the universe . 
  might be alot of info , might not , but it 'll probably be interesting . 
  [ something like this ] ( http://lmgtfy.com/?q=most+expensive+material ) . 
  or post a video on youtube where you destroy it . 
  `` i do n't have to do any stupid valentine shit , yay ! '', 
  i was disappointed by reading about the story on imdb . 
  does n't sound as cool as the book . 
  `` i have seen your fate . 
  it is not a happy one . '', 
  might freak people out . 
  strawberry jam and some ( ice ) cream . 
  i do n't know , i 'm just fine with it . 
  i was disappointed by the last three seasons . 
  yes , of course . 
  [ nope ] ( http://1.media.todaysbigthing.cvcdn.com/60/34/ee9073fc50c7b0f472ded37f92b23807.gif ), 
  / thread , i suppose . 
  and to friends and acquaintances . 
  there are people from several sci-fi series there . 
  babylon 5 , smallville , being human ( us ) , fringe . 
  [ i do n't know if carl sagan would agree with you . 
  all of them . 
  just want talk about my music , guys '' . 
  on the one hand , it would be very cool to get actuall proof that there is a god . 
  getting proved wrong can be exciting . 
  on the other hand , we 'd find out there 's an omnipotent dictator in charge of the universe . 
  scary . 
  `` i think we 're gon na find out next season . '', 
  * i 'd tell you what was hunting you , but you 've probably never seen it . 
  so , a teddy bear necrophiliac ? 
  `` we 're taking over now , bitches . '', 
  and that 's the way it is, 
  simpsons did their take on that . 
  well , simpsons did it * , too * . 
  just this one time they were n't first with it . 
  i do hope it will be like this , or something like this . 
  i do n't want any more prequels , i want a continuation of the star wars saga . 
  i like [ mitchell and webb 's ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxpmhuce9ls ) definition : two people who are a little bit deluded in each others favor . 
  [ saturday morning watchmen ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yddhhrt6l4w ) . 
  just a perfect parody . 
  maybe not that underrated ( but not overrated ) since many call him a genius , but there are many who does n't know / remember him .
