  she 's not a mind-reader , just an emotion-reader . 
  she 's not gon na know your specific thoughts , just emotions .

  i 'd like to see what the dinosaurs looked like , and to just watch those giant beasts roam the earth . 
  is n't that just another good reason for them not to exist ? 
  lex luthor, 
  reed richards, 
  hank mccoy, 
  bruce banner, 
  yeah , a couple of villains too , but this team could be pretty badass . 
  you do n't even need to photoshop . 
  just an image of joffrey will do to express the hatred . 
  i do n't quite get it , what 's the deal with jennifer lawrence ? 
  there 's always someone claiming it to be fake .

  your job is to be an inspiration for people . 
  someone they can look up to , someone they can aspire to be like . 
  in steadfastness , in character , in ideals . 
  and what did marvel offer ? 
  they said ` do n't worry , you do n't have to aspire to anyone in our books , you just have to relate to them . ', 
  and now we have an entire culture that thinks that who they are is just fine , and how can anyone suggest that they can improve themselves ? 
  why aspire to be superman when it 's so much easier to relate to spider-man ? 
  no one wants to looks up to you superman , they do n't want to strain their necks . 
  reddit just seems to be obsessed with all young female actresses , with kristen stewart as an exception . 
  batman has spent his entire life to be in top physical and mental shape . 
  he 's mastered several martial arts , and with his fortune he can buy him some damn awesome gadgets that he keeps in his utility belt . 
  james bond is pretty good with a gun . 
  breaking in would be so much easier , even more so if you can just choose to teleport any object from anywhere . 
  and border control would be made more difficult . 
  shit . 
  that means that if teleportation would be made possible , some fuckers would be there to prevent it to be available . 
  ( the oil part , not the middle east part ( well ... ) ) .

  discipline and punish ( subtitle : the birth of the prison ) . 
  some of the reasons it 's really good . 
  - the history surrounding the birth of the prison system . 
  the reasons we went from mainly torture , to sending criminals to prison instead . 
  - the different thought processes of people in the past . 
  kind of archeological , lots of very old paper articles and stuff . 
  - what some of the consequenses of the prison was on society . 
  how some of its principles , like surveillance and discipline , spread to the rest of society .
