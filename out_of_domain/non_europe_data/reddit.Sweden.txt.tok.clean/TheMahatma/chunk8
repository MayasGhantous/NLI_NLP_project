  you mean healthy food ? 
  fuck , no . 
  that 'd doom us all . 
  overpopulation would be a bigger problem , a lot faster . 
  and old people would never die to be replaced by new generations . 
  we 'd stagnate . 
  but if it 's just for you , then sure .

  bad askreddit question : using the same actors as in the original , what porn movie would you want to be seen made into a normal version ? 
  hmm , yes , that sounds reasonable . 
  i think it 's funny how it escalates . 
  more riddiculus outfits , and more lame excuses to wear them . 
  i wish i had a good joke for the word ` changdeansia ' . 
   when its rights and you need it though, 
  is n't that just addiction , and the relaxation you feel is just feeding the addiction , getting rid of the abstinence ? 
  b-ball like these are idiots . 
  batman did something similiar to this to gl in new 52 justice league no .

  the most powerful weapon in the universe , with quite a flaw . 
  worse than the first death star . 
  `` i 'm sensing the romulan is scheming . '', 
  `` i 'm sensing the ferengi wants something . '', 
  basically . 
  just what is it about his beard ? 
  it 's indeed stunning . 
  just know the few words i 've picked up from the shows . 
  because everything in klingon should have an exclamation point after it , even if it 's just the name of a common dish . 
  `` wait a minute . 
  you said you ca n't sense ferengis !, 
  have you been faking this whole time ? 
  you are n't really an empath !, 
  so , that 's why i saw you reading that book about ` cold reading ' . '', 
  maybe he should have a back-up ring on him that people does n't see . 
  no , on his toe . 
  old trilogy : a group of people are dissatisfied with the current political climate and sets out to change it . 
  10 hours of some people doing a walkabout . 
  movie 1-2 : we 're gon na melt this ring . 
  movie 3 : we 've melted the ring . 
  hehe , yeah , they 're just the same movie , really, 
  airplane !, 
  - a routine flight turns into a major emergency as passengers and crew succumb to food poisoning - is there anyone on board who knows how to fly a plane ? 
  that 's just the plot from zero hour , the movie airplane !, 
  does a parody on . 
  would that be dc 's fifth crisis ? 
  i 'll expand on that :, 
  - episode 1-2 : the sith are assholes . 
  - episode 3 : obi-wan 's an asshole . 
  - episode 4-5 : my son 's an asshole . 
  - episode 6 : the emperor 's an asshole . 
  incest in space . 
  at ** my ** comment ? 
  nimbal 's the one who connected juno with aliens , i did n't really add anything new . 
  well , being able to post semi-funny comments on internet forums is a prerequisite to be a [ mahatma ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mah%c4%81tm%c4%81 ) . 
  i think the latter , or from the jk2 demo . 
  yeah , that 's retarded design . 
  i guess some of the brain chemistry , some of our now unnecessary instincts that no longer do us any favors . 
  for example :, 
  in/out - group thinking . 
  scared by the unknown . 
  telekinesis and flying . 
  yeah , that 's not even changing perspective . 
  that is why the movie actually is quite boring . 
  well , one of the reasons . 
  in the role of the xenomorph ; michael cera . 
  it summarizes how fury feels in this series . 
  aging , but still a crazy , gun-loving badass . 
  well , he 's not . 
  they 're all from vader 's perspective . 
  crawling reptiles terrorize people on a commercial aircraft . 
  but i ca n't figure out a good title for it . 
  it ends with homer just putting the crayon back in his brain . 
  edit : wait , the opposite thing happens in that simpsons episode , homer proves god * does n't * exist . 
  damnit , this post became invalid . 
  or ` man gets hit by football ' . 
  or any revolution . 
  sneeze . 
  and there 'll be a great scene where a bunch of them go out and destroy a printer . 
  you deserve your negative amount of comment karma . 
  hehe , it 's just a sneeze , 
  * freezes *, 
  * shakes *, 
  * feels tired *, 
  * go cleans sweaty bedclothes *, 
  * looses weight *, 
  * third day of not eating *, 
  * coughs blood *, 
  stuff and things . 
  nigh-immortality . 
  the largest of the cats . 
  this would be my choice too , providing it wo n't eat me . 
   ... are the beginning of borg-ification, 
  `` we are borg . 
  you will be borg-ifisized . '', 
  resistance is futile .
