so there 's no name for these diagrams , other than venn ? 
  that seems like it 's it . 
  thanks !, 
  so , is '' - sk '' a form of '' - sky/skaya / '' that dropped the `` y/aya '' over time , like `` ton '' from `` town '' , or has it always been '' - sk '' ? 
  ah , okay , thanks !, 
  really ? 
  so his passport says ( something like ) : `` king of sweden , carl '' ? 
  kinda rad though , never knew they 'd have their titles . 
  interesting . 
  i actually think the speech scene was * not * hitler-like enough . 
  it just felt like they took a nazi rally , edited the pictures , made all the audience be stormtroopers , and replace the speech with `` rebels mus die '' . 
  and that * definitely-not-nazi-salute * that the stormtroopers did , it just felt too forced . 
  it would have been scarier if the first order had been more human , because that would make them more scary and dangerous . 
  and the man delivering the speech could have shown more enthusiasm , he just felt like a robot reading a script . 
  it sounds weird , i know , but more humanity would have made them scarier . 
  i was scared that kylo would just be vader with another mask , but he really had a different personality , which made me happily surprised . 
  exactly . 
  comparing that to one of hitler 's speeches , in which there 's so much more than just `` now we can finally kill the bad guys ! '' . 
  also having civilians listening to the speech would strengthen that hitler feeling , although maybe civilians in support of the first order might be difficult to find . 
  but it said `` prussian subarctic islands '' before , so islands must count . 
  i edited them ( with notepad + + ) . 
  i 'm running 1.14.3.0 . 
  i assume 1.14.4 is the latest version ? 
  i have n't received an update , how can this be done ? 
  oh , okay , thanks . 
  i realised now that i have n't included either of the new areas in a region , and changing this changed it . 
  edit : i forgot to add my new areas to a region , and so now they are part of the scandinavian region ( a bit weird for greenland , but whatever ) , and it works !,

  my great great grandfather ( i think ) was one of the [ first prisoners in auschwitz ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/first_mass_transport_to_auschwitz_concentration_camp ) . 
  his brother died at the siege of warsaw , and the third brother escaped and fought with the royal air force . 
  definitely , but i suck at the game . 
  also is there an extended timeline mod for vic2 ? 
  yeah , nations are declaring wars left and right , kinda funny . 
  he indeed is . 
  i did try eve , i 'm just scared it 'll take too much dedication/time , more than i can spare . 
  if i were to join a corporation , how would i do it ? 
  do i contact a person , or is it just send request , and then i 'm in ? 
  like do you have to ... you know ... * speak * to people ? 
  all right , is there a simple way to browse corps ? 
  all right , i 'll that out . 
  thanks for all this , i think i 'll give eve a second chance !, 
  i will , thank you . 
  yeah , i saw the `` lincoln killed '' article , which is what made me think about it . 
  is n't it strange that there is n't a leader ? 
  you 'd think that there 'd at least be a name in `` politics '' or something , but no . 
  kinda strange , is n't it ? 
  do you know if there 's a reason as to why ? 
  all right , thanks for the answer !, 
  i think i 'll load an earlier save and go about the war without the help of the usa . 
  i can manage without them anyway . 
  that bothered me too , it 's as if the sole survivor just had a nap between shaun disappearing and the rest of the story , for no real reason . 
  those are some good examples , thank you . 
  significant deaths , i did n't actually watch all of it . 
  some death scenes . 
  edit : well not `` some death scenes '' , they were significant . 
  already seen , but still . 
  someone might not have seen season 5 , for example . 
  i have n't one , i 'll edit this comment when i find it . 
  i do n't think it was the teaser , however it might have included some scenes form it , i did n't watch all of it . 
  what i know is that there were season 1-5 spoilers ( significant ) and it was just ... you know ... `` out there '' . 
  i think it was more an ad for the show as a whole , or for hbo nordic , since i did n't see any new footage , but i did n't also see all of it . 
  most likely because kiev is a tributary of hungary . 
  no problem . 
  it does get confusing at times , i once had `` breizh '' written all over france and thought it was a weird bug until i realised the french king was a tributary . 
  so , if he inherits the hre , can i elect him ? 
  all right , thanks !, 
  i 'll see if i can make it work . 
  update : i gave him the county of suffolk , but i still ca n't elect him . 
  you think it 's broken , or is the system just weird ? 
  huh , weird . 
  but the hre swithed to elective all the sudden , so even if i elect my now 60-something kaiser , his children wo n't be elected . 
  but thanks !, 
  as you can see i 'm sort of pissed off , it was a rebellion i thought i had well under control but apparently not . 
  they did occupy most of norway , because my army was overseas , but even when all that territory was mine , they gained points to enforcing demands really fast , just as fast as before . 
  that is true , however my final complaint is that when the rebels become an actual norway , what forces my king/govenment to recognise it ? 
  why am i not automatically at war with this `` norway '' ? 
  my units , that were besieging their final holding , become black flagged . 
  it 's just so weird . 
  take eastern ukraine currently , for example . 
  it 's not like ukraine is not at war with donetsk just because there 's gone enough time . 
  well , whatever , i suppose i 'll just invade norway again , it 's not like it 's a difficult thing to manage . 
  if not realism , then balance . 
  it makes no sense , game-wise or realism-wise for the spawning army to be 4x the size of my armies ' total . 
  well , alot of what you said makes sense . 
  this is pretty far into the game though , 1600s , i 'm protestant and they 're catholic , i have more development etc. 
  but still , i see now , it does make more sense . 
  thank you . 
  i understand that there are rebels , i was expecting them , it 's just that there are so many when they spawn . 
  and it was n't all in one war . 
  same with swedish/danish/norwegian . 
  just accent it all up and hope for the best . 
  what ?
