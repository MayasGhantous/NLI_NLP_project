  come again ? 
  as a swede , i can confirm . 
  they 're both easy to understand when they 're spelled , it 's just the pronounciation in danish that 's just too much . 
  true , it 's a regional thing . 
  i think most swedes are more used to norwegian though , i know i am . 
  that 's what i thought too , although it seems unlikely that they would n't try to implement such a successful feature . 
  it would probably be more player home-oriented , like castles/mansions , rather than settlements . 
  [ i think he meant this . 
  for the `` other '' part , they are :, 
  russian ** federation **, 
  swiss ** confederation **, 
  ** principality ** of andorra , monaco , liechtenstein, 
  ** grand duchy ** of luxembourg, 
  ** state of ** israel, 
  note that this map does n't take into account the colonies of sweden , which , [ while small ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e5/swedish_empire.png ) , still existed . 
  well anything that is a pain for norway is good in sweden, 
  some other pretty school buildings in stockholm :, 
  [ norra real ] ( http://www.gymnasieguiden.se/files/attachment/file/2305/141671858.bpfqb2ir.jpg ) ( same design as that of s\u00f6dra latin ), 
  [ kungholmens gymnasium ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/kungsholmens_gymnasium.jpg ), 
  i usually use uesp , it 's just when i want to check things out fast i use the es wikia . 
  although that 's changing now i guess . 
  i feel like it 's kinda recent , how long has it been like this ? 
  okay , thanks . 
  i genuinely do n't get this . 
  i guess i 'm way too tired . 
  what are they saying ? 
  same . 
  it was when i looted their dead bodies that i found my items . 
  in swedish , it 's `` tjeckien '' , which would basically be `` czechia '' or something like that in english . 
  it just feels so strange that another , more `` regional '' name for the nation has n't developed over time , but i guess the name `` the czech republic '' is rather new ? 
  i know it used to be the k. of bohemia , when did they change ? 
  seems like it , although they look a bit worried , so it might be for the worse . 
  i 'm thinking a siege of riverrun , since you also see podrick and what seems to be jaime in lannister war camps . 
  weird , i see now that my post says sweden but the sidebar and comments say norway, 
  severe water damages, 
  i was looking for a nation where the king is n't the head of state , and only rules a region of the land . 
  but thanks . 
  yeah , the hre was my first thought . 
  but was n't it pretty autonomous , barely a single nation ? 
  i was thinking of something very nation-like , with a constitution and all . 
  that 's very interesting , i 'm gon na read into that !, 
  thanks . 
  i 'll read about that as well . 
  thanks a lot !, 
  whoops , sorry , totally missed that . 
  thanks !, 
  so , it 's like `` new town , the lubawan one '' ? 
  okay , thanks a lot !, 
  yeah that 's what i figured . 
  i mean yeah basically, 
  definitely , it was a great scene . 
  when you say `` many use first names '' , do you mean that they say `` bishop fredrik '' or just `` fredrik '' ? 
  ok , thanks . 
  i like it , the yellow stripe through the middle is a nice design/touch . 
  yes , i saw it , but i believe that the pumps are part of the main building , so removing them would remove the house . 
  perhaps it 's been updated , i 'll check . 
  so , it 's small things like this , but no `` major '' things , like different responses entirely ? 
  oh , thanks !, 
  so , in a city of 40,000 inhabitants , there 'd be around a hundred taverns , and around 20 inns ? 
  this is actually a great resource . 
  so , nothing easy , like just draggin some files around ? 
  thanks for the answer . 
  all right , thanks !, 
  thanks , i was a bit confused . 
  thanks . 
  amazing scene , although very sad :(, 
  is the bible divided into multiple ` book of x 's ? 
  how do i know when i am in the book of matthew ? 
  and thanks !, 
  all right , thanks !, 
  one last question , about the two testaments . 
  are they of equal length ? 
  like , does the new start in the middle ? 
  but , food and supplies , just for themselves ? 
  they have to be making a profit , i ca n't imagine that costs too much . 
  does this mean that there 's a treasure hiding around in the house of black and white ? 
  okay , thanks for the answers !, 
  red : old west norse, 
  orange : old east norse, 
  purple : old gutnish, 
  yellow : old english, 
  blue : crimean gothic, 
  the green area is not a singe language , since this map is oriented towards the scandinavian languages . 
  translated from the [ swedish wiki ] ( https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/fornnordiska ) :, 
  other germanic languages that at this time were closer to the scandinavian languages than they are today ( old frisian , old saxon , old dutch , high german ), 
  it was spoken by the [ crimean goths ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crimean_goths ) ( who could have guessed it ) , who were a the least influential of the [ goths ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/goths ) . 
  interestingly , though , they lasted the longest of all of the goths . 
  i 'm not really an expert , you should read about them more yourself , but i can say that they 're very interesting ( all goths in general ) . 
  you can see the switch from '' \u00f6fver '' to the more modern '' \u00f6ver '' ( over in english ) between the 7th and 8th books ( brown/grey ) . 
  it is definitely overstated . 
  keep in mind that this is supposed to represent where the germanic languages were spoken , and so some areas are exaggerated in order to make it more `` obvious '' that they are spoken there . 
  i have commented the legend , although i understand that it might be difficult to look at both the comment and the map at the same time . 
  this banner was used by the soldiers on board ships of the swedish navy . 
  also check out [ this flag ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/59/two-tailed_swedish_ensign.jpg ) , which was also used by the swedish east india company . 
  [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_sweden ), 
  all right , now i understand , thanks !, 
  as in , existing . 
  i 'd assume , yes . 
  rurik , for example , founded holmgard ( around modern st. petersburg ) in 862 . 
  nevermind , i just realised what it was : the holder of cilicia was also the holder of a bulgarian duchy , and so it was included .
