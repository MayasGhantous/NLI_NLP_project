  use your favours on other characters to make them join the faction . 
  when you are powerful enough , demand installation of claimant . 
  even if the liege denies , you will hopefully have enough troops to beat him . 
  i understand the feeling of being overwhelmed , we 've all been there . 
  that seems really obvious now , thank you !, 
  it was kinda bothering me , i thought it was just two different ways of saying and the wizards at wikipedia just could n't agree . 
  i had some , but i deactivated them . 
  still , with only ck2 + active , it crashes on `` loading game '' . 
  in swedish ( or at least where i live ) it 's pronounced like `` call '' . 
  i would say that arryn is ravenclaw , sort of neutral/not very ` personal ' , but more rational and straightforward in a way . 
  although it 's been a while since i read or watched any hp book/movie . 
  it does kinda sound like they 're saying that, 
  are there any major features unique to the asoiaf universe that can now be included in the mod , thanks to the dlc ? 
  i ca n't really think of any . 
  i have done the holland - netherlands run as well . 
  however , bohemia does sound kinda fun , i might try that !, 
  yes , but is it a subreddit that just sends information from other subreddits to it , or is it another type of page ? 
  so * technically * it 's a subreddit ? 
  all right , thanks . 
  good , thanks !, 
  now that 's a good question, 
  oh , i was completely convinced it was about them liking me ( i think i read it somewhere some time ago ) . 
  i had n't even considered the possibility of them not liking him . 
  do you have any tips on making them vote for him anyway ? 
  is it * only * about them not liking him ? 
  yeah i had seniority before , but my dynasty is so huge that i always got someone i had no idea who they were on the throne , and all alliances were lost . 
  i 've never had purple revolts before , they 've always been a darker version of my title 's colour ... am i going colourblind ? 
  is that it ? 
  i 've never played as wales so i would n't know, 
  nope , they 're just two separate revolts . 
  but i think it 's because wales ' colour is too dark , like / u/el _ spasoje said . 
  i would love to be able to change names . 
  we know that the pope can do it , why not be able to get our own regnal name ? 
  like how the prince of wales might change his name to george when he becomes the king of the uk . 
  my main reason for this was for culture . 
  if your name is johann , and you become the king of england , you should be able to rename yourself to john . 
  another way to solve this would just be to automatically ` translate ' names to the traditional culture of your primary title , but it would be confusing to have a register of translations . 
  i think rhyan tyrion will become the king, 
  you could use console commands , by typing neg_diplo and sending the offer , then playing as the lc and accepting . 
  yeah , i guess that 's the major reason . 
  but maybe there could be some sort of special alliance thing added ? 
  i do n't know if that 's even possible though, 
  oh , right , thanks !, 
  why is hillary clinton addressed as ` secretary ' ? 
  she 's no longer secretary of state , so should n't you say ` senator ' ? 
  oh ok , so you 'd still address bill clinton as `` mr president '' ? 
  that 'd make the couple `` mrs and mr president '' if hillary wins . 
  all right , so its not that unique . 
  but thanks for the answer !, 
  [ arumba ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gkqkqcini0 ) . 
  very `` thoughtful '' commentary , the opposite of obnoxious . 
  oh thanks i 'll crosspost, 
  at first i thought so , but no . 
  nope . 
  but thanks for the help, 
  visby would make a good white harbor if they got some [ good snow ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/4f/9c/b8/4f9cb8e83c25309764e73857ca32d17d.jpg ) . 
  ok , so there 's no quick way to just clean it up ? 
  no command to delete all of my stuff at once ? 
  ooooh , i 've never heard that expression before !, 
  now i get it , thanks !, 
  yes , but is the way i said it grammatically correct ? 
  i 've used it all my life and just now started to doubt it . 
  have you played daggerfall ? 
  or sumerset, 
  oh ok . a bit sucky that i would n't see a 10000 + post but sure . 
  edit : that was easy, 
  i 'm talking about diagrams like [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/uwjopiz.jpg ) ( from [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o37yjbfrrfg ) video ) . 
  take the city of tomsk , for example . 
  what does the '' - sk '' mean ? 
  is it just a shorter/different version of the `` ski/sky '' that appears in other slavic names ( at least in polish ) , or does it have another meaning ? 
  thanks . 
  take [ carl xvi of sweden ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carl_xvi_gustaf_of_sweden ) . 
  it says in the article his name is * carl gustaf folke hubertus * , but is this his entire name ? 
  or is he carl gustaf folke hubertus * bernadotte * ? 
  ( the dynasty he belongs to ) . 
  he started counting , but fell asleep . 
  [ removed ], 
  like eso or eve . 
  i want a game where the battles are large , but also strategically important ( not just plain fighting , but fighting for resources , strategic interests , etc ) . 
  any ideas ? 
  are there nation leaders , like presidents or kings ? 
  i ca n't see it anywhere , but it 'd be so weird if it was n't in the game . 
  if it exists , where do i see it ? 
  i 'll start off by saying i 'm new to victoria ii . 
  so , i recently started a japan game . 
  everything was going great , i was allied with the usa and had expanded pretty steadily in indonesia . 
  i decided to invade korea . 
  korea was allied with the chinese empire . 
  i invaded , everything was going great , all of korea was practically occupied and i had n't lost a single battle . 
  and then , suddenly , the war is over . 
  the usa have some state in china now , but i do n't have korea . 
  why did this happen ? 
  did n't * i * declare war , with the intent of taking * korea * ? 
  how did it just end with the usa getting a piece of china ? 
  did the usa become war leader because they 're a great power ? 
  this is so confusing . 
  you know , with the shaun situation ... what excuses do y' all use to not chase after your son all the time ? 
  would it possible to set a certain culture for the colonists in a certain colonial area ( not region ) , choosing from of your nations ' accepted or semi-accepted cultures ? 
  playing as great britain , you could choose to send scottish immigrants to nova scotia for example . 
  they would still keep the state religion , so this would create protestant scots in america , which would make it easier to convert the reformed scots back in europe .
