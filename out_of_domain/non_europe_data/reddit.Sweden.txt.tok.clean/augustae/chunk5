  what do you guys think ? 
  dawnguard was around 6 months after the release of skyrim . 
  do you think it will be the same with fallout 4 ? 
  around june , that would be . 
  i just saw an ad for hbo nordic/game of thrones ( the hbo streaming service for the nordics ) which had some major got spoilers in it . 
  if you see it , i recommend skipping it as fast as possible . 
  edit : it spoiled every season so far , so that 's into season 5, 
  my nephew is the heir to the holy roman empire , and i am the duke of norfolk . 
  for some reason , when i click `` nominate '' in the inheritance law tab , he does n't appear . 
  my nephew is also in my court , and ( obviously ) of my dynasty . 
  it 's very frustrating , it 'd be an easy way to become kaiser , and i had planned it for a while . 
  help ? 
  i played as sweden , had norwegian rebels , i killed all their rebels and they had just one province controlled , but they still managed to declare independence . 
  how is this a thing ? 
  they should at least only be given the province they control , but * no * , they get all of norway , even though it was well under my control . 
  and how come you 're not at war with the nation that becomes independent ? 
  should n't there be some sort of `` war for independence '' or something ? 
  why 's there some rule that after a certain amount of days , the war is just ... over ? 
  '' * no , king of sweden , you see , we control this random province with our 0 troops , so you ca n't really refuse our independence * '' . 
  i 'm sure there 's some sort of logic to this , but i just do n't get it , it feels so stupid . 
  i played as sweden , annexed norway , and that triggered 40k + rebels in akershus . 
  seriously , if my nation has less manpower than that , how can there be 40 * fcking * thousand norwegians ready to fight all the sudden ? 
  it 's just so frustrating . 
  is there any logic behind this that i 'm not seeing ? 
  can you , as a korean , tell if a person is from north/south korea just by hearing their accent ? 
  when i visit the [ elderscrolls wiki ] ( http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/the_elder_scrolls_wiki ) i get pretty heavy lag , scrolling and clicking on links takes ages ( well , not ages , but too long for a website ) . 
  has anyone else experienced this ? 
  i 've been playing skyrim since it came out in 2011 , and it 's one of my favourite games . 
  but , since fallout 4 came out , i 've had a break , and it has made me realise how empty skyrim is to me . 
  now , do n't get me wrong , i love the game , but i 've really done it all . 
  every single quest . 
  i play on pc , so modding is an option , although my computer is n't the best . 
  what are some good , content-expanding mods ? 
  i 'm talking good , immersive , realistic stuff , not just a half-naked khajiit follower . 
  i ca n't seem to find out anywhere . 
  i do n't know if this happened to everyone , but for me , the items that they took from me was shared between the initiates/missionaries . 
  so , one of them had righteous authority , another had my mines , a third had my rocket launcher . 
  i just think it 's a cool detail , instead of just locking it all up in a box . 
  i mean , why do we say `` the czech republic '' , the formal name , instead of something simpler , like `` czechia '' or something like that ? 
  we do n't say `` the russian federation '' or `` the french republic '' . 
  it just makes no sense to me . 
  [ removed ], 
  i just love the `` diet of worms '' , even though i know worms is actually a city , it just feels so evil and fantasy-like . 
  * the diet of worms * . 
  like something you would find in the lord of the rings or the elder scrolls universe . 
  what are some cool/favourite event names of yours ? 
  [ removed ], 
  as in , a nation in which a certain region/number of regions is `` ruled '' by kings or other nobility , but the nation itself is a democracy/not ruled by nobility ? 
  edit : to clarify , i mean a nation where the king is n't the head of state and only rules an area of the nation, 
  that is , down in the right corner , by the ap . 
  i understand food and water and sleep and simple symbols , put what does the pill-looking symbol mean ? 
  and the medical bag . 
  am i sick ? 
  too much drugs ? 
  it 's kinda frustrating . 
  so , is there a text screen which tells what you have , in more detail ? 
  i know that * nowe miasto * means `` new city/town '' , since it was * neustadt * in german . 
  but what does `` lubawskie '' refer to ? 
  i know some polish , so i guess it 's an adjective because of the '' - skie '' , but i do n't know what `` lubaw '' means . 
  can anyone help ? 
  i thought for a split second that it was roose that stabbed ramsay , and i was like `` ooooooooh damn not so tough now are you '' and then i realised that it was the other way and i was kinda disappointed : /, 
  i know ( well , i 've heard ) that you address a catholic bishop as `` your excellency '' , but what would a bishop call another bishop ? 
  i mean i understand the reason they are there , but they are a pain in the ass when you 're building . 
  i mean i understand the reason they are there , but they are a pain in the ass when you 're building . 
  i reached level 15 a while ago , but never got around to playing the `` caravan distress signal '' radio station . 
  now , a few levels later , when i play it , it 's just silent ? 
  i 've been tuned in for a while and there 's just no sound , at all . 
  is there a fix to this ? 
  i did tune in once , but died , and since then it has n't played . 
  i mean norah/howard . 
  like , when you choose the `` sarcastic '' option in dialogue , is it exactly the same , with just different voices ? 
  or are there some small changes ? 
  i 'm asking since i 've never played as norah . 
  just as an example : copenhagen in the year 1500 . 
  approximately how many taverns would the city have ? 
  would it be 10 , 20 or 30 something ? 
  and to clarify , i 'm talking about cities , not smaller towns . 
  like , capital , or at least major cities . 
  i like the dynasty shield options that are available in the got mod , as well as the character beards/hair . 
  is it possible to manually export these to regular ckii ? 
  do they come from some other mod , that i can activate ? 
  thanks . 
  the sphere that it creates , reveals enemies . 
  but i do n't really get how it works . 
  is it that it reveals all enemies that are `` in '' the sphere , or is it that all of my teammates , including me , that are in the sphere , can see all enemies ? 
  basically , should i be aiming at my teammates , or at a wall where i think there are enemies ? 
  ... young hodor . 
  he nailed that last scene , i think he should also get some love !, 
  i think i can count the times i 've even held a bible on one hand . 
  so , does it just say ` new testament ' when that ` part ' begins ? 
  or does it just begin ? 
  do they do what they do for money ? 
  jaqen h'ghar says in the latest episode that the ` payment has been done ' or something like that . 
  does he refer to actual money ? 
  i 'm sure hiring an assassin of that kind must be expensive , so there must be a lot of money spent . 
  who gets that money ? 
  it 's not really like the faceless men have a lot of uses for it . 
  i just created the kingdom of bulgaria as the basileus , and now for some reason the duchy of cilicia is part of it . 
  why is this ? 
  i even destroyed the kingdom , and recreated it , and it still happened .
