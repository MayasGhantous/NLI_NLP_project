  it 's very frustrating as i 'm thinking of handing the kingdom as a viceroyalty to a vassal of mine , and i do n't want him controlling cilicia . 
  is there a fix for this ? 
  ... is not a member of the kingsguard , is he the legal lord of the westerlands , and head of house lannister , replacing cersei ? 
  my second son , who had no good traits ( as opposed to my firstborn , a genius with great stats ) had also been sort of neglected . 
  nevertheless , he became a midas touched , and i made him my steward . 
  i sent him to collect tithe . 
  after maybe two years , i got the event that he was killed by rabble . 
  oh well , he was n't going to inherit anything anyway . 
  but then , a few days later , i receive the extra tax collected by him , now dead . 
  my son , who had always been the second best , died doing his job , and finally making his father proud . 
  made me kinda sad ;(, 
  if he used to be a rich cobbler , ~ ~ presumably in king 's landing ~ ~ in some large city , and sort of famous among the nobility , how come no one recognises him ? 
  i guess the lannisters are n't exactly the ones to buy their own shoes and go to cobblers ' parties , but still , someone at the court has to know him , right ? 
  i pronounce `` your '' like `` yore '', 
  but i pronounce `` you 're '' like `` you '' but with an ` r ' sound at the end . 
  but i 've heard people pronounce it differently , and it just feels * so * wrong to me . 
  i saw [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/4o217k/democratic_national_committee_breached_by_russian/ ) reddit post , and while i 'm sure it says in the article , i 'm just asking in general . 
  we 've seen footage from the twins , with lannister and frey troops . 
  this could of course be just a meeting , but it could also be a red wedding 2.0 . 
  now , * if * it is a new rw , it would most likely not be orchestrated by the lannisters , even if maybe jaime would like to personally . 
  it would probably be a stark/tully plot . 
  this would mean that they probably also dislike jaime , and would n't mind his death . 
  imagine if walder frey is killed , and we 're all happy , but then we also see a stark/tully soldier killing jaime . 
  it would be so bittersweet . 
  finally , revenge for the starks . 
  but the cost would be jaime . 
  i know that this is n't exactly book-like , but the show has been straying quite far from the books , and they seem to like ` shockers ' in these later episodes . 
  ... the battle of the bastards . 
  like , yeah , sure , it 's great . 
  the starks win , they have winterfell and the north back . 
  but it would * so * predictable . 
  i mean , everyone on this sub is practically convinced that it will happen , it 's almost taken for granted . 
  it 's also happened before , with the tyrells at the blackwater . 
  i feel like it 's such a ` simple ' solution . 
  it wo n't really be the starks who won , they will just have been saved by someone else . 
  sort of like daenerys and her dragons . 
  what do you guys think ? 
  like , when someone shaves their head for charity . 
  how does this contribute ? 
  is it just like a dare , made by some rich person ? 
  i 'm from sweden and heard that you do n't have hbo nordic in iceland . 
  so my question is , how do you watch game of thrones/other hbo shows ? 
  like , with what service/on what site ? 
  from what i gather from the season 6 finale , most of the knights of the vale proclaim jon snow their king , the king in the north . 
  i have a few problems/questions about this . 
  first of all , why are they so quickly convinced ? 
  how do they go from `` let 's go home '' to `` the king in the north '' from just a few speeches ? 
  these speeches , made by lady mormont , lord glover and lord manderly , are very `` local '' to the north . 
  `` you refused the call '' . 
  would the average valeman noble even know what `` call '' ? 
  how much more can they know than `` we followed our commander into battle , to fight the evil boltons and help the starks '' ? 
  and the fact that lord cerwyn 's father was skinned alive . 
  how would this be relevant to the kotv ? 
  it feels like , from their perspective , these are just arbitrary stories told by northmen to northmen . 
  secondly , to my knowledge , the kotv are n't very anti-lannister , or pro-stark . 
  what reason do they have to proclaim jon snow their king , and start a rebellion against the iron throne ? 
  tl ; dr : it feels like a very poor political move by the kotv to revolt against the iron throne , when they do n't even really have anything to revolt for . 
  why enter a war that does n't really concern them ? 
  edit : just to clarify , i 'm not necessarily criticising , just asking for clarity , since it seems to me that i missed something . 
  other than stuff like the [ christina river ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christina_river ) and the [ old swedes ' church ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/holy_trinity_church_ ( old_swedes ) ) , what are some of the major marks that we can still see in present-day delaware/new jersey ? 
  he 's my heir , so it 'll bother me for a long while . 
  i started by accepting robb stark 's offer , and invaded casterly rock . 
  then , euron declared his war for the iron islands . 
  at this point , i was besieging casterly rock , with around 20k lannister troops on their way . 
  i decided that the odds in the west were stacked against me , and i returned to pyke . 
  i defeated euron 's 10k troops easily , and then chased down the retreating armies . 
  eventually , i saw a 5k lannister army besieging stonetree . 
  i got there , got caught up with the last of euron 's forces , killed euron and ending his war . 
  then , i fought the lannister army . 
  apparently , tywin was leading it , because i got him as a prisoner , and got to 100 % was score immediately , getting the west . 
  tl ; dr : euron invaded , i killed euron , i only had to fight 5k troops to get all of the westerlands . 
  it feels a bit weird to call the wildlings ` feudal ' . 
  is there a balance issue with making them tribal ? 
  i 'm currently playing as lord merryweather . 
  my de jure duchy is the rose road , currently held by willas tyrell . 
  i control three of the de jure counties , 75 % . 
  the other county is controlled by willas himself . 
  his opinion of me is 67 ( it used to be higher but there was a succession ) . 
  he still has n't given me the duchy . 
  is there a way to request it ? 
  or a trigger to make him give it to me ? 
  or will have to ( somehow ) usurp it ? 
  it 's a bit trivial , but i was doing some reading on the kings of england , and something caught by eye about the titles of some kings . 
  king stephen is referred to as, 
  '' [ stephen , king of england ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stephen,_king_of_england ) '' , while king henry is referred to as '' [ henry i of england ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/henry_i_of_england ) '' . 
  is there a difference between these two styles ? 
  they were both the first of their name . 
  i can run the game with the mod active , and i can choose and even customise a character , but whenever i try to play , the game crashes . 
  help ? 
  i love this game , but i feel like i 've played most of the common scenarios . 
  i 'd like to stay in europe , not because i do n't like the other continents but because i know more european history than the other continents combined . 
  so , what are some fun games , with some goals , like creating a nation or something ? 
  edit : some of the runs i have played :, 
  brandenburg - prussia - germany, 
  sweden, 
  france, 
  castile - spain, 
  italian nations - italy, 
  poland - commonwealth, 
  i mean it has the url of a subreddit , but it 's not , you know , content specific , nothing is posted specifically to / r/all .
