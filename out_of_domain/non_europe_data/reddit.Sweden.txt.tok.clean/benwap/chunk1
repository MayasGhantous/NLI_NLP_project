she was at a festival called [ fusion ] ( http://www.fusion-festival.de/ ) . 
  well , here 's some news ... 
  she 's back and seems interested in this trip goodie exchange !, 
  we did n't get very specific but i think it 'll come up soon again . 
  i did get to hear the story of how it was made . . 
  which i 've typed almost verbatim as she told it to me :, 
   in jujuy near bolivia , argentinia in the mountains close to the rainforest there was a volunteers bio/eco farm where she was doing work in the yard . 
  she suddenly noticed the ground was of clay so she picked up a piece near a waterfall . 
  she sat down on a mountain and clayed the figures , let it dry in the sun and she also made a pipe . 
  it came from the mountain , was found walking on it , made on it , and dried on it . 
  we 'll be in touch !, 
  i ** hump ** it . 
  funny , i was just thinking about how i just missed the last one and regretted it . 
  i 'll keep it clear until further !, 
  beautiful packaging . . not plastered with ugly warnings . 
  so the housemates and i were just sitting in the living room talking about another clayed object and our conversation came up . 
  * display of dutch directness below , please think nothing of it : *, 
  do you already have an object in mind from your trip goodie box to make this exchange ? 
  yeah , that 's whats going on . 
  d'aww i hope you found them !, 
  nice one !, 
  if i make it to the roof top pool party i 'll keep my eyes peeled for a ginger in all green , 
  i get where you 're coming from and believe historians agree pirates may have worn eyepatches for a similar reason . 
  for the record , you 're trying to keep a pupil from contracting , not dilating . 
  here 's a slpt for you : make more posts like these !, 
  please stop doing this ... 
  i 'll take `` things you ca n't unsee '' for $ 500 ... 
  mildly esthetically pleasing , but not more . 
  how in the living hell did i think of gnfos before i clicked that ? 
  do a good deed and do n't rehash old jokes in meme form . 
  housemate reporting in .

  pic delivered !, 
  we could always take a quick shot of the beer glass next to the little red trash bin for proof . 
  decibel after ? 
  fuck this meme , fuck this old joke , fuck the op , fuck memes on this / r /, 
  less is bore !, 
  man , if this is n't in nl that scale is chasing me ... 
  is n't that the title they started using in [ / r/wtf ] ( / r/wtf ) as it was being run down with uncreative crap ? 
  ] ( http://ellencsordas.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/animationgif_156664013.gif ), 
  fuck it with a nigger cock, 
  can he clean my suit ?

  i thought it was about a [ warning ] ( http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01499/luckystrike_1499808c.jpg ) - free pack . 
  being in eu might be related , ( filtered ) lucky strikes are in every shop/machine here . 
  are there any places you go to in amsterdam to meet fellow scandinavians ?

  should n't this be the iris in action ?

  thanks .

  holland drugsland !, 
  i 'm experienced with rolling tobacco . 
  a 50g pouch of rolling tobacco will dry out in about a week . 
  when you finish your pack you 're usually left with dry sand-like tobacco flakes . 
  if you have plenty left , it could be worth restoring it 's proper moisture level . 
  simply place it in an airtight container with a 4-inch potato peel for 24 hours , then put it back in it 's pouch . 
  evaporation resumes , you can slow it by using a small sealed container or keeping it in a humid environment . 
  [ / r/drawmohammed ] ( / r/drawmohammed ) !, 
  a pic of mohammed ?!, 
  i disagree . 
   there is no excuse for what he was doing . 
  none . 
  he is a sick , terrible human being and clearly has no morals . 
  did i argue the contrary ? 
  you 're entitled to your opinion on that . 
  i disagree categorically with taking a human life for animal abuse . 
  are human and animal lives valued equally ? 
  nope . 
  fuck this meme . 
  most sold electronic device in the world !, 
  that 's okay , you 're on the internet . 
  or ... vandalism of the public space and the vehicles getting wet paint splashed on them ? 
  * you had me at hitler . 
  nope : [ product page ] ( http://azarius.net/headshop/extraction_systems/piecemaker_pers/ ) . 
  an attempted suicide bombing was carried out in sweden with an explosive using this piece as its casing . 
  it [ can ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urmngoad2ys ) be ... 
   it 's the seagate logo . 
  haha no way !, 
  that is awesome . 
  would love to see it !, 
  there 's no problem tying analog signal cables parallel to power cables ? 
  [ like this ? 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54gja83jfi4&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=16s ), 
  in the very least it 's glock-pretty . 
  you could tighten an oil well pipe extension ( terminology ? ), 
  with that beast ... 
  we 're getting there . 
  speed paste ... 
  not so much . 
  [ yeah ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpbizyvftp8 ) , it rocks !, 
  not all cars starting in this rally are equipped with als , but it 's pretty obvious which ones are ... 
  i * think * this is in christiania . 
  you 're sure you do n't mean a * debit * card ? 
  a cc would really impress me . 
  also , in cremers in the hague they 'll give you a receipt if you pay with debit card , it 'll specify the strain , gram price , grams bought and total !, 
  even though i frequent coffeeshops as a local that was pretty awesome considering how shady it is in other countries to get your hands on some green . 
  ehm . . what makes you say that ? 
  for somebody in a completely different gun culture ( or lack thereof it seems ) , being 2 hours away from such an offer is a real dream .
