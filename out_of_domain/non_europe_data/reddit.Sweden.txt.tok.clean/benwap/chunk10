  the inscription in photo 2 reads carolus , probably after [ carolus rex ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carolus_rex ) . 
  if this is authentic you should contact a museum immediately . 
  if you 're scandinavian , carefully bring it up north before you do so . 
  e : turns out i derped, 
  it 's only a request . 
  enjoy your holiday !, 
  i can actually pronounce that . 
  do you maybe have a link to further info on this ? 
  i recommend standing in the emptiest parking garage you can and start recording . 
  either bring a friend or place the camera 10m from the system while you slowly max out the volume and then cut it . 
  the distortion and echo would illustrate the volume pretty well i guess . 
  wow . 
  that 's enough russia for one day . 
  interestingly enough this did make me think about russia 's homosexuality laws . 
  herds of nerds, 
  airplane [ tape ] ( http://www.auto.nitto.com/files/productdetails.aspx?pid=12&amp;catid=52 ) is a real thing . 
  i disagree . . op says it 's mostly wood . 
  his examples are mostly assembly related , which is these torque-adjustable cordless drills ' main application . 
  sure , if you 're building a deck you might need to drill holes in the cement foundations . 
  for that occasion i 'd recommend op 's dad rents a piece of equipment that costs more than op 's budget . 
  details on the fender bugged me , too . 
  at least snip the excessive length of the adjustable mounting rods and grind down the ends so they do n't look as sharp as they do now . 
  also , i 'd paint them black . 
  know your scandi 's, 
  is/was that pole part of electrical infrastructure ? 
  it could be an old mount for a distribution transformer with a bird repellant . 
  there are multiple images . 
  fint exempel av '' [ trying too hard ] ( https://encyclopediadramatica.se/trying_too_hard ) '' . 
  since you seem to take visibility seriously , i 'd recommend you add a pair of small round reflectors at the bottom of the back of your baskets . 
  it gives others a sense of the width of your bike in the dark . 
  what 's the relationship between a circle 's diameter and circumference ? 
  cheers . 
  my inspiration was [ this ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-4moo3llh98k/t2tun-amadi/aaaaaaaak3w/bjpslzpiitw/s200/sdc10120.jpg ) ( tiny image ) . 
  those barrels are cocked .

  wait , 3 out of 4 shoulder things go up ? 
  we 've got a * situation * here people !, 
  using layman terms , should n't the y 's loop go below the line you write on ? 
  it looks like a z or something now . 
  this question is coffee related and should n't be downvoted . 
  yeah it 's ridiculous . 
  snobs . 
  i do n't understand . 
  can your title be rephrased as, 
  * while painting , i fixed that cracked wall * or as * i fixed that cracked wall that looked like a painting * ? 
  now of course i 'm quite curious after that post . . naked dudes or not . 
  man i 've received a + treatment over here . 
  hats off to you guys !, 
  that 's actually a pretty neat story , man . 
  no reward without a risk . . 
  in the hospitality business ( group tours especially ) many cc details are transmitted by fax . 
  s-s . . source ? 
  screencaps have no sexuality, 
  hey now !, 
  i would n't want to get in the way of a fellow man 's nigger lynching . 
  i just dropped in from that thread and this is awesome !, 
  hope it takes off . 
  some guy had the source , but was told to leave . 
  would n't have shared anyway . 
  what is this ? 
  have those pairs been untwisted too far ? 
  i 've understood there is a specific length cat 5e/6 cable pairs are allowed to be untwisted before termination in a wall jack or being punched down . 
  i meant [ this ] ( http://www.siemon.com/us/white_papers/99-07-05-twistpairprep.asp ) . 
  [ wire nuts ] ( http://homerepair.about.com/od/electricalrepair/qt/wirenut_tie.htm ) are a good way of connecting wires , in certain applications . 
  the wiring harness of a motorcycle is n't one , i think . 
  nope . 
  why would we use hydraulics if this was true ? 
  and who can you thank for inspiring manning to perform his actions ? 
  a high-quality , well maintained cable system might outperform a cheap hydraulic set in stopping power . 
  however , hydraulics offer more stopping power for the same input . 
  my bad i was totally excluding temp fixes in my comment , which is what mcguyvering is all about . 
  good to have in the kit for sure . 
  would a wine bottle fit through the hole in pic 2 ? 
  * and now , for something completely different *, 
  there * does * seem to be a dent just before 7 o'clock , which might indicate debris . 
  regarding the concentration of paste at 11 o'clock , i think the excessive amount of paste played a role . 
  op could check for this by using the correct amount of paste and a small piece of glass . 
  i , too , am sickened by such weed shortages that people resort to this stuff . 
  my theory on it being downvoted is because some sub members want their sub to stay small , or not have a sudden influx of users . 
  some subs ( like / r/polandball ) have policy against linking to it in front page subs . 
  anyway , i like the bot too . 
  do n't be fooled . 
  funny story : i was in a bar last week and made a joke in front of my friends and a german at the table . 
  he was genuinely confused and asked `` are you trying to intimidate me ? '' . 
  ^ ^ ^ ps : ^ ^ ^ no ^ ^ ^ intimido, 
  it 's been a long spring . 
  we-ee-ee-ee-ve got ta winner !, 
  why do you juice out fan leaves ? 
  yes . 
  when separating thc mechanically ( as opposed to using milk fat and dissolving it ) from organic material the trick is to not leave any behind . 
  if you just rotate juices out , you 'll leave all the thc in the juicer with your waste material . 
  meh , depending on your trimmings/fan leaves potency might be low . 
  rich in fiber , though !, 
  * that * might heat a small city block , though . 
  what 's in the picture ? 
  damn thing looked like a small ups . . could n't figure out what it would power though . 
  * girls just wan na have fun , oh-ooh *, 
  there was a bit of drag in there anyway . 
  ignore [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwjcmfv8kik ), 
  * nice * ...
