  ### hipp hipp !, 
  ### hurra , hurra , hurra !, 
  it 's said there are n't dumb questions , but this one . . come on . 
  source ? 
  also , you 're being a smart-ass . 
  look at the face . 
  i do n't know what women look like where you 're from but men do n't have ros\u00e9 'd cheeks , pronounced eyelashes , eyeshadow , nor do they * look like women * . 
  hey , i was wondering if you 've had the time for further research . 
  did you get it working ? 
  * ... and of hexagonal character . 
  open the gif in a new tab and ctrl + f5 it . 
  enjoy man . 
  your mic is clipping on 's ' - tones , makes it sound like you have a lisp . 
  just a heads-up . 
  e : i had to turn it off . 
  e2 : i just gave game 2 a quick listen and it seems fixed there !, 
  there ai n't a more relevant sub for this , so why the downvotes ? 
  [ other ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/ba/bristol-hercules_east-fortune.jpg ) view , cutaway model . 
  cheers . 
  i continued watching game 2 and heard just minor lisping/clipping . 
  also as your orientation to the mic changes , the audio changes tone . 
  in other words , you can hear you 're moving about and the mic seems stationary . 
  just fyi . 
  you 've answered your own question . 
  the pistons use connecting rods to transfer their up and down motion into a rotating crankshaft . 
  e : on big marine diesels you 'll often find a second connecting rod between the crank and piston to minimize cylinder liner wear . 
   go fuck renee zellwegger in front of a speeding bus . 
  gladly . 
  just the kind of cunt i am . 
  i was entertained watching this . 
  you could even set how dark you wanted the toast ... * nostalgic sniff *, 
  this is very related to current events - switzerland just approved a purchase of gripens from sweden . 
  zippity bip-bop , ship-shash kabob, 
  dude !, 
  the cables !, 
  clearly that 's a rocket that just fell over . 
  ` nuff said . 
  perhaps a silly question , would pulling the clutch not help you come to a controlled stop ? 
  or would you choose to ride out the skid anyway ? 
  on the left i see one valve with a handle . 
  below that lies another ( bigger ) handle , perhaps connected to the same or a second valve . 
  i see two wrenches . 
  on the right sticks out the handle to a handheld screwdriver-like tool . 
  of course there could be anything on the end , e.g. 
  a leather punch . 
  there seems to be a syringe-like tool along the bottom too . 
  on it lies a small pulley with string . 
  all in all , i believe it 's a highly specialised repair/maintenance kit for a piece of industrial equipment or vehicle . 
  [ oh god ] ( http://i41.tinypic.com/152f3aw.gif ), 
  this is the best post i 've ever seen here . 
  this was very hard to read . 
  self-celebratory boasting of aggression and military superiority . 
  most disturbing is how every mention of a drone is prefaced with assurance it was in `` international airspace '' , as if these things do n't kill civilians extra-judicially year round . 
  either that , or how war is equated to an action movie with good guys and bad guys and happy endings . 
  for the record i 'm in a us-allied nation where iran = evil . 
  e : oh look , below that is a recruitment video for the marines , recommended for me !, 
  does that mean i can be just like tom cruise in the picture ? 
  join us in the `` downvotes-for-questioning-war-romanticism '' - camp below !, 
  kan man konfirmera en bekr\u00e4ftelse ? 
  i disagree . 
  this made me consider the etymology of the word for the first time . 
  i hope i 'm misreading this as you tumble drying your shirts . 
  ( broader sense ) prejudice , discrimination or hostility directed against any [ other ] ( http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/anti-semitism ) semitic people ( ancient or modern ) , such as samaritans , palestinians , arabs or assyrians ; anti-samaritanism , anti-palestinianism , anti-arabism , anti-assyrianism . 
  as a housemate , i 'd not even be mad . 
  could you point out the clutch in one of the pics , or is it tucked away ? 
  great project !, 
  i 'm envious as it would never work in my country with a crazy population density/vehicle strictness . 
  they 're so * huge * !, 
  e : nevermind , thought you linked [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/laserdisc ), 
  ** hot ** spare does n't mean you 're supposed to keep it at a certain tempera . . 
  nevermind . 
  impressive density of analog data . 
  ... just in time to see the kid with a smug smile wheelie his whole parents ' bike out of there, 
  that does n't mean he does n't get to catch shit for it for the rest of his life when it comes out . 
  this stuff is a slippery stuff . 
  there 's a ( moral ) code prohibiting this for a reason . 
  what is the reason to coil the wires i can see in the last few pics of your album ? 
  beautiful work !, 
  thanks !, 
  still does n't improve the handwriting . 
  ruining a perfectly good comic by putting the punchline in the title . 
  great job op !, 
  lol, 
  you might be interested in [ dynamic library ] ( http://www.winamp.com/plugin/dynamic-library/221705 ) . 
  i enjoyed exactly the functionality of the media library you described , but missed my folder tree as it plays a bit role in navigating my music library . 
  it will make an actual mysql database of all metadata and let you perform sophisticated queries . 
  let me know if you want a key . 
  just what i noticed . 
  i guess a such a runaway ramp looks like a deserted road to the inattentive who do n't read the sign . 
  easy to overlook - big consequences . 
  / r/gifswithsound, 
  could be a custom order for * any * cancelled construction project . . 
  if it 's aviation grade you 've struck gold but i think it 's unlikely . 
  you could use it to make cool interior furniture though . 
  this video was on motorcycle subs earlier . 
  the victim ( who was within his own lane ) was walking on crutches for months . 
  his ankle was shattered despite heavy-duty protective boots . 
  these accidents can be deceivingly damaging !, 
  why did you make this comment ?
