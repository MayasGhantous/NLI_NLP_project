  it 's totally irrelevant . 
  yeah i read that . . was wondering how / u/been _ worse would put it . 
  fantastic sense of depth , with the fish-eye curving down what 's outside the point of focus . 
  just a great shot . 
  the sound of it hitting the plate . . actually lol . 
  what in the * hell * ? 
  i 'm most disturbed by the loose ground ( ? ), 
  dangling up front . 
  or the exposed transformer terminals ( again , could be wrong ) . 
  this needs the biggest '' ** do n't touch !, 
  ** '' sign i can imagine . 
  e : this is an excellent post !, 
  just re-read my comment and hope it is n't taken otherwise .

  i wonder how hard the main landing gear had to work on that second touch down .

  totally forgot to post this [ behemoth ] ( http://denbrunamaten.se/2011/02/20/falsk-pizza-senapspanerade-grisaknorrar-med-kumminpantoffler-och-mullvad/ ) of swedish traditional food .

  but you 're still right . 
  if you do n't mind me asking , are you a swede living in the nl or have you just visited sweden and eaten the food ? 
  huh . 
  not often i meet fellow swedish dutch . 
  thinking about moving back to study myself , moved away at 6 . 
   eller byte av kompis, 
  just det.

   the opposite direction of the tree 's fall . 
  tree falls away from trunk . 
  so , towards the tree 's trunk ? 
  i 'm just being an ass , maybe you meant perpendicular to the direction of the tree 's fall . 
  had n't they ` blocked ' tpb in the uk already ? 
  funny how it 's mentioned here again as a target , third time 's a charm i guess ? 
  which is a shame since angerfist 's classics are very dear to me . 
  this some bullshit, 
  this is what you wanted . 
  from the pic i can read that degrees fahrenheit are indicated on the display . 
  from there on it 's pretty straightforward that / u/1beauregard must be right . 
  quality linking . 
  anything you can eat that would help proofreading ? 
  nope , they 're only on the bottom of the lid edge ( the part of the lid that touches the jar first when you put it on ) . 
  they do n't extend all the way down the side of the lid . 
  perhaps with a tool . 
  * i 'm so confused , i 'm gon na shatter bricks with this hammer !, 
  what do they look like on the inside ? 
  i tought this was in reference to a recently played game or something but there 's nothing in the comments . 
  i 'm not sure i get it either . 
  funny you should say that , [ this ] ( http://www.ledgrow.eu ) guy started developing his own led panels with the goal of producing more than 1 gram/kwhour with them . 
  he 's been logging the developement since 2008 , including him reaching his goal 2 years later . 
  the panels are now for sale . 
   and all you link me to is his for sale page ? 
  nope . 
  see how it says `` set-up 1 & 2 '' all the way to `` set-up 15 '' ? 
  those are the sequential grows and panel design changes , pretty straight forward . 
  you ca n't buy anything on that domain . 
  i know , right ? 
  cool to know , did n't think of that . 
  i can recall op stated his doc was surprised this plate bent , so in this case i believe it was unintentional . 
  if a single drop of oil was hanging from the tip in pic 3 it would be so awesome . 
  nice knife . 
  does the ( copper-coloured ) ridge just inside of the top opening have a thin wear line across the middle ? 
  if so , that would support the plant stand theory imo . 
  this has something to do with hardcore techno / gabber . . ca n't look it up now . 
  rape is ** everywheeeeerreeee ** !, 
  he is senor speedy gonzales , the [ fastest ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dle358dpgxu ) mouse in all of mexico !, 
  ( last 5 secs for relevance ), 
  i can imagine this makes sense intuitively , but actually bikes already ` go straight ' due to their geometry . 
  i believe if you 'd give this bike a push on level ground it would fall down quicker than a bike without a spring . 
  what am i looking at here ? 
  do you know the model name of your 14 drive ( hp ? ), 
  combination jbod/server ? 
  would you mind me asking if i could expect to find that server at that price somewhere public ? 
  something smelling off , christoff ? 
  okay !, 
  i 'm in eu though , i do n't see any link just yet . . 
  e : got it !, 
  nice collection . 
  maybe i would n't be too happy if the shock damping packaging of the 10 pcs . 
  box is what it looks like . 
  there 's a figurative way of calling somebody retarded too . 
  this is a shit post . 
  day 2 you 've had the clones ? 
  if they sprouted 2 days ago you might be on to something . . / jk, 
  yes , especially when the head is resting on a hard surface . 
  in this case it would end in successful defense against a person wielding a knife . 
  [ honorable mention ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhst2ukehlm ), 
  yeah i figure that means he ai n't an asshole . 
  i was just looking into this the other day and found http://www.free60.org, 
  i just ca n't help asking for the other pic . 
  thanks for the pic , adds strength to the message you put in the title . 
  that injury must 've been a bitch to clean out both for the staff * and * the casualty . 
  damn .
