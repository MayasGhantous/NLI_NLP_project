  if you read buckfast 's wiki you 'd see it 's only sold in the uk . 
  not sure they 'd allow such alcohol-caffeine combos anyway . 
  how does the vaseline/white petrolatum recommendation conflict with the advice never to apply any ointments/fats/etc to a burn until it has healed to a certain degree ? 
  not calling you out , genuinely curious were these points of do/don ' t intersect . 
  thanks for the reply !, 
  i was under the ( wrongful ) impression jelly/ointments were to be avoided for a considerable time for reasons other than heat insulation . 
  of course i ca n't name any ( because there are n't any beyond insulation ) . . go figure . 
  the more you know !, 
  that 's the most impressive `` and-that 's - how-i-started-smoking-again '' - story in a while . 
  * please * use the line [ death by a thousand leaks ] ( https://www.google.com/#q=%22death+by+a+thousand+leaks%22+snowden ) somewhere . . 
  this is a nice contrast to all the latte art and steamed milk . 
  i 'd dare to bet for the majority of coffee drinkers , this is how one of the highlights of the day looks like . 
  sloppy , no time for flower leaves . 
  they need to ** work ** . 
  not having a go at baristas or whatever . 
  just pointing out how coffee has a broad spectrum of consumers . 
  that 's how they make a run , by reaching the opposite wicket ( and returning i believe ) . 
  this is the end of my cricket knowledge . 
  \\* * beep * \\*, 
  i think there 's might be potential in a comic where palestineball tries to reach a cemetery in their homeland but ca n't because the hypercube is settling on it . 
  that was * such * disappointing camerawork . 
  * so we installed that streaming server you wanted ... *, 
  this some tumblr ** bullshit ** . 
  this is n't what this sub is about ** at all ** . 
  i do n't know man . 
  this is a blatant x-post of some `` stuff that makes you say no '' , not / r/nononono material . 
  e : or as somebody else put it , / r/nope . 
  no , it 's `` ooh !, 
  a bug startled me . '', 
   `` oh my god i am about to fucking die '', 
  yes some might figuratively feel like that ( or do you mean an actual near-death experience from a bug ? ), 
  but the point is ** you are n't ** about to die . 
  it 's in your head . 
  you 're scared . 
  this sub is about reality slowly but surely taking a turn for the worse . 
  the bigger the physics and material cost involved , the better . 
  not fucking feels from bugs . 
  finding that took me too long . 
  i wish that argument held up for / r/jailbait and / r/creepshots !, 
  why 'd you put tumblr in the title ? 
  it has n't anything to do with the content . 
  the name of the bike or its designer would 've been more helpful . 
  this is the polar opposite of what happends when a train `` spins out '' ( wheels move , train does n't ) . 
  it grinds nice dimples in the train track , there was a post of that here a while back i believe . 
  i bet there 's american hicks fucking animals far and wide in the states . 
  better yet i 'm positive there are news items about and video footage of them . 
  the difference is there 's not a foreign power hovering in the sky recording shit with flir . 
  this is the worst post i 've ever seen . 
  such utter crap . 
  too many reasons to count . 
  i wish this was posted to infuriate people , at least then it would have * some * quality to it . 
  what i saw of that farmer who got his colon perforated by a horse dick while he was running a zoophilic brothel and making videos was enough wtf for me really . 
  that 's the one !, 
  three points of prep , one ingenuity and one actual choice you can influence after you realise you 're in trouble . . being prepared is n't half the battle , it 's more !, 
  plus the deduping script lead to a steady decrease of your upload speed , ending in a crawl . 
  it was posted here ( ? ), 
  not too long ago , but i ca n't find it now so i 'm not sure if it was bitcasa 's implementation . 
  as for op 's question , all i know is blackblaze from their interesting storage server design blog posts . 
  i see . 
  trying to find that post showed me how big of a topic and challenging a proper deduping implementation is , or at least how much discussion goes on about it . 
  * damn * . 
  * this flange must 've been a mistake during the production of my batch of lug nuts . . what are the odds !, 
  and out comes the angle grinder . 
  i 'm afraid i ca n't be any real help beyond commending you for investigating an issue with your car instead of ignoring it . 
  there must be a cause for this change in behavior , i just know the general parts that make up a clutch assembly ( but not the pedal side ) and ca n't think of any cause that 's safe to ignore . 
  myself i 'd use [ this ] ( http://www.ehow.com/how_4583603_adjust-clutch-vw-jetta.html ) very vague guide and the relevant ones in the sidebar only to investigate if i 'd need to bring it to a mechanic or not by looking for obvious damage . 
  that site does in no way offer manufacturer-approved instructions for your car . 
  hope somebody chimes in who can make a recommendation !, 
  do n't even try , that post was ** fucked up ** and you know it . 
  yes . 
  so it goes in / r/nope for feels , not / r/nononono for reality being a bitch . 
  lol at the subtle '' * need a doctor ? 
  * '' in pic 1 . 
  hostility does n't mean you do n't get to call people out . 
  a non-hostility rule = / = non-negativity rule . 
  if i was being an ass for no reason , sure that might be out of line in light of that rule . 
  but this post is just utter crap . 
  man that electric buzzing could n't have been better for comedic effect even if it was added after the fact . 
  palestine penthouse for good measure ? 
  i think it could be swedish . 
  i impatiently skipped ahead in the video , instantly i see norton 2010 ( ? ), 
  all over my screen and i 'm laughing . 
  the new literal hitler . 
  holy fuck . 
  it was * such * a letdown not seeing jordan 's treb take out the castle at his first treb push . 
  / r/motorcyclejerk ? 
  off the top of my head right now : a reliance on strings for melody rather than kicks for atmosphere . 
  it 's early i 'll add some more [ examples ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hahwxidv0y ) when i 've done some shit on my schedule . 
  samma problem i [ holland ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/netherlands/comments/1sywvc/chart_the_fragmentation_of_the_dutch_political/ ) . 
  good thing they labeled the before and after shots !, 
  was confused there for a moment . 
  [ eve ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdfezuoofgi ) was spot on !, 
  very interesting . 
  that [ wheelie ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=wbtc5mx8ekw#t=70 ) heading for the bus had me puckering, 
  prod server prep ? 
  migration ? 
  honestly , do n't underestimate the kick in the groin . 
  a split-second before you attack , ask how their mother is doing . 
  best case , you 've distracted them enough to not block it . 
  worst case . . eh , who knows,
