  it is a presentation laid out by the ones taking the picture . 
  kind of how hunters pose with their kills , showing claws/teeth prominently . 
  it 's to show the caliber of their targets . 
  he dropped the bar behind his back , it hit his spine before it reached the floor . 
  it looks like he was sitting down when it hit him , so imagine sitting with your legs flat on the floor , lower back slightly curved forward and somebody drops something heavy enough on your lower back to sever your spinal cord . 
  ouch .

  getright 's segmeted downloading and ` getright browser ' are two exceptional features . 
  i 'd really recomment looking at it 's feature list . 
  the writing is hebrew . 
  it looks lilke some highly decorated vice-like tool , with two handles that pivot around the hub in the top left . 
  i hope it ai n't for circumcising babies . 
  any plastic bag will do , it creates a temporary faraway-cage that makes it easier for the lightning to go around your computer into anything rubber . 
  that intro was it 's very own kind of funny .

  you 'd look less silly doing that in / r/murica , people might actually think you 're serious here . 
  the russians lost a few men , too . 
  those are * so * comfortable !, 
  compared to sitting on a bin of used needles . 
  i see what you 're trying to say , but the graph sucks . 
  you could 've left out half the graph , those people ca n't read it anyway . 
  somebody should x-post this to / r/dataisbeautiful just to piss 'em off . 
  perhaps an ir floodlight for security cams ?

  that pic is strange , does n't the flame need to be off for the bottom chamber to chill and draw down the liquid ?

  you might be male , but you can still whine like a little bitch . 
  if you 're trying to troll people into thinking less of srs , it helps not to name the sub in your day-old username . 
  ca n't say i disapprove of your efforts though . 
  you can quicken that drying ( after wiping with a cloth ) by holding the wrong end of the lighter and rolling the flint wheel over a flat and soft surface , like the side of a tree . 
  it 'll wear down your flint stone but in an emergency you 'll get a spark by the third sweep .

  what serious studio monitor owner * does n't * have three of 'em ? 
  you know , for left , right and mono channels !,

  what is the tool in the bottom left ? 
  is the punch with wheel for setting rivets ? 
  thanks , i was wondering what you 'd use a leather punch for on aircraft . 
  could you explain what the tool in the bottom left is for ? 
  it looks like pliers with soome type of pump between the handles . 
  that 's really neat , thanks !, 
  i really appreciate specialist tools . 
  i noticed the guy in the video has a non-reversible pair by the way , good to know airplanes get the bees ' knees !,
