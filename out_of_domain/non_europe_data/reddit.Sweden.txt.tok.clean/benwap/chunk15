  thanks , congrats on the find !, 
  what are the thinner cables in pic 5 patching through ? 
  two-conductor phone cable ? 
  for example port 50 in the top , with loads at the bottom . 
  so the patch panels marked x1 and x2 in pic 5 offer both 8p8c ethernet and fiber connectivity ? 
  or are the thicker cables fiber too ? 
  interesting , had n't seen that before . 
  when in doubt , pay homage to the duke . 
  what does the squirrel-kingpin say in the last half second ? 
  the squirrel-kingpin intimidates me . 
  [ website ] ( http://bugatti100p.com/bugatti-100p.html ) describes them as counter-rotating propellers ... 
  they kind of look like urine sample containers , given that there 's a thermometer too . 
  you need a trigger warning or something ? 
  ** damn **, 
  dat compressor output diameter . 
  or is the big diagonal tube unrelated to compressor-turbine ducting ? 
  it 's lower in fat . 
  which is , all else remaining equal , healthier for * most * . 
  dish a has certain dietary properties ( fat , fibres , carbohydrates , etc ) . 
  i pour 20g of molten butter on it . 
  did i make it healthier ? 
  i 'm not saying everybody needs to cut as much fat as possible . 
  but you ca n't argue that a leaner meat is less healthy for the majority of the populatioon that is overweight . 
  op states specifically choosing this meat for the lower fat content , do n't you think this is for health reasosn ?

  use cheap usb hubs , make a raid array for fun .

  like the orthodox jews ? 
   most countries are n't surrounded on all sides by countries filled with people that hate and want to kill them . 
  so why does israel ? 
  if lower temps would increase performace , you could estimate how much a drop in temp would increase your profits and use that to budget the power/invest costs of a small a/c unit cooling a tent around the rack . 
  i 've never fired a gun and even i am familiar with this person . 
  do n't forget loaning in lending-borrowing . . 
  very interesting point , checks out in dutch , swedish . . 
  might one accidentaly operate on oneself with that knife while shooting or would you say it 's okay form in ` the trenches ' ? 
  yeah also i got that from the filename . 
  was just curious if the knife would be considered a gaffe too . 
  it gets worse . 
  not to be a pessimist , i 'm just saying there 's other platforms/forums etc. . 
  nice audio, 
  verry nice . . good to know . 
  * slow clap *, 
  very intressant . 
  i 'm sure this was great live , but the add-style of presenting was ... too demanding to follow . 
  so that * is * why they call them lucky str ... oh . 
  also there has been a certain lion from the north already , history tells us . . 
  jup , wrap up and go back home ppl !, 
  ca n't hear you , i 'm on my way home !, 
  yes, 
  wait no, 
  * fuck * you suck, 
   third of all , chill out and learn how to troubleshoot without throwing a temper tantrum . 
  well , [ fuck ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyk089n3ja0 ), 
  you 're welcome !, 
  now kill yourself .

  try ` open disc ' in vlc ? 
  you 're mounting fine , arc media theater seems like a problem . 
  mental issues , methinks . . 
  i 'll need a screenshot of vlc 's error to help you further . 
  perhaps the iso 's creator screwed up the menu structure , easier than you think if you do n't know what you 're doing . 
  thanks . 
   i select the drive the . iso file is in . . 
  . . means you select the * virtual * drive you 've used to * mount * the . iso ? 
  after mounting , opening this virtual drive in explorer lets you see the contents of the . iso ? 
  just to be clear . 
  if so , the menu structure of the . iso seems corrupt for some reason . 
  coud this be the case/who made it ? 
  i 'd suggest downloading a different image if possible , alternatively one can rebuild the menu structure and create a repaired . iso with dvd/br authoring software but this can be daunting to novices . 
  i could be wrong . 
  it 's just that vehemently denying you 're insane on the internet is like trying to convince a bouncer you 're not shitfaced . 
  the menu structure of the . iso seems corrupt for some reason . 
  coud this be the case/who made it ? 
  if in vlc ( forget arcmedia for the moment ) you 're pressing `` open disc ... ( ctrl + d ) '' [ here ] ( http://www.videolan.org/doc/play-howto/en/images/play-howto/intf-wx-file-menu.jpg ) and then choosing h :\\ gives you an error you 'll wan na get a new download . 
  your last sentence does n't make much sense :-\\ but i see it could be corrupt . 
   it would mean that the . iso file is corrupted ? 
  yes, 
   could it be that vlc needs an upgrade ? 
  probably not , try, 
   my weird keyboard, 
  layout or physically weird ? 
  typed on osk.exe, 
   screenshot, 
   . jpg, 
  indeed . 
  and as much as i appreciate formality and protocol , you may adress me in the 1 ^ st person online  tack \u00e4nd\u00e5 !,
