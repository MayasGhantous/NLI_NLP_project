  i know , showing his total ignorance of protein coagulation and its temperature range . 
  next time he has a hot load in his mouth he should think about how it does n't coagulate before he swallows . 
  i could n't even explain toast to you if googling `` protein coagulation temp range '' does n't come to mind . 
  yeah , you 're done .

  haha errybody hates you,

  first time i 've seen a gasket on a slowcooker lid . 
  any comments on the gasket material and/or how it compares to a ` regular ' lid ? 
  i 'd paint that slotted exhaust cover in the colour of your outside wall . 
  not sure what side of the house it 's on , but some would want to hide it completely some way . 
  danger to the manifold !, 
  same issue here , maybe / r/enhancement can help ? 
  get raped, 
  if that ingrown nail had a name , it 'd be shadowmaker because the thing casts a damn shadow . 
  cue the russiatoday anchorman ranting on about how putin 's actions are stabilising the region and protecting local ethnic russians and how the us and eu are the agressors with their threat of sanctions and the local nazi groups are being sponsored by them to further eu interests locally they have to be stopped and pls gib clay etc etc etc, 
  if you 're looking for a new ai challenge , look into resonance22 's custom monster ai . . they ( res and 3 other high-lever players ) went 4 vs 2 in one game and got royally owned . 
  edit : [ here ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfklh4lyrgg ) 's a three day old 6v2 , showcasing the ai . . 
  not sure , do n't think so as it sounds like something you 'd mention when casting a match centered around the challenge of beating the ai . 
  but i ca n't say for sure . 
  edit : as resonance22 himself and cysionbe have said , the ai cheats . 
  i just watched the 6v2 cast and resonance22 starts it off with saying it cheats ( although it cheats less now than before ) . 
  last time i saw resonance22 using his ai was a long time ago , hence my hazy memory . 
  i know it , i eat it , i love it . 
  one has mod [ tantrums ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/1w1qt3/listen_up_cupcakes_shitty_ammo_and_you/cey07z9 ) , one does n't . 
  thanks !, 
  i 've edited my comment . 
  felt a bit silly when i started watching the recent 6v2 and one of the first things you say is the ai does indeed cheat , my bad . . 
  hope your allergies go easy on you the coming days !,

  according to the doc they 're fan connectors with 3 pins . 
  that means somebody saw 3 pins ( not 4 sometimes seen for processor fans ) and pushed that 4-conductor power cable on it . 
  wow . 
  i 'm no mechanic either but keep in mind the water is not a gas , even if the gasket fails you 'd need to disperse a whole cylinder of water that does n't compress through that gap in an instant . 
  would ` ya look at that . 
  also it seems to be labeled f2 not fan 2 .

  so you used your vps as a buffer ? 
  you 'd still be limited to 100kbps bandwidth when the files to your local system , right ? 
  i was about to say it would look so good spinning that i think it should be reinstated , if nothing else to do right by the mods/css writers .

  yeah this client 's system was all kinds of fucked . 
  aero glass had some issue that caused the start button to spontaneously become fuzzy , as if a transparent window was placed over it . 
  one press of the windows button and it would ` pop to the foreground ' again . 
  the list with issues like this went on and on . 
  backup and reinstall was recommended but client wanted to save $ 's .
