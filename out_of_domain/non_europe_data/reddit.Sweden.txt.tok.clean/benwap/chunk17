  edit : [ decent recap ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/subredditdrama/comments/251m5c/game_of_rtechnology_a_song_of_salt_and_butter_the/ ), 
  just added [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/subredditdrama/comments/251m5c/game_of_rtechnology_a_song_of_salt_and_butter_the/ ) recap to my comment . 
  bottom line : my personal issue following all this , is that everytime anything 's posted by any of these users , i ca n't shake the thought they 're getting paid by the hit on the links . 
  this shadow even hangs over the frontpage subs they moderate or other subs they have close friends in . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/subredditdrama/search?q=%2fr%2ftechnology&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all ) a rabbit hole , who knows how deep it goes ?

  myself i 'd just go to the first aid and explain what happened . 
  they 'll ask for valid id + health insurance so have your own countries ' version of that with you !, 
  maybe it 's a patch of that sticky foam you use to hang up posters on walls . 
  it looks like it has a wrapper of wax paper . 
  in the eu gas [ vessles ] ( http://www.metalworker.eu/gieten/pictures/ovengas/gas6kg.jpg ) sold retail do n't have this safety valve . 
  a new bottle that consumers are allowed to fill at an lpg retail station does have a overfill [ valve ] ( http://www.zizocampertechniek.nl/wp-content/uploads/alu-fles-boven.png ) but they 're very expensive due to various required safety mechanisms .

  imagining the menatilty of making those pants made me think of [ this ] ( http://www.vikinganswerlady.com/medicine.shtml ) ( arrow wound treatment ) :, 
   then she took a large pair of tongs , and tried to pull out the iron ; but it sat too fast , and would in no way come , and as the wound was swelled , little of it stood out to lay hold of . 
  now said thormod , `` cut so deep in that thou canst get at the iron with the tongs , and give me the tongs and let me pull . '', 
   then thormod took the tongs , and pulled the iron out ; but on the iron there was a hook , at which there hung some morsels of flesh from the heart , -- some white , some red . 
  when he saw that , he said , `` the king has fed us well . 
  i am fat , even at the heart-roots ; and so saying he leant back , and was dead . '',

  any experience with using an [ interconnect ] ( http://www.gasproducten.nl/lpggasfles/lpg_vulnippel.htm ) ( dutch language ) to fill regular gas bottles at lpg stations ? 
  edit :, 
   the green ones are going out of production and are being replaced with the blue ones ( primagaz easyblue ) . 
  that green bottle is an 11kg propane container type that many companies use to sell gas ( antargaz for example but theirs are grey ) . 
  that 's tough work .
