  i would n't recommend wireshark to a novice . 
  i 'd check your modem 's wired and wireless clients as listed in the modem interface , make sure all clients are clean of malware and p2p . 
  your modem should have a traffic usage indicator , hopefully by the day or some other small increment . 
  if necessary , whitelist ( allow only their mac address access ) the clients one by one until the problem shows up in the traffic usage indicators .

  i 'm tempted to leave this blank to illustrate but that would n't be adding much to the discusion .

   mockingly emphasising his thumbs, 
  i 'm impressed you spotted that . 
  did they change the font ? 
  what the fuck did you just fucking say about me , you little bitch ? 
  i 'll have you know i graduated top of my class in the navy seals , and i 've been involved in numerous secret raids on al-quaeda , and i have over 300 confirmed kills . 
  i am trained in gorilla warfare and i 'm the top sniper in the entire us armed forces . 
  you are nothing to me but just another target . 
  i will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this earth , mark my fucking words . 
  you think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the internet ? 
  think again , fucker . 
  as we speak i am contacting my secret network of spies across the usa and your ip is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm , maggot . 
  the storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life . 
  you 're fucking dead , kid .

  not only am i extensively trained in unarmed combat , but i have access to the entire arsenal of the united states marine corps and i will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent , you little shit . 
  if only you could have known what unholy retribution your little `` clever '' comment was about to bring down upon you , maybe you would have held your fucking tongue . 
  but you could n't , you did n't , and now you 're paying the price , you goddamn idiot . 
  i will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it . 
  you 're fucking dead , kiddo .

  she bases her question on a perceived `` gender gap '' in the developement group , suggesting there 's a mandatory ratio of males to females they should be meeting but are n't . 
  what 's your thought on that rhetoric ? 
  she says there 's a gap , not that it should be 50-50 . . 
  anything other than the * target ratio * is a gap . 
  you 're assuming the target ratio is 50-50 . 
  maybe they want as many women developing per male as there are woman gamers per male ? 
  you 're right . 
  everybody 's assuming she wants it to be 50-50 . who knows what crazy ratio she deems adequate ? 
  maybe every department must have one woman . 
  maybe the back office ( hr , acccounting etc ) needs to be at least 50 % female . 
  could be anything , she just mentioned * a * gap . 
  who the hell knows ? 
  i did n't mention this gap , i 'm just saying it has n't been defined as 50-50 by her but left quite vague .

  some even do the opposite , syncing electronic tracks to acoustic rythms . . de-quantization ? 
  the acoustic drummer can reproduce ( relevant parts of ) the drumline , which itself could have been made purely from samples from the start .
