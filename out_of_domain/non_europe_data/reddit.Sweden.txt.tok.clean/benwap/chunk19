  they 're like track switching on trainstations where trains go in and out on the same side . 
  at certain pauses you can see a divider being slid over to expose a different tube . 
  bascially the tube shoots into the station and exits the same side but enters a different tube because of a movable cover . 
  the choices keep 'em off the paint fumes . . 
   cerns partikelaccelerator, 
  i know , but . . just let it slide . 
  we do n't judge such in here . . we just discreetly pass the kleenex ( or windex but hey shit happens ) . 
  it ai n't good for the rubber in the tire . . but i do n't see anything nearby that catches fire at a temp under water 's boiling point ( heater max temp ) . 
  that one was least satisfying for me . . care to elaborate ? 
  huh . . you 're right that 's a rear wheel . . 
  that * does * make it better . . 
  all i care about is the fit . 
  his post took it . 
  that looks quite sophisticated . 
  anybody want to chime in on the value of such a specialized group of solutions ? 
  to minimize rack space ? 
  he should 've quoted the satirical article that went on about multiple lethal overdoses etc. . the swedish minister of justice thought it was real an tweeted about how horrible it was . 
  look at [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=wspqzplscqc ) ( turn on english subs ) . 
  flat-feet-squatters of western eu respresent !, 
  thanks . 
  i guess i 'm so far removed from ` big iron ' that i assumed all that r&d must have a specific application . 
  i also assumed it needed two racks minimum to function but now i think about it ( sober ) i guess that does n't need to be the case . 
  big iron is awesome .

  he really jumped at the chance to start whacking the damn thing . 
  the machinist knows his stuff and called somebody out who does n't . 
  i think he 's done it many times before , the more often you do it the crasser one gets . 
  it 's no big deal .

  in light of your deleted comment saying you 'd mark this as solved when it was - when would you consider this post solved ?

  are you a frequent poster on this sub or something ? 
  just wondering why the usual scepticism is n't expressed by anyone here . 
  yeah i think we 're being downvoted for not seeing the joke . 
  i value company over sarcasm detection skills in almost any situation .

  fyi , i was really high when i wrote that . 
   `` everyday fits '' that use items such as bottles , caps , rings , tape , shelves , cabinets , lids , boxes and coins are generally removed as they are usually both unsurprising and uninteresting .

  on a side note - an * electric * ceramic kiln will consume extreme amounts of electricity ( hence the plug ) . 
  depending on your situation a propane kiln can be had for cheap and will repay itself * very * quickly compared to some utility prices . 
  how does 6 switches , an e-stop and a toggle switch in a rugged housing add up to $ 2000 ? 
  are there special materials involved , or are r&d costs covered in the price ? 
  that housing held up well to 300 tons though . 
  make that account deleted/removed .
