  this could go straight to [ / r/awesome ] ( / r/awesome ) as far as i 'm concerned . 
  europe sees what you did there . 
  `` you shit my boat ? 
  i slit your throat '', 
  because fuck , it makes enough sense . 
  reminds me of [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/lifeprotips/comments/x3j57/lpt_hang_a_painting_with_a_soda_tab_and_two_thumb/ ) . 
  the blue tack is pressed through the top loop into the wall . 
  people were bashing it , but it stuck in that chaotic household until we moved out . 
  the guy holding what looks to be his dick is cropped out :(, 
  \u00c5h fy fan . 
  i honestly thought i was in [ / r/destructionporn ] ( / r/destructionporn ) . . 
  nice !, 
  your cigar appears reversed , and uncut . 
  notable omission : oversized knot . 
  unless they use a power-over-fiber injector so they can slap fiber repeaters in between , right ? 
  just like putting another flashlight at the end of a beam , i read somewhere . . 
  looked for a [ crank arm ] ( http://www.infovisual.info/05/img_en/034%20crank%20gear.jpg ) , could only find a chain wheel . . did i miss it ? 
  wow , what 's this ? 
  i 'll see if i can find anything relevant . . 
  no * more * half pizzas , walther . 
  netherlands ? 
  the commanding officer of the vincennes got a [ medal ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iran_air_flight_655#medals_awarded ) . 
  quote from the wikipedia article :, 
   in 1990 , rogers was awarded the legion of merit `` for exceptionally meritorious conduct in the performance of outstanding service as commanding officer ... from april 1987 to may 1989 . '', 
  the award was given for his service as the commanding officer of the vincennes , and the citation made no mention of the downing of iran air 655 . 
  when people ask me to tell them a joke out of nowhere , i just pull this one and stare . 
  you should too . 
  those are pictures of quality just low enough for me to get angry about not seeing more , wanting to answer your question for myself also . 
  so there 's that ... 
  reminds me of a child-station a character used to hack his evil employer 's mainframe in some `` hacker movie '' . 
  his employer had a bit of a microsoft vibe around it , if that is of any help . 
  * cough * banner right behind it . . banner !, 
  * cough *, 
  that 's it !, 
  says the leader and creator ? 
  [ wsus offline update ] ( http://download.wsusoffline.net/ ) is your friend . 
  maybe because op only sees people use it in this way ? 
  then you have n't grasped the way the tool works . 
  if it looks stupid and works , it ai n't stupid . 
  trailingedge 's story reminded me of [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=462h-xbprse ) lovely sounding lady . 
  yeah , that 's when it becomes stupid . 
  call me a devil 's advocate , but this could work out in a pinch to grab a rare driver from a disc or something . . 
  i agree it 's not a long-term or hot weather solution though . 
  then guess what that makes it , 
  if you 're on drugs , you would n't have a choice . . 
  if you 're sleep deprived to boot , concerned would n't be the word ... 
  no , see that third rack ? 
  this must be * at least * a metric fuck-tonne of cable . 
  2 ) post the pics, 
  i laughed louder than i have for a long time on the internet . . just everything : the awkwardly large picture composition , making your colleague look even lonelier . 
  or the fact that you did n't blur his face but the monitors ( of course in hindsight i 'm very glad you did ) . 
  the god-awful carpet or the shirt that is even worse ? 
  the total package and my sleep deprivation perhaps . 
  for what it 's worth i 've submitted this to [ opdelivers ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/opdelivers/comments/16lvg5/redditor_is_tempted_to_post_pics_of_hand_on_mouse/ ) . 
  you earned it !, 
   dam, 
  see how 4 people probably could have explained , but downvoted you instead ? 
  that 's what 's going on . 
  i was hoping for #shalom . . 
  ... ca n't tell if serious, 
  oh i 've considered different sys fonts , looking for a more original mix between aesthetics and functionality ( i.e. 
  legibility ) . 
  however i could n't imagine a monospaced font looking better and easier on the eyes in a titlebar . 
  hmm . . this got me curious ... * sets lucida console as font everywhere *, 
   even dropping an anchor ( which they could n't because they are in too deep of water ) does not make a boat completely steady, 
  because their chain is too short to cover ( i.e. 
  create friction with ) the necessary bit of seabed right ? 
  i read somewhere on reddit it 's the weight of the chain keeping the ship in one place , not how the anchor ` grabs ' the bottom . 
  can one plow seabed with an anchor ? 
  if you mean for eating , i disagree . 
  your heat source is fine . 
  hold your piece by the straw and rotate it over the candle the highest you can hold it while still producing vapor clouds in the piece . 
  it takes some practice , but after burning it once or twice you 'll know the temperature to avoid . 
  then you might consider rigging it there , even though the piece needs to be stirred during extraction . 
  you might see soot buildup making it harder to judge your temperature . 
  these are unburnt carbons that also give the flame its yellow colour . 
  either wipe it off or use a blue butane flame instead . 
  good luck !, 
  cheers . 
  give it a try without tobacco too , you do n't ` need ' it unless you 're vaporizing resin . 
  even then the tobacco is just there to transfer heat and there are alternatives . 
  for many , vaporizing is a way to avoid tobacco consumption . 
  others are just looking for a different character of herb effects . 
  you used tim ( thermal paste ) right ? 
  we 're all gon na go ahead and ignore the cat5 atrocity going on in the left ? 
  pfft , you call that an illegal splice ? 
  [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/cablefail/comments/12pahr/burned_through_an_extension_reel_reuse_the_parts/ ) is the real deal . 
  it crossed my mind !, 
  glad i was n't the only ~ ~ pun ~ ~ one, 
  i 'm pretty sure this is a symbol used in warchalking . 
  getting more info ... 
  edit : turns out it 's not . 
   i 've seen some shit , man ... 
  i 've seen some shit . 
  i 'm all ears , should you have the time . . 
  wow , great stories . 
  thanks !, 
  is that guy from [ h ] in the 100tb + club or a different thread ? 
  if so , would you mind sending a link my way ? 
  thanks .
