  e : turns out the account * is * shadowbanned and not deleted/removed , the userpage looking like a 404 is a ` feature ' . 
  freedom means deleting the previous post of this link from / r/til 's listing at us dawn and the poster 's account being deleted/removed . 
  e : parent comment was along the lines of `` but freedom ! '' . 
  not sure why it was deleted . 
  seconding alphado33 's praise for your sound reddit logic . 
  thanks , figured it was a matter of time . 
  i had the feeling i might piss somebody off by posting this so i went for it , hoping they 'd see the same post they removed today 24 hours later . 
  bonus satisfaction for using a url shortener to post an already posted link . 
  i would n't say i 'm gloating because this post is highly insignificant , but it 's the little things you know ? 
  why was the poster shadowbanned ? 
  could you maybe draw a dildo in mspaint ? 
  because i 'm not seeing it . . 
  does n't mean mods and admins do n't communicate . 
  she/he knows . 
  no , r. 5 . 
  wait , [ i 'm mixing stuff up ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/2p6o9e/til_that_between_1965_and_1972_the_cia_oversaw_a/ ) . 
  yes , this one was r. 4 . 
  although that pack is very similar , i see differences that make me doubt it 's the one . 
  proves svea stronk even in not lagom situations !, 
  do n't cry , turns out it 's staged . 
  soda + vinegar = base + acid = neutralisation reaction = only water and co2 gas produced . 
  the sandstorm darude, 
  having 70 % of your back burned and a broken lower arm of the bones-sticking-out-level sounds more annoying ... in hindsight of course . 
  old-as-fuck mousepad ? 
  that 's not really specific to woodworking , though . 
  if op made this from papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 and glue , spending five hours threading the hole by hand , someone might have said `` you could have used a threaded insert '', 
  is there a video of this ? 
  because i know for a fact that there 's a video of this . 
  but ruining perfectly good beer and soda by mixing it together and naming it after a combustion fuel ( cycle ) * does * make sense ? 
  try pre-boiling the water before adding the filled coffee holder and top part . 
  once the water boils lift the bottom part off with the top part or turn off the gas . 
  once back on the lowest heat setting i find coffee starts flowing almost immediately at a controllable and low rate . 
  side note - drag & resize produces spectacular moir\u00e9 effects on my 22 '' 1920x1080 screen . 
  probably has to do with the pixels ' prominent grid outline . 
  thank you for the informative comment !, 
  i have three questions if you do n't mind :, 
  * what are the two hinges for in pic 2 ? 
  * what do you use to move the water and how to you control the volume so the soil stays dry ? 
  * are there differences between the ` pots ' in the front row vs. the ones in the back of pic 1 & 2 ? 
  except being able to walk on it obviously . 
  very interesting set up . 
  thanks . 
  i guess question two was on the flood/drain method . 
  what 's the separation between the hydroton layer and the pond ? 
  does it drain back via piping or straight into the pond it 's sitting on top of ? 
  i assumed water was pumped from the pond containing fish into the closed hydroton layer which would be drained back to the pond . 
  thanks a lot for clearing that up - again , very interesting set up !, 
  people are giving you shit but i appreciate black humor . 
  bottom line you 're right anyway . 
  good yule !, 
  if you do n't mind me asking , how do you feel about that course of events ? 
  your comment is in pretty neutral tone . 
  i 'm laughing my ass of , it 's like russel crowe recognizes the sound but fights himself from reacting . 
  it 's a [ hole saw ] ( http://www.starrett.co.uk/shop/holesaws/tct_multi_purpose_hole_saw/ ) , and a pretty rugged one at that . 
  i 'm not sure what material the cutting tips are made of but i think it 's tough stuff given the amount of 'em implies this is a heavy duty tool . 
  compare with other general hole saws and you 'll see this one is quite beefy and perhaps specialised . 
  edit : it 's probably a masonry / [ concrete ] ( http://www.amazon.com/cutting-diameter-metal-concrete-brick/dp/b0087y87vu ) hole saw . 
  no , i tried searching for combinations of `` a.d.w. 
  60mm 320rpm masonry hole saw '' but could n't find a brand . 
  you can either lower the resolution in-game or get a larger monitor at the same resolution ( lower [ dot pitch ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dot_pitch ) ) . 
  or use a projector . 
  [ this ] ( http://steamcommunity.com/app/221380/discussions/0/828935673003315590/ ) says the only way in your situation is to lower the desktop resolution before launching the game . 
  good luck !, 
   thanks reddit, 
  it 's only us ( and / u/curiousdrive ) in here man . 
  right now , we * are * reddit . 
  try upvoting instead . 
   there 's nothing wrong with this one, 
  you mean you ca n't * find * anything wrong , which is something different . 
  [ point in case ] ( http://deep6inc.com/previewher15.html ) ( medical pics ) . 
  e : nsfl obviously if you 're eating, 
   i 'm eating, 
  and decided to look at medical pics ?

  crankin ' ( cry-wanking , crying while masturbating ) is allegedly a thing on certain threads on 4chan . 
  ca n't remember any context , sorry !, 
  i feel like a coffee , but do n't have that much time . 
  true . 
  the blood ( containing iron ) in the bruise is slowly reabsorbed by the skin causing the colour to change as it heals . 
  fun fact : if you get a bruise big enough you 'll reabsorb so much iron in such a short time your system suffers iron overload . 
  i do n't think so , but i 'm not a doctor and do n't know how/if one could judge from a pic . 
  i would n't be surprised if they kept a close eye on his blood levels in the hospital with this in mind . 
  i saw a pic of a bruise from a motorcycle accident where it was relevant . 
  i 'll try to find the post , but in the post you saw a left leg * completely * purple . 
  the whole texture of the skin seemed changed because it was so saturated with blood . 
  i 'll see if i can find it because i feel like seeing the pic again . 
  always stuck with me because it 's a fun idea that we carry enough iron in our blood to kill ourselves if we dump it in our skin by sufficient bruising . 
  okay did n't find it but the dark purple area in [ this ] ( https://i.imgur.com/jeeszje.jpg ) gives you an idea of what it looked like over a larger area . 
  notice the red line around the bruise used to monitor it 's growth . 
  i just muttered `` nice '' and chuckled at what i 'm doing with my life .

  thank you for helping me parse that line in the comment . 
  all drives are sealed in the sense that they keep contaminants out of the inside . 
  most drives have a breather hole to equalize internal pressure with their environment . 
  at high altitude the air pressure is so low the read-write head ca n't use the fast moving air around the spinning platter properly to float above it and [ crashes ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/head_crash ) . 
  the solution is to use a drive that is hermetically sealed to maintain a proper internal pressure , these are more expensive of course . 
  there 's also a reason to fill hermetically sealed drives with helium but that 's a different topic .
