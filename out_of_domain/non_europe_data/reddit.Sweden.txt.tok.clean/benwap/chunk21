  seeing that too got me thinking . 
  since so many sites rely on cdns , one can expect noscript users to whitelist ( some of ) them . 
  if an attacker distributes a payload from that cdn , he 'll kinda sorta circumvent noscripts protection . 
  of course whitelisting anything in ns is a tradeoff between functionaly/convenience and security .

  agreed !, 
  seems lagom to me .

  they 're standing in parallel formation to it !, 
  that means they 're in a line , no ?

  oh and there 's the laundromat across the street with a security cam covering the entrance of the daycare . 
  it 's inside the laundromat on high up on the far wall overlooking a row of washing machines towards the shop window with the daycare entrance in view . 
  source : a pic a guy took from inside that i 'm not looking up right now . .

  could you elaborate on the ... weed nutella ? 
  did you add a tincture or butter or . . ? 
  nords have possibly worn horned helmets during ceremonies , there 's a wall painting thought to be depicting them doing that . 
  perhaps this was for something similar . 
  also there 's older terminal keyboards with [ double stacks ] ( http://www.seasip.info/vintagepc/images/6110344.jpg ) of true f - and function keys . 
  this particular one is buckling spring , of course .

  never attribute to incompetence what could be attributed to malice ? 
  does n't make sense to me . 
  the idea is it 's more likely people are dumb than that they 're part of a secret conspiring group of people who 've evaded detection .

  as soon as you explained the thought process of standing outside the bus stop i imagined this story taking place in sweden . 
  shit happens man . 
  owning up then and there , although being brave would n't have changed anything . 
  that kind of clashes with this part of the article :, 
   but even for those such as solomon and yanky who were educated enough to pursue outside professions , their own psychological states work just as well as any external rules to keep them put . 
  the self-policing mechanism kicked in most strongly through the matchmaking apparatus , the place where status is determined in these communities . 
  a person leaving the community puts a blight on their entire family , stigmatising parents , siblings , children , and even cousins , limiting their ability to marry into ` good ' families with no such stain . 
  thoughts ? 
  between the twin towers-looking thumbnail , mention of thermite in the title and aviation sub , all my 9/11-bells started ringing . 
  these youth are drafted from russia 's state-backed [ youth organisation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nashi_%28youth_movement%29 ) , giving their actions a certain state-sanctioned element . 
  in the clips the cops actually * do * get involved , we sometimes see a forced ` apology ' by the aggressor to the camera . 
  i bet the mechanism causing that gives them confidence too . 
  i was expecting somebody to start screaming `` git , git , git !!! '',

  i 'd say there 's [ plenty ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/air_transports_of_heads_of_state_and_government ) ( ctrl + f airbus ) to gain from being able to place malicious code in airbus flight control systems . 
  not saying it 's easy ( neither is writing malware to hdd firmware but i digress ) , just that it 's a potential target . 
  since they 're aware of this i 'd expect their [ colleagues ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/airbus_military ) have safeguards that have been implemented to protect the software in both segments . 
  god-tier gear or good gear ? 
  right up there with sideway toast , man . 
  there was a hype to make toast like [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/shittyfoodporn/comments/2u5kdh/sideways_toasted_bagged_cheese_bread/ ) , the results were n't much to admire - mostly just fire . 
  just yesterday i was talking about cisco branded home use gear that should really be branded linksys because it did n't even log wifi auth attempts or * anything * . 
  ( wrt160n v2 ), 
  and lookit here , a linksys device that looks like serious consumer gear that could 've been branded cisco . 
  what were they thinking ? 
  crossed my mind , but no . 
  those things are hidden , until they 're found like in [ oslo ] ( https://www.google.nl/search?q=oslo+fake+mobile+towers ) .

  / r/wellthatsucks shout-out !, 
  find the radiator with a valve at the highest point of your cv system . 
  so top floor ( if applicable ) , highest mounted radiator with the [ valve ] ( http://mijnhuisinstallatie.nl/websites/mijnhuisinstallatie/gfx/ontluchten3.jpg ) on top . 
  i 've sometimes jacked up the side of the radiator slightly so the valve is the highest point and all the air pools there . 
  just be careful and do n't break loose any fittings - the water inside is very dirty !, 
  the only solution for that is patience , waiting for the air to be drawn down and collect in a radiator . 
  i would n't worry about it as the air ` prefers ' to collect in the radiator corner than hang around in pipes .
