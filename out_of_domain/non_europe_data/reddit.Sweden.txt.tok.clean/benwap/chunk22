  after you 've vented a radiator air from other parts of the system will collect near the valve waiting to be vented again so it should sort itself out . 
  by the way , the site i got that illustration from recommends draining the air from * every * radiator , not just the highest mounted one . 
  sleeping ... with a gun in your hand ? 
  props for the spidey sense . 
  just to be sure , sleeping with your sidearm unholstered is n't encouraged in service right ? 
  and your superiors let it slide because of the hot location . 
  i figured sleeping with it holstered so you do n't drop it would be encouraged but sometimes you just doze off i guess . 
  it looks like he 's going for the slide when he wakes up so you you 're probably right about the chamber .

  if you want to deep clean your washing machine , this is how :, 
  * add 2-4 cups of [ soda ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sodium_carbonate ) to the drum , close the door . 
  * start the hottest ( 90/95c ) program . 
  * wait until the water has been heated ( + / - 20 min ) . 
  you 'll know it 's up to temp when you 're not hearing boiling noises anymore because the heating element has been switched off . 
  * turn off the machine , return 24 hours later . 
  * put the waste water tube in the dosage tray , start draining program to circulate water . 
  let the washer rinse the dosage tray area for 3 minutes . 
  * reconnect the waste water tube to your plumbing , perform drain program . 
  * add half a cup of white vinegar do the dosage tray , perform rinse program . 
  done !, 
  you should n't need to do this more than once a year after your machine is 3 years old . 
  the more often you use the hottest program the less you need to deep clean it . 
  the main concern is soap residue which running a hot program diminishes . 
  e : defined soda, 
  i wrote [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/330kto/what_happens_when_you_use_a_oxygen_bleach/cqgjzgy ) and it 's given me great results . 
  i would n't soak bleach as it 's said it affects some rubber seals . 
  perform [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/330kto/what_happens_when_you_use_a_oxygen_bleach/cqgjzgy ) . 
  it 's mostly old soap residue being dissolved , especially if the machine has n't been used on hot programs once in a while . 
  yep , 
  i add 1/3rd cup to every cycle to lower the water ph. 
  white vinegar is my fabric softener . 
  these are very cheap additives and they do the job for me . 
  [ sodium carbonate ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sodium_carbonate ) . 
  for me it 's the other way around - never seen one with a hot supply , always with a [ heating element ] ( http://i01.i.aliimg.com/img/pb/063/653/419/419653063_248.jpg ) .

  if it 's very hard to reach you can skip the last step but rinse your dosage tray in hot water to remove soap residue .

  keyfob reader to register employee usage of the van ? 
  you contact your fob when you step in/out , management can read out the logs . 
  mo-ther-fuck-ing ** called ** it !, 
  this one was easy though . 
  by now i think it 's best you just ask your employer . 
  if you use the van you need to know . 
  many factors are at play , one i think is important is to what length you use existing components in a new configuration and to what extent you need to r&d specific components to mass produce your prototype . 
  uofapeter makes the best point though , you need to ask somebody in the industry to know you 're covering all factors .
