  did you notice the glass of milk in the pic with the cookie ? 
  mmm . . smoked fish paste 'n milk . 
  the kaviar has a slightly grainy texture , which clings to the film of the milk fat that coats the inside of your mouth . 
  when you swallow the milk the grains slide down the inside of your cheeks . . becoming fishy flavor on the way .

  why can i see all posts when i 'm not logged in , but only this post if i am logged in ? 
  because bicyclists in countries where drivers are not as used to sharing bikes on the road prefer to [ claim the lane ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vehicular_cycling#lane_control ) until they feel they can be passed safely , instead of inviting a driver to make a pass they do n't think is safe . 
  i imagine it 's very irritating especially to those drivers inexperienced with bikes because they do n't understand why the rider is n't letting them pass .

  i see what you 're saying but i 'd love to hit up one of those bbq 's . 
  then again i live in a place where just going to a range for an intro session ( using their guns ) requires leaving a copy of your id and being registered so it will always come up whenever you 're in touch with police/justice . 
  want a permit ? 
  sure , just do n't expect to own a gun the first few years . 
  you get to rent one at the range . 
  when you finally do own one , expect cops at your door whenever they want to surprise inspect your storage and you * have * to let them in so they can snoop around your house on the way to the safe . 
   i 'm a freak .

  my comment was n't purely rhetorical , edit was put in when i was downvoted to -1 without any comment . 
  correct me if i 'm wrong , but using a torque wrench after possibly over-torquing the lug nuts with a impact wrench would n't do anything right ? 
  so it 's just to prevent under torquing . 
  or is over-torquing lug nuts not that big of a deal until you have to take them off ?
