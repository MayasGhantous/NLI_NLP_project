  [ deze ] ( http://www.roseanneworld.com/blog/2015/07/9av-is-about-two-trees-of-conciousness-one-concealed-one-revealed/ ) blog post van gisteren geeft je een idee van haar huidige mentale staat . 
   9av : the day intelligence overcomes racism-every single year !, 
  the day that the positive force defeats the negative force-every year !, 
  this is the day of the singularity-the most powerful point of creation , and of light . 
  the negative force unites the ` colonized soul ' of the 99 % in ( un ) conscious thoughts of the ` inevitability ' of chaos destruction and death , the ` tree of the knowledge of good and evil . ' - a manmade tree . 
  yet-the real force-the 1 % concealed reality-the ` tree of life ' - the force of intelligence shrouded in klipot ( ten levels of negativity ... concealing the nourishing nut of nuvka ) is revealed . 
   this is the beginning of the inward journey of letting satan babylon , separatism , ignorance , addiction to false reality , feudalism-fall . 
  celebrate , do n't mourn !, 
  be a revolutionary-trust that the universe is 51 % positive . 
  mourning that fact aids the negative side . 
  do n't trust anything that comes from european philosophies . 
  step away from babylon . 
  let it fall !, 
  you keep saying that . 
  how would they break a window with leather ?

  i think op 's cousin should check his car for ninja rocks .

  i think [ this comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/whatisthisthing/comments/3fu33j/can_anyone_help_me_id_the_maker_of_this_teapot/ctsm260 ) should help , no ? 
  do n't think so , i 've seen clips of him playing an organ really well . 
  this video was probably a series of bad decisions made by him , his manager , and sony . 
  the roof is on fire, 
  that was a maybach , they recently entered production again . 
   white privilege, 
  you did n't use that term seriously just now , did you ? 
  trolling should n't be this easy , hehe !, 
  e : protip : the race troll works better if you do n't have pictures on your profile of yourself being a white man ( ? 
  what i 'm saying is that you ca n't be serious !, 
  do n't spread it over my beloved / r/suits though , keep the trolling on tumblr - they 're more susceptible to that stuff . 
  is n't powerline ethernet only , or do they have wifi ap 's built in nowadays ?

  are n't the hinges on the wrong side for that though ? 
  if i were to push down on the door handle now it would place the diagonal under compression . . 
  while i agree with the concept op the bar keeping it in shape - to do so it needs to lift up the far side , not pull it down . 
  i 'm afraid the bar would just flex out and not take the compression . 
  * maybe * somebody flipped the door ( put the hinges on the other side ) a ** long ** time ago . 
  i 'd just like to interject for a moment . 
  what you 're referring to as linux , is in fact , gnu/linux , or as i 've recently taken to calling it , gnu plus linux . 
  linux is not an operating system unto itself , but rather another free component of a fully functioning gnu system made useful by the gnu corelibs , shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full os as defined by posix . 
  many computer users run a modified version of the gnu system every day , without realizing it . 
  through a peculiar turn of events , the version of gnu which is widely used today is often called `` linux '' , and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the gnu system , developed by the gnu project . 
  there really is a linux , and these people are using it , but it is just a part of the system they use . 
  linux is the kernel : the program in the system that allocates the machine 's resources to the other programs that you run . 
  the kernel is an essential part of an operating system , but useless by itself ; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system . 
  linux is normally used in combination with the gnu operating system : the whole system is basically gnu with linux added , or gnu/linux . 
  all the so-called `` linux '' distributions are really distributions of gnu/linux .

   steam tape,

  dat deck flex . 
  you can see a tire thread separation [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjmitzqznw8 ) . 
  apparently it 's more common on rethreads , which is why trucking companies usually do n't put them on the drive wheels of their fleet . 
  i do n't think it 's likely to happen on your tire ( not a rethread & the arched profile ) , just posted it because it ** is ** badass to see . 
  on your tire i 'd be afraid of a blowout after an unlucky puncture on places like the triangle tear in pic 2 over your ring finger . 
  so i would n't want to take it over blowout-wouldn ` t-kill-me speeds . 
   arched profile ?? 
  their cross-section is shaped like this : u , not this : | _ |, 
  there 's not a big slap roughly perpendicular to the sidewall trying to get away .

  they ... get in trouble with vehicles a lot . 
  generally speaking , are the bigger magnets used to keep a ` cleaner ' pig adhered to the pipe interior or for leak detection flux readings ? 
  [ pic ] ( http://www.physics.queensu.ca/~amg/images/detec.gif ) i found that lead to my question . 
  to be fair , figurative use of `` literally '' has literally exploded the last decade . 
  i think it would be fair to say `` to be fair '' will get the same figurative meaning separate from its literal one , literally taking away from its ( both literal and figurative ) linguistic value just as the figurative use of `` literally '' literally did . 
  e : it 's -  its,
