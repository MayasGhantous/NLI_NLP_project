  this might just be the gif that makes me really watch ad . 
  no , i have n't yet . 
  well fuck me sideways , change of plans . 
  is that . . chain rub on the sidewall ? 
   it 's badass as fuck, 
  it 's an ad . 
  i though it looked [ familiar ] ( http://imgur.com/a/a76kb ) but it 's just the second time i see it , not long after the first time . 
  i 'm known for my keen eye and sarcasm detection skills !, 
  the firing order is ** 1 -- 9 -- 13 -- 5 -- 3 -- 11 -- 15 -- 7 -- 4 -- 12 -- 16 -- 8 -- 2 -- 10 -- 14 -- 6 ** as per [ this ] ( http://www.sweet16.se/?page_id=239 ) page on the ignition system . 
  there 's a bonus video there too of him prototyping the sound of the firing order . 
  to help people wrap their heads around this , i ask them to imagine how stupid the average person can be - and to think about how half the world is dumber than that . 
  suck . 
  jag antar att op inte s\u00e5g det [ h\u00e4r ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/sweden/comments/3dxobs/ang%c3%a5ende_sweddit_och_rubbet/ ) eller det [ h\u00e4r ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/sweden/comments/3gc02m/det_har_g%c3%a5tt_%c3%b6verstyr/ ) .

  he 's doing it with his name and address in frame to get in contact with a dominatrix in his area . 
  if you did n't think so already after seeing this clip , let me tell you - he 's not discreet about what he wants , where he lives etc. 
  ask him directly , you can find very recent forum posts by him with contact info if you 're so inclined . 
  hell , he 'd surely meet up to talk if you 're in the area . 
  what 's holding you back ? 
  an air jack with a protective cover over the inlet ? 
  weight , size , materials and more pictures would help . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2p-tplqpjs ) **, 
  it 's quite the squeeze . 
  use [ livestreamer ] ( http://docs.livestreamer.io/ ) . 
  and [ svptube ] ( https://www.svp-team.com/w/index.php?title=svptube ) for youtube . 
  [ watch ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxvdx26n9zk ) 'em * cram * 10cc of fluid right into the bone . 
  that would hurt . 
  quite the bern . 
  his quick reply ( met with audience cheer ) into closing statement with great cheer was fantastic . 
  the low ( er ) pbs production quality was in hillary 's disadvantage as her closing statement applause just carried over into general applause . 
  awkward optics for her . 
  imo he had a great closing of the debate . 
  so i just read up on this , apparently it 's some ** 10 month + ** old internet disagreement between / u/addntn and some members of / r/crt . 
  this guy did n't like where it was headed so he said stuff about having contacted local authorities with license numbers , videos and other info on / r/crt members . 
  whether it 's true or not the guy obviously crossed the line and is being called out on his behaviour in every sub he 's started a thread about it ( / r/crt , / r/tenessee , / r/svriders , this sub ) . 
  in the process he wrote [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/calamariraceteam/comments/45frkw/if_you_are_in_tn_watch_out_for_this_bamf/czxn0r6 ) , which i agree is hilarious :, 
   you must have not realized who you were fucking with , the capacity to which they could fuck your world up , and their patience in waiting for you to be stupid enough to incriminate yourself . 
  i hope you survive this so that you can learn from your stupidity . 
  you might become a semi-intelligent adult if you can make it that far !, 
  since this goes back way further than i 'm prepared to read , [ here 's ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/calamariraceteam/comments/45frkw/if_you_are_in_tn_watch_out_for_this_bamf/czxm1ie ) today 's thread with first-hand drama . 
  if you just want to get to the copypasta :, 
   you must have not realized who you were fucking with , the capacity to which they could fuck your world up , and their patience in waiting for you to be stupid enough to incriminate yourself . 
  i hope you survive this so that you can learn from your stupidity . 
  you might become a semi-intelligent adult if you can make it that far !, 
  comments are going to start disappearing any second , get it while it 's hot and hilarous !, 
  threads made by the mod are available in / r/calamariraceteam , / r/bikesgonewild , / r/svriders and / r/nashville while supplies last . 
  i ai n't linking all those , sorry . 
  edit : [ snapshot ] ( http://archive.is/ayps2 ) of the first-hand drama . 
  ironically the user has deleted the one comment which will be forgotten last - the [ one ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fovs5jo.jpg ) comment that 's been screencapped and shared numerous times already . 
  yeah i think the complaint bit is addressed [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/calamariraceteam/comments/45frkw/if_you_are_in_tn_watch_out_for_this_bamf/czxs53w?context=3 ) before he continues to be called out on his overreaction . 
  you 're right , seems i mixed up some subs and * overreacted * . 
  edited my post . 
  the more i look at it , the better it gets . 
  must be art . 
  i 'm kind of surprised as it 's a quite funny meltdown but it 's up to you guys i guess . 
  if there was a different reason for removal you 'd be forthcoming about it , right ? 
  also , i think i might be talking to a bot . 
  e : no bot , mod taking time to explain !, 
  what i linked has screenshots of drama , which i thought would be easier to follow than the full drama that i linked in the comments . . but i see your point i guess . 
  i do n't think it 's worth it to repost tbh , being the long story it is . 
  [ like this ? 
  there it is . 
  [ indeed . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fcsvn-79ji ), 
  one brand name on the market seems to be [ quick-wedge \u00ae slot screwdrivers ] ( http://www.leevalley.com/us/wood/page.aspx?p=57073&amp;cat=1,43411,43417&amp;ap=1 ) . 
  searching for `` split screwdriver '' might yield more results . 
  neat little tool !, 
   yolk-assed bitch, 
  if you do n't diversify your meme investments and [ get burned ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdhnkv4ryum ) you had it coming imho . 
  yeah it 's no problem just let me know when/where you leave it and it will be fine . 
  if you have a lock leave the key too please . 
  hell strap all your valuables to the bike and leave them too . 
  no need to lock . 
  fuck the haters man , that thing 's got character . 
   rain eventually fucks up english electrics . 
  ftfy, 
  you know , that 's what she said . 
  i assume that 's with you wiring the stator yourself for the dc conversion ? 
  still a good deal , i 'd expect an r/r and battery to be about that much . 
  i think they screwed up their facebook embed . 
  the video is here . 
  mirror for those who ctrl + f, 
  fyi i clicked the blank section where the video should be , chose `` inspect element '' , found a facebook link at a `` src = '' - tag , opened that in a new tab , right clicked on the flash player , selected `` show video url '' from the flash player context menu . 
  you 're missing two bolts :p, 
  nice looking 426f , very clean . 
  do you ride without the front sprocket shield or was it only off when you took the pic ? 
  also , is that an in-line fuel filter ? 
  i want details too , the cylinder and head look aftermarket . 
  well that explains it not looking like a wrf block thanks . 
  what the fuck am i reading, 
  the drier tobacco smokes faster and hotter . 
  it gets crushed down in size faster too , leading to compact & heavy rolls . 
  you can re-humidify with a small piece of potato , some soaked paper , etc. 
  flair up brother !, 
  what headlight is that ? 
   and they were just rescued from a prison camp , that 's definitely provable .
