  i was hoping there was a new build i had n't seen yet , but alas !, 
  i 'm dying to see those pics !, 
  these are fantastic !, 
  what 's in it ? 
  could the main tube stiffnesss be improved by connecting each string truss one point further around the upper ring ? 
  this would place balanced static torque on the upper ring and perhaps reduce jitter in the eyepiece . 
  or am i counting the trusses wrong ? 
  just re-read my comment , i meant routing each string over a truss ( creating ( counter - ) clockwise torque along the main tube length axis ) to the next connection point around the upper ring . 
  i realize now this would push the trusses inwards , but prevents triangular clipping . 
  i figured 1/2 '' plywood would take the torsion along its surface plane pretty well , but you 're saying it does n't ? 
  because fucking idiots from sa , through srs , are trying to stop people from enjoying themselves in ways they do n't agree with . 
  so it 's being hidden , because that 's how it should be right ? 
  to this end their holier-than-though tone and hysterical outrage is nicely channeled to selected media outputs , pressuring reddit 's management from their parent entities .

  just like a tall tale that 's been around longer than anybody remembers , you 're not sure whether it 's real or not , factual or exaggerated .

  i place only the bottom container on my heat source ( filled with water of course ) and let that get as close as possible to boiling . 
  then i drop in the pre-filled filter funnel and screw on the top tightly , i turn down the heat so as to just keep a light boil going ( the lower the better ) . 
  the coffee will start brewing almost immediately without acidification due to excessive heat exposure . 
  all you can screw up with a moka pot is either exposing ground/brewed coffee to excessive heat , or tamping down the ground coffee in the funnel .

  or just experiment with your heat source and you can make a mediocre grind taste good . 
  you 're probably joking but i believe opium takes a good while to get into . . so he must 've been there a long time to do that . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.collectorsweekly.com/articles/journey-into-the-opium-underworld/ ) is a great read if you have the time . 
  you need a pretty coarse grind , espresso grind is too fine . 
  my coffee is ground at purchase and i specify moka pot . . obviously this requires finding a spot with a grinder selling beans . 
  otherwise look for a french press grind , i think they 're about the same setting . 
  if you only have espresso grind , screw on the top very firmly just before the water boils because you 'll need much pressure . 
  be careful not to burn the coffee . 
   if i open the lid liquid shoots everywhere . 
  then your heat is set too high , and you might be burning your coffee . 
  it should flow down the center column slowly , pulling light crema with it .

  the grass flowing in the wind makes it look like he gets a tailwind the moment he makes his last left just before touchdown . 
  i wonder if he calculated for a drop in lift , because his landing followed very shortly after this last turn !, 
  making good tasting coffee is the goal of the process . 
  how has it improved , apart from taste ? 
  to get better tasting coffee now is the time to get a freshly ground bean you like somewhere nearby . 
  later , when you find more than one place , you can compare roasting times and get even fresher coffee . 
  personally i pre-heat my milk in the microwave and see to it that it does n't boil . 
  i pour it into a metal double-walled ( insulated ) metal mug and add the coffee from my moka pot .

  sometimes whem i 'm bored i steer my mtb through town with only one fingertip pushing the handlebar on each side . 
  it 's like riding with no hands but still having some input . 
  then how would ` more ' motion not increase the gyroscopic forces the wheels exert on the hubs ? 
  it 's pretty simple ; more energy invested in a rotating plane means you need a bigger external force to alter that rotation . 
  i 'm familiar with the wiki and the [ research ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydte3aiuhbu ) at delf university . 
  i did n't say the wheels keep the bike upright , or defend every point dynam made . 
  in fact the source you quoted ( kooiman ) himself says '' ( ... ) has a strong influence in bicycle stability .
