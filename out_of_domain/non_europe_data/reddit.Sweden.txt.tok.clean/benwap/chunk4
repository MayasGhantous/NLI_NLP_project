  but so do gyro 's and trails '' [ here ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=ydte3aiuhbu#t=122s ) . 
  using an example where newton 's 1st plays a role , i illustrated how gyroscopic forces having `` nothing to do with '' turning dynamics is incorrect , as they exist and increase with speed . 
  newton 's 1st is not alone . 
  for the record , i do n't agree with everything in dynam 's comment , especially the last paragraph . 
  sant . 
  it 's an art indeed . 
  it was more common when it was in use in telecom/military industry , but i think that diminished at one point . 
  the only industry i know that uses it today is spacetravel , because of [ nasa 's ] ( http://ts.reddit.com/r/diy/comments/1547ud/how_to_splice_wire_to_nasa_standards/c7j7ljb ) excellent manual/sop 's .

  anything to do with [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/coffee/comments/1bcn6e/broke_my_beloved_mokapot_fixed_the_handle_with_a/ ) thread ? 
  i threw some tips in there should others have the same problems .

  2 vagely commercial ( not news ) links to / r/offbeat in an hour ? 
  please fuck off . 
  still delicious !, 
  i do n't really see ( a ) happening , as you 'd need a huge database of track patterns to do that . 
  then again there are services where smartphones can submit recorded soundbites for track recognition ... 
  but to automatically copy that section to a separate mp3 ? 
  for ( b ) you can either use [ musiccutter ] ( http://musicutter.szm.com/ ) to split at certain timecodes or use something like [ audacity ] ( http://audacity.sourceforge.net/ ) to visually select the sections in your tracks .

  helmets statistically only reduce head injuries from bike crashes because it discourages people from riding bikes .

   ( ... ) the last is the result of history because the last wars to be fought within scandinavia was denmark vs. sweden and norway vs. sweden . 
  sweden won both and thus became very unpopular , which can still be felt .

  i was like `` huh ? 
  what does he mean ? '', 
  and then suddenly the memory hit me . 
  i know what this is from and oh god i am seeing two drag queens dancing on stage again . 
  [ yes ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyquj3pghv4 ), 
  wow this is the quickest i have seen somebody run away form an ama . . this stuff was pretty mild , given ghb 's rep and all . 
  actually i think it means your knife is a bit bent as you cut a rounded piece of butter . 
  the curved side makes the butter slide . 
  this ended so much better than it could have . 
  which did n't help you then , but at least makes it a nice memory .

  have you tried experimenting with [ clip-on ferrites ] ( http://www.maplin.co.uk/clip-on-ferrites-32799 ) on the power/signal leads ? 
  not to me .

  indeed tarantino identifies much with black culture and the role it has played in the forming of his own character .

  i 'm most familiar with the dutch one , where in certain settings it 's not as taboo as in the states . 
  you 'd describe somebody as a ` neger ' to friends if it 's accurate ( complicated ) and there 's no need to be pc . 
  funny anecdote : to illustrate a related point in a conversation my somalian friend and i had with some german tourists , i asked the riddle `` what is white on top and black at the bottom ? '' . 
  my friend did n't know this joke yet , and as i answered `` society '' he burst out in hysterical laughter and the germans were a bit stunned . 
  good times . 
  you mean [ old ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/new_sweden#permanent_settlements ) stockholm ?

  you mean the narrow wheelbase . 
  the long wheelbase acts against the truck flipping head over heels , although that is unlikely to happen anyway . 
  ah-ha , i thought you meant your rolling fortress would suffer from a high point of gravity .

  perhaps searching for `` creating stencil from image '' will help you out . 
  i for one think creative out-pioneered there apple in tactical litigation . 
  this is just me making a remark on how its funny to read about somebody being pissed at apple * getting * sued , not the now much more common opposite . 
  reminds me of a documentary on a hollywood script-writer `` dr. hollywood '' who became the a-list go-to guy for pep . 
  he claimed ( on hidden camera , under influence ) to have `` made adderal fashionable again '' .

  or holland , for that matter . 
  imagine a piece of stock rotating at a certain speed . 
  a burr ( sort of like a cutting disc with only one teeth ) rotates at the same speed , but in the opposite direction . 
  if these were to make contact , the burr would hit the stock at the same place every time right ? 
  they touch , make an opposite rotation each , touch again , etc. . . 
  now add 5 more cutting teeth to the rotating burr , and you 're consistently wearing out 6 parts of the stock at the same time !, 
  in my experience , mental health is completely optional in amsterdam .

  people do n't bat an eye if you 're walking down the street having tics/talking/shouting to yourself . 
  like i said , mental health is totally voluntary and optional here . 
  now * there 's * a stash . 
  i do n't know many ways to make people disagree faster than talking about the jewish/palestine occupation of the west bank/israel . 
  get out of here with your damn pragmatism and logic !!,
