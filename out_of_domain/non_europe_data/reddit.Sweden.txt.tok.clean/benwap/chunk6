  dat instantly perfect and updating toc . 
  well . . what 's on the menu ? 
  you were just looking at these because you live in amsterdam and saw the til , were n't you ? 
  it feels like you 're me but rationally speaking it 's not that weird we both were curious about koan float . 
  ### whoooooohh, 
  ( ... ) with the eyebrows that just wo n't stop . 
  - saul , breaking bad . 
  proper gabber , focused on the kicks and bassdrums . 
  no melodic bs that reminds me of hardstyle . 
  see [ dj promo & x-ess - vicious circle ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69a5aw_gt2g ) ( 1999 ) . 
  ... let 's not add fire to the equation , shall we ? 
  how about a good little bit of google , see if any reviews of the monitor mention any protective film ? 
  or maybe one would even email customer support before ** holding a bloodly lighter against your screen ** ? 
  man this is all very funny . 
  `` come , sniffles '', 
  * is disappointed not even the cat is her friend *, 
  must be unwashed then . . so crystalline looking . 
  the only thing a lighter ever dunn ' fixed proper is a frayed shoelace . 
  what would magnetism have to do with this ? 
  the corrosion ? 
  forcey fun times !, 
  [ sheeiiiitttt ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1dnqkguezo ), 
  ... i 'm not in the closet . 
  and who was phone ? 
  i am still just a rat in a cage . 
  why does the second pic remind me of bamboo ? 
  there 's something about the leaf colour . 
  nice room , beautiful monster !, 
  question : in the flower room , how do you prevent the bottom roots from drowning in stagnant water in the white trays ? 
  i myself had so much fun the last war , when i earned my big red badge of svea honour !, 
  that 's one way to steal cable . . 
  for a short while . 
  emergency firewood ? 
  so you can stick around the pc during a power outage and wait for the power to come back on . 
  / r/morbidpalletreality,

  fuck everything about fire , just monitor it . 
  that 's feng shui of electronics right there . 
  you can have your cake ,, 
  and eat it too !, 
  why 's that ? 
  well , did you give up your epaulets ? 
  that 's coffee . 
  downvoted . 
  i roll my own and there are often stems in my tobacco . 
  no problem . 
  left the house , see pm . 
  nah that 's korsakoff in september . 
  very east coast . 
  very subjective what is desired in a shop . . a living room , a modern shop with tv 's 'n stuff , shops playing a certain music or speaking a certain language . . have your pick !, 
  just ask a friendly/stoned looking coffeeshop employee when you know * what * to ask . 
  for example freeworld played dnb all night when i was there . 
  you better not be calling finnyboy665 out after this mess :, 
   ( ... ) data is normally stored/measured in m/g bytes . 
  so thats m/g = mega/giga = 0,1 = 1/10ths of bytes ? 
  i can only tell you that royal tobacco in utrechtsestraat still has * one * . 
  send me a pm when you come over i 'll show you around . 
  since they do n't serve alcohol in coffeeshops anymore there 's real value in knowing places were you 're allowed to light up and have a beer/shot too . 
  like i said , pm me , 
  sweet !, 
  give me a shout if you need tips . 
  nope . 
  it has been banned in the border regions ( as they suffered most from drugtourists ) , but is untenable . 
  amsterdam will never agree or cooperate to this backwards bullshit , there are too many criminals eager to take over the streets by force . 
  well it 's clear which one is male and which one is female ... 
  see that 's why i prefaced it with `` all i can say . . '' , pretty much a shot in the dark . 
  i 've been looking around but ca n't find them online . 
  if you had a friend here it 'd be done in the mail pretty quick . 
  [ ... ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/geekporn/comments/1ewlb4/remember_that_guy_interning_at_google_these_are/ca4lcgd ), 
  3 grams for $ 20 are pretty decent deals in amsterdam . . thats $ 25,84 . 
  it 's usually around $ 6,45 wholesale ( 1kg + ) . 
  killjoy . 
  nope , would n't really go there . 
  meh . . ambience , crowd , music , weed , staff , etc all point to no . 
  i have a few shops i like to get weed , a few shops i like to sit in the sun , a few shops i meet people at , a few shops for bigger groups , etc. . 
  i have n't been in a bulldog for years . 
  nothing has changed . 
  again , actual change has only occurred in some cities along the german/belgian border , not in * any * of the major cities . 
  this new approach is already backfiring in these `` pilot cities '' along the borders . 
  that 's like , 15 kids standing in a row !, 
  sure they might , to make sure you 're over 18 . 
  they 'll see you are from abroad and might ask if you had a good trip . 
  that 's it . 
  there is no ` new law ' , only pilot cities along the border . 
  there is no discrimination based on nationality going on in the coffeeshops in the big cities , period !, 
  most owners refuse on moral grounds alone , there 's been a europe-level trial against this on the base that it is illegal racism , which many people believe . 
  buy it and leave straight away , no problem either . 
  mmm . '', 
  dispn . . what ? 
  we do n't have dispensaries per se as coffeeshops have been around longer than government supported medical applications of cannabis as far as i know . 
  nowadays there is one big greenhouse ( bedrocan ) growing exactly 22 % thc grass for distribution by dutch government/bedrocan directly to health care patients . 
  this is a monopoly . 
  i guess the patients get it in the mail , or pick it up at the pharmacy ... and smoke it in the coffeeshop , 
  that 's not a trivial matter . 
  why not five of 'em on a blimp ?
