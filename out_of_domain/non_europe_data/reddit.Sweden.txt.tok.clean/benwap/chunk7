  i ca n't look it up now but the us government did exactly this , there 's video of it taking off and tearing itself apart in under 2 minutes . 
  my jaw dropped the moment i saw that slide-out door . 
  very nice !, 
  how are the humidity levels in the room ? 
  i ask because ac air can be notoriously dry . 
  if you use res , hover over my username and hit `` send message '' . 
  otherwise click on my username and do the same under the reddit gold advert text . 
  that 's it , yeah . 
  i 'd feel sorry for your dog . 
  but i guess different people have different views on how to treat dogs . 
  in my view even if those dogs got in a conflict the `` owner 's '' dog would have the upper hand , unless it 's been completely alienated from dogs its whole life . 
  this approach in my view ( again , subjective stuff ) will never train her to show the confidence needed to ward off aggressive behavior by strays/non strays in the first place . 
  it sha n't be mentioned . 
  * but it loads on mobile devic ... * ** slap !, 
  html5 motherfucker embrace the future, 
  please keep it awesome , and be mindful of what / r / 's you post it in . 
  this is [ / r/funny ] ( / r/funny ) and depreciated . 
  i 've seen a user actually pick up the mouse and rub its bottom with his hand with a puzzled look . 
  * after * i explained the concept of right and left mouse buttons and moving the cursor . 
  and no , this man was n't over 55 . 
  he did drink , though . 
  this is like really dirty and rough industrial cableporn . 
  cheers !, 
  for everybody reading this feeling bummed , sorry . 
  it has to do with influx of new members , submission quality , etc. . . 
  hang out on reddit ( not the default / r / 's ) and you 'll be there before you know it . 
  attitude 10/10 - would survive again . 
  also , adrenaline makes you loopy although i do n't know how long she had that injury . 
  these people did some ` comparative ' test that rustled / r/coffee 's jimmies real good a while ago . 
  to be hones it was a bit antagonizing and i 'm not even a barista . 
  haha i know you 're kidding but this spectrum ( inform/isolate or let experience ) applies to raising kids too . 
  of course if you overdraw the argument either way ( keep your kids in a padded room !, 
  sterilize all the things ! ), 
  the discussion dies . 
  thank you . 
  my dad has a husky/german shepard hybrid ( so 1/4 wolf , 3/4 german shepard ) that is huge . 
  he walks it around town without a leash . 
  traffic , children , other dogs and animals are all challenges separately trained for . 
  i think he can only because they 've been to doggy school together since before his castration and my dad has always been consistent with the cane and the treats . 
  i 've seen that beast sit dead still in front of a red light in the middle of town , while some untrained rat-sized mut on a leash was literally climbing all over him . 
  he could have flicked the little thing off without any effort but remained still while its owner talked about how dogs need a leash in town . 
  no they do n't , they need proper training . 
  edit : how do you think it comes across to an unleashed dog when a human and a leashed dog are making contact , together moving towards the curious dog ? 
  i started cringing from the get-go , if you want them to play nice let them !, 
  and let them be dogs !, 
  i looked for it but could n't find it . 
  trust me it was godawful , worse than bakermat 's poor-ass excuse for house music . 
  come to think of it , she seems to be in a very odd looking kitchen . 
  them darn jewish physics are at it again !, 
  [ n2 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nitrogen_gas#properties ) = never alone, 
  that 's a dickbutt . 
  shiiiieet i was * way * too high . 
  i fucked up !, 
  hardcore will never die !, 
  care to share some background details ? 
  lol, 
  like posting a pic of good food without a warning , a dick move to all people with a mouth . 
  nope , however the risk you run as a rape victim to be reminded of your experience is a burden only the victim can carry . 
  we ca n't go out of our way everywhere to prevent these reminders . 
  dude it 's almost starting again i have n't thought about that in 3 days ohmygod, 
  e : fuck it 's in august not july aaaargh rage, 
  i 'm pretty sure my comment was too , 
  to me the basis of op 's submission is how tickling ( a usually innocent act ) is similar to rape . 
  it 's not about making light of rape , but about how tickling is n't as innocent as it seems . 
  it 's basis is that tickling is a forceful act leading to involuntary pleasure , kind of how rape is . 
  * could n't resist *, 
  we got a winner . 
  sweet shop right ? 
  just the new owners that are fucking it up royally real fast . 
  further west . . 
  what to one is a terrible comparison to ones experience is a hearty laugh to another . 
  ` tis a cruel world , we must all learn endure it . 
  for the last time , there is only so far we can go in preventing * possible * adverse reactions in a * small * group of people . 
  actually , that was a joke . 
  in poor taste i 'm sure , but still a joke stemming from my black humour . 
  see the '' * could n't resist * '' standing below . . 
  you know how many rape victims told their attacker to get out ?!, 
  please put a trigger warning on that comment out of respect for all rape ever . 
  `` it of spites to me but ( ... ) '', 
  nope all hell 's loose as usual in amsterdam . 
  physics 101 . 
  there is no animosity at growth . 
  * sniff *, 
  truth burns, 
  `` what the fuck do you want of me ? '', 
  `` i want the ** thruth ** !, 
  * did * you or * did you not * order the code brown ? 
  of course !, 
  but as soon as you 're done with pihkal you 'll know about tihkal . 
  yes . 
  i too carry trauma i 'm reminded of weekly in regular working day life . 
  i do n't blame my benevolent peers for their role in that , as firstly most are unaware of it and secondly my trauma is my responsibility to cope with . 
  failing to do so i remove myself from a situation instead of blaming it . 
  also , no i 'm also an ass at times . 
  everybody is . 
  sometimes it 's intended , sometimes it 's not . 
  it 's funny because it * ca n't be proven not to be * true , and then becomes a horrible statement that is evil and ca n't be argued . 
  this is funny because actually being serious in that metaphor is such extreme incorrectness and can shock people who had n't imagined that . 
  think [ / r/imgoingtohellforthis ] ( / r/imgoingtohellforthis ) - like stuff . 
  naturally , having explained it makes it seem less funny .
