  so there 's that . 
  british for power socket . 
  or whatever it is it 's actually called ? 
  but [ can ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/mangonewild/comments/1cz6i2/was_dared_to_post_this_here_figured_why_not/ ) he actually ? 
  * so sorry *,

  really ? 
  looks more like he tied his foreskin up and let the urine go . 
  [ oh ] ( http://pigroll.com/img/say_that_to_my_face_fucker.jpg ), 
  good points all around . 
  next time , no flash , on a pile of rocks with the timer on . 
  if you run out of tobacco , just smoke that . 
  i might . 
  how are his post-processing chances compared to not using a flash ?

  a very good question !, 
  cable lacing is used on some of the most sophisticated scientific instruments made : mars rovers . 
  it 's dedication when your stunt is more important than your engine .

  how does that video relate to theft ? 
  * to avoid being held accountable for the crash by the law . 
  * to stow the bike for later retrieval ? 
  knock , knock . 
  more of a fiddler than a twiddler of the knobs , very impressive and entertaining . 
  i 'd eat that so bad . 
  maybe throw in a red pepper 20min before end of cooking for some colour . 
  or do you accept that people want to have a bloody park , and prevent a small protest from escalating ? 
  you speak as if you believe a dictatorship is the only option in turkey and a matter of time . 
  is this true ?

  pretty rare as the reverse is usually a low gear ( `` of low gearing ? '', 
  please correct ) . 
  otherwise , continue as if it is a forward gear and keep your speed down .

  looks kind have fixed right now . 
  this shit right here . 
  i have n't even opened the link yet but titles like these is why i 'm subbed to this small sub . 
  e : op truly delivers . 
  as smokers as a % of world population drops , does n't this day become less and less relevant ? 
  what the fuck is awesome about this shit ? 
  i 'm quite happy about us suffering no central european/austrian water levels in holland right now .

  how long did the process take him , especially the a/b-extraction ? 
  [ / r/cringe ] ( / r/cringe ) all the way , holy shit . 
  perhaps a moka express would be a nice addition ? 
  then you 'd cover the more bitter and concentrated side of the palate too , for cheap !, 
  i mean you * do * have the grinder already ... 
  i was going for, 
  getting real tired of your ** shit ** , sweden . 
  i ca n't tell you how a moka express compares to the aeropress as i 've never tasted the latter . 
  i 've been told an aeropress produces mild , soft and velvety coffee but i could be wrong . 
  i 'd use concentrated/bitter/punch in the face to describe a * properly * brewed cup of moka express . 
  many people burn the coffee by not pre-heating the water or simply turning up the heat too far . 
  also , this might be a bit pedantic but keep in mind an espresso is only an espresso when brewed under certain conditions . 
  i do n't think an aeropress can recreate those . 
  nice vintage !, 
  slap some [ platform ] ( http://www.planetbmx.com/shop/images/uploads/new_items_ctdotcom_078.jpg ) pedals on there if you feel like riding hard , they 're worth it over plastic ones !, 
  nope , there 's no brand i know i 'd recommend off the cuff . 
  i suggest spending $ 50 ( or 50usd in your currency ) , balance weight and build quality . 
  so 400g pedals in b quality is preferable to a 900g set in a quality . 
  other things to look for are, 
  * can i replace the pins myself , or are they single-use ? 
  * how easy are the bearings to service ( grease/clean ) ? 
  * can i replace the bearing shells when they wear out , or are they integral in the pedal body/pedal spindle ? 
  * are these pedals anodized or painted ? 
  will they rust ? 
  * are they efficiently machined , i.e. 
  as light as possible for their structural strength ? 
  etc. . . 
  just making sure you saw my comment after the edit . 
  to show their timeless suffering in that terrible weather . 
  are you one of them srs ` ers or something ?

  to a swede , that poor excuse of an exercise is so far removed from nordic cross-country skiing it irks me they 're even calling it that . 
  what a gyp . 
  me and my high hopes ... 
   can anyone help me reply ? 
  sure , i just need to figure out how to quote . 
  true , i do n't call them out on it . 
  glad to see 'em moving . 
  dude , this is where you pay . 
  go back to [ / r/vxjunkies ] ( / r/vxjunkies ) and take it from there . 
  looking good , right ? 
  one gets a pretty good impression of northern swedish car culture in the film `` j\u00e4garna '' . 
  i believe it acts as a slide-on washer between a screw and the wood/stone surface it 's in , to prevent the screw head from breaking into the softer surface . 
  my head is full of fuck . 
  took the fucks right out of my h34d , y0 !,
