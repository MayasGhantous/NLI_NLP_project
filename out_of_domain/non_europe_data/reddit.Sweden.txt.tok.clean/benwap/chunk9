  reminds me on how a screenwriter admitted on / r/ama to writing scripts to irk people in the know . 
  [ mmm . 
  somebody i know who rides a lot is a strong advocate of feathering the clutch and rear brake for slow maneuvering . 
  he 'll bug anybody taking more than two steps if he feels like it . 
  worst thing is , he 's the most senior rider so we 're basically left to take the shit we deserve , 
  what is your experience using a handheld drill ? 
  what you described would probably take considerable concentration from my part . 
  been done . 
  google ` shot glass grow thread ', 
  that 's the one . 
  i was just off to bed as i wrote that comment . 
  it 's a art . . 
  story 's in . 
  and throw a slice of lemon in your weissbier , 
  like a. ... hitless ? 
  as a person , i 'm full of fuck and do n't get it at the same time . 
  help ? 
   * do n't be so hitlish , let him join the table !,

  like how paris hilton was a hitless artist . 
  i would buy that off you if you are n't too interested in keeping it . 
  i collect lighters . 
  are you in holland ? 
  sounds like you had a voltage surge in your neighbourhood . 
  there were blackouts in parts of holland the last days . 
  offer still stands , i 'd love to add it to my collection .

  i 'm excited you 're considering returning this to it 's home country !, 
  looking forward to hearing from you . 
  is that unlit led a dedicated monday indicator ? 
  people in the 70 's knew what was up . . 
  what 's the blue tube at his front brake for ? 
  very informative , thanks !, 
  it looks like * all * the skiers are carried by one boat , no ? 
  good stuff . 
  no i mean all must be more than most , right ? 
  this . . is . . 
  ** glorious !, 
  ca n't tell if this is sarcasm ... 
  i could n't tell if / u/mistertactful was reminiscing or sarcastically stating he wishes he had the cash for them . 
  i would never deny the value in/satisfaction from using quality tools .

  eat a car with toast . 
  as far as i know they add flux ( lime and other stuff ) that together with oxygen and high temperature separates impurities from the iron . 
  these impurities float to the top of the furnace and are drained as waste . 
  next up : a subreddit that lists subreddits where you can post subs you think should have more attention . 
  is the first pic taken at eye level when seated ? 
  i 'm sorry , what ? 
  sharing his opinion of uk being politically correct ( moreso than the nordics ) equals defending the writing of racial abuse in excrement ? 
  it 's interesting how you are being politically correct in your sarcastic denouncement of their complaint against political correctness . 
  do n't you realise that attacking somebody just for their opinion on a controversial political topic is the core of being politically correct ? 
  see bottle opener . 
   oh and by the way , criticising a persons opinion is now ` political correctness ' ? 
  critique involves arguments , based on fact or emotion . 
  this pulp, 
   you ca n't even write racial abuse in excrement on someone 's car without the politically correct brigade jumping down your throat , nowadays . 
  involves neither . 
  i 'm not going to bother explaining how equating cach-e to a shit-smearer for his tolerance levels on political correctness relates to you being politically correct . 
  i was convinced you were wrong and wanted to make a point showing [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:lives_saved_by_safety_belts_and_air_bags,_nhtsa,_dot.svg ) . 
  but it did n't feel so strong . 
  then i was going for [ this ] ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16210197 ) , turns out airbag effect drops significantly above 25mph . 
  o-okay ...

  just saying . 
  you 'll still have an additional 2,4 ghz network . 
  maybe research if these nano usb adapters do n't have lower performance than full-size ones , but they 're less likely to break in bed . 
  wow . 
  do you know over how long those temp files accumulated ? 
  also , what 's in them , specifically ? 
  i 'm so sorry but * their * .

  just . . adding screws ? 
  not to hold a piece of inner tube as a patch , what we 're seeing here ? 
  with the sticker . 
  use it as you would use tape to remove cat hairs from clothing . 
  it 's * mostly * available when you need to remove this kind of glue . 
  that 's right !, 
  it 's called a chain punch . 
  bring the slowcooker to an electrician , it 's a very simple device electronically speaking . 
  worst case , one of your heating elements needs to be replaced . 
  give it another lease on life !, 
  the friction takes its toll . 
  is it actually dead if its nerves still respond to appropriate impulses ? 
  i 'd say it 's just very close , 
  it looks like a nordic medieval work .
