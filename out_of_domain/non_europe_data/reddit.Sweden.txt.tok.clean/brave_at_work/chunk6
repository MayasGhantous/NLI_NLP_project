   ... i have librarians in my ** family ** ... 
  implying it 's extra funny to people who are librarians/know librarians . 
   wait why ? 
  he 's wondering why it 's extra funny to them , but did n't specify exactly what he 's questioning . 
   because some libraries do n't require you to kill your family to work there nowadays . 
  he took his `` non-specific '' question and interpreted it jokingly as `` why are you still alive if you have librarians in your family when everyone knows that the last step in becoming a librarian is to kill your family '' which is a regular movie trope that assassins and the likes go through . 
  i 'm not trying to undermine your problems ** at all ** but why could n't you lean on one of your 5-6 close friends ? 
  i would kill to have 5-6 close friends ... 
  i think it depends ** a lot ** on which subreddits you visit . 
  i for one welcome every critique on my comments because how else would you learn that it 's wrong ? 
  there 's also a big difference in responding with `` your * , jesus how can you morons be so moronic ? '', 
  and `` your * , because it 's about possession and not something you are '' . 
  perfect comment . 
  it 's not a common occurrence, 
  thank you !, 
  now it wo n't look like i 'm giving everyone the finger when correcting my glasses . 
  are we stupid to not come up with this ourselves ? 
  this is exactly what i do . 
  i always start the game with voice_enable 1 and about 50 % of the time i will also end with voice_enable 1 . 
  a fun thing to do after you muted or voice_enable 0 is to enable it for the last round , usually the guy has kept going the whole game without a stop even if you never responded to anything . 
  [ triggad ] ( / intensifies ), 
  i 'm actually quite worried when so many people can justify cheating and think it 's `` a part of the game '' so much that they blame the company responsible for keeping their product fair . 
  truly , truly delusional . 
  tracer , for me , is a very situational pick and has saved ** a lot ** of games for me when i switch to her . 
  i never start a match with her because i feel like she has a surprise factor worth `` hiding '' for when my team is stuck or we really need a backline pick to be able to push . 
  take her for what she is : an annoyance that can kill you if you 're not on your toes . 
  no other character has such a 1vx potential as her because she is so mobile and it 's all about the * active * outplay . 
  tl ; dr : are you losing ? 
  no tracer on team ? 
  go for it !, 
  this is most likely it . 
  `` hmpf , i work in entertainment i do n't watch it , that 's for the sheeple '', 
  but not as cool !, 
  you 're truly a master if you can land consistent bhops with the spacebar . 
  why you would want to become a master of bhopping with space when scroll wheel is so much easier is another thing to question . 
  you get the following turns to follow up instead . 
  truly was, 
  cho ` gal is only turn played . 
  like what ? 
  i have similar problems as severe as yours and my solution is to wipe around the ear ( not in the canal ) with regular toilet paper , which helps a bit but i 've just learnt to live with the constant stabbing pain . 
  i can literally have just as much wax back after one day as after a week , my ears are my enemy . 
  lick clean you mean, 
  cheating in a single-player mode is fine because there 's no other people involved except yourself . 
  if you cheat in a multiplayer game then you can seriously go fuck yourself , or well , if you cheat in any way by getting advantage over others you can go fuck yourself . 
  cheating is thinking your enjoyment and time is more valuable than everyone else 's , which is what a selfish cunt thinks . 
  i 'm sorry for the harsh language but i truly hate cheaters . 
  it happens so much that i 've started to add things like '' ( of course what i 'm saying only applies to legal things ) '' to my comments because otherwise you get someone stating things that should be obvious but obviously are n't to them . 
  i got both bedouin and nomad from loot boxes and i do n't even play genji :( it 's a hard skin life . 
  quicktip : use a spoon/anything and press under the lid to get air into it and then it will come off with a breeze . 
  how are you any different than the assholes mentioned in this thread with this comment ? 
  you just said it is fun to tease people who are lonely to the point where they become angered . 
  i read this and am thankful for your information . 
  he was before his time , raging on the internet and stuff . 
  what are some good ones for eu ? 
  what, 
  ot : did they change the timings for movement + awp ? 
  i 've been whiffing shots like this a lot these past couple of days , shots that i usually do n't whiff . 
  ah , i c . when i want to play `` comp '' but do n't feel like mm i play retake servers . 
  got ta grind those pages, 
  what subreddits do you visit where this happens ? 
  i frequent reddit a lot and sure i 've seen some pro-weed comments but nothing to the extreme you 're describing . 
  insanely average ace ... 
  i became totally stressed out watching that, 
  he . . hey . 
  can i join ? 
  this is what people who constantly mention esea , faceit and cevo forget . 
  those services has become for the `` better players '' and is very unfriendly towards new people . 
  being global + should n't be a requirement for enjoying the game as it 's supposed to be played , 5v5 . 
  surely the true competitors want to refuse it , but that would most likely cause more problems for them personally with the corrupt people . 
  would you rather be hated by just people following rules or by people who gives no fucks about rules ? 
  everything in which a company , person or a group gets viewed more positive is a pr move then . 
  there is such a thing as common sense and healthy changes without everything having an ulterior motive . 
  my cat is an absolute idiot when it comes to understanding humans and their legs . 
  she gets kicked in the head at least once a week . 
  it is very popular at least in lem-global on eu . 
  are you the authority on points ?!, 
  could you explain the basics to me , because i usually do n't get it . 
  been waiting for that '' ... take an interest ... '' for a while now , my pessimism is reaching new heights each day . 
  i 'm actually scared nowadays because i know i used to be an awesome/fun person to be around , but i 'm afraid those days are gone because of bad decisions and a long period of depression/passivity . 
  you 're literally saying `` there 's no point in playing '' . 
  valve has the system set up ( it might not be the best but it 's what 's available ) and you play it . 
  you do n't `` grind '' to reach global , you play and if you 're good enough you reach global . 
  it 's not your main account if you do n't play on it enough to show your true rank . 
  i went down from global to le when overwatch released due to inactivity . 
  and about 30 games later i 'm back to supreme , probably global soon and i would guess ( without checking , so memory ) that about 60 % have been wins . 
  people do n't understand that it 's standard to refer to the team you 're rooting for as `` we '' , because as a fan you 're emotionally invested and actually care if they win or lose . 
  do n't shit on other people because you do n't care enough about an org to not root for another one next week . 
  if you 're a club hopper and refer to your newest interest as `` we '' then i agree , that is weird . 
  5 is the answer . 
  i noticed very weird changes in myself straight away , like the day after i first started taking the pills . 
  quit completely after 3-4 days because it enhanced my ( then ) mild depression to an extreme . 
  i 've been having some success with acnatac , which is apparently accutane but in gel form . 
  would you though ? 
  if there 's a procedure available to you for free without any risk that will shorten you by 3 inches , can you with a guilt-free conscience tell us you would do it . 
  i 'm average height , maybe a bit taller than average , but i would gladly accept a few more inches in height . 
  i do n't see a downside to being tall unless you reach ludicrous heights which imo is when you hit your head on a standard door frame . 
  i 've heard my short friends talk about how it sucks to be short . 
  i feel you guys ' pain , hopefully you surround yourself with people who could n't give two shits about heights ( which really should be 100 % of all people , but the world is a shitty place and if people can discriminate against color of skin then they can discriminate against heights ) . 
  and that is wrong . 
  pretty stupid to change what a term means because some people have misunderstood its meaning ; but i guess that is how language evolves .
