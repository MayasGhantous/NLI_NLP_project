  scenario :, 
  your teammate just died taking a duel mid doors dust2 and he calls `` low , low , low ! '' . 
  do you expect having to land several shots or should 1 be enough and if you throw a he nade , do you expect him to insta die if it lands close to him ? 
  [ take a look at this dmg chart and you can see how many ways there are to damage < 39 . 
  so your point is he ca n't possibly be having problems with mental health , leaving the house , being motivated and going to the gym because he is doing that one thing ? 
  i agree that it 's a stupid `` tradition '' and i never personally phrase my sentences as `` we '' when talking about the teams i root for ( even the hockey team i 've followed since birth and get huge enjoyment from following ) , because as you i feel that it is weird . 
  but i do n't understand the comments `` hurr durr you 're not part of the team '' when it 's a perfectly fine way to show what team you root for when talking and that you 're invested in them . 
  if you know everything about fnatic and follow everything they do of course you get enjoyment when they win : `` fuck yeah we won ! '', 
  or `` fuck yeah fnatic won ! '', 
  tells two different stories , and you want to interpret the first as `` i 'm a part of the team and i won ! '', 
  instead of `` the team i 'm rooting for won ! '' . 
  the `` fuck yeah fnatic won ! '', 
  does n't emphasize that their opponents did n't matter for you to root for them , which is quite clear in the `` we '' - form . 
  you do n't think the `` we '' - ers are aware that they 're not ** really ** a part of the team ? 
  ( excluding hooligans , because mental health is not the topic ) . 
  and even if they truly believe they 're a part of the team , i do n't see how it would matter ; unless you really want people to stop feeling communal for no reason other than you think it 's weird and stupid . 
  you got ** me ** all wrong friend !, 
  i was agreeing with you that he was being silly with his joke . 
  i play it for that one game where everyone plays as a team with good communication : and then it 's over within 10 minutes because we 16-0 the other team . 
  have n't had an even game in quite some time , when the result is 15-15 , 16-14 etc it 's usually because people start trolling and lose several rounds for no reason other than lulz . 
  you 're an online sociopath then . 
  why do you think your time online in a game is worth more than everyone else in that game ? 
  so are you . 
  so am i. 
  so if my greatest pleasure in life is to grief in csgo i should just continue doing it without any reflections because `` hey , i 'm having fun , fuck playing the game by the rules and fuck everyone else wanting competitive games , i come first ! '' . 
  if there existed a system which could instantly detect rule-breaking ( cheating , griefing etc. ), 
  and ban that player , you would be against that with what you 're saying because that would take away your fun . 
   a person with a psychopathic personality whose behavior is antisocial , often criminal , and who lacks a sense of moral responsibility or social conscience . 
  now , i do n't really believe you/the other commenters are sociopaths in regular life but people who have a view that cheating is fine probably does n't see interactions online as interactions with people and therefore their `` social conscience '' is n't active . 
  it 's the problem with anonymity . 
  if you 're playing `` insert any regular sport '' there 's no way in hell you would prioritise your fun over everyone elses because there 's a threat of exclusion if you do . 
  instead of reading what i 'm writing and trying to understand it you look at the small part which can be criticized , very constructive of you . 
  i did n't even want to write anything about sociopathy , and my first comment about it was more of a joke . 
  but it 's no lie that cheaters/griefers behavior online is sociopathic/narcissistic , and the easiest way to have a discussion about such matters is to look at definitions of the stuff you 're talking about . 
  and how do you know i 'm not an educated psychiatrist ? 
  sure you can look at my history and probably deduce that i 'm not , but if you ca n't comment on the content of a comment , do n't comment at all . 
  why should n't everyone with an interest in , for example psychology , be able to talk about it ? 
  and the topic at hand is n't the psychology part , it 's the fact that people think it 's fine to only care about your own fun when you 're truly an asshole if you do that . 
  and again , if you interpret that as `` lol pls y shud i hav to care if others hav fun '' you 're missing the whole point of what 's being said : you should n't have to actively try for others to have fun playing with you . 
  because there 's no trust in vac . 
  when there 's such a high chance that a suspicious player is actually cheating then of course you jump to conclusions faster than if you actually believed in the anti-cheat protection . 
  also , people have some kind of illusionary belief that pro players are the only ones who are competent enough to have great game sense together with great aim , which leads to false reports when they get outplayed . 
  `` once a cheater always a cheater '' is true and with what you 've written it 's very much true in your case . 
  you 've never cheated in cs , congrats you should get a medal for not looking up cheats . 
  if someone handed you a cheat and said `` this is 100 % undetectable '' you would accept the cheat , maybe not use it straight away but you would take it just to have it . 
   let me tell you my experience , it 's fun . 
  really fun . 
  why would something you find to be very fun not be fun anymore ? 
  sure you can say `` i 've matured and i was just a kid before '' but the fact is that you were having the time of your life cheating . 
  maybe you wo n't cheat today or tomorrow , but some day in the future if you 're presented with a chance to cheat you probably will . 
  your scale for mental issues might be a bit skewed , because in my mind it 's very fucked up to ruin things for other people for your own pleasure . 
  surely you understand how you wasted the time of everyone you encountered while cheating ? 
   most people consider cs to just be a game and nothing more so they would n't want to sign up for any other crap - if they were more serious , they would have esea . 
  so , you 're saying they should sign up for something more intrusive if they want to play more seriously ? 
  hmm ... 
  a starfish is a creature that just lies there on the bottom of the ocean, 
  man i was like `` maybe i got one thing going for me '' ... 
  y u hef to be mad, 
  fun fact : the hyenas was originally going to be voiced by tommy chong, 
  it 's only dangerous because people always go to the extreme situation instead of one of the 99 % other situations . 
  it 's like assuming the extreme has become the norm ... 
  you just proved my point . 
  you assumed i was in some way talking in extremes when i clearly was n't . 
   `` i do this because of my faith . '', 
    that 's a dangerous sentence . 
  you need some more qualifiers if you 're going to declare it fine . 
  try and read that again but instead of thinking `` surely he must be talking about the worst of the worst '' try to have something that the other 99 % of religious people do because of their religion that is n't harmful . 
  i 'm saying this as someone who hates religion because i love knowledge , and religion stands directly in the way of knowledge . 
  hint : op 's comment was about not imposing your own religious beliefs on others . 
  it is indeed horrible . 
  yeah but why should valve 's sole reason to do something be money ? 
  surely good publicity and standings with their most faithful fans outweighs some monetary gain . 
  i guess i forgot something in my comment ... 
  he 's saying it 's a long time and ca n't wait . 
  personally i hope they extend his ban on the day it ends . 
  yes . 
  even if he only cheated once he is scum . 
  it 's hilarious how people do n't understand that it 's extremely taxing to do anything at a top level , or even to do anything which requires you to think a little bit for a long period . 
  people cruising on auto-mode through their days have no idea ... 
  i 'm freezing daily since i upgraded my computer a couple months ago , my old one was functioning as an extra heater . 
  even with the same case , larger and faster stuff it just does n't create enough heat anymore for some reason ( better hardware power saving is my guess since i 've tried deactivating everything concerning power saving in bios and os ) . 
  depression causes assholitis , it is a known fact . 
  it 's common to develop an `` everyone is against me '' mentality , so imagine if everyone was against you , you genuinely thought so , what is your response to people trying to fuck your shit up ? 
  i 'm not making excuses for ops sister or the like but she does n't sound mentally healthy at all ( i can relate ) and a psychologist could potentially help , instead of just deciding that is the kind of person she is and will always be . 
  i 'm around ge in eu also , usually only have ~ 0-1 when a new wave hits but this time i had 8 people banned on my recently played list which goes back to 2nd october and maybe 15 games . 
  are you religious ? 
  it 's funny how you think altered states of consciousness is a negative thing without experiencing any yourself . 
   it 's not funny if you are n't reliable, 
  exactly . 
  you are weird to extroverted people but completely normal to other introverted people . 
  that 's the problem as i see it , when extroverted people ca n't fathom that introverted people exists and vice versa . 
  actually ; it 's sunstone . 
  how is this shit comment positive ? 
  oh right , it 's the people he 's criticizing commenting here . 
  i hate this `` i have an opinion -  i can voice it -  so it must be valid '' mentality that seems to be everywhere now . 
  fuck , now i 'm doing it ... 
  he interrupted him when he started talking nonsense and trying to back away instead of really answering . 
  good luck finding a way to moderate an interview without staying on track by interruption . 
  i 'm not saying it was a perfect interview , but it was a damn good one from ethan . 
  you ca n't make a statement without proof and when it gets called out tell the other side to provide it .
