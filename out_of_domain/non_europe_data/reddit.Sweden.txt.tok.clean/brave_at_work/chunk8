  it 's up to both sides to back up their claims . 
  `` shifting the burden of proof '' so to speak . 
  you 're saying there 's a discrepancy : show us the discrepancy . 
  my comment makes no sense in the context when i 'm reading it now , i actually have no idea what i was thinking . 
  i 've been reading too many debates and shitty politics that all i see is people debating when in actuality that 's not what 's going on . 
  sorry for a bad comment . 
  i 've been seriously depressed for about 10 years now . 
  in the beginning the thought that it 's just temporary kept me going , then i realized that it 's not temporary in my case , it 's something i 'm going to have to live with for the rest of my life . 
  depression fucks with your brain immensely . 
  i used to have good memories and made new ones fairly often . 
  then i stopped making new ones . 
  then i remembered fewer and fewer good ones . 
  then i had to strain myself to even remember a time when i smiled . 
  then i realized that the past did n't matter . 
  then i realized that i actually ca n't create new good memories because the only thing that stays in my head are the negative ones . 
  i can count the positive things in my life on one hand but i can write endlessly the negative ones . 
  i know i used to not be filled with hatred and despair . 
  i just ca n't remember anything else . 
  how so ? 
  just open console and enter the commands instead of going to options . 
  then you can learn how to change things quickly during a game also . 
  now i know what i have !, 
  i 've been trying to figure it out together with doctors but they give me stretching exercises that does nothing . 
  i think u/j _ mitso means well but he 's probably using himself as the `` baseline '' too much . 
  it 's great if you can think yourself out of a dark spiral but my guess is that this is n't the norm . 
  i used to be able to process and ignore my negative thoughts ; then you realize that it 's your brain reacting and that it 's completely different from active thoughts . 
  then the reactions become active thoughts because you ca n't shut the reactions out . 
  i 've wasted so much time listening to various `` self-motivation-quotes '' and trying general tips out , these do nothing for me , or well , they make sure i 'm aware when i 'm having a good day i guess . 
  what works for me is nothing   :'), 
  hello , i 'm nothing . 
  it 's as good as any corner prefire : all about knowing the angle . 
  yeah , i 'm agreeing with you that it 's not a hard thing to do at all . 
  start taking care of it ** now ** . 
  i 'm in the same boat and i waited too long to see it as a real problem since i still `` functioned '' ; i no longer `` function '' . 
  fuckit , i 'm gon na do this !, 
  i genuinely used to be 1200 dpi with 6 sens and i was decent . 
  then i changed to my current setup 1400 dpi with 0.9 sens and i reached global ( pretty much ) straight away because i no longer played like i had to have 1080 degree reactions . 
  this fucked my gaming sessions playing quake though :(, 
  i used to love calling strats but when there 's a way higher chance of success just staying quiet and hoping for your team to win their stupid ass peeks . 
  also , `` rushing '' is the most stupid tactic there is , but in the average mind of a cs : go player it is the best tactic there is . 
  i 'm not salty. , , | . 
  explain your reasoning behind that one . 
  if you make bad calls and have players listen to them then the situations they get put in are most likely harder than if you said nothing and let them play their own strengths ( which in a pug you have no idea about ) . 
  sure i 'm also talking out off my ass based on my own experiences which are : i 've had way more success when saying `` go get some kills '' than an intricate or even a simple `` 2 mid 3 b contact '' call . 
  so i guess we 're going to have to agree to disagree, 
  it is so much better with a controller . 
  just buy an xbox or ps controller for your pc and live a happier gaming life !, 
  i think any game that does n't require precision aim is better with a controller , people who say otherwise just have n't given it a fair shot . 
  obligatory `` i say this as a pc gamer '' . 
  that comparison is not fair since most people are either left handed or right handed but no one is keyboard-handed or controller-handed : they are just tools . 
  but everyone is different and i believe you when you say you play better with keyboard , you do you !, 
  yeah , so hilarious to say `` literally the correct way '' as if learning stuff is the same for everyone and you just have to look up the answers in the back of the book . 
  having said that : using the `` recoil master '' workshop map is superior to anything you do yourself because it has all the functionality that you could possible need when your goal is to learn the patterns . 
  why not give new players wanting to learn how to spray the simplest way : load a map -  go learn . 
  thanks for linking that sub !, 
  my reaction to the `` depressing memes '' as someone with depression is exactly what you describe , you become more ok with it because obviously others are in the same boat as you and putting a humorous twist on a situation makes light of it even if that 's not the intention . 
  as someone with depression weed gives me a lot of energy so that i actually do stuff i usually skip when i 'm feeling down , such as clearing the dishwasher , cleaning etc. 
  i do this sometimes as a challenge ( with varied results :d ),

  same as ctrl + alt + delete -  enter ? 
  what 's a genius comment then ? 
  i could easily see an actual genuis choosing that answer as wanting to relive your favorite things feels universal . 
  or take it for what it is : esl apologizing once more without any actual action behind it . 
  i 'm still absolutely amazed that esl have any kind of clout with the orgs/players after all their fuckups ( when there are clearly much more qualified organizers or even giving an upcomer a chance is probably still a better bet ) . 
  if you ca n't tell the difference between a joke and actual animosity you should try to learn how to . 
  it 's a good skill to have , makes life more fun since it enables appreciation of more jokes . 
  good question that should be answered before calling it a glitch . 
  there you go then !, 
  confirmed glitch . 
  i 'm waiting for the crash , all this positivity ca n't actually be good for people .

  because it 's so obviously making fun of nerds while actually targeting non-nerds as their audience . 
  also it 's just the same thing week after week and has been like that since forever : turn off your brain and enjoy it . 
  it deserves the hate it gets with its big viewership versus the actual quality of content . 
  sometimes it 's funnier to leave a question unanswered :(, 
  he said himself he 's inactive and `` many ` inactivity ' kicks '' would probably include someone who is inactive . 
  it 's weird how positivity actually works , who knew !, 
  even though it 's a bit capitalistic with gold being equivalent happiness ,

  this would lower the skill ceiling since people should already be keeping track of whether or not teammates had a kit and where they died .

  probably the whole `` left people gone nuts '' thing , that 's pretty depressing . 
  it feels like half the posts in this thread are warning for extreme opinions in this sub , implying that the ones posting does n't hold those extreme opinions . 
  a bit of a contradiction if you ask me . 
  it 's really amazing how this sub does that . 
  whenever i find myself in a negative mood and want to snap out of it : i just come here !,
