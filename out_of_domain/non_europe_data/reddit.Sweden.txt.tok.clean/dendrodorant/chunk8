  yea it 's super strong on that map . 
  and as stated by others ; this was surely a decision made together with the coach . 
  i really like this show man . 
  do n't you mean probelems ? 
  ** part1 ** part1 ** part1 ** part1, 
  lol nice, 
  this move got lost again so quickly after people stopped using the piss build . . 
  i think it really has a place in mid/lategame zvp for harass instead of , or combined with ling runbys, 
  ya it exploded at some point and indeed everything can be a meme now . 
  hey all credit to byun , he truly played great and it 's heartwarming to see him win . 
  yet i 'm really disappointed in sos 's play in general . 
  honestly ca n't remember the last time he played that bad . 
  several mistakes and strange decisions throughout the games . 
  [ almost ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tewmxye3fkw ), 
  amen . 
  i have n't really seen this style at all in legacy , this series had a really clean and interesting development in the meta and style between the two players throughout the games . 
  i think i 've been eating in the very same place 2 years ago !, 
  it was quite the absurd feeling waiting in line at 4:30 in the morning for sushi . 
  but man did that that taste good . 
  hey if you like this check out the other clips . 
  every frame a painting is a superb channel, 
  this . 
  enough feeding already . 
  it 's not funny , it 's not original anymore ( if ever ) and its not worthy of attention . 
  dude it was sarcastic ... of course its not #worth, 
  dustin browder praised destructible rocks . 
  sc2 community was n't as fascinated . 
  meme was created . 
  what map are you playing ? 
  could onebase it with 4gate , proxyrobo , proxystargate or smth on maps with hard to defend naturals ( like frozen temple ) . 
  canon rush is really hard to stop on new gettysburg ( inb4 zest fail ), 
  would not recommend some obvious cheese like early dts . 
  he 's gon na play it safe . 
  either rush with maximum agression or try playing a normal opening and hit some timing . 
  he seems to be a boring douchebag . 
  do n't really know about either of these players decisions this game . 
  amazing edit and really entertaining nonetheless !, 
  `` so meta '', 
  should 've hired pig for the job . 
  even if there are several great protoss streams we have not seen anything from the top for quite a while :(, 
  prosumption at its finest . . 
  [ and i 'll be like . . ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzmhh8zhtiy&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=43 ), 
  can you transform the viking whilst the cc is landed ? 
  it 's coffee you donkey, 
  the more you know . 
  thanks . 
  tremendous, 
  theres a suction in the toilet , making sure the poop wo n't fly away . 
  [ space toilet ] ( https://www.google.se/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=utf-8#q=space%20toilet ), 
  agree !, 
  possibly before his attack on frozen temple vs rouge , he lost a fair bit of probes . 
  but the micro and the call to go for dts after killing the spore and seeing the lack of overseers was all together a very beautiful play that impressed me a lot , and it put him once again in a great position . 
  i hear what you 're saying !, 
  it 's time for blizzard to significantly buff zealots !, 
  hey i feel you and agree with you mate . 
  struggled several times with friends being annoyed with my unwillingness to play fifa and other games with them . 
  i 'm sure there are other games you can enjoy though . 
  i used to play a lot of quake . 
  a game that just like starcraft requires obscene amounts training and knowledge if you want to keep improving . 
  speed , map knowledge , timing and game sense ( and ofc aim ) . 
  i feel like what huk made when he became an overwatch caster/analyst or whatever he is was a carrier move , rather than `` loving overwatch so much he wants to cast it , '' and that these things always shine through . 
  if he does n't truly respect the game as a competitive one and looks down on it in comparison to starcraft people will notice . 
  well thats your biased view . 
  terrible terrible autism, 
  to be fair , hero has n't been showing anything really impressive at all in lotv , at least in comparison to his results in hots . 
  that does n't take credit from pet 's advancements though . 
  all situations i guess are more or less `` different '' as all units are effected differently by the upgrades . 
  attack speed of the unit , number of attacks ( several units do 2 at at time ) , and as mentioned in this tread already the units gain more value from attack upgrades the higher their damage output is . 
  you 're a good person !, 
  how do you know he does n't wear a cape ? 
  too bad for u mate, 
  well i can see that someone has taken his classes in social interaction and everyday communication seriously !, 
  good job, 
  really nice watch . 
  thank you for making this . 
  reminds me of the old [ fruitdealer video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrfzeo2yte0 ) , very emotional . 
  reminds me of [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pkqe8fm2uw ), 
  that man is slowly losing it, 
  great stream indeed, 
  community guy , sort of bm douchebag with opinions about everything . 
  a true drama-generator . 
  all the stuff people like . 
  how old is avilo ? 
  grills will be impressed, 
  i know i 'm biased here , but is it really ?? 
  hts are way slower than ghosts , emp is splash and feedback is not . 
  ghost can cloak , hts can not . 
  i ca n't see how spamming a few emps over the protoss army is harder than spamming a few storms over the terran army, 
  swenglish at its finest, 
  ftw its clearly ps, 
  while this is insane and all i hope he gets to practice a lot with top players as well , seems like he runs into a lot of players not from the `` absolute top '' on the ladder . 
  welcome to the world of controlling protoss ' armies, 
  other koreans have teammates for practice and do n't ladder as much as byun . 
  holy shit it 's actually over, 
  no apologies needed . 
  thank you wolf , for everything you have done for us . 
  you have to me been an essential part of everything great with proleague and the realisation that everything has come to and end is honestly heartbreaking, 
  mate i like your enthusiasm but sometimes it is okay to mourn . 
  to me and many others , these five teams ( together with jinair & afreeca ) is starcraft . 
  they have been starcraft2 for six years and also a huge part of our lives .
