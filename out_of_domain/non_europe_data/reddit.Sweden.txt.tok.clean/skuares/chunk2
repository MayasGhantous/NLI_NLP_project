  sorry for the interrogation , but i would n't want to give you useless advice . 
  please send me a pm and i 'll see what i can find for you . 
  but i can start by mentioning the pimsleur program since i 've seen it recommended on reddit . 
  i 've no idea if it 's any good though so i 'm only comfortable mentioning it . 
  especially since it is n't free . 
  but hey , feel free to ask me anything in the meantime . 
  i 'd be happy to help . 
  the silliness of the expression is probably why people use it , 
  nope . 
  well , i 've never heard someone use it as a heartfelt reaction . 
  some might use it sarcastically ? 
  if the kids were actually excited they 'd probably just cheer and shout `` yes '' or something . 
  we do have some dignity after all , 
  let 's just put it like this : it 's it 's not listed in saol ( svenska akademiens ordlista ) which is our official dictionary . 
  so i do n't even know how to spell it . 
  i 'm from gothenburg ( or rather g\u00f6teborg ) so i ca n't help you directly with your dialect and most online resources will be in riksvenska , but i 'll certainly look into it . 
  and it should n't be too hard to find good sources for the pronunciation of common phrases ( in riksvenska , but still ) . 
  i 've heard the joke about vasa a lot ( and particularly outside of stockholm ) , but we tend to sing more than we use jokes like that . 
  at least during midsummer and the crayfish party when you drink alcohol like aquavit more socially . 
  `` helan g\u00e5r '' , for example , is a very common drinking song . 
  and if you ever have any questions regarding grammar feel free to pm me . 
  but i 'll look for some links . 
  in what way are you good at grammar ? 
  are you used to reading heavy grammatical texts ? 
  or are you `` simply '' good at seeing patterns in language and learning the rules ? 
  no problem . 
  i 'm quite swamped during the weekdays , but i 'll look into a few links for you on wednesday . 
  and the songs are usually very simple so they might be a good way to start practising pronunciation . 
  well , then you 're interested in grammar the same way i am . 
  that 's great !, 
  feel free to ask whenever you have a question . 
  i 'm quite used to reading the heavier texts so i can always simplify something and/or translate texts for you . 
  a few tips on how to tell the difference based on how you pronounce them :, 
  ** general ** :, 
  put your tongue in the right position . 
  say / a / and try to feel where the tip of your tongue . 
  now say / i / ( swedish i ) and try to feel where your tongue is . 
  open or close your mouth . 
  when you say / a / , / \u00e4 / or / \u00f6 / your mouth is supposed to be wide open . 
  when you say / i / it is more or less closed and the air is pushed out through your nose . 
  shape your lips correctly . 
  when you say / o / , / u / or / y / your lips are round . 
  otherwise an / y / is not an / y / but an / i / . 
  ** the letters you asked about ** :, 
  o : lift your tongue and let the tip of your tongue touch the ridged area just behind the alveolar ridge ( behind your upper teeth ) it 's just behind ( further into your mouth ) from where you `` flick '' it when pronouncing t. your tongue should be quite far back in your mouth . 
  then form a very round and very small mouth -- shaped just like the letter `` o '' . 
  try to make the sound now . 
  and then let your tongue drop down slightly so it 's not touching anything . 
  well , maybe behind your lower teeth . 
  ( the important thing is to keep the shape of your tongue in a certain way ) . 
  and then push the sound out by pursing your lips sightly . 
  the long swedish / o / can be compared to the english / oo / as in cool . 
  \u00c5 : it 's very close to an a. 
  if you keep the tip of your tongue on your lower gums ( you can even put it quite far down and press the very front of your tongue against the upper part just beneath your front teeth ; so that the middle of your tongue gets pressed up above your lower teeth ) and at the same time keep your mouth half-open ( more closed than when your say / a / ) you 'll have a long / \u00e5 / . 
  this sound is mostly produced in your throat so you should n't need to move your lips that much ( just like with / a / . 
  / a / and / \u00e5 / are very close to each other in your mouth and therefore get confused . 
  the long / \u00e5 / can be compared to the english / aw / , but not to the english / oe / since the / oe / consists of two vowel sounds which / \u00e5 / does n't . 
  y : the position of your tongue is the same as when saying / i / , but when you say / y / you got to have rounded lips . 
  you have to lift your upper lip a little . 
  after it 's lifted it stays in that position and the sound is made by your lower lip , throat and tongue . 
  so you can practice by trying to squeeze a pen between your nose and your upper lip . 
  does the pen stay ? 
  good , then you have made an / y / . 
  if you do n't have a pen close you can always use your finger . 
  the goal is for your lip to touch your finger while you rest it just beneath your nose . 
  i : if you move forward with the tip of your tongue , and let the sides of your tongue touch the teeth in the upper jaw , you should produce a swedish / i / . 
  the swedish / i / can be compared to the english / ee / , but it is produced even further up in your mouth and is more nasal that english / ee / . 
  you also need to spread your lips more for the swedish / i / . 
  show all your teeth . 
  it 's the only one of these vowels which can be pronounced with your teeth bared . 
  it can also be pronounced while keeping your teeth together ( but it 'll carry a certain `` buzz '' ) . 
  some people also pronounce it by keeping their tongue as flat as possible while letting the tip of their tongue touch the back of their lower teeth . 
  good luck !, 
  i found you a few promising links :, 
  please let me know if you want some more . 
  take care !, 
  i 'm a 21-year-old student from gothenburg . 
  let me know if you ever find yourself in these parts , 
  i 've been lurking around this sub to get some motivation to exercise more rather than to lose weight , so i know next to nothing about counting calories . 
  but i know that there are amazing people on here who has been able to lose a lot of weight . 
  i 'm sure they could tell you how to best count your daily intake of calories and estimate the calories you burn during your walks and your yoga . 
  because 1500 calories a day while having an active job and taking walks or doing yoga every day without losing any weight ? 
  that sounds implausible if not impossible . 
  and i 'm sorry if i 'm too blunt now , but weighing 200 pounds when you 're 5 ' 3 '' is not `` a few extra pounds '' . 
  that 's being obese . 
  and going down to 160 pounds would still mean that you 'd be considered overweight . 
  might i suggest that you think about losing 60 to 80 pounds ? 
  that would put you in the normal weight range and at a weight that should n't take too much effort to keep stable with an ordinary diet . 
  thank you !, 
  the spell-checker on my phone is n't used to being bilingual yet and keep auto-correcting things . 
  okay . 
  but the op is shorter than you and at 5 ' 3 '' , 160 lbs would give them a bmi of 28.3 , would n't it ? 
  and congratulations for losing the weight as well , 
  it 's realistic . 
  and so is 140 , 130 or 120 . 
  losing weight is n't impossible or else no one would ever be able to do it . 
  a lower goal weight will take more work , but after the first hurdle losing weight will get easier in many ways : you 'll have more energy and you 'll be used to your new diet by then . 
  and looking into your pantry seems like a great idea . 
  there are many small changes you could make that would go a long way : m\u00fcesli instead of sweetened cereal for breakfast , olive oil instead of saturated fat in the frying pan , low fat dairy products instead of whipped cream ( well , unless you want to try a specific diet ) and so on . 
  by the way , are you from the us ?
