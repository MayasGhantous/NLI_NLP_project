  my dentist recommended alternating sides every other week or so , try that and see how it works for you .

  as a swede i must say that i do not agree with you . 
  the problem comes down to one thing and one thing only : our extensive welfare state . 
  if you could n't come to sweden and live off tax payer money there would evidentially be less `` non-producing/non-assimilating '' immigration .

  from this question i 'm presuming you have n't written php very long . 
  pick up a book , read tutorials , follow php related blogs and look in to other peoples issues on stack overflow .

   it looks like your santa has n't marked your gift shipped yet . 
  well , he was clearly right wing , there 's no avoiding that . 
  however , i do n't think we should grant him the right to be attributed to anything . 
  he 's nothing more than a terrorist , a mass murderer and outright the most despicable person in scandinavia . 
  leave it at that , he does n't deserve any more airtime . 
  if i remember correctly a few carriers if not all have abandoned collect call .
