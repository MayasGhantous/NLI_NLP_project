  how would you go about this then ? 
  create your own logger which extends illuminate \\ log \\ writer , then you either make a method which just allows you to pop handlers ( $ this -  monolog -  pophandler ( ) from within the method ) or you override the usefiles method to first pop handlers before setting new ones .

  i do n't understand why anyone should be forced to publicize their party affiliation . 
  and the eu has no god damn business in this . 
  of course donations are also associated with party affiliation , why should n't i be able to donate money to a party without being publicized ?

  `` if it moves , tax it .

  the only thing this sort of regulation will lead to is reduced profits for telecom companies which inevitably will lead to less investments in infrastructure . . which will lead to them requiring subsidies . 
  which you will pay with your taxes instead .

  uber had some difficulties here in stockholm due to there being a regulation that you have to display your price on the side of the car . 
  it 's ridiculous . 
   in stockholm people have been charged as much as $ 10 000 for a trip to the airport, 
  not really . 
  the highest recorded price was just north of 10 000 sek ( $ 1500 ) which is still insane . 
  shit , you 're right !, 
  you can go ahead and charge pretty much whatever you want .
