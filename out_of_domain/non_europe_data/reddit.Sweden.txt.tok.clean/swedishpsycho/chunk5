  the standard price indicator is measured by how much 15 minutes of driving for 10 km cost , this is the one you 're obliged to display on the side of the car . 
  taxi companies are pissed about two things here right now , taxi drivers charging too much ( then they 're requesting regulations ) and uber charging too little , uber x specifically ( then they 're requesting regulations ) .

   the goal of hamas ( the ruling party ) is to form a two-state solution, 
  from hamas covenant :, 
   [ . . ] our struggle against the jews is very great and very serious . 
  it needs all sincere efforts . 
  it is a step that inevitably should be followed by other steps . 
  the movement is but one squadron that should be supported by more and more squadrons from this vast arab and islamic world , until the enemy is vanquished and allah 's victory is realised . 
  i hope he properly recycles it . 
  6 years now , top right gum is slightly damaged . 
  my dentist recommended me to switch sides every second week so it can restore . 
  [ i could n't help it ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ic9ksrd.jpg ), 
  all the time except when i 'm sleeping or eating . 
  just short of a can per day . 
  i replace mine every year , the second hand value after one year is good enough to justify it . 
  i 've always managed to sell my previous model for around 80 % of the initial retail price . 
  this means that i 'm paying 1/5 of a new mac each year for the latest model , i think it makes sense which is why i 've been doing this for the past four years . 
  i 've never had any problems of that sort and i 'm pretty sure you will get it replaced if that 's the case . 
  that 's the thing , i look at it like it 's an affordable lease . 
  a new 13 '' macbook air here is 9 495 sek ( used to be 9 995 sek previous years ) and i 've always managed to sell them for about 8000 sek . 
  checking the [ australian apple store ] ( http://store.apple.com/au/buy-mac/macbook-air ) it seems like you pay less . 
  the 13 '' costs a$ 1199 which converts to about 7800 sek . 
  i live in sweden , buy it here and sell it here as well . 
  one thing that can affect the price i get is that there 's no competition from foreign vendors since we have our own variation of the [ qwerty keyboard ] ( http://ascii-table.com/img/keyboard-153.png ) layout and people tend to want that . 
  i just do a regular reformatting and re-installation of the operating system ( you can access that by booting and holding alt ) . 
  i 've had macbook air since the late 2010 model was released . 
  from then on : mid 2011 , mid 2012 , mid 2013 and now an early 2014 . 
  i have n't had a macbook pro with retina display but i 'm well aware of the problems , i 've only had mba since the 2010 model . 
  that sucks . 
  just a quick glance at [ blocket ] ( http://blocket.se ) ( sweden 's biggest marketplace , where i also sell mine ) i find macbook air 11 '' 2013 for 7500 sek and macbook air 13 '' 2012 for 6000 sek . 
  i guess the market is just different . 
  i usually order the new model directly when it becomes available and put my current machine up for sale when i have the delivery confirmation . 
  could definitely be this as well , i 've only had baseline 13 '' mba since 2010 . 
  i 'm not sticking strictly to any 12 month plan , i buy the new one when it 's released and sell the old one . 
  not more complicated than that . 
  and as i said , i 've only had mba in this `` scheme '' , not mbp . 
  no , about 2000 sek which equals about 290 usd , around 1/5th of the price for a new 13 '' mba here . 
  i have n't even consider cutting down , it 's the most natural part of my life .

  you 're most probably just increasing your nicotine tolerance , i ca n't even remember the last time i had a nicotine buzz . 
  i guess that depends on the brand , a lot of snus is stronger than chewing tobacco . 
  and if i 'm not mistaken , more nicotine is also absorbed with snus . 
  i 'm no expert and i have n't really used chew that much , sorry but i 've got no more to add . 
  only us app store so far ? 
  it 's great !,

  [ sentry ] ( https://cartalyst.com/manual/sentry ) is great .

  storing logs and setting up cron jobs with eb would be something that i 'd be personally interested in !, 
  ok , fair enough .

  it 's not just another city , it 's another country . 
   first of all i would suggest not traveling to another city just to `` support yer klub '' because that sounds pathetic . 
  the only thing that 's pathetic is american sports crowds . 
  obviously american sports crowd culture is different , i think the european way is a lot more fun and it 's no surprise that it 's something american teams are interested in copying in some ways . 
  as said by ottowa senators president cyril leeder for example :, 
   allow the fans that want to be rowdy and have a good time more of a european hockey atmosphere . 
  this is common in europe . 
  it 's been said that djurgardens in sweden have the best fans in the world and the reason is they 're standing and cheering the whole game, 
  [ source on the ottowa senators blog ] ( http://senators.nhl.com/club/blogpost.htm?id=31305 ), 
   also , european countries are tiny . 
  what 's your point ? 
  there are both national leagues and pan-european leagues and the eu population is 1.6 the size of the us population so i do n't know how that 's supposed to mean anything . 
   is part of your identities based around a soccer team, 
  yes of course my team is part of my identity . 
  i 've attended games on a regular basis since i was a kid . 
  through bad and good weather , wins and losses . 
  i do n't see how it can not become a part of your identity if you attend 40 + games a year ( [ football ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beadl6sxlia ) and [ ice hockey ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwhqmqjzwee ) in my case ) . 
  like / u/ebonwumon said : abstraction . 
  guzzle has some great features when it comes to mocking responses so you do n't have to hit third party api 's in unit tests for example .
