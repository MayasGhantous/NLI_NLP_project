  it 's been said that djurgardens in sweden have the best fans in the world and the reason is they 're standing and cheering the whole game, 
  if the senators have any intention of emulating [ djurg\u00e5rden ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwhqmqjzwee ) there is one very important rule to adhere to : never , never , never use drums . 
  to display unity within the supporter group , you do n't need a drum to sync the tempo . 
  and if you do you 're basically not singing good enough . 
  it also goes along the line of the traditional supporter culture from great britain . 
   djurg\u00e5rden along with a few other teams are infamous for their `` fans '' who will kick your ass and start a riot if you 're cheering for an opponent . 
  and watered down beer can barely be sold because of said ultras . 
  this might be true against aik but we have n't played against them in a while ( at least not with both supporters groups allowed at the same time ) since they 're down in the second division . 
  so would you mind telling me the last time that happened at a hockey game here ? 
  i 've attended pretty much every single djurg\u00e5rden home game for the past two years and the one brawl i can remember was one between home supporters when we played against [ eisb\u00e4ren berlin in chl ] ( http://www.dn.se/sport/ishockey/brak-pa-laktaren-och-pa-isen-nar-dif-vann/ ) . 
  no problem at all , i 'm not a hooligan so there 's nothing to be afraid of , 
  i agree , honestly the `` hate and caveman mentality '' is obviously a part of it and in my opinion it 's something that 's good for the atmosphere because it promotes endless singing and dedication . 
  as long as you 're able to somewhat leave that behind you when you exit the arena . 
  i can stand there and scream from the top of my lungs that `` we 'll stab you and you know it because we 're djurg\u00e5rden boys '' but as long as there 's no violence involved i do n't see the problem . 
   aik may be playing in the second division but the problem is n't gone . 
  just hidden for the moment . 
  given that they do n't drop down to the third division that is !, 
  ha-ha .

  i 'm not sure about streams , as far as i know c more are the only ones holding television rights to the games . 
  there are a bunch of `` pirated '' streams available with varying quality , i usually use [ this one ] ( http://www.wiziwig.tv/competition.php?part=sports&amp;competitionid=94&amp;discipline=icehockey ) .

  the dif online shop is [ here ] ( http://shop.difhockey.se/matchtrojor-c-150-1.aspx ) . 
  the shop is n't perfect and it 's unfortunately only available in swedish , for your convenience : storlek = size , till kassan = to checkout , k\u00f6p = buy , namn = name ( f\u00f6r = first , efter = last ) , ort = city . 
  also , when you get to checkout you need to click the [ '' \u00f6vriga l\u00e4nder '' ] ( http://i.imgur.com/z94ara4.png ) link to choose the us . 
  if you have any problems feel free to message me and i 'll try to help you out !,

  djurg\u00e5rden hockey will probably only qualify for `` play-in '' which will mean that there are games on the 7th , 9th and 10th where at least one will be a home game . 
  same here in sweden , tax makes up for a combined 57.5 % at 14.33 sek per litre ( sales tax + energy tax + co ^ 2 tax ) .

  as a swede , i love the guy . 
  he has managed to some extent actually bring golf to the mainstream agenda in sweden thanks to his accomplishments , which is great . 
  i hope he has what it takes to win a major and i 'm confident that he 'll be able to remain in the top 5 of the rankings . 
  about one can per day with general tailored , so it will probably be slightly less of a can when i 'm forced to switch to something else . 
  source on the support for the monopoly ? 
   i would hate for the monopoly to go away and sweden end up in a situation like some countries abroad where you walk into a store and it 's literally only the two super cheap local rums or whatever for sale plus the blandest most mainstream beers and wines you can find . 
  different varieties of alcohol are way more accessible in most other countries . 
  for one , not a single systembolaget has 2000 products available in store . 
  and i can order any of those other 8000 products online anyway , same way as with systembolaget but with more reliable shipping ( not the we 'll tell you when it 's in store for pick-up within two weeks ) . 
  in addition to this , without nanny government regulations like the alcohol monopoly i would n't need to spend 45 + minutes to buy alcohol because i need to go a number of underground stops for the nearest systembolaget . 
  as i 'm sipping on an ardbeg uigeadail with just a dash of water right now i do n't think that description was entirely accurate . 
  it 's obvious that you just have n't spent that much time abroad , and that 's fine . 
  thanks for the source , and to / u/zitrax _ too . 
  if opposing state run monopolies qualify me as `` retarded '' then i guess that 's an epithet i 'll have to accept . 
  - availability , including deliveries , location and opening hours, 
  - pricing , there 's no competition, 
  - the rules regarding how they approve new products, 
  - owned and operated by the state, 
  i 'll do the same .

  why is that a concern ? 
  just for the record , the swedish bar is not including payroll tax which is currently at 31.42 % . 
  including payroll tax it 's more like ~ 67.3 % . 
  that is correct , everyone files their taxes individually !,

  i would n't say that we have relaxed gun laws in sweden . 
  even though we have quite a few registered hunters the vast majority of people have never even seen a gun apart from the holster of people in law enforcement . 
  not at all true . 
  the american right ( which i 'm quite sure is what you 're criticising ) has a long history of defending the existence of unions . 
  the problem from the right wing perspective is not unions in themselves , but legislation granting unions separate rights .
