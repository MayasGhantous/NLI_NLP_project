   almost nobody accepts american express here, 
  not true at all . 
  9/10 of my transactions in stockholm are with amex . 
  yeah i got the same impression . 
  just 7 days , it was a really cool experience !, 
   us only ... canada never gets any love, 
  rest of the world is here as well, 
  take a look at [ gosim ] ( http://www.gosim.com ) . 
  as someone who has lived in stockholm more or less my whole life , i wonder the same thing . 
  maybe that answers your question . . 
  taxes are a bit higher than that since you qualify for the federal tax bracket , at 42 000sek a month it would be about another 1000sek in taxes . 
  hat off when shaking hands . 
  hat off when entering the club house . 
  i do n't really mind if other people do n't , however i wo n't be the one that compromises on manners , politeness and respect . 
  simple gestures that go a long way . 
  [ it was ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/07/09/pornhub-germany-brazil_n_5570223.html ), 
   `` systembolaget '' has got all the alcohol in the world, 
  if you repeat a lie often enough , it becomes true, 
   i lived in the uk for 6 years, 
  lived in belgium , local delhaize and carrefour stores beat systembolaget easily . 
   and you can order in what 's missing, 
  well ... 
  the greatest moment i 've ever experienced in sports . 
  first swede ( men 's ) to win a major , which is massive . 
  yesterday had skipped heart beats , a few tears of joy and bottles of champagne . 
  simply amazing . 
  i enjoyed his style of play , he was really fast on the ice and had pretty good puck handling skills . 
  small but tough . 
  well let 's put it like this . 
  if i were given the task to dismantle the state then the last thing i would remove would be monarchy , and i would be hesitant . 
   social services are completely wiped out, 
  this ca n't come soon enough . 
  `` throwing it away '' . . almost 30 % of the swedish labor force is employed by the state and our tax burden is around 70 % . 
  the welfare state is the problem , not the immigration . 
  because the welfare system should be abolished all together . 
   you ca n't combine open borders with a welfare state . 
  agreed !, 
  i would say that most individual liberties ca n't be combined with a welfare state . 
   plus i do n't think sweden is gon na become a libertarian country [ . . ], 
  ever . 
  there 's a ridiculously strong tradition of social democracy and trust in the government here . 
  but lowering the massive theft from people who hold jobs is still a fight worth taking . 
   what 's your opinion on sweden currently ? 
  ( the current influx of refugees ), 
  i think the current influx is highly motivated by the benefits provided by the previously mentioned welfare state . 
  it does create huge incentive to come here as opposed to somewhere else . 
  the fact is that you can get by fine on benefits , which is terrible in my opinion . 
  fundamentally i have no issue with immigration whatsoever , i think freedom of movement is a basic right and given the current situation in syria ( vast majority of the immigrants ) a lot of people are able to make their way to a better future . 
  on the other hand , it 's really difficult and expensive for people to get into europe in the first place since we 're lacking safe and legitimate routes . 
  this leads to smuggling and in the end that the people who might be in the greatest need ca n't leave . 
  ftfy, 
  at least you 're in the damn game . 
  well , this is part of the budget for 2017 and come january they 're indeed raising taxes from where they 're currently at . 
  electricity is taxed at almost 100 % in sweden . 
  this does not help the common man at all , but i guess it 's a great thing for rich people with big houses . 
  that was an additional tax , an extra tax on solar . 
  one which was n't payed by consumers . 
   the government , which is comprised of the social democrats and the greens , cited compliance with european union rules for introducing the new tax but the european commission later said that was not the case . 
  so they pushed for an extra tax , passed it and now decided to remove it . 
  they thought it was required for compliance with eu rules , turned out that the swedish interpretation of the new eu directive was off, 
  sweden is responsible for 0.16 % of global carbon dioxide emissions , we have among the lowest per capita emissions of all developed nations . 
  solar is n't really viable in most of sweden , although there 's a good case mainly for storing hydro in these type of battery packs ( hydro and nuclear respectively represents roughly 50 % of electricity production here ) . 
  one of the big things is `` welfare reforms for 24 billion swedish kronor '', 
  finance minister magdalena andersson said this about the 2017 budget :, 
   the welfare needs more resources for municipalities to meet their commitments towards citizens , reliability needs to be strengthened and we need to continue to deal with the consequences of last year 's high asylum reception, 
  obviously initiatives like the one discussed in this thread affects it too , more expenditures surely adds to the total amount . 
  that 's a fair point , and i do agree with you . 
  however , when it comes to this specific subsidy i think it 's completely misdirected . 
  more like 10 cents converted to us dollar ( 90 \u00f6re ) , mind you that the us dollar is also incredibly strong towards the sek [ right now ] ( https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/usdsek:cur ) and that 1,5 years ago that was more like 14 cents . 
   i understand the costs are high for now but the pay off is clean energy, 
  well , that 's where we disagree . 
  i do n't think that this subsidy does that . 
   they 're going to use something less efficient that pollutes more, 
  as this is sweden we 're talking about that would be hydro or nuclear energy off the grid . 
  haiti is a whole different story and they could make great use of solar there , obviously . 
  haiti also has 3115 hours of sun per year ( 28.9 % with low sun intensity ) whereas sweden has 1973 ( 55 % with low sun intensity ) . 
  the difference between the longest and shortest days is just over 2 hours in haiti ( consistent ! ), 
  while it 's 12,5 hours in sweden ( not at all consistent ) . 
  it 's a horrible comparison though and the scenario you 're depicting is completely irrelevant to the topic . 
  with the exception of sweden , the sale of snus is prohibited in the european union ( eu ) . 
  article 17 of the 2014 eu tobacco products directive ( tpd ) states that :, 
   `` member states shall prohibit the placing on the market of tobacco for oral use , without prejudice to article 151 of the act of accession of austria , finland and sweden . '', 
  [ source ] ( http://www.tobaccotactics.org/index.php/snus:_eu_ban_on_snus_sales ) . 
  so i guess , wait until post brexit . 
  i think you 're correct . 
  yes , you 'll find plenty at gas stations and grocery stores ( ica , coop etc ) . 
  football ( soccer ) season does n't start until april but hockey season is on and djurg\u00e5rden is playing on january 12th . 
  send a dm if you 're interested in getting a ticket and i can help you out . 
  i 'd go with a comviq sim card , then you can get 10 gb of data for around $ 20 . 
  they can be purchased at 7-eleven , pressbyr\u00e5n and most corner shops . 
  well the usd is ridiculously strong right now too . 
  if you like sports there 's a hockey game on the 26th , djurg\u00e5rdens if playing f\u00e4rjestad . 
  if that screenshot is your actual results you 're fairly consistently getting more than 150 mbit/s with your average around 176 . 
  either that or the units are incorrect . 
  how ?

  ligger ett f\u00f6rslag i [ kongressen ] ( https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/170/text?r=1 ) . 
  define peaceful . 
  4k or `` ultra hd '' requires a bit more than that though . 
   and pretty much everyones go-to brand is ettan l\u00f6s,
