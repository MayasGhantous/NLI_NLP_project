  they are too much . 
  both their birthrates and kurds ' birthrates are higher than turks . 
  even if it slows down in a generation , most likely , turks will be minority in 40-50 years . 
  you know exactly how many syrians that are integrated ? 
  we are talking about 3m people here . 
  i 've started masters in turkey , but not completed . 
  finished masters in france . 
  currently doing phd in mechanical engineering at itu . 
  i can say that turkish universities sucks compared to most european and north american universities . 
  you can get accepted to masters program easily with 3.0 gpa and 700 gre . 
  increase the funding on research , throw politics out of the university and employ the most qualified people as academicians . 
  never gon na happen . 
  born in izmir . 
  raised in izmir . 
  left izmir to study abroad for few years . 
  living in izmir now . 
  cool  . 
  i 've been in many countries in europe but i think izmir is more beautiful than all of them  . 
  bijiggered !, 
  i did 2 years ago . 
  they gave us bayonets which can be also used as a knife . 
  they can be attached on g3 rifles . 
  bayonet was more or less like [ this ] ( http://www.old-smithy.info/bayonets/fullsize/pakistan/pakistan%20g3%20possible.jpg ) one . 
  but it was unsharpened so we could n't injure ourselves easily . 
  alternative rock/rock and house music mostly . 
  fo\u015fik seperatist turkey is responsible for all this mess . 
  she says `` yabanci uyruklu '' which means they are not turkish . 
  [ ... ] ( http://alctrs.com/files/my%20sample%20gallery/180-degrees%20edited.gif ), 
  is he saying `` ak . 
   kemalists and nationalists might refill the positions that were previously occupied by gulenists, 
  yes news says that most officers , generals , etc. 
  fired from the military because of balyoz and ergenekon are now refilling those positions . 
  unfortunately not most turkish professionals can speak/write/read german . 
  well , i did n't know that german people were that much open-minded . 
  i did my master 's degree in mechanical engineering in france with intermediate level knowledge of french language . 
  people were very rude and did n't talk/listen to me in my first months , some of them continued to behave rude even after i started to speak fluently . 
  thanks . 
  dokuz eylul or ege depending on what you are planning to study . 
  edit : location-wise ege is a much better choice but some engineering programs are worse than dokuz eylul . 
  i can recommend istanbul and ankara other than izmir . 
  particularly koc , sabanci , bilkent , odtu , itu and bogazici universities . 
  most erdogan supporters do n't think sharia should put in place . 
  adam cs : go ` daki teroristlere benziyor . 
  here is the topic he 's talking about : https://www.reddit.com/r/turkey/comments/4oa5y0/turkey_search_results/, 
  what about ` kama\u015fullah ' ? 
  naturalize 'em all . 
  this is possibly \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc caddesi . 
  this works fine : https://np.reddit.com/r/turkey/comments/5b51f9/tell_your_friends_in_turkey_to_use_lantern_to/d9m01k6/, 
  you create an amazon aws account for free and set up your own vpn server . 
  read the guide he provided . 
  you 're at incirlik ? 
  oh it must be really bad . 
  i know that feeling . 
  once i could n't get off the base for 2 months during my military service and it was extremely boring . 
  i hope you find more time to experience the local culture . 
  turkey is going through hard times right now . 
  let 's hope these times come to an end and you find more chance to get off the base . 
  busses on buca-kar\u015f\u0131yaka-konak routes will be deadly tomorrow . 
  27/m/izmir looking for a relationship, 
  well if you compare turkey with european countries , of course there are some differences such as life quality , civil rights , etc. 
  pc mostly sometimes mobile - hearthstone, 
  really ? 
  literally all b\u00fcfes are selling those new cards in g\u00f6ztepe-g\u00fczelyal\u0131 area . 
  as far as i can remember you were living in izmir . 
  as a local of izmir , you are always welcome to izmir ( and turkey ) . 
  sorry for your recent bad experiences . 
  as a local , i 'm also mapping out my own exit plan after i finish my phd here . 
  looking for a postdoctoral position in usa , canada or australia . 
  turkey is getting worse and worse day by day :( . 
  european ? 
  he 's saying that he 's living in usa . 
  afaik before and during the wwi many balkan turks migrated to usa . 
  my grand grand parents were also in that group . 
  last year me and some of my friends visited sakiz adasi ( chios ) from cesme . 
  when you arrive to the island , the ferry leaves you at a kind of border check-point where you can apply for a visa for a small amount of fee or if you have a eu passport , you just show your passport and go on . 
  if you are going to chios , i recommend you to find a tour guide or go there with your car . 
  the city center is small/not attractive and there are lots of places to see outside of the center where they 're far enough that you ca n't go there by walking . 
  there are lots of small tour companies at the cesme city center near the cesme marina . 
  you consult them and you select appropriate date/time for ferry departure and arrival . 
  then you give them your passports and i think they scan them and send to their greek counterparts . 
  after you arrive to chios , you just show them your passport and pay a small amount of fee , they know you will arrive since travel agency in cesme already sent them your passport info so they paste a sticker on a page of your passport and that 's it . 
  there is a special agreement between greece and turkey about tourism . 
  according to that agreement , those companies regulate short-time travel ( tourism ) between greek islands and turkey . 
  they also make it easy to get a visa from greece , it 's actually much harder to get a visa from greece for a turk , if you 're planning to visit mainland greece for example . 
  those islands do n't have an airport so you can only go there by ferries . 
  so , in short , for short-time travels , the tour companies are the easiest and the only way . 
  yes , those companies are there for daily ( or weekly at most i think ) visits between greek islands and turkey . 
  as you say most turks that are originated from western turkey can easily physically pass as a european . 
  however , at least from my observations , many europeans think that all turks are arab/not-european so this is more or less a reaction . 
  also , our culture and language are very different from europeans . 
  one last thing , we most western turks are n't +99 % greek/slavic/armenian . 
  imam hatipler kapatilsin !, 
  doktora calisma alanimdaki en prestijli ( science citation index-impact factor olarak ) bilimsel dergilerde makalelerim ve hakemliklerim var . 
  however , they never say anything like that . 
  `` turkes 's ( nationalist party mhp 's founder ) army is traitors ' fear . '', 
  `` apo 's ( abdullah ocalan-leader of pkk ) bastards ca n't terrorize/discourage us . '', 
  things like that . 
  they are probably erdogan fanatics uneducated conservative-nationalist people . 
  we call them comar ( a common dog name in turkey ) . 
  if this was in turkey , it 's ok .
