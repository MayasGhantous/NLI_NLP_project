  i hope your next visit will be longer than the last one . 
  i had the same experience during my studies in france as a turk . 
  i can understand you . 
  that was really terrible . 
  western-turkish and greek dishes are very similar so i think you should try more eastern foods like cig kofte or different types of kebabs . 
  nowadays , most popular music is american popular culture knockoff pop music . 
  i think i do n't have an answer for this question but 1984 is referenced by many anti-akp people nowadays for describing current-day turkey . 
  '' vazgectim ben bugun '' roughly means '' i gave up today '', 
  here is my favorite song : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9i-0ax5sdo, 
  no regulations on video games . 
  regulations are mainly on politics , social media and porn  . 
  i used to play world of warcraft , but i 'm bored . 
  i 'm playing bloodborne nowadays . 
  yes lots of porn sites are blocked due to various reasons such as private video of a person is uploaded to that site , etc. 
  as a greek friend asked on / r/turkey , i am also wondering , any nice greek non-traditional songs you can recommend ? 
  it can be of any genre pop , rock , progressive , etc. 
  wow . 
  i do n't speak greek but is [ this ] ( http://yunus.hacettepe.edu.tr/~sadi/bilgi/turkce-yunanca.html ) true ? 
  thanks for the list . 
  `` pame oloi mazi se mia paralia '' is so cool . 
  wow most of those words are used in daily speech . 
  we are almost speaking the same language then  . 
  thanks for recommendation  . 
  his songs sound too familiar . 
  instruments used in his music and also his voice tone is very similar to classic turkish art music . 
  it 's almost the same music with different language . 
  may he rest in peace . 
  ahh that song made my night thanks very much for sharing . 
  it 's the same with aegean region `` harmandali '' music . 
  i grew up listening this music also my mother love this kind of music . 
  according to genetic studies , pre-turkic anatolian component constitutes most of our genetics . 
  so definitely yes . 
  according to the apricity forum , i am atlanto-pontid . 
  most of their members appear to be also stormfront members . 
  they always get angry when they see a european looking turk lol . 
  i did n't reveal my ethnicity just asked them to classify me . 
  some of them are good classifiers . 
  but i 've witnessed some european looking turks revealing their ancestry . 
  reactions of the members were really funny . 
  i mentioned genetics because that means we are related to those people . 
  just as we are related to turkic people . 
  i 'm not writing at that forum any more . 
  it has been about 2 years since my last post . 
  i do n't think i can find those discussions . 
  if you are looking for an unconstrained problem , there are benchmark functions such as ackley , rastrigin , sphere , etc. 
  ( have a look at [ here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/test_functions_for_optimization ) ), 
  traveling salesman and vehicle routing problems are the most famous constrained problems . 
  also you can have a look at vehicle rescheduling and chinese postman problems for constrained problems . 
  i lived in france for two years . 
  i have lots of questions to them . 
  so definitely / r/france for me .

  hey guys ,, 
  i have lots of friends who are interested in japanese culture . 
  most of them are exchange students in japan now . 
  i noticed that most people 's journey to japanese culture begin with animes . 
  i think they are a good ` advertisement ' of your culture . 
  i have three questions for you :, 
  chopsticks are not very popular in this part of the world . 
  so i am wondering , which dishes you eat with chopsticks ? 
  are animes popular in japan ? 
  ( i guess the answer is yes , but i am still wondering ), 
  this question is for those who watch animes . 
  i am a huge fan of animes . 
  i love ghost in the shell and ergo proxy . 
  can you recommend some series that is similar to these series ? 
  also , what is your favorite series ? 
  thanks , 
  welcome to / r/turkey !, 
  [ here is my favorite song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9i-0ax5sdo ), 
  [ another nice song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9d_yghqjl28 ), 
  one piece and bleach are very popular . 
  i 've seen translations of them in stores . 
  hi and welcome ,, 
  most redditors in this sub , including me , have atheistic or agnostic religious views . 
  so , i think most redditors will condemn that attack which is committed in the name of a religion they do n't believe . 
  personally , i disapprove that attack and happy that the murderers are dead now . 
  i do n't know if they are popular in japan but you should try various kebabs . 
  hello and welcome ,, 
  my favorite one is ergo proxy . 
  ( ghost in the shell is nice too . ), 
  because i love cyberpunk animes . 
  and it is best anime i 've seen that can reflect the post-apocalyptic loneliness feeling to the viewer . 
  also , my favorite off-genre series is bleach . 
  thanks for the answers guys !, 
  i 'll definitely try the series you recommend . 
  hello guys again ,, 
  can you recommend some good modern japanese music ? 
  my favorite so far is [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wh8fgsetnq ) one , which is also the opening theme of the recent anime series death parade . 
  thanks , 
  i think the most popular one is [ iskender kebab ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0d/\u0130skender_kebap.jpg ) . 
  it 's prepared with sliced meat pieces from [ doner ] ( http://www.nidadoner.net/imgs/pizza/54.jpg ) , yogurt , bread and different sauces . 
  or for some different kebabs , for example [ adana ] ( http://www.kebabhouseselcuk.com/uploads/1/1/2/7/11274745/6169701_orig.jpg?283 ) , served near the bread . 
  while [ shawarma ] ( http://cdn.yemek.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/adana-kebap-durum.jpg ) has a special kind of bread wrapped around meat and different kind of ingredients . 
  so cool . 
  thanks  . 
  that bunny masks they wear in the video reminds me of tokyo ghoul anime series for some reason . 
  nice !,
