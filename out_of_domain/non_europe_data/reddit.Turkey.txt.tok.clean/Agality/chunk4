  i love dondurma too !, 
  it 's not expensive in turkey . 
  you can get a good dondurma for 2.5-3 turkish liras ( about $ 1 ), 
  yes , i drink alcohol . 
  i like [ tuborg gold ] ( http://www.banubarlas.com/upload/portfolyo/tuborg/gold/tuborg-gold-02.jpg ) and [ okuzgozu red wine ] ( http://www.sarapoburu.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/vinolus-okuzgoz-bogazkere-2008.jpg ) . 
  also , we have a national drink [ raki ] ( http://s3.amazonaws.com/rapgenius/filepicker%2fwv5vqx8nsb6yis93ghy5_raki.jpg ) . 
  there are some foods in turkish cuisine that go well with alcohol . 
  we call them meze . 
  please have a look at [ here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/meze ) for more information about mezes . 
  hello and welcome ,, 
  tea only grows up in eastern black sea region of turkey ( specifically [ rize ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rize ) ) . 
  i do n't know much about tea variations around the world but i think it 's different from teas that grow up in england . 
  we buy them from the stores . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.vavtedarik.com/image/cache/data/urunler/caykurrizeturist-500x500.jpg ) is an example 1kg . 
  tea package sold in the stores . 
  then we boil the water in a [ teapot ] ( http://akakce.cubecdn.net/emsan/emsan-aragon_2-x.jpg ) . 
  then we pour the boiled water onto the tea leaves and wait for it to steep . 
  it 's ready to drink !, 
  i love playing table tennis . 
  i think most people in turkey know baseball . 
  but we do n't have a national baseball league . 
  we know it from the american movies  . 
  i think one can find more beautiful girls after a short walk in the streets , but , [ tuba buyukustun ] ( https://www.google.com.tr/search?q=tuba+buyukustun&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=361yvawdhs-hyate-yhiag&amp;ved=0cacq_auoaq ) , [ beren saat ] ( https://www.google.com.tr/search?q=beren+saat&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=1111&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=-61yvdybmoscyqski4dgaw&amp;ved=0ci8beike ) and [ hazal kaya ] ( https://www.google.com.tr/search?q=hazal+kaya&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=1111&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=ha5yvfw3e4kn7aao-4g4cg&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0ci8beike ) are the most favored actresses . 
  hello . 
  yes , i know him . 
  he is the author of the book ` why nations fail ? ' . 
  i read his book last year and loved it . 
  i think he 's an academician at mit right now . 
  is secularism widespread in syria ? 
  please do n't misunderstand me because i also confront with this kind of questions when i go to europe . 
  currently , i 'm in izmir ( where i was born ) while most turkish women do n't wear hijab here , all syrian women , even 7-10 years old little girls i 've seen wear black hijab . 
  thanks for the answer . 
  very enlightening . 
  macrocenter ` larda london porter oluyor . 
  that probably means he is medically checked ( he is vaccinated , etc. ), 
  by the municipality 's veterinaries and he is healthy . 
  veterinaries generally use those tags to recognize if the dog is checked before or not . 
   another thing is that as both of my parents are alumni of odtu , they 've repeatedly told me of how hard the grading is in turkish universities . 
  i ca n't answer your question as i 'm a graduate of mechanical engineering . 
  but i can say your parents are 100 % right about that . 
  hey guys !, 
  do you often come across with people who confuse austria with australia ? 
  i 've met lots of french , english and american people doing that  . 
  is a better translation to turkish imo . 
  which means ,, 
  `` hello , thank you very much for following us from turkey ! '', 
  but if you want the exact translation of what you say ,, 
  `` hello and thank you very much for following us from turkey ! '', 
  means, 
  you 're welcome . 
  thanks for the gold  . 
  he is the true muslim and allah grants him every right to do that . 
  remember allah  rule of law . 
  i was talking about the mentality of akp/rte voters . 
  by the number of down votes , i think i was misunderstood . 
  lol . 
  thanks , i will do that when i ironize something next time . 
  hi and welcome , i 'm sure lots of people will help you to build a mega thread . 
  i will definitely visit your mega thread tomorrow . 
  also , i am wondering why should we hate you if you are a moderator of / r/europe ? 
  oh , so people hate you just because you are a moderator . 
  that 's sad . 
  i lol 'd the french part , i studied in france and i can understand what you mean there  . 
  wow , til poe 's law thanks . 
  i did n't know that . 
  hi , i can help you to flag violent , insulting , etc. 
  comments written in turkish . 
  however , i do n't know arabic ( i guess no-one on this sub does ) . 
  i will be available all day long after i vote in the morning . 
  you 're welcome  . 
  with the things i 've said and i 've done, 
  i got allah backing me up son, 
  cant you see im having a lot of fun, 
  so ba\u011fanne la \u00e7\u0131kmam saraydan, 
  welcome to izmir !, 
  izmir is my hometown and currently living in izmir for a scientific project . 
  you can ask me any question you want about izmir . 
  our lifestyle is more community-based compared to us . 
  so if you have an individualistic lifestyle , you may have a hard time acclimating our culture . 
  this is the only advice i can give to you . 
  by saying `` community based '' , i mean we develop closer social ties with our neighbors in an apartment or neighborhood compared to us ( lived in us for a year ) . 
  also , we have a more collectivistic society . 
  for example , do n't expect someone to respect your personal space ( it often happens ) , or sharing stuff with each other is considered very normal . 
  and one more advice , do n't say hello to a person you do n't know . 
  we only greet people we know . 
  i noticed most foreigners do that . 
   a rocket engine is a type of jet engine [ 1 ] that uses only stored rocket propellant mass for forming its high speed propulsive jet . 
  not specifically rocket design . 
  more like aerodynamic design of aircraft systems . 
  i am 100 % sure now , you get paid by akp . 
  ic yapisidir . 
   and izmir because of it 's people . 
  my favourite turks :d, 
  thanks . 
  we love you too  . 
  i do n't think you can receive your order until tomorrow if you shop from an online shop .
