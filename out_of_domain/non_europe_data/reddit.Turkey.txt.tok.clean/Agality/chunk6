  nope , i studied in turkey and france but took some courses in the us ( as an intern student ) during my master 's education in france . 
  with a 2 years degree , you will serve as a long term soldier ( 12 months ) . 
  a bachelors degree is required to qualify as a short term soldier ( 6 months ) . 
  those people are freedom fighters . 
  they are fighting against a fascist government + a horde of religious maniacs . 
  they can do whatever they want . 
  they can even attack civil people who have nothing to do with them . 
  turkey out of nato now !, 
  pkk ` nin da az bir etkisi vardir ama [ su ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3hyre9/politics_asylum_could_cost_germany_10bn_in_2015/cubriq1 ) sekilde dusunenler yuzunden zaten dusmanik uzun suredir var . 
  this is enough to not to read this article . 
  you are generalizing a whole nation with millions of people as racist . 
  you are basically racist too . 
  iran is aiding isis by executing kurds !!, 
  nuke iran now !!, 
  isis summer hits 2015, 
  the first music is asik veysel 's kara toprak ( dark soil ) . 
  original music video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cgangdzpj8, 
  ricardo moyano version of the song : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbaldndhkye, 
  the second music is haci faik bey - nihansin dideden . 
  haci faik bey is a famous turkish art music composer . 
  unfortunately there is not much information about him in english on the internet . 
  here is a modern interpretation of nihansin dideden : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lb-io1tkg0w, 
  with dns , you can access xhamster , thumbzilla and spankbang . 
  unfortunately you ca n't access xvideos without vpn . 
  i think the sites i mentioned above are enough for fapping 7/24 . 
   wait should n't this be the other way around ? 
  after all turkey assists isis by bombing the kurds . 
  a comment on facebook . 
  there are some laws that protect the copyright owner . 
  however , they are not enforced strictly . 
  so use torrent , ed2k , etc. 
  as you please . 
  afaik there are no problems with illegal islamic immigrants since they are using turkey like a bridge , from what i have heard , they immediately reach the aegean coastal cities and try to escape to greek islands . 
  no , i 've never heard a fight between the locals and the immigrants ( excluding syrian refugees ) . 
  if they want to reach kos island , they sail from mugla-bodrum . 
  to reach chios , they sail from izmir-cesme . 
  and to reach mythili , they sail from balikesir mostly . 
  by saying `` illegal islamic immigrants '' , i thought about afghan , paki , iranian people migrating to europe , not syrian refugees . 
  most syrians are legal ( in turkey at least ) and refugees . 
  lol . 
  one of my favorite series . 
  apparently the producers visited turkey . 
  edit : it has been a long time since i watched this series . 
  however i remember a city resembling istanbul in the series . 
  yes . 
  from cowboy bebop wiki :, 
   venus is modeled after 19th century istanbul , turkey . 
  i 'm a graduate of itu bsc . 
  still pursuing my phd studies at the same uni . 
  yes , it 's a high-ranked university , but in my opinion even an average us/canada/eu uni is much better than my university . 
  most of the professors have that `` public servant '' mindset . 
  they do n't do anything and still get paid by the state . 
  i think some universities in izmir and ankara can be better than itu in some fields . 
  as a itu student , i ca n't understand why ankara university is so close to us and ege and dokuz eylul are so far from us in the rankings . 
  maybe it 's not just rankings of engineering faculties . 
  [ meanwhile in / r/europe ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3qedrl/turkish_pm_davutoglu_turkish_military_struck_ypg/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link ) ,,

  neural networks and learning machines ( simon o. haykin ) is a decent book for starters . 
  since the last edition was published in 2009 , there is not much information about more recent topics such as deep belief networks , convolutional networks , etc. 
  but the fundamentals of the neural networks are well-covered in my opinion . 
  can you elaborate your question ? 
  are you trying to train a neural network with simulated annealing algorithm ? 
  yes , i think first you should start learning the fundamentals of each basic network such as feed-forward networks , recurrent networks , hopfield networks , boltzman machines , etc. 
  then delve into a more specific topic like lstm networks or deep networks , etc. 
  for example [ this ] ( http://goodfeli.github.io/dlbook/ ) is a decent source for learning deep neural networks . 
  you have to minimize a mse ( mean squared error ) function to compute the weights . 
  that mse function contains all the weights and biases as unknown parameters to be optimized . 
  also , training a network with simulated annealing is more like batch training . 
  so , you input all your dataset into the mse function and modify the weight and bias parameters at the same time for each iteration . 
  the main idea of training a neural network is updating all parameters at the same time whether you use a metaheuristic algorithm or not . 
  if you modify only few weights at each iteration , most likely some of the weights will be left untrained thus you will not get the results you want . 
  i got better results by using swarm-intelligence based metaheuristic algorithms since each particle in the swarm represents a parameter and more likely converge to global optimum . 
  i think the problem you are experiencing with simulated annealing is algorithm is stuck into a local minimum or can not find better solutions because of the acceptance rate . 
  maybe you should control the acceptance rate throughout the iterations to find better solutions . 
  final acceptance rate should be a lower value than 1/2 . 
  we are living in this country and most of the time westerners are lecturing us about what is happening in our country . 
  a bomb explodes in the middle of ankara , 100 people dies . 
  and then someone on the / r/worldnews / says `` i wish all of them would have died . 
  genocidial pigs '' . 
  then someone on / r/europe / says `` turkey is helping isis !!! '', 
  at the same news the minister says that they 've also bombed the isis positions but it does n't matter to a westerner . 
  we believe in a lie and we tell everyone lies . 
  it 's more like most of especially western europe is anti-turkish and believe in every negative things about turkey . 
  nowadays , news about a possible civil war in turkey is common in western media . 
  who knows what will they say next time . 
  it maybe about turks are helping ufos and a flying saucer has been seen in syria . 
  so they might be helping isis . 
  and turkey are also allied with isis via ufos . 
  next time if a bomb explodes in my hometown , come and lecture me with the things you read on your media please . 
  / u/atopha is back . 
  thanks !, 
  works for me . 
  i 'm using glasses too and i have driving license . 
  no problem . 
  i faced harsh racism during my studies in france just because i am a turk . 
  also i know the bataclan theatre area very well . 
  anyways , condolences to france even though most of them were frowning at me every time for no reason . 
  just after the paris attacks , people were talking about attacks in beirut and ankara did n't take so much attention of the ` west ' because people only care about ` their neighbors ' or ` people like them ' .
