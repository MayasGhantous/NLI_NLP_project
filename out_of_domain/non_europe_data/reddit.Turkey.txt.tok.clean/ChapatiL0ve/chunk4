  this hurts the poor and working class the most . 
  this is why the rich support mass immigration and `` diversity '' , because they have nothing to lose . 
   specifically speaking texas has had a massive growth in jobs mostly because of a large influx of immigrants . 
  i like to imagine this scenario as another way : whats a better metric of quality ? 
  total gdp or gdp per capita ? 
  where would you rather live , china with its huge gdp , or japan with its much higher gdp per capita ( and life quality ) ? 
  and those people are so few that it should not be the massive issue that it is . 
  oh yes , they do all this . 
  but in the meanwhile , the lower class non-immigrant people still have to deal with them ( because the rich live far away in gated communities not to deal with poor immigrants ) . 
  and how do you get two naturally unfriendly groups ( because poor citizens compete against those immigrants for jobs ) to `` tolerate '' each other ? 
  by telling us all about diversity and multiculturalism of course !, 
  and if you do n't like diversity and multiculturalism , you get branded the scarlet r !, 
  an ingenious plan by the wealthy if there ever was one . 
   sending troops to syria to drive al qaeda out, 
  should they ? 
  is al qaeda even the bad guy anymore ? 
  before they were terrorists and fought for their fellow muslims , now they are sided with america and fight against assad ? 
  i do n't know what to think . 
  the 98 % of the population that is not homosexual is more important . 
   the solution to this is to make legal immigration easier . 
  why ? 
  whats the purpose ? 
  to make it even easier for the rich to get their wage slaves ? 
   and last of all reform education and increase spending . 
  though thats a whole other can of worms . 
  it 's already been shown that increased spending does not help . 
  it was done in kansas city i believe . 
  the parents need to give a damn about their childrens education and the kids themselves need to care . 
  this is largely how so many poor asian immigrants can come to america and have the next generation become doctors and such . 
  tits of wife plz, 
  because they are n't neurotic fags like you ? 
  i 'm not a faggot nor am i 60 , and i thought it was just lame . 
  religion is not the cause of oppression , just something that makes it go along easier . 
  you only need to look to the man at the top of this page to see that oppression without religion is possible , and certainly just as deadly . 
  having a copy of a certain `` anti-semitic '' book also meant summary execution . 
  but jews are eternal victims though . 
  just how the hell exactly does someone become `` educated '' ? 
  by having an expensive university degree ? 
  hitler studied and read extensively . 
  your classism and hate for the poor is show . 
  also , lots of white privilege . 
   entitlement, 
  are you referring to the ones on welfare ? 
  it 's funny because dahmer had to say how he raped and cannibalized so many black kids not because they were black , and that he was not a racist . 
  this man , who was a rapist , killer , torturer , and cannibal , was still afraid of being called a racist . 
  it says so much about our society . 
  i know that feel bro . 
  maybe we should get off reddit , really ruins it . 
  you can dress however you want , and we can disparage you all we want . 
  my point is , this man was a rapist , killer , torturer , and cannibal , but was still afraid of the big scarlet r. 
  not all , just a significant amount , much more than white and asian men . 
  can you post your wallapapers pls ? 
   the most awesome thing you can do for us is treat us like one of the guys . 
  except you are not one of the guys and any man worth his salt will not do so . 
  i 'm one of the guys so it 's all good . 
  do people still play bf2 ? 
  i dont want to download several gb 's of patches to play on empty servers . 
   the ability to determine the outcome of a gameplay event in a video game should always be based off player skill ,, 
  fuck you newfag . 
  i did not expect slut shaming to happen on r/atheism . 
  mccarthy was right many times . 
  90 players ? 
  are all these even real people ? 
  i thought water cooling was supposed to be quiet ? 
  i was considering one because my cpu fan is so loud . 
  the h100 is not necessary for my level anyway . 
  i have a mid range cpu ( x4 955 ) and need a ultra-high end quiet cooler . 
  do you know anything good ? 
  sounds awfully expensive really , when all i need is to make my mid range cpu less noisy . 
  a full water cooling setup is just overkill . 
  do you know any good solutions ? 
  what cpu cooler is that ? 
   i could say more, 
  you ca n't because you lack the sufficient intelligence to formulate a response beyond shouting ` racist ' , which is one step away from an ad hominem anyway . 
  well i guess it 's just an easy method to dismiss someone , you know , kind of like calling them a racist . 
  not mad at all . 
  people who use this word to end debate and stifle discussion are intellectual lightweights . 
  yeah , i 'm racist , * but you do n't win the argument by shouting that * . 
  religion of peace !, 
  my point is , people do not do these things for their religion . 
  that may have been their stated reason , but how often are people consciously knowing of what they subconsciously do ? 
  christians did not colonize and oppress africa because they were christians , but because those people wanted wealth and power . 
  the same is true for followers of any religion . 
  it is always about wealth and power , even when they say it 's not . 
  this should be required reading for everyone in / r/worldnews, 
  [ do n't fall for the crazy fatwa -- it 's either false or just an opinion ] ( http://www.patheos.com/blogs/altmuslim/2013/01/dont-fall-for-the-crazy-fatwa-its-either-false-or-just-an-opinion/ ), 
   every male pashtun, 
  i 'm totally amazed somebody on worldnews knows this , and instead does n't blame it on every afghan or islam . 
  and i think any culture that assassinates it 's own civilians and remotely kills foreign citizens is fucked . 
  look at all your downvotes . 
  what the hell happened to this sub ? 
   are you seeing my point or is it completely lost upon you ? 
  look at his post history . 
  did you intentionally ignore all the other times the cia said iran had no nuclear weapons and no capability to build any ? 
  out of the 1.3 billion ** chinese ** in the world ( 22 % of the world ) , 5 have won nobel prizes . 
  ** conclusion ** : either the chinese are very dumb and uneducated , or the nobel prizes are not exactly fair . 
  i 'm glad you linked to thereligionofpeace.com, 
   the anti-islam hate site , the religion of peace ( trop ) , associated with islamophobe daniel greenfield , aka `` sultanknish , '' who you will recall earns a pretty penny from the david horowitz freedom center . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.loonwatch.com/2012/07/thereligionofpeace-com-working-to-streamline-the-american-empires-war-on-terror/ ), 
   you think this could ever happen if uae was secular ?
