  so making the title about fakes being made in turkey is nothing but a stupid attempt to clickbait through discrediting turkey . 
  article is not about fake passports made in turkey , they are about the passports being fake that 's it . 
  t\u00fcrk\u00e7e seems right !, 
  ( turkish ), 
  according to cnn turk , this picture shows the route of the downed jet . 
  they say the source is `` turkish military sources '' . 
  it was told in the live news report here in turkey that the jet was warned before entering turkish borders because of the way it was headed . 
  the hit happened inside , though . 
  nah man that 's impossible, 
  getting a country ? 
  fine . 
  getting their country ? 
  that sounds like it implies such a country would include cities currently in turkey . 
  yeah , welcome to / r/worldnews, 
  turkey does n't support isis , just because one guy said so without conrete evindence does n't mean we support isis . 
  also it 's not turkey if it 's the smugglers that buy oil from isis . 
  we have nothing against kurds . 
  however , we have everything against anyone related to pkk in anyway . 
  we do n't care if they are fighting isis . 
  we do n't choose between two devils . 
  that 's an interior matter of turkey , should n't even interest you or bother you , let alone being a reason to kick turkey out . 
  sorry to disappoint you but nothing 's been proven . 
  i see you are talking about the trucks . 
  they were headed to syria , yes , however at that time there were no isis dominance and the exact destination of these trucks were never made public . 
  man , he will never be able to prove it . 
  he does n't have any proof . 
  i believe he is just one of the people who does n't even live close to the area and looks at the map and say `` oh turkey must be supporting isis '' . 
  he does n't have any idea how hard it is for turkey to maintain that border security , he does n't know what kind of shit goes down there . 
  most people here in reddit have no kinds of insights about what 's happened or happening in turkey . 
  they do n't know about its past , they do n't know about its people , they do n't know about its interests . 
  all they know is from some bullshit anti-government turkish news sites that are not even considered a quality source in turkey but assumed credible when it comes to shitting turkey . 
  most of what they know are pure speculations served masterfully without any evidence . 
  yeah i 'm aware of that . 
  i already said we know they were headed to syria . 
  when they have a hard drive and say `` we have documents proving that '' , that 's a ** claim ** . 
  when they actually publish these documents , that 's ** proving ** . 
  turkey has actually released a radar image of the flight path of the russian jet and us&nato officials confirmed it as well . 
   erdogan 's claims that he never supported isis despite the ** evidence ** thus far , etc. . . 
  that 's the point . 
  there is no evidence . 
  there is no sense in putting a sentence like that when there is no evidence . 
  at best , it is a guess . 
  what erdogan said is simple , if you have proof , release it . 
  that 's that . 
  there is no point in claiming something you say you have the proof of without actually releasing the proof . 
  your `` source '' only mentions word `` turk '' just once and here is that portion :, 
  `` the most important thing about the raid is not getting abu sayyaf ; it 's getting his records , '' harvey said . 
  harvey asserted that sayyaf was one of isis 's top financiers , with likely access to the group 's contacts with banks , donors , ** turkish ** and lebanese business interests as well as links to criminal and smuggling networks . 
  harvey said sayyaf had undeniable value as a target because isis is also a business . 
  and that does n't prove anything . 
  at best , these turkish business interests are just smugglers and that does n't mean turkey supports isis . 
  secretary general : the allied assessments we have got from several allies during the day are consistent with information we have been provided with from turkey . 
  so the information we have from other allies is consistent with what we have got from turkey . 
  so what 's about it ? 
  the plane violated the airspace in spite of the warnings , but ignored them and shot . 
  that 's it . 
  do n't ignore the rest of the question . 
  the airspace was violated by the plane and it was shot , as per the engagement rules that turkey announced a couple of years ago . 
  all nato confirmed was that turkey airspace was in fact violated and it had the right to defend its borders . 
  note that at the time of violation , the plane was unknown . 
  totally wrong . 
  they said other information provided by other allies is consistent with what turkey provided , is n't that enough ? 
  you do n't even know why turkey shot down that russian jet . 
  you have no idea , do n't you ? 
  yes , take pride in dreaming of what ataturk tried to build destroyed . 
  two years ago , when one of the training jets of turkey was shot down by syria , turkey changed its rules of engagement regarding the syria region , saying they will shoot down any planes that do not heed to the warnings . 
  what happened was two rusian bomber jets were in route to turkish airspace and they were warned a couple of times 30 miles before entering turkish airspace . 
  there are also claims that this was their second entering to turkish airspace . 
  so , one plane changed its course after the warnings , however the other one did not , despite the 10 warnings in 5 minutes and it was shot by turkish f16s upon reentering ( supposedly ) turkish airspace . 
  also the russian jet had its transponder off so it was an unidentified jet to turkish air force at the time . 
  they did n't know it was russian . 
  nobody cares about what that russian jet was doing in syria . 
  russia can nuke syria for all i care . 
  also i 'm pretty sure you have lots of concrete evidence that prove turkey buys oil from isis . 
  did you even read what you sent ? 
  ** us says `` syria '' is buying oil from is . 
  what you people should do is to learn facts before posting comments . 
  protocol is ** not ** what you said it is . 
  not for turkey regarding the syria region . 
  turkey made it clear years ago when it changed its rules of engagement that any planes violating its airspace will be shot down without further notice . 
  russia did know that and still violated the airspace . 
  further more , turkey showed patience when it knew it was a russian plane , however this time , it was a jet with transponder off so it was an unidentified jet for turkey . 
  also it was the rebels who shot down the copilot , not turkey . 
  sorry but this way of thinking is wrong . 
  i know when it is about turkey-hating , people are trying to find ways to make russia look right . 
  but ffs , stop acting like it is ok to violate airspaces of other countries . 
  just because russia always violates others ' airspaces and does n't get shot down does n't mean that they have the right to do that . 
  russia did that before and apologized , promising that it wo n't happen again , but they did it again they got fucking shot down . 
  you do n't fuck with a nation who explicitly declared two years ago that serious consequences will follow if their airspace is violated . 
  by the way please stop this `` 17 seconds '' crap . 
  they were warned for 5 minutes before entering . 
  and what , should they have waited for the plane to have enough time to bomb somewhere ? 
  this is n't a fucking game . 
  it 's an unidentified bomber . 
  what would you have them do ? 
  `` oh , wait , let 's see if that plane bombs somewhere , then we 'll shoot . '', 
  so much for `` next gen '', 
  it has been made clear times and times again that ;, 
  1 ) turkey did n't know it was a russian plane at the time of shoot-down . 
  it was unidentified .
