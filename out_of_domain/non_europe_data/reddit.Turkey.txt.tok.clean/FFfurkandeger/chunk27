  so he cares about beating both . 
  that 's nice . 
  omfg , when are you stupid people gon na understand that turkey only hates pkk , which happens to be a kurdish terrorist organisation , not the whole kurdish population ? 
  have you tried it with a different charger or/and cable ? 
  standard procedure in such situations would be to do so , so please check these first . 
  usually it 's not the charging port but there 's no saying without eliminating the possibility of the charger and/or the cable being the culprit . 
  as far as i know during the process you download android source code which is huge . 
  a little unrelated , but how do you run it in the first place ? 
  mine fails to install . 
  nevermind , i thought it was something different but turns out i already have it in my mm rom . 
  they really believed that the us would back them to the end ? 
  huh . 
  amateurs . 
  this was supposed to add turkish language support to the game . 
  am i missing something or is it not included in the changelog ? 
  what 's going on ? 
  what 's this ? 
  looks like it 's been removed ? 
  does anyone have a mirror ? 
  it 's sarcasm . 
  come to turkey , we have cookies . 
  yeah this please . 
  just bring the new camera with manual controls and no shutter lag to z5 and i 'll die a happy man . 
  yeah , middle east would be in peace now if us were able to find some things `` acceptable '' . 
  perhaps for a change they should not meddle with it . 
  fyi , turkey 's border with isis has shrunk from 54 km to 9 km since the start of operation .

  i think they have more of an effect on focusing, 
  steve rogers ? 
  i have xperia z5 now . 
  had optimus g before . 
  xperia z5 does everything i can think of better than optimus g , 
  uhmm ... what ? 
  to be fair joker 's plan failed . 
  lex is a psychotic . 
  he has a problem `` of superman '' , a problem of god . 
  the conversation between him and superman makes sense because that 's just the kind of man he is . 
  he * needed * to make superman bow before him . 
  it 's not just about killing or disproving superman , it 's also about announcing his superiority over god , over superman . 
  they did talk enough . 
  batman did n't give a shit . 
  as snyder said , two men in costumes talking would n't work . 
  they were there to fight , not talk . 
  `` no one stays good in this world . '', 
  he was there to fight . 
  he still wanted to see if there was any hope of getting bruce to help . 
  but it was clear bruce was not going to listen . 
  why is not enabled in the us in the first place ? 
  what exactly is wrong with those pictures ? 
  and how are other # 600 handsets better ? 
  i 'd like to see it do that on a straight track . 
  i was n't trying to compare it to a dslr - that would be foolish . 
  i was just trying to emphasize that this bike was probably slow considering it was taking a turn , 
  got ta see the faces of those americans claiming turkey supports isis lol . 
  but ... 
  but turkey supports isis :( ( ( ( (, 
  by the way , is this manual shutter speed ? 
  never seen xperia camera app do 1/2000 on superior auto . 
  seems so indeed !, 
  did n't notice the 1/2000 exposure , my bad , 
  interesting !, 
  got ta make some tests with manual camera tomorrow to see how much light i can capture with 1/2000 shutter speed . 
  a shame we have to use manual settings for this . 
  i chose harvey . 
  i do n't know , choosing selina was also an option and it was really hard to make a choice , but in the end i ended up saving harley . 
  yeah , getting laid sounds nice and all , but i just could n't get the batman mindset out of my mind . 
  selina is a woman who knows how to take care of herself ; dent is not . 
  considering he is the future of gotham he was a no brainer for me . 
  ( though , for sure , in the end he 's gon na end up being two-face but i like to act as if i did n't know that 's gon na happen ) . 
  it just felt like `` batman '' would n't go for selina in such a dilemma , he would have gone after dent . 
  the mission comes first . 
  i do n't really consider the batman in the dark knight series as `` the batman '' . 
  he is more like a ninja in a batman suit . 
  even if i did , it 's still a movie . 
  edit : thanks for the downvotes guys , really appreciate it . 
  welcome to / r/worldnews , where experts thousands of miles away from you knows your region , people and traditions better than you despite having no idea about them at all . 
  you sure you did n't `` accidentally '' hit it ha us ? 
  `` storming '', 
  the headline is bullshit . 
  they make it sound like an organized team of 10 attackers tried to capture the embassy ... 
  while the truth is just a stupid man tried to rush with a knife shouting ` allah akbar ' before he was shot in the leg and neutralized . 
  so they waited for them to graduate ? 
  caught one !, 
  well , i just used the link and applied . 
  logged in with my gog account and then the game was added to my gog account . 
  yeah , well , it took ... * a few * tries ... 
  no keys involved . 
  after pressing the apply button , you are asked to log in to your gog account . 
  after you successfully login , the game is automatically added to your account . 
  ah , they also send you an e-mail like a receipt . 
  so i guess entering the same mail address with your gog account might speed things up a bit . 
  give it another 100 times and then * maybe * you can see the login screen :p, 
  that is , if you can access the website lol, 
  so ... is it gon na be a 7-day booster or what ? 
  what ? 
  who ? 
  i did n't ask for anything :p i was just ... that was just ... nothing really :p, 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^ would n't ^ ^ ^ ^ mind ^ ^ ^ ^ some ^ ^ ^ ^ boosters ^ ^ ^ ^ though, 
  yeah , it 's not really about getting the same general result in the story for me . 
  it 's about roleplaying the batman ,
