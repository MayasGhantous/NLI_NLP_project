  a 50 watts bulp warms the basking area while a exo terra repti glo 5.0 provides the uvb lights . 
  here is a picture of the tank and the basking area on top of it ( also a bonus picture of my girl basking ) :, 
  if it were up to me i would have gotten a 120 gallon tank ( or even more ) from the beginning , but there was limited space in the house and so i had to get a 50 gallon one . 
  i will definitely consider upgrading the tank in the future when i have more space ( possibly with a new house ) . 
  i only give her apples or bananas occasionally , so that should be ok . 
  she laid her eggs into the tank before and did n't seem bothered by it so i did n't prepare a nesting place ; but i will surely do this next time she needs to lay eggs . 
  again , thank you for your insights !, 
  much appreciated !, 
  is this p3d ? 
  that 's no moon ... 
  you sure that happens everytime ? 
  like * every mission * ? 
  or is it just that you are trying the same mission again and again ? 
  if so , press z , which will disable autopilot which comes enabled as the mission starts . 
  the briefing probably mentions that . 
  can confirm . 
  can confirm this . 
  i would recommend you let it dry though . 
  excess heat can cause some bad things . 
  not to discredit you or anything , but that 's probably an individual problem . 
  so it was a goal , right ? 
  right ? 
  uhm , i was born in gaziantep and to this day i am still in gaziantep ( i am 23 ) . 
  no bombings here , nothing apocalyptic , really . 
  and i do n't know about this twitter account or what its tweets are about , but if there are any videos/pictures you can link to me , i can tell you if it is gaziantep or not . 
  pretty sure what cisco vibed to was shown an episode later . 
  i think op means vixen that appeared in arrow . 
  as in the vixen we have right now in lot is the old vixen and the vixen that appeared in the arrow last season is the new vixen . 
  [ remember ? 
  ] ( http://screencrush.com/442/files/2016/02/arrow-vixen-pic.jpg ), 
  yes . 
  just checked the scenes and they seem to be different .

  this . 
  have a downvote , friend . 
  could be your wi-fi, 
  fyi though , even if everything was set-up to give the best image quality , streaming through steam link has its quality limitations . 
  so , do n't ever expect the same quality you see on your pc monitor from steam link . 
  oh yes . 
  i use link with a 4k tv as well and you 're right you need to get up close to see the compression artifacts . 
  but that does n't necessarily mean that they are n't there . 
  they are . 
  yup . 
  i definitely see much less pixellation/artifacts on my link with 50 mbps . 
  could it be something with youtube or whatever he used to capture video from link ? 
  there * is * a noticable difference , but his stream is nowhere near what i see on my link . 
  i guess it 's youtube then ? 
  is this true though ? 
  i am not quite so sure , but i do n't think i have noticed any difference in terms of colors in my streams . 
  how can we understand it 's in limited or not ? 
  well , thanks for the info on that . 
  the problem is i do not have another pc to stream to . 
  subbed . 
  yeah it 's strange . 
  i 'll show him your screenshot , but he is really stubborn and will probably say `` that 's a still image , there is no action , so the quality being high is expected . 
  it wo n't be like this when there is fast-paced action on screen . '', 
  yeah , been there , done that  that video , even when the quality set to 1080p60fps , has lots of artifacting and pixellation which are not seen in my link . 
  anyways , thanks for your help . 
  i will try to find a pc which i can stream to and take a screenshot from there . 
  that seems to be the most plausible option . 
  that 's pkk/tak ' m.o. 
  i was thinking more of a scapegoat ( taking the blame for studios stupid editing ) , but that works as well, 
  matt damon as talia is spot on .

  edit :, 
  video is down ?? 
  edit2 : updated translation . 
  and the video seems to be up . 
  edit3 : adding the arabic part , too . 
  originally did n't add because it was arabic and it would n't be a translation , but here goes . . 
  yes , it sounded to me like `` beldelerimiz '' as well . 
  updating the translation accordingly . 
  well , did n't want to include that part since it was obvious . 
  also i do n't know arabic so can not translate that part . 
  as a turkish person , he sounded very turkish to me . 
  updated the translation to include those parts as well . 
  the original reason i did n't include them was because op asked for a translation and i know turkish , not arabic . 
  nevermind , now that part is included too . 
  i do n't know what exactly he says but i think it is obvious it is from quran . 
  he is muslim and he is turkish . 
  mevlut mert alt\u0131nta\u015f , he was a member of turkish riot police of ankara since 2014 . 
  22 years old , born in s\u00f6ke , ayd\u0131n . 
  that is very likely .
