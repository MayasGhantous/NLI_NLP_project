  i was able to unlock the disabled two cores of it with no issues to make it a phenom ii x4 b55 and i used it with an overclock of 4 ghz on all cores for a long time . 
  i know these guys . 
  the one on the left is a tech editor with one of the most articles published in the world . 
  he actually has done a couple of world exclusives . 
  they know their stuff . 
  edit : here are a couple of the world exclusives from the guy himself , erdi ozuag . 
  that was a big one : https://www.donanimhaber.com/diger/haberleri/dunya'da-ilk-amd-phenom-ii-x3-720-black-edition-incelemesi.htm, 
  d\u00fcnyada ilk defa means first in the world in turkish . 
  that 's roughly what they say in the video . 
  but i would like to clear up some things . 
  i do n't think he says he wo n't bother with manual oc anymore . 
  he says `` i can reach a fairly nice overclock with one click . 
  you do n't need to bother with manual oc '', 
  he explicitly states that sc performance is still behind 7700k , but with oc and in one specific test it passes even 7700k in single core performance . 
  he also says with oc , the cpu has simply no competition and that not even 10 core 6950x can keep up with the ryzen when oc ` ed . 
  quoting my own post about the reliability of the source for visibility :,

  thank you for your post , though . 
  i have a 4790k as well ( and i previously had 4690k on the same setup ) and i was about to go crazy with my cpu reaching 80 degrees on 1.220 v in stress tests ( actually aida64 . 
  ibt is a different story ) with my noctua nh-u14s , while everyone else seems to be able to hit 4.8 ghz on like 1.30 with their 212 evo . 
  i ca n't push more than 4.5 !, 
  sure if i did 1.30 v maybe i can but there is simply no headroom !, 
  my old 4690k was the same . 
  and we 're talking about a cooler on corsair h110 levels . 
  geez . 
  yeah but i did stop playing . 
  this is really getting out of control and ubisoft is not responsible at all . 
  who the fuck thinks it 's a good idea to release-match all platforms ? 
  i 'm looking at you , ubisoft executive ( s ) who think that this is a good idea . 
  you , you are big fucking moron . 
  if there is a game-braking bug , just fucking release a hotfix already . 
  i do n't fucking care if you have to wait for the consoles , i do n't play on consoles . 
  fix your shit or do n't expect me to buy anything from you . 
  i 'm so pissed . 
  it 's fucking raaaaaaaaaaaw, 
  i 'm not saying fuck all the people on consoles . 
  i wish all platforms could get hotfixes fast . 
  i understand if consoles have to wait for cert process or whatever it is , but pc does n't have to do that . 
  what 's the point of it anyways ? 
  the game is n't cross-platform ... perhaps preparing separate updates for pc could be time consuming for the devs , but i am just suggesting test on pc first then release it on consoles kind of model . 
  well if there are people who sold their 7700k for ryzen 1800x and they planned to use that system mainly for gaming ... 
  they deserve the moment of silence . 
  imagine this . 
  you are a gamer . 
  you have a 7700k with a decent motherboard and a decent pair of rams . 
  amd announces a cpu with 8c/16t at the performance level of 6900k on but around 10 % worse than 7700k on single thread ( which obviously is what games rely on ) . 
  you suddenly decide it 's a good idea to sell your perfectly working and performing intel cpu and motherboard to buy a more expensive 8c/16t cpu along with a compatible motherboard only to get slightly worse performance in games . 
  you are a gamer . 
  you do not do anything else . 
  well , this is stupid anyways . 
  you did n't need to see the benchmarks to decide that it was going to be a stupid decision back when there were only amd 's results . 
  it makes zero-fucking sense . 
  it makes sense if you were looking to buy a 6900k . 
  it will also make sense when r5 cpus are finally on the market ( because they will be - reportedly - substantially cheaper than 7700k while probably maintaining 1800x level of performance on gaming ) . 
  but in my humble opinion , these results were expected and comparing 1800x or 1700x to 7700k in gaming just because they are around the same price is wrong . 
  sure , if you have x dollars and you intend to buy a gaming cpu for that price , it makes sense . 
  but 1800x or 1700x is like a 6900k that is cheaper . 
  does 6900k perform better than 7700k ? 
  do we expect it to that ? 
  is it still more expensive than 7700k ? 
  yes . 
  that just means different cpus have different uses . 
  i bet when there are r5 cpus that are up to 150 $ cheaper than 7700k with slightly less gaming performance , we 'll see the competition . 
  so the absolute measurement of performance are ... games ? 
  yeah , no . 
  because in games single thread performance matters and 1600x , 1500x or even 1400x are the same cpus as 1800x when it comes to single thread performance , but with less cores in total and therefore lower price ( 1600x - 6c/12t , 1400x 4c/8t ), 
  you say that like all other reviews are done with low settings 720p . 
  they all use 1080p ultra . 
  new video of raw benchmark cuts is up :, 
  ~ ~ as far as i know they use gtx 1080 ~ ~ it 's titan x ( computerbase.de ), 
  is n't it 4 % ? 
  altough this is a gpu bottleneck and do not exactly reflect cpu performance , it still has something to show here . 
  people are talking about joker 's review like it 's the only one out there that has a gpu bottleneck . 
  take gamersnexus for example . 
  here is their watch dogs 2 test :, 
  now this is done with gtx 1080 . 
  take not that it 's 1080p with high settings . 
  here 's the computerbase.de 's watch dogs 2 test :, 
  this is done with titan x. 
  on full hd or even on hd , ryzen is on lead against 7700k . 
  they did . 
  they used a gigabyte mobo as well . 
  i guess we 'll wait and see . 
  this should be upvoted . 
  one reply to the stream sums it up for me and i think it 's a good tl ; dr :, 
   according to the video , joker 's benchmark is n't wrong . 
  the main reason there are discrepancies with the benchmarks is that not everyone 's hardware was working properly . 
  joker was able to get his ram to run at 3000 mhz , but a lot of other reviewers had a hard time doing that . 
  then you get other issues with uefi and possibly microcode for the architecture . 
  overall , it means there are a lot of bugs to be fixed , and it seems like joker 's bench is what other reviewers should have been showing if their hardware worked properly . 
  my conclusion is that this launch was rushed by amd before a lot of issues were ironed out . 
  so you think other reviewers like gamersnexus had gpu ( gtx 1080 ) working at 80 % or something when they shared ryzen 's 1080p high settings results ? 
  i know people tend to think `` ohhh it 's a bottleneck '' when they see something running at 99 % but that is wrong . 
  i have a 4790k and i never ever see anything below 99 % gpu usage but my frames are not as high as a gtx 980 with 7700k .
