  i am not dropping below 144 fps ( with vsync on and fps limited to 144 ) on ultra settings with a ryzen 1700 and gtx 980 . 
  i think there is still something wrong . 
  i have just finished a match against bots ( 4v4 ) at aquadome and i have not even once - dropped below 144 . 
  i then went further ahead and disabled vsync and 144 fps limit and the average was 170-180ish fps . 
  here you can check the screenshots : http://imgur.com/a/zvywn, 
  damn nvidia ... 
  your ram version ? 
  i mean the version . 
  check this ram for example : https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e2/2014_corsair_vengeance_2x4gb%2c_1600mhz.jpg, 
  it says ver 2.12 on this . 
  mine is i think 4.24 and there is also 5.3 x. 
  the only difference is i 'm using my 1700 at 4.0 ghz right now . 
  i have gtx 980 at 1516 mhz gpu , 1937 mhz memory clock . 
  i have geforce 381.65 as the gpu driver . 
  imo 1600x is the best chip not because it is superior to r7s , but because its price/performance ratio is great . 
  imagine if they did n't reveal wonder woman at all and we all thought gal gadot was just playing cat woman or something ... 
  * sigh ... *, 
  what is your ram version ? 
  yeah thanks . 
  5.39 is hynix , 4.24 is samsung e-die . 
  unfortunately mine is 4.24 so i can not reach those speeds ( at least yet ) . 
  stuck at 2666 mhz . 
  yeah ... f5 bios on gigabyte x370 gaming 5 . 
  4.24 is dual rank so i guess i 'm gon na have to wait for amd 's may update ... 
  nope . 
  i 'm using a noctua nh-u14s . 
  i 'm actually at 4.0 ghz at around 1.406 v. 
  if they only gave us subtiming editing ... 
  when there are gpus capable of 4k 144hz , it wo n't be any different than today 's full hd 144 hz in terms of cpu bottlenecking . 
  i 'm just trying to state the fact that 4k shows no difference with different cpus now , because the current bottleneck are the gpus . 
  so 4k is not going to tax the gpu way more heavily , it just does it for now . 
  yes . 
  with ax370 gaming 5 . 
  gigabyte does n't seem to care so far since i have not been able to get any response from them regarding the issue . 
  why , hell no . 
  for me the only workaround is to use an external pci express sound card for the front panel unfortunately . 
  tell that to kanjiklub . 
  it 's strange ... 
  ryzen 1700 @ 3.9 ghz with 1.375 v , corsair vengeance lpx 2666 mhz cl16 and nvidia gtx 980 . 
  normally i get around 70-90 fps on average , but with prime95 running on the background it 's around 60 fps . 
  i was just running stress tests and figured it would be nice to play something on top of the test . 
  i am impressed . 
  what hits me is there is absolutely no stutter , frame skiping at all . 
  wow . 
  i ditched my 4790k to get r7 1700 and i absolutely love it !, 
  surely , yes !, 
  you 're right , fps does not really matter at all . 
  what 's incredible is the frametime . 
  that there is no spiking is just amazing work really . 
  my old 4790k would stutter the hell out of it if i tried to play anything while the core loads are 100 % . 
  i do n't remember there being an option for chromatic aberration in the game , but i will check as soon as i have a chance . 
  pretty sure it also has to do with zen as well , since my old i7 would stutter badly in the same situation . 
  nope . 
  there are other aspects , other articles that are the most controversial . 
  for example with the new constitution , the president can assign anyone as his vice president and there is no limit on the number of vice presidents he can assign . 
  he can assign every member of his family as his vice presidents with no approval from parliament . 
  the vice president ( s ) has exactly the same power as the president , when the president is abroad , absent or dead . 
  yes . 
  game mode is disabled though . 
  noctua likes this . 
  not sure if relevant but , i once had a friend , who , after realizing it would take sooo much time to download a game since it was big , asked me to send the game through msn messenger to him so he did n't have to download . 
  it was hard to explain . 
  jar jar binks, 
  this . 
  this referendum only makes what 's been the situation in turkey for 10 + years legal . 
  you were just too hot for glaz . 
  common issue , along with front panel audio crackling . 
  gigabyte has yet to respond regarding . 
  one hand , luke, 
  the question is , can 480 run at reference speeds at much lower voltage as well ? 
  manual - you set timings on channel a and it applies it to channel b as well . 
  advanced manual - you set timings on both channels separately . 
  for me the installed version was stated as 16.60 , while the new version seems to be 17.10 . 
  as to the changelog , i do not know but this chipset seems to slightly improve the audio crackling issue i had on the front panel with gigabyte x370 gaming 5 . 
  still experiencing audio crackling , but now less often . 
  perhaps / u/djanikowski 's theory was correct . 
  ( https://www.reddit.com/r/amd/comments/61mv95/aorus_ax370_gaming_5_owners_any_issues_strange/dffp28q/ ), 
  i have an nvidia gpu and fps is great for me ? 
  no different than my previous 4790k ? 
  well if he was unstable , within windows , chipset driver * may * help . 
  if you can not boot at all though , it 's impossible for chipset drivers to have an effect . 
  i mean i may get an fps increase in borderless , but as a matter of fact i do n't need it . 
  i can reach 200 fps already . 
  some benchmarks show rocket league performing really bad with a 1080 or 1070 or even 1060 . 
  then here i am at the same frames as my old 4790k , with r7 1700 and gtx 980 . 
  yup , do n't have a b350 , but my x370 takes just too long to boot up compared to what i 'm used to . 
  fast boot set to ultra fast and it takes 10 seconds until i can see windows loading logo . 
  my previous intel system took 10 seconds into the desktop with the same ssd . 
  instagram !, 
  do you have a mobo speaker ? 
  also , what is the last debug code you see before each reset ? 
  try to get one if you can , those things really help out with such issues . 
  so how does that work ? 
  what tv exactly is it for ? 
  i 'm assuming this tv has a displayport and it does n't normally support freesync ? 
  it took mine a week . 
  i 'm in turkey though . 
  thanks !, 
  i 'll give it a go . 
  meh , it 's just a soft brick , boot once and save settings with one stick ram on a different slot then you will be back on your feet .
