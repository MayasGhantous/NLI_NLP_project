  soooo , this pretty much confirms that rey had actually jedi/force training , which she forgot . 
  right ? 
  and then , boom , awakening . 
  suddenly i realized that and boy , am i excited !, 
  i 'm an old player who enjoyed the free content when the game went free2play , but then after reaching 30 lvl me and a friend of mine stopped playing because in pve dungeons we felt too weak ( in terms of dmg etc. ), 
  and in pvp people one hitted us . 
  we felt like the game was pay to win back then however now thinking on it , we 've come to argue whether it was actually pay to win or not . 
  my friend still thinks it 's heavily pay to win , however ; i 'm inclined to believe that it was actually not and i can not back my claim as i do n't remember many things about the game . 
  so , what do you think ? 
  it may sound strange , however this just happened to me and i thought i could share it with you guys . 
  so i have a zotac gtx980 amp !, 
  omega . 
  i have been recently interested in overclocking it . 
  however , the temps seemed not as low as it should be , with gpu spiking to 90-91 in mere seconds in furmark if i set the temp limit to 91 . 
  also if i did n't set it to 91 , it would downclock even at stock speeds . 
  i thought maybe thermal compound was the problem , so i went ahead reapplied it . 
  no improvements . 
  then , i saw a reply to a post in a random forum , urging people to prop up their gpus . 
  i did n't think that was my problem but i said what the hell , i 'll go ahead and put some stick to hold it up . 
  temps were instantly down in furmark , with 82 degrees max @ 1516mhz core/4000mhz memory . 
  now i do n't see anything above 70 degrees in games . 
  ** tl ; dr : ** guys , do n't ignore your gpu sagging , put something underneath , prop it up , it might adversely affect gpu temps in some cases .

  first of all , let me make it clear that i loved the movie . 
  i 'm talking about the scene where lex creates doomsday . 
  he takes zod 's body to the pool of some alien liquid and with zod 's fingertips he * somehow * takes control of the ship and * convinces it * to revive zod . 
  wtf ? 
  how can you go into an alien ship , which has an english audio interface , and convince it to revive zod , just with the logic of `` krypton committee does no longer exist . '', 
  that was stupid . 
  first of all , my device is lg optimus g e975 , which as some of you may know is practically a nexus 4 hardware-wise . 
  as some of you may have heard , turkey launched 4.5 g ( lte-advanced ) services on april 1st . 
  since then many lg optimus g users have been using lte on their phone , except i can not . 
  i desperately need help trying to solve my problem . 
  and although i am open to all kinds of suggestions , as i believe i 've tried everything on the software side , i think this is on the hardware side . 
  one thing that leads me to believe that this is hardware related is that i 've recently changed the rear camera module and the back cover of my phone ( before 4.5 g ) . 
  i might have caused something to go wrong . 
  i was on resurrection remix v5 .6.7 with solid kernel 2.0 when i noticed lte did n't work . 
  here are the things i 've tried so far :, 
  * tried flashing eu v20a modem, 
  * flashed different kernels, 
  * tried eu open v20a and turkey v20a kdz, 
  * tried lteconfigs.apk on stock rom and other stock based roms, 
  * various flashings and build.prop edits that i can not remember ... 
  keep in mind that i 've already made sure that my service provider enabled lte for me and have succesfully tried my new sim card on a different phone ( which is a g2 btw ) . 
  my apn settings are correct . 
  everything else works ( edge , 3g , h , h + ) . 
  also keep in mind that people in my country are using lte with their optimus g 's and all they had to do was either install an lteconfigs apk or flash a custom rom . 
  here is what i see when i set my connection to lte only : http://i.imgur.com/uqccjbs.jpg, 
  i 'm looking for possible damaged parts i can change . 
  i can not change the main pcb that 's for sure , however i can change other parts such as main antenna at the bottom , two cables parallel to the battery , maybe sim card slot ( though i do n't see any physical damage on any of these ) . 
  i 've already changed the rear camera , battery , usb flex and the back cover . 
  i 'm aware that back cover contains a couple of antennas and you might think the new cover i 've got is counterfeit or damaged , however the original backcover does n't help as well ( i changed it because of the camera lens ) . 
  i 'm desperately in need of your knowledge on parts that may cause problems on lte connection . 
  as a kid i used to play this game along with dx-ball and moorhuhn . 
  you control a ball-like figure ( perhaps with a helicopter like rotor on top ) in a square like map and i believe you cut pieces off the map as you try to make sure a snake like figure is n't on the piece you cut off . 
  i think the more pieces you could successfully cut off , the more points you earned . 
  that 's unfortunately all i can remember . 
  i remember it was in 3d , however i also remember many other variations of the same game existed in 2d etc. 
  i think this is kinda spoiler-ish , but ... 
  they were n't even joking . 
  well played , cdpr . 
  are there any console commands or such to go back to the land of a thousand fables ? 
  this affects all lg phones with official kitkat software . 
  how to reproduce : just scroll into a video on instagram using an lg phone with official android kitkat installed . 
  any idea on how to solve this ? 
  formatting , wiping etc. 
  does n't work obviously . 
  so a couple of days ago , i plugged in a usb hub with a wrong external power adapter into my computer via the front facing usb ports and it instantly caused my pc to shut down . 
  when turned back on , all the rear ports except for the sound inputs and ps/2 were not working . 
  but that 's not all , also my g710 + is not powering up !, 
  it blinks for a second ( cap leds ) and then windows says unidentified device . 
  what to do ? 
  what should i do ? 
  i rma 'd it and am waiting for a replacement , but it will probably take more than 3 days for the replacement unit to be delivered to me . 
  at this point i do n't even know if the rma was approved , so i will certainly miss the free upgrade date . 
  i had already upgraded to windows 10 with that motherboard from windows 8.1 pro . 
  i assume my activation will get revoked once i replace the motherboard . 
  so what do you think i should do ? 
  is there a chance microsoft support grant me a new licence or activate my old license ? 
  or am i gon na have to buy a new win 10 license ? 
  the title is self explanatory . 
  there is a bug with android mm which causes android os to keep the phone awake . 
  the only workaround seems to be restarting the phone after unplugging the charger . 
  otherwise android os keeps the phone awake . 
  can reproduce it using a z5 with 6.0.1 . 
  edit : workaround does n't really work . 
  it just makes it appears so . 
  when checked using betterbatterystays , i can see the phone still stays awake the same .
