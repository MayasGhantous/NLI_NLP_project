  i have the same problem , with the latest build ( 10122 ) and i am running amd 15.4 beta drivers for windows 8.1 x64 on an r9 290x . 
  this seems to occur in chrome ( with hardware acceleration enabled ) and some other video players . 
  for the time being , i suggest using potplayer as it does n't seem to have this issue . 
  i also experience this with popcorn time . 
  how do you disable it ? 
  not to my knowledge . 
  well , not sure about it . 
  i use an r9 290x . 
  i had the previous windows 10 version before , which was released on may 15th . 
  try to force manual update by checking updates manually . 
  also , if you used ddu before , it might have set auto install to disabled . 
  i have just the opposite :\\, 
  i would n't say lagging , but i have fps drops out of the city . 
  in the city it 's about 50-60 fps while in the countryside it drops down to 30 ~ fps . 
  most probably because of the grass , though . 
  i do and that might be the reason of these drops as well . 
  thank you , i will try turning them off . 
  yup . 
  i constantly see bugs such as :, 
  * no icons or tiles, 
  * no colors or tiles , just text, 
  * nothing , everything 's black, 
  * nothing ( nothing happens after clicking the start menu icon ), 
  * glitched tiles , artifacts on tiles, 
  just do n't use amd 's windows 10 drivers and you 'll be ok for the driver part . 
  i have too many justice !, 
  your windows 7 key will most probably work as a windows 10 key . 
  head of microsoft in turkey has stated that the upgrade process will work just as it did in windows 8 to windows 8.1 , so in that sense , you should be able to activate windows 10 using your old serial . 
  i am almost sure that 's how it 's gon na be . 
  minuum has that functionality i guess . 
  but there is no problem when i am alone ? 
  also , i do n't think so cause i have never had such an issue or any kind of connection issue with any other game . 
  edit : just tried with my router on dmz and no firewalls/anti-viruses etc. 
  seems to be the same . 
  i believe one was 7 , the other one was 6 and i was 4 . 
  that might be it actually . 
  so how can we play together ? 
  custom ? 
  according to the head of microsoft in turkey , dreamspark keys will be upgraded . 
  i do n't think any of them are banned since they have just bought the game . 
  and i am definitely not banned as i am able to join to games with no problem whatsoever . 
  i am back to tell you that i might have resolved my issues regarding no one joining my game . 
  though i did not have the opportunity to test with 2 of my friends , i was able to play a couple of games with one of my friends and games were full in a matter of seconds !, 
  so what did i do ? 
  * though my machine was on dmz , i saw on [ this ] ( https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=6776-myxu-0480&amp;l=english ) page that steam might have problems with dmz . 
  so i opened the ports stated in [ this ] ( https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=8571-glvn-8711&amp;l=english ) page . 
  * also , according to [ this page ] ( http://www.awesomenauts.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=13&amp;t=2735 ) from awesomenauts forums , if not many players play awesomenauts in your region , you need to change your steam download region to somewhere which is more populated in terms of awesomenauts players . 
  so i changed my region , which was turkey before , to germany and looks like now , everything is okay . 
  from the faq :, 
   how to get the best matchmaking, 
  select the correct region in steam : steam -  settings -  downloads + cloud -  download region set the region to your region or the region closest to you . 
  the region that is set , is used as the primary region to search for in the matchmaker . 
  if you are living in a place where not many players are playing awesomenauts , or if you just ca n't find any matches you could set the region to a different region than your own . 
  you could set it to a nearby region where more players are active . 
  hi , here 's what i did to solve my issues ( seemingly ) : http://www.reddit.com/r/awesomenauts/comments/38t9ze/why_do_no_other_players_join_when_i_start_a_game/cs1v50w, 
  title of the link is misleading . 
  if you check the actual news page , you can see there is no word of `` syrian kurds '' but instead it says `` kurds in syria '' . 
  there 's a big difference between the two ; being located in syria does n't mean you are syrian . 
  it even says `` kurdish ` terrorists ' in syria '' , so he is actually not referring to all the kurds in syria but to the ones that are terrorists . 
  `` turkey 's erdogan says west backing kurdish ` terrorists ' in syria '', 
  just a side note , he also cut her hands off while she was still alive and took them with him to his house in order to prevent a dna scan on her fingernails . 
  this is n't just about amd drivers , i can understand microsoft 's desire to keep their users up-to-date in terms of windows , however forcing driver updates will always be a problem because it 's not the microsoft that controls them . 
  newest drivers are n't the best all the time . 
  typical / r/worldnews , believing everything they see in the news  who cares about sources , right ? 
  but ... 
  but ... turkey ... we should ... kick them out of nato :'(, 
  sorry for being off-topic , but is that amd driver new ? 
  because the whole point is stupid . 
  according to the article , turkey supplies power to that city because of an agreement that was present before the war . 
  there are still many people living in that city even though it is controlled by isil . 
  i do n't know many details about the deal or so , but it does n't make sense to punish the people living there . 
  also todayszaman ( or simply zaman ) is owned by what we call cemaat , a deep state organization which recently has started to have problems with the government that they were in peace with for 12 years . 
  because of that organization 's conflict with the government they have started to publish extremely exaggerated or complete bullshit articles which aim doing nothing but discrediting the government in any way possible . 
  the amount of people who would n't take todayszaman as a credible news source normally but who believe them at the moment is surprisingly and stupidly high , which represents the general profile of internet and / r/worldnews users . 
  this . 
  yup . 
  this is a known bug for 10130 . 
  for the time being the workaround is to right click start button and do whatever you want to do via `` shut down or sign off '', 
  nah , just finished the game , 
  as a workaround , right click the start button and use `` shut down or sign off '' to do whatever you want to do . 
  which map is this ? 
  got an r9 290x here running on 10130 . 
  first amd drivers were total shit for windows 10 , however with the last one i have n't had any issues for a long time . 
  no bsod 's , no game crashes , no performance dropdowns , no video playback issues . 
  seems to me the latest amd driver is pretty much okay . 
   in the old canon ( specifically in the force unleashed ), 
  uhm ... to my knowledge the force unleashed was never cannon . 
  pretty sure claiming something means that it is 100 % true . 
  with 1 health ... 
  notificiations do not work as they did in windows 8 for me as well, 
  see, 
  or do nothing , seriously , because there is no fix for this and origin is bullshit and ea is crap . 
  i 've tried more than 4 accounts on more than 2 computers in the last week but nothing i did fixed it . 
  do n't buy anything ea as they are not even able to give something for free let alone selling it . 
  sorry for being off-topic , does anyone know when / r/amd will go live again ? 
  windows + r, 
  1 . netplwiz, 
  untick user must enter a password blabla, 
  hit ok and there will be a pop-up , enter your password there, 
  that 's it,
