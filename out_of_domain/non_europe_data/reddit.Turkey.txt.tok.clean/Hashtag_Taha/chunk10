  ps i 'm from baghdad . 
   do something about it then . 
  iraqi here , and if america has their way , we ai n't gon na get shit done . 
  america * loves * saudi arabia because they provide america with lovely oil . 
  if us arabs actually had our way , we would get those saudi princes out of power and install a democracy . 
  but * nope * . 
  america ** loves ** oil so it wo n't let that happen . 
  they own half of london and new york . 
  arabs know how to stay wealthy . 
  nevertheless , bad people .

  well shit, 
  lol, 
  i was playing once and then * gasp * kricken joined . 
  kricken was doing a faction survival on our server . 
  i was a 5 donor . 
  so she instantly gets yt rank and she builds a base . 
  i find her base and raid it with my fac and then i get banned for raiding . 
  on a raiding server . 
  the only reason i go on is because i won a $ 120 rank in a do with tons of op shit, 
  no they do n't . 
  op is only for owner . 
  you can give special permissions for ranks .

  we do have money and we constantly keep getting more but these dumbasses in the government do n't know how to use their oil money so they spend it on themselves . 
  cool, 
  that 's why every pcmasterrace person keeps a nintendo around . 
  your dead to me ...

  keep your friends dude !, 
  on april 20th , 6900 , on the planet grypton , a mother , sharkisha , was giving birth to a child . 
  she was high ( it 's weed day after all ) so all she was saying was `` gregory , ooooh gregory , '' ( her husbands name ) while having 3 orgasms at once . 
  thus was the birth of gregory ii aka junior . 
  at age 25 , junior was a talented fellow . 
  he was very good at the fields of language arts , english , and grammar . 
  he really liked to make up stories that had no ending , those were really fun to him . 
  one thing junior lacked was * fun * . 
  he was simply boring , very * boring * . 
  he always would correct anyone at * any * mistake . 
  he would always but into conversations and was generally , how do i put this , ** annoying ** . 
  on junior 's birthday , 6925 , the planet was collapsing in on itself , or so he thought . 
  the entire planet , the size of russia with one nation and a few populated areas with junior 's being the biggest , unanimously decided to spread juniors genes to save gumanity . 
  boarding the capsule headed to earth , junior said his last goodbyes , but little did he know , no one will miss him as all the people that loved him had died in a tragic accident . 
  the planet was never gon na explode , they all just wanted to party better . 
  and , on a sleeping pill for 3 years and a vr , thus began junior 's journey to earth . 
  junior 's destination was raliegh , north carolina , usa in the year 6928 . 
  as he left the capsule , he started noticing how everyone on earth looked the same as everyone on grypton . 
  he saw a women that looked pretty nice so he approached her and asked , `` excuse me , ma\u2019am , do you know where we are ? 
  i 'm a traveler , '' . 
  she smiled and replied with , `` we are in raliegh , north carolina , '' . 
  then junior said , `` thank you very much , wan na grab a drink sometime ? '' to which the women replied to , `` sure !, 
  my name is jesse , '' . 
  `` great , my name is gregory the second , but you can call me junior , '' . 
  later that night junior and jesse hooked up and started dating . 
  on october 10th , junior realized how much better he is than everybody else except in grammar . 
  everything he said also came true like , `` i hope the weather is nice today , '' makes the weather nice . 
  so he started making a costume immediately . 
  `` grammar man , '' said junior , `` grammar man , * yeah * ! '' . 
  on that day junior wore the costume , climbed the biggest building in raleigh north carolina , and jumped off screaming `` ** fly ** , '' . 
  needless to say , he died . 
  just like your grammar .
