  this is a sora from the qur ` an . 
  it basically translates into :, 
  in the name of god ( in every sora ), 
  all of you wrong doers, 
  i do n't worship what you worship, 
  and you do n't worship what i worship, 
  and i have never worshipped what you worshipped, 
  and you have never worshipped what i worship, 
  you have your religion and i have mine . 
  basically it means that we do n't care . 
  these people that you talked about financially dropping lgbt 's are a little extreme , however the poll of if they were ok with lgbt is correct because non of us are ok with it and we strongly oppose it . 
  some might shun the lgbt 's , and others might hurt them . 
  but most of us just keep our distance and pray for them . 
  source : am iraqi muslim with american citizenship . 
  everyone hates saudi . 
  even saudis . 
  there are christian , jewish , and atheist terrorists too !, 
  just because 9/11 was done by muslims in america suddenly muslims are all terrorists . 
  this jew from israel tried to bomb a building in lebanon . 
  i love jews but this is an example of terrorism in other religions . 
   having a child that is a terrorist . 
  those things are taught not inherited . 
  if americans keep calling muslims terrorists , they just might get tired of that shit and bomb something . 
   ca n't divorce a man you were forced to marry . 
  stop living in yemen and saudi arabia please . 
  i am a muslim and this is offending . 
  you obviously do n't know jack shit and are shouting whatever the fuck you were told by fox news and the government . 
  this . 
  while tentions have eased some people still hate the west . 
  some iraqis hate america because iraq is now a colony of america . 
  or `` puppet state '' if you will . 
  again , get your head out of saudi and yemen . 
  context ? 
  islam is a religion of peace and unless you post the whole sora with an arabic translation , your wrong .

  its a guy camping an ant, 
  sorry , i was just trying to be funny . 
  i obviously failed . 
  i 'll show myself out . 
  [ * cue awkward seal * ] ( http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/741/861/6b4.jpg ), 
  * oil, 
  * capital of iraq . 
  * home to terrorists ( not true !, 
  i 'm from iraq . 
  all my friends are fascinated by this . 
  well , its a good thing its only on fucking threads and not regular threads . 
  i read the first sentence and , being the person that jumps to conclusions , thought you hated islam and thought all of us are terrorists . 
  *** { choo-chooing has reached maximum level } ***, 
  i hope your a troll, 
  *** { ... intensifies !!!!!!!!, 
  this is so off topic , have my upvote, 
  i meant the women thing only happens in saudi arabia and yemen . 
  wait, 
  why the fuck are you using vista ? 
  i 'm an iraqi that lived in egypt . 
  can confirm . 
  as an iraqi , i fear for my family everyday . 
  one day , my eldest uncle went to work , and never came back . 
  i feel you all . 
  i wish for you the best brothers, 
  he is speaking in american slang so i can safely confirm he is a us soldier that is a veteran of the iraq war . 
  geez dude , stop being such a party pooper or someone will give you the * bird * . 
  i can tell you were studying because you spoke a fluid kuwaiti dialect . 
  good luck on your studies !, 
  iraqis are proud of iraqi-ness . 
  its ok now . 
  i 'm just waiting till the elections come and we have a better president so i can go visit my family . 
  i mean * seriously * our current president litterly has talaban in his name . 
  in some ways yes , in other ways no . 
  con 's :, 
  * unstable government, 
  * rebuilding and remodernization, 
  * made isis really mad, 
  * democracy, 
  * more rights, 
  * elections so we do n't have to overthrow the leader if we do n't like them . 
  i 'm in america now , and probably will be for a long time , but as soon as talabani gets out of office , i can go visit my family . 
  edit : i was on my phone so i accedently hit u instead of i. 
  it was sort of a joke on the whole taliban thing but he is a bad president . 
  one day , i 'm going to click all the switch-a-roo 's and see if they lead me to the center of the internet . 
  i actually just did it . 
  it takes you to the am a of the switcharoo 's . 
  indeed , the center of the internet . 
  islamic state if iraq and syria . 
  they have a control of a few cities in iraq and syria . 
  they 're basically a terrorist group . 
  also i did n't mean to put u , i meant to put i. 
  did n't mean to put the u lol . 
  i already did it . 
  well , shit . 
  saddam was n't the smartest person ever . 
  its arabic . 
  how do i wake up !, 
  10/10 would wake up again . 
  your false . 
  still false . 
  #wake up, 
  i would really love crisis or any other fps .
