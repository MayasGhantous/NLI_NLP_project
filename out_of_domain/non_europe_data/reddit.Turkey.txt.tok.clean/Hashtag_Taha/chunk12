  muslim of help russia !, 
  if nato decides to attack moscow , guess who 's not getting any more goodies from china ? 
  according to [ gfp ] ( http://www.globalfirepower.com ) , the us really should n't fire shots with russia . 
  russia has china and china can cut supplies * really * fast . 
  none but they installed puppet governments . 
  hell iraq was a puppet under saddam hussein . 
  the us funded him and * gave * him sarin gas .

  well mabey that 's because ~ ~ 5 ~ ~ 4 of the worlds super powers ( usa , uk , australia , poland ) plundged headfirst into iraq . 
  iraq did not have any support as all its ally 's were scared of the un . 
  look at syria and iran now , in the top 30 in gfp and bordering countries to iraq . 
  iraq was a on oar if not ahead of iran . 
  hell iraq was stronger than many colonial euro nations like norway and spain . 
  but now its garbage because the un thought that selling oil in euros was bad . 
  actually do some research please .

  69 women 420 asstroids scarred me for life . 
  me being an iraqi , i have to say this . 
  my grand father on my mothers side ( rip ) lived through the history of iraq . 
  my grandfather was originally born into the british mandate of mesopotamia . 
  and he stayed a british citizen until 1932 when the kingdom of iraq officially got it 's independence from great britain under the rule of faisal i of iraq . 
  he lived through many events like the 1948 arab-israeli war , and the conflict with britain over kuwait . 
  in 1958 , the republic of iraq was founded and that is where the brief period of freedom came to iraq . 
  this was the best time for the iraqi people . 
  however in 1961 , kuwait became independent from britain and iraq gained sovereignty over it , this caused instability . 
  in 1963 , the ba'athist party took over iraq . 
  this is the worst part of the history of the country and the history of my grand father . 
  he died during this period not because he was assinated , not because he was too old , he died in 1994 because he fell in a shower . 
  to think , my grandfather lived through many tough times in the country 's history , and only died in the bathroom . 
  that is one hell of a feat grandpa . 
  rip . 
  for me it 's always western canada . 
  ~ ~ arabic ~ ~ .
