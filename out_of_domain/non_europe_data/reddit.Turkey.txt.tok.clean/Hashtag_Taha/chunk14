  can you be emma watson ? 
  iraq here , we hated saddam but seriously , you guys over powered us . 
  i think the americans went to war with iraq because maybe they wanted to keep the value of the dollar because it was backed by oil . 
  iraq started selling oil in euros . 
  * removes tinfoil hat *, 
  who 's chemical weapons though ? 
  * cough * ** america ** * cough *, 
  can confirm , am iraqi . 
  while saddam was bad , we could 've waited to vote him out in the next election . 
  edit : forgot it was the ba'ath party . 
  it only says we are the caretaker of women . 
  if you get off your ass and go outside , you see that women love being taken care of by men . 
  that 's why in the hard jobs you see men and in the delegate jobs you see women . 
  there a few exceptions to this rule , and these women are just born with a little more might . 
  but no rights are taken from women unless you go to the countries i listed above . 
  well looks like someone 's been snooping through my comments . 
  listen douchebag , i was young when i left iraq its not like i can remember it from when i was 10 . 
  anyway i looked it up and i got the right answer . 
  i 'm not gon na correct you anymore . 
  get off my profile . 
  i have a shia mom and a sunni dad . 
  they definetly disagree sometimes but they never , ** never ** , physically ingur one another . 
  that is a crime even in the countries i stated above for beating women is strictly against islam . 
  go read a book and get your head out of american propaganda . 
  edit : so if someone says your ways are wrong and provides information that is wrong , you wo n't insult him ? 
  what i meant was put it in context . 
  it goes in one ear , comes out the other . 
  this surah does not restrict the rights of women . 
  you 're taking religious text ( that is written in arabic and poorly translated ) and making conclusions off of it . 
  according to the english grammar , it might sound like we in slave women . 
  but we do n't . 
  i never said he was good he is a mass murderer that killed people . 
  its just that i got one thing wrong . 
  however how did saddam kill all these people ? 
  with the us weapons . 
  you were supplying his regime . 
  you know what ? 
  i 'm done arguing with a stupid american . 
  there are 2 types . 
  those who understand the world . 
  you , people that are blindly patriotic and do not know other cultures . 
  from wikipedia :, 
   iraq purchased 8 strains ofanthrax from the united states in 1985 , according to british biological weapons expert david kelly . 
  [ 27 ] the iraqi military settled on the american type culture collection strain 14578 as the exclusive strain for use as a biological weapon , according to charles duelfer . 
   on february 9 , 1994 , senator riegle delivered a report - commonly known at the riegle report - in which it was stated that `` pathogenic ( meaning ` disease producing ' ) , toxigenic ( meaning ` poisonous ' ) , and other biological research materials were exported to iraq pursuant to application and licensing by the u.s. department of commerce . '', 
  it added : `` these exported biological materials were not attenuated or weakened and were capable of reproduction . 
   the report then detailed 70 shipments ( includingbacillus anthracis ) from the united states to iraqi government agencies over three years , concluding `` it was later learned that these microorganisms exported by the united states were identical to those the un inspectors found and recovered from the iraqi biological warfare program . 
  the us was practically supplying iraq with weapons . 
  of course saddam had some left . 
  you know what ? 
  i 'm done . 
  you win . 
  have fun with your ignorance . 
  i 'll have you know i lived in more countries and states than you ever will . 
  have fun . 
  you know what ? 
  i 'm done . 
  you win . 
  have fun with your ignorance . 
  i 'll have you know i lived in more countries and states than you ever will . 
  have fun . 
  mind you my mum has many arguments with my dad and she does some pretty tough work . 
  as an iraqi , i take offense to the iraqistan thing . 
  we are not persian !, 
  i thought navy seals were usa ? 
  # * the beginning of the beginning of time *, 
  deadmau5 house is repetitive and has more of a fixed beat . 
  skrillex has a more complicated tune with a more unpredictable beat . 
  personally , i like both . 
  i like dubstep and i 'm out retarded . 
  i 'm smarter than the average person at my school and i 'm sort of adhdish . 
  dubstep just makes sense to my ears and gets stuck in my head . 
  i imagined this as shadow from sonic heros . 
  surely that has some inspiration to this ? 
  anyway , perfection . 
  obvious troll is obvious .
