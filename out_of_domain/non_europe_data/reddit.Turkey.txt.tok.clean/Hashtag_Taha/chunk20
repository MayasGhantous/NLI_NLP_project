  we need to set aside our differences and learn to respect each other . 
  - iraq, 
  its probably a troll . 
  trust me , spreading my opinion as an iraqi , i 've encountered a lot of trolls . 
  what 's wrong with muslims , good sir ? 
  well that 's obviously false . 
  egypt , turkey , saudi arabia , iran and even syria all make it to the top 30 of [ gfp ] ( http://www.globalfirepower.com ) . 
  saudi arabia is where mecca lies and iraq contains many shia sites . 
  qatar has the world 's highest gdp per capita and the uae is super developed . 
  this guy has no right to say that they are just war zones and that israel is the only super power . 
  edit : they 're by no means super powers , they are regional powers . 
   strongest, 
  [ egypt , saudi arabia , and syria all make it to the top 30 on gfp ] ( http://www.globalfirepower.com/countries-listing.asp ), 
   most developed . 
  the uae is one of the most developed countries . 
  [ qatar ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_ppp_per_capita ) has the highest gdp per capita of any country . 
  we have great nations . 
  i 'm sorry , i do not discuss with people that are stupid enough to say that turkey is an arab state . 
  i upvoted you for making good points . 
  qatar does have a slavery problem which , insha ' allah , gets solved soon and egypt and syria just had revolutions . 
  i know palestinians that lived in israel and they barely have any rights . 
  occupying another countries land is against international law . 
  also , the homosexual part might be a problem but no country is perfect . 
  and just so you know , outside of saudi arabia , women have equal rights in the arab world . 
  also i have yet to meet an arab slave owner . 
  oh shut your racist ass up . 
   ~ ~ but at least they are free  ~ ~, 
  in your dreams . 
  as an iraqi , i will explain why . 
  you have effectively installed an oligarchy in iraq where only the rich and foreign can vote . 
  the government consists mostly shias . 
  it 'd be a miracle i 'd you were a sunni and you got elected . 
  not that saddam was a good guy , but he gave us clean water , food , paved roads , and good education . 
  now all of that is gone . 
  only 1 % of the population can enjoy this `` freedom '' . 
  not to mention that the voting is always rigged . 
  it is truly a nightmare . 
  the only free place is kurdistan . 
  that is where the americans invested , where the most oil lies . 
  as an iraqi , iraq is the un !, 
  [ false ] ( http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/egypt_statistics.html ), 
   education, 
   to the top, 
   youth ( 15-24 years ) literacy rate ( % ) 2008-2012 * , male, 
   youth ( 15-24 years ) literacy rate ( % ) 2008-2012 * , female, 
  by developed i ment like uae or jordan or kuwait . 
  most of our strong nations are recovering from war or are in war . 
  i think that the fact that they made it to the top 30 is pretty amazing . 
  egypt is number 13 on [ gfp ] ( http://www.globalfirepower.com/countries-listing.asp ) and saudi arabia and syria make it in the top 30 . 
  oops my mistake . 
  jordan is n't officially a developed country but if you visit , you will see otherwise . 
  i thought you were a westerner saying that muslims are terrorists serving allah . 
  no hard feelings brother , 
  i said they 're pretty developed . 
  they ca n't be more developed than israel because they do n't have a usa funding them . 
  maybe not in egypt but countries pike uae or jordan have equal women rights . 
  so # 13 is n't impressive ? 
  egypt has the strongest standing military in africa , the arab world and its second strongest to turkey , which makes it to the top 10 . 
  at least we do n't kill children, 
  i ment regional powers , yes . 
  sorry for the misunderstanding . 
  at least it 's not government lead . 
  what you got now ? 
  well no country is perfect . 
  the uk is a theocracy and the us is an oligarchy . 
  there is no perfect country . 
  wtf ? 
  borgore . 
  borgore has some of the best edm out there . 
  some of his songs are in arabic !, 
  if you 're into edm check out [ wayak by borgore ft. dudu tasa . 
  ] ( https://soundcloud.com/borgore/wayak-wayak ) it 's amazing . 
  *** [ protesting intensifies ] ***, 
  judging by your flair , this must be your favorite thread . 
  you said `` they '' twice . 
  to make you feel better , i really love israeli edm . 
  now to make you feel miserable :, 
  as an iraqi , either bush or anyone from my government . 
  how ? 
  english is my second language so i can almost always catch these little mistakes . 
  inb4 this turns into an israelis vs. arabs thread .

  but its not like they are willing to speak . 
  we have one of the weakest militaries . 
  even * syria * has a better army then us and they are in a * cival war * .
