  meh , needs more \u0643\u0628\u0627\u0628 . 
  if things keep going like this , it 's not long till all arab countries over throw their current governments . 
  i think iraq is next in line . 
  arabic is the last thing holding us together . 
  fuck those guys , msa ftw !, 
  link ? 
  i think i found palestine 's new anthem . 
  you rock !, 
  i really enjoy your arrakeen wallpaper , what inspired the name ? 
  i do n't know , i kind of like it . 
  its a rework of an old egyptian folk song . 
  i like the wubs . 
  this is the only thing good to come out of israel . 
  its dangerous to go alone , take this \\, 
  well , we obviously have different musical tastes . 
  * sure is * - ** aristotle . 
  / r/montageparodies, 
  hahahaha, 
  hail arabia, 
  oh god ... polandball is leaking again ... 
  jerusalem is arabic wtf are you talking about ? 
  i failed really hard when i do stupid shit . 
  one time i jumped off the fence thinking that allah will let me fly . 
  hahahaha that 's funny right there . 
  * `` wait , never mind . 
  i have n't needed that shampoo in a long time , '' *, 
  he probably * is * his own body guard . 
  the iraqis got this one ,, 
  * proceeds to write ten bots that shout hateful stuff about america . 
  i sincerely wish it was the same with arabs . 
  we actually have some in our school . 
  i 'm going to see if i can snap one on monday . 
  iraqi here , same . 
  you know what 's annoying about the world ? 
  we are more alike than different . 
  take for example the arab world . 
  we are practically the same people but we still fight our selves . 
  why ca n't we just get along ? 
  people say that we ca n't get along but i do n't believe that . 
  take , for example , the internet . 
  we all get along here ( most of the time ) and we are very different . 
  there are americans , europeans , russians , arabs and many other races / ethnicities and we all get along . 
  tl ; dr : we are more alike than different . 
  fuck the americans . 
  i was happy when they came ( or was old enough to realize they came ) until i saw the changes . 
  alqaeda bombings , instability and more bullshit . 
  at least they could 've installed a better government . 
  # * hail babylon *, 
  do n't give a damn . 
  its dead , jim !, 
  i feel bad for the libyans . 
  they are going to have to suffer the same fate as us iraqis have . 
  [ \u0625\u0646\u0634\u0623 \u0623\u0644\u0644\u0651\u0647 ] ( #arabic ) they do n't have too . 
   it 's your opinion and i respect it . . but , it 's hard to use arabic to teach maths or technique or science, 
  we freaking invented modern day maths and sciences . 
  why do you think they are called arabic numerals ? 
  in iraq and egypt , i remember having to take an english class at primary grades . 
  my words exactly . 
  wtf are these people trying to do ? 
  split us up ? 
  kill the last thing we have in common ? 
  your mom !, 
  [ ] ( / wtf ), 
  they 're working on it . 
  is a religion, 
  then you fuck yes . 
  oh god ,, 
  get me / r/eyebleach !, 
  here 's the [ hyper link ] ( http://fc06.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2010/100/6/f/hyperlink_by_selvo.png ), 
  from a scale of one to even , you just ca n't ? 
  i had a rocket hit my city 3 kilometers west . 
  * 3 kilometers !, 
  its not like we supported it . 
  we are one people , we shall not let the past divide us . 
   iraq, 
  ok i know i 'm an iraqi but what the serious fuck . 
  it 's like they want us arabs to look bad by putting the world cup in iraq . 
  do n't get me wrong , i love my country but seriously , as of now , its no place for a world cup . 
  reddit has an arabic option . 
  this is so cute !, 
  and another qatar hater . 
  who says japan can give us this by 2022 ? 
  and even if they do this , the qatar can use their bigger pile of money diplomacy to buy the technology and use it . 
  well maybe if you americans respected other cultures this would n't be a problem . 
  this was us arabs only time to shine , and the only good thing to happen to arabs since the death of the ottoman empire . 
  but nope , the greasy arab man can not handle an international event , let 's rebid . 
   music, 
  what the fuck ? 
  as a muslim , i listen to music everyday and i do n't know what your talking about . 
  agh the arab springers . 
  always giving us shit . 
  syria used to be a nice country until now . 
  so arabs are n't people now ? 
  look at yourself before talking . 
  considering your an atheist , you 're probably an american that does n't know any other cultures . 
  us arabs / muslims are the most musical people on the planet . 
  [ here 's a muslim song ( in english for your pleasure ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tz4bbqgge8 ), 
  only a few islamic groups ( al-qaeda , al-shabab etc. . ) ban music , other than that , we 're free to listen to whatever we want . 
  \\* * as long as we do n't get addicted to it . 
  so your saying this about qatar , but you have nothing against russia , which has far worst conditions than qatar .
