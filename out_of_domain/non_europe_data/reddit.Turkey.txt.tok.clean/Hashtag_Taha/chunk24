  yes . 
  and many deaths to be had . 
  edit :, 
  yes . 
  people died . 
  here 's a map of the da3esh gains :, 
  add tikrit to that . 
  before we democracy things up , i think we should take care of mosul and tikrit ... 
  da3esh is a highly trained international group that is folds more determined on creating this caliphate than al-qaeda . 
  isil used to be al-qaeda in iraq until this february when they decided to break away . 
  isil has bean funded by turkey , the usa , and saudi-arabia so that it can overthrow assads regime in syria . 
  with all their weapons , they decided to go into iraq . 
  they already controlled half of syria so why the fuck not try to go to iraq ? 
  anbar province is the home for the isil members , that is it 's capital . 
  tuesday , it invaded mosul and today it got to tikrit . 
  by this rate they 'll overtake iraq in a week , however that is not possible . 
  with turkey protecting the north and iran protecting the south and baghdad , there is no way isil can control the whole country , unless they work really hard . 
  this muddled group of extremists has their own government , own military , and own supporters . 
  they are basically a mini jihadi caliphate at this point . 
  god help the people in iraq , and god damn the da3esh members . 
  it 's a joke , here 's the song :, 
  i 'm not entirely sure . 
  i mean , this has passed through my uncle , to my aunt , arriving at my mother . 
  i 'm 50/50 about it . 
  the iraqi special forces were litterly picked of the street . 
  some of them even sold their weapons !, 
  sure there are the ex-baathists that are extremely well trained but there are very few . 
  these new generals deserted the soldiers in mosul . 
  the soldiers , without command , dropped their weapons and ran for their lives . 
  da3esh has us quality tech now . 
  they are very dangerous . 
  irani forces will protect a fellow shiite government . 
  we had a civil war in 2007 also . 
  but fuck it let 's have another one . 
  hell no !, 
  i would never support them . 
  i was being sarcastic on the third line . 
  sorry if i made it sound like that . 
  it better be . 
   ask the ~ ~ iranians ~ ~ turks for help . 
  turkey is folds stronger than iran , and is a nato ally . 
  i 'm pretty sure they can help us more than the iranians . 
  why do n't the kurds identify as iraqis ? 
  i mean we 're all just people . 
  i edited it , it should be clearer now . 
  fuck your flair . 
  one of the best explanations to this day . 
  bashar might be an asshole , he 's an asshole i 'll take for maliki any day . 
  he knows how to lead a country . 
  true , now that i think about it , turkey would cause nato invading us . 
  good point ... 
  thanks !, 
  will add soon ... 
  yeah i know that ... now that i think about it , its a bad idea . 
  huh that 's strange , because i can too !, 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ shit, 
  that is the main reason my family moved to the usa and not any other country . 
  once we get our american citizenship , we can travel anywhere we want because fuck it , we 're americans now . 
  because he 's the only one that kept iraq together and gave us clean water and paved roads etc etc. . . 
  because what isis is doing today is more genocidic than saddam . 
  maliki is doing nothing to stop them , not even asking the oh so beloved iranians to help . 
  maliki is an asshole , and saddam is too , but saddam is a better asshole than maliki . 
  because our government is basically an iranian puppet . 
  a confederation ? 
  * that small ? 
  love * you *, 
  if you forget to take them off , yes . 
  none because they are constantly running out of time ... 
  ^ ^ and ^ so ^ are ^ you ^ u ^ u ^ u, 
  you already have a miniature black hole and i saw it yesterday . 
  spoiler , its your moms ass . 
  # * over 9000 !!!!!!, 
  here 's a big, 
  #fuck you, 
  to you . 
  first of all , the middle east is where most religions originate from . 
   since the dawn of civilization, 
  just so you know , sumer , the first civilization , was located at modern day iraq and kuwait . 
  also , the islamic caliphate invented modern day math and algebra . 
  all these crazy maths that americans do n't understand originated from that caliphate . 
  even today , the uae is booming , oman is one of the most successful monarchies , saudi arabia is a home to all muslims , and qatar has the worlds highest gdp per capita . 
  congratulations , your da3esh is evolving !, 
  da3esh evolved into a country !, 
  saudi arabia is home to mecca , the holiest city in islam . 
  all muslims have to take a trip to do the hajj once in their lives provided they 're able too . 
   ~ ~ feelings ~ ~ feels . 
  ftfy, 
  happy cake day , 
  ya see , the thing is , democracy is something we fight for , not earn . 
  maliki is a bitch , but under the us 's democrazy , we are n't getting anyone else . 
  i do n't know why you are being down voted . 
  bush was the most retarded person on the planet to start a war on my beautiful country . 
  yes i know saddam was bad but if we wanted someone else , we could overthrow him , we have the army on our side . 
  the people down voting you are just republican rednecks masturbating to the idea of the south rising again . 
  ^ ^ ^ * ^ ^ ^ success ^ ^ ^ not ^ ^ ^ garunteed, 
  do n't know why you are getting downvoted , what you said is entirely true . 
  this is entirely true . 
  the ukrainian people were happy , but the us was like nope !, 
  no european country can support russia !, 
  so they armed the opposition groups and let the civil war break out .
