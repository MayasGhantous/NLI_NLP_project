  nobody wants the us as world leader anyway . 
  i certainly do n't, 
  well maybe not to you , but to us iraqis minus the kurds , he is much better . 
  your love is to high,

  i never said i liked this map . 
  perhaps you read my comment wrong ? 
  [ i like my iraq ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iraq ), 
  i heard somewhere that isis was better than the iraq government by providing water and electricity . 
  i also heard they 're not really killing christians or shias . 
  these could be rumors , but it could be true . 
  oh well , i knew it was too good to be true . 
  what the fuck ? 
  when i made that joke a few days ago , i get criticism and down votes . 
  when you make it , you get laughs and up votes . 
  edit : spelling mistake and different font . 
  this picture can do a lot . 
  these are sunnis , shias , and christians together praying for peace . 
  you know what this means ? 
  it definitly means a lot to us . 
  it 's been a long time since i 've been to the arab world , will fix .

  i love iraq 's past . 
  that 's a start right ? 
  hopefully we can make the present like the past . 
  i think he is maad because he deserted the jihaad and fled to baghdaad and now he feels really baad . 
   iraq has split into three regions : saudi arabia , iran , and turkey . 
  ftfy, 
  why are you being down voted for stating the truth ? 
  as an iraqi , i can confirm . 
  i have kurdish family , i do n't see the problem with kurds . 
  or , gee i do n't know , it might 've been the american invasion that opened a chance for terrorist groups . 
  chinese . 
  you ai n't seen nothing ' yet - saudi arabia . 
  you . 
  vote . 
  its his fake internet points , and he wants them now !, 
  everything is cool when you 're part of a team, 
  iraq used to have a stronger passport ; - ;,

  good day . 
  israel makes nukes and no one bats an eye , iraq/n wants to make a nuke and everyone goes bat shit crazy !,

  i 'm pretty sure it 's isis ( islamic state of iraq and al-sham ) and not ises ( islam state of ? 
  and al-sham ), 
  missing yes, 
  `` do you want to see osama bin ladin and the * obama * nation of doom ? '', 
  `` sure , '', 
  what ? 
  the only iraqis that want to partition are the kurds . 
  they would somehow blame it on us muslims . 
  bes response , and as an iraqi , i hope your `` perfect world '' scenario comes out . 
  wtf, 
  yes . 
  astughfurallah were trying to keep positive !, 
  jordan 's military is n't that strong , and they do n't have shia militias / iran .
