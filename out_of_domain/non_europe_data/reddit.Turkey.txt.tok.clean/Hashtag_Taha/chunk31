  edit : \u0645\u0645\u062a\u0627\u0632 , your ideas are excelent . 
  however i oppose the idea for the algeria flag as the flag to represent us all . 
  of course they are one of the best arab countries , i would much rather prefer a new flag made to represent us all , but i respect your opinion  . 
  either an, 
  a ) israeli colony of the west bank or, 
  b ) a unified uar with israel in it or, 
  c ) jewish south africa, 
  i would be down with this , 
  i love you automoderator, 
  i will try to , but i am too busy rolling in my money . 
  hopefully i can . 
  thank you , 
  i originally wanted iraq or egypt ( i 'm iraqi but i 've lived in egypt ) but they were taken , so i decided to take the richest country in gdp per capita . 
  i am the rightful emir of qatar !, 
  thank you , the people of qatar wish you good luck as well , 
  the kingdom of qatar would like to join the arab / muslim union . 
  ~ signed / u/hashtag _ taha qatar, 
  yeah !, 
  i took the [ kingdom of egypt flag ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_egypt ) and mixed it with the qatar flag . 
  if you like this one , i made [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/uvx1rkg.png ) flag for a pan-arab post over in another subreddit . 
  should i post it to / r/vexillology ? 
  thanks !, 
  i added that to the user submissions !, 
  you can be a russian for all i care , but it 's all up to what you believe . 
  ^ ^ psst ^ ^ join ^ ^ the ^ ^ arabs !, 
  according to / r/worldpowers , i am the emir of qatar and i can not speak french . 
  people do n't believe in pan-arabism anymore :(, 
  the kingdom of qatar will try to remain at peace , 
  a very good submission !, 
  however i think that a war with israel over taking jerusalem back will be too costly + israel has the usa on their side . 
  the best idea with israel is to let it be and not anger it , let them be the aggressors . 
  the best idea would be a new city in sinai , we can have the egyptian wiliya give up sinai and use it as an administrative center . 
  we will build the city from the ground up so that it is unbiased . 
  however , if israel falls , or we manage to take it down , jerusalem would be the best place to pick a capitol . 
  i believe the us will keep supporting israel for it 's strategic location . 
  israel will be ` murica 's only ally in the middle east if this uar actually comes to be . 
  america needs it 's oversees bases to patrol the world . 
  israel is a key spot for us patrolling as it will open up ports to the mediterranean and also a port for the us navy . 
  how does one have more than one capitol ? 
  please elaborate . 
  the emir of qatar welcomes the new islanders !, 
  many thanks to the portugese , i would love to see the flags you came up with , but for now , the qatari people will be using [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/zrmrqi8.png ) flag . 
  but then how do the branches communicate efficiently ? 
  it does n't make sense really . 
  edit : especially in a pan arab state . 
  yes but having multiple capitols would be troublesome , keep in mind this country would be huge . 
  a place in sinai or libya would make a great capitol , not multiple capitols . 
  if we could manage it , then it might be a good idea , but we ca n't . 
  i mean you do n't want america / nato shoving 10 kilotons of ~ ~ uranium ~ ~ freedom up your country 's ass , do you ? 
  thanks , 
  [ meta ] nice  i would like to see a map of new arabia , as i do not know what that is . 
  my qatar is the real world qatar . 
  kinder surprise ? 
  anyone ? 
  i 'm still am wondering how americans can survive without kinder surprise ... 
  i 've always liked medina , 
  oh haha , i really like your flag !, 
  best of luck to your beeble !, 
  how do you get edited text with a custom flair ? 
  does batoot have a secret function ? 
  your flair is the most controversial flair on this sub . 
  i love it . 
  `` i will tell you , my sons , that i have 99 problems , but a bitch is not one ! '', 
  edit : is this haram ? 
  if it is , tell me so i 'll delete my comment . 
  i know he was referring to my username , but i do n't see how it links to pizza . 
  well i do n't know anymore . 
  where would they be where it would be useful to have to or more capitols ? 
  no , / u/daha , lebanon is not the arab world . 
  nor is egypt . 
  build a world power . 
  if this dream union ever comes to be , we will be a very strong country with a wide field of influence . 
  we would have the oil of saudi arabia , the media of egypt , the ports of the uae , the riches of qatar , the farm land of iraq , and the tourist attractions of al-sham !, 
  we would unite all arabs and open up these borders that separate us from our brothers . 
  there are many things to be had from this dream union . 
  tom cruise, 
  i checked the claimed list , when i searched for `` qatar '' i came up with [ this ] ( http://gyazo.com/08511ecd14761caf84139cd96031011d ), 
  but very well , is there any other unclaimed arab country ? 
  wait , can i claim iraq ? 
  it seems open , but it has a claim in the claim section . 
  all of this is great , except that antioch is turkish ... 
  turkey = / = arab . 
  the turks are no easy force , they 're nato allys . 
  if we can get it back , then we might make it our capitol . 
  other than that , great submission . 
  that 's a great idea , 
  hebrew got revived after world war ii , who said you ca n't do it with phoneacian ? 
  well , yeah .
