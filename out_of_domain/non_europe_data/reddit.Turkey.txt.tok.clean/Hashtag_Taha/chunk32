  ^ i ^ tottaly ^ wo n't ^ use ^ this ^ to ^ annex ^ kuwait . 
  is n't syria part of turkey ? 
  oman and yemen are one . 
  i know . 
  so the player has to not be active for you to annex them ? 
  its even worse in iraq . 
  especially at this time . 
  my grandparents are trying * so * hard to get a visa for the us . 
  i miss them very dearly . 
  this summer , we were going to go to baghdad to visit family i have n't been with for 5 years . 
  these people raised me . 
  but since the us invasion , iraqis had it really hard . 
  first getting visas rejected , second the inflow of takfiris from everywhere , and third the tyrranical rule of nous all maliki . 
  shias have it easy , but sunnis , such as my family , have it * very * hard . 
  fuck bush and those who support him . 
  edit : in 2006 , my eldest uncle went to work , and never came back . 
  they wo n't , they 've given up . 
  my youngest uncle has experience with guns from the saddam days . 
  they are building a fort on our house so that if isis attacks , they 've got ourselves covered . 
  amen . 
  thank you , 
  i believe, 
  wait . 
  there is an omani on this subreddit ? 
  * mission accomplished *, 
  i already died from the inside . 
  save me do ^ o ^ oo ^ o ^ o ^ o ^ ooo ^ ds, 
  freedom units please ? 
  jk that 's pretty damn hot . 
  aww . 
  can you do it ? 
  pretty please ? 
  oh oh and have it say ' 1 2 3 viva l'algerieee ', 
  the iraqis welcome the our new pals , welcome to / r/worldpowers , 
  thanks !, 
  will do . 
  the caliph is such a bro , that he loans the grand commissar 1 million dollars to get started , and hopes to make alliances in the future . 
  we would gladly give willing prisoners to the pcm . 
  however , the caliph asks if his caliphate will gain anything from this ? 
  yay , 
  i love you / u/fylow , 
  [ meta ] hah north dakota best dakota !!, 
  your people are so polite !, 
  the caliph is now going to travel back to baghdad and drink tea with the chancellor of arabia , cheers !, 
  you should edit your wiki , it 's really outdated . 
  you 're opinion is unpopular . 
  care to explain ? 
  obligatory * woosh * for me . 
  nice touch with the call to prayer !, 
  sweden can into good kebab . 
  you too !, 
  care to grab some breakfast and visit dad ? 
  i think it would be * egg * celent !, 
  i love you auto moderator . 
  i 've never seen an omani on / r/arabs before . 
  but blatently lying ? 
  that 's unacceptable . 
  as an algeria fan , that 's still kind of fucked up . 
  as an algeria fan , these guys sicken me . 
  they say it in arabic too . 
  hey is kind of universal , my dad says it to get things in order . 
  no , i was asking if that is the name for oman and yemen . 
  i did n't know what your country was originally , and i still do n't . 
  so , where is your country ? 
  i used to think things were exaggerated until i read this from * doha news * . 
  its * that * bad . 
   support isis . 
  as an iraqi , i need a source before i decide to punch my laptop for being so ignorant . 
  new favorite website . 
  no h8, 
  north dakota best dakota !, 
  really ? 
  * sends bombs to kuwait city *, 
  i hate you . 
  take my ? 
  vote . 
  well we should if we can actually get this union together . 
  love the algeria team , they represent the arab world . 
  how do i assign a governor ? 
  if i annex jordan , i can have someone govern it ? 
  ~ signed , / u/hashtag _ taha , caliph of iraq, 
  that 's really interesting !, 
  what powers does a governor have ? 
  but according to egypt , egypt *** is *** arab world !, 
  they ca n't declare war ? 
  if they ca n't , than that would be great , 
  oh thanks !, 
  you da real mvp, 
  ~ ~ hl3 ~ ~ illerminaughty confirmed, 
  be black , get sassed . 
  you got a problem with arabs ? 
  * calls all of arab world to stand behind him *, 
  edit : * arab world was too busy watching algeria matches and ignores the call *, 
  iraq would like to invest in this in exchange for 5 % of all hover crafts made , 
  mind = *** blown ***, 
  if we can conceptualize nothing , then there must be everything . 
  if a god created the universe , then he must be this nothingness . 
  our god , is the nothingness . 
  think about it : they say god is everywhere . 
  what if god * is * the universe !,
