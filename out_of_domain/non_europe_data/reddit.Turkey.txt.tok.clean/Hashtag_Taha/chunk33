  what if god is all these far off planets ? 
  what if this heaven is another god , or a different form of that same god , made out of infinity ? 
  they say you ca n't visualize god , because god is nothingness . 
  it is so interesting to think about this topic . 
  yes , i am a muslim . 
  do n't give me hate for that . 
  edit : what i meant by god is the force of energy that created the universe . 
  it can be any religion , or lack thereof , you believe in . 
  this `` god '' that i am referring to is the source of creation of the universe . 
  take my aladeen vote . 
  why you got to be so rude ? 
  do n't you know i 'm human too ? 
  this is my world view . 
  make the best of your current life , leave a better world for others . 
  god bless you and all of your souls . 
  its ... its beautiful !, 
  the sunnis do n't really like isis , they 're just using them as a means of retaliation to malikis government . 
  if isis did overtake iraq , then the sunnis and shias will take over isis . 
  very competitive . 
  wow . 
  what language ? 
  i thought french would have more ~ ~ accents ~ ~ diaphragms on the words .

  that part when she started twerking ... 
  if america did unite , there would be 50 governers running one country ... 
  because bbc is british and they support israel .

  but that 's a union of nations , not one nation .

  added . 
  beautiful , just like 1941 . 
  germany is now pissed off that it ca n't annex denmark , but whatever . 
  pharaoh , this is tyrannical , iraq objects to this . 
  you may not impose your dictatorship on all of mankind . 
  the caliph wishes to maintain a healthy relationship with pharaoh but this tyrannical rule might be stopping that . 
  the caliph does not wish to war you , but does not wish that your 80 million citizens live under this tyrannical rule . 
  iraq would love to enter it 's national football team .
