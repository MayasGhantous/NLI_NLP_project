  ~ signed / u/hashtag _ taha , caliph of iraq, 
  iraq has no issue with this , and intends to buy german weapons for future use . 
  thank you !, 
  iraq sends 10 solar panels and a pool of fresh water straight from the dejla river . 
  i know how to do the submit links . 
  i got saints row the 3rd , garry 's mod , batman arkham origins , and all 3 bioshocks . 
  that 'll keep me stocked for about a year because i suck at games .

  2 more hours 'till i own kuwait . 
  good luck !, 
  i would like to invest in this technology . 
  can caliph into polandball ? 
  the caliph of iraq likes work but does not like blatant propaganda . 
  i do not agree with tyranny . 
  iraq would love to trade oil and wheat for indonesian goods . 
  duuude . 
  this game was * so * heated , my dad watched it with me . 
  lebanese chicks , * damn * !, 
  shamy , maghreby , iraqi , khaleegy , yemeny , egyptian or somali , we are all one people , arab . 
  i love my levantine brothers just as i love my gulfie or egyptian brothers . 
  i do n't know that much about the levant besides that syria 's beaches are amazing . 
  this is all i had to say . 
  ~ ~ fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu ~ ~, 
  the caliph respects the decisions of turkey an cyprus and will remove his claim on short notice . 
  malta is european and i want to stay realistic so i wo n't go for greece . 
  maybe lebanon ? 
  phonetic : * mumtaaz ya habibi *, 
  litteral : * excellent my love *, 
  definition : * excellent *, 
  good luck , friend . 
  [ meta ] pakistan is actually my brother , i 'm sorry . 
  edit : he 'll probably forget it so you might be able to reclaim pakistan . 
  the caliph will invest in this in return for 5 thousand of these rifles . 
  thanks !, 
  emotional roller coaster this morning , was n't it ? 
  annexed kuwait , and soon lebanon . 
  also there is still some orange in the 4 . 
  i would leave it to you . 
  i 'm on my phone now . 
  i was going to annex norn cyprus and leave lebanon to syria , but you beat me to it . 
  [ meta ] soon to be signed . 
  i am annexing lebanon . 
  i am [ annexing lebanon ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/globalpowers/comments/29jpmt/expansion_iraq_sends_delegates_to_lebanon_to/ ) now , if you want lebanon , you have to give me jordan . 
  take * that * syria !, 
  yes . 
  but the usa funds the fsa which , * surprise , surprise , * indirectly funds isis . 
  isis are wahhabi muslims which oppose worshipping of idols . 
  so they decided to go bomb the kaaba . 
  if they actually succeeded they would unite the entire muslim world ... against them . 
  we do not worship idols but this a symbol for the * house of god * . 
  the entire muslim world , from morocco to indonesia , would unite against isis if this plan goes through . 
  however not many westerners know of this behind all the lies of western media . 
  thanks !, 
  ~ signed , / u/hashtag _ taha , caliph of iraq . 
  because we would also be against the west . 
  who funds isis ? 
  the usa . 
  isis is part of the fsa , which is full of other militant jihadi groups . 
  and of course the other ways the arab media will spin this against the us . 
  we would probably stop all exports to the west and ally more closely with russia and china . 
  iraq is willing to trade lebanon for jordan . 
  its on . 
  the lebanonese people * voted * to be annexed into iraq . 
  i wish we could settle this in a more peaceful way , but i 'm a fraud not . 
  [ meta ] your going down !, 
  [ you 've got it all wrong !, 
  help protect the lebanonese citizens ! ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/globalpowers/comments/29m6be/conflict_iraq_mobilizes_troops_to_protect/ ) . 
  the citizens democratically voted to be annexed !, 
  its true !, 
  if anyone is oppressive its your communist self . 
  [ meta ] i was too lazy to right it in but the delegates sent a form to see who would join iraq . 
  everything you can do , i can do better . 
  i balance control with representatives of each gender , race , and ethnicity .
