  [ meta ] i was on my phone i 'll edit it later . 
  its a democratic capitalist state with caliphate like province governing . 
  you know its real arab spirit when comoros is there !, 
  [ why do you want to help the aggressor ? 
  the lebanese voted for iraq . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/globalpowers/comments/29jpmt/expansion_iraq_sends_delegates_to_lebanon_to/ ) [ help iraq !, 
  we are only protecting the soon to be iraqi citizens . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/globalpowers/comments/29m6be/conflict_iraq_mobilizes_troops_to_protect/ ), 
  isis has declined it plus its from a turkish news paper . 
  never trust turkish news papers . 
  i 'd laugh my ass off to any saudi that said they were more stable than iraq . 
  jokes aside , it would be pretty horrible , however america is its own oil supplier so america can fare off well . 
  the fsa is a fun name the western media gives to these terrorist groups . 
  isis `` indirectly '' funds from them because many parts of the fsa symphize with isis .

  syria [ annexed parts of jordan ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/globalpowers/comments/29i4zj/expansion_syria_sends_delegates_to_jordan/ ), 
  israel [ got the rest ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/globalpowers/comments/29kdsk/expansion_israel_sends_delegates_to_jordan_to/ ), 
  the caliph applauds pharaoh on such a quick kill of the most important person ( to christans ) . 
  long live pharaoh !, 
  of mappings ? 
  i do n't know , they do n't really have a war system . 
  yes but i do n't know if its still going on . 
  we have the lebanon troops and iraqi troops there with iraqi air forces . 
  why did you invade me ? 
  can we settle this peacefully ? 
  i would join your union but we need to have shared power, 
  i could be the economic and political guy and you can be the military and laws guy . 
  well we can initiate a democracy that is capitalist with regional autonomy but some aspects are socialist , such as health care and food for the poor . 
  would that work ? 
  what 's your idea ? 
  the economic zones would be baghdad , mosul , kuwait , lebanon , and kurdistan . 
  the rest are poor enough for socialism . 
  i 'm from iraq and let 's be real now , there 's nothing keeping iraq alive other than the oil . 
  i 've been to syria and it was beautiful . 
  however right now , it is n't . 
  but you know . 
  i did n't mean for it to be insulting . 
  there are rich parts in syria like aleppo and damascus . 
  we can partition them . 
  [ meta ] oops i thought we were meta-ing the whole time . 
  the caliph agrees . 
  however , the caliph wants kuwait city , basra , baghdad and beirut to have special capitalist zones in the center . 
  the caliph will take the economic power and diplomacy while he offers the chairman laws and the military . 
  [ meta ] sure , i can make the flag if you want . 
  the first one would be just fine . 
  ~ signed , / u/hashtag _ taha , former caliph and new minister of economics and foreign relations of the uar .

  edit : [ done ] ( http://milkkyway.spreadshirt.com/men-s-premium-t-shirt-a16564128/customize/color/317 ) . 
  i decided to play with the levels a bit 'till i decided to turn the shade of blue to alpha .

  *** yeaaaaaaahhhhhhh ***, 
  then why do you have an irani flair ? 
  & gt ; implying that kuwait is not rightful iraqi clay, 
  & gt ; implying that basra is khaleegi, 
  & gt ; implying implications,

  you deserve infinite reddit high fives . 
  this is religionist as all hell . 
  i almost failed the grammar section in my language arts class . 
  care to pm me a better draft ? 
  i do n't want to look unprofessional . 
  i mean this * is * / r/arabs and palestinians are arabs . 
  this should be very clear . 
  umm what ? 
  i honestly do n't know what to flair this . 
  on one side i think they deserve it , but on the other i think no one should be killed this harshly . 
  i did n't want to watch the video so i 'm going off the title .
