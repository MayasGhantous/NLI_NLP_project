  yes but i 'm not sure what it is to delete it . 
  also ; i 'm on my phone . 
  isis is not part of the fsa but it is technically as it still receives the funding although `` indirectly '' . 
  isis was part of the fsa at the beginning but the fsa broke it off because it was too cruel . 
  i can not stretch this enough , isis is indirectly funding from the fsa which makes my point true . 
  i can not find an article because once the fsa turned against isis all the media reporters deleted their articles and started praising the fsa . 
  full on invasion wwiii style on israel with support from all the arabs , north africa , russia , china , pakistan , and iran while israel has support from the nato and south africa and the british commonwealth . 
  the arabs win and we form a pan islamic state with islam as the main religion but we are tolerant of others . 
  we also invade every other country and make a utopia where everyone speaks arabic . 
  edit : obviously a joke , easy on the down votes .

  yes , yes it is . 
  it is bad that the killing of palestinian children goes unheard , and people do n't care about it . 
  it is bad that when an israeli boy dies , the media goes ape shit . 
  it is bad that my palestinian brothers have to endure the torture of an apartheid state . 
  it is very bad , that you are not shocked . 
  dammit kermit !, 
  so i ca n't have a laugh at what would probably never happen ? 
  thanks mister downer !,

  they 're doing what every arab hacker dreams . 
  i 'm about to go do kingly things !, 
  i 'm a native arabic speaker and sometimes i have trouble remembering the words in english so i say it in arabic hoping english has borrowed a similar word from arabic . 
  i 'm a native arabic speaker living in the us . 
  when i first came here , my friend ( female ) gave me a scooter . 
  when a babysitter came to babysit me , she asked me where i got the scooter . 
  i said `` my girl friend '' . 
  in arabic , every noun has a femenine or masculine version . 
  i was translating '' \u0635\u062f\u064a\u0642\u062a\u064a '' which my brain decided to put girl friend ( keep in mind i had no idea about the western concept of relationships '' . 
  later that day i learned that `` girl friend is a bad word '' and i still cringe to this to this day . 
  native arabic speaker here . 
  one time when i was moving from florida to fayetteville ( my family 's spent 2 months in tampa after coming from cairo . 
  ) , my friend ( female ) gave me a scooter she did n't need . 
  so one day , my mother brought over a baby sitter because she had an important meeting in charlotte . 
  the baby sitter had asked where i got this scooter and i said `` my girlfriend '' . 
  quick arabic lesson , every noun in arabic has a feminine and masculine version . 
  i was translating '' \u0635\u062f\u064a\u0642\u062a\u064a '' which is feminine for `` my friend '' . 
  i did n't know what the word female was so i just said girl . 
  i also did n't have any concept of western relationships at the time . 
  she broke out laughing and i did n't know why . 
  later that day my mom told explained to me western relationships and i still cringe to this every now and then . 
  gee i do n't know . 
  of damnings ghandi !, 
  i swer on me mum ill shoot ur fokin arse m8 im in the bloodiest gang in all of ` ngland m8 ill rip u to shreds and feed moi camel with it m8 so shut the fok up before i fok u up m8 . 
  your execution on this is flawless , / u/baghdadi _ guy . 
   trojan virus, 
  you should fix that . 
  now . 
  a trojan virus sees everything you 're doing and snoops all of your web data . 
  they know everything . 
  also they could use your computers power to feed their botnet . 
  i highly advise you look for a professional to fix it or format your computer 's hard drive and reinstall your operating system . 
  marhaban , i 'm / u/hashtag _ taha ( taha ) , 13 year old from iraq ( yes ) . 
  i am an immigrant from iraq to the us and i have loved monstercat since 1 year after i came here . 
  ok to be honest , i learned about monstercat from skydoesminecraft . 
  i was learning about this `` minecraft '' game and i landed on his video . 
  i liked the song so i went to the description to find airwaves by noisestorm . 
  i am a learning producer . 
  i started plating around with fl studio since i was 12 . 
  i do n't think i 'm that unique , i 'm just your average arab . 
  [ meta ] i 've been gone for so long ... 
  as an iraqi , i wonder why israel can have nukes but iran ca n't ? 
  what is this webpage ? 
  then why are they having these talks ? 
  he does n't use awkward seel . 
  let it goooooooooooo,

  damn . 
  this must mean a lot to you christians out there . 
  is mosul like a holy christian city too ? 
   militaries, 
  pfft yeah right . 
  i would 've recommended the ancient city of babylon but it 's not the best place to go to right now . 
  you are litterly the only guy on the internet that uses that many diaphragms . 
  holy shit dude are you are an expert at arabic linguistics . 
  you need to get a job in this field , there are many americans looking to learn arabic . 
  i really want to get out of america . 
  they do n't give one shit about arab culture and all they care about is sex , prostitution , drinking , and other things . 
  they are intolerant about the muslim iraqi culture and find it weird that i have to fast and sometimes force feed me things . 
  my family is only in america for the english language and the college degrees . 
  i ca n't wait 'till i return to \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0637\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a . 
  i feel very bad for you guys . 
  hopefully you guys make it . 
  you better . 
  computers suck at arabic . 
  thank you for your hard work . 
  i was practicing what i learned in school . 
  i know they are \u062d\u0631\u0643\u0627\u062a in arabic .
