  i ca n't make up my mind , they 're all good . 
  `` militants '', 
  its kind of pathetic . 
  i almost feel sad . 
  co chairman calls on chairman to increase standard of living in baghdad and mosul too . 
  shameless plugin of / r/iraq, 
  i do n't even know how to react to this . 
  because it already kind of happened . 
  the kurds are seceding , the is is a caliphate in iraq and syria and maliki ( who is hopefully resigning soon ) had control of the shia parts . 
  i am an iraqi and i had family devastated in mosul . 
  this is n't a joke , iraq used to be near developed but now its on its path to failed statehood , and its all the west 's fault . 
  iraq encourages syria to go after bahrain next . 
  the germans deserve this , you guys earned it . 
  people would deffinitly keep fighting . 
  because the shiite 's and and the kurds get all the rich land , but the sunnis get nothing of the sorts so their state , which also contains a considerable amount of christians too , will be overrun by jihad as no one gives a fuck about the useless land . 
  if the kurds want to seperate , then so be it . 
  i personally would love my iraq to stay together , but that 's their choice . 
  i think maliki should step down and allow for a more representitive government for iraq . 
  this conflict is mostly maliki and the west 's fault . 
  when the west invaded , they should n't have let the shia have all the power . 
  they are the majority but there is still a pretty big minority of sunnis . 
  also , the us should n't have disbanded the * entire saddam army * those were the best fighters iraq saw , and most of them were willing to work for a better iraq . 
  the west also denied the sunnis rights because they were `` oppressors '', 
  so you can now guess how this whole thing is going down . 
  * the shiite 's are led by maliki , which is a sectarian pig that only gives rights to shiite 's . 
  * the kurds are led by the krg which are the best , most democratic in the region ( although they 're selling out to israel ), 
  * the sunnis are led by their tribal leaders which are willing to help the is but are also willing to overthrow them when they gain their rights . 
  so you see how this is all a big clusterfuck . 
  however no iraqi wants iraq to split except for the is and the kurds . 
  all the other ones want a united iraq . 
  edit : no tension would not subside . 
  the tension would increase for a battle between the sunnis and shiite 's eventually dragging kurds in for the land and especially baghdad . 
  except that iran is persian , not of glorious arab master race . 
  jew is a religion . 
  realistically , all the jews in israel are non arabic speaking arabs / eastern europeans . 
  if you mean that hebrew is closer to arabic than persian , then you are correct . 
  semetic is the family branch both of those languages come from , not indo-european like persian and turkish . 
  euro can not into grammar own language stinky euro, 
  oh god ... 
  ... a regular vacation ? 
  lol yeah because if yuro = / = oil = shitwhole amirite ? 
  so ruin countries for own benifit . 
  thanks ` murica !, 
  land of the free !, 
  also shout out to eu !, 
  land of history and ancient stuff !, 
  so we are automatically boogymen and evil if we decide not to support our enemies ? 
  ` murican logic . 
  well it 's not like we 'd support our enemies ? 
  europe devastated the middle east with its imperialism . 
  but by your logic , everyone is an immigrant from africa / the middle east . 
  jewish is not an ethnicity . 
  if it was , that means there could be muslim jews which is impossible . 
  jewish is a religion . 
  it could have an impact in a sense that they will be leaving their homes , but not as big as the one you are describing . 
  muslims can handle what the christians left . 
  it 's not like we are murderous animals that run around killing people . 
  fuk u turk u r of worst turk i kill u mother and all u family u no friend u die i kill u because i best syria stronk syria relevant syria bes return bilad asham return glory return returnings, 
  my brother sucks at smash so i kick his ass , or anyone of my friend 's asses , with sonic .

  i would link them but i 'm on my phone . 
  on toilet . 
  at 4:38 in the morning . 
  i read that as \u0633\u0650\u062d\u0650\u0646 because the arab internet uses 7 to represent \u062d . 
  i do n't live in iran so i do n't know the specifics but it is a sharia state so there is a ban on some level . 
  nice work / u/kerat . 
  b-but israel are the good guys !,
