  i 'm proud of you americans for finally understanding . 
  \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 is litterly the arabic translation of god . 
  stop saying allah like he is diffrent from your gods . 
  arab christians say allah , arab jews say allah , all arabs that believe in a god say allah . 
  it 's gotten to the point where it is integrated into our language where now arab athiests say allah . 
  it 's that the israeli politicians and a good portion of israeli people ( around 1/3 ) believe that palestinians are infidels and around 1/3 want apartheid . 
  it 's that simple , the israeli people just do n't click with the palestinians . 
  sure there are a bunch on the internet that agree and have an open mind , but the people actually living in the countries hate each other to death . 
  the countries you listed are getting fucked over by america . 
  iran and afghanistan are not arab , they 're persian and dari respectively . 
  also ; that video is a propaganda video just like all the propaganda israel tries to spread like / u/kerat posted . 
  so by your logic israel can post propaganda but palestine ca n't . 
  edit : iraq got invaded in 2003 which opened up global jihad to remove america . 
  syria supported that jihad and it fired back at them , and now it 's leaking over to iraq again . 
  afghanistan is getting fucked over by america . 
  iran is in good shape unless you consider sharia bad shape , in which case fuck you . 
  as an iraqi i can agree, 
  we do n't . 
  someone linked it on / r/bestof and the votes flowed in . 
  it 's a lot higher now . 
  most of israel is racist . 
  however , on the top of this thread there is one glitter of hope , and there maybe more . 
  we just have to dig deeper to find them . 
  fine ,, 
  and indians . 
  anyone else ? 
  # * [ intensification intensifies ] *, 
  well many of your people think that arabs suck and that they need apartheid . 
  like i said , there are a few good people out of many that do n't believe this , but the majority of you guys seem to think this . 
  also ; i heard stories about arabs that have an israeli passport and how they 're not ridiculed like the rest . 
  the arabs would n't mind if the jews stayed , they just want them to speak arabic and to recognize palestine instead of israel . 
  most arabs do n't give a shit if you 're muslim , christan , or jewish . 
  we just need you to recognize palestine and speak arabic . 
  ya see , there were arab jews in the land of palestine . 
  however , when the jews came from poland and eastern europe , they took over the land and made it non arab . 
  we do n't care what religion or ethnicity you are , we just want it to be arab land again . 
  hebrew was a dead language until the israelis revived it which made no sense . 
  the best solution is one secular state that is arabic . 
  this is because jerusalem is a holy city to all three abrahamic religions , so it would only make sense . 
  what 's wrong with the middle east ? 
  * googles own country *, 
  fuck , da3esh is at it again . 
  hebrew was a dead language before israel . 
  of course there were tribes , but none of them spoke hebrew . 
  i agree with everything you said except for 2 things . 
  not every arab country is in turmoil . 
  have you seen an algerian revolution ? 
  a saudi ? 
  these regions are generally safe . 
  and although egypt had a revolution , its pretty safe now . 
  also , you said that jerusalem would be a neutral zone . 
  i agree with that but then you said, 
   as long as the western part is still recognized as israels capital . 
  that contradicts 2 sentences you said before it . 
  if its a neutral zone , i think it should n't be a capital of any country , after all that 's what neutral zones are . 
  i hate you for bringing all these non arabic speakers to our subreddit, 
  this is all of us . 
  honestly , do n't you think that would happen ? 
  with all these people talking about it , the kids would want to do it . 
  another reason is that penis is meant to go in vagina . 
  not penis in penis . 
  but then again , i am a devout muslim iraqi kid . 
  maybe in the west , but where i come from , that 's the opposite of what you said . 
  isis is creeping up on iraq and syria , russia has annexed crimea , sanctions are being put on russia , israel and palestine are escalating quickly , iran 's peace talks are getting no where , and germany might 've just started a world war for the 3rd time . 
  sorry to rain on your parade . 
  signed . 
  aside from the mass protests , the germany one was a joke . 
  i forgive you for this one joke . 
  this probably is the best thing i 'm going to see all day . 
  the ass was phat . 
  thanks israel !, 
  edit : now that we have all these americans and israelis from r/bestof , we can be sure that anything anti israel or anti american gets down voted !, 
  edit2 : i spelled edit wrong . 
  levantine . 
  did too . 
  serious, 
  nowi 'm not an a class psychologist , and this is my view only , but i 'm pretty sure being gay is a learned trait . 
  sure some of it may be genetic , however [ this article by the huffington post ] ( http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/2003361/ ) says in the end , its all your choice . 
  i do n't know about your cultures , but i know that in mine we are expected to be straight , especially if we are male . 
  this maybe on with you guys , but not with us . 
  also , i 'm sorry about the man that sexually harassed you , and good luck getting married . 
   biggest , sexiest lady in all of iraq, 
  u wot m8 ? 
  coming to theaters near you . 
  *** [ noicing intensifies ] ***, 
  bow down to the caliph cuz u just got ca ** rekt **, 
  i actually really liked the dictator . 
  i was laughing my ass off the whole time . 
  however as he said , he isnt a \u0639\u0631\u0628 . 
  arceus so i can create a world with world peace already in it !, 
  i 'm surprised we still did n't secure israel long ago . 
  they 're a speck compared to the arab world . 
  in iraq , you would speak arabic but it is mandatory to learn english , as we were ruled by the uk at one point . 
  you also had the option of learning kurdish later on , however i moved to the us before that point . 
  they are in a full scale attack on the is . 
  they are very * slowly * gaining ground . 
  they will probably secede . 
  if they do n't , it will be under the autonomous region . 
  not in the near future . 
  lolno .
