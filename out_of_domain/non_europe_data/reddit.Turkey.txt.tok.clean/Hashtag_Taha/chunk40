  how many people were killed in all on the palestinian side since 2009 ? 
  over 600 . 
  also ; israel has a mighty western backed military while the palestinian fighters have only their homemade bombs . 
  now who 's the cold blooded killer ? 
  [ here 's a video that 'll get ya caught up ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtjsywk0zw ), 
  edit : hamas ca n't afford a thousand rockets , they only fired 70 . 
  one thousand is a huge stretch . 
  / r/worldnews will rot your brain with stupidity . 
  if i were you i would stay 10 feet away from it at all times in fear of losing a few iq points . 
  well i found it on twitter , and thought it was pretty funny , so i brought it over here . 
  sorry if it is really that bad . 
  its no problem , 
  what is vox de anguista ? 
  [ deleted ], 
  i 'm sorry they were anticipating it . 
  [ ~ ~ however an unknown army appeared at the egyptian border and are protecting gaza ~ ~ ] ( https://plus.google.com/116199206228497164307/posts/rwvxbvtraz4 ), 
  picture is over a year old . 
  fuck you google + . 
  than what are these soldiers doing in gaza . 
  no one in the g + identifies them so that 's why they are `` unknown '' . 
  aljazeera maybe bullshitting about the un forces , but you never know . 
  so i was right , they are sending soldiers . 
  or does * foreign-nationals * have another meaning . 
  well that shows how much i suck at english . . 
  thanks for clearing that up . 
  i 'm going to go to a corner and cringe at what i have done . 
  thanks for that !, 
  i did n't know that . 
  however , right now in palestine , any help , whether it would be jihad or a national army , is appreciated . 
  it 's hamas . 
  however , any help is useful at this point . 
  this `` unknown '' army turned out to be hamas , and i did n't know the word exodus , so no , the un is not sending armies . 
  i am sorry for my stupidity , can you forgive me ? 
  well , we are the highest exporter of oil to china , so you guys got that going for you . 
  china looks pretty nice . 
  it 's pretty powerful , and is a great ally . 
  i would rate 8/10 could use a little less smog . 
  the chinese people i 've met are all nice people . 
  they are always willing to pitch in , which is probably an affect of the communism . 
  overall 9.5 / 10 , would learn language and visit some day . 
  i messed up , these pictures turned out to be bullshit and the un forces i was referring too was people going to other countries they have citizenship . 
  i sincerely did not understand this , and thus i corrected it , i 'm about to delete that picture . 
  i am sorry for any misinformation . 
  i agree with this . 
  god help the people of gaza . 
  what israel is doing is inhumane . 
  haha i 'm always the best at math in my school . 
  however i do n't make white kids cry , if i ever show them how good at math i am , they will say `` nerd ! '', 
  and verbally bully me to death . 
  trust me , i 've had it happen . 
  the ottoman empire sucks , we all know that . 
  and if you did n't pay taxes , you deserve this punishment . 
  the numbers are decreasing because iraqi christians * choose * to leave iraq for another euro country . 
  its the same for the jews , except they move to israel . 
  i messed up by posting this today . 
  i 'll edit that out . 
  no , all arabic . 
  some of my dad 's side speak kurdish , but we are mostly arabs . 
  the taxes were n't there with every ruler , and the muslims had to pay a zakat tax too . 
  and while yes , some periods of the caliphate were corrupt and harsh , the rest was really good . 
  muslims invented modern math ( why do you think they are called arabic numerals ) and we have been in a golden age when europe was in its dark age . 
  the slave thing , as it says in the article , was abolished later . 
  i wanted to have fun this summer , be worry free , but nope . 
  israel is annexing palestine , and iraq barely exists . 
  holy shit really ? 
  eating popcorn ? 
  i 'm sure god has a special place in hell for all of them . 
  also ,, 
  i flew this huge rc plane and it was fun as fuuuuuuuckkkk, 
  if you want pictures i 'll give you some . 
  [ i 'm posting this everywhere to let people know .

  [ on the ground ] ( http://imgur.com/rsn12sm ), 
  [ sky \\ ( zoom into the middle , its the black plane shape \\ ) ] ( http://imgur.com/avgp2ls ), 
  its huge compared to other rc planes i flew . 
  anti arab , anti muslim , side with israel no matter what , always bring it back to hamas firing rockets , trying to seep in false information with no source , etc. . . 
  i 'm on my phone so ... 
  exactly . 
  i was emphasizing anti muslim as arabs are mostly associated with islam ( no offense to ~ ~ christians ~ ~ other religions ) . 
  edit : you forgot the `` s '' in / r/arabs . 
  / r/arab is a redirect to this sub . 
  hama 's sucks , its just that israel sucks more, 
  they forgot our government buildings too . 
  its also the muslim promised land . 
  why do you favor the jews ? 
  hamas fired rockets because israel shot a few palestinians dead in public to which hama 's responds by kidnappings three israelis ( in palestine 's borders ) and firing rockets . 
  these rockets did n't do anything but israel started defending itself by wiping gaza off the map . 
  since 2009 , palestine has killed ~ 40 israelis . 
  since 2009 , israel has killed 600 + palestinians . 
  hamas had every reason to fire rockets at israel . 
  most of the time they spout bullshit and try to stir up heat !, 
  you can easily tell who they are because they will instantly link to ynet.com whenever they need a point . 
  i thought america was bad , but the arab leaders ? 
  they 're infinity times worse for betraying their brothers . 
  you ca n't really blame iraq and syria because they barely exist , but everyone else ? 
  shame on you . 
  and do n't say that algeria would help palestine if they bordered them . 
  if that 's was true , they would 've sent support by sea days ago . 
  edit : no offense to the people , offense to the governments . 
  edit2 : a few people have told me that egypt has sent a ceasefire , algeria is breaking silence , and that the uae is sending aid to the gaza strip .
