  i guess we found who we hate next guys !,

  yep , there 's no way to get to gaza by sea . 
  israel , occupying helpless little nation , one meter at a time . 
  poor libya . 
  another kebab down , another heart taken away by the west . 
  it 's beautiful , is n't it ? 
  i 'm conflicted . 
  on one side , the saharans deserve their independence . 
  on the other , the arab world is already divided enough . 
  that is actually very saddening :(, 
  damn it dubai !, 
  do you want to be occupied by whites again ? 
  all this stuff is basically a european / north american magnet . 
  soon enough , more anglos will live in dubai than arabs .

  i do n't know about this one . 
  i 'm in durham county , but i 'm too young to go out by myself and my religion forbids beer . 
  you guys have fun , i guess . 
  have n't had a laugh on reddit for a while . 
  thanks .

  in capitalist saudi-arabia , you go to america, 
  in ba'athist iraq , america go to you !, 
  also ; let 's be clear that israel has killed [ 242 people \\ ( warning nsfl pictures at the bottom \\ ) ] ( http://www.imemc.org/article/68429?utm_content=buffer0b4f6&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer ) \\ ( most of them are [ women ] ( http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/07/israeli-bombardment-gaza-escalates-20147973229699830.html ) and [ children ] ( http://www.countthekids.org/ ) \\ ) while palestine has killed 1 . 
  think about that . 
  hamas and other people are firing homemade rockets out of desperation while israel is using its western backed military to destroy the gaza strip .

  israel has no proof that hamas kidnapped the children . 
  so on the basis of an israeli kidnappings 3 israelis , ~ 250 palestinians have died .

  `` new dubai '', 
  who is the actual aggressor here ? 
  also , as an arab , i do n't want to see israel destroyed ( i kind of now because of recent developments ) but the israelis want to see us destroyed . 
  no it is n't . 
  the new government and hamas actually tried to make peace with israel . 
  they want the people of palestine to stop firing the homemade bombs ( which they are firing out of desperation ) and want to make peace . 
  your point is invalid . 
  i could have the intent to strangle you right now but i do n't do it , however you sever my head off for an intent i did n't do . 
  you just practically ignored my main comment . 
  such is life in / r/world news , brother . 
  who said it was hamas ? 
  who said it ca n't be a random palestinian group staging the abduction ? 
  there is litterly 0 evidence on who kidnapped them . 
  you ca n't kill 242 people on a theory . 
  [ this one ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2azcq2/israel_ground_invasion_of_gaza_has_begun/cj0gg8u?context=10000 ), 
  so israel was n't created to destroy palestine ? 
  also ; jihad is arabic for struggle . 
  learn to use the word right . 
  [ this guy knows that hamas is trying to stop the civilians firing at israel ] ( http://np.reddit.com/r/iama/comments/2axmvl/iama_palestinian_citizen_living_in_gaza_ama/cizxgym ), 
  he only uses israeli sources . 
  egypt was created for egyptians . 
  poland was created for poles . 
  israel was created so the west can have a mid east ally and call it a jewish home land . 
  poland was created by the poles , egypt was created by the egyptians . 
  israel was created by the brits . 
  it was not hamas though , it was some rouge palestinian that got arrested . 
  the israeli government blamed it on hamas . 
  `` the mongols are only protecting themselves !, 
  can i be a space arab too ? 
  but is it ok that 242 people got killed on the palestinian side , but 1 got killed on the israeli side . 
  [ what about mine ?

  really ? 
  it works fine for me . 
  i messed up and wrote escape instead of annex, 
  haha i 'm stupid , i ca n't edit on the phone . 
  i wrote that post but some mod deleted it for whatever reason . 
  iraq is ... mesopatamian ? 
  but then that would include syria and some of turkey ... 
  syria is in the levant most definitely . 
  iraq does have a narrow opening to the gulf , however i think it 's too small for it to be called a gulf country . 
  i think it 's mesopotamian .
