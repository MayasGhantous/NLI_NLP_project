  also , rock is edm now ? 
  that one got me on the floor !, 
  ooh, 
  that sounds cool !, 
  the i ca n't help you , sorry . 
  i think harmor can be used on logic , but i 'm not sure . 
  harmor can re sample things and it also does some pitch things too . 
  i never knew there was electronic rock , i guess i 'll check that out . 
  you never run out , do you ? 
  * grabs popcorn *, 
  this all makes me feel like a piece of shit for being in the us while my people are dying every day . 
  can you render it and and put onto soundcloud so we can have a listen ? 
  if not , then my guess would be either your drum patterns are lacking , or your sounds are not taking up the time they are supposed to , or maybe you do n't have a lot of bass ? 
  or maybe you do n't have enough reverb . 
  i ca n't tell you unless you upload it . 
  hilly shit totally stealing this !, 
  i , as an arab , can not say at his level , that oil courses through my veins . 
  i am calm , jesus . 
  my name is \u0637\u064e\u0647\u064e and as far as i know there is no english translation to it . 
  it fucking irritates me when people call me `` tahaa '' . 
  like , wtf ? 
  its taha . 
  both a 's are the same fucking length !, 
  it also irritates me when they make the sound of \u062a instead of \u0637 but i ca n't help that , because americans fucking suck at foreign languages . 
  side note , everyone tried at somepoint to pronounce my name as \u0637\u064e\u0647\u064e but they end up saying `` faha '' or `` flaha '' . 
  common iraq take back mosul already !, 
  awwww . 
  shut up kuwait or we 'll pull a saddam on you again . 
  none of my teachers have ever gotten my last name , which is al - * insert tribe name here * i !, 
  everyone is calling their track gravity .

  here are some that fit the theme of the word gravity :, 
  * influx, 
  * gravity wave, 
  * burst, 
  * earthquake, 
  * fracture, 
  those are just a few . 
  superior drummer 2 is worth it if you have the money lying around, 
  she 's a raver girl . 
  but the ass was phat . 
  because ; fuck morocco . 
  it 's litterly their other half . 
  edit : proper housing ? 
  is this a joke ? 
  best answer right here . 
  [ ahem , guys . 
  this is the * only * correct answer in this thread ] ( http://i.imgur.com/aoiz5nb.png ), 
  i do n't have an answer , i have a question . 
  i 'm currently deciding if i should settle on the name `` ztars '' or pick a different one . 
  if you go to my sound cloud , you can see the logo i already made for it . 
  pronounced just like it 's written , `` ztarz '' . 
  wtf who says that ? 
  if anyone decides to nuke mecca , be it nato or russia / china , they are going to get their ass handed to them . 
  why thank you and may saddam hussein in all his greatness bless you . 
  for a second there i thought you were asking us about the google nexus 2 . 
  phew . 
  u wot m8 ? 
  it 's uneven , we need to nerf israel . 
  remove jew go back to stinky europoor . 
  but mecca contains al qa3ba . 
  but would n't alqaeda and isis and all the muslim countries team up against whoever nuked mecca ? 
  they do n't . 
  it was a rogue palestinian that was angry at israel . 
  this sparked israel into going into full riot mode on hamas . 
  now hamas is forced to fire home made rockets to defend itself . 
  and do n't think that israel is innocent . 
  they are commuting war crimes . 
  they are targeting civilians and hospitals and places where children go . 
  palestinians want their land and the israelis want the palestinian 's land . 
  revenge, 
  if israel actually tried not to hit women and children , then why did they [ fire a rocket at a school ? 
  ] ( http://www.cnn.com/2014/07/27/world/meast/mideast-crisis/index.html ), 
  [ human shields are a myth . 
  ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/israelgaza-conflict-the-myth-of-hamass-human-shield-9619810.html ), 
  israel does n't give a fuck about palestinian life . 
  [ this website demonstrates the value of a palestinian kid compared to an israeli ] ( http://count the kids.org / ), 
  this is pure war crimes . 
  israel has an extremely powerful western backed military \\ ( [ 11th strongest ] ( http://www.globalfirepower.com/country-military-strength-detail.asp?country_id=israel ) \\ ) while hamas and the palestinians have home made rockets . 
  and israel is going all out on them . 
  also , the mega attack was revenge for the [ 1000 killed by israel ] ( http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/5623370 ) , but it never went through . 
  the palestinian insurgency attacks did n't kill * nearly * as many children as israel is right now . 
  your view on the world is skewed . 
  get your facts straight . 
  so israel has the right to defend itself but hamas does n't ? 
  the glorious saddam hussein will bless you from the heaven you believe in . 
  glorious leader will * never * die . 
  haha that guy looks badass . 
  so far , i think oman is the best arab country . 
  you do n't hear anything from it so it must be peaceful . 
  its also a gcc country and i 've seen a ton of beautiful pictures from it . 
  oman , i want to go there . 
  americans * in the uae * made fun of your name ? 
  what the fuck ? 
  might as well make it the 51st state . 
  i 'm having a feeling that you are a descendant of the hijazi kingdom , but never got your turn so now you mourn about it on reddit . 
  get down here !, 
  - egypt, 
  why thank you !,
