  thank you !, 
  turkey learned nato !, 
  meh needs more illermanauty, 
  until gaza does n't exist anymore . 
  today , our imam gave the best speech about equality . 
  he said that `` in gods eyes , we are all the same '' . 
  he also said something about the split of islam and the different religions . 
  `` islam is one religion . 
  whether you are sunni or shia does not matter . 
  you are a muslim . 
  christians and jews are also brothers , however they are not muslims . 
  they can still go to jannah if they do enough good . 
  islam is always being stereotyped as racist and hating of other religions , so prove those stereotypers wrong ! '', 
  he also said it in the most seductive fus7a arabic on the planet . 
  almost made me tear up . 
  that is actually very sad . 
  kuwait i love you so much that i want to give you a big hug , maybe annex you too . 
  shout out to ukraine , seems everyone forgot about them . 
  what the fl studio did you just native instruments about me , you little melody ? 
  i 'll have you know i graduated top of my class in sound engineering , and i 've been involved in numerous mixes on soundcloud , and i have over 300,000 confirmed plays . 
  i am trained in sound synthesis and i 'm the # 1 producer in the entire dj mag top 100 . 
  you are nothing to me but just another listener . 
  i will sidechain you with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this wavetable , mark my modulated words . 
  you think you can get away with sending me that midi over laidback luke 's forums ? 
  think again , nexus user . 
  as we speak i am contacting my secret network of djs across holland and your sine wave is being traced right now so you better prepare for the eq , maggot . 
  the storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your edm . 
  you 're fucking reverbed , poorly-sampled loop . 
  i can be anywhere , anytime , and i can bootleg your horrific songs in over seven hundred genres , and that 's just with my akai pro lpk25 . 
  not only am i extensively trained by nu : tone and skrillex , but i have access to the entire library of the vengeance 's samples and i will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable songs off the face of beatport , you little daw . 
  if only you could have known what unholy retribution your little `` automated '' decay envelope was about to bring down upon you , maybe you would have held your solo hds . 
  but you could n't , you did n't , and now you 're paying the price on itunes , you goddamn hp . 
  i will shit modern talking all over you and you will drown in it . 
  you 're fucking compressed , kontakt . 
  this subreddit downs me whenever i look at it . 
  and to think , i designed it so that it can be upbeat . 
  i 've been working on [ my first track ] ( https://soundcloud.com/ztars/ztars-chord-heaven-wip ) this weekend . 
  i want to hear what reddit thinks of the final part . 
  ( i work on my tracks backwards . ), 
  this is only the final part because that 's the only part i 've done so far . 
  [ feedback for / u/mwahahahaha ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/edmproduction/comments/2bwd29/feedback_thread_july_28/cjab5mo ), 
  [ feedback for / u/broski _ ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/edmproduction/comments/2bwd29/feedback_thread_july_28/cjabp1i ), 
  i do n't feel like linking any other feedback i give . 
  really ? 
  it 's a private track , but i thought those work with links . 
  i 'll make it public in a few seconds , i just uploaded it so that could be a problem . 
  it 's a little loud too so if turn it down a little . 
  unavailable in the usa :(, 
  why did i come to this country ... 
  edit : never mind i used hola unblocker , i 'll get back to you once i stop jamming to this remix . 
  edit2 : i did n't notice you were the same person that sent feedback to me !, 
  thanks !, 
  anyway , it 's pretty groovy , but that swoosh sound was a little too annoying for me , it 's ok in some places but not others . 
  either turn it down or replace it with something else . 
  i also think you need a little more on the low ends , but other than that it 's pretty rocking !, 
  happy cake day !, 
  wait , i have a question . 
  do you have to * link * your feedbacks in order to get feedback ? 
  thanks !, 
  i suck at equing ( and trust me it sounded a ton better back in fl studio ), 
  but i do n't know . 
  i 've been feeling the same thing about the bass , but i do n't want to side chain the chords too much in fear of ruining it . 
  thanks anyway !, 
  it 's awesome man !, 
  i can totally relax to this . 
  some of the vocals we 're off but that 's a little problem . 
  thanks !, 
  innocent people are still dying . 
  lebanon is pretty civilized but it 's not better than the gulf or egypt . 
  they all have corruption and at least one militant group . 
  * ahem * hezbollah * ahem *, 
  that is the most retarded thing i heard . 
  there is no leventine ethnicity , your either arab or an israeli . 
  this is getting depressing . 
  i know that hezbollah is a militia but i 'm not sure if they are good or bad . 
  mind filling me in ? 
  i almost died when i saw this . 
  great way to start my morning . 
  * song of time *, 
  i think veela does vocals although i also think you have to hire her . 
  before you go to a club , practice practice practice !, 
  you do n't want your performance to suck !, 
  did you make this ? 
  i grew up in baghdad and the war happened while i was on vacation which caused me to never return to my favorite home . 
  thanks america . 
  my region , iraq , used to be heaven . 
  arab heaven . 
  a first world country . 
  developed . 
  but nope , you get sanctions and an invasion while we pass it off as liberation . 
  tell soundcloud that they are mistaking . 
  if they do n't reply , you have no other choice but to change your name or lose your fan base . 
  well what do you expect to have when you are constantly bombed everyday ? 
  because they 're * oppressed !, 
  * yeah . . that 's the word . 
  you see the arabs all want to * kill * israel , israel did * nothing wrong * ! ... 
  oops . 
  relevant username, 
  the caliph wants a word with you . 
  haha,
