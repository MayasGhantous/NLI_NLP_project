  i only sometimes have problems with spelling . 
  - native speaker, 
  english was a piece of cake for me too . 
  the thing with arabic that most americans do n't understand is the gender thing in words ( for example : instead of saying the car is broken , you should say the car , she is broken . ) . 
  other than that , arabic is pretty easy once you learn the script . 
  fuck you we herd camels and were fucking broud !, 
  lol us `` goatherds '' invented modern math and algebre . 
  if it were n't for us , i would n't be discussing this to you on the internet . 
  i believe that an arab take over of israel should happen and all israelis that are not willing to live with palestinians should be deported to country of origin . 
  israel taking over the palestinian territories and giving all palestinians equal voting rights . 
  i also think changing the flag to be secular and turn israel from a jewish state to a secular one ( come on , 3 religions want it ) would be necessary . 
  i hate karma . 
  edit : really reddit . 
  you have to be more faggot than / fit / in order to believe this .

  i like this answer . 
  i like this website . 
  i 'm kind of new to soccer . 
  what is this where cities go against each other ? 
  water is h20 meaning that there are 2 hydrogen and one oxygen . 
  therefore waters scientific name is dihydrogen monoxide ( 2 hydrogen 1 oxygen ) . 
  hydrogen dioxide refers to h2o2 or more commonly known as hydrogen peroxide . 
  i mean like when other cities , like liverpool , go against cities like barcelona , what is the league called , i want to follow it . 
  thank you , i 'm kind of retarded when it comes to soccer . 
  my brother 's name is \u064a\u0627\u0633\u064a\u0646 . 
  those were the good old days . 
  actually , i take back my previous suggestion . 
  do it . 
  edit : we need more \u0637\u064e\u0647\u064es in this world !, 
  i fixed it , but it 's up to / u/baghdadi _ guy to decide what the header should be . 
  i 'm not for or against the alien as i see ba'ath as funny and a symbol of the good old stable days , but they also did many horrible things . 
  my family is in baghdad , i have it worse than you . 
  take pictures from the ferris wheel !, 
  maliki is still vice president ? 
  what is this \u062e\u0631\u0629 . 
  your right it gives khara a bad name . 
  * everyone * besides america & canada hate israel . 
  everyone , even the irish and british . 
  i love you ... 
  because hamas is a the legitimate group voted in by the palestinians . 
  they are doing what the palestinians want , remove settlers from palestine , or at least keep them from a safe distance . 
  do you know how many israelis died in the last conflict ? 
  less than 100 . 
  most of them were soldiers . 
  over 2000, 
  of course if it 's a girl people say shit . 
  in middle school i was called a terrorist at least 3 times a day . 
  a7a what does a7a mean . 
  so cute i probably will die . 
  as an iraqi , can confirm . 
  does that make the israeli government any different ? 
  i ca n't argue with you anymore , you seem to get your info from fox only . 
  i ca n't argue with you anymore , you seem to get your info from fox only . 
  iraqi kid in school checking in , totally stealing this . 
  do n't we all . 
  i do n't know why americans want to legalize an addictive drug that plays with your mind . 
  i personally want to make my own happiness , not buy it . 
  edit : reddit , where you get down voted for stating your opinion . 
  table is either \u0637\u0628\u0644\u0629 or \u0645\u064a\u0632 in my house . 
  pain pills are for your own good , they generally do n't play with your feelings and such . 
  i have no problem with medical marijuana , but smoking marijuana for fun ? 
  really ? 
  well , prepare for down votes from high redditors . 
  iraq : everything . 
  i think badly about alcohol , never had it , never will ( because i 'm muslim , bring the fucking down votes ) . 
  i agree with this , i think its wrong , but its a free country , do whatever the fuck you want as long as it does n't affect me . 
  then what is actually table . 
  oh i misread your comment haha . 
  is \u0637\u0628\u0644\u0629 originally an arab word ? 
  did you notice that you had 2 `` to '' 's in your title ? 
  he should 've made the `` o '' in `` now '' . 
  iraq 's team used to be good . 
  but then 2003 happened . 
  iraq has amazing athletes , to say the least . 
  we even beat austrailia , our invaders in 2003 , at football once . 
  you see , the thing that most redditors forget is that africa is very into rapid growth as of now . 
  north african arab states have been leading the charge , but south african countries ( like south africa ) and mid african countries are catching up . 
  * if you take a countries clay , *, 
  * be prepared to pay . 
  * but if that country has oil , *, 
  * then the us has something to say . 
  mesopotamia is best potamia !, 
  i hate how the [ wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ar-raqqah ) for the town of arraqqah says that it 's de facto country is isis . 
  aatini means give me . 
  i ca n't make up the rest . 
  is n't it haram to talk during salat ? 
  the ability to speak arabic and make lame jokes all the while producing shitty computer music that is so painful to the enemies that it knocks them out like a final smash . 
  making music . 
  yes . 
  if they do , we would have a more united palestine . 
  lol america , you never get things right , do you ? 
  why do muslims have to apologize to isis ? 
  christians did n't have to apologize for hitler , hell jews do n't have to apologize for israel . 
  it 's not like there we 're people in the arab world telling christians to publicly denounce hitler .
