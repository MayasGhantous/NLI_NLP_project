  my theory for 2015 !, 
  * china gdp over passes usa, 
  * israel invades and conquers west bank and gaza strip but denies palestinians rights . 
  * russia gains a lot of central asian and east euro territory . 
  * america , the arab world and western europe are all angry with each other so they start fiercely competing economically . 
  * ebola spreads to every nation through increased trade . 
  * isis spreads to every nation through increased trade . 
  * an international effort to remove isis and ebola is started . 
  * americas effort and russia 's effort clashes . 
  * sanctions , sanctions everywhere . 
  * the united states and russia decide to go on all out war but decide no nuclear . 
  * their allies all join in and suddenly the world is split onto 2 sides . 
  the west and allies , and the east and allies . 
  * an accident happens in beijing and a nuclear bomb explodes destroying all of suburban beijing . 
  * it is blamed on the united states . 
  * shit 's getting real.jpg, 
  * china fires a nuclear rocket at the us and america returns . 
  * russia and europe join in . 
  * planet earth is destroyed except for two countries . 
  poland , and switzerland . 
  * both countries have remained neutral the entire time . 
  * both countries work hard on re-terra forming the earth . 
  * poland and switzerland agree that poland will control the earth while switzerland goes out into space because , even in the end , poland can not into space . 
  remove isis !, 
  israel can into die .
