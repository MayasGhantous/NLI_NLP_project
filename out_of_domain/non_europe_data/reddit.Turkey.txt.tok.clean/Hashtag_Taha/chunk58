  why do i want lollipop so bad even though it 's probably not going to change my life that much ? 
  *** i want it so bad ***, 
  hnnnnnnnnnng, 
  who 's making ebola jokes now ? 
  that was my alternative title !, 
  ** c ** an you wait ? 
  i like this new meme . 
  / thread . 
  same day as android lollipop release . 
  its irrelevent , i know , but i love android and have been waiting for this for like 4 months . 
  the comet is still cool though . 
  needs transparent bars : /, 
  as of now , exactly one week . 
  my rational part is saying '' *** if andriod does n't release on 11/12 i will kill everybody on this planet including myself *** , '', 
  you do n't want to know what the irrational part of me is saying . 
  november 12 . 
  because if you wish for the blue one , well then your probably on something . 
  well if the rest of the screen working , then why ca n't those two bars work ? 
  fuck with us and we tweak it hoe . 
  i understood the piece of pop culture to which you referenced . 
  same here . 
  honestly i would not be doing anything music related if it were n't for this sub . 
  you do n't say !, 
  jewish physics . 
  you said the screen will burn with the super amoled display . 
  if you are on a road trip and you use google maps as your gps , then why ca n't the bars ( navigation bar at the bottom and notification bar at the top ) be transparent like the iphone version ? 
  you said the screen will burn , but would n't the other parts already burn rendering it useless ? 
  i 'm assuming that 's what you we 're saying , and if i 'm wrong correct me please . 
  which lags behind reddit now . 
  severely underrated app , very beautiful . 
  it looks better for me, 
  you tweaked my comment . 
  oh i did n't know that . 
  well that explains a lot . 
  i thought you were referencing a `` barely political '' youtube video . 
  apparently not . 
  i 'm not jealous or anything but i submitted this a day ago and only got one up vote . 
  i hate you so much . 
  * grumble grumble *, 
  are these the factory images ? 
  will it wipe my phone if i flash it ? 
  no it is literally just `` lol '' in arabic . 
  you guys try to turn anything into a flame war . 
  i 'm iraqi and you do n't know how happy i am right now . 
  i hope they behead the bitch before he bleeds out . 
  how is syria agreeing that kebab is stinky when syria is kebab ? 
  all palestinian dabke is awesome, 
  rave kitty !, 
  lol what, 
  ebola ebola ebola, 
  seriously people ? 
  * please do n't delay the ota please do n't delay the ota please do n't delay the ota !!!, 
  well [ this guy ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/android/comments/2ladig/artem_russakovskii_android_lollipop_otas_delayed/clsz1z4 ) would be very ... troubled . 
  so 30 more minutes ? 
  i 've done this over 9000 times . 
  its not working :(, 
  what did you do to get it to work ? 
  did you just try try again ? 
  how to fix the boot.sig , recovery.sig etc. . problem ? 
  i do n't think it 's safe to keep reflashing the radio and the bootloader to the phone . 
  after you flash all that you just press the `` power off '' on the fastboot menu ? 
  i actually figured it out , and am now replying to you from my lollipop nexus 5 ( reddit news master race !, 
  upvote for visibility, 
  holy crap i used to imagine sonic doing that !, 
  did he just show mohhomed ? 
  you want him to be putin you down ? 
  ... got worse . 
  the girl ended up being a cheating bitch so he went to drink his pain off until he died of intoxication . 
  if you can , visit baghdad or irbil when going to iraq . 
  both are very beautiful . 
  this is the worst thread imaginable and is a representation of reddit . 
  `` oh you have a cool picture of norway ? 
  praise norway !, 
  you have a beautiful picture of a muslim city ? 
  islam is a piece of shit religion and should die ! '', 
  so when someone posts some picture of dubai , for example , all the things i described above happen . 
  not just here . 
  one , we only hate jews because they hate us . 
  they took our land and enforced their own rules . 
  two , what stops me from sating that norway is a cruel and horrible country that oppressed women and hated jews ? 
  they did do those in the old days , and that 's the key word . 
  `` old days '' . 
  islam does n't do this shit anymore . 
  we do n't hate women . 
  we do n't hate jews ( at least those that do n't support israel ) . 
  we are still humans , yet you westerners keep trying to portray us as terrorist scums that hate everyone . 
  go to 4chan . 
  dont know about you , but my truth doesnt hurt me . 
  islam is a beautiful religion and so is mecca . 
  norway is also beautiful . 
  i was just commenting on how unfair it is . 
  also , you 're an asshole . 
  first , i either make a chord , or drums . 
  after that , i label & color the shit out of my mixer and become organized as hell ( i use fl studio , it 's easy to mess up ) . 
  after that , i try to either come up with an idea for a drop , or make up an intro , i will then branch out from there . 
  my favorite part about making a track is working on the build up . 
  the sheer amount of automation clips makes them special for me . 
  what does being gay have anything to do in this situation ? 
  facts are allowed , it just is n't relevant . 
  i think he just put it there to put it there .
