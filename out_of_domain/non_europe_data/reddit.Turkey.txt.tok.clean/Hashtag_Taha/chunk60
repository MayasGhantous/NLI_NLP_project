  no , not at all . 
  it 's so different and they use a different script too !, 
  they do n't even have the same letters and pronunciations as the regular arabic words , and they do n't even identify as arabs !, 
  maltese is not an arabic dialect . 
  [ defend kebab ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njra9aazq2i ), 
  well , they substitute most of their arabic words with more latin oriented ones . 
  if you compare their dialect with fus7a , it 's nothing alike . 
  this was found when abadi was in power . 
  i have faith in abadi . 
  i really hope he brings iraq up from the ashes . 
  you never see english written in arabic script . 
  unless it 's arabs trying to be funny . 
  besides , it 's called the arabic script . 
  it would make sense if the language was written in it . 
  future isis on another planet . 
  oh dear , did the bloody government take our porn again ? 
  here we go again mates ... 
  i remember the original comment of this about a few months ago . 
  good times . 
  now we wait for the properly worded one . 
  ok , whatever you say . 
  i just think that the arabic language should be written in the * arabic * script . 
  that 's my opinion , you 're free to have yours . 
  well , that 's weird . 
  but only people of islamic background use those systems . 
  it might be easier for them because they were raised that way , but as i think arabic should be written in arabic script , i also believe the chinese should be written in the mandarin script . 
  you can have your opinion , but that 's mine . 
  really ? 
  where does it originate ? 
  ( i 'm leaning towards 4chan now ), 
  ok , screw the script thing . 
  does maltese sound like arabic ? 
  if a person that speaks fus7a , and a person that speaks maltese talk to each other , will they understand each other ? 
  not that much . 
  most people can understand between 20 % and 40 % . 
  no it is n't . 
  because arabic has a lot of pronunciations . 
  the arabic script makes it easier for many dialects to understand each other . 
  i could barely understand the sudanese and the algerians on here , let alone maltese which is an entirely different language for a reason !, 
  actual emiratis and arabs are the minority now . 
  i hope i 'm wrong ... 
  no it does n't have to , but it is the best if it is . 
  arabic script was made for arabic . 
  that , right there , is the mustache of a true arab leader . 
  shhhh , they do n't have to know ... 
  that man right there , i love him . 
  i 'm not sure he should bring it back completely , but having people learn about their history is always great . 
  we deny a lot of things as arabs . 
  ^ ^ shut ^ ^ up ^ ^ you ^ ^ israeli ^ ^ fucks ^ ^ jerusalem ^ ^ is ^ ^ still ^ ^ ours !,

  xaxaxa polan i am of trick u again !, 
  any fun strategy games ? 
  kind of like civ but more realistic with a real map . 
  as i said many times , i absolutely love abadi . 
  if he can get our economy up , and defeat da3esh , i will love him forever . 
  well , he 's still a leader , not that i like the guy . 
  i was also making a stache joke , you took it too far dude . 
  damn .

  step 1 : ask / r/relationships, 
  step 2 : what religion are you and her ? 
  jesus its a joke . 
  / r/arabs is supposed to be light hearted . 
  i asked him religion because in arab culture , different religions ca n't intermarry . 
  this might be the cause of the problem . 
  3 is pronounced like \u0639 . 
  the word in arabic is '' \u064a\u0639\u0646\u064a '', 
  of course it is . 
  the problem probably is n't in religion . 
  i want to be a computer engineer . 
  well , in islam , you have to convert whoever you 're marrying . 
  because a religion , no matter what it is , always wants more people yo follow it . 
  are n't whites mostly christians ?
