  later that night junior and jesse hooked up and started dating . 
  on october 10th , junior realized how much better he is than everybody else except in grammar . 
  everything he said also came true like , `` i hope the weather is nice today , '' makes the weather nice . 
  so he started making a costume immediately . 
  `` grammar man , '' said junior , `` grammar man , * yeah * ! '' . 
  on that day junior wore the costume , climbed the biggest building in raleigh north carolina , and jumped off screaming `` ** fly ** , '' . 
  needless to say , he died . 
  just like the grammar in your sentence . 
  everything else : hashtag_taha, 
  since you read this , ima need bout tree fiddy . 
  i see that you 're mature , 
  edit : grammar . 
  i certainly do n't want to pledge allegiance to a country that kills my people , can kill any of its citizens without trial , poses sanctions over shit they should n't care about , and completely ignores shit that is more relevant . 
  you can think for yourself . 
  but what i was saying is that the words `` pledge '' and `` allegiance '' are strong words . 
  i live in the us but i used to live in iraq . 
  i like your insults too . 
  numb skull . 
  i 'm still here because i was trying to prove a point . 
  the words `` pledge '' and `` allegiance '' are strong words . 
  dammit !, 
  being iraqi i get asked this all the time :, 
  `` are you a terrorist ? '', 
  sure , im a terrorist . 
  tomorrow i would have this entire school turned upside down because of you . 
  oh and do n't forget about the rest of alqaeda that would be here . 
  this time its the white house nuclear edition . 
  no fucking shit i 'm not a terrorist . 
  this is banana flower ( look it up ) under an mri machine . 
  the machine is scanning through the banana flower in layers creating this trippy image of the insides of a banana flower . 
  not a regular banana . 
  cheers , 
  in fact ima die with my finger on my trigga , east side west side with my mother fuckin wigga . 
   quad core, 
  atom processor . 
  though it does pack some punch . 
  thank u but i got it . 
  oh you . 
  this took a dark turn ... 
  do you know of any win 8 tablet that has 8 inches and more than an atom processor ? 
  i seriously do n't want an atom processor . 
  those scare me . 
  * fuuu !, 
  dude . 
  you ca n't brag about a toaster . 
  if it 's good for you , then have fun !, 
  yeah on reddit news free . 
  french guiana ? 
  i would be an arabian prince if the monarchy of iraq was n't overthrown . 
  the supposed people that supposedly did the boston marathon bombing were never trailed . 
  some pakistani american in pakistan got hunted by a drone without a trial . 
  i could go on for days but you see the picture . 
  i 'm no einstein and i did n't hear about the trial so i assumed . 
  [ source for pakistani american being considered for execution . 
  ( not a women ) ] ( http://stormcloudsgathering.com/the-real-target-of-obamas-next-extrajudicial-assassination ) . 
  sorry about the boston thing . 
  i did n't know what i was talking about . 
  as someone affected by this i am not . 
  trust me , the nsa is spying on me as i type this message because i 'm a muslim . 
  the nsa are religionist bastards that spy on muslims . 
  i ca n't go do science without the fear that the us is looking at my dingaling . 
  btw the usa 's bush adminstration * hilariously * ignored all the signs of `` nope , no wmd 's in iraq , '' and sent troops there driving me out of my beloved country . 
  this has affected my uncle on my dads side as he was shot on his way to work . 
  we have n't heard of him since 2006 . 
  so yeah , this is not ok . 
  there little yemenese , iraqi , and afghan kids being droned * right now * . 
  i am not ok with this . 
  not terrorists mind you . 
  if you see the video in the source , it shows a picture of a droned yemenese girl . 
  how could she be a terrorist ? 
  this is cruelty people !, 
  cruelty !, 
  so to recap :, 
  * drone programs on kids are bad . 
  * nsa is bad . 
  * us sometimes take wars on other countries pointlessly . 
  * every government is corrupt on some level . 
  * science is fun * ( if you know what i mean ) * . 
  agreed ? 
  on what you just said . 
  we agree on this up there . 
  and how would you know ? 
  he probably had the controller set for a while so it turned off . 
  halo : combat evolved is a pc game that you can run on a toaster , so i 'm pretty sure his lenovo thinkpad 8 sporting an atom z3770 could handle it . 
  on april 20th , 6900 , on the planet grypton , a mother , sharkisha , was giving birth to a child . 
  she was high ( it 's weed day after all ) so all she was saying was `` gregory , ooooh gregory , '' ( her husbands name ) while having 3 orgasms at once . 
  thus was the birth of gregory ii aka junior . 
  at age 25 , junior was a talented fellow . 
  he was very good at the fields of language arts , english , and grammar . 
  he really liked to make up stories that had no ending , those were really fun to him . 
  one thing junior lacked was * fun * . 
  he was simply boring , very * boring * . 
  he always would correct anyone at * any * mistake . 
  he would always but into conversations and was generally , how do i put this , ** annoying ** . 
  on junior 's birthday , 6925 , the planet was collapsing in on itself , or so he thought . 
  the entire planet , the size of russia with one nation and a few populated areas with junior 's being the biggest , unanimously decided to spread juniors genes to save gumanity . 
  boarding the capsule headed to earth , junior said his last goodbyes , but little did he know , no one will miss him as all the people that loved him had died in a tragic accident . 
  the planet was never gon na explode , they all just wanted to party better . 
  and , on a sleeping pill for 3 years and a vr , thus began junior 's journey to earth . 
  junior 's destination was raliegh , north carolina , usa in the year 6928 .
