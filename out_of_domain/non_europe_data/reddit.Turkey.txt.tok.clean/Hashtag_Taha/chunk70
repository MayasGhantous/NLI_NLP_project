  its scary how much they spend on military . 
  in my opinion , with all that money , you should spend it on education , jobs , and infrastructure ( america 's infrastructure is * very * old ) . 
  america is an immature country that makes decisions out of impulses ( see the iraq war ) , so i do n't see why they should have a say in everything . 
  [ mfw i read that thread ] ( http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/850/147/d92.jpg ), 
  * damn godless elephants !, 
  if they 're not going to use it , then why do they have it ? 
  if iran ca n't have it , then there is no reason why israel should be able to . 
  they kind of deserve it when they take land that 's not theirs \u0ca0_\u0ca0, 
  never said anything about nuclear annihilation . 
  there is no reason for israel to have nuclear weapons if iran and every other arab countries ca n't have them . 
  it gives them an illegal advantage as using wmd 's is illegal , hell * having * wmd 's is illegal unless you 're the us , uk , russia , france , or china . 
  india , pakistan , nk , and ** israel ** are in illegal territory . 
  israel is the most likely out of any other country that has nuclear weapons illegally , as india and pakistan have mad to keep them at peace , and nk is retarded . 
  israel , on the other hand , knows exactly what they 're doing , and seeing as they are a major western ally , they 'll have less opposition if they use it against an arabic country . 
  if iran ca n't have nuclear weapons , israel should n't be able to either . 
  geneva conventions . 
  israel should 've signed the treaty of it wanted peace . 
  best answer, 
  in glorious iraq , every religion is equal * !, 
  * does not apply if you are stinky jew or infidel athiest, 
  the correct pronunciation . 
  it 's ruining its chances though if it keeps threatening the arab world with nuclear annihilation . 
  nuff said . 
   no israeli leader has ever threatened to wipe egypt off the map , or syria , or iraq . 
  i proved you wrong , you said `` ever '' . 
  anyway , fuck the arab governments they 're all western puppets that want nothing to do with what the people want . 
  the government in iraqi is bullshit , so is syria 's and egypt 's . 
  do n't even get me started on the monarchies and their yemeni puppets . 
  if this was saddam or nasser , non of these `` unofficial treaties '' would exist . 
  the only reason that israel is not threatening arabs today is because they 're not represented . 
  in my opinion , iran is our last hope of an independent middle east , free from western influence . 
  that does n't mean i support them having nukes , it 's just that if they ca n't have them , israel should n't either . 
  arab world has no reason to bother israel if israel does n't bother the arab world . 
  except it did , by invading and taking over * clearly * arab land and made their own country out of it . 
  yeah , no . 
  palestinians are still being persecuted , do you think they 've moved on ? 
  also , israel is n't your only homeland . 
  you also have [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jewish_autonomous_oblast ), 
  yes it does . 
  in palestine before british rule , the land was 100 % arab . 
  jews basically colonized the land and [ expelled the palestinians . 
  ] ( http://www.infiniteunknown.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/stealing-palestine.jpg ), 
  israelis have no right to the land whatsoever . 
  that 's when empires used to be a thing . 
  in the 1948 , the world was in a `` no more empires '' mood . 
  ultimately , its the british fault because they promised the land to both arabs and european jews . 
  while it is britian 's fault , israel should 've understood that a western power had no buissness in arab land , and accepted palestine . 
  palestinians back then were happy to have jewish * arabs * ( people who speak arabic and abide by our culture ) to coexist . 
  but israel decided `` nope '' and to this day keeps on taking land from palestine . 
  i 'm sure you 've heard netanyahus thing about removing palestine off the map . 
  jews do n't want to coexist . 
  they claim palestine on the basis that god promised it to them , disregarding the fact that christians and muslims were promised the land too . 
  in fact , in the ottoman days , jerusalem had an equal population of christians , jews , and muslims with muslims slightly in the lead . 
  today , jerusalem is largely jewish as arabs ( christians & muslims ) are largely being expelled . 
  i dare you to justify why israel has a right to the land . 
  israel is not justifiable . 
  you know what ? 
  i totally agree . 
  i believe jews have a right to a homeland , but what i do n't believe is that it should be where palestine is . 
  palestine is claimed by jews , christians , and muslims . 
  on a global scale , jews make up less than 1 % of the population while christians and muslims way over 10 % . 
  i do n't see why israelis get to have palestine . 
  if it was somewhere else , i would n't mind . 
  hell , if it was in baghdad , and iraq , i would n't mind . 
  but palestine ? 
  problem is judea is also a homeland of two larger religions . 
   many jews are atheists, 
  what the actual fuck . 
  ok , that gives israelis even less of a reason to make israel , when there are clearly more religious christian & muslim palestinians also wanting their holy land . 
   religions do n't get to claim land, 
  tell that to the roman empire , the papal states , and the islamic caliphates . 
   jews ( ethnicity i 'm assuming ) claim it because its our homeland . 
  all of the israeli jews come from other countries from europe or the arab world . 
  infact , some israelis claim to be their former nationality . 
  israel is a land of immigrants . 
  its basically a colony . 
  they would be if they make their own country . 
  stop pulling shit out of your ass . 
  african americans never created liberia , regular africans with american help did . 
  no mass immigration of african americans happened to liberia . 
  also , israel was a colony because it was under uk rule . 
  you know that . 
  yeah , well , fuck you too . 
  iraq is amazing . 
  ok cool . 
  does n't justify why you should expel the native population in favor of immigrants . 
  one of the hugest , most beautiful structures on the planet . 
  that flag in the middle , is probably taller than your house or apartment , to put it into scale . 
  i do n't know it 's name in english . 
  jesus this video is torture no matter your nationality ... 
   burn with you, 
   burn, 
  not our fault your country decided to let the us invade us and install a shitty government . 
  yeah stupid mesopotamian , gulfies rule . 
  while you have the pyramids , we have [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ziggurat_of_ur ) , and [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dur-kurigalzu ) . 
  not to mention the gigantic and * glorious * [ shaheed monument ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/al-shaheed_monument ) . 
  yet no one notices us for these , they just look at isis and disregard us for a terrorist shithole . 
  i know , i 've lived in egypt , but many people do n't know that , and that saddens me . 
   implying they 're not the source of all evil today . 
  hi i 've been looking for the middle eastern style pitchfork , looks like this : -- \u0639 .
