  do you happen to have one ? 
  aww :(, 
  sushi . 
  the thing is , westerners like to enforce their way of life on literally every fucking person on the planet because their `` always right '' . 
  countries the west has ruined with their way of thinking :, 
  * soviet union, 
  * eastern europe, 
  * south east asia ( some parts of it ), 
  * iraq, 
  * egypt, 
  * libya, 
  * yemen, 
  * most of africa ( reason why the countries are so small and no one knows their name ), 
  westerners enforcing their way of `` democracy '' , `` government '' , and ** `` freedom '' ** has ruined all of these nations . 
  i do n't get it . 
   israeli flag on the side, 
  nice try mossad . 
  * beautiful *, 
  shrekt, 
  * expels israelis internally *, 
  mawtini is the best national anthem i 've ever heard . 
  never seen it happen . 
  it might be just that one person . 
  * feels intensify *, 
  thanks for sharing !, 
  very beautiful post . 
  \u062e\u0634\u0645 for us iraqis, 
  lol what, 
  sorry thanks !, 
  wtf . 
  let me handle this . 
  nope i just did that . 
  happy now ? 
  and to get the fame from you . 
  still waiting for the arab model to come out . 
  what the fucking fuck . 
  at least saddam and assad did n't fire missiles at peaceful , non-invasive countries . 
  in gaza 2014 , gazans were just sitting there , and suddenly , rockets . 
  i 'm not a saddam apologist , but when he did it , there people opposing him . 
  that is what i am, 
  got ta eat the booty like groceries . 
  * noob *, 
  i refuse to eat or drink anything for * at least * a few months . 
  seconded, 
   my friend has this name, 
  [  ] ( http://www.zerohedge.com/sites/default/files/images/user3303/imageroot/2014/06/20140619_saad.jpg ), 
  beautiful !, 
  it 's better not to know in your case, 
  does it explain kazakhstan though ? 
  i do n't know what i should flair this tbh : /, 
  ok this might be a completely retarded quiestion , but is it qatar that 's doing that 's using the slave labor ? 
  or the companies in charge of the world cup ? 
  i dont, 
  i wonder what i am considered here . 
  i 'm so insane that my insanity spins back into the negative side and cancels out yours . 
  yesss same here !, 
  for some reason i find this funny and saddening at the same time . 
  this is also exactly what my family did . 
  i guess someone 's been mean to the emir ... 
  also , uae govt . 
  has access to whatsapp ? 
  albasheer was one of my first arabic tv shows , mostly because i only speak iraqi arabic and i very slightly understand fus7a ( spoken , i can understand written pretty well ) . 
  i am learning from him so that i can go and watch fus7a shows . 
  no i meant have access to whatsapp servers and data . 
  i know that my family in iraq loves whatsapp . 
  i absolutely love these guys , i 've been supporting them since the start . 
  i 've recently become a huge petrol head and i love everything about cars , and was pretty sad that us arabs did n't have our own car , but now we do !, 
  and it 's so stupid , so irrelevent , so over the top , it 's just the way i want it . 
  i love syria , but i ca n't donate , because no money , but hopefully allah may bless all of upu and all of those refugees . 
  that tesla is soooo hot, 
  iraq was first though . 
  no matter how much you try , you will never be the first civilization . 
  he 's only arab by inheritance . 
  he is not culturally palestinian / arab at all . 
  yay for humanity !, 
  bro i think you 're over exaggerating . 
  you know your parents love you if they 're willing to do this to teach you the language of the qur ` an ( i assume you 're muslim because there would be no other reason for a westerner to learn arabic ) . 
  is your friend a boy or a girl ? 
  iran would win . 
  if israel was to invade iran , they would have to go through baghdad . 
  this will probably bring in some more arab countries . 
  also , algeria would also join to show how much they support palestine . 
  and since it 'll inevitably turn into a west vs east type of thing , israel would n't be able to use any of it 's nukes without the russians / chinese supplying iran with some toys as well . 
  or not . 
  this is all hypothetical . 
  why use bing ? 
  i 'm from baghdad and i live in america right now . 
  i 've got to say , the city i live in right now will never compare with baghdad in terms of things to do . 
  it 's just a shitty little ghetto city in north carolina . 
   unfortunately, 
  why ? 
  cheat up man , while the government and isis suck , we still have some of the best people of all time . 
  i love iraqis , we are one of the only nations to be able to make fun of ourselves . 
  there are no jobs there . 
  \u0627\u0635\u0644 means foundation , source , so \u0627\u0635\u0644\u0646 would mean from the source or something like that . 
  it 's used in questions most of the time , when i speak it means `` anyway '' except that it 's in the beginning of the sentence . 
  imaginary is right . 
  the arab league never does anything , let alone it coming together and making a space tourism station . 
  we have bigger problems than space tourism on our hands right now , such as israel , isis , and syria . 
  it just seams so ridiculous to me .
