  as he left the capsule , he started noticing how everyone on earth looked the same as everyone on grypton . 
  he saw a women that looked pretty nice so he approached her and asked , `` excuse me , ma\u2019am , do you know where we are ? 
  i 'm a traveler , '' . 
  she smiled and replied with , `` we are in raliegh , north carolina , '' . 
  then junior said , `` thank you very much , wan na grab a drink sometime ? '' to which the women replied to , `` sure !, 
  my name is jesse , '' . 
  `` great , my name is gregory the second , but you can call me junior , '' . 
  later that night junior and jesse hooked up and started dating . 
  on october 10th , junior realized how much better he is than everybody else except in grammar . 
  everything he said also came true like , `` i hope the weather is nice today , '' makes the weather nice . 
  so he started making a costume immediately . 
  `` grammar man , '' said junior , `` grammar man , * yeah * ! '' . 
  on that day junior wore the costume , climbed the biggest building in raleigh north carolina , and jumped off screaming `` ** fly ** , '' . 
  needless to say , he died . 
  just like your grammar . 
  you fucking illiterate . 
  everything else : hashtag_taha, 
  since you read this , ima need bout tree fiddy . 
  your government puppets my country 's and no one seems to notice . 
  i 'm so eager for the elections , we need someone who can actually lead iraq so i van visit my family . 
  yes it does make strategical sense !, 
  as a former resident of egypt , i know that egypt has a lot of oil and controls the suez canal , one of the most important canals getting a ton of oil trade routes through it . 
  suez controls the trade of oil from the middle east to europe . 
  it is really strategical for the us to control it . 
  oh fuck you . 
  its all americas fault . 
  i 'm waiting till i 'm a citizen so i can campaign against all this . 
  this is weird ... 
  i need an adult ... 
  * shots fired *,

  the cold never bothered me anyway ... 
  this actually made me laugh, 
  bite his dick, 
  yemen is a second world country , it was on the side of the ussr . 
  i am iraqi , and does this stuff really happen in yemen ? 
  rape , murder and even be headings ? 
  i thought yemen was a good country but nope . 
  you did n't even try to stand up for your country , you just represented your country as a place where rape and be headings happen . 
  and the fact that you said that it is even `` acceptable '' in islamic culture sickens me . 
  iraq is a third world country as it was n't on the side of the us nor the ussr , but here we do n't have be headings or rape . 
  islam is a religion of peace and equality . 
  women choose their spouses , and ca n't marry till their at least 13 . 
  13 is the lowest age you can marry in islam and it is supported by japan . 
  these yemenese families are bad for marrying their children at such a young age . 
  also in islam women get educations and jobs , my mom was a really successful math teacher in iraq . 
  just so you know not all muslims are as corrupt as some yemenese are .

  edit : he 's a down vote troll . 
  claims to be a black man and a mom . 
  psssst ... yemen is second world . 
  iraqi here , i have lived in egypt , beautiful place . 
  i now live in america . 
  where did you learn your english ? 
  its really good . 
  hope yemen becomes good . 
  hope you live in borden as it is beautiful and egypt is undergoing a revolution . 
  good luck on everything !, 
  hey !, 
  do n't you ** dare ** forget about iraq . 
  and saudi arabia is florida . 
  source : am iraqi . 
  as an arab living in america , this is how i think . 
  seals are litterly called sea dogs in arabic . 
  this needs to be its own thread on the front page . 
  [ ... do n't forget !, 
  you ... 
  i like you, 
  one second, 
  put ''  '' before a line to add a quote . 
  example :, 
   a bear being held by a small princess . 
  what i actually typed :, 
  \\  a bear being held by a small princess . 
  put a '' \\ '' before it if you do n't want the quote . 
  [ for you two . 
  i might do this this year when i 'm in 8th grade . 
  put a '' \\ '' before the ''  '' so that its not a quote . 
  7th grader doing 9th grade math .
