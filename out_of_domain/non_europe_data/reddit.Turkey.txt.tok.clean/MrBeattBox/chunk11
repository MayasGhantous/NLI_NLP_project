   here 's the deal tho , if you spin on him he will go melee q  w  e and that is more than you can do in 2sec, 
  i never use my e first to engage to jayce . 
  you walk towards him , he will panic and eventually turn his back so use slow and he is in your aa range now he will try to go melee form to knock you back let him do it and after that you spin to him use your cutlass on him = dead jayce . 
  if not repeat the process, 
  i guess i find out why we disagree . 
  all of my senarios are around lvl 8-10 , like the mid game . 
  i kill the jayce at this point and get their turret . 
  before this point he is strong but maybe you can kill him at lvl 2 if you lvl up your slow first . 
  and if you are against a jayce god you will probably lose lane against him thats understandable, 
  old yorick was harder than the new yorick , you can kill him at any lvl its actually sad to see a champion getting worse after a update . 
  got a question : how does it feel to have 2 different size monitors ? 
  i have 23 and 24 inc monitors and the difference was not detectable . 
  now im thinking of buying 1 ultra-wide 1440p monitor and put my current 1080p monitors to the sides . 
  do you get used to of that size difference ? 
  is there any bad sides that i should consider ? 
  ggwp muricans , u manage to choose worst person who could ever be a president, 
  man i hope that guy dont start a ww3, 
  man we are talking about a person who doesnt believe global warming . 
  gets small load of a million dollar from his father . 
  all i hope he dont fuck up all world with his stupidity man , good luck muricans, 
  i dont wan na be rude but ** fuck teemo **, 
  as a person who plays this game since season 1 . 
  only champ in this game that deserves this is teemo and im very happy about it . 
  edit : downvoting me wont effect teemo . 
  u made ppl suffer with your mushrooms for years . 
  now its your time to suffer ** fuck teemo **, 
  warlords is good but dont be so harsh on fervor , its not that bad, 
  first 2 comment sums it all but try to play around his blind cooldown . 
  if he wastes it on something punish him . 
  first item can be cutlass then shiv or pd and then finish bork . 
  dont get tilted if you lose the lane your late game  teeto late game and before i go ... ** fuck teemo **, 
  that is not a build my friend that is the recipe to summon devil teemo from hell . 
  play trynda against her win every time :p, 
  mods !, 
  its time to erase that `` coming soon ! '', 
  from the trynda builds, 
  against kassadin and sivir why would you consider selling your boots for trinity . 
  i mean i got your point but man your job is 1 ) split push 2 ) kill that carrys and that carries literally made for run away, 
  man its awesome what are you talking about , they changed it long time ago with the garena splash art afaik . 
  you are not alone brother i like to go with ghost / tp on trynda more then anything, 
  i did n't know advertisement like this was allowed, 
  from gold - plat poppys i played against none of them gave me hard time , i mainly kill them b4 lvl 6 . 
  what i do is basicly dont get close to wall , dot stand in that q and dont try to spin when her w is active . 
  basicly if you dont let her make the combo on you she dont have dmg at all . 
  one last thing the buble that she needs to catch to get a shield , if its not near a wall spin to that and destroy it so she wont get that huge shield and thats when you need to engage since she dont have huge sustain you will get 30 % hp of her and repeat it, 
  but its better to wait some diamond elo thoughts aswell, 
  demon blade is cool but got the worst textures compared to others . 
  it still looks cool cuz that sword is epic but not worth for the money right now . 
  ( but at season 1 it was fckng great ) my personal favorite is sultan since i 'm turk . 
  you ca n't kill him but he ca n't kill you as well , his turrets are far enough for you to kill melee minions so you can sustain and dodge his rockets . 
  if your jungle gangs you can kill him b4 lvl 6 or b4 zhonya, 
  ty rito for your biased opinion about adcs . 
  you want everyone to play fckng broken jhin right ? 
  you already fucked graves and he is nothing right now , please fuck vayne too ... 
  damn thats sexy ... and i got a boner, 
  man for one sec i read the title as `` theatrical dictator '' . 
  then i said - wow they are requesting ama for erdo\u011fan the dictator . 
  brave move, 
  eeey back to shiv + bork core build meta , if only they bring back the old aoe guinsoo tho damn man all that posibilities with that item . 
  but anyways 8 % is not bad im fine with it, 
  it is but gunblade was favorite among the trynda mains . 
  with this buff bork will be more viable . 
  / u/abacaxiatrevido ; case dismiss this man proves evidence for this being a `` dark humour joke '' . 
  but we cant do anything about trolling and feeding about that nunu games, 
  jhin vayne draven cait twitch , all of these champs are good . 
  rest is ok but not as good as first 5 . 
  only adc is n't viable is kalista . 
  so i can say adcs are pretty ok , but thanks to rito they made the korean item builds trash . 
  so everyone is building general critical build . 
  which is odd cuz at season 6 with the marksman changes riot said that they want ppl to use unique builds for adcs . 
  i think adcs need an adc oriented armor pen item and then it will be fun to play adc again,

  10 sec is barely enough to catch someone after they flash . 
  keep that in mind, 
  for euw i can say it increased , and i believe it is caused by preseason itself . 
  right now everyone wants to learn what changes has been made so this players try this new changes and some of them fail and feed , and since they are already trying to focus on learning the champion some of the teammates can be rude at them and only 1 fracture of flame enables this already focused tryharding guys defense mechanism . 
  that 's why it feels like everyone just become more toxic but it 's just some ppl who is trying the new season changes that 's all . 
  it took me for a while to understand this and not gon na lie i raged to some ppl and got raged on from some ppl but at the end all of these raging was related to the game especially the what new season brings to us . 
  tldr . 
  everyone is raging cuz everyone is trying to learn new stuff = nobody is having fun that causes them to rage . 
  yep it 's total 1vs2 build hard carry thing , and side note it 's a nice aram build as well :p, 
  from what i see difference between s - and s is overall cs count , so try to get a bit more cs then others, 
  as a plasma bomber i can tell it 's pretty thick , my only problem with proto seekers are you ca n't dodge them it 's pretty easy to dmg with them , i know at range they do n't to shit but , there are some flying tessaracts with 2 proto seekers , ca n't escape from them literally for 20 sec they are able to shoot that damn little particles . 
  i 'm pretty skilled at dodging flak or missile or even that sniper but proto seeker is a nightmare, 
  really 10,000 ? 
  c'mon even free jam wo n't do such thing . 
  2 k cpu is cool i really liked it but this energy curve is pain at finding a balance between defense vs weapons . 
  is there any video or article explains that ? 
  omg these are awesome , can you make tryndamere pls ? 
  they took out my thrusters even tho they got some cover, 
  if only i had a pcmr friend since my 7850 died i 'm stuck with my old laptop . 
  send me help . 
  oh yea thats what im talking about thank you sir, 
  what about in other way , can i buy this motherboard and use skyline cpu ?
