looks so good for a game made within a jam . 
  car creation mechanic sure looks fine too . 
  did you use unity 's own ragdoll wizard ? 
  i have to admit , i did n't expect the beauty that is . 
  awesome !, 
  well i guess it is percentage ... 
  i * hope *, 
  actually i did n't complain once even when i do n't play demoman ( and i use loch-n-load loadout btw ) . 
  two pills takes away spamming , so it makes sense that it can kill on two pills most ; that was a fair trade-off . 
  still , i agree this nerf is pretty reasonable . 
   i guess the comedy comes from being surprised , forced to think about an uncomfortable subject , laughing out of reflex then feeling weird for laughing at such a bad joke . 
  sounded much like a part of the show [ whose line is it anyway ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssxc3bi6gho ) to me . 
  he 's like a mad scientist, 
  i 'd like to buy spec loch n load - team shine . 
  i can not currently log on to the game but i will be available after 22:00 utc , if it suits you as well . 
  hi , i 'd like to join in too . 
  i 'll send the application as soon as i got home and i can play sniper . 
  i have no comp experience though , i was looking forward for an opportunity to get involved . 
  i hope that 'd be ok with you . 
  hey , sorry for the late response . 
  yeah i guess i can but i do n't want to upset anyone if i ca n't succeed . 
  if you guys give it a try i 'll do my best . 
  come to think of it , it would be nice a ring with an led light . 
  i stumbled across this bug too . 
  tried to load up one of the previous saves and this bug broke them too , the pet is missing on every one of them . 
  pretty much broke the game . 
  yeah , did n't think about it , might as well give it a shot . 
  thanks !, 
  [ here you go ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnztqoy0et4 ),

   alexis ohanion has become exactly the thing he probably thought he 'd never be when he built this site : completely out of touch with the community that frequents it . 
  i disagree some of your opinions , but this is the best sentence to summerize him , sadly .

  you have one new subscriber :d, 
  according to this equation and his age , can we say he should go mature ? 
  this is actually a very old turkish tradition back when they are on middle asia . 
  they used to wait to name a child until he `` proves '' himself , achieving something . 
  until then , they call the child by his father 's name . 
  there is very famous story about bo\u011fa\u00e7 han , who killed a bull ( bo\u011fa in turkish , hence the name ) running towards him with one fist . 
  i am impressed . 
  loved it . 
  ca n't imagine what it would look like four or five demomen starts to use it at the same time .

  i 'd say [ whoring streets by scars on broadway ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sllpksk33na ) if the lyrics were `` is there anybody here '' . 
  reminded me [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1latj7k8zc ) ad .
