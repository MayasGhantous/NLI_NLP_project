  it 's pretty plausible tho . . 
  the point is this post is pointless . 
  for example there is greek island called kos . 
  the inner and city center part is called istankos . 
  thats why we call it istank\u00f6y ( k\u00f6y = village ) . 
  so , my theory is greek used to call constantinopolis simply polis because it is the city-polis . 
  ( also the only one they had lol ) if polis becomes istanpolis than it all makes sense . 
  and the inner part is the suri\u00e7i part which is surrounded by walls . 
  also thats is the part fatih conquered in 1453 right ? 
  because it 's not an arabic word . 
  it 's turkish . 
  and it is baklava in turkish . 
  according to the 9th item in f ) d\u0130\u011eerler\u0130 of [ this article ] ( http://www.mfa.gov.tr/turkiye_ye-ait-gumruk-bilgileri.tr.mfa ) from ministry of foreign affairs , you can bring 2 dogs . 
  you need health report from vet , origin document ( i dont know what this is ) , vaccination document , and ( if you have ) identity card for the dog .

  holly walsh is my favourite female comedian . 
  i like the format . 
  it 's a good daytime light entertainment but it would 've been funnier if they went for some clueless comedians for captains , like the role of alan davies in qi . 
  micky flanaggan maybe ? 
  the questions/facts/experiments were quite good but they did n't went for funniness . 
  also brian cox was bit uptight but i guess he will get better . 
  what a fucking disgrace for fenerbah\u00e7e, 
  such a dramatic video , that focus ... 
  yeah , i just realised goalkeeper 's kick to the post and you can hear the sound as well .
