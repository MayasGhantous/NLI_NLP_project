  - warcraft : frozen throne, 
  mostly arthas wrecking havoc across northrend plus threatening big cities , bolvar + saurfang 's son pov campaign on northrend building up to wrathgate event . 
  everybody pumped/hyped , lich king gon na gets ass whoopped . 
  betrayal at wrathgate for shock effect ... ends with countless death of characters . . arthas ... `` this ... 
  is n't ... over ... '', 
  - warcraft : light 's hope, 
  sylvanas , jaina and tirion fordring trials stories , starts with sylvanas , punishing betrayers `` tell me , what do we , the forsaken , fear most ? '', 
  `` we are fear itself my queen '' `` no !, 
  i am fear , i am your queen , i am your will and you shall fear me ! '',

  cue epic battle final battle between tirion and arthas . 
  terenas appears , thanks tirion for saving the souls , goes to arthas etc `` no king rules forever my son ! '' . 
  mid credit scene * evil laughter * green eyes appearing and fading , mystery ensues !, 
  yep , mostly to counter sluikstorters , but they can do it when somethings off . 
  he is just a man doing his job but he got ta deal with annoying colleagues every fucking day . 
  his life is like ` the office ' but the sad part is it is n't as fun as we think it is . 
  bravo for sucking more tobacco lobby dicks . 
  seriously ... 
  this government ... 
  man , i used to smoke a lot . 
  but since last year i started vaping . 
  now i just vape in the weekends just for leisure means with nicotine free flavors . 
  i am just glad i quit cigs ... 
  i can run 5km in 20 ish minutes now ( yay me ), 
  are n't we all children of nicolas cage , the one true god ? 
  embrace his divinity , we are one . 
  i know some used the ashes of their fires . 
  soon we 'll just moonmarkets , where the moons of planets serve as a pick-up and delivery place . 
  call it planet express . 
  i would like an iteration of d3 crusader . 
  flails and more aggressive use of the `` light '' . 
  flails because they look awesome . 
  current wow paladin is just too ... bland ? 
  nothing really appeals to its offensive abilities . 
  we need more weapon  light spell effects . 
  ** i am currently actively playing a shaman , hunter , monk , dh . 
  - i ca n't stand playing a ** mage ** , none of the spec appeals to me . 
  they have sickest mogs tho . 
  but i just ca n't seem to `` like '' them or even stand to play them . 
  had one leveled till 50 . 
  how do you guys do it ? 
  - ** priests ** are boring , except disc . 
  i was a dedicated disco priest in cataclysm . 
  but apart from the one spec , priests are boring and spriest rework in legion did n't interest me . 
  - ** warlock ** ( benched in legion ) ... was a demolock till wod . 
  then blizz ruined it . 
  went destro lock in wod , so far so good and now in legion ... sick of seeing demons . 
  also sickest mogs . 
  - ** paladin ** . 
  most boring class ever . 
  sorry paladins , but i hope you watch netflix while playing one . 
  - ** warrior ** ... fury is in a good place in legion . 
  that 's it . 
  the melee animations made me level my orc , am now around 103 ... but its slow . 
  i just want a barbaric character , so i guess i have to endure it ... 
  - ** druids ** ... i only like bear and cat druid . 
  just for the new forms to be available if i want to play them in the future i am leveling one . 
  chicken or resto not my cup of tea . 
  - ** death knights ** ... 
  i boycot playing since the most fun in wow i had was the blood dk dps in wotlk . 
  i know everyone was rolling one , but it was fun !!!, 
  also frost dk tank sounds and is fantasy wise a much logical approach than a blood dk tank . 
  not all our enemies have a blood circulation system ffs !, 
  frosts dks embrace the cold , make them a icy boulder in an everchanging world - ice cold killers - no emotion no fear - their very glare sends icy chills of doom !, 
  outlaw is the best spec . 
  roll the bones = rage fuelling tho . 
  but i plan levelling mine to 110 . 
  but problem with the class is , it does n't have an universal theme . 
  alliance is mostly hooded rangers and stereotypical medieval hunters while horde is beastslayers and skulls . 
  and then you have elves ... f.e. 
  previous tier was elvish themed , current tier is obv gronn = orcish . 
  tfw i was almost maining a sv hunter but kept going on my ele shaman, 
  they will die soon enough then ... 
  looks more like the wc3 chain heal, 
  they shouldve ported the games to pc if they wanted to keep it strong ... just my 2cents, 
  space snek is kill, 
  iirc the sets are complementary to artifact appearances . 
  most of them i think . 
  i base this on ele shaman + hidden artifact f.e. 
  tauren finally get hoof love . 
  the paladin armor reinforces its `` heel '' . 
  cool detail, 
  my only caster is my orc ele shaman . 
  rest are melee . 
  shaman have best spell visuals ( although need better cast visuals ), 
  a question for the dan carlin fans . 
  how based is he ? 
  does he try to stay neutral by citing pro and con sources ? 
  or does he keep it at `` victors write history '' ? 
  yes yes , i know that , but i was wondering about dan carlin . 
  it keeps getting more expensive . 
  meanwhile the 55yo nana drives like a maniac in a zone 30 and makes crazy turns . 
  ty government for punishing your future generations . 
  we will do our best to avoid paying for your retirement , 
  tbf our government hate is universal . 
  no its nomi 's specialty : burnt,
