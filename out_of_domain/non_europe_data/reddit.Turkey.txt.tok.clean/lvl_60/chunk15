  if we got a reset with wow2 i 'd lose interest and wo n't bother to play . 
  1 ) i do not have the time as before ( work/family/etc ) 2 ) wow gone will feel like a part of me gone . 
  it will hurt my gaming spirit and i 'd stay away from mmo 's . 
  3 ) i 'd rather see warcraft 4 . 
  4 ) wow is for a good chunk of the playerbase not `` just a game '' , keep this in mind . 
  modding being illegal sounds futuristic, 
  yeah but, 
  tfw everytime i try to fly through hunters lodge as a non-hunter, 
  shaman finally do what a shaman should do, 
  ( especially among certain tribal peoples ) ** a person who acts as intermediary between the natural and supernatural worlds , using magic to cure illness , foretell the future , control spiritual forces , etc. 
  demon hunter campaign is actually hitchhikers guide to the galaxy . 
  mercy bikini and rein mankini theme or riot, 
  the mad king was just sick of the behind the scene games of the lords/houses . 
  if there is one thing i have learned from got is that no one wants a king/queen and everyone wants to be king/queen . 
  and i am here thinking about my cabbages . 
  jon died as a member of the nights watch and became a stark, 
  john will die as a stark and become targaryen , when he marries dany . 
  this is the third cat mount , can we get wolves plz ? 
  i play horde and those cat mounts look out of place . 
  and the wings on cats are ugly too ... 
  afaik nerubians are still active . 
  they are good at hiding . 
  the bug place in pandaria , i just love the interaction with the various personalities . 
  and the best part was we got them as raidbosses too . 
  avoid as hell : wod zones ... 
  everything is possible , you just need to believe neo . 
  this dude knows the warrior class better than the developers . 
  he peaked a long time ago , but he became a part of warrior history . 
  he would be challenged a lot by fellow warriors , and ofc rogues . 
  the macros this dude uses sometimes make no sense , but he somehow puts in very clever uses ... 
  he and bajheera are both respectable warriors in wow . 
  pve wise he was meh , pvp was his jam, 
  what we need are cooperatives . 
  contracts given by goblin/neutral factions to do objectives in an instance . 
  temporary cease fires and cooperatoons to deal with villains , or you know , influence politics . 
  horda and alliance is black and white . 
  currently we have greyish areas as dealing with common enemies , like the fucking legion . 
  but we can also do splinter operations in benefit of other neutral factions etc. . . 
  this can be fun for rogues but also for other classes . 
  an example ; gadgetzan is being terrorized by a rich goblin , he is doing shady stuff . 
  you get a contract from a goblin to finish him , but he wants horde and alliance both to deal with together , so no faction could be framed , aka mercenary mode . 
  alas , the father got an heart attack , leaving the prince no choice but to succeed his father by becoming the new king !, 
  `` yay '', 
  * evil smirk *, 
  she was recently ( briefly ) in the news in turkey involving some pkk-benefit events ( back in time ) . 
  and the nva being a pseudo-separatist party does n't help much either . 
  she has been on sight by turkish officials for quite some time now . 
  ( the news was that europe is allowing pkk support ), 
  i do n't blame her , she fully embraced the flemish culture and grew away from her turko-kurdish heritage . 
  she is happily married with a flemish man . 
  only thing that has signs of her being a foreigner is her name and her parents . 
  and now renouncing her turkish nationality suits her parties ' essence . 
  especially in times where hating the current turkish government , hating erdogan and his akp is so hot right now . 
  she plays a smart political game . 
  in one hand belgian government tries to reduce the turkish foreign political affairs involving turkish internal affairs by pacifying its influence in belgium , on the other hand zuhal demir explicitly attacks the turkish internal affairs . 
  she supports it and said so before that `` ieder volk heeft recht op een eigen soeverein staat '' etc. 
  basically what nva also dreams off . 
  actually this might be doable !, 
  you know that 3d pieces some robes and legs have on their thighs ? 
  usually they are protection plates ... maybe we can add pouches or scrolls as cosmetics !, 
  this fucking government ... my father worked for almost 30 years in a cotton factory until it went broke . 
  he was around 49-50 when he became jobless . 
  he has been working as an interim here and there and still did n't get a contract . 
  he is now around 54 and struggling to get a job . 
  he has a limp ( his left knee is weak ) but he still is n't afraid of hard labor . 
  on top of that , due to working with old machines back then , he has a minor lung dysfunction ( nothing too dangerous , just need to breath more with intensive work ) . 
  he is looking forward to his retirement ... he was pissed when he heard this news ... fuck this . 
  there are quite some skins they have shown which are not ( yet ) available ... 
  how about we take the movie as a setting for upcoming tv series ? 
  no need for sequel movies , just series to tell the story . 
  first season would be about orcs reorganizing after defeat and prepping a second assault . 
  humans preparing for possible attack , alliances reforged, 
  second season telling the story of thrall and arthas . 
  etc. . 
  i do not know the full chronology but they can make it epic, 
  that zarya ult omg, 
  south korea did bretty good first map , second map ; russia had a good chance untill they got zerged by sk, 
  general stuff to explain in easy mode :, 
  it 's easy to differentiate teams ( blue/red ) - explaining the concept of ultimates helps and how you can make combinations - explaining team compositions ( holy trinity like dps/tank/heals to keep it simple ) - explaining how each map objectives work and that 's it . 
  plus the casters sometimes explain indirectly what team a or team b should do to win . 
  so the casting really helps here . 
  after a few games it gets easier to fish it out, 
  varys seems to put tyrion in a dangerous position . 
  danaerys does not trust varys and tyrion being back in westeros makes her doubt his true loyalty . 
  i think either tyrion will be forced to personally deal with cersei , or if jaimie is alive and captured by dany , they will plot to kill cersei ... and maybe cersei will find out and kill jaimie herself ... 
  jaimie is on his way to redemption , he will either fuck up and go the dishonorable route or he will end heroicly . 
  and we still have the rockstar greyjoy, 
  i like you, 
  disable chat and do your best ? 
  we had a 88h genji main in silver ... he only got kills with his ult and refused to acknowledge he got countered by symmetra . 
  ** bran stark leveled up from apprentice cripple to archmage three-eyed raven **, 
  good doomfists are insane , but they have good counters . 
  only thing that bums me is the buggy wallkills . 
  and also for newbies , doomfist is not a tank !, 
  ** littlefinger has left the game **, 
  ** varys has entered the game **, 
  is all we know atm, 
  pm me ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  how about she takes her dragons and burn down the iron bank estates ? 
  down with system !!,
