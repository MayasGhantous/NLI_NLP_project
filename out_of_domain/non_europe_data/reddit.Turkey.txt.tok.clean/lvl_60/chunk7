  never thought i would like it . 
  i know what they will experience : op bastion, 
  i still do them on my pally and monk alt . 
  grants a good full level . 
  it seems the team does n't want to force symmetry . 
  the team does n't want to force symmetry . 
  my ele shaman solos all elites except for world bosses . 
  if my earth ele is up , that is . 
  she is like danaerys and she inherits her fathers madness . 
  why do people hate tactical torb ? 
  a smartass can pull tactical torb off . 
  just get a decent rein and make him play around the sentry . 
  torb can flank and do n't need to babysit sentry . 
   `` i am here to kick ass and drink beer ... hic ... and i am all out of beer '', 
   `` c-can ' t we handle this like real gentlemen '', 
   '' last time i checked ... hic ... you are neither men ... hic ... nor gentle . '', 
  if we gon na go the funny route with monks atleast let this happen, 
  suramar is huuuuuuuge . 
  not even counting the metropolis, 
  adblock is dodgy . 
  stay away from adblock . 
  maybe to show their `` rank '' among themselves ? 
  the stronger imps have more rings ( the larger imps ), 
  the belgian monarchy are saksen-coburgs or something german/austrian and are related to the english ones in someway . 
  also was n't the english one changed to windsor to avoid blamage during ww2 ? 
  its funny that belgium , an already ethno-culturally divided country - flemish and walloons - have total strangers as monarchy . 
  i have to attend raids every tuesday and thursday , i am fighting a real war . 
  typical political bullshit . 
  in belgium they raised the age of retirement but when they had to vote for themselves , they blatant went against it . 
  people must suffer , but politicians not ? 
  selfentitled pricks, 
  i would start predicting election outcomes and start manipulating the countries politics . 
  then i would need human sacrifices , gained by senseless wars , so i can strife for immortality . 
  orc ww monk ( can not wait till 2h ; - , 
  flight masters whistle as a lvl 10 reward to make levelling more attractive in azeroth . 
  by the title i thought this was a vulcano/earthqiake disaster movie and cba . 
  now i will def watch, 
  make quickplay a continuous mode where you can jump in and out without penalties etc. 
  make hero selection time short and cards short plus let us vote on maps during the cards . 
  another suggestion would be queuing as defense & attack/support/tank with standard 2 - 2 - 2 setup . 
  when the hero selection screen comes up you can only pick chosen role . 
  perhaps do this within ** arcade mode ** - it would be an excellent addition for those who want to hone their skills in a certain role with the freedom of picking any role hero . 
  well we had a couple of insertions of somekind . 
  it awakened a weird fetish ... 
  do not forget . 
  this is art . 
  this is a visualization you may frown upon but it is no different as half naked ladies in renaissance paintings and those anatolian fertility megadick figures . 
  i want to see more wednesday . 
  he is like a rolemodel for me . 
  take your time , relax , chill . . plan accordingly and plan ahead . 
  and do your thing , but if you can , let others do your thing for you . 
  if this is democracy - then turkey is going the right the direction !, 
  america lead by example !, 
  one of the most criminal and most active lobbies are the immo offices . 
  ye , and when i compliment them it is not flirting . 
  saying you smell nice is a way of appreciating you not smelling like shit . 
  but do not ask us if we like your new perfume better since we are not dogs and our scent only differntiates good smell , sweat and fried food . 
  god . 
  gee , evolution skipped that inconvenience for what reason ? 
  establishing dominance in the airspace, 
  i avoid bromance with girls . 
  hanging out with a group is okay . 
  i tend to like girls in general , i can not be bff with one because my weewee acts strange . 
  fantasy : softcore girly whirly, 
  reality : watch a movie and eat like a man . 
  minimal make up is ok . 
  but please do not overdo it . 
  you have to accept your natural beauty . 
  if you do not see it try a blind guy . 
  only armpit is a turnoff . 
  but please keep the mustache . 
  girls are insane with the texting . 
  i pref calling and talking . 
  i am too lazy too type ... 
  mine is junkrat and i have 150h + on him . 
  i also note that i can be quite effective vs pharah 75 % of the time . 
  midair mines are my thing now . 
   this ship still sails ( hooked = anchored ), 
   i 'll get you, 
   ** grunts angrily ** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bydhs6upo8g, 
  just give us the option to xmog fists into other 1 handers dammit, 
  just do n't . 
  its like goths and emo 's trying to be the darkest/edgiest in their own ways . 
  blizzards best city creation and they bench it, 
  he is not that rich though . 
  he just knows his ways . 
  haha , like how they refused the raising of their retirement age ? 
  they do not give a shit about the people that elected them . 
  the government you see is not ours . 
  the traditional parties are dragging down the country and i hate to say it but even the vakbonden know it and hate it l. 
   torb on attack is 4 fite, 
  honenestly honey , you and me both know she wants the illi-d, 
  the lore is really lackluster . 
  aside from aponi brightmane and her cultish light/sun worshippery we really do not get any insight in its theology . 
  the paladin in pandaria , dusko ? , has some semi-interesting bits . 
  thats it . 
  we are still using xp here and we are quite an important government institute ( belgium ) . 
  its hilarious tbf . 
  our it department is pleading for almost 5 years to fund upgrades . 
  the poor dudes are in constant stress and await the day for someone to fuck it up .
