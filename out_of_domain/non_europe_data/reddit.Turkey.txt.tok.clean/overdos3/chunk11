  i liked the part where it gave me diabetes, 
  what are you , a teenager ? 
  that 's not the way it works ... 
  i did n't say 30 minutes was n't ok . 3 hours is a bit optimistic , that is all . 
  yeah well you do n't explain shit that way in a movie . 
  exposure = lame, 
  no ... no they do n't . 
  well why do n't you ?

  adjust the resolution of your screen, 
  do n't know why you 're getting downvoted , really . 
  this subreddit can be so mean sometimes . 
   turkey has become more democratic and representative, 
  as a turk , lol, 
  who says he wants protection ? 
  is n't the list ` top 50 ** metal ** songs of the 21st century ' ? 
  you mean nipple rings ? 
  i do a quick scan at least once a week . 
  my software automatically performs a full system scan ( in the background , much slower ) every 2 weeks or so ( norton 360 ), 
  wh ... what ? 
  do the goddamn ama, 
  hmm . 
  carry on then . 
  you realize there 's always that thing called ` privacy settings ' right ? 
  not sure if sarcastic, 
  let 's not make this a thing . 
  everyone 's problem . 
  yes . 
  then who was phone ? 
  uhh ... actually , no they do n't . 
  this is a very interesting theory . 
  god you really need to go away, 
  was n't that hard to see , really . 
  what you did there , i see it, 
  someone was on a certain thread, 
  do n't leave us hanging, 
  thanks . 
  very interesting stuff, 
  santa monica checking in !, 
  another thing that sort of ruined that climax for me was how the cartel was looking for only 2 cops in the whole city and the way that was squeezed in at the last minute ( that nightvision sequence of the head of the cartel giving the order ) . 
  kinda seemed ridiculous to me but overall the movie was very good . 
  no idea why you 're being downvoted , really . 
  the movie was n't special at all . 
  do n't see what the fuss is about . 
  i know i 'm going out on a limb here ( possibly ) but i 've never experienced any sort of trouble with apple maps . 
  turn by turn is awesome , places are all up to date etc. 
  no problems so far , really .
