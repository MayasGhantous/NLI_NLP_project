   danny carey : um , really good . 
  i mean we 're still -- believe it or not !, 
  -- still working on it [ laughter ] -- it 's like an ever-evolving thing , it 's probably going to turn into a thing that 's like , uh , a big trilogy type of feel to it , sort of life , just like disposition and intension and triad , like on the lateralus record or something . 
  it will probably be over a 20 minute piece when it 's all finished , so it will be a good part of the record . 
  we 're dealing with it in sections , but it 's coming together really well , we 're having lots of fun working on it , that 's for sure . 
  yes . 
  just noticed , he said ` disposition , ** intension ** and triad ' . 
  reflection is so very underrated , even by tool standards . 
  this . 
  they 're just reposting what maynard said on pulse radio couple of days ago . 
  nothing to see here , carry on . 
  awesome cover , really . 
  loved the solo in the mid breakdown . 
  wow , no reference to beast from x-men ? 
  really , reddit ? 
  i am disappoint . 
  this is not funny anymore, 
  a novelty circlejerk . 
  approved . 
  carry on . 
  replying to check later ... for ... s. . . science . 
  do n't worry , man . 
  i honestly chuckled at your comment . 
  i 'm with you there . 
  nothing special about in 'n' out in my opinion . 
  five guys is much better .

  edit : fuck me for trying to help you , right ? 
  why are you blaming me ? 
  i just gave you an alternative choice . 
  so , no , fuck you , you ungrateful cunt, 
  third eye ? 
  that movie would be gangs of new york, 
  m. . . me . 
  you realize you can remote control your pc , right ? 
  teamviewer is a good example . 
  nails . 
  he 's good but he did n't have any roles good enough to have him nominated . 
  maybe as david in prometheus ( i know someone will say shame but i thought it was a very average movie that tried too hard to be provocative ) he could have gotten a supporting actor nomination . 
  yeah no i like him . 
  i think he can act . 
  i just do n't think he 's played in your typical oscar worthy drama yet . 
  i 'm sure he will , though . 
  i probably do more than you , if i 'm being honest . 
  i gave my opinion on the matter and i got downvoted for not thinking an actor is n't worthy of an oscar . 
  and now some dumbass thinks he 's insulting me . 
  this subreddit is full of snobs like you who think their opinion is the only one that matters . 
  fuck you . 
  wow . 
  bet you put a lot of thought into that one , huh ? 
  what a wise man . 
  very mature and honest . 
  he set an example for every heavy metal artist out there ( or every artist for that matter ) . 
  i was afraid had he been found guilty , that would pretty much be the end of lamb of god , a band i love dearly . 
  and now that he 's been acquitted ... 
  i ca n't even begin to express my excitement for the new album to come . 
  randy sure must have some deep ( and incredible ) lyrics written . 
  you do n't get it , though . 
  yeah , let 's all blame our incompetence on americans . 
  former republic of turkey . 
  google exists , you know . 
  this is ten times better than op 's video . 
  simply unbelievable . 
  i love how phil and rob is absolutely speechless during the mid-solo part . 
  that kid nailed every note . 
  kudos to him . 
  vocals - tommy giles rogers ( between the buried and me ), 
  guitar - jeff loomis ( ex-nevermore ), 
  guitar - paul waggoner ( between the buried and me ), 
  bass - troy sanders ( mastodon ), 
  it 's called istanbul . 
  i thought the question asked what you found out about your own culture after you traveled to another country , not just brag about it . 
  you need to see more places , brah . 
  i just had sex . 
  like i said , `` butthurt americans '', 
  but do we have enough sentries to protect it ? 
  you seem butthurt . 
  i too know the lyrics to that song . 
  you do n't need to master something to have a fucking opinion . 
  hell , it 's about time . 
  well , they 're in different rooms , hence the ** wireless ** in the title . 
  hmm . 
  $ 110 in total , let 's say $ 120 with taxes , more or less . 
  this seems like the cheaper option ( compared to asus ' wicast ) . 
  same here . 
  i wish guitar pro would just transpose tracks automatically . 
  it gets frustrating sometimes , having to transpose each track ( excluding the obvious ones like drums of course ) . 
  that 's telekinesis , kyle . 
  th ... that did n't even make sense . 
  well then i 'm glad it 's not you running things , then . 
  was not disappointed . 
  is it a trip to maynard 's wineyard ? 
  who the hell let you off your leash ? 
   i agree , fuck time warner !, 
  ftfy, 
  i 'd say the self-titled track on deliverance is very accessible .
