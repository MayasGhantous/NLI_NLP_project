  any movie made after that is worth waiting at least 20 years to be able to determine whether it belongs on this list , i think . 
  which movies and directors do you think i skipped ? 
  i 'm genuinely curious . 
  which movies by those directors ? 
  i 'd be happy to add them if you can get more specific . 
  those are great choices .

  any other modern/recent directors you would include ?

  that 's really helpful . 
  thanks for the suggestions . 
  excluding the mighty between the buried and me . 
  you might be right .

  maybe you should say more than ` take off thx ' and be more specific so i can tell what you 're talking about .
