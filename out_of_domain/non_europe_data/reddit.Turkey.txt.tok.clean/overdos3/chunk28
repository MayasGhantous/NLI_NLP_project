  i 've been taking ambien for the last couple of weeks and while it does help me fall asleep , i still wake up after 2 hours or so .

  personal record in 4 years . 
  i laughed .

  there 's a thread about a movie you have n't seen yet , you choose to click it and complain about spoilers ? 
  what did you think people were going to talk about in a thread about a movie you have n't seen ? 
  you should * assume * people will mention the ending . 
  it 's really your fault for clicking it .

  he is legend - attack of the dungeon witch, 
  his hair is the helmet . 
  i find this mentality ( `` do you really want to be playing someone else 's guitar ? '' ), 
  stupid . 
  the idea of signature guitar to me is said musician is good enough to have companies build a guitar according to their specifications . 
  they have input . 
  if you like their sound and tone , you should n't really pay attention to what your friend says . 
  if what he said was true , then every guitar ever is a signature because * someone * designed it . 
  this one happens to be a collaboration of schecter and gates . 
  that said , i am not a big fan of gates ' signature schecter because of the invaders on them . 
  they 're too muddy for my taste . 
  but it 's a nice looking guitar and you can always replace the invaders . 
  if you like gates ' tone , go for it . 
  all of california is covered and still no los angeles ?
