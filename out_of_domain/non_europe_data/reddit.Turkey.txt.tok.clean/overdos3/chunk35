  i do n't know and i do n't want to know . 
  i want to be surprised ( and they will undoubtedly surprise me as they always do ) . 
  and they 're all neighbors . 
  something 's going on in that region, 
  is that a family guy reference ? 
  if it is , i feel bad for everyone downvoting you . 
  that de-escalated quickly, 
  no u, 
  dude , you should go to ` an evening with dream theater ' . 
  almost 4 hours of incomprehensible wankery . 
  ... i kid , i kid . 
  dt is one of my all-time favorite bands , but my god is that setlist long . 
  who said that ? 
  [ for those who have no idea what these guys are referencing .

  mastodon is fucking terrible live . 
  seen them 3 times and all of them were awful . 
  idk why i keep going to their shows, 
  i would like to have a threesome with emily blunt and charlize theron . 
  please forward to their respective agents . 
  that is all . 
  shit so am i, 
  i have no idea why people are downvoting you . 
  it should be obvious to anyone with decent hearing that her voice is heavily processed . 
  it 's sad people get downvoted for telling the truth . 
  same . 
  let 's watch it together ? 
  or baltimore specifically ... 
  well he was n't replying to the comment that said ` watch city of god to learn about brazil ' ... 
  [ they 're onto us !,

  now , now ... 
  as someone who just started watching that show , i salute you, 
  that 's horrible . 
  fuck all that people . 
  10/10 top lel, 
  it 's not your fault . 
  hi david !, 
  big fan here . 
  bilo 3.0 is a killer album . 
  my question is ; would you be interested in mixing eps of amateur bands ? 
  i would love to have my ep mixed by you . 
  i love devin 's work but this is nowhere near prog music . 
  this is pure country/alt rock . 
  edit : downvotes for telling the truth ? 
  really ? 
  * sigh * yes ... yes it was . 
  what makes you say six flags do n't maintain their park ? 
  genuinely curious . 
  do you play tagpro by any chance ? 
  i 've been trying to learn it on my own by trial-and-error but i mess up all the time . 
  how did you learn ? 
  prs se owner here . 
  i had the same issue , drove me crazy . 
  sadly , the nut and tuners on the se series are a joke . 
  i replaced the nut with a tusq and got myself some planet waves auto trim tuners . 
  tesseract - altered state, 
  intervals - a voice within, 
  haken - the mountain, 
  some of my recent favorites . 
  also , as a band whose influences are very obvious on btbam , dream theater does an amazing job of filling that void btbam leaves after you discover them - because nothing else satisfies you . 
  ca n't say i do n't agree with you but octavarium ( the song ) is probably the most epic song dt has ever done . 
  i personally find ashe o'hara vocals much better than their previous vocalist and altered state to be more coherent and mature in terms of its structure and atmosphere but i like one too . 
  both are absolutely killer albums . 
  itt : no celebrity, 
  it 's not the * best * title , yeah , but is it really the * worst title * ** ever ** ? 
  let 's do this !, 
  going hardmode, 
  a certain bay should prove helpful in this case, 
  i enjoyed reading this . 
  congrats dude !, 
  that 's pretty hilarious . 
  was in the middle of edging then saw this post and stopped . 
  thank you, 
  edit : welp nvm . 
  relapsed, 
  do you know it ? 
  really ? 
  a bullet in the head for biting ? 
  i would n't even bother looking it up the mystery is what makes it cool, 
  wait what ? 
  you 're swedish are n't you ? 
  are n't middle schoolers even younger in sweden ? 
   neither have entries in the metal archives . 
  thus , not metal . 
  oh , ok . let 's have a fucking website determine what 's metal and what 's not . 
  this is the dumbest shit i 've read on this subreddit . 
  water-core ? 
  atmospheric sludge oceanic metal ? 
  i think * everyone * has thought about doing this at least once in their life . 
  my personal nightmare is a plane crash and this would be my contingency plan . 
  oh god i 'm too drunk for this, 
  dude quit stalling and eat the damn hat, 
   rich old white men, 
  so kim dotcom in about 20 years ? 
  wow . 
  this is sweet, 
  guys you 're all missing the important thing he said ; ** they 'll probably make another concept album ** . 
  how awesome is that ?
