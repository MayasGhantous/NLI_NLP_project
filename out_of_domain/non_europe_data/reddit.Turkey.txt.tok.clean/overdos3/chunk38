  los angeles disagrees,

  i think you got your answer . 
  i understand why people like it but personally , it was a big turn-off . 
  it sounds too ... manic , which can be a good thing of course depending on the music but for some reason i just could n't get past them, 
  it 's ok , you can say ` funny as fuck ' . 
  we 're a non-judgmental bunch . 
  too much time on his hands ...

  ewww, 
  prying open my third eye, 
  yeah , i wan na hear the chorus with dan, 
   we have best league ( in terms of entertainment and overall ability across all teams ) in the world though so that makes up for it . 
  this made me laugh . 
  yeah it 's not grunge buddy get out of this thread, 
  this whole exchange is really exciting . 
  i ca n't wait to get home and listen to these tracks you guys have recommended . 
  dark ambient has a mystery to it . 
  opeth - burden, 
  wait which one ? 
  have you actually read the article ? 
  it says they hope to record it at the end of 2014 . 
  exactly . 
  it 's clear that there 's not going to be an album this year . 
  not really . 
  it would be justice . 
  wait ... slut or slit ? 
  i 'm sure he knows . 
  i think he was asking what song,

  why so mean though, 
  / wtf has an etiquette i got ta follow ? 
  i had no idea ... 
  album 's meh but i liked the artwork , although it 's a little too video gamey for my taste . 
  color choice is perfect though . 
  what was the comment ? 
  what did she say ? 
  her comment 's deleted , what was it ? 
  i think for me it 's a tie between omrth , pale communion and the flesh prevails ( for now ) . 
  ca n't wait for the contortionist - language though , that 'll be a strong contender for sure, 
  what a bitch . 
  haha yeah totally forgot about those . 
  amenuensis is a sick album , so is joy of motion although i 'm not sure if i would say ` album of the year ' aboht either of them . 
  top 5 for sure,
