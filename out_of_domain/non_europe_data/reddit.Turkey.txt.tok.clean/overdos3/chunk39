  if there is reincarnation , i wan na be reincarnated as a tiger ( a free one ) . 
  this is very wrong . 
  musical talent is a thing and while sense of rhythm * can * be improved with practicing to a metronome , it is something you 're either born with or not . 
  w. . . why did i click on that ... 
   multiple studies, 
  source ? 
  a book = / = scientific study, 
  just ... why, 
  holy crap the racism in this thread is astounding . 
  right , let 's all blame the turks !, 
  seriously , how does this shit have any upvotes ? 
  if they 're citizens , they 're germans . 
  why would you hope for a war of any kind ? 
  that 's messed up . 
  source ? 
  or is this just you assuming ? 
  i like how germans claim to be very open-minded in general but when it comes to immigration , it 's like the whole fucking country ( or any germanic country for that matter ) goes 50 years backwards . 
  and yeah , totally downvote me . 
  we all know reddit is one non-racist community , amirite ? 
   holy crap the ** discrimination ** in this thread is astounding . 
  happy ? 
  making observations and stating facts is n't spouting off the rallying cry of the left . 
  if you knew the difference , you 'd be more careful about the horseshit coming out of your mouth . 
  d. . . did you just try to rationalize discrimination ? 
  that 's fucking hilarious . 
   made up categories of fruits and vegetables, 
  they 're not made up . 
  what are you guys even talking ab, 
  wh ... how ... how does that even happen, 
  colors - between the buried and me, 
  crack the skye - mastodon, 
  ashes of the wake - lamb of god, 
  holy shit is that elon musk ? 
  but we 're not in the 24th century ... 
  guitarist and drummer here ;, 
  scenes from a memory , followed by octavarium, 
  * overwhelmed as one would be placed in my position , such a heavy burden now to be the one , born to bear and bring to all the details of our ending , to write it down for all the world to see ... 
  but i forgoot my peeen *, 
  that 's fucking hysterical, 
  i know you 're joking but just wanted to point it out for the uninformed ; holocaust is not a german word . 
  [ dillinger escape plan ... is not metal ? 
  edit : gee you guys really downvote everything you disagree with do n't you, 
  this whole argument/discussion about whether this or that band is metal is so stupid ... 
  that being said , i definitely think btbam is as metal as it gets, 
  well . 
  i guess the whole argument whether a certain metal band is metal is really subjective . 
  i think dep has more metal elements than hardcore in its music . 
  puciato is like you said , typical but excellent hardcore vocalist but i also think hardcore is n't its own genre . 
  it 's a subgenre of metal . 
  i know this is against the popular opinion here but when i try to think of one word to describe dep , the only one i can think of ( besides ` crazy ' or ` jazzy ' ) is * metal * . 
  what i mean is , hardcore punk is where hardcore originates from , but it has since evolved into a completely different thing . 
  spoken like a true poet, 
  wow . 
  amazing, 
  23 here, 
  i have no idea what it is but it scared the shit out of me, 
  i had no idea i 'd come to this thread and end up fapping ... sigh, 
  * unzips *, 
  genius . 
  or stupid . 
  i still have n't decided . 
  i would also add dustie to that . 
  after they played the house of blues in hollywood last year , he was the only one to come off stage and greet the fans . 
  not that paul , tommy and dan are dicks but dustie 's super nice . 
  likeable : dustie waring , randy blythe , mark morton , john petrucci , brent hinds, 
  meh : maynard james keenan , anders friden and mikael akerfeldt, 
  anders from in flames is kinda douchey , both in interviews and on stage . 
  you do n't go on a us tour and insult the fans who paid to see you by saying `` so americans ... why are you so dumb ? '', 
  ( the wiltern in la in 2011 ), 
  even got booed by a couple of people . 
  trivium on the other hand , who opened for in flames , totally killed it and just seemed super nice . 
  i 'm not a big fan of trivium but goddamn they know how to put on a show . 
  i ca n't tell if what you said is supposed to be in any way sexual, 
  then why even bother typing that ? 
  we do n't care . 
  ** haha **, 
  wtf, 
  maybe on a certain bay ? 
  gee , you 're a douche op, 
  2/10 for effort, 
  there 's a reason star wars is considered american mythology . 
  i am trying to submit it to those subreddits also but i have to wait a little before i can . 
  appreciate the guidance though . 
  thanks !, 
  yeah my first song ever . 
  i 'm glad you dig it man . 
  thanks for the kind words . 
  and yeah , the vocals need a lot of work , so does the mixing i feel like . 
  hey thanks for the kind words man . 
  glad you like it . 
  i actually tried staying away from anything remotely djent but i guess i failed . 
  it 's probably my shitty pickups . 
  yeah , and as far as vocals go , that was the hardest part to `` mix '' ( i suck at it ), 
  but i 'm glad you dig the songwriting . 
  thanks for listening, 
  thanks for listening man !, 
  mixing is terrible but i 'm thinking i might actually pay someone to mix it for me if i can afford it, 
  thanks for listening man . 
  vocals definitely need a lot of work . 
  and that 's a great tip , one i 'll certainly use in the future .
