  i 've been following the guy for a very long time and never heard him say ` i 'm better than x ' . 
  why are you making shit up ? 
  even a cent you donate helps change the world , man . 
  they own the fucking game . 
  even though it 's frustrating , it is the reasonable thing to do . 
  please do n't ever do business . 
  with anyone . 
  i would love to see old movies directed/played by people of our times . 
  like inception directed by kubrick or shutter island by hitchcock . 
  kubrick wrote a song ? 
  wow never knew this . 
  oh god . 
  just looked it up on wikipedia and boy , am i dumb . 
  wait , which one is the one where samuel l jackson is the villain ? 
  edit : is it unbreakable ? 
  ` mc holy shit, 
  fin what the fuck ', 
  lol, 
  oh god this is hilarious . 
  i need to do this . 
  [ here you go ] ( http://pwwwblog.ibeatyou.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/fat_pants_too_small.jpg ), 
  as a person who is completely ignorant about law , i always wanted to know why/how investigations and prosecutions cost money . 
  how does that work ? 
  i want to try this . 
  you have no idea what this is about do you ? 
  this is about the studios , not the movies themselves . 
  this is simply trying to find a new way of producing and distributing those movies/shows . 
  actors and directors are not involved here . 
  you mean a video ? 
  did you really have to say ` my ipad 2 ' ? 
  what happened to just calling it an ipad ... 
  lol no you 're not being condescending at all . 
  i did n't get the joke obviously but still thought it was pretty funny . 
  do you really think people care about which generation ipad you have ? 
  and to answer your question , yes , i call my car ` my car ' as in ` my car has some engine problems ' as opposed to ` my volkswagen rabbit 2.5 has engine problems ' . 
  were n't you like bashing naniwa the other day in some thread ? 
  edit : just looked at your history ; yeah you were . 
  what 's with the sudden change if you do n't mind me asking ? 
  do not take more days off , please . 
  an original comment . 
  what a great insight . 
  such ... great ... insight ... 
  all protoss has is its aoe . 
  their tier 1 units are weakest in terms of cost effectiveness , that 's why as a race it relies on aoe ( ht 's , colossus , archon ) . 
  edit : [ relevant ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/owo3e/late_game_tvp_a_strategic_analysis/c3kokmq ), 
  i get everything but ` cost larva ' ? 
  what else is it going to cost ? 
  is n't that how zerh mechanics work ? 
  yeah well they make up with their mobility . 
  protoss is the least mobile race of all . 
  you 're funny . 
  holy fuck , dude . 
  are you preparing for the end of the world ? 
  are we not going to make a huge deal when this guy fails at spelling ? 
  magic mountain at six flags  both, 
  make 10 matches each day . 
  get a 6-feet hdmi cable and tape it to the wall . 
  you 're welcome . 
  gojira is fucking awesome, 
  it 's funny how ignorant people know nothing about metal . 
  ignore all the things !, 
  i fucking love that guy . 
  watch the grey . 
  here 's a tip for you ; next time you reply to someone , * read carefully what it 's about . 
  * the guy said metal is childish which means he knows nothing about metal music . 
  it 's not about taste . 
  it 's about someone ignorantly stating their opinion on a subject they know nothing about . 
  if you 're a music teacher , you sure are an ignorant one . 
  i really feel sorry for your students . 
  the question is , do you really * want to ? 
  w. . . what ? 
  how the hell i do n't even ... 
   fuck everything about worms * in * cocks !!, 
  ftfy, 
  what 's happeni, 
  really ? 
  he explains what this is about and all of a sudden he 's got ocd ? 
  you 're the one who needs help , bro . 
  is that the dude who made ` shame ' ? 
  because kubrick . 
  i know . 
  if anything , it works even better against zerg since they do n't have the means to instant detection like terran does . 
  if you can kill their overseers , you 're good .

  the girl with the dragon tattoo, 
  hey man . 
  i listen to metal/rock as well so after researching for about a month or so , i decided to go with ath-a700 's . 
  they 're usually 300 $ of worth but on amazon you can get them for about 120 $ right now . 
  it 's a great steal . 
  they 're closed cans compared to ad700 's which gives it really refined and balanced bass . 
  these things are huge but the sound is just ... amazing . 
  especially for metal . 
  i also bought a fiio e6 amplifier . 
  goes great with these things . 
  i 'd say take a look , they 're amazing quality really . 
  um i did before ... 
  i have n't been using it for years now though . 
  just to give an idea of my musical taste though , here are a couple of my fav bands :d, 
  tool , bring me the horizon , mastodon , lamb of god , trivium , machine head , avenged sevenfold ( waking the fallen era ) , in flames etc. 
  how about you ?
