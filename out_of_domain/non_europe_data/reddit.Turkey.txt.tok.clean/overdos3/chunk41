  tommy boy, 
  thanks for the kind words :d, 
  so like ... greeks ? 
  that ought to show the turks !, 
  good, 
  man , does it really change you that much ? 
  i really need to quit fapping, 
  could 've been blue balls ... 
  since when is 240p is hd ? 
  as much as i 'd like to disagree with you , what you said is % 100 true ... 
  if you translate it literally , then yes that 's what he said . 
  but just like in english ( or any other language for that matter ) , i.e. 
  when you call someone a ` son of a bitch ' , you 're not literally implying that their mother is a whore . 
  you 're just saying that person is a dick . 
  who the fuck cares about the eu ? 
  we got enough problems as it is . 
  your point being ... ? 
  i do n't get it , what 's wrong with saying that ? 
  people say ` fuck obama ' ` fuck this ' ` fuck that ' all the time . 
  it 's basically the same thing . 
  also [ this . 
  ] ( http://youtu.be/xvpvzx-aesm?t=3m39s ), 
  too old ? 
  natalie portman was 13 in leon . 
  ah middle school when korn , limp bizkit and linkin park was all i knew . 
  cringeworthy indeed, 
  that ... that was n't a pun . 
  is n't that the breakdown of the song ? 
  navidson , is that you ? 
  i like this whole conversation . 
  the ocean - mesopelagic : into the uncanny, 
  how can you not get that ? 
  it was n't even subtle . 
  oh god they 're coming to life !, 
  they just announced a us tour with in flames . 
  so stoked . 
  is anal a fetish ? 
  i hate that intersection with a passion . 
  i thought it was ` comcast riding fcc 's dicks ' kinda thing, 
  people downvoting you have no idea how talkshows work . 
  hilarious too apparently . 
  you do n't need to have a phd to know that pretty much everything in talkshows are scripted . 
  some googling will tell you the same thing . 
  courtney ? 
  rekt, 
  attention : if you want to see the truly fucked up stuff , sort comments by controversial and enjoy . 
  i think you do opt ( optional practical training ) first and then you get the h-1 . 
  i 'm probably wrong though . 
  did you not get enough sleep last night ? 
  you 're telling me ... 
  have you actually read the article ? 
  he 's only playing with them on 2 dates . 
  how would that slow the progress of the new album ? 
  holy crap you 're a strong person . 
  wow much interesting such coincidence, 
  it looks like 405-s before el segundo, 
  hole in the wall is pretty overrated . 
  i prefer hamburger habit . 
  or blind . 
  you could be blind . 
  reminds me of that scene in killing them softly where the two robbers do heroin together, 
  the fuck did i do ? 
  if you 're in a thread about a tv show , you should expect to see spoilers about it everywhere . 
  it * is * his receding hair line . 
  guys chris pratt is not perfect !, 
  he 's bald !!, 
  that laughing track is really obnoxious . 
  essentially , joker represents chaos and batman represents order . 
  they 're polar opposites and each has something the other does not . 
  yeah it 's musician 's music . 
  the lyrics are correct . 
  those lines are overlapped as in '' * am * ** am ** * i * ** i ** * he * ** me ** , what is he '' which to me is beautiful because that weird phrasing is able to get across the character 's mental struggle perfectly . 
  seriously . 
  it 's like a bunch of high schoolers turning every goddamn map in this subreddit into a pissing contest . 
  just enjoy the fucking thing . 
  watch them downvote me now . 
  have you seen the movie shame ? 
  watch more family guy . 
  [ citation needed ], 
  right , i did n't think so . 
  yeeeeeeeah , i 'm still not seeing any source . 
  pretty true actually ... 
  socal . 
  it 's an emmy advertisement , sponsored by audi . 
  i am in no way an expert on mixing but i feel like the easiest thing to do would be to get rid of every vst/automation/etc . 
  and start over . 
  from dt :, 
  enigma machine, 
  overture 1928 ( my personal favorite ), 
  dance of eternity, 
  other than that , i know trivium is not a prog band but they have an instrumental song called `` the crusade '' in which the dt influence is pretty obvious . 
  it 's a very good song , probably one of the best trivium has ever done . 
  also , anything by cloudkicker . 
  tone down the racism a little there , champ . 
  we get your point . 
  itunes match is a thing . 
  i love you . 
  most people would say colors , and while colors is the quintessential btbam record , the song ` astral body ' is more accessible to new listeners imho . 
  i would check that out and * then * get into parallax ii --  colors --  the great misdirect ( my personal favorite ) --  then either the ep or alaska or whatever really . 
  yeah same .
