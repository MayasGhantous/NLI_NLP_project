  i 'm less cynical , more confident and just more accepting in general when i do n't fap . 
  actually there is probably minutes between each one , they might have trimmed it for easier viewing . 
  or not . 
  this is fascinating . 
  great post , op . 
  which game is that ? 
  did he die ? 
  i though he got arrested . 
  rekt, 
  / r/perfectloops, 
  that ... does n't make any sense . 
  yes . 
  very . 
  officially on day 4 nao . 
  so far have n't had the urge ... yet . 
  trying my best to stay away from any image/video remotely naked . 
  oh my god who .

  it was a joke from family guy . 
  i found him !, 
  thank you for the explanation . 
  it 's fascinating . 
  i knew there was something else going on . 
  this needs to be higher . 
  go to any whole foods in la. 
  or just a nice fucking neighborhood ? 
  you 're the only one saying that in this thread . 
  it 's also their whole san francisco hipster post-rock thing , with the pink album cover etc.

  itt : people that do n't know the meaning of `` accessible '' and suggesting bands like protest the hero , periphery and btbam . 
  tool . 
  post-crack the skye mastodon . 
  tesseract . 
  i know i came off as snobbish but i think these bands above are more accessible - as far as progmetal goes - than periphery , pth or btbam . 
  why is reporting on sexual activity illegal ? 
  opeth - watershed, 
  opeth - ghost reveries, 
  mastodon - crack the skye, 
  the ocean - pelagial, 
  the dillinger escape plan - miss machine, 
  ne obliviscaris - portal of i, 
  lamb of god - ashes of the wake, 
  dream theater - scenes from a memory, 
  tesseract - altered state, 
  reminds me of the artwork of dillinger escape plan 's `` miss machine '' album, 
   the ocean - pelagial, 
  god i love that album so much . 
  ca n't stop listening to it . 
  it 's not overly technical , it 's not super complex . 
  just beautiful music . 
  source ? 
  * hear hear . 
  benedict cumberbatch 's grandfather right there . 
  themselves . 
  flawless . 
  holy shit .
