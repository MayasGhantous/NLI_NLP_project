  my last relationship was relatively happy but i still fapped every now and then . 
  i do n't think i did it because i had a boring sex life or anything . 
  if anything , i did it because i needed some alone time . 
  sex was great but sometimes you just need a good slapping on the dolphin ... 
  compresses ? 
   it sound so much better on vinyl . 
  this is very subjective . 
  in terms of audio quality , the cd is higher so i do n't really get how it can sound so much better on vinyl . 
  i 'm not bashing on vinyls either , it simply is n't technically true . 
  ah , a true opportunistic . 
  i mean , his attitude is anything but humble but you can tell dude got to where he is by being very selfless . 
  after that much success , i think he 's embraced his ego a little which is totally normal . 
  it 's just great that he 's still very enthusiastic about his work , though .

  i follow btbam very closely and this is the first time i 'm seeing them mention `` rock opera '' . 
  pretty sure it 's their way of saying they 're writing another epic . 
  well he does n't exactly say they 're doing a rock opera but yeah , it 's definitely going to be epic .

  what i get from this thread is i should just go out naked all the time . 
  those guys are better off not knowing someone who judges them based on their sunglasses anyway . 
  as a turk ,, 
  if we 're talking supergroups , i would argue killer be killed 's line-up is more talented but their music is disappointing to say the least . 
  turkey here . 
  ca n't speak for * how * it was displayed since i was 11 at the time , but what i do remember is coming home from school and finding my mom watching the news . 
  this really tall building in a place i had no idea where was on fire and the newsanchor was talking about how a plane had crashed into it . 
  i asked my mom if it had happened in istanbul and right when she was about to answer , she gasped , i looked at the screen and saw another plane fly into the building next to it . 
  to witness it live was shocking to say the least . 
  i will not forget that moment my whole life .

  you on the other hand , do n't . 
  what, 
  aside from silent flight parliament , there are also few melodies from astral body re-used in lay your ghosts to rest . 
  i still have no idea how that works . 
  that does n't sound right but i do n't know enough about physics to dispute it . 
  that was a true eli5 explanation . 
  thank you for dumbing it down for me . 
  ** disclaimer : ** i hope you 're not on mobile for this . 
  ** 1 ) ** the melody at 4:44 in astral body is repeated in lay your ghosts to rest around 0:16 as the synth melody . 
  ** 2 ) ** this one i 've considered making a post about it here in this subreddit a while ago since i have n't seen it mentioned anywhere but i figured no one would be interested in it .
