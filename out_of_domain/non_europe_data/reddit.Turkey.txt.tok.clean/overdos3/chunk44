  i guess i was wrong . 
  so , ( and this will be very difficult to format but let me see if i can pull it off ) around 2:04 in astral body , paul does a run that goes like this ;, 
  ** -------- 6 -------------------------------------------- 4 -- 7 -- 12 -- 0 -- 10 -- 0 -- 0 ( continues ), 
  so in lay your ghosts to rest , he plays this around 1:01 ;, 
  the little run * after * the `` r '' in the middle is the same one in astral body , just 2 steps higher . 
  i 'm sure there are a million other little things like this in parallax ii that we 've all missed ( except the obvious ones like silent flight parliament etc. ) . 
  makes listening to btbam very fun . 
  you . 
  i love you . 
  i think the reason i do n't fall out of a rollercoaster is because there are over-the-shoulder restraints ... 
  erekt, 
  that brunette is fucking hot, 
  insubordinate !, 
  and churlish !, 
  or lamb of god . 
  or gojira . 
  or porcupine tree . 
  my favorite tuning/string gauge combo also . 
  duly noted . 
  this is my art . 
  ** the holocaust **, 
  holy shit, 
   until now , letting it all flow on the canvas, 
  mm , indeed . 
  i did let it all flow on the canvas , if you catch my drift . 
  the new contortionist album ( `` the language '' ) should keep you busy at least until the dvd is released . 
  edit : oh , you said little-known bands . 
  in that case , ( not really * little-known * but i 'll take my chances ) i 'll recommend one of my recent discoveries , ** ne obliviscaris - portal of i ** . 
  it 's got a little black metal , plenty of violin , and flamenco sections etc. 
  pretty cool music . 
  really melodic and emotional stuff . 
  listen to ` forget me not ' first then ` and plague flowers the kaleidoscope ' . 
  these two songs are what blew me away . 
  also , come visit us at / r/progmetal , really good stuff there . 
  dude , gp5 is the shit . 
  i 'm totally with you . 
  right , my bad . 
  mm , yes . 
  that 's the reference . 
  distant relatives of martians . 
  24 years old , still not a millionaire . 
  ... yet . 
  they 're not even touching their faces when they do that . 
  it 's bullshit . 
  this seemed a little too forced . 
  this subreddit is awesome . 
  tigers . 
  they 're majestic as fuck . 
  i , uh ... 
  so he cheated and then pulled a gun on you ? 
  itt : no pick-up lines that would actually work . 
  story time ? 
  record an album . 
  shoot a short film . 
  write an autobiography ( summarized ... ) . 
  paint a painting . 
  have a threesome . 
  call all loved ones and tell them i love them . 
  have a night out with my best friend . 
  and then spend the last day with my family . 
  and * still * not finish it, 
  that 's a long shower ... 
  opeth - to bid you farewell, 
  spoken like a true poet . 
  nothing . 
  we all like to think we 'll eventually destroy ourselves because we 're too stupid but i really think humanity will survive because no matter how desperate things get , no matter how small the population ends up being , we 'll eventually find a way to survive . 
  pelagial is an incredible album . 
  i ca n't stop listening to it . 
  everything about that album is just ... perfect . 
  i like to think by that time we 'll have evolved into beings that can adapt to most environments , maybe even find a way to survive outer space without oxygen . 
  or maybe just become pure energy , wandering through the universe , looking for primitive forms of life to transfer our knowledge to ... so that they can evolve themselves . 
  it 's all a cycle , really . 
  on how to spell properly . 
  he 's in the right thread with the wrong people . 
  so you 're just gon na throw random numbers around ? 
  dude stop copy pasting this shit . 
  your numbers do n't even make sense . 
  did ... did you create an account just to copy paste this ? 
   we now need to expunge turkey from nato , start bombing their oil refineries ( if they have any ) and do what we can to give the people of turkey a chance to regain their secular democracy status . 
  because that 's totally gon na help the people . 
  besides the obvious archive building explosion ( which the only similarity is the explosion , the agenda behind it is totally different ) , i ca n't really seem to find any . 
  you mean you have n't heard of bill burr ? 
  he 's not wrong , he 's just an asshole . 
  * that 's a serious package , folks ... that 's a serious package . 
  lol, 
  i recenty made the connection between kirisute gomen and shogun and my mind was blown . 
  god i love pelagial so much . 
  it gets heavier and darker with each song and at the end , all you have is the incomprehensible remnants of the water above ... amazing . 
  yeah the latter :d, 
  tarantino is a scientologist ? 
  source ? 
  i thought you were crazy at first but i watched it again and that rock on the very left totally moves at the end ... wtf ? 
  i have n't seen it but i do n't think it 's worth seeing considering how larry king cuts him off every 5 seconds . 
  supporting bands do n't have to be * that * big . 
  that 's why they 're supporting bands . 
   ( opinion ), 
  oh man , good thing you said that . 
  i would 've taken that as fact otherwise . 
  turns out your mom 's ass has quite a lot of fans, 
  what .
