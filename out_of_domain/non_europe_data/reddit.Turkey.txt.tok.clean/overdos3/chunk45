  flying . 
   implying blonde hair and blue eyes is american, 
  top kek, 
  * heck yeah *, 
  he 's not wrong ... 
  ### ** window **, 
  why what 's going on h, 
  what kind of genre ? 
  would you be interested in metal ? 
  i think the reason the center of a hurricane is called ` the eye ' is precisely because the of the letter . 
  faith in others is one of the best songs i 've ever heard . 
  dat socal population doe, 
  it 's a live console ... 
  wait ... off the coast of where ? 
  holy crap , -343 karma on one comment . 
  thank you for making one of the most original music out there . 
  so stoked for the dvd !, 
  1 ) paul ; what made you go back to ibanez ? 
  also , will you be recording with ibanez or prs ? 
  2 ) are we ever going to see disease , injury , madness live ? 
  3 ) do you see yourself making music * this * heavy in , say , 10 years ? 
  you clearly have n't seen any good dark knight rises impressions . 
  these guys are good and they * could * do better if they wanted to but they do n't do it in this video . 
  flawless . 
  ## ** shut the fuck up **, 
  rekt, 
  let me guess ... armenian ? 
  or greek ? 
  fuck i should have listened to you and stopped reading that story . 
  i 'm alone in my apartment and it 's 1 am . 
  this title does n't make any sense . 
  mosque, 
  matt ? 
  i 'm gon na go with `` no '', 
  top kek, 
  mint, 
  i love your choices ( visions especially ) however i think i would 've gone with dt - octavarium and tool - reflection . 
  the last 4 minutes of white walls is the most emotional piece of music i 've ever heard . 
  dysphoria is a classic , i love that song . 
  it was incredible hearing it live with intronaut . 
  i would say exiled is tesseract 's masterpiece . 
  nocturne is more like a radio hit . 
  maybe tesseract ? 
  except when it was ruled by the ottomans . 
  it was relatively peaceful . 
   bloom is just cool as hell too , the song is so goofy and strange for them . 
  i would say bloom is right up btbam 's alley . 
  why is there the ottoman empire * and * turkey ? 
  hey i was at that show too !, 
  his integrity is taken, 
  eh i 'll allow it, 
  that 's a very good point . 
  along with / r/datbooty, 
  ** edit : ** i 'm so happy that this comment led to the creation of a legit subreddit . 
  i 've finally done something with my life, 
  yup , and the movie op is thinking of is probably * aguirre , the wrath of god *, 
  lol, 
  yes . 
  exactly . 
  why do people have a hard time understanding this concept ? 
  if he tries they 'll love him , if he does n't they 'll eat him alive, 
  if you had a problem there , boom , you ai n't got a problem here no more , and you ai n't got a problem over here neither cause they 're scared !, 
  i want to believe, 
  what is the filter ? 
  which lol server is the best ? 
  they 're pure evil . 
  source : reddit comments . 
  maybe they just do n't know and are genuinely curious ? 
  not sure if sarcastic, 
  sonder is a nice word . 
  letting kanye west , justin bieber and chris brown form a gay love triangle and a hiphop band , making the worst music ever imaginable together and just ultimately becoming the biggest cunts in the universe , causing russia to finally say `` fuck this '' and bomb la , the us responds , next thing you know it 's ww3 which will lead to the utter destruction of the human race as we know it . 
  edit : it 's a joke , guys . 
  i do n't hate any of the artists mentioned above . 
  what good will throwing only her ass in prison do ? 
  we need to throw her in prison as a whole . 
  how 's the 8th grade going ? 
  in a constant state of asking people how the 8th grade is going, 
  no one knows my friend ... no one knows . 
  this comment does n't make any sense . 
  yes . 
  the last safe was disappointing . 
  they were busy running . 
  this may come as a shock to you and please sit down before you read this ... 
  ** people have different tastes in music . 
  crazy , right ? 
  nope . 
  i 'm the op , idiot . 
  maybe read better next time . 
  i can tell you put a lot of thought into that one . 
  good job . 
   also would n't when the cops looked at the tapes from desi 's house see that amy was there later than she said and entered willingly ? 
  can you explain this to me ? 
  what do you mean ? 
  her creepy stares scared the shit out of me, 
  that 's right . 
  i ca n't remember exactly but did she say that when desi kidnapped her he initially took her there or someplace else ? 
  haha same 2 hours ago, 
  where do you live ? 
  there is n't a day goes by here in la where i do n't see a tesla on the road ...
