  seriously , dude saves the world from destroying itself . 
  it does n't get more heroic than that . 
  you mean tony stark, 
  admittedly i am very ignorant when it comes to this subject but my guess is the f22 ? 
  i 'm probably talking out of my ass but i just love that fucking jet . 
  that guy thinks the world works like civilization v, 
  are you 15 ? 
   i know the turks always need to blame others for their own problems , which they are responsible for . 
  soo ... exactly like the americans ? 
  i found the armenian , guys !, 
  i say whatever the fuck i want . 
  i just looked it up ( the f35 ) . 
  i 'm a straight man but i think i would let that jet fuck me . 
  it 's sexy . 
  eh , you tried . 
  i 'll allow it . 
   and you will look like ** an ** idiot while doing it . 
  ftfy, 
  you know , it just dawned on me and i feel like an idiot for realizing this just now but the child she says she 's pregnant with is * not * ben affleck 's ( i forgot the name of the character ) . 
  it 's actually desi 's and poor ben will stay with her thinking it 's * his * child . 
  holy shit . 
  someone correct me if i 'm wrong , he did ejaculate before she slashed his throat , right ?

  yeah but she could easily be lying , right ? 
  thank you for the explanation , it all makes sense now . 
  since you seem knowledgeable about the story , let me ask you another question ;, 
  is that kid nick 's child , or desi 's ? 
  because he * did * ejaculate before she slashed his throat , right ? 
  i know nick said , `` i want tests '' and everything but i could n't be sure . 
  also the fact that she said she had nick 's sperm from before but she could be bluffing and it could be desi 's child . 
  what does it say in the book about this ? 
  or is it intentionally left ambiguous ? 
  i guess it 's a lot more clearer in the book . 
  i think the timeline in the movie is what threw me off . 
  thank you !, 
  - what 's the matter , peter ? 
  something wrong ? 
  - well , now that you ask about it , i find this meatloaf rather shallow and pedantic ... 
  - what , you 're gon na talk down to everyone because you won at a board game ? 
  - perhaps ... 
  ** edit ** : i had no idea they looked were bullet points on desktop . 
  they looked like hyphens on mobile ... 
  rekt, 
  because lack of education . 
  never go full cerebral palsy . 
   1812 overture, 
  ** 1928 overture **, 
  ftfy, 
  who cares about the grammys ? 
  just because they 're relevant in the industry does n't mean their music is still relevant . 
  i 'm not saying black sabbath sucks , i love them but their music is old . 
  add nails and anaal nakhrath to that and i 'm in . 
   dream theater, 
   accessible, 
  lol, 
  metal fans are elitist , and they usually hold metal music in the highest regard . 
  they can come off as douchey . 
  ... including myself . 
  i fucking love metal and i think it 's the greatest genre in music . 
  yes . 
  yes we are . 
  to a non-metal listener , dream theater would be the last band i would recommend . 
  i can imagine him saying , ` this is just incomprehensible wankery ' which sometimes even to me ( a metalhead ) that 's what it sounds like , i ca n't even imagine what a non-metal listener would think . 
  metallica , post-crack the skye-era mastodon or something like tool is relatively simpler and more accessible imho . 
  dude , how is black sabbath still relevant ? 
  ozzy osbourne himself is barely relevant . 
  you think people who go to their shows nowadays are young people ? 
  it 's mostly 35 + people and they go out of pure nostalgia , same with kiss , motley crue etc. 
  lol are you over 30 ? 
  you 're just old . 
  also , try to read more carefully next time . 
  i was n't comparing their music . 
  maybe your old age has also affected your comprehensive abilities . 
  lol holy shit this has to be the most ignorant thing i 've read on this website, 
  but he 's in gotham ... 
  some closure with django 's story was necessary imho . 
  that 's supposed to be two words . 
  haha yeah i 'm totally with ya there . 
  oh do n't mind me , i 'm just here to watch . 
  i enjoy conflicts . 
  i 've suffered from depression and as far as i recall , `` losing your sense of humor '' is n't one of the symptoms . 
  yeah , maybe it wo n't crack you up but you 'll still know it 's meant to be a joke . 
  because * thundercunt * is usually said about women . 
  i was n't sure . 
  that 's why i asked someone to correct me if i was wrong . 
  rekt, 
  [ how 's this one ? 
  ] ( http://www.bumperdrive.com/media/bike/picture/yov20c4l65cbj1h3fkb6kd73k566car0.jpg ), 
  i want to believe, 
  they have massive dicks, 
  op , do you even math ? 
  * the horror ... *, 
  seriously , reddit ... how did this racist shit get upvotes this many times ? 
  i 'm baffled . 
  edit : found out why . 
  ^ this guy 's armenian, 
  vaginas aside , that is one muscular woman .
