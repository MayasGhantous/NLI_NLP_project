  look at them abs . 
  * whooosh *, 
  he was arrested for smoking 3 marijuanas . 
  he 's evil and should obviously be executed . 
  edit : forgot how to english, 
  literally hitler 's new army . 
  i come from a middle class family but i went to private schools up until college which allowed me to get acquainted with a lot of people from upper class families , not to mention some of my closest friends were also very rich compared to my family . 
  i feel like the difference is that most of those people never had to work/wait for something they wanted . 
  they would just ask for it to their dads and boom , it would magically appear a week later ( i 'm talking like macbooks , electronic drum sets , cars etc. ), 
  and now , they 're all grown up people who have n't really grasped the idea of having to work to get something . 
  they 're just lazy people . 
  dude , this website is like % 80 american . 
  what do you expect ? 
  i 'm not american myself but i 'll be damned if i 'm not feeling like yelling * ` murica * whenever i 'm browsing reddit . 
  ** not so breaking news : ** i 'm fapping right now . 
  relevant username, 
  wow . 
  beautiful . 
  for some stupid reason your comment cracked me up, 
  i enjoy this song whenever it comes up in shuffle but it always feels underwhelming for an epic . 
  granted , i 'm always comparing it to epics like `` octavarium '' , `` anesthesize '' , `` blackwater park '' , `` the czar '' or `` swim to the moon '' but still , i feel like the the whole song ( especially the chorus ) could 've been way more powerful . 
  i feel like they were a little too hasty to write an epic which is cool of course but it 's also why this song sounds like it was rushed . 
  `` communists '' ? 
  you 're an asshole . 
  there are so many things wrong with this question i do n't even know where to begin ... 
  i see people commenting how this is hilarious and could be a sketch on a show but i can really see it happening . 
  it 's so realistic it 's not even funny . 
  there 's nothing in that joke a person should n't get . 
  darude - sandstorm, 
  hahaha now this one 's good . 
  i 'm fapping right now . 
  shallow and pedantic . 
  so how exactly does `` apologizing '' erase what 's happened ? 
   tribal middle eastern culture, 
  you have no idea about turkey , do you, 
  of course it is , but throwing turkey out of nato because they have n't apologized is ridiculous . 
  acting like apologizing erases everything is equally ridiculous . 
  `` uh ... you know ... we killed all those people but we apologize ... '', 
  `` oh yeah you 're totally good then ... like it 's never happened '', 
  really ? 
  because the people who carried out the armenian genocide are still in power , right ? 
  give me a fucking break . 
  do you even know what is being discussed ? 
  scroll up and read again . 
   everyone thinks the chinese eat babies , dogs and cats as well as bugs . 
  as a turk , ^ this is bullshit . 
  only the ignorant thinks that . 
  do n't generalize . 
  dude , you took part in an exchange in which the whole argument was about whether to include turkey in nato or not because they have n't apologized for the armenian genocide . 
  it does n't matter if you replied to me or not . 
  well then you should n't be surprised when people reply to you regarding the original discussion . 
  it was terrible . 
  fabulous as a peacock among roosters ? 
  i like how you 're absolutely right % 100 and still getting downvoted . 
  this guy gets the reference , guys . 
   i do n't listen ** 2 **, 
  how lazy are you, 
  if you do n't like eli5 , you always have / r/answers, 
  those orgasm sounds in the breakdown has led to many awkward moments with friends ... 
  if you want an even more ridiculous similarity , check out ` the great debate ' . 
  that song ( especially after the 4:00 mark ) straight up turns into 46 and 2 . 
  what, 
  why not ? 
  we 're not all cynical cunts here . 
  it looks loke berkeley . 
  that does n't make any sense but i 'll let it slide . 
  to a non-bilingual , yes . 
  i have been trying to figure out what i 'm looking at for 5 minutes now and i still have n't the slightest idea . 
  can anybody explain it to me ? 
  thank you . 
  i 'm looking for atmospheric , textural death metal like fallujah . 
  also , i 've always wanted to get into crowbar . 
  where do i begin ? 
  most guitar players i know ( including myself ) think that guthrie govan is a very tasteful and classy guitar player but that does n't necessarily mean he 's better . 
  if we 're talking technique , i would argue that petrucci has as much skill as guthrie , vai or vaughn . 
  it 's a matter of personal taste . 
  a friend of mine found a dying kitty in a thrash bin in santa monica last week . 
  the kitty 's alright now but could they be related ? 
  so this is one person making up words ? 
  i thought sonder was an actual word ( well , now it is i suppose now that it 's become so popular ) . 
  lateralus imho is tool 's best riff . 
  okay , thanks for downvoting for asking a question . 
  i sure hope so . 
  would you like a side of spelling as well ? 
  dude yes , blinded in chains and strength of the world are some of the best songs a7x has done, 
  i would 've never guessed you have bring me the horizon on your playlist ... 
  although sempiternal is a decent album, 
  why yes , i will m shadows, 
  as a turk who is white , i too would like an explanation please . 
  yeah but surely not their skin color because i 'm still as white as it gets , so is my father ( who is in fact blonde + blue eyed ), 
  yes . 
  i know but he also has blue eyes ... 
  i actually asked him years ago if he might have european ancestors but he did n't know . 
  23andme showed that the paternal side of my family is south/east european but i do n't know what to think . 
  so what , in your opinion , are turks classified as , if non-white ? 
  if i do both , will they cancel each other out ? 
  [ read before you speak .

  this might be the most ignorant comment in this thread . 
  turks were in the region long before ottomans .
