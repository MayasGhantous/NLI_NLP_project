  fuck you . 
  [ lol what are you , high ? 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kurdistan_workers'_party ), 
  holy shit , you 're more delusional than i thought . 
  you actually tried to rationalize pkk 's actions . 
  you truly have no idea about what the fuck is happening in that region . 
  it is a widely known fact , you idiot . 
  do n't embarrass yourself any further . 
  the government is . 
  the people do n't give a shit . 
  surely you must know not to judge a nation by its government by now . 
  [ boom . 
  take your pick . 
  ] ( https://www.google.com/#q=nato+nuclear+weapons+sharing+turkey ), 
  me too , and they have apparently , since they do n't really seem to be giving 2 shits about the community acquis these days . 
  besides , turkey 's economy is doing pretty good without the eu . 
  erdogan 's cabinet not really giving a shit about the eu might be the only positive thing about them . 
  holy shit , fail . 
  could n't even spell * anything * right . 
  you really should 've listened when i told you to not embarrass yourself any further . 
  haha . 
  nice ninja edit . 
  no he just estimated . 
  i do n't know what your problem is , but i 'm sure it 's difficult to pronounce . 
  dae le armenian genocide every time turkey is mentioned, 
  turkey has the second largest army in the nato after us . 
  sshhh ... do n't disturb the anti-turkey circlejerk with your facts . 
  i can tell you have a severe problem and i do n't what it is but i 'm sure it 's very difficult to pronounce . 
  what 's next , mom jokes ? 
  your mom defines irony . 
  maybe he is one ? 
  yeah . 
  for great examples of vocals `` buried in the mix '' , i recommend mike patton 's work , anything except faith no more - since that one by its nature has vocals panned dead center , and more in your face . 
  [ here 's a great interview where he talks about vocals being buried in the mix . 
  ] ( http://youtu.be/ypmd5gd_0ss?t=41s ), 
   if you have to ask , the answer is no, 
  ftfy, 
  tennessee , i think . 
  i 'm more of a tomahawk guy myself, 
  lol, 
  i know for a fact that these websites are utter shit but i clicked on the link anyway and out of curiosity , checked out madison ivy 's worth . 
  you know , one of the most popular pornstars ever , of whose first ever anal scene was regarded as one of the `` blockbusters '' in porn ( i know this because i , uh ... 
  i did some research . 
  you know ... fapped ) . 
  her worth is $ 1.5 million . 
  tommy 's is $ 12 million . 
  that alone should tell you the amount of bullshit these websites generate . 
  uh ... about that last part ... 
  as an atheist living in a muslim country ( granted , we got no terrorists here but still ) , i wholeheartedly agree, 
  do n't know why you 're getting downvoted . 
  i get why they do n't name the killer and they have their reasons but i want to know the identity of the killer , and not naming him does n't really leave any room for discussion as to what his motivations were , what can be done in the future etc. 
  is no one going to point out that she got over a thousand likes ? 
  how is that even possible ? 
  is she a celebrity or something ? 
  according to wikipedia , it was shot in india . 
  instead of unfriending hundreds , i just removed them from my news feed . 
  now i only have bands on my news feed * and * the option to contact people should i feel the need to . 
  wedding bands . 
  good enough for me . 
  so are we , for that matter . 
  that 's very true . 
  edit : all these downvotes for saying ` that 's very true ' ? 
  wow, 
   i recently read that rentals are hot in las vegas right now , you could be getting $ 1500 for a 3 bed house ? 
  as someone paying $ 1500 for a 1 bedroom apartment ... * sigh * . 
  p. . . purple, 
  we takin it to the apahtment, 
  what i do is i 'll always say `` thank you '' and accept it , but drink however much i want , then leave the glass half full if i have to . 
  no one really cares . 
  one of the best examples of this is the narrator in fight club . 
   fuck this * slave *, 
  why are you talking to yourself ? 
  cause they make omelettes ? 
  everytime i get high , it 's either ted or wikipedia . 
  yes , that 's the joke . 
  thank you for this . 
  kek, 
  lel really, 
  drunk lobster !, 
  le upvote to you le kind sir, 
  u blonde, 
  are you being ironic ? 
  yup , i am having this too . 
  this , framerate drops , and cmd + q is n't as responsive as it should be etc. 
  i 'm thinking yosemite needs an update . 
  seriously . 
  what does it matter where you are ? 
  if a post is nsfw , tag that shit . 
  this is so sad . 
  static-x was one of the first industrial bands i ever got into . 
  shadow zone is a very good album . 
  also , it might be the app itself requiring an update for yosemite but [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/culsa9b.png ) happens . 
  oddly enough , it 's only caffeine that does that . 
  does anybody know what his friend might 've meant by the part in bold in particular ? 
  it makes me think it might 've been an overdose or something ?
