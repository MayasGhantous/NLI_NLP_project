  just sayin ' ... 
  how about the * young turk * ? 
   ... any voice in erdogan 's turkey that calls for change or openess or dialogue is quickly quenched by the extremists , the xenophobes , and the `` nazis '' ( i.e. 
  ultra-nationalists ) . 
  yes . 
  yes they are . 
  but that does n't mean the people are actively pursuing for a radical change that will take turkey back to the ottoman days . 
  does the government have an agenda ? 
  sure . 
  does erdogan think he 's the second coming of suleiman ? 
  you bet your ass . 
  but whenever the word ` ottoman ' is mentioned , there is always controversy . 
  so the whole country is not in agreement , and that counts for something . 
   for various reasons the victors in wwi decided to show some sort of compromise/mercy to turkey, 
  as far as i recall , the turkish war of independence was * won * . 
  not * lost * , mind you . 
  the difference is that no one showed mercy whatsoever , the turks just fought back and took back their land . 
  and yes , the turks might have taken that land from the greeks in the first place but they sure as hell did a better job in managing a large empire . 
   with regards to conquering and `` that 's how the world works '' not every nation on the planet has maintained it 's land by force or by usurping the peoples that were there . 
  how ironic , ^ that coming from an american . 
  i 'm just a young turk . 
  i would be lying if i said i did n't agree with you on this . 
  as n turk who also holds u.s. citizenship , i find that this is the main difference between the us and turkey ; ( hell , between the us and * the rest of the world * ), 
  that in the us , there 's at least * progress * . 
  yes , similar crimes were committed in the past but at least there is an active effort to accept that what was done was horrible + a half-assed overhaul of the educational curriculum ( which is * something * ) . 
  you 'll see europeans insulting americans all the time but the truth is , they 're not even halfway there when it comes to progressive thinking regarding different races , religion and languages . 
  that being said , my earlier remark meant this ; even though the us is decades ahead in terms of progress , let 's not be too hasty to judge other nations . 
  everybody 's getting there , just at different paces . 
  perhaps both . 
  nasa pls, 
   soon, 
  i hope you realize that 's not happening anytime soon ... 
  i 've been to both ... you 're wrong .

  you disagree ? 
  not liking putin is one thing but calling a kgb agent-turned-fucking * president * stupid is beyond stupid . 
  i do n't know where you got the idea that killing people has anything to do with intelligence . 
  intelligence does n't necessarily provide one with morals . 
   also being a politician contradicts intelligence automatically . 
  this is an incredibly naive point of view . 
  no u, 
  welp poop, 
   despite what reddit thinks, 
  because reddit is only one person , right ? 
  yes . 
  i like you . 
  go away,

  rekt, 
  darude - sandstorm, 
  how do you know the roach was german ? 
  while most would say the quintessential btbam album is colors ( which i agree ) , i would argue that parallax ii is a better introduction to btbam . 
  then you could do colors  the great misdirect  ep  alaska etc.

  or just wipe the chair ? 
  fanatics of * any * religion should all be catapulted into the sun . 
  do n't look at the edges . 
  look at the image itself . 
  it 's stable . 
  i love you,

  kek, 
  nonsense . 
  they 're all made by printing out each frame of the gif then making them into a flipbook then flipping said book really fast while having someone take a million pictures of this ordeal and eventually putting all those pictures together and uploading them to youtube . 
  that was incredible . 
  i 'm amazed you even played the solos . 
  10/10 would listen to the whole album this way - also please do disease , injury , madness next . 
  i wish more people thought like you .
