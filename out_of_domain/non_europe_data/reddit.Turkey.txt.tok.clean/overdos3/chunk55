  totally not op terrans amirite, 
  go on ... 
  might have been true anyhow ... 
  my buttcheeks have never been clenched so hard . 
  absolutely insane game . 
  flawless, 
  maybe halilovic ? 
  i doubt he 'll get anywhere close to where messi is but he 'll be worth watching i imagine . 
  i too play barcelona in football manager, 
  i too would like an answer to this question . 
  what is the ` moth & flame ' video and what happened after it ? 
  i like you !, 
  that does n't sound right but i 'm not alcoholic enough to dispute it . 
  composure - 20, 
  calm your tits . 
  woah dude ... 
  op do n't do reposts you cheap fuck, 
  jesus fucking christ what the fuck is that thing, 
  [ ** breathing intensifies ** ], 
  i 'm laughing so hard right now, 
  do not go gentle into that subreddit . 
  fucking hell look at those teeth, 
  right . 
  every fucking problem greeks have has `` ottomans '' written beneath them . 
  this has to be one of the most ignorant things i 've read on this website . 
  nope . 
  lol typical cimbom fan, 
  i do n't care , you 're a fucking moron, 
  i do n't think judging the quality of songs based on their difficulty is logical at all . 
  i completely agree . 
  i 'm just saying judging a song based on how difficult it is to learn does n't make sense . 
  i mean , enter sandman is an easy song to learn but does that make it a bad song ? 
  likewise , in the presence of enemies is relatively difficult to learn but does that necessarily make it a good song ? 
  the criterie on which songs are judged should be anything but their complexity . 
  complexity is nice and it 's the main reason i got into btbam , but complexity is just one reason why btbam is awesome . 
  there are a lot of other factors , such as the quality of lyrics , musicianship ( that is knowing when to shred and when not to shred ) , atmosphere etc. 
  it does n't have to be productive . 
  i 'm just stating my own opinion , which is that complexity is n't the only reason why i enjoy a song . 
  no need to apologize man , all good . 
  i actually agree with you there . 
  colors was definitely where they * found * their sound . 
  that twenties energy is really present in that album . 
  now they 're all in their thirties and i guess it 's the maturity we 're hearing in these songs . 
  but like you said , got ta hear the whole album first . 
  we can agree to disagree then . 
  alright , i laughed . 
  you 've succeeded . 
  kiwikaki vs. stephano, 
  that legendary archon toilet . 
  unforgettable moment . 
  a lot of people , including me ( and every japanese person i know ), 
  shut up , greg . 
  rekt, 
  threesome ? 
  my god ... 
  interesting, 
  how about ` fuck you ' ? 
  rekt, 
  because it went great for you the last time you did n't heed advices , right ? 
  i am well informed . 
  you do n't seem to be , however . 
  no magazine can legally review a whole album based off of only two tracks . 
  they either review the full album or not . 
  oh man , do i miss your dailies, 
  lol, 
  is this a quote from a movie ? 
  i feel like it is . 
  why is it a poorly designed unit ? 
  genuinely curious . 
  keep playing and earn them back . 
  * whooosh *, 
  the amount of people who do n't get this joke is too damn high, 
  rad ? 
  it 's a mess, 
  wow such subtlety,

  i worked hard, 
  sorry , i do n't have much respect for someone who lets prejudice dictate how they live their lives . 
  you . 
  i like you . 
  believe it or not , how you judge others influences said cultures , traditions and daily lifestyle .

  not with that attitude .
