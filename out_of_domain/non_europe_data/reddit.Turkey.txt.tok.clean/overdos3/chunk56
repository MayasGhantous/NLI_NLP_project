   `` blew up '', 
  are you new here ? 
  cake practice ? 
  `` shazam '' ? 
  which idiot drew this, 
  ** for anyone wondering what the contingency plan for batman is **, 
   batman is successfully distracted from league business when the league of assassins steals the bodies and coffins of his late parents thomas and martha wayne . 
  ** and the rest ; **, 
   martian manhunter is covered with nanites that convert the outer layer of his skin into magnesium , causing him to burst into flame ( fire being his greatest weakness ) upon exposure to air . 
   plastic man is frozen and shattered . 
   aquaman is rendered aquaphobic due to an altered form of the scarecrow 's fear toxin . 
  without water , he would die in a matter of hours . 
   green lantern is rendered blind by his own power ring from a post-hypnotic suggestion introduced during the rem phase and the ring placed on him while he was asleep . 
  kyle is unable to function without his vision to guide the ring 's power , but he is able to overcome the post-hypnotic suggestion after his ring is temporarily removed and the methods behind the attack are explained to him . 
   thanks to a nanite injected into her ear , wonder woman is trapped in a virtual reality battle against an opponent whom she can not defeat and is her equal in every way . 
  her refusal to surrender under any circumstance would eventually cause her to tire herself out and die of exhaustion . 
   a specially designed `` vibra-bullet '' strikes flash in the back of the neck , causing him to experience seizures at light speed . 
   superman 's skin becomes transparent after exposure to red kryptonite , an artificial creation of batman 's made by exposing a green kryptonite sample to radiation developed in the event of him simply wanting to stop superman for a while rather than actually killing him .

  rekt, 
  top kek, 
  nah , he 's a dick for ruining the joke . 
  we 've known this for years now . 
  just unable to do anything about it . 
  oh give me a fucking break . 
  nobody gives a shit about the eu anymore , get off your high horse and see it for what it is . 
  stop pretending like eu 's the golden ticket to a corruption-free government . 
  what * can * we do ? 
  he 's not military-backed . 
  not by any means . 
  you would be surprised . 
  or so we think ... 
  8/10 was disappoint he did n't poop, 
  sounds like a family guy cutaway . 
  this post : absolutely not funny or interesting content , just two hot chicks, 
  itt : people complaining and downvoting comments that point out the fact that these girls are indeed hot, 
  wrath by lamb of god as a whole is available on youtube track by track . 
  btbam uses passive pickups and passive pickups are your best choice for getting that metal sound * and * great cleans . 
  do not get active pickups ( emg 81/85 etc ) unless you want that chuggy sound only . 
  there 's a reason they 've used passives for a decade now . 
  my recommendation would be any decent dimarzio 's ( x2n is great for bridge , really heavy tones ) and liquifire for that cutting leads . 
  plot twist : that 's the project mayhem hq and op 's dad has no idea his son is actually tyler durden, 
  in mad max , the protagonist is ( you might wan na be sitting down for this ) ... mad max . 
  ridley scott loves himself some good viral marketing . 
  [ the viral video for prometheus was really well done too . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grorp3xbrre ), 
  yes i have . 
  it uses furiosa 's arc to further max 's story . 
  max is still the protagonist . 
  you said it yourself , the male is the lead . 
  they did but were too lazy about it . 
   the god of protoss, 
  i lol 'd . 
  my wife for hire, 
  carrier has arrived . 
  80-100 apm in diamond is ** not ** below average . 
  my point was n't that there is n't a correlation between apm and skill . 
  guy said, 
   diamond with about 80-100 apm , which is still well below average, 
  80-100 apm in diamond is average maybe . 
  but definitely not * well below average * . 
  no , he 's saying you do n't have the right to not be offended . 
  you ca n't have that privilege because ... well , because freedom . 
  i do n't give a shit if you get offended , too bad . 
  kind of . 
  i 'm not drunk enough for this . 
  you son of a bitch, 
  [ it 's from indecline vol 1 . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3m1x7gifog ), 
  what ? 
  are you not a native english speaker ? 
  rekt, 
  you are horribly misinformed . 
  only in the us, 
  i do n't think his doing it on purpose . 
  i want to believe, 
  d3 is really good right now, 
  thank you for spelling out the joke . 
   erdogan and this mob boss are black t\u00fcrks . 
  you know , i 've been on this website for more than 3 years now and believe me , i * have * seen my fair share of ignorant and misinformed statements . 
  but this one , my friend ... this one easily takes the cake . 
  so what the fuck are you talking about ? 
   a few, 
  did you even read his comment ? 
  i see you got a nice , well-thought out argument going on there . 
  okay ... 
  i 'm a turk as well , and i 'll bite . 
  first of all, 
   black turk minority are an overwhelming majority representing 73 % of the population, 
  source ? 
  secondly , the whole `` white turk-black turk '' thing is a fairly recent invention . 
  there is a lot of ambiguity here . 
  who decides which ethnicities belong to which ? 
  if a person 's mother is kurdish , father is lighter skinned , are they `` grey turk '' ? 
  it 's precisely these silly cultural identity impositions by the gezi movement that creates this vast rift between minorities . 
  gezi movement was good for this country , but it was n't perfect by any means . 
  a lot of its supporters seem to be on the more nationalist side , which - in the event of a coalition government - might take us to square nothing . 
  edit : oh yeah , to add to that black turk thing . 
  `` erdogan is a black turk '' what ?
