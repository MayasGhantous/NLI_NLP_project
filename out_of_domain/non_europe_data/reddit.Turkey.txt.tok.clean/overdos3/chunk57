  he 's about as white as it gets in turkey . 
  you said so yourself ; black turks are more arabic-looking . 
  erdogan looks nothing like it . 
  btw , i 'm not defending the guy , i 'm just saying his ethnicity is pretty obvious ( besides , is n't he like of georgian descent or something ? 
  so there you go ) . 
   erdogan explicitly pandered to the more arabic t\u00fcrks and claimed to be a kara t\u00fcrkler . 
  again , you 're making all these claims without sources . 
  no source on the previous one either . 
  not really a convincing argument without sources , is it ? 
  also , i did n't say recent * development * , i said recent * invention * referring to the ( `` white turk-black turk '' ) labels themselves . 
  it 's always been turks vs whatever in turkey , yes , but the whole `` yeah white turks '' vs `` go black turks '' is relatively recent . 
  i 'm not saying those labels do n't exist , they 're just stupid and unnecessary and only serve to divide the country even more . 
  that 's the sort of smiley that makes you go `` i would n't trust my daughter with him '', 
  as he rock-a rock-a rock-a rock the microphone ? 
  no wasd pls go, 
  # ** you are a unique snowflake , your parents could n't be prouder of you and everyone in the world wishes they were as awesome as you are **, 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ now ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ give ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ me ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ gold, 
  tag me as `` need to gift gold '', 
  i will tag you as `` owes me gold because i was nice to him and thus need to be compensated for my efforts '' ( due to character limit , will only tag you as `` owes me gold '' ), 
  so whenever i see you on reddit , i will remind you of this fact . 
  ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ) this guy seems familiar and trustworthy . 
  maybe he 'd like to babysit my daughter sometime, 
  at this point , i 'm not even sure you 're reading my comments properly . 
  so glad it 's over, 
  i 've missed you so much, 
  came out to watch you play, 
  why are you running away ? 
  ## ** prying open my third eye !!!, 
  i know what you 're getting at but as a turk , trust me , the guy * really * is an egotistical maniac on a power trip . 
  he really is , that 's the mindblowing thing . 
  no one gives a shit about the americans when it comes to soccer . 
  suck his dick, 
  also las vegas and new orleans . 
  the great misdirect is easily the best album btbam has done in my opinion . 
  it 's crazier than colors , more balanced than parallax and has the maturity of the ep . 
  it 's easily my fav btbam album . 
  shots fired, 
  this cracked me up, 
  how exactly is killing time on your phone while waiting for people insecure ? 
  do people expect me to * not * kill time and instead make eye contact with strangers while i 'm waiting for people ? 
  you wan na see strong similarity ? 
  listen to great debate by dt ( especially after the 3:50 ish mark ) and compare it to forty six & 2 . 
  it 's unbelievable . 
  agreed . 
  it might be the most typical btbam song ( whatever that means ) in ce . 
  i would go with either king redeem or turn on the darkness . 
  dustie as well, 
  the great misdirect  colors  parallax ii  ep  alaska, 
  i 'm still in the process of digesting coma ecliptic thoroughly . 
  i do n't want to be too hasty . 
  it 's a sick album so far though . 
  fav songs : disease injury madness  white walls  silent flight parliament, 
  what are those moments ? 
  wow . 
  i understand but it 's amazing that i disagree with pretty much everything you said . 
  i love the chaotic ( yet ordered ) vibe of tgm ... that 's why it 's my fav btbam album . 
  it 's the grooviest btbam album . 
  * especially * obfuscation and disease injury madness . 
  the whole album is really well-written and it just ... flows . 
  i can understand desert of song , i find myself skipping it sometimes ... to get to swim to the moon , no less . 
  but ... 
   obfuscation is the worst , devoid of cleans , the lyrics make no sense to me, 
  the lyrics are n't supposed to make sense , i think that 's the point , hence `` obfuscation '' ( and hence `` the great misdirect '' ) . 
  obfuscation easily ranks among my fav btbam songs of all time because it 's groovier than most of their songs . 
  it just makes you bob your head involuntarily . 
  also another reason why i love tgm is the guitar tones in that album are the best imo . 
  i 'm not a big fan of their tone in parallax . 
  but yeah man , i understand . 
  it 's a very polarizing album but it 's my favorite btbam album . 
  what second meaning ? 
  the song is literally about brann 's sister 's suicide . 
  the czar and hearts alive are mastodon 's masterpieces . 
  ... source ? 
  i love you too . 
  nice username . 
  do n't know why you 're being downvoted , i could n't agree more . 
  yyeeaaaahhh ... no . 
  it was n't greece who rejected it . 
  it is . 
  just not sovereign . 
   but please do n't start a war again as soon as you got better . 
  what ? 
  if you 're talking about the melting city chorus , that 's intentional . 
  if not , i have no idea what the fuck i 'm talking about . 
  exactly . 
  a nation does n't have to be sovereign . 
  are you even reading ? 
  i 'm saying that does n't matter . 
  a nation is still a nation , even under control of someone else 's . 
  the identity remains . 
  nice argument . 
  rekt, 
  no but that does n't make it any less wrong . 
  how do you trace them when they 're using vpn-through-vpns ? 
  well then , i 'm grateful you 're not managing the team . 
  what were you expecting in a website where the majority is americans ? 
  nowhere close , but yeah , check him out anyway . 
  also colors and coma ecliptic . 
  octavarium is all about recurring themes actually . 
  it 's meta that way ( the whole ` we come full circle ' theme ),
