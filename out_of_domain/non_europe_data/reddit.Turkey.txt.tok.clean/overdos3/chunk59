  i ca n't believe they 're nerfing protoss ... of all races . 
  pretty sure [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wxhhcbs.jpg ) is the real one . 
   as someone whos absolutely disgusted by forcefields warpgate and colossus deathballs, 
  found the zerg , guys, 
   after all , it 's built especially in pvp , where both sides use gateway units all game . 
  protoss use gateway units all game in * all matchups * . 
  that 's ok, 
   and ? 
  ... and it 's a fucking joke . 
  that 's interesting . 
  i 've always found the guitar tones in tgm the best . 
  let 's get impressed together ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  tell that to our government . 
  it 's not like we do n't want it . 
  you shut your whore mouth, 
  that does n't mean they do n't need the feedback ... in fact , that 's the whole point of the beta . 
  they want that feedback . 
   stalker is kind of tanky, 
  lol . 
   self-defense, 
  hehe, 
  are you 14 years old ? 
  tuna , mayo , corn , green onions in a baguette, 
  i do n't . 
  anecdotes do n't mean shit . 
  `` oscar wilde is a jackass . '', 
  / u/overdos3, 
  annie are you ok ? 
  how 's the 8th grade going ? 
  still having trouble with not taking life too seriously ? 
  known some call is air am, 
  holy ... shit, 
  this is worse than it 's getting credit for . 
  woah , dude . 
  i was thinking `` we '' refers to his multiple lives . 
  left to right :, 
  denis leary, 
  mick jagger, 
  keith richards, 
  devin townsend, 
  scary skeleton man, 
  only the title is turkish, 
  lol, 
  are you smoking that funny stuff again, 
  not on safari : /, 
  [ it does have a bookmark bar . 
  ] ( http://media.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/ipad-bookmark-bar.png ), 
  [ good enough for you ? 
  yyyyyeeeeeeaaaaahhhhhhh, 
  the day i saw this on top of the front page was a great day . 
  calm your tits . 
  he was joking, 
  still , though ... he was n't grasping at straws . 
  what is this from ? 
  jake gyllenhal was born for true detective , imho . 
  pretty sure he replied to the wrong comment . 
  thanks, 
  i know the usual consensus is that white walls ( or ants of the sky ) is the climax of the album and that may be , but sun of nothing is the best song in colors imho . 
  you have the lowest tolerance i have ever seen on reddit, 
  stop being so obnoxious . 
  just because you got high once does n't mean you 've found the meaning of existence, 
  dude , everything about this post is obnoxious and pretentious . 
   experienced ego death, 
  ugh ... really ? 
  welp , there goes our last chance . 
  we 're fucked for good now . 
  you are hot and i would like to perform cunninglus on you ^ ^ ^ ^ i 'm ^ ^ ^ ^ sorry, 
  depends . 
  no country is stronger than the other ( although some countries perks ' are considerably better than others ) . 
  awwwwww < 3, 
  things like this big in scale do n't change that fast . 
  it does n't work like that . 
  how 's the 8th grade going ? 
  how 's life being an ignorant moron ? 
  sounds like bullshit to me . 
  i doubt it . 
  musicians usually dislike having to explain the meaning of their lyrics . 
  it 's better to leave the interpretation up to the listener . 
  so do you think beyonce was a little ... jay-ded ? 
  ^ ^ i 'm ^ ^ not ^ ^ very ^ ^ good ^ ^ at ^ ^ this, 
  dude , that 's totally a lamborghini, 
  you are wrong, 
  nope, 
  # ** 24 hour hip hop dot com **, 
  my iphone goes right to the timestamp ... 
  try updating ios or/and alien blue . 
  it 's a pretty good alternative to reddit actually . 
  well said . 
  for me , it goes ;, 
  leviathan  crack the skye  blood mountain  remission  once more round the sun  the hunter, 
  also , this song is probably one of the best songs mastodon has done . 
  everything about it is amazing . 
  tool is hardly math rock . 
  actually it 's between leviathan and crack the skye for me but lately i 've been going for leviathan for that more raw style . 
  hearts alive is a masterpiece but so is the czar and the last baron . 
  shame they do n't make songs like those anymore . 
  it 's not just the notes though . 
  it 's copied section by section . 
  this is easier to notice if you pay attention to the drums and the vocals . 
  granted , dt cited tool as an influence on that particular album but still .
