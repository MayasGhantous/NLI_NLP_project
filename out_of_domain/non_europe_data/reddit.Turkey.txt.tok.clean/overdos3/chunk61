  i doubt you 'll find turkish coffee in coffee shops - except philz ( but their turkish coffee is very philz-ized ) . 
  it 's a novelty kind of coffee so you 'll either find it at greek restaurants ( that greek place on the promenade has it ) or at hookah bars . 
  oh yeah totally man . 
  i see what you mean . 
  i have no idea though ... 
  i 'm saying hookah bars and greek/turkish/mediterranean / middle eastern restaurants because those are the kind of places where i had turkish coffee . 
  sorry i ca n't get any more specific than that . 
  not for a keeper . 
  for de gea, 
  no shit ... 
  are you really this obtuse ? 
  you 're joking , right ? 
  there 's my answer i guess ... 
  hell , would be even worse i imagine . 
  focusing on staying awake only completely still sounds terrible,

   moral of the story , do n't eat cum on an empty stomach, 
  wiser words were never spoken .

  i do n't know if you 're joking but this is actually a very accurate way of finding out what you find attractive . 
  biologically , we are attracted to people similar to our parents . 
  wow . 
  you sound like an ignorant dick . 
  hundreds of dollars ? 
  spotify premium/apple music is like $ 10 a month . 
  after stealing for so many years , least you can do is to churn out a hundred bucks a year . 
  yes it is legal . 
   a two-man penalty , or `` tap '' penalty , occurs when the penalty-taker , instead of shooting to score a goal , taps the ball slightly forward so that a team-mate can run on to it . 
  the team-mate , like all other players , must be at least ten yards from the penalty mark when the ball is initially kicked . 
  this strategy depends on the element of surprise , so that the team-mate can reach the ball ahead of any defenders . 
  the first recorded two-man penalty was taken by rik coppens and andr\u00e9 piters in the world cup qualifying match belgium v iceland on 5 june 1957 . 
  arsenal players thierry henry and robert pir\u00e8s famously failed in an attempt at a similar penalty in 2005 , during a premier league match against manchester city at highbury . 
  pir\u00e8s ran in to take the kick , attempted to pass to the onrushing henry , but miskicked ; as he had touched the ball ( but barely moved it ) , he could not touch it again , and city defender sylvain distin reached the ball before henry could .

   i think you mean arrogant , because ignorant makes no sense in that context . 
  welp . 
  it makes perfect sense now . 
  i hope you grow up one day because your reasoning is absolutely delusional . 
  i 'm not pissed off . 
  i 'm just saying you 're wrong in everything you 've said so far . 
  you . 
  i like you .
