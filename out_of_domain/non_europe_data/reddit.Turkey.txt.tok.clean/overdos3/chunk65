  give me a break . 
  radar shows it was shot down in turkish airspace . 
  it 's not like we give a shit about the eu . 
  get off that horse , brosef . 
  al-qaeda ? 
  what the fuck are you on about ? 
   turkey published radar images claiming to show the plane briefly flying over its southern territory . 
  [ at least i have a source . 
  ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2015/nov/24/russian-jet-downed-by-turkish-planes-near-syrian-border-live-updates ) where 's yours ? 
  oh right . 
  it 's the anti-turkey circlejerk , is n't it ? 
  have you read the article at all ? 
  let me school you . 
  it says `` us air defense identification zone '' not `` us airspace '' and according to [ this article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/air_defense_identification_zone_\\ ( north_america \\ ) ) , it says, 
   these regulations do not pertain to military aircraft , but to enter us airspace , without inducing the scrambling of fighter interceptors , these rules must be complied with and followed . 
  the us does not claim sovereignty over these zones per se , but does closely monitor and request information of all objects entering the zone . 
  the difference with today 's incident is that turkey * does * claim sovereignty over its airspace . 
  there . 
  hope you read your sources better in the future . 
  is the anti-turkey circlejerk is over now ? 
  that 's not an answer , as i 'm sure you realized . 
  you 're wrong . 
  read comments . 
  get out of this thread with your rationality . 
  we 're too busy with an anti-turkey circlejerk here . 
  exactly . 
  so why are people so eager to believe russia over turkey ? 
  both are lying pieces of shit countries . 
  it 's mad how quick people seem to forget how disrespectful russian military is to other countries ' airspaces . 
   sorry , but your country is a piece of shit . 
  no need to say sorry , i completely agree with you there . 
  it 's when people act like turkish people as a whole support isis . 
  you do n't think we 're tired of calling our own government terrorists ? 
  it 's not like we have a choice when the people running the country are corrupted as hell . 
  nice argument . 
  i see where you 're coming from , but believe me when i say you have no idea about the circumstances we have here . 
  what makes you think i 'm looking for sympathy ? 
  i 'd * love * to believe that , but i 've often found it 's usually the other way . 
  that 's maybe why i get so defensive , because i have in the past have gotten into many arguments where people seemed to think every decision made by our government was a reflection of the whole nation . 
  hate to burst your 2edgy bubble , but it does n't work like that . 
  it was shot down in syrian airspace but it flew over turkish airspace , which it was warned not to do countless times over the past few weeks . 
  they have already provided turkey with nuclear weapons . 
  46 of them . 
  i actually laughed , imagining it the accent and all . 
  got an upvote from me , / u/putinishero, 
  shit just got real, 
  lol, 
  luck ? 
  he clearly kicked the ball to the right corner . 
  it was deliberate . 
  lol, 
  this has nothing to do with radical muslims . 
  actually it is but you would n't understand since you have no idea what you 're talking about . 
  one word for you ; nato . 
  sigh, 
  you have no idea about diplomacy and the word `` treaty '' i see . 
  why do n't you go play more civilization ? 
  that 's very cute . 
  seriously . 
  the barca of 2015 is one of the best teams ever . 
  we 're all witnessing history . 
  let me take a guess . 
  armenian ? 
  i 've been here for 4 years and believe me when i say i 've seen some stupid shit but this is without a doubt the most bigoted , ignorant and stupid claim i have ever seen not only on the internet , but in my life . 
  pretty easy actually . 
  this is incredibly misinformed and ignorant . 
  turkey has been warning russia not to enter its airspace for weeks now . 
  russia likes bullying but since putin is a hero right now in / r/worldnews , everyone chooses to ignore how russia does n't respect any country . 
  russia agitates ukraine . 
  nothing happens . 
  nothing happens . 
  they threaten lithuania . 
  nothing happens . 
  but when someone does n't buy into their games and actually hits back , it 's `` turkey bad !, 
  turkey terrorist !, 
  turkey want to start war ! '' . 
  give me a break . 
  our military is the only one that actually is n't afraid of these guys . 
  edit : [ to everyone downvoting me , this one is for you ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fno3igokok ), 
   daily, 
  nope . 
  greeks do the same to us too , you know . 
  [ read this . 
  ] ( http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkey-could-have-downed-114-planes-for-airspace-violations-army--.aspx?pageid=238&amp;nid=23963&amp;newscatid=338 ), 
  it was shot down * because * it is the most politically sensitive place on the planet . 
  you do n't pull your usual antics down there . 
   cause belli, 
  do n't wan na be a dick but it 's actually `` casus belli '' which is ironic in itself because even though the phrase is latin , it also literally translates to `` the spy is known '' in turkish, 
  then you have the mind of a child . 
  december 3rd ... what am i missing here ? 
  nice, 
   half-with, 
  it 's spelled half-wit . 
  but hey , it 's always nice to be acknowledged . 
  meh , not gon na argue with you there . 
  i actually agree with what you said wholeheartedly but that ca n't be right since i 'm a troll of the highest order . 
  or am i ? 
  find out later tonight on our new / r/worldnews episode . 
  are you a troll ? 
  i think you 're a troll .
