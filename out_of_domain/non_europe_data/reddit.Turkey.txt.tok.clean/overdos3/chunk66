  then you and i have been browsing a very different / r/worldnews, 
  no , we do n't actually . 
  ** and ** it 's not a rash act at all .

  '' * lets see . 
  * turkey changed its rules in engagement regarding its syrian border after its own plane was shot down in syria in 2012 . 
  * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/june_2012_interception_of_turkish_aircraft, 
  * russia frequently violates nato airspace . 
  this time violating turkish airspace while also conducting bombing runs across the border . 
  * http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/06/nato-chief-jens-stoltenberg-russia-turkish-airspace-violations-syria, 
  * turkey publicly warns russia not to enter its airspace or else its plane will be shot down . 
  calls on russian ambassador . 
  putin says it was a mistake and wo n't happen again . 
  * http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-10-06/nato-head-says-russia's-turkey-air-violations-not-an-accident/6832370, 
  * as airplane approaches turkish border , turkish airforce warns to that it is soon to enter its airspace . 
  * plane enters turkey and is shot down . 
  seems like the russians were given a fair amount of warning . 
  [ here . 
  now gtfo . 
  [ here 's the recording ] ( http://www.aa.com.tr/tr/vg/video-galeri/dusurulen-ucaga-10-defa-yonunu-acilen-degistir-uyarisi ), 
  cheers brother, 
  as a turk , i truly wish this idiot to not speak for once . 
  everything that comes out of his mouth is total garbage . 
  the second largest military in nato at that . 
  edit : here ;, 
  [ the turkish armed forces collectively rank as the second largest standing military force in nato , after the u.s. armed forces , with an estimated strength in 2015 of 639,551 military , civilian and paramilitary personnel . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turkish_armed_forces ), 
  yes , nato is in fact under the obligation of article 5 . 
  do your research better . 
  i actually thought it was funny . 
  i for one am interested . 
  what do you care ? 
  that is never going to happen . 
  words can not describe the shame i have as a turk to have this idiot governing my country . 
  nope . 
  sorry to burst your bubble but the world does n't work like call of duty . 
  there are things called diplomacy and treaties . 
  that 's very true , but there 's a * long * way to go with diplomacy before anything actually happens . 
  it 's not impossible , it 's just highly improbable . 
  a good rule of thumb about the internet is that you should never make assumptions about strangers without any basis . 
  that i ca n't disagree with . 
  i for one ca n't wait for the day erdogan either dies or is forced to flee . 
  that 's alright , buddy . 
  as a turk , i 'm not siding with anybody . 
  i 'm just trying to be realistic because i find it funny when people knee-jerk react to everything like `` omg ww3 !!, 
  maybe if things escalated way more , but this will at most be a huge diplomatic crisis ( it kinda already is ) . 
  that is a terrible analogy . 
  it is when you 've been warning them not to violate your airspace for countless times . 
  do your research before you speak , please . 
  yup . 
  at least we can hope for someone * less * evil . 
  it 's not like everyone voted for him . 
  he got % 49 of the vote . 
  that 's still a lot but not enough to conclude that it reflects the whole nation 's opinion on him . 
  noooooooooooooooo not my nerd jesus, 
  i do n't know about the military but as far as controlling the media , i would say that is not a stretch . 
  now that 's a ridiculous thing to say . 
  that is a very misinformed opinion , sorry to say . 
  * looks at url without reading the article *, 
  right ... 
  why yes i would . 
  do i get a suit and a pipboy if i sign up ? 
  heeeeeere we go ... 
  is it at least open source so i can install ubuntu or something ? 
  you sir , are a terrible salesman . 
   you know most of the turkey hates ataturk , right ? 
  this is a blatant lie . 
  please do n't believe this guy . 
  this not true * at all * . 
  do n't bother . 
  i 've checked his comment history . 
  he has no actual opinion , just a young kid who absorbs the nationalistic bullshit spewed on media and thinks they are true without a doubt . 
  a typical brainwashing case . 
  completely misinformed and ignorant .

  so you 're positive he did n't have a family or friends ? 
  `` no one would miss him '' is a pretty dickish thing to say . 
  so anybody who does a mistake in their lives deserve to die and their lives , families and friends do n't matter because of that one mistake they did ? 
  by those standards , how are you yourself even alive ? 
  m\u00fcller seems to be in on that mission as well, 
  there is a first time for everything , after all . 
  that 's not what i meant but whatever . 
  yeah , that analogy does n't work at all . 
  i ca n't really confirm officially because that would be lying but i know those were reported by major media outlets ( which were then raided ) . 
  a lot of chp votes were found burnt and torn to pieces in trash cans around cities after the election . 
  i was actually at a major party 's building , counting votes election night and for some reason , many akp-supporting media outlets announced that the voting was over and that akp was ahead by an absurd amount of votes , which was n't true at all because we were still counting votes by that point and we still had votes coming in , hours after it was reported to be over . 
  so i do n't really know what happened there but i know that the whole nation was shocked that akp managed to get % 49 of the votes - which is very weird considering in the election before that ( in june ) it sure looked like they were going to lose a lot of votes . 
  sooo ... sketchy things happened for sure , i can confirm that much . 
  whoa , easy there tough guy, 
  oh god ... i need a kitten, 
   facts changing is a real thing there . 
  so it is in turkey . 
  lol . 
  what the fuck would you know about turkish food 's origins ? 
   if turkey declared war then russia would turn turkey into a crater, 
  my god , you high-schooler armchair politicians never cease to amaze me with your simple understanding of politics .
