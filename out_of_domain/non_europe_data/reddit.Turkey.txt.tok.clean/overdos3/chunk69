  that 's kinda cute . 
  then again , i 'm a guy with absolutely zero idea about how to go about these things . 
  not right now he is n't . 
  then again , i 'm biased so what the hell do i know . 
  this is the stupidest shit i 've read in this thread . 
  wild throne, 
  destrage, 
  that might be but only if you compare him to the rest of the squad . 
  judged on his own merits , you can hardly say he 's doing great . 
  even volkan \u015een is doing way better than sneijder atm . 
  wtf is wrong with you people ? 
  [ he is . 
  ] ( http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2621827-manchester-united-leicester-champions-league-discussed-by-charlie-stillitano ), 
   charlie stillitano , an american sports executive and chairman of relevent sports -- which hosts the pre-season international champions cup tournament -- has suggested manchester united deserve a uefa champions league place more than leicester city due to their superior stature . 
  what an idiot . 
  pretty sure brits use `` yankee '' for americans in general . 
  lol can u imagine ? 
  eh , while we 're at it ;, 
  remenissions, 
  desecrate through reverance, 
  eternal rest, 
  * second heartbeat *, 
  radiant eclipse, 
  blinded in chains, 
  strength of the world, 
  all have prog elements . 
  waking the fallen as a whole is a masterpiece imho . 
  i mean ... you can be married and play video games and drink beer at the same time , you know . 
  you just have to work at it a little , which is what marriage is all about . 
  what men call * not ready to commit * , i call it not mature enough to not run away from responsibilities . 
  i think in this day and age , it looks * cool * not to be married but marriage has a lot of perks . 
  it 's beyond being just husband and wife , it 's a lifetime partnership , which is very cool if you can find the right partner . 
  source ? 
  wrong . 
  holy shit look at my man pereira, 
  i think it 's fair to say that this is a shit showerthought . 
  no tattoo and no 5 o'clock shadow, 
  man , that is a great picture . 
  means so much now that you know they 're separated . 
  most sequels did n't / do n't need to happen . 
  that does n't stop the studios making them for easy cash grab though . 
  lol, 
  usain bolt ? 
  after a certain soccer player who plays for his rival team perhaps ... 
  dae le armenia everytime turkey is mentioned even if the issue at hand has nothing to do with it ? 
  you are very new here , it seems . 
  give it time . 
  he was n't really the villain in ex machine imho . 
  it 's very ambiguous . 
  that 's rich coming from an american ... 
  holy shit that 's beautiful . 
  sounds like you do n't know what the fuck you 're talking about . 
  boaty mcboatface is funny . 
  the other one is witty but this one is silly funny . 
  he does n't have absolute power just yet . 
  he has a ridiculous amount of power but not absolute . 
  not yet .

   bombs constantly going off in shitholes like iran, 
  iran is a beautiful place and i 'm sure you 're confusing it with syria or iraq . 
  there is no terrorism in iran . 
  are you euphoric in this moment ? 
  dae le atheism and richard dawkins is our great leader ? 
  as much as certain sects of religions might lead to terrorism , * religion is terrorism * is a pretty bigoted way of looking at things . 
  strikers usually hit their prime between 29 and 33 . 
  look at ibrahimovic . 
  i do n't think so . 
  even though he 's arrogant as fuck , he 's right . 
  beautiful . 
   1 turks life is not worth 6 europeans, 
  it 's a saying which roughly translates to : `` a turk is worth the world . '', 
  it 's the kind of bullshit nationalistic brainwash that 's taught to turkish children everyday . 
  where the fuck has eric bana been ? 
  speak for yourself . 
  why are you here if you do n't ? 
   he can go to hell, 
  those are pretty strong words . 
  i doubt he deserves that much hate . 
  this might be one of the most obnoxious dialogues i have witnessed on reddit ever . 
  why would he step in his own footsteps ? 
  how is that indisputably morally offensive ? 
  it 's essentially about free-will and goodness/evil . 
  nothing morally offensive about that imho . 
  ya man ... 
  [ shiiiiiiiiiiiiiieeeeeeeeeet ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qw2zodbnseq ), 
  how is having an opinion about the design of their house `` hating '' ? 
  looks like something out of bioshock, 
  saying * \u00c6nema is about rain * is just plain wrong . 
  it 's about the apocalypse in la. 
  maynard uses rain as a tool that will bring about the apocalypse . 
  they mean the same thing .
