  it 's just a different way of saying it . 
  the rest is semantics ... 
  exactly my point but whatever . 
  * just chill * ? 
  ca n't we have a discussion like adults without some kid trying to turn it into a fight all of a sudden ? 
  just because you have no idea what the song is about does n't make me wrong . 
  i 'll chill when you shut the fuck up . 
  that 's very cute . 
  they 're persian , not arabs . 
  how can you not see the difference ? 
  you do realize iranians descend from the persians ? 
  was she a prostitute ? 
  did n't she have like her own harem or something ? 
  you mean doner ? 
  i was at that show as well and iirc , it was n't a swim to the moon medley . 
  i think they just played the 2nd half of the song ( beginning with the irish-ish weird stringy melody ) . 
  this is n't even remotely metalcore . 
  nope . 
  dep is and has always been a hardcore band , which originates from ... well , hardcore punk . 
  what is that bigger event ? 
  flawless . 
  ### ... i got in . 
  frustrated males, 
  i 've been a prog-head for a very long time but i got into post-metal in the last year and a half or so and found it suits my need for good ambiance and atmosphere better . 
  prog is good when i want technicality and weirdness but these days i just want to lay back and let the music take me to places which post metal does perfectly . 
  it 's like soundtracks in metal form . 
  to start with ;, 
  * isis - panopticon ( the quintessential post-metal album ), 
  * isis - wavering radiant, 
  * isis - in the absence of truth, 
  * cult of luna - somewhere along the highway ( masterpiece ), 
  * cult of luna - vertikal, 
  * cult of luna - mariner ( with female vocals this time and it 's * amazing * ), 
  * ( post-black ) deafheaven - sunbather/new bermuda, 
  * ( post-black ) harakiri for the sky - aokigahara, 
  * russian circles - memorial, 
  * callisto - secret youth, 
  * ( not metal but awesome ) godspeed you !, 
  do n't bend !, 
  ascend !, 
  * ( you prob know this one ) explosions in the sky - take care , take care , take care, 
  songs ;, 
  * isis - weight, 
  * isis - 20 minutes/40 years, 
  * isis - altered course, 
  * cult of luna - dark city , dead man, 
  * cult of luna - vicarious redemption, 
  * cult of luna - a greater call, 
  * deafheaven - sunbather, 
  * harakiri for the sky - gallows ( give 'em rope ), 
  * russian circles - ethel, 
  * godspeed you !, 
  black emperor - mladic, 
  * godspeed you !, 
  black emperor - piss crowns are trebled, 
  * explosions in the sky - last known surroundings, 
  i know i 'm missing neurosis , pelican and a bunch of others but these are the ones that popped into my head immediately . 
  what the fuck is up with the comments here ? 
  joseph gordon levitt and tom hardy were known but they were hardly * big * names before inception . 
  is it on spotify ? 
  i ca n't seem to find it . 
  sorry , i knew i was missing a bunch of others . 
  it was n't deliberate though , with bands like rosetta i simply am not that familiar with yet . 
  so wikipedia tells me * the galilean satellites * is 2 cds - with both of them meant to be played at the same time . 
  since i ca n't do that on spotify , would you recommend i just listen to them back to back ? 
  that 's fucking interesting , man . 
  that 's fucking interesting . 
  dude , he rarely rapes people . 
  * rarely * . 
  you can trust him with these things . 
  it * is * a miniseries . 
  it 's only 8 episodes . 
  itt : `` too soon '', 
  cool . 
  no idea . 
  [ he 's absolutely right though . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/miniature_faking ) op picture is miniature faking . 
  tilt shifting is a different thing . 
  see how easy it is , christians ? 
  the last 4 minutes of cygnus is orgasmic . 
  absolute masterpiece . 
  do you know how to read the sidebar ? 
   `` the movie is fine '', 
   proceeds to explain why it is n't, 
  his points are far too crucial for the movie to be `` fine '' . 
  influential ? 
  it 's a blatant ripoff of louis ck on conan ` o'brian `` everything 's amazing , nobody 's happy '', 
  the difference is , deafheaven 's production is actually good . 
  in fact , new bermuda 's mix is pretty fucking great . 
  would bang 11/10, 
  a great example of this is used on walter in breaking bad - ozymandias when hank gets shot . 
  he did n't . 
  it 's a repost . 
  i see ... 
  i see ... a tin mug . 
  never fails to crack me up, 
  what 's with those numbers ? 
  39 and 21 ? 
  i have no strong feelings about this one way or the other . 
  turkish ?
