  also not as secure as html5 . 
  wait so you 're saying flash was * not * as secure ? 
  i 'm confused . 
  that 's exactly what i said . 
  i think the sequels are great tbh, 
  you said `` plain wrong '' . 
  that 's not plain wrong . 
  plain wrong is if i said flash is very secure , which i did n't . 
  that 's what confused me . 
  this is like leprous and meshuggah had a child with triptykon as godfather and tool might or might not have been involved during childbirth . 
  ominous and dark yet emotional . 
  i like the overall vibe a lot . 
  elitist, 
  elitist, 
  elitist, 
  nah , i agree with you . 
  it was absolutely shit . 
  ** agalloch - marrow of the spirit **, 
  black lake nidst\u00e5ng is a masterpiece . 
  i ca n't get enough of it . 
  ** isis - panopticon **, 
  a post-metal classic . 
  will always be listening to this album . 
  ** cult of luna - vertikal **, 
  ** cult of luna - eternal kingdom **, 
  cult of luna is absolutely mesmerizing . 
  i ca n't wrap my head around some of the things they come up with . 
  so innovative and ahead of their time . 
  ** steven wilson - hand . 
  can not . 
  what is there to say about steven wilson that has n't been said ? 
  no idea what it means but the music is beautiful . 
  shoegazing at its finest . 
  to be honest , this is album kind of overhyped . 
  it 's really good but calling it best thrash in decades ? 
  come on now . 
  best thrash this year so far , definitely but not better than , say ... and justice for all , surely ? 
  ** harakiri for the sky - iii : trauma **, 
  kind of a letdown for me . 
  there are a lot of post-blackgaze-whatever bands popping up these days and these guys ' previous album was very good but this one sounds very generic . 
  granted , i 've listened to it only a handful of times so i 'm not giving up yet . 
  thanks for the sarcasm indicator . 
  we would 've thought you were serious otherwise . 
  why are you here as in `` why are you even commenting that you do n't care ? '', 
  you clearly care enough to comment . 
  fuck you bot, 
  yes . 
  yes it does . 
  ## ** dark tower **, 
  thank you for your contribution . 
  i 'm more of a `` marrow '' man myself . 
  huh ... different strokes , i suppose . 
  pale communion is a masterpiece imho . 
  faith in others is the best song opeth has ever done , after maybe harlequin forest . 
  harakiri for the sky - iii : trauma, 
  what a letdown . 
  aokigahara was very promising but i 'd say iii : trauma is a generic post-black metal-core-whatever . 
  advanced ? 
  it 's not even close to whatsapp . 
  neige must be absolutely terrified that you 're coming for him, 
  what ? 
  have you hear the new album at all ? 
  chrysalis is like a missing piece from watershed-era opeth . 
   yeah ... the album is bad . 
  based on how many listens exactly ? 
  or are you just jumping on the bandwagon ? 
  and it was n't good . 
  lol that 's exactly what i thought . 
  keep up the good work my man, 
  have you ever heard the phrase `` it grows on you '' ? 
  i did n't say it happens suddenly . 
  * gradually * is more like it . 
  that 's what `` it grows on you '' means . 
  in any case , he seems like the typical post-watershed opeth hater with no actual basis in his opinions . 
  i 'm going to go out on a limb here and say he has n't listened to the new album * at all * . 
  insult you ? 
  where exactly ? 
  are you smoking that funny stuff again ? 
  for those who do n't get it , here 's the explanation ;, 
  ** the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the two other sides **, 
  led zeppelin - no quarter, 
  what i got from your comment is that people that do those recommendation posters on / mu / do n't know their shit as well as i 'd thought . 
  i consider colors progressive metal but i can see why people consider it metalcore . 
  a lot of characteristics that make up metalcore is there - along with a bunch of different genres obviously . 
  but that mixture of a bunch of different stuff is by definition what makes it progressive . 
  a little on the post side but you should definitely check out russian circles . 
  exact same thing happened to me , except it was a girl . 
  really makes you think how hypocritical people can be . 
  the fuck is wrong with you reddit ? 
  i like you . 
  coma ecliptic is definitely more mature . 
  focus is more on songwriting as opposed to `` let 's see how crazy we can get in 8 minutes '' . 
  not that that 's a bad thing ( in fact my fav album is tgm , which is probably the craziest of btbam albums ) . 
  all pumas are jaguars . 
  my bad . 
  i confused it with panther . 
  thanks for the clarification . 
  why not move to a different house ? 
  that may be , but there still is no crescendo in ectopic stroll as far as i can see . 
  i can honestly see why you think that way , it 's definitely amazing but nothing can surpass the led zeppelin imho .
