  just thought i 'd let you know . 
  kek, 
  relevant username . 
  yes . 
  wait why ? 
  it definitely makes for a more interesting characterization but not * more * monstrous . 
  there is no difference here . 
  if anything , someone with no emotions ruthlessly destroying everything in its path is more terrifying simply because there are no emotions involved . 
  not the whole film . 
  the first half maybe . 
  the problem is n't the usb-c ports . 
  standardisation is fine and a good investment . 
  apple is known for doing this ( floppy disk , cd rom , flash etc. ), 
  the problem with this particular decision is that this is the first time they did it with no transition whatsoever . 
  that 's what people are mad at . 
  wait which riff in god damn and where exactly is it repeated in higher ? 
  it 's an interesting idea sure but this is hardly a review . 
  you barely talked about the instrumentation , lyrics , musicality , technicality , solos , mixing , new drummer , bass being barely audible , arrangements . 
  you just talked about the songs , which is fine ... it 's just not * an album review * . 
  my two cents . 
  ** agalloch - marrow of the spirit **, 
  it 's a 6 year old album but still fresh as ever . 
  definitely one of the darkest and harrowing albums ever produced that i 've heard . 
  * into the painted grey * is a stormy winter in song form , whereas * black lake nidst\u00e5ng * is agalloch 's crowning achievement . 
  everything about that song is so amazing . 
  ** avenged sevenfold - the stage **, 
  this album is everything i wished they would do after * hail to the king * . 
  * exist * in particular is hair-raising . 
  ** deafheaven - new bermuda **, 
  i keep going back to this album . 
  not only is it a step up from sunbather in terms of mixing and production , it 's also the album they 've found a perfect balance between post music and hard-hitting metal . 
  ** sumerlands - sumerlands **, 
  it 's traditional heavy metal with a twist . 
  i had heard about these guys a lot but never got around to listening . 
  even though i have no idea what they 're talking about , it 's great . 
  i 'm loving it so far . 
  icelandic post-progressive band ( basically a heavier sigur r\u00f3s ) . 
  not really . 
  guys , guys ... 
  it 's stinkfist, 
  not my title , it 's ug 's . 
  sorry about it anyway . 
  i 'm okay with the events that are unfolding currently . 
  what did the deleted comment say ? 
  i imagine someone mumbling to himself , all grumpy . 
  way too funny an image for some reason . 
  cat 's like `` i ca n't wait to be an insufferable asshole to you when i grow up . '', 
  but why man ? 
  countless tabs exist already . 
  that 's exactly riiiiiigggghhhhhtttt, 
  the other half went to someone else . 
  so you 're actually sharing it . 
  but it 's no secret , idk why op said `` secretly '', 
  why the fuck turkey would come together with the arabs ? 
  if anything , they would come together with the rest of the turkic nations . 
  you need to catch up on your reading . 
  i mean , even though grinding is the reason most people - including me - love this game , there 's still a part of me that hates it for that very reason . 
  tyranny by obsidian entertainment just came out . 
  great game so far . 
  they 're masters of isometric hack 'n' slash games imho , right behind blizzard in that regard . 
   loving something is a submission to the thing you love . 
  that sentence does n't make any sense . 
  i might be going out on a limb here but * the serpent & the sphere * is actually my fav right behind * marrow of the spirit . 
  ** tool **, 
  ** cult of luna **, 
  well then ... get ready for the end to that run in 2 weeks in kad\u0131k\u00f6y :p, 
  wait so what is the actual reason ? 
  you do realize egyptians really * did * worship cats ? 
  to be fair , he did yell a lot in inception and the revenant but yeah i see your point, 
  what an appropriate response , you absolute moron . 
  everything about this band is so good . 
  i agree with everything you said . 
  spot on . 
  yup same . 
  i have no explanation whatsoever, 
  because chester bennington . 
  this cracked me up, 
  how 's the 8th grade going ? 
  i 'd like to see house of m on the big screen . 
  such a great storyline , also really shows how powerful scarlet witch and dr. 
  strange are . 
  that was terrible, 
  go to their page and follow an artist, 
  then preferences  show announcements about new releases, 
  same with every other pet . 
  tell me why ... 
  you shallow idiot . 
  * that 's * your criteria of a bad year ? 
  it says a lot about how you think when said `` 2016 was a bad year '' and that 's the first thing that comes to your mind tbh . 
  anyway , who cares , 2016 sucked and not because famous people died . 
  it sucked because it sucked . 
  except the shitty wah solos, 
  no it was not . 
  don specifically said he and the rest of the guys knew about it 2 weeks beforehand . 
   * something that confused me ... i was the first one to tell your booking agent that you broke up and i only knew from the facebook post . 
  how far in advance did you know agalloch was done ? 
   i would say 2-3 weeks before the announcement we had broached the topic . 
  the topic was presented to me as john saying , `` if we ca n't do it full time i do n't want to do it at all '' i said `` i do n't understand that '' we were in a position where we made good money when we wanted to tour . 
  when we got off tour the three of us were limited by jobs and families . 
  i have an academic calendar too -- which is actually the ideal for touring .
