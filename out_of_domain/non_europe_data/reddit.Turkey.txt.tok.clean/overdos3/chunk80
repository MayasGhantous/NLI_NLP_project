  or not be a complete moron like you . 
  i agree with what you 're trying to say but the oscar thing does n't really mean anything . 
   greatest military in history, 
  lol, 
  because it 's completely impossible to do this , amirite ? 
  which is only like an hour away, 
  what does you being 23 have anything to do with this ? 
  yeah because its pretty unnecessary . 
  i know it 's not what you 're looking for but in case you need a recommendation for the future when you have more cash to spend ;, 
  grados are absolutely amazing for metal music . 
  they 're great headphones in general but they 're flawless for metal . 
  good amount of mids and quality sounddrivers . 
  you 'll eq it if you want to . 
  if you want pure flat , go get a monitor headphone . 
  if you 're listening music at 96 kbs mp3 , the earphones is n't the problem . 
  you do realize when people say `` good amount of mids '' , in headphone-speak that means you 're able to hear the mids better , right ? 
  it does n't mean `` headphones add mids on top of the existing mix '' . 
  that 's pretty badass . 
  are you ok ? 
  your comment tells me you have no idea about cats, 
  i 'm oddly okay with that . 
  it was wall of text talking about how much he hates cats . 
  it was full of just ... unnecessary hatred, 
  yeah . 
  what 's the point of having vaults if i ca n't have all knowledge in place, 
  there is no theme in city of evil at all . 
  [ dream theater - octavarium ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvmik3xyayo ) - climax + outro solo is as epic as it gets . 
  [ avenged sevenfold - strength of the world ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0fioxbbi68 ) has a pretty epic outro chorus . 
  any btbam song really but [ silent flight parliament ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prrjzm2wdhe ) and [ white walls ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fndrh2un5eg ) in particular are really amazing . 
  [ swim to the moon ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=md6jgibyd2w ) also . 
  [ mastodon - hearts alive ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vs2zsxpmdl4 ) has a badass outro with heavy riffage and a great solo . 
  [ godspeed you !, 
  black emperor - east hastings ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9ty3ynwn80 ) has a very climactic mid-section . 
  [ cult of luna - dark city dead man ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvcdxobkq6o ) - the last 4ish minutes are stunningly beautiful . 
  [ cygnus ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvdhw4fskj4 ) is also beautiful if you like female vocals . 
  [ opeth - deliverance ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0t-tpxs1m0 ) - this outro is considered a classic . 
  it 's not a concept album at all . 
  i have no idea where you got that information from . 
  there is no running theme in city of evil . 
  blinded in chains is a political song . 
  bat country is about fear and loathing in las vegas . 
  seize the day is a pretty obvious song written to m shadows ' wife . 
  strength of the world is a western song about a girl whose family is murdered and she goes out to avenge them . 
  betrayed is about dimebag darrell and his murder . 
  is about m shadows ' friends in the military . 
  `` concept album '' implies some sort of running theme throughout the lyrics and/or music which there is none in city of evil . 
  again , there is no similar theme at all . 
  how is , say , blinded in chains and bat country are similar ? 
  a concept album usually talks about one thing throughout the album ( see : the stage - the only concept album avenged sevenfold has made to date ) or tells a story ( see : metropolis pt 2 by dream theater or parallax ii by btbam or crack the skye by mastodon ) . 
  or it can be a musical concept album ( see : octavarium by dream theater or colors by btbam ) . 
  avenged sevenfold has never stated city of evil is a concept album nor do i see that information anywhere else . 
  wait for the second half , you should be playing * with * the current , not against . 
  the transition in the lotus eater is the middle section of the song though . 
  you might 've included it because it 's epic but is it really ? 
  it 's interesting , sure , but when i think epic , i think climactic . 
  that section is just ... wacky . 
  i mean ... are they not a prog metal band ? 
  so ... it 's not epic ... it 's not the outro ... not at all climactic ... am i missing something here ? 
  sorry , not being a douche , geniunely not seeing why someone would include lotus eater . 
   i interpret the anti-climactic and `` wacky '' transition as climactic, 
  that , uh ... that does n't make any sense . 
  do n't forget three flavours cornetto . 
  i also thought star trek was pretty solid ( only the last one was kinda meh ), 
  what medication are you using ? 
  ambien ? 
  i 'd say he looks the part dead-on . 
  i respectfully disagree . 
  i can list at least 3 films off the top of my head where he displays a range of emotions masterfully - midnight special , nocturnal animals , take shelter . 
  i mean we 're talking about josh brolin here , it 's not like he 's a master of comedy - shannon 's comedic instincts are right on point as evidenced in elvis & nixon . 
  he aged . 
  happens to the best of us . 
  as a foreigner , i have no idea what this dialogue means . 
  civil war is not going to happen . 
  it might have if the outcome was no . 
  that does n't change anything . 
  ysk did n't report no such thing . 
  it 's over . 
  look , i want the outcome to be no more than you do but they 're rigging the whole thing . 
  it 's plain and simple . 
  you seem to have a very juvenile understanding of political matters . 
  we 'll let her know . 
   hard to believe she had a clue what she was even talking about . 
  * acting . 
  what are you , 12 ? 
  i mean ... it 's blatantly fantasy . 
  nothing ambiguous about its genre imho . 
  / r/conspiracytheories, 
  source ? 
  you do realize the election was rigged ? 
  do you read the news at all ? 
  you sound like an obnoxious cunt, 
  exactly . 
  that 's why all the major news outlets reported fake victories . 
  i can tell you have no idea what 's been happening in turkey recently . 
  how the fuck can you tell if i have no idea if you yourself have n't paid attention ? 
  you stopped making sense . 
  why am i not surprised . 
  hate to break it to you but it is . 
  you have no evidence whatsoever . 
  you must have a condition which i 'm sure is very hard to pronounce .
