  confirmed, 
  as cynical as that statement is , i 'd say he 's onto something . 
  try being rational . 
  yeah , still not being rational . 
  i 'm sorry it did n't work out for you . 
  this is not a true or false scenario . 
  what you said does not apply . 
  ** warning : ** this only applies to a small percentage of cats . 
  the majority will not let their bellies rubbed .

  yeah , me too even though taboo is kind of meh . 
  are n't they doing that already with carplay ? 
   and force the ios ecosystem onto another screen . 
  no you 're not . 
  you 're talking about something that exists already and apparently too stuck up to admit it . 
  i disagree but man , fuck / r/movies for downvoting opinions . 
  wait what ? 
  is n't that the joke ? 
  man that is so satisfying, 
  this is not true . 
  i use tor all the time . 
  they 've blocked reddit in the past . 
  pretty sure they will again . 
  you do realize the election was rigged ? 
  % 51.4 of the population , allegedly . 
  that 's why i said allegedly . 
  not surprised tbh . 
  he comes off as a douche in interviews too, 
  glad you had a good one , man . 
  no need to downvote though, 
  how is this glossed over ? 
  it 's one of the most significant scenes in that movie . 
  it 's the inciting incident ffs . 
  death magnetic was alright . 
  hard-wired is pretty good . 
  the only half-assed generic bullshit they put out might 've been st. anger . 
  besides , you ca n't really call metallica generic anyway since they 're the ones who paved the way for pretty much most of the generic shit out there . 
  metallica will always sound like metallica . 
  i 'm surprised you do n't know this seeing how you 're a meshuggah fan . 
  no need to thank him hitlerdinger, 
  lol, 
  i can never eat fried chicken again, 
  you come at the man in black , you best not miss . 
  but that 's sort of the whole point of gy !, 
  be is n't it ? 
  they even say themselves that the music they make are soundtracks to imaginary movies . 
  man oh man , such a mistake to argue with an entp . 
  you 'll always make an ass out of yourself .

  i doubt besiktas will fuck up their title challenge . 
  they 're the best in the league . 
  today was just ... unlucky . 
  fener sucked big time . 
   however , typically , the intp is considered the most intelligent type . 
   tfw when flair, 
   tfw not even a humblebrag, 
  lol in no league in the world is that a foul . 
  he did have the intention clearly , but there is no foul there . 
  when you 're talking about yourself , you 're never objective . 
  it 's bias all the way through . 
  i 'm not taking a jab at your theory mind you , i do n't have enough information . 
  no one does tbh . 
  i 'm just saying it 's not objective at all . 
  ... and fight club . 
   i wan na see more of him in the future .

   thanks . 
  we look forward to being your enemy . 
  * ^ slowly ^ creeps ^ back ^ off ^ the ^ thread *, 
  turkey is a country where the animals are more valued than the turkish people themselves which is ironic because most of the time you can hardly tell the animals from the people . 
  except , you know , they 're consistently in the cl when man utd is not, 
  i hope to be an optimist one day like you . 
  source for that completely ridiculous claim ? 
  you should put that imagination to good use and write screenplays . 
  should n't that be the 4th ? 
  nice . 
  i did n't even say i 'm a liberal . 
  you should n't make assumptions about people on the internet . 
  they did last year in france and belgium . 
   masterpiece, 
  talk about hyperbole . 
  lol, 
   i think that was more rdj then the actual script .
