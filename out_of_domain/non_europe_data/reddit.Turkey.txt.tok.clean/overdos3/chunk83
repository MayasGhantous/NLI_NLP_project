  you 're being unfair . 
  they both get the praise they deserve . 
  i disagree . 
  while the main riff in home is the only thing that sounds like forty six & two , the part from 4:18 til about 5:38 in the great debate is blatantly ripped off from forty six & two . 
  the riff itself , the drums , the dynamics , the cymbals portnoy uses - hell , even the lyrics talk about similar things . 
  nice job , besiktas . 
  i really enjoyed watching the team . 
  flawless football . 
  am worker at an office with cats , can confirm it 's awesome . 
  labeling every fucking thing a kid does as add or adhd is the disease of our age . 
  it 's getting pretty ridiculous . 
  i too am a master of ellipses ... 
  nice, 
  nice . 
  there is hardly anything extreme about pelagial . 
  it 's most definitely prog/post-metal . 
  i mean ... i would n't put it like that . 
  messi is on another level than ronaldo overall , but ronaldo was the best striker i 've seen no doubt, 
  * i 've not, 
  dat salt doe, 
  heaviness = / = extremity, 
  also, 
   you 're implying that post-metal ca n't be extreme . 
  that 's not what i 'm saying at all . 
  you 're putting words in my mouth . 
  pelagial is not extreme metal by any means , nor will you see that labeling anywhere else . 
  it 's pretty obvious . 
  i 'll be honest , every year i 'll hope bjk fans will learn not to cry and gracefully accept defeat for once but it 's just not going to happen is it ? 
  okay , i 'll correct him then, 
  there . 
  that 's better . 
  lol still trying i see . 
  good luck, 
  nope, 
  exactly, 
  so i 've been playing guitar for about 5 years now ( i own a rg-120 ) . 
  since i 'm not that bright in terms of technical aspect of guitar playing , i 'm just starting to figure out how shitty this guitar actually is . 
  so i decided to get a new one , maybe do a complete overhaul on my setup . 
  i play mostly heavy stuff , like tool , lamb of god , mastodon etc. 
  after doing some research , i found these guitars to suit my style the most . 
  jackson slsxmg /, 
  schecter damien elite 6 fr, 
  i really loved the ibanez ' design . 
  it also sounds like a good all around guitar . 
  the other two , i have no knowledge of whatsoever . 
  if any of you own any of these guitars , what can you tell me about their pros and cons ? 
  thanks !, 
  * rule # 1 * - they have to be alive . 
  * rule # 2 * - they ca n't be from the same band/can ' t have collaborated elsewhere . 
  my picks ;, 
  vocals - ** maynard james keenan ** ( tool , a perfect circle , puscifer ), 
  rhythm guitar - ** mark morton ** ( lamb of god ), 
  lead guitar - ** mikael akerfeldt ** ( opeth , storm corrosion , bloodbath and katatonia ), 
  bass - ** troy sanders ** ( mastodon ), 
  drums - ** gavin harrison ** ( porcupine tree mainly but he 's got a phenomenal career ), 
  i would 've loved to have danny carey on drums but that violates rule number 2 . 
  also i know mikael akerfeldt is the vocalist in opeth but he 's got amazing guitar playing skills . 
  i want to stream my pc ( not only the content ) to my samsung tv . 
  what are my options to do this other than using apple tv ( because if i 'm not wrong , it only streams the media , not the pc ) or asus wicast ( because it 's just too damn expensive ) ? 
  specs :, 
  windows 8 desktop pc, 
  samsung series 6000 led tv, 
  ... and hoooly shit . 
  i 'm never going camping again . 
  so i have a full hd samsung led tv and i usually watch movies that are on my external harddrive ( i connect it via usb ) . 
  i 'm wondering if it would look all the same if i were to watch movies that are on my pc connected to the tv via an hdmi cable . 
  movies are mostly 1080p . mkv, 
  i * kind of * know the difference between a head , a cabinet , a half-stack and a combo . 
  i would welcome a thorough explanation of them . 
  it would be very helpful . 
  what i want to do is , after i get an amp , my goal is to buy effect pedals . 
  not a lot of them , but i want to be able to experiment with them . 
  problem is , i do n't know how i should go about it . 
  if i get a cabinet , will it sound good with pedals or should i get a head * and * a cabinet ? 
  what difference would it make ? 
  is getting a combo decreases your chances of creating a unique sound with effects since they already have built-in effects ? 
  i guess what i 'm asking is ,, 
  what is the difference between, 
  effects + half stack vs effects + combo vs effects + cabinet ? 
  i play mainly metal , specifically prog metal but i 'm into many kinds of music so i would prefer a metal-focused but also a good all-around sounding amp ( or head or cabinet or whatever ) . 
  i want to be able to experiment and explore different sounds . 
  thanks in advance !,
