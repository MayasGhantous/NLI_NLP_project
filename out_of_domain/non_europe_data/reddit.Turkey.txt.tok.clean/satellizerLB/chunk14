  during season 2 i believe during ipl 4 joe miller 's name in korean stream was displayed as joe `` joe miller '' miller . 
  joe said `` do n't call me joe `` joe miller '' miller . '', 
  so now twitch will call him joe `` do n't call me joe `` joe miller '' miller '' miller '' . 
  ( thanks / u/joenips ) today this joke was `` joe `` are you guys still with me ? '', 
  miller '' because of [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3_c2be9_h8 ), 
  soon ^ ^ tm : a joke about riot 's `` soon '' concept . 
  altough , as far as i know this joke is n't originated from lol and not sure if you will see this joke at twitch . 
  tsm tsm tsm : as you can see from today 's matches ( taiwenese crowd cheered for only tsm and tpa which is a taiwanese team ) tsm is the most famous team in lol , they also have the biggest fan base . 
  they were quite dominant at earlier stages of lol scene , they also published many vlogs , funny videos about them so they got so many fans . 
  right now , they are still stong at na but they tend to fail at international stage . 
  whenever someone mentions anything related to tsm , people will spam tsm . 
  eu  na : a long running joke about which region is the best . 
  whenever they get any chance , people will thrashtalk each other in everyway possible at twitch chat . 
  eu  na 4head, 
  did tsm wonnerened ? 
  : there was a time when people were constantly asking `` did tsm win ? '', 
  after tsm matches . 
  phreak pls : lol caster/analyst david `` phreak '' turley is famous with his never ending puns . 
  whenever someone makes a pun at stream you can see this joke . 
  most of us like his jokes though . 
  also related :, 
  svenskeren incident : svenskeren is sk gaming 's jungler . 
  when they went to taiwan for group stage of worlds , he picked a racist nickname like `` changchingchong '' and offended taiwanese community . 
  he got fined for 2500 $ and suspended for 3 matches . 
  hence , sk gaming has to play with a sub right now thanks to svenskeren 's toxic behaviour . 
  these are only things i can remember right now . 
  there are always different versions of these jokes like `` activating his inner phreak '' or `` guys i 'm new to lol , why is na 's # 1 team consists only 1 person from na ? '' . 
  also , sorry for my bad grammar , just wanted to help < 3, 
  edit *, 
  `` wtf 2 * put champ name here * '' : originated from a blind pick match from korean league which is called ogn . 
  in blind pick you do n't see what you opponent has picked so there can be same champion at each side . 
  at that match , there was 2 shens , so original joke is `` wtf 2 shens '' but you can see many alternatives like `` wtf 2 fishes '' refering fizz and nami , fish-related champions . 
  `` wtf mundo mid kappa '' : in lol you can swap champions in lobby and players pick the champions who are important for their team composition . 
  so , if first pick is top laner and picks janna ( support ) you can see some spams like `` wtf janna top omg these scrubs '' . 
  if i 'm not wrong , this joke originated from people who watch lol matches for the first time like you :d, 
  `` trist balanced '' : sarcasm . 
  tristana is an adc champion and is n't balanced . 
  it 's a mystery why riot let her be for this worlds ... oh , the joke is n't always about trist of course , if someone makes a flashy play you can see this joke . 
  ah , messed up the numbers . 
  thanks for clarfying !, 
  i love how you described dota . 
  thanks , but i also want to learn how to set bpm solidly . 
  is there a trick or the way i did was right but i failed to make it right ? 
  edit * welp . 
  it 's 174 in this map too . 
  so i did n't fail at timing but just failed to map i think . 
  thanks for the help anyways !, 
  i knew it was off while writing it but could n't remember so i writed exactly as i remembered ... 
  thanks dude . 
  thank you so much !, 
  so far i was only experimenting things , this will help me greatly !, 
  i sent a message to you !, 
  i think , it 's because of ahq and ssw were having fun that game unlike sk gaming . 
  so , yeah , fuck dyrus for laughing on alistar . 
  fnc vs sso : 2-0, 
  fnc vs royal club : 1-3, 
  royal club vs omg : 2-0, 
  omg vs tsm : 2-0, 
  fnc vs c9 : 2-1, 
  i do n't know what are you trying to say but last year fnatic was clearly the best performing western team . 
  i also think that gambit was quite unlucky to meet njbs in quarter finals . 
  they lost to them 2-1 but both of their losses were close matches . 
  njbs was the only team who gave skt a run for their money , so i actually think gambit was better than royal club last year . 
  edit * wrote njws not njbs , where is my mind ... 
  oh i wrote them reversed i think ... fixing up . 
  you got the idea though :d, 
  i also edited njws to njbs but i think it was too late . 
  njbs were 2-1 over skt but skt won 3-2 so i would n't be so sure about they being `` not that good '' . 
  point is , skt was the best team and royal club was no match for them . 
  only njbs pressed over them and gambit was toe-to-toe against njbs so i though gambit was a better team than royal club . 
  oh so when svenskeren flames people he is a toxic asshole but when dyrus does it while streaming it 's funny ? 
  i said fnatic was the best performing team when looked to results but i think gambit deserved to perform better than them at s3 worlds . 
  however , i only speak based of results . 
  so , there is no guarantee about for example gambit could beat c9 , that 's just my opinion . 
  i think koreans really love blonde people . 
  first , they called bjergsen soooo handsome at allstars , now they call sjokz a godddess . 
  i think they will love rekkles too , he is superman after all . 
  edit * apparently , they 're not blonde but brown/light brown/gold brown/some tones of brown and blonde . 
  yeah beat it !, 
  i do n't know the exact word for it when i try to catogorize bjergsen , sjokz and rekkles by their hair colors i could only think about blonde . 
  woooaah dp hype !, 
  i just went to market to buy cigarettes . 
  when i left it was 3-2 in favor of edg , now 11-2 ... 
  well , that was n't unexpected . 
  yeah , maybe brown would be better . 
  is brunette the tones between blonde and brown ? 
  it 's `` kumral '' in turkish , but i did n't know it 's english meaning . 
  better check tsm votes . 
  i do n't get how is this any different from fnc or tsm fanboyism ? 
  yesterday it was % 66 in favor of tsm against royal club . 
  since the beginning of voting system in lol , this was always the case . 
  it 's just edg being a far better team . 
  seems like dp 's laning phase is n't really bad but they need to work on their teamwork and objective control . 
  this way , they ca n't accomplish anything besides turkish league . 
  all right , thanks , it 's not `` kumral '' then :d, 
  according to google translate , brunette means `` esmer '' in turkish . 
  esmer = brown/dark brown hair with lightbrown/brown skin . 
  for example , [ this . 
  am i getting it right ? 
  i get it .
