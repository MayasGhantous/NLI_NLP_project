  that 's why they have supports with them in lane . 
  it 's not about how other adc 's are weak or something . 
  think about caitlyn . 
  a strong lane bully with good late game but somewhat weak midgame if you are n't fed . 
  pretty useless w and ult while dueling hence weak dueling potential , but with strong kiting thanks to e. 
  now think about vayne . 
  very weak laning phase , decent mid game and pretty good late game with a strong self-peel and outplay options . 
  now think about lucian . 
  strong laning phase , strong midgame and strong late game with a dash which removes slows , also an ultimate which deals very high damage from a far . 
  also , high burst , pretty good sustained damage and strong dueling potential . 
  high powerspike with bloodthirster - triforce . 
  i do n't want to be `` that guy '' but i really think lucian needs some nerfs . 
  i 'm supporting alliance so i 'm happy about this win , but i chose sk gaming on my fantasy lcs team fml, 
  that 's why you should pick players from teams like millenium or evil geniuses who struggles to close out games . 
  alliance did the same thing with millenium , even though they won they only got 10 points or something . 
  and i was looking for my sneaky , left disappointed with that score . 
  that cosplay made my kokoro go doki doki . 
  actually i 'm a fan of this item . 
  pretty op in certain champs like support janna , mid tf or lulu . 
  with janna it 's really good . 
  80 ap , passive ms boost and a much needed active . 
  there is n't anything better to buy for janna anyways except mikael 's . 
  tf benefits so hard from twin shadows . 
  in case if you do n't want to build athene 's or morellonomicon , you can always buy a twin shadows . 
  it gives % 10 cdr which is n't as high as athene 's but it 's active and ms boost makes up for it , furthermore twin shadows gives more ap . 
  not a bad item at all , but very specific . 
  vladimir is underrated i think . 
  i 've started to playing vlad again recently and he is quite strong right now . 
  just like top ryze , he is somewhat strong lane bully despite his weak early game . 
  and as you all know after getting hextech revolver he becomes nearly invincible in lane . 
  other underrated champs in my opinion are lux , anivia , lissandra and vel ` koz . 
  lux , anivia and vel ` koz are really weak against highly mobile champs like fizz , zed but since exhaust got buffed they are n't picked as much as before that . 
  lissandra is also really strong but i do n't see her even in solo q that much . 
  so leblanc , nidalee , jax , kayle , ziggs , lucian , twitch remains unchanged while kha'zix gets some serious changes/nerfs again . 
  it 's hard to understand riot balance team . 
  if i was there i would safeguard to that pink ward behind him . 
  i guess , that 's why i 'm not one of the best korean junglers lol, 
  i was against this type of statements but after seeing new dignitas my mind completely changed . 
  * we decided to give lulu some more power as we want to see her as a solo laner instead of support . 
  we know that we actually designed her as a support but fuck logic . 
  we believe that this will seperate good poros from the great ones . 
  ** buff ** wild growth [ r ] - now scales with 1.0 ap, 
  ** new ** wild growth [ r ] - now triples the champion size . 
  \\ - hey ball , can you attack if you do n't mind please ? 
  - no , screw it . 
  rumors say ... 
  and i do n't think qtpie is as ambitious as forg1ven . 
  i do n't blame forg1ven for bashing his teammates but i do n't support this either . 
  yes pls let me suck it ( no homo ), 
  forget about chaos ; head or robotic ; notes . 
  watch shinsekai yori . 
  seriously , you wo n't regret it if you liked steins ; gate this much . 
  yeah, 
  wrong place dude . 
  wtf it passes through evelynn, 
  i do n't teach spanish but i can tell you , english is a hard language to learn , at least for me as a turk . 
  i 'm quite sure it 's the same for chinese people . 
  most difficult part is speaking , because you have to build sentences while speaking and that 's not really easy to learn for someone who is n't familiar with western languages . 
  pronunciation is n't easy , word order in sentence is different , there are some irregular verbs etc. 
  do you really think english is easy to learn and that 's the reason why it 's somewhat a global language ? 
  obvious answer is no , it 's quite because of capitalism . 
  japanese is easy to learn for us , because they read as they write like us and word order is very similar to ours . 
  their alphabet is different but i anyway prefer it over learning a whole new and very different language than only language i know . 
  if i said `` you lied to me ! '', 
  and you could n't answer it nothing but `` no . '', 
  it quite means you really lied to me , but the reality can be different . 
  armenians are holding a grudge against turkish people and many countries are agreeing with armenians but that does n't mean turkey is guilty . 
  you can always research about war crimes for truth . 
  also it 's sad but every country does something illegal within wars so i do n't really understand why to blame a nation for this reason while your nation did nothing but same in the past . 
  i 'm not saying they 're liars or something but they can always be misleaded . 
  i benched xwx too ... 
  but to give selfie a chance ... 
  leviathan , i believe . 
  same with addition of osu . 
  i guess i 'll watch this just because of these gifs holy shit ... 
  did the best girl wonnered ? 
  you should be very interested to forget his name . 
  anyways , i dropped it as well , but i drop series quite often so do n't mind me . 
  i actually like characters who makes `` bad '' decisions , but i do n't call them as `` bad '' . 
  because , usually they do what they feel like to do that makes them more normal , no one can be a perfect person after all . 
  not at all or i did n't notice if i got better or something . 
  awesome content but misleading title . 
  i think i just lost my fantasy lcs match because of shc and alliance ... alliance , you were my last hope :(, 
  wickd the wicked boy, 
  here you go , i did n't watch the original stream but i believe that 's what they talk about, 
  edit : with korean commentators , i could n't find one in english . 
  no , it 's sex and drug scandals . 
  it 's different though , flag does have collision like thresh 's lantern . 
  lee sin can safeguard to flag not ball . 
  indeed . 
  my first skin was marquis , if we do n't count judgement kayle . 
  it was already really strong since janna was the only champion who can shield turrets . 
  i do n't see anything really strong besides this . 
  i 'm actually wondering what do they say about na/eu lcs players . 
  not because of `` they 're korean , what they say shall be true . 
  '' , but because of curiosity . 
  how could i ever forget kassadin , teemo and tryndamere holy shit . 
  i tried archangel 's - abyssal - zhonya 's - lich bane . 
  i built these for all 3 games i 've played as nidalee and it was quite succesful . 
  actually you do n't need the mana from archangel 's very much but shield is much needed i believe .
