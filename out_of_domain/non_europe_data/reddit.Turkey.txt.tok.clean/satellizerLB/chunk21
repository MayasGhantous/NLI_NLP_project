  i got bugsplats and blackscreens many times because of my graphics card so i got a warning . 
  i stopped playing for a week , bought a laptop and never got any punishments or warnings since then . 
  i voted for only 1 warning but i 'm not sure which one i should vote because that warning is so old for me , it was n't in my control and i was n't caring about league that much . 
  i also watch twitch with my 3 laptops , provides better surround . 
  polls , most likely . 
  this dude knows his stuff . 
  he is a harsh talker and making mean jokes but i think these jokes were on point . 
  i also think , he made fun of wildturtle on purpose , so he could copy paste regi 's apology just like this . 
  i do n't really like thoorin but this time i like what he did . 
  yeah . 
  that 's why i like this apology and earlier tweets . 
  thoorin apologized for what his wildturtle joke . 
  just like what regi did about his doublelift joke . 
  it implies that wt joke was on point . 
  it was a smart move by thoorin and i do n't really have to find it `` fun '' to say `` it was on point '' . 
  actually it all comes down to show regi how it sounded when he did some stupid thing . 
  woah it 's so simple !, 
  i fucking envy you . 
  when someone adds me through spectate , i become so happy because that means someone else watched that game and liked my play . 
  bad thing is , most of these people are flamers and ragers . 
  i tried to coach one of them , unless i realized that i was only giving that bronze more reasons to flame someone else . 
  he was a toxic guy , but i did n't realize it . 
  i 'm coaching only my brother right now . 
  he is support main , i 'm a mid main but i also play bot lane pretty well so i 'm trying my best to teach him how to play properly . 
  he was silver 4 when i started to coach , right now he is gold but i 'm not sure about his league since we are both student at different cities . 
  it 's pretty satisfying to see your student to become better and better . 
  he is also perma banned at diamond . 
  well , at least 8/10 games rammus is banned in my games . 
  i 'm not sure if riot is caring about turkey server but afaik rammus is getting banned usually in na too . 
  i 'm not playing at na , it can differ . 
  in tr , maokai is permabanned and soraka-rammus-tristana gets banned usually . 
  i really like tabzz 's streams , hope he does !, 
  he is a fucking god at osu !, 
  what he said is probably true though . 
  i was a big fan of froggen at s2 and alex ich was his biggest rival for me . 
  they were the ones who innovate the game with ap kog ` maw , galio mid , evelynn mid , lee sin mid , different item paths etc. 
  this is what defines a great player from a good player in my opinion . 
  they were the best at s2 . 
  actually you are right . 
  thoorin 's froggen love is on some fanboy level , it 's not that i do n't like it but it 's true . 
  after all the shit he got at s3 froggen deserves some love and it 's coming from thooring , the douchebag we all know . 
  i do n't like this idea . 
  i like to think about assassins like adcs . 
  their job is dealing high damages in a short time and bursting squishy people . 
  adcs however deals high damages in a long time . 
  there are a few adcs who has a cc ability ; ashe , varus and vayne . 
  ashe and varus 's trade for a cc ultimate is their mobility . 
  vayne 's trade is n't her mobility but her damage dealing range which puts her in danger most of times . 
  i do n't see any trade-offs of talon or leblanc . 
  they can burst down squishy and get away with that which is all of the assassins are capable off . 
  they have mobility , burst potential , good laning phase , low cd abilities etc. 
  their target needs to some counterplay and this lies in removing silence . 
  edit * there are also assassins without any cc who does their job really well like katarina , zed , akali . 
  so , having a silence is n't really necessary . 
  right now , leblanc is still weak and talon is n't op . 
  if they stay weak riot just can buff them but re-giving them silence or any other cc including cripple is n't the answer . 
  i think rioters are smart enough to think that . 
  it seems this is n't the answer so we have exhaust now . 
  silence summoner spell is just op . 
  think about a blitz with silence summoner . 
  hook someone , knock him up then silence him for 3secs = he is dead for sure . 
  having 5 mins of cd is n't the solution here since flash has also has 5mins of cd and blitz or thresh players use it for some hook tries which is n't even guaranteed to hit . 
  talon 's laning phase is n't really weak compared to katarina or akali . 
  yeah , he is managated but his harass and trades are n't bad . 
  also , he can set-up ganks pre-6 . 
  talon 's snowball potential is on par with katarina in my opinion , both can hard carry a game with a few kills at early . 
  i did n't say they should share the same weakness but they should n't have a cc ability maybe except their ultimate since fizz has knock-up . 
  i do n't know , i 'm not a talon player . 
  but i 'm dia 2 and i 'm having problems with talon at mid lane . 
  knowing that he will be a big problem at lvl6 makes me want to punish him earlier but most of talon players are playing passive and waiting for ganks . 
  he can set up ganks , not the best but he is capable . 
  he can also follow up really easily . 
  that makes laning against talon harder . 
  compared to katarina , she wo n't be a problem if you can avoid their jungler . 
  but talon remains a problem after-6 with some jungler pressure . 
  his pre-6 is weak but i think his past-6 makes up for this . 
  he is similar to fizz in this way . 
  i think talon can use a buff to his ultimate . 
  his ultimate 's damage is up to talon and his opponent so there are enough counterplay to avoid it . 
  i think hitting those blades should be more rewarding since he does n't have silence anymore . 
  also , his teamfighting would be stronger . 
  do n't know why but i liked this so much , thanks sir for making this beauty for us . 
  that 's my first lol related wallpaper now . 
  dude is right . 
  i do n't even bother to watch chinese games , it 's like an endurance test for both teams . 
  ssw did a perfect game against dp 1 week earlier than alliance . 
  ** fb wall : ** `` x summoner just got a pentakill ! '', 
  ** x summoner 's mom : ** `` wtf x you said you were doing homework '', 
  so is ap varus . 
  nooo !, 
  i do n't want kimi no shiranai monogatari to lose but it 's opponent is so strong !, 
  kso . 
  guys , let 's vote for kimi no shiranai monogatari , huh ? 
  what if cw hires alex ich 's new team ... 
  the real plot is here . 
  holy shit , each one gets better and better . 
  you were tagged as `` gif guy '' on me but now i 'm changing it to `` gif god '' . 
  shame i did n't do this earlier . 
  hey you are that guy who made the `` robert penta '' bait thread with his quadra kill !, 
  there is no fps drops for me and i actually can get used to 2nd point .
