  oh wow , no , what 's that ? 
  ** vladimir : ** if tp meta does n't end and ryze , maokai gets nerfed vladimir will be picked up . 
  not a pick or ban situation but he will be a strong contender . 
  ** katarina : ** her laning phase is pretty weak before 6 . 
  she ca n't set up ganks but she follows perfectly so if she can get a few ganks , that lane becomes a feed fest . 
  her roaming is amazing , her late game is epic , her snowball potential is just katarina level . 
  with the nerfs to some mid laners who can punish katarina 's weak early like zed , ziggs , orianna she can get the spotlight . 
  ** diana : ** very similar to katarina but she is mana gated in lane so it 's kinda harder to go even against some mid laners . 
  ** corki : ** he is always there . 
  if lucian gets nerfed again corki will be a pick or ban i think . 
  ** soraka : ** she is really strong right now . 
  her q feels kinda weak but other 2 spells and ultimate is really strong . 
  besides the heals her targeted aoe silence shuts down pretty much every ap/ad caster . 
  thanks to that , she is the ultimate counter of some popular picks like katarina , zed , riven . 
  and then there are ** gnar , azir , irelia . 
  i do n't think viktor will become op . 
  his build path is expensive , does n't have a consistent damage output if we do n't count his ult . 
  his ult is his main threat and i do n't think he will receive any nerfs . 
  i 'm not sure how will s5 jungle changes will effect op junglers so i do n't want to make a guess about that . 
  so , ls is a shady guy because he did some shady things in his sc2 career , but ocelote is fine because he is a * great * guy ** now . 
  double standards man . 
  also , how can you fucking deny homophobic insults after seeing vods ? 
  this is so fucked up . 
  that 's why i could n't learn german in high school !, 
  i think that should be easy to read for you but it actually seems like a word group mixed with random typing to me . 
  i do n't get it , can someone explain ? 
  with lich bane it just deals too much damage but it 's range is low and he needs to land an aa after using that skill . 
  tf 's w , for example , is harder to use and deals similar damage ^ ^ i ^ ^ ca n't ^ ^ remember ^ ^ the ^ ^ exact ^ ^ ap ^ ^ ratios but can stun the target for 2 seconds . 
  so , i do n't think viktor 's q is op . 
  maybe they can re-arrange his ultimate 's damage like less burst more dps . 
  or maybe they can lower q 's aa portion and buff other portion . 
  this . 
  zilean mid was a troll pick , talon was a * worse * zed before someone picks them up . 
  you need an international lcs . 
   designed by certainlyt, 
  i hope he makes sure that kallista wo n't be op at release . 
  all of his champions are so fun to play but all of them were op at release . 
  to people who are curious he is the guy who designed zed , yasuo , thresh , darius and zyra . 
  the champion designer guy who makes the most fun and broken champs . 
  all of his champs were broken at release , they got nerfed several times . 
  but he is a fucking genius with these ideas man . 
  edit * zed is also his work . 
  here you go :, 
  new ? 
  really ? 
  if you hit kayle ult it gives assists even though she is invulnerable for that duration . 
  patch notes . 
  they fixed this a few patches ago , ca n't remember the which one right now . 
  when i alt-tab i 've gotten blackscreens but if you wait , game will be loaded properly . 
  kinda weird . 
  when kha ` zix gets in range he autoed him once then used condemn to the wall to stun and proc silver bolts . 
  then changed target to lissandra but volibear got too close to him so he autoed volibear once . 
  in that moment rengar came in and got lissandra so he started chasing volibear . 
  i mean , we are watching the same video . 
  it does n't require any skill to follow what vayne did . 
  today a zed just walked through my wall . 
  after that , i tried to interrupt j4 e-q combo , but it did n't interrupt . 
  at least anivia ' w wall actually blocks people . 
  if you alt-tab during loading screen , it becomes blackscreen . 
  at first , i thought my laptop was dying but it also happened to my friends on skype . 
  maybe it really is because of your computer , i did n't have this before 4.19 . 
  edit * fck , i had this a few times when i was using torrent . 
  i think torrent-chrome-lol together fucking up my laptop 's ram . 
  there are also spotify-skype-steam etc. 
  kayle is similar to pantheon . 
  j4 icon is kinda weird . 
  others are good . 
  i really like them , especially zilean , shen , janna and blitzcrank icons are very well done . 
  and their english is also ... ^ ^ ^ ^ jk, 
  i really like them for what they do . 
  there are alternative sites but s@20 is the best !, 
  one true goddess !, 
  holy shit ... 
  amaception, 
  and his bra size . 
  i 'm sick of upvoting him ... 
  sick, 
  even if they were to leave which i do n't really believe , fnatic would still answer like this . 
   yeah , they will leave but keep it as secret pls, 
  like , for real ? 
  if they were to leave then this probably confirms all rekkles and maybe all yellowstar . 
  i just do n't get why xpeke-soaz-cyanide would leave maybe the best e-sports organization in europe . 
  right one played in scary movie , right ? 
  the gay guy ? 
  i love that movie , thank you sir for reminding me . 
  really ? 
  what about guitar hero ? 
  they literally made fun of the game itself . 
  no one has ever done that !, 
  he sacrifices so much damage to be mobile . 
  so , this is pretty much an escape rather than an engage . 
  if you use it too close to the soldier , you ca n't . 
  you need to be far away like at max range of e. 
  with that buggy ultimate ? 
  i do n't think so mate :d, 
  yep , you only need to be like mid range of e but if you have high ping it 's better to be safe i think . 
  my thoughts exactly . 
  accounts ca n't get hacked for no reason , even if somehow he gets your pw there is e-mail protection . 
  so , i think they bought account from ebay maybe and now op wants to get his acc back with the free elo . 
  so dirty .
