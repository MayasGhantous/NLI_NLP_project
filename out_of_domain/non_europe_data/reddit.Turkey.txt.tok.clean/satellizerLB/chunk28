  you supported the guy who said these by exaggerating 120 damage loss at late game . 
  120 damage means like 50-60 damage at most in late because of mr. also , it 's only like % 5 of ryze 's 1 rotation damage in late game so it actually is n't a * big nerf * to his late game . 
  disagreeing with one guy who also disagrees someone who says similar stuff to what you said seems as supporting to me . 
  being fed is exception of course . 
  you can shit on everyone if you can get really fed with urgot . 
  i just played against a sion with botrk exploit . 
  it was the real nightmare . 
  he got 3 pentakills in our fountain with his ult-passive combo . 
  he was dying only to kill all of us in his passive state with botrk . 
  smart guy . 
  keyword : ** fed **, 
  problem is ryze was so strong for top lane so his early game was n't really that bad compared to the likes of karthus , cassiopeia , katarina , anivia etc. 
  i 'm not complaining about his late game , it 's supposed to be strong but his early game needs to be weak to compensate . 
  he had 1 warmog 's and 1 giant belt so he was staying alive enough to kill us all . 
  pretty smart , really . 
  there was a yi who was his premade he died twice to the fountain while trying to do same thing as sion . 
  are we going to play the game which we state every champions good sides ? 
  tristana is n't op at the moment , her late game is godlike and it 's supposed to be . 
  she does n't have point blank snare , massive aoe damage , mana scaling , one of the best passives in this game , built-in cdr , mr reduction and getting damage while getting tankier . 
  so , yeah , tristana should deal so much damage because she actually builds damage . 
  ryze 's late game is still godlike . 
  120 damage without calculating mr means like 50-60 damage so it really is n't effecting his late game scaling, 
  as hard as you mentioned . 
  i meant , she ca n't burst down people after 30mins mark with classic bruiser build . 
  as she gets tankier she does n't get damage unlike ryze . 
  triforce-zephyr is the best build btw , so strong . 
  actually swiftness to maximize chasing potential . 
  but i think greaves would be good too . 
  hey are n't you thay guy ... ^ ^ this ^ ^ time ^ ^ relevant, 
  that syndra or ahri ... 
  i 'm so confused ... 
  you got it . 
  i think they pressed f5 after the first game . 
  i played for like 2 weeks in season 1 but i quited the game because i could n't leave dota 1 . 
  i have judgment kayle because of this . 
  in the summer of 2012 i started playing again , so i chose 2012 . 
  that katarina nick tho . 
  0:03 ezreal 's ass ... o god why ... 
  there are some rioters who code frogs to suicide after like 50 seconds . 
  you guys are sick !, 
  holy shit these are awesome . 
  can you draw ahri for me ? 
  i bet there are a lot of other people who wants this too . 
  i do n't understand . 
  this decade ? 
  twitch.tv / flosd, 
  my dick is so confused . 
  i do n't even care about their child . 
  shook decides to play rammus top , nyph is sick of waiting for an adc so he decides to play jungle , froggen is the master of blitzcrank so he plays support . 
  wickd is the new adc boys . 
  oh btw , i 'm sure they got rekkles from fnatic for mid lane because mid is the only available role for him at the moment . 
  holy shit . 
  yeah alliance , motherfucker !, 
  he is top 2 with rekkles . 
  they have different strenghts , you can argue about which one is the best . 
  mrrallez was 3rd adc at eu in my opinion . 
  i do n't have enough information about neils but according to what i heard he is kinda like rekkles 1 year ago . 
  he can become the best at eu or he can go for k0u road . 
  intel extreme masters . 
  old home of gambit , best tournaments before lcs format except worlds . 
  fuck my eyes . 
  awwww so much poro . 
  cutee !, 
  sorry but ... 4head, 
  is it confirmed or ** confirmed ** ? 
  you know nothing . 
  newbie osu player here ( lvl40 but i 'm able to play only 4-5star difficulties yet ) , i have a few questions if you do n't mind to answer :, 
  1 - how can i have the chat bar at bottom ? 
  is it something about the skin or something i can set at options ? 
  2 - what 's that skin , seems so clean to me . 
  i try to prefer clean skins since i 'm not good at this game yet . 
  upboats to the left xddddddd, 
  he is right . 
  i 'm not against importing foreign players but it 's true that they 're preventing local players to become pro . 
  of course foreign players are better because teams are only getting pro and good players so it 's not making much sense when you compare them to local amateur players . 
  thank you good sir . 
  when yasuo was out everyone was maxing q first . 
  then some people tried to max e and it became really op at lane so it got nerfed . 
  i mean , i do n't give a fuck what they say about kallista now . 
  she is a really unique champion like yasuo so i think we have to wait and see . 
  he 's blind , not deaf . 
  i think you have n't played warcraft 3 ... `` i 'm blind , not deaf . '', 
  was one of the illidan quotes . 
  downloaded and tried to test in a custom game with bots . 
  died to enemy turret and ... `` report this piece of shit . '', 
  you made me laugh so hard , thank you good sir . 
  yep , the man who designs the most fun and op champs at release . 
  actually his shyvana , renekton , malphite , jax was also at least top 2 at eu . 
  from what i can see , he likes to play tanky bruiser champs . 
  his lulu , ryze was also good but i do n't think they were the top at eu . 
  [ daniel uk dude ] ( http://www.oddcast.com/home/demos/tts/tts_example.php?sitepal ), 
  yellowstar, 
  i do n't get why u cut out minimap and other stuff . 
  same goes to every top laner . 
  balls is a fucking monters on rumble but his other champs do n't shine as much as his rumble . 
  his lulu , nidalee was average and i ca n't even recall a game where he played kayle . 
  his ryze was pretty good tho . 
  soaz is really good with mage type top laners like lissandra , lulu , ryze but his irelia was awful . 
  there are many examples . 
  but there is no need to hate them just for that , they ca n't play every champion to their fullest after all .
