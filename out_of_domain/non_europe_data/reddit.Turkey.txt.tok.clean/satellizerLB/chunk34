  dying with leblanc to kassadin especially before 6 is bad . 
  just bad . 
  it 's not even about flask or something . 
  soul ring ? 
  sounds good to me . 
  but i think we need new boots with tp ability . 
  uhmm we can call it boots of travel maybe ? 
  first look : wtf wall of text, 
  while reading : wtf lol, 
  everything was perfect but lelouch 's ideals were the things what made me fall in love with that series . 
  kokoro connect , hands down . 
  [ spoilers ] ( / s `` inaban 's confession of course . '' ), 
  some things do n't change . 
  i 'm also an atheist but this alone is n't able to stop my family to send me to mosque at religious festivals . 
  colorwise it 's really clean and seeming good . 
  i just ca n't stand classic hitsounds . 
  edit * this is the reason why i started to play taiko first . 
  [ spoiler ] ( / s `` your comment is a spoiler dude . '' ), 
  oh you ... 
  i 'm sorry for my foolness . 
  [ real best confession ] ( http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m8lt5ndto71qzqnxxo1_500.gif ), 
  i want to become lonely now . 
  if by high elo you mean dia3 + i think i can tell some things . 
  i 'm diamond 3 at euw right now , so :, 
  1 ) false, 
  2 ) true, 
  3 ) true, 
  4 ) false, 
  5 ) false, 
  there are some exceptions for 2-3 but yeah most people say things like these . 
  his base damages are actually pretty low but w-q combo hurts too much in lane . 
  mostly because it 's so hard to dodge or sidestep so you get hit like everytime . 
  so is this what happens when bot takes the screenshot when the site is down ? 
  afaik kokoro connect is n't made by kyoani . 
  watch your mouth . 
  so where is onodera ? 
  edit : i mean best girl onodera aka onodera kosaki . 
  [ oh ... ] ( https://31.media.tumblr.com/7ac67b55ae9cc88935d53c7d13e78b4f/tumblr_mymv0cakvu1rd0czro2_r1_400.gif ), 
  i was n't even aware that i got downvoted . 
  and it 's not just this sub but whole reddit actually . 
  best girl onodera of course . 
  well , i love her for that exact reason . 
  edit : i mean she can do cute moves like always and i would n't have any objection . 
  i did n't add like the last 20 anime i watched and most of the tags are in turkish but whatever :,

  guilty crown, 
  who won ? 
  i could n't follow the finals . 
  there is a big difference . 
  there types `` best girl '' in / r/chitoge but there is n't a writing like that in / r/onodera because it 's pretty obvious that onodera is best girl . 
  that 's ... unexpected . 
  i was punching myself while watching freezing : vibration at certain episodes . 
  like i 've never been that angry while watching an anime . 
  mostly because of my username tho . 
  and yeah i do n't really like freezing manga too . 
  foolish question , answer is simple : because they 're dicks . 
  i mean i would expect tohsaka rin or inaba himeki to win that contest since they have many fans here . 
  kurisu was more like only girl than best girl in steins ; gate series in my opinion . 
  so i did n't expect kurisu to win . 
  edit : i just made up that only girl concept but whatever you got the idea . 
  hey i 'm on saber 's side too mostly !, 
  but people here like tohsaka more . 
  edit : i think it 's pretty obvious that i watched fate/stay night first lol, 
  release elise of course , at top lane . 
  good and easily abusable idea . 
  so , no . 
  happy cakeday !, 
  [ guilty crown - release my soul ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsjewsy8qn4 ), 
  i want to be a board now . 
  someone must be succesful at annoying le redditorz . 
  thank you good sir . 
  he really seems like a scripter but :, 
  \u2718 witch hunting or hateful speech . 
  i 'm afraid this thread will get deleted soon before getting enough recognation . 
  he moved to top tho . 
  well , garen has only a silence and mundo has only a slow as a skillshot so that does n't make rek ` sai any better . 
  they are n't . 
  they 're good for solo q. 
  for example when you play against swain , you must have at least 2 sources of grievious wounds including ignite to kill him . 
  in solo q however that 's not as often so swain becomes op against some comps . 
  he is n't skill based but more like practice based . 
  if you play like 10 games with azir , he kinda becomes free lp . 
  his laning is strong , mid game is strong , late game is too strong . 
  he does have some weaknesses but still he seems op to me . 
  delete teemo please, 
  3 crits or ? 
  i do n't really get it . 
  madhouse , shaft , p.a. 
  works . 
  i love a-1 pictures for making some great series but their animation is n't the best . 
  soraka can heal it . 
  and of course you lose your % 10hp for nothing . 
  and knock-up !, 
  whoa 175 people here on euw . 
  i was n't expecting this much . 
  shame i ca n't play tonight , i have exams this week . 
  here is the comparison video with original one and live action one : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fykgvrb9uk4, 
  gits as # 51 and 5cm per second as # 54 ... uhhh , i think we really have too different tastes in anime movies . 
  he is n't famous here but oh my fucking god that 1v2 is so beatiful . 
  there were a few pretty solid titles this year but overall 2014 was a bad year when compared to 2013 , 2012 or 2011 .
