  fairy tail 1st season, 
  i like how talon stopped for an instant in the tunnel and after leaving the tunnel . 
  this rewben2 guy knows his stuff :,

  small k, 
  this song is making me remember a certain website ... 
  freezing : vibration 6-8 . episodes, 
  [ spoiler ] ( / s `` watching her cousin to rape her and her being defenseless also kinda seductive '' ) was the worst . 
  made me regret for choosing this username lol, 
  bad poll for many reasons . 
  there should be more options like kimi no todoke/rainbow : nisha rokubou no shichinin/true tears/mirai nikki/zetsuen no tempest/black lagoon/elfen lied etc , unfinished shows should n't be there and every show should be represented as 1 title . 
  i mean , bakemonogatari should be 1 title since for example code geass is being represented with 1 title . 
  but i voted anyways :, 
  shinsekai yori,

  i do n't like to waiting or following recommandations so usually i watch some finished show from the last season . 
  if i ca n't find a show to watch from last season , i usually read like 10-15 show 's summary then decide one of them , happens rarely tho . 
  we marathoned whole season with my brother since he loves freezing too . 
  and we were about to punch each other at these episodes . 
  corki 's ult has a static 2sec cooldown and this ca n't be reduced by cdr . 
  no , it should n't . 
  you touch my tralala, 
  great video and great song as always . 
  i 'm contributing with my opinion which means this idea is pretty bad and it should n't be in game . 
  anyone ?

  in first season it was more like a [ spoiler ] ( / s `` forced rape/harass and satellizer actually fought back or at least reacted i mean '' ) but in freezing : vibration [ spoiler ] ( / s `` satellizer did n't even react to anything even if it was in front of aoi kazuya . '' ), 
  i could n't bear watching those scenes , it 's just [ spoiler ] ( / s `` her cousin used her as a whore and satellizer did nothing about it except following the lead . '' ), 
  nothing special honestly , first season was better imo . 
  but i ca n't say do n't watch since it actually entertained me . 
  til elspeth streams . 
  i 'm a big fan of her voice holy shit how could n't i see her streaming before ... 
  thanks for reminding this video . 
  a wise man said `` he is a well known dude in some other subreddit ( it was / r/starcraft2 i believe ) so another dude made this gif for him and people started to post this to like all of his comments . '', 
  this is awesome . 
  i probably wo n't use this since i do n't like this type of stuff but this is fucking awesome and well made . 
  fuck ultimate skin and shaco rework and izuna and whatever left . 
  we have urf !, 
  yay !, 
  you mean daniel uk voice from [ this site ] ( http://www.oddcast.com/home/demos/tts/tts_example.php?sitepal ) ? 
  i just want a well done unreal tournament or quake announcer pack . 
  and here i was wondering about why i tagged this guy as `` butthurt for whatever reason '' , thanks for reminding me . 
  now i want that back button !, 
  you can google for them and find the difference yourself dude . 
  i 'm having better results with direct x by the way . 
  thank you good sir !, 
  i did . 
  because of edit . 
  which means first people who saw his comment did n't agree with him and decided that he did n't contribute to the discussion so they downvoted him . 
  sometimes i get like -10 then it becomes +20 somehow because different people vote at different times . 
  there is no reason to be an asshole for a subject like this . 
  ninjaedit : not you , him . 
  i usually do n't like leaked informations but lol is an exception . 
  it 's 00:19 here , thanks for this relaxing video . 
  his original post was something like `` tenacity is a added stat '' but he got downvoted for whatever reason so he edited with `` i ca n't believe i 'm getting downvoted even tho i said the right thing omg you all are pathetic '' etc. 
  there was a thread about lux passive yesterday . 
  it was suggesting that her passive should also give vision . 
  i simply stated my opinion and said `` no , it should n't happen . '', 
  then i got downvoted into the oblivion because i was the minority i think . 
  it 's just one should n't care about voting here since it becomes meaningless so often . 
  it 's not about stating a fact or an opinion but people here . 
  some people likes to downvote i think . 
  good good ... 
  i do n't give a fuck about ultimate skin or izuna or shaco rework or fucking ao shin ... 
  but ... 
  i want u.r.f back god dammit !, 
  that anime is where i got my nickname !, 
  source ? 
  this contains all niko skins and most of them have the hitsounds you looking for . 
  niko v5 would be a good choice since it is minimalistic and clear . 
  oh this thread again ... 
  epic meme !, 
  i know what they are . 
  i had to research them to be honest since it was my homework for a lesson i take . 
  while watching freezing : vibration i was stunned when i realized she is voicing rana linchen . 
  it was my first anime back then so i did n't have a clue about kanahana when i watched first season . 
  it 's like she is everywhere only looking to be found by us . 
  smeagol/gollum was a kind bastard to frodo but look what he did ... 
  so i suggest you to not believe in this type of kindness . 
  ninjaedit * example is from lotr because i just finished marathoning it . 
  fuck you derethor . 
  and fuck you grima . 
  and fuck you too gollum . 
  upvoted because i want to see what will happen ... 
  it 's a win-win for us after all . 
  graves was always strong after they buffed his r . it was just lucian was better . 
  from what i can remember from your vlog you said `` i wanted to win , alliance wanted to win . 
  xpeke and cyanide were going to leave fnatic so i joined alliance since they wanted me in . '', 
  my question is , why tabzz said `` rekkles wants to replace me since the beginning of summer . '' ? 
  because tabzz seems like he is n't going to stop playing in lcs , so him leaving alliance on his own does n't make sense to me . 
  i love alliance since they founded the team and you because you are a good person from what i can see but i 'm just wondering . 
  this question may sound as i 'm doubting you or alliance but that 's not my actual intent , it 's my english being poor that i ca n't express myself perfectly . 
  i do n't get it . 
  not at all . 
  i get that rape/incest rape/harassing is a common fetish in japan but watching the protagonist that way was just unbearable for me . 
  and [ spoiler ] ( / s `` they fucking forgave him . 
  like holy shit . '' ),
