  mr runes , 21-0-9 masteries . 
  follow this skill order before 6 : e-q-w-e-q-r then max q-w-e . 
  in lane try to trade at level 1 since if she level q she ca n't pop it or if she level w it wo n't damage you because of your shield and your aas hurt more than her . 
  then do n't try to trade with her because of her mobility . 
  if she overextends , you can punish her . 
  just wait for her to return to w place or her w place to be gone . 
  if you level e twice it will protect you from the big part of her trading power so you can outtrade her if she overextends . 
  otherwise , do n't try to trade , just farm . 
  use your q to zone her . 
  problem is when you use q , most of leblanc players will try to trade with you . 
  you need to get a bit away to avoid this but not so far to not make ball dissappear . 
  also if you are gon na ask for a gank , do it while you have at least 4/5hp . 
  you need to force a trade with leblanc then wait for her to use w . she is easy to gank after this . 
  most of leblanc players think that they 're untouchable in lane so they use their mobility ability in every possible chance including clearing waves . 
  you do n't need to kill her , as long as you do n't die , you win . 
  it 's the main rule of this match-up . 
  source : master tier in turkey server , dia3 in euw . 
  edit : you do n't need to push lane if you can trade with her . 
  honestly i do n't have trouble with leblanc maybe because leblanc was always popular in turkey server and i 'm so used to playing against her . 
  syndra is much more annoying to play against . 
  edit2 : orianna is one of the strongest laners in lol , she can win against like everyone maybe with the exception of syndra . 
  it 's just that she is bad at killing people in lane , so you need to farm and zone your opponent in order to abuse her strong laning phase . 
  seems like he really do n't understand . 
  you mean mym maelk ? 
  that legendary captain of the legendary dota team ? 
  holy shit i did n't know this . 
  he was mym 's captain . 
  meet your makers was the best team in dota for a time , then they started to fall off but they always have been a very strong team in competitive scene . 
  i was n't following dota competitive scene while they were the best , but from what i see he was n't an outstanding player but a perfect captain , kinda like hai . 
  edit : fuck me , i answered wrong comment ... 
  i was a big fan of him while i was following dota pro scene . 
  being the best for 1-2 years of course . 
  in e-sports this is like a fucking age . 
  voicing a problem is not the same as spamming with posts i think . 
  riot is aware of this problem , that 's for sure . 
  and riot is known for working slowly . 
  also we do n't even have a clue that riot is to blame here . 
  so , yeah , i 'd rather see these posts removed . 
  except this problem wo n't dissappear instantly . 
  it will take at least months since riot did n't even promise anything yet . 
  i know that someone should raise his voice to express his problem if he thought he could n't yet . 
  but , it 's not like riot was n't aware of this problem . 
  it 's just some people raged this morning and made threads here , they got attention , so they started to spam it to force riot to do something . 
  this is the part what annoys me . 
  riot ca n't do a shit instantly after all . 
  [ euw lag problems took 2.5-3 years to dissappear so ... ] ( http://i.imgur.com/agci8.gif ), 
  hope my response helps . 
  happy cakeday !, 
  allstars login screen was really good . 
  because he was too strong so people started to hate him . 
  this is n't about his animations etc. 
  i actually love his animations . 
  when i first played him i felt like max payne especially when ulted . 
  yes, 
  getting multikill with one ability like final spark , wind slash , or colleteral damage . 
  is it weird that i was actually expecting something like this despite the title ? 
  danshi koukousei no nichijou - 7 [ spoiler ] ( / s `` especially literary girl part is too good '' ), 
  guild wars 2 - osu !, 
  - warcraft 3, 
  i actually do n't play lol as much as i did in the past , i started to play these games again . 
  i 'm gon na try archeage too but people say it 's pay2win so i 'm not sure about it . 
  aaaaaaaaaaaa, 
  uhmm ... gogoing and wickd ? 
  edit : i did n't think he meant korean players , my bad . 
  still gon na watch lcs tho . 
  well it 's more about the labor points . 
  i do n't exactly know how labor points are important in the game but it seems like if i want to play archeage seriously i will be have to buy monthly subscription . 
  can you enlighten me ? 
  legion td all the way buddy !, 
  not complex but hard to master . 
  pretty much like vayne or ahri . 
  ninjaedit : i mean there are n't things like `` if you hit a champion , you get * this * . 
  if you do n't you just do * this * . '', 
  like azir 's kit . 
  or an unstable transformation mechanic or a passive which screws kiting while providing more kiting . 
  donger is coming . 
  if you believe you will get fed , it is better . 
  i mean , this build is much more expensive . 
  because , auto actually deals damage and you can cast q just right after auto . 
  ** orianna : ** start with e , bully your opponent at lvl1 with your aas . 
  you will win almost any trades including a little damage from minions because of shield and armor/mr bonus . 
  starting with q just does n't pay off . 
  ** anivia : ** level your wall twice or thrice after maxing e. q is n't reliable unless the target is ccd or you set up a good wall . 
  and for a good wall you need to have a bigger wall since rank 1 wall is pretty small . 
  i actually saw froggen doing this so i tried and this works really well . 
  ** janna : ** run ad/armor/scalingmr runes and play aggressive at lvl1 with your shield so you can get to lvl2 faster . 
  at lvl2 play more aggressive till your opponents also gets to lvl2 . 
  this will at least burn opponent adc 's hp potion so he will be have to play really carefully . 
  this also works with ** lulu ** and because of her passive she does n't need ad runes to have an impact in earlier levels . 
  you ca n't tell me what to do !, 
  here , have an upvote !, 
  i was looking for this gif in this thread . 
  first of all , i 'm 21 years old , in my last year of university . 
  as for the answer , if i were about to ask someone `` hey would you prefer kuudere or tsundere ? '', 
  it would be just nonsense . 
  i mean , if no one knows what you are talking about , it 's pretty much pointless . 
  but , sometimes i use some lines from anime like `` you are weak . 
  why you are weak ? 
  because you lack hatred . '', 
  by uchiha itachi because they fit to some situations and i like to make references .
