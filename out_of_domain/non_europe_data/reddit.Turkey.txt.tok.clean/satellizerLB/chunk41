  it was n't that bad with the hitsounds i like so i started to play classic mode too . 
  it 's been 4 months since i started to play classic mode and recently i 've been playing % 70 classic and % 30 taiko . 
  2addicting4me . 
  look for the approach rate ( ar ) . 
  it should be at the top left corner of your screen in song list . 
  there types , for example , ar :5 od :4 cs :4 . 
  you can also search for things like `` ar = 6 '' or `` ar = 6 cs = 4 '' etc. 
  try to play higher ar songs but too much . 
  if you are able to play ar5 , then try to play ar6 . 
  when you get comfortable enough with ar6 then try to play ar7 and goes on . 
  it helps with your reading . 
  saikou and shuujin from bakuman . 
  pretty shoes, 
  that 's mean dude . 
  then do n't click , do n't read , watch the game , watch highlights . 
  just do n't complain . 
  you better record it and post here !, 
  i remember qu1ckshot saying `` why did elise use rappel to return ? 
  it makes no sense ! '', 
  while she was bugged out and died . 
  fnatic fanboys dude . 
  relevant flair . 
  then do n't buy it . 
  you made me remember when i first tried ap ezreal mid . 
  my opponent was a mordekaiser and he started with 13pots ... 
  i still ca n't ap ezreal because of that nightmare . 
  ad tf was more popular than ap tf . 
  no , you are allowed to express your opinions . 
  it 's just that if they are n't contributing to the discussion or if they 're off-topic , we are also allowed to downvote you . 
  that 's how reddit works . 
  he is right . 
  i was supporting nyph but something has to change in elements and that would be nyph or wickd . 
  i still believe in them but they need to produce some results . 
  lately they both are holding elements back . 
  why the fuck did they delete other post ? 
  nice stuff . 
  but still i think mods are biased . 
  maybe . 
  since you let multiple east coast ping threads to make to front page i always thought mods are biased . 
  i ca n't completely express myself in english but i get that you are working hard and i think we all appreciate that . 
  so wrong . 
  `` player y showing emotion '' was the thread . 
  that thread 's only meaning was `` hey guys player y does n't usually show his emotions but this time he did ! '' . 
  and i ca n't see how that is any better than `` it is player z 's birthday '' . 
  [ i do n't know what to believe ... ] ( http://i.imgur.com/2m2eu2a.jpg ), 
  upvoted because roberta 's arc . 
  now i have to listen bios again ... beatiful video dude . 
  it 's because of timezones . 
  i really want to watch them and i 'm really curious about lpl but when they play i 'm either at school or sleeping . 
  this game made elements games look like bloodfest . 
  if that is real , i like calitrlolz already . 
  as an ex-muslim atheist , can confirm . 
  so i had some doubts about * destiny * thing and my family recommended me to read the quran . 
  i could n't even finish the quran , full of bullshit in my opinion . 
  i did n't read the bible but i do n't think it 's any better than the quran . 
  in the quran , everything is about arab and jew people . 
  people say it 's an universal and eternal book but while reading it , it 's so obvious that it 's just a book about arab people written by muhammed . 
  he mentioned like every weather except * snow * . 
  because he did n't even know what that is . 
  that 's how i started to question my religion . 
  soon after i became a deist , then atheist . 
  it 's just i 'm not able to express myself completely in english and that just went in my head so i wrote it . 
  no game no life . 
  an anime about 2 siblings sent to a world that everything are to be solved by games . 
  that was a weird and slow-loading gif . 
  to be honest , this game is 5v5 not 1v1 . 
  yeah ... 
  i think so ... 
  stacking takes a long time though . 
  but still i think it needs a max damage limit . 
  did it !, 
  in turkish , we do n't use a word like `` the '' so it 's a bit confusing for me . 
  thanks !, 
  well , god says `` do n't kill '' but he kills anyways and promotes killing in the name of * religion * . 
  wait , so you are telling me that people lie on the internet ? 
  ahzab 53 from quran :, 
   o you who have believed , do not enter the houses of the prophet except when you are permitted for a meal , without awaiting its readiness . 
  but when you are invited , then enter ; and when you have eaten , disperse without seeking to remain for conversation . 
  indeed , that [ behavior ] was troubling the prophet , and he is shy of [ dismissing ] you . 
  but allah is not shy of the truth . 
  and when you ask [ his wives ] for something , ask them from behind a partition . 
  that is purer for your hearts and their hearts . 
  and it is not [ conceivable or lawful ] for you to harm the messenger of allah or to marry his wives after him , ever . 
  indeed , that would be in the sight of allah an enormity . 
  it 's like muhammed was too shy and afraid of his guests so he wrote this . 
  completely obnoxious , riot . 
   gigantic bug, 
  oh come on ... 
  fate stay/night, 
  [ that question will be answered this sunday night !,

  calitrlolz : got the ward ** #worth **, 
  in turkey , common story is :, 
  isis was a force to beat esad in syria . 
  erdogan also helped western countries in this matter . 
  then somehow esad won , isis got out of control and now they 're producing their own funds like selling illegal oils , stealing from public resources etc. 
  but you are not fat ... 
  it 's not possible . 
  he is either a multi-account user or a hacker . 
  hey nice joke dude !,
