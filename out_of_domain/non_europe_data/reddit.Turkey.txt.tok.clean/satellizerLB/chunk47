  `` rekkles only plays hyper carries and farms all game '' is one of the worst circlejerks here . 
  his most played champion this split is graves with 8 games second one being corki with 3 games . 
  he averaged 403gpm while steelback averaged 409gpm with a so much better team . 
  i agree that he sucked in the first half of this split , but second half he improved . 
  not a miles of improving , he was playing more aggressively and taking up more risks . 
  oh i meant that their early game was really good . 
  not sure about c9 game as a throw but i remember that way for some reason . 
  him leaving fnatic was a big deal because it was a surprise move for us since they did n't share anything at all . 
  we learnt what was going on behind the scenes but it was too late to stop the rekkles the betrayer circlejerk . 
  when you say `` the weakest korean team '' it almost sounds like njws is a coast caliber team . 
  first one was funny . 
  this one is n't . 
  b-but ... 
  #riot !, 
   what did i just witness, 
  diamond in euw and i play top/jungle worse than a silver . 
  i know i 'm worse because whenever i try to play top/jungle in normals , i get shit on by bronzies/silvers and some unranked players . 
  free kill ? 
  it 's not like dodging a skillshot or juking someone but staying away from the trap . 
  it wo n't be boring but uol vs fnc will be more exciting . 
  that 's what i think . 
  their last match highly disagrees with you dude . 
  i 'm not salty dammit, 
  as should n't lower yasuo q 's cd xd it 's like saying yeah as should lower the cd of nidalee spears :p both skills have nothing to do with each other still true for yasuo q, 
  i do n't know how you got that idea xd, 
  i really do n't know what ad carries want at this point . 
  assassin meta ? 
  frustrating to play against since they can 1-shot all ad carries . 
  frustrating to play against since they can poke non-stop and most of the ad carries are helpless against this . 
  frustrating to play against since they 're too tanky and ad carries are having trouble with killing them . 
  edit : thornmail is a fine item in the late game . 
  with lw-bt it 's not like you are killing yourself . 
  there is also an elixir for more lifestealing . 
  edit2 : please do n't make arguments like `` 6 item twitch ca n't kill 6 item maokai '' . 
  well , you see , twitch is a hypercarry but he is n't strong against tanks . 
  `` maokai with fh-thornmail-warmogs-whatever else ca n't be killed '' if maokai is fed , yes , he should be hard to kill . 
  he is tank , his itemization is tanky , he buys them to become hard to kill and he is fed so he has lots of gold . 
  is n't it only normal that he is hard to kill at that point ? 
  meanwhile kog ` maw shreds through thornmail tanks . 
  vayne kites them forever and can actually kill them . 
  jinx outranges tanks and deals heavy damage in the short range with a hp scaling ultimate . 
  caitlyn is caitlyn . 
  and there are also 4 members of your team . 
  if they do n't help you , you should be bound to death by the enemy frontliners . 
  this is only natural for ad carries since most of them ( except urgod ) meant to be squishy and weak alone . 
  tl ; dr : i agree with cinderhulk being too strong but i do n't think tank meta is problematic . 
  edit3 : everyone is giving the example of maokai ... are you people sure that the problem is thornmail/cinderhulk/tank meta/cost effiency on tanks or just the maokai ? 
  you are just exaggerating . 
  i 'm still having success with ad carries especially with caitlyn and vayne . 
  caitlyn because her long range and kite ability , vayne because % max hp true damage . 
  that 's called counterplay and i 'm fine with it . 
  even with sweeper vayne is still able to kite them with condemn and tumble . 
  diamond 4 in euw at the moment . 
  was diamond 1 in tr before the reset . 
  i started playing ranked this season only 3 weeks ago . 
  thanks for your concern . 
  i wo n't make a thought race in this matter since i actually had success with vayne . 
  i just said `` i 'm having success with vayne '' and `` vayne is able to kite '' . 
  i did n't say `` vayne 's laning phase is okay '' . 
  but vayne is n't a shitty pick . 
  actually no champion is a shitty pick in solo q. 
  that 's my point . 
  when i realized vayne is the only adc who is capable of easily 1v1 my sejuani , i tried to play her and found that she is actually doing pretty good . 
  i 'm not a really good vayne or something but still i 'm doing well with vayne in this meta which means vayne should be a considerable pick right now . 
  meanwhile you deal true damage scaling with the enemy 's max hp which is the weakest point of tanks and tanks does n't actually have limitless hit points or defensive abilities . 
  or you are playing another adc who builds bt and bt actually has % 20lifesteal not % 10 like botrk which means you are capable of mitigate the thornmail damage only with bt ( which is the core of many ad carries ) and elixir ( which should be considered against thornmail tanks ) . 
  i love how you made it sound like you are literally helpless against tanks . 
  i like tank meta because they 're easier to kite and they deal low damage . 
  and i 'm pretty sure i 'm not alone . 
   as gooby pointed out you will do more dmg to yourself even when counter building . 
  `` if you have  233.3 effective armor , thornmail will reflect more damage than you receive , assuming the attacker has 0 magic resist ; if they have 30 magic resist ,  333.3 armor is required . '', 
  - source : http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/thornmail, 
  let 's say it 's the late game and your enemy big bad tank got 350 armor ( actually this is pretty absurd unless your whole team is ad . 
  actually full ad teams should suck at late game but that 's not my point here ), 
  most of ad carries get % 30 lifesteal with core items ( bt-elixir of wrath ) . 
  if you get spirit visage this value gets higher and you get mr against thornmail damage . 
  if you get banshee 's / ga/mercurial scimitar this value stays the same but you get mr against thornmail damage . 
  if you are getting botrk you get a total of % 20 lifesteal with elixir . 
  this seems bad ... 
  but hey you can still get mr item , right ? 
  so that big bad enemy tank 's thornmail does n't do much damage ? 
  you will also have a kiting ability that comes with botrk active . 
  seems like there is a counter-play that no adc main wants to see . 
  i 'm better than imp-uzi-deft combined dude . 
  i 'm able to dodge aas and exhaust . 
  why is this downvoted ? 
  did you even ** read ** what i ** typed ** before ? 
  god bless . 
  but they still build their items only to increase their dps even if they 're picked for some other purposes . 
  tn : plan means keikaku . 
  #thank you deficio, 
  hello ( sorry for bad german ), 
  i thought that was a gif ... 
  tl ; dr : faker is carrying lck . 
  for further informatin , read the whole text . 
  nice read . 
  i usually do n't read this long posts and search for a tl ; dr but this one got me . 
  first of all , they do n't train mindlessly . 
  * good infrastructure * keeps them training well and that 's what is important . 
  believe it or not western players also play league and train hard .
