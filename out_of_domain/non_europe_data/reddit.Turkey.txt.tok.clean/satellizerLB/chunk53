  more like , that unranked guy who finds himself with some high elo dudes in a normal game . 
  i heard that movie called titanic is also pretty good . 
   if a wildcard region had the imports na has , they would be better and stronger, 
  must ... watch ... this ... 
  itt people shitting rekkles because elements had a bad split, 
  thanks for the spoiler dude . 
  i hear eng dub of steins ; gate for the first time and damn mayushi sounds so cute . 
  it 's 6:05 am here , ready to go to school without sleeping .

  the house always wins . 
  hnnnnnnnng, 
  actually i think forg1ven is the adc fnatic needs with agressive playmaker gameplay with strong laning and mechanics . 
  the best , you mean . 
  my ears bleed , thanks . 
  every adc ever, 
  mods being nazi mods nothing new . 
  that dog ... 
  i like that dog . 
  1st | liquid | elements | eu, 
  2nd | c9 | fnatic | eu, 
  3rd | tsm | h2k | na, 
  4th | tip | gambit | na, 
  5th | clg | origen | eu, 
  6th | gravity | sk gaming | eu, 
  9th | team dk | roccat | no idea, 
  10th | enemy e-sports | giants | no idea, 
  i may be biased towards elements anyways i feel like they will come strong this split . 
  and i the 4-7th places are so close that i just placed them alphabetically . 
  as a * healthy * assassin zed should find opportunities to engage . 
   and i the 4-7th places are so close that i just placed them alphabetically . 
  `` u '' letter comes last . 
  i actually believe that uol will do good this split , but this time their opponents seem better . 
  not sure if they can make semi-finals if elements also perform good this split . 
  they played good last split and i think they will continue to do their stuff but this time their opponents are stronger . 
  gambit with forg1ven seems like a better sk gaming to me , there is origen , sk gaming is always somehow strong . 
  i believe elements will go big even if they do n't they will be a serious opponent for uol . 
  and then there are fnatic & h2k . 
  it 's like even if they finish at 4-5th place it will be a better finish than spring split considering their opponents . 
  tip was always strong and they got stronger throughout the spring split . 
  i think they will come back stronger and yeah that means they seem better than gambit to me . 
  last time i put my hopes on a new talented adc ( rekkles ) it failed so hard . 
  and now you are overhyping uol . 
  god bless this bot . 
  this is perfect . 
  that was n't his intend obviously . 
  read again . 
  i mean sneaky is also really good and probably so close to forg1ven in terms of carrying ability but forg1ven seems a bit better to me . 
  i actually really liked p1noy . 
  hope that he comes back stronger . 
  this is perfect . 
   gunbound, 
  now that you reminded me i have to play it again . 
  and what 's wrong with being a niche pick as an assassin in the tank meta ? 
  that and you are overestemating . 
  zed will do just fine , this nerf will mainly help mid laners with skillshot-cc like xerath , ahri , brand etc. 
  well actually as an assassin zed should find opportunities to engage aka making your opponent miss his cc then engage . 
   with this nerf , there would be pretty much no reason to pick him over leblanc or even fizz . 
  damn son they are n't nerfing his damage or anything . 
  this nerf wo n't reduce his damage . 
  they 're doing this because recently zed became a r-e-aa-r machine which deals 2/3 of an adcs hitpoints . 
  zed is an assassin . 
  assassins deal damage and get out . 
  zed is able to do this . 
  dealing damage and getting out while being nearly untouchable is n't good for assassins . 
  zed is also able to do this . 
  they 're nerfing this exact point . 
  / s is for pussies who are afraid of getting downvoted . 
  seems like they have . 
  edit : woah there are some new mobiles . 
  same with reddit . 
  some haters , some neutrals , some defenders . 
  risky click of the day . 
  their old line-up was better on paper yet for some reason i 'm more excited for this line-up . 
  he was the best before he left for curse , so being top 3/4 was a downgrade for him . 
  no questions but i just want to say thank you for your contributions to the eu scene and congratulations with your good performance at msi . 
  what the fuck lol, 
  piecepigeon is n't a part of that group though . 
  here you go mate : http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/3380qo/league_youtubers_vs_standards_brofresco_censor/,

  you seem like do n't know what you are talking about . 
  level 2 powerspike let 's go baby !, 
  did they win ? 
  i really should start to level up a smurf acc ... 
  you are naive . 
  and eu do n't surrender , kr surrender easily if they 're behind . 
  yes . 
  ah that endless homeguard visual bug ... 
  and everytime she uses the dash while teemo is running towards her so the placements becomes awkward . 
  well as long as * making a digital character look slightly different for one game * makes someone happy then it 's worth . 
  building hourglass is of course fine but being forced to build it as the first item is bullshit . 
  yep , they were more like q-r-e-r-q-e-r ( also known as smashing the keyboard ) because r was a targeted dash ability with a targeted skill ( q ) with a self-centered aoe ability ( e ) which makes akali a stupid ass champion . 
  because she is easy and rewarding in lower leagues and they have the excuse as `` just get a pink ward mate '' . 
  for some reason i feel like this whole thing is made by mods to make us feel like `` we are nothing without mods '' . 
   they 're not intruding, 
  just wondering , uhh , why are they deleting [ meta ] posts ? 
  yep . 
  keep deleting meta posts and you damn sure are open to suggestions via meta posts .
