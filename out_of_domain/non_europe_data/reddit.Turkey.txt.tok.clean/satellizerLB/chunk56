  maybe the reason for this is to deny the genocide , i do n't know . 
  what i do know is he was a well known person at that time and a close friend of ataturk before they went to their seperate ways and became rivals . 
   it is widespread in turkey to believe that turks are special , not like others . 
  a `` glorious '' nation could not commit genocide and get rich from it , right ? 
  unfortunately , yes . 
  and this exact belief is what keeps us behind . 
  we have a long and rich history but this belief made turks dumb over the time in my opinion . 
  it 's so beatiful ; _ ;, 
  he is not a smart man . 
  i hate erdogan too . 
  as i said before he just states everyone except his supporters as traitor , liars and whatever else . 
  and this is the reason why he gets many votes . 
  it 's like he is showcasing the flaws of democracy . 
  actually before erdogan , no one was caring about a person 's nationality . 
  iirc main director of eurovision 2004 istanbul was an armenian , before that we had many ministers who are n't turk and some of them being armenian . 
  but erdogan gets vote with polarizing people and unfortunately armenians are a victim of this . 
  i just ca n't fucking believe how he still gets love from people here . 
  it 's not like everyone here hates armenians though , most of the educated people do n't hate you since even if they do n't accept the genocide they at least capable of seperating their hatred for a government and a nation . 
  uneducated people or some nationalist people are hating armenians though . 
  erdogan gets vote mainly from them so he sometimes uses that hatred . 
  i usually max q to harass since it 's medium-long range targeted ability . 
  harassing with w is n't as reliable as harassing with q. 
  yeah , w is better for 2v2 fights but i usually ca n't use it max range since i 'm not a annie main so q seems more reliable to me . 
  different people , different playstyles i think . 
  you made me remember the terror of renekton . 
  that ending ; _ ;, 
  finally someone who thinks like me ... 
  : ^ ) ftw !, 
  no worries we have / u/tweetsincommentsbot, 
  34.48 fantasy points ... not bad for a support player :\\ ^ ), 
  do n't get me wrong but from an outsider 's view what you typed looked like some words and some random letters . 
  according to google translate `` puszika sr\u00e1cok '' = `` puszika adamlar/herifler '' in turkish so it 's `` puszika men/guys '' in english . 
  i imagine `` puszika '' means `` pussy/cunt '' so yeah i 'm glad you are chat restricted . 
  at first i thought it was a rumble using his ulti . 
  i was wondering why he drew rumble mid . 
  you mean the times when i/many current elements fans started to follow e-sports and became a fan of them ... 
  that meme is n't dank enough anymore mate , you have to follow the most dank memes or you 'll get downvoted . 
  in another words , classic reddit . 
  that 's the point i was trying to make but my english is n't smooth enough i think . 
  and i was expecting downvotes for me too how strange ... 
  i think this is a nerf to ap malph and keane played ap malph . 
  edit : oh shit i thought they changed his e. 
  yeah it 's almost like we watched the same video . 
  why the fuck do people downvote this comment ? 
  i have froggen , promisq and tabzz in my fantasy team . 
  no wonder why my team is named `` we tilt '', 
  what about `` my dick hurts '' ? 
  it always seems weird to me since ionia is actually in turkey . 
  ionian people were n't turk obviously it was before turks came to anatolia but champions like pantheon could be from ionia as a reference maybe . 
  edit : now that i think about it midas name from the hand of midas item is a reference to the real ionia i think . 
  midas is the name of an ionian king ( [ lydian ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lydia ) to be exact ) . 
  this is funny , yes , but there is a subreddit for these things / r/leagueofmemes, 
  well he is getting banned pretty often in dia5-3 mmr here . 
  mostly by the people who saw what a w-max ryze can do , others also see it and start to ban so he will be a permaban soon i assume . 
  and cabochard it seems . 
  i could n't watch the actual game just talking by the game result and individual scores . 
  seems balanced to me . 
   why ? 
  it 's easy to take screenshots and usually people just use the direct link . 
  i think if eu were to take us in before erdogan , erdogan would never rule this country . 
  he was using this situation something like `` they did n't get us in so we should turn back to our roots , ottoman , religion . '', 
  i simplified it but you got the idea . 
  when i saw new flairs i thought you forgot about the new elements flairs . 
  all right then , thanks for the answer . 
  is that a zac skin ? 
  is this the real life ? 
  nickname checks out . 
  or tristana ? 
  that 's why he said `` according to lolskill.net '' to let you decide for yourself . 
  he was at like % 39 win rate on release and getting banned to prevent teammates playing him in solo q. 
  how is this `` fucking broken '' ? 
   true support, 
   purple link, 
  `` oh yesterday i was n't even online ... come on . '', 
  all these fantasy points hjarnan i love u !, 
  i want tropical tower wars , legion td , castle fight , uther party and probably any other non-dota maps to be made for dota 2 !, 
  uther part , poke the angry ogre , are you a lucker, 
  that 's called an `` upset '' and every upset , not only tsm , gets highly upvoted here . 
  not really . 
  i could n't watch alliance vs kabum and when i saw the thread with 5000 upvotes i was already certain that kabum won before i even watch the game . 
  for me , duty = / = compensation, 
  or both !, 
  i think every stun and poison should also have different animations for the sake of ... 
  wait for it ... ** clarity **, 
  it 's hard to understand rito sometimes . 
  meme per minute is too low . 
  please raise it or we will shut / r/lol down . 
  sincerely , reddit \u2122 administration . 
   rengar flair, 
   says akali players are trash . 
  all right then . 
  stay strong my friend . 
  i do n't like when someone types things and say `` can confirm , i main him/her '' . 
  like people need to main someone to has some knowledge about him . 
  that 's why it 's called `` fun fact '', 
  in turkey , there are brothels in control of the government and they 're legal ( also cheaper ) . 
  anything except that is illegal but still there are many prostitutes . 
  i 'm not your friend , dude, 
  pretty much every chat program works better than skype for gamers . 
  uses more ram than others , stupid popups , stupid add-ons , really slow start-up compared to others .
