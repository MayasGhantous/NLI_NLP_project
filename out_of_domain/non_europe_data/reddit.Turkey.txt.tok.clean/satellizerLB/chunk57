  and than there is ddos thing . 
  it 's good for video calls but skype is n't for gaming . 
  #holy shit !, 
  here i am . 
  after having a break from dota for lol for 3 years , i 'm finally back to my roots . 
  well not like my roots but i think dota 2 will become much better with these custom games . 
  so yeah fuck league . 
  i was expecting that guy who wipes his tears with green green dollars from zombieland movie . 
  so dissappointed . 
  and tabzz got kicked not because of his performance but his behaviour . 
  and i 'd say tabzz proved he was/is better for alliance/elements since alliance line-up with tabzz was the best in europe meanwhile alliance line-up with rekkles barely avoided relegations . 
  sad thing is froggen actually was good in the first games of spring split . 
  i remember he solo carried a game against uol with kassadin against poe 's syndra just when people started to say `` poe  froggen '' that performance was almost like a reply to them . 
  currently poe  froggen . 
  but that match was beatifully played by froggen and he could n't keep that performance . 
  dota is different from lol . 
  saying dota is terrible because it 's different is bullshit . 
  you do n't like it , it 's okay , but that does n't mean `` lol beats dota in gameplay '' . 
  finally a team for me to support in na . 
  reggae & ska dude , somehow they make me happier . 
  cloud 9th ? 
  that 's the elements way , giving up on everything and gaining nothing from it . 
  alliance lost their elements . 
  i do n't think this was all he got but more like he is karma whoring which is backfired . 
  it 's ramadan month at the moment which is the holy month for all muslims and uploader of this video is a turkish guy . 
  let the western people to decide what a person can put in any video . 
  no fuckin idea actually . 
  i 'm not even a muslim myself , just wanted to give an idea about that outro . 
  i mean that was a sarcastic reply to a racist comment which is deleted after my reply . 
  whatever , actually people like you are the worst , without any context blaming people for something they actually did n't . 
  it 's ramadan ( i think it should be 4th of the 30 day tomorrow ) but i do n't know why he put a loud techno music for that part . 
  we got used to that feeling as the elements fans dude , it wo n't hurt after a while . 
  you will start to get used to them losing always and when they win it 'll make you happier than their glorius times even if that win is against the worst team . 
  nani sore , this is so anime-like . 
  i cared about the lore in every game i 've played so far , even in dota which was a made-up lore consists warcraft lore , norse mythology etc. 
  i mean i like learning more things about the game i play or the movie/anime/tv series i watch or the book i read . 
  but league lore sucks . 
  it 's not consistent , it 's not original , it 's not in-depth , it 's almost like they just shape it however they like and this leaves no reason for me to care about the lore . 
  uhh ... that 's great i guess ? 
  well , japanese nation is n't different from us on this matter and they do n't seem like falling at all . 
  i do n't know much about their empire times though . 
  i think you 're right but damn you sound so salty for no reason . 
  circlejerk is too strong with this one . 
  nyph was n't shining but he was n't * that * bad . 
  yes . 
  nyph & tabzz was a really good combo and i hope they can prove this once again . 
  having 1 winning lane can change elements ' game plan completely so i think this bench will benefit elements . 
  `` he was n't * that * bad '' = `` he was good enough for lcs '' which was the point of the comment i replied to . 
  not really . 
  ouch . 
  at first i thought corki q consumed the spell shield and varus r hit her after that but after watching for the 2nd time i realized that corki q did n't even hit her . 
  definitely a bug . 
  weird thing is damage part was blocked and she actually got mana back . 
  `` i just saw a dyrus comment omg have my babies '', 
  that 's the spirit !, 
  too late ... 
  futanari was the best . 
  was n't as bad as i expected . 
  what the fuck ... 
  yes . 
  casters are rioters after all and their job is to provide enjoyment for us to attract more viewers . 
  it 's not like they 're lawyers they do n't need to be unbiased at all . 
  `` oh my god tsm sucks balls what a shitshow from both teams '' would n't provide any enjoyment to na fans . 
  that being said , i think hyping a region more than they deserve can backfire as we saw with with eu in s4wc and na in msi . 
  i do n't know . 
  roccat is really unconsistent but when they play , they play really well . 
  same with uol . 
  at least they do n't get away with sloppy wins . 
  oh i meant lawyer not as the guy who tries to win cases ( avukat/advocaat ) but the guy who works with laws ( hukuk\u00e7u in turkish ) . 
  i do n't know what 's the word for it in english and google translate is not helping either :(, 
  judge would be `` j\u00fcri '' in turkish not hukuk\u00e7u but anyways you got the idea ^ ^, 
  battlecast prime cho ` gath of course . 
  r does n't explode , q is harder to see , aas just suck . 
  yep . 
  nah , freezing completely sucks but it was my first anime . 
  some people like it 's manga though . 
  it 's pretty much a copied heroes of the storm client . 
  h2k flair looks so weird with you . 
  how are you always awesome ? 
  for the watch !, 
  as a long time clg.eu / eg/all/el fan , i wish c9 the best . 
  i know your feels, 
  1 year is huge . 
  alliance was the hope of eu and 6 months later they were about to get relegated . 
  it 's only natural since bjergsen , dyrus and lustboy are immune to criticism . 
  wildturtle is funny and cute so that leave only amazing to be the scapegoat for the team . 
  that volibear game did n't help either . 
  he was actually really good , better than santorin as we saw in msi . 
  i think we all saw how he plays versus ssw . 
  dandy was the king of junglers at that time and amazing managed to hold his own against him in 2 games . 
  not to be a fan of amazing , i just think that every tsm loss was n't his fault as opposed to reddit hivemind of that time . 
  ** 2014 spring : ** no coach , alliance unconsistent , still they were n't so bad since they were hungry and talented players and meta was in their favor . 
  they needed a guidance the most . 
  ** 2014 summer : ** leviathan coach , alliance dominated europe in a fancy way making a few teams surrender against them , looked good at worlds including a perfect game against 3rd seed korean team and a satisfying victory over c9 but got eliminated cause of their unprofessionalism . 
  ** 2015 spring : ** no coach , elements sucked balls avoiding relegations . 
  meta was n't in their favor , team atmosphere sucked , rekkles tilted whole season , froggen carryed some games in the beginning then he also tilted , wickd & nyph & shook underperformed . 
  these problems could be solved with a coach . 
  ** 2015 summer : ** no coach , elements still sucking balls not sure if they can avoid relegations this time . 
  everyone underperforms , still there are some big problems unsolved ever since worlds . 
  not sure what they 're gon na do but things are looking bad this time .
