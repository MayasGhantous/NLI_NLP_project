  not sure if olcay is rocking or sucking . 
  it 's like every player from besiktas played amazing except tolga and he single handedly destroyed everything for us . 
  i 'm so salty . 
  so u.s. comes for freedom and owns iraq instead ? 
  that 's cool . 
  not really ... froggen got the minion advantage at the early game with 36-26 at one point , so faker had to pressure froggen to make him miss cs . 
  it 's not like froggen pussied out and only farmed . 
  chat always notices . 
  that 's probably the reason why faker had to flash defensively ** twice ** after 3mins . 
  they do n't look alike . 
  now i feel like a retard ... 
  i think it 's because vision was still too overpowering . 
  i like it better this way . 
   froggen ~ ~ at all-stars ~ ~ is always amazing . 
  umm ... 
  they already made the first move and russia has 1 less su-24 since then . 
  no one argued if it was brave or not ( i think it was actually pretty brave though since no other country did n't engage on russian jets even when they violated their air space ) . 
  i merely stated turkey ** already ** made the first move as a reply to the earlier comment . 
  if nato does n't give a fuck , yes , you are right . 
  russia would obliterate turkey if they commit a total war . 
  but if they do such a thing , they also lose because their economy is already shaking and they would lose every economic advance they had in the past 15-20 years . 
  if nato gives a fuck , turkey wins . 
  nato would help turkey both fund and military-wise and they would impose sanctions against russia ... 
  which means in a prolonged war turkey would win with the help of nato . 
  no one argued if russia made a move or not . 
  i merely stated turkey ** already ** made the first move as a reply to the earlier comment . 
  i get it dude . 
  i really do . 
  please go away and have your retarded `` poor turkey , russia will #rekt you '' arguement with someone else . 
  or maybe they just informed nato since they are a member country ? 
  i think we said the same thing with different ways and words ... 
  i used to think riot 's balance team was plainly bad . 
  then i saw what happened to cs : go with revolver r8 ... 
  yes . 
  and even if they win convincingly they would get practically nothing in return because they ca n't simply control turkey after invading them because the turks are probably one of the most nationalist nations in the world , sometimes racist , not to mention nato would n't let russia to control bosphorus . 
  itt salty redditors trying to mock shook for talking real, 
  logic ? 
  please . 
  this is reddit . 
   they just are n't the same for me anymore . 
  well they 're reworked for a reason ... 
  what do you think they do ? 
  that reaction though . 
   then they all go to other teams and the org crashes and burns, 
  well that went south so fast . 
  nah i also do n't think that elements will be succesful this split , after they screwed everything good with alliance . 
  they could n't even keep them good let alone making a solo q team lcs worth lol . 
  i 'm just waiting for froggen to announce his new team so i can switch my flair . 
  written ? 
  yes . 
  accurate ? 
  fuck no . 
  i do n't know ... rvp 's question to depay is n't really ethic but depay seemed like the bigger douchebag to me . 
  i mean fenerbah\u00e7e is n't the place where big boys play but rvp accomplished far more than depay so it 's a bit foolish of depay to answer like that . 
  he could give a non-retarded response though . 
  what ? 
  you say that you like simple mechanics like braum 's wall and poppy 's w but you do n't like ekko 's chronobreak or bard 's journey . 
  feels like you are just picking some abilities that you like and use them for your argument . 
  you may be on to something but for the moment this is total bullshit . 
   polish people always say the most disgusting nationalist things on chat, 
  i do n't know man , turks or russians are n't any better if we are to generalize them . 
   also people in master / challenger have huge ego 's so we do n't like to say that other people are better than us . 
  do n't know about you but v eren v is a really cool dude and he is also in master tier . 
  he is the best man , my favourite player this year . 
  indeed !, 
  yeah . 
  let 's nerf her more so she becomes up . 
  madred 's bloodrazor :'(, 
  i just let out a loud laughter thanks to you . 
  i did n't know this ... and i used ritalin for 2 months before i started to use concerta . 
  i was wondering why my erection lasts shorter than before . 
  all right . 
  an illegal hacker group hacks government and civilian websites of a country and reddit celebrates this . 
  then you wonder why turkish people vote for erdogan or why they hate western people . 
  it 's the hypocrisy . 
  agreed . 
  we have nothing against kurdish people . 
  we even have kurdish ministers right now i do n't get how can someone say `` turkey hates every kurd '' after doing a little bit of research . 
  but pkk will go down . 
  new patch did n't even rolled out and you make assumptions like that and present them as the truth . 
  come on , at least wait for a week to whine . 
  galvenize is a really cool dude . 
  1,5-2 years ago i tried to map classic osu !, 
  for the first time ( i only made a few gd taiko 's before that ) . 
  i almost finished mapping then i uploaded it and of course no one commented because it was horrible . 
  not on a shit map category but it was more like a mess . 
  i showed the map to my friends some liked it , some with better mapping knowledges said `` it 's bad , start with a new map '' without saying any helpful thing like `` hey try to use ctrl-shift-r to rotate '' etc. 
  then i sent the map to a few well known mappers like saten , fycho , natsu and none of them answered back . 
  except for galvenize . 
  he answered back , taught me a few thing and encouraged me with saying something like `` you know , the map seems cool but you need to work on this and that . 
  i recommend you to start over but its up to you . '', 
  it was awesome because i was about to completely give up on mapping and just because galvenize did something that others did n't , i did n't give up . 
  lol, 
  well the thing is many people wo n't even read the comments here , they 'll just read the title and move on . 
  not that it will make erdogan look any worse here since the anti-turkey circlejerk does it 's job pretty well though . 
  iirc it was also a thing in / r/gaming so probably some people did n't upvote twice if they already upvoted the post at / r/gaming, 
   russia might be feeling the burn but not from these sanctions so i do n't really get what your comment is contributing to the discussion . 
  turkey might be feeling the burn but not from these sanctions so i do n't really get what your comment is contributing to the discussion . 
  it would be great if you make it more clear with more evidences please because you only said `` turkey got rekt '' with a fancy way , nothing more . 
  oh , and please explain it so i can understand why russia is invulnerable to these double-edged sanctions while turkey is destined to fall apart and burn , thanks .
