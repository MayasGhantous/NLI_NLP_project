  unless walls apply some kind of knock-up/knock-back it 's a bug . 
  that 's normal though . 
   also , you are n't supposed to end up in walls , so do n't they apply a sort of knock-back ( obviously not the same thing as one for a yasuo ult ) to get you out of the wall ? 
  as you said , if they apply some kind of knockback yasuo should be able to ult so we know that it 's not a knockback . 
  and without a knockback lee sin q is supposed to deal damage . 
  if it does n't , it 's a bug . 
  there might be some logic behind the bug but it does n't change the fact that lee sin q skill did n't work as intended . 
   tell that to the hdp . 
  uhmm , i think we 're on the same point . 
  yes , if lee sin interrupts his dash on purpose it does n't deal damage . 
  maybe that 's the logic behind this bug i do n't know . 
  what seemed possible to me is that when mf was inside the wall lee hit him but since there was n't any room game blocked his q without registering the damage . 
   since the removed mana potions almost all mana champs received increased base mana regen and lowered mana costs . 
  heh , tell that to galio . 
  not everyone follows lck , lpl or worlds so a big portion of the player base might not even heard about mata even though he won the worlds but everyone knows about madlife even though he did n't win the worlds but named a play after himself . 
  just like insec . 
  that video is the reason why i still have a burning hatred for rivaldo as a turkish . 
  i knew it !, 
  i knew that they were going to something horrible after announcing all those good things ... 
  oh it 's this post again ... 
  now there is one more reason why i carry this flair . 
  its just ayran, 
  its just ayran, 
  not sure if he is the best or worst dad ever . 
  yes . 
  i think he does n't communicate with the team when he picks nasus mid and this is a reportable offense . 
  exactly . 
   and obviously lack of cc, 
  this is why i never liked having a top lane nidalee on my team . 
  sometimes it would work but when it did n't work , she would become a burden to carry . 
  and how is that hidden if it 's documented in the patch notes ? 
  yes . 
  i 've had almost no problem with jhin being meta . 
  he has clear weaknesses and strengths which is a good champion design overall . 
  only change i want for him is that his 4th shot to be a bit tuned down with his other ammos a bit buffed . 
  that way he ca n't one shot people and he would n't lose damage overall . 
   stupidly strong, 
  lol no . 
  # *** fire at will ***, 
  damn you are a god . 
  coming through !, 
  thank you . 
  hah he needs more tear tattoos . 
   nobody cares how good champ select looks . 
  i care . 
   i 'm using `` first world country '' term wrong and i will keep using it wrong . 
  ftfy, 
  graves . 
  new one is n't bad actually but i miss old graves . 
  caps ? 
  you mean that former dp mid laner ? 
  you should 've put an op.gg link too . 
  he was being considered as one of the best wingers in turkey but we do n't have an intense competition on that position . 
  he was consistently good under bilic but he was inconsistent and usually poor last year under \u015eenol g\u00fcne\u015f , that 's why he wanted to leave for west ham to play under bilic again . 
  aboubakar 's card is deserved , the foul before that is not . 
  beck red card is a total joke . 
  i mean he tripped because other guy pushed him . 
  not saying pushing beck was a foul but calling a foul for dynamo kiev because a player of them pushed beck and made him trip not to mention it 's a penalty & red card ... 
  whatever you say , it does n't seem just to me . 
  he left the best one out though : https://youtu.be/otkwmpiwqau?t=22s, 
  and this one : https://youtu.be/qbevbqazq6g?t=52s, 
  it 's our job to make them give a fuck though . 
  if you do n't care as a supporter how can you expect a player to care ? 
  he 's just shitting . 
  here is an example of how to remain silent by be\u015fikta\u015f fans : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cgwwmoo9x8, 
  the crowd sounds from behind are from benfica fans , they were made aware of the silent chant but they did n't go with it . 
  edit : the silent chant was to raise awareness for the hearing impaired people . 
  agreed ban them all . 
  that olaf build though . 
  i think that 's the point . 
  people want him to go out of his character sometimes . 
  [ this happened ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgxsuykgu2u ), 
  let me load the page you fucks, 
  same with me . 
  i 'm an atheist living in turkey and i 'm still celebrating ramadan and sacrifice festivals because it feels normal . 
  i mean i do n't fast in ramadan , i do n't support the sacrifices in sacrifice festival , but i celebrate other people 's festivals . 
  if i was in a christian majority country i 'd celebrate christmas etc. 
  as well since i 'd be a part of that culture .

  sorry for the abomination in the title , it 's my first time here . 
  i think it was more about psg not taking risks anymore with attacking . 
  what ? 
  so if you stick your leg to another player 's leg while he is kicking the ball without looking at you it should be a foul ? 
  he fucks up the simplest taps yet he sometimes scores some beatiful goals . 
  it 's like he is the complete opposite of a one-tap striker . 
  grandfather : blonde hair , bright blue eyes,

  uncle : black hair , green eyes, 
  aunt : brown hair , blue eyes, 
  mom : brown hair , hazel eyes, 
  me : black hair , dark brown eyes, 
  side note : i live in turkey so it 's much more rare to be a natural blonde or colored-eyed here compared to the west . 
  almost the same with typhoon . 
  a shorter `` phoon '' and you 're good !, 
  you realize that the * racist club * you 're talking about has multiple turkish players in their starting 11 , right ? 
   the point was that it is not fair for the other teams that do n't have the same ( $ $ $ ) chance of getting superstar players in the middle of the season, 
  uhmmm ... money exists and it exists for a reason . 
  but even then money is n't everything as leicester city proved once more last year . 
   turkey would 've been a fantastic place to hold the euros if it was n't for erdogan and his brown shirts .
