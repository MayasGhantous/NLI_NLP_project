  this . 
  i 'd like us to host a euro but at the same time i would n't like to . 
  it 's called sirtaki in turkish and yeah it 's a greek music . 
  maybe you call it differently . 
  lately he was n't as good as he was in the first half of the season but he still is good apparently . 
  we managed to come back from 3-0 to 3-3 against benfica thanks to him . 
  yea , be\u015fikta\u015f is the highest level for him . 
  i ca n't see him going to bigger clubs either . 
  you do n't like erdo\u011fan , we do n't like erdo\u011fan so i do n't see any weirdness in this . 
  match was telecasted in trt ( bbc of turkey , heavily pro-erdo\u011fan ) . 
  turkish commentator made positive comments about the crowd whole game except when they sang [ izmir march ] ( https://youtu.be/ozu1oouhjom?t=10s ) ( a nationalist march , pro-kemalist , became kind of a symbol for no voters in the upcoming referandum ) . 
  he just spoke out of his mind nervously , calling every player 's name who touched the ball etc. 
  to not to let viewers hear the march clearly . 
  so fuck him too . 
  fuck him . 
  i demand a fine or something at least . 
  fenerbah\u00e7e and galatasaray only support be\u015fikta\u015f in europe , not each other . 
  some of them do n't even count us as a real rival . 
  to put it as an analogy , if fenerbah\u00e7e and galatasaray was to be real madrid and barcelona , be\u015fikta\u015f would be atletico madrid . 
  except german-turks . 
  but some of them choose german national team lately like emre can , \u0130lkay g\u00fcndo\u011fan , mesut \u00d6zil , levin \u00d6ztunal\u0131 . 
  seeing commentator getting nervous over it . 
  that does n't change anything , they have the turkish nationality as well as german one . 
  they get to choose and they choose german national team . 
  i 'm not judging , maybe i 'd do the same if i had a solid chance to make it into the starting eleven of the german team . 
  this is how we went out of europe league in 2014/2015 season : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g75gxto4hqy, 
  and this is how we went out of europe league in 2015/2016 season : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxmle_11oxq, 
  we totally know how you feel dude . 
   except for osmanl\u0131spor for political reasons . 
  and ba\u015fak\u015fehir . 
  i support every other team in the europe but not these 2 because erdo\u011fan . 
   why the fuck did the ref let him take the spray ? 
  no idea . 
  it 's probably on the same category as taking off the shirts since referee gave him a yellow card afterwards . 
   oh , and that keeper is garbage . 
  the notorious tolga zengin . 
  dude was a complete joke yet bilic and \u015eenol g\u00fcne\u015f kept playing him for some whatever reason before fabri took over . 
   now they think that they are the sinners for having not done a job proper as a parent . 
  i think they did their job properly since you managed to think for yourself and escape islam . 
  i went through a similar path but mine was a lot easier than yours . 
  good luck . 
  2 days, 
  do n't believe in your luck , believe in yourself who believes in your luck !, 
  even greater in turkish . 
  `` ba\u015f '' means `` head , top , main '' and `` dost '' means '' ( lifelong ) friend '' . 
  so together it means `` top friend '' or `` main friend '' . 
  `` kek '' means `` cake '' and `` top '' means `` ball , cannon '' in turkish . 
  `` meme '' means `` boobie '' . 
  truly international mate . 
  what 's `` power bottom '' even in english ? 
  well , uhm , that was enlightening . 
  as far as i know we just call them `` pasif '' as they 're the receiving end and we call `` aktif '' the giving part . 
  but i 'm not sure if this is the right word for it . 
  i might ask a gay friend of mine if you wish so . 
  gladiator ost ... 
  damn . 
  / r/eyebleach, 
  like ? 
  what do you mean with * like * ? 
  most male be\u015fikta\u015f fans would suck his bbc and i ca n't even guess what the females would do . 
  anyways . 
  not only us but almost every football fan here like atiba . 
  he is a good player and most importantly he has an example character . 
  i still remember that he played for us 2 days after he played for canada . 
  thousands of kilometers in a day , then training , then playing 90mins and putting everything you have on the pitch . 
  it 's impossible not to like him . 
  ! remindme 5 years, 
  ! remindme 5 years, 
  seems good to me . 
  not to justify what they did but i think we all know that there were some serious provocation . 
  \u00c7ar\u015f\u0131 is pretty hot headed but they 're not completely retarded . 
  they would n't do this without a serious provocation . 
  much better than my expectations . 
  your attacking line on the other hand seems pretty shaky . 
  marcelo wo n't be available in \u0130stanbul . 
  our defense has always been shaky without him so do n't lose your hope . 
  that 's how we write the pronunciation of offside and that 's word we have for it . 
  so yeah you 're correct . 
  i 'm dead . 
  i still love him but damn . 
  that was some tolga level fuck up . 
  warriors of the night , assemble !, 
  same . 
  fuck my life . 
  i ca n't even blame anyone but still it hurts . 
  i 'm studying translation and interpretation at college , and it 's amazing that you are actually downvoted for stating that . 
  reddit in a nutshell . 
  that aside , this game was actually fun to watch . 
  i thought i was witnessing a comeback when nappon stole the baron for the 2nd time but then dw just outrotated and outmacrod them . 
  very intense match though . 
  mana stacking taric was much better for a while before they nerfed and reworked him . 
  and tropical tower wars . 
  and line tower wars . 
  and legion td . 
  needs more executions . 
  `` strong competitor ... but only a competitor '', 
  that 's the best thing i 've heard today !, 
  70m is also bigger than every european country except germany , russia and turkey ( if you count ) . 
  no , he 's not kidding : http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/uk-population/, 
  i think you mean strategic dispute .
