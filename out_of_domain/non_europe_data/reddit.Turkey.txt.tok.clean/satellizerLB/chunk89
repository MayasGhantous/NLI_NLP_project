  but i agree that ck series is more suited for a game of thrones game . 
  lmao great shit . 
  you are n't afraid of getting flamed . 
  or you enjoy the possibility of getting flamed because it pushes you to be better . 
   come to besiktas !, 
  ( and get stabbed ), 
  correct version is `` come to be\u015fikta\u015f and get the opportunity to play with knives in the pitch '', 
  jokes aside this is fucked up . 
  same dude . 
  same . 
  never forget ... 
  how did you get those icons ? 
  i bought star guardian lux as soon as it was available but i do n't have these icons . 
  yeah , well , spotify . 
  i know you never heard of this one before but it 's actually really cool !, 
  i thought you got it with the skin since both are about star guardian lux skin . 
  just wanted to say that i love the drums you did in this album . 
  especially the bloodthirster and tear of the goddess , so the hard effort you guys put into that song is kinda worth after all . 
  first of all , i 'm not a us resident so maybe you 're more a subject to the magazines there . 
  but , from another country you look like you do n't care about the paparazzis or magazines and yet you 're actually quite famous . 
  that 's quite impressive in my opinion . 
  many actors deliberately try to stay as a hot topic . 
  that 's what i like about you . 
  so here 's the question : do you actually try to dodge paparazzis or you do n't care about them at all ? 
  how do you handle that uncomfortable side of fame ? 
  sorry if this is a private subject , i was n't sure to ask this actually . 
  it seemed a bit private , or uncomfortable to answer :d, 
  if you like shounen animes , go for it . 
  i believe it 's a really good anime for shounen fans . 
  but if you do n't like shounen , do n't even bother . 
  i finished the series , because i did n't have the internet at that time and i had that anime on my laptop . 
  but it was decent at best , i 'm not the biggest shounen fan after all . 
  are you sure ? 
  i think colorblind people are actually blind and colorblindness thing is a big conspiracy . 
  i mean have ever become colorblind ? 
  yeah , me neither . 
  til i was actually colorblind . 
  yeah , well , that was the joke but seems like r/lol is far too sensitive to take jokes . 
  i hope lucescu brings him back . 
  it 's so retarded that we have one of the best dms in the bundesliga and one of the better dms in the europe but we still play ozan tufan , tiltmaster o\u011fuzhan and xel\u00e7uk the 90 \u00b0 maestro in his position . 
  i do n't know why but i always felt affinity to nuri . 
  it 's not because he 's a successful turkish player , there are dozens more of them . 
  but nuri seems like a geniune dude with a real desire to play football . 
  that vibe he gives off is something rare in my opinion . 
  he 's also the only player that i want to meet and have a tea . 
  my predictions :, 
  ** assassins . 
  ** i mean they already are in a pretty good spot but they 'll rule the mid lane next summer split . 
  ** kayle ** will become a very strong pick for mid again . 
  they 'll probably buff her healing or maybe her q can stack her passive twice . 
  they wo n't touch her damage because it 's already pretty high . 
  kayle will be strong due to these buffs and increasing assassin popularity as even now rito keeps nerfing control mages . 
  for jungle , i feel like diver junglers like ** vi ** will make a comeback . 
  by then zac will be nerfed into oblivion , j4 will also be nerfed as he sees play in both jungle and top lane . 
  other strong engage type of junglers like vi and even ** amumu ** will become popular mostly because of assassin meta . 
  for top lane , adc or support , i have no idea . 
  i 'd say protector supports like ** tahm kench ** or janna would be popular but janna seems like she 'll get nerfed soon and tahm kench is only a ban away from being a non-existent factor . 
  meta adcs will depend on meta supports , if diver supports or mage supports become popular then self-peeling adcs like ** ezreal ** , caitlyn or lucian will see more play . 
  top lane is already diverse , i do n't really know how will the top lane meta shape . 
  if these hold true , i 'm gon na announce when will donald trump step down . 
  feels turkey man . 
  now it is . 
  in my days , there was orb of frost to act as a recipe . 
  oh the 6 scepter obsidian harbinger terror ... 
  whenever i mention that silencer used to be able to summon a few infernals , my friends give me that look like i 'm going insane . 
  also that old naix with % 40 lifesteal , on-hit as/ms slow , self as/ms boost and avatar as ultimate . 
  all passive skills except his ultimate . 
  shit was op . 
  and rikimaru . 
  i mean death ward as a ultimate is so fucked up for a hero like riki . 
  and nami mains will spam e when it 's not necessary at all . 
  like what the fuck , they actually make me miss cs sometimes . 
  show them who 's the boss !, 
  aside from monaco , i have no idea which team will advance from our group . 
  and even for monaco , it 's not crystal clear since they 're about to sell their best player . 
  of course it 'll be imbalanced as fuck in the beginning . 
  but that 's the reason why they push out the new rune system in the off-season . 
  they 'll have a plenty of time to balance things . 
  also , i think that this move is a smart one . 
  masteries and runes together makes some champions hard to balance . 
  or they 're forced to make changes to their scalings to prevent people to have too much power just because of runes or masteries as happened with yasuo before they nerfed his q cd . 
  i want to think that the new runes will be well thought like the current keystone masteries so that some of them wo n't shadow the others like release thunderlord or courage of the colossus . 
  all in all , i expect good things . 
  i mean it seems weird to me that people actually like sugar daddy teams like chelsea or psg but they hate rb leipzig . 
  i mean i do n't get what 's wrong with this . 
  in the end every club is a business . 
  maybe my point of view is wrong dunno . 
  i want to use judgment kayle to show off how long i 've been playing this game but aether wing 's aa and q animations just wo n't let me . 
  also battlecast prime cho ` gath and foxfire ahri . 
  i know , foxfire ahri is just like classic ahri but for some reason i 'm only able to cs with foxfire ahri . 
  i 've played dota allstars since 2005 . 
  most of my friends were also playing it and i was actually good at it unlike other genres like fps or rts . 
  then dota 2 rumors started to spread , dota allstars updates got slower and slower , then dota 2 became official . 
  at one point dota allstars updates were so slow that icefrog was releasing a new patch once a year , the same meta whole year . 
  the game once the most fun game that ever existed was so boring for me at that time . 
  i played different heroes to keep it fresh but even though i played different heroes , the gameplay was the same , other heroes were the same . 
  i mean mid lane matchups were always one of these : sf , pudge , wr , ember spirit , balanar , akasha , necrolyte . 
  dota 2 was on closed beta at this time iirc . 
  i found a key , but the game was n't as fun as dota allstars . 
  and it had even less content , most heroes were there but some of them were n't and the meta game was exactly the same as dota allstars .
