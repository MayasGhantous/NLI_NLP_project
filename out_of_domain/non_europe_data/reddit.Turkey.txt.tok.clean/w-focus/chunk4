  check it maybe it suits you . 
  that 's why i ca n't agree people here to wait and see their move . 
  they may do something ; which we really dislike but again it will be too late to make any objections and we will only be able to come back here and swear all the time . 
  i 'm not sure if there will be some secular government anymore , you know their slogan `` en az \u00fc\u00e7 \u00e7ocuk '' . 
  i guess this is a harsh thought at the moment , we all know when it comes to defend `` vatan '' we are all same . 
  there are different things to criticize anyway but i wonder what you think about people who fought against enemy under atat\u00fcrk 's command , how modern turkish opposing people would label them ? 
  we do n't need to be afraid of our any type of citizens . 
  all we need to do :, 
  simply `` liyakat '' . 
  none of the soldiers should be part of any organization or cult , only the normal citizens who are willing to serve country . 
  we should canalize our hate to unsuccessful parties not their voters . 
  because voters usually ca n't see from other people 's perspectives . 
  and since we hate them , they do n't even care our perspective anymore . 
  well still it is `` ezan dinmez , bayrak inmez '' , 
  bayrak here is obviously red and white . 
  dude , seriously wtf ? 
  you 're talking total bullshit . 
  do you ever check soldiers ' families and their homes and their financial situation which lost their lives in east/southeast ? 
  where are they from mostly ? 
  which part of the nation they represent mostly ? 
  are n't they religious mostly ? 
  it 's even very common criticism that the '' \u015fehit '' concept is being used to cover mistakes when especially low rank turkish soldiers lose their lives and nobody questions if there were politicians ' mistakes . 
  and now you are saying to me religious people should not be in army ? 
  seriously ? 
  who the fuck will fight against enemies , you ? 
  stop this f.cking crap that trying to show regular turkish citizens like gulenists . 
  and stop talking about atat\u00fcrk 's principles as you do n't deserve to talk about it . 
  it says unconditionally , not saying non-religious . 
  you can criticize as not successful at governing , but whoever says they should not be in army should go to hakkari mountains and fight in their place . 
  you could explain like that at first . 
  but you wrote like regular citizens are also part of a cult and if they receive commands from someone they will not defend country but listen to their sultan . 
  dude , seriously i do n't believe this is reality . 
  you people are too much motivated to show religious turks like monsters , but this just does n't make any sense for me . 
  just try to go have some close friends from them , you may like some of them . 
  and about that sentence , apparently we focus on different parts :, 
  '' ** these people do n't have a place in the army , ** especially not on high ranking positions . 
  ok sorry for much anger from my side . 
  just i 'm too sensitive about soldiers who lost their lives while defending country . 
   the army inherents the principles of atat\u00fcrk . 
  ** a religious person ** does not feel like to protect these principles . 
  these people do n't have a place in the army ,, 
  that 's why, 
   and this resembles the soldiers who died defending their country to you ? 
  yes , indeed . 
  mostly poor families ' sons from central anatolia region who could n't succeed to go faculties so they are serving as long term soldiers . 
  and this is not about erdogan . 
  we should somehow manage to like each other , i do n't think it is that hard to do it . 
  there will always be differences . 
  they are majority , if we hate them we will be out of game . 
  and it 'd be a pity while we both insanely love our land and our flag . 
  not really , i do n't think you got the message . 
  it 's happening in a nato country . 
  i mean it is no need to be expert to understand what erdogan 's trying to do , right ? 
  100 % not chp or hdp, 
  erdogan is not trying to put some militants in any state 's critical positions , he does n't care what profession these people have those attending to this rally . 
  these shitty and nonsense diagnoses/comparisons being made by opposing people make me desperate if some opposing party ever will win an election . 
  we 're being governed by akp since 2002 and still most of criticism made by opposing people are bullshit while there are a lot of genuine things to criticise . 
  check [ other thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/turkey/comments/4vhjht/5_ekim_2015_tarihli_zaman_gazetesi_reklam%c4%b1/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link ) in subreddit, 
  why you compare with parallel state then ? 
  ok , let 's talk more calmly . 
  if erdogan making anything illegal european states will not let him at all . 
  what he 's doing here is obvious for me , there are very different opinions between him and rest of nato about especially future of syria . 
  he 's using civilians who following him to make his own wills happen . 
  still everything is legal . 
  your criticism does n't make sense . 
  also those who are saying turks should return turkey , obviously they 're not there only cause of they want but germany needs them as well . 
  i mean there are too many things to criticize about akp but not this civilian peaceful event . 
  i guess one thing i do n't think we will see is a european president/prime minister saying `` kandirildik '' about erdogan so i ca n't make much connections even though maybe you 're right . 
  i believe if he was in some shady things in europe , eu definitely would use that against him . 
  germany and turkey both nato member allies . 
  germany needs turks as manpower . 
  turkey and syria not allies . 
  turkey does n't need syrians . 
  situations are completely different and your comparison does n't really make any sense . 
  so why are they in germany ? 
  for fun ? 
  why they took in these `` trojan horses '' ? 
  for fun ? 
  dude , how old are you ? 
  do you have any idea how it started turks going germany ? 
  are you turkish ? 
  i can recommend documentaries . 
  search for almanya aci vatan and watch some of them explaining all from beginning . 
  this channel is for small info , much fun and sarcasm . 
  and usually small political messages like the last scene `` bizi \u00fczenin ... '', 
  they 're trying to prepare their supporters for more us interventions . 
  the message is clear , if there will be more shit in our country it 's cause of us and be ready when we call you from mosques . 
  us has said maybe thousand times to their face `` we do n't want erdogan . '', 
  it 's no surprise akp supporters are getting ready for the conspiracy theories , right ? 
  i think people who write cool and nice things like you have never been in some other cities of turkey except modern western cities . 
  turkey is not a classical european country and most likely it will never be . 
  each time a leader like erdogan comes and each time you are just crying `` whyyyy , oh god whyyyy :'( '' . 
  wake up your deep sleep and be aware of your country , especially go visit some eastern `` shitty '' cities for a real turkey experience , my friend . 
  then you will understand erdogan , although you still will not agree his style , neither i do . 
  when erdogan and gulen were friends , erdogan was also very good ally to us my friend . 
  erdogan was always antidemocratic in turkey , right ? 
  but what a surprise , he becomes a dictator only recently . 
  [ check this ] ( http://www.milliyet.com.tr/obama-erdogan-dostlugunun-sirri-/dunya/dunyadetay/09.12.2011/1473231/default.htm ) how much they like each other . 
  but now it is like [ that ] ( http://www.yenicaggazetesi.com.tr/erdogana-abdde-karsilama-rezaleti-134351h.htm ) . 
  i 'm not saying us is involved , just i 'm saying you 're expecting wrong type of support for your secularism love in turkey .
