  i do n't know anything about shanghai cooperation . 
  but about eu , it was always wrong to be a candidate . 
  if we had succeeded somehow , it would most likely end with a turexit something . 
  ( sovereignty unconditionally belongs to the nation ) '' we are also a country found after an empire , so people have much nationalist feelings . 
  but eu says : `` ok sovereignty mostly belongs to your nation but critical decisions are made by brussels . '', 
  turkey would be a second uk in eu as all the time bitching around . 
  in reality what we need is a top-level partnership with eu . 
  economical/political whatever , as much as possible . 
  and also good relations with other countries especially with russia . 
  but of course all these require talented politicians not only `` dik duru\u015f '' . 
  also eu/us should stop ignoring some essantial wills of turkish nation just like solidarity against terrorism . 
  dude , world is being governed by mostly idiots . 
  for almost all countries . 
  people need to be smarter than politicians . 
  because nowadays we ca n't see big men/women , instead there are populist reactive politicians . 
  ** edit : ** sometimes if you ca n't defend your arguments wisely cause you are busy with other things , discussion gets awkward if other dude is not helping as well . 
  the ones which lead uk to leave ( they were always unhappy anyway ) . 
  [ the ones ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/poland-refuses-to-take-a-single-refugee-because-of-security-fears-a7020076.html ) which poland say they will not obey at all . 
  the ones that make greece whining constantly ( ok it was mostly their fault for economy ) . 
  and so on . . 
  i can ~ ~ count ~ ~ find a lot , just the truth is turkey is not suitable for full membership . 
  osmanl\u0131 torunlar\u0131 do n't receive orders from other countries * openly , directly * . 
  what you think ? 
  is it possible ? 
  i 'd like to listen counter arguments . 
  i already counted the ones come to my mind instantly . 
  the other thing , turkey is something in the middle at power levels . 
  not a country to simply obey eu and just enjoy stable economy and lots of funds . 
  also not a country to be able to pass the decisions against wills of germany/france in brussels . 
  it 'd be total mess , i mean a real carnaval  i want to listen from you , how you will govern osmanl\u0131 torunlar\u0131 from brussels ? 
  it 's your turn . 
  edit : more calm answers to your arguments . 
   most of the stuff in the british press was bs ,, 
  during the brexit yes . 
  but not about what triggered this all : http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/nicolas-sarkozy-tells-david-cameron-to-shut-up-in-euro-clash-2375098.html, 
  someone shouts in your face `` shut up '' when you are sharp and they are tired of you . 
  who else is sharp ? 
  turkey . 
   the asylum thing is not set in stone, 
  yeah but what kind of `` trade union '' asks you to receive some refugees ? 
  it 's a real politic union . 
   and adopting the euro is not a must ( i 'm totally against adopting it ), 
  yeah of course it all happened because greece was in euro zone . 
  it happened because politicians were assholes . 
  first greeks then all . 
  guess who else have many asshole politicians ? 
  turkey . 
  my arguments were clear , if they did n't satisfy you there is nothing i can do . 
  `` it 's your turn . '', 
  was meaning if you do n't like my arguments then i want to listen yours . 
  why no evidence ? 
  it 's a political union before everything , so decisions should be made with common benefits which is quite hard . 
  so obviously some countries will need to make sacrifices . 
  not hard to predict which one will be the ones mostly sacrifice , right ? 
   and just to be clear : we already take orders from the echr . 
  it 's not same . 
  what i said was clear : osmanl\u0131 torunlar\u0131 do n't receive orders from other countries ** openly , directly . 
  really ? 
  you are also one of those to consider eu as just a trade union ? 
  [ these two countries ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/french%e2%80%93german_enmity ) thought why not to make a trade union , right ? 
  the eu exists to avoid european countries stopping each others ' economical growth by politic problems as it makes europe continent not compete globally . 
  and full economic cooperation of course . 
  i did n't dig myself at all . 
  you ca n't answer the scenario of ottoman grandsons being governed by a council in brussel , because it was what i meant with sovereignty mentality in turkey . 
  i see you are dedicated to prove me wrong . 
  but do n't look at the facts in this ambition . 
  i love eu but full membership is obviously not suitable for turkey . 
  every member government is aware of its political intensity , does n't matter how they promote to their voters . 
  `` ottoman grandsons '' represents mostly uneducated people who would fight for rights of eating kokore\u00e7 instead of basic european values . 
  i 'm not sure who is the one parroting here . 
  you do n't explain my quesitons but only talking as i 'm wrong . 
  please little bit explain the time turkey is a full member of eu . 
  obviously i ca n't imagine it and i have arguments for it . 
  but you 're a stranger on internet just saying i 'm wrong . 
  you do n't help dude . 
  who knows if you are professor , how old you are , how long you have been in europe , have you lived and worked there , have you been in nontouristic areas . 
  i ca n't easily know that and your attitude does n't really help . 
  it 's easy to say people go make more research , we always need to make more research anyways . 
  i 'm not an expert so it is quite normal i will say some `` bullshits '' from people on street , this does n't make it automatically wrong . 
  ottoman grandson is bullshit indeed , but the party who governs your country is in this mentality . 
  when i say it is bs to be full member of eu , in your opinion this is also bs . 
  because i ca n't understand you . 
  you do n't answer my questions . 
  how else i can know if you know better or not . 
  asking again , please , can you describe little bit the times turkey is a full member ? 
  and also it is not other extreme . 
  i 'm saying my arguments and they do n't satisfy you . 
  so i 'm asking for you to explain how it would n't be a sovereignty problem . 
  ok , sorry did n't get as it was the answer to that specific quesiton . 
  i 'm just saying my opinion now again : i do n't really think you will ever settle on . 
  because it is not really possible , as turks have this 100 % open and direct independence pride about sovereignty . 
  they do n't really care logical reasons and benefits also the paradox they create with this pride in modern world . 
  and the mentality of this type of voters is governing country and getting even stronger . 
  so in my opinion , most logical option would be a full partnership . 
  i respect your opinion as well , but this is my opinion .

   `` we are sick of you criticising us and telling us what to do , '' he was quoted as saying by eu officials , losing patience at what he perceived to be mr cameron 's hectoring from the single currency 's sidelines . 
  `` you say you hate the euro and now you want to interfere in our meetings . '', 
  not really . 
  i do n't think anyone see america that kind of enemy , except uneducated people .
