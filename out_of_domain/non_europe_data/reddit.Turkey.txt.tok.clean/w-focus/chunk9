  akp would obviously use the chance to label seculars as traitors . 
   did they forgive erdogan ? 
  no way . 
   are turkey 's chances of becoming secular completely fucked ? 
  mystery . 
  pessimistic indications . 
   could someone put me back in the loop and explain the aftermath of the coup ? 
  seculars do n't shout a lot at the moment because gulenists have committed a lot of crimes against seculars and other innocent people when they were buddies with erdogan . 
  so it is kinda payback time . 
  this is of course a sick mentality of justice but ... turkey , yeah . 
  average voter in every democracy i guess ? 
  it 's so hard for people to just say `` i do n't have much info on that , should be more details to whether support . '', 
  they 're not actually cheering on mob , for them more important thing is to see kurds do n't support pkk . 
  this makes them happy . 
  but i 'd like to add two things :, 
  akp/hdp follower , does n't matter , if someone destroying peace of praying especially on friday , most likely he will have same fate as the guy in the video . 
  they do n't really care what 's actual political opinions of the ones who mob the guy . 
  maybe they do n't like being called as kurds and it sounds discrimination for them . 
  or maybe they 're nationalist kurds who hate terror but still wants similar things to hdp just without any terror . 
  but it is just reddit anyways , who cares man . 
  do not question that much . 
  otherwise some genious users here will label you as being supporter of akp/fet \u00d6 / pkk/hdp/usa etc whatever they dislike . 
  just enjoy the happy moments while they do n't occur a lot thanks to our government . 
  it 's hard for me to get turkey 's position actually . 
  - turkey not ok with syria coming back to its original form under assad . 
  - russia not ok of taking down assad . 
  - usa not ok of losing pyd in region . 
  i mean it 's hard to see how it will end but it 's very hard to see what 's going on at the moment as well . 
  what will be turkey 's move ? 
  will support who ? 
  \u0218imdi , trt spor ya da https://youtu.be/semnwosetss, 
  southeast of turkey is really [ hot ] ( http://m.accuweather.com/en/tr/diyarbakir/317709/weather-forecast/317709 ) and it 's not comfortable indoor praying . 
  and on fridays usually mosques are too crowded anyway so there was no space probably . 
  there 's a term called `` friday muslim '' , which is used for people do n't pray 5 times a day but never missing friday prays . 
  so while these people also join , mosques are very crowded on fridays . 
  well turkey is officially secular but the present day turkey is something hard to define . 
  we usually call it a parallel universe . 
  so yes , basically we have a lot of problems but i do n't think this praying outside thing is one them . 
  it 's an example of how to express a valid opinion in a very shitty way . 
  translation is correct ( although shorter ) , the twitter guy is talking shitty by choosing wrong words . 
  imagine r/oldschoolcool 30 years later . . 
  autobahn is unofficial test track for germans and all neighbour countries ' rich people to experience their cars ' top speed . 
  but believe me you would n't like to break rules in germany , be careful about traffic signs . 
  it 's possible to have no speed limit thanks to germans ' high awareness and respect to rules in addition to engineering .

  you 're welcome , yeah i know that feeling . 
  also i think turkish songs can be much catchy  i have friends still singing very old tarkan songs . 
  thanks for your good words . 
  i 'd recommend you [ educatedear ] ( https://m.youtube.com/user/caparkapa ), 
  probably that 's why reposts are not extremely bad as new people will have chance to comment and very probably at least one different opinion will be top upvoted . 
  are you turkish ? 
  you can easily do on e-devlet website . 
  is that a random look or it 's trying to say us something ? 
  or just fuck touchscreen !!!, 
  old nokia is love . 
  is it something like [ that ] ( http://sebeder.org/images/icerik/yuzuklerin_efendisi___guc_yuzugu__sesli_betimleme_dernegi_191.jpg ) ? 
  i know [ someone ] ( http://i.huffpost.com/gen/3735830/images/o-gollum-facebook.jpg ) looking for it desperately . 
  tbh most people in turkey blame only gulenists not cause of erdogan says so . 
  they believe if there was an alliance between kemalists and gulenists , the coup most likely would happen more professionally and successfully . 
  also kemalists would n't be friends with gulenists . 
  so i do n't believe americans can convince turks to blame kemalists . 
  ** filter out ** dominant topics, 
  i ca n't eat the apple . 
  ge\u00e7enlerde biri daha [ benzer bir konu ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/turkey/comments/51e1es/where_to_buy_books_from_tolkien_in_english_in/ ) a\u00e7m\u0131\u015ft\u0131 , oradaki cevaplar sorunu \u00e7\u00f6zm\u00fc\u015ft\u00fc san\u0131rsam . 
   i 'll be a call away like all of our pilots returning to the turaf after the coup purges . 
  tbh i 'm not so sure what mods can do about these issues or what exactly you are expecting to hear from them . 
  according to my observations , many users coming here for simply bithcing around . 
  because the condition of our country actully hurting everyone independent to their opinions . 
  main aim of people is unfortunately not sharing opinions or exchanging ideas , knowledge , perspective etc. 
  we 're a nervous country and most of us are simply not happy . 
  we have a lot of things to say but we are very tired of listening . 
  also our friends and relatives are as well , people usually do n't want to listen . 
  they are tired , desperate or not interested . 
  many do n't follow news as well . 
  but we do and get more frustrated each time . 
  - one group coming here to blame islam for every bad thing happening in country even in world . 
  whatever you do , it will not change how angry and sad they 're about that the country is not in shape of atat\u00fcrk 's ideal . 
  - other group constantly missing old magnificent ottoman days and are angry about islam being seen as nightmare by some people as it is really huge part of our history and culture . 
  - there are also some trolls who make things more complicated . 
  this is of course just a generalization but it kind of sums up situation and it is not really easy to moderate such a thing . 
  imo mods just should remove direct personal attacks ( let 's say applying general reddit rules ) , other things are hard to deal with it . 
  the sub is kinda reflecting our lovely country . 
  but in reality people on street are not this much seperated . 
  great majority shares the common values and opinions at different rates unlike the sub . 
  i should add that i still love it . 
  and it makes me have more and more respect to atat\u00fcrk as he managed to do what he did and so , such a range of controversial opinions being told in the same language and we can understand each other easily . 
  it 's something great !, 
  each group deserves a lot of criticism and there are many things to talk instead of insulting . 
  there are many taxpayer kurds living under turkish state and they 're quite ok with that . 
  they 're paying their electric bills as well !, 
  why you send them to an unclear future ? 
  ok , let 's think these cities secede . 
  what next ? 
  they will just stay as city states ? 
  nope . 
  many turks fail to understand , that region is strategically and historically very important although `` they 're just undeveloped mountains '' . 
  there would be immediately a complete us ally kurdistan and turkey now lose the ability to control me plus having a most likely unpleasant neighbour . 
  regional power would be lost . 
  there are more aspects but tl ; dr turkey 's geopolitical power would be weakened . 
  if you want to get rid of these cities as you 're sick of paying for them , you definitely have to be good friends with the new state or whatever will be built there .
