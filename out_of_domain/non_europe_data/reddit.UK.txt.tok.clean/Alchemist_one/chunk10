  although we do n't know if that is only part of the game with an underworld/overworld . 
  i want an eye of kilrogg probius, 
  i must go my people need me, 
  well i 've never been into joe before , but he put himself over as fuck last night and tonight for me . 
  colour me impressed , now just get roman the fuck away from him . 
  after tw : wh2 launches , there will be a big patch that combines both maps , so you can literally sail from the old world to the new . 
  they have shown sea events around ulthuan for the new game , so presumably sailing to the new world will be fraught with danger and plenty of events . 
  we do n't know when exactly the maps will be combined after launch . 
   do i need the original game to play total war : warhammer ii ? 
  no , you do n't need the first game in the trilogy in order to play warhammer ii . 
  however , if you do own the first game as well as the warhammer ii , you 'll also be able to choose to play on a huge new combined campaign map ( see below ) . 
  so owners of both games will have three large and different campaign maps to choose from . 
  aggression for the ai seems to be binary tbh . 
  i see games all the time where we 's never leave the woods and wbp conquer estalia and tilea and end up with a much larger empire than the actual empire could hope for . 
  i think honestly part of the problem is the difficulty sliders , they do n't really tell you anything and are pretty crude in how they translate difficulty . 
  we need more options for customising the player experience against the ai . 
  maybe workshop is the answer , but not everyone uses it . 
  jesus christ xavier , please do n't kil yourself mate . 
  this match , holy shit, 
  the full power whip that cena does into the turnbuckle looks fucking amazing . 
  it 's already started ? 
  fuck , how much have i missed of the preshow ? 
  that 's two in a row for 4 * + matches from those two tag teams . 
  so entertaining . 
  he said the meme !, 
  they look more like lancers , which have historically had lower melee/defence and higher charge bonus . 
  no idea what they are like on the tabletop though . 
  only 1 unit of savage orc archers , well are n't you lucky :p, 
  i 'll disagree , i watched the first 2 series live and never had a problem with it . 
  in fact i recently rewatched on netflix as i had never watched the third series and i found no laughtrack to be incredibly jarring . 
  as others have pointed out , if something is genuingly funny a laughtrack can enhance it . 
  to each his own though . 
  felt it was hit and miss , the herr lipp episode and the transplant arm episode were okay . 
  gg no re, 
  shes the hinata of the 4 horsewoman . 
  the woman will throw herself out the window after seeing it on the bbc , jesus christ lol . 
  i hate that fucking smirk roman does , would it hurt to look even a little vulnerable after that last comment cena made . 
  paige was good when it was just her and the divas , but once the nxt woman came up she looked meh and now she 'll be even further behind . 
  it 's like ronda in ufc . 
  not that i 'm putting paige on the same level or anything . 
  i feel like the ability to buy armies to disrupt enemy rituals should have a cooldown as well as a gold cost . 
  i 'm worried that disrupting rituals will become far too easy and take the tension out of the game . 
  did you honestly make an account just to shit on tb ? 
  how sad . 
   post from yesterday that criticized one mistake he made . 
  a large number of people used that thread as an excuse to shit on tb for things completely unrelated to the game . 
  i 'm glad i do n't have thousands of people criticizing me for every mistake i make . 
  do n't you mean lizardmen or am i missing something ? 
  can someone with more talent than me edit this with cesaro and send it to maffew, 
  fanks, 
  sit down smarks, 
  i think when the suplex train starts people think it 's gon na finish for lesner , again . 
  kinda kills it . 
  i 'm an undecided voter and after almost 2 years of doing my homework i 'm still no closer to deciding . 
  my main concerns are ;, 
  currency , i do n't want the euro and true independence means no pound imo, 
  immigration , i 'm concerned that with no conservative party worth a damn , our immigration policy will follow the blair years in style . 
  i do n't want immigrants , skilled or not rushing into the country like sweden atm when we ca n't support it with housing , nhs or socially . 
  i 'm concerned that the big multinationals will pull strings to have their puppets damage an independent scotland by pulling business and jobs out . 
  i have no doubt scotland could be a successful independent country with a diverse economy . 
  i know the nhs is not safe because of the cuts already made to scotland 's national budget already having an affect on colleges . 
  i know both eck and cam are saying wee white lies to get the result they want , they question is how big are those white lies really . 
  basically i 'm stuck . 
  just for funzies , 
  [ whatever your reasons may be , come and discuss . 
  there 's no need to annoy people in threads with people who have bought the game , we can get through this together bros :3 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/h1w0wh4.jpg ),
