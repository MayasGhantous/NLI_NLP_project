  why did n't you make a thread about one of your own outfit members who does the exact same thing ? 
  basketball playing shitties . 
  good kph ? 
  a really nice way to do it . 
  seeing this reminded me [ you were in my first ever screenshot ] ( http://i.imgur.com/niin0mj.jpg?1 ) , so uh congrats on that as well !, 
  i 'm gon na put up a montage where i play cyclone heavy to show my skills . 
  i 'm also going to include some air hammer gameplay where i play combined-arms and * support * our ground troops by killing br10s . 
  this takes lots of skill because i am only in a 5 man ganksquad , so naturally a 6 man ganksquad would easily take us out . 
  combined arms is fun and takes 14 skills to accomplish at my level . 
  you probably only have like 5 skills or something , shitter . 
  i just sing along to `` party in the usa '' as i play . 
  yeah , it 's from the 28th of december 2012 . 
  probably being capped by 1-12 ... 
  stats do n't prove anything , spayre constantly fights alone against the zerg leading to his unimpressive stats . 
  if he was a stupid tower pump action shotgun heavy ppa farmer like you shitters in dhmr he would be better than you . 
  once a base is completely under control , people will redeploy to help at another fight leading to a lack of base caps despite ** contributing ** . 
  some people have fun standing around like lemons at zergcaps , which if you enjoy , you are welcome to do . 
  standing around like a lemon is n't for all of us but if you want to do it , good for you !, 
  that 's the beauty of it , you know the meaning , but all the others upvote me meaning i still have my ipoints on reddit . 
  edit : jokes people you are n't all retarded , just speshul . 
  just think that you should embrace your zergy tendencies as a part of your outfits persona . 
  do n't feel shame . 
  it 's my 13th birthday in january . 
  it 's pronounced buck cake . 
  pour it down my urethra . 
  say wallah ?

  this entire thing is cringy as fuck . 
  ( no offence ), 
  good thing farrage does n't exist and we only follow farage . 
  like a biolab , but the biolab is everywhere . 
  the highest upvoted comment is in the mid 20s , come off it mate . 
  one of the best i 've seen honestly , still kinda believe they are deep fried pups .

  everyone knows average xp is an indicator of skill and teamworking ability . 
  it ca n't possibly be inflated by time played or boosts . 
  my first submission here so i wanted to be thorough . 
  because who needs a dm . 
  lol . 
  it does n't show a cat toying with the frog before mutilating it and leaving it on the doorstep as an offering . 
  fair weather fans should fuck off . 
  ok , as someone who did n't watch the stream . 
  why did cobalt lose ? 
  atleast we farmed with lolpods . 
  #f 00lsblngmasterrace, 
  you are 24th for ppa kills on cobalt . 
  there are 12 people from f00ls in the top 24 for ppa kills . 
  but you `` hate '' the ppa . 
  lol . 
  why are you always hating on welbeck ? 
  every thread with him you are putting him down . 
  if that was a red , then cahill should have had one as well . 
  cs : go has 200k concurrent players , ps2 doesnt even have 10k ... 
  test member . 
  lol . 
  shitties join shitfits i guess . 
  do n't even get me started m8 . 
  lol . 
  kakeface here , i added you for x-com . 
  kakeface here , got the granpulse card . 
  the only physics in the game are boob physics . 
  and you told me to be more positive !, 
  . lol . 
  expected . 
  ibaf, 
  love the music , nice video . 
  test that out ? 
  keep calm and love facs . 
  stop cry . 
  we all cry . 
  suck out . 
  but fax is top-tier zerger . 
  i like to show how much of a problem hackers are by hacking . 
  you get noticeable input lag though . 
  if he stops drinking from it for more than 10 seconds he drops dead . 
  you just wait until you add the portable shower so you can have you 2am ice chilli . 
  unfortunately killing them makes them into exactly what they want to become , martyrs . 
  exoz is a nice guy who is nice . 
  you serious about keane and vieira ? 
  good to see they did n't change the vehicle physics from planetside . 
  it would just mean there would be more heavies , which we * obviously * lack . 
  swag was n't over 18 when it occurred though . 
  lol he 's an exploiter , nothing more , nothing less . 
  i thought better of kain honestly . 
  nah fam , manz been runnin dem endz since day1, 
  giroud always seems like that . 
   20k certs in 3 days of playing ( like 4 hours a day ) . 
  13,000 certs in 12 hours play time is pretty fucking insane , so i honestly do n't understand your complaints . 
   ability to farm certs many times faster with a subscription still makes this game very pay to win . 
  50 % faster , not `` many times faster '' . 
  stop fucking lying , no primary weapon in the game ca n't kill another infantry player in under 1 clip . 
  edit : guess i 'm not taking into account terrible aim , so sure if you miss all your bullets you wo n't kill in a 1 clip or 20 . 
  it hit 1000 concurrent players last week , so it is n't doing badly for a closed beta . 
  despite them removing those ads in under a week ? 
  they apologised for the frequency of ads and reverted it . 
  so say normally you get a kill and it is 100xp , with the two 50 % boosts it will be 200xp . 
  on double xp that is 400xp . 
  how did you get 5x a normal player ? 
  mate ... that 300 % boost was only for passive cert gain every day you log in .
