  so instead of 16 a day , you would get 48 a day . 
  why would you buy membership without knowing what it contains ?

  it only gives a 50 % boost to xp gain , stop spreading lies about the game . 
  it has many faults , but p2w really is n't one of them . 
  those long lasting hyper boosts ... 
  add a question mark to the end of the url and it should load for you . 
  do you think a free2play fpsmmo like planetside could ever be profitable in the long run ? 
  he 's scored 40 in 71 games for psg , nothing like torres . 
  he 's scored 40 in 71 games for psg , nothing like torres . 
  all i can say is do n't be a shitty . 
  but it 's you so i would n't blame you for struggling . 
  it 's a deflection , comes down to luck not `` taking their chances . '', 
  true that . 
  just seem resigned to our fate . 
  ospina was not at fault in the first goal . 
  tourists . 
  i agree about per , should be dropped for gabriel . 
  but ospina was caught wrong footed due to the deflection , de gea conceded the same goal earlier in the season . 
  i get what you 're saying , but when you are caught wrong footed , it is almost impossible to change momentum that quickly . 
  mertesacker has been very dissapointing ever since the world cup , really does n't seem like he is getting any better . 
  do n't really get how it 's so bad , are you honestly trying to argue monaco was a worse draw than us getting bayern or real madrid . 
  we were naturally excited getting the worst possible team we could . 
  turns out we were worse . 
  who did liverpool draw ? 
  is it a tuesday or wednesday night game ? 
  we are n't gon na know at the time though are we , if you look at our team on paper we are better . 
  too bad mentally , we were half the team monaco were . 
  we already beat besiktas though . 
  gon na come out with any actual reasoning or just continue the `` lol u bad '' drivel ? 
  all you did is quote and agree with saying arsenal were worse and then say our team is n't better on paper . 
  your argument boils down to arsenal being worse because they are worse . 
  like asking a kid why their favourite cartoon is so good , `` it 's good because it 's awesome . '', 
  similar to your `` you 're bad because you 're bad . '', 
  after 2 years of bayern , getting a team a lot weaker than them is obviously gon na make us happy . 
  ca n't really shit on us for being excited that we might , for the first time in a few years , get to the quarters . 
  in hindsight , it is easy to look back and laugh , but if you had the chance of drawing bayern or monaco , you would n't be happy that you got monaco ? 
  when did i assume we had already won ? 
  i hope you are n't trying to generalize based off a small minority . 
  sanchez was bad as well last night , what a terrible player . 
  i 'm an arsenal fan , you generalised all arsenal fans . 
  so yes , you were talking about me . 
  it 's not an easy finish . 
  close range diving headers are easy to miss , look at messi . 
  he 's gon na go hard , probably gon na fill it with coconut water or something fancy . 
  really , you would have taken it round de gea ? 
  referees ca n't learn from their mistakes and improve ? 
  are you being sarcastic ? 
  i agree with ibra . 
  its tradition . 
  having to win 3-0 away at a club that has n't lost by that in europe since 1995 makes arsenal underdogs . 
  so we are the underdogs ? 
  i do n't see the point you are trying to make . 
  you need the dinosaur duck thingy to go along with that . 
  it was barca dna but yeah . 
  there are though , if you get revived someone got a kill but nobody `` received '' a death . 
  you honestly trying to argue that inhaling any form of smoke is good for you ? 
  that doesnt make cannabis smoke healthy . 
  y u got ta hate . 
  sick video , sick kills . 
  you 're an insane player !, 
  lol this is the same game that literally cried to my for 20 minutes about how op adad is . 
  what, 
  it 's generally just 14 year olds that argue this . 
  how can it ever be good for a game to lose skilled players ? 
  haha , because people get better by playing against worse players ... 
  right . 
  the pounder max in a biolab is pretty classic . 
  almost as autistic as adad spam right ? 
  i have the lowest playtime out of all infantry classes as heavy , nice try but no . 
  / u/ps2bot kakeface, 
  you 've already abused exploits before shooting through spawnrooms with ppa ? 
  why would it stop you ? 
  word . 
  why not just say it on your main account ? 
  it really did n't feel like infantry skill was our issue . 
  417 is me and i 'm ukip not tfdn . 
  medic with medkits is true shitter style , never forget it . 
  your outfit used to boast about exploiting with the ppa through spawn shield at render distance . 
  why are you even talking ? 
  whenever i log onto vs there is nobody online , i just assumed you all followed mike into lol . 
  why are you so full of vitriol man , calm down . 
  love it duck . 
  xdxdxdxdxd, 
  you can smell drama from lol ? 
  but did n't you hear , he has the kraken . 
  exploiting in the good old days back on ceres , prst and sllg . 
  i still find it hard to believe an outfit like kain would let in people who are proud of their exploiting . 
  i think it 's kinda obvious it 's a joke . 
  maybe you 're just a humourless shitter ? 
  on the forums where the hack was uploaded a lot of them are complaining about being banned pretty quickly . 
  [ response from radarx . 
  ] ( http://np.reddit.com/r/planetside/comments/356o6v/get_this_fucking_hacker_banned/cr1jt39 ), 
  [ they 're a bunch of exploiters ] ( http://www.np.reddit.com/r/ps2cobalt/comments/33pnaj/just_why_drama/cqn8aj6 ) and have been boasting about it for years , nothing will change , soe/dbg do n't give a shit . 
  nice job with this . 
  what 's droping ? 
  there was a thread on / r/ps2ceres where people said what they would change their names to if given the opportunity . 
  would be interesting to see who went through with it . 
  edit : found it https://www.np.reddit.com/r/ps2ceres/comments/28vh37/so_whos_going_to_make_use_of_the_upcoming_name, 
  nah m8 , i think we should kick out all da immigronts .
