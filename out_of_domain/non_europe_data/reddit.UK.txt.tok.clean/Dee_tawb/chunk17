  you 're just trying to defend the exploiting of your outfit , stop it . 
  it only absorbs that universe , not the multiverse . 
  `` adam warlock , only you could miss the end of the universe . '', 
  only the universe , not the multiverse . 
  thanos also states `` that is how the universe came to an end . '', 
  no mention of the multiverse . 
  kinda makes sense when its called `` heart of the ** universe . 
  plz can you change your description , it 's really offensive to me as sean bean is basically my 3rd father . 
  i 'll can offer a copy of harry potter and the deathly hallows : part 2 ( bluray editon ) if you want . 
  a version of him shows up in future imperfect . 
  this place was much friendlier , wish the cobalt one was more like it tbh . 
  except fem-thor is fucking awful and makes no sense . 
  you do n't enjoy his * dank memes * ? 
  i 'm hoping there is a confrontation or explanation with the beyonders , but sadly i doubt there will be . 
  lol , hyperion has already been announced so i doubt it . 
  he has a severe case of the old floaty foot . 
  but the planets colliding is the incursion ? 
  oh cool , i thought you meant his universe was n't destroyed by an incursion . 
  the artist , greg land , pastes the characters he draws onto the backgrounds . 
  it creates this really jarring look and once you notice it once , you 'll see it in all his art . 
  people just want discussions about the game to be visible , not shit-posts like this . 
  but you are n't a member of this community , you are just here to brigade and argue with people that disagree with you . 
  this community decides if it is an issue and this community will fix it if needs be . 
  people like you are just here to crusade against whatever it is you feel you need to fight against . 
  not because you care or want to help the planetside community . 
  go away . 
  confirmed for white-knight . 
  man , i just want to shoot planetmans and discuss planetside . 
  not have you come in with you fedora tipping , cheeto-stained hands . 
  you probably should n't call someone an idiot while being unable to correctly use an apostrophe . 
  after you edited it , sure . 
  [ marvel universe : the end ] ( http://www.amazon.co.uk/marvel-universe-end-jim-starlin/dp/0785167846/ref=sr_1_1?ie=utf8&amp;qid=1433966942&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=marvel+universe+the+end ) if anyone is interested . 
  where 's that from ? 
  to be fair when he killed the beyonder he also killed himself . 
  maybe , although these beyonders very robotic compared to the more organic ones that took down the celestials and abstracts . 
  it seemed to me like these were n't the same as the ones that fought the abstracts , just speculation though . 
  because silver surfer is n't a `` cosmic powerhouse '' . 
  he was off to organise a meeting with the celestials and the illuminati before they disappeared , presumably dying at the hands of the beyonders . 
  is scathan really that low ? 
  from what i got he was almost as powerful or more powerful than the living tribunal . 
  to be fair , if he did n't everything would die . 
  he managed to save some parts of existance which is better than none . 
  lol . 
  the median playtime for skyrim on steam is 8 and a half hours , so i doubt it . 
  he was pulled there because he is `` cosmically '' needed there . 
  it felt like bendis had so much more to say , the entire ending arc for miles felt rushed . 
  old man logan is really good and serves as a soft continuation of the old man logan universe/story . 
  hickman 's avenger run ended with # 44 . 
  he wo n't be doing anymore avengers or new avengers for that matter . 
  the apocalypse twins arc of uncanny avengers was amazing . 
  yeah why did he change it to that ? 
  of course you ca n't spell . 
  the whole origin story is based on the earth-1610 fantastic 4 so their ages are fine . 
  yeah , i agree with you on that . 
  + / u/user _ simulator / u/dee _ tawb, 
  but that was only a skrull posing as black bolt , so it 's pretty irrelevant . 
  [ yeah he 's not as fast ] ( http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11114/111143885/4579107-luzrg.gif ) . 
  like come on man , think before you make shit up . 
  if he can speedblitz an infinity gem malekith then he can blitz fucking spider-man lol . 
  we 're literally living in a police state , 1984 come to life . 
  yeah , do n't agree with him being on after being out cold . 
  the speech is added in , the images excluding the two obviously added in are from old man logan # 1 . 
  that whole event was pretty much retconned and has never been mentioned since so ... 
  except richard rider was a far superior nova . 
  it 's a shame that he 's now a door . 
  which is pis . 
  that 's what bendis does . 
  are you taking the piss ? 
  thor is on a completely different level to hulk . 
  hulk at his strongest is a planetbuster , thor is a casual planetbuster . 
  they are n't even comparable rofl . 
  are n't you a kiwimatsch alt ? 
  the art in this was so lazy . 
  to be fair it 's being written by bendis , that 's worrying enough . 
  got ta love dankpool and all his top quality memes . 
  all-new x-men is okay to bad while his guardians is complete shit . 
  i enjoyed uncanny x-men up until the `` last will and testament of charles xavier '' arc which was dragged on for way , way too long . 
  i 'll admit i do enjoy ultimate spiderman with miles , i enjoy the character even if bendis has been forced to chuck him into crossovers every other issue . 
  have you ever played 2 men down ? 
  the extra ground you have to cover will tire you out in no down . 
  do we really need trailers for esf montages ? 
  when i grow up i want to be a human dna . 
  he 'll be in the new squadron supreme if that interests you . 
  reed has an edge over pym and it 's stated many times . 
  i view that as pym exploring as far as he possibly can with no care for the consequences or ethical issues with eternity recognizing that . 
  edit : eternity . 
  beings like thanos and the high-evolutionary operate at a higher level than people like reed . 
  that 's a non-canon scan so i do n't see its relevancy . 
  thanos rising is genuinely awful . 
  it 's a story that did n't need to be told , not everything needs an origin story . 
  it 's chock full of tropes that make thanos seem like your typical mad at the the world villain . 
  edit : downvotes but no reasons for it being any good . 
  yes but that is n't directly related , it could have been anything causing the avengers to be off planet and it would 've made no difference . 
  [ take a look .

  ** #justiceforpintle ? 
  that 's the point though . 
  i know what you mean , miles looks really off in this . 
  that 's because you ca n't criticise perfection . 
  it turns him into your typical sociopathic , easily manipulated villian who suffered tragedies as a child .
