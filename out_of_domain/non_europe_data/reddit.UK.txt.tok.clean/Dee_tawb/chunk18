  born to one cruel , hateful parent ? 
  check !, 
  his mother attempts to kill him at birth . 
  is bullied at school then suffers a tragedy ? 
  check !, 
  his only friends are all eaten by iguanas or something . 
  develops serial killer-like tendencies ? 
  check !, 
  he chops up some bear or something . 
  manipulated by someone he trusts ? 
  check !, 
  lol it wuz death all along . 
  it sucks because it gives you a human origin story to a character that is above human problems . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.comicbookherald.com/thanos-rising-the-worst-thanos-comic-of-all-time/ ) vocalises a lot of my complaints with the series in a a much better way than i did . 
  [ thor survives absorbing a bomb designed to kill every god throughout time within the universe ] ( https://i.imgur.com/f4fdse3.jpg ) . 
  he can survive the destruction of a planet . 
  you are the one claiming its p2w so the onus is on you to substantiate the claim . 
  it 's irrelevant though as you wo n't be able to . 
  yes you can buy membership letting you have cheaper hats and cosmetics , pay2win eh ? 
  atleast for his fight with vortex , its mention in this is its only mention . 
  like you , i tried to find out a bit about it and that 's all there is to that . 
  it 's out of print which is why they are so expensive now . 
  same with the annihilation and alias omnibuses ( omnibi ? ), 
  the entirety of bendis ' guardians run is dumb af . 
  you ca n't buy vehicles lol . 
  stop talking shit about a game you know nothing about . 
  you do n't like it , fine . 
  but why make shit up in order to further your agenda ? 
  he was n't really needed for the plotline . 
  remove him and literally nothing of significance changes . 
  i guess fuck is n't all that solid . 
  who actually believes we are a contender or have a chance ? 
  why 's he on the bench if so ? 
  genuine question . 
  it was pretty representative of his recent writing , in that it was awful . 
  it 's not over yet . 
  thanos references it afterwards during the thanos : redemption '' so it is canon . 
  bendis revisiting a plot point ? 
  there are loads in the past few years , i 'm assuming you do n't read anything marvel . 
  it 's not . 
  it 's the 616 captain marvel . 
  in issue 5 she is on her knees in front of sinister . 
  [ that 's snashy . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lecsoj9ir7s ), 
  u r a bad dirty farmer . 
  but fear itself was a mess and badly written . 
  if they include [ this ] ( http://wac.450f.edgecastcdn.net/80450f/comicsalliance.com/files/2013/11/infinity-dog-boom.jpg ) i 'll be so happy . 
  why ? 
  i just think it sucks that so far , he has done very little apart from be one of the bad guys in events . 
  it 's only up to issue 6 . 
  and in that his picture is greyed out and has a cross over it . 
  just do n't read the contents , save yourself the pain . 
  yeah , bendis writes really good cosmic stories and really understands the guardians . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ writing ^ ^ ^ ^ that ^ ^ ^ ^ hurts ^ ^ ^ ^ so ^ ^ ^ ^ much . 
  dank tumblr maymays . 
  yeah , except that 's not the complaint anyone has with those page . 
  anything to fit your agenda eh ? 
  yeah , titania standing down when her entire reason for fighting is to be the strongest woman in the universe makes no sense . 
  completely out of character for her . 
  it 's just the writer trying to make you like janethor by saying `` look at all the respect she 's getting from this big bad villian , do n't you respect her as well ? '', 
  oh and you are supposed to root her for after she smacks her surrendered opponent in the face . 
  i think it 's entirely possible to make a good femthor book , this was far from it though . 
  her character came down to her just being better than thor at everything , which does n't attract you to a character . 
  does n't help that she was completely useless during time runs out . 
  while thor heads off to face the beyonders what is jane doing ? 
  jason aaron just wrote her series badly and it reflects badly on her . 
  edit : find me one instance of creel being misogynistic in the past and i 'll agree it is n't pandering . 
  but you wo n't because you ca n't . 
   find me one instance of creel being misogynistic in the past and i 'll agree it is n't pandering . 
  but you wo n't because you ca n't . 
  vardy actually has talent though . 
  no invincible in january ? 
  by causing problems for the best team in the world ? 
  but he is . 
  at everything except finishing . 
  ceres reddit game too strong . 
  brother , are you a muslim ? 
  probably relevant to the majority of this sub then . 
  i do n't get why you always shit talk , you are pretty awful at infantry whenever i 've seen you . 
  this coming from someone who does n't play much anymore either . 
  further split up an already fractured community \u00bf, 
  genius !, 
  [ yes please ] ( https://40.media.tumblr.com/883fa686e73ac4509a2effce8c752c7b/tumblr_nls1nsubph1ur9y8no2_1280.jpg ), 
  this is from hickman 's new avengers . 
  if you have n't read it go and read it along with avengers which is parallel to it . 
  if you enjoy bendis ' guardians then taste is probably something you are lacking . 
  well he survived a bomb that caused a tear in the universe itself . 
  some really nice clips in there . 
  shame my ears are bleeding . 
  but that would make no sense . 
  if you want advice on how to get better , you want people to see everything you do normally . 
  montages just show your best moments so it 's hard to give advice from them . 
  events sell more . 
  thank / u/gamisb , not me . 
  people have been saying that same thing for years though . 
  the beyonders were n't in the negative zone , they along with places like the library of worlds reside outside the observable multiverse . 
  so that 's what it was , i joined when there was only 40min left but it said there was 1:40 left , leaving me confused . 
  +1 to this , headshots are not everything . 
  shooting a guy in the back counts the same as a 1v1 aim duel . 
  avenger 's world as well , even if it is n't as good as the main avengers run .
