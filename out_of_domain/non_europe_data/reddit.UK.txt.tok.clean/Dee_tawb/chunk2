  she sounds amazing , oh what am i saying , i bet she is amazing . 
  * wells up * onions man , fucking onions . 
  yes but this is like having a keychain attached to your eyebrow . 
  it 's that bit cooler . 
  albeit sight reducing . 
  i 'd give myself a button attached to my cock that allows me to explode peoples appendixes . 
  people would think i was touching myself as i looked at them , then ** bam ** self destruct . 
  bombing our cities just made our resolve that bit stronger . 
  thanks, 
  wan na buy a nine-pipe problem for 3keys ? 
  also wan na buy a s.sticky launcher for 1.33 refined ? 
  i could add strange sticky launcher and powerjack for your last breath ? 
  i had a retard moment there sorry . 
  my last offer would be to give my nine-pipe for your outback intellectual ? 
  for the last breath offer , i lost my shit and in my head decided a key was 1ref , thats why i lowballed so badly . 
  and i could add the s.powerjack to my offer for your outback . 
  ill add the stick launcher if you add 1ref ? 
  added you . 
  6 tickets + 1ref . 
  you get these due to a glitch . 
  when you complete a tour in mann up up mode you get a botkiller , depending on what tour it is , your first or second etc. 
  you will get a level 1 botkiller or level 2 if it is your 2nd tour . 
  this makes the item you gets with your botkiller be level 1,2,3,4 etc. 
  anrold the great .

  i now have the metal , so can we do the trade ? 
  i would like to buy the hat with no name . 
  i ca n't currently afford this , but nice set . 
  added to buy meet the medic taunt, 
  it is probably more valuable due it not being traded , that rules out it being in the hands of marked scammer before or it being duped . 
  also i find [ this ] ( http://wiki.teamfortress.com/w/images/0/08/painted_max%27s_severed_head_7e7e7e.png ) really suits the hat well , but at the end of the day , go with a colour you like . 
  also be careful about trading it for a duped one , alot of people them less than non-duped maxheads . 
  can i ask how much you want for the orbiting planets jefe ?

  yeah , i would say around 15keys maybe , i 'm trying to get craft # 50 for around that so yours may go for more . 
  421 you are an amazing guy for doing this , amazing generosity .

  well no , flies goes for more than most effects on sniper , and it is a very collectable effect . 
  yeah that goes for 20 + buds . 
  hitler was n't an atheist . 
  [ look here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/religious_views_of_adolf_hitler ) , it seems he was more likely to be a christian believing in aryan christ . 
  yes , that they did . 
  at the end of the days , the sources conflict on whether he was truly christian or not . 
  i 'll do this with you , tag is omgscarface ( amazing rite ) . 
  tell me when you will be on . 
  i 'll give cc for bee ? 
  thanks alot  - when you say tonight what do you mean , as im from england so might be timezone differences . 
  cool , i saw you wanted some nade mods so ill dupe ya a bonus package . 
  i know this is n't what you are asking for , but can i offer l. 50 bonus package , volcano , pitchfork , impaler , hide of terra , hornet and sham for babymaker and the relic ? 
  and maybe the maggie as well ? 
  i 'll do it , 
  tell me if you are still on . 
  i 'll dupe you a conference call and a bee  along with some other legendaries . 
  my psn is omgscarface, 
  also duping can be done with just another controller . 
  give your stuff to the 2nd person then have them save and quit . 
  then the host quits through playstation menu without saving . 
  then when you go back in both of you will have the guns . 
  awesome , ill try giving yo all the duped legendaries i 've got . 
  yeah , i 'll give the bee to you later if i can . 
  thank you so much , if you want i could give you any of the stuff i mentioned ? 
  ca n't get on today , but i 'll do it tomorrow . 
  what ... africa has a larger population than europe or north america ...
