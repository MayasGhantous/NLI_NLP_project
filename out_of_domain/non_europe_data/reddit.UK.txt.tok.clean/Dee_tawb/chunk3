  i named my brother `` samwise '' because i liked lord of the rings . 
  xdxdxdxd, 
  i 've got one of these in my garden , it 's called a gunnera . 
  apart from being ugly and obnoxious as hell . 
  why ? 
  top quality reasoning , a for circlejerking . 
  alll he does is comment about how bad the game is . 
  look at his past comments . 
  it 's a completely natural thing to want to do . 
  ca n't you look for yourself , instead of just going `` sourece ? 
  source ? 
  source ?!?!?! '', 
  do you have a sourece for that last statement ? 
  will it affect me if the mobo is micro-atx ? 
  i assume it will still fit in atx case ? 
  no , do n't . 
  he more than likely has gotten over it and this will bring up bad memories . 
  edit : i 'm not saying this is the only way , but from anecdotal experience ( trustworthy right ? 
  ) , i feel this is the wayt to go about it . 
  you touch it down , you know , like a `` touchdown . '', 
  i mean goddamit guys , was n't that obvious from just `` wtf no '', 
  table tennis . 
  archery . 
  diving . 
  tbh its probably karmanaut and if it is n't karmanaut , it 's probably [ this guy ] ( http://www.reddit.com/user/karmanaut ) . 
  it 's a hoverboard , they do n't need wheels . 
  olympics ? 
  the populance of reddit is mainly kids , so complaining about kids makes it seem like they are n't kids . 
  poetic . 
  creepy . 
  i think reading would be the least of your worries . 
  or do n't , depending on how much you like her . 
  he has no way of getting down , if jumps he snaps his ankle . 
  fine then , it . 
  i do n't even have arma ii, 
  you could probably go up to 2gb 7850 for a tenner . 
  that is an xfx 7950 for # 215 that comes with 6 games , including far cry3 , hitman absolution and sleeping dogs . 
  i just bought it and have activated the games , pretty good deal if you ask me . 
  that comes with 6 games and is a bit cheaper . 
  / r/buildapcforme, 
  did you actually just ban him ... 
  you have to give them freedom , you ca n't keep them chained up . 
  yeah , i was looking at the child as if it was 10-11 . 
  he is from canada , so different items will show up ... 
  it 's a copy and paste from an article ... 
  the `` victim '' did n't exactly help keep themselves secure . 
  then they ca n't expect them to be prosecuted . 
  just saying that if they wo n't give the british courts evidence , then britain ca n't prosecute him with america going `` we have the evidence , but we wo n't give it to you ... 
  but trust us , it 's really baaaaad . '', 
  i 'm not definate about this , but it seems like there are way more shootings per capita in america then their are in other western countries . 
  so you would like me to compare america to angola and afghanistan ? 
  / r/buildapcforme, 
  `` urine my sights '', 
  i 'm an atheist , but are n't christians over 50 % of the population ? 
  the census of 2011 still shows over 50 % of british people being christian ... 
  see here http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/census/2011-census/key-statistics-for-local-authorities-in-england-and-wales/rpt-religion.html, 
  it was in response to the idea that most of us disregard the clerics teaching 's . 
  with over 50 % of britain christian , i doubt they disregard their teachings . 
  if you define yourself as christian then you will listen to the cleric . 
  cheaper . 
  he is a hobbyist not a budget builder . 
  looking back , you must feel different . 
  some shitty admins here . 
  eh , not really , once you kill the warrior you will have as much eridium as you want . 
  you also get more exp from not killing yourself . 
  i would love to join , added you ingame . 
  i created a new char so i could be on your server , ign is kakeface . 
  copying youtubes top comment ... 
  you do live up to your name . 
  tried out over 100 , all taken . 
  sucks , but thanks anyway for doing this . 
  that is because call of duty is a shit port , whereas bf3 is well optimised for pc . 
  again with planetside 2 , that game is not well optimised . 
  skyrim is n't exactly intensive . 
  far cry 3 is badly optimised though . 
  you do realise that even if they were n't `` royal '' they would still own buckingham palace and windsor castle and everything else in their name . 
  most english words began in england . 
  ouf corse it does . 
  that 's highly unlikely . 
  he is deaf . 
  america has stricter freedom of speech laws than the uk . 
  not really , he is stating facts , they outperform nvidia cards that are at a similar price point , but their driver support is weaker . 
  only if you get a titan , which is stupidly expensive . 
  all credit goes to mcjackson for recording this . 
  jesus fucking christ , no you fucking are n't . 
  all reddit has done is falsely accuse innocents . 
  henning wehn , his accent makes it . 
  you get it for paying with sc before april the third . 
  i 'm just telling you what higby said on twitter . 
  using `` le '' is going to get you downvotes . 
  i find that i spin about 50 % of the time i drop in . 
  yes , you have a great gfx card, 
  the fortnightly events are generally pretty good as well . 
  every server is suffering from this . 
  the game has a main selling point of letting the user experience battles involving hundreds of people , nobody can really take in this experience when you ca n't resupply/heal , ca n't know if you actually killed someone and cloaking takes a second after you click .
