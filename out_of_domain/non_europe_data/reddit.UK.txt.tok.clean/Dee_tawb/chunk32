  you ca n't buy portal 2 or cs : go on origin , i was joking . 
  top kek . 
  almost like a single sentence ca n't sum up an entire sport . 
  highly unlikely eh ? 
  it 's their culture , you would n't understand . 
  it 's a sizable minority , which is an issue . 
  you obviously have n't done the hearts of stone bosses in ng + deathmarch . 
  so fucking broken , it 's obvious the devs did n't test it . 
  nope , the footage from the stadium proves what he is saying . 
  there are english fans in hospital with stab wounds . 
  it is . 
  `` we know some were carrying knives because one england fan was stabbed . '', 
  sharp . 
  semmler is not good lol . 
  what are you on about ? 
  they said `` fuck off russia '' not `` fuck off russians '' . 
  [ hmm . 
  you 're not even a good troll . 
  pretty sad if that 's the case , seems like he needed that help honestly . 
  one what ? 
  the show is too simple now for this to be done . 
  realistically why else do you think they were in the town centre on their own ? 
  that does n't change how it affects the consumers . 
  the wealth in the uk is not the largest in the world . 
  that is complete bollocks .

  the first non-ireland related death since 1880 . 
  uhh , spoiler . 
  i can vouch for xfx , great customer support when i bought their 7950 . 
  sorry , thought you were speaking it as fact . 
  you are arguing with a legitimate nutter , it 's impossible to have a rational discussion with him . 
  why you so mad ? 
  they are probably going to appear in the next episode . 
  look on nexusmods , there is one that gives hairworks to all but geralt . 
  death threats and doxing from this sub mean the mods now take it very seriously . 
  why ? 
  it 's already beginning to recover , the ftse 100 and the pound sterling . 
  remember that it 's even worse for scotland now that the oil prices are so low . 
  no , together they are 10 % of the economy . 
  [ yep . 
  [ about that ... ] ( https://qph.ec.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-843706ca73862c1b29683a7e6f72ed57 ), 
  a lot of people have issues with what they perceive as uncontrolled immigration . 
  people like you dismissing them as racist or xenophobes as if their complaints have no merit helped to cause this result . 
  it was a vote against the establishment because a lot of leavers feel they are n't listened to and want to stick it to them . 
  sticking it to the establishment by giving them more power , turkeys voting for christmas . 
  also the economy is hardly in freefall , the pound fell but has seemingly stabilised although that could be a dead cat bounce . 
  the ftse 100 is also back up to where it was two weeks ago so not really `` shitting the bed . '', 
  sadly the economy will probably suffer , unsurprisingly . 
  my point was that a lot of leave voters have valid concerns and waving them away as racist bigots is wrong and arrogant . 
  mercy is pretty much a staple in a majority of comp setups so it is n't that unreasonable . 
  are you going to answer and reply to the top comment ? 
  they literally hinted for the entire season she would blow up the wildfire , did you need to be bashed over the head with it ? 
  no its le teleporter xd, 
  you might have autism or something , get it checked . 
  evidence of gimping please . 
  great way to avoid providing any evidence . 
  '' their latest drivers have resolved those issues '', 
  you ca n't find any evidence , that 's why you are n't providing it . 
  also half your post is unintelligible so maybe it would help you out if you fix that . 
  he said he ca n't believe it happened . 
  i 'm not the one calling people retarded because people challenge my `` believes '' . 
  when we import 50 % of our food it 's not that good . 
  you 're a nutter . 
  who the fuck rates them ? 
  this opinion is honestly so dumb and it 's obvious you 've never played a competitive game before . 
  behind being stupid , ignorant , and damaging to the game , yes . 
  did you * actually * post a comment expecting no replies ? 
  i 've only insulted you once . 
  your victim complex is showing . 
  if he disagrees he 's a paid shill , that 's what this sub has taught me . 
  my game is stuck at 20fps , turning and staring at the ceiling . 
  anyone else ? 
  yeah but raptr is not as good , that 's why people go for shadowplay . 
  the sun and the daily mail are the two biggest newspapers in the country . 
  you claimed the coverage has been `` horribly biased '' , yet the two biggest newspapers were pro-brexit . 
  this is forgetting others like the sunday times and the daily telegraph , which were also pro-brexit . 
  i think you are confusing reddit coverage with uk media as a whole . 
  nobody has got below 25 or above 77 . 
  there are newer , better $ 500 cards on the market though . 
  why compare it to the 980 then ? 
  if for the price you can buy cards that smash it . 
  a 390 in england is the same price as the 480 lol . 
  so yeah , it could . 
  top kek you fucking neckbeard . 
  most people do n't sign up to tech support forums until they need tech support , so it does n't really tell you anything . 
  you 're a racist . 
  if you overclock both cards , the 970 will be faster . 
  planetside 2 has gunplay that is n't complete dogshit and there is so much less explosive spam . 
  lot 's of the gunfights occured in narrow hallways in bases and such , combine that with ample amounts of grenades and explosives and it 's not fun to play . 
  it 's sansa , her role is to be manipulated and nothing more , it 's all she is capable of . 
  the guy literally says he is german . 
  cod has great feeling gunplay though so i do n't see how that 's a bad thing . 
  grenades have a resource cost and bases are generally better designed , especially new ones . 
  also he is heavily nerfed . 
  every spawn has multiple exits , so if you are being shelled at all exits then that 's an issue with overpop not explosives . 
  unless of course you are n't intelligent enough to leave through other exits . 
  so it is n't a problem with explosive spam , but with the spawn mechanics ? 
  make up your mind mate .
