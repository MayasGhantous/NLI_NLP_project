  mate , they finish you off and take a kidney or two . 
  anyone who is n't subscribed to / r/ayymd is a nvidia shill . 
  that point also applies to overwatch . 
  a global against a group of silvers wo n't help them at all , all they 'll see is themselves being 1-tapped over and over . 
  that 's just luck though . 
  none of that makes it `` cringy . '', 
  everything you do n't do is cringy . 
  it 's based on hidden mmr as well as your rank , so ruwin got top500 at rank 71 . 
  can you link the thread ? 
  so why would they pirate the game if they do n't have time to play it ? 
  it 's amazing the mental gymnastics people do to pretend they are n't just being cheap fucks . 
  he probably found out that they were banned from promod as well so this would be their 3rd shot , not their 2nd . 
  yes , i 'm making fun of poor people . 
  i feel bad but i thought the same thing when i read he was wearing a trilby . 
  allegations ? 
  they cheated and admitted to that , calling them cheaters is a statement of fact . 
  ahahahahahahhah https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjgt2jp2n1a, 
   in luton, 
  that explains it . 
  at the high level pharah is pretty much unplayable and unless you are talespin , a sub-optimal pick . 
  i was talking about pc , sorry . 
  50 is average . 
  yeah what i said was n't mathematically accurate . 
  he 's very bad at games and understanding mechanics quickly . 
  my mouse does n't having a working middle button so i ca n't delete any items from my inventory . 
  am i just overlooking something or is the key not rebindable ? 
  if you read marvel comics and have n't read or at least heard of dna 's cosmic run then i 'd be amazed . 
  i could n't in the end . 
  i had to plug in my xbox controller in order to delete anything . 
  the game does n't change resolution when i set it to 4k , still looks blurry just like 1080p . 
  it does n't change anything for me . 
  it 's so blurry because it 's upscaled from some pathetically low resolution . 
  his first 2 year ban was . 
  his second 8 year ban was for synthetic testosterone . 
  he is just better at dps than you are at support . 
  it 's bad players thinking that because they play support they should be ranked the same as better players . 
  why did solo get unbanned when the ibp players ban is permanent ? 
  where did they say the next people to match fix would be permabanned ? 
  just the double jump nerf is too much honestly , the ult nerf is the alone would be good in my opinion . 
  find me a single cs pro or analyst that has reacted positively to this change . 
  why would cs devs listen to reddit if they do n't even listen to the best cs players in the world ? 
  who have they kept out that deserves to replace them ? 
  muslims are n't a race . 
  having said that i do n't often go on / r/worldnews so i have no clue what is said . 
  he 's ok , still generally a sub-optimal pick outside of specific locations . 
  if you are getting killed by lucio consistently then you should just quit . 
  if a character has to be unintuitive to be balanced then he is a badly designed hero . 
  rather than rebalancing hanzo like this , they need to redesign him . 
  i was talking about hanzo . 
  i 've even said in another comment i do n't agree with removing triple jump . 
  he does n't have to hit his target to get kills . 
  i 'd recommend choosing a hero you like and googling a good reading order for them or looking in the sidebar of / r/comicbooks and / r/marvel . 
  it 's twitch chat , just ignore it or get bttv so you can block certain words . 
  it 's cool how many names you see from that on top ow teams . 
  winz was great but so was coolmatt . 
  well the tf2 comp scene never got any support from valve , it 's amazing it survived as long as it has . 
  did n't work so well for starcraft 2 in the end did it . 
  [ he is a filthy zionist , have n't you heard ? 
  ] ( https://twitter.com/adambienkov/status/767387385868976132?lang=en-gb ), 
  could n't you say the same about there being 2 dps ' so you only do part of the damage expected ? 
  but if all dps do more damage then the average you have to beat to rank up faster goes up so it cancels out . 
  a team that plays with 3-4 dps will derank quickly so assuming you are n't shit , you wo n't be compared to them . 
  honestly the whole thing is bad players thinking that because they play support they should be ranked higher better dps players . 
  they jumped off the train in a mass suicide pact . 
  the 970 came out in 2014 . 
  but he if he bought the 970 when it came it out he 'll have had it for two years , so he would be keeping it for more than a year . 
  maybe you make fun of them for that , that 's cool . 
  if you want to max out games at a higher resolution you are going to have to buy new graphics cards semi-regularly . 
  if you make fun out of them good for you . 
  if you ult when you are mid melee , the ult will take priority . 
  you still can . 
  what gpu do you have ? 
  you do n't need 2 monitors lol . 
  there was a [ thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/4zeqig/why_does_the_uk_have_such_a_big_productivity/ ) on / r/ukpolitics yesterday about it if you want to look there . 
  that last part is complete bollocks . 
  [ 33 years ago .

  i do n't see how that refutes what i said . 
  i 'd have to ask what 's wrong with you if you do n't look at america like that . 
  were you or are we ? 
  relatively it was . 
  they did n't say that . 
  what are your views on the human race , planet earth , the solar system and the universe ? 
  damn cis white scum . 
  bashing hillary clinton makes you alt-right ?

  which crimes are white people over-represented in ? 
  it wo n't let me open the link on my phone . 
  it 's the guardian , they are not going to miss a chance to bash england . 
  battlefield does n't have a big learning curve , its very casual . 
  blizzard seem only able to design maps that are just moving from one chokepoint to the next . 
  oh i agree they existed , i just highly doubt they existed in the 90s . 
   while chair of the home affairs select committee , mr vaz has publicly said he was `` not convinced '' that men who pay for sex should face prosecution .

  nobody was killed because they were involved in creating life of brian though . 
  i have n't claimed any of the children are n't children ?

  how much karma have you got out of that rose ?
