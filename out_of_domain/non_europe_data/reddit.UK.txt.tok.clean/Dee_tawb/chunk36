  i agree bale is a better player than alexis but if bale was at barcelona , he would n't start either would he ? 
  the story is told through the environment , if you are too lazy to look for yourself that is n't the games fault . 
  it should have a minimap and quest markers right . 
  games need to hold my hand because i 'm incapable of doing anything without instructions . 
  she asked for important questions about north korea and yet she does n't even know the gender of the president of south korea , let alone her name . 
  i wonder which part of your statement people disagree with . 
  what, 
  to take a screenshot you need to press volume down and the power button at the same time . 
  so they probably pressed volume down too early . 
  it 's a struggle . 
  these thugs are n't committing the crimes in the name of brexit though . 
  he 's got a tiny expenses though . 
  yes but his suit cost a tenner . 
  we give more than all but 2 countries and our spending as a % of gdp is 4th .

  there are others you can look up for yourself such as the ones from calderdale , banbury , halifax and petersborough . 
  the uploader says in the comments he has cosmetic damage toggled off . 
  i think punching the guy and knocking the knife out his hands would be . 
  if the man was unconscious after that , throwing his limp body into a canal might be hard to argue as self-defence . 
  for all intents and purposes sam is a replacement . 
  you do n't want a special relationship with sudan and bolivia ? 
  i 'd expect joint enterprise or some such . 
  nobody said it makes it ok . 
  iwobi needs to help him out . 
  shoot not boo, 
  reported , have fun with a # 300 fine . 
  so you mean there is no evidence of it occurring . 
  shut it blairite scum . 
  shut it you red tory . 
  shut it you commie marxist . 
  where are you off to ? 
  baby . 
  a lot of these events are pretty awful so i would n't recommend just buying all of them . 
  lol , you are responding in a chain of comments about this community being glad the game is n't on pc and yet those kind of `` wars '' do n't exist in your community ? 
  typical european colonialism . 
  what do you mean ? 
  this guy is definitely a redditor . 
  thanks . 
  she just keeps meandering . 
  i thought he passed out at one point . 
  i ca n't imagine the stress of teaching maths at a comprehensive . 
  i remember in year 9 we went through four teachers as they cracked one by one until we had a rotating stream of supply teachers for the last few months of the year . 
  bendis said on tumblr he did n't like the fact people made jokes about dick rider so changed it to ryder . 
  he knows how it spelled , he made the decision to spell it wrong . 
  well it is a very left wing subreddit . 
  '' skip you straight to the best weapons . '', 
  top kek m8 . 
  the flash is very good as well , admittedly a different style of show . 
  they had a much longer break between games which is the point , surely you can see that ? 
  [ it cost # 486 million before the west ham renovations . 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/olympics/15149865 ), 
  it 'll be even more than that as i know the conversions that they 've done to make it a football stadium cost a shit ton . 
  display . 
  yes , praise the school for allowing children to read newspapers . 
  yes , they ban tv , music , and newspapers because they worry about it being islamophobic . 
  it could n't possibly be to do with the `` strict sharia code '' could it ? 
  why tho . 
  was this a boarding school like the one in the article ? 
  i find it hard to believe phones/music on a walkman were n't allowed at a boarding school . 
  were you also threatened with those suspensions for talking to children of other schools ? 
  those are the rules at every school i know of , i do n't know any that prohibit mixing with outside students in your own time . 
  rolf harris , gary glitter and some radio/tv presenter i ca n't remember . 
  when he says women know too much so he goes for girls that do n't know that much , so sinister in hindsight . 
  films have built in motion blur , pause one and you 'll see the blur . 
  pause a game and you 'll see it 's a static image . 
  i remember when he was claiming all ancient egyptians were black . 
  he 's also a believer in contact between the olmec civilisation and west africa which has no basis in evidence . 
  he grew up on a council estate and became a barrister , he 's got a good story . 
  i hope he recovers . 
  apparently he was talking of defecting to the tories and the other ukip members did n't like that . 
  also for a position in the shadow cabinet it seems . 
  i 'm wrong . 
  if you compare britain to the rest of the world , then it is tolerant . 
  this video is sad , he complains about muslim rape gangs and that nobody does anything about it . 
  he 's not well spoken and because of that people just laughed and still do , look at this thread . 
  after the rotherham scandal came out , it 's very easy to see how you could construe that as a muslim rape gang . 
  it 's no wonder people flock to the far right when everyone just laughs at them . 
  i resent it . 
  yep , being wrong about other things does make it harder to take him seriously . 
  what disgusting racism , you bigot . 
  this subreddit is more leftwing than the labour subreddit , it 's crazy . 
  [ indeed . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xynzz2rczso ), 
  you 're downvoted for providing evidence to the contrary , wow . 
  you overestimate the number of people on this subreddit over 18 . 
  damn right , they should be browsing reddit for racist comments . 
  when people are killed for taking the piss most people stop doing it publicly . 
  5 of the american nobel prize winners for this year were born in the uk , it is n't new . 
  go tell a turkish person they are middle eastern , see how well it goes down .
