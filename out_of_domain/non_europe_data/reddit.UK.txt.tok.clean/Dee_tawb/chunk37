  is there evidence that within politics they are ? 
  that is n't logical . 
  all that shows is there are more male politicians than female , it does n't go into how they get the job , how many men vs women apply or any other involved factor . 
  all it tells you is more men than woman are involved in politics , nothing more . 
  there is a very unequal number of female nurses to male , is that evidence of institutional sexism ? 
  so it is n't evidence of current institutional sexism . 
  maybe you could address the first part of my first post , rather than going off on a tangent . 
  the interview on bbc radio 4 earlier today was depressing . 
  the vice-chair of the stwc ended the ended the interview shouting `` oppose the west ! '', 
  right . 
  `` kinder , gentler politics '', 
  having gone to a school full of people like this , at least one of them probably has a knife so it just is n't worth it . 
  there are reboots every couple of years for both so they are n't that hard to get into . 
   who is he, 
  owen jones without the brains . 
  once you reach br15 you get all your certs back so you can redistribute them . 
  it takes an hour to reach br15 so it 's not at issue . 
  i 'm saying if you desperately needed those benefits you could easily get them in a short amount of time . 
  if you are that heavily invested into a character then a 1500 cert refund is nothing . 
  not defending the assault but it did n't cause his death . 
  if you read the article you see he died from `` positional asphyxia and intoxication through consumption of alcohol , methadone and cannabis '' unrelated to the assault . 
  i apologise if i do n't know the monolithic stands of all remainers . 
  `` sentencing dunne , judge martin rudland said of duncan keating 's death : `` grave consideration has been given between this event , and that tragic death , and the consultant pathologist has concluded his death was due to matters unrelated to the assault . '' '', 
  i 'm sure you know better . 
  i agree martin rudland showed he did . 
  in what way could a random redditor know the cause of death better than the pathologist ? 
  lmao what . 
  compared to this sub it still is relatively balanced . 
  currently the top post is a negative one about brexit , if it was still raided it would n't be on 89 % upvoted . 
  in my opinion , the reason it has a right wing bias is due to the most charismatic and popular posters , like lolworth , all being right-wing . 
  france and italy are being barrel bombed , tragic . 
  [ `` children '' . 
  ] ( http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/10/17/13/397565f700000578-3843900-image-a-4_1476707689957.jpg ), 
  that 's a child , mine is an image of multiple `` children '' . 
  maybe he is older looking because he is older ? 
  the leaked name `` legends of the west '' worries me when you look at with this picture . 
  i hope they do n't go down a forced multiplayer route . 
  alt-right politics , luckily , do n't have a real chance of taking hold in the uk . 
  that 's no way to talk about children !, 
  definitely what you think and take away when you look at this post . 
  you do realise there a lot of these sex abuse gangs ? 
  justice for the angles ? 
  of course it is important to remember the majority of pakistani muslims are as horrified about these cases as you or i am . 
  however , denying these communities have issues with this is dangerous . 
  there are unfortunately many cases , commited by members of the same groups around the country . 
  [ a report ] ( http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/uk/crime/article2863058.ece ) by the times details the extent of the issue . 
  of the 56 offenders convicted since 1997 for crimes relating to on-street grooming of girls aged 11 to 16 , three were white , 53 were asian of which 50 were muslim , and most were from the british pakistani community . 
  this is only for convictions in the north and midlands . 
  however the problem is widespread around the country , not confined geographically to the north . 
  [ this is the telford sex gang . 
  ] ( http://www.shropshirestar.com/news/crime/2013/05/10/horror-of-telford-girls-sex-abuse-ordeal/ ), 
  [ this is the bristol sex gang . 
  ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/nov/27/guilty-prostitution-bristol-rape-girls-sex-abuse-somali ), 
  [ this is one of the rochdale grooming gangs ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/may/09/rochdale-child-sex-ring-jailed ) and [ this is another one convicted this year ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-35651366 ), 
  [ here 's the oxford grooming gang ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-oxfordshire-31643791 ) they are thought to have abused 373 children . 
  [ here 's the derby grooming gang ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/8157739/asian-gang-prowled-streets-searching-for-rape-victims.html ), 
  there are others you can look up for yourself such as the ones from calderdale , banbury , halifax and petersborough . 
  so you do n't deny the pakistani muslim community has issues with these types of grooming gangs , that 's good . 
  denial only leads to cover-up and that has happened in the past with these . 
  he 's won 2 leadership elections , he 's obviously electable . 
  remind me how many times the people voted for theresa may ? 
  almost every single marvel character is toned down for movies . 
  cap can [ dodge bullets ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ushgj6q.jpg ) , there is literally no way for 76 to damage him . 
  as long as cap has his shield then 76 still has no way to hurt him , even movie cap . 
  seamus milne wrote it ? 
  lmao no he is n't . 
  twitter is n't a reliable source . 
  rumours beforehand were the tablet is 720p and the docked version is 1080p/60fps or 4k/3fps . 
  how could he be incompetent yet have a great big whopping mandate at the same time ? 
  does n't make any sense . 
  comrade corbyn has proven his electability by winning not one , but two leadership elections . 
  labour would be trading blows with the fascist tories if not for blairites infighting . 
  the fbi only released the pictures to get people to stop witchhunting after innocent people . 
  they did n't initially release any images of suspects . 
  edit : this guy does a good rundown https://www.reddit.com/r/misc/comments/1cuj7p/how_close_were_we_to_finding_the_boston_bombers/c9k6nqy, 
  i did not ever see a post like this . 
  labour party has the highest membership in the world , close to 28 million , if everyone of us votes we will surely win . 
  it 's probably [ qgyh2 ] ( https://www.reddit.com/user/qgyh2 ) . 
  if i remember correctly he was even the first redditor to 100k karma . 
  he posted so much content it was n't rare to look at our homepage and half of the posts were by him . 
  first guy i remember at least . 
  what 's a thread ? 
  tastes very strange !, 
  the xbox version ran at 720p while the ps3 version ran at a measly 640p . 
  those kind of people are just scum , the worst part is they ca n't even see anything wrong with what they are doing . 
  the audience yesterday was god awful . 
  it 's one of the poorest towns in the uk sadly . 
  it is n't a left turn only lane . 
  left wing is good while right-wing is bad ? 
  or do you mean something different ? 
  france is war torn i guess , it 's why they are so desperate to leave there . 
  he died before original sin because you first see his corpse with iron man and the watcher standing over it on the moon in new avengers # 8 . 
  yes comrade !, 
  these blairite polls mean nothing . 
  in what way is it semantics ? 
  they stopped putting them up outside london in 2005 so i can see why he thought that . 
  the man did n't know the boy was in the driveway , it was careless not malicious . 
  you got me . 
  yeah saying it was n't malicious probably is n't the right term . 
  more that he did n't intend to harm any of children .
