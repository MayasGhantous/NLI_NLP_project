  tony ben , famous daily mail believer . 
  you can still get the origin characters as squad members . 
  did they steal any lidl bags ? 
  honestly those kids in manchester deserved it , very aggressive bunch of girls tbh . 
  so the attack earlier this year in sweden was due to their imperialist meddling ? 
  obviously we are there because of the imperialist ottoman empire . 
  i 'm actually more surprised by how few attacks there are in the muslim world . 
  bearing in mind the wholesale slaughter they conducted in the christian world . 
  not excusing terrorists must mean i 'm worried about arabs conquering us ... what ? 
  the only genocide that occurred there was the genocide committed by saddam hussein in iraq against the kurdish people living there in the 1980s . 
  wars are n't genocides , as much as you might want them to be when it is western nations doing the invading . 
  we did n't genocide the germans when we beat them in world war 2 despite killing many of them , deaths = / = genocide . 
  i have no faith in el neny . 
  when you march alongside neo-nazis , befriend neo-nazis and shout neo-nazi slogans it 's not that ridiculous to call him a fascist . 
  it makes sense if you want it to make sense . 
  this rat park is often brought up but it comes with a large number of methodological flaws and just straight up falsehoods . 
  it 's dumb to downplay the role of the drug in addiction like that video does , there 's a reason it 's heroin and not apples people get addicted to . 
  most importantly though , the rat park experiment has never been successfully replicated , ever . 
  in similar experiments , social interaction has led to increased drug use , not less . 
  hollywood might have told you that but there is no evidence soldiers were ever sent to the front without rifles/equipment . 
  anne frank was sheltered by a dutch family , no germans were involved in hiding her . 
  not much to say bar what they title says . 
  quicksell , add me for trade . 
  steam id is http://steamcommunity.com/id/cakeface1/, 
  for me , it would have to be herod the great . 
  if only to save him from the god awful death he died , seriously nobody deserves to die like that .
