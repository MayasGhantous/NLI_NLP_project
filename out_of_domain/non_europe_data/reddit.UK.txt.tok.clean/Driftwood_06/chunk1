quick question , why is wales to dependent on the eu ? 
  i personally hope arya will follow a different story arc to the goings on in westeros . 
  she 's never really been a ` part ' of the main storyline since the start . 
  putting her back in would feel awkward and almost forced . 
  as to everyone else , only grrm himself knows, 
  it 's all really stemmed from john major ( pm at the time ) not giving a referendum to the maastricht treaty in 1993 ( which many people see as the treaty which led to the beginnings of the eu as we see today ) . 
  not if the new pm/government is radically different to the one people elected in 2015 . 
  the tory party will have no choice but to call another election to gain the mandate of the people . 
  only the difference is gordon brown was already chancellor of the exchequer before he was raised up as pm . 
  if boris or gove ( who are arguably more radical members of the party ) became pm , it would be a very different tory party and therefore the mandate gained in 2015 would be lost . 
  under law it does n't matter what you sign your name with ( it can be a dot for all that matters ) as long as people know you have signed it . 
  true there are many blairite members in the party who want him out , but it 's not * all * blairites . 
  many left wing ministers have resigned also . 
  he tried to unify the party and allow both the central and left side to work together , but he flat out ** failed ** and the members should see that and vote him out . 
  the labour party is n't just the hard left , blair changed that to make the party finally electable ; it 's both the centre left and traditional left . 
  at least ed miliband was able to unify the party going into a ge . 
  at this rate the party might actually lose more than in 2015 given how divided they are . 
  so basically a blairite haha, 
  or maybe chukka unumna could stand up and deliver a strong unifying voice to the left and the centre ? 
  all i know is that whoever it is , they will have a hard job at tackling corbyn and will most likely have to be a fresh face/someone who is n't tainted at all with normal westminster politics . 
  haha i do n't think the lib dems have much to smile about, 
  [ it 's an older meme ] ( https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-bhf7kwy6hry/vsmivvvhuri/aaaaaaaaam8/xhnnb7w_9gq/s1600/11148472_10152985861102562_5397261049151335014_n.jpg ), 
  given the recent plp support for angela eagle i think we wont have a half decent leader for some time, 
   she will not hold an election until 2020, 
  honestly for the labour party , this may be the best option . 
  if there was another election in the next year , i could honestly see labour losing ** more ** to both the snp , ukip and the tories in some swing areas , especially given how shoddy the plp have been recently and the failure of corbyn to unite the party in any sense . 
  that would be such an amazing video . . 
  the grey area is the fact that it is very unclear whether gambling for skins counts as ` true gambling ' in the eyes of the law . 
  i agree . 
  blair is deservedly receiving a lot of what comes at him , but please do remember all the great things the government in 1997-2005 was able to do under blair . 
  he managed to pass the hra in parliament , make the boe independent , chose to not join the euro , devolved scotland , ni and wales , introduced a national minimum wage and many other things . 
  i do n't believe his foreign policy decisions were good at all , but domestically he did a great job in pushing through some much needed reform with his majority rule . 
  for the record i 'm not a blairite by any means , but i do value the fact that he managed secure 3 labour majorities in parliament , getting the tories out of power . 
  the area which they went to ( which is pretty small ) is a lot like that but most of bristol is n't like that ( it was voted as the green capital of europe i think in 2014, 
  it 's like any large cities , there 's some nice areas and some poorer areas . 
  bristol tends to have a lot of graffiti ( see banksy ) but if you go north it has loads of nice parks/shops . 
  running at a loss is generally a ` good ' thing in business , ie companies such as amazon run their whole business models without gaining any profit . 
  it 's how much they are growing which is important ( financially ) , not as much how much per annum they are making . 
  great ` article ' though , although i do n't think many people in / r/yogscast will exactly understand what you are saying haha . 
  it 's mainly the area where yogtowers is , although bristol is known for it 's artsty graffiti ( see banksy ), 
  i would n't exactly say st pauls is n't the most safe of places in bristol, 
  yogtowers is in st paul 's which is known as one of the worst areas in bristol . 
  there 's a lot nicer places in bristol , especially up north, 
  for the record jarvis has decided not to stand in any leadership election because he still wants to properly raise his young children . 
  given what the press is like these days ( see chukka unumna 's first 3 days of his leadership ` campaign ' ) , i honestly do n't blame him . 
  hopefully excel wo n't be as slow now , although i 've never really had any issues with word . 
  i would assume the lists are `` public '' per se , so every so often they can check if a person is registered with two parties and then blacklist them ? 
  the problem with corbyn is that he is a very strong character , but only on the policies he 's passionate about . 
  anything which he has to compromise on ( e.g staying in the eu ) he is completely half arsed about and that 's what worries me . 
  a pm needs to , above all , compromise with both their own party and the opposition when leading . 
  we do n't live in a country which has a dictatorship , nor one which chooses it 's own leader directly ( see the us ) . 
  edit : for the record though , i do n't think i would pick angela eagle over corbyn ( or at least i 'm not sure yet ) . 
  she would be a step backwards in unifying the party since she would compromise * too much * with the plp and leave the members behind . 
  i would like to see a stronger character stand up against corbyn who can unify both the left and the centre left ( perhaps jarvis or unumna one day ) . 
  what makes you think that ? 
  to be fair to him , he has voted against university tuition fees and seems to be a strong campaigner for equal rights at the moment . 
  i 'm not sure where this ` right wing ' feeling has come . 
  being pro business does n't really mean being right wing ? 
  you mean cmp 's ? 
  can you explain why they are so bad ? 
  they do know what they are being charged for as per recent court rulings ( they are allowed to know the jist of the case and what allegations are being brought against them ), 
  they all have special security cleared advocates , under which they amount defenses against the client . 
  cmps do n't amount to a criminal charge , only for issuing tpims for suspicion of a charge . 
  source : see cases or af and mb recently in the supreme court questioning the use of cmps . 
  why ca n't they be pro business and pro worker ? 
  remember that the world has completely changed since kier hardie made the party ; there are n't any coal mines anymore and many more work in business than in ` traditional labour ' . 
  see the cases of mb , af and a for sources , especially mb where the law is clarified . 
  people are being given a defence ? 
  and why should the public need to know about proceedings ( some of which is highly sensitive ) which only constitute suspicion and not even a charge ? 
  i trust the law . 
   i do n't trust our politicians, 
  but i do trust our judges , and they enforce the rules when it comes to cmps . 
  can you give one instance where the judiciary has been immoral or completely wrong ? 
  i highly doubt they expected him to stay standing after a whitewash of a no confidence vote against him and almost the whole of his shadow cabinet resigning . . 
  currently studying law ( in 2nd year ) . 
  i admit it may take a wrong turn at points , but it always comes to the most common sense and fair conclusion in the end ( see the recent law on joint enterprise in criminal law ) . 
  we can only pray the thick of it comes back, 
  you can see lot of the videos in general done around owen have more work put into it from casey ; it 's definitely more a labour of love when he gets to show off his kid to the world . 
  to be fair , coalitions on that level have only really been considered in times of real national crisis ( the one in 1931 was after the wall street crash in 1929-the biggest recession to ever hit the country and probably will ever hit the country given how unprepared anyone was ) . 
  brexit may be seen as a `` crisis '' to some , but the tories are looking more and more like the party which is `` getting the job done '' at the moment , regardless of divisions . 
  good luck man !, 
  maybe the worst case scenario would be getting to a 2008 situation , but i do n't think you understand the extent to which the economy literally imploded in 1929-1930 and how it will never happen again on that scale . 
  here 's just a few of the key differences between the beginning of the 20th century and today :, 
  we had just come from a world war , meaning thousands were already out of a job in areas such as munitions , the coal barons did not modernise at all and we had crippling debt from the war . 
  we had lost a generation in a workforce . 
  also , banks back in the 1930 's had absolutely no idea how to handle modern debt ; the idea of credit finance was completely new and alien to most . 
  we had only just invented fiscal policy at the time as well . 
  also , it does n't seem likely that art. 50 will be triggered at any point before significant negotiations have already been made ( since we now have may instead of leadsom ) so there could be stability in invoking art. 50 , as long as the correct deals have been put in place . 
  felt ... weirdly reassuring for someone who is a labour supporter . 
  it definitely sets a more central tone for her premiership , a welcome one after the right wing policies floated around by people like leadsom and gove . 
  although i would prefer to see labour in power by 2020 , i do feel as though she wo n't do a worse job compared to cameron . 
  although , time will tell to see whether she can be more progressive as a tory , especially with a resurgence of the right wing from the threat of ukip . 
  i would say owen smith has pretty close views as corbyn , and he seems to be supported by the plp to some extent . 
  well to be fair the only policies we have seen from her are on a home office stance , so you ca n't exactly judge her against cameron in that regard . 
  we have no idea what her social , foreign or economic policies may be . 
  i am cautiously optimistic from her speech , moreso from the fact that she has never been a `` old boys club does favours for one another '' person like gove . 
  do you have any sources for those claims ? 
  if you actually read the article it says ( on the nhs ) :, 
  ' i think if their involvement means in any way , shape or form the break up of the nhs , then i 'm not a fan of it , but i do n't think it does ' . 
  for me that does n't say ` in favour of privatisation ' at all , and frankly i do n't think any labour mp is in favour of the privatisation of the nhs ; it 's the cornerstone of the party and the nation .
