  whether you agree with that or not is a different argument . 
  given that so many people voted for a conservative government in 2015 , perhaps it might be a good idea to persuade the people who voted for a right leaning party to vote further left no ? 
  the main aim is to look towards swing constituencies , and most of them are in the english `` middle england '' centralist areas , where they either vote centre right ( cameron ) or centre left ( blair ) . 
  since scotland is now off the table because of the snp and the new constituency changes will ensure labour loses at least 50 seats , appealing to these swing states is more important than ever to ensure that labour goes back into power . 
  oh trust me , you * wish * that your son got up that early when he gets to high school age . . 
  the last sentence is the most important here , nobody will have an idea of what the real options on the table are for brexit until christmas , so all of these stories are mainly conjecture and political talk to appease the masses . 
  there may be a lot of options at the moment , but the key word which i used was * real * options . 
  may might have all these options but the fact is that she does n't know how realistic any of them are until she starts formally negotiating with the rest of the eu over them to see how much push and shove she can get . 
  goddamn it mike !, 
  i was actually optimistic this episode that the plotline would move forward ... watching this cemented to me that the writers have no idea what to do anymore . 
  shh the mods might be listening . . 
  massive respect to you , it 's a well written article and , even though you may have burned your bridges with riot , you have at least gained a few more fans by putting your neck on the line like this . 
  esports needs more journalists like you . 
  do you have a link for that ? 
  i 'd love to see that, 
  the others like thoorin are pretty sub-optimal , spends all their time and money from lol on other esports . 
  if it gets bad enough , may can easily stop this by sacking hunt and making a less bad contract for the junior docs that the bma is happy with . 
  she 's just seeing how far she can go until she is forced to ( if ever ) hit the `` sack hunt '' button , since he is very useful to do her dirty work . 
  first time i 've watched one of these , i really like it markz ; short and sweet but packed with a lot of really interesting analysis . 
  pictures like this remind me that no matter how many times i go to london and think i know the city , i really do n't . . 
  a 30 second loop of trump saying the word `` china '', 
  maybe i 'm in the minority , but what 's wrong with having middle class mps standing up for the working class ? 
  some of the most prominent labour pm 's in our time were n't working class . 
  as long as they support labour values , i do n't see why anyone , from working class to upper class , ca n't be a labour mp . 
  you can see what it 's like when comms go badly if you see champ select . . that was chaotic at best . 
  any courtroom scene . 
  i can assure you that in real life you would be happy if even 0.1 % of the excitement and drama occurs in a courtroom like some movies . 
  i try not to use the tube anyway , i become so much happier when i walk to work now since i can actually take in this wonderful city , even if it takes an extra 20mins . 
  make sure to travel all around london , not just the centre !, 
  there 's so much to see it 's easy to just stay in your ` own ' area of the city , make sure to explore more than anything !, 
  yes . 
  it 's a lot more comfortable for the palms/fingers once you learn . 
  it 's like riding a bike , once you get the hang of it , you will be completely fine . 
  99c/99p stores would have a hard time . 
  aside from that , hardly anyone would probably even notice . 
  not a glamorous story , but i almost got hit by a car going ~ 100mph on a random day walking on a crossing . 
  thinking about when it happened , i was so blas\u00e9 and just shrugged my shoulders and walked on . 
  i 'm sure that if i did n't leave home one second later than i did , i would 've 100 % died ... 
  definitely not , but he `` pays '' for it in all the free sponsorship boosted gets for casey showing it in every vid possible . 
  how did you manage to keep the motivation to grind that many hours day in day out after consistently being kicked/placing badly in the playoffs ? 
  also , what were the contrasts from working in cw to sk to gambit , and finally to h2k ? 
  i dunno , it 's more likely that ados will either be 1 . rushed or 2 . not the final book of the series given he has just written himself into way too many issues . 
  i always just skip his scenes these days , they just are n't interesting whatsoever . 
  well to be fair to him , there was a lot more pressing issues going on as soon as he got elected , such as the beginning of the second worst financial collapse in history . 
  he really should 've closed it by now , but politics is a game of compromise and he wanted to focus his tenure on things like obamacare and green energy . 
  now whilst i agree he should 've pushed more to close guantanamo , you have to understand that a president has hugely less powers than a prime minister does in the uk . 
  a prime minister is ( almost ) always elected with a majority in the commons , meaning that any bill he made in the manifesto can usually be easily passed through both houses . 
  obama probably had the hardest time out of any president in the us , given he had a congress * and * senate who made sure that anything that he wished to do would not be passed . 
  he had to pretty much choose only two things to focus on throughout his first four years , and he managed to get a huge stimulus to sort out the economy and he managed to pass the first ** ever ** free heathcare bill in the us . 
  in his last four years , he never had a majority in either congress or senate and yes , he could 've done an executive order , but the democratic implications of that are wide spread and he had other more pressing concerns on his agenda , such as the need ( in his mind ) to commit resources towards fighting the terrorist threat and create a green energy deal . 
  at the end of the day , he himself probably regrets not closing it when he had enough support in 2009 to do it , but at the end of the day he 's only human and had probably the hardest job in the entire world to do . 
  i heard from one uber driver that there 's apparently 50,000 registered drivers around london . 
  i 've never had any issues with finding ubers at any time of day so i would n't worry . 
  the problem there is killing yourself . 
  there would be no gun or anything to give you the quick kill . 
  the most you would have is a razor blade to slowly cut yourself with while hoping you bleed out fast enough to die before the paramedics come and save you . . and then you end up in the ministry of love . . 
  yeah i think i 'd rather be a prole in this situation . 
  well as you go to the upper members of the party , they seem to have a lot more freedom e.g being able to turn off the telescreens . 
  it would n't be the best life , but you would be able to get away with pretty much anything you wanted as long as you kept the party image in public . 
  i 'd probably trade with one of the tarly 's ( instead of samwell ) if i had to , they seem to be the only family who has it pretty good at the moment . 
  make sure to keep your head down and work hard in school , trust me once you get into university/sixth form getting good grades will make you more popular if anything . 
  it 's gon na be a 3-2 , but who knows which team is gon na clinch it to be honest . 
  so happy to see ambition finally make it to worlds . 
  i was shocked that he did n't make it in s2 , when he narrowly lost to najin sword . 
  in s3 i was stunned , given how blaze was such a great team at the time , at one point winning 19 straight games in a row in the most competitive region . 
  season 4 was rougher but neo-blaze seemed to still be a force to be reckoned with , but it was clear that ambition was just not as good a midlaner as pawn/dade/faker . 
  season 5 saw even worse results and i was expecting him to retire at this point . 
  for him to come back in season 6 , with a new role * not on cj * , on a team full of rejects , and go through the gauntlet ** finally ** after so many years does make me happy . 
  let 's hope he actually does well now he 's finally gotten here . 
  as a future lawyer who 's researched a lot about the profession , i 'd say the quality of career * s * you can do outside of the profession makes it worthwhile to go to law school . 
  i know of people who have gone to accountancy , investment banking , journalism and many other interesting careers outside of just the legal industry . 
  in terms of a legal career , even that 's pretty diverse and pretty much depends on what grade you get at the end of law school . 
  if you come out with a 2.1 / 1st you 're going to be able to find an interesting , well paid and satisfying job no matter where you go in the industry . 
  if you get a 2.2 or below ... you may end up in some really boring and rough jobs that barely pay for how much you have put in . 
  edit : to preface this i 'm from a ** uk ** based background , any other countries may be completely different . 
  i 'd say if you 're looking at law firms , there 's a much greater drive from the top ones to recruit from ` lesser unis ' . ive seen trainees from birmingham , manchester , leeds , lancaster , cardiff and loads of other non top unis . 
  and yeah you 're right i 'm from the uk so i guess law school is more of a degree of critical thinking which can be applied to any other discipline really . 
  i 'm from the uk so i 'm not sure how us law school works , but i 've ** never ** heard of a law firm which uses computers instead of solicitors , or chambers which use computers instead of barristers . 
  maybe paralegals might be replaced at some point , but it does n't seem to be a development to be coming in a while , and besides a paralegal is meant to be a stepping stone point to become a solicitor . 
  in terms of everything else you said , again i do n't have the relevant knowledge but in the uk law is a pretty easy degree to switch to other disciplines and at max it costs around # 27k for tuition ( like any other degree ) . 
  there 's a much greater chance of people who get a decent grade ( like i said in the previous post ) to get into a decent regional or top law firm in london these days . 
  i 've been to a few vac schemes and seen more and more students from unis like manchester , since it seems more `` diverse '' for firms to employ people from there ( looking at firms like norton rose fulbright or lovells ) . 
  i know though that firms like slaughters/freshfields can be a bit too `` only oxbridge etc '' though . 
  i 'd wholeheartedly agree with you in relation to chambers though , looking at sets i hardly see anyone outside of oxbridge , let alone lse/ucl/durham / bristol . 
  i guess they were just a bit overshadowed by a massively dominant skt and koo who were the only team to really challenge skt . 
  true , but to be fair to najin they manage to take a ridiculously dominant skt to 5 games where we could 've almost seen them as s3 champions . 
  that 's probably the best option for the uk at the moment to be shoehorned into ttip , and then enjoy the benefits of border controls coming into the uk . 
  i 'm a 3rd year and still debating on taking the tc from nrf/hsf or taking a masters and giving the bar a try . 
  i think i 'm gon na try for the bar but it 's so demoralising seeing all the statistics about e.g 75 % of btpc applicants not getting pupillage , but i think it 's worth a shot and if it fails i can always reapply for a tc in the future after masters ( i 'm from bristol myself so i think i have n't got a horrible chance but it 's still not great ) . 
  i would definitely not worry at all in terms of wanting a tc but being from a `` lesser uni '' though , in all honesty firms like nrf at least ( i know more and more firms are doing this too , but nrf is the biggest example of a top firm doing this ) are actively looking for the non-oxbridge type and just want people who others will get along with who have the all important * commercial awareness * and 2.1 ( does n't matter if its 60 or 69 , they literally do n't care ) . 
  at least sorsby is n't around . 
  cj managed to take skt to five games in a cinderella story semi finals , but cj in summer was pretty poor compared to jin air , koo , kt and skt who were doing much better . 
  i can say to my grandchildren that i was alive at the time the donezo manifesto was released . 
  i do n't think something like that will happen ever again with that magnitude of memeage . 
  i guess it 's just his new `` style '' now , the old casey is pretty much gone and he probably prefers this vlog type of video . 
  it 's truly the mecca of lol memes . 
  maybe in the tv series , but it would be a grrm esque plot twist to happen in the books . 
  the timewinder can be very useful in events like g20 . 
  if only deficio was also casting , those two work so well together , especially in these long clown fiesta games . 
  sub-optimal meme right there .
