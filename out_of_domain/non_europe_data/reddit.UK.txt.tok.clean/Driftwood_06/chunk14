  curse.eu taking down m5 as one of the few teams to ever do this . 
  fnc dominating ipl5 ( the best tournament in league history imo ) with a 16yr old unknown adc after not even qualifying for worlds . 
  clg being crowdfunded to dreamhack and then beat m5 in what people call the best game in lol history ( debatable now ) and then go to korea and then almost win ogn summer with a diana pocket pick . 
  fnc go on in post season iem to win vs sk in the xpeke famous backdoor with kassadin which is now renowned . 
  tsm vs clg vs dig the whole year , with curse still in contention after the dramatic split of saintvicious and elementz to curse and voyboy to clg . 
  tsm wins all the na tournaments whilst clg goes to korea and gets shat on . 
  there 's streaming controversy with clg and purple side strats only from chauster , there 's dyrus trying to solocarry tsm in worlds and there 's dig 's scrims being leaked by dyrus ( never forget ) . 
  curse narrowly loses out on worlds and thus begins the 4th place meme . 
  clg recruits locodoco out of all people for support and doublelift plays one of the best tournaments of his life in ipl5 , despite him playing with a dogshit support . 
  we begin the wait for the clg documentary and see aphro and link ( a promising new midlaner ) join clg and the hype/faith train begins . 
  china :, 
  i do n't know too much here in comparison , but we see the misaya play first used with tf from misaya himself , and we begins the undefeated dominance in ipl5 which can only be compared to skt 's run in post season 3 . 
  we is also famously known for playing the series between clg which lasted 2 days ( due to technical difficulties ) in worlds . 
  again , i do n't know much about this , but we have the miracle gauntlet run by najin which beat azb and led maknoon to go to his first ( and last ) worlds . 
  azf was the best team in the world at the time , yet we saw the closest series between clg and azf in the summer finals , with them coming back from a 2-0 deficit in 3 crazy games . 
  i could go on and talk about tales of the lane , ipl5 , worlds and many more tournaments in depth , more specifically the rise and fall of tpa , but i think that 's enough storyline to show that lcs is ** nothing ** compared to what was going on in s2 ; not even close . 
  my time machine malfunctioned for a second , thanks for getting it back to where it 's meant to be . 
  the 100 % worst group to be in would be edg , skt , g2 and c9 . 
  all those teams can take games on each other and even my crystal ball would not be able to predict how that would go , especially since skt have not been looking so hot . 
  the most dominant group would be rox , g2 , imay , anx , mainly since rox and g2 would just shit on everyone in that group . 
  tsm 's best chance is actually in the draw i 'm predicting , given imay do n't play spoiler and take a game off tsm . 
  remember that tsm need to get first for any chance of getting into semis and having a chance at worlds . 
  reposting from another thread , but i have seen the future and i know the group draws already , i embrace the karma that this will bring me when you all catch up in two hours :, 
  i am the prophet , kneel before me . 
  edit : rip , i apologise my disciples , i saw too far into the future . 
  i just wanted to see a group reaction like last year with loco and regi celebrating and then realising that they ended up in the group of death . 
  well he was 0-3 in s3 worlds , and then 3-1 in s4 worlds , perhaps this is the year they go 3-2 ? 
  i would never lie to reddit , for i am :, 
  driftwood_06 , team reddit alliance coach , specialist armchair analyst , editor of the donezo manifesto , bane of thooorin and tsm/fnc fan ( only when they are winning ) . 
  i ** am ** / r/leagueoflegends, 
  i could see the possibility of c9 taking a game off of skt , and maybe edg if they play at their absolute best . 
  it 's unlikely , but stranger things have happened in groups ( all taking a perfect game on a korean team and simultaneously lose to a brazilian team is one of the highlights ) . 
  you will almost certainly disagree with me here , but at least for catholic/christian faith schools , the majority , if not many focus ( especially in classes such as re ) on the need to care for one another , be a good person and teach general christian values of kindness . 
  coming from a catholic school background ( despite being agnostic myself ) there was never any pressure to be religious or anything of the sort , but the values that are focused are much more centered around being a good person , rather than just doing well in exams . 
  whether it is needed in our society i am unsure , but as long as there is a want from the people ( and more importantly , the electorate ) to maintain faith schools , they will remain . 
  being a `` lawyer '' means you pass the bar and qualify . 
  just doing a law degree means you have jd at the end of your name or can call yourself a law student . 
  there 's serious implications out there for calling yourself a lawyer and doing business as one whilst not actually being qualified , just watch suits as an example . 
  publically funded faith schools is a bit strange to be honest , they should either be funded privately or by the church these days . 
  i guess as long as people send them to faith schools over normal comprehensives , then i guess people are in favour of them . 
  mind that most faith schools do actually have better resources than normal comprehensives ( that i know ) because of the church funding and extra religious funding from other sources . 
  ok so it 's going to be more of a case by case basis , rather than a straight rule , that seems fair . 
  this does seem like a new ruling and the mods should really look into making sure people , especially pros and content creators , understand that rt ` ing a thread in connection to them will be vm . 
  i do n't agree exactly to the ` rule ' , since it 's very hard to end up drawing the line when it gets to that grey area and can lead to people getting annoyed , but i understand why the rule is being made . 
  thanks for the clarity . 
  i think the best reaction was c9 after hearing jatt mentioning that balls was d2 . 
  if tsm takes first seed too , i could see them beating h2k , c9 , fw or maybe g2 , meaning a semis finish . 
  although , i ca n't see them beating rox so lets hope they dodge the bullet there . 
  rng has been doing absolute shit in china btw , compared to g2 who has been dominant in europe . 
  imo tarly would n't get involved unless absolutely necessary . 
  he 's always been very much isolated in the seven kingdoms . 
  although some people regard this as a hard group for tsm , i actually think , given the circumstances this is the easiest group to * get first * . 
  a group without top contenders like g2 or skt in pool2 is just what tsm needs to make sure that they get 1st seed and then go to semis . 
  the only problem in this group is ssg , since nobody is sure how good they actually are . 
  ned strongly believed in the law of succession , and since stannis was the true successor , it 's strongly assumed that ned would support stannis . 
  also , stannis only took up melissandre to gain the iron throne , he had no religious beliefs in the red god . 
  if he gained the iron throne due to the alliance of the north , i doubt he would antagonise his best ally by burning the godswood . 
  honestly , if they manage to dodge rox in semis i 'd say tsm has a 50/50 chance of advancing into the finals . 
  that however is dependent on them playing like they did in the semis vs clg , not their sub optimal play against c9 in the finals where the nerves really did get to them . 
  i 'm triggered . 
  well in the western broadcast ... yeah they are for sure . 
  most of the talk last year was about fnc and og in the semis , with hardly as much on skt or koo . 
  if tsm get first seed ( 100 % needed ) , imo they * can * ( not will , but there 's definitely a possibility ) beat h2k , g2 , c9 or fw ( all the possible seen 2nd seeds ) . 
  from that , then it 's just seeing how they perform against skt edg or rox . 
  i 'm pretty convinced it will be skt and fw , with maybe c9 upsetting ( hopefully ) , but imay has just looked pretty weak in china , same as rng so i 'm not expecting much . 
  in terms of tsm 's chances of getting 1st seed in group d , it 's gon na be tough , but it 's the best chance out of all the groups to get 1st seed . 
  they played pretty well vs g2 in the finals , and they 've been playing like the no. 2 team in europe for most of the split , so i 'd say they have a decent shot of second place if they improve fast enough . 
  i dunno man ... they played like shit recently in china . 
  they just have 0 synergy as a team and will need to do some serious bootcamping to beat tsm who is quite a cohesive team . 
  underrated comment of the thread here . 
  just because someone votes brexit does n't mean they are for trump ... 
  what would happen in a hypothetical scenario that hilary ( god forbid ) died in lets say october or november , a few days before polling day . 
  would the election be postponed , with bernie reinstated as the nominee , or would trump get auto elected ? 
  that seems pretty undemocratic if the latter happened . 
  that 's like saying i 'd put more money on muslims supporting isis than christians . 
  it may be true , but it creates the wrong correlations . 
  lol i guess we 'll see if your statement is correct in a few weeks time . 
  it 's very hard to find out how the regions match up against each other with there only being msi where g2 did n't even practice . 
  lets just hope this one does n't get taken down like the stixxay and aphro one . . 
  to be fair , it 's not as if it 's just labour losing it 's seats . 
  osborne is losing his too . 
  also , it 's not as if corbyn wo n't be able to find another seat to take instead in a safe labour seat given his popularity . 
  these boundary changes do need to happen , the hoc is way too full as it is . 
  hopefully this wo n't screw up labour too much though , although i fear it may do them more harm than good . 
  edit : reminder that the tories would never want to oust corbyn , he 's their greatest asset at the moment given how they are currently up 11 points . 
  the hoc is way too oversized as it is , and was never intended to have 650 seats , moreso 300 max . 
  the main reason however is that you just do n't need 650 mp 's in parliament . 
  the situation today is that the majority of backbenchers end up doing fuck all and get a salary for doing the odd consituency job . 
  take for example jeremy corbyn pre-2015 . 
  everything he did in the party he could 've done as an activist e.g attending rallies , campaigning outside of parliament for stopping the war . 
  as a backbencher ( for the fact that he did oppose pretty much everything that labour put their name on ) he got no time of day . 
  having less mp 's = more time for each mp to actually get time of day in parliament and * do something * , since that 's what they are there for . 
  it 's chance for him to now get peerage anyway , given how much good he 's done for the tory party in getting them back into power and getting a majority . 
  i 'd say it 's almost guarenteed . 
  i may have not liked his policies or anything , but he was at his best at pmqs smacking down ed miliband and co , and then ripping into corbyn like it was nothing . 
  just a [ few ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2u5r6ka4nlc ) great moments from his time there , regardless of everything else , it was pretty funny . 
  he will be remembered as the master of spin . 
  more mps \u2260 greater representation necessarily . 
  i agree the house of lords needs to be reformed but this discussion is about the commons . 
  at the moment there are so many backbenchers in the house which basically do nothing all day other than sit on the back bench and reap the salary .
