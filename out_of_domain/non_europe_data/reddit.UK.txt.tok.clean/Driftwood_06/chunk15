  the reasons for that are vast , but one very important reason is that they get no time of day as a backbencher . 
  having less mps means that each mp has a greater chance of being heard in the commons , whether it is being selected for a select committee or being able to participate in a debate . 
  having more mps just exacerbates the issue today , where there 's so many backbench mps that there 's hardly a chance for any of them to realistically make an impact , and that 's what politics is all about . 
  you implied , when talking about unelected representatives being in much greater number than elected , that there was an issue with the house of lords . 
  also , the key point there is * good mps * , it 's far easier for an mp in a safe constituency to slack off and hardly conduct sugeries etc and spend 99 % of their time in parliament . 
  it 's not as if they are slashing mps down a huge level , just a bit to enusure that mps get more responsibility and accountability in areas where they could be easily slacking off , such as george osborne or jeremy corbyn 's seat ( which is being removed ) . 
  it 's an independent commission , so the conservative party bending that type of ** cross party ** commission to their complete will is pretty hard to believe . 
  they may have more lobbying power , given there are more tory mps in parliament , but nevertheless it 's independent for a reason . 
  apologies , i meant for it to read `` it 's not as if corbyn wo n't be able to find another seat '' . 
  it was n't meant to be a politically charged statement against either party , just an observation . 
  haha cool you never know when you get an angry redditor coming at you or just the everyday memer . 
  how would there be a clearer picture with 50 more mps jeering in pmqs , or trying to get a word in debates . 
  the only thing more mps leads to is more job security for career politicians in safe seats . 
  in a perfect world , perhaps it might be better to have greater representation , but the reality is that parliament is overcrowded as it is . 
  there 's only a few hours in every parliamentary day and it 's already extremely difficult for any mp to get their voice heard , whether it 's in the chamber or otherwise to ** actually represent ** their constituency , increasing the amount of people on the already very large list of people in the queue to speak does n't solve any issues . 
  in a perfect world of 100 hour days , it would be great for every single persons voice to be heard , but alas we do n't have that , and for that we have to try and get as many people as possible heard . 
  at the moment , that 's not happening and that is why the borders are being changed . 
  adding more shouting voices into a room does n't make any individual heard more , in fact it does the exact opposite . 
  in that sense , you are correct . 
  however , you have to remember that he led the tory party to not only relevance , but an election `` win '' and a tory majority which had not been seen since the 80 's . 
  he is and should be credited as the man who led the tories back into power and without him there would probably be at least another 5 years of new labour . 
  he 's done a lot of harm in the last few months , as well as throughout his time as pm but i wo n't forget all the good that did come out of the tory lib dem coalition , such as the gay marriage vote being pioneered by cameron ( which he was under no obligation to do ) . 
  he also managed to lead the economy into a respectable condition by imposing the cuts which needed to be made ( until 2013 where they could 've easily reduced them ) . 
  he 's a strong advocate of reducing climate change and we 've seen a lot of good in that regard done in that sense . 
  he 's also respected the will of parliament numerous times in relation to syria airstrikes ( 2013 more importantly where parliament voted no ) and had great foreign policy at the time , especially in comparison to the blair/brown years . 
  he also managed to keep scotland in the union when it all seemed lost at the end . 
  i 'll give him all the criticism for his failures , mostly in the nhs , brexit and austerity . 
  however , i will also praise his achievements . 
  watching plays like this makes me wish assassins like zed and leblanc were back in meta . . they were so fun to watch . 
  xpeke will always have my respect just because of how consistently good he has been . 
  bjerg and jensen have barely scraped the ceiling compared to how much players like xpeke have achieved in their careerspan . 
  then again malphite blitz are in meta in low elo ... rip . 
  some of the interesting observations from this group stage :, 
  exactly , and limiting the amount of mps they can hide behind imo is the correct thing to do . 
  haha malphite ultimate becomes easy to flash after you 've played against him for a while and blitz is useless without flash so always go aggressive on him when he missed the hook . 
  hope that helps haha, 
  * in comparison * is the key part , but bjerg has only really made success in na . 
  peke is a s1 world champion , has a play named after him ( xpeke backdoor ) , 2nd place at ipl5 ( seen as the most competitive and best tournament in league history ) s3 and s5 semi-finalist , made his own team and got it to worlds semi finals in s5 in one year , won the eulcs spring 2013 , summer 2013 , spring 2014 and attended the finals in both summer 2014 , 2015 and spring 2016 of eu . 
  i 'd say , given those credentials and in comparison , bjerg is only scraping the barrel in terms of accomplishments . 
  however , it 's not as if he does n't have a chance at beating peke in the future , i 'm just saying right now it 's not . 
  well if tsm plays like they did against c9 ( hopefully not ) they will have a lot of troubles against a team like splyce with a strong top lane . 
  i think you 're right though and , unless tsm ( unlikely ) or ssg ( more possible if they do n't play like they did at gauntlet ) fail i ca n't see splyce advancing . 
  performs almost always * in na * . 
  let 's be real , he had 0 competition in s4 and s5 , it 's only now he 's being actually challenged . 
  in europe he was like the 4th best mid in s3 . 
  this is nothing against his ability , just that he looks a lot better as a mid laner when all he was playing against was people like hai and link , compared to xpeke who kept performing well against the likes of froggen ( in his prime ) , nukeduck ( again in his prime ) , febiven , ryu in eu , and players like dade in worlds . 
  i 'd say since the end of s2 to the spring of s6 , he 's been pretty consistently good in playing at the top of his competition in eu , and then playing to the top of his competition in worlds . 
  that 's a pretty consistent timeframe imo, 
  i 'd say him being eu winners in 2013 spring and summer , as well as spring 2014 , finalist in 2014 summer and almost winning in 2015 summer against a 18-0 fnc is pretty consistent , not counting the great worlds performances by him in all the years in between . 
  i do n't play league anymore , just watch so i do n't care as much haha, 
  do n't forget the # 1 fredo , once that happens we 're all well and truly fucked . 
  we will fight on the beaches , we will fight in the streets . . 
  we will never surrender . 
  you can make the s1 and s2 argument for e.g s10 s11 , where of course the play will be much better . 
  it 's like saying that only soccer history from 1980 + is relevant , since now it 's a much bigger game and attracts as much players and talent as it does now . 
  season 1 and 2 are as much of `` esports '' as it is today , season 2 moreso under your criteria given how koreans were definitely still dominant in s2 and there was jungle invades ( diamondprox ?? ), 
  and many other strong strategies there which still exist today . 
  even disregarding s1 , and even s2 , xpeke has many more achievements as a player like bjerg has today , but that by no means says that bjerg is a worse player today , just that xpeke has been consistently good for a longer period of time . 
  also thanks / u/gonzaloetjo for the credit haha . 
  well clg.eu did only lose 2-1 to azubu , nobody knows what could 've happened if it was a bo5 ( * riot pls * ) and m5 again could 've won vs tpa in a bo5 and was one of the favourites to take the whole thing . 
  it was probably the closest semi finals that there has been . 
  well it was n't so great for na too ... both teams got stomped in the qfs . 
  imo all could 've gotten far if not for the game against kaboom as well as tsm if they did n't face ssw . 
  just wait until november when worlds is over , the eu hype train will be rolling again . 
  i have high confidence for g2 and h2k to at least make it to quarters , with splyce having an outside chance to get 2nd place too . 
  clg have really got 0 chance in my opinion , given how they got easily 3-0 'd by tsm in playoffs . 
  c9 have got an outside chance and tsm will probably be the only team to have a chance at semis . 
  gambit also won against azubu frost and blaze in iem in s3 iirc . 
  more relevant than ezreal x shyvana ... 
  clg did n't win any bo series , they got knocked out in group stage . 
  they were granted an inconsistent team at the time , but they perfect gamed a team which 3-0 'd skt in the regional qualifier , that 's got ta mean something ? 
  they also took the eulcs in one of the best records that there 's ever been ( when there used to be 28 games ) . 
  when all was on form i 'm sure they could beat any team other than ssw , the only problem was getting them to be consistent ( shown by them being kaboomed ) . 
  haha not sure if sarcasm or genuine ? 
  well thanks haha i 've been around the scene for quite a few years so i 've learnt up quite a lot over the years about esports . . 
  i 'm no thoorin though, 
  triggered . 
  theon has seen some shit . 
  the finals were ~ ~ bo5 ~ ~ , / u/plznerfme is correct . 
  i honestly would 've loved to have seen omg vs all , it would 've been a great bo5 with both teams at equal strength . 
  i rated royal pretty low at s4 , despite them being in the finals it was more due to them only facing cn teams aka a shit edg and them basically knowing all of omg 's strategies throughout the whole year . 
  imo if tsm , c9 or all got into the lower bracket of the playoffs , they would 've had a decent chance at making the finals , since the level of competition ( bar the ss teams ) was so similar . 
  sorry my bad !, 
  my memory is not as good as it seems . 
  never count out skt man ... 
  they are 2 time worlds winners + multiple time lck winners for a reason . 
  their support staff is godlike in comparison to pretty much every other team out there and you will be surprised how much good a bootcamp for multiple weeks against the best teams in the world can do to fix skt 's fundamental issues ( namely jungle strength and decision making ) . 
  i trust kkoma more than anyone else in esports to bring a team into the finals ** at least ** , and it would be stupid to outrank skt against a team like g2 or c9 given how skt have consistently performed on the world stage in comparison to pretty much every other team out there . 
  i can only really see g2 and tsm making it out to be honest . 
  clg have pretty much got no chance in this current meta , especially playing against heavily dominant bot lanes like zven mithy and pray gorilla . 
  splyce have n't got much chance either given how they play in eulcs in comparison to teams like rng ssg and tsm who have much better bot lane and jungle strength . 
  fw will probably make it out of groups with skt , mainly because of how strong those two teams have been in lck/lms in comparison to c9 who have struggled ( especially with meteos tilt ) , basically impact is the only reason how they got this far , and i can assure you that both fw and skt will notice this and full on camp top to shut him down . 
  they 've got an outside chance if fw chokes , but it seems more unlikely . 
  h2k have got an outside chance too , but remember that they are a heavily tilt based team , and if jankos does n't get ahead early i really do n't see them beating ahq or edg . 
  i would n't be surprised to see g2 ( 2nd seed ofc ) and tsm ( 2nd seed - they are n't the best in bo1 's historically ) come out from the west , with skt ( 1 ) , edg ( 1 ) , ssg ( 2 ) , fw ( 2 ) and ahq ( 2 ) getting out . 
  also , people have to remember that na ( and eu to the same extent these days bar g2 spy h2k and uol in the gauntlet ) is n't exactly the pinaccle of lol . 
  tsm might 've looked dominant , but they were playing in the playoffs a clg who shit the bed and a c9 who went full on tilt . 
  in the regular season they were dumpstering teams like apx , nv , tl , p1 , ef etc who were dogshit in macro play and basic mechanics bar a few players . 
  skt had to go through playing against teams with some of the best infrastructures and coaching staffs and players in the world like rox , ssg , afreeca , kt , cj . 
  of course you 're gon na look bad when you play against th best .
