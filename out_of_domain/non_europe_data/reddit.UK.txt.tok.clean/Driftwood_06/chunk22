  i think it 's more that despite his age he looks so in shape . 
  it 's just full of people blocking all those tourist sites, 
  only reason why badawi got banned and rick fox is n't is because rick fox is good for the scene ( popular celebrity bringing money into the scene ) whilst badawi is basically a nobody . 
  i 'm sure once it comes to 2020 farage will come out of his supposed `` cave '' and campaign for nuttal just like he was leader . 
  think how green did it with caroline lucas and natalie bennett in 2015 . 
  at this point , the white paper would literally have to have a picture of just dickbutt for there to be any significant rebellion of ** over 200 mps ** to overturn this bill . 
  well to be fair nothing has been decided regarding trade yet . 
  you never know , there could be some special devolved relationship between the eu + wales put in place . 
  at the end of the day , the eu needs the uk as much as the uk needs the eu . 
  there will be lots of rhetoric thrown about , but at the end of the day there is going to be some sort of amicable deal given to both sides ( albeit with the uk having to take some hit politically or through a fee ) so both have a form of free trade access with barriers to immigration . 
  no because it would go against fundamental human rights ? 
  as i am aware brexit does n't go against any fundamental rights . 
  although i wish you were true , both the telegraph and espeically the daily mail are the most read newspapers in the uk , most importantly by the more likely voting population ( over 40s ) . 
  headlines + buzzwords stick in people 's minds more than you think and in a world of fptp and swing constituencies things like this matter . 
  well this is a hypothetical which would never happen , and brexit was n't an emotive decision . 
  the british public do not always know what is right , but going against such a large amount of voters does have democratic and political ramifications beyond what you can imagine . 
  17 million people told what they voted for was worthless can create some serious disillusionment in politics . 
  that same level of disillusionment has been seen in the us , and look where that got them ... 
  i 'm not sure about you but i 'd rather have a tory brexit than a farage alt-right govt . 
  well we lost so i guess we have to face the consequences in that regard . 
  although i do agree that if it was the other way around ( 52-48 remain ) there would be massive outcries from the right for a second referendum . 
  croydon , click at the actual link and there 's descriptions next to each picture of where it is . 
  he failed his job at sancorp ( lobbying for tusk ) and therefore he was out of a job . 
  frank took him on since he 's very talented and most importantly ** loyal ** to frank . 
  have you heard about the tragedy of g2 perkz the wise ? 
  it 's a lol legend . 
  g2 perkz was a mid laner of the eu lcs who choked so much , he could use his role to influence the subreddit to create ... memes . 
  he had such an influence of the memes , he could even keep the ones he cared about ... from being shit talked . 
  he fed so hard , the only thing he was afraid of was losing was his ego ... which , eventually of course , he did . 
  unfortunately , he taught the rest of g2 everything he knew . 
  ironic . 
  he could save others from being trashtalked . . but not himself . 
  true , but if pewdiepie was removed from yt for whatever reason , people might care for a bit but not for long enough for anything super significant to happen . 
  i know the aforementioned students as well as the students who are protesting about this and i can say that this has been blown so much out of proportion . 
  the people protesting are using this as a way of `` showing '' that there is a systemic racist problem in bristol . 
  there may be one , but dressing up using dreadlocks is neither racist or cultural appropriation , especially given the context that they are literally oitnb characters . 
  the amount of hate i am seeing on my news feed from predominantly students from the bme society against these girls is frankly shocking . 
  it just shows that they have n't actually improved individually or as a team . 
  they 're playing as if it was s6 when everyone else is on s7 level . 
  the last time he had a good team behind him was s4 and he was regarded as the eu faker in one of the best teams ( albeit extremely consistent ) in the world . 
  s2 he was seen as a top 2 midlaner in the world when he had a good team . 
  now he 's on a good team again , the sky 's the limit for froggen . 
  toyz was good at worlds , but imo misaya was the no. 1 player , then alex ich and then froggen with rapidstar and toyz at no. 4 . 
  and to think a full team signed off on this ... 
  bunch of lunatic psychopaths, 
  can honeslty say that you wo n't understand until you live in halls/with other students your own age . 
  it both matures you and gives you the confidence that you probably may never get if you just commuted every day . 
  i knew people who commuted and they just live completely different lives to myself and others who lived on campus . 
  in halls you 're pushed ( by your flatmates usually ) to do things you never thought you would do and end up doing things you never thought you would enjoy . 
  it 's very hard to sell it when you have n't seen/experienced it , but i could 100 % honestly stake any money on anyone having a good time living in halls over commuting . 
  learning that sell by dates exist ... that was one for me . 
  almost fnc vs sk flashback for ocelote, 
  yeah but good ol fptp will make sure even if he does come back and rouse support , they wo n't win any more seats . 
  2015 was the height of ukip , given the calls for a referendum . 
  now a hard brexit is in place , the majority of voters who voted ukip in 2015 have no reason to not vote tory . 
  well he 'll probably also be remembered in 100 years for creating microsoft . . 
  it 's not as if there was any * credible * choice apart from him though . 
  owen smith turned out to be a worse version of jc and burnham was never as charismatic . 
  if a real challenger actually got the balls to stand up against corbyn , i think there would be a much tighter race . 
  there 's a lot of great candidates in the labour party at the moment from all factions . 
  there 's people like jarvis , chukka , hilary benn , harriet harman on the centre left of the party and people like clive lewis , kier starmer and emily thornberry further left . 
  it 's just that none of these `` big hitters '' would dare go against the membership and go for a full run against jc since it would be the end of their political career for at least 5 years if they lost ( see : owen smith ) . 
  what would you describe as the `` traditional values of the labour party '' that the ` right ' of the party do n't believe in ? 
  nationalisation ? - most mps agree with a fully fledged nhs and full nationalisation of the railways ( hilary benn for example ), 
  support for the unions ? - i 'm pretty sure every mp supports the unions , but giving them as much control as they had in the 80s just creates striking issues like when there was constant blackouts from the electric company strikes . 
  raising taxes ? - well that 's generally a hard one to sell to the growing middle glass electorate , so i do n't anticipate even jc would raise them that much if he wants to be in power . 
  the eu ? - the labour party 's `` traditional '' stance on the eu was completely against , hence jc 's previous strong support for a brexit before he was leader . 
  it used to be the tories who wanted us in the eec/eu and labour on the other side along farage . 
  that 's what we have ended up with now . 
  if its anything like the 80s gon na be another decade of being like this until we get another leader like john smith/blair who is ( i ) charismatic and ( ii ) has the balls to bring the party back to the centre left . 
  people are too afraid to stand up against the members who seem to be `` corbyn or bust '' at the moment . 
  he is against fptp , for the eu , for replacing trident , against military action in syria , not a `` career politician '' , strong willed and charismatic , experienced and served in ed miliband 's cabinet , decorated military veteran and for the nhs . 
  seems like a decent guy to at least look at for leadership . 
  one argument against that was to burn down the house so a new one could be re-built . 
  unfortunately , it does n't seem like any real re-building is going on which is going to stay . 
  well i would say that 's more of brown 's legacy , since he completely ruined the image of a secure and stable centre left under new labour . 
  i would n't say at all that the labour party is devoid of talent , but rather that no-one is willing to face off the pro-corbyn members until corbyn himself resigns . 
  if i knew that i would 've never voted for him in 2015 , but he seemed like the best choice for labour to actually have a core policy set and a direction forward , in comparison to ed miliband who struggled to have any real key policies ( see : the edstone ) . 
  edit : to clarify , ed had many key policies , but none of them were clear enough for the electorate to understand where he stood . 
  the edstone is the epitome of this with words like ' a strong nhs ' floated around . 
  corbyn may have borrowed many of ed 's policies but he is a lot clearer on his stance in this regard in my opinion . 
  well chuka is probably the best candidate labour has at the moment , but i think he would only stand if corbyn stood down , since he does n't want to go through an uphill battle like smith did and lose . 
  lets just hope for some reason corbyn resigns and then we 'll see a real leadership election with credible candidates like chuka , jarvis , clive lewis and kier starmer who are n't afraid of whether the members will destroy them . 
  what i mistakenly meant was that ed did a terrible job at putting key policies out to the media as his core vision , whilst corbyn has a very clear stance on what he wants to do . 
  it 's fine to look back to 2015 with 20:20 vision and say that burnham would 've been better for the party , but at the time it was not at all as clear cut . 
  nobody could 've foreseen the level of corbyn 's popularity following his win , or his insistence to stay despite the fall in support from the plp . 
  and fyi i voted for smith in the leadership election , but only because i know he would bow under pressure and resign if he did not have the necessary electoral support to win an election . 
  is n't it better to unionise and lobby the owners of restaurants/the state to change things rather than put the burden on the customer and blame them for not paying you your wage ( which the employer should do anyway ) ? 
  the main protagonist was too stereotypically mysterious but apart from that it seemed * ok * . 
  nothing exactly special/it 's no man in the high castle . 
  even he was nothing compared to koreans/diamondprox back then in s2 . 
  theoddone was a great * na * jungler at the time , but na as a whole was a whole dimension worse than almost every single region out there back in s2 and even going into s3 ( apart from c9 ) . 
  there really was n't a team which could beat a european , chinese or korean team back then, 
  what makes you think she would n't be a good leader of the party ? 
  they just had to get that one win ... 
  whereabouts in stokes croft ? 
  beme team = the same and very much alive, 
  well they were always the lesser power when it came to ww2 , like a puppet state pretty much, 
  i doubt they will ever be finished as a mainstream party ... the labour party is a coalition of different sides of the left so we will probably see the more electable centre-left come back ( like in the 90s ) once corbyn loses and ( hopefully ) resigns . 
  it 's much better losing with a good amount of opposition than a landslide though ... imagine what may + the tories can do with brexit and the nhs with full support of the commons .
