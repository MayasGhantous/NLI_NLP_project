  members of the house of lords have been pm 's in the past - sailsbury in 1902 for example . 
  but it does seem as though the person must be in some area of parliament to actually lead the party . 
  he must be realising it though ... he can see the opinion polls very clearly . 
  if an election was called today it would probably end up with the biggest tory landslide since pre-ww2 . 
  any other leader would have resigned a long time ago looking at those numbers , he is just greedy for as much control as he can get until the members eventually turn on him for running labour into the ground in 2020 and leading us to a hard brexit . 
  you could say the exact same thing is happening in opposite with cameron/may compared to labour at its lowest point, 
  very well said , you only really win elections these days on the centre ground . 
  we would be far better with pr , but the reality is that since john major no party which does n't at least lean centre can win across the country . 
  that does n't mean to say parties should abandon their beliefs/policies on either the right or the left , but they should be more amicable in some of their policies and look for compromise - at the end of the day pushing through two left wing policies and two centrist policies is better than no left wing policies at all . 
  north especially , missed too many key defensive tackles which ended up in wales ultimately losing . 
  from my understanding of property law , your flatmate could claim that he has `` sublet '' his room out to his girlfriend for that week ( but he would have to prove some sort of monetary exchange ) . 
  since you are the only one with a legal tenancy and your flatmate only seems to have a license , it seems wholly likely that you could ask her to leave and she would have to ( given she has next to no rights as a licensee at best ) . 
  best thing to do would be to talk to your landlord about it and possible options . 
  although , if she does say no and you want to get rid of her , it may take much * much * longer than you think and your flatmate will probably be home by then so you can talk it out with him - best scenario would be to get rid of him if he is messing you around with this . 
  so the timeline of events are :, 
  - the man barged into you , you called him an arsehole which provoked him and he attempted to hit you, 
  - you + your friends retaliated to stop him attacking you, 
  from my understanding of the criminal law and self defence , you seem to be in the clear . 
  as long as you can very clearly state that you were not the one who provoked the fight and you were merely defending yourself ( which the cctv should hopefully show ) you will be fine . 
  the kicking the person when he is down may cause some issues , but as long as you can prove that you believed the force you exerted during the fight was reasonable to constitute self defence , you will be fine . 
  again , this is n't exactly legal advice but best bet is to see how high you can go in the finance department for amazon and keep asking people for you to talk to their supervisor/manager to get this resolved . 
  demand that you have proof and that you can email it over to them , and if all fails then threaten that you will take this further to a small claims court for breach of contract ( failure to refund ) . 
  if you do want to take it to court ( which should be a last resort ) make sure to make note of every phone call/correspondence you make and make a note of what you and the person on the other side said . 
  to continue what / u/devlin90 said , as long as the kicking when he was down was n't enough to cause major harm ( ie he got back up and was completely fine ) you should be in the clear and besides , unless the other side presses charges ( which is extremely unlikely ) the police wo n't even bother spending taxpayer money to prosecute you . 
  always the best approach , it 's never worth it and you never know who 's watching/if the other side will press charges . 
  yep i completely agree with 100ft-bear on this , and did n't mention the sublet argument because i assumed that there was n't any monetary agreement in place between the flatmate and the girlfriend for subletting . 
  so haha being decent in na soloq means you can go against bjergsen/froggen etc ? 
  i think tl might be screwed but we 'll see, 
   vacation, 
  nicely memed brother, 
  that 's true , we love watching people suffer already ( see : big brother , im a celeb etc ) - maybe in some alternate scenario we ( in the most generalised sense ) get so disconnected that we are ok and enjoy watching stuff like this . 
  almost did in s3 with clg . . 
  [ our lord and saviour ] ( https://i.imgur.com/bwxglyz.jpg ), 
  hard to see whether they were * truly * the best on the basis of bo1 's - heck rox lost to anx and almost lost to g2 , skt lost to fw in bo1 's . 
  anything can happen in group stage , it 's the bracket which matters, 
  ** however ** . 
  at the end of the day , tsm was definitely in the top 5 teams at worlds , which makes them * world class * . 
  i mean , its true that its hard to definitively tell , but my best guess is that they were - there was a decent enough gap in worlds in 2016 between the competitive teams ( rox , skt , h2k , tsm , edg , ssg , ryl ) and the rest to make a judgement that they could 've been world class . 
  haha , the pic is from s3 summer split when uzi was n't a big name and bang was n't even around - hence why people like qtpie , maplestreet , mash and cop are in the pic . 
  $ $ $ might keep him , depends how deep regi 's pockets are to keep a fire under dl 's ass . 
   tsm is not that rich compared to other na lcs teams . 
  depends what you define as `` rich '' . 
  teams which large vc backing may have issues forking out large sums for a player , but teams like tsm and clg have complete autonomy to pay as much as they want for x player since they are 100 % owned by regi/hotshot . 
  dl hardly chokes , if anything he usually goes beast mode when his career is on the line ( see every time he 's played in relegations ), 
  the queen is appointed by god technically ( through the archbishop of canterbury ) in the coronation . 
  the queen/king is only technically a monarch after that specific point in the ceremony . 
  getting in there first with phone reviews = way more views . 
  probably just a sloppy job to get it out asap, 
  it 's because the whole season has been just as good . 
  i guess people were expecting something even * better *, 
  people voted for, 
  [ i 'm working on one as well ] ( https://i.imgur.com/svlfben.png ) . 
  what do you guys think ? 
  that car ambush was probably one of the most well executed things i 've seen by any group of yogs since ... ever ? 
  game 5 vs lmq ... never forgetti, 
  did you ever hear the tragedy of captain flowers the wise ? 
  i thought not . 
  it 's not a story riot would tell you . 
  i mean , the vote against even * shared * sovereignty back in 2002 was 96 % , so i doubt much would 've changed in 10 years . 
  the majority of gibraltarians are british , so i doubt they would want to be spanish in the same way that falklanders would want to be argentinian or people from guernsey/jersey would want to be french . 
  taco bell and dunkin donuts is over here now ? 
  god rest our souls ... 
  leaving the eu ( and having a full scale negotiation - perhaps involving freedom of movement for gibraltarians ) is extremely different to leaving the uk and their national identity ( which the have been a part of for 300 years ) behind . 
  it really is apples and oranges here . 
  `` creapiest '' `` resorses '', 
  stay in school kids , do n't quit high school like casey haha, 
  if someone works in `` securities '' , it would be almost impossible for them not to know how stocks work since securities work in the bond market . 
  to understand the bond market , she would 've had to learn the stock market first in her mba programme . 
  it does n't matter if apple makes the new iphone $ 1,100 ... as long as they do amazing marketing about the fact that its the `` best iphone ever '' and that its the `` 10 year edition '' people will buy it more than the s8 . 
  people having been waiting for the iphone 8 to come out for around 2 years now , no matter the price ( within reason ) people will buy it . 
  basically neither the jedi nor yoda were as powerful as they used to be . 
  yoda has become old and was not as he used to be and the jedi as a whole has become used to fighting mindless droids , instead of the sith as they used to do . 
  or at least that 's how i justified it in my head . 
  absolutely loved it , but it was mainly due to both pyrions knowledge ( to the point where i understood exactly what was going on ) and the hype he was bringing to it . 
  would love to see it again , or at least on the main channel, 
  it 's like treason, 
  it will either :, 
  ( i ) never come out ; or, 
  ( ii ) come out a year after twow , since through all this time grrm has actually basically been writing both stories ( like with affc and adwd ) . 
  the most likely scenario is ados will never come out , sadly . 
  the day twow gets released will receive the same hype as when hl3 is announced , both have basically become memes at this point . 
  if you somehow manage to get this right , it 'll be the most gilded comment in reddit history ... 
  they managed to win a game though !, 
  `` take a ** seat ** skywalker '', 
  well ... 
  the whole thing with grevious was completely irrelevant for the story , despite its massive build it the storyline turned out to be a shitty disguise for order 66 . 
  even despite that , the scene where the jedi masters come to arrest palpatine is the most retarded thing ever . 
  these are meant to be ** masters ** and yet they get torn down like mindless droids . 
  they knew when they walked in that they were facing a sith lord , and yet they get killed so easily . 
  also , the fact that yoda literally is the most powerful ( apart from i guess anakin but he is n't fully developed yet ) being in the galaxy in terms of strength of force , the fact that he get insta shocked and gives up after a few fights is really terrible script writing . 
  heck , palpatine was a formidable sith opponent but he should n't have been able to easily throw such a powerful person as yoda around as he did in that battle . 
  rogue one did the best at connecting the ot , if only a competent director ( and not gl ) was heading the film , or even the prequels for that matter . 
  well once twow is finished , the timelines are basically set for the finish in ados ( if it actually is the final book ) . 
  once all the characters timelines are set , he should hopefully not be tied in `` meereneese knots '' as he is/was with twow, 
  it 's treason then, 
  i always wonder why obi wan did that , instead of straight up 1v1 ` ing vader, 
  [ the whole scene ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4esorf_u1hg ) from 0:38 -0:52 is the most atrocious fighting i 've ever seen . 
  i too could write an essay just on that one part since it infuritates me that much . 
  compared to [ the fight with darth maul ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhqdesarkqu ) it is unbelievable who bad that scene was , especially given the context that mace windu is meant to be one of the best `` all rounders '' and darth sidious is both the most powerful sith lord ever and trained maul ... 
  fair point , i get where you are coming from,
