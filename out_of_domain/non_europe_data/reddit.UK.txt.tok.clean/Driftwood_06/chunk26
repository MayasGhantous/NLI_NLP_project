  exactly look at players like huni , corejj etc. 
  if you make it big in na or at least show promise , you 've got a chance of making it back to korea . 
  i 'd say the success of that team was more due to delior than anyone else , he was the glue that made the team as successful as it was . 
  sure fnatic would 've been a top team , but i doubt they would 've gone undefeated + gone to the semis of worlds without delior and his belt . 
  the question is , how many times did she mention ** strong and stable government ** or the * coalition of chaos *, 
  it 's sad that the police wont grow some balls and arrest/fine them . 
  to stop stuff like this happening you got ta make a statement and enforce the law . 
  tfw na fans saying g2 will be the biggest disappointment at msi . 
  all we need to hear is that the * gap is closing * now . 
  these games simply show that following the meta might not always be the best option . 
  league around the world has blended into the same `` follow korea '' meta , maybe having different styles ( like uol 's chaos style ) might be the true key to beating korea in the end . 
  levi bringing back diamondprox the disrespect, 
  and bio , tbh bjerg was the only player worth his weight in these two games . 
  he forgot he could n't turn off the stream, 
  they did n't even win or get close to winning any international events in s2 , na as a whole has way too high expectations for the skill level they are at . 
  he was up against an extremely difficult group in worlds last year to be fair , in comparison to what is a wildcard team now . 
  at clg the whole losing to pain was due to synergy/behaviour issues in clg which meant that they probably could 've lost to anyone that week . 
  i 'm not a doublelift fan , but lets be real here he is an extremely talented player - if he was able to be subbed in for game 3 he could 've brought a completely fresh attitude to the game , since there seems to be some sort of choking/performance issue right now with tsm . 
  i think it was the fact that all the news outlets thought someone died ( since all the staff were very unusually summoned and there was no leaks about why ) , so they allocated the space for the death of phillip ( or even the queen ) but once they got the statement they just released it anyway at the allocated time, 
  but they still were the best team pretty much , they * almost * beat edg at msi and still managed to win worlds . 
  fnatic probably is the only team to have gone close to beating the likes of skt ( with them going toe to toe with rox who was on around the same level at the time ) . 
  i doubt we 'll see a team like fnatic for a while now , unless weldon somehow manages to make sure g2 plays as good on the world stage as they do in eulcs . 
  the ultimate bm : pick sona in game 3 , utterly throw in game 4 . 
  too bad they also bm 'd in game 5 by playing like shit :'(, 
  i get you , but i dont think we can definitively say skt was better than edg when they one 3-2 in a really close bo5 set . 
  also remember than in msi 2015 skt played completely jet lagged and with no real time to prep for all the teams . 
  it 's why churchill is so respected , irrespective of his failings before the war and indeed after . 
  he was a damn stubborn man , almost insanely determined and immensely patriotic . 
  ** anyone ** else in the war cabinet would 've at least discussed options for peace with germany after dunkirk , but instead churchill went on the radio and gave hitler the two fingers ( not for victory , but for `` fuck you '' ), 
  i dunno , i think to truly understand the brutality of war gore should not be avoided for the sake of a pg-13 rating . 
  although i get your point and completely agree that the story , and not the gore should be focused , a got style approach can work spectacularity well in getting the right balance . 
  it 's treason then . 
  well britain would 've never * lost * the war as france or poland , since germany was never able to gain naval or air superiority at all . 
  without us involvement britain wouldve never won for sure , and russia would 've taken germany for itself . 
  but without the uk handing over its nuclear programme to the us in 1943 , the us war in japan would 've 90 % have lasted at least another year before land forces arrived in tokyo . 
  the problem is that you can compare it to saying :, 
  `` hitler did more good than harm , because without hitler the problem of antisemitism would 've remained as strong as it did . '', 
  you see a problem with argument that you made and the one above is that there are ** other ways ** of creating either economic progress or stop antisemitism . 
  you do not need to kill ~ 50million people in the case of mao or directly kill ~ 6million jews . 
  the ends does n't justify the means when it comes to crimes against humanity . 
  china 's cultural revolution could 've happened in around 100 different ways which did n't involve the abhorrent death toll that happened . 
  that 's why mao did much , much more harm than any supposed good he did , because the ends do not in any way justify the means . 
  the tories probably should n't even put a candidate against her in hackney , she does more harm than good to the labour party . 
  that 's true , if there was someone more charismatic about their policies/politics ( like blair was in 1997 when he managed to get a landslide ) then labour could sell left/socialist policies , but corbyn is neither so now people associate left = corbyn and unstable , right = may and stable, 
  if he stays as leader and does n't resign after the tories winning a landslide he 'll be the most idiotic leader labour has ever had . 
  it 'll literally break up the party and result in labour not getting in government for another decade ... 
  so lets hope he hangs up the act on june 10th and gives labour a chance to be electable again . 
  lol i 'd like to see a legitimate source on that , i 'm calling bullshit, 
  there 's a big difference between embarrassing polls and embarrassing results , he 's never had the latter . 
  oh i completely agree with you , and this is the first real big show that labour is utterly screwed for the ge . 
  if there was n't an election in 4weeks there would be massive ( almost insurmountable ) calls for jc to resign . 
  its probably why may called it in the first place , since she knew she would win the council elections massively and that could 've tipped it to another leadership contest , where there would 've at least been a chance for a better and more electable leader in the labour party . 
  you would hope the 500,000 members of the party do n't believe that as well ... 
  i think the 2016 leadership contest ( and indeed 2015 ) was n't indicative of labour voting intentions . 
  once a good , credible and charismatic candidate gets the balls to stand against corbyn , it 'll be a very different story . 
  both burnham and smith did n't have those qualities to tackle corbyn , but i hope someone ( like chuka or clive lewis or stella creasey ) will stand or contest jc, 
  to be honest it 's going to be a 2 horse race between lib dems and labour . 
  with the short amount of time for campaigning , the majority are going to head to what is formally established in bristol and known . 
  i 'm pretty certain that thangam debbonaire is the best vote for bristol , since she seems strong and able to stand up the leadership when needed , although i 'm tempted to vote lib dem just to show the tories that they should be looking towards staying in the single market rather than heading towards a hard brexit . 
  similarly , fantasia on a theme by thomas tallis is wonderful . 
  i 'd say in the hall of the mountain king might be worse . . 
  every time you want to go to the end and have the final resolution , but the conductor always stops you . 
  jacqueline du pr\u00e9 is pretty much the best ever cellist to walk on this earth , yo-yo-ma even has her # 1m stradavarius . 
  very much `` underrated '' and really should be higher up . 
  the whole suite from start to finish is a true emotive masterpiece . 
  it 's like a novel in itself , so many stories in that fantasia . 
  it shows how much of a child he is in making sure the uk gets as bad as deal as possible , no matter the cost . 
  junker is a eurocrat through and through , and he wants to make sure the uk gets a right old kicking up the arse so no other ms even thinks of leaving the defunct institution . 
  fty i have a lot of respect for many aspects of the eu , but its politics with the council/commission/parliament is horrible . 
  depends what you define as `` the eu '' . 
  people like junker see the eu as its own institution with separate rules and autonomy , whereas i like to see the eu as a way of getting 27 countries around one table to reach cooperation and mutual prosperity . 
  under the former , there 's nothing wrong with ensuring the uk completely falls flat on its face , but that would also result in many members sates being left worse off ( lots of the eu trades with the uk ) . 
  it 's why we 'll probably see a lot less of junker and a lot more of the council whilst the actual negotiations go on . 
  be under no impression that the eu rules the member states , it is the other way around and always has been . 
  when it comes to such an important defining moment in european history , it 'll be the eu leaders , and not the unelected bureaucrats , making the real key decisions . 
  or riven, 
  is there though , electoral wise ? 
  all that matters at the end of the day is getting into government , since if you ca n't do that then its a waste of time . 
  if labour loses by a massive landslide , it wo n't only be the demise of corbyn , but a rejection/fear of socialism by the general public . 
  there 's quite a few who i can think of who could easily lead the labour party into winning a majority , provided they have a year or two in opposition to warm up :, 
  names like kier starmer , chuka unumna , yvette cooper , stella creasey , clive lewis , dan jarvis come to mind instantly . 
  i 'm sure there 's a lot more as well on both the left and the centre left , heck we could even see a return of ed miliband after his massive pr improvement . 
  the plp is n't devoid of talent , it 's just afraid of its members/momentum which is propping up corbyn at the moment . 
  once corbyn is out of the equation we 'll finally see a real leadership contest , but until he stands it 'll take a candidate with real guts to stand up against corbyn 's massive membership mandate - perhaps it 'll be easier after june 9th . 
  what you seem to be referring to is the lib dems ... 
  interventions can work , and have in the past - the most prominent example being in berlin . 
  the difference is that the uk/us invested a lot of time rebuilding west berlin , in comparison to iraq where they basically decapitated the head and let it run by itself . 
  his main issue was betraying the unions + scotland imo , not iraq . 
  that 's what ultimately led to the demise of blair 's support among the left . 
  that 's one hypocritcal statement . 
  saddam was a genocidal dictator , to the point where even if you spilt your coffee on a picture of him , you would get arrested and shot . 
  he killed all who opposed him and used chemical weapons against his people . 
  not saying what blair did was wrong , especially in relation to how he handled the aftermath , but saddam deserved everything he got and the people of iraq are n't oppressed anymore by such an evil human being . 
  exactly this , swing voters especially vote for the person and not the policy/party . 
  every single leader in existence has had some sort of charisma/likeability which has lead them to victory . 
  corbyn just does n't have that , which makes him unelectable in the uk . 
  imo tim farron could lead the lib dems to a huge success , but he really needed a few more years to get the name recognition from ordinary folk - most people do n't even know who he is . 
  the reason why people like starmer are n't appearing on tv/radio is probably because they do n't want to associate themselves with jc since they know he will lose ... that 's why abbott/thornberry are the only ones making public appearances . 
  ngl that would actually give labour a lot of support , if he just let someone like watson run . 
  people like watson a lot more and corbyn has become tained as `` unelectable '' too much .
