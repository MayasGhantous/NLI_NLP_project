  * sweet summer child *, 
  where does the o7 bit come from ? 
  if anything , it 's forced jeremy corbyn to actually lay down some concrete policy . 
  regardless of whether corbyn should or should not be leader , it 's kicked him and mcdonnell to actually put policy on the table and make a passionate case for it . 
  the fact that these official policies were only made now though does show that he has been pretty erratic during his 9 months as leader . 
  if he was true to his word , he would 've threw all his weight in pushing for these policies and compromising with his colleagues to solidify the best possible official party policy on issues such as investment , immigration , the eu and welfare . 
  we 've seen the tories be the most solid as they 've ever been in the last few months . 
  they swiftly elected a new leader and have clear party policy goals which they are implementing . 
  it 's time labour does the same , whether it be corbyn or smith as leader . 
  most people i know have actually gone and use instagram stories to `` advertise '' their snapchat usernames ... it 's gone full circle . 
  honestly , the echo chamber in / r/uk is becoming more and more apparent . 
  smith questioned corbyn numerous times on his leadership and he could not answer once how he is going to actually get all 172 mps to support him again . 
  there 's a reason why 99 % of leaders resign after they lose a no confidence vote ; it 's because if they can not command the support of the party , how can they command the support of the electorate ( which comprises of more than corbynistas ) . 
  the debate on policy would of course be less about their differences , they are in the same party of course they would be agreeing on many things . 
  the * key * part was the fact that smith did come across clearer in his message of policy . 
  call it political speak or rp or whatever , it 's the truth . 
  when the labour challenger goes against the electorate , we want someone who can actually confidently and passionately convince people to vote to do a complete u-turn in policy from what they voted for in 2010 and 2015 . 
  corbyn 's only strength is preaching to the converted , owen might just stand a chance at convincing people to think that austerity is n't the only option . 
  and do you think that is right that a leader can basically go against the democratic vote of the plp and still remain in power ? 
  mind you these mps are also democratically voted in by the constituents , so their vote matters as much as any member , if not more so since they represent a large group of people . 
  it 's crazy to think that , if not for the outburst/drama where regi instinctively benched xpecial , he may have stayed on tsm for as long as dyrus , if not longer . 
  / thread, 
  honestly this . 
  if they got seeded in the top half of the bracket they would 've easily gone to finals . 
  they even stood toe to toe with ssb which was , at the time , one of the best ( if not the best on a good day ) team in the world . 
  honestly , it 's probably not worth the watch now . 
  unless you want to watch the games for the nostalgic factor , it 's depressing to see how bad the league was , especially in na . 
  however if you do want to subject yourself to the pain , i would watch s2 na qualifiers for worlds at pax . 
  that was when they were at their most dominant and it looked as though they were well above the rest of na . 
  other than that take a look at any of the previous mlg finals and semi-finals in s2 , i think it 's dallas against dig when they really stamped themselves above clg as the top tier na team . 
  unfortunately , this meant nothing back then , since eu and kr were miles above any other region in the world ( tpa being the exception ) and cn could beat any na team easily . 
  it took c9 , a team who literally shat on the whole of na for basically 3 splits in a row to bring the standard of play up to eu 's level . 
  but ssw was well known for just flat out trolling in some games and not retaining their composure . 
  tsm mainly won out of a lvl1 catch and snowballed it to victory . 
  even royal managed to take a game off ssw and they were arguably one of the more mediocre teams in the tournament ( only really beating tsm and the rest of the chinese teams ) . 
  i would hardly say it was the easiest group ... 
  they had alliance who won a ** perfect game ** against the team who beat skt 3-0 in the korean playoffs . 
  c9 at the time was also a very strong and consistent team and najin as i said was the 3rd best team in korea ( which arguably is the best region ) . 
  the fact that c9 managed to beat najin fair and square in a solid game by superior teamfighting and mechanics showed that they were n't a team to be fucked around with . 
  the fact that they also managed to take a game off ssb ( and almost another ) and give them a run for their money showed that they were a very strong team . 
  ssb and ssw were both in a league of their own in s4 . 
  the fact that c9 could stand strong against ssb in all the games , in comparison to tsm who won one lucky game ( off a lvl1 pick ) and then lose the 3 others in dominant fashion , shows that c9 was a team which could 've taken it all the way if they faced the weaker chinese teams ( shown by royal struggling against tsm out of all teams and omg struggling against fnc ) . 
  they did manage to almost take another game off them though ? 
  and look at any match besides worlds in 2014 , ssb was the better team in 90 % of them . 
  ssw just managed to peak at the right time and beat ssb in one bo series , it does n't mean that they were the better team overall . 
  heck , p1 won against tsm in a series , it does n't mean that p1 was the better team .

  edit : goddamn / u/pebeling for making me doubt my memory, 
  / u/macosxlion11 was saying that , since selling a team goes for about $ 1mil , the c9 org will be getting about as much as the 1st place team ( overall ) gets from winning worlds . 
  it 's not even a circlejerk , it 's just fact . 
  it really shows how player environment/teammates can change a player . 
  a bad player can look amazing on a good team ( like ohq and gbm ) whilst a good player can look terrible on a bad team ( like froggen ) . 
  daario is dead ? 
  * high sparrow, 
  that looks amazing !, 
  you should be so proud of your work . 
  if i saw that in a shop i would honestly be prepared to see a price tag of # 300-500 on it . 
  the problem with this is that , aside from group stage , most of the `` important matches '' ( playoffs , worlds ) a team plays are either bo3 or bo5 . 
  therefore , would n't it be more important to find consistency in a bo3 rather than a bo2 ? 
  a lot of labour voters did vote for miliband back in 2010 , so i guess it 's worth having his endorsement to fight against corbyn . 
  not sure how much worth it will be now though , given how much the membership has changed since 2015 . 
  the fact that they can justify university hall to be ~ # 110/week still shocks me . 
  student satisfaction has never meant anything ( nor most league tables for that matter ) . 
  the most important thing for unis are employment rates , reputation and how much * you * like university campus . 
  i 'm not sure if this needs an / s or not, 
  same , i think it 's just a reason for people to bitch at casey more than anything . 
  i 'm from the uk as well and hardly anyone even knows there is a `` british cuisine '' . 
  most people would rather have a chinese or indian than shepherds pie or bangers and mash . 
  i would n't say may was ` for leaving ' ; she did n't officially campaign for remain and if she wanted to increase her political goals she would 've wanted to back leave ( look at how much leadsom got for just being ' a leaver ' ) . 
  she just knows that being decisive and respecting the decision the public made is good for everyone . 
  also , there 's no chance she would actually be able to push through repealing the hra and it 's obviously been dropped from tory policy ( from the fact that it hasnt been mentioned in any of the queens speeches ) . 
  many foreign ministers have already mentioned wanting negotiations before art. 50 because it not beneficial for anyone on a common sense approach to just invoke it and ` see what happens ' . 
  whatever deal that happens , theres no chance theresa will be able to get away with anything but ` control ' on migration . 
  that 's what effectively gave leave the majority swing and she would be stupid to keep this issue unsolved because it would just result in the further rise of ukip . 
  well , perhaps he 's electable as leader , but there is 0 evidence that he has a shot in a million to beat may . 
  being labour leader is good and all , but what good is it if you ca n't even enact what you were elected to enact as leader . 
  you should care because of how broken the system of uk politics is . 
  the harsh fact is that , despite corbyn having great ideas and being a decent person , he can not be elected to government . 
  if corbyn represents your views i assume you want him to enact those views and policies in a government ( since that 's the only way he can change politics and the country ) ? 
  to do that he needs to be electable , so you see now that electability is almost as important as the policies at hand . 
  now looking at opinion polls , only 13 % of people approve of corbyn in the country as the next leader , compared to a staggering 50 % towards may ( which is huge given current leaders usually get less ) . 
  corbyn has so much baggage under him that i just can not see the british public wanting to vote for him . 
  firstly , he has those alleged `` links '' to hamas and hezbollah which the tories will hit hard on and probably convince the layman that he 's a bit dodgey . 
  then , they will hit hard on the fact that almost his whole party opposed him and voted in ** no confidence ** . 
  i 'm not sure how he could ever get out of that black hole , given the tories need only spin it as `` we are unified and ready for government , labour can not even control a full front bench . '', 
  i can 100 % guarantee you that these issues of , among other things , will ensure corbyn is never elected to government in 2020 , and is n't that what the whole aim of being leader is about ? 
  to change the country and `` fuck the old paradigm '' as you said ? 
  looking at the actual details of the poll , only 13 % of people actually approve of corbyn as the next leader . 
  imo that 's pretty dire . 
  * i do n't care about corbyn being so called ` electable ' * / s, 
  i 'll give a few . 
  firstly , the landslide mp vote against him in no confidence . 
  the media and the tories are going to destroy him on this ( `` we 're the unity party etc '' ) . 
  secondly , his opposition to trident . 
  it 's just not popular in the country to scrap trident , and he 's basically going against official labour policy so that shows again `` labour turmoil '' . 
  thirdly , he is `` unstatesmanlike '' . 
  now despite what labour members think , the fact that he `` did n't sing the national album '' and shit like that does piss off quite a few older voters , who make up the majority share in how the nation votes . 
  i 'm sure there 's many reasons as to why smith might not be the best leader to get elected ( because that 's what it 's all about at the end of the day ) , but i 'm 100 % certain that all those swing centralist and right leaning seats that we need to win wo n't vote labour again under corbyn . 
  the clps do n't make up the country , people should be looking to national opinion polls and not echo chamber polls of a membership which can not look forward to 2020 . 
  at least we had a blue diving pool,
