  true . 
  but to say the left have creative control over the current narrative is a little naive . 
  the alt-right do have presents , weather or not its part of the `` mainstream '' i think is becoming increasing irreverent in the age of the internet . 
  i do n't think that necessarily true . 
  cultural and creative presence is build atop people just talking to one another , there is a large portion of the populace that are sympathetic to their cause . 
  it 's been building for a while now . 
  whether or not `` progressives '' acknowledge them is almost an irrelevance to the strength of the movement . 
   sounds like you 've been listening to too much progressive fear-mongering, 
  nice assumption there . 
  you can ignore and belittle them all you like . 
  i also think it 's worth noting that you 've reduced the discussion into a false dichotomy . 
   the alt-right is just a few thousand obscure neets online , mostly in america . 
  i agree that the movement originated in america , but due to similarities in culture and langue the anglosphere seems to be importing it wholesale . 
   [ . . ] most people have never even heard of terms like ` white ethnostate ' and ` race realism ' [ . . ], 
  being unaware of academic terms bear little on whether or not people agree with them . 
  nobody need to know the term ` white ethnostate ' to be against the immigration of brown people . 
  [ i 'm sorry for being poor . 
  nah man , 11 % chance you 'll appear on both subs . 
  stop , please . 
  i ca n't take anymore . 
   but how have i been able to have one serious relationship i 've ever had ? 
  [ selection bias . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/selection_bias ) you 're not noticing all those who fail to even get into a relationship . 
  moooooooo, 
  it 's been floating around for a while now . 
  i 've never heard it referred to in any other way . 
  up until now , how to you reference this ? 
  oh alright . 
  no need to apologies i was being a bit thick too . 
   lawson was probably only invited on because he knows a producer or two . 
  ah it 's alright guys , it 's just good ol' fashion cronyism . 
   i do n't think anyone serious denies climate change ,, 
  lawson literally said the globe had cooled slightly over the past 10 years . 
  seems to me like an outright denial . 
  here 's the ootl . 
  it 's getting seriously out of hand though . 
  there are faction being created . 
  is it doge ? 
  history does n't repeat itself , but it sure as hell rhymes . 
  at the risk of taking your comment with sincerity , the reason he 's not condemning both sides , is only one said committed an act of violence . 
  unlike in the other place , were both sides committed acts of violence . 
  look , i 'm not willing to get into a debate about american politics on / r/ukpolitics nor , do i plan to defend the actions of the `` anti `` fa . 
  althought i do have more sympathy towards them than the trumpets both sides are currently being beyond ridiculous . 
  all i was stating was possible motive behind corbyns ( pbuh ) words . 
  fair , fair . 
  pint on me ,, 
  [ sure thing . 
  / u/waterguy12, 
   makes it hard to build great public architecture . 
  you mean publicly funded but close to the public , yeah no . 
   a committee with many aesthetic viewpoints which results in `` the least offensive '' building . 
  i can see what you 're driving at here , i just see the two things as different problems . 
  i 'm not a fan of the government spending money so that private owners can profit , this is of course , i believe , is distinct from the plague of `` designs by committee '' . 
  aesthetic changes over time . 
  what looks bad now may look good in the future . 
  ( looking at you 3rd gen rx-7 's ), 
  4/5 hottest articles are about trump . 
  i think not . 
  more , / r/trp not enough misogyny for / r/incel , but i winced at that too . 
  i do wonder if their are any studies that could settle weather that stat hold up one way or another . 
  do n't go importing americas bullshit into our country . 
  ( ( ( the left ) ) ), 
  also ; 2015 hung parliament never forget . 
  admittedly i laughed , however i feel compelled to point out that not everybody on the left is mathematically illiterate . 
  tht 's some r/hqg right there . 
  i did find the interesting . 
  i was expecting someone to post that . 
  labour mp 's lack a basic understanding of probability . 
  and it does hint at a deeper problem with the general `` culture '' of the left . 
  which often leaves me bashing my head against the desk . 
  i find mathematical argument to be some of the most convincing . 
  which being on the `` left '' leaves me in poor company . 
   sure you 're not centre left ? 
  i 'm not a fan of the terms left and right , so i tend to use them begrudgingly . 
  as such i do n't see much point in refining the bullshit of left and right , to centre-left , centre-right . 
  since the definition of either ; changes year on year , and location to location . 
  rolling a turd in glitter and all that . 
  implying i know any scientist or academic . 
  firstly , just because academics are left learning , does n't imply that those who lean left are academics . 
  secondly , i was more speaking to my personal experience of left leaning voters . 
  are you sure about that ? 
  * can pee standing up, 
  oh so like nuking the fridge . 
  * i think * by mining they mean crypto currency mining . 
  even then , amd has that market cornered . 
  it 's get even worse once you head north outta norwich . 
  the eu would 've acted in in britain 's interest had we elected representative that actually show up . 
  zero hour contracts hide the true rate . 
  depends on you 're definition of unemployed . 
  since the official figures are unreliable now , we have to look to others do look into it . 
  the [ new statesman ] ( http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/economy/2016/03/hidden-truth-behind-george-osborne-s-record-jobs ) puts it around 12 % .
