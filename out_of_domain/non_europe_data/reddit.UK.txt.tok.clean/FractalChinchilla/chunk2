  they produce nonsensical answers . 
  they say that time and space does n't exist , that this thing has infinite density . 
  so far the laws of physics have always shown continuity , i see no reason for this to to change . 
  this leads to the conclusion that our current understanding of physics is , at least partially , flawed . 
  the current laws , are good for dealing with everyday phenomenon but loss accuracy at extreme scale . 
  take for example size ; from small ( quarks ) to large ( galaxies ) . 
  it is fair to say we have a pretty good grasp on what happens in between , but what about outside this range ? 
  what goes on in the range smaller than quarks ? 
  are they themselves made up of smaller string like things ? 
  what 's going on at scale larger than galaxies ? 
  what 's up with dark energy ? 
  where 's that coming from ? 
  the short answer ; we simply do not know . 
  it the same deal with black holes . 
  pfft , get your evidence out of here . 
  it is true on average women are smarter than men . 
  however the standard deviation ( the spread ) of men is larger than women . 
  put otherwise , the smartest of the smart and the dumbest of the dumb are more likely to be male . 
  huh , i stand corrected , i 'm on my mobile so ca n't cite my sources , but it was an older study . 
  clearly you have the right idea . 
  hmm , maybe a northern hemisphere thing then ? 
  do n't worry guys , he 's just gone for a rad weekend of waterboarding at guantanamo bay . 
   unfazed, 
  wait . 
  what . 
  my whole life has been a lie !, 
  [ ( again ) ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/fallout/comments/3cwtlk/fans_of_the_original_games_what_was_it_like_when/cszwcey ), 
   for some reason these people 's ability to think objectively and critically has been damaged . 
  i 'm starting to notice that this correlates with ages , after a while it just seems everyone 's like , `` nah fuck it , thinking is hard i 'm just going to believe this from now on . '', 
   you think the answer is to create a nationalised amazon , google and starbucks , and ban these companies from the uk ? 
  the sentiment of this i agree with . 
   oh , to be a naive student again ... 
  have a downvote . 
  to expand , i agree with the sentiment that there is n't a viable alternative to replacing these companies . 
  however the assertion that a ) the poster was student and b ) implying they 're all na\u00efve , is an over sweeping generalization that discredits a portion of the population with no real justification to it , other than to stifle any further conversation with / u/hazybrigade . 
  what aircraft is he sitting in ? 
  ca n't for the life of me figure it out . 
  b2b ( business to business ) and b2c ( business to consumer ) companies . 
  so what the title means is just companies ? 
  okay . 
  i 'll show myself out . 
  i thought driverless cars were ubers ( read : alphabets , formerly google ) long term plan . 
  and tbh , i really do n't care for their jobs , or their livelihood , or their cartel . 
  one way or another they want propping up by other people , might as well be upfront about it and rely on social security . 
  until they can respecialise . 
  ah yes , mob justice . 
  all its need to be is safer than the average driver . 
  surely that more of an advertisement issue then ? 
  i fully understand what you mean . 
  people have a flair towards and to remember dramatic events . 
  its why sharks are more feared than coconuts . 
  but as you say its all psychological , so i am propagating the idea that they just need to be safer . 
  so when , and it is when , the first big disaster occurs , people * may * be more inclined to think critically about it . 
  well go on then . 
  list these countries , shows how they are predominantly under american influence , add the area of said countries , and show that the total is greater than the british empire . 
  all you done so far is assert that you are right . 
  referencing your academic achievement ( which is just an appeal to authority , making it a fallacy ), 
  do n't tell us you are correct , show us with facts and figures . 
  i ai n't upset , i was merely explaining why so many people down voted you . 
  and no , the onus is on the one who makes the claim to prove it 's correct . 
  i thought it was widely accepted within the filed of psychology that most people believe their own moral code is superior than the average . 
   does n't china have a policy of making all politicians do two years manual labour ? 
  i 've tried google , but could someone give a source on that question . 
  dafuq i just watch ? 
  i think the point here is to quote cameron , quoting corbyn out of context , out of context . 
  contexception . 
  in further revelation bbc , stands for the british broadcasting corporation . 
   democratic people 's republic of korea, 
  see they even have the democrats/republican thing going on . 
  well , these two mods together maybe what you are looking for . 
  good , i see that it 's spreading . 
  anyway let 's backtrack here , this is all to do with british internal politics . 
  recently the labour ( the left wing party ) lost the general election , the leader ( [ ed miillband ] ( http://i1.walesonline.co.uk/incoming/article8521638.ece/alternates/s615b/ed-miliband-bacon.jpg ) ) steps down and a new leadership contest is held . 
  in comes the rank outsider [ jeremy corbyn ] ( http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03328/jeremy-corbyn-10_c_3328947b.jpg ) . 
  if you 're american he 's a bernie sanders kinda character . 
  a `` proper '' democratic socialist , republican to boot . 
  initially , he was at odds 100 - 1 to win . 
  but turns out the labour members are fed up of fake [ plastic ] ( http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/65c5/production/_84435062_028115744-1.jpg ) politics , and he wins , much to the dismay of many of the mp within the party . 
  who discredit him as being too far to the left . 
  of course new leader , old standard questions and topics come up . 
  one comes up about his views on osama bin laden . 
   `` no attempt whatsoever that i can see to arrest him and put him on trial , to go through that process '' . 
  he went on : `` this was an assassination attempt , and is yet another tragedy , upon a tragedy , upon a tragedy . 
   `` the world trade center was a tragedy , the attack on afghanistan was a tragedy , the war in iraq was a tragedy . 
  tens of thousands of people have died . 
  torture has come back on to the world stage , been canonised virtually into law by guant\u00e1namo and bagram . 
  the conservatives , and thus david cameron , took this too their spin doctor who turned it into this . 
   labour are now a serious risk to our national security, 
   jeremy corbyn believes bin ladens death is a tragedy, 
  taking his quote out of context . 
  which bring us upto a few days ago , to the conservatives party conference . 
  again cameron mentions this corbyn quote , but now the shoe in on the [ other foot .

  edit : tl : dr [ here 's a video ] ( https://youtu.be/u58ut4rsgyk ), 
  i 'm not sure why afghan is being mentions , maybe there 's more to it than what i 'm seeing . 
  but that 's pretty much the reasoning for it 's appearance within the british press/subs at least . 
  the artificial leaf from last year was a `` concept '' drawn up by some art student . 
  nothing more than `` hey would n't this be cool '' . 
  this design actually works in reality . 
  superficially they look the same , granted , but this is functional .
