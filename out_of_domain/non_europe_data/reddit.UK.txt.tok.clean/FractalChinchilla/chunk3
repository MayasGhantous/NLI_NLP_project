  spoken like a true commie . 
  well for starters , present balanced views ins r.s. 
  classes . 
  secondly remove the bishops from the house of lords . 
  thirdly , remove/reinvent the monarch since they only rule through divine right . 
  and thats just of the top of my head . 
  [ the onion ] ( http://www.theonion.com/ ) , is an american satirical news website . 
  / r/nottheonion is a subreddit dedicated to news stories , that at first glace would appear satirical , but in actuality are real story and real events . 
  get your evidence out of here . 
  we have a narrative to push here !!!!, 
  also , what 's distributivist syndicalism ? 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ from ^ ^ ^ ^ ourselves, 
   * of months *, 
  i think you dropped this , here you go !, 
  everboby down !!, 
  i think there 's a snip -, 
  yup . 
  they could n't possibly all want that , they be conforming to society . 
  i do n't follow ,, 
   anecdotal evidence is not evidence, 
  but you used exactly that to support your position . 
  i was showing the hypocrisy of your statement . 
  if my line or reasoning does n't hold , ( which it should n't ) neither should yours . 
  society exerts pressure/expectations on all individual , some [ positive ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%e2%80%9cwomen_are_wonderful%e2%80%9d_effect ) some [ negative ] ( http://www.ted.com/talks/sheryl_sandberg_why_we_have_too_few_women_leaders?language=en#t-154023 ) . 
  i would agree that women in this day and age still face a glass ceiling , but they also have the support of a glass floor . 
  but ultimately , it 's up to the women to decide what it is they desire from life . 
  honestly , i find this whole position objectifying . 
  as if women are objects acted upon by society while having no free agency of their own . 
  i disagree with the premise of the societal expectation on men . 
  we put more pressured onto our boys to take more risk , which results in a higher percentage of the successful being male , true , but it also mean a higher percentage of failure being male . 
  you ca n't achieve equality without equality , more women at the top will also mean more women at the bottom . 
  otherwise you 're not fighting for true equality , just the society benefits of equality , without any of the responsibility . 
  i do n't think you quite understood what i meant . 
  tbf , every other major organisation can follow your shopping data , the government are just late to the party . 
  i would n't have a problem with any of this if i have any trust in the government what so ever to display competence . 
  shopping data could be useful , example ; prioritizing what transport link need developing and the like . 
  we seem to be happy to give our data to faceless , private corporations . 
  but a democratically elected government ? 
  no , no , no . 
  think it speaks something about this world . 
  but alas , they do not display competence . 
  for that matter i have little faith in these other organisation , either . 
  but it 's the world we live in . 
  in principle there is nothing wrong with that . 
  the idea of government is to govern , the more informed their decision , the better the policy . 
  to what ends this data is used is a different question entirely , one of which i 'm very aware of the dangers . 
  but it 's impossible to effective govern if you have no idea what the populace wants/needs/is doing . 
  there is a wealth of data available in the world we live in that could be ultilise for desirable ends . 
  i 'd agree the government has gotten along okay without it , but i find that to be weak . 
  the x has gotten along okay without y , position always is , omho . 
  the world has gotten along okay without the internet . 
  the state has gotten along okay without democracy . 
  the shipping industry has gotten along okay without steam power . 
  [ the cave man has gotten along okay without bronze . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtlyxamrvk4 ), 
  these are all phases that have probably been uttered throughout history . 
   only serves to strengthen their power amd ability to keep the populous under control . 
  we could debate the balance of power until the cows come home . 
  but i 'm just going to jump the gun and agree , that balance of power is something that should be watched . 
  however keeping the populous under control is essential to civil society . 
  we would n't be living in a world with computer , planes , medicine , hot water taps , cheap imported food , electricity , without a stable , ( and hence controled ) populous . 
  but again , to what ends do they hope to achieve is a different question . 
  it does concern me , the current direction the government is heading , the plutocracy that we live in , the imbalance of wealth and power . 
  however these worries are not intrinsic to these kind of policy , its is intrinsic to way in which they are used . 
  all i 'm trying to raise awareness of is that , thing such as this could be used to the benefit of everyone , and should n't be dismissed out of hand , straight away . 
  out of the 3 which do you think looks most promising ? 
  in all honestly , i agree that these measure go to far , and overstep the mark . 
  just one day , i would be open to the idea of collection of such data if it can be shown to being put to `` good '' use . 
  more efficient allocation of funds . 
  got ta love mitchell and webb . 
  speaking of [ fascist ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tokcmnre5oy ), 
  in the same way the dprk are a democracy ? 
  the illusion of choice , does n't make it a choice . 
  care to elaborate ? 
  every since i asked you about distributive syndicalism , [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_cognitive_biases#frequency_illusion ) , this is you now . 
  [ when you do things right , people wo n't be sure you 've done anything at all ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edcqf_ntpoq ), 
  i am happy this is a thing . 
  no , no it is n't ? 
  it should be neutral , but it 's not . 
  too much money to be made from denying its effects . 
  but but but . 
  m ` ladies !!,

  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ tell ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ me ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ your ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ secrets , ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ please . 
  so the chinesse system is better ? 
  i do n't get what your trying to say . 
  i do n't see how it limits freedom of expression . 
  i 'm aware of the china = repression . 
  but i do n't see how that applies here . 
  if anything it makes people more aware of the consequences of their actions . 
  if you consider that limiting freedom of expression , then whats the alternative implication ? 
  we should encourage everyone to be as arseholey as possible , to promote freedom of expression ? 
  we 're still free to say fuck the police . 
  but be aware that we will make ourselves suspicious . 
  by how much ? 
  a ) by x amount, 
  b ) we 're not telling you .
