  a fact is fact . 
  few critique of facts can be made , ( you can call into question the validity or reliability of said fact , but that 's about all ) . 
  we could comment on these fact , and exchange opinions , sure . 
  in order to do so we would require some context to these facts . 
  the only context we are given is the arbitrary colour coding , which does the uninformed reader ( such as myself ) no good . 
  i 'm not even sure what half these acronyms mean . 
  this is complex subject that requires a more nuance approach than one table . 
  as for yourself ? 
  well , pulling out insults ;, 
   across like some angry a-level politics student, 
   vie for an internet meme-filled, 
  lacking coherent sentance structure ,, 
   why seemingly ? 
  that 's exactly what it is ... 
  but it 's not an opinion , either . 
  unless , of course ,, 
  throwing red herrings ,, 
   willing to highlight with is false information ? 
  and condescending tone ,, 
   just read the table without noting the colours if it 's bothering you so much, 
  is not the demeanor of anyone i would come close to considering `` reasonable '' . 
  these comments are distinctly * unreasonable * . 
  this is such a low effort post i 'd rather go look at dank fish memes . 
  looks like [ scatterer ] ( https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/700/scatterer ) . 
  i know what they are , but i would like to hear your reasoning for putting them on your list . 
   the middle and working class are ridiculous hard to differentiate . 
  so what you 're saying is with live in a plutocracy . 
  i agree . 
   the `` problem '' generation, 
  the baby boomers . 
  i did n't realise such churches were built in the colonies . 
  sweet . 
  very catholic . 
  it looks a whole lot older than it actually is . 
  since we 're onto cathedrals , [ here 's ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/norwich_cathedral ) my local . 
  it was originally catholic but was seized during the reformation . 
  so they built another [ one . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/st_john_the_baptist_cathedral,_norwich ), 
  that is one hell of a set of organs . 
  the size of the building around it kinda put into perspective how tall american cities are . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.visitnorfolk.co.uk/img/header-carousel/cityskylinesunset.jpg ) the tallest thing * is * the cathedral . 
   saw through operation clusterfuck, 
  no , it was a ` armless mistake . 
  it 's because she can only drink [ this ] ( http://blog.greggman.com/images/random/liquor/dooleys.jpg ), 
   then the economy is probably so damaged that you have much much bigger problems, 
  i think you 've hit the nail on there head there . 
  even if you do n't realise it . 
   do you really think labour will survive headlines about how millionaires and billionaires are getting # 1,500 a month in benefits, 
  it for that reason that i 'd prefer a negative income tax . 
  functionally they are the same . 
  but a nit requires a basic understanding of maths . 
  which a lot of people seem to struggle with . 
  so really that 's just moving the problem across . 
  i wish the english could devolve from westminster too . 
  mandatory : [ understand grexit ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ue9ek9ttsg ), 
  maybe . 
  maybe . 
  still i 'd like to think the uk would do better under a federal system . 
   free trade aside . 
  is n't that one of the major plus points ? 
  yes . 
   like curious sharks chomping on the cable, 
  [ from further up the thread ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmxkrh7sx84 ), 
  / u/malcontentreynolds worst advice award - 2016, 
  i 'm late . 
  during the 60 's bell developed the video phone and was laying the back bones for the internet . 
   taiwan was basically the government of pre communist china . 
  wait what ? 
  til . 
  nah , you just do n't like doing your chores . 
  all it is . 
   anyone that 's brown, 
  at no point , did read anything about race in those posters . 
  only suspicious looking behaviour . 
  pro tip : it 's spelled whole , because . 
  of reasons . 
  a hole is a big thing empty gap in the ground . 
  bonus tip : `` i am '' can be contracted to `` i 'm '', 
  that was n't my intention . 
  english can be hard . 
  spoken like a true forward thinking bristolian . 
  oh so that 's what that tab does . 
  for a second there i though i was in / r/jokes, 
   moral authority, 
  they lost that , when imposing impossible term onto greece . 
  maybe it 's a ploy of the mods over at / r/gifsthatendtoosoon to gain exposure . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntkf3htvnxs ) a mirror of the interview on youtube . 
  not at all . 
  it 's just easy . 
  the way i see it being used so much is there is this one metric , the economy , to which everything is measured and it helps with the dick waving competition people like to have . 
  unfortunately i do n't see it going away anytime soon , mostly because i ca n't envisage any alternative . 
  but you 're right . 
  `` the economy '' , disproportionately represents the wealthy . 
   bandages , beans , butt sex, 
  one of those is unlike the others . 
  o , right . 
  my bad . 
  check out mountain dews `` hitler did nothing wrong '' vote . 
   how does the government decide what should be excepted ? 
  for all intent and purpose they roll a d20 .
