  ( with a +14 modifier with the `` social acceptability '' trait ), 
   do you really want losers as an integral part of your government ? 
  when those `` losers '' represent the will of ~ 70 % of the electorate . 
  yes . 
  yes i do . 
   what are the actual offences ? 
  my friend , you are asking the wrong question . 
  try asking , how do they decided what is an offence ? 
  by rolling a dice of course !, 
   i feel like they should be used more like diplomats in eu4 to improve relations . 
  yes . 
  just an extra option in the outliner . 
  `` embassy location '' . 
  as it stand at the moment going into the contact screen finding your empire then view your relations takes way to long . 
  it would be nice if they added that trading system in stellaris . 
  distinct lack of trade ships in this game . 
  the ai is a little buggy when it comes to this . 
  as you can see their are no enemy troops on that planet . 
  send 1 loads of troops to liberate your planet . 
  and you 'll have it back . 
  no need to level the defenses . 
  ( there 's no one manning them ) . 
  as a side note ; when you invade , let me know if you have any strange bugs . 
  because i 've had a few but i 'd like some repetition . 
  you can use shift to line up commands . 
  atm that 's the best you can do . 
  i suppose the current system has it merits . 
  the thing that gets under my skin is if you line up , say 9 systems , to survey and you meet a hostile fleet in system 3 . 
  the science ship evades . 
  then proceeds to forgets about systems 4-9 . 
  like , okay , you do n't want to get hurt , i get that . 
  but please just continue with your mission . 
  well i tend to use wormholes . 
  so they flee back to a safe system . 
  but i get what your saying . 
  good to know . 
  is that what that cap is ? 
  huh . 
  yeah would be preferable to be able to line up more commands . 
  as far as i 'm aware . 
  no , it is n't possible to see a list of commands . 
   thats a ( i think european ) hare ,, 
  can confirm, 
  source : am european, 
  only one per campaign . 
  however there is a mod that allows all 3 . 
   why such a heavy fine for stacking pallets like that ? 
  if the probability of accident multiplied by expected claim is greater than the fine . 
  it make economic sense for the business to to account for the fine as `` cost of business '' because in the long run they save money . 
   i think humans would be much more efficient without wasting time and resources on attempting to remain separate and refocus these resources on bettering the race as a while . 
  i do not believe politics is in the best interest of the many . 
  but rather the few at the expense of the many, 
  erm . 
   bettering the race as a while, 
  erm . 
   while, 
  do n't you mean . 
  whole . 
  i know , i and o are next to each other on the keyboard . 
  but you claim not to have a keyboard . 
  the end of the second video , no less . 
  hey , hey , hey now . 
  did n't you get the memo ? 
  we believe in austerity here , none of the keynesian economics thank you very much . 
   and therefore 27 % of ~ ~ the population ~ ~ * those who voted * want a 2nd referendum . 
  ftfy, 
  yes , and spending it on welfare , pension , ect , is still spending . 
  they just take it out the economy and sit on it . 
  meow ? 
  why would i say meow ? 
  meow then let get back to the serious business of gifing . 
  but it specifically was n't a vote against changing the system . 
  the question on the ballot paper was n't `` should we change our voting system to something other than fptp '' it was more , `` which one do you prefer , av or fptp . '', 
  all that referendum shows is there is little appetite for av . 
  it says nothing about the peoples desire for various forms of pr . 
   this sub seems strangely nicer than other subs . 
  because we all know we 're cunts . 
  no moral high ground to be fought over . 
   i do n't know how you determined the `` political instability '' other than as a reference to a lack of a voice in the european parliament ? 
  i 'm going to take a guess , and assume you 're not british . 
  either that or you just have n't been paying attention . 
  underrated comment . 
  [ it all makes sense now . 
  ] ( http://generated.inspirobot.me/031/axm8627xju.jpg ), 
  so i 've played about with this , ( trying to get binary systems in the game ) and made [ this ] ( http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=695516797 ) mod . 
  i you download it . 
  i * think * i annotated the script well enough that you could learn as you go . 
  as well as that , in the stellaris directory . 
  ( for me this is, 
  c : \\ program files ( x86 ) \\ steam \\ steamapps \\ common \\ stellaris \\ common \\ solar_system_initializers ), 
  there 's a . txt called example.txt that will run you through most of the variables . 
  with in the same folder is the the script the generates the sol system ( within the prescripted_species_systems ) . 
  so between those three you should be able to put everything together . 
  let me know if you have more questions . 
   and there are many tools that automatically distort the texture based on the 3d model just like here . 
  no , not just like here . 
  it is the geometry behind the distortion which is unique and novel here . 
  they would be the fallen empires . 
  pretty placid people , that have long ago became apathetic to the going on in the galaxy . 
  just do n't upset them and they wo n't care about you .
