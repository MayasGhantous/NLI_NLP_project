  these are different to advanced empires . 
  which are like regular ai , ( they fight , trade , develope , colonise ) but they start of with 4/5 colonies and a slight tech lead . 
  i think at least , boarder friction should be tied to trust . 
  make sense to me the more the ai trust you the less tension they 'll be on the boarder, 
  from what i understand , is it uses the newest design you have . 
  there is no way to pick . 
  it 's a feature not a bug . 
  a really handy feature . 
  yeah i know , what you say makes total sense , and i would class it as a bug . 
  but i 've come to depend on this behaviour . 
  so how this causally goes for me is like this . 
  constantly run a small energy margin . 
  war a commin ', 
  3 . build battleships like there 's no tomorrow . 
  go over fleet limit by quite a margin ( energy starts to disappear ), 
  5 . quickly build all of the space ports and all of the upgrades . 
  yeah , my energy engagement needs to improve . 
  yeah , pretty much . 
  the penalty for going over the limit get real big real fast . 
  so it 's just nice to be able to sort that retroactively . 
  yeah , i think it 's only fair if the op points out what we 're looking at . 
  i 'd call it er . 
  . rule 5 . 
  anyway what you are looking at is some strong enemies surrounding the starting system . 
  paradox have expressed intentions to add this sooner or later . 
  maybe the next patch or the one after .

  after just trying to test it . 
  apparently not . 
  i 'll get back to you once i 've figured out which mods is causing the crash . 
  edit : everything works except ; new ship classes and more , and , asimov unofficial patch . 
   i remember people saying `` but look at the ftse 250 for the real numbers '', 
  like me !, 
  well at least i agree with the sentiment , and i still stand by that . 
  the ftse 250 is a better indicator of the health of the british economy than the ftse 100 , i 've believed that a for a few years , probably why i have no difficulty saying this is encouraging news . 
   that only requires a simple majority to pass . 
  true but not the whole truth . 
  just like any other act of parliament it 'll have to go through the hol for review before the repeal becomes law . 
  without the cooperation of the hol the commons needss a 2/3 majority . 
  the voting age should be raised to 25 . 
  since the brain does n't fully finish developing until that age . 
  within this game , for wormholes , it does n't matter . 
  i think what op is pointing out is the lack of consistency across the two . 
   the second is also fairly simple . 
  i 've several times run into anomalies in the mid or late game which required a level 4 or 5 scientist and simply not having one . 
  and needing to wait for years to train up via research . 
  not fun . 
  stick the scientist in a ship , then use that ship to assist research . 
  they 'll level up quicker . 
   starting to question these so called experts .

  it does . 
  more or less . 
  you can create the galaxy then create the system , edit said system , then go and take the initialiser for that system out of the save file . 
  it 's a round about method of doing things , but it is quicker and more intuitive than text file editing . 
  i myself use this to get the general layout , spacing and feel for the system then tweaking it through notepad + + to perfect it . 
  no problem .

  thought it looked familiar , norwich represent !!, 
  [ these are alternative forms of the past tense and past participle of the verb learn . 
  both are acceptable , but learned is often used in both british english and american english , while learnt is much more common in british english than in american english .

  i thought that was their point . 
  [ iberian peninsula ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iberian_peninsula ), 
  send help . 
  can i get a source ? 
   determined by electric resistance, 
  explain orbital mechanics then , referencing electric resistance where applicable . 
  and no true scotsmans would add sugar to their oats . 
   wo n't explain and ca n't explain are n't the same thing . 
  although true , from an outside perspective , ( ie the `` stupid listener '' ) they appear the same . 
  i find `` femsplaining '' rolls off the tongue better than `` womansplaining '' , either or . 
  maybe , [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt0i-sdosxu ) will help clear thing up . 
  those are all perfectly valid critiques , and if the following does n't convince you , then that 's okay , i just believe we should start seriously having this conversation . 
   . the issue that springs to mind is that it would double the number of mps at a stroke . 
  if that is your main concern , we could either half the number of local representative , with the rest of the seats filling up the proportions , or , keep the mp and elect the lords in a proportional fashion . 
   secondly , i can see a huge number of extra ` safe ' seats being created . 
  any mp who is # 1 on the party list for labor in a conservative area or vice versa is pretty much guaranteed a seat no ? 
  yes , in a way it would , but those safe seats are giving to the party most under-represented . 
  for example , despite my personal disdain for ukip , they did get 14 % of the vote in the last ge , while only receiving , ~ 0.15 % of power in the common . 
  those `` safe '' seats would go to towards making up ukips missing 13.85 % , as best we can with a finite set .

  this is what i see every time fptp is mentioned . 
  my problem with fptp is that does a piss poor job of representing the will of the people .
