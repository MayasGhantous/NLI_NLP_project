  which leads to those who are not in the majority , to be ignored . 
  which just increase tension . 
   also , would n't you would also have the strange phenomenon of of - say - the # 1 on the labor party list hoping that the conservatives beat the local labor candidate , so that he gets a seat ? 
  if that does end up occurring i believe it a price worth paying for an accurate representation . 
  germany , netherlands and new zeeland have similar systems and i ca n't recall hearing about any of those kinds of situations . 
  can confirm . 
  source : am millennial, 
  liberia landed on the moon ? 
  russia is communist ? 
  were n't so reliant on the banking sector . 
  i ` member when they cost 5p . 
  nor is it the consideration of the [ conservatives ] ( https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/theresa-may-and-her-aides-tried-to-alter-drug-report-because-they-didn-t-like-the-conclusions-nick-a6988616.html ) . 
  this only raises more question . 
  may-may gettin ' cray-cray . 
  anything is possible these days . 
  a , for effort . 
  i 'm sure this is going to get buried since its 8 hours after op , but i think it 's worth pointing out that british citizen already had this right under echr . 
  so this is nothing noteworthy . 
  so why do the gen z hate them ? 
  considering most gen z'ers are still in school ? 
  who do you mean when you say , `` the left '' ? 
  i 'm sure its one of the following :, 
  not written on the side of a bus . 
  they 're expert and therefore worthless . 
  rabble rabble corbyn rabble abbott rabble maths . 
  i think / u/goldmedalsharter was referring to the two rules of dating ;, 
  be attractive, 
  do n't be not attractive, 
  i think rule 2 is more achievable . 
  just focus on that . 
  weak and wobbly, 
   policy costed by the diane abbot school of mathematics . 
  now now , credit where credits due . 
  this is clearly from theresa mays school of fuck the poor . 
  m/s/s = m/s ^ 2, 
  m / ( s/s ) = m / ( s ^ 2 ), 
  s/s = s ^ 2, 
  there are 10 types of people in this world . 
  those who understand binary , those who do n't , and those who expected this joke to be in base 3 . 
  he has a long history of misleading the public . 
  it 's no surprise then , that a few people wo n't believe anything he says . 
  anything he does ? 
  well , that 's a different story , although he has yet to do anything about it . 
  time will tell . 
  out of the two in question , labours policies have been costed . 
  unlike the tories , and given that the tories have missed every deficit reduction target , and immigration target they 've * set themselves * , i 'd be hesitant to believe them even if it was . 
  i disagree with your example . 
  ~ ~ the deficit is as high as it ever been in recent times . ~ ~ the tory 's economic policies simply are not working as advertised . 
  austerity does not work for britain . 
   ifs has cast doubt on them . 
  and the imf has cast doubts on the tories policies of austerity . 
   they 're also using capital spending as a massive rug to hide things under . 
  stuff is classed as `` borrowing to invest '', 
  you mean how the tories sold off public asset to cover day to day runnings of the government and to make reduce the deficit . 
   when it 's really just cost of pointless ideological nationalisation . 
  how is it ideological to say the profits from the rails should go back into investing in the rail . 
  same deal with our energy grid , except our energy grid is nationalised , it 's just owned by the europen states . 
  why would it ? 
  she has a divine mandate on her side . 
   not really . 
  polls are only unreliable when they do n't agree with me . 
  sure thing , buddy . 
  how would know a shy labourite if they did n't tell you they were labour ? 
  i 'm not sure where you 're getting 2017 numbers from , but it was about 3 % for 2016 . 
  which is a large reduction . 
  so i concede my previous point . 
  already regained notoriety . 
  i am curious though , as to who you were in a former life . 
  #strong and stable, 
   semantics dont you think, 
  no , i do n't think it 's purely semantics . 
  nuance and perspective . 
   he doesnt want to admit that if labour took power the first thing he would do is scrap trident, 
  we do n't elect a dictator for 5 years . 
  there 's no way he 'd get that through parliament . 
  mate , what is your dysfunction ? 
  should n't you be studying for your ks2 exams ? 
  it would n't depend on the majority . 
  because the majority of mp are in support of trident . 
  if corbyn takes the suicidal move to go back on a manifesto promise and refuses to renew trident , then some mp 's will write up an edm for it and sail it through the commons .

  cheers mate . 
  first time today , no disagreement there . 
  do n't worry the election is over soon . 
  then we can go back to normal . 
   ira wing of labour, 
  wonder why you think that . 
  this has meme potential . 
   the plant sitting on my desk can be compared with the tories , it 's withering away right now because it 's owner is a terrible horticulurist and has done a terrible job at keeping it alive, 
  * technically * he did n't lie . 
  the premature baby needs hospital equipment , not an electoral reform . 
  do n't disagree with that , i was just referencing [ this ] ( https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/admin/bkfill/default_image_group/2011/2/25/1298628970292/no-to-av-baby-campaign-005.jpg?w=700&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=8844341ed4a73c55b54e2da6c54e3f29 ) . 
  that advert was making the rounds at the time of the av vote ( 2010 ? ) . 
  part of the official `` vote no '' campaign . 
  for more shits and giggle a quick [ google ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=av+vote+no&amp;rlz=1c1chbf_en-gbgb740gb740&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjg64-0xppuahxdjcakhwl5c38q_auibigb&amp;biw=1536&amp;bih=734 ) will either entertain or disgust you . 
   though just think of the amount of figures he has to remember , he has to manage a political party at the same time as campaigning, 
  well , maybe politics is n't for him . 
  oh , corbyn is by far the lesser of two evils , imho . 
  but let 's not pretend he 's perfect .
