oh yes , i forgot to mention that i 'm using a tablet . 
  illustrator 's blob tool has been immensely helpful . 
  i 've heard about paint tool sai , but i 've been reluctant to use it because that involves casting aside all the expensive software i have ... 
  i think i 'll swallow my pride and give it a go though . 
  thanks for the warm welcome to / r/mlpdrawingclub , this is my first post on reddit !, 
  this is exactly what i needed !, 
  thank you so much . 
  the software you 're thinking of is probably paint tool sai . 
  i do n't know about the answer to your main question though . 
  alright , i was looking for an answer to the same problem and i think i found the closest you can get , which is the freeform pen tool . 
  it 's on the list when you click and hold on the pen tool . 
  it smooths out your lines a bit once you 've drawn them . 
  not quite as smoothly as illustrator 's blob tool , but it seems to do the same sort of thing . 
  it even has a magnetic option , so you can trace over things you 've drawn really easily . 
  i did n't even know it was possible to finish reading fallout : equestria . 
  a really excellent guide . 
  this should totally be sidebar 'd . 
  well , seeing as you 're there why not try to make the best of it you can ? 
  you 're surrounded by likeminded people because they like ponies and/or are fed up with the convention so that 's two talking points right there . 
  in the words of princess celestia ( as relayed through spike ) : make some friends !, 
  i understand that overall it might not be worth the money , but you can still try to get something out of it . 
  that 's really excellent !, 
  you got the pony shape spot on . 
  the only tiny thing i can pick up on is that ponies ( particularly female ponies ) tend to have a slightly thicker black line on the top half of their eye , implying an eyelid/eyelashes . 
  it just makes the eye look a little more natural sitting in the face . 
  that 's awesome , man . 
  fancy coming to a brony meetup ? 
  there 's one in london at the start february if you want to ... 
  thank you so much for posting this durghon . 
  it really brought a smile to my face and a tear to my eye . 
  i remember reading a comment that said each leaf has a 1/200 chance of dropping an apple and , while that does n't sound like a lot , each tree has about 50-60 leaves meaning there 's a 1/4 chance of any one tree dropping an apple . 
  that 's quite a lot . 
  chubs . 
  switches and ores !, 
  still , that 's 1/5 which is still a considerable amount . 
  if you 're looking for drawing feedback without getting buried , / r/mlpdrawingschool is probably what you 're looking for !, 
  so what exactly did you use in photoshop to make this ? 
  the pen tool or something much simpler ? 
  thanks much !, 
  that 'll be really helpful for when i finally step up to drawing ponies properly . 
  then it 's / r/mlpdrawingschool for me !, 
  as a brony , i resent this image . 
  yeah , it does take the right kind of person to become a brony . 
  i guess you 're not in touch with your inner kid enough ( especially if what you 're implying is the case ... ), 
  i dislike the font ( or at least the font colour ) , but the image itself is very pretty . 
  it does n't blend well with the image as a whole . 
  graphic design , bro !, 
  mcvtool works like a charm . 
  how did you spell ` brony ' wrong when it 's written in big bold letters on your t-shirt ?

  * how were you introduced to the show ? 
  i frequent a [ lego movie making forum ] ( http://www.bricksinmotion.com/ ) . 
  one day in dull july , a highly respected member changed his avatar to flutterguy . 
  i did n't know what it was , so i thought nothing of it . 
  then the owner of the site changed his to rainbow dash , and a few other members went pony . 
  i asked the first guy what it was and he told me . 
  it sounded like something i 'd like , so i looked up episode 1 and loved it . 
  i spent the next few weeks watching at least one episode per day . 
  * are you a fan of the show , currently ? 
  yes . 
  * was there any point where you stopped being a fan of the show ? 
  nope . 
  * if you answered yes to 2 and 3 , what brought you back ? 
  * as best as you can , list your favorite works of film , television , and literature and explain why . 
  hah , i find it hard to remember life before pony . 
  i stopped watching tv a long time ago ( the only show i watch every episode of is doctor who ) . 
  i find it hard to get into anything mainstream : all the music i listen to is made by internet-based artists , i tend to read books by authors with online presences ( john green ) and youtube is my cinema . 
  back on topic though , my favourite film is scott pilgrim , my favourite tv show is lost ( the only tv show i have seen every episode of , other than fim ) and my favourite book is of mice and men . 
  * what elements of my little pony intrigue you the most ? 
  why ? 
  i 'm hardly the toughest guy i know , so this seemed a perfect thing for me to join in with . 
  the show itself is brilliant , but i 've found that i 'm not really in the fandom for the show . 
  i feel like i watch it to get the jokes and fandom references , to be able to join in with discussions and get inspiration . 
  i think i 'm in more for the fandom than the show itself . 
  * if you were to place yourself in a socioeconomic class , what would that be ? 
  i hate that term though . 
  * do you consider yourself involved with another fanbase or culture outside of my little pony ? 
  if so , what do you do in this culture ? 
  the lego movie-making community is hardly a fandom , but that 's the closest i come . 
  * were there any unique elements to your childhood ( i.e. 
  family structure , traumatic events , fond memories ) ? 
  yes , but there are none that spring to mind immediately . 
  nothing really interesting kicked off for me until i found my lego movies . 
  * what would you say is the number one reason you watch my little pony ? 
  oh , it seems i 've already answered that one . 
  the fandom . 
  ( just because that 's the number one reason does n't mean it 's the only one ! ), 
  * would you say my little pony is the best animated show you have seen ? 
  if not , what is ? 
  i grew up on 90s/00s cartoon network ( more often than not with lauren faust on the production team , little did i know ) , so i 'd say this is on par with all of them . 
  my brother , sister and i were all massive fans of the powerpuff girls , and because there were three of us we all had a different powerpuff girl for each of us ( i was buttercup ) . 
  * would you say my little pony is better than the average animated show ?
