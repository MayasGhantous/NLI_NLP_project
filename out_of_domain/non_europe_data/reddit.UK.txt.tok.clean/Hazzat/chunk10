  i 'm really surprised at the clear introvert/extrovert distinctions people are making here , when i 've seen first hand that no one is doomed to be introverted forever . 
  they just need to meet the right people . 
  [ ] ( / rdawesome ) yeah , it 's awesome !, 
  [ ] ( / raritywut ) ... what is it ? 
  congrats on embarrassing us all . 
  i * think * it 's a way of sending a redstone signal directly down ... 
  hey , you 're that braveryjerk bot they were [ talking about in theoryofreddit ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/theoryofreddit/comments/10p30c/braveryjerk_bot_follows_the_reddit_api_but_is_it/ ) !, 
  this texture pack was clearly designed for a specific purpose ( adventure map , themed world , something like that ) a opposed to general use . 
  i was probably a little bit more excited than i should have been when something i built appeared in the background of sunshine of israpony ... 
  i 've got a screenshot around here somewhere ... 
  [ here it is , ponyville retirement home !,

  it looks so sad in hd . 
  it was certainly lost on many people here . 
  it 's not . 
  it 's what happens if you set your language to english ( australian ) .

  i 'll have to sell one on , but which one do i keep !, 
  [ ] ( / scootacheer ) why not paint it yourself ? 
  bring it up in / r/reportthespammers !, 
  edit : spelling, 
  all the available information is here : http://bronycon.org/, 
  the bronycon twitter feed recently revealed that they 'll be spending all of october working to secure a date and a venue . 
  they 'll be announced at the end of the month ( should all go according to plan ) . 
  they should have waited until he got back to take this . 
  it 's not the same without that flash of orange !, 
  i see a season 3 villain in there ...

  well , the nether is meant to be closer to the centre of the earth so gravity would be intensified . 
  and the end is , like , space . 
  do n't ruin the immersion !, 
  jeb is the * lead developer * . 
  i do n't imagine he just sits around occasionally coding something while dinnerbone 's at it 24/7 .

  [ ] ( / a03 ) downvotes are important in a subreddit to keep quality standards high .

  having spent hours upon hours on wild world and not played an animal crossing game since then , this trailer gave me a huge nostalgia blast an left with with an endearing smile on my face . 
  i can not wait for this game . 
  baby . 
  so i crawled from the twisted , burning wreckage . 
  i crawled on my hands and knees for three full days !, 
  draggin ' along my big leather suitcase , and my garment bag , and my leather saxophone , and my twelve-pound bowling ball and my lucky-lucky-lucky autographed glow-in-the-dark snorkel !, 
  so i grabbed his leg and he grabbed my oesophagus and i bit off his ear and he chewed off my eyebrows and i gave him a colonic irrigation , yes indeed you 'd better believe it !, 
  they 're talking about ghasts here . 
  it is literally impossible to hit an enderman with a projectile , they will * always * teleport away just before it hits them . 
   falling sand now properly `` pops '' when falling on non-solid blocks ( such as torches ), 
  * pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop *, 
  it 's a response to [ this post ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/minecraft/comments/11mosq/12w42a_emeralds_now_spawn_in_veins/ ) which incorrectly claims that emerald ore spawns in veins . 
  i want a sound pack with that pop replacing all the in-game pops !, 
  progress is being made . 
  they just started [ a blog ] ( http://dev.minecraft.net/blog/ ) to detail it . 
  image macro is image macro is image macro , whether it 's an advice animal or not . 
  the point is still the same : they take no effort at all to make and it 's saddening to see one make the front page when some art or a video that someone 's spent a long time making could be there instead . 
  this subreddit is by far the best large one i know for keeping low-quality content off its front page , but i do n't want to lose that . 
  [ ] ( / b09 `` love and tolerance , huh ? '' ), 
  i recommend you read [ this post ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/mylittlepony/comments/tacd6/weve_grown_a_lot_over_the_past_year_or_so_as_we/ ) about this sub , quality standards and why they 're important . 
  the eternal september concept revokes the idea that we should just let low content slide because it 's getting upvoted . 
  i like to think the dragon 's name is andy o. 
  because all through beta , your score when you died showed up as & e0 . 
  i ca n't give you a video , but :, 
  - the ender dragon roars and has dragony wing flapping sounds, 
  - the anvil makes a satisfying * clang * when you place it and drop it, 
  - bats squeak a lot, 
  - the wither 's kind of indescribable ( but it sounds great ) , you 'll have to find out that one for yourself !, 
  i 'm not really sure what you did there , but you doubled all the n 's in that link , this is what you were aiming for : http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/known_bugs/version_1.3.1,

  the dog itself looks fine , it 's the shadow that 's a bit wonky . 
  it 's not october 19th yet . 
  boomerang used to air it , but they did a shoddy job of broadcasting season 1 ( they showed the first half twice , and at an awkward time slot ) and season 2 has n't materialised yet . 
  it 's not currently on-air . 
  it 's not like notch alone owns , runs and makes decisions about minecraft . 
  ( heck , he 's not even the ceo of mojang . ), 
  no doubt they would have talked it over with their lawyers who said that it would be the right move to make . 
  it 's likely that microsoft said `` either minecraft exclusively on xbox , or no minecraft on xbox at all . '',
