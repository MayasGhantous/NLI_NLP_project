  here in europe it starts on saturday evening . 
  be gentle with jelonzo , he 's not from round these parts . 
  part of the game is watching what your teammates are up to , and responding appropriately on the fly . 
  if no one inked the base , then you only have yourself to blame . 
  yep , this is the issue . 
  post the jokes on / r/gravityfalls all you want , but be careful when entering other subs . 
  [ someone tried ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgmplmgpv8 ) , but they got a cease & desist . 
  the environments are just default ones that come with the unreal package . 
  there is n't really that much special here , all the video creator did was put a mario model in the engine . 
  for my first year at uni , the tv in the shared kitchen was eternally set to e4 . 
  it was nothing but that slogan all day , forever . 
  she 's in the pop t-shirt , so they 're trying to support it . 
  either that or she 's seen the light and chose to rebel against her foolish team !, 
  rock  poop *, 
  now this is one worth keeping nib . 
  i was a bit disappointed that all the great octoweapons foreshadowing never built up to anything . 
  i guess octavio 's dj booth was one , but i was expecting something truly world-threatening . 
  maybe we 'll see more of them in the next game . 
  [ here you go . 
  ] ( http://wolframalpha.com/input/?i=july+4+2015%2c+6pm+in+united+kingdom&amp;x=0&amp;y=0 ), 
  maybe it was just the eu translation , but both cap'n cuttlefish and the scrolls would n't stop talking about how the octarians used devastating great octoweapons to ( almost ) win the great turf war , and how they must have revived these weapons again for this new assault . 
  then we never saw them . 
  as for a sequel , splatoon has been such a success and nintendo has pushed it so hard that i think a spla2n is all but guaranteed . 
  it 's a long , long way off though . 
   the great octoweapons were the bosses . 
  . . i only just realised that all the bosses are machines . 
  it all makes sense now . 
  what happened to your as ? 
  [ the squid research lab confirmed that jellyfish ca n't speak the inkling language . 
  ] ( http://splatoonus.tumblr.com/post/110351920713/you-may-notice-some-jellyfish-wandering-among-the ), 
  removed for spoiler in the title . 
  what 's wrong here ? 
   since splatoon matches users together based on how they play , amano notes that those who tend to splat enemies are likely to play together . 
  likewise , those who concentrate on painting rather than splatting are more likely to get paired up . 
  now that 's interesting . 
  makes me wonder what kind of play style i fall into ... 
  lol kotaku , [ this was on the subreddit yesterday ] ( http://redd.it/3bfhx3 ) . 
  is that a problem ? 
  they both mean the same thing , just phrased a little differently . 
  there was n't a decision to change it , the na and eu translations were made by separate teams working from the original jp version . 
  extra time wins are always by 1 point - the timer stops the second you overtake and snatch the lead from the other team . 
  i 've had 0.2 % wins , but never that fabled 0.1 % ... 
  the messages come from `` on high '' . 
  many present-day japanese offices still use fax machines for everything , so i really was n't surprised when i saw the message being delivered by fax . 
  we do n't know . 
  [ the patch notes ] ( http://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/14946 ) do n't say . 
  it 's part of his exoskeleton . 
  if you want changed made to the subreddit , [ message the moderators ] ( http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2fsplatoon ) directly . 
  you wo n't get far by just throwing your suggestion out randomly . 
  it 's like a fairground ride ... 
  i want to get off mr. inkling 's wild ride !, 
  i think i 've played it every single day since launch . 
  i could n't put it down if i wanted to ... 
  yahtzee of zero punctuation wrote [ a piece ] ( http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/video-games/columns/extra-punctuation/14125-splatoon-should-let-you-play-more-than-two-maps ) on this subject recently . 
  he was pretty critical of time-restricted content . 
  i 'm still undecided . 
  on paper i 'd totally agree that i should get all the stuff i 've paid for , but in practice it feels like i 've bought a ticket on a hype rollercoaster , where i can share the experience with everyone else who 's riding . 
  it 's a more dynamic social experience , which i think is what nintendo were going for . 
  i never knew how much i needed to hear the splatoon theme on accordion . 
  i removed this - we do n't allow links to leaks here . 
   the creator of this image made it private . 
  welp . 
  [ brother my ... journals the of author the . 
  ] ( #spoiler ), 
  callie 's doritos vs. marie 's mountain dew !, 
  ... i think i would have to sit out for that one . 
  i did some snooping , and it looks like this was marking the location of a post-e3 press event . 
  the specific location was n't revealed because it 's a private event . 
  shoreditch is fun to walk around , it could make a fun day out to find this mural . 
  they were n't around in the japan splatfest . 
  i think the details are just for world-building purposes . 
  no , this is a different tune . 
  in level 10 of octo valley there 's a spot on one of the rails where you can hear a short , looping tune that is n't heard anywhere else in the game . 
  [ you 're too slow . 
  :( ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/splatoon/comments/3bnj1d/live_band_cover_of_splattack/ ), 
  i 'd recommend reading up on [ what all the coded messages mean ] ( http://gravityfalls.wikia.com/wiki/list_of_cryptograms ) . 
  the story gets deeper when you realise there 's more to gravity falls than meets the eye . 
  this mode is a lot of fun . 
  maybe i 'm just saying that because i won pretty much all my matches ( up to a - now , woo ! ) . 
  my weapon of choice is the custom splattershot jr. 
  it 's not my type usually , but the disruptor is * killer * on this mode . 
  enemies tend to bunch up on or near the tower , and it 's so easy to hit multiple targets with a single throw . 
  they 're also good at neutering dynamo rollers , which can destroy your whole team if left unchecked . 
  [ message the moderators directly ] ( https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2fsplatoon ) to contact them . 
  that said , i 'm not a moderator but i did make the squid/inkling flairs here . 
  they 're all from [ official promotional art ] ( http://www.pidgi.net/wiki/category:splatoon ) , which only comes in six colours . 
  even if your absolute favourite ink colour is n't there , surely there 's one that 's close enough ? 
  also there are 22 unique ink colours in the normal game ( plus more in splatfests ) , so that would be a lot of flairs . 
  if you want a change made to the subreddit , [ message the moderators directly ] ( https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2fsplatoon ) . 
  there 's no point just throwing your idea out randomly . 
  i ca n't believe anyone is taking this seriously . 
  reddit drama is always so childish and petulant that it always just comes off as parody . 
  the drama is dumb , redditors are dumb and people are making a big fuss out of nothing because that 's what people like to do . 
  that 's the / r/inglin spirit !, 
  honestly , i think all the doomsday soothsaying is blown way out of proportion . 
  there 's no evil conspiracy at the top , there 's no push to censor reddit 's content to appeal to advertisers , and victoria could have been fired for a good reason . 
  there are things worth complaining about ( the admins are n't very communicative , reddit 's moderation tools suck ) , but they 're things that only affect the mods of large subreddits , and are certainly no catalyst for everyone to jump ship . 
  drama waves come and they go . 
  in a few days , you can count on this all being forgotten .
