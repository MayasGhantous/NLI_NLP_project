  we 're back now !, 
  i was waiting for the other gf mods to write back before reinstating the sub ( because i did n't want it down either ) , but i got bored of waiting . 
  there 's always [ / v/gravityfalls ] ( http://voat.co/v/gravityfalls ) if you 're into that . 
  voat.co is a reddit clone that many people have threatened to switch to ( and some already have ) if something happens to reddit that makes it unusable . 
  / v/gravityfalls is the name of the gf community there . 
  afaik the site is run by just two guys , so whenever there 's a dramawave here they get swamped with traffic and the site goes down , which is probably why you ca n't open it . 
  yeah , i always appreciate having smaller subs to take cover in when some nonsense is going down in / r/all . 
  i got a bit annoyed when i saw / r/gravityfalls made private , because to me it 's always been a welcoming shelter from the noise out there . 
  i do n't want this place to get involved with anything , we just do our own thing . 
  it feels kinda bad having this stickied to the top because it only perpetuates more drama talk , but people want answers and it 's the easiest way to make sure everyone gets them . 
  i noticed this too !, 
  it could very well be the case . 
  yep , i do n't believe in it either . 
  people flocked to it because there were no rules , but the guys running it [ have discovered what happens ] ( http://redd.it/3aetx7 ) if you let people post anything and everything . 
  uh , have you forgotten previous drama waves ? 
  most of it blows over within 24 hours , and a few days later it 's all but forgotten and we 're back to business as usual . 
  it 's actually harder to fall down , because you go up when you hit 100 , but you do n't fall down when you hit 0 , so you get one last chance to redeem yourself . 
  all the jp players can only play splatfest right now , so they 'll be back when the event is over . 
  because rest is the name of the move in the actual pok\u00e9mon games . 
  i 'm fully aware . 
  we 've never had anything to do with victoria , and we 've had very few occasions when communication with the reddit admins was necessary , so any huge protest from us would n't be too relevant . 
  all our amas were organised directly . 
  / u/paradox295 confirmed for author of the journals . 
  not gon na lie , i have no idea who actually created this subreddit . 
  it may as well have been a secret society . 
  no , they 're thinking of http://themysteryofgravityfalls.com/stream/, 
  because of this , i added a little message to the top of this sub that shows up when you 're not subscribed , warning people that this is a spoiler zone if you 're not caught up with the episodes . 
  not much we can do about other subs though . 
  i 'm from the uk , so during most of the day here i 'm the only mod on duty . 
  i waited for several hours to hear back about re-opening the sub before i went ahead and did it anyway . 
  if you want a better one here , go and make one !, 
  css is n't hard . 
  those are some very high reblog targets you 've set , especially for a brand new blog ... 
  it 's fixed now , thanks for finding this !, 
  thanks for pointing it out , turns out the code for that was a real mess . 
  ( i must have been very tired when i wrote it ... ), 
  should be all better now !, 
  i made it bold , if that helps ? 
  and / r/zeroescape goes wild !, 
  whoever it was deleted their account , which is why it 's such a mystery . 
  i thought the method of lip sync was really smart , and it 's the best way they could have done it without breaking the art style . 
  i 'm overall really impressed by the art direction here , i think they did a great job . 
  agh , i always forget to check the dark theme !, 
  that should be fixed now . 
  i tried making the text bigger , but it starts to look really ugly . 
  i 'll see if i can find an elegant solution . 
  wander over yonder is another disney xd cartoon , and it 's ace . 
  it 's a super crazy nostalgia trip through the way cartoons used to be . 
  [ i tried ... ] ( https://miiverse.nintendo.net/posts/ayqhaaabaaaevhhmf1crbg ), 
  reddit does n't natively support multiple themes , so we have to use a weird css hack to implement it . 
  that 's why we have to use the clunky `` bc '' thing . 
  that makes it ~ ~ 1 win to callie , 2 wins to marie ~ ~ . 
  i wonder if best girl will be able to pull it back when the eu one ends in 8 hours ? 
  ** edit : ** it 's actually 2-1 to callie , derp . 
  alex posted a video - i guess / u/tweetposter has n't worked out how to deal with those yet . 
  the latest jp one : [ red kitsune udon vs. green tanuki soba ] ( http://nintendoeverything.com/wp-content/uploads/splatoon-second-splatfest-jp.jpg ) . 
  ( green won . ), 
  the august update will introduce custom game rules , so 2v2 will probably be an actual hing . 
  why ? 
  [ dog won . 
  i 've been getting a lot of fights against team rock too . 
  it would be interesting to hear from someone on pop to find out if they 're dealing with the same problem . 
  yes , with diminishing returns . 
  the download is 1.8 gb , and it includes most of the upcoming update content . 
  i have the trio , and i really like them . 
  i thought i got my money 's worth in content , but those who do n't have them are n't missing out or at a disadvantage . 
  the alternate-weapons missions are overall pretty fun , although the squid 's are a mixed bag . 
  the limited ink challenges are very hard , while the kraken challenges are super easy . 
  it 's hard to feel challenged when you can just press zl to go invincible . 
  sounds like you 're looking for a combo of / r/thesaltysplatoon and / r/splatoonmeta . 
   i did n't mind because i knew i would never use all 18, 
  call yourself a completionist ? 
  i thought part of the 100 % quest would be upgrading all the gear to have three slots ( which , i remember reading , costs over 6 million coins ... ), 
  agh , you 're right . 
  i do n't know how i made that mistake , i checked the wikis too . 
  a lot of team rock members have been complaining that they have to face other team rocks because there are n't enough pop teams around . 
  are you guys having issues finding rocks to play against , or is it only on our side ? 
  asking people to draw `` adult '' - themed content on miiverse could only end in disaster . 
  we wo n't know for another hour or so ... 
  removed for off-topic . 
  where did the bohemian scene move to ? 
  camden today feels almost like any other high street . 
  they 've all lasted for 24 hours , so it 's very unlikely that that will change . 
  and red kitsune flavour noodles !, 
  amiibo tap is free from the eshop ... ( although whether it 's worth downloading is another matter . ), 
  ca n't we just use [ the squidboards system ] ( http://squidboards.com/guides/ ) ? 
  callie won 3 splatfests , marie won 1 . 
  the numbers speak for themselves . 
  post removed , read da rules :, 
   do not post links to leaked content from upcoming episodes . 
  disney have asked us to remove any such links . 
  i 'm a callie guy too , but [ let 's be real here ] ( http://i.imgur.com/gzlsny4.jpg ) . 
  i did n't take it , i found it on miiverse !, 
  honest !, 
  this is all almost certainly future update content ( and it was posted here already ) . 
  i do n't know why the website thinks this is all stuff that was removed . 
  eu is code for nintendo 's `` europe '' region , which includes all of europe plus australia and new zealand . 
  you get more for having a higher score , and an extra 6 for being on the winning team . 
  i guess the admins really like to reddit at work . 
  not so different from us after all ?
