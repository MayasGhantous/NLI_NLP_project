  not just if they 're standing in your ink - if they have any of your ink on them . 
  so if you shoot them a bit and they get away , you can still keep track of them for a few seconds . 
  and palutena ... 
  i was totally going to get her until i saw her derpy face . 
  i banned them from the subreddit for their behaviour here . 
  that 's just unacceptable . 
  i 'm sad to say this is one of the less stupid splatoon suggestions i 've seen . 
  this is the best splatoon video ever made and nothing will ever beat it . 
  i appreciate the work you put into this , but the last thing i want to see is yet another / r/naut subreddit . 
  there 's just so many now . 
  i 'm gon na try working on something of my own . 
  i removed this because it 's totally irrelevant . 
  it 's not explained outright , but the implication is climate change . 
  i added a message to the top of the sub that shows up to people who are n't subscribed letting them know to be wary of spoilers . 
  but on / r/gravityfalls , every day is theory thursday ... 
  i 'd like to think you put the same amount of effort into decoding the message . 
  i swap out the message hidden there every now and then , so it 's worth keeping an eye on ... 
  alright , i 've got to work in / r/hazzat . 
  still a * lot * to do , but this is fun to work on ( and i 'll take feedback ) . 
  hover over ` porter robinson ' at the top for fun !,

  it 's weird , before this kicked off i 'd only heard negative things about victoria from commenters . 
  she was the `` worst thing to happen to amas '' and `` single-handedly ruined iama '' , and people claimed that they would skip the ama entirely if she was involved . 
  something about dumbing down answers or whatever . 
  pretty much / r/whoreddithatesnow . 
  i think the implication was that she was censoring amas by cherry-picking safe questions for the participants , and doing other secret stuff too . 
  there was no evidence for it , but the same goes for all this outrage . 
  i 'm not saying she did , i 'm saying the perpetual outrage machine accused her of it , and now it 's funny that she 's the hero . 
  where the hate cannon is aimed just seems to change with the flow of the tide . 
  [ this is already happening . 
  ] ( http://roadsandkingdoms.com/2015/the-lonely-end/ ) the stories of these people effectively committing suicide by self-neglect are chilling . 
  holy crap , this works so well . 
  gf episodes have never aired simultaneously across the world . 
  the new episodes premiere a few weeks later in the uk . 
  yeah , i 'm not sold on the patterned background either so i 'll definitely be trying other stuff to see what works . 
  glad you like it so far though !, 
  they finally caught up !, 
  i think i need to make a few tumblr posts do get some of those guys to come over here ... 
  we need to mount a force on the #gravity falls tag on tumblr and let them know that while tumblr has its merits , this is * the * place to come for gravity falls discussion . 
  i made a tumblr account and have promoted the sub a bit , but i ca n't do it alone !, 
  ask / u/scarlet _ j who runs the site . 
  it really bugs me that his book is backwards . 
  the pages are on the left and the spine is on the right . 
  is the journal actually a manga comic ? 
  res is n't great at handling tumblr posts . 
  ubisoft montpellier , not montreal . 
  ( crazy french names ... ), 
  booyah base 's theme goes with everything . 
  ok sure why not, 
  okay , this is happening !, 
  use the little   arrow to collapse it and see him in his full glory . 
  i moved the whole thing over a bit so you can see him a bit better . 
  [ ross coined the phrase ] ( https://youtu.be/asvog03hyly?t=136 ) , i do n't know why sips gets all the credit . 
  the part that takes up the most css space on the subs i run is code for emotes , which are also pretty awkward for users to use with the clunky ` [ ] ( #emotename ) ` system . 
  it would be cool to have them supported natively . 
  it wo n't be here forever . 
   the no-spoilers policies are very weakly enforced here . 
  the spoiler policy is that you only have to tag them for 24 hours after a new episode . 
  we also have [ a spoiler warning ] ( http://i.imgur.com/n5jzkmv.png ) at the top that displays to people who are n't subscribed . 
  i think that 's pretty fair ... 
  no , the [ tom with the million-dollar beard ] ( http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/yogscast/images/9/9c/tom.jpg ) . 
  ( it is literally worth a million dollars because they shaved it off in the 2013 livestream when the million-dollar target was reached . ), 
  this is pretty much finished !, 
  i 'm sure i 'll be tweaking it here and there , but it 's basically done . 
  this is the most work i 've put into a subreddit theme , so i hope you like it ... 
  ** edit : ** [ here are all the images i used . 
  ] ( https://www.dropbox.com/s/qph8b6rx0rrvv16/porterimages.zip?dl=0 ), 
  buddy , you need to get some [ reddit enhancement suite ] ( http://redditenhancementsuite.com/ ) . 
  killer sea snail \u2260 sea snail killer . 
  oh yes . 
  i really love how the n-zap plays , but the splat bomb and echolocator are n't strong enough to match its offensive capabilities . 
  this is bad , but it 's not as bad as [ the papers please livestream ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfk_f2jwp9y ) . 
  the developer is ubisoft osaka . 
  i like this - it 's less divisive , so the losing team wo n't feel as bad ( unless they 're * really * passionate about water slides ) . 
  that 's not how you splatfest . 
  it 's not fun unless you 're fighting for what you believe in . 
  good !, 
  now go forth and fight !, 
  either that , or it 's an [ nfpa diamond ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nfpa_704 ) , which can often be seen labelling hazardous materials . 
   neh , i 'm sure that 's not it . 
  let me rephrase : it is * definitely * an nfpa diamond , which can often be seen labelling hazardous materials . 
  i think you should watch [ the treehouse video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=2930&amp;v=qxycg1qn5dy#t=47m55s ) again , because there are plenty of spots on the flat areas to snipe from , and the ramps are pretty much without cover . 
  chargers will be just fine . 
  wow , these are cool !, 
  they remind me of the [ hype shirts ] ( http://assets2.routeone.co.uk/media/productimages/x/00/10/001009260.jpg ) that have been doing the rounds lately . 
  i think black looks the coolest , but i 'm aware that i probably would n't be able to wear it for a few months until this crazy british weather calms down ... 
  [ sources point to yes . 
  be nice . 
  yep , you have to beat the third boss . 
  i 'd have to disagree , although this is quite a pointless post . 
  just do n't be mean . 
  [ remember the human ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/1ytp7q/remember_the_human/ ) . 
  people are entitled to an opinion , but that opinion is worthless if they have n't given what they 're talking about a chance . 
  in gravity falls , nothing is safe . 
  trust no one . 
  also the vocalists sound pretty different for the two songs , so i would guess cash money is not by little big dog . 
   are the `` progressive '' changes promised to the mods actually going to occur ? 
  / r/modsupport now exists , and changes are already being made based on suggestions from there , so ...
