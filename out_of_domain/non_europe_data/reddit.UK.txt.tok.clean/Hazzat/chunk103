  i 'm feeling confident . 
  i 'd say go through the [ list of decoded cryptograms ] ( http://gravityfalls.wikia.com/wiki/list_of_cryptograms ) to discover all the secret messages you might have missed . 
  i followed that page as i went along and things made a lot more sense ... 
  you might want to read the amas listed under ` useful links ' in the sidebar too , you could learn something from them !, 
  ^ ( it 's not legit ), 
  just for you ... 
  go team eating !, 
  we 'll ambush team sleeping and they 'll never see it coming !, 
  william 's room in civ is a mix of several vermeer paintings . 
  the floor is like that of [ the love letter ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4b/vermeer,_johannes_-_the_loveletter.jpg ) , the windows are from [ officer and laughing girl ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2e/johannes_vermeer_-_de_soldaat_en_het_lachende_meisje_-_google_art_project.jpg ) , the globe is from [ the astronomer ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0e/johannes_vermeer_-_the_astronomer_-_wga24685.jpg ) . 
  [ the author of the journals ... my brother . 
  ] ( #spoiler ), 
  i think the textures could be alright if you tidied them up a bit . 
  the tiling is very obvious in some places ( like on the left-hand side of the wall closest to us ) and the ends of the walls have a lot going on . 
  other than this , this is a really cool piece !, 
  you can check by going to the voting booth in the plaza . 
  it has the date/time written along the top . 
  do you work for the squid research lab ? 
  the alternative to sea snails is to just earn 30k coins . 
  if we could just keep unlocking snails , in-game money would be pretty much useless . 
  no , because reddit does n't support iframes or anything fancy like that . 
  / r/splatoon, 
  oh , it 's only [ the most grandma-y page on facebook ] ( https://www.facebook.com/shutupimstilltalking ) . 
  i swear my gravestone will have `` splatted by kelp splatterscope ! '', 
  written on it because the goddamn chargers on this map make me want to kill myself aaaaagghhhhhh, 
  the inkzooka is only powerful from certain spots - mainly good vantage points that are n't too far from the target . 
  for that reason , it 's the least versatile special , compared to the others which can either be used from anywhere ( inkstrike , killer wail ) , or allow you to charge straight into the enemy lines ( bubbler , kraken ) . 
  i think it 's well-balanced . 
  it 's up to the community . 
  some shows have incredible staying power after they end ( / r/lost still gets posts every day ) , so we 'll just have to see . 
  [ when alex was asked about this ] ( https://youtu.be/jzrr1qex6nm?t=71 ) , he held up the world 's most distracting object , signifying that the answer would be a spoiler . 
  we 'll have to wait and see if anything comes of this mystery ... 
   inkzookas are clearly more useful than bomb rushes ... 
  go crazy with a bomb rush and you can completely change the flow of battle by pushing the enemy out of a hotly contested area . 
  it 's more versatile than the inkzooka too , because it does n't matter whether you use it from on the ground or above . 
  if you ca n't choose a favourite between rollercoasters/water slides , choose between callie & marie , or just choose your favourite colour . 
  or flip a coin . 
  that final hit comes * really * fast . 
  seriously , you have less than a second to hit it so you need to have that shot charged and ready for the moment he smacks the speaker at you . 
  [ like this . 
  protip for the future : if you want a change made to the subreddit , please just [ message the moderators ] ( https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2fgravityfalls ) . 
  it 's much more efficient than just making a post and hoping we see it !, 
  that 's a squiffer , not a sploosh-o . 
  [ this guy is real . 
  they want squid jump ported to ios/android . 
  [ here 's your countdown ] ( http://itsalmo.st/#ataleoftwostans_qmz2s ) , and [ here 's the wolfram alpha version ] ( http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=8%3a30pm+edt%2c+july+13th+2015 ) , which has both a countdown and a timezone converter . 
  [ the mystery of gravity falls ] ( http://themysteryofgravityfalls.tumblr.com/post/123825825505/a-tale-of-two-stans-live-stream-information-its ) tumblr has all the details . 
  i like to just [ hang out with the jellyfish ] ( http://i.imgur.com/t7x4jwi.jpg ) . 
  they 're always so chill . 
  watch out , she bites !, 
  enemy chargers , moray towers . 
  say no more . 
  we do n't know . 
  it will probably be in a few weeks/months . 
  her name is ` chloe lmao ' , and she 's a vine user . 
  [ here 's the original vine ] ( https://vine.co/v/e1vzmftdoda ) , which has spawned a lot of parodies . 
  you know , i ca n't even remember why i picked this flair . 
  it was something to do with my sub / r/brogres . 
  yeah there is , the ` nsfw ' button has been repurposed to be a spoiler marker . 
  mark it nsfw and it will show up as a spoiler . 
  reddit does n't have actual spoiler tags , so the people who run spoiler-sensitive subreddits just have to make do . 
  repurposing the nsfw tag is a pretty common way to handle spoilers . 
  that was a question i 'd pondered my whole life , so i was glad to see it addressed in the shrek series . 
  you could just watch it online like a lot of us . 
  ( also we need all the subscribers we can get if we want to overtake / r/stevenuniverse ! ), 
  pssh , it 's 2015 . who * does n't * use their internet alias for their real name nowadays ? 
   that is the only other appearance of a llama in the show aside from one of mabel 's sweaters . 
  ... which mabel gives to pacifica . 
  that 's what set people on the ` pacifica = llama ' train of thought to begin with . 
  dude , this is amazing . 
  it celebrates everything that 's great about the original while adding something new and magical . 
  i love it . 
  [ i made a post ] ( http://redd.it/3ccnel ) a few days ago explaining how stuff will work on the subreddit on episode day , although we had to un-sticky it in favour of sdcc information . 
  it 's stuff worth knowing if you plan on hanging around here ( which you totally should be planning on ) . 
  you could [ send it to his tumblr ... ] ( http://importerrobinson.tumblr.com/submit ) i do n't know how else to contact him though . 
  that 's what the big protests and blackouts the other week were about !, 
  things are changing though , / r/modsupport was founded recently and is a medium for moderators to voice their concerns , wants and suggestions . 
  this one has repurposed the nsfw tag to mark spoilers . 
  i do n't get what you 're trying to argue about ? 
  yes they 're largely the same , but with different colours and miiverse posts . 
  it airs way way later outside the us . 
  i 'm in the uk and i have no freakin ' idea when new episodes air here , because it 's so long after the us premiere . 
  i do n't understand what you mean . 
  what would an * actual * spoiler tag be ? 
  he totally is !, 
  well such a thing does n't exist right now , so i do n't know why / u/spazicle is demanding it . 
  apparently the admin to-do list from moderator requests is over 20 pages long and there 's only two people working to fulfil them ... 
  so we may see proper spoiler tags one day , but it 'll be a while . 
  it 's is a stop on a family road trip down the california coast , so we wo n't have time to do much besides get nostalgic and revisit the places we went to before , but i 'm excited nonetheless . 
  sb has a very special place in my heart . 
  in his ama , he said his dream would be to work with kanye west . 
  i 'd like to see that dream come true , just to see what crazy thing comes out the other end . 
  both `` soos ' '' and `` soos 's '' are correct !, 
  send your thanks to / u/gravityfallscipher - the dude is running four livestreams at once right now , just for us !, 
  ` look ahead ' had clips from several upcoming episodes , not just atots . 
  cartoons do n't really get scenes deleted after they 've been fully animated - any cutting like that gets done at the storyboarding phase . 
  `` bill cipher !, 
  triangle ! '', 
  the bow tie . 
  he normally has a bit of string tied in a bow .
