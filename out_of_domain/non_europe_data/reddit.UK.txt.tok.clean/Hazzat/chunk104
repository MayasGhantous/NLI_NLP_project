  it says this on the subreddit 's submit page before you make a post :, 
   ** trying to contact the * gravity falls * team ? 
   this is n't the place to do it !, 
  alex and friends do n't read this subreddit ( or if they do , they keep very quiet about it ) . 
  this is just a place to share stuff with other gravity falls fans . 
  confession : i actually am , but you were so much of a diappointment that i abandoned you . 
  i 'll look into it , but i 'm currently on holiday and a few thousand miles from my computer so it may be a while before i can give it a go . 
  it was by one of the storyboard artists : http://arythusa.tumblr.com/post/123587343782/its-coming-this-monday-july-13th-a-tale-of, 
  a lot of stuff like this gets posted on the official tumblr blog , [ gravi-team falls ] ( http://gravi-teamfalls.tumblr.com ) . 
  the scripts are written way , way in advance , and the overarching story would have been completed before work on the show even began in earnest . 
  any correct theories came about because we were given just enough foreshadowing to put the pieces together . 
  i thought i 'd break in the new guys with an easy code to start with . 
  [ ] ( #pacifiwhat ) now mcgucket 's cry of `` bill cipher !, 
  triangle ! '', 
  has whole new implications . 
  this is the prediction thread we had just before the episode : http://redd.it/3d50r0, 
  you 're too slow , [ the bot beat you to it ] ( http://redd.it/3ddu9i ) . 
  it does not give you rashes !, 
  every day , reddit features a few subreddits on the front page that have experienced more traffic than usual in the past 24 hours . 
  thanks to all the visitors after atots yesterday , [ we made today 's trending list ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/trendingsubreddits/comments/3dctfz/trending_subreddits_for_20150715_rmagic/ ) !, 
  the next one is in about 3 weeks . 
  we always list the next episode date in the sidebar . 
  i recently worked out how to hide the comment reply box on the bill cipher ama , but they still find ways to send him questions . 
  i think we 'll be stuck with this forever . 
  most of the questions still coming in for bill ( there are several every day ) are from brand new accounts . 
  they 're excited kids who just signed up for reddit and do n't know how it works . 
  it 's dangerous ( and slow ) to crack codes alone , [ take this ] ( http://themysteryofgravityfalls.com/ ) . 
  removed for not being gf-related . 
  the first hints for the codes were hidden at the end of the intro sequence . 
  when the title comes up , you can hear a faint whisper which , when played backwards , gives a clue about what cipher is being used . 
  in the first episodes it says `` three letters back '' , which meant we had to use the caeser cipher and move each letter back by three . 
  i 've seen all six seasons of lost . 
  the pain of having mysteries unresolved is real . 
  thank you alex for taking care to tie up the loose threads . 
  we got the answers in a kind of roundabout way , through interviews and bonus clips after the fact . 
  there was still a fair amount left up to interpretation , which i 'm not against , but the finale really was a giant question mark . 
  you misquoted !, 
  it 's actually :, 
   when gravity falls , and earth becomes sky , fear the being with just one eye . 
  i like the design though . 
  you can already buy splatoon-branded water guns . 
  i 've seen them next to the amiibo . 
  it 's world emoji day , celebrated on this date because july 17 is written on the calendar emoji :, 
  those characters are meant to be emoji , but your browser does n't support them . 
  you can learn more in / r/stevenuniverse . 
  a lot of browsers do n't support emoji properly , so they will just show up as boxes . 
  there are extensions like [ chromoji ] ( https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chromoji-hangouts-edition/fgaiicnhcohdgegabomljlkheilficfd ) that can allow you to see them properly . 
  oh , it 's only on apple 's calendar emoji . 
  other companies gave it different designs . 
  team red tanuki in the last jp splatfest actually played with magenta ink - there 's still no red ink , even in splatfests . 
  removed . 
  i 'm flattered !, 
  removed this for not being gf related . 
  no it 's not - removed . 
  removed . 
  this ai n't cool . 
  sorry to tell you this is n't a massive discovery - we 've known this since pretty much s2e2 !, 
  people even guessed that ford was on there before he 'd been revealed , like [ in this piece-together ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mrjkiya.jpg ) . 
  nice theorising though !, 
  watch it in order , watch it on [ this site ] ( http://nvision.io/gravityfalls/ ) , and follow [ this list ] ( http://gravityfalls.wikia.com/wiki/list_of_cryptograms ) as you go to discover all the secrets and foreshadowing . 
  now scram until you 're all caught up !, 
  would n't want to get anything spoiled ... 
  the goat 's name is gompers . 
  [ here is its wiki page ] ( http://gravityfalls.wikia.com/wiki/gompers ) , including documentation of its every appearance . 
  / r/vaporwaveaesthetics, 
  it 's okay to check the [ list of cryptograms ] ( http://gravityfalls.wikia.com/wiki/list_of_cryptograms ) - just do n't scroll down any further than the latest episode you 've seen !, 
  [ nice report . 
  the image was lifted straight from porterrobinson.com , so it was the biggest one i could get !, 
  glad you like it !, 
  the random image was done using [ this method ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/csshelp/wiki/snippets#wiki_random_image_above_sidebar ) . 
  it 's a weird hack , but it 's just one of those reddit css quirks . 
  for the glitchy logo , i took the glitchy gif from the top of porterrobinson.com , chopped it up in photoshop and followed [ my own tutorial ] ( http://redd.it/2i7w0d ) ( specifically steps 4 and 5 ) to make it work as a css animation . 
  it took ages . 
  the colour scheme is also lifted largely from porterrobinson.com . 
  i did try something more worlds-y as others have suggested , but damn that soft sky blue is an awkward colour to put on a webpage . 
  i 'm still a newbie in this world of design and colour !, 
  i think this statistic shows that long-ass hiatuses ( unfortunately ) do more to help the show than hinder it ... 
  i let the admins know via / r/spam , they cleaned it up . 
  for goodness sake you ca n't post gay porn on this subreddit, 
  when was the last time we saw shibata in a direct ? 
  seems like it 's been ages . 
  memes are n't created when someone says `` hey , i have a great idea for a meme ! '', 
  it just happens organically . 
  the reason memes have taken over is because no one posts much else . 
  start posting theories here to restore the balance !, 
  the movie is n't out in the uk until tomorrow , but that seems very unlikely . 
  that would involve huge parts of the film to be re-made , and we know what hockey is . 
  this gag was reworked because it 's a quick joke , so instant recognition matters . 
  `` dad loves football '' is more instantly recognisable than `` dads love hockey '' , and it 's the sort of thing that gets brought up in preview screenings . 
  they 're made to look super gross in the shot where the pizza is presented , so the joke makes sense and the laugh happens . 
  do n't question the logic too much . 
  i got to visit pixar earlier this week , and they mentioned this change . 
  it was a result of the preview screenings : the audience stayed silent at the broccoli joke , but found the peppers funny . 
  if you want a change made to the subreddit , [ message the moderators ] ( https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2fsplatoon ) . 
  if you want a change made to the subreddit * quickly * , do the hard work for them ( as in , make a sprite sheet of the new flairs you want ) . 
  making posts like this does n't achieve anything .
