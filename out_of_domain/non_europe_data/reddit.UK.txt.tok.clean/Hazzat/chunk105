  i 'd imagine they showed the hockey version , then showed the football version and saw which got the best reaction . 
  i 'm not saying changing it was the right thing to do , but it was n't just random or arbitrary . 
  do n't forget there 's / r/starvstheforcesofevil !, 
  any chance the flair selection box could be made a bit wider ? 
  with so many flairs now , it 's tricky to sort through them when they 're all in just one column . 
  [ message the moderators ] ( https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2fsplatoon ) about this stuff , it 's more effective than making a post . 
  excellent , thanks !, 
  [ here 's pics of all the new clothes ] ( http://squidboards.com/threads/unreleased-gear-datamining.2729/ ) - they were datamined a while ago !, 
  i got to see her perform this live once , it was awesome . 
  it 's a little sad that she 's just known for her song being a meme , because she 's an amazing experimental musician . 
  please do n't . 
  you were kind of a jerk over there with your `` deal with it '' attitude . 
  you should probably apologise . 
  we like to pretend this stuff does n't exist . 
  i would choose team milk tea just for this . 
  he 's the greatest villain of them all . 
  where in the article did it say they might be removed ? 
  he just said he 'd investigate them , which makes it sound like he 's just going to ask around to find out who put them there . 
  also the developers have used words like `` investigate '' and `` research '' a lot in past interviews because they all claim to be part of the squid research lab . 
  paging / u/makmark , there 's someone on the line here for you . 
  i find this relatable . 
  whenever i 'm top of my team i cry `` wahaha , i ` ma number one ! '', 
  no one seems to mind . 
  after all , i 'm a squid now . 
  yep , this is why its sprite is always the generic grey tee . 
  the mentions in the scrolls about the hedonistic attitude of inkling society ( they use huge amounts of lights for splatfests even during a power crisis etc. ), 
  makes me think the inkling world is on course for self-destruction . 
  the octarians are more sensible , but if they 'd won the great turf war we would n't have this cool game to play . 
  / r/spongebros - uh , / r/thesaltysplatoon - no ... 
  i had the opportunity to go to hard , said no , and realised porter was playing later . 
  i like the little touch of having a construction worker bowing to apologise for the inconvenience . 
  construction sites in japan often have [ signs that show the same thing ] ( http://photos.travellerspoint.com/236225/img_3849.jpg ) . 
  hooray , thanks everyone !, 
  i will be tweaking the design more before implementing it , so get your suggestions/requests in now . 
  you 'll notice i removed the comment box and reply buttons there to try to curb the number of questions submitted . 
  it has n't worked . 
  there 's nothing i can do , the funposting is too strong !, 
  do n't give them attention . 
  i 'm planning on recruiting some new mods soon to curb all this . 
  now we 're a big boy sub with 25k subscribers , this small mod team ca n't quite keep up ... 
  i 'll be making a stickied post about it soon . 
  i 'm currently traveling on holiday so it may be a little while before i can put this plan into action !, 
  developers revealed in an interview that matchmaking is based on play style : players who like to cover ground are put in the same lobbies , and players that like to get splats are put in the same lobbies . 
  it 's a funny way of doing it , but this is a funny game . 
  it was more than just the spamming of their butt blog , they also tried organising a raid on behalf of / r/testreddit1919 . 
  we do n't appreciate either of those things . 
  this gag is not new . 
  [ here 's the earliest example i can find ] ( http://youtu.be/azbb1astrbs ) , but it predates even that . 
  that should have been his 2012 campaign slogan . 
  reading the names is something to do to pass the time while waiting in lobbies , if nothing else . 
  stuff like that is gon na have to wait until we can get new mods recruited , we 're already feeling the strain with all the stuff to do around here ... 
  the inklings around the tower are people you played with recently , which is why they do n't have miiverse messages . 
  private battles wo n't earn you points/cash , but you can still make a team with your friends , face random opponents and receive rewards that way . 
  yellow + pink/magenta = pink lemonade . 
  mmm . 
  they work at a tv station , maybe all your battles are televised and they colour-code to match ? 
  because you 're special < 3, 
  i removed this . 
  did n't i already ask you to stop feeding the trolls ? 
  please stop giving these guys attention . 
  just ignore them . 
  regarding this `` war '' thing , could you ... not ? 
  it 's dumb , off-topic and i 'm gon na be removing everything related to it . 
  regarding this `` war '' thing , could you ... not ? 
  it 's dumb , off-topic and i 'm gon na be removing everything related to it . 
  stop it . 
  i told ag616 in the `` you are unbanned '' message i sent . 
  it 's a good motto for everyone to follow though . 
  the only person you 're pissing off by doing this is me , 'cause i 'm gon na have to clean it up . 
  i 'm on holiday right now and do n't want to have to be checking the sub every 5 minutes . 
  if you * have * to do this , could you at least wait until i 'm back from my holiday ? 
  august 5, 
  post removed . 
  please stop posting about that sub , it 's off-topic and not funny . 
  no , but i might add post flairs to the sub so people can filter out memes and stuff if they do n't want to see it . 
  . . ask me when i get back . 
  no , i removed it which means it does n't show up on the subreddit list anymore . 
  if people actually try that , i will totally ban them all and remove all the posts . 
  would you stop posting about the `` war '' ? 
  i 'm just removing everything related to it . 
  believe me , i am . 
  why would you post this on / r/gravityfalls ? 
  [ squidboards ] ( http://squidboards.com/ ) is the best place to find people to play with !, 
  yep , it was actually alex possessed by bill . 
  read all you want into the foreshadowing ... 
  out of interest , how did you find the ama ? 
  is it linked somewhere prominent ? 
  people are still asking bill questions every day even though it ended months and months ago . 
  absolutely do this . 
  you 're only getting half the story if you do n't know what all the coded messages mean !, 
  hi , i 'm in charge of that sort of thing . 
  i 'm a big fan of keeping things simple , reducing clutter , not making things any messier than they need to be . 
  i like the current flairs because i think they 're simple enough to not be distracting , while still letting you reflect some of your personality . 
  [ they made a correction ] ( https://www.facebook.com/splatoonen/posts/1484258838534391 ) - it was the wrong image that they posted , and it will be the inkbrush nouveau . 
  [ they messed up the pictures . 
  ] ( https://www.facebook.com/splatoonen/posts/1484258838534391 ), 
  yep , i fall into this category . 
  i change depending on my outfit . 
  got ta stay fresh !,
