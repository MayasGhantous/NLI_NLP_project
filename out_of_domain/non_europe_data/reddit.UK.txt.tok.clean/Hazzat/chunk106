  that said , alex rarely reveals spoilery information at cons . 
  can someone resize this to 300px wide so i can put it in the sidebar ? 
  thanks , 
  no , not at all . 
  it 's bright green vs. magenta , which is a colour pair you 're probably already familiar with . 
  i do n't actually know all of pinkie 's abilities , but i know she approves a lot of posts that would otherwise be mistakenly caught in reddit 's auto-spam filter . 
  ( including this one ... ), 
  yes they do . 
  the reasons will probably be to do with polar bears and penguins . 
  i believe it 's called `` seabagging '' . 
  i fell in love with metabolist architecture a while ago - the idea that buildings and cities should be able to easily move and reshape depending on the needs of the people who live there is such an awesome idea . 
  what i would give to live in a city that looked like this tower . 
  i love it , thank you for sharing . 
  it 's ink all the way down . 
  if everyone has good luck ... 
  surely that means no one has good luck ? 
  when the new mods are appointed , we 'll have a proper conversation about how to deal with these `` joke of the week '' trends that flood the subreddit . 
  i 'm the only mod actively regularly checking this place ( everyone else is either understandably busy , or a robot ) so it 's hard to keep up with all the posts . 
  for now , just downvote stuff you think is n't relevant to the subreddit . 
  that 's what the downvote arrow is there for . 
  i do n't know , i did n't want to say without knowing how many applicants there would be . 
  53 people have applied so far ... 
  i was n't expecting that many . 
  got it !, 
  i 'm not entirely convinced this works , but it was worth it for the pun . 
  ooh , i do n't know if i prefer this one or the [ booyah base mashup ] ( http://youtu.be/zztfwvxl8vw ) . 
  inb4 he gets possessed again and bill comes back for ama around 2 . 
  i think you meant [ this music ] ( https://m.soundcloud.com/bradbreeck/gf-e111-fight-fighters-final ) . 
  yes !, 
  it 's 3-star , with quick respawn on it . 
  it 's on the to-do list . 
  moringmark is a popular gravity falls fan artist who produces a new piece almost every day . 
  posting his work here would guarantee at least 200 upvotes , so it became an unhealthy competition to get there first . 
  / u/moringmarkbot was developed to end that and get people to stop stressing out . 
  if you want to know more about mark himself , he had [ an ama ] ( http://redd.it/35fwdv ) recently . 
  real pretty !, 
  i think you should move he splatoon logo down a bit though , there 's a lot of empty space under it now . 
  new favourite band . 
  if this is on the friend list page , i will never leave it . 
  lazy susan works as a waitress , serving food . 
  lazy susans also serve food . 
  it was intentional . 
  [ you 're too slow ] ( http://redd.it/3ftvmv ), 
  i like this . 
  it 's going in the sidebar . 
  that 's some / r/miiverseinaction if ever i saw it . 
  [ not quite  ( https://www.reddit.com/r/gravityfalls/comments/3aj99f/im_matt_braly_storyboard_artist_and_director_on/csda6s1 ), 
   what was your fave scene w / wendy ? 
   wendy fighting wendy in bunker has got to be it . 
  also there 's an episode coming up where she is amazing as well . 
  application count is up to 75 now ... how am i gon na sort through all these ? 
  hey , be fair . 
  not everyone can read the clues as well as the master investigators around here . 
  yeah , in a less active subreddit , getting an early downvote on a post can be pretty much killer . 
  that may end up being the only vote the post ever receives , because there 's no one around to check the latest posts and it 's very unlikely that it will reach anyone 's front page to rescue it . 
  even a single serial downvoter could wreak havoc in a tiny community . 
  the actual anti-brigading algorithms are kept secret to stop people working around them , but there are mechanisms in place to stop stuff like that happening . 
  if it gets detected , the offending accounts are shadowbanned , which means ( among other things ) that none of their votes count . 
   notaromanian does literally nothing but create spam ! cmds and fuck up bets, 
  i guess that 's what happens if you give someone mod status for no reason other than they asked `` can i be a mod '' . 
  it helps some weapons more than others , but with all of them damage drops off the further the ink flies . 
  damage up helps to mitigate that . 
  it 's the same as a normal splattershot , and looks the same as the weapon you use in octo valley . 
  the squid amiibo unlocks it . 
  not in europe . 
  i suspect it was added because it 's the [ squid girl ] ( http://www.watchcartoononline.com/thumbs/squid-girl-episode-1-english-dubbed.jpg ) shade of blue . 
  it is absolutely amazing in person , and i totally got the sense of wonder walking the streets . 
  maybe i 'm in the wrong subreddit , because i think urban sprawls are beautiful . 
  also , male inklings have long tentacle hair too . 
  it 's just tied up in a top-knot . 
  = nice !, 
   how do i get out of rank c +, 
  higher ranks reward more money . 
  really ? 
  they basically mean the same thing in this context . 
  without knowing your play style , it 's impossible to give you any meaningful advice . 
  analyse your actions to work out what you 're doing wrong , watch good players to see what they 're doing right , put what you 've learned into practice . 
  get good . 
  no , you do n't get anything from private battles ( except happy memories ) . 
  chirpy chips * ( as in chiptunes ) . 
   and of course i do n't have any friends to actually make squads with : /, 
  there are plenty of people both here and [ on squidboards ] ( http://squidboards.com/forums/squid-locator.35/ ) who want to be your friend !, 
  uh , i think you misread . 
   ** trying to contact the gravity falls team ? 
   this *** is n't *** the place to do it !, 
  alex and friends do n't read this subreddit ( or if they do , they keep very quiet about it ) . 
  this is just a place to share stuff with other gravity falls fans . 
  look harder , there 's a stump . 
  oh man , that is a great idea . 
  i 'm going there in a month 's time , and i might have to make something just like this . 
  like [ this ] ( https://youtu.be/6uyngumu35o?t=55 ) !, 
  i 've seen a few people say they experienced this . 
  it 's definitely a bug that 's affecting random players . 
  consider yourself lucky ( or unlucky , depending on your point of view ) !, 
  it also means charger users are no longer shafted , because they typically scored much lower than other weapon types , although they can be game-changing when played well . 
  in the new system everyone wins , no matter their weapon . 
  it 's not ancient , but it is the weapon [ that won the great turf war ] ( http://i.imgur.com/pis2ftt.png ) . 
  [ it 's currently on the subreddit front page . 
  \\ # 14 has the squid squad on it .
