  [ time ] ( http://redd.it/1q2wc5 ), 
  this has been posted ... 
  i was going to add a few emotes the other day ( including a ducktective one ) , and i was about 45 minutes in when photoshop crashed and i lost it all . 
  that bummed me out so i gave up . 
  it 'll happen !, 
  fyi , you were shadowbanned from reddit . 
  see / r/shadowban . 
  hahaha why are you taking this bot so seriously, 
  fyi , you were shadowbanned from reddit . 
  see / r/shadowban . 
  you have squad and private battles now . 
  go find some good teammates and lead them to victory . 
  i know no one who owns it , but it 's super easy to find people to play with through reddit and [ squidboards ] ( http://squidboards.com/forums/squid-locator.35/ ) . 
  i do n't know , you must have broken one of [ reddit 's rules ] ( https://www.reddit.com/rules/ ) . 
  i do n't know . 
  i 've tried fixing it but nothing i do seems to have much of an effect . 
  dude , you 're being a jerk . 
  they came up with a theory , it was wrong , so what ? 
  they get it , you do n't need to drill it in by repeating that over and over . 
  this theme is awesome . 
  really , fantastic work . 
  you 're a credit to the team . 
  let 's go south pole !, 
  heck yeah , i want to play as one of the blobby tentacled guys . 
  they have such funny little legs . 
  because kids play this game !, 
  there were so many pop culture references in dd&md it was off the chart . 
  i did n't think this one was even worth mentioning . 
  wow , that is a gorgeous display . 
  who do you think had the best miiverse posts ? 
  i was on team south and i struggled to find anything worth yeahing . 
  you 're too late , the hiatus is over !, 
  if this is wrong , i do n't wan na be right . 
  he 's a voice actor . 
  his job is voice acting . 
  he 's not likely to just drop a ( very successful disney animated ) show just because it 's not `` big '' enough . 
  you are still vulnerable , but it 's possible they were suddenly shocked . 
  also you 're a much smaller target as a squid on the floor , so in the heat of battle it can look like you just disappeared . 
  by this hour , the americans have gone to bed while it 's just entering afternoon in japan . 
  it makes sense that the jp lot are taking over . 
  it 's chirpy * chips * . 
  as in , chiptunes . 
  in interviews , the developers said they did n't want to fix the splatfests to a specific schedule . 
  they 're in a nice routine now , but it wo n't necessarily stay that way . 
  na localisation team you have to stop, 
  the fourth wall ca n't take much more of a beating, 
  once you have the equivalent of 3 main abilities , it caps off and you ca n't boost the stats any higher . 
  morgan freeman, 
  my theory is that inklings do n't die in water , they just ca n't swim in it . 
  so if they fall in deep water , they just disintegrate themselves to avoid drowning . 
  woy has [ its creepy moments ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ubmbqno.jpg ) too . 
  although most of the boundary-pushing stuff it does is [ just bonkers ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hjbl1sepzy ) rather than dark . 
  ( woy is so great , i love it . ), 
  [ it 's from a vfx showcase . ] ( https://vimeo.com/119189638 ) . 
  ( the fog is n't real . ), 
  just so you 're aware , the fog is n't real . 
  it 's from [ this ] ( https://vimeo.com/119189638 ) very cool vfx showcase . 
  that was nearly the solution !, 
  turns out i needed this :, 
  . buttons { clear : both }, 
  did i ever promise this ? 
  people are making me feel like i promised it ... 
  he 's fat , and his pockets are full of gold ( which he has been buying ) . 
  there are n't actually any mlp emotes - i just borrowed the / r/mylittlepony code to make the sidebar 's emote table . 
  with that comes a lot of pony stuff . 
  awww , that 's adorable !, 
  the subreddit already has [ a chat room ] ( https://discord.gg/0rc4leyhvjdhjrlr ) !, 
  no thank you , we do n't allow this sort of thing here . 
  did you not read this post ? 
  stop it . 
  you are too late for the bill ama , it ended over 4 months ago . 
  it 's not hard , it 's just a bit fiddly and time consuming . 
  ( like most reddit moderation things ... ), 
  having to tap zr all the time can be a pain to start with , but once you get the hang of it you can cover turf , zip around the map and get splats like it 's nobody 's business . 
  it 's effectively a two-shot splat too , making it a straight upgrade from the / r/splatoon favourite .96 gal . 
  we just had the huge update that introduced proper ways to battle with friends , so the splatoon scene is just warming up . 
  this game is far from reaching its popularity peak , so you wo n't be disappointed if you jump on board now . 
  do n't worry about feeling like the only noob - there are still plenty of new players , and it 's not a hard game to learn . 
  it 's got that classic nintendo balance of being easy to pick up and play , but with mechanics that go deep if you care to dive down the rabbit hole . 
  [ check out the jp reveal video . 
  ] ( http://youtu.be/6z62q9sv2lu ) charge the rainmaker and it fires an inkzooka tornado of ungodly size . 
  i like how the shield around the rainmaker works before the weapon is picked up - shoot it and turns your colour and grows , the other team shoots it and it shrinks until it turns their colour . 
  we could see fierce firefights before the rainmaker delivery has even begun ... 
  there is n't one dedicated purely to that , although there is / r/splatoonmeta . 
  homework 's wack , and so are rules !, 
  man , i ca n't believe my heart still melts every time i hear those opening notes of sad machine . 
  it only counts as a spoiler if it contains content from an upcoming episode , or an episode that aired within the past 24 hours . 
  i un-marked this . 
  this is off-topic , i removed it . 
  the most used term i 've heard is `` fallers '' . 
  i 've seen about as many people say they hate as like it , though ... 
  that also makes it go faster !, 
  the box posts it to the splatoon miiverse community . 
  the posts you see in the plaza are a mix of ones from people you 've played with , popular posts and a few random ones here and there . 
  since the miiverse redesign about a week ago , it 's harder to find the latest splatoon posts on miiverse , so less get noticed , become popular and reach people 's plaza unless they 're * really * good . 
  i removed this because it 's off-topic . 
  we get some weird stuff here , but i 've removed this because it 's * too * weird . 
  [ here is a super handy guide !, 
  ] ( http://redd.it/s353z ) it 's old , but it 's still accurate . 
  people said it was the hiatus that was turning us crazy .
