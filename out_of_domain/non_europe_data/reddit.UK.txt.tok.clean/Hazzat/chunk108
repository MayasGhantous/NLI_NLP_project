  i think this shows that we 're all just crazy by nature . 
  [ it 's alex ( and his twin sister ) 's birthday . 
  ] ( http://gravityfalls.wikia.com/wiki/618 ) it 's hidden everywhere in the show . 
  there 's more to come , i 'm just waiting for the other new mods to accept their invites before making an official post . 
  it 's from s1e2 . 
  i did n't want to read this in grunkle stan 's voice . 
  reddit flairs are super fiddly to move around . 
  it might not be possible without deleting the flairs ( and removing them from everyone who has them ) and re-adding them . 
  yep , the main issue i had was the monotone voice and the fact that you repeated yourself a lot . 
  you said `` the tracks are bland '' a few too many times . 
  otherwise , this was a really well-made review . 
  nice one . 
  you get a message in your reddit inbox that says `` gadzooks ! '', 
  it was / u / - sar - . 
  where did they go , we do n't know !, 
  running off at a crucial time like that is dumb , but it remains true that you have to think about taking all the area you can while you have time . 
  you simply have more options the more ground you have in your colour . 
  there 's a balance to strike between the behaviour you described and purely playing the objective . 
  finding it makes for a team that knows how to push but can fight back if they lose the advantage , and that 's what wins games . 
  [ this is the reference ] ( https://youtu.be/d1_oj5llbqm?t=529 ) ( sorry if i spoiled it for you ), 
  [ that can be arranged . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1vsv3f7p40 ), 
   perhaps it was all covered up ? 
  well , it was 10,000 years ago . 
  it 's hardly breaking news . 
  it 's weird to think that callie and marie are post-apocalyptic news presenters . 
  i thought that would look more [ like this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0ixdosry0 ) . 
  yes , the rainmaker should not be at the front !, 
  it 's very hard to defend yourself when you 're carrying it , you need teammates keeping you safe . 
  i remove this because it 's off-topic . 
  this is n't a chatroom , it 's a place to share gravity falls stuff . 
  also , reddit has a 13 + age limit . 
  it 's not safe for kids . 
  / r/gravityfalls anticipates welcoming you !, 
  please stop posting that . 
  on the plus side , the us msrp is like $ 6 cheaper than the uk 's . 
  also [ the regressor ] ( http://the-regressor.tumblr.com/ ) . 
  no tutorials , but he shows a lot of his process . 
   fair and square, 
  well , i would n't say that . 
  i have a backup list . 
  one person already turned down the spot so i turned to it and invited someone else . 
  this guy had applied to a few places at once and also had an offer to moderate a huge default subreddit , so they chose to turn us down because they would n't be able to give this place enough attention . 
  you made the mistake of linking to www.np.reddit.com , rather than np.reddit.com . 
  the former triggers browsers into thinking they 're being sent to an untrustworthy site . 
  when swimming up a wall , you can tap x to speed up . 
  it provides enough of a boost to get you over little enemy spots like that . 
  i reached 700k , then decided i * really * wanted those perfect swim speed up red hi-tops . 
  24 sea snails and 300k coins later , still no perfect hi-tops . 
  watch your mouth , the nozzlenose is one of the game 's best weapons . 
  i 'm not kidding . 
  it 's tricky to get the hang of at first , mainly because the instinct is to spam zr , but once you find its rhythm it becomes an unstoppable killing/inking machine with unparalleled mobility options . 
  you just need to think carefully about when and where you place each shot , and when you do you 'll be able to trap enemies and quickly shoot them down with its lightning-fast ( effectively ) two-shot splat and formidable range . 
  the disruptor synergises incredibly well with its need for pinpoint accuracy too . 
  i 'd recommend checking out [ this squidboards discussion ] ( http://squidboards.com/threads/l-3-nozzlenose-discussion.2551/ ) . 
  on the first page everyone hates it , but as time goes by everyone realises it has some pretty unique strengths . 
  if ever i 'm having a bad day on the battlefield , i turn to the nozzlenose for some assured satisfying wins . 
  [ yeah , we know . 
  people are weird . 
  keep doing what you 're doing . 
  i have no doubt it will be an original composition by the show 's composer / u/bradjbreeck ( just like all the other music in the show ) . 
  fyi , you were shadowbanned from reddit so none of your posts show up . 
  for advice about what to do next , go to / r/shadowban . 
  / r/photoshop is active , and has plenty of links to related subreddits in its sidebar . 
  there 's a multiplayer mode called battle dojo where one player is on the tv and the other is on the gamepad , but it requires a classic/pro controller . 
  thank you for recommending the art aquarium !, 
  it looks so cool , i 'll definitely visit it . 
  i did n't know fuji was still climbable in september , i will consider that . 
  you unlock it at level 40 . 
  i 'm in eu and do n't like transformers , i 'll take pen vs. pencil over this any day . 
  the imaginary person was his drawing . 
  he 's sitting at an artist 's desk in the last frame . 
  who puts milk in a bag, 
  [ this is so wrong ] ( http://i.stack.imgur.com/ofltz.jpg ), 
  am i the only one who liked north vs. south pole ? 
  i am so so tempted to go to the reading friday just for porter , but i have n't commited yet . 
  i know the original drawing was n't nsfw , but without context like this it crosses the line . 
  also , stop submitting your stuff to the imgur gallery . 
  you do n't need to do that in order to share it here . 
  i know the original drawing was n't nsfw , but without context like this it crosses the line . 
  i 've removed this . 
  joke 's on bud , stan does n't even know what the internet is . 
  posting it to imgur is different to posting it to the imgur gallery . 
  as soon as you upload an image , you 're taken to its image page ( imgur.com/whatever ) , which is the link you want to share . 
  what you 've been doing is clicking `` submit to gallery '' after that , which submits it to the imgur community for them to vote on ( and the url changes to imgur.com/gallery/whatever ) . 
  the imgur people get very confused about why you have submitted the image to their community , and people here on reddit get annoyed because it becomes harder to open the image with helper tools like reddit enhancement suite . 
  the autobots vs. decepticons splatfest is sponsored by hasbro to promote the tv series and toy line [ transformers : robots in disguise ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/transformers:_robots_in_disguise_ ( 2015_tv_series \\ ) ) . 
  product placement in games is nothing new . 
  i do n't think it 's harmful when it 's done in as fun a way as this . 
  we esports now . 
  you can always check this with [ splatoon.ink ] ( http://splatoon.ink ) . 
  official info is [ here ] ( http://tokaigi.jp/gp/game/splatoon.html ) ( all in japanese , of course ) . 
  i figured this is worth sharing here because it 's a huge nationwide tournament supported by nintendo that points to an interesting future for their competitive games . 
  small stuff like `` new weapon coming tomorrow ! '', 
  should stay in / r/splatoon , i agree . 
  that was awesome . 
  for some reason north america got it at full price , everywhere else it was released with at least 1/3 off . 
  callie 'd it ? 
  it can absolutely work competitively - the concept is deceptively simple as there 's a wealth of strategy choices to make and you 're rewarded for fast reactions . 
  squidboards recently held its first competitive tournament , [ ink or sink ] ( http://squidboards.com/threads/ink-or-sink-tournament-v-1-1b-final-version.3564/ ) , which was very successful .
