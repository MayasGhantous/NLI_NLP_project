  brushes in general , or specifically the nouveau ? 
  you should use the `` roll '' ( getting your speed boost by putting the brush to the floor ) sparingly - you should always be either flinging ink , or swimming . 
  the roll is only good for cutting through enemy ink , either to escape from dangerous fire , or to dash up for an aggressive attack on a specific target . 
  you should never hit enemies from the front , always approach from the side or behind to avoid their attacks . 
  in the ranked game modes , it 's okay to use the roll to rush across neutral turf to the target ( zones , tower , rainmaker ) . 
  i 'm not a fan personally - i think inline emotes work great if they 're little 16x16 emoticons , but big 70x70 ones look best with one-per-line . 
  that 's the way it works on / r/mylittlepony , which is where we `` borrowed '' the emote code from . 
  follow [ this page ] ( http://gravityfalls.wikia.com/wiki/list_of_cryptograms ) as you go to pick up all the secret messages . 
  you 're only seeing half the story without them . 
  first of all , leave this subreddit and do n't return until you 're caught up . 
  spoilers !, 
  things get steadily darker as it goes on , although stuff does n't get really creepy until the season 1 finale and season 2 . 
  i recommend you follow the [ list of cryptograms ] ( http://gravityfalls.wikia.com/wiki/list_of_cryptograms ) as you go ( but do n't read ahead ) to uncover all the secret messages hidden in every episode , as they contribute a great deal to the foreshadowing . 
  it is stupid though - the fastest way to get a villager out of your town is to just ignore them . 
  ... i do n't think you know what trolling is . 
  the endgame gear unlocks are the unique , unbuyable stuff you get every five levels after level 20 . 
  i think that adds the longevity you seek . 
  [ too slow ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/gravityfalls/comments/3hmkty/family_and_friends/ ), 
   also , real local multiplayer for splatoon when ? 
  never . 
  the game is too graphically demanding for the wii u to handle that many displays at once . 
  the enemy ca n't hear your booyahs . 
  it already starts to chug a bit when a lot of special attacks are going off - they went a bit heavy on the particle effects . 
  dropping the fps to 30 might help , but it 's undesirable in a fast-paced action game like this . 
  it was a [ mikan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/japanese_citrus ) . 
  what rank are you ? 
  everyone i 've been playing with at a - / a has been pretty competent ( except me , lol ) .

  of all the hidden things in the show , this one gets posted a lot for some reason . 
  ( this is only a small selection , it 's been posted many more times . ), 
  post removed for being off-topic . 
  the emote guide is at the bottom of the sidebar . 
  [ too slow ] ( https://redd.it/3htfxe ), 
  i do n't think you know what an ama is . 
  i 've removed this post . 
  ok , so who are you asking questions to ? 
  there 's no one here who can answer them . 
  they 're not here right now , and there are no plans for them to visit any time soon . 
  amas are big , special events that only last for a few hours . 
  if there 's ever one happening , we let everyone know . 
  if you do move akihabara to the first evening , make sure you do n't leave it too late . 
  the place pretty much shuts down at 8pm and there is n't much to do after that . 
  it might be worth doing two observation desks if you do one on your first leg in tokyo , and the other when you get back - it can provide some nice perspective !, 
  there is n't much besides the view up the skytree , but it does have view of them all . 
  tokyo tower 's is great too . 
  the met gov building is a slightly less slick operation - it 's just one big room with windows around the side , and some of the view is blocked either by structural support for the building or by the surrounding skyscrapers . 
  however , it does have a very extensive gift shop for all things japanese , and i found i left with pretty much all my gifts for people back home ... 
  i know , it 's got creepy human teeth rather than normal inkling teeth !, 
  the only strange thing happening right now is that japan is having their splatfest . 
  the team without the rainmaker gets a free tenacity ability . 
  i doubt it 's affected by special charge up though . 
  the i like trains kid is already [ making appearances on miiverse ] ( https://miiverse.nintendo.net/posts/ayqhaaabaacxvhhnfsqasg ) . 
  why not `` we stan do it ? '', 
  sewing \u2260 knitting . 
  my theory is that she knitted [ all 98 of them ] ( http://gravityfalls.wikia.com/wiki/list_of_mabel%27s_sweaters ) beforehand , then put them inside dipper 's jacket with infinitely deep pockets . 
  in [ a developer interview ] ( http://nintendoeverything.com/splatoon-staff-talk-about-the-inkling-design-more-on-the-squid-sisters-and-other-topics/ ) , it was revealed that the splatfest themes are inadvertently set by the extinct humans :, 
   the world of splatoon takes place 12,000 years after the present time and the squid sisters are those who receive messages from 12,000 years ago . 
  like there would be a discussion ` rice or bread ? ', 
  in current time , and those words fly to another planet and bounce back for them to receive . 
  those divine messages come from kami-sama [ kami means a god , sama is a honorific like - san ] . 
   alex hirsch says that season 2 is already finished, 
  where did he say this ? 
  there is no way to tell who has more votes until the splatfest is over . 
  just pick your favourite team and enjoy yourself . 
  check out the subreddit 's very own [ tokyo guide ] ( https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wjqjkyekbhsutsj8lxj8ocn0gsoxopf_sroybejlbky/ ) . 
  it 's extensive , and breaks attractions down by interests and location , and even provides some sample itineraries . 
  do n't panic !, 
  he also wrote [ a theme tune ] ( http://youtu.be/tbuedhfsvhm ) for the show ( although it was n't used in the end ) . 
  edit : [ non-instrumental version ] ( http://youtu.be/tpybdomh4gm ) ( it 's better ), 
  [ ] ( #adorablles ) i think we 've waited long enough now , i 'll make the announcement later today . 
  it applies to comments too . 
  removed . 
  i love it but , yeah , wrong sub . 
  all we know is that it was someone on the development team . 
  games art does n't tend to get attributed to the actual artist , just `` nintendo '' . 
  also they 're not actual paintings , they were done in photoshop . 
  you are correct . 
  [ ] ( #bipper ), 
  [ ] ( #stanthink ) i feel like these ytps that try to cut up the show in funny ways do n't really work because the show is so funny to begin with . 
  he 's in there because the jfk assassination is surrounded by conspiracy theories , just like all the other things bill flashes up in that sequence . 
  it only gets worse when you move up !, 
  removed for being off-topic, 
  yes , this will be happening . 
  what browser are you using ? 
  if you have the rainmaker , do everything you can to push forward . 
  do n't necessarily kamikaze it , but fire enough shots to clear out a path for yourself and charge . 
  if your team is close behind , hold on for a second and spam `` c'mon ! / to me ! '', 
  until they arrive . 
  if you do n't have the rainmaker , you have to remember that the person who does is largely helpless , and wo n't be able to go very far without a strong backup from all of their team . 
  do n't go off and play turf war , do n't get into a one-on-one firefight with an enemy team member . 
  either stay by the rainmaker 's side to fight off anyone attacking them , or go ahead and clear the path for them . 
  really that 's all a rainmaker carrier can dream of - a nice clear ink path all the way to the goal . 
  i 'm a big fan of keeping things clean and simple , i 've seen busy flairs clutter up too many subreddits . 
  if you were n't from the us , i 'd suggest a working holiday visa because it 's pretty much exactly what you 're looking for . 
  however , it 's not available to us citizens . 
  if you 're going in on a normal tourist visa , any sort of paid work would be illegal .
