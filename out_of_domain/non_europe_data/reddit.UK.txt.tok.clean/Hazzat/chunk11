  the users steal a lot ( almost all ) of their content from other sites , especially reddit . 
  but it goes deeper than that , it 's been proven that the site 's management actively goes out and steals content , then uses bots to get it onto their front page , masquerading as community members . 
  [ here 's a post explaining it all . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/4chan/comments/zacju/9gag_repost_machine_explained/ ), 
  fish fingers and custard . 
  you can see quite clearly that each controller ( the gamepad , wiimote and nunchuck ) has a big fat cable sticking into the bottom of it to stop you just picking it up and walking away . 
  well , it * is * snoop dogg 's birthday . 
  this drama was resolved * looooong * ago . 
  pretty much the day after it was raised , i remember . 
  [ ] ( / ajsup ) most of reddit does n't take too kindly to little ponies , and / r/minecraft does n't like pixel art very much . 
  you may find a better reception on / r/mylittleminecraft , but we 're a bit flooded with pixel art as it is already . 
  get creative , build something interesting that 's your own !, 
  people will be much more likely to like it . 
  [ ] ( / raritywut ) but ... they 're not facing each other . 
  my littlest pony ? 
  there 's a table in the sidebar . 
  it 's labeled ** emoticons ** . 
  hover over the tabs and you get all the codes . 
  [ ] ( / a13 `` buying ponies ? '' ), 
  you can use mcpatcher !, 
  it 's already been updated for 1.4 and works just fine with the pre-release . 
  you can download it [ here ] ( http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1496369-14-132-125-etcupdate-930-mcpatcher-hd-fix-243-01/ ) . 
  [ ] ( / raritywhy ) put some clothes on !!, 
  but artistically it 's very good . 
  the first thing that springs to mind is [ this brilliant nightmare night pmv ] ( http://youtube.com/watch?v=ar9dppcocvc ), 
  [ that myth was busted . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-zewwwb4r4 ) slimes can spawn on blocks with torches on them . 
  i doubt that makes a difference ( i 'm fairly sure the only thing that matters is the tile the mob is spawning on , as long as there 's enough room to accomodate its height ) but i have n't done any research so i 'm not going to pretend i know . 
  you know you can edit comments , right ? 
  it would probably be a better idea to always do @a rather than @p . it makes the map friendlier to multiplayer . 
  the sidebar 's pretty full as it is . 
  it 's not hard to find the current snapshot , they 're all on mojang.com ( and if you 'd rather have the reddit post so you can see redstonehelper 's changelog , the search box is n't hard to use ) . 
  if you 're looking to contact the / r/minecraft mods , you should [ send them mod mail ] ( http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2fminecraft ) . 
  day 1 of the subreddit and people are already breaking the rules . 
   * this is not circlejerk or anything so no all caps . 
  they 've just placed down a ton of [ beacons ] ( http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/beacon ) and activated them all by putting them on a layer of iron blocks . 
  yay for res and the z key !, 
  mad ass *, 
  you could have a lever on top of the block the button is on to look more like a joystick . 
  ( i have n't tried it out so i do n't know how that good that would look . ), 
  well it should be !, 
  and we need lots of them !, 
  any major last-minute additions would be fairly reckless . 
  you 've got ta test things for bugs first or you risk having to do more updates later to fix them . 
  i 'm more fascinated by that spiralling cavern over on the left . 
  [ ] ( / rdcry ) fun things are not always responsible things . 
  it 's not fun if the fun things are buggy !, 
  you can use [ mcedit ] ( http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/13807-mcedit-minecraft-world-editor-now-open-source/ ) to move players around . 
  i 'm pretty sure you can use it to move spawn points too but i have n't checked so do n't quote me on that . 
  where did your horn go ? 
  what mods ( if any ) do you have installed ? 
  [ ] ( / flutterwink ) he 's not a voice actress . 
  seriously though , everyone who works on the show is from vancouver ( or the philippines ) unless there 's a special reason for it . 
  the only major people who are n't are lauren , tara ( who 's still canadian ) and john . 
  from the [ list ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/minecraft/faq#minecraftsubredditrules ) of things not to post in / r/minecraft :, 
   * ** ore clusters ** - an image that only exists to record a user finding a group of ores . 
  you 're right , it 's not in the creative inventory . 
  i do n't know if that 's intentional . 
  / give < your username  137, 
  the texture of the actual frame is the birch wood planks texture . 
  maybe it 's an incentive for gamers to take frequent breaks to wash their hands ? 
  or just for gamers to keep clean in general ... 
  i 'm not sure if their blank post was intentional , but they were linking to this : http://imgur.com/hkmzj, 
  i patrol the new queue to keep memes ( especially image macros ) out anyway . 
  besides , this one 's borderline breaking the rules . 
   keep posts related to mlp or the fandom . 
  you should be able to tell it 's related without reading the title . 
  glorification of the occult . 
  because every now and then , redditors decide to follow [ reddiquette ] ( http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette ) . 
   ** please do n't : **, 
   ** make comments that lack content . 
  ** phrases such as `` this '' , `` lol '' , and `` i came here to say this '' are not witty or original , and do not add anything to the discussion . 
   i would n't say i 'm the best admin , but i consider myself to be a decent one . 
  i would imagine almost all server admins say the same about themselves . 
  it 's an easter egg in 1.4 , play minecraft on october 31st and some mobs will be wearing pumpkins !, 
  i hear there 's more than just that ... 
  / u/schroedingers _ cat conforms and does not conform at the same time . 
  ( but only while you 're not looking . ), 
  zone 1 is central london , and zone 6 is the outskirts . 
  i know , how old is that map ? 
  the dlr 's a funny colour . 
  for any outsiders reading , [ here is an up-to-date tube map ] ( http://www.tfl.gov.uk/assets/downloads/standard-tube-map.gif ) ( zones labelled ) . 
  it says at the top of * every single * / r/minecraft page :, 
   yes , we know about the halloween easter-egg ; no , you do n't need to make your own submission about it, 
  i would imagine that 's there because of the contest google held to see who could hack chrome ( something like that ) which was won by a user who went by the name pinkie pie . 
  the rover has an official twitter account :, 
  work in progress . 
  [ ] ( / raritywhy ) nooo not more image macros, 
  [ ] ( / cadance ) please drop the idea of a `` hater '' . 
  there 's no such thing and because it 's such a moronic idea it makes everyone else look bad . 
  done !, 
  not only that , but the front page of / r/all . 
  good grief . 
  [ this is n't even the first time this has happened ... ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/minecraft/comments/rm2to/oh_no_its_a_sea_monster/ ), 
  [ ] ( / ajsup ) bronies are a little more picky about quality content . 
  but it 's from my little pony ... 
  you ai n't seen nothing until you 've seen grass in a mushroom biome . 
  ( by which i mean actual grass , not mycelium . ), 
  actually , [ this is what i did when i messed around with grass colours \\ ( and leaf colours \\ ) ] ( http://i.imgur.com/chv8b.jpg ) ... 
  an * eternity * 's worth of free time .
