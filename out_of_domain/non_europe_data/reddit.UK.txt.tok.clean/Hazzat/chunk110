  you can try looking at other visas to see if there 's one that might fit you , but the ones that allow you to get a job are really meant for people staying longer than just 3 weeks . 
  tentatek splattershots and krak-on splat rollers are the most popular weapons in the as , but they are n't the majority as every weapon has something to offer ( except aerosprays , no one uses those ) . 
  only you can work out what the best weapons and gear are for your playstyle . 
  discovering that is part of the fun of the game !, 
  aerosprays are great for inking turf , but often lose in a firefight due to their very short range . 
  in the ranked game modes , inking turf is not the priority at all , so the aerospray becomes pretty weak . 
  all-rounders or weapons that specialise in getting splats tend to be stronger choices . 
  blasters are very popular in tower control .

  also , your account was deleted for a reason . 
  you are too young for this site . 
  uhhhh , no i do n't !, 
  does n't look like your change broke anything though . 
  it 's certainly handy when cooking and your hands are busy . 
  i totally agree . 
  i do n't think the fact that this is a drawing adds much to the image that a photograph would n't have captured anyway . 
  \\ ^ this is every secret code in the show decrypted . 
  it 's actually a jellyfish playground , you can see them hanging out there sometimes . 
  the puns never end !,

  you ca n't just post [ eyes in triangles ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eye_of_providence ) here and say it 's bill . 
  wow , this is uncannily like [ mars argo computer show ] ( http://youtu.be/wwx41xvmzv8 ) ( who also make cool pop-rock ) . 
  shibuya is the only place you 'll really find halloween festivities , and it is absolutely crazy . 
  you must go and see it . 
  it 's good for your back . 
  it 's the boobs . 
  ( also this is n't a real deleted scene . ), 
  it 's definitely a boss with the big tentacle coming out the top . 
  perhaps an early version of the octonozzle ? 
  fox is n't ... 
  we might do at some point . 
  nintendo just has to find an advertiser who wants to join in . 
  i 'm pretty happy without sponsored splatfests . 
  i just would n't feel right fighting to prove one brand 's dominance over another . 
  ^ ( also i think transformers is super lame ), 
  so jealous of those shoes , i 've spent at least 30 sea snails plus a big pile of cash trying to get the same ones ... :(, 
  i see someone with these shoes almost every day and order it ... no luck !, 
  i have a set with 2 swim speed ups , but i 've never managed to roll all 3 . 
  it 's a fast , short-range charger that does maximum 80hp per hit . 
  the .52 gal does ~ ~ 70hp ~ ~ 52hp per hit . 
  the bamboozler is a charger weapon through , so it will play completely differently . 
  bonus trivia : in splatoon lore , it 's [ the weapon that won the great turf war ] ( http://cdn.wikimg.net/splatoonwiki/images/e/e5/sunkenscroll14.png ) . 
  i can not stand watching gamexplain videos because of his voice . 
  they really need to get someone else to do the narration or get andre diction lessons , because his light-speed slurred speech is not nice to listen to . 
  me too , man . 
  me too . 
  most of this week i saw more dancing , but the past few days it 's been all singing . 
  i ca n't call it . 
  this is amazing !, 
  thanks for making it . 
  they actually did . 
  after a string of great games that were n't publicised well , it was refreshing to see ads for splatoon all over the place . 
  on tv , in the cinema , online ... 
  it was great . 
  no , they 're holding all the splatfest decorations . 
  holy crap these are cool designs . 
  please tag as spoilers !, 
  you made it sound so cool that i went to buy it straight away !, 
  ... only to find it 's not available in europe . 
  hah , it 's not your fault !, 
  i 'll just sit here twiddling my ~ ~ thumbs ~ ~ tentacles until it shows up . 
  [ shh shh , do n't worry . 
  it 's fun to snipe people with this , but it is really poor at actually inking turf . 
  i struggled to score even 400p every time i used it . 
  it 's still day 1 though , there 's much to be learned about this weapon . 
  he makes a fine theorist . 
  he should come join us . 
  yep , [ here it is ] ( http://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/downloadable_content ) . 
  [ here 's a nice summary of all the evidence we had .

  [ here 's the discussion ] ( https://redd.it/2wfal3 ) from the last time someone asked this . 
  they cover pretty much everything !, 
  oh man , i 'm getting flashbacks to [ mario chase ] ( http://static4.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/mig/9/4/6/1/2019461-673043_20121116_003.jpg ) . 
   it seems like he hit on a very solid basic game that developed into a world beating piece of software , but really lacked any kind of vision for how to proceed . 
  notch 's minecraft had a vague direction behind it . 
  it was very archetypal : 3 distinct types of tree , 2 types of flower , 5 animals with their own purpose , 6 ores , just enough biomes ... 
  it was only when he started letting go of the game and other developers take control that features really started to be `` tacked on '' . 
  i feel for anyone who starts playing the game today as there 's so much to learn . 
  i 've seen tweets from him in the past where he talked about wanting to just make games in his spare time like he did in the past and publish them anonymously . 
  maybe he tried that already , who knows ? 
  the pass can be useful in tokyo ( it covers a number of lines in the city , including the yamanote ) , but unless you 're using the train there a * lot * you 'd be better off getting the 7-day pass and using pasmo/suica for your time in tokyo . 
  this means i 've won all four splatfests so far . 
  anyone else in the same position ? 
  not gon na lie , i was hoping for a bit more of a graphical upgrade now it 's on ps4 . 
  this looks like just more of the same from f and f 2nd . 
  the list of producers is awesome though , so it should be fun anyway . 
  i 'd guess most fans are kids who like disney cartoons and are n't old enough for internet forums . 
   internet is 10 + people ,10 + . 
  [ 13 + actually ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/children%27s_online_privacy_protection_act ) , for almost all sites you can sign up to that are n't specifically kid-targeted ( eg club penguin ) . 
  most sites are 13 + * by law * , no matter your opinion . 
  this includes reddit , which is absolutely not safe for kids . 
  if you want something changed about the subreddit , [ message the moderators ] ( https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2fgravityfalls ) !, 
  it 's much better than making a post . 
  looks like it 's fixed now , but we would have fixed it way earlier if someone actually pointed it out . 
  i 'm studying 3d animation ( which in many cases leads to work making adverts ) and that sort of life is just seen as part of the job . 
  if you want to follow your passion and make animated films , you 'd better be prepared to dedicate every waking hour to your project , give your all to hit the deadlines and do n't be surprised if you get fired once the film is done because they 're reshuffling the studio .
