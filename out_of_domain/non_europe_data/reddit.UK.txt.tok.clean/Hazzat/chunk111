  but it 's okay because it 's your * passion * , you * wanted * to do this , right ? 
  same goes for vfx . 
  for many people working in the field , making blockbuster movies has always been the dream , no matter the cost . 
  there are splatoon brand water pistols often available in stores that stock amiibo , and there are keychains and squid cushions available in japan which you can get from sites like jbox , play asia and amiami . 
  i think that 's it though . 
  the best way might be to plan your day around the area you want to visit twice . 
  for example , you could do skytree -  asakusa -  akihabara -  dinner time ( sundown ) -  skytree -  asakusa as they 're all quite close to each other . 
  ( akihabara is n't really worth visiting after dark , everything closes at 8pm . ), 
  as both the places you 're staying are a little awkward to travel to/from due to them not being on the yamanote line , grouping the nearby locations together and making a day of it is probably the most efficient choice . 
  according to [ this ] ( http://www.sunrise-and-sunset.com/en/sun/japan/nikko/2015/october/21 ) , sunset will be at 5pm that day , so you 're probably better off with the morning hike . 
  other than that , you sound all sorted !, 
  regarding the jr pass , you wo n't need it in tokyo as it 's much more cost-effective to use a pasmo/suica card . 
  that said , if you drop to a 7-day pass and only use it for your second week , you 'll be without it for those two days you 're in the fuji area ... 
  it 's worth using [ hyperdia ] ( http://www.hyperdia.com/ ) to calculate whether it would be cheaper to just pay normally for those two days instead of buying the 14-day pass . 
  and remember , when you activate your jr pass it does n't have to start on the day you go the ticket office and pick it up , you can ask them to make it valid from a different date .

  the stream link always goes in the prediction/reaction/discussion posts so people can find it on the day !, 
  i feel the same . 
  i ca n't keep up with these whippersnappers . 
  do n't tell anyone this , but ...

  looks damn good !, 
  i 'm down to implement my theme whenever but i do n't think people liked it which is why i have n't done it . 
  can you post a screenshot ? 
  it looks fine to me in chrome . 
  [ according to the guy who posted it ] ( http://squidboards.com/threads/kelp-dome-analysis-and-thoughts.2346/page-2#post-86336 ) , it 's possible to do it faster than in the video . 
  even if it takes longer , there 's something to be said for the ambush power this gives you , especially if your team is pinned down and ca n't break into the middle area . 
  / u/catjaz63 did it , but i think it was a mistake . 
  i 've un-spoilered it now . 
  i got super hyped for this game , but ended up really disappointed . 
  it does its best to be crazy and weird , but it 's so shallow that after three days i 'd seen pretty much everything . 
  it gets very repetitive . 
  i 'd only recommend it if you can get it at a discount . 
  it 's fun , but it should n't be a full-price game . 
  no one said this . 
  the overworld is above ground , but the levels themselves are deep below . 
  [ this kinda explains it ] ( http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2015-05-15/love-live-rin-could-promote-puyo-puyo-yakuza-chain-chronicle-games-next/.88202 ) - people voted to choose which franchise she should promote . 
  why rin specifically ? 
  i have no idea . 
  where did you find this ? 
  i 've been hunting all over tokyo this week for splatoon stuff and have n't seen any . 
  * one good thing about ink , when it hits you , you feel no pain . 
  i was under the impression that this would be 3-shot splat , unlike the regular nozzlenose which is 4 . 
  so you can kill after pressing zr once , making it kinda `` one hit kill '' . 
  clear skies at last !, 
  also in eu it says `` you captured all splat zones ! '', 
  rather than `` we capped a zone ! '', 
  so these phrases are probably from an older version , yeah . 
  i would n't put it past disney to stick a year-long hiatus between finale part 1 and finale part 2 . 
  no joke , i think this is one of the best remixes of anything i have ever heard ever . 
  i went to see it in japan , and we all got [ film strips ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bb1s5dc.jpg ) with our tickets . 
  there was none of the atmosphere people have been describing here though , i guess because over there the movie has been out for over 3 months . 
  this is off-topic , i removed it . 
  oh thank goodness , i 'm not alone . 
  i see so many people saying `` i love coffee ... 
  i need coffee ... 
  i ca n't function without coffee ... '' but i seem to manage fine without it . 
  yes , nara is n't huge and if you only really want to see the big buddha you can definitely do it in a morning . 
  just find your trains beforehand ( hyperdia ) and keep one eye on the time !, 
  it 's just a picture of a six-fingered hand . 
  that does n't make it gf-related . 
  ohh , this is gorgeous . 
  yep . 
  that would probably be a long day though , so get up early and make sure you have a plan to follow . 
  this is such a vague question , we ca n't possibly help you because we do n't know what you 'd like to see . 
  start with [ the faq ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/japantravel/help/faqs/japantravel ) , learn [ how much to budget ] ( http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2410.html ) and browse [ japan guide ] ( http://www.japan-guide.com/ ) to find things you want to do . 
  if you still have questions after all that , come back and ask them . 
  you 're unlikely to need any gifts unless you end up visiting someone 's house . 
  that said , if you do want to pack some just in case , anything that is unique to where you 're from ( either your country or state ) will go down well , especially if it 's in nice packaging . 
  i visited from the uk recently and brought a pack of harrod 's biscuits . 
  she 's a popular fan artist : http://gitgudnami.tumblr.com, 
  lately she 's been holding a contest where the aim is to find her in your plaza , so people here have been going crazy trying to spot her .

  maximum freshness . 
  maybe your brain blocked them out because they 're so dorky . 
  we do n't know the real reason , but it 's probably technical . 
  the game already struggles to stay at 60fps sometimes when there are multiple special moves going off at once , so i imagine getting it to show four different players ' views would be too much to ask . 
  the writing with the coins explains how each area is splatoon-inspired . 
  the first thing you do is transform into a squid and jump into an ink-covered wall etc. 
  i like how the elements of the game were interpreted here . 
  also , the losing team in rainmaker automatically gets their special meters filled over time . 
  lots of quick specials are to be expected . 
  this happened to / r/splatoon . 
  while it 's not so bad as to be insufferable , people there take the game so seriously and the salt is unreal . 
  would it kill you to just chill out and make an effort to enjoy the ( very fun ) game ? 
   for the life of my i ca n't understand why they would n't at least do a crossover with super mario sunshine . 
  splatoon is but a baby ip and needs time to bloom on its own before other ips get tacked onto it . 
  let 's just be happy it exists . 
  we 'll definitely has a retrospective sometime towards the end . 
  depends which ranked mode . 
  beakons are awesome for splat zones because they let your team continue to put the pressure on even if you all get splatted , but they 're less useful in the other modes . 
  lower the sensitivity . 
  it 's easier to get those sharpshooting snipes when your aim is n't wobbling around so much .
