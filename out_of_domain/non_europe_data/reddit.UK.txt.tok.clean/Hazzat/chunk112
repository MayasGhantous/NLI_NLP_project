  depends how you sort the comments . 
  ` top ' simply shows the comments with the highest score first , whereas ` best ' is a combination of high score * and * high percentage of upvotes . 
  so the other comment may have scored more , but it may be that only 75 % of the votes on it were up . 
  i spent a few days in fukuoka recently , and my fellow hostel-stayers agreed that it 's really not that interesting a place . 
  i struggled to fill even one day there !, 
  it can be a good spot for making day trips to elsewhere in kyushu though ( beppu , kagoshima ) . 
  you might want to cut some days out of tokyo and put them in osaka or kyoto , but it honestly depends on what you 're most interested in . 
  as for unmissable stuff , i 'd recommend making a stop at himeji while shink ` ing it to osaka/kyoto . 
  you can get off the train , leave your bags at the station , see the castle there in 1-2 hours , then be on your way . 
  you keep saying `` booyah base '' when you mean `` inkopolis plaza '' . 
  booyah base specifically refers to the shops in the plaza ... 
  wow , this works so well !, 
  awesome stuff . 
  it 's how taiwanese animators like to report the news .

  he tries a little wiggle , it goes wrong . 
  ^ ( what a prick ), 
  because `` inkling '' is a pun . 
  splatoon feeds on puns . 
  love your videos . 
  thanks for keeping it real on a youtube with so much crap on it . 
  i swear you 're the most [ freebooted ] ( http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=freebooting ) guy on the internet . 
  are you planning to do anything about it ? 
  there are thousands of facebook pages that exist only to rip off popular youtubers , and your videos pop up all over them . 
  unilad/lad bible is kinda the king of them all . 
  i try to stay away from those pages so i ca n't provide any specific examples . 
  [ here 's a good video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6a1lt0kvma ) about it . 
  the guy who fell off a cliff was n't the inventor , he was the ceo of the company . 
  why do people here take stuff so seriously all the time ? 
  there was a bit of a delay announcing the singing vs. 
  dancing splatfest too . 
  do n't worry about it , it 'll be revealed in a day or two . 
  every upvote provides him with another little window to peek through . 
  no , people are just really fussy around here for some reason . 
  geez , the funposts are strong today . 
  removed for being off-topic . 
  [ ] ( #heraim ) hey , wan na hear a joke ? 
  holy smokes , that was awesome . 
  they 're all important , sorry !, 
  this show lives off continuity , and there are very few filler episodes that you can skip without missing important story points/details . 
  make sure you 're reading along with the [ list of cryptograms ] ( http://gravityfalls.wikia.com/wiki/list_of_cryptograms ) as you go so you learn about all the secret codes - but do n't read ahead !, 
  and yes , you should leave this place right now to avoid spoilers . 
  come back when you 're caught up . 
  no , run speed up does not affect your speed when you 're using any roller weapon ( brushes included ) . 
  this is n't the first time there 's been a few days between announcements , the singing vs. 
  dancing one was delayed too . 
  do n't panic . 
  the admins of the wikia site have joined inkipedia , but wikia ( as in , the people who own the actual wikia.com ) will refuse to let the wiki die . 
  so there will continue to be two wikis , but inkipedia will be better supported . 
  [ here 's the announcement they made ] ( http://splatoon.wikia.com/wiki/user_blog:xavthedragon/so,_about_this_wikia ) , and you can see wikia 's response in the comments . 
  clearly the wiki was generating them quite a few page views , so they 'd rather not lose it . 
  [ according to the developers ] ( http://nintendoeverything.com/splatoon-staff-talk-about-the-inkling-design-more-on-the-squid-sisters-and-other-topics/ ) , the splatfest themes are generated by humans debating things today . 
  those thoughts fly into space , bounce off another planet and return via fax machine 12,000 years later . 
  i could n't make this up if i tried . 
  people complained that having him there was a spoiler . 
  this was a quick fix . 
  haha yeah , we do n't know lots of things ... 
  [ ] ( #lotsofthings ) lots of things ... 
  remain indoors . 
  it 's not the first time we got the announcement later than everyone else , but by this point it 's safe to assume that we wo n't be seeing a splatfest this week . 
  on the plus side , if all the regions ' splatfests are staggered , we can actually have our moment on / r/splatoon without getting buried by na splatfest stuff !, 
  i think it 's just so the splatfests are staggered . 
  it was n't ideal having the na and eu ones at the same time . 
  focussed spread , decent range , splat bombs and echolocator makes it an unstoppable search-and-destroy machine in the right hands . 
  am i the only person who thinks there have n't been any bad splatfest themes ? 
  you guys are all so fussy . 
  i thought that one was great !, 
  bear in mind the question was n't `` which do you prefer '' , it was `` which would you rather visit '' . 
  mt fuji is closed outside the summer months . 
  people who try to go up outside the official season run the serious risk of freezing to death or being blown off the mountain . 
  sorry , but in january all you can do with fuji is look at it . 
  it 's not something i have personal experience with , but [ here 's the japan guide page on ski and snowboarding ] ( http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2273.html ) . 
  you should find all the info you need there . 
  they 're great , but what i love about their current outfits is that they echo the [ look of stuffed squid ] ( http://ediblyasian.info/resources/recipe-images2/stuffed-calamari.jpg ) irl . 
  it 's just another thing that makes them squid-like . 
  i do n't think they 're unloved at all , i see them a lot . 
  the tri-slosher is so much fun on tower control . 
  get to a spot above the tower and you can rain your ink down on it , quickly clearing out all the enemies who are riding . 
  doing that over and over was what finally pushed me into a + !, 
  it starts at 1am here in the uk . 
  not ideal on a monday night !,

   he revealed that he had pitched three ideas to disney : one about ole-timey gentelmen in the 1800s , one was gravity falls , and the other was about ** time-travelling dolphins ** .

   probably really rich, 
  real life idols usually get very little for their work , because the agent takes the lion 's share . 
  they probably live in a tiny little apartment . 
  `` the end if the world is closer than the end of the summer . '',

  there 's a 1/33 chance of rolling a single quick respawn as it 's less likely to show up on zink . 
  the chances of getting all 3 are 1/35937 or 0.00003 % .

  in their own community , they can do what they want . 
  we do n't allow linking to such unsavoury places here , but we ca n't and are n't looking to shut them down . 
  a question that ford posed in the latest episode : why * is * gravity falls such a strange place ? 
  was it because the ufo crashed there , or is there something about it that caused the ufo to crash ?
