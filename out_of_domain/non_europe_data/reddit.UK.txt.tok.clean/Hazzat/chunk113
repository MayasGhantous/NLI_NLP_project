  i agree , naked squid are so lewd !, 
  this guy needs to get to booyah base and invest in some gear . 
  eh , it 's # 25 as part of an event that already costs ~ # 20 to enter . 
  that 's a lot if i only want to watch one movie . 
  as much as i love michael rosen , this is really off-topic and i removed it . 
  yeah i know , but if it 's a choice between one or the other i 'd have to choose the expo . 
  there 's a lot to see there - i 'd miss out on a lot by spending all day in a cinema instead . 
  i 'm just sad because i really wanted to see the movie , but this price is too much . 
  she 's asking where his ticket is . 
  oh man , they buffed all my favourite weapons and nerfed all the ones i hate playing against !, 
  this is a dream come true !, 
  as much as i feel for the roller users , i 've been one-shotted out of nowhere by the friggin ' things enough times to agree they needed to be toned back . 
  ^ ( * fixed typo ), 
  on the plus side , it means you do n't have to stack damage ups anymore . 
  you can use other abilities !, 
  every upvote on this subreddit provides another window to peep through !, 
  are you talking about the 2.2.0 update ? 
  if so , that was n't datamined . 
  it was [ announced officially ] ( http://splatoonus.tumblr.com/post/131257799689/listen-up-kids-and-squids-the-splatoon ) with patch notes available on the nintendo.com site . 
  this was n't a leak , and is nothing spoilery . 
  it 's not dissimilar to [ this equally funky remix ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7qt_smaocy ) of totoro 's ` path of the wind ' . 
  then what the heck do we put in the sidebar, 
  explain like i 'm \u4e09\u6b73 . 
  in the discussions i 've seen , people decided that he either did n't want the rift to be out of his sight , or he wanted to apply the adhesive asap and the fastest way to do that would be to do it at the ship . 
  ( although that does n't explain why he did n't actually apply the adhesive as soon as they got it . ), 
  lewis , what happened to your beard ? 
  you mixed up level with rank . 
  you rank does * not * affect the gear that appears . 
  the flounder heights shortcut is probably [ this ] ( http://gfycat.com/livelydistortedaustraliancattledog ) . 
  i 'm a student on the outskirts of london ( 20 minutes by train ) sharing a house with other students , and we pay ~ # 300/mo each . 
  this guy is pulling prices out of his arse . 
  and a # 70k - # 90k student loan ? 
  tuition is # 27k for three years , and you can optionally borrow an extra # 3k/year on top of that from student finance england . 
  i have no idea where such a huge figure came from . 
  do n't believe a word . 
  ^ ( hello fellow maki fan \uff9f \u25bd \uff9f / ), 
  this was about three weeks ago now , and while i was there akihabara was in full-on love live mode . 
  all the sega arcades were having some sort of tie-in event which meant they were all playing * \u03bc * 's songs and most of the ufo catchers had love live stuff in them . 
  there was even one which had the walls decorated with happy birthday wishes for kottori . 
  protip : only play the ufo catchers if you like playing ufo catchers - if you just want whatever 's inside , you 'll probably find for much cheaper than you would have paid if you scour the shops for a bit . 
  i saw two guys endlessly feeding \u00a5 100s into a machine in an attempt to get a maki plushie out ( she would n't budge - her head was too big ) , so i walked around and found my own at [ this shop ] ( https://goo.gl/maps/4renhaspz8b2 ) ( \u30a8\u30c3\u30af\u30b9 ) for a reasonable \u00a5 3000 . 
  sega does give you a special bag if you manage to beat their machines , though ... 
  the shrine itself is out of the way from the main akihabara `` strip '' , which means it 's pretty peaceful . 
  they were selling some sort of merchandise there , but i could n't work it out . 
  maybe you 'll have better luck ? 
  and you should try to track down some of [ these ] ( http://imgur.com/syap35u ) in convenience stores !, 
  they 're packets of sweets that come with a little random * \u03bc * 's member . 
  have a great time !, 
  tokyo is such an awesome city . 
  huh , i always wondered where stan 's stubble ended . 
  it always just disappeared behind his glasses . 
  the mods ( and most users ) here forget that eu exists a lot of the time . 
  if you want a change made to the subreddit , [ message the moderators directly ] ( https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2fsplatoon ) . 
  this is truly hallowed ground !, 
  i 'm on team cat , and i 've been doing a * lot * of waiting around for team dog to show up . 
  cats are definitely more popular this time around . 
  i can sympathise , because i 've been in the position of the moderator who takes responsibility for everything too . 
  do n't worry , no one 's angry at you personally . 
  if you guys ca n't quite handle stuff as it is due to other commitments , maybe it would be best to recruit a few new moderators to spread the workload ? 
  ( perhaps from eu , so the region is less likely to be forgotten ? ), 
  splatfest ends in an hour , but it 'll be an hour after that before the results are announced . 
  i prefer the eu translation solely because it does n't have spyke speaking in an awful faux-cockney accent . 
  instead , he 's just creepy . 
   yellow had control of both zones for awhile, 
  no they did n't , their score is still 100 . 
  yellow had control for less than a second , then blue reclaimed it . 
  this resulted in the +1 penalty for yellow , even though they still had 100 points . 
  no , he 's just referencing the fact that the world is ending . 
  here are a few i found quickly :, 
  i 'm from london , so this just makes me cringe lol . 
   i assume this is because they have to translate dialogue into more languages than noa . 
  na and europe used to share noa 's english translation , until [ the mario party 8 scandal ] ( http://www.engadget.com/2007/07/16/uk-mario-party-crashed-for-spastic-reasons/ ) where the american translation team did n't realise `` spastic '' is considered an offensive word in the uk . 
  since then , nintendo has had two english translations for a lot of their games , one for na and one for eu . 
  removed for being off-topic, 
  and you need to be level 20 . 
  it was n't very nice . 
  i 'm not kidding !, 
  [ these little guys ] ( http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2775/4447720977_54eb1b5545.jpg ) look like tasty morsels of delicious squid meat , when in fact they 're nasty bags of squid guts that explode when you bite into them . 
  would not recommend . 
  ( can you tell i 'm a callie fan ? ), 
  the bow tie detail is too much of a coincidence . 
  bill = shermie ... ? 
  no , that 's jelonzo . 
  i think `` jerry '' is the name the developers give the jellyfish . 
  it 's probably meant to be `` jelly '' , but japanese people often mix up their l 's and r 's . 
  i 've heard mixed things - some people say it does n't affect you at all , some people say it shows you 've really researched the country and have thought about what you 're getting into . 
  just whatever you do , do n't write `` tokyo '' . 
  premiere seems pretty sensitive to glitches - it wo n't open most of the images i 've glitched ( even gently ) , so i tend to just take a screenshot of my image and import that instead . 
  i do n't want this, 
  post removed for two reasons :, 
  this is n't really gf-related . 
  please , do n't take sneaky photos of people . 
  it 's creepy . 
  one person quoting stan does n't really count as leaking, 
  to the japanese people 's credit , today they * really * want to remain a peaceful nation . 
  for some , it 's a source of national pride that they 've overcome such a terrible history to become so war-free today . 
  recent changes to legislation that would allow their military to fight overseas spurred [ huge protests ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/16/japanese-anti-war-protesters-challenge-shinzo-abe ) all over the country . 
  the constitution stated that the japanese military ( which is called the self defence force ) could not fight on foreign soil , which meant it was very strictly defensive . 
  the legislation change i mentioned has allowed for a `` reinterpretation '' of the constitution , which allows the military to move more freely . 
  [ this is the wikipedia article on it ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/article_9_of_the_japanese_constitution ) , although it 's a little outdated now .
