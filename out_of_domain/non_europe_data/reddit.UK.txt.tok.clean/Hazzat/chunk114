  i never knew how much i needed tentacle pigtails . 
  ^ ( you should share this with / r/lovelive too ), 
  i 'd like to point out that in the uk film and tv world , the baftas are a * big deal * . 
  this is a huge honour . 
  ` continuity-free ' does n't mean ` outside the canon ' . 
  when alex used it to describe roadside attraction , he meant that it would n't move along the overarching narrative . 
  then you 'll love / r/ramen .

  [ here 's a list ] ( http://www.lovelive-anime.jp/worldwide/news.php ) of cinemas it 's showing in outside of japan . 
  maybe you can track it down to somewhere near you . 
  throughout the lore , the inklings are portrayed as hedonistic party-lovers , while the octarians are diligent hard workers . 
  there 's nothing more to it than that . 
  we have a [ discussion thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/gravityfalls/comments/3pgdo0/gravity_falls_legend_of_the_gnome_gemulets/ ) pinned to the top of the subreddit , you can go there to see what people think .

  more points to be won , and fewer to be lost . 
  i 'd much rather play in an s-rank lobby than a b-rank . 
  i 've had some similarly crushing losing streaks , and i did n't want to return to splatoon until i told myself `` dude , it 's just a game . 
  your rank means literally nothing , it does n't matter if you win or lose . '', 
  i went back into ranked without a care ( and ended up doing pretty well ) . 
  i found fukuoka is n't actually that great for sightseeing . 
  it can be worth tracking down the [ yatai food stalls ] ( http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e4803.html ) to try the famous hakata ramen because it 's so tasty , but there is n't much else to do . 
  if you want a city to explore , i 'd recommend nagasaki instead .

  you ca n't really revise what you just learned in genki using wanikani ( not that i 'm trying to insult wanikani , it 's great ) . 
  for genki vocab specifically , you 're better off with an anki deck that covers things chapter by chapter . 
  there used to be a great series of anki decks called genki annihilation which did just this , but it disappeared from the anki site for some reason . 
  the community here [ tried to piece it back together ] ( https://redd.it/1p07qk ) , so maybe you can use what they found .

  thank you !, 
  we are actually experimenting with stuff . 
  however , it 's become more difficult since the wave of weirdness hit and all our hands turned into crab claws . 
  the idea is that you 'll use their new emoji ( ) whenever you see bullying online . 
  i think it 's meant to be a bit creepy , to freak bullies out . 
  it 's mentioned at the start of the grammar section ( p. 107 ) that \u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059 and \u3044\u307e\u3059 use \u306b instead of \u3067 for place description * .
