  yeah , i want to laugh at this but the scene is so emotional that i ca n't . 
  c'mon , this is just petty . 
  you cut out an image from the show and want your name attached whenever someone posts it anywhere ? 
  that 's unreasonable . 
  also , this is the internet where sharing stuff is the name of the game .

  i think the best thing you could do is set the thread 's suggested comment sort to ` new ' - that way the newest questions show up at the top for everyone by default and they 're more likely to be answered . 
  good god that 's adorable . 
  everyone 's a winner in splatfest because everyone gets sea snails . 
  the difference between the number you get for winning/losing is n't that huge . 
  this has been discussed a lot before , and it 's a bad idea because there 's more to sealing a win in turf war than covering turf/getting splats . 
  getting a few crucial splats , placing beakons in a good place , surviving long enough to be superjumped to , landing a disruptor that gives your team the upper hand ... 
  there are so many ways you can be the true mvp that are n't measurable by statistics .

  reading all the japanese names is something interesting to do on the waiting screen if you 're tired of squid jump .

  for anyone who 's interested , [ this ] ( http://us-japanfam.weebly.com/uploads/4/6/8/5/4685666/2511152_orig.gif ) is all you 've got ta memorise .

  the guys who run the sub are volunteers who are doing their best . 
  i agree the moderation here is n't perfect ( they could really do with a few more mods ) but there 's no need to be so demanding . 
  you do n't have to * demand * , just ask . 
  and if the moderators do n't want to add new members to their team , that sucks but it 's their community so they can do what they want . 
  the best thing you can do is send them a ( polite ) [ moderator mail ] ( https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2fsplatoon ) to remind them or get a status update .

  in the weapon testing area you can switch weapons as much as you like , so you can place lots of different subweapons at once . 
  for some reason , there have been very few europe - or uk-centric squads founded .

  the [ wikipedia article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/y_wladfa ) has a very detailed history . 
   the idea of a welsh colony in south america was put forward by professor michael d. jones , a welsh nationalist non-conformist preacher based in bala who had called for a new `` little wales beyond wales '' .

  as / u/spez said :, 
   right , upvoted is really aimed at non-redditors . 
  the goal is to show more people all the cool stuff that happens on reddit every day , and hopefully bring more people into our communities . 
  i think as far as clickbait sites go , upvoted is actually pretty good . 
  the content is n't nearly as vapid or dumb as most similar sites , and credit is always given where it 's due . 
  and if you do n't like it , you do n't have to give it the time of day . 
  reddit itself is n't going anywhere . 
  extra time is the best mechanic and i love it to bits . 
  it means you can not rest until the whistle has blown and games are hectic and tense up to the very last moment . 
  even if you have a comfortable lead , you have to be on edge because there 's a chance you could have it snatched away , and if you 're losing it means you can never get defeatist because there 's always a chance you can turn it around . 
  the final minute of ranked battles would be far less interesting without it . 
  oh , and i would remove lag .
