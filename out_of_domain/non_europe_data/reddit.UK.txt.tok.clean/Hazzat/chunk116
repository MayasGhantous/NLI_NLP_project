  there are still tons of people playing , the community is buzzing and there will no doubt be a huge new wave of players after christmas . 
  you wo n't regret getting splatoon . 
  / u/catjaz63 is the one who 's working on it and has written all the secret code messages lately . 
  maybe there 's been a lot of pestering sent their way . 
  i 've been thinking about making a `` state of the subreddit '' post where we can talk about the community here . 
  overall people are pretty cool , but when it comes to meta-posts ( posts about the subreddit itself ) they can be a bit unforgiving . 
  it 's [ a real word ] ( http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/meta-?s=t ) that means you 're talking about something `` above '' the topic at hand ( in an abstract way ) . 
  so in reddit context , meta posts are ones that talk about / r/gravityfalls , rather than gravity falls . 
  there 's a whole community of meta-subreddits dedicated to discussing subreddits , listed in the sidebar of / r/metahub . 
  just ... keep rolling . 
  i 've been playing since launch day , i 've spent every sea snail and at least 1 million coins and spyke has only given me one perfect roll . 
  either save scum , or hope you get lucky . 
  if i had to guess , i 'd say paris is a likely candidate for the next round of expos . 
  there have already been a whole bunch of smaller miku events there ( the end opera etc. ), 
  so crypton is clearly very fond of the place . 
  [ here 's the full video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pczsu40rbrg ) if you want more detail . 
  if you 're looking for splatoon-like music , [ anamanaguchi ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ep1mczaq3zo ) sounds uncannily like abxy/chirpy chips ( the in-game chiptune band ) . 
  the theme sounds like [ shonen knife ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=astky3mmdvi ) and the squid sisters ' music is similar to [ capsule ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syj0_dufxbk ) and [ kyary pamyu pamyu ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzc4hfk5p3g ) . 
  live vicariously through / r/bestofreports . 
  gon na need some love live !, 
  in there . 
  thank you for your service .

  when revising remembering the kanji , is it better to go kanji -  key word , or key word -  kanji ? 
  i 've been using the [ nihongoshark deck ] ( https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1956010956 ) ( which is kanji -  key word ) simply because it was at the top of the list of decks , but i 've reached the point in the book where heisig says `` you must go keyword -  kanji ! '', 
  and now i 'm confused . 
  writing is pretty important to me , so i 'll go find a new deck and get it up to speed . 
  thanks for the advice . 
  they 're in piedmont , california , which is where the pines family lives . 
  high five for being a fellow undefeated splatfest champion !, 
  every song by the divine comedy is beautifully lyrical , with a wicked tongue-in-cheek humour that could only be british . 
  i 've listened to every album countless times , because i always discover a bit of wordplay i missed before . 
  [ national express ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3nvpoedkek ) is their best-known song ( which is takes on a whole new meaning if you interpret it as being about the nhs ... ), 
   i honestly just rolled 24 times and with no triples . 
  i 've blown all my snails i got ever ( and a lot of coins ) and only rolled one triple . 
  it could be much worse . 
  there are four episodes of season 2 left . 
  remember when g&w was first revealed and people freaked out because they thought * everyone * would buy three copies of him and he 'd become the rarest amiibo of all ? 
  good times . 
  removed - this is what pms are for . 
  [ ] ( #puppetdipper ) [ this teaser has way more in it . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/mevlq1mcr8s ), 
  * do n't bring drugs . 
  * do n't bring swords . 
  ( the full list of things you ca n't bring is [ here ] ( http://www.customs.go.jp/english/summary/passenger.htm ) - it 's common sense stuff . ), 
  * you 'll have to write the address of where you 're staying on your first night on the disembarkation card they give you on the plane , but they wo n't enquire any further . 
  and you definitely wo n't be the only person they 've met who is couch surfing or travelling in some other unorthodox way , so if you do get randomly selected for further questioning ( very unlikely ) they wo n't be surprised . 
  honestly , do n't fret over it . 
  you 're going to have a great time . 
  you 'll definitely want to research that first . 
  there 's [ a discussion here ] ( https://redd.it/2j7vh5 ) with some mixed messages , so it may be worth contacting the nearest embassy to ask them for clear answers . 
  [ ] ( #fordmad `` if i could move , i 'd punch you in the eyeball . '' ), 
  except for , like , all the smash bros ones . 
  you fell for [ the fake account ] ( https://twitter.com/nintendoamerlca ) . 
  octolings are not happening . 
  lol, 
  yes , it 's doable . 
  the walk from the station is ~ 15 mins and you can do the castle in an hour or less . 
  just keep an eye on the time . 
  matsumoto is a beautiful city , in the middle of a valley with mountains on all sides . 
  it 's definitely worth squeezing in . 
  also , it 's pronounced `` hunnah '' . 
  the [ official facebook post ] ( https://www.facebook.com/hatsunemikuofficialpage/photos/a.10150152350510637.401640.10150149727825637/10156322505815637/?type=3 ) made it clear they have n't forgotten about the rest of the world . 
  do n't worry , i have total confidence that she 'll come to europe eventually . 
  get all your friends to sign up to mikubook , because that 's what they use to work out where the vocaloid fans are . 
   a smaller miku concert happening in london this month, 
  tell me more . 
  i ca n't find any info on this ... 
  no no no removed, 
  [ sweeeet . 
  ] ( http://hyperjapan.co.uk/latest-news/christmas/ia/ ) i 'll see if i can make it . 
  joaje is not okay, 
  we already have / r/joaje though . 
  just stop, 
  i am this -  < - close to setting automoderator up to insta-remove any posts or comments that mention the j-word . 
  for some reason it really got out of hand over the past few days . 
  i disagree - many wii u games seem to be looking to strike the perfect balance of being easy to just pick up and play , but with serious strategic depth if you care to dig deeper . 
  sm4sh and splatoon are great examples of this . 
  now i feel bad for letting him die on his second battle . 
  if you 're talking about the number of visitors , you can see [ those stats ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/gravityfalls/about/traffic/ ) yourself . 
  i think the overall quality of content definitely dropped though . 
  there are other great fan artists out there , guys !, 
  you can post their work too !, 
  we do n't know , no details have been revealed yet . 
  the game has n't even been officially announced . 
  we know gfc has connections at disney , but their actual methods remain a secret . 
  hey , it 's like / r/eflcomics, 
  complaining about it wo n't change anything - if you want better-quality content , lead by example and start posting it . 
  go to [tumblr.com/tagged/gravity-falls] ( https://www.tumblr.com/tagged/gravity-falls ), 
  scroll until you find cool fan art, 
  post it, 
  internet points !!!, 
  keep track of good artists and post their stuff before anyone else for a guaranteed steady supply of sweet reddit karma . 
  did i not just make [ a big ol' post ] ( https://redd.it/3sj2jz ) saying that people should make less posts like these  . , 
  i 'm referring to what i wrote about meta posts - if you want to discuss the subreddit itself making a post like this is not the best way to do it . 
  i swear sakurai has an infinite improbability drive hidden under his desk that he presses when it 's smash update time . 
  this is something i was against for a long time because i thought it was needless clutter , but i can see now how it would help to keep the subreddit more orderly . 
  we 'll definitely consider it . 
  [ here 's a whole video .
