  we have n't actually banned it yet . 
  the regular slosher is an ink hog , so it 's worth having ink efficiency or ink recovery to counter it . 
  run speed up is worth it too , so you can keep the ink-spreading going . 
  for tri-slosher , i 've had huge success after stacking special charge up . 
  the bubbler combined with the tri-slosher 's very quick kill time is so great for diving into the thick of it and turning the tide of battle , especially in splat zones . 
  that alone managed to finally push me up to s-rank . 
  have ... have i started a cult ? 
  hint : it was passed through more than one cipher . 
  starting now . 
  we wo n't punish people for not following a rule that did n't exist . 
  i 'd rather not explain exactly how it works , because then people would find it really easy to circumvent . 
  no regrets . 
  s\u00fcs . 
  maybe that was intended , but we know that soos is actually just short for j\u00e9sus . 
  every time someone made a joaje reference , my aim got better . 
  at last , it got good enough . 
  you did n't enable flair selection , so no one besides you can pick a flair . 
  it 's not your fault . 
  it 's what everyone did to you . 
  it did , the other mods keep reinstating everything it removes though  :(, 
  uh , that 's las vegas and it 's [ a real building ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/luxor_las_vegas ) . 
  just use the report button , that 's what it 's there for . 
  as much as i appreciate the compliment , please read [ what i wrote ] ( https://redd.it/3sj2jz ) about meta posts like this . 
  i 've banned it from / r/gravityfalls for a while . 
  some people are mad , most people are grateful . 
  that 's a. . . weirdly specific request . 
  there are plenty of tv show subreddits that have remained active after the show ends ( / r/lost , / r/firefly , / r/breakingbad etc. ) . 
  the community wo n't just drop dead the day the final episode airs . 
  special duration up is that brand 's favoured ability . 
  you 'll be re-rolling for a while ... 
  it just gets quietly automatically removed . 
  you only get in trouble if you try to deliberately get around the auto filter . 
  it 'll come back when the time is right . 
  posts like this make it clear that the time is not yet right . 
  i removed this post , please stay on topic . 
  bill is not here .

  [ for those who do n't get the reference ... ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sharaku ), 
  if you 're playing this tactic , comeback  run/swim speed up . 
  it gives you a bigger boost , and will probably never run out if you 're dying all the time . 
  i remember being * super * creeped out by the dare video when it was released . 
  i could n't stop thinking about how weird it was for weeks . 
  the fact it was such a bold image that i never forgot is the reason i came back to rediscover gorillaz years later . 
  the way to use a normal shooter is to shoot for a bit , swim for a bit , shoot for a bit , swim for a bit ... with the nozzlenose , you can be much more selective about when you 're actually shooting ink , letting you duck and dodge like no one else . 
  the mobility options are absolutely unparalleled . 
  a lot of people try it and give up because they were treating it like a splattershot and spamming zr to try to get as much ink out as possible . 
  the right way to use it is to find its rhythm , and play with the timing of your shots so you can be sure every ink blob counts . 
  the whole 3-shot thing means you know exactly how long you 'll be shooting for and allows for flexibility in how you move , and makes this the most fun and satisfying weapon to use ( imo ) . 
  i 'm a big fan of the l-3 , if you ca n't tell . 
  awesome video . 
  it was eye-opening to see just how quickly you can sketch out a complete story as long as the poses are strong . 
  i 'd like to think we 're getting there . 
  your people await . 
  this video is incredible . 
  all we know is that weirdmageddon will have more than two parts . 
  we do n't know whether it will last until the end of the season . 
  gear abilities only matter as long as you remember to take advantage of them . 
  work out the play style you want to go with and plan appropriately . 
  that said , damage up wo n't do much to improve your tri-slosher as it 's always such a safe 2-shot splat . 
  then you should have asked for feedback on that setup instead , 
  post removed, 
  resubmit it without the `` aim '' joke and you 'll be fine . 
  temporary , but we do n't know how temporary .

  i 'm not even mad, 
  i 'm still holding out for a second one . 
  she 's my favourite smasher and i really wanted her amiibo , but her face is so derpy and her hands are so fat that i ca n't bring myself to buy her . 
  [ ] ( #eyeroll ) man , you need to learn how to cut to the chase . 
  no one wants to sit through over a minute of rambling before you get to the actual content ...

  the debate really died down after the game released and people realised it 's plenty fun without voice chat . 
  ign stoked the fires recently when they revised their splatoon review and listed `` no voice chat '' as the only negative . 
  we chose to enforce this because people asked for it - a huge percentage of posts made to the sub were just lazy jokes . 
  there 's plenty of other stuff we can share and discuss instead . 
  if you miss them , you can go to / r/joaje - they 'll always be there . 
  we just need some time to breathe . 
  that 's because if you do that , the bot just immediately removed your comment and no harm is done ( no one else can see the comment ) . 
  you only get in trouble if you deliberately try to get around the filter . 
   it 's even on the banner, 
  no it 's not, 
  removed for being off-topic, 
  people have been trying since the moment the ban started , but i think before long they 'll realise that getting banned and having your comments removed before anyone can see what you 've done is n't very fun . 
  things i never needed to hear :, 
  * this, 
  reading a subreddit spammed with the same joke is even less fun !,
