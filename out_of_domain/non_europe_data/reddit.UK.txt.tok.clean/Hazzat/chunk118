  ( thanks to the people who reported this ), 
  removed due to aim joke, 
   hahaha ... was that too crude ? 
  good god yes . 
   gravity falls is everything that modern cartoons are n't today, 
  really ? 
  there are tons of great cartoons out there right now . 
  every time you dodge the filter like this , it gives me another word/phrase to add to it , 
  that 's a fair request !, 
  i think i added the exemption now , but i ca n't really be sure because i do n't understand automoderator . 
  we 're meant to be setting a good example, 
  hahaha , i get it . 
   but maki best girl \u2665, 
  [ ai n't that the truth . 
  this is awesome , please please tell us the source . 
  it 's tricky to get to , because you have to slowly walk over the netting to get there . 
  when you get to that point , it 's more satisfying to just cross the gap , head towards the spawn and start splatting people . 
  it depends , do you feel lucky ? 
  if you 've got the snails/cash to burn and a piece of gear you want to improve , it can be worth re-rolling at least until you get two matching sub-abilities again . 
  i 'm in !, 
  removed for being off-topic, 
  alex tweeted this guy 's first video out ages ago , he found it hilarious . 
  do n't send tvc messages or give them attention . 
  he is crazy and no amount of telling him to stop will change his mind . 
  i have no power here !, 
  i am contractually obliged to remove this . 
  electric boogaloo is n't actually a title , it 's just [ a weird reference ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/breakin%27_2:_electric_boogaloo ) . 
  as someone who used to make stop-motion films but is now studying how to make cg animations ... that episode really stung . 
  yes , although i do n't think it 'll necessarily be a multiplayer shooter . 
  in interviews , the developers said `` the inklings can do more than just shoot ink '' , so i think they 're brimming with ideas for splatoon franchise games in other styles . 
   its horrible that the prices in eu are so fucking expensive, 
  oh god yes . 
  i ca n't justify actually spending money on this game when a pack of 11 virtual cards is so much more than an equivalent pack of irl trading cards . 
  i 'm happy just tapping circles to * \u03bc * 's songs . 
  [ you 're too slow ] ( https://redd.it/3thw3y ), 
  removed, 
  at the end of [ bill 's ama ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/gravityfalls/comments/315yoy/im_bill_cipher_i_know_lots_of_things_ask_me/ ) he asked us all to draw him wherever we can , because each one is a little window for him to view our world ... 
  do you have any idea how long it took me to remove every single one of these comments, 
  you guys are the worst, 
  brad breeck is the composer of all the music in gf . 
  [ he 's been posting it all on soundcloud recently ] ( https://soundcloud.com/bradbreeck ) , although he does n't really have disney 's permission to do so . 
  the mod who made a lot of the glitchy edits to the subreddit walked out today over some of the recent policy changes , and they reverted a lot of their edits just before they left . 
  this is why bill is back in the top-left too . 
  [ ] ( #bipper ) mabel 's back for now , but it may not be forever ... 
  i 'm not banned here !, 
  the banning spree was because i was a bit po 'd at having to remove 100-odd joaje-referencing comments . 
  i 've unbanned people who were involved and ( seriously ) apologised . 
  the trick with splatlings is remembering that you do n't always have to charge it up all the way . 
  the hydra takes ages to charge , but it still fires for a long time if you only charge it up half way . 
  [ nope lol . 
  ] ( http://tvline.com/2015/11/20/gravity-falls-cancelled-disney-xd/ ), 
  there are plenty of tv show subreddits that stay active long after the show has ended . 
  / r/thelastairbender , / r/lost , / r/deathnote , / r/breakingbad , / r/firefly ... 
  the comments were all individual letters , like this :, 
  the bot just scans for a few words and phrases that i put in . 
  it ca n't read a whole comment chain . 
  they went for the * full * quote . 
  no , but they got all the way through to the word `` because '' before i jumped in . 
  i already handed out temporary bans to everyone involved , and repeat offenders would face harsher punishment . 
  the rule against joaje wo n't be forever though . 
  removed because this is just a link to the youtube homepage . 
  you may enjoy / r/ducktective . 
  you failed, 
  they 're just silly taglines people made for the hypothetical splat tim game series . 
  removed because off-topic, 
  nope , there 's an episode tomorrow followed by a break before the finale `` in 2016 '' . 
  it 's gon na be one helluva wait . 
  stay tuned to / r/gravityfalls for updates . 
  i study 3d animation , and one of my lecturers was on the dev team for this game . 
  rumour has it that his face is on one of the bad guys . 
  you spelled it wrong - you wrote ` [ ] ( #nighenry ) ` . 
  littlest pet shop . 
  it gained a small but dedicated following because it was made largely by the same team that made mlp . 
  [ here 's the playlist ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a9plkfa79u&amp;list=plz1jutrxlxhiyyzeu-m02r64too01sspt ) for anyone interested . 
  [ and if you want one for yourself ... ] ( http://nonnontv.com/goods/others/?goods=fashion ), 
  you guys are never satisfied , are you ? 
  aww , we did n't get the chance to solve it ourselves :(, 
  removed because off-topic, 
  / u/kawaiiwaffle pointed out that there 's an annotation that leads to [ one more episode ] ( https://youtu.be/cbylcj7rqxi ) . 
  it does n't look like there are any codes in it , so i guess this is the end of the line . 
  ^ ( edit : grammar ), 
  last * and * final ? 
  listen here you little baka , yazawa nico is the greatest school idol the world has ever seen and your smack-talk ai n't gon na change that, 
  it 's not , although / u/gravityfallscipher who runs it * is * all-knowing . 
  for the uninitiated , the bafta awards ( british academy of film and television arts - and yes they cover games too ) are a big deal here in the uk . 
  this is a huge honour for the splatoon team . 
  it wo n't - we 've already heard [ the shortened weirdmageddon theme ] ( https://soundcloud.com/bradbreeck/gravity-falls-e220-gravity-falls-main-theme-alternate-bills-mix ) on brad breeck 's soundcloud , which will almost certainly open the next episode . 
  removed - this is just an eye of providence , not bill . 
  you have to click through to [ the hobbystock site ] ( http://www.hobbystock.jp/item/view/hso-ccg-00001399 ) - it 's \u00a5 3,780 . 
  [ that too . 
   ] ( http://awards.bafta.org/award/2015/childrens/international ), 
  the first jrpg i ever completed . 
  the middle part was a slog , but the [ credits music ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-jdz_d9px0 ) made up for it . 
  * zero escape : virtue 's last reward *, 
  i asked for this on a whim and had no idea what to expect , and found myself blown away by this amazing story that kept throwing new twists when i did n't think there could be any more . 
  one of my most memorable gaming experiences ever . 
  i 'm s-rank , baby . 
  follow the [ list of cryptograms ] ( http://gravityfalls.wikia.com/wiki/list_of_cryptograms ) as you go ( but do n't read ahead ) . 
  there 's foreshadowing from the very start , and you 're only getting half the story without knowing the secret messages . 
  do n't watch it if you do n't want to , but trust us when we say there are some serious twists thrown in there .
