  if it 's not blowing your mind yet , be safe in the knowledge that it will if you stick around to the end of season 1 . 
  i 'd never even heard of the original , which is part of the reason this game was such a big surprise . 
  the third game is [ more than just a rumour ... ] ( http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-07-06-zero-escape-3-confirmed-for-vita-and-3ds ), 
   far bigger scene, 
  but ... 
  the game sold more copies in na than it did in japan ( never mind na and eu combined ) ... 
  they 're all in the sidebar . 
  any gaps in the table are just placeholders for future additions . 
  existence is suffering, 
  the ultimate mystery of gravity falls is `` why * is * this place so weird ? '', 
  i think that will be the last question answered , and it will tie up a lot of the loose ends you mentioned here . 
  i do n't think the spaceship is still a chekhov 's gun . 
  we saw it used already , so it does n't need to appear again . 
  however , it does point towards the ultimate mystery of gravity falls : why * is * this place so weird ? 
  i think that will be the last question answered , and the aliens will be part of it . 
  the parallels to the show itself are what make it so great .

  we 'd love to have any ( or all ! ), 
  of the staff come and visit for a last hurrah . 
  send them your tweets !, 
  you should - there are only two episodes left ever !, 
  you can definitely catch up before the finale airs sometime next year . 
  the old design caused controversy in some countries because it was too similar to the [ shriners ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shriners ) logo , so it was retconned .

  previously when we posted it as soon as the episode ended , it gets flooded with random stuff because hype levels are so high . 
  it will appear soon , we just want to let everyone calm down first . 
  get a nice high-quality pic of him and it 's a done deal . 
  bonus points if you cut him out nicely and resize to 70x70px . 
  also removed because spoiler in the title, 
  but not yet , come back tomorrow, 
  get a nice high-quality pic of him and it 's a done deal . 
  bonus points if you cut him out neatly and resize to 70x70px . 
  he 's still in the vents . 
  that 's not good , he 's on the bill wheel !, 
  we probably need him !, 
  thanks,

  do n't get too hung up on the vocab - it 's hard to commit a word to memory just by drilling it . 
  the best times i 've had with genki are when i drill the new words with flashcards for a bit , then go to the exercises and see them used in context . 
  they become much more memorable that way . 
  while it 's not genki-specific , i 've found [ delvin language ] ( http://delvinlanguage.com/ ) can take the dryness out of the vocabulary grind . 
  the n5 group covers a lot of genki stuff , and it 's more rewarding to find yourself understanding actual japanese rather than mary and takeshi speaking very slowly for you .

  oh , [ we saw him ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mbqb6mg.jpg ) alright . 
  i tweeted a japanese music artist i like , and was excited to receive a tweet back . 
  however , i 'm a little confused about what she said :, 
  most of it is pretty simple , but i do n't understand the third sentence . 
  what is \u65b9 , and how is it being used here ? 
  i did some research and have n't found any clear answers . 
  i think i like xyler and craz . 
  oh , so she said something to the effect of `` wow , you 're british ! '' ? 
  thank you for your help ,

  i 'm the one who updates the sidebar info - i got it off [ this report ] ( http://tvline.com/2015/11/20/gravity-falls-cancelled-disney-xd/ ) . 
  maybe if you tweet her nicely she 'll send you a bigger version . 
  i 'm a member of bbc3 's target demographic , and i 'm much more likely to watch something online than i am on tv . 
  this is a good move . 
  what is being foreshadowed here ? 
  but the final episode is in 2016 !, 
  removed because this is n't even remotely a joke, 
  ~ 550 characters into rtk1 and i just realised the anki deck i was using is for the old edition of the book and there are 50 kanji that were left out of my reviews . 
  is there an easy way to start over , or am i gon na have to spend a week teaching a new deck with ones i do/don ' t know ? 
  i 'm not so convinced about [ the penguins ] ( http://i.imgur.com/2tfbf9g.png ) - club penguin ones have [ joined eyes and no legs ] ( http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/clubpenguin/images/9/9c/blue_create_penguin.png ) . 
  it was n't a reference . 
  scram !, 
  do n't browse here until you 're all caught up !, 
  yes , aoshima is a reference to john aoshima . 
  the book is edition 6 , the deck was edition 5 . 
  i just looked into adding the missing 50 ( plus the 140 missing ones coming up ) , and it does n't look like there 's a log of them anywhere , so it looks like i 'm gon na have to suck it up and start from the beginning . 
  thanks for the suggestion ,
