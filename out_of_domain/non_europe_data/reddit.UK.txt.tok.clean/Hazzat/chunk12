  ( very very gross , definitely nsfw ), 
  the regular one or the plus version ? 
  the regular one should work fine .

  he stroked seth 's bling . 
  you might want to take a look at / r/colors3d . 
  this is n't a combined gif . 
  it 's just a gif ... 
  do you need a wiiremoteplus to play those games or will wiimotionplus attachments be fine ? 
  get yourself [ betterponymotes ] ( http://rainbow.mlas1.us/ ) ( which has a huuge library of pony emotes ) or [ my reddit ponies ] ( http://userstyles.org/styles/49858/my-reddit-ponies ) ( which has just the ones from / r/mylittlepony ) . 
  this happens because of the new way zombie textures are handled . 
  they 're done differently now because of zombie villagers . 
  phwoar , that 's some / r/ladyboners material right there . 
  he made the famous minimalist mane 6 wallpapers , including [ the rainbow dash one ] ( http://megasweet.deviantart.com/gallery/?offset=24#/d47erhd ) which has been used * everywhere * .

  take a gander at [minecraftfurniture.net ] ( http://www.minecraftfurniture.net ) \u201a there 's some wonderful examples there . 
  not only that , but they have an entire server dedicated just to good furnishing . 
  it 's fun to take a trip there with a group of friends and learn about building together . 
  [ ] ( / cadance ) do n't link to funnyjunk .

  alex s. did remix it so he 's not totally wrong !, 
  i still prefer the original though . 
  oh come on , it has n't looked like that since alpha . 
  [ ] ( / louder `` tag your spoilers ! '' ), 
  [ ] ( / ajhappy ) you learned a little lesson in friendship . 
  you 've , uh , kinda picked the wrong link flair there . 
  [ ] ( / absmile ) by checking each other 's reddit flairs , of course !, 
  there 's the [ little blocks mod ] ( http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/730795 - ) , but it 's still on 1.3.2 . 
  [ it 's okay to not like things ... ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0la5dbtovni ), 
  that 's what i think he was trying to say . 
  redownloading the game from minecraft.net wo n't do anything . 
  you need to click options  force update before you log in . 
  our server had that plugin for a while but we removed it after too many people found themselves accidentally sitting in their stairs when they were building . 
  in particular , if you 're building a roof out of stairs you 're probably going to be holding down shift to make sure you do n't fall off . 
  i got 'em all !, 
  it 's one of those games where you need to keep replaying each level so you can mark out a route in your head and do a flawless run . 
  compared to other eshop games i 've bought , it 's had the best longevity for that fact alone .
