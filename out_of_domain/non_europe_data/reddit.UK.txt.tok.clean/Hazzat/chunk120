  i watched some let 's - plays and thought it was pretty mediocre , but eh whatever . 
  it was n't easy - dipper was alone and had to use every bit of his willpower and emotional attachment to mabel to break the spell on her . 
  it was a diabolical plan by bill , but he underestimated the bond between the twins . 
  bill is now busy trying to escape the bubble , which is how the gang slipped back to the shack unnoticed . 
  the odds are still stacked against them , but now we 've seen the real power of the pines family spirit it looks like they may have a chance . 
  if you want to contact moderators , [ messaging them directly ] ( https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2fiwantout ) is far more effective than just leaving a comment somewhere and hope they see it . 
  amazing !, 
  it 's a shame it was so easy to guess without finding this clue . 
  regarding learning words vs. learning readings , there 's [ a nice bit in the faq about it ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/learnjapanese/wiki/faq/beginnerquestions#wiki_should_i_learn_all_the_readings_for_each_kanji_that_i_study.3f ) :, 
   let 's say you 're learning english . 
   how would you go about learning how to read the symbol `` 1 '' ? 
  would you from the very beginning , learn `` the character ' 1 ' can be read as ` one ' or as ` fir ' or as ` teen ' . 
  the character ' 2 ' can be read as ` two ' or as ` seco ' or as ` half ' or as ` twenty ' . '' ? 
   you 'd probably agree that 's a bad way to go about learning how to read numbers , and that it 's probably better to learn that the following ways of writing words out have the following readings :, 
    1 - one, 
    1st - first, 
    10 - ten, 
    15 - fifteen, 
    2 - two, 
    2nd - second, 
    25 - twenty five, 
    1/2 - one half, 
   japanese is very similar to how the numbers are treated above . 
  the same symbol can be read in different ways ( usually 2 , but often more ) . 
  but at the end of the day , what 's important is how to read the entire word that the symbol appears in , not `` the possible readings of a given symbol '' . 
  nah it wo n't happen . 
  he 's the queen 's son , and next in line to the english throne . 
  yeah , i agree . 
  [ yes , it 's orange . 
  she 's my favourite smasher and i was super excited for her amiibo , but i ca n't look past the derpy face and meaty man hands . 
  that 's no amiibo ... 
  the difference is that the sloshing machine ink explodes at the end of its arc . 
  this means you can still get splats if you suck at aiming ( like me ) . 
  it was on rainmaker yesterday . 
  you 've just been unlucky . 
  yes , until you hit level 10 the only way to level up is to play turf war . 
  after that you unlock the ranked game modes where you play with others of your skill level , and there 's more exp rewarded for winning . 
  i guess it 's less of a poll and more a way to just let people announce that they 're interested .

  it roughly means `` you only get one chance '' , but it 's hard to nail a concrete meaning in english because japanese phrasing leaves out a lot of detail . 
  word-for-word it reads `` as for ` chance ' , one time end '' . 
  do n't need it , do n't want it .
