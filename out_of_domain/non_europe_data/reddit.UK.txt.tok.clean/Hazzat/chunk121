  there have been more recent posts , you just ca n't find them because we removed them . 
  automod is n't so smart that it can detect when someone posts a bill cipher question . 
  [ but ] ( https://redd.it/3vcxq6 ), 
  [ hey , maybe you 're right !, 
  well , we knew it was coming . 
  it 's been fun \u03bc 's , i 'll be here to the end .

  me and nolan north *, 
  the theme is normally announced on saturday , a week in advance . 
  so chances are we can expect it tomorrow . 
  you might want to [ link to the announcement ] ( https://twitter.com/nintendouk/status/673094794688774144 ) in the post because i had to do a double-take too . 
  i wonder when people around here will stop getting salty over splatfest themes and realise that what the theme is does n't actually matter . 
  there have n't been any bad themes . 
   what if you do n't like pizza ? 
  pick your favourite colour ? 
  calle or marie ? 
  flip a coin ? 
  it 's just an excuse to play splatoon . 
  no , they only ship to japan !, 
  there are websites like [ tenso ] ( http://www.tenso.com ) that can forward it on to you . 
  i just bought the poster and am going to have it forwarded , although i was warned that it wo n't actually ship until march . 
  this summer was really the summer of love live ! . 
  with the movie out , game centres and otaku shops were going crazy with their promotional materials for it and the hype was at its peak . 
  by 2017 \u03bc 's will be long finished and while i 'm sure there will still be merchandise around if you look for it , you wo n't find big displays dedicated to them , walls covered in birthday wishes or anything like that . 
  if you want to ride a hype wave , you 'll need to keep an eye out for what 's popular just before you go !, 
  [ ] ( #notimpressed ) i thought you were better than this,

  but his brother is a failure !, 
  his brother is a failure !, 
  see , it 's funny because your career prospects are terrible . 
  [ yep , fezzes are for sale .

  the question was n't `` which do you prefer '' , it was `` which would you rather visit '' which i think is a pretty interesting question , 
  post removed - the bill cipher ama was nearly a year ago now . 
  also do n't post your email publicly on reddit . 
  i do n't get sentimental much , but ... 
  the last few years have been pretty crummy for me . 
  my friends and i had kinda drifted apart ( they lived quite far away , were taking different courses etc. 
  ) , i ended up horrifically lonely most of the time and started slowly spiralling into depression . 
  last year was especially bad as it was my first year of uni and the workload was so great that i had no choice but to stay hidden in a dark room until deadlines were hit . 
  the mental place i was in was so horrible . 
  over the summer , i found love live !, 
  thanks to / r/awwnime . 
  i liked it a lot , but then i got to spend two weeks in japan , found it was everywhere and * really * got into it . 
  i bought the merch , [ visited the shrine ] ( http://imgur.com/a/yyqo9 ) , saw the movie ... a combination of \u03bc 's '' * ganbatte !, 
  * '' attitude and the unbelievable kindness and generosity expressed to me by the japanese people i met meant that when i got back , the world did n't seem like such a dark place anymore . 
  for that , i 'll always be grateful to \u03bc 's . 
  it 's right to end the project now , but they 'll forever have a place in my heart . 
  [ yes , this is true .

  removed because low-effort, 
  the joaje wave was ages ago , anyway . 
  the love live store does n't have a `` payment on delivery '' option , so that 's not something you need to worry about in this case . 
  just use a credit/debit card and you should be fine . 
  i do n't know , this is my first time using one too !, 
  they offer a [ price estimator ] ( http://www.tenso.com/en/estimate/ ) but without knowing the details of any of the items it 's hard to guess what it would actually come to . 
  as it 's based on weight , if you 're buying the poster i guess it wo n't be much . 
  my uk card went through okay . 
  fyi , you were shadowbanned from reddit so no one can see your comments besides you . 
  go to / r/shadowban for more information,

  / u/tuckyd is organising it , ask them . 
  [ bleh , close enough . 
  splatoon thrives on its simplicity , that would complicate things too much . 
  come join us in / r/futurefunk !, 
  there 's very little official splatoon merchandise , and even less available outside of japan . 
  you 'll have to make your own ... 
  there 's no strict schedule , but they 're roughly every three weeks and always start on a saturday . 
  yep , they 're announced a week in advance in-game by callie and marie , as well as on social media : [ twitter ] ( https://twitter.com/splatoonna ) , [ tumblr ] ( http://splatoonus.tumblr.com/ ) . 
  splatoon 's look was heavily inspired by tokyo youth culture . 
  inkopolis plaza is very clearly based on shibuya crossing in tokyo , which is a popular district among young people , and if you search for images of `` shibuya fashion '' you should instantly recognise the influence it had on the game . 
  booyah base ( the shopping area in the plaza ) looks uncannily like shibuya 109 and inkopolis tower is based on real-world tokyo tower , which is an icon of the city . 
  as for similiar-looking games , jet set radio and the world ends with you also looked to shibuya for art direction .

  oh my god, 
  the rainmaker is a * [ shachihoko ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shachihoko ) * . 
  it 's believed that these * shachi * can summon the rain , which is why the game mode is called rainmaker . 
  are n't they all like that ? 
  the article is being a bit sensationalist to get you to click on it . 
  weirdmageddon iii * will * be the last episode of gravity falls , but there might be other stuff that spins off it like journal 3 . 
  / u/trendingbot is but a poor robot , forgive its transgression . 
  amiibo dojo 's [ lucina training guide ] ( http://amiibodojo.com/2015/09/20/lucina/ ) talks a bit about how they differ . 
  in general marth is a stronger fighter , but it really depends on what you want your amiibo to do for you . 
  this art style is gorgeous . 
  i love this grimier take on the game . 
  it looks even worse now lol . 
  just put two line breaks between each one . 
  it * is * the second-highest level ...

  you are completely wrong , most of these misguided questions come from people who do n't understand how reddit works and signed up just to ask something . 
  / r/mylittlepony has had five seasons ' worth of episodes to build up their emote supply , whereas we 've only had two . 
  also mlp 's more crazy cartoony style means there are lots more emote-worthy faces - in gf things generally stay pretty on-model . 
  we did have a bunch more in the past , but when there are too many emotes and many of them are useless , the whole system becomes hard to use . 
  it becomes hard to pick one that will suit your post when there 's so much clutter . 
  my attempts at random wandering did n't turn out that well - because the city is so huge , a lot of it is just residential or offices . 
  a good approach would be to find an interesting neighbourhood ( say , [ shimokita ] ( http://www.jnto.go.jp/eng/location/regional/tokyo/shimokita.html ) ) and start exploring from there . 
  that way you 're guaranteed to see something cool at least . 
  oh yeah , we only have room for so many tables .
