  although i 'm sure if we wanted to squeeze in even more we could find a solution . 
  [ ] ( / bookz ), 
  yes, 
  my favourite chiptune album/ep ever . 
  it takes me to another world . 
  it 's worth keeping up with [ slime girls ' twitter ] ( https://twitter.com/slimegirls ) as they post new stuff randomly . 
  you mean [ like this ] ( http://40.media.tumblr.com/d4b6783a5eb5c6e1c31fc4a6f0c0e0a1/tumblr_nwuw894qcb1sqv60so1_1280.png ) ? 
  the real question is , what do * you * like ? 
  whatever genres you 're into , you 'll find it in japanese too . 
  try / r/japanesemusic as a starting point . 
  wow , you were n't kidding . 
  i 'll have to look into them more . 
  stop . 
  removed, 
  yes , but we do n't really want `` even more '' . 
  that would n't be nice , given that it 's someone else 's artwork .

  tenso provided [ a guide ] ( http://www.tenso.com/en/guide/buy/index.html ) on what to put in each box . 
  when it asked for my name it had boxes for both kanji and furigana , so i put katakana in both . 
  you wo n't be able to ship to an address outside of japan though !, 
  i think it might be mine too . 
  i avoid tower control not because i dislike it , but because i 'm awful at it . 
  seriously my win rate is like 0 % . 
  removed for being off-topic - please read the off-topic guide on [ the submit page ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/gravityfalls/submit ) . 
  there 's definitely slowdown when things get particle-heavy like when there 's a number of bomb rushes/inkstrikes/inkzookas going on at once . 
  it 's just to be expected , really . 
  japanese people * love * their cute phone accessories . 
  looks like they 're only available in capsule toy machines in yodobashi camera shops in japan for now . 
  i 'd keep an eye on ( or contact ) japanese merchandise resellers like amiami to see if they pop up there . 
  our next splatfest starts tomorrow !, 
  skype is my favourite splatoon character . 
  removed for being very off-topic, 
  if you like inkstrikes , yeah . 
  ( i do n't really like inkstrikes though . ), 
  try eating yoshi and you 'll see how weird kirby with a tongue is . 
  it starts at 6pm gmt . 
  cry, 
  removed for being off-topic, 
  thanks , i do what i can . 
  i found myself on an amazing team delicious - if you 're any of [ these guys ] ( http://imgur.com/5xyyqcz ) let it be known that your contributions are appreciated !, 
  also wow , the zink mini splatling is * amazing * for turf war . 
  you called it !, 
  on that day , the stans received a grim reminder : we live in fear of the nostalgia critics and are disgraced to live in these cages we call cartoons . 
  i had a lot of success with the zink mini splatling . 
  it 's was built to own turf war . 
  removed for being one of the most absurdly off-topic things i 've ever seen, 
  it is !, 
  this is my first splatfest loss . 
  i guess the streak had to end someday . 
  removed, 
   squid yuri, 
  okay, 
  a whole bag of them ? 
  there 's no source , so do n't believe a word . 
  [ ] ( #toomuch ) they 're not tears !, 
  it 's the jalape\u00f1o peppers !, 
  [ we got a manga though . 
  ] ( https://kantopia.wordpress.com/2015/05/18/corocoro-splatoon-manga-translated-full/ ), 
  it just wanted to save you from the embarrassment of having spelled `` naughty '' wrong . 
  [ here 's a countdown .

  only some small things have been leaked , so do n't freak out . 
  we do n't know who any new characters are ( or if there will be new ones at all ) . 
  dude this question gets asked here every day , try searching the subreddit or [ read the wiki ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/3ds/wiki/recommendations ), 
  removed for being off-topic . 
  the number is n't accurate , reddit has just been having server issues this past 24 hours . 
   hears vocaloid and starts crying, 
  too relatable ; _ ;, 
  fe : a spoilers : so does robin . 
  it 's not that we do n't like corrin - we just have n't even met him/her yet . 
  no , it 's officially licensed . 
  lol , the name of the top player on the other team translates to `` roller paradise '' . 
  i guess they 're buying the splat roller the moment they unlock it ... 
  wow !, 
  i wonder if they 'll be performing in hologram form ( vocaloid style ) or if they 'll get the voice actors out to sing and dance . 
  keeping the smash team around is expensive and takes time away from them potentially working on other games . 
  the hype train has to reach its final destination at some point . 
  it 's just one way to turn the tables if you 've lost control of the battle . 
  you have a lot of other options : dodges , warps ( palutena , zelda , sheik ) , a quick grab ... 
   the gif must be more than merely relevant ; that is , the gif must contain more than one relevant element ( person , action , object , facial expression , metaphor , etc. ), 
  it 's a response to people saying `` what '' , but the relevance stops there . 
  you ca n't game splatfest - team anti-pineapple just won despite its 62 % popularity . 
  just do n't take it seriously and have some fun . 
  please leave,

  keep joaje in / r/joaje, 
  squid sisters + 2pac collab . 
  let 's make it happen . 
  splatooneu is a fake account . 
  [ nintendoeurope ] ( https://twitter.com/nintendoeurope ) is where official announcements come from . 
  there are some things that should remain * unseen * . 
  how many more joaje posts by you am i going to have to remove before you stop posting them ? 
  removed - off-topic, 
  matchmaking 's priority is to get you in a game as fast as possible ( which i really like ) . 
  and once you 're in a lobby , the teams are just random . 
  turf war is n't meant to be fair necessarily , which is why it does n't put a big focus on matching you with others your level . 
  it 's just meant to be a fun 3-minute blast of action . 
  if you lose , the fast matchmaking will make sure you 're dropped straight into a new match when it 's over . 
  yep , i 'd place my bets on that too . 
  for one thing , it means no one has to sing live in inkling language .
