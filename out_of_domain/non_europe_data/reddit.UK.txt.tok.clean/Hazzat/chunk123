  i just wondered if it would be voice actors after seeing how the live shows for the anime ` love live ! ', 
  work : [ voice actresses performing up front in cosplay ] ( http://youtu.be/arol2m7pdyk ) while clips of the characters performing the same thing play in the background . 
  none of these [ leaked ] things you 're posting were actually leaked .

  niiiice !, 
  was this modelled only in maya or did you use a sculpting program ? 
  i do n't think you know what trolling is ... 
  generally speaking yes , but it 's flexible and there 's also some hand-picked curation that goes with it . 
  there are a couple of reasons they implemented this system :, 
  * to encourage weapon diversity - if all the maps were available at once the best choice would be to pick the best all-rounder weapon . 
  * in development , the expectation was that the game would sell very few copies . 
  if the player base was very small and you could choose the map you wanted to play on , the players would be spread too thinly and matchmaking would take ages . 
  tbh i do n't think it 's a big deal , all the maps are fun to play on . 
  that 's a funny-looking tri-slosher . 
  they put the wrong picture up , that 's the rapid blaster pro deco . 
  i think this one is actually me irl . 
  earlier this year i spent a week in tokyo visiting a bunch of different tv and film companies . 
  on one of the days i visited an office that looked just like this one , and for a little while the place ground to a halt because people wanted to come and talk to me . 
  this image just gave me an uncanny flashback . 
  beautiful , beautiful , beautiful . 
  basic art skills . 
  the ability to draw anything you can see to a fair degree of accuracy does n't take long to learn at all . 
  i found that when i did , a whole world of opportunities opened to me . 
  it 's like learning your abcs - once you do it , there are so many things you can create and experience that you could n't before . 
  not intentionally !, 
  i do n't mean to come off as if i 'm bragging , this is just something that happened . 
  / r/letsplay, 
  the bigball one was the sloshing machine , yeah . 
  [ here are the remaining unreleased weapons . 
  ] ( https://nwplayer123.github.io/splatoon/upcoming/ ) there are no totally new ones , only new loadouts .

  do n't be a jerk, 
  it wo n't be happening !, 
  these drawings are ... not good . 
  there 's a reason you get heavily downvoted whenever you post them , and it 's because the proportions are all off and the style is messy . 
  i think you need to take a step back and learn the basics of how to draw characters . 
  the name of the game is * construction * , construction , construction . 
  you ca n't start by drawing the details - you need to draw everything underneath it first . 
  look at [ a tutorial ] ( http://www.easydrawingtutorials.com/index.php/misc/243-draw-mabel-pines ) on how to draw a gf character . 
  see how it starts off very very simple . 
  the drawing starts as just a circle and a rectangle , and gradually we build on top of that until we have a nicely proportioned , appealing mabel . 
  by working in this way , we can be sure that our final drawing is recognisable and nice to look at . 
  keep working at it , but do n't be afraid to look at tutorials or ask for help . 
  if you just doodle on your own , you 'll end up making the same mistakes over and over . 
  why would you do that, 
  what the squid did you just squidding say about me , you little octoling ? 
  i 'll have you know i graduated top of my class in the hero agents , and i 've been involved in numerous secret raids on octarian bases , and i have over 300 confirmed splats . 
  i am trained in ninja squid warfare and i 'm the top charge-shot in the entire inkopolis armed forces . 
  you are nothing to me but just another inky target . 
  i will splat you the squid out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this earth , mark my squidding words . 
  you think you can get away with saying that shrimp to me over the internet ? 
  think again , octoling . 
  as we speak i am contacting my secret network of spy agents across inkopolis and your inkdentifier is being ink railed right now so you better prepare for the inkstrike , squee-g . 
  the inkstrike that wipes out the pathetic little squirt you call your ink . 
  you 're squidding splatted , kid . 
  i can be anywhere , anytime , and i can splat you in over seven hundred ways , and that 's just with my bare tentacles . 
  not only am i extensively trained in tentacle combat , but i have access to the entire arsenal of the ammo knights and i will use it to its full level 20 extent to splat your miserable ink off the face of the continent , you little squid . 
  if only you could have known what unzap-fishy retribution your little `` clever '' comment was about to bring down upon you , maybe you would have held your squidding tentacles . 
  but you could n't , you did n't , and now you 're paying the price , you squidding octoling . 
  i will shrimp bomb rush fury all over you and you will splat in it . 
  you 're squidding dead , shrimp . 
  you can say it 's bad without being a jerk , [ like this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/gravityfalls/comments/3xgnbk/here_is_a_redraw/cy4hpj2?context=3 ) . 
  it 's never helpful to just say `` this sucks '' . 
  one of the key themes of gravity falls is that growing up is hard . 
  as you learn more about yourself and the world , it becomes more difficult to stay true to the person you 've always been . 
  the people around you change too , and you might naturally drift apart . 
  but the strongest relationships are ones that survive this transition , relationships so special and important that they ca n't be torn apart . 
  dipper and mabel have one of those relationships , and their greatest challenge is to make sure they do n't lose it . 
  if the game ca n't find you a team naughty to battle against , it 'll pair you up with a team nice so you 're not stuck waiting in a lobby for ages . 
  ( and vice versa . ), 
  neither am i. , 
  these are incredible !, 
  they 're popular in japan because many homes do n't have proper insulation or central heating . 
  it can be a lovely social event to have all the family gather round the kotatsu in the cold winter evenings . 
  this was one of the big clues that pointed to grunkle stan having a twin brother . 
  looking back , it seems so obvious now . 
  you got ta have more dlc : that 's the to more amiibo . 
  do n't make me change my mind,

  you 're not there yet , keep focussing on proportion and construction . 
  yep , this was one of the clues that pointed towards stan having a twin brother .

  [ ] ( #happymabel ) grappling hook !, 
  ( seriously , would n't it be cool to have a grappling hook ? 
  think of all the things onto which you could grapple ! ), 
  i always find it super cute when i go up against a player called `` mummy '' or `` daddy '' .

  psg is * fantastic * . 
  easily among my favourite animated shows ever . 
  you ca n't use it with splatoon . 
  single player can only be played with the gamepad , and in battle dojo player 2 can only use a classic controller , classic controller pro or pro controller . 
  sorry to disappoint , but there are n't many active ones besides this one . 
  if there were , we 'd definitely have a proper list in the sidebar or the subreddit wiki . 
  please do not do this .

  do you think you could slow down with all this fan art you 're posting ?
