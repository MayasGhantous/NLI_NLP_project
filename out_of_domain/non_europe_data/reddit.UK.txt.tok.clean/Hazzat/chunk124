  it 's nice to share , but it 's not nice to be so spammy with it . 
  [ he does this . 
  if you 're going to ask for help , do n't phrase it as if you 're doing someone else a favour . 
  that just sounds arrogant . 
  yep , these are probably the [ ` pocalypse preppin ' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=plqu1kokjapsb0te44xqcthalj5plmwfp8 ) shorts . 
  splats are n't everything . 
  it only gets worse once you hit s. , 
  before anyone goes and follows this account , be aware that @splatooneu is not official or run by nintendo . 
  the only official announcements for europe come from [ nintendoeurope ] ( http://twitter.com/nintendoeurope ) and [ nintendouk ] ( http://twitter.com/nintendouk ) . 
  they might have been playing in octo valley ... 
  my brush rules :, 
  holding zr and painting a line is only worth it if you * need * to get somewhere fast . 
  use it to escape enemy ink when you 're in a tight spot or to charge over to an area of the map where you 're desperately needed , but do n't try to use it to capture turf . 
  when you 're capturing turf ( which is most of the time ) , you should swim -  jump -  spam zr -  land and swim forwards -  repeat . 
  the brushes can grab a lot of turf very quickly when you get this pattern down , especially on maps with big open areas ( eg kelp dome ) . 
  do n't try to splat people from the front , as they will always have more range than you . 
  use your speed options to flank them and attack from the side or behind before they know what hit them . 
  multiple copies of the same ability are affected by diminishing returns : your second run speed up wo n't increase your speed as much as your first etc. 
  as for whether you want to stack abilities , it 's up to whether you feel you need more of a certain ability . 
  ask yourself while playing if there 's anything holding you back that you think different abilities could deal with . 
  and she loves you . 
  this makes me want to put all my level 1 gear on again and try to blend in . 
  just use the report button !, 
  the cg crowds in the movie with their super-awkward walking is pretty unforgivable though . 
  removed for being off-topic, 
  this was only one of the most important clues back when the `` stan 's twin '' theory was just a theory ... 
  post removed - the bill cipher ama ended 9 months ago . 
  it costs a lot of money to have the splatoon dev team sitting around , and there comes a point where it no longer makes financial sense to keep them working on new content . 
  nintendo needed to strike a balance between stuffing the game full of new stuff and keeping the game profitable - that 's the real reason the updates are ending , it just does n't sound so nice if you bring it up in an otherwise positive interview . 
  similar shooters can roll out updates for years thanks to dlc and microtransactions , but splatoon 's simple and inclusive attitude ( which i think is quite refreshing ) means that 's not an option . 
  [ nice username . 
  ] ( http://24.media.tumblr.com/0793279c543b6113471fcacf4f51bd0a/tumblr_mq07scftz01qcuyndo1_500.gif ), 
  in contrast to what everyone else is saying , the turf on your side is * very important * and you will benefit a lot by taking the time to capture it at the start of the game . 
  doing so will mean :, 
  your special gets charged up early on . 
  if the game goes badly , your team has somewhere safe to fall back to and regroup . 
  if the game goes well , you do n't have to worry about your own side and can just focus on humiliating the enemy . 
  even if you get splatted , you can rush straight back in and keep putting on the pressure . 
  it 's actually best to have some team members ink the base while others charge ahead , but because you ca n't coordinate that you need to watch what your teammates are doing and work out what role you should be playing . 
  bring on the [ bagger 288 ] ( http://www.lakata.org/arch/bagger288.jpg ) . 
  ( or should that be squidbagger ? ), 
  keep track of the opponents where possible . 
  obviously you ca n't know exactly where they all are at any given time ( unless echolocator is up ) , but you should have a general idea about which end of the map they 're in . 
  ideally you want to keep them all in front of you down their end , so you should be vigilant : check all the paths they could slip through , watch the map to see where they 're spreading ink and prioritise splatting anyone who has managed to get behind you to avoid being flanked . 
  well , they also spent the last few decades building up a brand big enough to get 50 million plays . 
  ca n't get upvotes if the post gets removed . 
  to save you the trouble , here 's the list ( taken from [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/splatoon/about/stylesheet ) ) :,

  side note , i always hate how whenever a subreddit implements this there are tons of posts about it and they all get super upvoted . 
  just stay on topic , we 're here to talk about splatoon , not / r/splatoon . 
  mine too , i watched it recently because i love gainax 's other stuff . 
  it may be short , but every episode is just golden and the soundtrack is kickass . 
  all the way back [ in the splatoon direct ] ( https://youtu.be/kqszpyb0vmw?t=26m10s ) , they showed five starting maps , three upcoming ones and six yet-to-be-revealed ones , so we 've always known that 14 maps was the plan . 
  `` nice ! '', 
  ( literally * naisu * ) . 
  it 's what they say instead of `` booyah ! '', 
  we do n't actually blanket-remove joaje anymore , just dumb super memey stuff . 
  i like to think people appreciate not having the / r/gravityfalls front page filled up with that . 
  if you have suggestions , you should [ message the moderators ] ( https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2fsplatoon ) !, 
  nope , we 're only getting an official journal 3 . 
  i did try redesigning the subreddit to look more weirdmageddon-y , but i could n't come up with something nice .
