  if you were to ` shop out the edge of the train window in the top right , this could be a very atmospheric photo . 
  this is amazing !, 
  youtube used to have a `` most recent '' list which i loved , but it was removed long ago . 
  that looks pretty good !, 
  the only thing is that even the most die-hard nerds might find it hard to fill an entire day in akihabara , but you might still be recovering from jet lag at that point anyway ... 
  as for your free days , you could use your rail pass to make a couple of [ day trips ] ( http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3950.html ) ( scroll down ) to elsewhere in kansai , or start to make your way back to tokyo stopping off at places on the shinkansen line ( hakone , yokohama ) . 
  gravity falls : [ all growed up ] ( http://youtu.be/e1m0h19xghw ) . 
  the n-zap 's best feature is its very focussed fire combined with its range . 
  it takes 4 shots to splat ( unlike the aerospray 's 5 ) and because all your shots are straight in front of you ( unlike the aerospray , which has a wide spread ) you can guarantee you 'll quickly take down anyone you choose to target . 
  the '85 is an absolute search-and-destroy machine , with the echolocator letting you track down the targets and splat bombs to help you kite them around . 
  i never really saw the appeal in the ' 89 . 
  why put off learning either ? 
  look over the first column of katakana , then return to practise it in between expanding your vocabulary . 
  it 's not so complicated that you need to dedicate a whole study session to memorising it . 
  i would n't hold out hope for pixar - minions has beaten out every pixar film . 
  it 's the second-highest grossing animated film ever after frozen . 
  last year i made some animations for the yogscast , and this guy 's story has really made me appreciate how nice it was to work with them . 
  i was n't paid a huge amount , but they honoured every part of our agreement and were always easy to communicate with . 
  what i 'm trying to say is that syndicate has no excuse when other big youtubers can handle it so well . 
  i 've listened to this so many times . 
  i love it so much . 
  [ these lego animations !, 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=plxr7qhekokzqeytqoja1lyxgx70arupde ), 
  glad to hear you like them !, 
  it was just a set amount of money . 
  apparently they used to split the ad revenue with guest video-makers , but keeping track of how much each video had made and paying the right people every month was too much admin work . 
  probably . 
  we do n't know .

  is it not fun because you 're losing a lot , or because you just do n't feel like you know what you 're doing even when you are winning ? 
  why did you post a picture of text ? 
  that depends what you think it is . 
  this is just a copypaste of something written three years ago . 
  the information is likely outdated . 
  the same can be said of designing mario kart tracks . 
  i do n't deny that creating a new smash character is a lot of work , but mk8 's dlc is certainly much better value . 
  the amiibo stuff was n't dlc , it 's on the disc and has been since day one . 
  back when splatoon was still young , yahtzee of zero punctuation wrote an article called [ should games arbitrarily withhold content ? 
  ] ( http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/video-games/columns/extra-punctuation/14125-splatoon-should-let-you-play-more-than-two-maps ) , talking about how splatoon 's slow release of content and restrictive map selection is detrimental to the gameplay experience . 
  it 's something i 've been thinking about ever since . 
  in some ways i like the way splatoon has done dlc - new regular content has extended the game 's lifespan , prevented us getting overwhelmed at the start and ( i think ) allowed the game to be larger than if they had everything unlocked on day one . 
  it 's been fun to react along with the community to the new weapons and maps , and to get familiar with each weapon type as they came . 
  but would i want to see this become a trend , with more games choosing to launch in a bare-bones state and time-lock a lot of content , either on a daily schedule or until months later ? 
  i 'd say `` no way '' , but splatoon made it seem okay . 
  i 'm still conflicted .

  nope , lapis 's comment just got caught in reddit 's spam filter .

  you need [ crunchyroll unblocker ] ( https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/crunchyroll-unblocker/dldddkdajilplfikaadakojgjocbnjim ) . 
  i also wish the crunchyroll selection did n't suck so much outside the us . 
  stay off this subreddit , stay off the wiki * , stay out of gf youtube videos and stay out of any other fan communities . 
  go blind until you 're all caught up !, 
  * that said , i recommend following the [ list of cryptograms ] ( http://gravityfalls.wikia.com/wiki/list_of_cryptograms ) as you go - you 're only getting half the story if you 're not reading the secret messages hidden in every episode . 
  just do n't read ahead . 
  ^ ( spoiler-tag that ! ), 
  i had [ bill 's identity ] ( #spoiler ) spoiled for me the episode before the reveal thanks to me being careless on the wiki . 
  absolutely !, 
  up until the end of season 1 , [ we have no idea who bill is , what his name is , or even if he exists . 
  we just see him in the wheel in the title sequence , and in the eyes of providence everywhere . 
  i made the mistake of clicking on the ` bill cipher ' page ... ] ( #spoiler ), 
  the yen is the lowest it 's ever been , making japan a surprisingly affordable place to travel around . 
  if you want to go , go soon !, 
  you should hang out in / r/japantravel , there are lots of people who could use this advice . 
  do n't post stuff like this . 
  i have n't noticed a spyke ( * ahem * ) in them lately , but i always downvote them . 
  that , and `` look , i ranked up ! '', 
  posts . 
  i mean , i 'm happy for you if it happens , but your re-roll/rank-up is no more special than anyone else 's . 
  i 'm very excited to see splatoon become a franchise in its own right . 
  that doctor is such a killjoy .

  so how much lives in the red area ? 
  the model and colours are lovely , but i 'm not so wild about the depth-of-field effect . 
  i really want to look at that house , but the fact that it 's blurry prevents me . 
  that 'll be 30,000 bucks , please . 
  yep , i think you nailed it . 
  in 22 minutes , tourist trapped introduces a little of everything you 'll see in the next two seasons . 
  i do n't think so , given this bit :, 
   hirsch has been pursued by numerous outlets for development projects coming off the success of `` gravity falls , '', 
  alex has had his pick of networks to work with .
