  i 'm sure he would n't choose one that would lock him down . 
  his next show will absolutely get its own subreddit ( and i would be more than happy to run it ) , but i do n't think an / r/alexhirsch is necessary . 
  no , / r/gravityfalls will always be exclusively about gravity falls . 
  any future projects will get their own subreddits . 
  if you got that many splats and still lost , clearly you were n't playing the objective . 
  after the final shot of this episode , i was convinced that by the end of the season all the supernatural things the twins encountered would return . 
  almost all the things they encountered left something behind - the real gobblewonker , wax larry king 's head , dipper clones , the remaining dinosaurs etc. 
  [ ] ( #dipponder ) it could still happen ... 
  make a little post about yourself ( in japanese ) , correct some people 's english and before long you 'll find a whole bunch of people who would be happy to talk to you . 
  did you watch it live ? 
  this episode is so special to me mainly because of the simultaneous incredible , mass freak out everyone had at the end . 
  i know i was going nuts . 
  the target audience for this ( parents of minecraft-loving kids ) has no idea how to pirate stuff though . 
  to me , this comes off as a malicious way to scam ignorant parents . 
  ketchup and seafood must never touch . 
  edit : unless it 's battered, 
  i made [ a lang-8 post ] ( http://lang-8.com/1427866/journals/306079678713044518099090395319894280224 ) yesterday talking about why i started studying japanese . 
  while i understood a lot of of the corrections , i 'm confused about why one person suggested that i make strong use of \u305d\u308c instead of \u3042\u308c , like so :, 
  the reason they gave is that it sounds more natural . 
  why is this ? 
  it 's funny how immediately after this post she put out a splatoon video . 
  * please make a song please make a song *, 
  they have n't announced one yet , but there are `` more details to come '' . 
  / r/flcl, 
  it makes me so happy to see this high up . 
  flcl is a truly kickass show . 
  yeah , but in the future [ you 'll get zapped by the giant time baby ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vmfsivh.png ) . 
  amazing editing work !, 
  when he says stuff like that , i honestly ca n't tell if it 's paid product placement or if he just randomly likes to big up a brand he saw that day . 
  he always says `` apple ciroc : celebrate success right ! '', 
  even though that 's not actually their slogan .

  all splatfest themes are good . 
  eu ones especially . 
  ... or itunes or amazon or anywhere online at all . 
  often the full song is n't even on youtube , only a clip . 
  the music industry out there is still mostly based on physical cds , so anyone without access to a japanese record store is out of luck . 
  his feet are bigger than farquaad , that 's for sure . 
  nuh-uh , it 's come up in a lot of discussions as one of the unsolved meta-mysteries . 
  it looks like it should be from a tale of two stans , but it never appeared there .

  removed - please do n't promote piracy sites here, 
  it will never happen ( at least , not in this game ) . 
  there 's just no way to fit them in that makes sense . 
  my experience is that 's not true at all - saltspray is a challenging balancing game between trying to hold the top area while also inking elsewhere , because you ca n't win with it alone . 
  you could have all four of you keep it defended , but then the other team will just take everywhere else . 
  hey man , [ chiptune + guitar and drums ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svfel9vbfd4 ) can be a killer combo . 
  ami has been making these for four years , long before facerig . 
  she 's just very good at 3d and compositing . 
  how many \u00a5 100s did you sacrifice for these ? 
  hey , it wo n't be long until you can listen to [ both at the same time ] ( http://i.imgur.com/kmgpqyp.jpg ) . 
  she 's very secretive about her workflow and `` real life '' . 
  the closest we got to a behind-the-scenes was ... [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs1vbttzym8 ) . 
   you should look for bartending gigs at local gaijin bars . 
  ... but be aware that many visas forbid this as bars fall under workplaces that `` corrupt public morals '' . 
  it does n't apply to all visas , but it 's a condition on [ the working holiday visa ] ( http://www.uk.emb-japan.go.jp/en/visa/working-holiday.html ) , for example :, 
   and the working holiday participants are strictly prohibited from working at places affecting public morals such as bars , cabarets , nightclubs and etc.

  this is spongebob , not gravity falls . 
  thank you thank you thank you . 
  this show struck such a deep chord with me and i could never put a finger on why . 
  it tackles a subject that touches us all , in such a roundabout , magical way . 
  thank you for helping me understand . 
  removed because as bizarre as this is , we do n't allow nsfw stuff here, 
  i do n't think there 's much more to add to this game , it 's content-packed as it is . 
  i 'd love to see the world and lore explored in more detail in future instalments though . 
  it 's so often the case with gorillaz music that you hate it the first time you hear it , but the more you listen the better it gets . 
  you 're not alone !, 
  these are never trolls , they 're just reddit noobs who signed up today specially to ask a question and do n't know how anything works . 
  these are n't very new , lol, 
  i 've removed your post for not being relatable ( rule 5 ) .
