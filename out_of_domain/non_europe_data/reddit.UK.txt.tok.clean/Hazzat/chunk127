  automoderator is hard enough to program as it is without worrying about weird stuff like that  . , 
  if this is n't possible due to formatting restrictions , separating out the vocabulary and listing it at the start of each section is a neat solution . 
  this is what tae kim does , and it encourages the reader to start pronouncing kanji as they go .

  oh god too real, 
  removed for spoiler in the title . 
  you can resubmit this , just rephrase the title . 
  there will not be any paid dlc for splatoon . 
  removed, 
  is n't this what channel frederator is doing already with bravest warriors and bee & puppycat ? 
  when you 're managing a big team of writers , artists and animators , you ca n't just say `` we do n't really have a plan , just start working on stuff and we 'll see when we feel like ending it . '', 
  a structure is necessary to keep everyone in the know and working together . 
  viewers can find it alienating too if they do n't know what they 're going to get and when . 
  totally unstructured things can work as very small productions ( 1-3 people working on them , maybe ) but the possible scope for storytelling is much smaller .

  we like the su guys , but all content here needs to be gf-related, 
  removed for being off-topic, 
  also it counters defence ups to guarantee you a 2-shot splat on anyone . 
  but there are better ability choices you can make . 
  after the joaje bomb , we decided to rethink the way we deal with memey , off-topic and tangentially-related content . 
  now everything submitted has to have some visible relation to gf . 
  c'mon dude , dealing with trolls 101 : do n't feed them . 
  they do it to get a reaction , so the best thing you can do is shut up and ignore them . 
   does my post not ? 
  no , it 's just a gif of a cool spinny thing . 
  we debated meta posts , and decided to allow them because they 're not very common .

  gaaahhhh , this is so lovely . 
  beautiful work . 
  oh man , they 're doing the vocaloid-style projection thing . 
  they did [ one of the best covers ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eb7tpphic5i ) of the splatoon theme !, 
  i think this method suits the style of the game better . 
  having voice actresses sing and dance [ works ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrycobfz5ti ) when the characters they 're playing are human , but i do n't think it would feel like a splatoon show without the `` actual '' callie and marie up there . 
  also having live performers would mean they 'd need to sing in inklish . 
  the caption in the album ( which i ca n't find now ) explained that many buildings have a pretty fa\u00e7ade , but behind it they look like this . 
  in future , click report or send a modmail * with a link to the post * . 
  that will make sure it gets dealt with quickly . 
  i 'm gon na repost the ones i requested in the last thread because that did n't go anywhere :, 
  also someone wanted [ nico ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4ic52d-fvy ) . 
  ^ ( if you need help adding these i have photoshop and stuff ), 
  never, 
  but the show will be livestreamed on niconico , so you can pretend you 're there . 
  the splatoon koshien ( a nationwide splatoon tournament ) was hosted in cooperation with niconico , so they 're chums with nintendo right now . 
  the final of the koshien will also be taking place at this event .

  splatoon thrives on its simplicity . 
  3 pieces of gear , giving you 3 main abilities and 3 subs on each . 
  it 's neat design , and anything else would complicate things too much . 
  it totally is . 
  the story went that bad luck brian did an ama in / r/iama , but it was removed because he was deemed to not be unique enough ( resulting in what was , at the time , [ the most downvoted comment ever ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/iama/comments/s5guk/iam_bad_luck_brian_ama/c4b8m3u ) ) . 
  it was later revealed that it was fake anyway . 
  the real guy then showed up in / r/adviceanimals and did a successful ama there .

  yeah , [ the terms are the same ] ( https://www.gov.uk/repaying-your-student-loan/when-you-start-and-finish-repaying ) . 
  the only difference is that you only start paying when you 're earning more than # 21,000 / year . 
  then people would complain about wanting shoes . 
  you just ca n't win . 
  i agree totally . 
  i just wan na hear the music . 
  / r/vaporwave has / r/vaporwaveaesthetics exclusively for images . 
  if someone really wants it , we could have a / r/futurefunkaesthetics too . 
  man , it just needed a * woomy * over the swear censoring and it would have been perfect . 
  removed for being memey, 
  no thanks . 
  splatoon 's character designs are meant to be singular and iconic to help cement the look of the new ip , and having one hairstyle for each gender helps with that . 
  also a key part of the character design is that [ inklings , like real squid , have 10 tentacles ] ( http://www.thetanooki.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/141226splatoonanatomy-e1419621345942.jpg ) .
