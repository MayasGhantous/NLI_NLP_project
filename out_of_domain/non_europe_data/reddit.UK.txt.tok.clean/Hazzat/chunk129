  the design was never implemented ( until recently ) because the response was a bit mixed at the time , so i thought no one liked it . 
  after this post i was quietly booted off the mod team and the other moderators brought the theme in themselves . 
  there have n't been any complaints afaik , so i guess people are n't as fussy as i thought . 
  nara is a beautiful place full of deer that you can see in a day , so it 's perfect as a day trip from either kyoto or osaka . 
  7 days spent solely on kyoto might be a bit much , but if you 've got a rail pass it can be a great base to make day trips from . 
  every episode airs much later outside of the us . 
  i 'm in the uk and i have no idea what episode is being aired here next , there just does n't seem to be any point in keeping up with that ... 
  that was no accident , mcgucket was a very deliberate red herring . 
  there was even [ this `` leaked '' image ] ( http://i.imgur.com/m2r4hle.jpg ) which made us think it was certainly him . 
  it was later revealed that [ alex made the image himself ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/b3bzjvoceaetnib.jpg ) just for the sake of confusing everyone . 
  when you have your itinerary , go can go to [ hyperdia ] ( http://www.hyperdia.com/en/ ) and calculate whether it would be cheaper to journey by rail pass or just by buying tickets as you go . 
  chances are the rail pass will be the best option if you go to all those places , and you get the added bonus of flexibility in your plans . 
  i think that alone is worth paying for .

  internationally , the episodes air many many months after they do in the us . 
  i live in the uk too , and it 's not really worth watching the show on tv here .
