  i can only imagine the horror of opening a present on christmas day to find a genuine skull inside . 
  or a rotten zombie head . 
  there 's also [ better ponymotes ] ( http://rainbow.mlas1.us/ ) , which has tons more emotes in it . 
  i think you 're misreading this . 
  i have no doubt that articles are released about minecraft all the time . 
  when google makes these graphs , they point out articles that were released at significant times - namely , at points where there are peaks . 
  install res on her computer beforehand and filter out all those nasty subreddits . 
  and turn the nsfw filter on too . 
  aww , i love doing texture pack stuff . 
  i really miss it , i want the snapshots to come back soon just so i can get back to it !, 
  i do n't want to know the context . 
  it 's more special that way . 
  [ m ] means maybe !, 
  oh , it 's the fad of the week . 
  they come around every now and then and do n't last long . 
  just sit through it until it goes away , or patrol the / new / queue to actually do something about it . 
  i honestly do n't think it 's worth it . 
  youtube is already so oversaturated with minecraft let 's plays it 's unbelievable . 
  if you want to have any hope of gathering a regular viewership , you and your friends will really need to be something special . 
  * really * special . 
  if you 're not bothered about whether people watch or not , go right ahead . 
  but do n't be disappointed when the views do n't roll in ... 
  fireworks , here i come !, 
  they were added in yesterday 's snapshot .

  sounds like [ vanilla with sprinkles ] ( http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1298016-145-vanilla-with-sprinkles-better-blocks-items-fancy-fences-and-more-last-updated-1122/ ) is right up your street . 
  i 'm flattered that you 're using brohoof 's map , but be warned that if you open it in single player or on a server without worldguard , things will start burning , ice will start melting , leaves will start decaying etc. 
  things still burn in peaceful mode !, 
  they do n't show up . 
  you upload your hd skin to a different place , so vanilla players still see the one you put on minecraft.net . 
  catch the meteor with your butt . 
  i used photoshop , yeah . 
  but you can use any image editing software you like ( except mspaint ) . 
  you ca n't use paint because it ca n't save transparency in pngs . 
  ( or , at least , it could n't when i last checked . ), 
  in english , it 's a little complicated . 
  many people assume that the other person/people always come first , but that 's only when you 're talking about `` i '' . 
  when you 're talking about `` me '' , the other person/people are listed after you . 
  you can work out whether it 's an `` i '' or `` me '' sentence by removing everyone else and seeing if it still makes sense . 
  if you 're confused ( and i do n't blame you ) , [ the oxford english dictionary does an excellent job of explaining it ] ( http://oxforddictionaries.com/words/i-or-me ) . 
  i remember being shown this very video in chemistry class !, 
  it was to show us why they were n't about to demonstrate anything more reactive than potassium in the classroom . 
  it 's a running reddit joke . 
  [ the worst ama of all time ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/iama/comments/p9a1v/im_woody_harrelson_ama/ ) was by woody harrelson who would only answer questions about his new film * rampart * . 
  [ this comment in particular ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/iama/comments/p9a1v/im_woody_harrelson_ama/c3nlufk?context=3 ) kind of sums the whole thing up . 
  [ something was bugging me . 
  hopstar listed all the great things about the game itself , but beyond the `` vanilla '' game there 's a whole other universe to be found in mods , multiplayer plugins , custom maps , texture packs ... 
  if ever you find yourself bored just playing in your survival world , it does n't take long to find something community-made to spice up the game for you all over again . 
  that 's what makes minecraft special to me !, 
  this is wrong !, 
  it 's a little complicated , but the creators of the gregorian and mayan calendars were counting the same number of days , just in different ways . 
  [ the ever-informative cgpgrey made a video on the subject .

  whatever they 're doing , it 's working . 
  in 1.4.6 there was a new texture file added called skis.png which looked like skis . 
  many people were wondering what they were for and were expecting them to be added like the christmas chests . 
  this is dinnerbone 's response to people bugging him about that . 
  oof , it 's way too blurry . 
  shallow focus is nice and all , but this goes a bit far and just looks fuzzy . 
  but ... 
  notch has n't worked on minecraft in a long , long time . 
  are you using any other mods ? 
  some mods have been known to mess with the edge on items like that . 
  i 'm finding some irony in someone complaining about a lack of originality when they 've just posted an unaltered and already much-used image macro .
