  yes i get the joke , that does n't make it a gf-related video though . 
  removing a post just removes it from all public lists . 
  no reddit posts are ever actually deleted . 
  i think you 'll need to get the ustream app for that . 
  hello , also removed for being off-topic ,

  nah , it 's a weird combination of a nickname i had when i was 12 and the victory cry people shout in cricket ( `` howzat ! '' ),

  i think you need the ustream app to watch on mobile . 
  [ ] ( #bodyisready ) yes . 
  when the stream starts ( which will be a while before the episode airs ) search for tmogf . 
  i think . 
  that 's from [ the one-off manga that already exists ] ( https://kantopia.wordpress.com/2015/05/18/corocoro-splatoon-manga-translated-full/ ) .

  not sure how you missed it .

  wait , which show are we watching again ? 
  the bill cipher ama ended about 9 months ago . 
  you 're too late . 
  it 's an hour-long episode , so maybe it counts as two parts . 
  you can buy season 1 on amazon , itunes and youtube , but because season 2 is way behind on tv there 's no legal way to keep up with the story . 
  we do n't know . 
  weeks/months from now . 
  on behalf of the people of \\ / r/gf ... * bursts into tears *, 
  it 's okay , [ you can read it here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/gravityfalls/comments/315yoy/im_bill_cipher_i_know_lots_of_things_ask_me/ ) . 
  yes , it 's better to watch it on tv because it 'll be more reliable . 
  it 's gon na be many weeks/months from now .

  [ ] ( #cryofjoy ) thank you , we all did our best . 
  an official discussion thread will be coming in a few minutes when everyone 's cooled down , hold your horses, 
  hey , if it works for / r/summerreddit, 
  the story is over . 
  that was a perfect ending . 
  if this post gets 100 upvotes , this will become a death ball-themed subreddit . 
  i would n't be surprised , but can you show your working ? 
  alex said in between the pines that the twins ' names are similar , so this is totally believable .

  it 's playing again on disney xd right now , and i believe it will be playing one more time after this . 
  literally everyone is making this joke and has been for weeks, 
  what can i say ? 
  weirdmageddon is over . 
  it 's on disney xd again right now .

  * you 're so vain *, 
  * i bet you think this sidebar 's about you ~ *, 
  to be on-topic , the contents of your post have to be directly related to the show ( eg a picture/video of the characters , staff etc. ) . 
  this picture is n't directly related , so we class it as being off-topic . 
  removed for spoiler in the title, 
  some people are theorising that this is a real statue out there somewhere . 
  [ way way back in the early days of the show ] ( http://gravityfalls.wikia.com/wiki/mystery_tour_2013 ) , the show 's staff hid a whole bunch of bill cipher drawings in the oregon woods for fans to find . 
  it 's definitely possible that something similar has happened again . 
  removed for spoiler in the title, 
  i think the finale was just meant to wrap up the story , and the journal 3 book which is coming out later this year will wrap up all the mysteries . 
  kinda like how lost did a bonus mystery-wrapping episode after everyone was confused by its finale . 
  removed for spoiler in the title, 
  it 's removed , you ca n't edit the title of reddit posts . 
  absolutely incredible from beginning to end . 
  i 'm so glad i got to go on this ride , because it 's one i wo n't forget . 
  removed for spoiler in the title, 
  c ` moooon it 's not hard, 
  the journal 3 book is coming out this year which will tie up a lot of the loose ends . 
  removed for spoiler in the title, 
   good for older people, 
  can confirm , i 'm a grandma and i think this show is great .
