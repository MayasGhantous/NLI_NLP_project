  yeah it 's been like that for as long as the theme has existed ( since april ) . 
  uh ... no ? 
  that was never the plan . 
  this is for the community to organise , not me !, 
  i believe the old fez design was retconned because it was too similar to the symbol of the potentially controversial real-life shriners . 
  are n't they on the wrong side of the globe for that ? 
  the writing on the guy 's chest just says * burari * ( \u30d6\u30e9\u30ea ) phonetically . 
  i do n't know what that 's meant to mean . 
  if you want a change of scene , there 's always [ the alternate theme ] ( https://bc.reddit.com/r/gravityfalls/ ) . 
  if we want to commemorate events and stuff , we have the sidebar poster . 
  eh , i do n't think that 's related . 
  the sotbe was fiddleford 's thing . 
  removed for spoiler in the title . 
  maybe we were told it , we just have n't cracked the right code yet ... 
  we had sprint to ` take back the falls ' , we had the reaction/discussion threads where we said thank you and goodbye , we have the poster . 
  is that not enough ? 
  the current header image looks nice , i 'm not going to change it out for an uglier one just for the sake of it . 
  [ ] ( #angrybill ) do you know how long it takes to regenerate one of those things ? 
  goodbye gravity falls,

  it wo n't , there are plenty of tv show subreddits that still get tons of posts and comments every day even though their shows ended years ago . 
  ( / r/lost , / r/firefly , / r/legendofkorra etc. ), 
  goofy , action-packed , an overarching narrative full of mysteries and secrets and a touching story about sibling love . 
  but we still do n't know his real name . . ? 
  removed for spoiler in the title, 
  ok as much as i want this , i 'm actually gon na have to remove this because you 're not allowed to ask people to upvote stuff . 
  also people keep reporting this post . 
  you ca n't edit the title of reddit posts . 
  if the title was `` alex hirsch ama request '' or something functional like that it would have been fine . 
  yep , that would be ok . 
  none of the music is available yet . 
  wait a few weeks/months and brad breeck will put it on his soundcloud . 
  he was wearing a six-fingered glove .

  hey , it 's the [ three-point landing ] ( http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/threepointlanding ) . 
  no , the tree listed all mabel 's crushes and that particular heart said `` mabel + mabel '' . 
  someone just misread one of the early blurry pictures and thought it said `` mabel + abel '' . 
  his name is still a mystery . 
  alex is not here . 
  yes , it 's over . 
  there will be no more episodes of gravity falls . 
  in the summer , there will be an official journal 3 released which should tie up a lot of the loose ends .

  things start getting epic towards the end of season 1 , with the huge finale leading into the even more mystery-driven season 2 . 
  do n't watch it if you 're not enjoying it though . 
  i found the characters to be loveable and authentic right off the bat , which is what drew me in . 
  [ ] ( #tad ) this oversight has forever scarred tad strange . 
  removed - let 's not go encouraging people to visit random houses in oregon . 
  no , because brad breeck has n't uploaded the episode 's soundtrack to anywhere yet . 
  i believe it 's because the ufo crash-landed there millennia ago . 
  yeah , after weirdmageddon 1 everyone was talking about it .

  youtube 's copyright system is largely automated , so it might not have been a person at disney 's doing . 
  [ here 's a picture ] ( http://puu.sh/n9pzn/c58f3fa7b7.png ) ( [ from this post ] ( https://redd.it/461k15 ) . ), 
  uh no because we remove all that stuff here, 
  removed for spoiler in the title . 
  it 's the nights that are the hardest . 
  to me , worlds is the story of humanity 's transcendence from our physical bodies to pure consciousnesses , and what happens afterwards . 
  it starts with ` years of war ' , where there was some kind of conflict . 
  not necessarily a literal war , it could be as abstract as the desire to be free without being chained to physical forms . 
   * take one last look at what you 're leaving behind *, 
   * because there 's no coming back once we go *, 
  the desire was in part spurred on by a love/admiration for artificial intelligence . 
  humanity realised that they would never be able to match/surpass ai 's power without almost becoming it themselves . 
  we get a glimpse at discontent in the relationship in ` fresh static snow ' :, 
   * though i 'll never know your name *, 
   * i 'll cry for you the same *, 
  says the ai , meaning `` i 'll never truly know you unless you change . '', 
  there 's a moment of peace , and the decision to transcend is made - ` natural light ' is the humans enjoying the feeling of the sun on their face for the last time . 
  the actual transcendence happens in ` sea of voices ' :, 
   * we 'll see creation come undone *, 
   * these bones that bound us will be gone *, 
   * we 'll stir our spirits 'til we 're one *, 
   * and soft as shadows we 'll become *, 
  the spirit of humanity leaves to explore the universe . 
  ` goodbye to a world ' is an ai saying a last goodbye to her human friend , as they are entrusted to look after the earth , which has been almost ruined due to either war , or just the human presence .
