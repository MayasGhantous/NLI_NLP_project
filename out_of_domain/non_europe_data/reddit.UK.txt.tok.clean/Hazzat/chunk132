  humanity leaves , and the ai are alone .

  in the world of investing , buying gold is typically thought to be the safest way to store your money as gold will never lose value . 
  it 's a joke that it 's such a safe investment that it 'll keep you going even during the apocalypse . 
  i was expecting `` buy gold '' to be foreshadowing , too , but it seems there was nothing else to it .

  his only orifice is his eye . 
  do n't think too hard about that . 
  you do n't need to spoiler-tag this . 
  we only consider stuff a spoiler for 24 hours after the episode has aired , so this is n't a spoiler anymore . 
  i think so . 
  just going off what i remember , the previous record was set after not what he seems , when i took [ this screenshot ] ( http://i.imgur.com/27doe2m.png ) . 
  after the finale , the ` users here now ' rocketed up to over 4,000 . 
  i got a screenshot of that too , but i do n't have it to hand right now .

  i 'm reluctant , because we do n't even know if anything is happening . 
  we just have the statue and the bus cryptogram .

  could i interest you in [ one of these ] ( http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gravityfalls/images/5/5b/s2e7_memory_erasing_gun_in_box.png ) ? 
  i 'm not sure anyone actually did . 
  i was following the discussion on / co / about it , and there was one guy posting pictures of a forest floor claiming they were on their way to the location , but they did n't actually post anything interesting . 
  / u/toastgobliner said they went to the oregon vortex to check it out , and found nothing .

  you know all that gold you 've been buying ? 
  i 'll take that . 
  i have * a friend * who felt the same as * your friend * , watched the show and liked it very much . 
  definitely worth your time , although she is n't properly introduced until episode 4 . 
  also tell your friend to visit / r/onetrueidol . 
  [ ] ( #disapproval ) you were given one piece of advice for the apocalypse, 
  please do not spam bot requests in the comments section , that 's not what it 's for . 
  that was in the [ cash money ] ( http://youtu.be/jdwhor1h7l4 ) sequence , and the pyramid was there because [ it 's an actual las vegas landmark ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/luxor_las_vegas ) . 
  it was n't foreshadowing .

  i 'm not around much because i look after the european daytime shift , which is when people do n't post as much so there 's less to comment on , and no other mods are around for fun and japes . 
  so i wake up every morning to see everyone had a real great time in modmail without me .

   it 's a series about growing up , yes , but not growing out of who you are . 
  absolutely nailed it . 
  that 's why this is such a special story . 
  no idea . 
  it 's especially confusing because a lot of dental care is free on the nhs . 
  i 've never met anyone with bad teeth . 
  american football fans are very rare in the uk . 
  some sports enthusiasts might tune in , but people who actually follow it are almost non-existent , especially when compared to fans of normal football . 
  not at all . 
  in fact , probably the opposite . 
  if i could choose anywhere , i 'd probably go for york because it 's beautiful . 
  a rise in nationalism around the time of the last general election spurred discussion about whether britain should be in the eu , and it became a talking point for the various parties . 
  the conservatives , the current ruling party , vowed that there would be a referendum on it before their 4 years are up , but it has yet to be scheduled . 
  none that are home-grown , unfortunately .
