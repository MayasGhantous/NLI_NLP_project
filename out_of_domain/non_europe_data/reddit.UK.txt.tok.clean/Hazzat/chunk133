  south park and the seth macfarlane shows are kinda popular . 
  yes , auntie beeb is part of the family and we love her very much . 
  yep . 
  when i first visited the us , one of the first things i saw on tv was a medicine ad with five minutes of horrific-sounding small print after it , and i was truly shocked . 
  the closest thing we have is adverts for private healthcare companies , or small over-the-counter things like headache relief tablets . 
  not anymore , the past decade or two have seen the standard of food in restaurants and pubs raised dramatically . 
  eating out here is great . 
  humility is valued , and there 's no pressure to put on a show . 
  people are at their funniest when they 're honest and frank . 
  yes , but we would n't dare call someone out for breaking the unwritten rules . 
  that would be rude . 
  it 's not true at all , the uk 's dental care is among the best in the world ( and usually ~ ~ free ~ ~ cheap on the nhs ) . 
  whether you can hunt depends on where you are and what you 're hunting . 
  it is possible to acquire a gun for hunting purposes , but it 's a real hassle . 
  very few people do it as a hobby . 
  generally yes , especially as many public places with corridors ( eg train stations ) have ` keep left ' signs . 
  there 's too much to cover , so a few key points are focussed on . 
  i remember being taught in primary school about 1066 , the tudors and wwii in particular . 
  sausages are great . 
  combine them with mashed potatoes and/or the divine nectar that is hp sauce and you 're golden . 
  we do n't , british dental care is among the best in the world and is usually free on the nhs . 
  it 's a very hot issue , with one side shouting `` take our country back '' and the other '' [ refugees welcome ] ( http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03437/arse_3437800b.jpg ) '' . 
  personally , i feel these things are not a threat . 
  too many people misinformed about teeth . 
  yes and yes , although it 's kinda fallen out of fashion over the past few years . 
  `` black british '' would be the technical term used on documents , but it 's not a title many people use to refer to themselves . 
  overall , the game is very well-balanced , although the gals , e-litre and the dynamo roller can be ... infuriating, 
  oooh , do n't mind if i do . 
  people just do nothing, 
  never heard of it . 
  it would n't be british to go causing a fuss . 
  nope , these people claiming my teeth are crooked are the only thing keeping me awake right now .

  british isles = england , scotland , wales , northern ireland , ireland ( and a few tiny little islands ), 
  united kingdom = england , scotland , wales , northern ireland, 
  great britain = england , scotland , wales, 
  we 'll only get mad if you list `` uk '' , `` great britain '' and `` england '' as separate options on a form . 
  this is n't a gf reference , both shows are referencing the real-life statue ( s ) of [ paul bunyan and babe the blue ox ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/paul_bunyan ) .

  let 's dispel once and for all with this fiction that / r/anime _ irl does n't know what it 's doing . 
  it knows exactly what it 's doing . 
  / r/anime _ irl is undertaking a systematic effort to change this subreddit , to make the dank meme posts more like the rest of the reddit 's . 
  removed for being off-topic, 
  many subreddits have been hit with unusually large waves of spam over the past week or so , and there was another huge one ( which was entirely in korean , for some reason ) . 
  we do what we can to clean it up , but things can get messy .

  the date of the mayan apocalypse was the 23rd of december 2012 , but it 's possible they were off my a little . 
  well , the other cartoons that a lot of people here like are :,

  not really , because all we had to go on was the picture and the cryptogram . 
  no one has any idea where to look . 
  my bet is that there 's some other super-hidden clue in the episode that 's been overlooked . 
  either that or we 'll have to wait until journal 3 comes out for the final piece ( s ) of the puzzle . 
  i 'm afraid to say this was pointed out the day the episode aired . 
  it 's a cry for help . 
  he did it just to see if anyone would notice . 
  hey , this is pretty go -,

  they 're just roman numerals , parodying the fact that the superbowl number was in roman numerals until recently . 
  i 've removed this because it 's not gf-related . 
  you should use reference in future - it 's the only way you 'll learn how to get all the right proportions . 
  once you 've done that enough times , you can put the reference images aside and draw accurately from memory .

  the whole point of having the other sub is to keep discord stuff separate, 
  if you actually want to make a difference , go to your nearest disney store and ask if they have gravity falls dvds !,

  if you have a suggestion about how the subreddit should be run , do n't make a post , [ message the moderators ] ( https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2fgravityfalls ) . 
  the subreddit is a central enough location . 
  if a lead shows up , it 'll get upvoted and then we can actually focus efforts on something . 
  i think i went to the same one !, 
  bar at the end of the world ( dernier bar avant la fin du monde ) , right ? 
  i hate everything about this post, 
  the [ google maps reviews ] ( https://goo.gl/maps/8n1je5bcrbr ) for the island are hilarious . 
  is that ... a fire emblem reference ?

  yeah we had to implement rule 7 after those posts spurred too many social media screenshots . 
  they were fine back when those posts were made but it got too much . 
  but reddit is a 13 + website !,
