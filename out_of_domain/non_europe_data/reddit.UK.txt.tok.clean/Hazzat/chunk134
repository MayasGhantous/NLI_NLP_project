   reddit is not directed at people under the age of 13, 
  oh well , it 's only a week away . 
  strictly speaking no , but no one is checking . 
  you 're fine . 
  removed because this ai n't appropriate, 
  now it would be a good idea to pick up a textbook . 
  as you learn vocabulary , you can not only learn how to pronounce each word , but also how to `` spell '' it too ( eg library , [ \u56f3\u66f8\u9928 ] ( #fg '' \u3068\u3057\u3087\u304b\u3093 '' ) , is spelled * map * - * write * - * bldg . * ) . 
  alternatively you could start wanikani to learn the readings , and breeze through it as you 're familiar with the characters already . 
  it 's true that rtk 1 does n't have much practical use , but that 's not the point of it . 
  the idea of it is to bring you onto a level playing field with the kanji so that when you 're actually learning japanese you 're not just looking at random squiggles . 
  it 's only the first step . 
  book . 
  everything . 
  now . 
  everywhere will sell out of everything , so if you still can , book every flight , train ticket and room as soon as possible . 
  all the tourist spots will be absolutely packed , so either be prepared for that and get there early , or aim to plan an `` alternative '' trip where you visit less popular destinations . 
  i accidentally ended up in tokyo during the start of silver week . 
  the shinkansen there was full to the brim and there was n't any accommodation to be found in the whole city . 
  fortunately i was able to find a friend-of-a-friend i could stay with , but without them i would have been in trouble . 
  oh that 's not so bad then , golden week ends on the 5th so you 'll only catch the tail end of it . 
  still there might be a lot of tourists looking to travel then , so it will probably still be necessary to book way in advance . 
  check the [ japan guide ] ( http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2282.html ) page . 
  regarding trains , if a trip to kyoto costs $ 250 it would certainly be better value to get a [ jr pass ] ( http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2361.html ) , which will allow you to go many other places too . 
  rtk does n't actually teach you japanese . 
  it just takes you through every one of the 2,200 jouyou kanji , teaches you how to write it and gives you an * english * keyword to associate it with . 
  when you finish , you 'll be able to recognise every character and it will be much easier to remember how to `` spell '' words as you learn them ( eg [ \u6e29\u6cc9 ] ( #fg '' \u304a\u3093\u305b\u3093 '' ) is `` spelled '' * warm * - * spring * ) but you wo n't have a vocabulary or knowledge of how to actually pronounce anything . 
  in a way it 's similar to learning hiragana and katakana - becoming familiar with the characters is only a first step . 
  it 's just that unlike learning the kana , rtk takes months , not weeks , which is a long time to spend not learning japanese . 
  i would n't say it * sucks * , but it has arguably been surpassed by alternatives like wanikani , kanji learner 's course or kanjidamage . 
  different methods work for different people , so examine your options to work out which would be best for you . 
  ^ ( edit : more alternatives ), 
  a great list !, 
  the one thing i think you missed is that booyah base is the spitting image of shibuya 109 .

  what do you * really * want to do in 2016 ? 
  is there anything you want to be able to look back on at the end of the year and think `` i did that '' ? 
  the azeroth map is cool to look at from a distance , but if you walk around it you 'll see that [ it 's a mess ] ( https://youtu.be/e2126oc6waa?t=513 ) . 
  you can only get the clarity of this los santos model by hand-building . 
  the 2,200 are all the characters taught in school , so they 're assumed knowledge for any japanese reader . 
  it 's true that some are pretty uncommon ( kanjidamage 's no-fuss approach cuts the list down to 1,700 ) but you 'll still need to do a lot of memorising . 
  and even more when you 're learning actual vocabulary . 
  bad memory is no excuse , all the good kanji-learning systems use mnemonics and spaced repetition to make it super easy for anyone . 
  getting a proper textbook and using it to learn grammar and the core vocabulary will put you on a much faster track to actual japanese comprehension . 
  they teach kanji too , but with a slow , stroke-by-stroke method that takes a long time - genki i for example only cover 145 characters . 
  that 's why a lot of people look to alternative methods like rtk . 
  ideally , you should follow both a textbook and a kanji course !, 
  kanji study does n't take a long time , i set aside maybe half an hour every day to reviewing flashcards . 
  eventually the two paths of study will come together and you 'll be stronger for it . 
  the sooner you start either , the sooner they 'll be useable . 
  the genki answer book [ is only \u00a5 800 ( # 5 ) ] ( http://www.cdjapan.co.jp/product/neobk-1030710 ) if you look in the right places . 
  do n't let amazon gouge you on it !, 
  i 'm currently half way through rtk , and while it 's enjoyable i would n't pick it up if i was starting today . 
  the only real benefit it has over other courses is that a large number of people have done it before , meaning there 's a wealth of stories to be found on sites like [ kanji koohii ] ( http://kanji.koohii.com/ ) which takes out a lot of the hard work . 
  as i mentioned earlier , wanikani ( which is an online subscription service ) and the kanji learners course ( which is a normal textbook ) are probably your best bets these days . 
  shop around , read some reviews and find what 's best for you . 
  `` squid research lab special report '' makes this seem like it 'll just be a fun thing on the blog . 
  nothing in-game . 
  that 's ... just a random smudge . 
  google maps pictures are only updated once every few years , so you wo n't find anything by using it at your main search tool .
