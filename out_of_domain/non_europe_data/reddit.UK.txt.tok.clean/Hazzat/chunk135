  here 's the soundtrack for weirdmageddon 3 : [ part 1 ] ( https://soundcloud.com/bradbreeck/gf-e221-weirdmageddon-3-pt-1-full-score ) , [ part 2 ] ( https://soundcloud.com/bradbreeck/gravity-falls-e223-weidmageddon-3-pt2-full-score ) . 
  do you think there 's a possibility for amiibo support in the new games ? 
  now 3dses can do amiibo stuff it would seem silly to not be able to tap them in . 
  the uk direct said `` late 2016 '' . 
  so november/december , probably . 
  fletchling does n't have a thing on its head like this model does . 
  [ definitely not part of the tail . 
  that would be smart , but the environment concept art we did get to see looked distinctly european again . 
  i 'm more intrigued by the whole gang of characters riding in the truck . 
  x/y introduced the idea of having more than just a single rival to adventure with , and i 'd love to see that expanded upon . 
  you can just watch [ the trailer ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmzdl1l3fag ) . 
  they added pok\u00e9mon bank support , so some changes have been made . 
  #the co-ordinates were a fake and completely unrelated lead that were put on the site 3 years ago why wo n't this die, 
  the first pok\u00e9mon games were red and green in japan . 
  red and blue was the international release that came later . 
  the green truck is just called ` pick-up truck ' ( * pikku appu torakku * ) . 
  the pink annotation is about the windscreen wipers . 
  that 's a good observation , and it 's definitely plausible . 
  the writing on the roof of the pok\u00e9mon center just says `` this is glass ! '', 
  so there 's no clue there . 
  well , [ there are toys ] ( http://www.toywiz.com/gravityfalls.html ) and there is [ a video game ] ( http://gravityfalls.wikia.com/wiki/gravity_falls:_legend_of_the_gnome_gemulets ) . 
  but you 're right , there could be a lot more . 
  [ the mew glitch works ] ( http://imgur.com/a/k4cgz ) ( from [ this post ] ( https://redd.it/47or0c ) ) . 
  [ yep ] ( https://youtu.be/de9wjwp8zvs?t=334 ), 
  the blurry shots make it very hard to make it out for anyone who is n't familiar with the language . 
  i managed to transcribe some of it , but it was nothing interesting ( eg the green truck is labelled ` pickup truck ' , the ambulance is ` first aid vehicle ' etc. ), 
  i think it 's just referring to this being the first game where you can transfer in pok\u00e9mon from every generation . 
  because it 's the most popular current console among kids , probably . 
  as with any language , loan words are a big part of japanese . 
  it 's nothing to criticise !, 
  it is secretly . 
  that 's the mystery of / r/gravityfalls . 
  please tell me you realise that 's not a real account ... 
  although that tweet is referencing [ this observation ] ( https://twitter.com/t_tokemaru/status/703236483180695553 ) that the building looks like a hotel in singapore . 
  [ stop reporting this !, 
  you also did [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/uc5t2eg.png ) . 
  yep , what the other guy said . 
  in the future you 'll get plenty of opportunities to practise those basics as you go . 
  that said , the genki textbook is full of exercises that can help you can return to to help drill in what you 've covered . 
  donut stealy, 
  it 's nice to hit s , sure , but every day there 's a post [ of a screenshot like this ] ( https://d3esbfg30x759i.cloudfront.net/ss/wvw69i8l1fgm7fisev ) every day , and it 's just ... not interesting . 
  the subreddit is a place for sharing cool splatoon stuff , and the same screenshot over and over is the opposite of that . 
  great composition !,

  i used to get scared , but then fear turned to anger and anger turned to hate .

  there 's very little slice-of-life . 
  this show - especially the second season - thrives on its overarching narrative . 
  [ ] ( #tad ) who 's this guy ? 
  yes , that 's where the twins live . 
  it 's also where alex hirsch is from . 
  i believe that happens when someone drops out in the middle of a game , so the matchmaking drafts you in to fill their place . 
  that means you have to wait until the game ends , but you 're guaranteed a spot as soon as it does .

  where on reddit do people say not to vote ? 
  i see tons of activism and people trying to get everyone to vote with them . 
  i wan na see all the cool stuff people have sent sips , i 'm sure he 's got tons of amazing fan-made things, 
  someone reported this post for `` stealing '' this gif from the video . 
  doing so is n't against any rules ( neither reddit 's nor / r/gravityfalls 's ) , although it is jerk behaviour to not give credit in the comments .

  [ here 's the picture in question .

  maybe i was too blunt , but i find it hard to have sympathy for this stuff because i 've seen so many attention-seeking posts like this from kids . 
  i do n't actually believe they 're likely to off themselves because their favourite tv show ended . 
  if i 'm wrong and they really are in trouble , other people here linked appropriate places for this stuff ( / r/suicidewatch ) . 
  they should go there where people can help , because that 's certainly not what this subreddit is for . 
  that 's just an [ eye of providence ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eye_of_providence ) , it 's not bill . 
  that 's a res feature . 
  the best place to start learning about art from scratch is the book * drawing on the right side of the brain * by betty edwards . 
  it 's seriously like magic , i went from being able to draw only stickmen to accurate life drawings in just a week . 
  i owe a lot to that book . 
  there 's a follow-up book called * color * which is all about how to build colour schemes and mix them for painting , which is very beginner-friendly too . 
  i like how if you swap them around , they say `` hi thug '' . 
  no , it 's fuji-san . 
  in this case `` san '' is n't a name honorific , it effectively means `` mt. '', 
  that 's already on the list ... 
  good suggestion !, 
  [ ] ( #pout ) that 's not a tv show, 
  my mistake !, 
  how could i forget ?!,

  fyi , you have been shadowbanned from reddit so none of your posts or comments show up to normal users . 
  [ too slow ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/gravityfalls/comments/48u943/magic_falls_intro_gravity_falls_parody_by/ ), 
  faster menus and downloads ( including a web browser that actually works ) , c-stick support for earlier games , built-in amiibo scanner , face plates , now the snes games . 
  it 's not a huge step up , but if your old 3ds is looking a bit rough around the edges it can be worth the upgrade . 
  my friend and i had a heart attack when earthbound was mentioned , then had to quickly reign ourselves in when we realised it was nothing new . 
  you broke the reddit rules somehow . 
  [ message the reddit admins ] ( https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2freddit.com ) and they may be able to tell you .
