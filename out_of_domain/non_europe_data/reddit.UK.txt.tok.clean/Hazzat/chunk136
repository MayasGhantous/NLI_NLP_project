  i saw it a few days ago , and it was alright i guess . 
  the music was n't particularly albarn-y , and as with every other story written about social media and internet culture , it felt very out-of-touch and often cringy . 
  the production design was outstanding , but overall i felt it was n't worth the time or money . 
  where did these notes come from ? 
  in the official patch notes translation , it says this instead :, 
   during ranked battles , when a team plays at a disadvantage due to unavoidable issues such as teammates being disconnected , and then loses , the winning team 's points will be decreased by an amount proportional to the time they benefited from the above conditions . 
  you should probably kick some life into it while it 's in the spotlight .

  nozzlenose too !, 
  that is so true . 
  guys , it 's not `` pin number '' , it 's just `` pin '' . 
  it stands for `` personal identification number '' , so `` pin number '' means `` personal identification number number '' . 
  number number number number, 
  that 's an amazing marriage of the old and new . 
  nah , that 's just how anime lip synch works .

  why do n't you ? 
  no one else is going to do it . 
  if you want to see something happen , it wo n't if you just throw the idea out and say `` oh , i wish * someone * would do this ... '' you 've got ta make it happen yourself !, 
  then they should learn how !, 
  i just reached the end of genki i ( hooray ) , and the only lingering question i have is about the \u3066\u3044\u308b form . 
  it can be used to talk about an action you 're doing right now ( \u52c9\u5f37\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059 , `` i 'm studying ( right now ) '' ) , but the book never explained when you would use it in this way in past tense ( \u52c9\u5f37\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3057\u305f ) . 
  this is something i see quite frequently when reading and lang-8 people will sometimes include it in corrections , so how do you use this form ? 
  you do n't get banned for one comment , but you do get your comment removed and politely asked not to spam emotes . 
  do n't spam emotes , please !, 
  the [ pink/purple ] ( https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3978420/tumblr_nt9gow7sws1u3akyno6_1280.0.jpg ) combination was removed from the game , i guess because they were too similar to each other . 
  the other colours are all there , though ... 
  it was added to the normal game after the splatfest ( [ here 's a video ] ( https://youtu.be/fr4v1i2zugg?t=3258 ) ) . 
  [ people complained ] ( http://squidboards.com/threads/pink-purple-ink-combo-needs-to-be-banned-or-removed-via-update.6747/ ) , and it was removed .

  this is just a post about yourself . 
  [ this ] ( http://themysteryofgravityfalls.com/campaign/ ) would be much more effective than an e-petition . 
  to learn the language : shell out on a textbook . 
  there are free learning resources and stuff online , but nothing will see you learning as fast as sitting down with a textbook and learning the grammar rules . 
  / r/learnjapanese has a good wiki that lists resources and how to get started , although the community itself is n't that useful until you 're at a more advanced level and have more complex questions to ask . 
  there 's only so many times the poor top-level learners can face answering `` what 's the difference between \u306f and \u304c ? '', 
  you do n't need to * change * shoes when going indoors , but you do need to take your shoes off . 
  if your everyday shoes are easy to take off and slip on , you 'll have a much easier time . 
  ( do n't make my mistake last time i visited and wear converse that take ages to put on . ), 
  yes , you can get a haircut there . 
  the country is n't so weird that they wo n't know what to do with you , although the variety of hairdressers will obviously depend on your location . 
  wifi is the same as everywhere else . 
  so as to not offend : bow a lot , use honourifics . 
  there are a hundred thousand blog posts and youtube videos dedicated to the cultural differences , you can find these yourself . 
  being adaptable , good at research and looking after yourself are desirable qualities for a jet . 
  if you just want everyone to hand you answers to easily-researchable questions , that does n't bode well ... 
  not at all , that 's probably the perfect amount of time to see all the tourist spots . 
  whether you should take days off tokyo and give them to other places on your trip depends on what places you want to see most . 
  although , as others have said , you 'll probably like kansai a lot . 
  is there any reason in particular you 're stopping in nagoya ? 
  afaik there is n't anything very special to do there . 
  from a technical and creative standpoint , it is the most best-animated show ever . 
  every single movement has such life and style to it , and it 's a quality that could only come from one of the most skilful and experienced animators of today , craig mccracken . 
  as an animation student myself , that gets me going . 
  the stories are equally madcap . 
  it 's a proper cartoon cartoon , taking inspiration from the visual gags of old ( chuck jones , tex avery et al. 
  ) , giving them a fresh lick of paint so everything looks gorgeous and pushing them even further . 
  everything about woy is nothing short of animated genius . 
  oh , in that case nagoya is a fine place to stop . 
  judging by your interests , the places you 've listed should have you covered . 
  i think it 's a good call to give kyoto a day , even if you do n't like temples , because it 's a sight to see . 
  do the golden pavilion , do the castle maybe and the fushimi-inari shrine and it should feel like a day well-spent . 
  you did n't say how long your trip is , but a journey to hokkaido would be one hell of a detour . 
  if you 're staying for two weeks or more it might be okay to sacrifice a day or two to that travel time , but any less and you 'd be trading precious sightseeing days for staring out of a plane/shinkansen window . 
  apparently people mailed in doritos and said they were bill .

  i have no idea why you posted this here . 
  removed - put this in / r/joaje instead, 
  it 's a charity drive . 
  the whole point is that if you give money , you should really give as much a possible . 
  / r/bannedfromanime _ irl *, 
  joke 's on you , reddit 's auto anti-spam detector picked this up and removed it the second it was posted !, 
  i did n't even have to do anything . 
  we already have [ discord ] ( https://discordapp.com/invite/0petswfwbrdidpmm ) ... 
  amazing . 
  i ca n't imagine what went into getting permission to shoot in that pub . 
  do not post this stuff on the subreddit d :, 
  i already removed it , but you should have known better . 
  read da rules - , 
  i take no responsibility for what gets posted while i 'm asleep . 
   tokyo is not much busier, 
  i do n't know much about golden week , but when i was there at the start of silver week , tokyo was booked out . 
  there was n't a single empty seat on the shinkansen , or any hotel , hostel or airbnb rooms left in the whole city . 
  the tourist spots like senso-ji were rammed with people , too . 
  the city order probably depends on what you want to do . 
  if you want to hit the big tourist spots , definitely move those outside the peak of golden week if you can . 
  the important thing is that you book stuff * now * , though !,
