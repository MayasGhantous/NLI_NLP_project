  removed , this is not your personal blog to talk about yourself . 
  [ ] ( #rdipponder ) why do you put an exclamation mark at the end of every post ? 
  i noticed you 've been doing it for ages . 
  [ here 's the comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/gravityfalls/comments/zzyin/im_michael_rianda_cartoonist_and_creative/c69aqpv?context=1 ) ( from september 2012 ) . 
  do n't believe the lies . 
  2:30 `` that 's the part i like , i like to cover the walls . '', 
  * twitch *, 
  results are the same , but the way you get splatfest points has changed . 
  and your vibe meter ( the flags ) will show how many points you 've scored for your splatfest team , instead of just how well you 're doing personally . 
  these places are all popular areas , so there are plenty of people of all ages around there . 
  the only places in tokyo i would n't recommend taking kids are kabuki-cho in shinjuku ( tokyo 's equivalent of a red light district , sex shops etc. 
  ) , and roppongi ( nightlife hotspot for foreigners , shady people trying to coax you into expensive bars ) . 
  everywhere else you 'll be just fine , it really is a very safe country .

  how could they give them that , when that 's what they already are ? 
  gorgeous . 
  do you know what city this is ? 
  removed for being off-topic . 
  i think it was just a reference to the fact that , in the world of investing , gold is considered the safest thing to invest money into . 
  the joke is that even in the event of the apocalypse , it will never lose value . 
  they paint over it in photoshop , it 's not just a filter . 
  the background art is done separately to all the moving stuff , which is why they stick out . 
  it looks better in motion , of course . 
  if you waited just a few more minutes you could have posted this at 6:18 pm uk time ... 
  yes . 
  god yes . 
  i put off watching it because it looked like yet another fanservicey schoolgirl show , but it turned out to be one of the most mindblowing stories i 'd ever experienced , with an absolutely fantastic art style and animation . 
  one of the best shows i 've ever seen , i love it to bits . 
  i 'm pretty sure every sandcastle i 've made lasted for about an hour , whereas the snowmen lasted for days ... 
  but maybe that 's just me . 
  from what i understand , the limited animation was due to budget constraints , but i was blown away by the fact that they were able to take what should have been a drawback and integrate it into a cohesive animation style that somehow thrived on its jumpiness . 
  [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izyuew6y_hk ) does a great job of explaining how it worked so well . 
  as for colours , there were so many times i paused the show just to think `` man , that 's beautiful '' so i guess we 'll have to agree to disagree on that . 
  ^ ( * edit : * added a link that works in the us ), 
  head lice can be killer . 
  it 's got so many it 's off the chart . 
  yeah , the mods here really care about the quality of the subreddit . 
  if ever you think the place has [ lost its way ] ( http://images6.fanpop.com/image/photos/35800000/ryuko-matoi-kill-la-kill-35886673-848-480.png ) or is slipping , do n't be afraid to bring it up . 
  the roundhouse one was so good that i had to buy my ticket straight away . 
  the last one was crazy party night-themed , so i 'd expect the next one to be based on another song/album to come out between now and july . 
  literally me during the show 's finale, 
  if you wan na chat , try [ the discord ] ( https://discordapp.com/invite/0petswfwbrdidpmm ) . 
  there are a couple of guys on my animation course who are in the process of making a film about sentient food that goes insane when they and their friends getting chopped up and eaten . 
  this trailer certainly came as a shock to them ...

  removed for being off-topic . 
  all content here has to be directly related to gf . 
  there is n't one currently planned , but if you [ send a letter ] ( http://themysteryofgravityfalls.com/campaign/ ) it will become much more likely . 
  removed , do n't spam emotes . 
  your post is already ` super dank ' . 
  unless you mean user flair , in which case you can just pick your own from the sidebar - , 
  [ this is how the traffic spike ended up ] ( http://imgur.com/cph92uq ) , by the way . 
  i 'll see if we can get our traffic stats made public , because this stuff is cool to look at . 
  ** edit : ** [ they 're public now ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/anime_irl/about/traffic/ ), 
  [ even alex does n't know !, 
  well , comedy = tragedy + time . 
  it 's not far off . 
  these are all fantastic !, 
  removed for being off-topic, 
  i 'm 11 hours too late but i removed this post and i dislike you for making it . 
  removed because oh my god please stop . 
  those posts have a direct relation to gravity falls - an image of a character or whatever . 
  you can tell they 're gf-related without having to look at the title . 
  this post is just a picture of a bill murray bust , which has no relation at all . 
  removed for being some combination of memey and off-topic, 
  removed , rule 7 ( no screenshots ) . 
  touch\u00e9 . 
  ehhhhhhh not really . 
  it 's just a crystal ball emoji , suggesting that he 'll be able to look into it and find all the answers . 
  do not spam emotes . 
  you need to get some arm swings in there !, 
  remember right arm follows the left leg and vice versa . 
  removed . 
  a random ex-wife joke does not make this gf-related . 
  duuude :, 
   no meme posts allowed , unless they are of original art . 
  ( example : say somebody drew a inkling with a scumbag steve hat and made a post with it . ), 
  i think that 's what / r/splatooncasual was meant to be , although it 's dead . 
  we have / r/saltoon and / r/thesaltysplatoon for more spl ` oon memes too though . 
  [ nihongonomori ] ( https://www.youtube.com/channel/ucvx6rfaeag46xfasd2zz16w ) 's videos are fantastic supplemental material . 
  you get listening practice , a lesson and an explanation that really cleared up everything i learned in genki . 
  [ message the moderators ] ( https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2fsplatoon ) , they 've been known to forget this stuff in the past . 
  read the rules dude :, 
   no meme posts allowed , unless they are of original art . 
  ( example : say somebody drew a inkling with a scumbag steve hat and made a post with it . ), 
  it 's the logo for splatfests , as seen [ here ] ( http://i.imgur.com/kpy9xsk.png ) . 
  the design is a reference to [ a method of preparing grilled squid ] ( http://www.gourmed.com/sites/default/files/grilled-squid.jpg ) . 
  callie and marie 's outfits also reference this with their stripes . 
  jesus this community got hostile suddenly o_o, 
  the splatfest colours change every time to reflect the teams you can choose from . 
  this is a weird thing to get salty about ... 
  reaction gifs in general count , in my experience allowing people to post random off-topic images like this is a fast way to kill a community , because good stuff just gets drowned in crappy content . 
  it 's not a problem on / r/splatoon yet , but the rule is there for a reason . 
  removed , rule 7 ( no screenshots ) . 
  ~ ~ try / r/animemes instead . ~ ~, 
  [ ] ( #death ) booooo !, 
  get off the stage !, 
  this is the first time anyone 's actually asked me to delete something .
