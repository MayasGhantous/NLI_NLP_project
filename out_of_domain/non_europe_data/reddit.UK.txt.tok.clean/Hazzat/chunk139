  most of the time people get mad because we remove too many posts ... 
  i could remove this under the `` no memes '' rule , but i 'd rather let this guy embarrass themselves by knowing that they made an unbearably stupid post . 
  removed , not a brickfilm . 
  you 've been spamming this same link a lot which could get you banned , so please review [ reddit 's self-promotion ] ( https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion ) guidelines before continuing . 
  the show is set in the summer of 2012 , in case you 're wondering . 
  as / u/amerifreedom said , in a backwoods town in the middle of the oregon forest , there 's no need to be up to date . 
  absolutely stomped to the curb in every game as team hoverboard , but i still made it to king/queen . 
  gib snails, 
  i removed this for not being relatable ( rule 5 ) and also not * really * being anime . 
  [ aaaagh sorry sorry ] ( https://media.giphy.com/media/teqzdip8fdbng/giphy.gif ) i 'll stop mentioning it now . 
  i thought this was just anime-related enough to be relevant there . 
  removed - a random `` aim '' joke does not make this gf-related . 
  removed , no nsfw content . 
  it 's a css exploit . 
  the username _ billcipher is meant to glow , but it seems that makes __ billcipher ( two underscores ) glow too . 
  i 'll see if i can fix it . 
  the character on his shirt ( \u8b0e ) means `` riddle '' , which is a nice touch . 
  i study it in my spare time because i made some japanese friends over the summer , and i want to talk to them more . 
  this character is \u53c2 , which is an old-fashioned way of writing the number 3 . 
  japanese people use it similarly to how we use roman numerals ( like iii ) today . 
  i also lost almost every single game i played for team hoverboard . 
  thanks fellow hoverbros for making up for us !, 
  the `` popularity = loss '' phenomenon was only really an american thing . 
  if you look at [ past results ] ( http://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/splatfest#completed ) , in europe it does n't look like popularity ever made much of a difference . 
  people in this sub clearly did n't look at [ past results ] ( http://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/splatfest#completed ) where in europe popularity does n't make much of a difference in deciding the winner . 
  it was a fake account , not / u / _ billcipher . 
  they deleted the post themselves shortly after everyone realised the truth , which only took a few minutes . 
  honestly , anyone who says that has no idea how good cgi humans look nowadays . 
  you probably would n't want one to be your leading actor ( although that has been done successfully , see benjamin button , or [ this ad ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gx9edos76lm ) ) , but it 's totally doable for the purposes of a brief cameo . 
  and hey , tasteful cameos from deceased people [ are not unheard of ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaod66l7er8 ) . 
   an old portrait of lee dressed as a wealthy baron hanging on a wall in the background, 
  like [ in big hero 6 ] ( http://static6.businessinsider.com/image/5476247aeab8ead518b21366-1631-793/stan-lee-big-hero-6-cameo.png ) ? 
   the image you are requesting does not exist or is no longer available, 
  post removed !, 
  the story is over , and journal 3 will be the epilogue . 
  ehh , loads of subreddits do it , it 's nothing new . 
  / r/woahdude is probably the most prominent example . 
  [ seems awfully familiar ... ] ( https://youtu.be/gjom7v54t-c?t=41 ), 
  the actual workings of splatoon 's matchmaking are a mystery . 
  apparently you get matched with players with similar playstyles ( people who like inking go together , people who like splatting go together ) but we do n't actually know how that works . 
  the system seems to be built to get you into a game as fast as possible after you choose to play . 
  matching you with similar levels is secondary , really . 
  they do n't have hair , they have tentacles . 
  you ca n't cut those !, 
  also , the number of `` tentacles '' they have [ is the same as a real squid ] ( http://www.thetanooki.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/141226splatoonanatomy-e1419621345942.jpg ) . 
  removed - no nsfw . 
  everyone is still using damage up all the time and it 's getting boring . 
  it 's a [ horseshoe crab ] ( http://www-tc.pbs.org/wnet/nature/files/2014/10/horseshoecrab-main.jpg ) . 
  specifically , [ this horseshoe crab ] ( http://cdn.wikimg.net/splatoonwiki/images/thumb/f/f2/sheldon_transparent.png/221px-sheldon_transparent.png ) . 
  that 's right , because we do n't allow nsfw content at all here . 
  read the rules in the sidebar please - , 
  removed - no nsfw . 
  this link does n't go anywhere - removed . 
  100 % absolutely not real . 
  anyone can add stuff to google maps . 
  it says this on the [ submit page ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/gravityfalls/submit ) . 
  removed for being off-topic . 
  removed for being off-topic . 
  this is just an [ eye of providence ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eye_of_providence ) , not bill . 
  people kept posting it here , so i 'd seen it enough times . 
  luigi 's mansion 2 's multiplayer callouts worked so well . 
  they were :, 
  `` hey !, 
  / good job !, 
  / help !, 
  / thank you ! '', 
  `` hey '' in particular was useful , because it could mean a number of things depending on when and how you used it . 
  nighttime is reserved for splatfest only . 
  it 's special that way . 
  yes . 
  ... both . 
  uh ... israel vs. palestine ? 
  removed because this is n't actually anime . 
  [ this is where you can get it !, 
  ] ( https://www.etsy.com/listing/182373553/gravity-falls-what-is-the-mystery-shack ), 
  i have to remove this because the image is n't directly related to gf . 
  as it says on the submit page :, 
   generally speaking , people should be able to tell that your post is gf-related without looking at the title . 
  if it does n't fit that criteria , it 's likely that your post will be removed . 
  is this really relatable ? 
  it might be better-suited to / r/animenocontext . 
  no because i do n't go outside, 
  ... what ? 
  [ japanese kana ] ( http://www.japanese-symbols.org/images/japanese-hiragana-chart.gif ) is really easy to learn , and it can be something fun to do while you 're waiting on the lobby screen if you 're bored of squid jump . 
  removed because i 'm 70 % sure this is n't anime . 
  can we take a moment to appreciate how cool the image at the top is too ? 
  what 's fun about ranked modes is that there is * always * a chance you can turn it around . 
  because of the overtime mechanic , your team is never out of the running until the whistle is blown . 
  a mercy rule would be pointless because there is never a point at which you can say `` this team has a 0 % chance of recovering . '', 
  game screenshots are okay , it 's screenshots of social media/web pages that we do n't like . 
  world tour when \u3064 \u25d5 _ \u25d5 \u3064, 
  in january , the squid sisters did [ a live show ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pol1kjzb4w ) in tokyo . 
  they 'll soon be doing another . 
  i think / u/automoderator needs a special flair for being a robot . 
  i 'd like to suggest [ eva 01 ] ( http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/68345/3172174-evangelionunit-01.jpg ) . 
  removed because seriously what is this . 
  you need to construct first !, 
  the art of character design is all about starting with simple shapes , then building on top of that to add the details . 
  do n't think about outlines , think about mass , proportion and shapes . 
  removed for being off-topic .
