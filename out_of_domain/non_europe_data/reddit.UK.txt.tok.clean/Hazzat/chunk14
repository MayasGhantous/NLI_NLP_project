  / r/minecraft may get more traffic , but that probably works to your disadvantage . 
  to get your idea noticed , it would be a better idea to post in a place there are less posts around , right ? 
  not only that , but the minecraft team have said that they regularly check / r/minecraftsuggestions , so your idea would definitely have more of a chance of being implemented if it was posted there . 
  i fail to see how this is almost politically correct . 
  `` phallic '' is the adjective ; `` phallus '' is the noun . 
  ya mean [ this one ] ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gameloft.android.anmp.gloftpohm ) ? 
  well , [ alex day ( nerimon ) ] ( http://www.youtube.com/nerimon ) is a youtube star who got his song stupid stupid to # 25 . 
  last year he got to # 4 , i think . 
  wikipedia tells me the nook color is android 2.2 , and the google play page says the mlp app requires android 2.3 and up . 
  so no , sorry . 
  it 's definitely a bug , i 've got it a few times . 
  in 1.4.5 when i tried to pick up items they would sometimes go into my feet slot . 
  if i did n't get rid of them quickly enough , i would get kicked out of the server with an `` internal server error '' and i was n't able to get back on for several hours . 
  beware potato feet . 
  you can just save the post , you know . 
  [ the joke has already been made .

  i 'm on ~ 990 streetpass hits right now after getting it on launch day and i 've got ta second the `` go to conventions '' tactic . 
  also , if you can , go to japan . 
  i went to tokyo in october and was getting at least 20 people a day . 
  when that started happening on / r/photoshopbattles the mods began enforcing a rule that all top-level comments must be a photoshop , because the actual content was getting drowned out by rubbish comments . 
  now this subreddit is getting a spike in popularity , you may want to consider a similar rule here ... 
  the minigames take advantage of it too ( like aiming with the bow in zelda : battle quest ) . 
  a picture ? 
  [ ] ( / e27 ) on no-pics thursday !, 
  under the post there 's a bunch of things you can click :, 
  ( number ) comments share save hide report, 
  just click save . 
  i 've been subscribed to nurdrage for a long time , and it 's clear that what he does is no secret . 
  he often gets his co-workers involved , like when they made a several metre-long glow stick and took it outside . 
  i do n't get what you 're trying to say - he spent $ 1700 on the bar of platinum and turned it into liquid worth $ 3000 . 
  that 's a substantial profit . 
  i do n't know what mod is being used here specifically , but [ voxelplayer ] ( http://www.voxelwiki.com/minecraft/voxelplayer ) lets you see speech bubbles above people 's heads . 
  they look a bit different to the ones in this screenshot though . 
  they just changed it to a rule . 
  it now says ** do not ** in bold all caps . 
  i 'd be most interested in their work for / r/tldr . 
  seriously , the guy must live and breathe reddit to do all that . 
  definitely a troll . 
  it became apparent towards the end when she started making `` jokes '' about the children 's day care centre and being in court . 
  of course it 's still cringeworthy because this is a shameful attempt at making a funny video . 
  i do n't know about you , but the first thing her voice made me think of was boxxy . 
  i 'd have to agree . 
  some of the textures are different enough to look interesting ( the cracked stone brick is lovely ) but the last thing we need is * more * simple packs . 
  give it its own flavour , and do n't get lazy . 
  ^ edit : ^ `` its '' , ^ not ^ `` it 's '', 
  it 's kind of like a solar panel . 
  when it can see the sun above it , it will send a signal down redstone wire the same way a lever would do when you switch it on , the key difference here though , is that the distance the signal will travel depends on how high the sun is in the sky . 
  [ here 's the trailer ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rb69vxau9s0 ) if you want to know more . 
  kk looks awfully sultry . 
  the area around the latch is * ever so slightly * redder . 
  it distributes what you 're holding evenly between the slots you hover over . 
  yes it would , if you middle-click a block in survival it will jump to that block if it 's in your hotbar . 
  the fact that it emits a redstone current could mean it might become a little difficult work work with when using it for aesthetics ... 
  there 's also all the merch on [ thinkgeek ] ( http://www.thinkgeek.com/interests/minecraft/ ) . 
  and the ores really are too iconic to change , given all the wallpapers , art and real-life models ( like aaaall the ones at minecon ) dedicated to them . 
  well that 's the thing , if you do n't want to use it for its redstone properties ( like if you wanted to use it for a wall ) you might struggle to because everything near it would be powered the whole time . 
  doors , trapdoors , redstone lamps ... 
  there 's more furniture powerable by redstone than you might think at first . 
  ^ edit : ^ typo, 
  yes , although you may find people wo n't take too kindly to such self-promotion . 
  but reddit is fickle . 
  yes , and it 's always powered . 
  you ca n't turn it off , even by sending a signal to it . 
  the benefit of it is that it can be pushed/pulled by a piston . 
  [ like this . 
  [ ] ( / raritywut ) you , uh , appear to be missing a snout there . 
  thanks !, 
  the lake does it exist , it 's just much further out , out the right side of the image . 
  the map is built by the players on [brohoof.com ] ( http://www.brohoof.com/ ) and the easiest way to visit it to connect to the server ( the ip is mc.brohoof.com ) . 
  if you really want the download , you can get it [ here ] ( http://www.brohoof.com/backups/ ) , but be warned that if you open it without the worldguard plugin , things will start burning , leaves will start decaying , ice will start melting etc. ... so be careful !, 
  edit : oh , in case you need clarification , it 's in the `` worlds '' folder under the name `` equestria4 '' . 
  [ ] ( / flutterfear ) i do n't know what link is or where you got it , but that 's not where this particular map comes from ... 
  [ ] ( / twiright ) not so disappointed now , huh ? 
  it 's under construction !, 
  these things take time , and we want them done in the highest quality possible . 
  it 's not totally finished ( as you can see by the empty plots at the bottom there ) , there 's still plenty of space for ponyville newcomers to set up a house of their own . 
  yep ( although dodge junction still needs some work ) . 
  we just plopped in carrot top 's house behind sweet apple acres so ponyville and the surrounding area are all landmarked-up .

  if you like this , you should come and join us at / r/mylittleminecraft . 
  we 're a very small sub and would love some new members !, 
  this is a render ( meaning it was n't taken in-game ) and uses the [ love & tolerance texture pack ] ( http://www.planetminecraft.com/texture_pack/love-and-tolerance-texture-pack/ ) , so you 'd be forgiven for thinking it does n't quite look like minecraft . 
  it 's made of cubes though !, 
  sorry we have to keep the guests slot number low a lot of the time ( it 's easier to manage that way ) but i just raised the slot number to 10 so you should be able to get in now . 
  you must be thinking of a different server , because brohoof is creative ( no need for food or armour ) , not rp-centric and we do n't have a player called bbqwatermelons . 
  i linked where to download in the same comment i linked the server ... 
  it 's there !, 
  it 's just way , way off in the distance ... you can see just how far away [ here ] ( http://www.brohoof.com/dynmap/?worldname=equestria4&amp;mapname=surface&amp;zoom=2&amp;x=125.05271932737386&amp;y=64&amp;z=-446.28955987135646 ) . 
  i 'm so sorry orange, 
  fluttershy does n't live in ponyville !, 
  she lives just outside it , closer to everfree . 
  you can just about see it [ here ] ( http://www.brohoof.com/dynmap/?worldname=equestria4&amp;mapname=surface&amp;zoom=6&amp;x=144.23299076705896&amp;y=64&amp;z=531.3739534666936 ) . 
  dude , [ i posted the link to the download ages ago . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/mylittlepony/comments/160g6q/welcome_to_ponyville_in_minecraft/c7rjblk ), 
  we 're very sorry that we have to limit guests so much , but it 's a necessary evil as guests tend to be very high-maintenance with lots of questions and it can be incredibly hard to keep up . 
  the limit can be changed at any time though so when there are more admins on we tend to raise the cap . 
  yep , but she 's in the everfree forest . 
  there 's all of equestria there , plus cloudsdale and the crystal empire .
