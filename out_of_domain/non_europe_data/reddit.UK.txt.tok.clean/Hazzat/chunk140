  if it does n't fit that criteria , it 's likely that your post will be removed .

  the co-ordinates were a hoax accidentally started on themysteryofgravityfalls.com . 
  the guy who runs the site put them there ages ago for fun and just forgot about them . 
  then people found them after the finale and made the mistake of taking them seriously . 
  ` scuse me but it says [ in the rules ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/gravityfalls/about/rules/ ) that pinecest is banned .

  [ message the reddit admins ] ( https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2freddit.com ) if you want to know more about the ban .

  just ... stop being so anal about everything . 
  in a digital environment where developers ( of all software , not just games ) are realising the benefits of letting your stuff be more free , nintendo remain stalwarts in holding onto more control than they need . 
  with that in mind , i want to see :, 
  * no region lock, 
  * less youtube copyright hounding, 
  * better developer/community communication, 
  * better support for competitive stuff to leep the hardcore fanbase hanging around . 
  sm4sh patch notes are infamously brief , and while splatoon ones are better , we really have no way of letting the devs know what problems we think the game has that need to be fixed . 
  compare that to other competitive games where developers are always on hand and eager to listen to the community 's feedback , and it 's certainly disappointing . 
  even then , sharing the data that informed changes , or at least providing some insight into why the changes were made would be infinitely preferable to a patch accompanied by nothing at all . 
   my hopes is that the sequel may have something to do with being an adult . 
  well , we know that the new main character is a high school girl , but it 's set many years after the original story so i have no doubt that we 'll see a grown-up naota . 
   splatoon did really well in japan . 
  that does n't really solve the mystery , because the game has sold more in north america ( 1.67 m copies ) than japan ( 1.28 m ) , never mind na + eu ( 1.07 m ) combined . 
  i think japanese players just really , * really * like playing all the time . 
  in the hearts along the bottom there are [ messages from each member ] ( http://m.imgur.com/a/herwh ) ( in japanese , of course ) . 
  i removed this because it 's not really gf-related , and it 's kinda mean to spidey . 
  it 's not spam though ( [ this is what reddit considers spam ] ( https://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq#wiki_what_constitutes_spam.3f ) ) , it 's good content that benefits the community , and a million times better than recycled joajes . 
  aside from the slightly annoying exclamation mark at the end of every post title , i do n't see him doing anything wrong here .

  the time we spend together is like a shining jewel .

  i ordered it from [ the official store ] ( https://fan-goods.jp/lovelive_6th/end.php ) back in december . 
  i figured if i ca n't go to the show , i may as well still have a token to remember it by .

  they have a megachurch culture that gives the us a run for its money , including [ the largest megachurch in the world ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yoido_full_gospel_church ) . 
  i 'd imagine that has something to do with it . 
  at last !, 
  now where is flipnote studio 3d ? 
  \u00a5 1600 to the uk , which is just shy of # 10 . 
  sadly it was a limited-time thing , you ca n't buy it anymore ( unless you 're at tokyo dome today :p ) . 
  it 's a simple animation program that lets you make little flipbooks by drawing on your 3ds . 
  this version also has some 3d options ( you can draw a foreground/midground/background ) . 
  as an animation student , this is all i have wanted on my 3ds since day one .
