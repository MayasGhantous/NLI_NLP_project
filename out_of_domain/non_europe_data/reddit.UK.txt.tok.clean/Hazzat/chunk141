  i ca n't believe it 's finally here . 
  everyone here who watched it said it was identical to the original , except with a few clips from the finale thrown in . 
  nothing new . 
  you can watch the original [ here ] ( http://invera.tumblr.com/gf_episodes ) under ` shorts + special ' . 
  this requires a browser extension , no one without it can see those changes . 
  there 's / r/flipnotestudio3d which is already a bit more popular ... 
  it 's in the japanese version , but was removed from the na localisation ( and probably the eu one as well , but that 's not out until mid-may ) . 
  there 's a name to remember . 
  his work is amazing . 
  [ ] ( #trigger ) deadly serious . 
  aw crap , i did n't rea - * banned *, 
  what 's confusing ? 
  i thought i made it pretty clear . 
  . . you do know that 's not really him , right ? 
  [ ] ( #blackbill ) weirdmageddon is forever, 
  this is literally me im screaming, 
  [ here are 3,600 + people you can add !, 
  ] ( https://redd.it/4av8pf ), 
  your mii might ask if they can share it with everyone , but you ca n't just straight up share it yourself . 
  answer a lot of questions and maybe it will come up . 
  / u/makmark has been banned from / r/gravityfalls, 
  durr plant, 
  [ ** e-j-a-o-j ** ] ( #spoiler ), 
  if you want to read more , [ the director did an ama ] ( https://redd.it/49r3e8 ) . 
  given [ this answer ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/iama/comments/49r3e8/i_am_anime_director_hiroshi_nishikiori_ask_me/d0u5hke?context=1 ) , i 'm not surprised he did n't manage to capture the anime idol scene . 
  nope !, 
  aww , shucks, 
  looks alright to me , you 're good to go . 
  nope , it 's based on [ this ] ( http://youtu.be/ycsysjwewwk ) . 
  see also : / r/vaporwaveaesthetics, 
  quite a lot , we did n't actually remove any though !, 
  i was more surprised than you !, 
  i did eventually , and we merged twice before someone managed to convince everyone to vote ` stay ' and we got the tiny little crappy subreddit that is / r/celiatfeckmsars5aelr . 
  weirdly , we actually * gained * 18 subscribers yesterday [ according to redditmetrics ] ( http://redditmetrics.com/r/gravityfalls ) . 
  some people really like bad content , i guess ? 
  miitomo does n't have built-in emoticons , you can use emojis instead . 
  yep , i removed the majority of the off-topic posts and the usual rules are back in place . 
  yep !, 
  it was such a trailblazer . 
  removed for not being anime . 
  try / r/miitomo ? 
  nope nope nope we 're not having this, 
  if you 're touching the mii when you start your swipe , it moves them . 
  if you start by touching the background and swipe from there , it will turn/flip/rotate . 
  if you talk to your mii immediately after making a miifoto , they 'll ask if you want to share it instead of answer a question . 
  you ca n't just share any miifoto you have in your library , sadly . 
  [ this should clue you in . 
  ] ( http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/cadbortion-loss-edits ), 
  for one day ( april 1st ) , we removed all the rules and replaced them with just one : `` all content must be completely unrelated to gravity falls . '', 
  you would have loved it !, 
  removed for being off-topic , all content must be directly related to the show . 
  kyoto 's looking nice this time of year . 
  no , not really . 
  the fun of miitomo is learning stuff about your friends you would n't know otherwise , so there is n't much point in adding strangers at all . 
  removed , no screenshots ( rule 7 ), 
  no prob, 
  i love you music man, 
  removed for being off-topic . 
  from the sidebar :, 
   it should be easy to tell that your post is gf-related without looking at the title . 
  but they still managed to steal all the natural wonders , right ? 
  [ ] ( #mabelgoof ) april fools, 
  you ca n't add people via qr code , that only adds the mii to your game . 
  you have to add people through facebook/twitter/nearby , and [ here are a few thousand ] ( https://redd.it/4av8pf ) who are happy to do just that . 
  ikebukuro 's otome road would be perfect !, 
  the area is like akihabara , but geared much more towards girls , and there are lots of cosplay shops full of handmade outfits . 
  it depends on the hostel , you should contact them and ask . 
  though it 's likely that if tours are offered , they 'd advertise it on their website . 
  how many have you answered ? 
  i 'm scared of hitting the limit too ... 
  haha , looks like i 've got quite a way to go then . 
  after seeing miis talk in tomodachi life , it was * really * weird going to mario kart 8 where they make weird `` wahoo ! '', 
  noises . 
  i have n't raced as a mii since . 
  this stream has left me smiling uncontrollably . 
  kim , you deserve all the love you get . 
  oh , and / u/caffcast , you are a champ . 
  thanks for keeping a cool head despite the craziness . 
  if you want changes made to the subreddit , [ message the moderators ] ( https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2fmiitomo ) . 
  that way they 're much more likely to see it . 
  reference is from [ [ atsugiri jason ] ( https://youtu.be/frfudx_pmga?t=61 ) ], 
  you can only share the ones you get prompted to share . 
  nope , and it kinda takes the fun out of it . 
  the whole point of miitomo is to get to know your friends better , so why add tons of strangers ? 
  [ ] ( #trigger ) i made a mistake . 
  ( it 's fixed now . ), 
  please [ message the moderators ] ( https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2fgravityfalls ) to report stuff like this in the future !, 
  it 's whatever you make of it . 
  you should go to / r/translator next time instead !, 
  oh , it 's out there . 
  never click on anything that references taco bell . 
  it 's junk food and will make you fat . 
  [ i 'm in love ] ( http://imgur.com/a/xci0l ) with miifoto 's potential for aesthetic/existental/weird creations . 
  [ kirino ] ( http://images5.fanpop.com/image/photos/24800000/looking-like-the-fuhhh-kirino-kousaka-24827907-1280-720.jpg ), 
  you 'd probably get sick due to lack of nutrition , though . 
  you get a reward every time you level up . 
  most levels give you a ticket for miitomo drop , but on levels 5/10/15 ( and beyond ... ? ), 
  you get a special unlockable item . 
  to be honest , it turned out to not be much more than tha * t * . 
  if you think that 's crazy , you should see how they mate .
