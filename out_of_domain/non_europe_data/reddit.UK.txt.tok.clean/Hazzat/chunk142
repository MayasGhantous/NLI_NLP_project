  the vocals are all made with vocaloid , which is a voice synthesiser that allows you to type in lyrics , pitch them and hear them sung . 
  there is a large fanbase and hundreds of thousands of vocaloid songs have been written . 
  the whole thing is probably best-known for the fact that each voicebank has its own anime-style avatar , and they occasionally [ perform in hologram form ] ( http://youtu.be/ysywtesoeoc ) . 
  ( for more : / r/vocaloid ! ), 
  i do n't know much about this album in particular because it 's so obscure , but afaik they 're all totally original songs .

  it 's like klk , but they stripped out the craziness and gave it to space patrol luluko instead . 
  i 'll be keeping up with the show , because this story could definitely go places .

  well that 's the first time i 've heard of anyone using rosetta stone to learn japanese .
