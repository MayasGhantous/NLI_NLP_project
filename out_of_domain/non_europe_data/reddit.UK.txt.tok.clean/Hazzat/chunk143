  { space patrol luluco }, 
  come on down to / r/spacepatrolluluco . 
  this is likely because it 's the first splatfest to [ join both eu and na together ] ( http://nintendoeverything.com/splatoon-north-american-and-european-splatfest-13-is-spongebob-squarepants-themed/ ) . 
  they 're in the sidebar, 
  the bill ama took place on april 1 , ** 2015 ** . 
  you 're more than a little late . 
  i have so many questions ... 
  are you looking for help , or do you just want to share your story ? 
  if you 're looking for help , / r/creepypms is a supportive community , and has [ a detailed wiki ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypms/wiki/index ) with information and resources . 
  a player 's score shows up as 0p if they disconnected during the game , no matter how much/little they inked before that . 
  there 's no shame in losing if you had a disconnect . 
  an early version of blackbelly skatepark had stairs immediately in front of the spawn , which were replaced with the ramp we have today . 
  i went searching for pictures and ended up watching [ the original e3 trailer again ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l54s2m1dps ) . 
  so much has changed since then ... 
  in order :, 
  * walleye warehouse ( it had funny moving boxes ), 
  the layouts are almost unrecognisable ... 
  send this to the / r/splatoon mods immediately !, 
  they could use a better-looking snoo . 
  removed , no screenshots ( rule 7 ) . 
  also not anime, 
  they 're cousins , though !, 
  the search has n't begun yet . 
  [ how many ? 
  it should n't matter whether i 'm a mod , that was rude anyway . 
  removed for not being anime ( i 'm 70 % sure ), 
  after the first episode i was still a bit worried that this would turn out to be a dime-a-dozen generic anime story , but there was enough trigger flair in the action here that i 'm totally on board now . 
  i still miss the madcap logic of klk , but the more serious tone is actually quite refreshing . 
  well , this is from bugs bunny , which is not an anime . 
  posts here need to specifically have a direct relation to anime . 
  euphonium } ( which just had its second season announced ), 
  hopin ' , prayin ' for a follow-up to kid icarus uprising , on any platform . 
  the amount of detailed worldbuilding seriously inspired design that went into that game means it would be a real shame to just leave it behind . 
  { whisper of the heart }, 
  [ they listened !, 
  ] ( https://redd.it/4fj5nq ), 
  oh i guess it 's not new news , i just saw people freaking out about it in the subreddit discord so i thought it was some big revelation , lol, 
  can confirm , they 're very good . 
  everything is explained in a fun , clear , structured way and the exercises compliment those explanations well . 
  however , they 're not primarily geared towards independent learners - the lessons were designed with the classroom environment in mind . 
  that 's okay though , it just means you need to build yourself a schedule and be your own teacher . 
  it can help to act as if you 're at school - so sit down with the lesson as if attending class , then do the workbook exercises as `` homework '' . 
  go at your own pace , but do n't get lazy . 
  it will only stick as long as you keep up the momentum . 
  protips i learned from tackling genki i :, 
  * the book is split into two halves , listening/comprehension and reading/writing . 
  after doing chapter 1 in the first half , you 're meant to jump to chapter 1 in the second half etc. 
  embarrassingly , i did n't realise this until i was pretty far in ... 
  * every chapter sees a fat list of vocabulary dropped on you . 
  to deal with it , install [ anki ] ( http://ankisrs.net/ ) and add [ genki annihilation ] ( http://www.mediafire.com/download/oxj5xcbfxcc9qa5/nayrs_genki_annihilation_-_complete_v1.apkg ) to your decks . 
  i recommend listening to the audio track of all the words being read out ( on the cd ) so you 're introduced to them all , then start revising them with anki . 
  ga includes sample sentences as well as vocab so you can memorise grammar points too . 
  * do n't worry if you finish a chapter and you feel like you ca n't remember all the details fluently yet , as later chapters always make callbacks to stuff you learned before . 
  i wasted too much time saying `` i 'll go onto the next lesson when i 've * really * got the hang of the stuff i just learned , '' but of course i never did because it meant i just stopped studying . 
  * also , do n't worry too much about applying your knowledge to actual japanese yet . 
  while `` learn more from reality than from textbooks '' is good advice for intermediate/advanced learners , you 'll know so little for most of your time in genki i that most attempts to understand real-world japanese will be frustrating and useless . 
  stick to the included voice tracks so you do n't feel like you 're drowning under the ocean of what you do n't yet know . 
  * genki 's method of teaching kanji sucks !, 
  stroke-by-stroke rote memorisation is slow and painful . 
  there are plenty of alternative methods ( [ wanikani ] ( https://www.wanikani.com/ ) , [ rtk 1 ] ( http://www.uhpress.hawaii.edu/p-7516-9780824835927.aspx ) with [ kanji koohii ] ( http://kanji.koohii.com ) , kanji learner 's course , [ kanjidamage ] ( http://www.kanjidamage.com/ ) ) , so find one that suits you and factor it into your study time . 
  * find a way to incentivise studying . 
  i started making [ lang-8 ] ( http://lang-8.com/ ) posts to make use of grammar forms i 'd just learned , and i found myself learning a lot and making friends , too . 
  their interest in what i had to say got me really excited about learning more . 
  that said , be wary of bogging yourself down in too many tools like this - with so many ` learn japanese ' sites out there , it 's too easy to sign up for them all and get distracted . 
  the more streamlined your study process , the better . 
  learning japanese can be super fun . 
  if you keep it up you should reach a point where it becomes addictive , because with every chapter you read , you can suddenly say and understand so much more . 
  it 's an amazing feeling . 
  these are by pixelling god [ paul robertson ] ( http://probertson.tumblr.com/ ) , not op . 
  he recently started posting making-of pictures on his patreon , so if you like pixel art it 's almost certainly worth contributing to get access to those . 
  there is n't much about tokyo mirage sessions #fe that makes sense . 
  it was a long hiatus , but we made it . 
  the show is only two episodes old , so the baby sub is still growing up . 
  that 's why i 'm pimping it ( and its little sister , / r/spacepatrolluluco ) where i can . 
  it 's 13 eps , but i like it so much i wanted a subreddit for it anyway . 
  and yes , they 're the best . 
  expect everyone to be doing this at the next squid sisters live show on the 29th . 
  / r/northkoreapics, 
  i like fanart and i agree it 's probably the best thing you can post . 
  however , the size of the dumps is out of control , and all the art just gets in the flood . 
  i 've been considering going / r/mylittlepony and limiting everyone to max . 
  5 posts per 10 hours ( or whatever , we can discuss it ) . 
  that way when you want to drop some fanart on the subreddit , you 're better off curating it and picking the best few , rather than leaving it all and hoping the votes sort it out . 
  surely you mean [ faiaa emburem ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtl8gdqikie ) . 
  yes . 
  its existence has perplexed me since day 1 . 
  / u/frozenpandaman has uploaded a bunch of splatoon sound effects onto soundcloud . 
  they 're not music samples , but they might still be helpful : https://soundcloud.com/frozenpandaman/tracks, 
  i 'm surprised they 're taking the ` ultra-short season ' thing semi-seriously . 
  a new intro and everything !, 
  ^ ( plug for / r/spacepatrolluluco , please join us if you like this show ! ), 
  firstly , [ passive-aggressive scriptwriters ] ( http://i.imgur.com/viigisf.png ) , lol . 
  secondly , major klk flashbacks . 
  i love seeing trigger having fun with their own tropes . 
  the ama took place one year and 21 days ago . 
  you 're a little late .
