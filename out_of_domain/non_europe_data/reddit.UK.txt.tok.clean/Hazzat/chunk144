  it 's likely that those were concept designs for the weapons we have today . 
  so in a way you are using them whenever you use a charger . 
  you need to put a backslash before the # for it to show up , otherwise you just get big text . 
  reddit is n't the place to be using hashtags , the site does n't support it . 
  removed for breaking at least 10 rules, 
  m8 i got nothing to be ashamed of, 
  i get that , but reddit as a platform is n't really designed for endless scrolling that you can lose yourself in . 
  the voting arrows mean it 's really about finding , sharing and promoting the best content out there . 
  if you just want to scroll forever , you 're better off heading to [ the #gravity - falls tag on tumblr ] ( https://www.tumblr.com/tagged/gravity-falls ) where you can take in all you want . 
  do n't take this as a personal attack . 
  we really do appreciate having fanart posted here ( [ really !, 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/nwcyjsz.png ) ) , it 's just the method that people were n't so keen on . 
  as i said elsewhere in this thread and is explained pretty well on the / r/mlp wiki page i linked , reddit is more about showcasing the best content , rather than lots of it . 
  removed - no social media screenshots ( rule 7 ), 
  it has yet to begin . 
  hold on . 
  yep . 
  mario maker 3ds makes no sense because the 3ds is not perpetually online like the wii u is . 
  if you were to play it anywhere but at home , you 'd be out of luck because you could n't download any levels . 
  perhaps it would be possible to download a bunch while connected to wifi so you can play them later , but that 's extra hassle and makes for a clumsy , unfriendly gaming experience . 
  honestly , no one knows how it works . 
  removed :, 
   it should be easy to tell that your post is gf-related without looking at the title . 
  removed , this is n't your personal blog, 
  i 've been on holiday this past week with no time to check the subreddit , i have no idea what state this place is in right now . 
  removed , no generic reaction gifs, 
  well i 'll take 101, 
  the trailer did n't say , but as they 're still technically ` inkling girl ' , ` inkling boy ' and ` inkling squid ' they probably just do the same stuff as the originals . 
  the amiibo are n't coming until july !, 
  if you 're having fun , keep playing . 
  if you 're not , stop . 
  do what you want . 
  the hunt has n't begun yet , we do n't have all the clues . 
  2016 's worst-kept secret . 
  [ here 's the countdown . 
  ] ( http://itsalmo.st/#billstatuetime ) how time has flown . 
  protip : doing a 180 turn as a squid is very slow , but if you quickly pop up out of squid form , turn around and drop back into squid you can swim away much faster . 
  it would have saved your life here !, 
  we had death ball stuff in the sidebar for a few weeks after that . 
  then we went back to normal . 
  that 's a long time . 
  i do n't know much about the sport , but i 'm pretty sure death ball = riots . 
  rub them for a little bit in the right spot [ like this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bz1zloa.jpg ) , and when you let go they 'll look happy and it says `` they seemed to like that ! '', 
  i was just wondering if there 's actually any point to it . 
  it 's visible in any scene where you can see the inside of her cape ( [ for example ] ( http://i.imgur.com/y4ntbqq.png ) ) . 
  i was struck by space mom 's ogikubo-stealing ship 's resemblance to the [ klk spoilers !, 
  ] ( #s `` giant school robot from the klk ova '' ) http://i.imgur.com/d0blfpg.gifv, 
  yes !, 
  the existing amiibo do bump up the difficulty a little , and it was refreshing to revisit the levels while taking such a different approach . 
  the squid 's limited ink challenges provide no margin for error ( although perhaps that 's cancelled out by how braindead easy the kraken challenges are ... ) . 
  octo valley is easy , but that 's because everyone should be able to complete it . 
  kids play this game too !, 
  these posts would be much more interesting if you provided some reasoning for your one-sentence observations . 
  none of these are secret ... 
  they 're just faces that reflect what you write . 
  my favourite is the face for when you say `` real '' or `` reality '' . 
  nope . 
  they 're pretty worthless . 
  { punching your friends }, 
  i remember being so confused the day this was revealed . 
  i spent the whole day searching for answers about what the wii u actually was , only to settle on `` i * think * it 's a new console ? '', 
  when i spotted the almost-hidden console itself in the background of the trailer things started to make more sense . 
  but it really should n't have taken that much work . 
  ink efficiency main just keeps going and going and going ... 
  the same voice actress ( mayumi shintami ) was also haruko in flcl . 
  she only really lends her voice to shows by gainax & friends , to the point where she 's almost part of their style . 
  the text in the background says `` ultra super anime time . 
  watch space patrol luluco ! '', 
  i have endless love for trigger 's visual gags .

  sure , let 's do it .

  technically they do spread ink , they leave a tiny spot of ink underneath them ... 
  beakons used properly are among the most powerful subs in the game . 
  if you suffer a team wipe , without them you 'd all be sent back to the start while the enemy pushes for a huge advantage . 
  with beakons , you can recover incredibly quickly , keep the pressure on and stop the game from turning against you . 
  \u5c41 - * pi * in [ chinese ] ( http://www.mdbg.net/chindict/chindict.php?page=worddict&amp;wdrst=0&amp;wdqb=%e5%b1%81 ) , * onara * in [ japanese ] ( http://jisho.org/word/%e5%b1%81 ) . 
  it means ` fart ' . 
  you 're right !, 
  it says that on jisho , i just did n't notice . 
  i 'm on it !, 
  any excuse to play more of this absolute treasure of a game . 
  i bought this in a sale a while ago because i liked palutena so much in smash , and good goddess of light i was blown away . 
  as we 're in a time where the much-loved adventure games of old are being re-examined and no longer thought of as being as infallible as we remember , ki : u is a shining example of the kind of adventure game that can be made when the old ideas are built on top of . 
  the mechanics are simple but can take a hundred hours to master , the art and animations are just gorgeous and the whole ( hilarious ) story is told with absolutely minimal cutscenes . 
  you know you 're in for a good game when you press ` start ' on level 1 and are immediately thrown into gameplay . 
  this is what games can be . 
  shipping is weird , and you should n't do it . 
  what the fuc, 
  ` nightbreak ' was chosen as the keyword there because ` daybreak ' comes later ( # 1285 ) . 
  their meanings are very similar though . 
  do n't take heisig 's guidance as the word of god , his method is only designed to give you a rough idea of every character 's meaning so you can tell them all apart . 
  it 's helpful , but far from perfect , so for actual meanings of things you 're better off consulting a dictionary . 
  if you 're doing genki , get [ genki annihilation ] ( http://www.mediafire.com/download/oxj5xcbfxcc9qa5/nayrs_genki_annihilation_-_complete_v1.apkg ) . 
  it helps you revise not only vocabulary , but grammar points too . 
  our dear friend / u/automoderator is missing a flair to call its own . 
  canti the robot from flcl would be a fine mascot .
