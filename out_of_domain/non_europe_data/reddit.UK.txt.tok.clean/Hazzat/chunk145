  yep , in [ the reveal trailer ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vp3cpisobrs ) . 
  they can put on shows for you , including new songs that have n't been heard before . 
  neither of them were helping their team at all . 
  i was thinking the same thing today . 
  i like kiznaiver , but its story is so wonky that i spend most of my time watching it asking `` where is this meant to be going ? '', 
  luluco , like kill la kill , knows exactly what kind of show it is and does it so well . 
  it 's a blast to watch .

  these should n't be too hard to get hold of ( * tentacles crossed * ) . 
  only the alt-colour boy , girl and squid were advertised as being made in ` limited quantities ' . 
  good luck . 
  absolutely . 
  i 'm sticking with it because it 's definitely building towards something cool , even if it takes a few too many detours on the way . 
  a lie on par with `` my dad works at nintendo '' . 
  removed - rule 7 no screenshots, 
  \\* shakes fist *, 
  [ funny you should mention ] ( https://ns.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/4iw8pc/how_to_turn_off_spoiler_tag_css_and_feedback_on/ ), 
   i really doubt it besides some internet fanatical types . 
  that 's kinda the target market for this game though . 
  i 'm not surprised that this is causing upset among people excited * f * or it . 
  retrofuturism is a bit different ( see / r/retrofuturism ) .

  # * do n't lose your waaaaaay *, 
  i never thought i 'd hear that again . 
  it came so out of the blue . 
  i 'm dead . 
  i 'm actually dead . 
  ** please join / r/spacepatrolluluco if you like this show !, 
   i 'm not sure if the klk references were only for this episode, 
  this is the first time they 've been so heavy-handed , but the undertone was always there . 
  the triggerverse is unmistakable . 
  * please join / r/spacepatrolluluco if you like this show !, 
  / r/spacepatrolluluco, 
  i 'm still recovering from laughing so hard . 
  oh my god , trigger . 
  share these with / r/amiibo as well , i 'm sure they 'll love them . 
  nice touch : they changed the tagline on the left to `` my kizna ... big bang '' ( as opposed to the luluco one which says `` my first love ... '' ) . 
  also the title says `` kiznaibabababa '' . 
  emergency maintenance confirmed :, 
  the current one is less distracting and fits the mood better . 
  do n't change it . 
  did you just forget to pick a team ? 
  kill la kill is an absolute treat . 
  just do n't let your parents catch you watching it . 
  [ got ta love it . 
  removed - [ you 're too slow ] ( https://redd.it/4jhf7l ), 
  do n't do that , [ do this ] ( http://themysteryofgravityfalls.com/campaign/ ) . 
  much more effective . 
  removed for being off-topic . 
   it should be easy to tell that your post is gf-related without looking at the title . 
  flipnote studio 3d was finally released in eu recently , so i 've been hooked on it . 
  i removed this because you posted it twice - both from youtube and your own site - making it seem like spam . 
  please review [ reddit 's self-promotion guidelines ] ( https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion ) . 
  the story 's over , friend . 
  i made it all the way up to s 83 before being knocked all the way back down to a 30 ... 
  i 've managed to crawl back up to a + again , but it 's certainly been a lesson in humility . 
  thank you , i 'm doing my best . 
  oh my ex-wife , are those the cory in the house theme lyrics, 
  they 're both alien girls in love with the traveler boy from space .

  the bbc is reporting the closure as [ an effort to save # 15m ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-36308976 ) , rather than a response to complaints . 
  haruko from [ flcl ( fooly cooly ) ] ( http://myanimelist.net/anime/227/flcl ) ( which happens to be my favourite show * ever * ) . 
  i 've removed this for the same reason i removed [ your previous posts ] ( https://redd.it/4jm0fe ) . 
  please let me know you saw my last comment , and i can restore this for you . 
  it 's tomodachi life for 3ds .

  if you [ search for just youtube links ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/tomodachilife/search?q=site%3ayoutube.com&amp;sort=top&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=all ) you 'll find mostly songs .

  [ / r/absolutelynotanime _ irl ] ( http://reddit.com/r/absolutelynotme_irl ), 
  yep , she 's part of [ flcl ] ( #s `` the galactic space police brotherhood '' ) . 
  with all the old trigger/gainax references being thrown around , i 'll be very disappointed if this show ends without a daicon iv moment . 
  in the [ blog post ] ( http://lovelysummerchan.com/post/142235855504/part-time-robot ) announcing the album , she said that she was strongly influenced by her favourite us rock . 
  i 'm sure that 's no coincidence . 
  i can only ask ... how many is he likely to need ? 
  afaik the only way to buy her music is to go to a bricks-and-mortar record shop in japan and pick up a physical copy . 
  i was planning on writing to her soon to say `` hey , you have fans elsewhere ! '', 
  nope . 
  there is [ an official game soundtrack album ] ( http://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/splatune_ ( splatoon_original_soundtrack \\ ) ) though . 
  it 's been a year of nothing less than unrelenting misery . 
  thanks everyone . 
  in this case , the album is an homage to the artist 's favourite us rock songs , which is why the song is in english . 
  i think the way j-pop often drops in random words or phrases because they sound cool can be weird , but that 's not the case here . 
  translation : i said `` thank you for making space patrol luluco !, 
  we have an english fan community here , '' and she replied `` thank you for liking the show so much ! '', 
  everyone i 've ordered from the nintendo uk store has arrived a day or two early . 
  i definitely recommend them if you 're impatient . 
  yeah , the lyrics are in the video !, 
  you just have to look around to find them . 
  i switched computers recently which means i do n't really have access to my old emote-editing tools ( namely photoshop ) . 
  otherwise i 'd totally do it now . 
  removed , keep it in / r/joaje . 
  it still is - amazon says they 're delivering today but they still have n't dispatched it . 
  aaaaghhhhhh whhhyyyyyyyy, 
  it took me two years to finish bravely default because i kept getting distracted by other things ... 
  i 'd stick with it until you reach the end . 
  ^ ( it was totally worth it though because the credits music was so good ), 
  did they ?
