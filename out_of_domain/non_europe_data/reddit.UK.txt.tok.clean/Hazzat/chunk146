  that still shows up if the launch fails . 
  they dispatched it eventually , but now it 's listed as `` arriving tomorrow '' . 
  have i not waited long enough already ; _ ;, 
  confirmed : this show is trigger 's way of celebrating everything they 've made . 
  i love it . 
  ca n't wait for inferno cop planet . 
  my one hope is that they manage to squeeze in a daicon reference at some point . 
  fingers crossed .

  hey , i made a post , uh , [ two weeks ago ] ( https://redd.it/4hyvmi ) ... 
  if you 're a lwa fan you 'd probably get a kick out of the latest luluco ep . 
  it 's trigger being trigger .

  amazing !, 
  what sensitivity do you play on ? 
  your accuracy is so good .

  as someone who is turning 22 and entering the final ( very tough ) year of university later this year , this is my greatest fear . 
  by the end , [ ] ( / s `` everyone was naked and it was n't a big deal '' ) . 
  it 's kinda touching . 
  haaaaaaah , as if . 
  / r/anime _ irl mods do n't let such trivial things get in the way of this important job . 
  not to be a pedant , but it 's `` pedant '' , not `` pendant '' . 
   you may remember me saying that if lebam was in the show , i would 've given up on the show .

  it 's still a turf war favourite , but people worked out long ago that it 's pretty hopeless in ranked . 
  when i was in tokyo in september there was a lot of love live stuff going on , especially in akihabara . 
  some guys were trying to win one of these in a ufo catcher and were having no luck , so i did the smart thing and went and found one in a shop that resells things from ufo catchers . 
  ( i just spent some time on google maps trying to find that particular shop , but i guess i 've forgotten where it was ... ), 
  it looks like amiami and play-asia used to sell them , but they 've been replaced by [ sunny day song flavour ] ( http://www.play-asia.com/love-live-jumbo-nesoberi-plush-nishikino-maki-sunny-day-song/13/709bdf ) and soon [ casual clothes flavour ] ( http://www.amiami.com/top/detail/detail?gcode=goods-00091924 ) .

  grats, 
  i did n't either until i started the game for the first time today !, 
  the opening credits were flashing by and i had to do a double take . 
  that said , i doubt that nintendo characters are ever likely to be set free from their video game existence . 
   splat-tim . wikia.com, 
  why . 
  when i 'm winning : `` yeah , i can go all the way to s + !, 
  bring it on ! '', 
  when i 'm losing : `` forget it . 
  who needs stupid s + anyway , it 's for tryhards . '', 
  somehow , despite the forced logins and the fact that they reduce the video quality to unbearable levels at peak times ( unless you pay for a pro account ) , it 's been japan 's biggest video streaming site for a long time . 
  youtube has only recently managed to catch up . 
  if you go to http://splatpast.com you can see the history of all the rotations , and which stage/mode combinations have been removed . 
  that 's the happiest little accident you ever saw . 
  tbh i think this is the most reposted anime_irl , i see it almost every day, 
  awesome !, 
  i think it would be better without the text , though . 
   choppy, 
  i do n't think you understand editing terms . 
  removed for not being relatable ( rule 5 ), 
  try / r/anmemes / / r/animememes ? 
  i think we 're gon na need to set up a subreddit `` do not post '' list of stuff like this that gets reposted aaaaaall the tiiiiiime, 
  a + -  s is easy peasy . 
  now the game actually begins . 
  / r/learnjapanese can be a real toss up . 
  there are some truly knowledgable and dedicated learners with the patience of saints who are there to help everyone out , but the good advice is so often lost under dumb posts like `` do i really need to learn all this grammar if i just want to watch anime without subs ? '', 
  or `` i bought 50 different textbooks , 10 online subscriptions and i spend all my time reading manga ( in english ) . 
  why are n't i learning faster ? '', 
  worst one i ever saw was [ someone ] ( https://redd.it/3yrqlb ) who wanted a pat on the back for learning hiragana in `` only '' two months ( which , for those who do n't know , is just [ these phonetic characters ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/table_hiragana.svg/2000px-table_hiragana.svg.png ) . 
  they look a little daunting at first , but learning them is step 1 of basic japanese and there are tons of resources online that can help you lock them down in under a week so you can get on to actually studying grammar , and the other 2200 + characters in everyday use ) . 
  just ... learn to streamline . 
  choose one textbook , one revision tool , one kanji method and a way to practise , keep at it on a regular schedule and you 'll be surprised how fast you can progress . 
  surely you were trawling , not trolling ? 
  `` trawling '' is searching thoroughly for something . 
  `` trolling '' is messing with people on the internet . 
  similar sound , but a big difference !, 
  [ no , it 's not ... ] ( http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/trawl ) ( 2nd definition ), 
  although i guess it is by coincidence . 
  the grammar point is about giving negative \u3066-form instructions , and in that particular question the man cries '' \u6b7b\u306a\u306a\u3044\u3067\u304f\u3060\u3055\u3044 \uff01 '', 
  it 's probably necessary to point out : it 's nsfw . 
  that was nonsensical even by imaishi standards . 
  / r/futurefunk, 
  join us . 
  want . 
  everything . 
  please nintendo let us get our western tentacles on this . 
  i was hoping for the [ famicon gun ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-tvlu6jneupq/tgphqqdl-xi/aaaaaaaafkk/jxwkr-2a76q/s1600/lg7.jpg ) , personally . 
  ^ ( that 's the joooooooooke ), 
  i 'm gon na remove this on account of the title alone, 
  i just watched the finale of { neon genesis evangelion } today , and yep this is basically how it went . 
  goddamn shinji, 
  can we just ban the good man thing, 
  this filled me with the same sense of excitement i felt this time last year . 
  gaaahhh , i love splatoon . 
  yep , reddit advertisers can choose to target their ads to subscribers of specific subreddits . 
  the site does n't reach through your browser to get that information though , it 's just stuff related to your account . 
  my jaw is on the floor . 
  the amount of effort and skill that went into crafting these awesome outfits is blowing my mind . 
  alright , i [ submitted the source ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/comments/4lk8jo/the_rise_and_fall_of_nintendos_miitomo_why/ ) instead .
