  ethan and hila ( h3h3 ) are reddit darlings because they 've make a lot of videos that make fun of a lot of youtube 's big egos , video-stealers , bullies and others who are bringing the quality of the site down . 
  this means they 've made a fair number of `` reaction videos '' . 
  as they explain in [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fegvoysbc8w ) , they are currently being sued for copyright infringement by a youtuber called matthosszone/bold guy after they made a reaction video about his work . 
  the wording on the lawsuit was very poorly researched , and h3h3 claim that their video falls under ` fair use ' , which means they are well within their rights to have made their reaction because it was a transformative work . 
  they said they would do their best to fight it without asking for donations , and stand up against the suit alone . 
  long-time youtuber philip defranco stepped in and started a fundraising campaign for them , which has so far raised over $ 150k . 
  h3h3 made [ a follow-up video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ix4mtekl3mm ) to say thank you , and that the funds raised would not only go to them , but towards any other cases fighting for fair use on youtube . 
  the account that holds the money will be called the fair use protection account ( fupa ) and even has [ its own twitter page ] ( https://twitter.com/fupaforfreedom ) . 
  3d animations about 3d animation are a criminally unexplored area , and this one was fantastic . 
  i love how current this feels - it really is only recently that 3d has begun to decouple itself from cartoons , and films like this help the medium to chart its way into the future . 
  awesome work . 
  correct use of a smugface . 
  [ a lot ] ( http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.co.uk/2010/04/alot-is-better-than-you-at-everything.html ) *, 
  i think fates ' characters are a step up from awakening 's . 
  they 're still fairly flat ( for the sake of making writing so many support conversations easier , i guess ) , but at least they do n't each have a single trope which * absolutely must * be brought up every time they speak . 
  most of them still have something like that , but they 're still capable of talking about a variety of things , which makes them feel more like actual people . 
  i have n't finished birthright yet , but i like that there is n't a real enemy . 
  it 's a story closer to real war , where there is n't necessarily ^ * ahem * a black side and a white side . 
  it makes a nice change from ` slay the big evil dragon ' . 
  for those who do n't know , [ hiroyuki imaishi ] ( http://myanimelist.net/people/2349/hiroyuki_imaishi ) is the founder of trigger and director of kill la kill . 
  paris 's japan expo gets a lot of stuff like this . 
  they 've had a lot of official presence from hatsune miku in the past . 
  our closest equivalent in the uk is probably london 's hyper japan expo , who had vocaloid shows from ia and ( unofficially ) miku at the last december one . 
  maybe you can write to their team to see if they can organise a squid sisters event at the next one .

  i had no idea marie had so much popularity over callie !, 
  looks like those of us in the enlightened camp have some work to do if we want to convert the heathens . 
  according to the recent [ subreddit survey ] ( https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1noprdr_1o6vs0rveo06vouslltehz3fyfqa37lk0njk/viewanalytics ) , only 18 % of people here use the analogue sticks . 
  it 's cheaper because if the director decides they want to change the look of the flag patch , they do n't need to make a new one and get the whole gang back on set to re-shoot the scene . 
  instead they just drop the cg artist a memo , and it 'll be fixed within the hour . 
   my only issue is it does n't look like there 's a lot of layers . 
  shoulda equipped an ink efficiency main .

  what recent events ? 
  luluco : `` aaaagghh , it 'll be alright ... 
  i think i 'll get it done in time ... '', 
  midori : `` this week 's episode wo n't be alright . '',

  m.reddit.com has a compact view you can switch to from the menu in the top right , which takes away the huge previews and leaves the site looking more like the desktop version . 
  genki does actually include stuff like this in its `` useful expressions '' section at the end of each chapter . 
  chapter 10 's is all about train lingo . 
  nge episode 23 . 
  specifically the director 's cut version . 
  unless you head up to hokkaido , it 's gon na be hot .

  i thought `` surely this is taken out of context , there 's no way it could be that bad ... '' it was that bad . 
  this is some quality sls . 
  is it [ population density , where yellow/orange are least dense and black/red are most ] ( / answer ) ? 
  after a few too many detouring sub-plots almost killed my interest in this show , this episode has turned it around and got me caring about kiznaiver again . 
  at last they 're returning to what the story is actually about ( what happens when human connections go too deep ) , and it was intense . 
  probably the best-looking episode so far , too . 
  also i ca n't help but wonder if [ this ] ( http://imgur.com/vzxyhax ) was intentional ... 
  i checked and the japanese titles are totally different , so it was likely a coincidence by the localisation people . 
  they both effectively mean `` it 's all over '' . 
  one of the most important qualities looked for in jet applicants is the ability to deal with unexpected circumstances , and roll with whatever punches come along . 
  placement is not random , but as you have little control over it , it may as well be . 
  if you do n't like the idea of having to make the best of whatever you 're given , jet ( and probably japan ) is not for you . 
  the modding api will still be coming `` soon '' .

  i only played uprising fairly recently and would love to watch the shorts again properly . 
  this photo is part of a genre obsessed with consumerism . 
  the bag could n't be more perfectly placed . 
  what other games/genres do you like ? 
  that 's a very very open question ... 
  that said , minecraft is a timeless choice that everyone seems to like . 
  rather appropriately , they announced it on facebook with [ this image ] ( http://i.imgur.com/y7axjco.png ) . 
  i 'd say this feels at home in cyberpunk , vaporwave and outrun .

  nope , theirs is a [ chollima ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/be/fd/8c/befd8ca76355d7629e1524ed2deca008.jpg ) , which is a winged horse . 
  they come from different parts of the world , and have different legends associated with them . 
  they may both be winged horses , but they 're different `` characters '' , i guess . 
  [ the wikipedia page ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chollima ) has a little about its mythology .

  i 'm still in university , graduating next year . 
  this summer 's going to be a combination of japanese study , getting relevant experience and putting writing the best sop possible . 
  i already have lots of ideas about what to include in it , but i 'm putting it off for now so i can include this summer 's activities . 
  october seems a long way off , but i 'm sure it 'll roll around scarily quickly !, 
  i guess you mean [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/amhfywk.png ) ? 
  this album is just of the all-pink reaction faces , so it does n't fit with the rest . 
  haaaaaaah if you think it gets more bearable after this , you 're in for a shock ...
