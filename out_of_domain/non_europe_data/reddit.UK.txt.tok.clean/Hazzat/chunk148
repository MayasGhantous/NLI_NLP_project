  { kiznaiver } has the weirdest episode titles . 
  i keep thinking about this video and whether or not it 's a parody , because surely no one can get that far into japanese class and still be so bad at speaking . 
  either way , it 's cute that the japanese people in the comments are largely supportive of his endeavour . 
  removed , no social media screenshots ( rule 7 ) . 
  it 's cool though .

  removed for breaking most of the rules, 
  the # 1 golden rule for making youtube videos of any kind , is that you should make videos that you would want to watch . 
  too many people make boring , mumbling , rambly videos where not much happens , then wonder why they ca n't hold onto an audience . 
  be funny , be interesting , be a heightened version of yourself . 
  bring something to the table that no one else can . 
  yes !, 
  it 's fun , teaches you the game mechanics , and unlocks weapons that you can take into online matches . 
  splatfest now matches you up with people who are roughly your skill level ( the same `` splatfest power '' ) , so do n't worry about getting crushed by the top players . 
  removed , this is just a link to the tumblr homepage, 
  splatfests are n't on a specific schedule , but it 's likely that the next american one will be announced this weekend . 
  they 're always announced a week in advance . 
  turf war does n't match you up with people around your level , you just get put with everyone . 
  in the ranked modes ( unlocked at level 10 ) , you 'll find more skill-based matchmaking .

  that 's ... an extremely broad question . 
  there is an enormous wealth of resources online that can teach you about the programme , what the application entails and how to boost your chances , and i recommend you go looking for them . 
  ( hint : being resourceful and not needed everything handed to you is a good trait for a jet applicant . ), 
  start with the [ tofugu guide ] ( https://www.tofugu.com/series/jet-program/ ) , watch the [ myargonauts playlist ] ( https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=plcdb0d161c5f6c138 ) and find some jet vloggers/bloggers you trust ( i 'm a fan of [ jessica roh ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/o0pompay0o ) ) . 
  there 's a lot to take in , so begin your research now . 
  as for being fluent in japanese in a year ... lol . 
  i started daily independent study with the genki textbooks about 8 months ago , and all i can do is write some simple blog posts . 
  by all means pick it up as a hobby - it shows a strong interest that will look good on your application . 
  just do n't expect to land in japan this time next year and be able to talk your way around like a true \u65e5\u672c\u4eba . 
  i appreciate the konami code written in chinese . 
  i was thinking of getting a list of common reposts set up that we could link to from the submit page , kinda like [ / r/minecraft 's version ] ( https://redd.it/y3nts ) . 
  we might open it up to everyone so we can get a real comprehensive list . 
  [ well , if you * must * know ... ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/jenkem ), 
  it was a long battle , but we won in the end . 
  all that remains is the tiny / r/joaje community . 
  oh no i have literally done this to people, 
  the same is true in multiplayer - the timer only ticks when the bomb is on the ground . 
  control the area around the zone , and you control the zone ( as long as you remember to ink it ) . 
  as for recommended weapons , my favourites are :, 
  * tri-slosher - activate bubble , dive into the zone and reclaim it before anyone realises what has happened . 
  took me up to s !, 
  * n-zap '89 - fire the inkstrike at the zone , immediately throw a sprinkler into the vortex and the zone is pretty much yours . 
  took me up to s + !, 
  * neon genesis evangelion * + * end of evangelion * . 
  deep , twisted psychological drama disguised as a fighting mech show . 
  congrats to everyone to predicted inferno cop would be making an appearance . 
  he seems to have calmed down a bit in his absence , even if he is only 21 .

  / r/spacepatrolluluco ~, 
  removed for not being anime , try / r/animememes where anything goes . 
  i actually have maid caf\u00e9 picture like this of me_irl ( minus the vape nation ) , it 's around here somewhere . 
  / r/spacepatrolluluco !, 
  i was about 10 when that came out , and i remember getting so excited for the stuff that i 'd ordered to arrive . 
  nowadays i do n't really like game content being time-locked , but the way pok\u00e9mon channel did it made it feel like a story was taking place in real time . 
  also it could give you jirachi for ruby/sapphire !, 
  so it is , and it 's the opening theme no less . 
  ( i did n't know that because i 'm waiting for the ps4 version . 
   i 'm more attached to the characters in luluco with 7-minute episodes and 3-episode seasons than characters in other shows that can go on for ages . 
  lookin ' at you , kiznaiver . 
  super easy to get the hang of . 
  almost everyone here uses the gyro controls , and it 's often the first advice given whenever someone says `` i want to get better . '', 
  and you can turn them off if you do n't like them . 
  removed for being off-topic, 
   over the course of this subreddit 's history , there have been worse shit posts than this . 
  yeah , that 's why we had to bring in rules to crack down on off-topic stuff . 
  `` it should be easy to tell that your post is gf-related without looking at the title '' seems like a fair standard . 
  [ what a shame ] ( https://redd.it/4ngp95 ), 
  i got the link from the [ supercell facebook page ] ( https://www.facebook.com/supercell.jpn/ ) , which i think is official ? 
  they 're not verified , but they do post official-looking announcements . 
  removed for being off-topic . 
  it 's just an [ eye of providence ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eye_of_providence ) . 
  people still jump around with x like crazy , especially in the higher ranks . 
  people used to bring aerosprays into ranked . 
  they do n't anymore . 
  just straight up jumping wo n't help you much , but weaving while doing it and popping in and out of squid form makes you really hard to hit and is pretty much necessary against shooter weapons in s/s + . 
  the trade-off is that it becomes harder to aim , too . 
  yes , that 's why it 's in the sidebar, 
  the sidebar is a little bloated these days , i agree . 
  my opinion of kiznaiver so far is that it 's a total mess . 
  it started off strong with a concept full of potential ( what happens when human connections are forced too deep ? 
  ) , but it quickly lost the plot through off-topic detours . 
  after the set-up , suddenly everyone landed in summer camp , then forget everything because one of the characters was a manga artist so let 's look at only that for a few episodes ... ep11 made progress to bring everything back on track , but the love square/pentagon was still largely an asspull that came out of nowhere . 
  the characters themselves are cardboard cut-out tropes that seem to have been pulled randomly from a hat . 
  i think their designs are so mismatched that they all look like they walked out of different shows when they stand next to each other . 
  the whole production is just so wonky that i can not take anything seriously . 
  luluco , by comparison , knows exactly what kind of show it wants to be , and goes all out with a laser-sharp focus . 
  it would have been easy for it to be a totally * random * show about * random * things happening , but the whole thing has been carefully constructed to balance the wacky hijinks with a fairly simple , touching story . 
  it 's a lot of fun to watch , and it leaves something to think about between episodes . 
  that 's why i like it so much . 
  i guess i care about this a lot because i was expecting great things from kiznaiver , and it let me down . 
  nope , [ i pulled it off ] ( https://miiverse.nintendo.net/posts/ayqhaaabaacnukfqaukikg ) just the other day . 
  cinema4d , octane render ( according to the instagram tags ) . 
  is this actually simulated ? 
  i 'm sure it would be easier done with blend shapes . 
  removed for not being anime, 
  to be fair , it 's a skate park , and most skate parks i 've seen are attached to parks just like this . 
  removed for being off-topic .
