   it should be easy to tell that your post is gf-related without looking at the title . 
  well , if you started now you 'd still have a great time !, 
  splatfests , updates , an active community that 's still very healthy ... 
  by christmas ? 
  there will probably still be a lot of people around , but it 's difficult to predict exactly what the community will look like . 
  none of this was really cringy , it was just either bad or weird to the point of absurdity . 
  yes . 
  could be michael . 
  could be archibald . 
  could be anything . 
  could be roderick . 
  could be frank . 
  could be anything . 
  15 mins of fluff and titanfall 2 , half an hour of trying to get nerds excited about sports games , then 15 minutes of star wars and battlefield . 
  zac efron was there too . 
   literally every other splatfest, 
  well , no . 
  rollercoasters/waterslides , north pole/south pole , marshmallows/hot dogs , eating/sleeping etc. 
  plus most of the japanese ones . 
  i think the original plan was to only have them available during the run-up to the relevant splatfest so they become like a rare collectable , but that seems to have been dropped with the more recent ones . 
  regardless , you 'll solve nothing by making a post like this . 
  for subreddit-related matters , it 's always better to [ message the moderators ] ( https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2fsplatoon ) . 
  oh god , this is the town my university is in . 
  this is pretty much par for the course for hatfield ... 
  [ ] ( #dipponder ) technically if it was sun-bleached , the warm colours would be gone and only blue would remain . 
  breath of the wild ... 
  breath of fresh air . 
  in the gameplay , it was labelled as the temple of time , not hyrule castle . 
  the guardian will need a room to itself . 
  [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8f2rzolgto ) is a great example of what a self-introduction can look like .

  yes :, 
   all posts must be directly related to gravity falls , and sfw . 
  it should be easy to tell that your post is gf-related without looking at the title . 
  this is just a triangle with a circle inside it , it 's hardly gf-related . 
  the rule is important if we want to survive as a healthy community into the future . 
  just after the show ended we had a string of random off-topic and really terrible quality stuff hit the # 1 spot on the subreddit , and every time it happened we lost a fair number of subscribers . 
  people thought `` show 's over , it 's just gon na be memes and triangles now so i should probably unsubscribe '' . 
  that 's not true though - there 's still plenty of high-quality stuff coming through and we need to make sure it does n't get buried under stuff that 's barely-related if we want to survive . 
  / r/joaje exists if you want lower standards !, 
  the [ rewatch ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/gravityfalls/comments/463fyo/as_you_probably_know_most_tv_show_subreddits_die/ ) is planned . 
  we stopped cracking down on `` low quality '' stuff a while ago ( which in practice was only directed at ` joaje ' content , because there was waaaaay too much of that ) . 
  now the only criteria for being gf-related is a clear , direct connection to gf somewhere in the post . 
  so yeah , if you 'd included a picture of bill saying hi ( or whatever ) to his effigy here , that would have been fine . 
  it seems nitpicky , but when it comes to writing up rules a line has to be drawn somewhere , and i think where we chose to put it is pretty fair . 
  that used to be the case ( / r/reddittimelords used and abused that feature to make the most of it ) , but then there was an update and now threads older than 6 months are completely locked . 
  alex is n't here . 
  it 's definitely a weird one for existing anime fans . 
  it airs after 10pm and does n't get the big billboards that kiznaiver does . 
  i quite like it being our obscure little secret . 
  yes !,

  i usually put the discussion thread up about 10 minutes before it starts , in case you 're wondering . 
  as great as that would be , i would n't count on it . 
  that said , there 's always the chance of an extended finale , [ inferno cop style ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mkhzol29mq ) . 
  that was just a one-off thing for miitomo 's promotion . 
  as the latest one was eu only , it 's likely that they 'll go back to regional again from now on . 
  if you 're bouncing back and forth around a certain rank , congrats , you 've found your rank !, 
  enjoy playing against perfectly skill-matched players . 
  holy cow , this person is good at drawing on-model . 
  that 's amazing quality . 
  it just feels a little strange that dipper slides back before bill 's arm touches him , but that 's bill logic i guess .

  the weapons you get from the amiibo are just recolours of the splattershot , splat charger and splat roller . 
  you do n't need the amiibo to unlock weapons like the aerospray and dynamo roller .

  enjoy it while it lasts !, 
  depends how you want to play it . 
  wii u is probably the better choice due to it being easier to play multiplayer , but 3ds lets you play wherever . 
  removed, 
  the sunken scrolls you pick up after each boss unlocks a weapons you can take into multiplayer . 
  specifically , the ( * copy/pasted from inkipedia * ) custom splattershot jr. , kelp splat charger , aerospray mg , aerospray rg , and aerospray pg , new squiffer , dynamo roller , gold dynamo roller , and tempered dynamo roller . 
  it 's called a reference in the uk application process , but letter of recommendation in the us one . 
  also the personal statement is called the statement of purpose in the us . 
  different terms , basically the same thing !,

  regarding off-topic posts , where do you draw the line ? 
  there are a fair few posts that have a splatoon-ish title , but the actual contents are completely unrelated ( [ example ] ( https://redd.it/4oknz0 ) ) . 
  would you still count these as being on-topic ?

  you could start self-studying now , as it 's far enough in advance and you ( probably ) have the motivation from the trip . 
  the [ / r/learnjapanese wiki ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/learnjapanese/wiki/index ) is a good place to start . 
  comments here have told me japanese proficiency does n't count for much on the application and it only gives you a few extra points in the case of a tiebreaker - after all , you 're not going to use it on the job .
