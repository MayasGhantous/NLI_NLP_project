  nope ( but , of course , it 's strongly recommended because it 's a brilliant mod ) .

  well , lego has pirates of the caribbean now . 
  it 's not quite a lego knock-off , but [ k'nex got mario kart ] ( http://www.knex.com/mariokartwii/ ) . 
  `` thank you '', 
  it 's undoubtedly an incredible piece of art , but it does n't make me go `` aww '' ... 
  i ca n't handle it, 
  help, 
  please, 
  this is too cute, 
  aaagghhh, 
  i ca n't help but feel that it would be really cute if the baby animals did trip over every now and again ... 
  * d'awww *, 
  that 's [ traditional beauty ] ( http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/318085-64xv14x-traditional-beauty-with-pocket-edition/ ) . 
  / r/vocaloid maybe ? 
  it 's likely they 've seen it before though . 
  you finally got your pigman vilagers ^ maybe !, 
  i do n't know ... 
  i did some research and found the big list of anime-related subreddits , but as far as i can tell there does n't seem to be anywhere appropriate there . 
  maybe there 's a gap in the market !, 
  you 're right !, 
  it 's [ r3d craft ] ( http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1182714-145-32x-64x-128x-256x-512x-r3dcraft-default-realism-65-done/ ) , i 'm sure of it . 
  give them time , we 'll get those red dragons one day ... 
  [ ] ( / raritynews ) now now , let 's not get too carried away . 
  man , the lack of question marks here really bothers me . 
  i ca n't help but feel that it would be more accurate if they got scared and ran away , dogs and cats especially . 
  i agree that would be nice to have * some * reaction towards fireworks . 
  but ... but ... steve has n't had a beard in over a year !, 
  in case you 're wondering dear comment-reader , theyellowk123 originally expressed excitement for features seen in the lastest snapshots but edited their comments to just '' :d '' when they realised they were foolish . 
  nope !,

  [ here 's that ashleigh ball interview .

  no , no , no , you 've got it all in the wrong order . 
  step 1 is to cut a hole in the box . 
   what does a normal person do then ? 
  put some random gibberish , like : nsdkfhseruiewtrv q74tr 4ry -4 r yert gt0784y3 into these fields to never be bothered again with hax0rz trying to guess their answers . 
  this seems like like the fault is with you , not with mojang . 
  they put security measures in place , you 're too lazy to fill them in and complain that the measures were too complicated when your account is compromised . 
  ^ edit : ^ typo, 
  with the animated textures in vanilla on the way , i 'd expect to see a lot more of that . 
  that kinda defeats the point , does n't it ? 
  if you give them both luck , it cancels itself out . 
  hmm . 
  [ ] ( / twisquint ), 
   you need to make an eye of ender in order to help you find a stronghold . 
  you 'll probably need to make quite a lot , it depends how far away the stronghold is from where you start . 
  you can take screenshots in the xbox version . 
  i do n't have it , but a quick google search tells me you need to pause the game and press y.

  i put the ^ new !, 
  there because they were really only just added . 
  by which i mean today or yesterday or something . 
  very recently . 
  amended !, 
  they are now in the `` yogscast family '' list on the bluexephos channel , that 's as official as it gets . 
  it makes sense too , given that they have made several appearances in yogscast videos , most recently during the christmas livestreams . 
  incredible work !, 
  i would expect no less from sethbling . 
  do n't forget that zombies drop iron too now .

  dontgoatsemebro was quoting the song playing in the background , the lyrics for which you can find [ here ] ( http://artists.letssingit.com/david-guetta-lyrics-sexy-bitch-feat-akon-wh8j7wp ) . 
  edit : oops i linked to a picture of a pony instead of the lyrics , that could have gone horribly wrong,

  [ you 're too slow !, 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/mylittlepony/comments/16ijlt/kindness_original_mlp_music_by_acoustimandobrony/ ), 
  reading this made me feel fairly uncomfortable . 
  ( also , see rule 1 of the subreddit . ), 
  implying being shown nothing but he-man for the rest of your days is a bad thing ? 
  the article says that `` distant future '' just means anything without a release window yet . 
  it does n't necessarily mean that the game is ages away ( hopefully ) .
