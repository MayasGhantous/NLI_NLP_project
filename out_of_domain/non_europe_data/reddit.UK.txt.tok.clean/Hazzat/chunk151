  i mean , it does n't take that much to set one up , right ? 
  big open spaces make it a joy with the ol' ink/octobrush . 
  for anyone else who got here too late after the video was removed , [ here is `` inkopolis plaza '' ] ( http://v.youku.com/v_show/id_xmtyxodgwmtewma==.html ) and [ here is `` turf war '' ] ( http://a.9game.cn/bzty/962145.html ) . 
  it starts on july 22nd ... so you have until then . 
  oh my zapfish , i 'm in love with the neutral splatfest one . 
  it seems every day more nightmares become a little closer to reality . 
  i just realised that this is why the callie & marie amiibo will turn the plaza into splatfest mode - after this , it 's the only way you 'll get to see it like that . 
  i do n't think gfc is actually expecting it to happen , but is just saying what it would take . 
  there are crazy collectors in every fandom who are willing to shell out money like that .

  we do n't know . 
  well yeah , but it 's the closest we 're gon na get . 
  was it a car or a cat i saw ? 
  that would n't work because the design on the tee only shows up to people in your region ( probably for advertising reasons ) . 
  splatoon is a really bare-bones experience . 
  it has everything it needs to be a fun game , but the design philosophy behind it was to keep everything very simple to make it as polished and accessible as possible . 
  as a result , there 's a lot of scope for new features in future instalments . 
  but then it 's like he 's giving you 30,000 gold every time , which is a far cry from the ~ 1,000 he gives now .

  this comment made me realise what a rollercoaster we 're about to embark on .

  that link will expire quickly because it 's 4chan , so [ here 's an imgur version ] ( http://i.imgur.com/gawvaqk.jpg ) . 
  i 'll probably be playing less , because all the milestones have come around the same time . 
  i hit level 50 , i got to s + ( briefly : / ) and now updates are ending ... 
  i 've given this wonderful game like 400 hours , i wo n't feel guilty if i move on to something else . 
  the piece of trivia that it 's almost mandatory to include about this location is that it inspired the forest of * princess mononoke * . 
  single player final boss battle . 
  dj octavio comes with stage hazards built-in !, 
  that whole sequence is a gag based on the ` bootstrap paradox ' , which is a hypothetical idea about creating information ( in this case the vending machine trick ) out of nothing . 
  suspend your disbelief . 
  oh good , so it 's not just me . 
  the ebb and flow of the wind here is awesome , it really feels alive .

   it 's his sub, 
  you 're giving the guy too much credit . 
  the fact that they were the first person to type `` cinematography '' into the create-a-subreddit box should n't mean it 's their community - it belongs to the people who built it up . 
  it 's a shame that / u/lkmeq does n't realise that . 
  boy am i glad we never let / r/gravityfalls turn into this ... 
  joaje 'd outta nowhere . 
  i 'm not even mad . 
  there was a reason you got downvoted when you posted this the first time ... 
  uh , the entire north-west area of the united states ( including oregon ) and part of canada is called the [ pacific northwest ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pacific_northwest ) . 
  that 's a pretty broad search area , to say the least ...

  yes , because tower control makes me want to die . 
  they 're having a luluco event , more pics here :,

  the jet programme is a specific teaching-english programme run by the japanese government . 
  sweden is not a participating country ( [ as listed here ] ( http://jetprogramme.org/en/countries/ ) ) so it 's not an option for you . 
  it 's possible , although a bit more difficult , for non-native english speakers to get a job teaching english . 
  it 's not so much due to your ability , but more because the `` native speaker '' badge is something schools , particularly eikaiwas , like to promote . 
  if you 're proactive and go googling , you 'll find lots of resources answering your question , like [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xi9i24ctmli ) . 
  it 's good to see that you do n't consider english-teaching an end goal . 
  it can be a great stepping stone to other things , but it 's hardly a `` career '' and there is little room for advancement . 
  you 've got a few years to go before you 're even able to consider it , so i 'd recommend that you shelve the idea for now , continue to focus on whatever it is you 're studying as best you can , then re-examine tefl as an option closer to graduation . 
  keep all your options open !, 
  alt means ` assistant language teacher ' , and alt positions , such as those offered by jet , interac , ~ ~ gaba ~ ~ etc. 
  are all in actual schools with kids . 
  alts work alongside the school 's english teacher during classes to provide additional english help , as well as a cultural exchange aspect . 
  ` english conversation ' ) are private english school companies that offer english lessons to anyone who wants to pay for them . 
  depending on the company , you could be teaching adults , kids or both . 
  without a teaching qualification , you 'll be stuck in alt/eikaiwa positions forever , or at least until you transition out of english teaching . 
  if you want to make teaching a career , you 'll need to become qualified as a teacher ( advisably in your own country ) before anything like that opens up to you . 
  that depends , are you a kid or a squid ?

  ... is n't think just common sense on how to behave outside ? 
  here 's a great video demoing a self-introduction : https://youtu.be/aufe76tpuzq, 
  jessica ( the youtuber ) has a lot of other videos of jet lessons on her channel , which i think are all really interesting . 
  someone here sussed it out , [ here 's the details ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/splatoon/comments/4rqn2h/information_on_the_new_squidgod_bugglitch/ ) .

  it generally works .

  why not ? 
  the more people get drawn into the pok\u00e9mon world , the better it is for us all . 
   it will be available in other countries around the world in the days ahead . 
  they can barely handle the game 's popularity as it is , i do n't think they 're in a rush to open it up to even more millions of players . 
  yeah , that 's [ the actual reason ] ( http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2016/07/pokemon_go_global_rollout_delayed_while_niantic_fixes_server_woes ) the game has been delayed elsewhere . 
  yeah it sucks for everyone and shame on niantic for not being prepared , but they got caught short and this is the best they can do to avoid even more problems . 
  on the plus side , when it does eventually drop over here , it * should * be issue-free . 
  the samurai of the internet age , they scour reddit and beyond to find the most stupid and ignorant things people have to say about japan , and call it out , laugh at it , or just despair . 
  it 's a job that someone 's got ta do , because people say a lot of dumb stuff .
