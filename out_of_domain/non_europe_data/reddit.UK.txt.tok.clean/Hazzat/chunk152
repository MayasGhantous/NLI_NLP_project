  well , we know [ it was like this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaxfb4yts1m ) . 
  it looks like it was very similar story-wise , but went through a lot of design changes . 
  we already have / r/silphroadukandireland ... 
  we got trolled . 
  removed for being off-topic , this is not your personal blog . 
  there 's a [ funny story ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruzoig9py_c ) about people doing that for websites in the 2000s . 
  i 'll be there on saturday , here 's hoping the game is actually released by then . 
  i 'd love to see people go nuts over a lure .

  never ever just `` let the votes decide '' on a big subreddit , or you 'll quickly drown under a flood of tired reposts and played-out memes . 
  a good marker for quality that we use on / r/gravityfalls is `` it should be easy to tell that it 's subreddit-related without looking at the title '' . 
  so people ca n't post any ol' reaction gif with ` mrw my battery runs out ' - it really has to be on-topic . 
  we found ourselves removing a lot of posts to begin with , but after a while the community understood what kind of subreddit we want to be and readjusted . 
  also move questions into their own subreddit . 
  that way they can get the attention they need , and they do n't bury anything that 's actually worth sharing . 
  this sub really does collect the worst evangelion content . 
  here 's [ the bookmark page ] ( https://supermariomakerbookmark.nintendo.net/courses/8175-0000-026b-75e0 ) !, 
  did you link the wrong thing ? 
  get in the goddamn gunmorphing suit , luluco . 
  there are no uk servers . 
  the game is n't officially out here yet ( * grates teeth * ) , so they 're under no obligation to support us . 
  that said , this is n't a uk issue , and the servers are dodgy for everyone . 
  / r/saltoon, 
  the cheap tactics can become grating , but it 's so satisfying to play around them and succeed . 
  one player really can turn the whole game around . 
  also my salt levels dropped by 33 % when i vowed to never play tower control again . 
  that mode really is about being cheap . 
  after they took the opening off youtube , this is the only place i know where i can listen to it . 
  probably never at this rate, 
  removed , no social media screenshots ( rule 7 ), 
  did you literally not read the big blue text on [ the submission page ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/gravityfalls/submit ), 
  yep !, 
  splatfests are fun , but they do n't make the game . 
  / r/wiiu just had [ a discussion ] ( https://redd.it/4s5euf ) about this . 
  / r/apicem is beautiful , but it 's not hotline miami-esque at all and does n't fit here . 
  clean contemporary style and the 80s-like outrun look are pretty far from each other . 
  also the enormous header is like a joke , it 's so big . 
  removed because anime is real but this is not anime, 
  removed for not being relatable ( rule 5 ), 
  ... is what i 've been telling myself for the past few days . 
  there is n't a confirmed release date for anything . 
  even the game 's initial release was a surprise . 
  it 's the same in the 3ds games , pikachu is the only pok\u00e9mon that actually says its name . 
  tomorrow could be a fairly safe bet , but we really have no idea . 
  just try to put it out of your mind and let it surprise you .

  removed , sorry but no leaks allowed here !, 
  ok i was wrong before , * this * is the most reposted image we get, 
  oh and honestly , sharing this is really a jerk move . 
  solving all this together will be our last big event as a fandom , and having everything potentially solved before the book even comes out would totally suck . 
  yeah we knew this already . 
  they 're based on ingress portals , and submissions closed for those in september last year . 
  at last !, 
  i can finally stop staring at [ this page ] ( http://ispokemongooutintheuk.co.uk ) !, 
  i 'm impressed by the number of guys in shirts and suits i 've seen running about today !, 
  this really appeals to everyone . 
  is n't this a complaint form for removing pok\u00e9stops ? 
  all the drop-down options seem to imply that .

  priceless . 
  [ here 's an explanation ] ( http://redd.it/4smfg8 ) of the situation in korea . 
  it 's a bit crazy !, 
  buying albums of nudie pictures of cd-roms ? 
  the noughties were another time , alright . 
   this is the splattershot . 
  it 's a shooter with balanced attack power , range and fire rate ... 
  wait , these are real photos ? 
   the squid world 's weapons have been reproduced as water pistols , and they are on sale at sunart . 
  this summer , the turf war is at the poolside !, 
  there 's nothing on the [ sunart website ] ( http://sunart-corp.com/php/products/detail.php?num=52 ) yet , but i 'm sure the international resellers will have it up for the world to buy pretty soon . 
  removed for being off-topic, 
  it 's a level 3 gym , so there 's more than that to get through . 
  i did n't have time to take screenshots of the more powerful foes though . 
  i decided to head to westminster in the spur of the moment to see who was in charge , and made it just in time ... 
  there were a bunch of lures going around the london eye but i could n't stop to check them out !, 
  i was gon na join instinct , but the gym just around the corner from my house is consistently yellow so i wanted to start a rivalry . 
  i 'm more interested in how well sad machine mixes into pipo password ... 
  turn up the lights ( or exposure ) !, 
  it 's so dim . 
  surely it 's * upon * us ? 
  firstly , do your textbook exercises . 
  all of them . 
  if you 've been through a grammar point once really thoroughly , it 'll stick for a long time . 
  your future self will be grateful if you 're not lazy about it . 
  if you do n't have opportunities to use the language day-to-day , the best way to put what you 've learned into practice is to join a language exchange site like lang-8 , hellotalk , italki etc. 
  if there 's a particular thing you 're not sure how to say , you can give it a go and get corrected if you screw up without any shame , because everyone 's there to learn . 
  putting example sentences into anki flashcards can be helpful too , although it 's second-best to a variety of actual materials .

  we thought about post flairs a while ago , but they seemed a bit cluttery and unnecessary . 
  we 're up for looking at it again though . 
  removed, 
  please go away, 
  new headcanon , morty from rick & morty is actually dipper after he returned home and mabel went off to boarding school or whatever . 
  8 ball does n't have horns ... maybe he 's still young and has yet to grow them . 
  yep it 's gone, 
  amazing composition !, 
  it always bugs me how gyarados does n't fit on the screen . 
  if the subreddit had a welcome message , this would be it .
