  ~ ~ there 's no publicly available list of where everyone is placed . ~ ~ the closest thing is [ this crowdsourced map ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=182shwclimcqvhr4c7ugpuapigti ) which includes both alts and cirs , but is far from comprehensive . 
  the beacon of hope in the dark selhurst evenings ... that 's what it felt like anyway . 
  the question is , do i dare open the poor town i have n't touched for two years ? 
  if you keep it held in a loop , will it ever stop ? 
  removed for not being relatable, 
  please do n't get confrontational when people are trying to help . 
  a good way to approach it is to learn to * read and write * the ones at the back of the book , but only learn to * read * the ones in the vocabulary list at the front . 
  it can seem difficult at first , but if you start using flashcards you 'll find you pick up kanji readings pretty quickly . 
  you 're better off posting this somewhere like [ lang-8 ] ( http://lang-8.com/ ) , which is built for language corrections . 
  this sounds amazing !, 
  [ we control the balls ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v53z_6rwunm ), 
  it remains a mystery !, 
  what about the letters in red ? 
  statue is in russia confirmed, 
  it 's args on args . 
  the future is now .

  you ca n't trust [ those japanese bears ] ( http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/613/025/b64.jpg ) . 
  he was just referencing [ this ] ( http://khairopati.com/pokehelpr/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/07/pokemon-go-loading-screen.png ) . 
  that would be insanely generous though . 
  you 're currently given 1,400 max per rotation for doing well , sp getting even one sea snail worth 30,000 would be a huge jump . 
  removed because memes, 
   cartoon network, 
  are you * sure * this is anime, 
  gravity falls is never coming back . 
  removed , not relatable and no social media screenshots, 
  yeah reaction gifs fall under the ` memes ' category . 
  this is n't technically off-topic because the page has ` gravity falls ' written on it , but we could do without generic reaction gifs . 
  i said never, 
  it 's right at the top of the subreddit , not sure how you missed it, 
  i even got reported a couple of times too !, 
  oh boy , / r/gravityfalls is trending again !, 
  for those wondering why , the show 's creator is currently orchestrating a worldwide arg themed around the villain bill cipher . 
  there are plenty of clues and cryptograms involved , so people are gathering in the subreddit to solve the mystery . 
  looking at [ the traffic stats ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/gravityfalls/about/traffic/ ) , it 's pretty clear why . 
  the map they posted has the pins placed really inaccurately . 
  the japan pin is in hokkaido for example , when the clue was in tokyo . 
  the world 's ugliest collectibles, 
  if only there was [ somewhere you could read all the details ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/gravityfalls/comments/4tte1f/cipher_hunt_megathread/ ) ... 
  [ yes ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/gravityfalls/comments/4u1rfe/were_a_trending_subreddit_today_thanks_cipher/ ), 
  a few people tried to jump the gun and go wandering in random oregon forests to find the statue , as it was hinted at in the final episode . 
  at the time that we did n't have all the clues , but now the hunt has officially begun they 're all coming out . 
  as a moderator , it 's your job to shape a community into the kind of environment you want it to be . 
  if you think toxic comments and arguments have no place in it , then it 's absolutely right to shut them down . 
  exactly !, 
  i have a few collectible things , mainly amiibo , and they 're a nice reminder of the things i like and why i like them . 
  i ca n't imagine anything less appealing than seeing my favourite characters reduced to a dead , bug-eyed stare and a wooden , neutral pose . 
  removed for not being relatable ( rule 5 ), 
  it 's not * that * hard to add something like this as an alternate subreddit theme ... [ message the mods ] ( https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2fsplatoon ) and maybe they will do it . 
  or maybe not . 
  the pins are all super innacurate , do n't take it too seriously . 
  it 's in the sidebar, 
  which is no good if all the local gyms are full lf hypnos too ... 
  removed for being off-topic, 
  little correction : booyah base is the building that houses all the shops . 
  the plaza itself is just called inkopolis plaza . 
  it 's not over , this one 's going for 48 houuuurss wooooooo, 
  also / r/saltoon, 
  you could say it comes from the bright glowing wristband . 
  the map is old and more pins have been added , and a couple of pins there are very inaccurate anyway . 
  the oregon clue is marked as washington , the tokyo one is hokkaido etc. 
  [ current state of the puzzle !, 
  i 'm not there , these are pictures from [ may ] ( https://twitter.com/omgmei ) who is sharing them with the discord . 
  [ it 's at the top of the sticky comment here .

  send them your puzzle tips !, 
  there probably are n't many people up that end of the bell curve ...

  because it 's the same winning formula all over again !, 
  [ yeaaaahhh !!, 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/gravityfalls/comments/4u1rfe/were_a_trending_subreddit_today_thanks_cipher/ ) although i wonder for how much longer , because it 's been well over 24 hours now . 
  maybe they forgot to replace the list today . 
  you 're imagining it . 
  i double-checked the moderation log and nothing like that happened . 
  pushing the price of the console up is very against the `` play is for everyone '' nintendo ethos . 
  do n't bother . 
  alex has said it 's much more effective to go into a disney store and ask for it , because they keep track of that . 
  far from it , there 's still plenty of life left in this funny game .

  also , removed for being off-topic , this is n't your personal blog . 
  imo , best solution is to complete it , maybe frame it , and sell it off for charity . 
  everyone wins . 
  she deserved to win something i guess ... 
  could n't you have turned the lights on or tidied up first ? 
  the picture just says `` thank you !! '', 
  the tweet says that even though the splatfests are over , callie & marie are still smiling . 
  the other battles will continue , and the squid research lab will continue researching . 
  stay tuned !, 
  it 's got ta be snails . 
  such is the shrouded mystery that is the japanese language .
