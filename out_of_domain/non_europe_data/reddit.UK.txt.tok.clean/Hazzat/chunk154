  i like the eu one , because in some places it feels like noa went * too * far . 
  spyke 's weird cockney impression is one , for example .

  thanks !, 
  any direct translation of \u8ecc\u8de1 felt a bit awkward to put in a snappy title , so i went with `` memories '' . 
  for others reading , the meaning of \u8ecc\u8de1 ( * kiseki * ) is more like `` the path that was taken '' . 
  does it actually slow the servers ? 
  i know the amount of particles can drop the frame rate sometimes , but i 've never noticed any latency as a result of a bomb rush . 
  yes , this is a new change as of today . 
  with sea snails now harder to come by , they 've made it easier to earn money instead . 
  this is referring to volume 1 of the splatoon manga : http://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/splatoon_ ( manga ),

  they do n't show up if they 're hiding in ink ... 
  [ that 's my grunkle . 
  my prediction : at least one spin-off , probably for 3ds , before the real spla2n lands in 2018 . 
  keeps the brand alive while not spewing out a sequel unnecessarily soon . 
  developers said in interviews that the inklings can do more than just turf war , so i fully expect them to bring some other ideas to life . 
  you are wrong, 
  / r/gravityfalls drama spelling over into / r/anime _ irl ? 
  never thought i 'd see the day . 
  nope . 
  you normally have until the next splatfest is announced to pick up your shells or else they get wiped , but as there wo n't be a ` next splatfest ' you can leave it forever . 
  i guess you just imagined hitting king/queen ... ? 
  the sun has set on another day , and @joeykarwal on twitter is currently looking after the puzzle . 
  they plan to work on it through the night .

  yeah , we had it already : https://redd.it/4ucrmb,

  \u5947\u8de1 ( also read * kiseki * ) means ` miracle ' . 
  same sound , different characters , different meaning . 
  japanese has a lot of these .

  for those unaware , paul robertson did all the pixel art animation on gravity falls . 
  he created both rumble mcskirmish and . giffany . 
  that 's like asking `` should i watch gravity falls even though all the mysteries have been solved ? '', 
  ( the answer to that is yes . ), 
  false positive, 
  how are / r/lost , / r/firefly , / r/seinfeld , / r/scrubs , / r/killlakill , / r/breakingbad etc. 
  still alive even though their shows ended long ago ? 
  they built a community who still find fan work to share and stuff to talk about . 
  it 's not like a community immediately dies the day of a final episode . 
  in fact , that 's the day we received the highest number of new subscribers !, 
  also the recent [ cipher hunt ] ( http://gravityfalls.wikia.com/wiki/cipher_hunt ) was something to talk about .

  when france 's abilities are all cultural , having a military leader seems strange . 
  r/anime _ irl, 
  it 's really meant to be detective-themed , which is why its name is gumshoos and the fur shape resembles a trenchcoat .

  why so blue ? 
  of course - he came as a designer , so he takes great care to describe very minute things . 
  he travels by steam train and horse-and-cart rather than shinkansen and metro , and sees a fair number of customs which are fading today . 
  i thought it was worth reading just to see that while many things have changed , a lot really has stayed the same . 
  i think excitement leads some people to micromanage every little thing , and when they realise `` oh !, 
  i 've never used chopsticks before ! '', 
  it seems like a huge , potentially trip-ruining issue and they come running here . 
  newcomers can need some help putting everything in perspective . 
  `` if they could manage it 140 years ago , so can you ! '', 
  it will probably be a good deal , but you can use [ hyperdia ] ( http://www.hyperdia.com/en/ ) to calculate and work it out for sure . 
  some more !, 
  visiting the fish market :, 
   * the fire being out , i sallied forth to inspect the native fish market , for it was now seven o'clock in the morning . 
  here i saw piles of octopuses ; some heaps being of reddish hue , while others were of leaden aspect , but the tentacles of these strange creatures gave the heaps a look of motion and life , which , to say the least , was strange . 
  here are also bivalve molluscs , ten inches in length , which i can only regard as over-grown mussels , large creatures of the shark character , some ten feet in length , and in a tub live fish , including the royal tai ; while on tables and stalls are ranged some of the oddest monsters which i ever saw offered for food in any land . 
  other tourists being rude :, 
   * when out shopping , i was sometimes surprised to see men who , i was told , were english merchants , walk in with their great boots on , and stamp over the floor as though it were their purpose to destroy the mats . 
  the anxiety of the poor shopkeepers under such circumstances was quite distressing , and i have seen a bit of drugget , a common blanket , and other things hastily brought and spread over the mats , to prevent their being ruined by these ungainly visitors . 
  no one , i fear , can visit japan without perceiving the heartlessness of many of the so-called foreign merchants , and, 
  none are worse in this respect than my own countrymen . 
  some appear to find special enjoyment in annoying the japanese . 
  foreigners, 
  often speak to the japanese as if they were altogether inferior creatures ; and if of low class they sometimes treat them as though they were dogs and not men . 
  such persons do incalculable harm to the country from which they hail , as it is they who make the stranger odious . 
  someone reported the / u/roboragi reply with a link to a picture of boobs . 
  that 's a first . 
  yep , this bit jumped out because i 'd read so many similar comments across the japan subreddits . 
  this just shows that it 's not a product of our time , and there have always been ignorant people . 
  paul robertson , who did all the pixel art for it , still keeps [ his tumblr ] ( http://probertson.tumblr.com/ ) updated and he 's only got better . 
   if you lose a gym battle , you do n't lose anything . 
  you lose the revives and potions you need to give it another go .
