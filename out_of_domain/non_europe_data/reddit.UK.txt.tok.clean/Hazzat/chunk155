  you wrote [ \u99ac\u5834 ] ( #fg '' \u3070\u3070 '' ) , which has quite a different meaning . 
  you 've got the experience , you just have to justify to yourself and the application people why jet is right for you , and why you 're right for jet . 
  they 'll be expecting to see you answer 1 ) ` why you ? ', 
  2 ) ` why japan ? ', 
  and 3 ) ` why jet ? ', 
  if you 've got good answers for all those , you should be golden .

  i usually do n't mind meme posts because they 're generally done tastefully with a respect for comic timing , but this was just a bunch of random clips shoved together .

  it 's not really that similar , but my first thought was the [ easy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teld2naibqy ) music video . 
  no , all is as it should be . 
  the design philosophy behind splatoon was to make it as simple and streamlined as possible to make it super-accessible . 
  now everyone 's got the idea , they can branch out into more complex features in future instalments . 
  there will never be a season 3 of gravity falls . 
  before not what he seems , a lot of people had definitely sussed it . 
  the clues were there and the theories were formed . 
  that 's what made the reveal so mind-blowing for me - not only was it a big twist , but the fandom was right all along . 
  in all likelihood he 'll kill himself first . 
  do n't indulge too much because report-spamming can get you banned from all of reddit , but a little light-hearted joke reporting can be fun now and then . 
  that 's referring to [ this ama ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/gravityfalls/comments/315yoy/im_bill_cipher_i_know_lots_of_things_ask_me/ ) we had on / r/gravityfalls . 
  it was a big deal , so we publicised it on other sites with gf fandoms , and as a result we got a lot of visitors who did n't know how reddit works . 
  though the event only lasted two hours , for months afterwards it was still receiving new questions from new users who were eager to get an answer . 
  we tried hiding the comment box with css tricks , getting automod to remove new comments and message the culprits , and adding a big orange warning to the ` new post ' page because people were trying to ask questions using that too . 
  in the end , nothing could stop the flood besides the natural progression of time . 
  it 's pretty much over now , but it took over a year of people asking `` is the ama still on ? '', 
  i removed this because it 's not really relatable tbh,

  manga goes in different brackets : < oyasumi punpun , 
  someone should ship this philosophy over to the red pill dorks . 
  it would push their persecution complex in a less harmful direction . 
  there was never really much to do . 
  either drive in circles in free mode or play the same few missions over and over . 
  there 's some variety if you dig into the custom maps , but most suck and the rest are copycats of each other . 
  they still show up very obviously , you 'd be surprised . 
  the cleanest way to create the illusion of flight is to take it to post-production . 
  look up tutorials on ` brickfilm masking ' ( there are many methods depending on what programs you have available ) to learn about it . 
  i also find that the more work i have to do , the more anime i watch . 
  it 's a very linear trend . 
  yep , that 's exactly it . 
  although i 've also noticed it 's because i have more of a schedule during those times . 
  if i 've spent the day working , i can justify kicking back in the evening with something i like to watch . 
  i spoke to the mods here about this before , and they said they 'll probably start this in september . 
  there were lots of great advice-givers around last year . 
  in the meantime , keep reading over what you have ( if you have something written ) and start showing it to lots of people . 
  pick up all the feedback you can .
