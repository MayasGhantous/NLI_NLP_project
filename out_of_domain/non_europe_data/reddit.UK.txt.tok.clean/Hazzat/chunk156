  [ definitely ] ( https://redd.it/4ycx6i ), 
  [ not ] ( https://redd.it/4y6lka ) . 
  i 'm gon na add something to the submit page to stop people making posts about this , it 's old news now, 
  hi , i 'm the one who put it there . 
  now the subreddit is getting quieter , i like having fun with the users sometimes . 
  i made other little changes here and there too , which you can find if you crack the hidden codes around the page . 
  what is your purpose ? 
  the bill cipher ama took place in april 2015 . 
  post removed because you are way , way too late . 
  i always forget to check the dark theme ... 
  removed for not being relatable ( rule 5 ), 
  gon na need a shower after that . 
  nope , there are a few on the very page you 're looking at now . 
  hey , that 's cheating !, 
  you 're meant to find this stuff by finding and cracking the clues on the page . 
  also most of those things are n't easter eggs , they 're just leftover from previous subreddit themes . 
  we used to have the `` thank you '' image in the sidebar , for example . 
  yep , that 's because the dark theme was introduced for the bill cipher ama , so it 's the ` bc ' ( bill cipher ) theme . 
  you 'll know when you find what you 're looking for because it 's obscured by a cryptogram . 
  are you sure ? 
  the article speculates a lot on that , and sun & moon are still a long way off . 
  that 's still a little far off to be kicking the sumo marketing machine into full gear . 
  oh no , not this again . 
  organise that life story into a nicely laid-out statement of purpose and you have a good chance . 
  there 's one more !, 
  removed , no screenshots * ( rule 7 ), 
  ^ ( * or photos of computer screens that 's even worse ), 
  yeah it was . 
  it does n't look like it because removing posts does n't delete them , it just removes them from public list , but [ it was ] ( http://i.imgur.com/8pfbxpl.png ) . 
  amazon is borderline social media , especially the parts that personalise themselves for you . 
  very relatable . 
  edit : [ wow you guys ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rpp4dhx.png ), 
  removed , no screenshots ( rule 7 ), 
  everything i love about tri-slosher . 
  discord japes, 
  for those wondering what the connection is , this song is the gorilla 's namesake . 
  ' [ harambee ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/communal_work#harambee ) ' is swahili for ` communal work ' . 
  [ no reason . 
  ] ( https://redd.it/4y22lw ), 
  i have to say , that was n't my first thought when i looked at it . 
  um , i would n't be so sure . 
  the original logo sparked [ a very expensive controversy ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/01/tokyo-2020-olympics-logo-scrapped-after-allegations-of-plagiarism ) and there has been some [ bad blood ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/keithflamer/2016/02/12/the-ugly-dust-up-over-tokyos-2020-olympic-stadium/#32e30dad7117 ) over the stadium design , in addition to all the usual protests about hosting the olympics . 
  it 's four years away , but already it 's a bit of a mess . 
  i was around for the beginning of all that . 
  it started with people calling themselves ` brogres ' to parody how dumb they thought bronies were . 
  then someone said ` shrek is love , shrek is life ' to parody the various catchphrases bronies have , and the rest is internet history . 
  that 's the easy way to get over there , but you have to keep a job to keep your work visa ( unless on working holiday ) . 
  i 'm also curious about how you could just quit to go travelling . 
  removed for not being anime, 
  oh my god we know already stop posting this, 
  removed , no social media screenshots ( rule 7 ), 
  it 's set in 2019 , where they 're preparing for the olympics in 2020 . 
  if there 's no akira reference i 'll be very disappointed . 
  removed for not being anime, 
  a big part of an effective olympic logo is adaptability . 
  it does n't just need to look good on a poster , but it needs to be recognisable in every format imaginable . 
  when you see the chosen logo [ put into motion ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmdtzmi4mq0 ) for example , the choice starts to make more sense . 
  i felt the original t logo was pretty ugly but started warming to it after i saw examples of it in different shapes ( and then it was scrapped ) .

  rule 6 , dude-io, 
  [ uhhhh ] ( http://www.dndjunkie.com/civilopedia/resolution_world_games.aspx ), 
   shitty attitude towards permanent immigrants, 
  that 's one hella generalisation . 
  regardless , the logo is for the olympics , which * is * all about diversity . 
  removed because not anime/relatable, 
  removed , no screenshots ( rule 7 ),

  i do n't have css privileges here . 
  removed for not being relatable ( rule 5 ), 
  this video is beyond amazing . 
  / r/noisygifs, 
  the tooltip looks like [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/pibgog1.png ) . 
  there is a lot of ignorance towards foreigners simply due to the isolation , but there are too many people to just paint with a broad brush . 
  ignorance manifests in different ways , so while it 's true that some people hold anti-foreigner sentiments , many people just do n't know . 
  my experience is that people are mostly curious , and eager to know how life is different back home . 
  but as i said , it 's impossible to generalise . 
  it is a tourism thing , yep . 
  although i do n't think we know exactly how it will work yet . 
  removed because not anime, 
  removed - the bill cipher ama took place well over a year ago . 
  you are far too late . 
  out of interest , how did you find out about it ? 
  removed , go away, 
  removed for being very off-topic, 
  i like how this is n't even fake subs . 
  removed , no social media screenshots ( rule 7 ), 
  ^ ( kamisama have mercy , does no one read the rules around here ), 
  removed because not relatable tbh, 
  removed for not being relatable ( rule 5 ), 
  i think it was just a reference to the fact that , in the world of investing , gold is considered the most stable thing to invest in . 
  even in times of economic uncertainty , it does n't really gain or lose value . 
  the joke is that its value is * so * stable that even in the event of the apocalypse , its value will remain . 
  so in case of the end times , buy gold !, 
  paploo is the saviour this subreddit needs . 
  i want to put that on the submission page , but i do n't have the powers to change that , and the guys who do ( / u/aaragon et al. ), 
  are holding out for the new subreddit theme to be implemented . 
  until then , i guess it 's just nothing but removals .
