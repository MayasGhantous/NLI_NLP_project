   you 're a rock star, 
  but is it a face star ? 
  all i 'm saying is shirobako is an absolute treat . 
  yeah , i 'm gon na remove this for being off-topic . 
  we 're not a code-breaking subreddit . 
  you were in the right . 
  there will ** never ** be a third season of gravity falls . 
  ever . 
  we have no idea . 
  no one knows anything about it . 
  you 'd get the gems , but because you ca n't build a mine on them ( because your city is there instead ) you ca n't reap the full gold/production potential . 
  this is just the announcement for the commercial ( what a world ) . 
  the real thing will be released on the 30th . 
  [ bigfoot ] ( http://gravityfalls.wikia.com/wiki/bigfoot ) ? 
  its existence is well-known as it 's been there since episode 1 .

  an all-in-one study app like japanese or imiwa can become pretty invaluable , especially if you find yourself wanting to look things up offline . 
  something to review flashcards with ( eg anki ) would be good too . 
  now stop procrastinating , build a study schedule and finish your textbook !, 
  this is the best one . 
  this sub used to be good before the mods got here, 
  any flashcard program or website ( eg [ memrise ] ( http://www.memrise.com/course/58584/basic-hiragana-1/ ) ) will make it a breeze . 
  the focus on perspective -- in particular the straight line of the shadow going straight to the vanishing point -- feels very renaissance . 
  looks like you 'll just miss out on the big one : https://ultrajapan.com/, 
  could you provide an example ? 
  the journal makes it very clear to `` trust no one !! '', 
  and to dipper , the journal 's knowledge is everything . 
  in this exchange , he learns that knowledge is n't everything , and he needs to be able to trust his family too . 
  it 's do n't starve all over again .

  also fyi , report spamming is extremely annoying and you can get banned from reddit for it, 
  removed , no nsfw allowed, 
  it 's all better now . 
  this guy reported a lot of posts for `` not being titled anime irl '' because they had an underscore in the title .

  no , i 'm just the only one who comments whenever i do . 
  sometimes , yeah . 
  the last time was six days ago . 
  what , from liking their page ? 
  that does n't give away any info about you besides the fact that you liked their page . 
  a night he 'll never forget , i 'm sure .

  boys and girls thoughts on kissing are different . 
  they kiss girls they want to get closer to . 
  boys think kissing is the start of sexy time . 
  i 've never spent so long on websites for japanese teen girls . 
  i 'm learning so much .

   it should be easy to tell that your post is gf-related without looking at the title . 
  i removed this because it 's an old-ass repost , and you posted it twice . 
  removed , this is too lewd ( rule 2 ), 
  removed , no screenshots ( rule 7 ),

  do you work for niantic support ? 
  well , [ they 're very old pennies ] ( http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/multimedia/archive/00350/115367566_big_ben_7_350052b.jpg ) .

  they grow up so fast . 
  it 's from the making of [ this ] ( https://youtu.be/aoxde8hxhba ) . 
  removed , no screenshots ( rule 7 ), 
  this is out of control, 
  [ this touched a nerve ] ( http://i.imgur.com/1kbe8a5.png ) , it seems . 
  edit 2 : [ the yellow tide cometh ] ( http://i.imgur.com/0075q8p.png ), 
  there 's also the fact that swiss people * write * in standard hochdeutsch , although they speak their own way . 
  an apt comparison might be the difference between received pronunciation ` london ' english vs. [ the deepest , thickest glaswegian accent ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yfrbnipdog ) . 
  the glaswegian has its own words , sounds almost unintelligible at times , but it 's still the same underneath and they do n't write like that . 
  removed , no social media screenshots ( rule 7 ), 
  this theme has a lot of weird quirks . 
  it 's based on `` a variety of activity indicators '' ( the admins ' words ) , in addition to some hand-picking . 
  there 's no strict method to it !, 
  a few hours earlier and this would have been solid . 
  now you 'll have to wait until next year . 
  it seems a lot of anime take place over august 31st for some reason . 
  there has n't been a rebellion - / r/truepokemon is just a place to have sensible discussion away from / r/pokemon 's image-heavy submissions . 
  different communities for different purposes .
