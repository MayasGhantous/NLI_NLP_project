  too lewd !, 
  ( rule 2 ), 
  you pick a company , and you 're shown a prediction of how its value will change over the day . 
  how accurate the prediction is depends on how many streetpassers ( ` analysts ' ) you 've recruited . 
  when trading opens , the graph goes across as the value goes up and down . 
  you have to quickly guess the trends based on your analysts ' advice and hammer the buy/sell buttons as appropriate - buy when it 's low , sell when it 's high . 
  you can use that money to make future investments , and buy accessories based on previous streetpass games . 
  i 'm glad i chose it , it 's really fun . 
  yep , just like all the other streetpass games you can use play coins to hire rabbits ( and in this case , dogs ) instead of players to be your analysts . 
  reports are guaranteed to be read by at least one person . 
  i recall iwata saying that mii plaza is capable of transferring a lot more data than it can at the moment , but as it was the first streetpass title they did n't want to take up streetpass space that could be used by other applications . 
  removed , no real-world stuff ( rule 9 ), 
  all the more reason to nip it in the bud , 
  4 march 2017, 
  yep !, 
  you can choose to get either this or streetpass trader/market crashers for free . 
  no specific one . 
  you know how niantic is ... 
  they were n't banned , i just removed the post ( for rule 9 ) . 
  it was an old repost anyway . 
  removed for not being relatable, 
  it is ** [ c u r r e n t d a t e ] **, 
  removed , no screenshots ( rule 7 ), 
  well you answered your own question - it 's to make all the effects possible . 
  also clean pack shots are far easier in cg . 
  have they ? 
  i thought only the wind rises was there in its entirety . 
  literally the first rule is that posts have to be gf-related : /, 
  although the content is alright , i 'm removing this for the bad title . 
  removed , not relatable ( rule 5 ), 
  removed , not relatable ( rule 5 ), 
  removed , not anime, 
  it 's not over until the 22nd though, 
  removed because this is either a screenshot ( rule 7 ) or just dumb lol, 
  also not relatable ( i should hope ), 
  i do what i want, 
  no , because this post sucks and it breaks rules . 
  removed , not relatable, 
  as much as i ( begrudgingly ) love love live , you ca n't just post random screenshots from it and expect to get away with it, 
  make yourself look adorable for us . 
  moe soothes the heart . 
  but the point is * you * vote to tell * everyone * what is/isn ' t relatable !, 
  at some point there will be a megathread here for everyone to request sop reviews . 
  it 's up to the moderators to decide when that happens , so you will have to [ message them ] ( https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2fjetprogramme ) to find out more . 
  removed , no screenshots/not relatable, 
  removed , not relatable ( rule 5 ), 
  that 's pichu . 
  removed , no screenshots, 
  removed , do n't spam emotes, 
  removed just because, 
  i 'm normally a sucker for this kind of music , but this sucks . 
  as soon as the zelda music kicks in none of it sticks together and it 's just hard to listen to . 
  i was critical in another comment here , but you 've become much better since this track . 
  keep working at it !, 
  removed , no real people ( rule 9 ), 
  removed , rule 9, 
  wow rossnub you really like reposting stuff eh, 
  you may want to look a little closer at these pictures . 
  i suspect you have missed the joke ...

  flairs normally get updated to celebrate hitting some kind of subscriber milestone , so the next one will probably be at 60k . 
  when that happens , keep an eye out for a flair request thread !,

  hi , i 've got a personal statement that needs reading !, 
  it 's for the uk application , so our requirements are [ a little different ] ( https://www.jet-uk.org/apply/statement.php ) to the us 's . 
  all of her answers read like this video . 
  removed because you posted it twice, 
  the ability to translate the `` actor 's '' movements 1:1 is still incredible technology . 
  it was made by disney research lab ( their full video is [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy4bfnhmdtk ) ) so you can imagine how it could easily be turned into fun theme park attractions . 
  removed , we 're not doing this again, 
  you can just switch off youtube remembering your viewing history . 
  it makes all recommendations go away , and you do n't have to do weird tricks like that . 
  the calendar stuff seems to have died down since i posted this . 
  i think it just seemed bad because for some reason august 30th/31st/september 1st/4th are popular dates to mention in anime . 
  your hardworking reddit mods put a lot of time and creativity into giving subreddits their distinctive look . 
  the least you could do is enjoy it the way they intended . 
  removed , not really relatable . 
  try one of the other animeme subs . 
  removed , rules 7 and 9, 
  removed , no real people ( rule 9 ),

  the in-game thumbs up are probably not real people , but there 's always miiverse for when you want to share pictures you 've taken . 
  the dream of pok\u00e9fusion returns !, 
  the lore from [ the pok\u00e9mon site ] ( http://www.pokemon-sunmoon.com/en-us/pokemon/type-null/ ) backs this up :, 
   to complete a certain mission , there was need of a pok\u00e9mon powerful enough to rival those pok\u00e9mon often spoken of in mythology . 
  ocado arrived 10 minutes before the delivery window yesterday . 
  took me by surprise , to say the least . 
  i think the idea is that they begin to lose their faith in unfriendly foreign lands . 
  that 's why they lose attrition , rather than health . 
   angola has a flag that looks like hammer and sickle, 
  [ according to wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_angola ) , this is intentional . 
  the red and the star both represent socialism , too . 
  you can repost this every day forever !, 
  it will always be relatable !, 
  a lot of people on r/civ seem to be convinced that civ vi will feature multiple leaders per civilisation . 
  there 's a mention of it in almost every civ vi comment thread these days . 
  it seems clear to me that no such thing is planned and people are getting hyped over nothing .
