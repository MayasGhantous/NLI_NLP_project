  nope , [ emoji ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/emoji ) are specifically unicode characters that you can type out . 
  although it 's far from a complete list of placements , this can give aspiring jets a good idea of how likely/unlikely it is that you 'll get a requested location .

  there has been [ some talk ] ( https://redd.it/4vby32 ) of comics happening eventually , but nothing is confirmed . 
  for now , the official journal 3 has tied up all the loose ends , and the story is over . 
  the number of purple pins on the map agrees with you . 
   is n't it a bit early to make gravity falls z ?

  gfc is fairly chummy with the people at disney and contacts alex from time to time , which is why some official stuff is on there . 
  [ what happens when you do .

  every reveal video starts with '' [ leader ] leads [ civ ] in sid meier 's civilization vi . '', 
  that should be enough to lay it to rest . 
  in civ v , each leader was bigged up to be a big personality - the spirit of their nation that endures time . 
  vi is going a similar way with its distinctive character designs , and to suddenly throw in a second/third/umpteenth set of leaders would severely weaken each leader 's `` brand '' from a design perspective . 
  it 's needless clutter in a game that benefits from being streamlined . 
  there was also #beachgate , and the fact that the leader list showed no sign of new additions for each civ . 
  objectively , there 's nothing at all that suggests civ vi will have multiple leaders . 
  looks like someone accidentally deleted that one . 
  purple means `` i did n't get placed where i requested . '',

  reports like that are n't such a big problem . 
  everyone was joking around there , and i egged it on by posting screenshots of the reports in the comments . 
  it 's fun when it happens every once in a while . 
  the real problem is people treating the report as a super-downvote , and reporting stuff they do n't like even though it does n't break the rules ( [ for example ] ( http://i.imgur.com/prgevu9l.jpg ) ) . 
  that 's partly what i was trying to encourage against with this post - reporting everything you do n't like does n't solve problems , but downvoting it early does . 
  too young to be on reddit, 
  this is for you !, 
  although to be honest , i think out of all the date posts , this particular one had some value . 
  it 's okay . 
  i 'd say we 're all friends here , but no one here has any friends . 
  i managed to convince more than a few of my 11y/o friends that the [ mactini ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bggon-h7s3q ) was real . 
  \u98ef to you too my friend . 
  i just found this weird rather than relatable , making it better-suited for / r/animemes or somewhere like that . 
  unless you think this really reflects who you are . 
  i was under the impression that `` night dog '' is is meant to be werewolf-themed . 
  i would play that so hard . 
  they 're not wrong . 
  i was n't too shocked by that - the 3ds is n't always-online like the wii u is , so i can understand why there would be less focus on online features . 
  no 3d is just weird though . 
  removed rule 7, 
  obvs . 
  the 3ds can go online , but as it 's a portable console meant to be played while you 're out and about , the offline experience takes priority . 
  that 's why they made it so easy to share levels with your friends - it gels much better with the overall 3ds experience . 
  thank you !, 
  you 're the first person to offer . 
  who knows what was cut for artistic or technical reasons and what was cut just to be lazy . 
  i 'm just justifying it from a game design perspective . 
  japanese animation has its own quirks , as tv is aired at 30fps there . 
  as others have said , it 's often typical to animate 2d/stop-motion on every other frame ( ` on twos ' ) , but switch to every frame ( ` on ones ' ) during fast/sophisticated/action-heavy sequences when the extra detail is necessary to make every action readable .

  the sop is not a cover letter , it 's an essay . 
  cut straight to selling yourself - you do n't need any formalities .

  removed , not anime, 
  it 's a wee bit late to be making civ vi suggestions ... 
  / r/anime did n't get banned from / r/all - they voluntarily removed themselves after weirding people out too many times . 
  afaik no subreddit has every actually been banned from appearing on it . 
  although the admins did have to rebuild the algorithm after a subreddit dedicated to a certain presidential candidate worked out how to game the old system .
