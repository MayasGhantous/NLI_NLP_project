  the article says :, 
   the videos are still accessible outside of the us , the videos are still available through a uk ip address , but chances are that the autonomous copyright robot will catch up . 
  well , [ you can stream pictures and video from your computer to your wii u ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/wiiu/comments/13r05e/stream_videospictures_from_your_computer_to_your/ ) . 
  the mods only do something about it if you tell them . 
  i would message them but i do n't have the source video to prove that it 's fake ... 
  while i agree that downvoting on opinion is a terrible thing to do , mg42er 's comment comes across as provocative and uncalled for . 
  i do n't think it adds anything to the discussion and might as well not be there because it serves only to annoy people . 
  try [ vanilla with sprinkles ] ( http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1298016 - ) . 
  youtube is already incredibly oversaturated with minecraft videos and the chances of anyone starting up today and turning playing video games into their job is pretty much zero . 
  anyone hoping to achieve any sort of popularity through minecraft videos nowadays will have to do something really original and creative , that no one has seen before and really interests people . 
  and that leads me to this :, 
   i will try and replicate my own version of mindcrack . 
  if you want people to watch what you 're doing , * do your own thing * . 
  if people wanted to watch something that like mindcrack , why not go and watch mindcrack instead of some imitation ? 
  the other flaw in your approach is that you seem to be only in it to make money . 
  none of the popular minecraft-playing youtubers started what they were doing thinking `` oh yes , this is going to get me so popular , the youtube ad revenue is just gon na start rolling in . '', 
  they did it because they were having fun and wanted to share it with others , and as result they are ( for the most part ) fun to watch . 
  if someone 's doing it just for the sake of it , it 'll be dull and people will see straight through it . 
  be original . 
  whether that 's in making minecraft videos or abandoning that concept altogether and making something no one has * actually * seen before , you 'll find a lot of success in making stuff based on your own ideas . 
  hey , you might even enjoy yourself . 
  [ planet minecraft ] ( http://www.planetminecraft.com/ ) and the [ minecraft forum ] ( http://www.minecraftforum.net/ ) are the places to go . 
  you could , but then none of the typographers would have any money . 
  nope , it 's definitely [ voxelmenu ] ( http://www.voxelwiki.com/minecraft/voxelmenu ) . 
   have n't seen jon in a while, 
  that 's because he 's gone to work on scrolls . 
  not only yesterday , but every . 
  single . 
  week . 
  this `` joke '' is as old as hell and was n't even funny in the first place . 
  please stop posting it . 
  as a user of the voxelmodpack , i see this title screen every time i boot up minecraft . 
  trust me , it 's voxelmenu . 
  it 's definitely [ mine little pony ] ( http://www.minelittlepony.com/ ) . 
  made by our very own / u/verdanarepublic !, 
  / give < username  43:7, 
  as of the update , the block will use the quartz block texture , changing it would change all your quartz too . 
  no , that 's not how it works . 
  votes are deliberately hidden for one hour after the post is made . 
  ooh , very pretty . 
  [ ] ( / a07 ) i 'm gon na need a source for that one . 
  [ yep , the documentary 's up for sale . 
  ] ( http://www.scrnland.com/shows/3/ ), 
  i have n't seen the documentary yet but i did go to bronycon and she just seemed completely overwhelmed by just how much everyone loved her . 
  it was her first proper public appearance for ponies and she really teared up upon receiving a minute-long standing ovation . 
  who can blame her ? 
  yes it is , scrnland is the only place to get it legitimately . 
  [ hyrulecraft ] ( http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/750782-hyrulecraft/ ) has been in the works for a long time , but the people making it are very secretive about what they 're doing . 
  i have no idea . 
  i remember a long time ago people were excited because they were having an open server day , but i have n't heard from it since . 
  i have n't done my research about the next one , but it seems so . 
  especially bronypalooza , that was brilliant last time and looks like it 's going to be the same quality again . 
  there is a bug in 1.4.7 where the chunk at x :0 z :0 will sometimes fail to load . 
  relog/reload to see it again . 
  the minecraft wiki has a [ really handy tutorial ] ( http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/setting_up_a_server ) . 
  it 's specific to the 0,0 chunk . 
  i 've only ever experienced it in multiplayer ( i do n't play singleplayer much ) and a relog fixed it . 
  now i feel awful , i have become what i despise . 
  i will downvote myself . 
  the raspberry pi version will be free too !, 
  it 's a mod that adds lots of magical blocks , items and mobs into the game . 
  if you want more control over in-game permissions , you 'll need to step into the wonderful ( and potentially very complicated ) world of [ bukkit ] ( http://bukkit.org/ ) . 
  specifically , you might want to look into [ worldguard ] ( http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/worldguard/ ) , which can , among other things , stop people building in places you do n't want them to . 
  there 's also [ logblock ] ( http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/logblock/ ) , which is very effective for cleaning up damage . 
  you can try [ extreme grass growing ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/minecraft/comments/rqzv9/extreme_grass_growing_with_sheep_wildcard/ ) . 
  [ ] ( / cadance ) that was really unnecessarily rude . 
  different people have different tastes . 
  i think pretty much everyone watches the show itself to enjoy it as a great cartoon - there 's nothing even remotely perverse to be found in the show itself . 
  the clopclop side is kept very separate . 
  it was , and it was to do with how they did n't really like the restrictions placed by valve , and mojang enjoyed the independence of owning their game and the distribution of it . 
  mojang and valve are still best buddies though . 
  [ here 's the blog post that notch wrote . 
  ] ( http://notch.tumblr.com/post/9550850116/why-no-steam-notch ) it 's all explained there . 
  there 's a chance it could be a 1.5 pre-release ( release candidate , not a snapshot ) , but i doubt it . 
  feed the beast contains [ all these ] ( http://feed-the-beast.com/#mods_wrapper ) . 
  tekkit contains [ all these ] ( http://www.technicpack.net/tekkit/#modlist ) . 
  sorry buddy , but / r/mylittleminecraft already has that base covered . 
  i 'd like to point out that / u/heliostorm was heavily involved in the creation of that ponyville too !, 
  it 's not like either project was co-ordinated on reddit , or had anything to do with reddit at all ... ( with the exception of loose ties to / r/mylittleminecraft ), 
  they 're all organised on the [brohoof.com forums ] ( http://www.brohoof.com/ ) . 
  when you do this , you are not jumping higher . 
  the extra snow layer makes the block look taller , but you 're not actually standing on the snow layer - you 're standing on the snow block below . 
  look , you can see that your feet are inside the snow layer . 
  yep , it 's pretty common in that part of the world . 
  bamboo is stronger than you think . 
  [ ] ( / lyra ) if you 're looking to improve your pony-drawing skills , you should check out / r/mlpdrawingschool !, 
  if you have an idea for a better system , i 'm sure / r/theoryofreddit would love to discuss it . 
  you can do it right now . 
  the ability to hide chat ( in multiplayer settings when you pause the game ) was added quite a while ago . 
  go right ahead !, 
  i made it with [ voxelsniper ] ( http://www.voxelwiki.com/minecraft/voxelsniper ) . 
  i think it is a hilarious joke . 
  apparently if you place a regular cart , it will be a spawner cart . 
  obviously a bug , but that 's one way of getting them !, 
  posting here wo n't get things fixed , posting in the [ minecraft bug tracker ] ( https://mojang.atlassian.net/browse/mc ) will . 
  `` in this thread '', 
  it reminded me of [ the robot from laputa : castle in the sky ] ( http://www.hardydev.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/4-laputa-robot.jpg ) . 
  i recently passed my 1,000 th encounter ... and i 've never been able to identify anyone i passed !, 
  the mojang help site has [ a help page on the subject ] ( http://help.mojang.com/customer/portal/articles/361483-my-account-was-hacked ) . 
  my favourite thing about that robot is [ the number on it ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/a113 ) .
