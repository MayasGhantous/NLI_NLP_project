  hello , mod of / r/anime _ irl here and card-carrying animeme expert . 
  animemes are a classification all of their own , with trends that go up and down with what 's popular , as well as ` evergreen ' shows and jokes that have been deemed classics . 
  it is worth noting that anime_irl is just one facet of the genre ( that is , * relatable * animemes ) and there are other approaches that can be taken too - / r/animemes , / r/animememes , / r/animenocontext , / r/animefunny etc. 
  overall , animemes hold a high value that shows no sign of decreasing any time soon and there is are a great deal of internet points to be made in the field , but it will take time and research to get a feel for exactly what will make people tick . 
  removed for not being relatable ( rule 5 ), 
  removed for not being releatable/being reposted for the billionth time,

  removed rule 9, 
  removed , what the heck do you think you 're doing posting dirt western comics here , we only accept pure yamato wa-preserving folded-1000-times nippon-grade manga ( that last word is * japanese * , look it up ),

  removed , rule 9 ya dummy,

  japan is smart and uses the iso date format ( yyyy-mm-dd ) for everything . 
  edit : except when they use beginning of the current emperor 's reign as a starting point , making it currently the year 28 . 
  removed , please explain wtf this is, 
  date posts are still ( controversially ) okay because they 're still * technically * relatable ( [ case in point ] ( https://redd.it/55nrni ) ) , but i felt this was a step too far into the weird/random/memey zone . 
  it 's better-suited to / r/animemes or / r/animememes . 
  removed no screenshots, 
  [ look closer ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/anime_irl/about/rules/ ),

  we do n't have a proper version , but [ we do have this ] ( https://soundcloud.com/jalukaw/combined-extracted-snippets-from-sogno-di-volare ) . 
  looks like someone really sucks at reading rules . 
  removed , rule 7 . 
  is it ? 
  that was removed long ago . 
  removing reddit posts does n't actually delete them , it just hides them from the public list . 
  if you check / r/anime _ irl/top , you 'll see it 's not there . 
  this was before thread-locking existed !, 
  after a while we set automod up to remove new comments and message the offending users , and when thread-locking was added to reddit we locked it for good . 
  \\* waves *, 
  the uk application has a section for details on ` international/cultural experience ' ( [ pic ] ( http://i.imgur.com/7wfstve.png ) ) . 
  however , they also want this in the personal statement ( [ section 2 ] ( https://www.jet-uk.org/apply/statement.php ) ) . 
  it also asks about how you would use jet to further your career , details past experience , as well as hobbies and interests , all of which i would have expected to go in the personal statement . 
  any tips on how to balance this so i do n't repeat myself ? 
  i 'm already looking at restructuring a lot of what i have written . 
  [ this is the day it was added .
