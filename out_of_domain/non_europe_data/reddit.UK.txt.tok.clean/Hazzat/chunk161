  the series that birthed [ a horrible , but enduring catchphrase ] ( https://youtu.be/asvog03hyly?list=plw1yb5n9dd8enea66zjoy5gqi9eyenavd&amp;t=140 ) . 
  removed , rules 5 and 7, 
  removed , rule 9, 
  removed for being off-topic . 
  edit : do n't just downvote , tell me why you 're upset :(, 
  removed : rules 5 and 9 . 
  also not anime . 
  removed rule 9, 
  rule 9 is a [ relatively recent ] ( https://redd.it/4zrg6i ) addition , which is why you remember seeing images of real people here in the past . 
  it 's definitely a rule now though , and this definitely breaks it . 
  ( you 're right about the post with the car - that 's gone too . ), 
  relatablility is always subjective so it can be hard to enforce , but i found this to be more weird/random/funny than `` anime irl '' material . 
  it 's better in a place like / r/animememes . 
  `` images '' is a blanket term that covers videos too . 
  it 's a bit pedantic to separate the two . 
  removed , rules 7 and 9, 
   weat, 
  removed , why did you post this here, 
  you are only barred from applying next year if you pull out after you have been given your placement . 
  there is no penalty for withdrawing at any point before then . 
  made me realize came first , and it was adapted into the gravity falls theme . 
  both were written by brad breeck . 
  shinji likes boys though . 
  why ? 
  led to despair and self-loathing . 
  but [ eoe spoilers ] ( / s `` giant naked kaworu 's smiling face '' ) ? 
  that felt good . 
  this coming from the country that famously calls green traffic lights blue . 
  [ um ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/anime_irl/comments/56fzbr/anime_irl/ ), 
  [ ok ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/anime_irl/comments/56fzfv/anime_irl/ ), 
  do n't apply for jet if you 're not ready for anything !, 
  seriously though , adaptability is an important trait , and i 've heard that `` what would you do if you were placed in rural northern hokkaido ? '', 
  can come up as an interview question . 
  the number of tokyo placements has increased in recent years ( 357 last year [ according to the stats ] ( http://jetprogramme.org/wp-content/themes/biz-vektor/pdf/countries/2016_jet_stats_e.pdf ) , more than anywhere else ) but it 's still unlikely . 
  the nature of the programme is that you have to roll with what you get . 
  [ one ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/anime_irl/comments/56fzfv/anime_irl/ ) , [ two ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/anime_irl/comments/56fzbr/anime_irl/ ) , [ three ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/anime_irl/comments/56g5lg/anime_irl/ ) , and this makes four, 
  [ one ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/anime_irl/comments/56fzfv/anime_irl/ ) , [ two ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/anime_irl/comments/56fzbr/anime_irl/ ) , [ three ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/anime_irl/comments/56g5lg/anime_irl/ ) , [ four ] ( https://redd.it/56gasx ) and five , baby, 
  our reposts will block out the front page, 
  we do n't disallow reposts here for that reason , but these were all within hours of each other on the same day .

  it 's a form you have to sign that allows jet to use the information you have provided . 
  [ something like this . 
  ] ( http://www.fr.emb-japan.go.jp/education/jet/doc/releaseform.doc ), 
  as [ this page ] ( https://www.jet-uk.org/apply/preparing.php ) says , you print it out when you finish the online application . 
  removed , not relatable and no screenshots allowed, 
  is it ? 
  i believe the white line is [ slightly offset ] ( http://www.flaginstitute.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/sealand.png ) from the corners . 
  removed , not relatable ( rule 5 ), 
  try / r/animenocontext . 
  geez dude , not everything is a disney conspiracy . 
  switching voices along with bodies is pretty standard for cartoons with body-swap episodes : [ fairly odd parents ] ( https://youtu.be/higgpgxq5lu?t=102 ) , [ teen titans ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pruq7e9ichc ) , [ futurama ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiwuh06bbnk ) etc. 
  that 's because they had different people working on them , and there 's not just one way to make a cartoon . 
  embrace the differences . 
  removed , rule 7, 
  we had [ a thread ] ( https://redd.it/4ijt2i ) about them a while ago , which was quite illuminating . 
  almost all of them come from one city in romania . 
  removed , rule 9 . 
  it 's very much inside the city , but tucked away in its own wooded area . 
  then it would n't be much of a tourist attraction . 
  no such thing exists . 
  you 'll have to do it the hard way with photoshop and determination . 
  welp . 
  i was wrong !, 
  removed, 
  i got rekt .

  amazing , it 's such a deeply textured song , making it really interesting to see how all the layers are put together like this . 
  the answers lie within you . 
  where do you want to take your career/life , and how will 1-5 years working in a japanese school help you achieve your goals ? 
  this is something you 'll have to explain on your jet application , as well as to yourself . 
  southern riders have the best attitude . 
  the internet 's two favourite kens , together at last . 
  removed , please use spoiler tags ( see the sidebar ) . 
  if you edit your comment to add them , i 'll put it back . 
  thanks . 
  spaced repetition flashcards ( anki , memrise etc. ), 
  are how you ensure you never forget vocabulary . 
  download a core vocab deck and go to town . 
  i feel like the fact that it 's different across every civ and every era should make the soundtrack much more listenable , even after hundreds of hours . 
  the japanese music industry is still very physical cd-based , making it hard to be a ( paying ) fan unless you have access to a japanese record store . 
  it 's all about mnemonics to remember the meanings , and includes readings and vocabulary along the way . 
  removed , i do n't need to explain why, 
  i 'm disappointed , aaragon . 
  a many-times-reposted jpeggy image of something that is n't so relatable to begin with ? 
  tsk .
