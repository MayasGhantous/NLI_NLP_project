  in its commitment to showing something that resembles life in the actual world of work , shirobako hits home time and time again . 
  arguably the most relatable show .

  agreed . 
  this is n't any kind of funny .

  after every episode , go to [ the list of cryptograms ] ( http://gravityfalls.wikia.com/wiki/list_of_cryptograms ) and read all the secret messages you missed .

  nah , rule 3 is only really used for people starting fights , being toxic etc.

  fun . 
  political discussion quickly leads to slapfights , arguments and toxicity which do n't really sit right on a subreddit meant for lols .

  the song has n't been released properly yet , so you can only find clips with it playing in the background ( eg the [ christopher tin interview ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhkvd0idqfq ) ) .

  i disagree - sad machine is a dialogue between an ai and the last surviving human , so if the shelter and sm narratives are related , rin is the human voice and her pod/some ai she meets is the sad , lonely machine . 
  it works either way around , but i feel this fits the themes of sad machine better . 
  the ` no messages in 2539 days ' has been posted so many times over the past 16 hours , i 'm convinced this video was made for the sole purpose of being incredibly relatable . 
  it 's okay , it 's not on the front page right now and we do n't really remove repo - oh you deleted it already .

  if i had a yen for every time this had been reposted in the past 24 hours , i 'd have like \u00a5 1000 . 
  porter has been writing a pixar fanfic all this time !, 
  probably not ? 
  they categorise their content into wins , fails , lols etc. 
  so it 's a valid description .

  that sounds too similar to playstation home imo , which was a very different thing . 
  wait why did you post a random tweet from four years ago, 
  it truly feels like a dream of flight . 
  awesome . 
  the camera angles were new too . 
  i suspect it 's not actually a new splatoon game though - it might just be a mockup to show what competitive switch-playing * could * look like . 
  the remastered edition makes sense now ... 
  i was the first person to click on [ the uk trailer ] ( http://i.imgur.com/d6im1ui.png ) ... 
  start and select . 
  i would n't take the performance in the video as truth - a lot of the gameplay videos were pre-recorded footage composited in . 
   this is an urgent report !, 
   we were investigating a video released by a certain company ... is this ... a new species of squid ... ? 
   what the heck is going on !? 
   we have yet to confirm the details , so we do n't have anything we can report , but the investigation will continue . 
  we intend to conduct more research . 
   please stay tuned !, 
  yep !, 
  / r/nintendonx is dead and / r/nintendoswitch reigns supreme . 
  they were visible in the trailer . 
  amiibo functionality will be back . 
  nintendo has already run a nationwide [ splatoon tournament ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgxtdktju1u ) across japan , so it 's a reality . 
  you can see the amiibo in the scene starting at 2:08 . 
  they 're back . 
  absolutely not . 
  i got my money 's worth with 400 + hours , and am totally ready for an upgrade to a more fleshed-out game . 
  it 's not local multiplayer because it still took four switches to get everyone playing together . 
  lan , however , is a possibility . 
  i fully expect official splatoon tournaments to be a thing , mainly because [ they are already a thing ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgxtdktju1u ) . 
  yeah , something weird happened that meant three people made a subreddit called / r/nintendoswitch at the same time , with different capitalisation . 
  trying to go to any of them will lead you here , though .

  the [ faq ] ( https://www.jet-uk.org/contact/faq_apply.php ) answers your second question :, 
   in the case that company policy restricts a referee from using headed paper , this must be stated within the reference . 
  if your referee has recently left the workplace at which they supervised you ( for example your academic referee has started working at a different university ) , they should use the headed paper at their current workplace if this is available .
