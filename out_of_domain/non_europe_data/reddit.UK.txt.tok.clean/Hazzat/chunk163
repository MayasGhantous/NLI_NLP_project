  what country are you applying from ? 
  the word count here in the uk is 800-1000 , which i think is a good number to aim for . 
  i do n't think it will make much of a difference , but my normal protocol in this circumstance is to write it out in full the first time , then use the initialism after that . 
  we had that same question with a 200-word limit on our online application , with the implication that more detail can be given in the personal statement , which is submitted later as part of the physical application pack . 
  future career is something to mention in the personal statement , but it 's not the whole thing . 
  if you do n't have to write one , i guess you just have to find a way to cover everything you would want to put in the statement in the application .

  this piece of the application is just to prove that you will have graduated by the time you depart . 
  if there 's any doubt about that , it could cause complications in your application . 
  if i were you , i would contact your university again to ask if they can write a letter that 's less vague , and also contact the japanese embassy to find out for sure whether it 's necessary .

  woah , i had completely forgotten about this interview , it was so long ago . 
  i just checked - we wrote these answers back in january , so forgive us if they feel a little outdated .

  every single post has in excess of 2000 or 3000 points , which is n't matched even by much more popular subreddits like / r/askreddit . 
  with the system being gamed so obviously , i 'm really surprised no action has been taken .

  as i said in another comment , they approached us about this back in january , before the show ended . 
  apparently we got lost in their files ( i think the writer left the team ) so it took a loooong time before the feature actually appeared . 
  i also read the post .
