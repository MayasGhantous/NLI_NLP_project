  i 've completed it so many times ... 
  [ from yesterday 's front page ] ( https://i.redd.it/6ibm78hxu7ux.jpg ), 
  [ what a flip-flopper !, 
  removed , rule 9 . 
  hey , [ i got two remixes next to each other ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xh2flmz.png ) . 
  ( the other one is [ this ] ( https://redd.it/5a030p ) . ), 
   playable octarians . 
  not sure why this was never a thing . 
  because it did n't make any sense in the game 's lore . 
  also none of the outfits would fit their different heads , and it would detract from the barebones simplicity that made splatoon such a strong first entry in a series . 
  the octogear was there for anyone who wanted to be an octoling . 
  if spla2n comes with a new story , it 's a possibility , but i still doubt you 'll be able to just switch to octoling and go online . 
  welp , that 's all the halloween spooks i need . 
  removed , rule 5 . 
  removed , rule 9 . 
  i can stare forever at pictures like this that capture the infinite complexity of this city unlike any other . 
  is that ... [ callie and marie ] ( http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/960/547/a26 ) 's pose ? 
  this actually made my jaw drop . 
  awesome colours and composition . 
  removed - do not post your personal details to reddit . 
  removed , rules 5 and 7 . 
  just use the report button , please . 
  then any of us can get it . 
  also shaku 's a freeloader who does n't actually do any moderation . 
  we already had light-hearted ` midquels ' between season 1 and 2 : [ the shorts ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eigrrchy6tg&amp;list=pleheej48saxl7vp0z778qbjgd50saz5h0 ) . 
  yes lol , this is just the wii u trailer with the switch logo edited on at the end . 
  ^ ( that 's exactly what it is ), 
  the thames is n't dirty , it 's just brown from all the dirt it kicks up . 
  you still would n't want to swim in it , but there are far fouler rivers . 
  removed , not anime,

  removed , rule 9 .

  hey it ai n't my fault you did n't read the rules, 
  my mp was staunchly pro-leave and actively involved in the campaign , which made it quite satisfying to see the constituency show up pro-remain . 
  i do n't expect him to change his mind , he 's a bit of a prat . 
  i will do , because i know it matters . 
  he 's a strange character though . 
  last general election he knocked on our door and started his pitch to my mum , who thought it would be interesting to have him talk to my recently-turned-18 a-level politics student and anti-conservative brother . 
  instead of trying to engage with this young voter , who was raring for a debate , he just handed his leaflet over , turned tail and walked away . 
  hardly confidence-inspiring . 
  ( dominic raab , conservative btw ), 
  [ the full context ] ( https://twitter.com/oog/status/794123066653741056 ) is a little more revealing . 
  stable , referendum-loving switzerland would like a word . 
  removed , rule 9, 
  maybe it 's a uk thing , but all our bleach bottles are opaque . 
  how can i use \u3064\u3082\u308a in the short form to describe something ? 
  can i do that ? 
  thank you . 
  my brother ( mentioned below ) may dislike the conservatives , but he loves jacob rees-mogg , mainly for being the biggest lad in the house of commons . 
  [ look , here he is being a lad for 7 minutes straight .

  removed because the image was deleted from imgur for some reason, 
  my university ( uk ) has an official channel to go through to ask for transcripts . 
  they said they could n't give me a complete transcript including all the modules i have n't yet taken , but they could give me a signed letter saying i will graduate in may . 
  the jet site says that 's okay instead . 
  removed , not anime, 
  it 's kinda far . 
  cornwall is a 5-6 hour journey away . 
  removed , rules 5 and 9 . 
  removed , off-topic, 
  removed rule 5, 
  [ literally 10 days ago ] ( https://redd.it/59as4x ) , and it 's still on the front page, 
  you should have posted this a week ago . 
  removed , rule 5, 
  someone else approved this but i 'm removing it for rules 5 and 7, 
  removed , rule 9, 
  removed , rules 5 and 9, 
  those are called ` fireflies ' . 
  i have n't used blender enough to know how to deal with them , but if you search for ` blender fireflies ' there are lots of guides . 
  the way the blocks are exactly identical and stacked in perfect uniformity is what betrays the piece . 
  if it were n't for that , i would have had to do a double take because everything else is spot-on . 
  it was [ on time ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ahxguhb.png ) by reddit 's clock . 
  top marks . 
  they 're not communicating , just turning around before they collide . 
  this is making me so mad . 
  if you 're dedicating yourself to something , you * need * to keep track of time !, 
  you need to be organised and schedule properly !, 
  nothing will ever happen if you 're just vague about it !, 
  the text says ( roughly ) :, 
   push to save her, 
   pull to save her, 
  which is really dark . 
  i started adding the tag to calendar posts to help abate some of the rage they cause , but [ i do n't think it 's working ] ( http://i.imgur.com/sik3wae.png ) . 
  we can definitely stop the tagging if you think it spoils the fun ... [ here 's a poll !, 
  i was under the impression that everyone here identified as a loli . 
  it 's what 's inside that counts . 
  removed because [ we removed it yesterday ] ( https://redd.it/5b6qcw ) ( rules 5 and 7 ) . 
  removed , go to / r/joaje, 
  [ the shorts !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eigrrchy6tg&amp;list=pleheej48saxl7vp0z778qbjgd50saz5h0 ), 
  huh ? 
  nothing was removed . 
  if you report something , it hides it automatically so you never have to be offended again .
