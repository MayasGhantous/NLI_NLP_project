  i have no sympathy for you . 
  when you reach a certain level of popularity on twitter and you check it regularly , it 's necessary to become block-happy . 
  people send you * so much * junk and `` criticism '' ( read : abuse ) that you have no choice but to filter out all the negative voices if you want to keep your sanity . 
  i do n't know what it was you tweeted , but the fact that you 're being so vague makes me think you deserved it . 
  the more attention you get , the more hate you get , it does n't matter how many people love you . 
  alex gets a lot of both . 
  the recontracting decision has to be made by february , [ here are some more details ] ( https://www.tofugu.com/japan/jet-program-recontracting-decision/ ) . 
  regarding future career prospects , it 's up to you to justify to both jet and your potential employers in the future why spending 1-5 working years in a japanese school is/was a good idea . 
  it could come off as an extended gap year , but if you 're smart you 'll be able to sell it as valuable experience that makes you unique in your field . 
  makes you go hmmm . 
  removed , rule 5, 
  source please, 
  regarding discussing travel , [ here 's some interesting advice ] ( https://youtu.be/gqmswb-fnbo?t=64 ) . 
  it 's okay to want to travel , but jet is not a holiday , and you should make it clear ( in your sop/ps at least ) that you understand that . 
  that said , the application states that your requests have no bearing on its success . 
  choose where you want , have some good reasons , and be honest . 
  your tweet was needlessly inflammatory , starting fights where there need n't be any . 
  i can understand why he 'd want to cut that negativity out . 
  it 's all very well saying `` it 's just words , grow up , '' but it 's not that easy . 
  words * do * get to you , especially when they come in at the rate they do on twitter . 
  someone i talked to who has been on the receiving end of this said [ this comic ] ( http://deathbulge.com/images/comics/155.jpg ) captures the feeling perfectly . 
  at the end of the day , [ remember the human ] ( https://redd.it/1ytp7q ) . 
  it 's so easy to start pointless arguments online , but if you start treating the people you talk to with respect , the internet becomes a much nicer place for everyone . 
  it 's very long and nothing is punctuated , so it 's really hard to work out what 's actually being said . 
  okay !, 
  i 'm at uni now studying 3d animation so i do n't have much time for brickfilms anymore , but i want to come back to it when this is all over . 
  i 'm a mod of the ( very sleepy ) / r/brickfilms too . 
  how are you ? 
  is lego still part of your life ?

  try [ our discord ] ( https://discord.gg/0petswfwbre46jt8 ) instead . 
  it kinda is , because you can share links and read reviews and stuff . 
  but since then we clarified rule 7 anyway to make the whole `` no websites '' thing clearer .

  the guy who uploaded it , altinsider james , offers paid sop reviews on his site , so i think it was uploaded as a preview of what you can get if you use his service .

  removed rule 8 , and do n't get smart with me, 
  my feeling is that this was more a commentary on the community ( / r/animemes material ) rather than something you can look at and say `` that 's me irl . '', 
  i guess you missed [ the great british splat off ] ( https://www.facebook.com/splatoonuk/posts/1609305822696358 ) ?

  you need to mention it , because there 's no guarantee you will have access to whatever your prescription is when in japan . 
  it wo n't count against you , but jet/clair needs to know these things so they can plan accordingly . 
  it 's not in the guidelines , so it 's not mandatory . 
  it might prevent your personal statement getting lost in a shuffle , but if you 've clipped your documents together properly that should n't be a worry . 
  your name does need to be on your references , though . 
  even that 's not guaranteed :, 
   ... stimulant drugs including some prescription medications such as adderall , and including some medications available over-the-counter in the u.s. are prohibited in japan . 
  there are no exceptions in bringing these prohibited medications into japan , even if the medication is legally obtained outside of japan .

  a moonbow is [ something different ] ( http://media02.hongkiat.com/moonbow-photography/double-moonbow-in-dorgali.jpg ) - the same as a rainbow , but caused by the light of the moon instead . 
  in the uk , interview invitations are sent out `` before the end of february '' and the interview results arrive in april . 
  so the interviews themselves are likely in february .

  kinoko teikoku started out making [ really awesome shoegaze-y ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w725rnq4s_i ) music , before moving into [ less ambient indie-rock ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybrqrah9vjm ) . 
  in their new album ` ai no yukue ' ( love 's whereabouts ) it looks like they 've found a happy medium between the two . 
  makes you go ` hmmm ' , does n't it ? 
  breath of the wild is the perfect example of this . 
  the ` new way to play ' this time is a collection of tools that let you interact with the world , and it looks like they 're integrated so cleanly that using them is effortless and it makes so much sense in the environment . 
  it 's clear that they started with the mechanic in mind and built the world around it , just as this video describes . 
  no good,
