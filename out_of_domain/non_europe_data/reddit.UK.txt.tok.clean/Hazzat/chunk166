  i feel like it was something the friend gradually noticed every day , and she just snapped and had to know the reason behind it . 
  i just had to go through this ( uk applicant ) because i mistyped a phone number on the online application . 
  they said they do not allow applicants to edit their application after submission , but would be able to amend it in this case `` due to the essential nature of this information . '',

  [ interac ] ( http://www.interacnetwork.com/recruit/global.html ) is the main ` second choice ' for jet applicants , because it 's a very similar programme , but privately-run rather than government-sponsored . 
  you can find a lot of videos and resources about the differences between the two . 
  [ here 's a vlog ] ( https://youtu.be/jutsxzd6vnu ) from someone who failed jet but made it to interac . 
  she says it took two months to get her application through and approved . 
  yes , this should be a private modmail thing .

  as long as you have a bachelor 's , you are qualified . 
  if your masters is due to be completed by the departure date , you should be treated as though you have it , but it probably wo n't make much of a difference . 
  your teaching/volunteer experience , general attitude and reasons for going are valued much higher .

  the major issues still persist ( horrendous battery usage , broken tracker ) , but there have been some fun updates like daily quests , easier gym training , lower pidgey/rattata spawn rates and a halloween event that boosted the number of spooky pok\u00e9mon you could encounter .

  i 've seen some real mixed advice on this subreddit - some people say do n't change your statement because it was clearly good enough , but others say you * must * change it because they compare your old and new applications to see how you 've used the last year to improve . 
  i 'd say update it to include anything you 've done in the past year , but do n't start over .

  i study 3d animation and showed all the leader introductions in class because they 're such good examples of communicating distinct characters through animation .

  none of the animations are actually * bad * , and even the weaker ones still have unique character to them . 
  i just feel that mvemba has some small issues that betray him a little - jumping too quickly from pose to pose , not quite enough overshoots to compensate , long and stiff fingers that largely move all together . 
  it 's nitpicky stuff , but animation is all about the tiny details .
