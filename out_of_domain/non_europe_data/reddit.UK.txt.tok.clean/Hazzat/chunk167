  from what i 've heard around here , most of the filtering is done at the application stage and you have a very good shot if you make it to interviews , but it changes every year depending on the number of applicants and number of vacancies that have opened up . 
  good luck .

  shame upon every single one of you who upvoted this, 
  what 's the deal with / r/pokemoonsun ? 
  why did that take off instead of , say , / r/pokemonsunmoon or / r/pokemonsunandmoon ? 
  this is not my graph - it was posted by its creator in the [ jet 2017 applicants ] ( https://www.facebook.com/groups/1705720606364881/ ) facebook group . 
  his blog is mentioned in the image . 
  to me , the most interesting points are seeing how tokyo 's number has shot up , and how osaka city 's already-tiny number has completely dwindled .

  r/animemes became necessary after too many non-relatable posts showed up in r/anime _ irl . 
  we 're pretty strict on the rules there , but people need an outlet for animemey stuff .

  everyone loves journal 3 . 
  it 's lovingly crafted and provides all sorts of interesting lore ( so i hear ) . 
  if you want to know * everything * about the world of gravity falls , go for it . 
  the ` time pirate 's treasure ' story is an expanded universe tale . 
  choose it if you wan na read/play a story about dipper and mabel , but not if you want to get stuck in to the world of gf . 
  self-aware enough to know that no one actually talks like this , but not self-aware enough to know that it 's still cringey to even pretend . 
  the [ heart of gaming ] ( https://www.facebook.com/theheartofgaming/ ) still carries the torch for arcades in london . 
  they are a really passionate bunch . 
  ( currently closed until they move to shepherds bush next year . ), 
  i read this whole thing in one go today after someone posted a different panel from it . 
  it was so powerful , and caught me completely off-guard . 
  also every single frame could be an anime_irl post .

  alright fine i put it back, 
  looks like it . 
  the whole book is 144 pages , and all the scans are missing the last 35 . 
  we vote for our mps . 
  parties choose the leaders , not the popular vote . 
  you can absolutely apply before you get your degree - many/most people do . 
  you 're just required to show some documentation to prove that you will have graduated by the time you depart , which is explained on the application form . 
  japanese language proficiency scores you a few more points , but it 's no dealmaker or breaker . 
  past experience in teaching/tutoring/volunteering etc. 
  is the most valuable thing , so detail it all !,

   have 1 ( maybe 2 ) inbetween before he slaps the table . 
  i would advise directly against this . 
  slapping the table is an exercise in spacing , and the point it is to discover how much force you can i still by making that spacing gap really big . 
  perhaps lower the position of the hand a little on the first frame of the descent , but having a huge jump is essential to making this movement feel right .

  although this is literally anime irl , removed because of rule 9, 
  hey , at least this one 's animated .

  why are you reposting these old things ? 
  / u/jklebonas did a great job telling the story , but it becomes more impressive when you realise how it fits into the meta-narrative of porter 's past work . 
  i wrote this review a while ago in an attempt to explain it . 
   this is a seriously deep piece of work that reveals itself the more times you watch . 
  this is something i feel porter has been aching to create , and his passion shows through . 
   in his album ` worlds ' , porter took inspiration from the fantasies of anime , video games and japanese pop culture in general to create a beautiful series of worlds of his own . 
  it 's the sort of album you can escape into , and imagine yourself in another time where humans and ai have relationships , humanity has become just consciousness , and you are a free , floating spirit . 
  if you 're having a tough time in the real world , it can give you * shelter * ... ( see where this is going ? ), 
   the song ` shelter ' is about wanting to pay that feeling forward . 
  he sings a thank you to the creators of the fantasy worlds that inspired him , and says that he will now `` give [ us , the listeners ] shelter , like you 've done for me . '', 
  they will be forgotten , and so will ` shelter ' , but what matters is that the feeling of shelter is carried along to those who need it . 
   the animation ` shelter ' is one story - perhaps the last - of one person giving shelter to another . 
  rin is given all the tools she needs to make her sheltering worlds , in the same way that porter found his inspiration and made it his own . 
  she builds a new reality , but she could n't have done it without someone else 's help . 
  it 's telling that the final words are `` thank you , '' because that 's what this project is about - giving thanks . 
   shelter is a pure and powerful film . 
  only one question remains : now you 've been given shelter , what will you do to carry it along ? 
  yes but she is also the last surviving human in the universe, 
  it might not be forever , but if she ever wakes up she 'll be in for one depressing existence . 
  thank goodness she has fantasy to let her escape from it all . 
  i feel like we handled that pretty poorly . 
  almost every post of the ` no messages in 2539 days ' image bar the first was removed , but the only one left was low quality and was barely upvoted at all as a result , so people had no idea it was being posted so much . 
  eventually i decided to leave them in the hope that one would rise to the top , but people were too busy posting the image to check the new queue and vote on it . 
  always upvote shirobako, 
  i 'm a mod , so i comment here a lot ... or are you thinking of outside reddit ? 
  that 's true i guess , but there 's nothing in the film to suggest that anyone else survived , and the meaning of the story hits hardest if you consider her to be truly , utterly alone . 
  her father built the machine not just to protect her from the approaching apocalypse , but to shelter her from despair and loneliness too .
