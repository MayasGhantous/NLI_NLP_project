  thanks for linking that other post , i removed it too . 
  i live to serve the people . 
  i love [ ruuuuuuules ] ( http://ci.memecdn.com/2903909.jpg ) . 
  the nightlife centres are shinjuku and shibuya , so the obvious answer is to go near there . 
  last time i was there , our airbnb got changed last-minute to shinjuku ni-chome , which turned out to be an awesome spot . 
  regarding specific hostels , i found the khaosan chain to be very reliable . 
  but there are plenty of good ones to choose from . 
  school of life videos all have to be taken with a huge pinch of salt . 
  they are all opinion essays , which is fine , but the way they are presented makes them appear as factual videos . 
  you have to do some close viewing to work out what advice you can and can not trust .

  eh , contrary to popular belief this sub is n't about posting memes and smug faces and stuff like that - it 's about posting expressive stuff people can relate to .

  i think perhaps ` introvert ' was the wrong choice of word - ` self-centred ' might be more appropriate . 
  you might actually be more likely to draw a left-tail q as an introvert because you have to put in the extra effort to consider how you will be perceived .
