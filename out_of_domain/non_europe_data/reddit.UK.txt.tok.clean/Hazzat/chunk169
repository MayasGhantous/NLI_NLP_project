  japanese is ltr when writing horizontally , but rtl when writing vertically . 
  [ for example .

  removed , these exploitables do n't really count as anime, 
  so far most of the responses have been pro-second year , but for the sake of a flipside [ this thread was mostly anti-second year ] ( https://redd.it/5dslpc ) ( or at least second-year-sceptical ) . 
  they might do , which is why they insist on letterhead paper . 
  they want those contact details . 
  one of my referees did n't use a letterhead , and the embassy held up my whole application until i could provide a version of her reference with a letterhead at the top . 
  they take it quite seriously .

  weirdmageddon 3 was a double episode when it first aired , but now when they show it , they often often split in two . 
  the second half is called ` weirdmageddon 4 : somewhere in the woods ' . 
  it 's nothing new - it 's just the second half of weirdmageddon 3 .

   mt.fuji has registered as a world cultural heritage on june 2013, 
  this is my favourite mt. 
  fuji fact . 
  it 's not a natural heritage site , like the grand canyon or the dolomites , but a cultural one . 
  a huge part of its value is in the number of artworks , writings , poems and ( seen here ) photographs it has inspired over hundreds/thousands of years . 
  ... she says , staring directly at the number of points this post has acquired .

  the us application is all online . 
  in previous years they had to send physical letters like in the uk , but they eventually did away with it . 
  man , why do i have to do it ? 
  [ here 's a gameplay video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na1ciomfblu ) , also released today . 
  you can see how talking to npcs works there . 
  it 's a result of the western influence . 
  traditionally , writing was always top-to-bottom and right-to-left , but as the country opened up to foreign trade in the meiji era ( late 1800s ) they started to adopt the western standard of horizontal left-to-right . 
  that was only sped up by the rise of computers , on which everything is written ltr . 
  there was a brief time where japanese was written horizontally rtl , like in [ this old advert ] ( http://nikonfan.cocolog-nifty.com/blog/images/2010/08/01/ss.jpg ) for \u30ad\u30ea\u30f3\u30d3\u30fc\u30eb ( kirin beer ) , but it never caught on . 
  today , vertical writing is used in newspapers , novels , manga and any situation where the writing needs a more traditional , refined feeling to it : [ fancy adverts ] ( https://www.pref.kagoshima.jp/af07/sangyo-rodo/kanko-tokusan/imageup/images/28969-90838-608.jpg ) , [ heartfelt letters ] ( http://www.midori-japan.co.jp/letter/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/special-2010_soushun-img03_up.jpg ) etc.
