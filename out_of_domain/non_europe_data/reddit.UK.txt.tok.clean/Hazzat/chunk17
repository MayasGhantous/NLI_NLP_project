  raspberry pi link flair please !, 
  mmm , tastes like rubber !, 
  it 's not the case . 
  larson jokes a lot , especially about upcoming episodes , spoilers etc. 
  it 's so much fun to say !, 
  [ ] ( / pinkiefear ) i got hiccups . 
  you can use / r/redditrequest to claim back abandoned subreddits . 
  the southern hemisphere . 
  one if the very first pony image macros , this is as old as the hills . 
  i 'm kind of glad it 's not real . 
  why would i want to visit a subreddit of pictures of people enjoying themselves without me ? 
  it 's mas * aaaa * la , not masal * aaaa * . 
  they have discovered a stronghold connected to a dungeon . 
  it 's not uncommon , most strongholds i 've seen have at least one dungeon connected to them . 
  aside from what others here have said ( ear and nostrils missing etc. 
  ) , the things that jumped out to me were :, 
  * her hooves have really pointy corners, 
  * the line for her flank is really uneven , it would be nice to see that smoother, 
  * same with the tail , the top of it flattens out a bit instead of being a pretty curve, 
  * ~ ~ she needs wings ! ~ ~, 
  overall though , it 's a really great start . 
  i 'm impressed you tackled eyes as well , those are enough to put a lot of people off vectoring !, 
  there 's no right way to watch ponies , but if you 're really not enjoying yourself you 're under no obligation to keep watching . 
  the show is n't for everyone !, 
  what would `` ending the north korean madness '' entail ? 
  [ the `` canon '' map ] ( http://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120811193360/mlp/images/1/12/map_of_equestria_online_version_2012-08.jpg ) ( which is n't all that accurate when you compare it to analysis of the show ) looks an awful lot like north america . 
  and on top of that , she was photo finish in [ picture perfect pony ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sddl4z5qfr4 ) . 
  i was at a season 3 finale meetup and she performed it live ( accompanied by acousticbrony ) , she is one talented lady . 
  there 's also los/las pegasus in the vague california area , the desert in the south and the frozen north ( complete with vanhoover ) . 
  yep , i 'm a mod on a ( pretty small ) subreddit and i can add and change flairs of whoever i want there . 
  that 's not what facebook credits are for , but it is possible to pay money to promote your status amongst your friends so more of them see it ( and subsequently more likes ) . 
  if they chose to promote it , it comes up with a small `` promoted '' next to the post . 
  it 's mainly used by commercial fan pages but the option is there for anyone to use it . 
  i think it 's unlikely that the people you do n't want to see on your timeline have been promoting their posts . 
  if you want to get rid of them without having to unfriend them , you can go to their page and add them to your acquaintances [ like this ] ( http://imgur.com/wsduv1i ) and they 'll never show up on your timeline again . 
  it 's okay , it 'll only post it to google + and no one will see it there . 
  if you 're in/about to go into university , these could be the ultimate study tool . 
  i 'm 18 and i 'd consider getting a pair just for that . 
  in trying to look up the ps4 i got a bit annoyed initially that i could n't find any pictures of the console , but before long i found myself becoming less interested in that and more amazed by the incredible graphics it can ( apparently ) put out . 
  if their intention was to put the focus on what the ps4 can do rather than what it looks like , it worked for me . 
  well , mars is going to need a government ... 
  all the background ponies in the video were fans ' ocs that were submitted via twitter . 
  so they 're all cameos , sort of . 
  was it really lime green wool ? 
  it would make much more sense to edit the texture of a block so it was a clean bright green and use that . 
  it makes sense at first glance , but what of the people who turn clouds off in their settings ? 
  or people who do n't play survival and like to build stuff without thinking about the height limit/cloud layer ? 
  if there was a huge castle in an adventure map , say , and it started raining that sure would look a bit strange . 
  clouds go inside buildings too . 
  i think what we have now works well , with the sky turning a moody shade of grey when the rain starts . 
  it still looks like it 's coming from clouds , just ones that are way , way up . 
  and yet , we all keep playing the game . 
  the world reload would only work in single player , the fuss now is about the fact you can do it in multiplayer too . 
  but ... [ but notch said ... ] ( http://youtu.be/a42ytr6suho ), 
  that was heartwarmingly optimistic . 
  thank you so much for sharing !, 
  / r/usernamesillustrated, 
  just for clarification for loincloth747 , / r/usernamesnominated is where you 're meant to task to be illustrated , not here . 
  this subreddit is just for finished illustrations . 
  you might want to ask / r/findareddit if they know anything . 
  that 's actually part of [ voxelmenu ] ( http://www.voxelwiki.com/minecraft/voxelmenu ) . 
  oh dear , i think karmadecay messed up a bit on this one . 
  [ here 's their contact page !, 
  wait , it says he joined reddit on october 7th 2011 . 
  why does it say it 's his cake day ? 
  [ ] ( / pinkiefear `` too much cake ! '' ), 
  i think phoenixcrypt thought you were talking about nychack 's username . 
  how full is the bus ? 
  is this a popular journey to make ? 
  the `` not even the hulk can ruin this block ! '', 
  link goes to the wrong place , it 's just sticky balls again . 
  ( not complaining though , ca n't get enough of them sticky balls . ), 
  thanks so much for doing these every month , they 're what make this sub one of the best-managed around . 
  wear sunglasses !, 
  this is minecraft . 
  it 's an actual screenshot taken in-game whilst using [ this mod ] ( http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/940974-147sonic-ethers-unbelievable-shaders-glsl-shaders-dynamic-shadows-more/ ) . 
  i tried , it requires flash player 10 . :(, 
  oh , there 's plenty of low-karma comments with reddit gold if you look at [ all the comments that have been given gold ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/all/comments/gilded ) . 
  you 'd be surprised at how much gold-giving goes on in the smaller subreddits . 
  the harlem shake meme is completely unrelated to any actual harlem shake dance moves . 
  it was just a silly video made by the brilliant [ filthy frank ] ( http://www.youtube.com/user/dizastamusic ) to a song called harlem shake , and people began to parody it . 
  that 's kind of the point . 
  as they 're looking to release 1.5 very soon , they need to fix as many bugs as possible so the release goes well . 
  they 're not about to add any new features , because doing so would mean a million more opportunities for new bugs . 
  the massively popular [ sphax 's bdcraft ] ( http://bdcraft.net/ ) takes enough cues from the default textures to still feel like minecraft , while adding enough of its own flair to feel really slick . 
  that was brilliant !, 
  for a first brickfilm it was really cute and the use of lego pieces was excellent . 
  i look forward to seeing more !, 
  what you 're looking at there is called a [ moir\u00e9 pattern ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moir%c3%a9_pattern ) . 
  you should come visit / r/mylittleminecraft !, 
  / r/outside, 
  i 've heard of it before , the reviews all say it 's pretty average . 
  any kickstarter would have to be run by the band 's management , not us . 
  [ hey ocean !, 
  did actually have a kickstarter campaign to finance a world tour ] ( http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/heyocean/bring-us-to-you-hey-ocean-tours-the-world ) not that long ago . 
  dates so far have only been announced up to may ( [ as you can see on their site ] ( http://www.loveheyocean.com/ ) ) so who knows where they 're planning to go after that ? 
  that was put rather bluntly , but yes , if you 're looking for feedback on your pony drawings , / r/mlpdrawingschool is absolutely the place to go . 
  you should know by now that you ca n't link to anything hosted on funnyjunk .
