  ehhhhh , removed , rule 5, 
  whenever / u/whowantspie decides we 're about to hit a big milestone . 
  ( 80k , 90k , 100k ? 
  who knows . ), 
  their bot was just counting ` number of comments that contain at least one emoji ' rather than ` number of emojis ' , so / r/emojipasta 's intense spam would n't affect it much . 
  still , they use emojis a lot anyway so they should still be high up there . 
  maybe they were only counting the most popular subreddits , and / r/emojipasta did n't make the cut . 
  i am loving the new / r/all/top all time . 
  are you sure ? 
  i checked it earlier today in anticipation and / r/montageparodies ' ` upvotes give hitmarkers ' post was number one . 
  now it 's the obama ama .

  the thing is , the switch should provide that experience , if that 's what you want . 
  but for people who play on the go , or like big multiplayer sessions , or do n't have a comfy living room with a nice tv free for their use , they can enjoy the switch too . 
  play for everyone is what nintendo is about . 
  removed , rule 7, 
  but it 's not a gif ? 
  yes , it 's bill trinen . 
  he 's a translator at nintendo , and often translates for miyamoto at events . 
  that was true in v too - it was very easy to accidentally win a cultural victory on the way to domination with all the new great works you picked up along the way . 
  this is nothing short of magical . 
  removed because it 's already the subreddit 's # 1 post of all time, 
  as much as i appreciate it , removed ( rules 5 and 9 ) . 
  try / r/animemes . 
  no , it 's definitely gone . 
  removing posts on reddit is weird . 
  removing posts does n't actually delete them , it just removes them from the public list .

  perfect advice . 
  london is a cool place , but only really when you get beneath the surface . 
  going by the [ faq ] ( http://jetprogramme.org/en/faq01/ ) :, 
   there is no age limit to apply to participate on the jet programme . 
  however , you should understand that the jet programme was conceived as a youth exchange programme . 
  if you understand the goals of the jet programme and have the ability to accomplish these goals , please feel free to apply .

  / r/hentai _ irl ^ nsfw is coming soon . 
  the most goddamn relatable show to anyone lost in the grey zone between childhood , teenage and adulthood . 
  nothing else captures the turbulent feeling of growing up so perfectly . 
  yep , that 's all part of it . 
  the whole thing feels like a wild high-speed punk-rock vespa ride through your teenage years . 
  a lot of it fell into place after i found [ this heartfelt analysis ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/flcl/comments/3pkcfn/what_flcl_means_for_me/ ) on / r/flcl . 
  it helped me to realise that nothing in the show is as random as it seemed at first .

  it 's not like you have a choice . 
  i 'm flattered . 
  the others do remove stuff , but rather than commenting they either give the post a flair ( [ like this ] ( https://redd.it/5h9y2x ) ) or say nothing at all . 
  that 's a different matter , but i 'll bring it up with them soon because people deserve to be notified when their post is removed imo . 
  it means they 're less likely to make the mistake again , too .
