  swallow no evil . 
  depends where you are . 
  tokyo 's train culture is very similar to london 's , with the added restriction of talking on your phone being actively discouraged , but the further from the capital you go the more talkative people become . 
  osaka in particular is known for having friendly strangers who are happy to strike up a conversation . 
  it 's not that different to the uk , really .

  thank you for this , it 's nice to be able to just watch the video without enduring the clickbait . 
  i think miyazaki 's reaction is appropriate and the researchers were a bit foolish to show this to him . 
  this kind of animation , as they said , is a better fit for video games , which have their own needs and style . 
  ai-created animation is a long way from being used for main characters in feature or tv animation , so why show it to an animation director ? 
  you ca n't sticky comments that are n't your own .

  [ this is the original video ] ( https://youtu.be/snh5euw7gxk ) ^ nsfw so maybe you can gather some clues from there . 
  we know nothing new . 
  removed , not anime, 
  oh and rule 7, 
  sure , but in order to maximise those chances it would have been smart to either find a more appropriate director to pitch to ( ie someone who works on games ) or develop a demo more appropriate for miyazaki . 
  at the moment it feels like they kinda rushed into it and got lucky .

  removed rule 5 . 
  go to / r/animemes and screw your edited subs, 
  i spent a lot of time deliberating over this , but the reports started coming in and i figured this is n't the kind of content that our subreddit is about . 
  nice flair choice , btw . 
  removed , rule 5 . 
  you might want to take another look at rule 5 ...

  a little research tells me this is a town called dang kou in china . 
  if you search for images of \u8361\u53e3\u53e4\u9547 you 'll get more pictures of these waterways . 
  \\  implying i do n't know my eva, 
  but yeah , this does n't fit here at all because all posts have to actually be of anime , and it 's not really relatable . 
  it would probably fit in on / r/animemes but i do n't know the rules of that place so well . 
  oh , i did n't know what your plan for the spreadsheet was , but we 'd still be happy to share it somewhere . 
  give us a poke in modmail saying what you want us to do next and we can make it happen .

  the [ schedule ] ( https://www.jet-uk.org/interview/index.php ) has been updated to say ` interview invitations will be sent out progressively from mid-december ' , so we can assume there 's more to come . 
  i got an interview , but i have a friend who has n't even received his confirmation stamp yet , so i had to console him by pointing this out ... 
  it was explained in the email - bring nothing besides your passport and the email print-out because everything else will be provided . 
  you will probably have to leave everything else with security at the embassy .

  okay, 
  the inner workings of the jet programme application are a deeply shrouded mystery . 
  legends say that to uncover its secrets , you must climb unaccompanied to the top of mt. 
  fuji , place a single origami crane on its summit , whisper a prayer to amaterasu , then watch the rising sun every morning for a hundred days . 
  once the ritual is complete , a letter will be delivered on the wind inscribed with four sacred letters : *** esid *** .

  the emails started coming out on wednesday , which is when i got mine ( for alt ) .

  it 's alright . 
  it 's very polished , a little trickier than expected ( which is a good thing ) , but nothing to go crazy over . 
  the flipside is that we 'll have about three months to wait between the interviews and final results ... not looking forward to that .

  it sounds like a lot of fun , even though 33 students are tough to manage . 
  this is the most spidey10 title i 've ever seen . 
  personally , my first choice was somewhere previous jets had recommended , and my second was a city i had visited , and the third was a prefecture i had also visited .
