  but i suppose that 's not very helpful if you have n't been to japan before ... 
  if you 're looking for an introduction to the traditions of different areas of japan , i think looking at their festivals ( matsuri ) is a good place to start - see [ here ] ( http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2063.html ) and [ here ] ( http://www.jnto.go.jp/eng/location/festivals/ ) . 
  skim through the list to see what captures your attention , and use that as a stepping stone to research further . 
  surely this is more / r/animenocontext material, 
  oh okay , that 's fi - wait , hold on a second, 
  without calendars we are nothing, 
  i did n't get one either - you should be okay .

  it used to be [ the all-time top post ] ( https://redd.it/133bf3 ) on r/mashups , which is where i first heard it . 
  one very simple thing you could do to improve it is shift the position of the camera a bit . 
  it 's really far back from link , and it feels a little odd having his whole body centred in the middle of the screen . 
  look at the [ original ] ( https://jogadorpensante.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/windowslivewriterhowtoplaycellshadedocarinaoftimewithxbox-e6c8the-legend-of-zelda-2-2.jpg ) and you 'll see the camera is much closer and his head is right in the middle , not his body . 
  amazing work overall . 
  the film stuff is an awesome idea !, 
  i ran a class teaching kids how to do stop-motion once , which they really enjoyed , but i never thought it could be used to make english fun too .

  it put me in a weird place back then . 
  for some reason it became the only song i wanted to listen to for about four days in a row . 
  what is the best course of action if you are asked to do a mock lesson and the interviewers start acting like disruptive kids ? 
  should you carry on unperturbed , or try to engage them ?

  hey do n't get mad because you did n't read the rules, 
  every time !, 
   ** rules **, 
   1 ) while we specialize in shitty robots , we now also allow the following types of robots :, 
  i 'm pretty sure it fits at least one of those categories . 
  i believe it 's because the clientele might not want to be seen playing . 
  the windows are blocked out for the same reason .

  that 's probably because you [ have to get consent ] ( https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/commons:country_specific_consent_requirements#japan ) to take pictures of anyone in a public place in japan . 
  ( does n't seem to stop people on this sub though . 
  i ca n't help but wonder if the choice of ` meh ' emoji was a joke by an apathetic scriptwriter to see what he could slip past the sony bigwigs .

  jaw-dropping !, 
  sometimes i want to delete this subreddit, 
  i was n't being serious , but having such an open community leads to people writing really weird stuff sometimes . 
  the advice i 've gathered from watching every youtube video i can find on the subject is :, 
  * ** do not bow !, 
  ** you 're not interviewing in japan , so it 's inappropriate for the situation . 
  * shake hands at least once . 
  you might not be able to do so at the start because the interviewers will be busy preparing for you , but go for it if you can . 
  definitely do it at the end though - shake hands with everyone on the panel , make eye contact and say thank you . 
  do that and you should leave a strong impression , ( assuming everything else went well !, 
  in case you 're wondering why you got downvoted so much , it 's because this a question with an answer that 's easy to find by just reading [ the jet website ] ( http://jetprogramme.org/en/aspiring/ ) . 
  everyone on jet is expected to be good at thinking independently and finding things out for themselves , so get used to doing research !, 
  the subreddit is mainly here to give advice , and to answer questions that faqs ca n't . 
  you ca n't really , but if you make the subreddit private and de-mod everyone including yourself , it 's as good as dead .

  yeah , this is why i was unsure what to do in the interview . 
  in the actual scenario i would turn to the jte , but if that 's not an option ... 
  trying to quickly bring their attention back without disrupting the flow of the lesson too much seems like solid advice .

  you 're a day early with the ol' calendar post there . 
  it 's a museum/park . 
  you can walk around the grounds , go up inside the castle and learn all about its history . 
  it was closed from 2011-2015 for a major restoration project , but now it 's definitely open for business .

  please do not even consider promoting your crappy youtube videos here because we ban people for that, 
  okay , to be honest i did n't really watch much of it , but in the past every time someone tries self-promoting their random youtube videos here , they totally suck . 
  i imagine making people who make bad videos and people who do n't want to read the rules ( in the sidebar ) share a lot of traits,
