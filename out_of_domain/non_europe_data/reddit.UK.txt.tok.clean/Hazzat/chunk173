  yeah normally reposts are fine but this is among [ the top posts of all time ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/anime_irl/top/ ) ( it 's # 22 ), 
  the characters are not fake - / u/megapurple was wrong about that . 
  the words are just poorly google translated .

  the recent [ compare the meerkat/frozen crossover ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvwycuc1dty ) had me scratching my head . 
  it 's such a bizzare mismatch . 
   virtuaverse is a cyberpunk adventure by theta division games narrating tales of technomancers , epic cyberwars & virtual reality debauchery in a future not so far away . 
  sounds good to me . 
  [ apparently they have ] ( https://twitter.com/pokemongoapp/status/809882804334923776 ) , but it 's certainly too little , too late . 
  removed , rule 8 . 
  it 's not often we get to enforce rule 8 . 
  removed , this link does n't go anywhere, 
  in the description he links [ this source ] ( https://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/dib/de/index/wasserversorgung/brunnen/notwasserbrunnen.html ) from zurich 's official website . 
  this meme sucks, 
  removed for being 1 ) a bit disturbing 2 ) not gf-related, 
  because it 's just an [ eye of providence ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eye_of_providence ) , and you can see those in all sorts of places . 
  these eyes are not gf-related unless they are clearly pictures of bill cipher - top hat , arms and legs . 
  this is mentioned [ here ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wqyoj1r.png ) on the [ submit page ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/gravityfalls/submit ) . 
  do n't make me ban you again, 
  is this [ an eva reference ] ( https://drexstar.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/nge_7.jpg ) ? 
  i thought it was an eva reference . 
  op gave a lot of details in [ the original thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/pixelart/comments/5kua86/oc_pixel_art_fireball_simulated_in_realtime_using/dbqptg4/?context=10000 ) .

  holy crap how did this last so long, 
  removed rule 9, 
  i removed this because it 's already [ among the top posts of all time ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/anime_irl/comments/5iu9b6/anime_irl/ ) . 
  first day with the wii . 
  a friend came over after school to check it out , and we went for warioware : smooth moves . 
  there was one minigame which involved swinging the wiimote in a huge circle , and because we failed to heed to warnings about watching your surroundings , i swung that thing straight down on top of my friend 's nose . 
  a painful introduction to the world of motion-controlled gaming . 
  [ the video ] ( https://youtu.be/pe0smabuzt0 ) was made three years ago ( almost exactly ) , so it was quite a different site back then . 
  you got one character wrong - it 's \u6c34\u306e\u9818\u4e3b , which kinda means ` lord of water ' .

  we literally do n't know a single thing about it , wait until you actually have something to go on before you get carried away with overthinking,

  i thought it said ` eat dreams ' , which would also be appropriate . 
  well , [ it 's not the first time ] ( https://redd.it/nzg78 ) they 've done this . 
  i like how all the upvote trophies look like little smiley commenters talking to each other .

  try / r/animemes . 
  yes , it 's totally nonsensical ( which is why it 's funny ) . 
  not everyone is asked to do a mock lesson . 
  in fact , going by all the vlogs and blogs i 've seen about people reporting their experience , it may even be something that only comes up for a minority of people . 
  if it does come up , you 'll probably be given a general topic like ` introduce your country ' or ` describe a holiday from your country ' . 
  they wo n't expect you to have prepared and you ca n't really predict what will be asked , which is kind of the point . 
  it 's really an exercise to show how well you can think on your feet , rather than a demonstration of your impromptu lesson planning skills . 
  do n't be tempted to overthink it at the moment ( which is something i 'm guilty of ) . 
  it 's safe to assume that the interviewers * will * try to throw you off with something unexpected , so the best preparations you can make now are to know what they 're looking for , know your own culture , and know yourself . 
  that way you 'll be equipped for whatever they ask , no matter how unexpected . 
  * switches on the floor *, 
  sorry , removed because no nsfw content allowed here . 
  what a weird photo . 
  removed , rule 7, 
  it 's sorry to have kept you waiting ( says the speech bubble ) . 
  that was [ this image ] ( http://allgamesdelta.s-ul.eu/lqaoivtl ) !, 
  it started [ an argument ] ( https://redd.it/4bnvfi ) over whether there really were trees outside the massive entertainment offices . 
  well , in this case the game 's original language is japanese ... 
  / r/japantravel has [ all sorts of advice ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/japantravel/wiki/traveladvice ) . 
  right side, 
  left side, 
  be aware that in most coaches seating is reserved , so you should specify when you get your ticket which side you want to sit on . 
  removed , rule 5, 
  well , we have / r/alexhirsch for that . 
  maid cafes are not meant to be sexy - they 're designed to be a shot of purity and innocence and a respite from the stressful outside world . 
  maybe worth it once for the novelty ( try a maidreamin , they speak a little english ) but you probably wo n't be rushing back . 
  m 's in akihabara is one of the biggest sex shops in the world , and it 's right next to the station . 
  also the top floor ( s ) of almost every multi-storey shop in akihabara are dedicated to adult stuff , so you can totally fill your boots there . 
  but did dipper and mabel grow extra fingers ? 
  post removed - the bill cipher ama took place for two hours in april 2015 . 
  you are very late . 
  yep , contact them to let them know .
