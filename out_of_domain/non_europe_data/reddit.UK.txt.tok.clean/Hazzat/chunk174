  i realised i had written two phone numbers incorrectly on my online application , and they were okay with fixing it because it was `` essential information . '', 
  i 'm sure they 'd prefer you make the correction now rather than in the interview room ... 
  removed , no, 
  reposts are loosely moderated . 
  i 'll generally remove stuff if it 's already on the front page or in r/anime _ irl/top , but we do n't have any strict conditions . 
  which country ? 
  different countries have different tests . 
  it 's just a five-minute grammar test , and nothing to get too worried about . 
  it 's not related to tefl and you wo n't need to know advanced english grammar rules or anything like that - as long as you have a good handle on english , you 'll be okay . 
  source : [ this interview ] ( https://youtu.be/w_eey5svihq?t=349 ) with a guy who did it last year . 
  you ca n't just post yourself , that 's not funny . 
  i. . . uhh ... [ no ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_english-speaking_population ) ... 
  are n't you a few weeks late ? 
  fyi , your comment was auto-removed for including a shortened link . 
  i restored the comment for you , but you should avoid using shortlinks in future . 
  removed , rules 5 and 7, 
  wait , i just realised i 'm not actually allowed to restore the comment - reddit hates shortlinks that much . 
  edit it out and it 'll be okay . 
  removed , rule 9 . 
  definitely appreciate the effort though . 
  this would be fine on / r/animemes . 
  i 'm a brit , and customer service has certainly been a memorable feature of every visit to the us . 
  by our standards , american servers are ultra-friendly and * super * - smiley , to the point where it was almost a bit overwhelming . 
  those ads play into that kind of experience . 
  it looks like even that did n't work . 
  this has become a bit of a mess , eh . 
  if this happens i will literally eat a squid . 
  sounds good to me !, 
  i think your comment was already deemed irreparably evil , so i guess you 'd have to post it anew ? 
  random anecdote : my great uncle who passed away a few months ago was an artist who based his last projects was about the manhole covers of europe . 
  i wish was able to show him these amazing designs , because he certainly would have appreciated them . 
  all good , it worked this time . 
  we have tipping in the uk . 
  it 's more optional than in the us , so if anything , there 's an incentive as a waiter to work harder to make sure they get it . 
  it does n't quite work like that though . 
  * recoils in fear *, 
  he talks too fast and loses a lot of diction . 
  it 's frustrating to listen to because i just want him to breathe for a second , think about the quality of his presentation and slow down . 
  it makes all the difference, 
  i gave up on gamexplain a while ago when i realised the only real merit they have is that they get their videos out first in order to capitalise on early searches . 
  they do a lot of drawing blood from stones for the sole purpose of keeping seo up . 
  removed , rule 9, 
  yeah it 's in the sidebar, 
  removed , this is already [ one of the top posts of all time ] ( https://redd.it/4xo0vk ), 
  the hype explosion will be a once-in-a-lifetime experience . 
  something to tell the grandkids about . 
  i am seriously considering waking up at 4am that day just to be part of it all . 
  i am boring as shit !, 
  oh god , this . 
  i watched the studio ghibli documentary , * the kingdom of dreams and madness * a while ago , and there 's a scene in it where all the ghibli upper management are gathered around a table grumbling about how merchandise sales are down . 
  they seem very pessimistic about the future of the studio , and totally at a loss about what to do to get the boost they need . 
  meanwhile , i sat there screaming in my head `` sell your stuff overseas !!, 
  it 's so hard/expensive to get official merchandise anywhere outside of japan !, 
  you have fans everywhere , and there 's a whole world of profit out there if you would just go for it ... '', 
  very frustrating . 
  mrw people say i ca n't just play splatoon all day, 
  removed , rules 7/9, 
  i did the same double-take . 
  there are a few imperfections that a cg artist would probably overlook , so i think it 's real but lit in such a strange way that it looks artificial . 
  removed , this is already our [ top post of all time ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/anime_irl/comments/5gff5y/anime_irl/ ), 
  i would have agreed with you before i watched these two videos :, 
  he knows exactly what he 's doing with twitter , and uses it to deliberately stir up perfect storms and define the way he wants to be treated . 
  he seems petulant and irresponsible , but it 's carefully crafted . 
  his small hands are n't as fat-fingered as everyone seems to think . 
  if you 're still at university , find out if the student support centre offers interview preparation consultations or mock interviews . 
  i 've done both , and they gave me a lot of confidence . 
  awesome . 
  i 'd probably put the date format in the japanese style though ( yy/mm/dd ) .

  the title means ` the sweet , warm sea ' . 
  removed , what do you think you 're playing at, 
  you made me count the number of toots just to make sure . 
  ( there are indeed 22 toots . 
  / r/analog does n't seem to mind any of those things . 
  removed rule 5 , go to / r/animemes, 
  this is better , but still far from perfect . 
  it really needs a gradient mask to make the blur get more intense as objects get closer/further away .
