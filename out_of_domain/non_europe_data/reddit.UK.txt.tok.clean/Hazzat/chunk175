  there are only two seasons , and there wo n't be any more . 
  moana for grown-ups . 
  because the story ended at the end of season 2 . 
  the adventure is over !, 
  learning all this stuff for myself . 
  we still get people posting here often saying `` should i watch the show ? '', 
  or `` i just finished the show , '' so this was written with those newcomers in mind . 
  i intend to leave this post up at the top for a long time . 
  removed , rule 8 . 
  you 're better than this , patch . 
  i added that message so long ago and still not one person has understood what it means . 
  this is getting [ reported ] ( http://i.imgur.com/y62zocb.png ) a bit , so i 'll make a statement . 
  we 'll let this slide this time because it is technically relatable and does n't break any rules , but if anyone else tries to turn it into an exploitable we 'll gently redirect you to / r/animemes . 
  you got ta pay for the special treatment . 
  how is this different from / r/misc ? 
  [ too slow ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/anime_irl/comments/5mzpam/anime_irl/ ), 
  you are amazing for sharing this , thank you . 
  exactly . 
  `` the jet programme is not a ` who loves japan the most contest ' , '' is a piece of advice i 'm glad i received early on , as it helped me to refocus on what they are actually looking for in an applicant . 
  looks like i owe you an apology , / u/spidey10 . 
  you were right all along . 
  [ decode it yourself !, 
  just in the order they were released , [ as listed here ] ( http://gravityfalls.wikia.com/wiki/shorts ) . 
  good call on journal 3 !, 
  i added a bit about it just now . 
  no this is real news, 
  yes , and every now and then he 'll make a new post with some crazy logic to explain why gravity falls season 3 is a near-certainty . 
  and every time the comments are filled with people telling him no . 
  yep , i used to be just like him . 
  i first used an internet forum at the age of 8 , and i spammed those things to death because i did n't know any better . 
  ( some might say not much has changed . ), 
  i thought this was r/sixwordstories and got really confused . 
  my favourite is what happens when you click on a youtube video and type the word ` awesome ' . 
  where is it in london ? 
  i also won a place at the event , but because i did n't note down the details and there was no confirmation email , i do n't actually know where to be on saturday . 
  *** directly !!!, 
  removed , rule 7, 
  twitch . 
  all my friends will be in bed so at least it 'll feel like i 'm watching it with other people ... 
  definitely . 
  did you see that moody marie ? 
  he 's trying to look like the number 2 !, 
  i 'm feeling that same huge level of hype i did back when we saw the original splatoon reveal trailer . 
  splatoon 's strength is in how slick and simple it is . 
  if they keep the balance right and do n't let the new features clutter the experience , this will be absolutely worth another few hundred hours of gameplay . 
  seconded . 
  buying in march does n't seem worth it . 
  i 'll probably be playing zelda on wii u , then getting the switch in a splatoon bundle or something later down the line . 
  i 'd rather it did n't sit around collecting dust for a year like my wii u did . 
  he made the shape of a 2 !, 
  i saw someone mention that the press kit describes free snes games with online support ( !! ), 
  for online subscribers . 
  there 's definitely more to come with this service . 
  same as on the wii u , surely ? 
  new weapons , new maps , new character customisation , new story , but the same core gameplay . 
  pretty much what you 'd expect from a sequel . 
  that was perhaps the main reason i bought the wii u on launch day , and in hindsight that was a really bad decision . 
  it spent so long just collecting dust . 
  if nintendo wants a launch day success , they need to make a console worth purchasing on launch day . 
  it 's their responsibility to see it does well , not ours . 
  just imagine all the time he spent in front of the mirror trying to work out how to turn his body into the perfect number 2 . 
  [ yes !, 
  probably should 've checked there before i spent the best part of an hour writing this . 
  maybe , but i did n't get that vibe from it . 
  inkopolis plaza was also based on areas of tokyo ( shibuya crossing + tokyo tower ) , so the way this new hub was described as being close to a big urban centre , but far enough away that it 's quite chill and trendy immediately made me think of areas of tokyo that match that description . 
  [ here 's a picture of shimokitazawa ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xakrbeq.jpg ) i took a few years ago . 
  the area has lots of little streets , signs on top of signs and fashionable shops and caf\u00e9s that look a lot like the ones in haikara square . 
  day one purchase, 
  the existence of birds in this weird post-human and maybe post-apocalyptic world always had weird implications for the game 's lore . 
  removed , rule 9 . 
  but lol though, 
  oops , you 're right . 
  i got it mixed up with ` visual-kei ' . 
  absolutely beautiful . 
  this honestly had me tearing up by the end , as you did such an incredible job of capturing everything that makes this place so rich and inspirational . 
  or [ shoegaze ] ( https://youtu.be/7iyh8qz1mgg ) . 
  i tried it today at a switch preview event , and it was so much fun . 
  it had a surprising amount of tactical depth - it 's a proper fighting game . 
  i played it yesterday , and i do n't remember there being any rumble features . 
  but the nintendo employee watching me was very keen to stress that the game was very much still in development , so anything could change . 
   evangelion already had a lot of anime-isms that i deeply dislike, 
  one of the things i love about eva is that it turns a lot of the tropes on their head . 
  it seems like a fighting mech/monster-of-the - week deal to begin with , but it quickly becomes a catalyst for the real conflict taking place inside shinji . 
  the female characters look like waifu-bait , but as it is revealed that they are all in some way psychologically damaged , they become impossible to objectify as they become sources of either sympathy or pity . 
  this allows one of the show 's key themes - understanding your own sexuality - to be explored in a unique and complex way , too . 
  nge * is * incoherent to some extent , but that 's because it 's a harnessing of the pure , furious energy that comes from depression/anxiety/desperation . 
  it 's not a perfectly crafted masterpiece , but instead a complicated exploration of human emotions , and what you take away from it depends on which of those emotions resonate with you the most . 
  i think people who walk away from it completely baffled are unable to see any of themselves in the story ( which is fine ) , but if you discover it has a theme you can relate to , you may find that the events and images in this show understands and empathises with you in a way that mere words can not . 
  that was my experience , anyway . 
  the jetpack takes some getting used to - i think you can adjust your height by holding down one of the buttons , which is pretty important because you 're a sitting duck up there . 
  if ever i triggered it right in the middle of the battlefield , i was shot down immediately . 
  this game is tactical as ever !, 
  no squid puns , but the d-pad callouts seem to have been standardised to ` this way ! ', 
  and ` booyah ! ', 
  universally now . 
  less confusion in communication !, 
  they have an interesting way of [ advertising vegas ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/cfrmqz_wgaa-f6t.jpg ) to us in the uk . 
  it 's not as powerful as it looks . 
  there 's a visual indicator that appears before the landing that gives you just enough time to get away , and the aoe is n't actually that big . 
  you can see it from the defending perspective [ here ] ( https://youtu.be/dvhlijlymqg?t=149 ) .
