  they 're not expecting a perfectly planned lesson out of nowhere - the point of the exercise is to see how well you can react to sudden instruction and unfamiliar situations . 
  you can not predict what requests will be made , so you just have to be ready to say yes to whatever they ask , and give the best presentation you can . 
  remember the interviewers are humans too , and at least one of them was in your situation a few years ago . 
  they want to see the best in you , and will give you every opportunity to shine . 
  this is a spambot , and [ it 's not the only one ] ( https://redd.it/5o3ltz ) . 
  [ wish granted  ( https://www.engadget.com/2017/01/12/splatoon-2-brings-new-weapons-stages-and-fashion-to-nintendo-sw/ ), 
   splatoon 2 surpasses the original in one key way : it has local multiplayer . 
  for the first time players will be able to face off in a proper battle ( as opposed to the first title 's minigames ) with other local players . 
  yep , it says on [ the official site ] ( http://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/splatoon-2-switch ) too .

  nothing has been said either way , but it 's unlikely . 
  i saw a tie happen when they were setting up the systems and left a game running with nothing happening . 
  a random team won 0.5 to 0.3 . 
  the colours are great and you really captured a sense of atmosphere , but the strange shape of the shadows on the buildings describe an odd , rounded shape , especially the tall one on the right . 
  you have to consider what shape these buildings actually are in 3d and consider how the light would fall across them . 
  the background buildings look fine and it 's clear that they 're separate . 
  it 's just the light on the foreground buildings that looks odd . 
  i mean ... [ that 's not true ] ( https://redd.it/1vy3qe ) . 
  60 vs 30fps makes a * huge * difference in fast-paced games , if only because it makes quick movements much easier to keep track of with less blur . 
  everything feels slick and your reactions can be much faster . 
  you can try 30fps splatoon by going into battle dojo . 
  i found the experience really jarring .

  this is seriously slick , i love the variety . 
  going around japan solo is an awesome experience . 
  i spend a week hopping from city to city on the jr pass and had the time of my life . 
  there are hostels everywhere , and there are always lots of people around looking to make new friends . 
  the [ khaosan ] ( http://www.khaosan-tokyo.com/ ) chain was always reliable , but you can definitely find a variety to choose from . 
  check hostelworld . 
  it 's capacitive , so no .

  uhhhhh, 
  unlike some subreddits , we have * standards *, 
  i could definitely see some kind of extra single/local multiplayer game mode being added to play to the strengths of the switch 's portability . 
  i would expect him to blow all that money on more ~ ~ drugs ~ ~ sea snails , leaving him in an even worse position ... 
  i have one of the [ all time top posts ] ( https://redd.it/4y4fz0 ) on / r/bestofreports - it was # 2 or 3 before reddit changed how the voting numbers work .
