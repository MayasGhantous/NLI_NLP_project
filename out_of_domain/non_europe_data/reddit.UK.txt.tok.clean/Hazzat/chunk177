  the dress code for the interview is simply `` formal , '' so you can wear your hair however you like as long as it 's neat , clean and presentable . 
  just look professional . 
  when you actually arrive in japan , you might find that your school enforces a stricter dress code , but that 's a few months away yet .

  i think , for reasons others have said , this is n't as awful as it looks . 
  the aim of this interview is to get a soundbite out there that can be repeated so everyone knows his stance , and this is the only way he can ensure that the calculated message gets across without any confusion or misinterpretation . 
  it highlights a problem with the system , rather than ed himself .

   the old guy gets kidnapped . 
  the old guy * who is a veteran of the great inkling/octarian war * . 
  the war is probably the most important part of the story . 
  as the sea levels rose and land became more and more scarce , the intelligent squid and octopuses fought over what little turf was left , in what became known as the great turf war . 
  this war serves as inspiration for the turf wars that today 's inklings play for fun . 
  removed , this is barely gf-related at all, 
  the sun rarely shines in london , so this is not a problem . 
  i interviewed in london a few weeks ago , and before entering the embassy proper , i was informed that everything taking place past that point was to be kept strictly confidential . 
  so for that reason , those of us who have been through it ca n't give advice on specific topics like that . 
  i will say that everyone helping to run the process was absolutely kind and supportive , and i got the feeling that they really wanted us all to be able to do our best . 
  just be sure to bring the best possible version of yourself on the day , and you 'll shine .

  it was n't an official page . 
  clearly the owner just sold it to a brand for their marketing purposes .

  / r/artfundamentals has some fantastic tutorials to get you started . 
  it 's slow going to begin with , but by taking the time to build a solid understanding of the basics , you 'll open the door to being able to draw just about anything . 
  alternatively , the book ` drawing on the right side of the brain ' is totally beginner-friendly , and is the fast track to being able to draw accurately from life . 
  i went through it a few years ago when i decided to learn how to draw , and it was like a part of my brain had magically been unlocked .

  when the advertisers have found shitty robots , all hope is lost . 
  fridge raiders is a brand that 's become notorious for advertising using memes , and now they have finally arrived at our dear shitty robots . 
  of course it does n't really matter , but it feels like a meme has kind of reached a peak or a turning point when advertisers start exploiting its popularity .

  we just had a thread about this the other day : https://redd.it/5pkisw, 
  i 'm a big fan of the [ just japan podcast ] ( https://justjapanstuff.com/ ) , where they interview a lot of people doing interesting things in japan , many of whom are former jets . 
  it can get quite inspirational , so i 'd recommend clicking through to find some episodes that interest you . 
  you can debate this , but i 'm gon na remove this post because it 's not anime . 
  going through your post history to see what was removed , it seems you either outright broke an easy rule ( eg rule 9 ) or just posted some random fanart . 
  remember , it 's got ta be relatable . 
  that 's what separates this subreddit from similar communities .

  those bright yellow windows had the potential to be ugly and eye-burning , but somehow they just work . 
  removed for rules 5 and 9 , and i 'm also banning you for having the audacity to try to self-promote here,

  that was through [ google bombing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/google_bomb ) , which is quite different . 
  removed , it looks like your upload broke, 
  or you could just give them the source when you post : /, 
  as you already own v , i 'd recommend getting your money 's worth with it . 
  it 's a fun game with hundreds of hours of replay value , so enjoy !, 
  imo , vi is a better game . 
  it 's more flexible , offers a lot more play style options and drags on a bit less . 
  but unless you need it now , there 's no hurry to make the switch . 
  i feel like 3d photos was actually a pretty good selling point , because the 3ds came out during the 3d boom around 2010 when everyone was going crazy about it being the next big thing - 3d movies , 3d tvs , 3d sports broadcasts and - woah !, 
  a 3d games console with a 3d camera !, 
  now everyone 's a bit fed up of 3d it 's certainly lost its novelty . 
  i made this a sticky because it 's important !, 
  there 's a typo in the image - the correct url is [ twitch.tv / ghost_satellite ] ( https://www.twitch.tv/ghost_satellite ) .

  removed and banned for daring to self-promote here, 
  i think the blur gets perhaps a bit too intense , but on the whole this is really lovely . 
  removed , you posted this twice ( and also rule 5 ? ),
