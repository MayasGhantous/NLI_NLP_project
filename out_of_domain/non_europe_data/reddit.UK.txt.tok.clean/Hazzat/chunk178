  not good enough ( try r/animemes ), 
  your degree does not matter , as long as you have one ( or are about to get one ) when you apply . 
  remember that knowing japanese is only a small bonus on your application , and your personality , motivation and past teaching , volunteering and international experience are worth much , much more . 
  remember , alt is only a temporary position , 1-5 years at most , and the jet admissions people expect you to have some kind of plan for the future after your time with the programme is over . 
  when choosing your degree , pick something that will help you to have an enjoyable career long after you have left the jet programme .

  have you considered locking down posts ( or just image posts ) and redirecting people to a ` picture of my new switch ' megathread ? 
  some stats to back this up : [ jet placements over the past five years ] ( https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-833no_df4yw/wc_f8kooxmi/aaaaaaaag4g/ml83yqyfcras-89u7ojkoz8fu8ld3qaiqclcb/s1600/jetstats.png ) . 
  i would n't be surprised if a lot of tokyo people choose not to recontract this year . 
  it 's been about two years since the explosion in placements there , which seems to be how long most people stay with the programme .

  it does n't really work for japanese either , where the word for ` give ' changes depending on your relationship to the people being discussed , and their relationship to each other . 
  i jumped on the bandwagon below , but there are about five different ways you could write each of them depending on the context . 
  generally speaking , a lot of methods for learning western languages do n't apply to eastern ones .

  [ this is the playlist ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iozbj7pcpk&amp;list=plsor9_inzvfn51eojty_mby8fcccyvvop&amp;index=1 ) that got me inspired to take it seriously . 
  i bought the genki textbooks ( also recommended by the [ r/learnjapanese beginners guide ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/learnjapanese/wiki/index/startersguide ) ) and worked my way through them as they held my hand . 
  starting out is overwhelming because you have such a huge number of resources to choose from , but i think the solution is to just narrow it down to three : something to teach you grammar ( a textbook ; a teacher ) , something to review vocabulary daily ( memrise ; anki ; wanikani ) , and something to simplify learning kanji ( kanji learner 's course ; remembering the kanji ; wanikani ) . 
  later you should find some way to apply your knowledge too , through a language exchange ( lang-8 ; hellotalk ) or conversation tutor ( italki ) . 
  once you 've picked those , it becomes much easier to schedule your time and get into a routine . 
  there 's nothing about learning japanese that 's particularly * hard * , it just requires a lot of stamina .

  if john is my friend and the unnamed `` he '' is someone from outside our circle , then i am on john 's level and the apple is `` given down '' ( \u304f\u308c\u308b ) towards me . 
  \u304f\u308c\u308b does not necessarily mean the object was given directly to the speaker , just that it came towards . 
  [ here 's an explanation with examples ] ( http://www.guidetojapanese.org/favor.html#part3 ) - specifically the bit about speaking in the third-person . 
  you should n't be using romaji for any longer than your first week/month learning japanese ... but [ here 's a tool ] ( http://nihongo.j-talk.com/ ) .

  always upvote shirobako, 
  three types of experience they want to see :, 
  * teaching experience, 
  * volunteering experience / local community participation, 
  * intercultural experience, 
  these are the things that will really boost your application , far more than knowing japanese , and you can get started on them now . 
  look for opportunities in your area to get involved - a local japanese society might be a good place to start .
