  that worked perfectly , thank you !, 
  you should make a new post with this guide so more people can find it - i bet there are quite a few people searching for a solution right now .

  you should n't worry about bringing things that were n't mentioned in the invitation . 
  i do n't know about the us application , but in the uk the ` authorisation and release form ' was part of the paper application submitted in november , and it gave the programme permission to use our information for their purposes . 
  maybe some countries/consulates do it differently and ask for the form at the interview , but if your invitation did n't mention it , you do n't need it . 
  as ever , if in doubt , contact your consulate . 
  they 're the only ones who can give you a definite answer .

  u/missingno29 is right , you can connect to public wifi spots with the 3ds by letting the connection test fail . 
  nintendo zones , which your 3ds could auto-connect to without a fuss , were discontinued in europe recently . 
  so that 's probably what you 're thinking of .

  i 'd like to take this rare opportunity to promote my beloved subreddit , r/brogres . 
  they stopped doing presentations , but still maintained a presence with large-scale booths . 
  last year they famously made the bold move of dedicating their entire floor space to breath of the wild .

  yes , while this post breaks rule 7 , i decided to let that slide because it 's really cool and pretty accurate .

  honestly , it 's not that bad . 
  those are real white chocolate kit kats in there , but for some reason it kinda works with the pizza flavours , especially when they 're all soft and melted from the heat . 
  the big orange lumps are mango , making the whole thing extra-sweet . 
  i would n't have one again , but i 'd recommend trying it if you ever get the chance . 
  it 's surprising .

  nah , it was special at the time because hype was at its peak and he dropped all sorts of hints about the future of the show , which meant it was worth picking apart every answer . 
  it was fun , but not worth repeating now the story is over .

  it changes every year , and depends on the country and consulate/embassy . 
  it seems like they aim for early april , though . 
  i took a look at [ last year 's results thread ] ( https://redd.it/4c90l3 ) , and they all arrived between 29th of march and 5th of april . 
  it 's nice seeing so many formerly worried people with little blue flairs in there . 
  these are awesome !, 
  there is none . 
  we have a [ discord ] ( http://discord.gg/anime ) . 
  it has a voice chat . 
  i 'm not sure if that helps .

  i was planning to hold off until mid-april/may in order to focus on university work ... but * splatooooon * .

  no you 're not, 
  0 % chance , the story is over . 
  if you want an epilogue of sorts , check out the official journal 3 book that was released shortly after the show ended - it ties up all the loose ends . 
  as for what to watch next , take a look at over the garden wall . 
  it 's a cartoon with a similar spirit . 
  i would n't totally write off the chance of a spinoff or reboot one day , but an actual ` gravity falls season 3 ' wo n't happen . 
  [ this is a great article on it .
