   please post content from parts of silly ads that show clumsiness or unrealism . 
  i 'd say this fits nicely under the banner of `` unrealism '' . 
  initially yes , but it expanded past that to encompass all commercials . 
  if the mods ( who are very good at their job ) decided exclusively infomercials would be best for the subreddit then that would be enforced , but this is a great example of a funny moment from a regular ( albeit vintage ) commercial . 
  i think it would work best if the colour of the top of the page was made dark to match . 
  that might involve one thing leading onto another and before you know the whole css is rewritten ... 
  [ ] ( / twismile ) it 's up to you . 
  it 's probably worth noting that thefarlanders ' trailer was not the official one , it was just fan-made . 
  [ ] ( / flutterfear ) perhaps , um , this would be better suited for / r/mlpmature ... 
  i think vanity is the wrong interpretation . 
  a guy from south london who used to be big on his brands and stuff explained it to me : when you have little , anything with a name on it is a source of pride because you can say `` this is mine . 
  * i worked for this . 
  technically , miku 's * negi * is a spring onion , not a leek . 
  but they look very similar !, 
  that 's an easter egg in [ voxelmenu ] ( http://www.voxelwiki.com/minecraft/voxelmenu ) .

  it 's useful information , but i think it might have been better-presented if you made a self-post and put all the info in a table , like this :, 
  | id | effect, 
  | 1 | speed, 
  | 2 | slowness, 
  | 3 | haste, 
  | 4 | mining fatigue, 
  | 5 | strength, 
  | 6 | instant health, 
  | 7 | instant damage, 
  | 8 | jump boost, 
  | 9 | nausea, 
  | 10 | regeneration, 
  | 11 | resistance, 
  | 12 | fire resistance, 
  | 13 | water breating, 
  | 14 | invisibility, 
  | 15 | blindness, 
  | 16 | night vision, 
  | 18 | weakness, 
  | 19 | poision, 
  | 20 | wither, 
  [ ] ( / rfluttershh ) oh my , did i leave out fluttershy ? 
  [ ] ( / ajsup ) it 's okay , we have / r/mylittleminecraft for this sort of stuff . 
  as the story started with, 
   i spawn in, 
  i doubt very much that this was their same world ...

  or i guess you could make a txt file and paste links to all your favourite comments into that . 
  there 's no such thing as a `` release post '' , it 's always the case that the first post made saying an update has been released is deemed the main post about it , and it 's where redstonehelper posts the changelog .

  [ i 'm afraid someone else beat you to it . 
  i would expect no less . 
  1.5 has been six months in the making !, 
  nope , just trapped ones . 
  you 're still unable to place three regular chests in a row . 
  there 's no telling what 's hidden beneath those sleeves .

  from myself and everyone else who has been desperate to decipher a miku song as some point , thank you !, 
  a lego knock-off that requires glue to be held together . 
  no , you got down voted because you were coming off as an arrogant arse . 
  it looks like you did need an / s after all . 
  you should pay a visit to / r/mylittleminecraft !, 
  not necessarily famous youtubers - they said 100 people and it was n't entirely random . 
  only active players were selected , but it is very likely that they squeezed some notable minecraft names in there by hand . 
  legitimately ? 
  impossible . 
  but by `` other means '' ? 
  yes . 
  grab yourself [ mcedit ] ( http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/13807-mcedit-minecraft-world-editor-now-open-source/ ) and open your world in it . 
  you will be able to see where you are and by scanning around you should , hopefully , be able to locate your base . 
  then you can move yourself over to your base , close mcedit , jump back into minecraft and grab all your stuff . 
  the only question is ... will you be able to live with the guilt ? 
  that 's because it is . 
  pray tell , what is the bending plugin ?

  [ ] ( / dumbfabric ) reruns of existing episodes are just as effective when it comes to selling toys !, 
  yes it is good !, 
  so good that i 'm afraid [ it was posted already , just the other day ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/minecraft/comments/1all9k/xbox_beetlejuice_incredible_rollercoaster_build/ ), 
  i read a comment my one of the reddit admins who said post filtering is a really bad idea . 
  if you do n't like stuff , downvote it and it 'll go away ( especially if you hang out on the / new / queue ) . 
  woah woah woah , tomb raider wii u ? 
  is that going to be a thing ? 
  i 'm afraid block colours like that rarely look very good . 
  you need a bit more variation . 
  you did n't really answer the question ... what * is * wrong here ? 
  is n't the presence of gravel underground to be expected ? 
  yeah i have , but i just dig through it and do n't complain ... 
  if you use the trick where you place a torch under the gravel as it falls so it pops off by itself without you having to dig it , you can plow through them pretty quickly . 
  [ ] ( / ajhappy ) if you 're looking for feedback to improve , you should check out / r/mlpdrawingschool !, 
  season 1 aired on boomerang ( which is owned by cartoon network ) for a short time , but they totally messed up the scheduling with the first half of the season being rerun a lot , and the last few episodes being shown only once . 
  [ ] ( / rdcool ) it then disappeared and has n't been seen since . 
  [ ] ( / scootacheer ) you should come visit / r/mylittleminecraft !, 
  [ ] ( / twismile ) you should stop by / r/mylittleminecraft !, 
  ca n't you hire an old ally ? 
  that 's what i do whenever i come to a room like that .
