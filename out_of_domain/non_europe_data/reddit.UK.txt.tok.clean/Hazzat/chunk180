  vocaloid is a voice synthesiser program developed by yamaha . 
  the idea is that if you 're a music producer who needs vocals for a song , instead of going through the trouble of finding a singer you can just use vocaloid to get the sound you want . 
  other companies have developed voicebanks - essentially different `` singers '' for the program - and they realised pretty quickly that if you give your voicebank a name and a cute anime girl ( or boy ) design , its popularity will skyrocket . 
  they also started getting anime voice actors to give their voice to new voicebanks . 
  hatsune miku was the first one to really perfect the formula . 
  she is sold as an idol for everyone : `` a collaboratively constructed cyber celebrity . '', 
  the appeal is that she 's a pop star anyone can write songs for , and has over 100,000 to her name . 
  her design is open for use through creative commons , too . 
  vocaloid has expanded beyond a piece of specialist software to a creative phenomenon , and an events and merchandising empire . 
  as it spans so wide , everyone 's in it for slightly different reasons , whether that 's to create/consume music , fanart , music videos , animations , video games , live shows ... 
  it 's a movement with staying power , because unlike movies and tv shows which have a hype wave that ends , or real music artists who have phases and lifespans , this one keeps producing .

  shame on u/a38c16c5293d690d686b for not double-checking their post for quality , but also shame on you for not naming the source on your own post .

  it 's understandable and i do n't get mad at people for it , but the least they could do is quickly check the front page and/or / new to see if their image was posted recently .

  take a look at r/teachinginjapan . 
  generally speaking , if you want to become an actual teacher in a school , you will need teaching qualifications . 
  if you want to continue as an alt or work at an eikaiwa ( private english conversation school ) , you can do that right away . 
  however these private companies do n't pay as well as jet , and sometimes have a reputation for taking advantage of their employees . 
  it 's a surprisingly interesting world .

  it has grown on me to the point where i really like it . 
  they made some truly inspired design decisions , and the whole thing is really quite beautiful . 
  i do miss v 's realism though . 
  what drew me into the game in the first place was the feeling of looking down on a real empire , and the gently rp-fuelled rush of satisfaction that gave . 
  it 's harder to immerse myself in vi when it looks like a toy set , although the sound design goes a long way to help with that .
