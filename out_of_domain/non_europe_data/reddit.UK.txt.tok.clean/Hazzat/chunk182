  this stuff fits better in / r/whataweeb, 
  you imagined the 80,000 number , but [ the subreddit is still growing ] ( http://redditmetrics.com/r/gravityfalls ) . 
  it 's broken, 
  it 's still broken, 
  it 's just 3ds . 
  there 's an all-new fe title in the works for switch , but we do n't know anything about it yet . 
  subreddits used to be called ` reddits ' ( which is why they are all called r\\/something ) , but ` subreddits ' caught on in the community . 
  after a few years they were officially standardised as ` subreddits ' . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ( edit : typo ), 
  / r/solipsism, 
  we could dedicate a whole subreddit to posting all the different versions of this meme . 
  call it / r/wholesomeanimemes . 
  i ca n't tell if this is a violation of rule 8 ( \u00ac _ \u00ac ), 
  no , in the uk you get banned forever :, 
   if a jet participant withdraws after having their placement confirmed , they will render themselves ineligible to re-apply for the jet programme in the future ( exceptional circumstances notwithstanding ) .

  removed for being spam, 
  you ca n't just shout ` fake news ' at things you do n't like !, 
  removed , this is unrelated to gf, 
  . . did n't you post this already a few days ago ? 
  { 3-gatsu no lion }, 
  perfect , thank you !, 
  that would 've been a pisstake given how little new stuff there is . 
  account was deleted , i guess we 're not getting an update .

  you should probably edit your top comment to avoid confusing people ... 
  it looks like a puzzle/sandbox game , but it 's actually a bit deeper than that and develops as it goes on . 
  it 's nearly an interactive art piece . 
  absolutely one of my most memorable gaming experiences . 
  three things right now :, 
  * [ a new show for fox ] ( http://variety.com/2016/tv/news/alex-hirsch-gravity-falls-animated-series-fox-1201673616/ ), 
  * [ * detective pikachu * movie ] ( http://www.theverge.com/2016/8/16/12508674/detective-pikachu-movie-guardians-of-the-galaxy-gravity-falls-writers ), 
  * [ animated * spider-man * movie ] ( http://www.thewrap.com/alex-hirsch-write-spider-man-animated/ ), 
  removed , [ too slow ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/anime_irl/comments/5zhg7b/anime_irl/ ), 
  you ca n't solve it yourself because the clues were real objects scattered across the world . 
  you can read the summary [ here ] ( https://redd.it/4tte1f ) . 
  the first clue came right at the end of the final episode . 
  what 's wrong with detective pikachu ? 
  nice colour choice !, 
  eu - sure why not, 
  you can find the answer if you * [ squint really hard ] ( http://i.imgur.com/7avfvow.png ) * ... 
  it 's an adaptation of [ the upcoming game ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8pt9hiql6y ) . 
  top-bottom looping does n't make any sense either - if you went off the bottom , you 'd cross the south pole and appear elsewhere along the bottom of the map . 
  is this spoilers ? 
  alright , i gave it a spoiler flair . 
  [ here is a thoroughly-researched video essay on the subject . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vthsosgjhn0 ), 
  hey , at least we got [ these crazy adverts ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=humawtyh92c ) out of it . 
  source please, 
  and gravity falls !, 
  these are gorgeous . 
  starts at 5:38 . 
  [ it 's true !, 
  ] ( http://jisho.org/word/%e5%a4%a7%e4%be%bf ), 
  i suspect it 's due to the mysterious mark on the back of your head . 
  { flip flappers }, 
  then i would n't be there to feel the regret . 
  it could be 9 days , but it could be more . 
  they aim for [ the last week of march/first week of april ] ( https://twitter.com/ukjetprogramme/status/842416933517590528 ) . 
  looking at [ last year 's thread ] ( https://redd.it/4c90l3 ) , the results arrived between march 29-april 5 , depending on the country . 
  you 're right , there is no specific date . 
  they will probably arrive next week or the week after . 
  i posted this elsewhere in the thread , but [ last year ] ( https://redd.it/4c90l3 ) the results arrived between march 29-april 5 , depending on the country . 
  my man, 
  1 ) yes it 's new , yes it 's dualies only , no it 's not a sub-weapon . 
  you press jump while firing to use it . 
  2 ) i think the music is the perfect update . 
  feels fresh . 
  i ca n't find it anywhere . 
  it might have been removed because there was something weirdly sketchy about it , as discussed in [ this thread ] ( https://redd.it/5pv0ni ) that appeared a day or two later . 
  perhaps it was written for today 's [ lucky 10,000 ] ( https://xkcd.com/1053/ ) . 
  disney develops a lot of technology that feeds into all parts of their business , from movies to toys to theme parks . 
  [ they upload the research to youtube ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/disneyresearchhub ) , and their videos are often really interesting . 
  it 's made by frederator ( whose other works include fairly odd parents and adventure time ) for their youtube channel channel frederator . 
  so it 's an online-only series , but with some professional backing .

  there 's also the less talked-about new mechanic , which is that [ rollers speed up as you roll them ] ( https://twitter.com/splatoonjp/status/836134208003153921 ) . 
  yep !, 
  it 's even clearer ( and scarier ) in the [ weapon showcase video ] ( https://youtu.be/jrsqeecrxjg?t=14 ) . 
  are n't the testfires worldwide ? 
  you could just post the whole comic and it 'd be fine . 
  it 's based on sweeping generalisations about `` right-wingers '' that only fortify the us vs. them mentality . 
  articles like this do n't help anyone . 
  it should be [ next week or the week after ] ( https://twitter.com/ukjetprogramme/status/842416933517590528 ) . 
  you 've made it this far , have just a little more patience !, 
  [ you called it . 
  ] ( https://twitter.com/bbcbreaking/status/845377419871584257 ), 
  it should be [ next week or the week after ] ( https://twitter.com/ukjetprogramme/status/842416933517590528 ) . 
  depends on the country . 
  ~ ~ in the uk , we get a letter ( and maybe a phone call ? 
  edit : looks like it 's emails this year, 
  sadly not !, 
  instead i 'm doing it manually - whenever a new card pops up with a word that i already know , i press @ to suspend it and it is never seen again . 
  it 's not ideal , but it 's not too annoying either . 
  i was seriously shocked by how dark that line is when i first heard it . 
  removed , [ too slow ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/anime_irl/comments/61ecpv/anime_irl/ ), 
  we had complaints about not having enough racial diversity in our flairs , so let 's take steps to rectify that .
