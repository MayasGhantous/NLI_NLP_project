  i think you might be right :, 
   interviewed applicants will be notified as to whether they have been successful ( final short-list ) , unsuccessful or have been granted alternate ( reserve ) status .

  welcome to the world of r/emojipasta . 
  [ yeah .

  ca n't wait for wreck-it 2 ralph . 
  '' [ breaking the internet ] ( http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/break-the-internet ) '' is a pretty tired old meme by this point - just look at the google trends chart at the bottom of the page . 
  putting it in the title feels very out-of-touch . 
  also there 's the strong possibility of the movie being full of quickly-outdated internet culture and meme references . 
  only half of those are pixar characters . 
  kizuna ai memes on the up up up !, 
  invest now !, 
  you 're the happiest alternate i 've seen so far . 
  it 's a shame because genius is otherwise a really good site . 
  that 's because [ it was totally fake ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reqnmdkkgs4 ) . 
  if you like the crossover idea , it 's worth checking out [ splatshine ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn3w5_dey9k&amp;list=pljcga3eh9oafciadnnsgj9n_flwqjw3_l ) , which is a fan art project about combining the two worlds . 
  absolutely - splatoon deserves to be in its own world . 
  the tiny references in the original , like blooper pixel art on the walls , were perfect . 
  it does n't need any more than that . 
  not to mention that some kind of tropical resort would be out of place in a game based around tokyo-esque urban areas . 
  removed , this is already the # 1 post right now, 
  also slow down, 
  removed - seriously c'mon [ it 's the # 1 post right now ] ( https://redd.it/6266pd ),

  2 . click on top post, 
  ( with knowledge ), 
  [ how do you expect us to read this ? 
  she 's animated through motion capture . 
  the actress who plays her ( and it is an actress ) dons a mo-cap suit and records the actions and dialogue , which are applied to kizuna ai . 
  there seem to be a few people working on the project , but it 's hard to tell because the details are kept secret in order to convince people that the character is actually real . 
  stop posting this, 
  credit for this goes to u/altinsiderjames , who posted it on the applicants facebook group . 
  [ hold on tight ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urs4xbxexko ) my fellow runners-up , but remember that the best time to start making alternative plans is now !, 
  yes , it hit r/all yesterday and [ is still on the subreddit front page ] ( https://redd.it/6266pd ) . 
  it has been posted a lot in the last 24 hours . 
  did you find it somewhere ? 
  even the thumbnail has a lot of artistry in it . 
  you can see the composition being crafted , deliberate decisions about straight/curved lines and some early suggestions of light and shade . 
  it 's not as easy as it looks !, 
  you also used to be able to do this mod-free by looking up your ` items crafted ' statistics in the pause menu . 
  worked for clocks too . 
  it 's linked in the sidebar : https://www.facebook.com/groups/1705720606364881/,

  get in the discord if you want to organise it !, 
  this is the best one so far, 
  you can only break the rules if your post is a calendar . 
  we are becoming dinnerbone .

  removed , you posted this twice, 
  removed , you posted this twice, 
  i think you 're being too pessimistic about it . 
  it 's the nature of reddit for people to be organised into communities , and it makes sense for those communities to want to gather under the emblems that unite them . 
  it 's not about recycling ideas and hailing corporate - it 's about celebrating shared interests and identities . 
  that 's true of both r/place and reddit as a whole . 
  removed , this is the third time you 've posted it, 
  [ you sick piece of filth ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dtizky7.png ), 
  they 're right , the date reads 4th of may . 
  but i appreciate that you got the time right . 
  with one month left to go of university ... yup this is me irl . 
  where are all the windows ? 
  that actually says `` the smallest in the history of humanity . '', 
  good suggestion , i added it to the post !, 
  in case you 're wondering , yes it 's fake subs . 
  the note actually says :, 
   the advance showing of the movie will take place in the screening room . 
  i went ahead .

  i posted the wrong link at first - i edited in the right one . 
  you can use [ the decoder ] ( http://themysteryofgravityfalls.com/ ) to decode things yourself by writing in the code and pressing the right button depending on what kind of cipher it was encoded with . 
  in this case , it 's the a1z26 cipher .

  this is just a place to share stuff with other gravity falls fans . 
  everything on the splatoon tumblr is treated as `` breaking news '' or a `` special report . '', 
  it 's part of the fun ` squid research lab ' role-play they 've been doing since before the original game even released . 
  such is the nature of existence . 
  it goes all the way back to [ the very beginning ] ( https://splatoonus.tumblr.com/post/104094885679/have-you-heard-about-the-mysterious-shape-changing ) ... 
  the on-site statistics with breakdowns only go back a year , but you can [ check redditmetrics ] ( http://redditmetrics.com/r/splatoon ) to see how the sub has grown over its lifetime . 
  it does say mt. 
  fuji in the bottom-right , so you 're right . 
  i do n't mind the moon because it falls under artistic license , but the ripples are throwing me off a bit . 
  they do n't seem to follow the perspective .
