  removed - the bill cipher ama took place on 1 april 2015 , so you are very very late . 
  there 's something heartwarming about stories that are brave enough to honestly tackle real-world problems we face . 
  as others have said , there 's only one episode out right now , but it 's very sweet and very similar to shirobako . 
  it might depend on your country , but i do n't think that 's normal . 
  give your consulate a call/email soon . 
  x-post r/shittyfoodporn pls, 
  no fighting allowed here !, 
  this is a really unique collection , more than just the typical japan holiday pics . 
  thanks for sharing . 
  this is the reason given [ on the wiki ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_4_-_no_police_brutality.2fharassment ) :, 
   policing is a sensitive issue on the internet , and on reddit especially . 
  this causes two problems with our pre-existing rules : firstly , videos of police harassment and abuse are often indistinguishable from political propaganda for one side or the other ; and , secondly , the public nature of their office means that the police are often trivially easy to doxx -- a term which means ` reveal the personal information of ' , typically for the purpose of witch-hunting . 
  as you 'll see from the above sections , this manages to break all three of our rules so far , and is something with which we have had huge problems in the past , leading to verbal warnings from the admins . 
   as the outrage sparked by these kinds of videos leads invariably to multiple infractions of our rules against personal information and witch-hunting -- as well , often , to the rule against videos of assault -- , we do not allow them on the subreddit . 
  there are , as the rule says , subreddits designed for the sole purpose of housing this kind of content , and , as we 'll discuss in our breakdown of rule 9 , the size of / r/videos means that we have to ensure that our content is suitable for as many of our subscribers as possible . 
  violence of any kind is difficult to reconcile alongside this requirement , and so we try to minimise it where possible for the most part . 
  it 's his actual son , and he did have a wife .

  it will happen . 
  if it does n't i will literally eat a squid . 
  i know , i 'm looking foward to it, 
  * robbie rotten later died after choking on a metre-high tower of oreo cream . 
  i mean , they are just ads paid for by nintendo ... 
  also , they 're not safety videos - they just ask you trivia questions and teach you facts , mostly about animals and nature . 
  before animal crossing , they had mario ones that did the same sort of thing .

  [ this is what happened last time it was posted ] ( https://i.redd.it/ly775ubwhwfx.png ) ( which is why i said ` here we go again ' ) . 
  a good redditor always downvotes reposts . 
  unlucky for you , we just updated rule 4 to outlaw this kind of content . 
  check the [ new rules ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/anime_irl/about/rules/ ) . 
  it was always a rule , just kind of an unspoken one . 
  i 've removed plenty of stuff in the past for being ` not anime . ', 
  now it 's been made clearer , it 'll be easier to enforce . 
  this stuff is always welcome on r/animemes . 
  we get them all the time on r/anime _ irl . 
  [ here 's one ] ( https://redd.it/64q19r ) that was posted less than an hour ago . 
  oh the animal crossing ones have been there for a few years now , they 're not building up to anything . 
  i think they just chose these characters because they are massively popular . 
  splatoon 2 and arms release dates . 
  information about the online service , as it will be integral to splatoon 2 . 
  perhaps some new splatoon weapons , and more content from arms . 
  more information about already-announced 3ds games like pikmin 3ds . 
  burn anything but calories , clearly . 
  some o ' dat [ sauce ] ( http://onegianthand.com/post/159432332636/how-anime-was-invented ), 
  because it 's profitable to stir up moral panic . 
  the logitech hd pro webcam c920 has all the features you 'll need . 
  if you do n't need hd resolution , the quickcam pro 9000 used to be the favourite , but it might be quite hard to get hold of nowadays . 
  [ reports are off the charts today ] ( http://i.imgur.com/7b3zctx.png ), 
  edit : [ update ] ( http://i.imgur.com/k6lhumt.png ) , we got a lot more, 
  nope , for the most part any reports we do get are legit , even on popular posts . 
  something happened today that just caused everyone to go nuts and report everything . 
  i do n't know what 's got into you all . 
  some other random reports from today :, 
  also r/animemes had a 20k + post that hit r/all , they sent me [ this picture ] ( https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/199939990053060608/301444674407890944/unknown.png ) . 
  ^ ^ edit : ^ ^ typo, 
  i did n't want to post it myself because [ we 've kinda seen it before ] ( https://redd.it/4y4fz0 ) . 
  this makes me wonder , will controller `` mods '' like this be legal in the inevitable tournaments ? 
  or will they be considered too much of an advantage ? 
  be gentle , [ she 's not great at english ] ( https://youtu.be/6ssz1kduetu ) . 
  i have n't received anything either . 
  looks like they have n't been sent out yet . 
  edit : it arrived today !, 
  it was , i was very proud . 
  i decided to go and see it after watching this [ awesome effects showreel ] ( https://vimeo.com/211519393 ) , but for some reason the film itself did n't give me the same rush . 
  { shirobako 2 }, 
  believe what you want to believe . 
  we have u/roboragi so you can look this stuff up yourself ... 
   ** sakura quest **, 
   in the wake of a nationwide movement during the bubble economy period , a small town in the countryside has revived its `` mini-nation '' tourism program ; hiring five girls as travel ambassadors . 
  the series will follow a year 's time of the five girls as they work in the tourism agency of a small failing town in an effort to reinvigorate it . 
  [ it 's joke ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psarnhjwdhc ), 
  yep , that was a refreshing feature of shirobako too ( although they did start off the show with a high school scene ) . 
  it 's certainly nice to see a break from at least some of the clich\u00e9s . 
  same studio , similar story themes , similar characters - the main even has a similar-sounding va. . you 'd be forgiven for confusing the two . 
  as much as i would love that , this is the closest we 'll ever get . 
  { world fool news }, 
  that 's so far away . 
  no it 's not , the actual story mode is based on octarians and yet to be revealed in detail . 
  i have a friend who helps to run a lot of smash bros tourneys in the uk , and he is desperate to start running arms events too . 
  they 'll probably start as an extra feature of smash bros meetups , then break off if they 're popular enough . 
  when i played the game myself at a preview event , i was surprised by how tactical it was . 
  it 's about as deep as pokken ; maybe deeper if all the gloves are a really big deal . 
  that 's the joke , they just described paying $ 60 and getting the full game . 
  i do n't think so , salmon run seems to be its own totally-contained mode . 
  slightly more active and resource-laden is / r/howtoquitreddit . 
  delete this post . 
  removed , [ too slow ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/anime_irl/comments/65a2sb/anime_irl/ ), 
  he did n't - the guy hires someone to draw the comics for his '' `` hilarious '' '' jokes . 
  we do n't know , they did n't give details on what the original amiibo will do . 
  [ we got marie ] ( https://youtu.be/qn4w5d2tzme?t=89 ) , but callie is still mia . 
  exactly . 
  i thought it was a silly arm-flailer like wii sports boxing until i tried it at a preview event and found it 's not only tactical , but a lot of fun too . 
  well , there 's callie and marie as well . 
  / r/45thworldproblems, 
  i agree it 's not that attractive , but it matches the colour of the arms logo . 
  also if it was a more `` standard '' yellow , the red/yellow combo would look pretty mcdonald 's - y. 
  maybe we 'll find her at a hair salon ?
