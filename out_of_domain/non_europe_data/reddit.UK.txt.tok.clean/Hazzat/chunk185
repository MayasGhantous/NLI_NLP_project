  i 'm not sure what you mean by ' * true * , ' but surely one of those fits the criteria . 
  sceptical as i am about live-action remakes , i feel like this shows some misunderstanding of how animation works . 
  making animation * is * acting - a good animator goes through all the steps an actor does to work out mood , intent , tension etc. 
  and brings that to their animation . 
  both actors and animators can choose to meticulously plan out their movements or just improvise , as well as add their own twists to make it memorable . 
  this applies to all types of animation - 2d , 3d , stop-motion and all the others follow the same rules . 
  ^ ^ ^ edit : typo, 
  yep , this particular running joke started in episode # 37 . 
  it 's like some editors just had a field day on a stock video website . 
  i removed your comment . 
  mark the links as nsfw and i 'll put it back . 
  you got it !, 
  it 's also up on the nintendo uk store . 
  for some reason , it 's the grey ones that are really hard to get hold of . 
  removed , [ too slow ] ( https://redd.it/658smd ), 
  ( yes i know i 'm also pretty slow removing this ), 
  shame their video was so dull . 
  i liked the concept , but it could have been executed so much snappier . 
  look closer , they 're not quite the same . 
  r/triangleporn ? 
  most of the games are dependent on everyone getting different instructions and quickly typing/drawing their own answers . 
  it would be impossible to play without everyone having access to some kind of online device . 
  why is there an ear wobbling in and out of frame in the bottom left, 
  afaik there have n't been any dire shortages for individual switch games , just the console . 
  but you 're right about the amiibo - they were pretty hard to get hold of last time and it 's likely to be just as much of a scramble again . 
  yep they 're pretty easy to get now , but i remember going nuts with the refresh button on the day pre-orders went live trying to secure my game + amiibo bundle .

  the question was about hardware , not software . 
  [ can you not read ] ( http://i.imgur.com/qgr5frt.png ), 
  that was truly , truly awful . 
  it exceeded expectations . 
  for some reason , i suddenly feel the need to seize the means of production . 
  i was the same until i played it at a preview event and found it is really fun , tactical and addictive . 
  naturally you wo n't like it if you do n't like fighting games , but if you do you 'll probably find it has the depth required to make a really satisfying experience . 
  i hope they release a demo for it , because to some extent it has to be played to be understood . 
  uh , no , not really . 
  no , they all come from this one person 's head .

  this is from preston blair 's [ advanced animation ] ( http://animationresources.org/instruction-preston-blairs-advanced-animation/ ) , which is full of fantastic guides like this on how to draw characters for animation . 
  we allow her on r/anime _ irl . 
  i do n't get why people say ` no effort ' - it takes as much effort to screenshot one of her videos as it does an episode of a show . 
  the splatoon ones were my gateway drug too .

  i had a big argument with someone in the youtube comments recently who was convinced that kizuna ai is an actual ai . 
  they believed her scripts are ai-written , her voice is computer generated , she is animated by ai etc. 
  [ this is just a little bit of it , ] ( http://i.imgur.com/acyiq2s.png ) it went on for a while . 
  yeah it 's true , that 's where his name comes from . 
  i have a friend who helps to run a lot of smash bros tourneys in the uk , and he is desperate to start running arms events too . 
  they 'll probably start as an extra feature of smash bros meetups , then break off if they 're popular enough . 
  i hope we see some kind of competitive scene around it - it has as much depth as any other fighting game . 
  2017 : gove 's revenge . 
  may just used `` a unstable labour coalition government propped up by the liberal democrats '' as a spooky threat for what would happen if you do n't vote conservative . 
  hold on , the election has n't been confirmed yet . 
  given that they 're already `` committed to staying in the single market , '' that 's unlikely . 
  what i got from [ this ] ( https://twitter.com/timfarron/status/854278087713988609 ) was that if we end up with a con/lib coalition , they 'll push for the softest brexit possible . 
  we 'll have to see what their actual manifesto says , though .

  this is deliberately an accessible layman 's explanation for how the system works , because as much of the response to andromeda showed , most people really have no idea how game dev and animation actually work . 
  i think it succeeded as a video , and is a great primer for anyone who wonders what has really gone into making the games they like to play .
