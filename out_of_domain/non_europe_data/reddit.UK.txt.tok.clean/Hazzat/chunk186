  flair request thread is this way -  https://redd.it/60ykrx, 
  imgur automatically puts the image in an album when you upload it , and you can switch images in and out of that freely . 
  but with a direct link like this , you can only edit it with imgur 's built-in simple tools . 
  that 's true , but as this image was submitted as a direct link , editing the album is no longer an option . 
  this is incredible . 
  haha wow this got downvoted a lot . 
  protip , if your post is from a new episode of a popular show that aired within the past few days , it has already been posted a billion times . 
  that 's why we 've temporarily added [ this message ] ( https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/199939990053060608/305628052790968320/unknown.png ) to the r/anime _ irl/submit page . 
  [ it comes out on december 15 in japan ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2527336/releaseinfo?ref_=tt_ov_inf ) , same as the us . 
  is it actually a new character ? 
   what is this , a new character ?!, 
   ... is what we thought , but it seems this is just an advert . 
   it seems this is the mascot of the shipping company that boasts the biggest market share , ` ikatenkyuubin ' ( ` fast squid delivery ' ) . 
   he 's a funny looking guy . 
  [ it 's joke !, 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/psarnhjwdhc ), 
  mods are here every day !, 
  there 's not much to moderate , people are well-behaved . 
  it 's true that the sub 's glory days are behind it , but i 'm still consistently impressed by the amount of new content we get daily . 
  / r/gravityfalls is far from dead . 
  blue lake *, 
  it 's in the bernese oberland , in the canton of bern . 
  it 's not really a hiking spot though , it 's more like an activity space for a fun day out .

  [ done !,

  i think the point was that stan was wimpy when he was a kid , and he sees a lot of his former self in dipper . 
  he toughened himself up to face the real world , which is why he 's such a beefcake in his teenage years , and wants to help dipper do the same . 
  [ was he though ? 
  ] ( https://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gravityfalls/images/e/ea/s1e19_poor_stan.png ) as we saw in dreamscaperers , he was a real weedy dork until he [ suddenly turned it around ] ( https://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gravityfalls/images/5/56/s1e19_stan_punch.png ) . 
  this is [ tsutenkaku ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ts%c5%abtenkaku ) in osaka , japan . 
  someone with time please edit this to be a downvote gif, 
  thank you for your effort !, 
  it 's just a caes * a * r cipher , type it into [ the decoder ] ( http://themysteryofgravityfalls.com/ ) and hit ` uncover a secret ' . 
  hey , finally one of these penguin posts that does n't break rule 9, 
  you lose, 
  removed , [ too slow ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/anime_irl/comments/68aujj/anime_irl/ ), 
  no , it ca n't do both at once . 
  some games have offered the option to use the switch in portrait mode , so i think if ds games ever came to the vc that would be the recommended way to play them . 
  probably would n't be so comfortable though . 
  btw this stuff is always okay on / r/animemes, 
  this user is n't doing anything wrong , so there 's no need to take action . 
  all i see is constructive posts and comments . . ? 
  ohhh , you were talking about u/fadapoiio . 
  i thought you were talking about op , who does only post constructive things . 
  yeah that behaviour sucks , ban incoming . 
  for resources , check out the [ beginner 's guide ] ( https://redd.it/5mu36n ) !, 
  too late , the flairs have already been decided !, 
  thanks !, 
  i grew up in walton , and i think it 's lovely . 
  plenty of parks , the river , the shopping centre , lovely cinema , two theatres , occasional big events like the festival of light ... 
  being cosy suburbia it 's pretty dull if you 're looking for any kind of youth culture , but i do n't think it matches your `` run-down '' description at all . 
  also this is the first time i 've ever seen the town mentioned on reddit , so that 's nice . 
  yep , when you 're walking up it , [ it 's just brown ] ( https://i.imgur.com/dsd2vyy.jpg ) . 
  i would like to climb it myself one day , but i have a feeling it 's much better viewed from afar . 
  poppy, 
  it 's the most climbed mountain in the world , despite the fact that it 's only open for three months of the year . 
  so yes , it gets pretty crowded . 
  there 's also the [ general trigger one ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/spacepatrolluluco/comments/61p7gb/new_discord_for_fans_of_studio_trigger/ ) , which is pretty active !, 
  { sakura quest }, 
  no focus on 3ds at all in the main presentation . 
  are they finally starting to drop support for it ? 
  honestly , it can be about anything that gives you a sense of optimism when you 're feeling down . 
  the lyrics are vague enough that they do n't have to point to anything specific . 
  the rap verses are about the power of rhythm , so you could interpret that as being the ` sunshine in a bag ' . 
  removed , you posted this twice, 
  [ yeah ] ( https://redd.it/4gyxgz ) , but it was a while ago . 
  there was some top quality meme material in this year 's eurovision . 
  i 'm gon na need a 10 hour version, 
  you * wish * this was you_irl . 
  also source please .

  i took this at tsuruhashi station in osaka , japan . 
  i would go with either [ carefully animated hopping ] ( https://youtu.be/x5v6e4x5mve?t=20 ) , or something [ a little fancier ] ( https://youtu.be/u9_xkzuqf94?t=154 ) . 
  these hoes do n't even know the lyrics smh, 
  yep , they swapped the legs out for slope pieces . 
  i just took a nostalgia trip diving through brickfilms.com looking for the tutorial the creators wrote around the time the film came out , but turned up nothing . 
  a lot of the image host sites people used to use are n't around anymore ... 
  this is why you should never label things ` final ' !, 
  a couple of errors to fix for the next one : ` buenos aires ' is spelled incorrectly , and both that and ` hong kong ' need to be capitalised . 
  i remember you from back on bricks in motion , and it 's great to see you doing new stuff . 
  this looks great , i love the spinning fan on the engine .
