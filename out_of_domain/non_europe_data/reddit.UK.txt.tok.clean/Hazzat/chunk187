  i 've been studying 3d animation at university , but i did just release [ my first brickfilm in ~ 3 years ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozg9__5_nsc ) . 
  looks like you had a similar kind of break !, 
  well , [ we knew that already ] ( https://youtu.be/qn4w5d2tzme?t=88 ) . 
  callie * was * there , if you looked closely . 
  in the big promotional artwork that scrolled up the screen at the end , she was visible as a big pink silhouette looming over everything else . 
  i 'm sure we 'll see it on the official tumblr before long . 
  for those wondering about the lack of callie , she 's visible right at the end of the trailer , silhouetted in pink and looming over everything . 
  more powerful than we could ever have imagined ... 
  [ 1080p 60fps version !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufs1gf9nzvk ), 
  that 's not true , you can definitely lose points . 
  to my understanding , spidey is just a little kid with too much free time who likes to overthink things . 
  he probably got inspired by some cartoon analysis videos on youtube and started coming up with his own ideas , but does n't realise that they 're all misguided and empty . 
  i do n't really mind though - it 's a hobby . 
  people started calling it hero mode because that 's what it 's called in japanese ( \u30d2\u30fc\u30ed\u30fc\u30e2\u30fc\u30c9 * hiiro moudo * ) . 
  thank you , i will soon , 
  lots of them give foreshadowing for what happens in future episodes , so there wo n't be much mystery if you 've already watched them all . 
  but [ why not check out the cryptograms anyway ] ( http://gravityfalls.wikia.com/wiki/list_of_cryptograms ) . 
  [ hot tamale hot hot ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjk4ozazaqo ), 
  what 's your favourite 2000 's school disco jam ? 
  very good spot !, 
  you should remove the logo in the middle - when it gets implemented on the subreddit , the logo will be added over the top with css . 
  this looks great , i hope you get permission from u/rosielinea so it can be used . 
  i 'm gon na need a complete version of the shooting stars/joaje mashup . 
  give source, 
  nice touch including the giant tentacles from the top of [ the official art ] ( https://i.imgur.com/oyvgqdy.jpg ) . 
  check out the [ jas . 
  townsend and son , inc. ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/jastownsendandson ) youtube channel - they make detailed videos about all sorts of things eaten in america in the 18th century . 
  the genre is just j-pop , as the squid sisters are parodies of real-world j-pop idols . 
  the closest-sounding track i can think of is capsule 's [ i wish you ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syj0_dufxbk ) . 
  the whole ` player ' album should appeal to you if you like the squid sisters . 
   \u9ad8\u53f0 -  [ high ground ] ( http://jisho.org/word/%e9%ab%98%e5%8f%b0 ), 
  lol, 
  thanks , 
  now [ aaron ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvkiva2kddy ) makes much more sense . 
  it 's such a shame , because sony pictures , and their animation branch in particular , have such an incredible base of artistic talent . 
  from an animation perspective , their movies are some of the most fun-to-look-at being produced today . 
  but their executives keep making the worst decisions , and wasting their resources on flops like the new smurfs , and terrible ideas like the emoji movie . 
  uggghhhhh, 
  ^ ^ edit : typo, 
  i could n't concentrate on the movie because all i could think was [ you should n't feed bread to fish !, 
  ] ( http://oceancrusaders.org/why-you-shouldnt-feed-bread-to-fish/ ), 
  the extended pinky is a nice touch . 
  [ she replied !, 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/shittyrobots/comments/6cgw1w/how_to_properly_ask_out_the_queen_of_shitty_robots/dhur4nc/ ), 
  what is it ? 
  if you want to see how much people love and get/got excited for this show , take a look at the [ episode discussions ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/gravityfalls/wiki/threads ) from when the episodes first aired . 
  the later ones especially , because the community exploded in size during season 2 . 
  a lot of the analysts here deliberately try to find flaws because the show is so good and has so few mediocre moments . 
  it makes for a more interesting challenge , and generates more discussion than talking about your favourite moments . 
  from the thumbnail i thought this was a birthday cake . 
  it would be a fitting sentiment for a birthday cake , i suppose ... 
  hey , welcome , glad you like the show . 
  a lot of your questions can be answered by the [ gravity falls wiki ] ( http://gravityfalls.wikia.com/wiki/gravity_falls_wiki ) . 
  for example , [ here 's all we know about bill cipher ] ( http://gravityfalls.wikia.com/wiki/bill_cipher ) , and [ here 's a list ] ( http://gravityfalls.wikia.com/wiki/list_of_cryptograms#season_1 ) of all the secret messages in the show decoded . 
  * they 're the same !, 
  [ w-neck !, 
  ] ( https://media.giphy.com/media/ng7m7fuqvzla8/giphy.gif ), 
  controversy turns heads and gets people reading . 
  it 's the same reason they did ` legs-it , ' and pretty much everything else they get criticised for . 
  it 's eye-opening to see how many of the red areas are owned by companies based in tax havens . 
  it is in london - [ ` thresholds ' at somerset house ] ( https://www.somersethouse.org.uk/whats-on/mat-collishaw-thresholds ) . 
  [ horse head mask ] ( http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/horse-head-mask ) - its life as a meme started on the japanese internet as anonymous users used it to hide their faces , and ended up becoming an icon of weird internet culture . 
  thank god for region-free . 
  it does n't break rule 7 because the fact that it 's a screenshot is n't really part of the post , it 's just op being lazy . 
  c'mon / u/bphamtastic , you could n't have taken three seconds to crop the image before posting ? 
  yeah , the rule gets a bit sticky sometimes . 
  sometimes i feel like we should change it to `` no added text , '' but we also get posts that are in-keeping with the spirit of r/anime _ irl that do have text . 
  i think ` day 1 as admin ' is one of them . 
  it really comes down to case-by-case moderator discretion . 
  i removed ` how to date an anime girl ' twice yesterday , partly because it looks like a screenshot and partly because we 've seen it enough times already . 
  the written rules do a pretty good job of keeping bad content out , but with posts that toe the line we just have to make value judgements . 
  this track is so bad , i would n't want to share it with anyone regardless of my views . 
  instead , try [ kate tempest ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsvyyykaeoo ) - she knows that if you want people to listen to your commentary , give them something worth listening to . 
  is this orthographic , or does the camera just have a really long lens ? 
  the perspective is messing with my head ... 
  hey , that 's my mp . 
  every time i see him , whether on tv or on the doorstep , i find more reasons to dislike him . 
  i mean , we already know it 's in confusion hill and you can go there and see it . 
  that 's where the cipher hunt led us . 
  what i linked is n't ska . 
  removed , [ you posted it twice ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/anime_irl/comments/6e1d1l/anime_irl/ ), 
  it 's so squidgy and beautiful . 
  good !, 
  i 'd recommend her whole let them eat chaos album . 
  it 's seriously powerful and heartfelt social commentary .

  i 'd like to direct you to / r/eflcomics , which has cracked a smile from me more than a few times . 
  those colours are incredible . 
  awesome photo . 
   long arms of the law !, 
  that pun had to show up somewhere . 
  because we should aspire to be better than that ? 
  then why did n't she answer with that ? 
  your response i would have accepted , but her actual reply was just bizarre .
