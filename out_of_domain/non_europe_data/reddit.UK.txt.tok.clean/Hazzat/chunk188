  sorry , i guess i 'm just a bit tired of people bringing this up over and over . 
  alex has moved on to the next thing , and that 's something worth celebrating . 
  he had an idea , realised it and saw it all the way through to the end which is fantastic . 
  it needs nothing more . 
  the interviews you linked were done before the show ended . 
  alex has already moved on to his next projects ( mystery project with fox , animated spider-man film , detective pikachu movie ) so he wo n't be returning to gf anytime soon , and he does n't need to . 
  the story is over . 
  we might see a special or something at some point , but never an actual season 3 . 
  it 's nothing to do with gf , because that is owned by disney . 
  it 's something entirely new , and we do n't know anything about it . 
  [ here 's the announcement about it . 
  ] ( http://variety.com/2016/tv/news/alex-hirsch-gravity-falls-animated-series-fox-1201673616/ ), 
  he does n't !, 
  you could try tweeting at him , but he gets a lot of tweets . 
  i 'm sure a lot of them say `` will there be a gf season 3 ? '', 
  so do n't ask him that . 
  we have one for the subreddit , it 's linked in the sidebar with a big image . 
  it 's not often you get an opportunity to link a song about oxbow lakes . 
  taking inspiration from liam wong ? 
  just so you know , your account has been shadowbanned from reddit , meaning moderators have to approve all your comments and posts before they can be seen . 
  i approved your comment , but for more information , see r/shadowban . 
  absolutely awesome . 
  battery life is a big consideration when it comes to the switch , so my guess is that they want to cut out as much as possible in the background to keep the battery alive for longer . 
  we ca n't really know though , we can only speculate . 
  some days i look at this subreddit and wonder . 
  i just wonder . 
  the games need to work equally well in handheld mode as they do in docked mode - that 's why at all the splatoon 2 demos i 've seen at conventions etc. , half the units have a tv and half are docked . 
  nintendo seem to be big on saying `` you can play switch games how you like . '', 
  it 's almost as if the word `` pacifica '' means something . 
  references some kind of ocean , perhaps ... 
  it all makes more sense when you realise [ wrestling is n't wrestling ] ( https://youtu.be/vyvmof3hsga ) . 
  [ the schedule ] ( https://static.gamespot.com/uploads/original/43/434805/3231590-6311023355-c_i1skewaaa6rce.jpg%3alarge ) specifically says the main presentation will be about `` nintendo switch games for 2017 , '' so you do n't need to worry about 3ds stealing the show . 
  the rest is all possible , though ... 
  yeah , it 's a parody of that .

  standards for 2d animation have come a long way in the past decade . 
  always upvote { shirobako } . 
  i forgot how great this video is . 
  it 's not even oc . 
  removed , you ca n't just go reposting the top post of all time, 
  kill la kill, 
  yep , just look at [ all these vintage postcards ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=american+postcard+lettering&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjl88mrgkfuahuebmakhdtzaeiq_auicigb&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=974#tbm=isch&amp;q=vintage+american+postcard ) . 
  that style is n't a gf-original . 
  a helix clone is taking them off for him . 
   we will be introducing all the weapons that will be useable at e3 . 
   this is the blaster . 
   it 's a weapon that can fire explosive ink and do damage within a range . 
   its fire rate and the speed of its bullets are slow , but it has the power to knock out an opponent in one direct hit . 
   the sub-weapon is poison mist , and the special is splashdown . 
  [ it 's real ] ( https://redd.it/6fecm8 ), 
  it was even on wikipedia . 
  this is [ from 2015 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=eighth_generation_of_video_game_consoles&amp;oldid=653229422 ) :, 
   ** eighth generation of video game consoles **, 
   the eighth generation of video game consoles is predicted to face competition from smartphones , tablets , and smart tvs . 
  due to the proliferation of these devices , some analysts speculate the eighth generation to be the last generation of home consoles . 
  nope - it 's causes enemy team members in the area to move slower and lose all their ink . 
  sorry , i do n't run the google drive so i ca n't help you there . 
  sub is `` robot bomb '' and the special is inkjet ( the jetpack one ) . 
  `` robot bomb '' is just its name in japanese , so it might have a different name when it gets localised . 
  afaik this is the first time we 've seen it mentioned . 
  it 's so cute !, 
  because maybe they 're not ? 
  as i pointed out [ here ] ( https://redd.it/6fsd14 ) , it 's worth knowing that the point sensor is a bit different this time . 
  it only affects the area around which it landed , instead of tracking people across the whole map .

  every time i see a screencap from this show i feel a little more sick, 
  it 's like a monet . 
  gorgeous . 
  as of this year it 's [ open to the public ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/amp/www.eurogamer.net/amp/2017-02-08-e3-2017-opening-doors-to-public-for-first-time ) , so it has definitely changed its purpose . 
  check out the [ beginner 's guide ] ( https://redd.it/5mu36n ) - i wrote it for people just like you who want answers to all the questions . 
  just to correct you , [ this is kaminarimon ( thunder gate ) ] ( https://img.travel98.com/xl/p_54099_935a9de3d4d07cd7e6fdc51aa5125785_o.jpg ) at the entrance to the sens\u014d-ji temple . 
  your picture is of [ h\u014dz\u014dmon ( treasure-house gate ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/h%c5%8dz%c5%8dmon ) , which is the second , much larger gate on the approach to the temple . 
  it 's a lovely picture , i love the warmth and the coolness . 
  sub is [ ink mine ] ( https://twitter.com/splatoonjp/status/872743645501247492 ) , special is [ sting ray ] ( https://twitter.com/splatoonjp/status/872744524304367616 ) . 
  do n't celebrate until the results are in - it 's a good sign , but the whole thing still sits on a knife edge . 
  bbc says that is extremely unlikely , as the two parties are completely at odds on brexit . 
  but these are weird times and anything is possible . 
  for those who missed it , you can catch it for a while [ on iplayer ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/live/bbcone ) - starts at 22:10 . 
  prepare for the gove surge, 
  when i unlocked the camera feature , the first thing i did was float down into the village and snap a picture of paya so i can take her with me everywhere i go . 
  ( [ original post ] ( https://redd.it/6fzfji ) ), 
  theresa may called the election in order to strengthen the very slim conservative majority ( only 12 seats ) to something more secure , giving herself a stronger negotiating hand in brexit talks , which are due to start a week on monday . 
  the fact that this completely backfired and resulted in the party losing their overall majority looks incredibly bad for her . 
  in case you have n't discovered it yet , r/casualuk is all chatter with no politics .

  questions go on the student room , not here !, 
  the typical `` coming of age '' age in japan is 20 . 
  that does n't really excuse anything .

   ... when i saw happy miyamotto walk on that stage having so much fun and the excitement he was holding in to unveil this game gave me second thoughts . 
  he had the same enthusiasm about star fox zero . 
  hold back your excitement for now ... 
  i appreciate the direct format , especially the new , slicker one , for just that reason .
