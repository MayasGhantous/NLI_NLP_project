  e3 presentations have got pretty bloated as companies try to out-spectacle one another . 
  just to give a source to his claim , he was referencing [ this tweet ] ( https://twitter.com/trintran/status/874635297639645184 ) from bill :, 
   we 're about 90 minutes away from a short spotlight on nintendo switch holiday games followed by hours of nintendo treehouse live . 
  this reminds me of the time dunkey beat sky in smash . 
  nope , they get all the reveals out of the way at the beginning so they can spend the rest of e3 promoting them . 
  don-don-donuts !, 
  let 's go nuts !, 
  20 is the drinking age , marrying age , ( [ until very recently ] ( http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2016/06/18/national/politics-diplomacy/nations-18-and-19-year-olds-prepare-to-vote/ ) ) the voting age , and even comes with a [ coming of age ceremony ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coming_of_age_day ) . 
  creepy stuff like eromanga-sensei is only popular within weird otaku circles , and would not be viewed favourably by normal people . 
  that 's not far off super mario galaxy 's multiplayer ... ( which was actually quite fun tbh ), 
  amiibo 's what ? 
  this is dateposting on a new level, 
  i think it fits right in with the other 3d marios . 
  the [ 3d world theme ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3k2b2hsl7a ) is lower-key , but uses a lot of the same instruments . 
  [ the japanese trailer ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef5pyjq0a_y ) uses the english lyrics , so there probably is n't a japanese version . 
  removed , [ too slow ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/anime_irl/comments/6h9fp0/anime_irl/ ), 
  removed , [ too slow ] ( https://redd.it/6h7wmp ), 
  the scene starts getting blurry too close to the tower , and it does n't look like things get more blurry as they get further away . 
  this is an interesting concept and you nearly nailed it , but it does n't quite sit right . 
  anti-may , but certainly not pro-labour . 
  give source on that please ( \u3064 \u00b0 _ \u00b0 ) \u3064, 
  skyrim , rocket league , zelda dlc , payday 2 . 
  maybe none of those are quite enough to be a system seller on their own , but the switch library will be so good by that point that pushing a single game probably wo n't necessary . 
  formatting please !, 
  on reddit you have to use a double line break to start a new paragraph . 
  you can also come and discuss it in our discord server !, 
  ` negotiations ' has been a real buzzword in the uk lately , as our political party leaders try to convince us that they 're the best person to negotiate the terms of brexit . 
  what should we be looking for in a leader that shows they 're the right person for the job ? 
  i 'm a long-time brickfilm producer , and seeing the lengths the creators of this movie went to to pay homage to our weird medium had me welling up in the cinema . 
  this will always be a very special movie to me . 
  ooo i member, 
  you forgot the underscores in the subreddit names 0/10, 
  i gagged . 
  that 's the theme of humanz , everyone . 
  [ here 's a great little documentary ] ( https://youtu.be/3mbl93upm5o ) about the people who make this stuff . 
  [ message the moderators here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2fsplatoon ) . 
  in my experience they 're a bit slow to respond , though ... 
  yeah , at least weed bro does his own skits most of the time . 
  sarcastic bro just leaves smug comments on everything . 
  rude :(, 
  they 're giving out pins this time !, 
  i went with the official nintendo online store because you get a free cap or t-shirt with it . 
  also every time i see a screencap from this creepy show i get more disappointed with the world for letting it happen,

  the best response i 've seen so far . 
  they 're selling [ other splatoon apparel ] ( https://store.nintendo.co.uk/cool-stuff/characters/splatoon.list?widget_id=634278 ) too , like the takaroka mesh . 
  these days that 's rarely the case . 
  cg technology has advanced so much that even when directors try to use practical effects , they end up replacing some or all of it with cg . 
  skyfall is a good example - they made a model of mi6 , blew it up , but ended up doing the whole thing in cg because it gives filmmakers much more control over how things look and move . 
  you ca n't pre-order digitally through the uk store , i 'm afraid . 
  it 's physical-only if you want the cool stuff . 
  [ do n't click if you know what 's good for you . 
  ] ( https://redd.it/6hmfhn ), 
  i mean , that 's the point , is n't it ? 
  there are rules against posting songs that are too popular to ensure that what you find here is new , and a lot of these undiscovered songs are from indie artists . 
  i do n't think it 's a problem . 
  check out the [ beginner 's guide ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/gravityfalls/comments/5mu36n/how_to_watch_gravity_falls_a_beginners_guide_no/?st=j437m4vm&amp;sh=edaa5612 ) - it 's got tips to help you make the most out of your time watching the show !, 
  / r/newsokunomoral, 
  also search r/newsokur for [ \u7cde\u30b9\u30ec ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/newsokur/search?q=%e7%b3%9e%e3%82%b9%e3%83%ac&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all ) . 
  red text is hard to read . 
  i mean i can read it fine , it 's just not very comfortable . 
  white/yellow like most karaoke videos use would 've made it gentler on the eyes . 
  looks like it 's time for someone to learn about [ all the hidden messages they missed ] ( http://gravityfalls.wikia.com/wiki/list_of_cryptograms#season_1 ) . 
  it 's the lighting . 
  hey , at least miyamori has a decent job and is on her way up the career ladder . 
  always upvote shirobako etc. 
  rake fighting looks pretty tactical actually . 
  the fact that they get locked together is a hindrance to your movement , but you can maneuver to use it to your advantage . 
  get back to r/handholding , you dirty fiend you . 
  it really depends on context and how detailed the rest of your world is . 
  i like the face , but only as long as the props and environments the character is in feature a similar lever of detail . 
  regardless , i think the neck/chest could do with some more definition . 
  that would make the detailed area seem less out-of-place . 
  i was also hoping these guidelines would shake things up by making moderators behave better and finally giving us something to combat squatters . 
  and i was also disappointed . 
  i made a subreddit for my university a few years ago on an alt account . 
  the sub was pretty quiet and there was very little/no modding to do , so i left the account inactive . 
  the sub was then redditrequested by a serial squatter who removed me , added a whole collection of other accounts to the mod team and started posting off-topic stuff . 
  the day the guidelines came into `` force '' i messaged the admins to ask for help , and ( after a few weeks of silence ) was told there were no violations . 
  really ?? 
  your union flag is [ upside down ] ( https://apdinteriors.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/right-way-wrong-way1.jpg ) !, 
  [ they actually do n't . 
  ] ( https://www.pidgi.net/wiki/category:splatoon_series ) i was surprised too when i went looking for them yesterday . 
  it looks like the images in the album with bits missing are the highest-res versions we have available , and op ` shopped in bits from lower-res images to fill the gaps . 
  ... trolling us ? 
  they 're just having fun with the idea of splatfests , and how players can influence a game series . 
  the new game 's story mode is n't a punishment or anything . 
  perfect .
