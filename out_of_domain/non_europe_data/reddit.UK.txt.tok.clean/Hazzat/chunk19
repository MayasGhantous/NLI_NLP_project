  [ what is minecraft realms anyway ? 
  ] ( http://mojang.com/2013/03/what-is-minecraft-realms-anyway/ ), 
  nope !, 
  you 'll have to make your title pretty interesting to make people want to click on it though , there 's a lot to compete with . 
  i get this problem a lot , there 's really nothing you can do about it . 
  i find it goes away on its own after a little while but always comes back . 
  the only other thing you can do is restart minecraft whenever it happens , and [ submit it to the minecraft bug tracker ] ( https://mojang.atlassian.net/browse/mc ) . 
  they do well on most subreddits , bust you 'll notice that the front page of / r/mylittlepony is for the most part filled with high quality content : art , videos , music , more art ... 
  [ ] ( / a05 ) we prefer to keep the memes out . 
  yes , it 's a little fiddly but definitely possible . 
  a guide can be found in the [ optifine minecraft forum topic ] ( http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/249637-151-optifine-hd-b1-fps-boost-hd-textures-aa-af-and-much-more/ ) in the `` information for texture pack authors '' box , under the heading `` connected textures '' . 
  it 's not every thursday . 
  the sidebar says the next one is april 4th . 
  [ the glorious and ever-fashionable leader of north korea ushers in a new trend of facial hair !, 
  they 're clearly being all-inclusive . 
  you might have lesbian parents !, 
  i would n't call it karma whoring anymore when every single one of their comments is getting downvoted like crazy . 
  that 's too bad . 
  nah , i remember that and they said `` one of these crazy stories is actually real , find out which one by going to our website ! '', 
  i did and of course the least interesting one ( a frog having to have an operation because it broke its leg ) was the true story . 
  i still have n't forgiven them for that disappointment . 
  holy crap , miku wii u game !? 
  that sounds so coo -, 
  oh , it 's a card game ? 
  stained glass is perhaps the most requested feature to be added to minecraft , and i 'm sure if it was that easy it would have been done long ago . 
  however , all the showcasing of the minecraft 2.0 stained glass has highlighted the reason they have n't added it : you ca n't see anything transparent when you look through it . 
  water is invisible , portals are invisible , other stained glass blocks are invisible ... 
  if they do ever add it to the main game , i suspect it will only be after the long-awaited rendering engine rewrite . 
  wait it was an april fools joke and i fell for it aagagghhhh, 
  it 's real in the sense that you can download and play it , but it 's not actually going to be a real minecraft update . 
  yep , minecraft 2.0 is a big joke !, 
  i 'm in distress !, 
  oh , old media . 
  you should come visit / r/mylittleminecraft !, 
  it happens a lot . 
  most recently i think with sloths - there were silly sloth pictures and image macros on the internet for ages , but only recently have they really caught on . 
  now everyone loves sloths !, 
  huh ? 
  ohh . 
  * ohhhhhhh . 
  * i get it . 
  hmm . 
  it 's a picture of a literal reception through a nether portal . 
  it 's parodying [ this post ] ( http://redd.it/1bsz9g ) called nether reception . 
  it really depends on what skin you are making . 
  the hat layer 's main function is to allow you to add a little more depth/relief on the head of whatever it is you 're working on , and how you use it is totally up to your artistic vision . 
  if you 're making a regular human ( eugh , boring ! ), 
  you might use it for a hood , glasses , headphones or - dare i say - an actual hat , but you could use it for a spaceman 's helmet , a bushy moustache , a pair of bulging eyes ... 
  play around with it and see where it takes you . 
  i 'm not familiar with this app , but it looks like you copied your character 's head onto the hat layer , glasses and all . 
  if so , that 's your mistake : on the hat you want * only * the glasses , nothing else . 
  if you get it right , it will look like the guy 's glasses are floating just off the front of his face . 
  it will only be a small detail , but skins can look much nicer with that added bit of depth . 
  [ ] ( / pinkieawe ) i. . . wow , that 's awesome . 
  what 's the problem here ? 
  yep , the problem is with the texture pack . 
  the enderman_eyes . png needs to have a black background instead of a transparent background . 
  you should tell the texture pack author !, 
  [ ] ( / ppboring ) well , duh !, 
  this is inside the sun !, 
  the bright part is on the outside !, 
  do n't worry buddy , i put in [ a request ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/redditrequest/comments/1c7gbq/rsips_has_no_mods/ ) on / r/redditrequest to reclaim this place in the name of our * fantastic * leader . 
  it takes minimum 3 days to go through and i requested it 2 days ago , so / r/sips should ( hopefully ) be up and running for real pretty soon . 
  it was great up until the point where half the video was self-promotion on the creator 's part . 
  c'mon man , you do n't need 30 seconds of showing off how great you are !, 
  let the video you 've made speak for you !, 
  having an outro is fine , and it 's okay to have a long outro if it 's proportional to the length of the video . 
  ( so a 30-second outro on a 20-minute video is fine . ), 
  but if the outro is nearly 50 % of the total video ? 
  that 's kinda shoddy , and certainly disappointing to someone who was expecting a fantastic marathon of profanity in that sweet canadian accent . 
  i came here to read this comment thread , but it looks like ended up swallowing it all up . 
  absorbing comments counts as reading them , right ? 
  someone did try to claim it , but lacked the 500 karma points necessary . 
  i claimed it ( i think ) successfully , we just have to wait minimum 3 days for it to be approved and stuff . 
  i submitted the request 3 days ago , so hopefully / r/sips will be up and running again pretty soon . 
  you play a dangerous game . 
  i 'm an adult !, 
  oh absolutely , sips is in his element with anything crazy and violent . 
  hotline miami was the perfect match . 
  nope , but you can jump to different subreddits by typing the subreddit 's name in the font box . 
  i was n't expecting brogres here . 
  stay layered , friends . 
  a square number ? 
  a power of 2 would be more fitting . 
  we love you dinnerbone !, 
  never forget that . 
  i get the `` cube number '' joke , but powers of 2 are used everywhere in minecraft , most prominently in the 64-item stack ^ \\ ( although ^ 64 ^ is ^ also ^ a ^ cube ^ number ^ but ^ that 's ^ beside ^ the ^ point ^ okay ) . 
  karma gift vouchers ? 
  i never wanted to come this deep . 
  boddypen !, 
  i think i 'd be too tempted to pop that balloon with a slingshot ... 
  cool your boots , it 's fairly evident from all the responses in this thread that / u/minecraft _ newbie is trolling . 
  just laugh along !, 
  no , it 's not that . 
  it 's that such a ridiculously long outro is fairly poor video-making . 
  as i said before , it 's disappointing to the viewer who was looking forward to a longer video , and it should n't be necessary as the creator 's work can speak for itself . 
  are you sure ? 
  i have n't seen any proof for that either way . 
  i think giving reddit gold is meant to be for when you wish you could give ( or , indeed , purchase ) more upvotes for someone . 
  that 's the idea , anyway .
