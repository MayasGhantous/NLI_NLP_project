  according to the tour guide when i went on a tour of television centre a few years ago , the bbc decided to put as few people in the news studio as possible after some protesters burst into the room and handcuffed themselves to things while screaming in 1988 . 
  fewer people in the room means the door can be properly secured without being opened by people going in and out . 
  [ here 's a report on the protest .

  for those who want to watch it , [ here 's the video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xk_pi_nq838 ) . 
  the speech starts at 22:58 . 
  would it kill ya to source stuff smh, 
  oh , people have been walking about it . 
  the liberal democrats ( ~ ~ third ~ ~ fourth-largest party ) made a second referendum an [ election promise ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/liberal-democrats-tim-farron-second-brexit-referendum-reverse-general-election-maifesto-theresa-may-a7699256.html ) . 
  arguments against it normally go like `` are we just going to keep voting over and over until we get the right answer ? '', 
  i think too many of them are just scared of being accused of going against * the will of the people * , undermining democracy by going against an honest referendum - never mind that it was one perverted by huge misinformation campaigns . 
  our only chance is to put politicians in a position where they will aside their egos and party politics in favour of what 's actually best for the country , or elect some ones who have that attitude already . 
  chances of that happening ? 
  who knows . 
  you ca n't predict anything in these interesting times . 
  shout out r/gravityfalls - it 's the first place you should go if you 're interested !, 
  they were once every month , but i 'd expect salmon run to be more frequent and last longer . 
  also splatfests are returning in splatoon 2 . 
  could you make the flair selection box a little wider ? 
  even an extra 10px of space would allow the box to hold three columns and make scrolling a little easier . 
  the train fare into town is too high .

  the closest thing you can get to a take-home version is the [ analog digital clock ] ( https://appsto.re/gb/pjdhv.i ) app by the same artist , in which a man paints and repaints a digital display . 
  i 'm speechless . 
  i ca n't believe it worked .

  i love kate tempest . 
  every word is so carefully chosen and painfully relevant . 
  if you 're mad at the current political situation , i recommend listening to [ europe is lost ] ( https://youtu.be/qsvyyykaeoo ) ( video is nsfw ) and , if you 've got time , the whole let them eat chaos album . 
  it captures the frustrations and hope of living in modern britain like nothing else . 
  we do n't know what the splatoon 1 amiibo will do yet . 
  we do n't know !, 
  they 're probably different though . 
  i wrote to my conservative mp a few days after the election asking him to stand up against a collaboration with the dup , and this is what he had to say . 
   thank you for your email and feedback . 
   the conservatives and the dup are different democratic parties . 
  we do not agree on all things . 
  for example , i voted for same sex marriage , i am opposed to the death penalty , and do not agree with the dup on abortion . 
   having said that , there are areas of positive overlap on key areas -- like maintaining a strong economy , national security and delivering a successful brexit . 
  equally , the dup won the most seats and votes in northern ireland , so it is a mainstream political party , and the conservatives have worked in partnership with them effectively in the past . 
   in reality , voters have delivered a hung parliament , and we politicians have to make it work as best we can . 
  there is no other legitimate or viable alternative working government , and the last thing the country needs or wants is another election . 
   nevertheless , please rest assured i will bear your concerns in mind as we move forward . 
  while it was n't really what i wanted to hear , i was grateful for a thoughtful reply nonetheless .

  i would offer up my spirit there . 
  broadcasting to the world that you 're on holiday is bad too , as it means anyone who might want to break in to your house can feel assured that there will be no one there to interrupt them . 
  it 's definitely photoshopped - this is by [ liam wong ] ( http://www.liamwong.com/ ) , whose style involves heavily pushing the colours of his photos around so they look surreal and magical . 
  it 's an okinawan food restaurant . 
  gorgeous . 
  there 's so much to love about tohoku . 
  { legitimate psychological trauma : the show }, 
  my hype is through the roof . 
  i love everything about the world of splatoon , and ca n't wait to return to it . 
  c'mon the 21st . 
  where else are you meant to wear them ? 
  new and updated sub weapons and all-new specials are totally going to shake things up . 
  playing the game during the testfires and at preview events , i felt they 'd struck the perfect balance between keeping what made the original so great while * ahem * staying fresh . 
  i 'm guessing `` none '' was an option , meaning there are people who are n't anticipating anything than people who are anticipating fate : extella . 
  i removed all the things you just posted , because while they were mostly good , you need to * slow down * . 
  try one an hour . 
  or one a day !, 
  it 'll work out much better for you , and all of us . 
  [ linked elsewhere in the comments ] ( http://m.imgur.com/a/s8eao ), 
  seeing the medical mechanica building lit up gave me chills . 
  i 've missed mabase . 
  still cautiously optimistic , but optimistic nonetheless . 
  yes , they 're back with new music !, 
  removed , no piracy, 
  because these are specifically uk statistics . 
  there 's more to this country than politics ( thank goodness ) .

  [ splatoon 2 will have a miiverse replacement ] ( http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2017/06/18/splatoon-2-team-on-voice-chat-limitations-replacing-miiverse-and-lessons-learned-from-splatoon-1.aspx ) , probably built-in to the game itself . 
   ** nogami : ** as you pointed out , while we do n't have miiverse on the nintendo switch , we have made sure to allow players in the same way to post artwork on the ground and walls , or messages to other players . 
  so i think players will be able to continue communicating in an indirect fashion and seeing what players from around the splatoon 2 community are thinking . 
  i played in handheld mode both times i got to play the game at preview events , and the motion controls were smooth as ever . 
  the only downside , of course , is that you have to swing the whole thing around , screen and all , making it quite inconvenient . 
  it 's certainly playable ( my k/d was 14/1 , lol ) , but it 's probably the least optimal play style . 
  the grip/pro controller is definitely more comfortable . 
  there was no opportunity to muck around with settings , but i think a sensitivity slider is a given as there was one in splatoon 1 . 
  oh yeah , actually moving it is n't a problem . 
  but when you 're playing on the screen , having to move that screen around while you 're playing is not ideal . 
  did n't get the chance to try one . 
  i forgot how incredibly annoying this song was . 
  nice work . 
  and usually at lower quality , or at 30fps when the original was 60fps . 
  man , gamexplain is just the worst . 
  they work hard to get videos up about new information before everyone else so they can hoover up the clicks , but that 's about all they have going for them . 
  i could never support their videos . 
  he 's just as bad !, 
  yes , it will !, 
  i do n't expect arms to get quite the same splatoon treatment , because the updates started rolling out for splatoon straight away . 
  the first thing to get unlocked was ranked mode , which happened when enough players reached a certain level . 
  the official twitter accounts gave reports from day 1 about how close we were to that goal . 
  afaik , there 's been nothing like that with arms .
