  it will not happen . 
  just put it to rest . 
  i think it 's probably down to technical reasons rather than design choices . 
  the original splatoon had moments where it chugged a bit due to large amounts of particles , and the local multiplayer it did have was locked at 30fps , which took a lot of the fast pace out of the game and made it clunky to play . 
  the switch may have extra power , but they 're already using it to make he existing visuals look even better . 
  personally , i do n't think it 's an issue . 
  my sister and i love splatoon , but i 'm happy to sit behind and coach when she plays , and she 's happy to watch me play in the higher ranks . 
  you do n't have to be playing together to share the experience .

  the original video 's solution to traffic jams is to get everyone to switch to self-driving cars and build a world in which traffic jams do n't exist . 
  * do n't get cooked , *, 
  * stay off the hook !, 
  her rap breakdown was sweet . 
  got ta get those first impressions !, 
  it 'll be interesting to see if opinions change after the game comes out . 
  do n't worry , i 'm sure they 'll come around when we hear more of her * off the hook * rap breakdowns . 
  you are not aloooone !, 
  a prominent youtube `` sceptic '' - makes videos about science and anti-feminism . 
  nah , you can see the wires inside the brella are a different pattern to marie 's parasol . 
  the name ` iida ' is a play on the japanese word \u30a4\u30a4\u30c0\u30b3 * iidako * , which is , unsurprisingly , [ a species of octopus ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/amphioctopus_fangsiao ) . 
  of course it will . 
  splatoon 1 's in-game notifications about splatfest times were always in local time . 
  well ... you 're in for a nice surprise ? 
  [ nintendo store ( uk ) ] ( https://store.nintendo.co.uk/cool-stuff/characters/splatoon.list?widget_id=634278 ), 
  [ king of games ( jp/worldwide ) ] ( https://editmode.jp/en/special/pic-up-splatoon-series/ ), 
  sadly no , the us does n't have an equivalent official online store . 
  redbubble is all unlicensed , meaning the actual creators of the things you like ( eg splatoon ) do not see any of the money you pay . 
  it 's rife with copyright infringement and stolen artwork . 
  please do not buy things from redbubble , unless it 's totally original artwork . 
  depends on what country you 're in . 
  cool !, 
  this is n't new info though , we saw these outfits [ back in april ] ( https://youtu.be/8alvfmzi0zy?t=352 ) . 
  i 'm still wondering what the existing splatoon amiibo will do , especially the callie and marie ones . 
  the nintendo uk store only ships to the uk , so you 'll probably have to pay extra for a forwarding service to send it to you . 
  i just did a quick search to find some : [ forward2me ] ( https://www.forward2me.com/ ) , [ borderlinx ] ( http://www.borderlinx.com/us/en/ ) , [ skypax ] ( https://www.skypax.com/ ) . 
  the crucial thing that separates it from splatoon 1 invincibility specials is that you ca n't be invincible and attack at the same time . 
  you can charge into the enemy camp , but you wo n't be able to do much until you charge it up . 
  the invincible specials were a big ^ * source of frustration in the original game , so i 'm glad they 've all been re-thought . 
  the armour defends you against a single hit , which is a different to full-on bubbler-style invincibility . 
  given that most splatoon weapons work by firing many blobs of ink , that 's not actually so powerful ( although it can no doubt be used very tactically ) . 
  also we do n't actually know if you 're invincible inside the baller - it just looks like it because you 're in a ball . 
  it might just provide an extra shield , or nothing at all . 
  read again , look closer, 
  yep , [ here 's what it looks like ] ( http://i.imgur.com/6ct4xje.png ) .

  2019 is significant because we will be getting splatfests for two years , so maybe this is alluding to the date of the final splatfest ? 
  23 july 2019 is a tuesday though . 
  miiverse lives on in spirit !, 
  [ looking adorable .

  [ dozens of us !, 
  2 years, 
  honestly , i think you already know the answer to this . 
  i assume it 's meant to resemble a [ squid beak ] ( https://d38c5dutwb1t0j.cloudfront.net/pictures/1120xany/7/8/3/109783_squid-beak-mimic_bnxac8_630m.jpg ) , the closest thing real squid have to teeth . 
  i 'm sure they will though - the logos for rock vs. 
  pop ( japan 's first splatfest ) are pretty clearly a squid and an octopus . 
  you can see this during their song performance . 
  it comes from [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6kmp9znfle ) . 
  to be fair , there 's a picture of marina on the back . 
  ` thick ' is , ` thicc ' is not . 
  i like that pearl strikes a pose instead of just waving . 
  [ the final content update ] ( https://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/version_history#2.8.0 ) was 8 june 2016 , about 13 months after the game was released . 
  i ca n't believe it 's been one year since that fateful [ july 7th ] ( https://redd.it/4ro3h9 ) ( and crucial [ july 8th ] ( https://redd.it/4rtspa ) ) sparked the war over calendar posts that divided our community and threatened to split it in two along the fault lines of relatability . 
  can you * truly * relate to someone stating the current date ? 
  is it really anime_irl ? 
  the jury 's still out . 
  sorry , you 're not allowed to say ` fresh ' anymore . 
  it 's ` off the hook ' now . 
  nope , not until splatfest day . 
  delete your save data . 
  do n't worry , it 's not precious . 
  it 's memespeak for ` curvy ' or ` voluptuous ' . 
  it means ' a little extra fat in all the right places ' . 
  ( i feel uncomfortable writing this so please do n't shoot the messenger . ), 
  search r/animemes for ` thicc ' and you 'll get the idea . 
  start a new account or delete your save file . 
  let 's - plays are not and have never been popular on reddit . 
  they do n't really fit the format of the site . 
  this is n't a good place to post them . 
  hey , [ thinkgeek ] ( http://www.thinkgeek.com/interests/splatoon/?cpg=edm_102365647&amp;e=zgfuawvsbwvyodhaz21hawwuy29t&amp;msg_id=102365647&amp;et_rid=851495852&amp;linkid=102365647_feature1_splatoon&amp;utm_source=exacttarget&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=email_102365647 ) just started selling a few splatoon items in the us . 
  those would be totally unreadable when shrunk down to flair size ... 
  [ things that will never happen ] ( http://i.imgur.com/phih2nq.png ), 
  i posted about this yesterday , but i 'm sure she 's an octopus because her japanese name \u30a4\u30a4\u30c0 * iida * is a play on the word \u30a4\u30a4\u30c0\u30b3 * iidako * , which means ` webfoot octopus ' . 
  go to the red postbox on the left-hand side of the square . 
  this is no different to splatoon 1 , where callie and marie were front and centre , but there were a bunch of other in-universe bands too : [ squid squad ] ( https://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/squid_squad ) , [ bob dub ] ( https://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/bob_dub ) , [ hightide era ] ( https://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/hightide_era ) , [ chirpy chips ] ( https://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/chirpy_chips ) , [ dj lee fish ] ( https://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/dj_lee_fish ) and [ turquoise october ] ( https://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/turquoise_october ) . 
  they 're being expanded on a little in the new game - for example you can get [ band tees ] ( https://twitter.com/mk2light/status/882972886398414849 ) to rep your favourite in-game artist . 
  [ it certainly is !, 
  i was playing splatoon again today after being weirded out by the locked y-axis in splatoon 2 , and was shocked to find it has always been like that . 
  you are not alone in misremembering . 
  b makes more sense than x , because now the right analog stick is below the abxy buttons , not above them . 
  just take a moment to adjust and you 'll get the hang of it after a few games .
