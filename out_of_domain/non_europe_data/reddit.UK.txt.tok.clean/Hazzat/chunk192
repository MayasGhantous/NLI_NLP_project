  it 's 320x120 . 
  [ here 's a guide . 
  this person recently started their oc comics r/anime _ irl , because they 're technically relatable in the most banal way possible . 
  thankfully they never get upvoted . 
  this was probably in a newspaper , making it easy to just tilt the page as you read . 
  the tutorials do n't go into much depth beyond ` this is a chain . 
  there are some patterns that can cause chains . 
  work it out yourself by playing the game ! ', 
  i 've just about managed to get the hang of it and can set up a 5-chain no problem , but i would n't thank the tutorials for that ... 
  edit : for anyone struggling to get started , the sega youtube channel has [ video tutorials ] ( http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=pls9c4tvsx7klraxhc7q1nrvmibgolyhxh ) that are much better than the in-game ones for taking you beyond beginner level . 
  is that ... an angry bird flying into the world trade center ? 
  it would be pretty weird , given that he has a whole city named after him . 
  our subreddit 's man in japan u/frozenpandaman wrote us a [ thorough report ] ( https://redd.it/6j1hoj ) !, 
  \\  when i want to join the jp splatfest demo, 
  nah it 's okay , i 'm sure there are plenty of people here who have n't heard about the collab . 
  if you approach the chest from the front , he kneels down and opens it with his hands . 
  from any other direction , he just kicks it . 
  second picture , bottom-left . 
  i dunno , i 've got around a bit ... 
  under this username i 've done lego animation , mlp , minecraft , r/gravityfalls , squidboards , r/anime _ irl and related discords , some other stuff . 
  depends what kind of communities you 've been part of !, 
  i was meant to follow the wind ??? 
  i just guessed my way through the forest by running back whenever the fog closed in ... 
  according to [ this tweet ] ( https://twitter.com/splatoonjp/status/882973359226601473 ) , marina is 18 and pearl is her ` senpai ' ( i.e. 
  older than marina ) . 
  they 're fake characters made to populate the square when you 're not connected . 
  if you 've just connected for the first time ( like , just come out of the tutorial ) you 'll see these fake players because the game has n't had a chance to find any real ones yet . 
  if you go into a shop and come out again , they should update . 
  it 's a match made in the heavens . 
  as other commenters worked out , you can apply this information . 
  and i like u/nibblenipples . 
  as with the squid sisters , they are a duo and neither is the `` leader '' . 
  wait until the splatfest on saturday !, 
  it 's just a demo , you ca n't do anything until then . 
  you have to draw it with the splatfest world premiere thing . 
  also it seems i misunderstood a little - the winner is actually selected at random , so it does n't matter if you do n't feel like drawing something nice . 
  yep , so you can all play local multiplayer together . 
  when you have free copies of splatoon 2 to give away , every switch owner will be your friend . 
  6/18 is alex hirsch 's birthday .
