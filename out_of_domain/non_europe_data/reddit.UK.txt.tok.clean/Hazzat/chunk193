   okay everyone , do your best today !,

   do n't get cooked , stay off the hook !,

  again }, 
  it 's love live !, 
  sunshine !, 
  ! , which is basically the same story as the original love live ! , except the girls have different uniforms . 
  delete your save file ( do n't worry , it 's not precious ) or play it on a new account . 
  it 's a little less heartwrenching when you know the lyrics . 
   behold the man who is a bean . 
  farewell the man who is a bean .

  hover over the reddit logo and it refers you to [battleforthenet.com ] ( http://battleforthenet.com ) , which is where you can find resources that will help you join the ( incredibly important ) fight . 
  maybe you should edit that into your comment , as it is currently the top one and the site needs all the exposure it can get . 
  ca n't please everyone , i guess . 
  while i agree they could do a better job of communicating their message , it just came across as a bit silly to be complaining about the desktop site not working perfectly on mobile when it was n't designed to do so .

  there has to be something wrong with anyone who puts this little care into taking a nice screenshot, 
  hides all comment scores and sorts comments randomly . 
  it 's useful for contests when you 're using reddit upvotes to decide , as it removes a lot of potential factors that could lead to bias . 
  i saw her too !, 
  weird . 
  they are fake players made to populate the square when you 're not connected yet . 
  aww , the * s * e are cool but i was hoping for a new oob glitch in the square area . 
  i spent hours trying ( and occasionally succeeding ) to trigger the one in the last game . 
  physical because we get [ cool pre-order bonuses ] ( https://store.nintendo.co.uk/games/nintendo-switch/splatoon-2/games.list?widget_id=634273 ) in the uk . 
  bootleg weedbro ? 
  i joined your discord !, 
   it 's not like botw where the entire game had an overall minimalistic style, 
  uh , no it did n't . 
  botw was incredibly lush and detailed , even more than odyssey . 
  super-clean uis are part of nintendo 's new no-fuss branding , that carry from the simple design of the console , through the switch os menus and into the games themselves .

  sorry i 'm not able to give a detailed response to this stuff right now , but this is honestly the first time i 've heard about this . 
  afaik no one has reported any links to the offending blog or sent us modmail messages about it . 
  we 're happy to talk about it , but someone needs to bring it up first !, 
  \u306e\u3067 becomes \u306a\u306e\u3067 when it is placed after a noun or \u306a-adjective . 
  these both seem to have the meaning `` should do '' , but i was wondering if that 's actually the case and what the difference in meaning is . 
  i know there 's a difference in grammar , but i was wondering what the difference in meaning is . 
  charging into the enemy camp with the inkbrush 's sonic speed and hitting them with a splashdown where it hurts ? 
  do n't mind if i do ... 
  the game wo n't go away then , but we 've been promised content updates for a year and splatfests for two . 
  after that it 'll be like splatoon 1 is now - still fun , but never changing . 
  just the explanation i was looking for , thank you . 
  yes they can . 
  jaw-dropping work . 
  i just checked it out - you can get all the way up to their spawn point !, 
  thanks for sharing , this is a game-changer . 
  the aerospray is pretty fun and easy-to-use in turf war , because it inks areas so quickly . 
  the downside is that its short range makes it weak in toe-to-toe combat , but it suits you perfectly if if you 're the kind of person who just likes to hang back and ink things . 
  it 's a fun idea in theory - role-play being a teenager who uses a part-time job to fund their hobby , working whenever there 's a shift available , with those shifts dictated by salmonid migration patterns . 
  in practice though , being told `` you ca n't play today '' just sucks , especially when salmon run is so much fun . 
  when did you get the game , and what insane number of hours have you put into it since then ? 
  having a shower/bath ? 
  because you use sponges in the shower/bath . 
  it 's just random banter . 
  very bad bot, 
  there is none . 
  nintendo have n't even mentioned it . 
  definitely '' [ chalk up ] ( https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/chalk%20up ) '' . 
  i think it 's a bit tacky . 
  this is so cool !, 
  i do n't disagree that it 's a cool building ( and it 's definitely very * evil * ) but to me , the over abundance of statues and details , and ugly appropriation of old european styles push it out of beautiful and into gaudy . 
  for big american hands . 
  removed , do n't talk about that stuff here .

  saved you a click : a study has shown that playing casual games helps you work better by reducing stress . 
  therefore you must buy a switch so you can play games at work . 
  i sent it off to them once before for this issue , but the note i got back said the issue they fixed was `` wifi conection [ sic ] not working '' . 
  i 'm going to sent it off again tomorrow ( which means missing the splatfest :( ) but i was wondering if anyone had any solutions that meant i would n't have to do that . 
  shoulda told the repair team that . 
  i reported to the customer support people that the problem was the joycons and even included a letter in the box explaining the issue , but they got it wrong and `` fixed '' the wifi connection , which was never an issue . 
  customer support has been very sympathetic and has assured me that my repair will be given priority when it arrives at the service centre this time . 
  the situation sucks , but they 're trying to make it right . 
  the voice chat setup looks great !, 
  super convenient to handle while i 'm playing . 
  it 's okay, 
  and remember that bad times ... are just times that are bad .

  it could n't have been # 1 when it was released , because the music charts were n't invented back then . 
  aww man , i knew that but forgot to include it . 
  please fix your sound mixing , we can barely hear you . 
  ( [ sorry ] ( https://youtu.be/i-hwdw1gaxg ) ), 
  that 's not unusual ... 
  { wakuwaku girls }, 
  a bit of both , combined with the fact that your voice is lost to the echoey environment and general lack of diction when you 're speaking . 
  always think about the audience and how they will perceive you . 
  `` ooh , i do n't mind it really . 
  it 's quite smooth in the hand ... '', 
  `` hired ! '',
