  also the uk arbitrarily being labelled ` great britain ' with northern ireland separate . 
  and generally wobbly borders all around . 
  try the subreddit discord server , it 's linked in the sidebar . 
  this is high-level dateposting . 
  he is gorgeous . 
   it crashed other people 's games, 
  i know there was a huge furore over this , but we never saw anything to back it up . 
  it was based on one person 's claim and a few other people saying `` uh , i think maybe that happened to me too ... '', 
  it did * okay * . 
   from the date of its release to november 28 , 2006 , agents sold 120,000 copies . 
  reggie fils-aime has stated that while sales were strong , he was disappointed that they were not better , having expected 300,000 copies sold in light of critical acclaim .

  eba was my first thought too , because i loved that game to bits and am still a bit sad that we never saw it return . 
  it never stopped . 
  let 's continue . 
  that 's not party time - that 's time to make use of every spare second and ** push !, 
  part of the [ summer vacation collection ] ( https://splatoonus.tumblr.com/post/164073668844 ) ? 
  where is agent 3 in the image ? 
  now you 're thinking with brellas . 
  the same thing happened with me and its precursor , mouth sounds . 
  weirdly addictive . 
  it 's interesting that he never touches on the sprinkler - he 's only interested in the weapon and its special . 
  i think the sprinkler is a pretty important part of the kit , but if this guy 's happy to go without it ... 
  they do n't . 
  you can only see them by looking up the battle in splatnet 2 on the app . 
  for a more positive experience all around , maybe ? 
  welcome to the world of r/emojipasta . 
  now this is dateposting . 
  yeah , it goes back to [ the first game ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vydalgn.png ) . 
  r/splatoongeartrade ( is kinda dead but maybe we can revive it ? ), 
  also you could try the subreddit discord . 
  removed , you ca n't just go reposting [ one of the top posts of all time ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/anime_irl/comments/64qssr/anime_irl/ ) and expect to get away with it, 
  aww now i feel bad, 
  13 august 2023, 
  it helps with the subversion of expectations . 
  everything in the image looks normal until the liquid leaves the bottle . 
  a normie who doesnt read the goddam subreddit rules smh, 
  and every week we remove it, 
  yep , [ see here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/anime_irl/comments/6r23yk/anime_irl/dl28quc/ ), 
  ais will not make alliances under any circumstances in this version of the game . 
  so much for that one civic boost . 
  you should go to a party in france then , i guess . 
  or you can use this to bypass the region filter : https://www.youpak.com/watch?v=ycfnzgybtem, 
  observation wheel !, 
  you need a double line break to start a new line in reddit formatting . 
  or use * instead of . 
  for your bullet points and it 'll automatically format into a nice list . 
  yep , it was until 16 august . 
  we do n't know !, 
  you can edit your existing post to make it easier to read, 
  why not render once , and recolour everything in compositing ? 
  the gameplay is fun , but the worldbuilding really got me hooked . 
  i love how rooted this world is in modern-day japanese youth culture , with all the locations , brands , fashion styles , music and general attitude being based very closely on what 's trendy right now in real-world tokyo . 
  i love it . 
  the music is especially impressive - i listen to quite a lot of japanese indie rock/pop , and the amount of oddly familiar tropes the splatoon soundtrack parodies blows me away . 
  they truly know their source material . 
  i 've seen this image a bunch of times , but i just realised it 's the acropolis at lindos , greece . 
  i was there just a few weeks ago . 
  go in the morning when it opens and there will be no tourists to begin with . 
  now just chotto a minute there mate . 
  japanese net-slang has its own word for ` normie ' : \u30ea\u30a2\u5145 * riajuu *, 
  you 're being so gumwaa right now .

  it just takes a quick google . 
  pretty slow on the uptake with this meme , eh . 
  absolutely stellar . 
  top quality date posting . 
  yes . 
  i used to draw on miiverse all the time , but have n't posted anything on splatoon 2 because i do n't wan na post it on another platform .

  fun fact : japan and parts of china will experience their own total solar eclipse in 2035 . 
  i can not get over what an eyesore this hideous , tacky building is . 
  a truly evil work of disgusting architecture . 
  become a time lord, 
  tag spoilers please, 
  not yet . 
  human immortality is still in development , hence the non-serious answer . 
  new favourite sub, 
  no it 's not, 
  you are too far gone, 
  it 's both . 
  there 's only one disconnect . 
  you can tell the difference because a disconnected player 's weapon icon will still be in colour , whereas a splatted player 's weapon icon is flat grey . 
  the pagoda being chinese - rather than japanese-style removes any authenticity and makes the painting feel tacky when it need n't really . 
  it 's weird because pearl is kinda meant to be the bitchy one while marina is the giggly upbeat one , making it seem extra mean whenever she throws shade at her co-star . 
  please do n't support or promote redbubble - everything there is unlicensed , and it 's a hotspot for people making money off stolen artwork . 
  they were talking about patreon , which does require the ability to pay for things online . 
  see also , the similarly grid-shaped [ milton keynes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/milton_keynes ) . 
  the tweet says details will be released at a later date . 
  i 'll wait as long as it takes . 
  zero . 
  it wo n't happen . 
  i think the reasons are more technical than artistic . 
  the game already seems pushed to its limit , optimised to stay 60fps at any cost . 
  displaying two players ' viewpoints would be a huge extra load that the console ca n't handle . 
  splatoon 1 's very simple local multiplayer was locked to 30fps , which felt * suuuuper * slow and clunky by comparison . 
  playing online like that would feel horrible and put you at a huge disadvantage in such a fast-paced game . 
  they do n't usually reveal new maps in time with updates - often the updates will add the map data secretly so they can be unlocked for everyone at a later date .
