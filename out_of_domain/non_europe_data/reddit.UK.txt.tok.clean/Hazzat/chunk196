  this is so aesthetic,

   `` what role does yuzuki serve in your room ? '',

  imagine walking down the street wearing this , sunglasses on and a fidget spinner going full tilt in each hand . 
  no one 's gon na mess with you . 
  sure why not, 
  whoops , you 're right !, 
  i added an extra zero by mistake ... 
  it 's on the album demon dehhs . 
  it 's a meme - see the ` eat pant ' section of [ bootleg bart ] ( http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/bootleg-bart ) . 
  makes me proud to be a r/yurop \\ - ean . 
  it 's written like the next-episode-preview of an anime . 
  `` next time : ` mr tri-slosher nouveau ' . 
  do n't miss it ! '', 
  we do n't have any information , so no one can answer this with certainty . 
  but probably . 
  the frame blending makes it so hard to see . 
  much better , thank you !, 
  `` apart '' is the opposite of `` a part '', 
  the top caption is completely unnecessary, 
  they were joking that you wrote `` 1/3th '' instead of just `` 1/3 '', 
  you nailed the arm movements . 
  spoken like a true maki fan . 
  jeeeeeesus , how does someone 's worldview get * this * twisted ?

  am i missing something here ? 
  it 's a lovely moment to capture , but it 's not really a work of photography . 
  there 's no attention to composition , so my eye is flying all over the place . 
  random shapes and objects hang off the sides of the frame . 
  clutter like the open drawer does n't add anything to the story and distracts from the focus . 
  the colours outside the window are oversaturated like an ugly hdr image . 
  obviously not every picture has to be a work of art , but then what is it doing in r/itap ? 
  thank you for the detailed reply . 
  i agree that there 's beauty in broken rules . 
  interestingly , when i wrote that comment i was looking at it on a computer monitor , with the size of the image emphasising all the messy details . 
  i could n't take my eyes off them and got lost in the clutter . 
  now i 'm looking at it on my phone screen , it 's much easier to enjoy the moment , with everything feeling more harmonious . 
  i still do n't think this photo is all it could be , but i can see what there is to like a bit better . 
  and at level 27 , that 's a * lot * of turf war under her belt . 
  it would take a while , especially if you 're only playing turf war where you score fewer points and levelling up takes longer . 
  they 're c - , which usually means they just started playing ranked . 
  you could just put all of sunshine on the left .

  you take what you can get . 
  they did n't answer the question !, 
  now we 'll never know which is better ... 
  bad luck i guess .

  pewdiepie has a history of making borderline ( and sometimes not-so-borderline ) racist jokes and comments in his videos , which yesterday prompted firewatch developer sean vanaman to [ file a dmca claim against his firewatch video ] ( https://twitter.com/vanaman/status/906983575337107456 ) and bar him from ever making a video about their games again .

  happy birthday !, 
  they also offer deals they wo n't accept 90 % of the time , although i 've never seen a totally empty deal like this before ... 
  you 're right , there is n't much to do after dark . 
  although there are lots of idol shows from little groups trying to make it big . 
  not until 23 september buddy, 
  me too !, 
  wish i 'd got a photo with it before i left .
