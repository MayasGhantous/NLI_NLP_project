  really ? 
  it provides more mobility options by letting you ink long lines , and gives you extra range for your damage . 
  plus you can still do the old-style jump-flick if you start the flick just before you jump . 
  { very depressing idol show }, 
  it 's strange . 
  unlike most idol shows , in which the cast overcome challenge after challenge by doing their best and giving their all , wug 's story is about the girls repeatedly getting screwed over by the worst of the people in the industry while they ca n't do much about it . 
  but it stops short of being a bitter tale of exploitation . 
  the story goes movie -  12-ep series -  movie -  movie , so maybe watch the first movie and see what you think ? 
  it 's not my video \u2642, 
  you kinda busted yourself there , / u/miraoister .

  false positive, 
  thank you !, 
  i 'm actually alright with it , because i mostly worked on the video in little two-second snippets ( which is why the video took so long to make ) so i never got tired of it . 
  but i think i need to listen to the rest of vacation now so i can feel like i 've moved on . 
  the way actually runs all over europe , in a multi-national web of walking routes that all converge on santiago in north-west spain . 
  you can start from pretty much anywhere in europe , if you 're prepared to walk . 
  the route you described is the camino frances , which is the most popular trail . 
  ergo , make your life a joke and nothing will beat it !, 
  at profeshional 800 + , you 're definitely earning those rewards . 
  i would n't consider it abuse . 
  you see just as many videos of people doing this weird wacky stuff in america though .

  nice to see / r/thewaywewereonvideo getting a shout out . 
  it 's a warm and fuzzy subreddit . 
  ohhh !, 
  the moonquest lego animation was removed ages ago and i never worked out why , but this makes sense . 
  the old twitter style ( egg profile picture , ` follow ' button with a gradient , star icon to favourite ) being used despite the date apparently being august 2017 is a pretty big giveaway .

  a city without any advertisements is a unique sight . 
  the video pitches this device as an alternative for people who are too socially awkward to high-five . 
  no need for body contact here !, 
  this is correct - a marker shows after you break the beakon . 
  we 've had this image [ come up before ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/fakealbumcovers/comments/7040rb/hip_with_the_kids_by_the_whippersnappers/?st=j7s4ytji&amp;sh=864359af ) , but i much prefer your design for it . 
  they say `` high touch '' instead !, 
  here 's a summary :, 
  * interviewing people on the street . 
  `` can you high-five ? '', 
  `` no , not really ... '', 
  * according to our survey , 99 % of people can not high-five !, 
  * it 's embarrassing , uncool ... 
  but we have the solution to the problem !, 
  comfortable high-five ! ', 
  * interview subjects love it , say they could high-five with this . 
  * ( sofa scene ) going in for a high five is too awkward . 
  but if you use mr. 
  comfortable high-five ... everyone will enjoy !, 
  * compared to a previous model , mr. 
  comfortable high-five has 10,000 the amount of * polusamiilu x ' ( made-up drug ) , making it very healthy, 
  * interview with a housewife : `` i do n't have any opportunities to high-five , but since i bought this i feel that i look much younger . 
  as a busy housewife , this is an excellent product . '', 
  * interview with a cyclist : `` when i 'm riding my bike , i ca n't high-five anyone . 
  but when i have this product , i * can * high-five . 
  and i can do it safely . 
  i wholeheartedly recommend it . 
  * interview with millionaire : `` just after i bought this , i won 100 million yen in the lottery . 
  i am truly glad that i bought mr. 
  comfortable high-five . '', 
  comfortable high-five is also taking off in new york . 
  a top designer says that it 's vintage , it evokes the 90s . 
  a stampede came running to get hold of this design . 
  comfortable high-touch will remove soy sauce stains from your fabrics . 
  * it 's available for only 225,000 yen . 
  and that 's not all !, 
  you 'll get an extra pair of hands absolutely free if you order now . 
  * we humbly await your call !, 
  it 's got a lot of the same upbeat energy that love live has , so i think you 'll enjoy it . 
  the points it lacks compared to ll are the visuals are a bit less polished , and the central cast of 15 ( ! ), 
  characters makes it a little difficult to care much about any individual .

  [ too slow ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/anime_irl/comments/718jak/anime_irl/ ), 
  nah , b + is just easy pickings . 
  is n't the clash blaster basically that ? 
  are you talking about cinderella girls ? 
  because the dance scenes in the original im@s show are fairly lacklustre - there 's lots of cutting away to other things to minimise the amount of actual dancing that had to be animated . 
  after seeing the things people have linked here , i have to agree that when the idolmaster characters dance , they * dance * . 
  the constant cuts away just felt a bit cheap in comparison to ll 's full music videos , but it 's totally forgivable as im@s came three years earlier . 
  also i should clarify that when i wrote `` visual polish '' i was thinking of art direction as a whole - colours , backgrounds , effects , character designs that all work well together - rather than the actual animation .
