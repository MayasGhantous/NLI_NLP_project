  the world of ll is bright , sparkly and more fantastical than the more grounded im@s . both have their strengths , but when it comes to idol shows which are all about sparkly fantasies , i personally prefer the look of ll . 
  the first of the idolmaster clips there is cinderella girls , which is the successor that came later , and definitely surpasses the original love live ( but maybe not the love live successor , love live sunshine ) . 
  other than that , it 's difference of opinion . 
  that 's because i put an @ symbol in it . 
  those are n't mutually exclusive,

  this happens when someone disconnects from a match , and you are dropped in to take their place in the lobby as soon as the match ends . 
  please refer to [ the beginner 's guide ] ( https://redd.it/5mu36n ) pinned to the stop of the subreddit, 
  there are currently no plans for an official splatoon tournament outside japan . 
  no , that 's why it 's linked in the beginner 's guide .

  the very bottom of the tower is a bit blurry when it should n't be , but this is otherwise fantastic . 
  the song choice is just because of the opening lyric :, 
   do you remember ? 
  the 21st night of september ? 
  ... which happens to be today . 
  i appreciate your timing .

  it does n't really , it 's just someone dancing . 
  maybe they 're celebrating that september is nearly over and halloween season is coming ? 
  absolutely recommended . 
  it 's like no other city on earth . 
  you 'll be fine with only english . 
  everything is signposted in both english and japanese , announcements are in both languages , and people on the whole are very hospitable and eager to help . 
  r/japantravel is a good place to start collecting information .

  it 's not quite that dire - [ here 's a video ] ( https://youtu.be/tvfs5fsavoi ) of the required parliamentary debate after the ` do n't offer trump an official state visit ' petition reached 100,000 signatures . 
  it was n't in the actual house of commons , and i doubt it had much of an effect , but it was n't just one person in a room . 
  basically someone made a dumb video in which grunkle stan says ` joaje ' and it became a huge and insufferable meme on the subreddit . 
  you could n't go anywhere without seeing people making references to it . 
  it got so bad that we had to start [ automatically removing any reference to it ] ( https://redd.it/3soia3 ) to try and slow the insanity . 
  people got tired eventually , and now we look back on those times with warm nostalgic fuzzies .

  absolutely awesome . 
  thank you for sharing . 
  it 's more of a glottal stop , i think . 
  source is [ muda-zukuri on youtube ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/mudadukuri ) , who seems like the japanese answer to simone giertz .

  i love how every aspect of the splatoon universe is somehow a remixed aspect of japanese culture . 
  she 's definitely a fan . 
  [ in this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vr-lju3xfyw ) she shows off her own make-up robot , and at the start she talks about how she was inspired to make it by watching simone 's videos .

  u/simsalapim , please make it happen .

  / r/wholesomeanimemes, 
  god i wish that were me, 
  yeah i was actually joking to get a reaction , but everyone took it seriously and seems to agree . 
  `` man i wish i could skip the tutorial '', 
  my deviantart :, 
  i 'm a budding pony/general artist , and up until now i 've been using adobe illustrator to draw things and photoshop to colour in , but every time i see something that was drawn in photoshop , i feel i 'd do better if i was using that instead . 
  i 'm struggling to draw anything but basic side-on ponies in illustrator , so i 'm leaning away from it . 
  so which one should i be using ? 
  i think derpy hooves is best pony . 
  not necessarily for her character , design or personality ( although the versatility of those three certainly adds a lot to her charm ) , but because she represents our crowning achievement as a community . 
  the legacy of derpy is one that will no doubt be discussed in years to come , by media and perhaps sociology lecturerers . 
  the creation of derpy as a character was a result of us being crazy about the show , and the fact that a little girls ' show managed to capture the minds of teenage/young adult males to that extent is enough to warrant some sort of legend as it is . 
  the the fact that this animation error 's personality was noticed by the production team also says a lot . 
  but the fact that they liked her so much that they not only began referring to her as derpy in the official storyboards but also stopped all the presses to put her derpy eyes in the show itself says so much about what we can now achieve through the internet . 
  derpy hooves represents the closing gap between old media and new media . 
  up until now , what we watch on tv and in films , what we read in the news and hear on the radio has been kept solely in the control of those channels and the companies who own them . 
  derpy is directly a result of the viewers ' intrest in the show . 
  she was created by the bronies and thanks to our communication with those who create the show , an idea of ours has become part of it . 
  adventure time also do this to an extent ( with the gender-swap characters ) which is just another sign of the changing times . 
  derpy is more than just a googly-eyed background pony . 
  she is more than an in-joke between the team and the fans . 
  she is a repercussion of our influence as a movement . 
  she is a sign of a changing world . 
  she is a sign of new voices being heard where there were n't before . 
  derpy is us . 
  derpy is best pony . 
  she 's also really cute . 
  i 'll be adding a background and colouring in the eyes , but i 'm sure there 's more i 'm missing ... ( it 's been a while since i last drew a pony ! ), 
  yesterday i came to this subreddit and decided `` y' know what ? 
  this place needs some sprucing up . '', 
  so i made us a simple little header image , and created a bunch of flairs for you to choose from . 
  they 're all from [ the love and tolerance texture pack ] ( http://www.planetminecraft.com/texture_pack/love-and-tolerance-texture-pack/ ) . 
  it 's very easy to make more , so if your favourite block/item/mob is n't there , just comment here , send me a message or write in with mod mail and i 'll add it just for you . 
  keep crafting , bronies !, 
  seriously , has no one realised how unrealistic the game 's graphics are ? 
  the tiny number of polygons and low-res textures might have been acceptable for a game early in development , but it 's unacceptable for a game this old and popular . 
  sort it out mojang !, 
  as a new player to minecraft , i had no idea where my screenshots were being saved when i hit f2 . 
  it took me a few months to discover where they were , and it seemed very daunting and unintuitive to have to fetch them from the back end of beyond , past mentions of unfamiliar things such as % appdata % and . roaming . 
  my suggestion is to allow an option to decide where your screenshots go . 
  it 'd be much more convenient to have them dropped automatically into a folder on my desktop or in my pictures folder than to have to make my trek back there every time . 
  i think it would also make the game feel a little more professional and polished . 
  i was playing minecraft and i was annoyed that i had to go everywhere really slowly so i had this idea that you could find groups of cars spawning in the wilderness ( maybe in mushroom biomes so they are not too common ? ) ? 
  you could tame them with red stone and then drive them around . 
  [ ] ( / scootaplease ) that was my idea , if anyone could get jeb or dinner bone to see this i would be very happy .
