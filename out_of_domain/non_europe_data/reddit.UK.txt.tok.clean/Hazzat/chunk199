  / r/getstudying, 
  or i suppose you could try to wake this one up again . 
  / r/redditrequest can help with that . 
  i spent the last few days/weeks playing and tinkering with the subreddit 's style to make it look 20 % cooler ^ \\ ( sorry ) than it did before , as well as updating the sidebar to included more useful resources . 
  i 'm pretty happy with it , but let me know what you think !, 
  i 'm more than happy to make changes if you 'd like to see them made . 
  this is a very small thing , but ... 
  every time i get a cat background on / r/minecraft , i ca n't help but notice the fact that the joint on the cat 's tail is a little misaligned :, 
  it would n't take much to fix ^ \\ ( i ^ think ) , and would set minds at ease !, 
  i do n't know about you , but i 'm really looking forward to this movie . 
  i was sad to see not much going on in this subreddit , so i made this theme and put it forward . 
  here we are !, 
  naturally i 'd like to see place used to share cool eqg media ( pictures , videos ) and talk about the movie favourably , but as it says in the sidebar , open discussion is welcome . 
  remember , [ the magic of friendship never changes !, 
  ] ( http://images.wikia.com/mlp/images/c/cf/equestria_girls_may_6_2013_movie_poster.jpg ), 
  [ ] ( / twiapple ) not many yet , but more will be added in the future . 
  please add these to bpm !, 
  who is your favourite unsung hero, 
  mine is jeb, 
  friends , i regret to inform you that on 24:56 of sim city # 41 , robabank ceased trading and closed its doors . 
  it also spontaneously disappeared and turned into a construction site at the same moment . 
  it was a true landmark of the san fransipsco skyline . 
  please share your memories about it here . 
  i have fallren for the trap , and brought dishonarabu to my clan . 
  it seems this is what i must do . 
  help me / r/sudokuwatch !, 
  i see no other way out !, 
  to celebrate [ the official hatsune miku facebook page ] ( https://www.facebook.com/pages/hatsune-miku/10150149727825637 ) reaching 1 million likes , crypton kicked off this `` findme '' contest , where all you have to do is tell them roughly where you live and you get entered into a prize draw to win a trip to miku 's next big concert ( or some vocaloid merch , if you prefer ) . 
  now if that is n't the coolest prize for a contest ever , i do n't know what is . 
  ### why is it so important ? 
  aside from the fact that the prizes are ** amazing ** , the really important part of this is the part where * you let crypton know whereabouts you live * . 
  with project diva f getting a us/eu release and miku english just around the corner , it 's clear that crypton is really eager to expand vocaloid 's presence across the globe . 
  and in order to do that , they need to know where to expand to !, 
  if you fill this in , crypton will be happy because they know there are vocaloid fans where you live , and you 'll be happy because it 's just become a little more likely that there will be an official vocaloid event in your area in the future ( and you 're entered into the coolest prize draw ever ) . 
  crypton are ideally looking to get every single vocaloid fan to sign up to this , which is why the prize is so big . 
  so once you 're done , send it to your friends !, 
  please try to get all the vocaloid fans as you know to help crypton out and put in their details . 
  we 'll all be really grateful for it in the future . 
  ** tl ; dr : ** crypton ( creators of hatsune miku & friends ) is trying to work out where all the vocaloid fans in the world are , and they need you to tell them . 
  [ the form takes 20 seconds to fill in !, 
  [ ] ( / egb00 ) hey there , wondercolts !, 
  i really hate having things spoiled for me , so i 'm conscious about protecting people from spoilers as much as possible , especially here on the subreddit . 
  but , at the same time , i do n't want to keep tagging loads of stuff here as spoiler material . 
  let the thumbnails be free !, 
  so at what point can we safely say everyone visiting here has seen the movie ? 
  here 's a little calendar of upcoming * equestria girls * events to educate your opinion :,

  ** edit : / r/mylittlepony has left eqg spoilers run free as of now , so is it time for us to do the same ? 
  since the early days of this subreddit , it 's seemed clear to me that although sips has a * lot * of catchphrases , many people find it hard to think of the most appropriate one . 
  i think it would be beneficial for us all if we had a comprehensive collection of all the catchphrases , which you can refer to whenever you feel your sips-isms are n't up to scratch . 
  let 's make it together !, 
  leave your favourite catchphrase in a comment and it 'll go on the list :, 
  * you big dumb dumb, 
  * aww sheeeeit,
