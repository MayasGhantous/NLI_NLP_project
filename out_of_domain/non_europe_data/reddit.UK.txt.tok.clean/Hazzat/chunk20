  that 's not true , [i.reddit.com ] ( http://i.reddit.com ) shows cakes . 
  it shows flairs too , as long as the flairs are just text . 
  the only way is to stop using paint !, 
  photoshop , paint.net and gimp are good alternatives . 
  if you 're serious about pixel art , [ graphics gale ] ( http://www.humanbalance.net/gale/us/ ) is what mojang uses ( as seen on their mojam livestream ) . 
  how the heck is this a meme irl . 
  i said * minimum * 3 days . 
  it says on the subreddit that if you 've waited 5 days and have n't heard anything , you should pm the admins . 
  it 's been just over 5 days and i 've done that , so it really should n't be long . 
  the admins are doing a favour in this service , being patient is important !, 
  yeah , my initial reaction was `` oh my gosh oh my gosh yoshi 's island '' , but when i realised the old art style is all but gone , my heart sank a bit . 
  the charm in the old game was n't really in the control mechanics , it was because it was so pretty . 
  get yourself [ mediahint ] ( http://www.mediahint.com/ ) and you * should * be able to watch it . 
  either way , [ this page ] ( http://theweek.com/article/index/242849/watch-jon-stewart-and-stephen-colbert-react-to-the-boston-marathon-bombing ) has a transcript . 
  [ ] ( / trixiesmug ) about time . 
  that title is basically reddit 's attitude too . 
  it could happen !, 
  [ bug reports go here !,

  [ ] ( / rohhi ) you should show this to / r/mylittleminecraft !, 
  yeah , he really got it !, 
  on top of being enthused by the technology , he recognised that there 's still a creative process in making vocaloid songs and it 's not `` soulless '' just because it was made in a computer program . 
  hats off to him for that response !, 
  if you ever have a hankering for some power-fueled sociopathy , brohoof.com will always welcome you back orsch .

   ** what belongs in this subreddit : **, 
   * memes that you see in real life ( books , posters , etc ), 
  * memes you see being used online ( advertisements , etc ), 
  * memes you see being used for virtually anything, 
  you attach the rope to the animal and fence while it 's still on the ground , then break the blocks underneath the animal . 
  did n't you pay attention to minecraft 2.0 ? 
  it 's sheep that do the flying nowadays . 
  it 's from [ this '90s apple promo video ] ( http://youtube.com/watch?v=kio2_fdsdao ) . 
  the thumbs up in question is at 8:06 . 
  you need to put the fence above the animal to begin with . 
  make a tower of 7 blocks , place a fence on the side of the top one , put the animal next to the base of the tower and leash it to the fence . 
  the leash should still be intact and the animal still on the ground . 
  you are then free to break the blocks underneath it and enjoy your suspended cow/chicken/sheep / etc. 
  ... i do n't think you understand what tilt-shift is . 
  `` joke '', 
  the magic of css !, 
  whoever designed the subreddit set it so '' ,037 '' would appear after the subscriber and ` online now ' numbers . 
  this makes 20,527 look like 20,527,037 . 
  does it spin ? 
  that does n't necessarily require mcedit ( which is what he used , not worldedit ) - i think you just need to make a rail on top with some powered minecarts going round , put some animals in carts getting pushed around up there and leash the animals in the carts to the dangling animals . 
  maybe ? 
  i have n't tried it . 
  i do n't know about leashing animals together ( i have n't played with the snapshots much , eh ) , but i do know he had to use it to make one pig invisible and one pig ride on a powered minecart , which obviously is n't possible without hacks like that . 
  the company might have an online library you can search through . 
  lucky voice is a karaoke franchise in the uk , and [ you can search through their library on their website ] ( http://www.luckyvoice.com/ ) . 
  look up karaoke bars in the area you 're going and see if you can do the same there . 
  oh god, 
  my heart stopped, 
  help, 
  i 'm gon na need a transplant for all the blood i 'm losing through my nose, 
  there 's nowhere else to go . 
  there 's nothing to be done . 
  they 've been in the game for a very , very long time and mojang 's attempts to fix the issue so far have been ineffective , or resulted in very long loading times . 
  it 'll be fixed one day , but today is not that day !, 
  ^ edit : ^ typo, 
  correction : the hearts are because feeding the fish also puts the ocelot into breeding mode , which is why the hearts appear . 
  thank you !, 
  it 's the second thing i 've ever made with css and i wanted to make it really pretty before trying to get it off the ground . 
  what you 're looking for is / r/projectcss !, 
  it seems you are confused : this subreddit for for * brogres * , not fans of * borges * . 
  edit : here 's some more appropriate subs . 
  * / r/literature, 
  * / r/shortstories, 
  * / r/readitnow, 
  * / r/math, 
  i hope you find what you are looking for !, 
  i do n't think you quite understand what a snapshot is . 
  a snapshot is a preview of a future update , and mojang releases them once a week ( most of the time ) to get lots of people to test it for bugs and issues . 
  the current snapshots are previews of the 1.6 update , which has not been released because it is n't finished yet . 
  the latest snapshot , with horses included , is called 13w16a and can be downloaded from [ mojang 's site ] ( http://mojang.com/2013/04/minecraft-snapshot-13w16a-and-new-launcher/ ) . 
  in my experience , this many signs in one area caused terrible lag and a huge frame rate drop . 
  perhaps it was just the server , a plugin or the minecraft version that caused it , but that 's just what i 've found . 
  yah , i realised that a bit late . 
  thanks anyway though !, 
  oh man , i had n't even thought about that . 
  my wild world town was called spoon , so perhaps i 'll go for another item of cutlery ? 
  * squueeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaalllll !!!!!!, 
  * i love you joe !!!!!, 
  [ ] ( / ppshrug ) it still does n't quite make sense ... 
  they must have sticky hooves or something . 
  you 're looking for / r/mcservers . 
  honestly , if i 'd only been shown the intro and not any actual episodes , i would probably be equally sceptical . 
  hey , was n't there a website that let you send a bag of poop to any address on the front page a while ago ? 
  not that i 'm implying anything here . 
  in a comment , gingefringe said it was delivered at night to avoid confrontation . 
  the organisation behind it is [ spuc ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spuc ) . 
   when everyone spawns them in, 
   flatcore server, 
  which do i believe ? 
  from the sidebar :, 
   \u2022 eli5 is not for literal five year olds . 
  it is for average redditors . 
  preschooler-friendly stories tend to be more confusing and patronizing,
