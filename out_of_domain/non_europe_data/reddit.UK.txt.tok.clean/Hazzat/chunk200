  i 'm a terrible hoarder of both clothes and furniture , so maybe i 've got what you 're looking for ? 
  as the dvd/blu-ray of * equestria girls * is now out in the usa , / r/mylittlepony has decided to remove the need for spoiler tags on * equestria girls * - related content . 
  so / r/equestriagirls is doing the same !, 
  after [ the response i got on the subject ] ( http://redd.it/1ifinw ) i was planning to wait a little longer , but i figured it 's impossible to dodge spoilers anyway if they 're all over the mane sub . 
  ^ ( * spoilers regarding future episodes of mlp : fim or the comics will still need to be tagged though ! ), 
  dofiretick is great , but i would find it tremendously helpful to have even more gamerules related to world protection , such as ones that prevent :, 
  * ice melting, 
  * leaves decaying, 
  * grass spreading, 
  * water/lava flowing, 
  these would allow for a lot more flexibility in creative builds ( including adventure maps ) , and would allow servers with worlds protected by worldguard to have their maps be more useable in single player . 
  i have a whole bunch of fossils that are clogging me up , and i figured it 'd be better to give them to people here than to just pour them down the re-tail black hole . 
  here 's what i 've got :, 
  * diplo skull, 
  * ~ ~ mammoth torso ~ ~, 
  * ~ ~ ptera right wing ~ ~, 
  * ~ ~ pachysaurus tail ~ ~, 
  * ~ ~ parasaur tail ~ ~, 
  * plesio neck, 
  * sabertooth torso, 
  * ~ ~ raptor torso ~ ~, 
  ** 5000 bells each !, 
  i 'm on the hunt for [ harmonious furniture ] ( http://moridb.com/items/search?category=&q=&obtained=&interior=harmonious&fashion= ) ( rustic japanese stuff , basically ) , so if you have any of that spare i 'd love to have it . 
  if not , the bells will do too !, 
  olaf wants to convince people to `` send flowers and mean it ! '', 
  he also mentioned something about people that look like squirrels , but i was n't really paying attention . 
  i 've got a little pile of fossils and i 'd rather not just send then all to re-tail . 
  i 'd much rather sell them to you guys !, 
  * sabertooth skull, 
  * sabertooth torso, 
  * mammoth torso, 
  * spino torso, 
  * plesio neck, 
  * raptor torso, 
  * shark tooth, 
  5000 bells a piece !, 
  she so desperately wants to visit your town ... 
  and only your villagers can sign it !, 
  i suppose i can give you bells or something in return if you want , but is n't the true payment knowing that you 've helped a fellow animal crossing player complete a little quest set by a scary clown sheep ? 
  these are all from * totoro * . 
  i know the name of the little girl in the film is mei , which explains why `` niece '' came up a lot when i tried google translate . 
  thank you !, 
  #for now it 's just mane 6 canes , but we may branch out in future . 
  edit : we branched out,

  ~ ~ [ it looks like our stylish emoticanes wo n't officially be making it into the betterponymotes browser extension ] ( http://redd.it/1rhrlc ) which allows ponymotes to show up all over reddit , but no matter !, 
  you can add it yourself manually , and here 's how . ~ ~, 
  ### step 1, 
  #install [ betterponymotes ] ( http://rainbow.mlas1.com/ ) ( duh ) . 
  ### step 2,

  ### step 3, 
  #scroll aaaaall the way to the bottom of the preferences to the heading labelled ` custom subreddits ' . 
  type '' ` thecane ` '' into the box and click ` add ' . 
  now emoticanes will show up everywhere !, 
  [ ] ( / twicane ) [ ] ( / raincane ) [ ] ( / ajcane ) [ ] ( / ppcane ) [ ] ( / raricane ) [ ] ( / fscane ), 
  ### bonus step, 
  #i suggest you add '' ` equestriagirls ` '' in that box too , because / r/equestriagirls emotes are pretty bangin ' , but were denied betterponymotes status because apparently they 're not ponies or something ( ??? ) . 
  if you have any further questions , i 'll be happy to answer them .

  brogrea and ogirls of the swamp , we heard news that a subreddit known as / r/cancerous had been `  implying ` that shrek was dreck . 
  we attempted to negotiate , but diplomatic relations turned sour , and i can announce that ** we are in a full-scale war against / r/cancerous ** . 
  we need ** you ** to go over there and give them what for . 
  post and comment all you can to prove once and for all that shrek is not dreck .

  the golden-eyed among you will have noticed [ a little ad ] ( http://www.reddit.com/comments/1ry040/hail_to_the_cane/ ) placed at the top of / r/mylittlepony over the last few days . 
  it was a little experiment by me and / u/m33rkat to find out how effective reddit advertising is when it comes to promoting a subreddit . 
  the ad has finished running , and the results are in !, 
  ** facts : **, 
  * the ad ran for 3 days , friday 13th-sunday 15th, 
  * it showed up on the front page of / r/mylittlepony , and the front pages of its subscribers, 
  * it was seen a total of 14,742 times ( seeing an ad is called an `` impression '',
