  in conclusion , it was n't that effective . 
  the unique visitors and page view numbers were only slightly above average , and that might just have been because it was the weekend . 
  but i do n't think the minimal change was reddit 's fault , it was probably down to :, 
  * the very short window of time the ad was up . 
  * the fact that / r/mylittlepony regulars - who were mainly the people being targeted - probably already knew about / r/thecane , thanks to relentless comment spamming at its very mention . 
  * the fairly vague title i gave it - i 'm not sure whether that helped or hindered . 
  but if you dare suggest people were n't interested because the meme is mostly dead and people have kinda lost interest , i swear i 'll have your head put on the end of a shiny golden rod !, 
  thanks for sticking around folks . 
  hail to the cane !, 
  ** tl ; dr : nothing much happened , it was probably my fault **, 
  is it varying much ? 
  will it take off in the future ? 
  is it a wise investment ? 
  when i first signed up for art classes , ` putty eraser ' was on the list of supplies to bring . 
  i took those classes and many more since , and not once has it ever been mentioned . 
  it 's just been sitting on my desk and i 'm not really sure what to do with it . 
  when would i choose it instead of a rubber eraser ? 
  does anyone know any establishments that accept twilicoin ? 
  i have called up several places to ask , and they were confused . 
  when i explained , they laughed me out . 
  i found it very disappointing .

  the brogre `` fandom '' began as a parody of bronies , but spread far beyond its intended reach and has become a community in its own right . 
  its main followings lie [ on tumblr ] ( http://www.tumblr.com/tagged/shrek ) and [ facebook ] ( http://www.facebook.com/shrekisloveshrekislife ) , and i 'm eager to expand its presence here on reddit . 
  anyone can join , because there 's not a single person in the western world who has n't seen * shrek * . 
  the community is dedicated and itching to share their shrek-related findings ( which they put a surprising amount of effort into ) with a larger audience , and it 's impossible for so few of us to aggregate all the relevant content . 
  at the rate the amount of it is growing , i 'm certain it 's going to take off . 
  we just need your help to make it happen .

  ### spoilers, 
  [ the colourful tube ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ztegjmq.jpg ) used to drop emmet back into the lego universe has `` magic portal '' written on the side of it . 
  why ? 
  because the first lego animation ever made was called ... [ the magic portal ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jde4qhbctsg ) . 
  greetings laddies !, 
  / r/brogres has just passed 1,000 subscribers , and i am truly honoured that so many of you have smelled the aroma of his stenchy presence . 
  i invite you all , friends and farquaads alike , to celebrate this achievement with us . 
  the ogrelord 's influence continues to spread far and wide . 
  to mark the occasion , i would like to share with you a story - the true story - of how brogres came to be . 
  [ the uk of equestria ] ( http://ukofequestria.co.uk ) - a site for bronies from the uk - is an odd place . 
  it 's home to an insane plethora of in-jokes and , formerly , a strong contingent of people who hated almost everyone else there . 
  this group of friends , so frustrated by the site 's poor management and annoying cliques that had formed , set out to parody the ridiculous behaviour of some of the users by attributing it to shrek . 
  ** [ this is the first-ever use of the word `` brogre '' on the internet !, 
  ] ( http://ukofequestria.co.uk/threads/i-ruined-my-derpy-hooves-shirt.6201/#post-276140 ) **, 
  [ the original ` brogres ' facebook page ] ( http://www.facebook.com/brogreswamp ) ( now deleted , rip ) initially did just that , but it grew to something more . 
  when [ the first `` shrek is love , shrek is life greentext ] ( http://i.imgur.com/zkybg.png ) was posted on 4chan , that signalled the start of it spreading elsewhere . 
  and that 's how we got where we are today . 
  thanks for hanging around - here 's to many more brogres joining us in the future . 
  i signed up to be a youtube partner the day the scheme went public in 2007 , and it looks to me like nothing has changed . 
  i can still upload a video , verify i own the rights to it , switch on ads and receive money . 
  but somewhere along the line , it seems a whole new system was set up . 
  now there are networks , content id , video monetisation without being a partner ... what happened while i was n't paying attention ? 
  i tried reading the wikipedia article on it , and it did n't really explain . 
  i 'm in the process of overhauling the subreddit style to make it look as good as the lady herself . 
  hope ya like it . 
  if you 've got any feedback , you can leave a comment , or [ send us modmail ] ( http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2fnataliapoklonskaya ) if you 're shy . 
  something on / r/nataliapoklonskaya is causing the top link on the page to be unclickable . 
  ( to see this in action , try to click the sticky , or open its text field . 
  nothing happens ! ), 
  i think it has something to do with . pagename , as the unclickable area used to be larger , but shrunk when i removed ` margin-right : 1ex ` from it . 
  what 's the problem here ? 
   some facts about crimean attorney natalia poklonskaya you may probably not know . 
   natalia is 33 years old crimean attorney . 
  she is divorced and has a daughter . 
  she seems a real good girl : she plays piano and draws , probably she attended music and art school in her childhood . 
   natalia worked as attorney for 12 years , according to her own words , and just sometime ago her workplace was in kiev , in main attorney office of ukraine . 
  i do n't know much about attorney 's job in western countries , but in ex-ussr countries attorney 's work is very significant : they take part in investigations , act as accusers in courts , collect petitions from citizens and check if police and courts maintain the laws . 
  people often think they are more trustworthy than police and judges . 
   her career seems very successful and productive for me . 
  she tells about numerous criminals and gangs she sent to jail . 
  her most well known enemy was `` bashmaki '' gang , one of the biggest and strongest gangs in ukraine , famous for their criminal wars , for using rpg ( and missing , destroying some unrelated building by mistake ) , jailbreaks , murders of police , former `` alpha '' ( russian analogue of swat ) members and hundreds of another crimes . 
  her current rank is called `` adviser of justice '' . 
   during the events in kiev , she was working in main attorney office in kiev . 
  she is the witness of maidan and her harsh words about new ukrainian goverment should be considered along with any other evidencies , because she saw everything with her own eyes . 
   after the putsch in kiev , she left attorney office and returned to crimea . 
  crimean council of ministers offered her to take over a post of crimean attorney and she accepted it . 
  it happened several days before referendum . 
   after her new appointment she recieved a letter from kiev with a notification , that she 's no longer attorney and adviser of justice , kiev started investigation of her actions and even tried to ruin her reputation , but could only found some fotos you can now see everywhere . 
  they are pretty usual photos every beautiful woman should have , but officials in kiev called it `` ribald '' and acted histerically . 
  probably they just could n't find anything dirty about her at all . 
   just after referendum another provocation happened . 
  ukrainian soldier and crimean man were killed by some unknown person . 
  according to natalia 's words it 's very similar to killer , who shot people on maidan and acted as a calamity trigger to kiev . 
  now she 's hunting him and preventing bloodshed and chaos in simferopol . 
  maybe she 's even saving our lives right now . 
  ** tl ; dr : natalia solves murders , she catches killers and she has no dirt on her . 
  she 's a total badass . 
  is there any reason to keep it ? 
  should i just sell it all off to the pawn shop ? 
  i know i 'm sitting on a small fortune here . 
  one of my miis just made this request of me , so i said `` sure ! '', 
  did i just make a commitment ?
