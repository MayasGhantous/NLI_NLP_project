  is she expecting me to push her to the top of the ` most pampered ' list now ? 
  ( which is hard , given that she 's nearly 200 points behind the current leader . ), 
  i do n't wan na let any of my miis down !, 
  zoey was asking for song ideas for the miis on mushbury island , so here 's one i wrote . 
  it 's a rap duet for sips and sjin , under the group name sipsco . 
   ** dirty boyz **, 
   big money , women fun, 
   you know we 're the one, 
   we 're sipsco and we sell dirt, 
   by the ton !, 
   dig it up, 
   ship it out, 
   that 's what it 's all about, 
   counting our cash, 
   while we splash, 
   in our pool , so flash, 
   dirt that 's bombastic, 
   not being sarcastic, 
   sipsco is effin ' fantastic !, 
  edit : lol i just saw the latest episode , never mind i 'll leave this here anyway , 
  [ ] ( / spikewtf ) what 's up with that ? 
  i did n't go this year ( although i really wanted to ) but still hoped i could live out the experience vicariously through stuff everyone else was posting . 
  but i 've barely seen * anything * !, 
  am i just looking in the wrong places , or are all the attendees really just keeping quiet ? 
  i spent a few hours creating this swanky logo in / r/hazzat _ 2 ( try hovering over the words `` gravity falls '' and see what happens ) . 
  i 'd like the animation to play backwards when the cursor is no longer hovering over the logo to prevent it just snapping back into place . 
  is this possible ? 
  ##### fancy header , woo, 
  blah blah, 
  hi there , folks !, 
  i 'm one of the newer mods here on / r/gravityfalls , and i was invited in because i had some * craaazy * ideas about [ a makeover ] ( http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120816040416/gravityfalls/images/e/e0/s1e6_facial_mask.png ) for the subreddit . 
  i 've been mucking about with it for a while now , and want to know what you guys think !, 
  ** you can see it in my test subreddit , / r/hazzat _ 2 . 
  ** it 's not finished yet as there 's still some stuff ( like the tabs at the top ) i need to decorate , but you can see where it 's going . 
  do n't miss the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance - what happens when you hover over the words `` gravity falls '' !, 
  [ ] ( #rgf 16 ) so , do ya like it ? 
  what should i change ? 
  should i keep going ? 
  should i just give up and drop it ? 
  you tell me !, 
  thanks for reading !, 
  ** after about a month of work , the redesign of / r/gravityfalls is complete !, 
  ** it 's been a really fun project , and i hope you all like it . 
  thanks to those of you who gave feedback - i know some people asked for a different header background , but that meant all i could do was keep stalling until the perfect piece of background art surfaced . 
  if something good comes up , i 'll be sure to use it . 
  ~ ~ also , for some reason the first table of emotes does n't work and i ca n't figure out why . 
  i 'm working on it . 
  : / ~ ~ emotes are fixed !, 
  in the meantime , pick yourself a flair from the sidebar ** -  ** and settle yourselves in . 
  season 2 is gon na be a crazy ride !, 
  i recently gave / r/gravityfalls a facelift , and for some reason half the emotes ( the ones listed in ` gf table ' in the sidebar ) do n't show up when i try to use them . 
  for example in [ this comment ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/gravityfalls/comments/2f31q6/proposed_subreddit_redesign/ckangrw?context=3 ) should have a picture of mabel with glowing eyes at the front of it . 
  the confusing thing is that the other half of the emotes ( in ` gfb table ' ) * do * work , and they use the same copypasted code , just with the image changed and relevant values swapped out . 
  i ca n't wrap my head around why this is happening , so any help would be appreciated !, 
  i 'll admit i 've been a little behind on the show lately , but while i was catching up i picked out a few choice faces for the sub . 
  | [ ] ( #bill ) | [ ] ( #pacifiwhat ) |, 
  | bill | pacifiwhat |, 
  while i was at it i tweaked a few things around the place , which included redoing the flairs so they 're a little crisper . 
  so as the season moves on , we 're going to want more emotes from the new episodes !, 
  you can use this thread to suggest them by posting a nice clear image of your suggestion here . 
  ^ ( and if you * really * want to make our job easy , you could always cut it out , give it a transparent background and shrink it to 70x70 ... ), 
  [ ] ( #gf 20 ) i will be checking back on this over the next few months , so do n't feel like you ca n't suggest stuff just because you turned up late . 
  happy emoting !,

  i 've been making lego animations ( `` brickfilms '' ) for 7 years , so in addition to talking about the films posted above , i can wax lyrical about the history of brickfilming , and the unique community that surrounds this niche art form . 
  ama !, 
  [ ] ( / egb14 ) after months of waiting , * rainbow rocks * is out today !, 
  if you can , please go and see the movie in the cinema to support the hard-working team that made it . 
  but if you , like me , are n't in the position to do that because you 're outside the us or whatever , you 're gon na be waiting for the movie to show up online . 
  if the release of this movie is anything like the last one , we 'll be seeing some blurry recordings over the next few weeks until the blu-ray/dvd release on 28 october . 
  then some kind soul will rip it and upload it for everyone to see . 
  i spoke with the / r/mylittlepony mods and they said ** all * rainbow rocks * spoilers must be tagged until 48 hours after an hd rip is uploaded ** , so we 'll be following the same rule . 
  [ ] ( #dipponder ) i know a lot of you like the animation that plays when you hover over the subreddit name , so i figured a few of you nerds might like to know how it was made . 
  i 'm gon na do this in the form of a tutorial so you can play along at home !, 
  ** obtain the original animation from the show **, 
  for this , i used a screen recorder to grab the intro in a nice high quality . 
  ** bring the video into photoshop **, 
  wait , a video in photoshop ? 
  yeah !, 
  ps has [ this amazing feature ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jdnqrxz.png ) called `` import video frames to layers ... '' where it basically converts your chosen video into a big gif . 
  [ select the relevant part ( the end of the intro ) ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bigqilx.png ) and click ok . 
  alright , so now we have an animation and [ it looks like this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/0irqbca.png ) . 
  go to window  animation to get the handy box at the bottom . 
  every frame of the video is on its own layer , and you can use that box to scroll through all the frames . 
  delete any extra frames at the start and end you do n't need , and press \u25b6 to watch it play over and over !,
