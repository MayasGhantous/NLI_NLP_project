  [ ] ( #dipmad ) we 're doing things a bit different this time !, 
  this is the more serious `` discussion thread '' , where you can * sensibly * discuss and reflect on the latest episode . 
  this is the counterpart to the '' [ reaction thread ] ( http://redd.it/2yi53a ) '' . 
  go there if you just wan na be crazy . 
  ** season 2 , episode 11 : ` not what he seems ' **, 
  you can watch the episode :, 
  * in the us : [ watch disney xd ] ( http://watchdisneyxd.go.com/ ), 
  * everywhere else : [ invisionweb.us / gravityfalls ] ( http://invisionweb.us/gravityfalls/app.html ) ( thanks / u/scarlet _ j ! ), 
  the next episode will air in summer 2015 . 
  firstly , the spoiler embargo is now over , so you 're free to post what you like without having to spoiler-tag it . 
  ( this is a little early , but [ the official blog ] ( http://gravi-teamfalls.tumblr.com/ ) is posting spoilers so i guess we can too . ), 
  man , that was a hectic event !, 
  the traffic spiked [ higher than i 've ever seen it ] ( http://i.imgur.com/27doe2m.png ) and i was hiding spoilers , removing posts and leaving comments like crazy . 
  still , it was good fun and it looks like everyone had a good time . 
  i 'm interested in feedback about what you thought of the way things were run here . 
  was it an improvement to have [ pre ] ( http://redd.it/2ygw0r ) , [ during ] ( http://redd.it/2yi53a ) and [ post ] ( http://redd.it/2yiada ) threads ? 
  was it a good idea to remove all the text posts of people listing their every thought , and instead direct everyone to the discussion thread ( s ) ? 
  has [ this image ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vtkxqlb.png ) been posted enough times yet ? 
  you tell me !, 
  [ ] ( #gfb 03 ) thanks for being such a great community . 
  buy gold !, 
  yesterday alex hirsch was possessed , his twitter feed [ went crazy ] ( http://i.imgur.com/7baqc6v.png ) , and through the corruption it was hinted that *** someone * will be doing a reddit ama on [ april 1st , 11:30 pm pdt ] ( https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=april+1st%2c+11%3a30pm+pdt+2015 ) ** . 
  almost all the tweets have since been deleted . 
  who will it be ? 
  many have theorised it will be ** a certain creepy triangle dude in a snazzy hat ** ... but who knows ? 
  it could be anyone !, 
  the mods do n't have any answers because we 're just as surprised as you . 
  we 'll be around anyway to make sure it goes smoothly ... ( alex , if you 're reading this , please [ message us ] ( http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2fgravityfalls ) ! ), 
  since alex hirsch 's cryptic announcement that [ a mystery ama ] ( http://redd.it/30mdq6 ) will be taking place on reddit on april 1st , 11:30 pm pdt , we 've had a number of new visitors arrive who are a bit confused about what 's going on . 
  i figured i 'll answer some of the questions many of you have so you can be a bit less confused by the time the ama rolls round . 
  #what is reddit ? 
  reddit is a site where people can post things they think are cool , and other people can vote them up and down . 
  this means that unlike other sites ( twitter , tumblr ... ) where you 're just shown everything in the order it was posted , stuff on reddit is sorted by everyone 's votes , and the best stuff rises to the top . 
  so remember to click the up arrow next to anything you think more people should see !, 
  [ this comic ] ( http://imgur.com/jxl2s36 ) does a really good job of explaining the site . 
  #what is reddit.com/r/gravityfalls ? 
  this is where you are now !, 
  we are the reddit community dedicated to sharing and discussing things related to * gravity falls * . 
  we are entirely fan-run and do n't have any affiliation with alex hirsch or disney . 
  people here like to share fan art , theories and other stuff with other * gravity falls * fans . 
  if you 've got something * gravity falls * - related that you 'd like to share , you can click the ` submit a link ' or ` submit a text post ' buttons on the right-hand side . 
  just make sure you read the rules in the sidebar first !, 
  we normally look like [ this ] ( https://web.archive.org/web/20150317134520/http://www.reddit.com/r/gravityfalls ) , but we 've redecorated in a spooky fashion for our guest 's arrival . 
  #what is an ama ? 
  * ama = ask me anything *, 
  an ama is a big question and answer session , where one person makes a post saying `` hi , i 'm _____ - ama ! '', 
  and people reply in the comments with their questions . 
  if you 'd like to see some example amas :, 
  * [ alex hirsch 's ama ] ( http://redd.it/1kgq85 ), 
  you can expect the upcoming one to be a little different though , given that it 'll be with a * terrifying mind demon * ... 
  #i want to see the ama , where do i go ? 
  just make sure you 're here at [reddit.com/r/gravityfalls] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/gravityfalls/ ) on [ april 1st , 11:30 pm pdt ] ( https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=april+1st%2c+11%3a30pm+pdt+2015 ) to see it happen live . 
  the ama will be pinned to the top ( like this post ) and there will be a big link in the sidebar so you wo n't miss it . 
  our mysterious ama participant will make their post , and you will be able to ask them questions in the comments . 
  if you ca n't be here at that time , do n't worry !, 
  you wo n't get to ask questions or watch the answers come in as they happen , but you 'll still be able to read the whole thing later . 
  no doubt we 'll have plenty of links to it about the place , so you wo n't miss out . 
  [ ] ( #bill ) i hope that explains everything !, 
  if you have any more questions , ask them in the comments of this post . 
  it 's okay to be new !, 
  ** buy gold !, 
  and so are you !, 
  boy and girl inkling amiibos , plus a squid one ~ ~ exclusive to the splatoon special edition bundle ~ ~ . 
  ** edit : ** the squid is exclusive to the special edition bundle in europe , but will be part of the 3-pack in north america . 
  [ here 's the video . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcnbjx8etqs ) amiibo bit starts at 1:47 . 
  it 's everything i dreamed . 
  it 's the only way bill will hear you !, 
  it went ** awesomely !!, 
  ** * thank you * to everyone who showed up for making this such a cool event . 
  everyone was a good sport , asked some great questions and bill came out with some killer answers . 
  we had a whole bunch of visitors from other parts of the gf fandom stop by ( as evidenced by our [ traffic stats ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/gravityfalls/about/traffic/ ) ) and [ they had quite a response too ] ( http://tumblr.com/tagged/gravity-falls-ama ) . 
  watching everyone getting so into the event was the most fun i 've ever had on reddit . 
  now for some housekeeping : ** how long should we keep this bill subreddit theme around ? 
  ** i was going to remove it pretty quickly after the ama , but it was more popular than i expected . 
  ** [ vote here !, 
  did you enjoy the event ? 
  what was the best part ? 
  do you have any feedback for the mods ? 
  let me know in the comments !, 
  with splatoon , i 'm planning on buying amiibos for the first time , and i was wondering what the best way to go about it is . 
  is there a best place to shop ? 
  do we have the same scalper problems as the us ? 
  do i need to be ready and waiting the moment they go on sale ? 
  you asked for it !, 
  click the above link to revert to the spooky , dark theme we had during bill 's ama . 
  i 'll get a theme-switching button up in the sidebar whenever i come up with a nice design for it . 
  there might be a few issues , so if you find them , please leave any feedback below . 
  [ switch back to the normal theme ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/gravityfalls/ ), 
  [ ] ( #puppetmabel ) kristen schaal , actress , comedienne and the voice of mabel pines , will be doing an ama on / r/iama this friday , april 17 , 5pm edt . 
  the ama will be about her career in general , which includes * gravity falls * , * bob 's burgers * , * flight of the conchords * and [ that one ` weird al ' music video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zq7eki5ez8o ) . 
  check out [ her imdb for more ] ( http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1102891/ ) , and make sure you 're there to ask her some questions !,
