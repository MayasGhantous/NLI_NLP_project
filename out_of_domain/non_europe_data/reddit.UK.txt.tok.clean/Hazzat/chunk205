  i played it back in september at egx in london , and i thought it was so much fun . 
  aiming with the gamepad was a little fiddly , and squid transformations are n't as fluid as you might think , but it only takes a minute to get the hang of both . 
  also , our team totally won . 
  what did you think ? 
  i 've been a stop-motion filmmaker for years , and given that all my films have been shot on an ancient sony handycam , i think it 's time for an upgrade . 
  that old camera was great , because despite its age , it had everything a stop-motion camera needed , including :, 
  * full manual control . 
  * the ability to focus * really * close on tiny subjects . 
  * live feed to my computer 's stop-motion software . 
  [ here 's an example of a film i made with it . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6djxyr6b9g ) i think the colours look really nice !, 
  i 've been searching around to find something to replace it , but there are n't many ( any ? ), 
  tech reviewers who talk about this specific niche of photography/filmmaking . 
  what do you suggest ? 
  as you 're no doubt aware , we 're twiddling our thumbs all the way through a show hiatus that 's going to last another 2-5 months . 
  * gravity falls * is n't the only show out there , so let 's help each other out and find some new stuff !, 
  what have you been watching ? 
  and why would other * gravity falls * fans enjoy it ? 
  it 's mostly pretty basic information in there , but there 's some cool pictures and info on some weapons that have n't been detailed yet . 
  go check it out !, 
  if you 've visited this subreddit for even five minutes , you 'll be familiar with the work of [ moringmark ] ( http://moringmark.tumblr.com ) . 
  he is perhaps the * gravity falls * fandom 's most prolific and loved fan artist , and he is gon na be here to answer your questions tomorrow , ** [ saturday 9 may at 11:30 pm utc ] ( http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=moringmark+ama&iso=20150509t2330&p1=1440 ) ** . 
  i hope to see you there !, 
  not only are its twists and turns , ups and downs a total nightmare , but the pair of glider jumps right before the finish line means no matter how far ahead you are , any joker with a few mushrooms can snatch the first place crown from your grasp . 
  i 've dropped from 1st to 4th on the home straight because of that . 
  damn i hate cheese land . 
  particularly to do with battling , i 'm getting destroyed by every enemy and i 'm not even out of podunk . 
  / r/gravityfalls has been private for the past few hours in support of some [ reddit drama ] ( http://redd.it/3bxduw ) that kicked off yesterday . 
  many other subreddits have done the same to express solidarity with the cause . 
  however , i am of the opinion that reddit drama is super dumb , so we 're back . 
  you can carry on posting your `` author of the journals '' jokes . 
  what did you think ? 
  who do you think won ? 
  the hiatus is nearly over !, 
  for those of you who joined this community during the break , or those who do n't have the greatest memory , i thought i 'd remind you how things roll around here when it 's episode time . 
  * about 15 minutes * before the episode airs , we 'll post an ** episode reaction thread ** . 
  this is where you can chat along as stuff happens , react and go crazy . 
  all episode reactions should be confined to that post - any new posts that go something like `` woah did you see that '' will be removed to keep the place tidy . 
  * about half an hour * after the episode ends , we 'll post an ** episode discussion thread ** . 
  this is where you can * sensibly * what you just saw , make theories and predictions without having to get bogged down in the residue from everyone 's minds being blown . 
  if you want to see an example , here are the [ reaction thread ] ( http://redd.it/2yi53a ) and [ discussion thread ] ( http://redd.it/2yiada ) for ` not what he seems ' . 
  ^ ( * exact times tbc ), 
  if you are able to , please * please * support the show by watching the episode live on disney xd . 
  if you ca n't for some reason ( like if you 're outside the us ) , you can watch it on [ this livestream ] ( http://themysteryofgravityfalls.com/stream/ ) . 
  [ ] ( #gf 16 ) not long now !, 
  ** edit ** : i added the times , and we 'll also be having an ** prediction thread ** posted at midday edt on the 13th . 
  thanks for the suggestion !, 
  hi / r/santabarbara , i just wanted to tell you how this city changed my life . 
  back in 2010 , i was a nerdy 15 year-old from suburban england with an interest in filmmaking . 
  i 'd been making lego stop-motion animations for youtube for years , and i 'd never expected anything to come of it . 
  it was just for fun , and to watch the views and subscriber counters tick up . 
  until one day ... 
  i 'd chosen on a whim to make a music video to a song i liked called ` megaphone ' . 
  [ here is that video . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6djxyr6b9g ) the story in the song is set at the santa barbara film festival , although i never put much thought into that . 
  it just so happened that ** the director of the festival found my film , contacted me , and asked if he could feature it at the festival . 
  ** come january 2011 , there i was : age 16 , on the red carpet at a californian film festival , signing autographs , doing interviews and smiling for the paparazzi . 
  my film was used as the trailer for the festival that year so everyone who went to see anything at the festival saw my film first . 
  to say it was a dream come true would be an understatement ... 
  the people of sb were the warmest , kindest i 've ever met . 
  every day i was stopped on the street at least once by someone who wanted to tell me how much they liked my work . 
  it was the best two weeks * ever * . 
  [ the poster is still on my wall . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/paakmpg.jpg ) off the back of the feature , i was found by the lego company who commissioned me to make a number of animations for them , and i was able to get into the best animation university course in the uk . 
  now i 'm 20 , and in two weeks , i 'm going to be back in santa barbara . 
  it 's just for a couple of days , but i am so psyched . 
  so i just wanted to say ... santa barbara , i love you , and i ca n't wait to see you again . 
  it 's been 24 hours , so the embargo has been listed . 
  post all the atots content you want without tagging it - and if you have n't seen the episode yet , quick !, 
  go watch it !, 
  did you just walk in from the front page ? 
  we 're / r/gravityfalls , and we 're dedicated to one of the best animated shows of the decade : ** gravity falls ** . 
  #what is gravity falls about ? 
  when twins dipper and mabel are left to spend the summer with their ( great-uncle ) grunkle stan in his tourist trap in the sleepy town of gravity falls , oregon , they begin stumbling upon mystery after mystery that points to gravity falls not quite being what it seems . 
  everyone 's got a secret , everything has something to hide , and there are codes and ciphers everywhere that only you , the viewer , can crack . 
  what starts as a seemingly innocuous tale about summer vacation quickly becomes one of the darkest , deepest stories ever seen in tv animation . 
  here at / r/gravityfalls we do n't just discuss and crack jokes about episodes of the show - we help each other to crack the codes , come up with theories and piece together the mystery together . 
  i 'd like to think we 're more than just your average tv show subreddit !, 
  #how can i watch ? 
  did i sell you on the show ? 
  awesome !, 
  you 'd better start watching before you hang around here too much or you might get something spoiled . 
  the show airs on disney xd , and it 's currently up to season 2 , episode 12 . 
  if you ca n't watch on dxd , [ this is our recommended site ] ( http://nvision.io/gravityfalls ) to watch it online . 
  i suggest checking the [ list of cryptograms ] ( http://gravityfalls.wikia.com/wiki/list%20of%20cryptograms ) as you go , to discover all the secrets you might have missed . 
  i hope you stick around , because we 'd love to have you . 
  remember : wkh xqlyhuvh lv d krorjudp !,
