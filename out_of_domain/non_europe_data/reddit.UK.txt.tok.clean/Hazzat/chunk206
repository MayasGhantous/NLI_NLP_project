  as always , you use them by putting the emote name in this format : ` [ ] ( #emotename ) ` . 
  those of you waiting for the results of the mod applications , i 've been through all 85 that were submitted and whittled it down to a shortlist . 
  i just need to review that shortlist to pick out who we actually want , so we 'll have those new mods soon enough . 
  i 'm 20 and i 'll be in tokyo for a week or two in september . 
  i 've visited before and done all the touristy things , so i was wondering how to find something a little more `` real '' . 
  i love a lot of contemporary japanese music ( electronic , rock , pop-rock especially ) and have been looking into gigs but i was wondering about places to go and other things to do . 
  i saw koenji and shimokitazawa were mentioned a few times , but no one listed anything specific . 
  [ ] ( #happymabel ) hi !, 
  you 've probably noticed a few changes around here lately !, 
  [ ] ( #mabelgoof ) a few weeks ago , we put out a call for moderator applications , i sorted through all 85 of them and am happy to announce that are new additions to the team are ** / u/migmigg ** , ** / u/yaypal ** , ** / u/sakuratsuji ** , ** / u/tuckyd ** and ** / u/catjaz63 ** . 
  i 'll let them introduce themselves in the comments if they want . 
  please let them know if you think they 're doing a good job - i certainly think they are . 
  [ ] ( #toomuch ) you 'll also spot in the sidebar that we have * so many * new emotes !, 
  in fact , there are 40 new ones !, 
  for this , you can thank / u/dani2632 for picking them from the show and making them emote-ready , and / u/migmigg for actually adding them all to the subreddit . 
  they must know some sort of secret i do n't , because when i was the one adding emote stuff it took me hours . 
  [ ] ( #usausa ) and tomorrow , we get a new episode !, 
  in case you 've forgotten what the drill is , we have a `` prediction thread '' posted at midday edt , `` reaction thread '' just before the episode starts and `` discussion thread '' posted shortly after the episode ends . 
  make sure you 're here to be the first to see all the new theories and stuff !, 
  [ ] ( #trytosmile ) that 's all the announcements for now . 
  unless i 'm mistaken , adding that extra slot should n't be possible until lv .20 . 
  referring to this post : https://reddit.com/r/globaloffensive/comments/3k3e7u/gaming_paradise_has_finally_been_cancelled_the/, 
  i just got the alpaca from the current score match event , and i 'm wondering how best to use it . 
  should i use it to boost my strongest smile card even further , or give a weaker one a boost ? 
  [ ] ( #happymabel ) hi guys , it 's been a while since we had a good chat about where / r/gravityfalls is right now , what 's working and what is n't . 
  the community is the most important thing here , so what you say matters !, 
  here are a few things that i personally think are issues right now . 
  these are just thoughts that i had , so please let me know if you think they are worth addressing , or if i 'm being too overbearing . 
  a meta post is any post that is about the / r/gravityfalls subreddit itself , rather than * gravity falls * the show ( like this one ! ) . 
  most of the time they 're pretty harmless , or even necessary , but after weirdmageddon aired and we started making tweaks to the subreddit to appease our new triangular lord and master , we got a * lot * of posts highlighting every little change as it was made . 
  while it 's nice to have our work recognised , i felt it went too far and too many of the posts on the front page were about the subreddit , rather than the show . 
  my feeling is that people visiting / r/gravityfalls do so to discover the latest in * gravity falls * happenings , and meta posts cheapen that experience . 
  no one wants to read us talking about ourselves . 
  i 'm not looking to outlaw meta posts entirely , but i think a better solution is necessary . 
  either a regular meta thread , a separate subreddit or something ... 
  i do n't know , you tell me . 
  ** please remember , if you want to give feedback on the way the subreddit is run ( compliments , complaints or just to discuss ) the best way to do that is to [ message the moderators ] ( https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2fgravityfalls ) directly . 
  it 's much more effective than making a new post . 
  ** i added this to our ` useful links ' in the sidebar to help more people find it . 
  i do n't know what happened in the last few days , but joaje posts spiked and everyone 's aim got a lot better . 
  i know as a mod team we 're a bit guilty for feeding the fire here , but references to this weird in-joke are getting totally out-of-hand and it must be alienating to new visitors . 
  ( for those who are out of the loop , see [ origin of joaje ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/gravityfalls/wiki/joaje ) . ), 
  it 's difficult to outright stop people posting it , but i am very tempted to set up automoderator to insta-remove any references to it for a week or so , just to force people to cut back . 
  it seems harsh , but this joke has been driven into the ground and we need to stop it before it hits bedrock . 
  your thoughts , please . 
  if you like joaje jokes , remember that / r/joaje is there for you . 
  we had someone write into modmail recently to say that they feel the current css style is a bit spoilery for new viewers . 
  i did n't think it was a problem , as anyone browsing the subreddit should be well aware of what they 're getting into thanks to [ this message ] ( http://i.imgur.com/qs7vipm.png ) , and i do n't want to cover everything up because then our regular users ( who take priority ) lose out , but i thought it was worth discussing . 
  you 're welcome to go crazy with meta discussion and discuss anything else subreddit-related in the comments . 
  we 'll be listening !, 
  as a result of [ our discussion ] ( https://redd.it/3sj2jz ) about the state of the subreddit ( which you 're still very welcome to participate in ) , we have decided to temporarily remove all references to `` joaje / her aim is getting better '' . 
  these jokes may have been funny to begin with , but they seriously got out of hand and we need some time to let the community remember what we 're actually here for . 
  if you 're out of the loop , [ here 's an explanation ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/gravityfalls/wiki/joaje ) . 
  / u/automoderator ( the helpful robot mod ) will now be automatically removing any references it finds . 
  it 's not perfect , but please do n't deliberately try to circumvent the filter , or else you may face a temporary ban from the subreddit . 
  please use the report button on any such cases you find . 
  this may seem harsh , but it 's for the good of the community . 
  thanks for your cooperation . 
  ^ ( and remember that / r/joaje is there if you need it . ), 
  it 's been long enough and you guys look like you could use a pick-me-up , so [ the subreddit 's ban on joaje ] ( https://redd.it/3soia3 ) has now been lifted . 
  please , do n't let it get out of control again . 
  i trust you . 
  you asked for it . 
  subreddit regulars will know this already , but those of you who are new should know that during today 's episode we 'll have a live reaction thread where you can go crazy with your fellow fans . 
  it will be followed later by a more serious discussion thread where you can thoroughly analyse what you just saw . 
  this will be the last big event for us as a subreddit , and i think there 's no better way to experience the episode than with this wonderful community . 
  so please , join us for our last hurrah !, 
  for those of you wondering how you can watch the episode without access to disney xd , you can go to [ the livestream ] ( http://themysteryofgravityfalls.com/stream/ ) . 
  ** edit : ** [ backup livestream ] ( http://gfwatch.ga/ ), 
  [ ] ( #mabelsquee ) this is the `` reaction thread '' , where can react to the episode as it happens . 
  shortly after the episode is over , it will be followed up by a more serious `` discussion thread '' where you can more seriously discuss what you just saw . 
  ** season 2 , episode 20 : ` weirdmageddon 3 : take back the falls ' **, 
  there are many previews on youtube !, 
  [ latest trailer ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snjp5w4zgby&feature=youtu.be ) / [ trailer ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dmqvyobzu&feature=youtu.be ) / [ `` fight back '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9zy_u3qegm&feature=youtu.be ) / [ teaser ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zximepagozo&feature=youtu.be ) / [ `` superfans '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwe_agwprik&feature=youtu.be ) / [ `` flag '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cegym58_-ze&feature=youtu.be ), 
  ** [ livestream ] ( http://themysteryofgravityfalls.com/stream/ ) ** / ** [ backup livestream ] ( http://gfwatch.ga/ ) **, 
  the episode airs on monday february 15 , 7pm est on disney xd . 
  as this is the last time we 'll do this , i just want to say * thank you thank you thank you * to everyone who has ever been part of the / r/gravityfalls community . 
  alex hirsch 's wild ride is one i 'll never forget , and it 's because of all you guys . 
  gravity falls is dead , stan is dead , joaje is dead . 
  long live joaje . 
  it 's been 24 hours since the episode aired , so it 's no longer necessary to tag content from it as a spoiler . 
  if you have n't seen the episode yet , quick !!, 
  go watch it !!, 
  since the show ended , we 've had a few requests for a chat where gf fans can hang out and talk about whatever . 
  so a discord has been set up where you can do just that !, 
  # [ join here !, 
  discord is a chat service that supports both text and voice chat . 
  subreddit rules apply - no nsfw stuff , ~ ~ no joaje ~ ~ . 
  thanks to / u/paulftw31 for taking the initiative !, 
  on an unrelated note , if you have n't signed up to be reminded about our summer re-watch of the show , [ you should totally do that ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/gravityfalls/comments/463fyo/as_you_probably_know_most_tv_show_subreddits_die/d031b9p ) . 
   hidden deep within the woods a buried treasure waits, 
   secrets lost and statues found beyond the rusty gates, 
  it 's gravity falls 's final mystery . 
  a statue of bill cipher lies on the forest floor , and a code suggests it 's out there to be found . 
  attempts to solve the puzzle have so far come up with nothing , but could it be because we do n't have all the pieces yet ? 
  where do you see this hunt going ? 
  where do you expect more clues to come from ? 
  what do you want to be found , should the location be discovered ? 
  let 's discuss , mystery hunters . 
  ** edit : ** just to clarify , i 'm not asking you to go hunting or propose locations - that 's pointless because we 've got nothing to go on .
