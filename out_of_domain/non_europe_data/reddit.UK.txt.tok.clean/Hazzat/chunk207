  i just want to know what you want the journey to be like , and what you expect to find at the end of it . 
  i know this place is quiet anyway , but i 'm having to disable posts because reddit is getting hammered by huge waves of spam and it 's filling up the modqueue here . 
  if you want to make a post , [ send me a message ] ( https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=hazzat ) and i 'll give you the permission . 
  edit : spam wave is over , we 're back to normal . 
  i 've made a list of related subreddits that you might also enjoy . 
  this is available [ on the subreddit wiki ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/gravityfalls/wiki/related ) , and it 's linked in the sidebar under ` useful links ' . 
  i hope you find something you like here .

  * ** / r/deathball ** - a pretty bodacious sport, 
  ## other shows,

  if you think there are any i missed that should be on the list , let me know !, 
  hi , i did the css style for this subreddit [ a long time ago ] ( https://redd.it/2ukvqa ) , but as it was looking pretty outdated i thought i 'd give it an update . 
  please let me know what you think !, 
  * ** total budget and country : **, 
  * ** do you prefer low weight , a 2 in 1 form factor , good battery life or best specifications to your requirements for the money ? 
  pick any that apply . 
  best specs , then battery life . 
  weight and 2-in-1 are n't important . 
  * ** which os do you require ? 
  windows , linux , mac . 
  windows . 
  * ** do you have a preferred screen size ? 
  if indifferent , put n/a . 
  ideally 15 '' , as that 's what my current laptop 's screen size is . 
  * ** are you doing any cad/video editing/photo editing/gaming ? 
  list which programs/games you desire to run . 
  if you have no requirements , put n/a . 
  i study 3d animation , so i 'm looking at maya , zbrush , premiere , photoshop , as well as stop-motion software that uses a live feed from a camera . 
  gaming support would be a plus , but this is primarily for 3d work . 
  * ** if you 're gaming ( leave blank if you put n/a above ... ) , do you have certain games you want to play ? 
  at what settings and fps do you want ? 
  minecraft , tf2 maybe ? 
  nothing crazy . 
  * ** any specific requirements such as good keyboard , reliable business grade build quality , touch-screen , finger-print reader , optical drive or good input devices ( keyboard/touchpad ) ? 
  an hdmi port for hooking up cameras , and at least one usb port for my graphics tablet . 
  * ** leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion . 
  my current laptop [ was declared obsolete ] ( http://www.macrumors.com/2016/03/08/apple-obsoletes-mid-2010-macbook-pros/ ) yesterday , so i think it 's time for an upgrade . 
  / r/radiohead is full of complaints about getting/not getting tickets . . ? 
  ... and so are we !, 
  that 's right , the / r/gravityfalls story has concluded . 
  some people were worried that this community would die and fade away after the show ended , and they were absolutely right . 
  to reflect this , we 're introducing the new rule :, 
  #all content must be completely unrelated to gravity falls . 
  there 's nothing left to say about gf , so i do n't expect this to come as much of a shock . 
  [ ] ( #wander ) anyone found posting * gravity falls * - related content on / r/gravityfalls will be permanently banned . 
  thank you for your time . 
  i 've been here before . 
  i know how this goes . 
  you ca n't make me click it . 
  * edit : * pants  shorts,

  you can watch it on [ crunchyroll ] ( http://www.crunchyroll.com/space-patrol-luluco/episode-4-into-the-sky-all-alone-703653 ) . 
  after our [ recent discussion ] ( https://redd.it/4ftzoy ) about the subreddit drowning under huge waves of fan art , we 've added a new rule/suggestion to [ the rules page ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/gravityfalls/about/rules/ ) :, 
   ** do n't post too much **, 
   to avoid new submissions getting lost under a large amount of new posts , we ask that you do n't post too much content at once . 
  if you have a lot of content to share , you 're better off curating the best of it , then spreading out your posts over time . 
   we recommend no more than 5 posts per 10 hours , but this is not strictly enforced . 
  why this is important is [ explained pretty well by / r/mylittlepony ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/mylittlepony/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_5.3a_no_more_than_5_submissions_in_10_hours ) , who had similar issues a while ago . 
  if you see anyone who you think is still breaking the limit , please click ` report ' on their post , and we 'll take a look . 
  * because i had to unsticky it to make this post , i want to remind you to [ send a letter to disney ] ( https://redd.it/46tsg2 ) if you have n't already !, 
  ** episode 5 ` what should i do ? 
  you can watch it on [ crunchyroll ] ( http://www.crunchyroll.com/space-patrol-luluco/episode-5-what-should-i-do-703655 ) .
