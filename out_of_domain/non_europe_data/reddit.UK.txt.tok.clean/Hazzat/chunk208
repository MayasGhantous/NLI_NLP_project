  *** fight for justice !!!, 
  got ta strip out all the tvs and weights benches , i guess, 
  christopher dresser ( 1834-1904 ) was a british designer who had an interest in oriental art , and visited japan on behalf of the south kensington museum in 1876-77 . 
  he travelled 2,000 miles in four months , and even met with the emperor who ordered that all doors in the country should be open to him . 
  he detailed his trip in a book : [ japan : its architecture , art and art manufactures ( pdf ) ] ( http://www.christopherdresser.co.uk/books/dresser_%20japan.pdf ), 
  what i found interesting , and i think other japan travellers will too , is how much of his writing sounds like the typical experience of a tourist today . 
  the awe of seeing fuji for the first time :, 
   * i have seen almost every alpine peak in the land of tell ;, 
  i have viewed monte rosa from zermat , aosta , and como ; i have gloried in the wild beauty of the jungfrau and the precipitous, 
  heights of the matterhorn ; but never before did i see a mountain so pure in its form , so imposing in its grandeur , so impressive in its beauty , as that at which we now gaze . 
  sightseeing :, 
   * strange articles of food , strange people , strange objects meet, 
  the eye on every side . 
  we stop , we look , we admire , we, 
  wonder . 
  we are looked at : smiles of amusement at the, 
  interest which is taken in things , to them common , meet us, 
  at every turn . 
  wrestling with chopsticks :, 
   * european plates are used out of compliment to us strangers , but chop-sticks are supplied instead of knives and forks . 
  we taste the dish after many unsuccessful attempts at getting the food to our mouths by the aid of the chop-sticks , but strange to say , the viands have the flavours , and the condiments are almost tasteless . 
  getting carried away in the shops :, 
   * i breakfast off fish , ham , eggs , and tea , as though i were sitting at my own table in london , instead of being 12,000 miles from home , and then set out to view the shops and their contents .
