  during my walk i find many curios, 
  that are to me quite irresistible , and i buy , i fear , in a truly, 
  reckless fashion . 
  at 5.15 i return home somewhat tired , having, 
  had a perfect '' field day '' amidst the shops . 
  the book is full of thousands of little moments like these , all of which felt strangely nostalgic to me . 
  maybe you 'll find something you recognise too . 
  i 'm really interested in going to this music festival , but i ca n't see anywhere on the website that says where you can buy tickets . 
  should i pick them up from a conbini ? 
  times are tough in animeme land . 
  pictures of calendars have revealed deep divisions in our community , as we tear ourselves apart over the topic of how relatable ** [ current date ] ** really is . 
  reports are at an all-time high as people with strong feelings [ ca n't help but show them ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/bestofreports/comments/4y4fz0/it_all_comes_tumbling_down/ ) . 
  as moderators , we 're really doing our best to keep standards pretty high and everything above board , but it 's not easy . 
  `` posts must be relatable '' can be pretty subjective , and there are a lot that skirt the line and are hard to justify removing . 
  there are certain things that perhaps go against the spirit of / r/anime _ irl -- edited subs , one-liners , tired reposts -- but they 're not so out-of-line that they need taking down , sowing the seeds of potential discontent . 
  however , * there is a solution !, 
  ** you ** , dear patron , hold great power !, 
  ** you ** can be the tastemaker of / r/anime _ irl 's tomorrow !, 
  ** you ** can hit up / r/anime _ irl/new * right now * and start flexing your voting powers !, 
  the best way to teach low-quality content a lesson is to ensure it never sees the light of day , and to let the good stuff rise to the loftiest heights !, 
  report things that break the rules , but if a post just sucks , smack it with a bold blue arrow . 
  remember the core tenets : ** it must be anime , and it must be relatable ** . 
  it must make you say ** `` hey , that 's anime_irl !, 
  '' ** by keeping this in mind and working together , we can create a more relatable subreddit for all . 
  actual rule changes are still up for discussion , but that 's for another time . 
  right now , show us how you can vote !, 
  !  * r/anime _ irl/new *  go !, 
  the . tabmenu along the top of / r/jetprogramme has been pushed 10px down when using res as of the recent big update , which looks very bad . 
  it 's fine without res . 
  the obvious solution is to move it 10px up , but then it looks good with res , but bad without it . 
  is there any way both can be satisfied ? 
  with a certain event having just taken place in the us , we 've seen an upswing in political posts and discussion here . 
  we just wanted to remind you about our rule 8 :, 
   ** 8 . no current political posts **, 
   they 're divisive , they cause arguments , they 're not what we 're about . 
  r/anime _ irl is a place to get away from all that . 
  express your anger , sadness or joy , sure , but do n't get political . 
  we 're all friends here , let 's stick together . 
  i enjoy making films and taking pictures , but i feel like i 'm leaving a lot of potential untapped by leaving all the colours as they are . 
  colour-correction seems like a deep subject , and i 'm not sure where to start . 
  i wrote in my personal statement that i would be open to running an english club if the opportunity arose . 
  it 's possible that this will come up in my interview , so i 'd like to know : what sort of information , activities and media do you bring to the club ? 
  how do you keep it fun and interesting every week ? 
  thank you . 
  after completing several vocabulary decks based on textbooks , i now want to transition to using a ` core vocabulary ' deck . 
  however , it contains lots of words i know and have flashcards for already . 
  is there a way to easily find and remove any cards in the new deck that feature words that already appear in my other decks ? 
  [ ] ( #grunkle ) hey , welcome to gravity falls !, 
  i 'm not sure how you even got here , as we 're way out in the middle of the woods , but as you 're here , why not look around the gift shop to find something that will make you want to part with your money ? 
  we love this show because it takes cartoons to a place they 've never been before , and truly has something to offer to all ages . 
  give it a try , i guarantee you 'll love it too !, 
  ( no refunds . ), 
  #where to watch, 
  when it comes to watching the show , you have different options depending on where in the world you are . 
  you might be able to find it on [ netflix ] ( https://www.netflix.com/title/80017382 ) or, 
  [ hulu ] ( http://www.hulu.com/gravity-falls ) , buy it on [ itunes ] ( https://itunes.apple.com/us/tv-season/gravity-falls-vol.-2/id560530869 ) or, 
  [ youtube ] ( https://www.youtube.com/channel/sww5st6juzya0 ) or watch bits on [ watch disney xd ] ( http://watchdisneyxd.go.com/gravity-falls ) . 
  if you 're a bit cash-strapped then ~ ~ get outta my mystery shack ~ ~ you could always head [ over here ] ( http://invera.tumblr.com/gf_episodes ) ... 
  but do n't tell the big mouse upstairs . 
  as a wise man once said : * `` when there 's no cops around , anything 's legal !, 
  #what order to watch, 
  just start at episode 1 and go straight through to the end . 
  no funny business . 
  there were a bunch of shorts released between season 1 and 2 , which do n't affect the story at all but are still pretty funny , so watch them whenever you feel like it . 
  so after a few episodes , you must be thinking `` wow , this show is pretty good !, 
  i wonder what will happen next ! '', 
  which is great , but chances are ** if you 're watching this like a normal tv show , you 're only getting half the story . 
  every episode is laced with hidden messages , cryptograms and secret codes . 
  sometimes they 're funny , sometimes they 're sinister , and sometimes they point to secrets yet to be revealed . 
  for this reason , i *** very strongly *** recommend checking the [ list of cryptograms ] ( http://gravityfalls.wikia.com/wiki/list_of_cryptograms ) after every episode you watch to discover the real mysteries of * gravity falls * . 
  there may be something going on that you did n't realise . 
  but do n't read ahead , or else you 'll spoil everything . 
  if you spot a cryptogram and want to try decoding it , or feel like making one of your own , you can use [ this handy tool ] ( http://themysteryofgravityfalls.com/ ) . 
  there are a good number of secret messages hidden around this very subreddit , if you look closely ... 
  #episode discussions, 
  so , if you 're reading this now , you were probably late to the * gravity falls * party . 
  the show ended so long ago , and it feels like there 's no one left to talk to about any given episode . 
  so why not make-believe ? 
  take a gander at the [ list of episode discussions ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/gravityfalls/wiki/threads ) to check out what everyone thought of each episode when it was brand new !, 
  discussions go all the way back to 2012 !, 
  woah !, 
  maybe they felt the same way you do . 
  when you 're all done , take a peek into the links in the sidebar for more stuff that can deepen your experience . 
  amas , chatrooms , a worldwide treasure hunt !, 
  but you 're approaching spoiler territory there , so definitely save it for later kiddo . 
  for anyone who wants to get deeper into the * gravity falls * lore , [ an official replica of journal 3 ] ( http://gravityfalls.wikia.com/wiki/gravity_falls:_journal_3 ) was released in 2016 . 
  it ties up all the loose ends and unsolved mysteries that the show left behind . 
  well , that 's all i got ta say . 
  before you leave , surely you must be interested in this legendary eyeball on a stick , or the mysterious three-footed mountain eagle ? 
  i 've got one in a snowglobe , makes a great keepsake . 
  well if you 're not gon na spend any money , at least tell your frie --, 
  [ ] ( #grunklemad `` kids these days , do n't appreciate a good mystery . '' ), 
  the official splatoon twitter page has been releasing a lot of information and screenshots over the past few hours . 
  here 's my translation for you . 
   this is an investigative report from the squid research lab . 
   this place is called ` haikara square ' . 
  ^ ( * ` haikara ' means super cool/trendy/fresh * ), 
   young squid gather here , and now it is the freshest spot around . 
   it 's two stops away from haikara city station , and it looks like new shops are opening one by one . 
   just like in our world , two years have past in the squid world , and the trends have shifted .
