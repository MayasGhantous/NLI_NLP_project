   \u2022 eli5 is not for literal five year olds . 
  it is for average redditors . 
  preschooler-friendly stories tend to be more confusing and patronizing, 
  i just want to say thanks for answering so many questions here . 
  i learned a lot about something i knew little of before !, 
  in the uk it 's cool original . 
  having been on youtube since 2006 , i can attest to the idea that youtube employees have no idea what they are doing when it comes to community involvement . 
  it 's a nice start , but i 'd say try to deviate from using the default textures as reference too much . 
  ( i 'm talking using the eyedropper on the defaults so what you draw is the same colour . ), 
  people will only want to use your pack if it looks different to what they 're used to , so be imaginative !, 
  if you 're looking to improve , maybe you can learn a thing or two from / r/pixelart . 
  the people there are phenomenally helpful . 
  no breathing in class ? 
  [ michael rosen knows the plight . 
  ] ( http://youtube.com/watch?v=z1cfvqyrq3q ), 
  what stood out to me was that the bright corners look a bit too bright . 
  you might want to town than down a little . 
  other than that , i think it looks great !, 
  [ this is her tumblr ] ( http://ninaserena.tumblr.com ) and [ this is her deviantart ] ( http://nina-serena.deviantart.com ) . 
  she did the header image here too . 
  [ hi-res version ] ( http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m9y223nhgo1qbc3se.gif ) and [ the source ] ( http://ninaserena.tumblr.com/post/31008414307/more-yogscast-fanart-please ) . 
  surely you can just look at the subscriber count on this subreddit ? 
  ( which is currently 57,483 . ), 
  it 's pretty safe to assume that the vast majority of people who are subscribed here would consider themselves to be bronies . 
  it 's impossible to survey every single one to find out for sure . 
  i like how all the yeah buttons are suffixed with different punctuation . 
  there 's `` yeah ... '' `` yeah !? '', 
  `` yeah ! '', 
  `` yeah \u2665 '' and probably some more i have yet to find ... 
  [ this was asked already , you can find the answers here . 
  / r/tlyr ( `` too long , you read '' ) is for just that purpose . 
  intellectually stimulated . 
  no it does not belong here , because it is not irl . 
  i 've been playing with some css designs if you 're interested . 
  what i 've got so far is at / r/hazzat _ 2 , but i do n't know if you 'll be needing it . 
  there 's still a lot of work to do on it !, 
  ( it 's a modified version of a design i sent to / r/sips , but i never heard back from them . 
  i 've never really understood how striped grass works in real life ... 
  thanks !, 
  the sips version is at / r/hazzat but it looks like / r/sips looks pretty swish already . 
  instead of moaning about it on reddit , you could go out and meet some new people . 
  it worked for me . 
  / r/admincraft is better for questions like this . 
  really ? 
  most people seem to like comic sans , it 's only snobs like us who moan about it all the time . 
  praise be to his ` splodiness !, 
  yeah , the eyes were a real pain to get right ... 
  i tried everything , from these plain circular eyes to proper anime eyes but none of them were quite there . 
  [ i personally think she looks best with no eyes ] ( http://i.imgur.com/38y0nxd.png ) , but if i did that everyone would be like `` hey man , why 's she got no eyes ? '', 
  i 'm flattered you think it should go in the top left of somewhere , but perhaps / r/megurineluka would be better ? 
  we need some more posts there though . 
  you should check out / r/mylittleminecraft !, 
  i was a-maize-d !, 
  i had no idea stylish could do that !, 
  i 've had it installed for a while because it was necessary for using silly reddit extensions , but this has opened a whole new world . 
  tell me something about ... japan !, 
  [ also on imgur ] ( http://imgur.com/a/vcl9c ) , but they 're harder to see because it 's black outlines on a black background . 
  as someone about to finish a four years of being taught theatre , i feel tempted to bring this in for us to perform as a last hurrah . 
  gumi is n't by crypton !, 
  i 'm having a lot of fun making these though ( even though each one takes 1-2 hours ) , so i * might * make a gumi just for you . 
  as much as i love nina-serena 's work and the consistency in yog-channel outros , i do miss this old style . 
  i ca n't help but feel that `` pork park '' would have been a snappier name . 
  think how odd it must have been for me drawing them !, 
  i figured i was going for accuracy in all the outfits , so it was pretty necessary ( especially for meiko ) . 
  the solution to cutting something out of your life is not to remove it , but to find something to replace it . 
  if you just convince/force yourself to stop surfing the internet , you 'll spend all your time daydreaming about surfing the internet . 
  but if you start the process by finding something new to do , you 'll find yourself drifting towards that and you wo n't even have to think about quitting the internet because you 'll be too busy with your new ( more productive ? ), 
  hobby . 
  nina is an animator , i know that much !, 
  something something horse meat . 
  really ? 
  for as long as i can remember , many shops that sell toys split the products into `` girls '' and `` boys '' . 
  [ hamleys only stopped doing it in 2011 . 
  ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/8952627/toy-signs-changed-after-hamleys-accused-of-sexism.html ), 
  i suspect there might be trolling here . 
  i do n't think anyone would outright say `` no i will not '' when shown where to get help , unless they just wanted to mess with people . 
  not bad !, 
  perhaps / r/pixelart might be able to help you improve , the people there are very helpful . 
  doing a reverse google image search will probably help you find the context of a lot of these . 
  in a different comment , ilovemyvistallite said :, 
   the top of the trees are 7ft tall , the figure measures about 4ft, 
  it 's not a giant . 
  yep , that 's exactly what it is . 
  [ ] ( / twidaw ) so cute !, 
  it was dinnerbone , and when he proposed it the response was overwhelmingly in favour . 
  it 's certainly possible that these pink leaves are a result of the half-finished seasons feature which has n't been implemented fully yet . 
  what is the project ? 
  dancing grass ? 
  in the sidebar of this subreddit there 's a nice link to the [ aesthetic building guide ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/minecraft/comments/qmndk/the_gigantic_guide_for_building/ ) . 
  get learning !, 
  nowadays , there is none . 
  however , in the 18th century it was thought that ryb were the primary colours - it was n't until the 19th century that it was realised that rgb was what was correct ( in mixing light , anyway ) . 
  today you might just be taught `` red , yellow and blue '' at a young age because those are friendlier words than `` cyan '' and `` magenta '' . 
  yes , and she 's aware of it . 
  she does still have a following on her youtube channel though , and she 's been using it to raise money for charity . 
  actually , i think scribblenauts unlimited if the first game in the series to have nyan cat in it . 
  i played the first two and , while they did have memes ( longcat , tacgnol , giant enemy crab , rickroll , ceiling cat to name a few ) , i do n't recall a nyan cat . 
  i 'd like to side with wb on this issue anyway because i love the scribblenauts series so much and do n't want to see it in trouble ... 
  miku 's * negi * is not a leek , it 's a spring onion . 
  so first it would sting , and then it would make you cry ^ with ^ happiness .
