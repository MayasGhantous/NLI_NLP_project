  i 'm pretty sure it 's done ironically for the most part . 
  even then , it 's just quoting memes , which is n't funny by any definition .

  this comic is very , very old and has been posted many , many times . 
  you can find out if something has been posted before using [karmadecay.com ] ( http://www.karmadecay.com ) . 
  you did n't do it here , just in future remember you should n't steal stuff and claim it 's yours , okay ? 
  that 's one way to really annoy people . 
  if you 're new on reddit and are looking to fit in , you first point of call should be reading [ reddiquette ] ( http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette ) !, 
  the way you decorate is going to look like a reflection of yourself , so if you want to make people think it 's the residence of a lady killer , you need to make it look like that !, 
  ... i 'm not really sure what that would look like though . 
  you can buy all sorts of stuff ( like stuff from vending machines ) by tapping your oyster equivalent on it . 
  eh ... maybe / r/3amjokes would be better .

  take charge and make it yourself !, 
  [ ] ( / pinkieshock ) ** holy crap **, 
  more like this please . 
  / r/minecraft needs more like this !, 
  / r/admincraft might be a better place for this . 
  why take pictures of your creation at night ?

  what is it that 's going so well for you ? 
  something something horse meat scandal . 
  / r/mylittleminecraft, 
  why are you still at school on a test day if you are doing no tests ? 
  neither of which are allowed in / r/minecraft , apparently . 
  no , not really , as you do n't have a senator or congressman to write to . 
  you could try to spread awareness amongst any american friends you have , but that 's about it . 
  oh no , not again . 
  [ we just had a post like this yesterday and the comments were a total mess . 
  if you 'd like to post blocky ponies with zero chance of starting a comment brawl , perhaps / r/mylittleminecraft is for you . 
  earlier dinnerbone tweeted `` do not look at this image '' with a secret message hidden in it . 
  work out the message and it leads you to this image , with a better view of the elmo/grum : http://i.imgur.com/i7kzdiw.png, 
  it 's grum , one of the minecraft developers . 
  his skin is elmo .

  i wish i 'd known about this earlier , i 've nearly unlocked them all now ... 
  he 's one of the minecraft developers . 
  it 's a shame he does n't get recognised more , but [ he never uses twitter ] ( https://twitter.com/_grum ) so most people do n't know much about him . 
  [ ] ( / flutterwhat `` this could go either way . 
  '' ) the joke here is that ggnome 's comment is filled with a ton of animated pony emotes which you ca n't see without a special browser plugin . 
  which is why they say animations are fun . 
  yeah , that 's actually what they did .
