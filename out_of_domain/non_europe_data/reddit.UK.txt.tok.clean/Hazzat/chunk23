  look at their comment history and you 'll see they 're clearly trolling . 
  wait , is this actually in the game or did you build it ? 
  [ ] ( / raritywut ) why is this marked as a spoiler ? 
  it 's because of rule 2 :, 
  keep submissions and comments sfw . 
  there 's no need for a proper nsfw tag here because nsfw stuff is n't allowed !, 
  i think this is pretty safe though . 
  as / u/yogscastsips has never shown anything even remotely resembling verification , i would think it unwise to assume they are the real sips . 
  `` the big ben '' ? 
  it 's just called big ben * ... 
  ^ * * ^ big ^ ben ^ is ^ technically ^ the ^ name ^ of ^ the ^ bell , ^ not ^ the ^ tower . 
  ^ the ^ tower ^ is ^ called ^ elizabeth ^ tower !, 
  hah , i was wrong !, 
  praise be !, 
  ( also i got sips to tweet something indirectly at me , bucket list complete ),

  what i love about this is that it 's so much more creative than most renders that get posted here . 
  i have nothing against renders of towns or buildings , but it 's really nice to see something original and refreshing like this . 
  right here : http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/version_history, 
   best and most detailed build in minecraft !, 
  well , i would n't quite go that far . 
  but it is very good . 
  aye laddie , we could all do with a donkey . 
  thank god !, 
  popularity = / = quality . 
  it also might be worth noting that most people on / r/minecraft [ really , really hate skydoesminecraft ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/minecraft/comments/1dde0h/does_anybody_else_get_annoyed_when_people_call/ ) . 
  it 's [ r3d.craft ] ( http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1182714-151-32x-64x-128x-256x-512x-r3dcraft-default-realism-75/ ) . 
  i have n't been on habbo in a long , long time ... but that sounds like a lot of fun . 
  [ ] ( / grannysmith `` pool 's closed ! '' ), 
  huh what a vocaloid concert in europe, 
  where do i found out more, 
  oops , how embarrassing !, 
  sounds a lot like [minecraftfurniture.net ] ( http://minecraftfurniture.net/ ) ( which has a server too ) . 
  [ ] ( / a14 ) / r/mylittleminecraft is that way !, 
  yep !,

  yep , part of their ai deliberately makes them annoying by having them compulsively sit on your chests and your bed . 
  maybe twilight was like `` i 'm a pony guys , i 'm really a pony '' and they put the ears on to make her feel better . 
  [ ] ( / ppshrug ) or to mock her , i dunno . 
  nope , to me it looks exactly like littlest pet shop . 
  * hoooollllyyyy craaaaap *, 
  i 've got ta go to this . 
  thanks for the info !, 
  i guess snips is jack black now . 
  custom skins ? 
  no , unfortunately . 
  walking and talking , however ? 
  [ citizens 2 !, 
  ] ( http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/citizens/ ), 
  given that it was posted on a tumblr called gametee , one might assume they will be releasing sips t-shirts . 
  [ purple and brown ? 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kif4huj5bv4 ), 
  it 's pretty , but a lot of this information is outdated and incorrect now ( for example , horse saddles are n't a thing anymore , horse armour is not craftable ) . 
  such are the perils of making an infographic on something still in development !, 
  not only that , the wiki can be edited really easily when new information comes to light so it can ^ \\ ( hopefully ) stay up to date . 
  unlike this image , which is full of incorrect info . 
  ... you finally found some grass !, 
  good work . 
  dance dan 's dance dungeon ? 
  as carpet is slightly shorter than snow layer , perhaps you could use that to make a more comfy-looking blanket . 
  [ ] ( / spitfire ) see guys ? 
  you 're all kicking up a fuss over nothing . 
  really ? 
  [ it looks a lot like littlest pet shop to me .

  also the thing on her top is a tennis ball , and it 's kind of implied that everyone in the image is wearing their cutie marks . 
  believe it or not , most gilded comments tend to have really low scores . 
  there 's a lot of gilding going on in smaller subreddits . 
  check [ the latest comments to receive reddit gold ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/all/comments/gilded ) for a whole bunch of examples . 
  [brohoof.com ] ( http://www.brohoof.com/ ) has already got a big , show-accurate ponyville which you might wan na check out . 
  ( world downloads are [ here ] ( http://www.brohoof.com/backups ) . ), 
  but you 're looking to build your own new one , right ? 
  for specific house designs , you can easily grab your own references from the show - just stop and take screenshots in any scene where a character is walking through town and pay close attention to the background buildings . 
  ponyville houses are tricky and can take a lot of practice to get right , so study them a lot . 
  and do n't build too big !, 
  they 're just little cottages , remember . 
  for town planning , [ here 's a view of the whole town ] ( http://images.wikia.com/fantendo/images/c/c5/ponyville.png ) and you can look up pictures of individual buildings on [ the mlp wiki ] ( http://mlp.wikia.com ) . 
  good luck !,
