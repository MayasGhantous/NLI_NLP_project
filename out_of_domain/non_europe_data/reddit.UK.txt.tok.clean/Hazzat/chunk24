  welp . 
  if this was totally original you 'd be right in your critiques , but this is a parody of [ this gif ] ( http://i.imgur.com/hiob6j8.gif ) ( which is taken from [ this video ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kio2_fdsdao&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=485s ) ) so i think some explosions might be a little out of place . 
  i think you 'd be better off in / r/redstone . 
  [ ] ( / ajfrown ) no , it 's not clear , it 's pink . 
  i bought the live album of this concert yesterday in the spur of the moment , and it is * so good * . 
  absolutely recommended . 
  why are they only reviewing the blu-ray now ? 
  was n't the concert two years ago ? 
  that does n't exist , but / r/bigdickproblems does . 
  the theme for your pack ca n't just be `` the same , but better '' . 
  you 'll end up with a mismatch of different styles in one pack . 
  think hard about what sort of pack you want to make , come up with a definitive idea and go with it . 
  do n't go in blind . 
  i have n't used [ mcedit ] ( http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/13807-mcedit-minecraft-world-editor-now-open-source/ ) much , but i 'm pretty sure it can do that . 
  [ worldedit ] ( http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/worldedit/ ) can definitely do it . 
  absolutely . 
  i went to tokyo on october and i was getting at least 20 streetpasses a day on average . 
  i discovered first-hand that the streetpass capital of the world is the pok\u00e9mon center shop , where i found myself getting about 20 a minute . 
  if you think you can handle any more , that 's the place to go . 
  just look at the quality of that cheese !, 
  that 's some high-class cheese . 
  i have no doubt the price is high , but i also have no doubt that the cheese is delicious . 
  infinitely relatable . 
  keep upholding justice and high standards , soldier !, 
  there is a time and place for everything fyrien ... but not now . 
  perhaps / r/mlptunes is the place to look ? 
  `` no memes '' is just so vague . 
  i do n't know how it 's ever meant to be enforced . 
  this particular image is n't really a meme , just an image macro , so it slides . 
  not quite . 
  your subscriptions do n't count at all until you subscribe/unsubscribe from at least one subreddit , so you can make a throwaway , post a comment with it and never touch it again without worrying about messing up the numbers . 
  it 's a different board game . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ludo_ ( board_game ), 
  i did a little research and yep , this was at :, 
   the special spirited away exhibition held at the ghibli museum , mitaka in october 2001 , in conjunction with the film 's release a month before . 
  [ more pictures here . 
  ] ( http://cdn.halcyonrealms.com/animation/exhibiting-animation-ghibli-art-book-review/ ), 
  for those who do n't know the context , [ today nintendo announced that they will be taking all the ad revenue from any let 's plays of nintendo games ] ( http://www.gonintendo.com/?mode=viewstory&amp;id=202693 ) . 
  this means you ca n't make money off playing nintendo games on youtube anymore . 
  i went in october and it was just amazing . 
  it 's more like an art gallery than anything , but of the most beautiful art i 've ever seen . 
  and no , there was not a big pile of spirited away manuscripts . 
  no doubt it will . 
  there was [ an interesting discussion ] ( http://redd.it/1efcck ) on / r/nintendo about it , and the general consensus was `` they should n't complain , it belongs to nintendo so they do n't have a right to make money from it . '', 
  and there 's a ton more like it in / r/animenocontext . 
  [ ] ( / raritywhy ) wait , you said earlier that fluttershy art is best art !, 
  which do i believe !? 
  ^ ( also `` rainbow dash '' is two separate words ), 
  [ lions and tigers and bears , oh my !, 
  ] ( / spoiler ), 
  while i agree it 's a good idea to foster a community who 's giving you free advertising , i ca n't really see a good argument for letting them make money off your stuff . 
  it sounds like a joke , but the next thing notch tweeted was that [ they actually nearly went through with it ] ( https://twitter.com/notch/status/335047039647883264 ) . 
  and who could blame them after they 'd been shown the figures ? 
  ^ ( edit : typo ), 
  the joke is that it 's a quote from a famous song from the movie * the wizard of oz * . 
  whether it 's funny or not is another matter ... 
  by not playing nintendo games !, 
  that may be so , but it 's certainly a staple of the american diet . 
  [ ] ( / ohcomeon ) you forgot to include the source !, 
  george takei 's catchphrase is `` oh my ! '', 
  i 'm not so wild about the font used for the background , but the rest of it looks really good !, 
  what 's with the item frames ? 
  they seem a little unnecessary . 
  aw c'mon , that 's just mean . 
  you should be asking / r/mlpdrawingschool !, 
  you have n't included a link , but i assume you 're talking about grum , one of the minecraft developers , who uses an elmo skin . 
  except in this case there is n't actually anything you can do . 
  going to the guy 's videos , even to dislike them , will only give him more views . 
  the best thing you can do is never talk about him and hope he goes away if he gets starved of enough attention . 
  i agree with him , although it 's much more relevant to indie developers . 
  if you 're an enormous multinational game developer like nintendo , you 'll place less importance on this sort of marketing as you 've got the budget for big marketing schemes . 
  and do n't forget , people will still be able to make nintendo let 's plays , it 's just that nintendo will take the money from them . 
  yep ( [ and i think this is the video you 're talking about ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oikhgagvrji ) ) , but the algorithm is kept very secret . 
  the perspective !, 
  [ ] ( / e27 ) * my brain !, 
  i think the idea is that pinkie opened a portal and the houses are visible through it . 
  it 's not clear though . 
  well , it 's the same art as [ the poster ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jfdcmiu.jpg ) . 
  i am leaping to defend eqg because , despite some people 's disbelief , i am genuinely un-ironically excited for this movie . 
  i think it 's gon na be great . 
  there 's several things wrong here . 
  yes , their post was blunt , rude and uncalled for . 
  but you know what you do in those situations ? 
  you just drop it , let them have their opinion and live and let live . 
  ( the one thing it is okay to respond with is a message saying '' [ it 's okay to not like things ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0la5dbtovni ) ... '' ), 
  after someone has insulted something you like , to go for a low blow and insult what they like is immature and * childish * . 
  you 're just as bad as them and no one is impressed by either of you . 
  the message you did leave is on par with a `` your mom '' joke . 
  the thing about insults is that you 're meant to feel insulted after receiving them . 
  it 's spelled `` weaboo '' . 
  be the bigger person . 
  no one 's impressed by you being rude back . 
  that way --  / r/mcservers, 
  if you 're looking for feedback , head to / r/mlpdrawingschool !, 
  you could try asking people nicely ... 
  that does n't even make sense !, 
  and why are you trying to post images like that ? 
  reddit comments do n't work like forums do !, 
  hey , it 's free alcohol for everyone if they win . 
  is it the catchiness of the song , or the thought of free alcohol ?
