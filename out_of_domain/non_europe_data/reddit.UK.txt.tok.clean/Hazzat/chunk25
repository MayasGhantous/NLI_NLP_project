  * swoon *, 
  `` we 're soarin ' , flyin ' ... '' ( georgia ), 
  that camera guy is never gon na live it down . 
  i would suspect / r/eurovision is full of eurovision fans ... 
  so yes . 
  voting the voting window lasts about 15 minutes , so you might be able to judge from that . 
  edit : 5 minutes left until it closes, 
  you ca n't make me, 
  i thought `` nah , i should n't . 
  i should vote for a deep , heartfelt song ... '', 
  * dials for greece *, 
  oh my gosh this song , this is the best thing i 've seen all night, 
  this is hilarious omg, 
  sweden this is perfect, 
  ** perfect **, 
  sweden is singing about themselves and it 's hilarious, 
  it was on purpose , all part of the comedy . 
  she 's a famous singer , and it was meant to make you think she was about to take over , but she got blown away by the big fan . 
  yes , i think tonight has shown us that scandinavian people of every gender are very attractive . 
  i 'm nervous for everyone, 
  i want that hair !, 
  the sweden voting guy 's !, 
  give away free alcohol , receive votes . 
  the italy guy was * very * attractive . 
  pardon me , i 'm getting a little carried away by the whole thing . 
  they always are !, 
  no i do n't know why . 
  good lord that norway man is handsome . 
  finland : the land of ding-dong ? 
  the points are appreciated spain , but for goodness ' sake put on some clothes . 
  alcohol is free, 
  \\ #beautifulgirl, 
  * smoooooth . 
  psst if you wan na write hashtags you have to put a backslash in front of it, 
  \\ #beautifulgirl, 
  he got censored on uk tv . 
  he got as far as `` hashtag '' before they cut out the audio . 
  the peppy young guy , previous winner i think , who 's reporting from the room with all the acts in called someone #milf . 
  i 've missed you !, 
  poor girl !, 
  she was so sad about messing up . 
  there 's only 12 countries to go , you can make it !, 
  and with that , denmark has it in the bag . 
  they must have it . 
  i do n't know for sure ( like i said , he was censored ) but i 'm pretty sure it was just `` hashtag milf '' . 
  the bbc has got ta be conservative about sensitive stuff like that . 
  you know what milf stands for , right ? 
  it said '' ( songs , not flags ! ) '', 
  a noble thought . 
  denmark wins !, 
  often in live broadcasts there 's a deliberate short delay to allow people in the broadcasting house to pull the plug on the audio if someone says something naughty . 
  so you 're saying ... alcohol is free ? 
  praise the greeks !, 
  the prophecy came true !, 
  [ here it is in better quality . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29tzaqjktxs ), 
  i thought this was absolutely hilarious . 
  it was clever , witty and left me with a big smile on my face at the end . 
  there 's a subreddit for it too . 
  it could do with a little more activity though . 
  / r/chaphop, 
  tsch , who plays video games for * fun * anymore ? 
  yep , this has been posted twice before :, 
  we forgive you though . 
  [ someone here is a phony ... ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/sips/comments/1ecbum/iama_ricardo_hall_former_employee_of_sipsco_games/ ), 
  that 's strange , it looked alright to me ... 
  i might have fixed it now , does it look any better ? 
  [ ] ( / b10 ) i think that means i got it right then ... 
  i 'll keep poking at it . 
  what browser are you using ? 
  it 's a cool theory , but the characters only had wings in the initial concept art . 
  in the official art and [ the trailer ] ( http://derpy.tv/my-little-pony/equestria-girls-trailer-in-720p-video_a6df1bf64.html ) , there are no wings or horns to be seen . 
  maybe at some point in the movie someone 's going to sprout them ? 
  i guess we 'll just have to wait and see . 
  [ ] ( / b31 ) i added it to the sidebar !, 
  sidebar says :, 
   equestria girl emotes will come when there are more pictures of equestria girls . 
  in the meantime , please enjoy these quadropeds !, 
  equestria girls vectors are still pretty thin on the ground . 
  we 'll just have to hold out a little longer !, 
  [ ] ( / b26 ) fine , i changed it . 
  the parade is unpooped-upon !, 
  due to the outcry i have toned down the use of georgia , although i 'm keeping it for headers and stuff * um , if that 's okay with you * . 
  i know the pink is a bit much , but it 's all based on the eqg poster !, 
  so i think it 's necessary for an eqg theme . 
  wow , thanks for these !, 
  if you could contact the artists i 'd be grateful , as it 's * veeeery * late here ... 
  if they say yes i will start adding humanmotes tomorrow !, 
  i do appreciate the feedback , this is only the third thing i 've ever made with css and i want to be ambitious !, 
  ( previous work includes / r/mylittleminecraft and / r/brogres . ), 
  [ ] ( / octyawn ) i 'll put all these changes into action when i 'm a bit less sleepy . 
  thank you for being constructive !, 
  [ ] ( / raritygirl ) for paragraphs of text , you 've got ta have something low-key and readable , my dear . 
  if she did , i wonder what colour she 'd be . 
  would she be stripy , or just grey ? 
  [ ] ( / flutterwink ) / r/mylittleminecraft would love stuff like this !, 
  [ ] ( / sbstare ) can confirm . 
  this * might * be better suited to / r/mlpmature . 
  or [ spike the dog ] ( http://imgur.com/d8fwk6u ) ?
