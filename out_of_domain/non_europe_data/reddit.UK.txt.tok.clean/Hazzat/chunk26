  oh , you meant the skins !, 
  they 're real !, 
  ( i thought you meant the poses . ), 
  the skins [ were made by idze ] ( http://www.brohoof.com/forums/topic/26393-idzes-hd-converter-closed-temporay-to-catch-up/ ) and they 're all there for you to use !, 
  and on mac it 's fn + f2 . 
  yes please !, 
  i do n't really have a preference for dimensions - after all , the emotes are only 70x70px - and png is lovely . 
  it also might be a good idea to recolour snips so he has his proper colours rather than the slightly darkened ones he has in that in that scene . 
  perhaps somewhere like / r/bestship would like this a bit more . 
  i do n't think you understand the stigma we have over here against talking like an american . 
  if you say a certain word in an american way , or start spelling stuff without a u , someone 's gon na call you out on it and you 're going to feel very bad . 
  and if you ever write `` mom '' , god help you . 
  [ ] ( / egstare ) sweet celestia that 's cute . 
  that 's not even grammar . 
  it 's spelling . 
  great work , thanks !, 
  i 've just finished putting them in now . 
  i think you 'll find [ the vast majority of / r/minecraft really does not like skydoesminecraft ] ( http://redd.it/1dde0h ) . 
  i think there 's something in this picture , but i ca n't tell . 
  if you want to keep fluff out of / r/minecraft , the best thing you can do is patrol / new / and nip anything dumb while it 's in the bud while upvoting good builds and stuff . 
  you can be pro-active !, 
  [ ] ( / a14 ) you may enjoy / r/mylittleminecraft !, 
  [ ] ( / re14 ) you may find / r/mylittleminecraft relevant to you !, 
  [ ] ( / eg12 ) i sense `` naked twilight '' is becoming a recurring theme in equestria girls comics . 
  [ how to set up a minecraft server . 
  ] ( http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/tutorials/setting_up_a_server ), 
  i suggest poking your head into / r/mylittleminecraft !, 
  you 're thinking of the double act that is / u/australian _ translate and / u/fixes _ your_comment . 
  ^ ( edit : deadb33f 's comment originally said they could n't remember these usernames , but they evidently remembered and edited that out . ), 
  hey , i was at the same one !, 
  i saw at least two sips & sjin cosplays ( which was more than the number of honeydew & xephos cosplays ) . 
  [ the shape the woman 's legs make , combined with the black areas on either side of her , looks like a creeper face .

  the guy just seems to be reading out the [ portal wikipedia page ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/portal_ ( video_game \\ ) ) for the most part . 
  in case you 're wondering , [ here 's a picture from the brony meet at the same convention on the same day ] ( http://i.imgur.com/hdh9gyd.jpg ) . 
  woah , where does this stuff get organised ? 
  i go to mcm every time and would love to go to a yogscast meet . 
  i think you need to learn to limit the number of materials you use . 
  the sidebar on the right of this subreddit has a complete list of all yogscast channels -- , 
  the yogscast site has [ a complete list of everyone who works for the yogscast ] ( http://www.yogscast.com/about/staff ) . 
  it 's funny , the day after mcm i always encounter a bunch of people all over reddit showing what they did there . 
  i was also at mcm . 
  i got a luka poster and a miku plushie !, 
  [ ] ( / sbstare ), 
  it 's a principle of design - things tend to look better if you limit your palette . 
  something with a hundred different types of blocks used is going to look a little harder on the eyes than one with , say , four . 
  you can see this idea in action in just about everything that 's been designed : web pages , art , posters , real-life architecture . 
  colour schemes are more clever than just throwing in whatever materials you like . 
  there 's a nice list of them in the lemon demon song * [ ode to crayola ] ( http://lemondemon.bandcamp.com/track/ode-to-crayola ) * . 
  this is n't really the place for it ... perhaps / r/mylittlesupportgroup ? 
  as someone who does n't play survival much , i 've never really understood this method . 
  why do you bring the ores up to the surface ? 
  why not just bring your fortune pickaxe down into the cave with you and mine the stuff then and there ? 
  it was an ios game which featured a giant cube made of * billions * of cubelets ( each one essentially a pixel of an image ) . 
  millions of people worked online together over many months to break through all the layers of cubelets , and only one person was able to discover the secret of what was in the centre . 
  it was up to them whether to share it or not . 
  [ here 's a gameplay video , with a nice explanation . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gieykqdoucq ), 
  good work , laddie . 
  shrek is love , shrek is life . 
  it 's funny - every time mcm comes around i always see loads of people on reddit the next few days talking about being there . 
  i ca n't believe you could n't find tomska 's booth , it was by far the most popular one there . 
  ( helped by the fact it was attached to omfgitsjackanddean , eddsworld and mr weebl 's booths . ), 
  something in me likes the idea that all these reddit bots look like the bots from robot wars . 
  eh , it 's the overground so it does n't really count . 
  no ... that 's a river . 
  you could do that already , could n't you ? 
  [ ] ( / a03 ) if you 're looking to get feedback and improve , head to / r/mlpdrawingschool . 
  this does n't look like a render to me . 
  i 'm pretty sure this was taken using [ sonic ether 's unbelievable shaders ] ( http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/940974 - ) . 
  why are they a funny colour ? 
  the idea is that this is an upgrade to the old way of doing multis , as they 're much more useful if you can flip between pre-made multis just by clicking a tab on your homepage . 
  as cool as it is , i 've been in the beta for a little while and i 've yet to find a really good use for this feature ... 
  you know about [ uk of equestria ] ( http://ukofequestria.co.uk/ ) , right ? 
  it 's the place to go to find bronies in the uk ( and of course they 're all going to buck ) . 
   1,000,000 million, 
  woah , slow down there buddy . 
  we 're not quite at that number yet . 
   and no , it will not be a horror flick . 
  [ ] ( / eg13 ) what could they possibly be implying ? 
  it 's another post about how everyone hates the skydoesminecraft fanbase . 
  i do n't watch skydoesminecraft , but from what i gather there 's a running joke about squid being evil and gold looking like butter ( `` budder '' ) . 
  i guess there was a tank for squids here and a skydoesminecraft fan thought it would be funny to destroy it . 
  ### holy moley, 
  i think i need to sit down for a bit . 
   reddit is full of hate now, 
  only * now * ? 
  the reason hate is so rampant is that if you make posts/comments reinforcing popular opinion , you 'll get upvotes for it . 
  it 's easy internet points . 
  [ ] ( / scootacheer ) you may wish to consider cross-posting to / r/equestriagirls !, 
  check the sidebar !, 
  under the heading `` emoticons '' . 
  [ ] ( / eg12 ) they 're ... um ... 
  i 'm sure the movie will be better . 
  pick the subreddit you want to do it in ( as / u/metsbnl said , / r/sips , / r/yogscast or * maybe * / r/iama ), 
  go to `` submit a new text post '' and give it a title introducing yourself ( `` i am sips ... '' ) and end the title with `` ama '' , which means `` ask me anything '', 
  answer all the questions you like until the sun comes up, 
  did you have to make a petition ? 
  i 'm sure you could just ask him , he 's a really nice guy . 
  he 's a very popular minecraft let 's - player with a very young fanbase .
