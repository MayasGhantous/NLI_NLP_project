  i 've stuck my head in to watch a video or two in the past and found him to be * very * boring , but that 's just my opinion . 
  the yogscast comment section is always a bit terrible , but you can find some really nice yognau ( gh ) ts if you know where to look ( e.g. 
  [ ] ( / thehorror ) i ca n't tell which line is her nose and which line is her mouth !, 
   sexy dragon, 
  um , if that 's what you 're into ... 
  it looks like they added a white shadow to all the text . 
  i wonder why , given that it does n't show up on the regular white background ... 
  ... i do n't think you realise just how many hundreds of times this has been posted to / r/minecraft . 
  heck , it 's even first on [ the list of things you should n't post ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/minecraft/wiki/rules ) :, 
   ### commonly posted and tired submissions, 
   submissions featuring often posted , old and uninteresting content are liable to be removed . 
   the following is deemed removable :, 
   * ** the launcher or title screen . 
  ** an image that demos the launcher or title screen , be it for purposes of pointing out the splash text ( ` woo , reddit ! ' ) , a server or servers being down , the authentication/login being down , or otherwise . 
  yeah , if you check the [ events part of the hatsune miku page ] ( https://www.facebook.com/pages/hatsune-miku/10150149727825637?id=10150149727825637&amp;sk=events ) they 've got a little list . 
  i 'm afraid i do n't know where else you can find info though , sorry . 
  where from !,

  i think it 's gon na be villagers . 
  i believe the famous * oof * was replaced to make the player more gender-neutral . 
  what 's the issue ? 
  are you looking to move the grass colours around , or do you want advice to do with town planning ? 
  it does n't - the bone cracking is only heard when taking fall damage . 
  other than that , you make a sound kinda like a creeper being hit . 
  [ ] ( / ra14 ) you may wish to consider cross-posting with / r/equestriagirls !, 
  eh , there are n't any official minecraft books out there . 
  the closest you 're gon na find is [ minecraft for dummies ] ( http://www.dummies.com/store/product/minecraft-for-dummies-portable-edition.productcd-1118537149.html ) . 
   mojang pretty much created the first , first person sandbox block world game, 
  hahaha , * [ noooo . 
  ] ( http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/infiniminer ) *, 
  they did refine it , however , and that 's why it took off . 
  it 's also * very * old ( from october 2011 ) , but thank you for linking to the image source rather than rehosting it on imgur . 
  on several occassions i 've noticed every single thing having one downvote on it , either in comment sections or posts on the / new / queue . 
  i 'm certain it 's not just reddit fuzzing . 
  hooray , someone did a good job of designing high school-aged humanised ponies !, 
  [ ] ( / b26 ) * unlike some people ... *, 
  [ ] ( / b20 ) ** oh my god this is so cute i ca n't handle it **, 
  it 's called a * negi * , and it 's a spring onion . 
  / u/redheaded _ robot did a good job of explaining its origins . 
  holy crap your username . 
  i just hurt myself laughing . 
  i 'm terribly sorry for your loss mr. maktoto , but life in sips city sounds like a lot of fun !, 
  do you have any advice for someone planning to move there soon ? 
  technically it 's a kettle , but / r/kettles does n't exist . 
  eh , not really . 
  it just looks half-finished . 
  i have seen it ... 
  but i ca n't for the life of me remember where . 
  but what does actual wool look like ? 
   a community for 6 years, 
  i guess it does exist . 
  nope !, 
  [ vocaloid wiki says ] ( http://vocaloid.wikia.com/wiki/hatsune_miku ) :, 
   after an internet meme involving [ hachune miku ] ( http://vocaloid.wikia.com/wiki/hachune_miku ) , miku was associated with a spring onion ( often mistaken for a leek due to the similar appearance ) . 
   please include the name of the * source anime * in your title . 
  [ ] ( / shock ) i thought that 's different to posting the actual source of the images !, 
  the images are from [ zap-apple . com ] ( http://www.zap-apple.com/ ) . 
  i agree it 's good practice and you should link to the artists where possible , but i think / u/perverse _ imp was just saying it 's not required by the rules . 
  we ca n't find that sound . 
   did you try to access a private sound , but were not logged in ? 
   maybe the sound has been removed . 
  this is [ an actual visual novel that 's in development ] ( http://www.zap-apple.com/ ) , and the plot does seem to be a little more closely related to visual novels than the show itself ( japanese high school , navigate through the year while making relationships etc. ), 
  i bought do n't starve because of sips , and i just ca n't help but read everything in the game in his voice . 
  he does a running commentary inside my head too . 
  i understand , and i was an annoying brony once too . 
  when you first discover the show with its subculture , toy feel like there 's certain things you have to do : watch every episode , buy merch , tell everyone about it and pester everyone you can into watching it . 
  i grew out of that in about a week , but there are still a lot of bronies ( especially younger ones ) who are embarrassingly vocal about a tv show they like . 
  having been following the fanbase for about two years , i hope you can take my word for it when i say that the bronies who are reasonable are very much in the majority - you just never hear it because they stay quiet most of the time . 
  wait wait wait what 's the problem here ? 
  [ ] ( / sbeww ) gross . 
  `` it 's * this summer * . 
  we 'll never get * this summer * back . 
  so let 's make it ours ! '', 
  [ ] ( / raritywut ) ... by staying inside and watching tv ? 
  [ the twilight saga ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/twilight_ ( series \\ ) ) , perhaps ? 
  i sent the [ facebook page ] ( http://www.facebook.com/vocaloidradio ) ( which really needs more likes ! ), 
  a message asking about it , and they linked me to [ this page ] ( http://5.39.66.196:2199/start/pqykhbye/ ) , which shows the last 5 songs played . 
  all the moderators on this subreddit ( besides me ) are the moderators of / r/mylittlepony . 
  they were added the day / u/lebal created the subreddit because lebal is an / r/mylittlepony mod . 
  they can all be trusted !, 
  this place sat very dormant and quiet until i did the new css and sent it to them saying `` hey , would you like this ? '', 
  they said yes , made me a mod so i could implement it , and i tried to attract as many people as possible to start posting !, 
  [ ] ( / eg02 `` and that 's how homosapia was made . '' ), 
  i tried , but i could n't get it to work ... ( that does n't mean there is n't a way though ! ), 
  i opened the . qtl file with itunes and nothing happened , so i guess it 's quicktime or nothing . 
  maybe if you contact the person/people who run the site , they might make an itunes version ... ? 
  i do n't think you 're in the right subreddit to be criticising people for using japanese words . 
  `` tsundere '' applies specifically to anime girls , so it makes sense to use it when talking about anime girls . 
  hey , you 're one of the people who 's working on the game !, 
  i 'm really excited for it , which is why i wanted to share it here . 
  i was n't expecting it to make the front page either , given reddit 's attitude to ponies most of the time . 
  it was n't a link , they just said `` blood orgies '' . 
  which is gross . 
  maybe she 'll make an appearance in the full game ... ? 
  the pool one is great , but the other two are n't very interesting . 
  you 're just staring at the ground ... 
  [ ] ( / b24 ) commander , i 'm detecting traces of sarcasm and/or contempt in this comment . 
  i do n't think the intention was to make a community here , lebal just likes squatting on subreddit names . 
  it was me who wanted to make it into something a bit more than just an `` oh , lebal ! '',
