  joke . 
  i do n't know what it is you 're doing preggit , [ but i must really not like it ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ncrpztg.png ) . 
  hah , i 'm afraid you 've got nothing on [ this horrifying project ] ( http://imgur.com/l8yaikt,bjkc1fl ) ( which has pony villagers ) . 
  awww . 
  you 're at -26 now . 
  does it make the game easier ? 
  or is it just different ? 
  my goodness . 
  this is * gorgeous * . 
  i like the state of / r/minecraft currently . 
  there 's a good stream of builds , news and details on the front page regularly , with only the occasional dumb post ( `` the most annoying thing in minecraft '' , `` the least used crafting recipe '' ) slipping through . 
  let 's plays being kept out is good because in all my time watching the / new / queue , i have never seen one that is n't boring/poorly made/500th episode in the series . 
  they 're often promoted in a spammy way and i do n't think they belong here . 
  tweets are good because they 're news and updates - the important bits of the many many tweets mojangsters make . 
  it 's nice to have a place that amalgamates them all . 
  heck , even the now-famous shot of human twilight screaming for the first time fills me with confidence . 
  there 's just something about it that 's so cartoony and full of character , it tells me this movie ca n't go wrong . 
  [ ] ( / rtwiscream `` the newer ones i added do n't invert !? '' ), 
  most of them have a reversed version , i just messed up on the latest few . 
  [ ] ( / eg25 ) this is a cartoon movie about a horse who transforms into a human . 
  the comedic possibilities are endless . 
  i do n't see how it could ever fail . 
  [ ] ( / eg12 '' ... i have a lot of emoticon work to do . '' ), 
  as / u/actingpower said , first they need to be added to betterponymotes , and they have n't been added yet . 
  [ i did make a request to the developer of bpm ] ( http://redd.it/1ep1hx ) , only to receive a cryptic response ... 
  if you 'd like the emotes to be included , i think you can ask them * very nicely * in that thread . 
  i have n't heard anything beyond his response there !, 
  / r/mcservers , buddy . 
  twilight pony is looking through the mirror , where she sees twilight human . 
  she asks herself `` is that how i look [ as a ] human ? '', 
  as much as i agree with the last person to comment there , they did put their point across in a kinda dumb way . 
  capital letters and exclamation marks !!!!!!!!!!!, 
  we have two active `` happy birthday notch '' posts already . 
   should i delete the world ? 
  or keep it as a trophy ? 
  why not just keep playing ? 
  it 's not like your world becomes invalid when you beat the dragon . 
  there 's still loads of stuff to do . 
  is that a no ? 
  while it may be fun to giggle at their simplicity , both these flags actually have a lot of history behind them . 
  the imperial family being linked to the sun is common in japanese legend , and the libyan green is related to gadaffi 's '' [ green book ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/political_philosophy_of_muammar_gaddafi ) '' , as well as it being the colour of islam . 
  the wikipedia pages for flags are often really interesting . 
  they have so so much historical background , and the construction of the shapes is really mathematical too . 
  * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_japan, 
  * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_libya, 
  while we 're on the topic of flags , [ the way you have to draw the flag of nepal is pretty fascinating ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2gne3uhkhs ) . 
  yes , it 's well-established that we all hate skydoesminecraft 's fanbase . 
  can we * please * stop posting about it now ? 
  [ ] ( / eg24 ) that is so damn cute . 
  you realise / u/whynotbarbershop does n't do exclusively community-related stuff , right ? 
  if you have a craving to be banned from a subreddit , stop by / r/youarenowbanned . 
  [ ] ( / waow ) ** aaaaaaaaaaa it 's so cute oh god **, 
  i would n't put the blame on sky himself . 
  it 's the fault of a very young fanbase whose members do n't know how to behave on the internet , and the fault of server owners who let this stuff happen . 
  it 's not hard to introduce a screening process to weed out most of the kids . 
  just awesome . 
  this is what creative mode minecraft is all about . 
  keep it up !, 
  you 're looking in all the wrong plaices . 
  i 'm the opposite - i want to forget as much about animal crossing as i can so i can rediscover it all for myself in a week or two . 
  it 's gon na be magical . 
  i was expecting a little more bon jovi , personally . 
  i 've been adding them gradually !, 
  there should be more to come in the future when there are more equestria girls vectors out there . 
  we have eqg emotes in / r/equestriagirls , but the creator of betterponymotes does n't want them in betterponymotes . 
  ( apparently they 're not ponies or something ? ), 
   i live in europe and altough i have plans of visiting japan in a few years , i doubt my dream of attending one of their concerts will ever come true . 
  it may not be so !, 
  crypton has said several times that they would like to take miku to more countries . 
  vocaloid 's international presence is slowly growing , with project diva arcade machines appearing in california and sega hinting at an international release of project diva f if the demand is high enough . 
  on top of that , there * are * vocaloid concerts coming up in europe - they 're just fan-run . 
  i know that sounds off-putting , but everything i 've seen suggests they 'll be just as high-quality as the official events , with the hologram and everything . 
  specifically i 'm referring to the upcoming [ miku uk ] ( http://miku-uk.com/ ) , which is also having [ preview events ] ( https://www.facebook.com/events/464620523612545/ ) so they can test out the stuff and gauge interest . 
  and do n't forget , the vocaloid opera [ the end ] ( http://theend-official.com/ ) is coming to paris in november !, 
  miku is the star , and there wo n't be a single human on stage . 
  it 's not as tough being a european vocaloid fan as you might think . 
  that was a really great description of why people love vocaloid so much . 
  it 's so much more than just the music !, 
  this is so soothing . 
  i just sat here staring at it for a few minutes because it 's just so calming to look at . 
  you 'll notice that in this case , none of the mob heads in the picture are actually in the game . 
  so their wish for the heads to be part of the game is valid . 
  i was wondering if it was related to the end at all , given that this the same miku model . 
  if this is what the whole opera is like , i ca n't wait to see it . 
  i love this !, 
  thank you so much for posting it . 
  they are , but you ca n't make your pony lie down on the ground like fluttershy is for example . 
  to get that , the person who made this would have had to take a picture of fluttershy sleeping in a bed , then cut her out and paste her in with all her friends .

  [ ] ( / ajderp `` dear princess celestia , i did n't learn anything ! '' ), 
  all that you really showed here was that the enchanted sword has silk touch . 
  you finished demonstrating that after the first 20 seconds , so the rest of the video felt like a bit of a waste of time . 
  these might be the first english reviews online , but i got my official nintendo magazine several days ago with an ac : nl review in it !, 
  ( it got 95 % .
