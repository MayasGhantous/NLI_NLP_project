  i ca n't wait for this game . ), 
  if you 're looking for servers , poke your head into / r/mcservers . 
  thank you for helping to promote our little subreddit . 
  this is great !, 
  thank you for posting it . 
  if you post more in future ( which i hope you do !, 
  ) , remember to put [ oc ] in the title so everyone knows it 's something you made . 
  when i first played the black rock shooter level , i found i was really really good at it . 
  i was getting a much higher score than i would usually . 
  i think it 's because supercell 's * supercell * album was the first vocaloid music i ever heard ( and bought ) so i know all the songs on it very well . 
  it helps if you know the songs !, 
  congrats on your first perfect !, 
  lucky !, 
  when i found ponies on a long haul flight , they only had applebuck season . 
  [ ] ( / ajhappy ) and lem me tell ya , i watched the heck out of it . 
  many times . 
  i 've worked yogscast videos into my daily routine . 
  i 'll the brand new videos while i 'm brushing my teeth and getting ready for bed , and any ones i missed while i 'm having breakfast the next morning . 
  if there 's still more , i can save them for a rainy day when i 've got 20 minutes to spare and not much to do in that time . 
  ### ... the greatest dj equestria has ever seen !, 
  what a tune !, 
  i love saskure.uk 's work . 
  a disc is just another way of transporting digital files ... 
   kudos to whomever/whatever mod did this . 
  \\* blushes *, 
  i 'm glad you like it !, 
  i 've added this to the sidebar !, 
  you can do it using a 3d modelling software like blender , but the most popular way of doing it lately is by using a program called [ chunky ] ( http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/63913-chunky-minecraft-mapping-and-rendering-tool/ ) . 
  there 's a subreddit for it too : / r/chunky . 
  head to / r/mcservers . 
  these are really great !, 
  especially odd embrace , it 's just gorgeous . 
  we had the project 1845 map loaded on our server for a day . 
  it was quite the sight to explore , there 's a lot of detail . 
  for anyone who wants to do the same , it 's the biggest minecraft project ever undertaken . 
  you can more info and a download of it so far [ here ] ( http://www.planetminecraft.com/project/project-1845/ ) . 
  just so you know , i fixed ` [ ] ( / ohdeartwi ) ` so she reverses !, 
  i think you 're looking for / r/admincraft . 
  i do n't think a mushroom growing in a forest is a very good example of `` life finds a way '' . 
  [ ] ( / eg21 ) i 'll see what i can do . 
  first rule !, 
   * all content must be ** sfw ** . 
  yes , we know . 
  the terrain generator has some quirks in it like this . 
  we 've all seen it . 
  you did n't have to post it a second time . 
  [ ] ( / eg12 ) ... sunset shimmer is a vampire ? 
  nope , it 's out on june 14th in the uk . 
  ( the wait is killing me too . ), 
  [ here 's a countdown . 
  ] ( http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=time+until+june+14 ), 
  for someone who plays a creative server , this design seems very appealing . 
   north american debut, 
  do n't forget about europe too !, 
  at least north america has had a concert ... 
  this is super exciting . 
  not only is it so cool that vocaloid is finally getting an official release of * anything * outside of the far east , but this could be the first step towards even more global releases of vocaloid stuff . 
  as a project diva f owner , the only question is ... do i buy the new one ? 
  * edit : * just so people know , [ here 's sega 's actual statement ] ( http://blogs.sega.com/2013/06/06/announcing-hatsune-miku-project-diva-f-for-western-release/ ) , which talks a bit more about the europe release . 
   it would be nice to finally be able to get the dlc for it, 
  and also to actually read all the menus . 
  the main reason i 'd want to purchase this would be to show support for the game . 
  they 'll only continue releasing games ( and maybe other things ) overseas if they see the market is there . 
  wow , this is the closest i 've ever seen a let 's play to getting off the / new / queue . 
  it looks like it 's not to be , however . 
  ** my opinion : **, 
  i can tell you 're doing your best to be funny with the `` announcer '' voice and very frank way of talking about everything , but it just falls a bit flat . 
  it comes across as if you 're trying a bit hard , and any sort of wit or spontaneity is lost to this half-developed character you 've given yourself . 
  if you 're playing as yourself , play as yourself . 
  do n't put on a silly voice and do n't try to be funny if you 're not funny . 
  if you 're playing as a character , develop it and go all out with that . 
  the fact is that most people just are n't let 's player material , and even those that are will find it very hard to get anywhere because youtube is already incredibly oversaturated with minecraft let 's plays . 
  the golden rule is * if you want people to watch , give them something to watch * . 
  people do n't want to see a guy doing a dodgy impression running around the spawn of a random server . 
  they want to see something hilarious/creative/interesting . 
  show us all something we have n't seen before , because we all want to see it . 
  it 's like they 're not even * trying * hide his stereotype !, 
  in addition to the touch control / u/rm-l mentioned , the ps3 version also lacks [ the augmented reality feature ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7uz-hiugyo ) which lets your chosen vocaloid perform for you on your kitchen table . 
  it 's not a great loss though , as it 's replaced by a feature that has them perform a concert for you on the tv instead . 
  the article focuses on north america , but [ sega 's actual statement ] ( http://blogs.sega.com/2013/06/06/announcing-hatsune-miku-project-diva-f-for-western-release/ ) says :, 
   the game will arrive this august on both playstation 3 and playstation network in north america , and in europe on playstation network !, 
  so you can only buy the physical copy in the states/canada , but you can still get the download version in europe . 
  the moon landings are often seen to be the peak of humankind 's achievement . 
  i do n't really think visibility would help much . 
  the target market for this game will be existing vocaloid fans . 
  i 'm in the uk and i imagine that even if sega made a retail copy and went all-out with marketing it , it 's still only appeal to a very small niche . 
  vocaloid is so radical and unheard of that most people would be very sceptical . 
  `` a game about a popstar i 've never heard of ? 
  she 's not even real ? 
  all the songs ^ * are in japanese ? 
  * rhythm-action !? 
  ^ ( * except for one ), 
  download-only seems like a wise move to me . 
  i guess it 's the closest thing we have to a wok . 
  it 's not your typical old-fashioned opera , it 's an opera of * the futuuuuure !, 
  * it 's got a really cool style to it ( and , y' know , it has a vocaloid doing all the singing ) . 
  [ the show 's official site ] ( http://www.theend-official.com ) can give you a bit more info on it . 
  it 's already shown in japan , which is why all the dates and tickets listed are about performances over there . 
  because it 's already played in japan there are some reviews out there already , including [ this one ] ( http://virtual-emotions.net/2013/opera-the-end-review/ ) by / r/vocaloid frequenter / u/loserbait . 
  i have n't read it because i want to dodge spoilers , but maybe it 'll be interesting to you .
