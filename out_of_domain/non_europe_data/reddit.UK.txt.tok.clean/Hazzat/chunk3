  i feel horrible . 
  i 've used it once to clear a hill away when i needed some flat land to build on . 
  that 's about it though . 
  pfft , enchantments ? 
  this was back in 1.7 i say !, 
  i guess you could say it all went okay ... 
  * sunglasses *, 
  in the end . 
  * yeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhh *, 
  applebloom reminds me an awful lot of tiny tim . 
  electrocuted means you died from an electric shock . 
  it 's similar to the word executed , see ? 
  so now you know !, 
  unless you did actually die , in which case i 'm sorry . 
  electric shock, 
  a sudden discharge of electricity through a part of the body . 
  i do n't think there 's any word/phrase with a more relevant definition than that . 
  big pants . 
  [ all this time i thought i was a twilight .

  to me , that message meant `` stop wasting your time playing a video game and actually go outside or something '' . 
  why are you asking when you can just try it out yourself ? 
  it works fine for me , but i do n't have nearly as many mods . 
  no screenshots , no deal !, 
  come on jeb , bring us the glsl shaders !, 
  * ( joking ) *, 
  * ( but that would be cool though ) *, 
  the minecart is sitting on a detector rail , which powers the surrounding lamps . 
  a standard lego brick is a little too tall to be a cube , but if you take two plates ( the flatter pieces ) and stack one on the other then you have roughly a cube . 
  that 's no cube , that 's the height of a regular brick !, 
  i do n't think a 2x2 cube is quite possible , the height you need is between 4 and 5 plates . 
  probably , after it comes out . 
  [ bricklink ] ( http://www.bricklink.com ) is a great place for that sort of thing . 
  i gave that a try to see how it looked ... 
  why certainly , the website ( and ip address ) is [brohoof.com ] ( http://www.brohoof.com/ ) . 
  nope , multiplayer . 
  this has been a project that 's lasted several months on [brohoof.com ] ( http://www.brohoof.com ) . 
  you can visit it yourself at [brohoof.com ] ( http://www.brohoof.com ) . 
  when you get there , type '' / warp canterlot '' . 
  it 's the same one , the one that yogscast used was the wip version of the one displayed here . 
  i 'm intrigued , why is it `` not okay '' ? 
  i can see why bronyism would be considered deviant , but i ca n't see any reason why it would be outright wrong . 
  this is your chance to convince a brony to change his ways . 
  i 've got a gallery of pictures taken of canterlot ( and the rest of the server ) with the glsl shaders :, 
  also , the texture pack is called love and tolerance . 
  it 's pony-themed and you can get it here :, 
  you can also get to any fallout version of a city by adding f - to the start of the name , e.g. 
  / warp f-manehattan, 
  / warp f-filly, 
  and so on . 
  i can assure you this took months , work began on august 1st . 
  placing blocks is n't hard , but trying to work out the exact layout of the deliberately complex and convoluted canterlot is one tough challenge . 
  as one of the brohoof admins , we certainly appreciate your praise !, 
  the best reference i can recommend : the show itself . 
  do n't go looking up stuff people have already built , interpret the source material and make it your own . 
  it 's more fun that way !, 
  next stop , mob city !, 
  well , you had a bad experience with one new member who said that your computer was a potato , and used that as an excuse to try and smear our name across the internet . 
  if it was an admin who 'd tried to ridicule you then sure , you 'd be right to be angry , but it was someone who 'd been on the server barely a day . 
  your long-buried kneejerk reaction has no business here . 
  eeyup : http://www.brohoof.com/backups, 
  the one you want is in worlds  canterlot . 
  we have the nsfw tag for things like this . 
  you sir , are missing a [ very important mod ] ( http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/748553-11-mine-little-pony-v11/ ) . 
  it 's funnier if you make `` gf '' stand for `` george foreman '' . 
  [ ] ( / flutterwink ) there 's no shame in plugging something you 've worked hard on . 
  and while we 're thinking in that vein , i have a pony-themed texture pack !, 
  it 's the most popular pony server , with a full-scale replica of equestria ( which is still under construction in some places ) . 
  totally worth joining . 
  here 's your answer :, 
  `` in creative mode '' makes me think there 's no way to craft it . 
  i had a go at poking around with different crafting recipes and that seems to be the case . 
  is it a new thing that pressing different numbers with f3 open shows you different pie charts ? 
  i just discovered this accidentally . 
  ah , thank you . 
  i guess i 'm just slow . 
  there 's a subreddit for pony minecrafting which i think needs a bit more attention : / r/mylittleminecraft, 
  also , shameless plug for my pony-themed texture pack :, 
  that 's been there since enchanting tables were introduced , and i still have n't worked out what it is . 
  there 's a safe haven for pony minecraft stuff on / r/mylittleminecraft, 
  i still ca n't work out why mlp has sparked such a controversy . 
  but this is not the place to be discussing that . 
  i 'm assuming the aliens took your f2 key ... 
  replacer is such an underrated artist . 
  by celestia 's buttocks , you 're right . 
  certainly miss rarity !, 
  sorry ... what 's new here ? 
  gee wizz , you 're hilarious . 
  step 1 : go through portal . 
  step 2 : right click ground with villager spawner egg . 
  step 3 : ??? 
  step 4 : profit !, 
  as soon as this appeared , i uncontrollably started swaying along with pinkie . 
  i guess we must be able to relate . 
  if you 're interested in getting pony-related art critique , there 's [ / r/mlpdrawingschool ] ( / r/mlpdrawingschool ) !, 
  i ca n't tell if that 's horrifying or not ... 
  i 've seen responses to this before . 
  the most compelling one pointed out that those stats are lies : church attendance is going up and clubs are struggling in the recession . 
  half-way through writing this comment i went to see if i could find said response , and what do you know :, 
  [ i found it ] ( http://cheezfailbooking.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/funny-facebook-fails-thats-probably-why.jpg ) .
