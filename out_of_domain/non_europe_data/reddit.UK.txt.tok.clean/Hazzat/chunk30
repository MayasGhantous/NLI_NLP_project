  it 's okay !, 
  i tagged it as a spoiler now . 
  according to eqd :, 
   these were released by screenvision programs on flickr . 
  i ca n't actually find the source though . 
  i used it for about a week before i realised i was subconsciously adopting the pony vocabulary . 
  the day i said `` everypo - er , every * body * '' was the day i had to switch it off . 
  we can all sit around twiddling our thumbs and dreaming of bug-catching together . 
  it 's just occurred to me that i 'm probably going to have to unsubscribe from here for the first week to avoid all the spoilers . 
  ( i consider any information at all about the game to be a spoiler . ), 
  really ? 
  did it work ? 
  do you actually have a copy of new leaf in your vicinity ? 
  a while ago one of the writers for the official nintendo magazine ( uk ) got really excited because he got to streetpass miyamoto . 
  they described it as `` the mother of all streetpasses '' . 
  that was utterly shrektacular . 
  this one 's blocked , too !, 
  :( thank you for trying though . 
  [ ] ( / a14 ) please consider cross-posting to / r/equestriagirls !, 
  nope , this is project diva f ( the ps3 version ) only . 
  [ ] ( / ajhappy ) / r/equestriagirls would very much appreciate a crosspost !, 
  \\* continues twiddling thumbs , as if playing an imaginary 3ds *, 
  i had a falling-out with helvetica and switched the default font here to lucida grande . 
  i hope that 's better !, 
  i finally fixed it !, 
  the problem was that i was using res , which changes the colour of that link . 
  it sat around for a couple of months not doing anything ( the name was squatted before equestria girls was even announced ) , but i helped to reboot it with a pretty new theme about two weeks ago . 
  i 'm thinking of adding a warning at the top of the page here telling people to read comments at their own risk ... you just ca n't dodge these spoilers !, 
  wow , i have n't watched anything by bronydanceparty in a while and i 've got ta say he 's come a long way . 
  i remember him being infamous for his very wooden , soulless animation and , while this is n't perfect , it 's a lot prettier . 
  i did it !, 
  hopefully it 'll save a soul or two . 
  [ spoiler alert : it does not contain dancing .

  [ ] ( / manspike ) no problem . 
  the new myspace design is primarily sideways like this . 
  it feels like something you might implement if you want to make your site feel totally new and futuristic . 
  no it does n't . 
  the block beneath the snow is dirt , not grass . 
  the effect on the side of the block only shows up on grass blocks . 
  milestones everywhere !, 
  i ca n't keep up with them all . 
  the best part is that [ ] ( / s ` the subscription link at the very end goes to rythian 's channel ' ) . 
  you could allow people to include text in it with for the scottie 's name ? 
  i 'm hoping to see a lot of tartan here . 
  i 'm not crying i 'm not crying i 'm not crying ^ ( * i am actually crying * ), 
  i do n't know what it is about ghibli music , but it never fails to move me to tears . 
  a brilliant performance from your students . 
  yeah !, 
  i 'm thinking something along the lines of what they have in / r/animalcrossing , where you can have a flair with a little picture and ( in this case ) a friend code attached to it . 
  from the overbridge at clapham junction , you get a fantastic view of the london skyline . 
  in the morning there is often a line of commuters standing looking out of the windows at it . 
  it 's very pretty around the sunrise . 
  or perhaps the skyline 's a bit too touristy ? 
  who knows , maybe the commuters themselves would make interesting subjects . 
  i 've only really passed through during rush hour in the morning ( ~ 8am ) , and it 's fairly busy then . 
  the overbridge is n't all that crowded , there 's just a constant stream of people in both directions making their way to various platforms . 
  the earlier the better , really - it just depends on how early you 're prepared to get up !, 
  i spent so long doing up the css to make it look pretty . 
  cool !, 
  it looks great . 
  their concerts are so regular !, 
  it 's great always being able to know exactly when and where you can find a bon jovi concert . 
  / r/brogres may be of interest to you, 
  ^ ( uh oh i just commented in mlas1 , i feel like that was a bad idea ), 
  as a server owner , you probably do n't want to let your players explore forever in all directions , because as they generate new chunks the map 's file size can get * very * big . 
  a way to prevent this is to implement a world border , which stops people in their tracks and kicks them back a few blocks if they try to go past it . 
  most servers i 've seen tell you `` you have reached the edge of this world '' when you reach the border , but it seems whoever set this border up wanted to be a little more creative . 
  when playing multiplayer in nintendo land , you can have your face show up on the screen for all the wiimote-users to see . 
  although the quality of the camera is less than flattering to your appearance . 
  [ ] ( / dod `` horse apples . '' ), 
  agghhhh ok ok fine i got some flair, 
  this place is really scary, 
  if you 're looking for servers , you wo n't find them here - server advertising is n't allowed on / r/minecraft . 
  head to / r/mcservers , you 'll find a lot there . 
  heavily modded servers with tons of plugins are really disorienting at first , i remember being like that . 
  i know your pain !, 
  [ ] ( / 4l ) \\* hyperventilation *, 
  ### i never meant for this to happen, 
  i was just gonne leave a comment and get outta here, 
  but you got me on the way out and tied me down, 
  it was inevitable , i guess . 
  all roads lead to / r/mylittleandysonic1 .

  [ ] ( / eg16 ) i think this is pretty well established by now !, 
  this has been the case since survival multiplayer was introduced in august 2010 . 
  so it 's not exactly new information . 
  project diva f being released in europe may be the first step towards more official vocaloid things happening out here ... we may have a while to wait , but it could still happen one day !, 
  it 's not an official event , but [ miku uk ] ( http://miku-uk.com ) is a concert coming up later this year . 
  perhaps that interests you ? 
  here , i 'll help you with that link !, 
  to put a link inside text , you put the text in [ ] brackets , followed by the link in ( ) parentheses .
