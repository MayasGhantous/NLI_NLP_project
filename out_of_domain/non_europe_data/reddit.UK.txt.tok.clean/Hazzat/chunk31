  easy !, 
  did you use a real game boy at all in making this ? 
  wow !, 
  the block-replacing trick has become all the rage nowadays , huh ? 
  with a title like that , i thought i was on / r/forwardsfromgrandma . 
  i see your hidden message there . 
  why is it that no reporters can pronounce `` hatsune miku '' ? 
  it 's not that hard !, 
  i do n't know what that [ mysterious display for a mysterious game ] ( http://randomnintendo.com/wp-content/gallery/extra-capturing-the-e3-2013-invasion/17.jpg ) is all about , but i really want to know more . 
  / r/casualiama needs you !, 
  ign has posted [ the e3 schedule in uk time ] ( http://uk.ign.com/wikis/e3/e3_2013_press_conferences_uk_times ) , so you can use that . 
  i doubt it . 
  as a server owner it 's very easy to fake join/leave messages using the / broadcast command . 
  / r/minecraftcirclejerk is that-a-way !, 
  [ here is the now-famous video of it in action ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox5dwsvdxyk ) , and [ this is how it 's done ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfbs_ql53cu ) . 
  warning : it gets pretty complex . 
  how is he a scumbag ? 
  absolutely not . 
  so far i 've found it all fairly underwhelming , with focus on simulation rather than actual enjoyable gameplay . 
  it 's nice to see something bright . 
  microsoft , sony , ea and ubisoft are the only press conferences this year . 
  i do n't think so , the snowy roofs put me off that idea . 
  if anything , it reminds me of okami . 
  how did this story start ? 
  ### dear princess microsoft, 
  more games, 
  less simulations, 
  please, 
  your faithful student, 
  i listened to the whole thing !, 
  although there were some bits that did n't quite work ( i felt just be friends did n't quite fit ) i really enjoyed it . 
  great work !, 
  psst , / r/equestriagirls likes equestria girls discussions . 
  yeah ... 
  it 's actually been posted no less than three ( [ 1 ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/equestriagirls/comments/1fvkb1/new_equestria_girls_trailer/ ) , [ 2 ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/equestriagirls/comments/1fvpvi/second_equestria_girls_trailer_hd_youtube/ ) , [ 3 ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/equestriagirls/comments/1fvlfg/new_trailer_from_equestria_girls_it_looks_so_good/ ) ) times already . 
  thank you for wanting to share though !, 
  absolutely . 
  this is one of the finest pieces of brogre media ever experienced . 
  dude , did you just flood the / r/minecraft new queue with a ton of random screenshots ? 
  that 's not cool . 
  a great-looking plugin , but when showcasing it please try not to fidget to much !, 
  i found watching you constantly absentmindedly scrolling back and forth through your hotbar to be really distracting . 
  * knocking at the door *, 
  `` hello , have you accepted wii u as your lord and saviour ? '', 
  they 'll have the hologram !, 
  they 're also having a preview event in newcastle on august 31 to give them a chance to test out all the equipment , you can find details on that in [ the facebook event ] ( https://www.facebook.com/events/464620523612545/ ) . 
  there may be more of those in the future too . 
  you are being trolled . 
  is n't that obvious ? 
  why not make a multi to combine the two ? 
  / r/conservative + forwardsfromgrandma, 
  luka 's character item is a tuna , because the japanese word for tuna is \u30de\u30b0\u30ed - `` maguro '' , which sounds like `` megurine '' . 
  i checked yesterday and it was n't there ( in eu ) , maybe it 's gone up since then ? 
  it has not been officially updated since 1.4.2 . 
  [ here is the official topic . 
  ] ( http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/26727 - ), 
  there has been a community project to keep it up to date . 
  [ here is the topic for that . 
  ] ( http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1544827 - ), 
  i 'm not really sure what you 're asking , but only the ps3 version of project diva f is being released in na/eu . 
  i feel sorry for kaito . 
  both he and meiko only got two songs each , but at least meiko gets to go solo in hers . 
  both of kaito 's feature the girls . 
  he 's not allowed to stand on his own . 
  you should see [ the video it came from ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x21mjh6j9i4 ) . 
  you 're right . 
  that was absolutely gorgeous . 
  what struck me was the lack of any complex lighting . 
  for example , when he was sitting in the corner screaming i would expect something a little more interesting than just light from outdoors/room lights in a professional production . 
  other details like makeup seem to have been overlooked here . 
  i. . . do n't think there is a place this belongs . 
  unless someone wants to set up / r/vocaloidwtf . 
  i found it on the eu playstation store !, 
  it appears that way , and that was my first thought . 
  but if you watch [ the gameplay video where they explain her character a bit more ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqd1yjinzeq ) , you realise they 've made her just as zany as the rest of them . 
  she 's not meant to be a human female character , she 's meant to be the wii fit trainer . 
  enforce high standards !, 
  kids hate having to work at a high level , and grown-ups appreciate the challenge . 
  i 'll give you an example . 
  i 'm an admin on a popular themed creative server . 
  we have a `` showcase world '' where only the good builders are able to build . 
  the world itself has many towns and plots in it , and there 's lots of discussion on the forum about planning builds and applying to build in a certain plot . 
  in order to prove yourself as a good builder , you have to pass a building test with * very * high standards . 
  we only allow people two tries , and there is a one-week time limit on each . 
  the little kids either get discouraged by the prospect , or use up both their tries as fast as possible . 
  as a result , they lose their reserved spot and ca n't ever build in the showcase world so many of them leave . 
  the adults ( or , at least , late teens ) are either good enough at building already , or will take it upon themselves to practise hard and learn how to build well . 
  it 's secretly an attitude test as well as a building test - if you 're smart enough to know how to pass , you 're the kind of person we want . 
  heck , we even have astoundingly mature 13-year olds who passed and we like having them around . 
  #i 'm not really sure how such a process would transfer into , say , survival , but that 's how we do it !, 
  you can find similar discussion in / r/admincraft . 
  i ca n't make out a thing !, 
  i think you should turn your fov down before taking pictures . 
  absolutely . 
  but the kids do n't have the patience to practise so they do n't even think of doing that . 
  and if they do think to do that and they build something great , we 'll be happy to welcome them on board . 
  i found myself thinking that tarzan bears a striking resemblance to weird al. 
  i. . . damn . 
  wot is wot ? 
  agreed .
