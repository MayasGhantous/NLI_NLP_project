  the gameplay video pointed out that all the playable characters on 3ds have a black outline so you can see them better . 
  pikachu and kirby have the outline there , toon link does n't . 
  / r/equestriagirls would appreciate a cross-post !, 
  [ ] ( / e11-in ), 
  i guess it must be . 
  we have emotes and everything !, 
  the only way i know you can listen is through the player on the page , or through winamp/windows media player/quicktime . 
  if you 're looking for more advanced stuff , / u/memizex is the creator of it so you could ask them . 
  [ ] ( / eg17 ) you had me excited for a second . 
  tsch , sweden is not restricted by the measly laws of english grammar !, 
  i do not understand . 
  i put an announcement about this at the top of the page because i sure do love surveys !, 
  i had to pick the `` video sharing sites '' option because that seems to be the only choice for those of us not in the usa . 
  physical euro release nowhere !, 
  i know this girl ( the one pulling the face ) irl , so this is very surreal . 
  [ ] ( / chrysalis ) dare you submit an image on no pics thursday ? 
  because it costs money to put your film in a cinema !, 
  marketing would be tough , considering the airing of season one of mlp was very low-key in the uk , and season 2 never showed up at all . 
  i do , honest !, 
  i 'd post some proof , but as that involves sharing personal information i guess we 've reached a stalemate . 
  [ ] ( / twibeam ) residents of equestria !, 
  your new princess decrees that from now on , we should all start eating pigs . 
  honestly , they 're delicious !, 
  [ ] ( / twiright ) pigs are food , not friends . 
  thank you for pointing it out !, 
  i think i fixed both the problems , let me know if there 's anything else wrong . 
  [ ] ( / b34 ) you * proooobably * should n't post his real name here . 
  i finally completed the last level just the other day after trying for seven years . 
  my favourite game of all time , no doubt . 
  all these people saying game sent them theirs a day early !, 
  i think i 'll be using them instead of amazon from now on . 
  iron ? 
  i think you meant icon . 
  there 's a subreddit for lego stop-motion like this !, 
  it 's very small right now though . 
  / r/brickfilms, 
  and what a moustache , too !, 
  it never really saw much use . 
  it was bundled with animal crossing : let 's go to the city and it sat on top of your tv . 
  the idea was that everyone in the room was able to talk to the person/people on the other end , encouraging a more sociable gaming experience . 
  only in the usa !, 
  in europe , australia and japan it was called let 's go to the city . 
  is that you ? 
  it was n't youtube that killed brickfilms.com , it was a business deal that went sour . 
  revmen , the owner at the time , sold the site to a person known as thickasabrick , who was a businesswoman who knew nothing about brickfilms or running communities . 
  after she kicked out one of the admins and sparked a dispute related to advertising ( i think , this was 2007 so my memory is hazy ) , everyone packed their bags and left for [bricksinmotion.com ] ( http://www.bricksinmotion.com/ ) , where the community still resides today . 
  i 've been part of the brickfilming community for about 8 years , and i 'm inclined to believe it . 
  brickshelf is a real thing and it 's pretty niche , so it would take a dedicated impostor to do all that research . 
  it really bugged me that they kept saying `` arstotka '' rather than `` arstotzka '' . 
  the z is important !, 
  they 're not included in vanilla , you need use a texture pack which has added them . 
  as loading bars go , i 'd say the 3ds downloading one is pretty interesting . 
  i think it 's a photo in which your legs are spread at a wide angle . 
  it 's a big brickfilming family reunion !, 
  derp , it 's gon na take some getting used to not calling them texture packs anymore . 
  brilliant work !, 
  i found i could n't help but sing along . 
  i was at the last bronycon , and i can tell you the plushies went very , * very * fast . 
  if you want one , you 're gon na need to be really quick to beat everyone there , and that will probably mean missing the introduction panel . 
  most of the really cool merch ( plushies , custom/3d printed figures and so on ) went within the first 3 hours or so and after that it was mainly art prints left . 
  bronies ca n't get enough of that merch !, 
  [ ] ( / rb34 ) psst , hey, 
  i had a goofy smile on my face throughout . 
  very well made !, 
  i was n't !, 
  why , did i get it totally wrong ? 
  it 's a cool invention , but your presentation really needs work . 
  as a viewer , i do n't want to have to sit through 52 seconds of kinda irrelevant mumbling before getting to see the creation . 
  cut to the chase !, 
  [ ] ( / ra14 ) you might want to let / r/equestriagirls know about it !, 
  server advertising is not allowed here , look in / r/mcservers . 
  no , i mean anyone replying to your question would be considered to be advertising . 
  so you wo n't actually find any answers here . 
  if only !, 
  the movie is only in cinemas right now , so anyone attempting to film it would be risking a hefty fine , or even jail time . 
  those of us who are n't in the vicinity of a participating cinema will have to wait a little longer . 
  you should probably be asking [ the guy who 's actually seen the movie ] ( http://redd.it/1gepsn/ ) !, 
  we 're doomed, 
  stay strong . 
  we 'll be alright . 
  removed for trolling . 
  i spoke to the / r/mylittlepony mods and i think they want to set up the official discussion thread on / r/equestriagirls and link everyone over there . 
  that 's the plan , anyway ... 
  it 's an advice animal . 
  i would n't go expecting any high-quality observations or well-thought through content here . 
  ^ ( why do these things get upvoted so much * grumble grumble * ), 
  trust me , kids can sniff out anything minecraft-related from a mile off . 
  they 're like sharks . 
  what 's the secret to immortality ? 
  please consider cross-posting with / r/equestriagirls !, 
  people keep editing the `` parental guidance '' part of the imdb page to say terribly inappropriate things happen in the movie . 
  when i checked last it said it was full of swearing , violence and content of a mature sexual nature . 
  an official release date has not been announced . 
  if you 're looking for feedback , head to / r/mlpdrawingschool !, 
  sorry , your post got caught in the spam filter !, 
  i just fished it out now . 
  feel free to re-submit it if you like . 
  go to / r/mcservers !, 
  if you 're looking to introduce yourself , the / r/mlplounge is perhaps a better place to do it . 
  often when i 'm introducing people to vocaloid , i 'll say `` yeah , it 's cool because anyone can write a vocaloid song .
