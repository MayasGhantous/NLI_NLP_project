  oh , and vocaloids can do this . '', 
  [ ] ( / flutterwhy ) please tag your spoilers !, 
  as eager as i am to see the movie , i would n't want to watch it in blurry cameraphone quality . 
  i want to enjoy it properly , and i do n't think i could take 72 minutes of straining to work out what everything looks/sounds like . 
  thank you so much for linking this , what an article . 
  man , what i would give to see a movie made about this man 's life . 
  yes , it 's really him . 
  a quick google image search for his name will confirm that . 
  he 's completely nuts . 
  i guess he just wanted to do something funny . 
  [ ] ( / eg21 ) i 'd be cool with it . 
  it 's a cool idea , but has n't quite worked . 
  make a few trials , i 'd like to see you get it right !, 
  i know someone who did a great job of recreating this story in lego stop-motion . 
  perhaps that could come in handy too ? 
  ooh , [ t-shirts ] ( http://www.famima.com/shop/c/cmiku01/ ) !, 
  i have the `` this is a journey into sound '' one from when i last went to tokyo , but i 'm certainly tempted by some of the others ... 
  was n't the monster from this episode designed by a kid who won a blue peter competition ? 
  that might explain it . 
  this got caught in the spam filter , i just fished it out . 
  feel free to resubmit it if you like !, 
  it 's a kids ' tv show over here in the uk . 
  i checked and yep , [ according to the wiki ] ( http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/abzorbaloff ) :, 
   the name and basic design for the abzorbaloff came from a drawing by then nine-year-old william grantham , an entrant to a blue peter competition to design a monster for doctor who . 
  [ here 's the drawing .

  man , how i would love to have an / r/mylittlevocaloid ... 
  i think it would be way too niche to go anywhere though . 
  might wan na ask / r/equestriagirls !, 
  as / u/shocki said , of course this is allowed . 
  it says in the sidebar :, 
   anything about vocaloid : songs , news , pvs , etc. . . but also feel free to post submissions from utauloids , meatbags and other wannabes :p, 
  just remember to put [ oc ] in the title if it 's something you made !, 
  i really enjoyed this cover . 
  great work , i look forward to more !, 
  it 's the end of an era . 
  what a legendary series .

  i 've been doing a little research for vocaloid qr codes myself , and i found [ there 's loads on pixiv ] ( http://www.pixiv.net/search.php?s_mode=s_tag&amp;word=vocaloid%20%e3%81%a9%e3%81%86%e3%81%b6%e3%81%a4%e3%81%ae%e6%a3%ae ) .

  that 's not really the question here , / u/the _ moons is just asking if it 's like minecraft . 
  and the answer is no , it 's not like * minecraft * at all . 
  it 's certainly sandboxy , but it 's not like you can do absolutely anything you want . 
  * the sims * is a closer comparison - although while that is a ` life sim ' , * animal crossing * is ( according to wikipedia ) a ` community sim ' . 
  you play as one person living in an idyllic little japan-inspired village with adorable residents who are happy all the time . 
  it 's quite hard to explain what 's just so compelling about living out this virtual life with no specific goal , where you look to catch fish and bugs , decorate your house , plant flowers and make your town the best it can be , but trust me : it 's so much fun . 
  i had to remove this because you put the spoiler in the title . 
  she grew an extra elbow when stepping through the portal . 
  in pondering this question i started daydreaming , and began to wonder what a weird al voicebank would sound like . 
  aww , i thought you guys were gon na do this on / r/equestriagirls . 
  ### it is done, 
  i have n't actually seen the movie because i 'm all the way over in the uk , so you guys are gon na have to fill me in on all the references !, 
  if you 're for the right subreddit to post something in , ask / r/findareddit . 
  / u/serendipony makes all the emotes , i just add to them to the list . 
  ask them !, 
  a little extra info :, 
  * nick `` the cage '' cage is there because he is sips 's lawyer . 
  * philip `` uncle phil '' banks is there because he owned just about every mansion in sipswater valley . 
  no , but i when i talked to the / r/mlp mods they said they were planning to set up the discussion topic there . 
  i guess not !, 
  thank you mojang for staying true to your users all this time . 
  psst , if you wan na do a hashtag on reddit you have to put a backslash in front of it . 
  i 've got ta say , lewis is looking exceptionally handsome in this video . 
  it looks great !, 
  i love the faces in the sidebar . 
  the one thing that bugs me is that the header is in badaboom bb as opposed to yogfont , but i 'm nitpicking . 
  maybe if you asked a yogscast member * really * nicely they could write out the words '' \\ / r/yogscast '' for you ? 
  this is starting to sound a lot like ask jappleack . 
  i really hope you enjoy it !, 
  well , there is n't a proper word for it . 
  [ ] ( / c33 ) that 's so cute !, 
  we 'd love it if you shared it with / r/equestriagirls . 
  it 's good , and certainly better than the current launcher , but not perfect . 
  * the blurry background feels jarring and does n't really fit with the minecraft style . 
  * the stone block background for the tumblr feed is a bit much . 
  it distracts from the words themselves . 
  either a block colour , or the same texture but much darker ( like the / r/minecraft header ) would make it easier to read . 
  * the `` updates / development etc. '', 
  tabs at the top are almost unnoticeable , and it 's hard to notice which one is selected . 
  make them look like tabs , maybe ? 
  overall , it just needs to be a bit less . 
  do n't underestimate the power of simplicity . 
  you mean like / u/googlesyourusername ? 
  i do n't know for sure , but when i went to japan and played project diva arcade for myself , the regular players had a sort of card which they tapped on the machine to save their progress . 
  perhaps replays are saved on there ? 
  yep !, 
  that 's not true .
