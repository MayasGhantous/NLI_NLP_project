  you wo n't be able to change your minecraft username , although mojang said they will be looking into freeing up squatted usernames which never bought the game . 
  so you will * sorta * be able to change your username by switching accounts , but for the price of 20 bucks . 
  the implication of you posting it here is that you might want feedback ... 
  it 's * not * perfect and people are here to help you understand why and give you constructive criticism . 
  i know , but that 's very different . 
  that looks good because it provides a nice contrast against the big fat buttons in the middle of the main menu , whereas here it just feels distracting and makes it harder to focus on the text . 
  / u/bizurkhate made a very good point about where the eye is led around the page . 
  i find it very hard to read the text at all because my eyes keep getting drawn away towards anything green . 
  no one giving constructive feedback here is saying you 've done a bad job - we 're trying to help you improve by saying what could be done better . 
  you 'd learn a lot if you listen to us rather than try to pick us apart !, 
  project diva arcade , not project diva f . as the name suggests , project diva arcade is an arcade machine game . 
  it looks like yogventures to me . 
  the style is very similar . 
  [ ] ( / eg03 ) the thumbnail 's still adorable though . 
  this video made me realise how odd it must be to be a voice actor for the sims . 
  ^ ( edit : typo ), 
  the mobs are too adorable !, 
  i 'd never want to kill any of them . 
  that sounds like a real adventure though . 
  was it worth it ? 
  yeah , this was established a while ago . 
  dinnerbone said instead of the regular `` new update available '' screen , a link would be given to the new launcher . 
  it was n't actually tweeted by a mojangster though . 
  dinnerbone just retweeted it . 
  the english rankings are much more disheartening than those in the japanese game . 
  i 'd rather be called `` cheap '' than `` lousy '' . 
  i know i 'd prefer plot holes to a dull movie . 
  . . but pretty adorable . 
  [ ] ( / eg17 ) i 'm not really sure how to interpret this . 
  honestly , i think specifically cat memes are the least of our worries nowadays ... 
  there 's [ an faq linked in the sidebar which can answer many of your questions ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/mylittlepony/wiki/faq ) !, 
  short answer is that we think it 's a really well-made and enjoyable cartoon . 
  mojang please add the ability to throw chickens through windows, 
  i 'm having flashbacks to [ cry of fear ] ( http://www.cry-of-fear.com/ ) just looking at these . 
  great work !, 
  all that garlic has gone to wario 's brain . 
  [ ] ( / b25 ) do the whole thing !, 
  it 's not from an informercial , just a regular advert . 
  ( we do n't really have informercials in the uk ... ), 
  [ i found the video it came from !, 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6rzctiiah4 ) ( the gif part starts at 0:17 . ), 
  i think this was funnier without the text . 
  did ... did you upload that video specially to comment on this post ? 
  most reddits users are american , so most content is american !, 
  [ ] ( / ohhi `` i have n't seen the movie yet !, 
  i plan to watch the cropped and colour-corrected version posted by / u/astaen on the subreddit . 
  in fact , that version is so good i think i 'll put an announcement at the top telling people about it . '' ), 
  i put this at the top because it 's really good !, 
  teleshopping is different . 
  infomericals are fairly long , often low-budget adverts , whereas teleshopping is a live pitch for you to buy what they 're selling , often featuring many items in succession . 
  it was pretty much just stolen from [ the most intellectual jokes thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/1h1cyg/whats_the_most_intellectual_joke_you_know/capuqzn ) from earlier this week . 
  omg gulpeg stop replying to all of weird al 's comments , it 's embarrassing, 
  [ you 're too slow !, 
  i 've found this upside-down feature has proven really useful for making resource packs . 
  there 's been many occasions where i 've had to texture the underside of a mob and i had to build a glass contraption for it to stand in , but now i can just flip it !, 
  someone else already posted this video ( which is why i linked that post ) . 
  this merits its own post !, 
  [ ] ( / ajlie ) no secret conversations going on under people 's noses here !, 
  no sir !, 
  paging / u/australian _ translate !, 
  it 's really imaginative and very , very pretty . 
  fantastic work !, 
  what 's wrong with charcoal ? 
  [ ] ( / a05 ) / r/mylittlepony does n't like image macros much . 
  ( and rightly so , i think . ), 
  [ ] ( / eg12 ) i 'm tempted to make this an emote , but i 'm not sure what possible use it could have . 
  as far as i know , there has not been a release date announced . 
  [ the vocaloid wiki has a whole page compiling all the information we know about english miku . 
  ] ( http://vocaloid.wikia.com/wiki/hatsune_miku_english ) stay tuned to that , i guess !, 
  there is n't a nice amalgamated list of all the conventions with their attendances . 
  it 's partly because some cons prefer to keep the number of attendees secret until later on . 
  i know that [ bronycon announced yesterday that they 'd just passed 4,000 ] ( https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=601999369833721&amp;set=a.313056275394700.79931.313013458732315&amp;type=1 ) , but that 's about it . 
  new leaf balloons come in all colours !, 
  it has been posted a few times on / r/equestriagirls , i know that much !, 
  what a shot !, 
  [ ] ( / c25 ) it does n't taste of raisins though . 
  if i 'm looking for physical-copy from japan , i find [ cdjapan ] ( http://www.cdjapan.co.jp/ ) is a really good place for it . 
  i ca n't find the album you 're looking for , though . 
  the / r/mylittlepony front page is covered with art most of the time , so i think it 's a pretty good place for finding pony art . 
  we do n't really need a separate subreddit !, 
  perhaps better-suited to / r/mlpmature !, 
  introducing ` [ ] ( / bookz ) ` :, 
  [ ] ( / bookz-in ), 
  ( secret emote , she wo n't be in the sidebar list . ), 
   ### not found . 
   ## we could n't find the page you were looking for . 
  . . perhaps this would be better suited to / r/mlpmature . 
  if you check [ the page history ] ( http://www.minecraftwiki.net/index.php?title=enchanting&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=499319 ) , it 'll tell you a username if they had one . 
  sunset shimmer makes the * ruuuuuurrrrrr * s around here . 
  wow !, 
  while that person was certainly right about many things there , i ca n't help but feel they went a * little * overboard with the criticism ... 
  well you 'd better [ report it ] ( https://mojang.atlassian.net/browse/mc ) !, 
  which is exactly the point . 
  they 're trolling to see how many downvotes they can get . 
  sorry , this got caught in the spam filter !, 
  i fished it out now , but if you 'd like to resubmit it , go ahead !, 
  someone who is trolling to see how many downvotes they can get . 
  too late !, 
  they 're now yogscast sips and yogscast sjin , respectively .
