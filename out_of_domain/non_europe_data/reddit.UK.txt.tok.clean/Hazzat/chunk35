  well , this * was * released a day or two after the season 2 finale . 
  you guys may wan na visit / r/mylittleminecraft !, 
  that 's actually the pun for sea grapes ( `` see ? 
  grapes ! '' ), 
  the remark for sea bass is `` what ?!, 
  you again ?! '', 
  [ ] ( / chrysalis ) * fligoodada chrys-ili-iiis !, 
  do n't worry charcoal , we 've all been there . 
  that 's my girls !, 
  which iceland are we talking here ? 
  heck yeah , i love hey ocean !, 
  i ca n't wait for their worldwide tour to actually go worldwide , they 've only stuck to north america so far . 
  i 'm all for pony stuff , but geez , not the g3 logo . 
  no one deserves that . 
  [ ] ( / b24 ) as it 's a brand new account made specially for this post , i smell a rat . 
  it may just be a slimy campaign for that guy to get more likes on his facebook page . 
  the fact that it 's the g3 logo makes me think no actualy pony-fans were involved at all . 
  i said this in another comment , but i would n't trust this at all . 
  it 's a brand new account and the `` pony tattoo '' is the g3 logo meaning it 's likely no pony-fans were involved at all . 
  [ ] ( / fluttershh ) i highly suspect this is a slimy campaign to promote this guy 's page and we would all be better off just ignoring it . 
  [ mlp wiki says : august 6th !, 
  ] ( http://mlp.wikia.com/wiki/equestria_girls#home_media ), 
  the mlp wiki has [ a short list ] ( http://mlp.wikia.com/wiki/list_of_allusions#my_little_pony_equestria_girls ) , but it 's hardly comprehensive . 
  perhaps you could edit it to add more ? 
  why 'd you take the picture at night ? 
  i ca n't see a thing !, 
  i have n't made them myself , but [ here are all the mane - er , * main * 6 's outfits !, 
  the same person also made [ sunset shimmer and dj hu-m4n ] ( http://derpibooru.org/359259 ) 's outfits , as well as [ trixie 's ] ( http://derpibooru.org/362779 ) . 
  i thought this was so adorable , i made it the new header of / r/mylittleminecraft . 
  me neither . 
  i know a lot of the reaction amongst mine little pony/love & tolerance texture pack users has been `` haha what are you gon na do about horses !? '', 
  but i do n't really see what the deal is ... 
  you can cross-post this with / r/equestriagirls !, 
  great work on all of them . 
  ~ ~ brad ~ ~ flash sentry !, 
  i have n't seen him done yet . 
  when i have my own place ... this is what it will look like . 
  yep , the problem is with the texture pack . 
  minecraft 1.6 ca n't handle hd fonts . 
  [ ] ( / a15 ) that is one pretty rendition of her cutie mark . 
  [ ] ( / a03 ) it 's the time of year when all the little fillies and colts pester their parents to buy them hasbro-brand merchandise . 
  awesome work !, 
  i love how you did his quiff . 
  * alicorn * ^ ( who lives covertly in ponyville !? 
  * shipped with fluttershy, 
  * weird body patterns, 
  * forced physical ailment, 
  * introverted, 
  * unreasonably smart, 
  [ ] ( / b34 ) you 're ticking a lot of common tropes of bad ocs here ... 
  [ ] ( / a38 ) ** bad ship bad ship bad ship **, 
  meta-inf is like a warranty . 
  it has a certificate in it that says `` this code is officially safe , it will not harm your computer '' . 
  every time you start minecraft , the game checks to see if what 's written in meta-inf matches up with the game 's code . 
  if you 've modded the game , it does n't match up and your computer ca n't confirm that all the code is safe to use . 
  by deleting meta-inf , the game ca n't do this check anymore and will run no matter what . 
  so every time you install a mod , you are taking a risk and trusting that the mod creator has no plans to do anything malicious , because meta-inf is not there to protect you !, 
  you 're being a bit vague ... what kind of server is it ? 
  what sort of audience are you trying to attract ? 
  how easy do you want it to be for people to get stuff ? 
  you might find better answers in / r/admincraft . 
  [ ] ( / lyra ) three posts in two days is certainly above average !, 
  that was witty , informative and well-written . 
  i 've never been so enthused about little girls ' dolls before !, 
  if you want to keep using isabella , hope is not all lost . 
  if you download [ mcpatcher ] ( http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1496369-161-152-147update-71-mcpatcher-hd-fix-410/ ) and run the `` convert texture pack '' feature on it to make it a 1.6 resource pack , it 'll work just fine . 
  all the new textures will still be default , but i do n't think that 's too much of a shame . 
  [ ] ( / c26 ) i 'm in !, 
  but blathers !, 
  i wanted you to go on a tangent !, 
  yay , more vocaloid international presence !, 
  i wonder if this will be at all related to the end . 
  i can understand the sentiment that it might get commercialised , especially as it goes overseas . 
  i wish i could remember where i read the observation that in japan vocaloid was marketed as an instrument , but in the usa miku is marketed as a pop star . 
  yep , it 's this november . 
  i 've got my ticket !, 
  [ ] ( / c17 ) ** tag your spoilers !!, 
  [ ] ( / rarityprimp ) people are still doing this ? 
  darling , being a mac or pc fanboy went out of style in 2005 . 
  i took it as meaning `` mac users are annoying and obnoxious '' . 
  but i agree with the sentiment that cross-platform is pretty necessary . 
  what the heck is stea**rn**powered.com and why does n't wot trust it ? 
  i 'm not clicking that stuff . 
  [ ] ( / c24 ) she 's * beaaaauutiful * . 
  i assume you mean install , because you download a mod the same way you download any other file . 
  i think you 're reading outdated instructions and it 's likely the mod you 're trying to install has not been updated for 1.6.1 . minecraft.jar is no longer called minecraft.jar ( it 's called 1.6.1 . jar ) and is in the `` versions '' folder . 
  yes , we know ... 
  this was not a very good choice of texture pack for showing this off . 
  i can barely tell one stone block from the next ... 
  yeah , the day it was added the front page of / r/minecraft was absolutely flooded with people posting pics of their upside-down mobs . 
  most of us are a bit fed up of it by now , sorry . 
  [ ] ( / spikemeh ) busted . 
   i realized it is a lot harder then you would imagine lol . 
  there 's a reason for that , and i 'll tell you why in a minute . 
   always upload 1080p quality and use a blue snowball mic for the best audio . 
  that 's only the start . 
  having really good audio/video quality is a nice bonus , but does n't mean squat if the content itself is n't interesting . 
  i have n't seen any of your videos so i ca n't critique them , but the most important thing is that you have to ** give people something to watch ** . 
  people are n't looking to watch someone play minecraft , they 're there to laugh , or be entertained , or be impressed by something . 
  and the fact is that most people just are n't cut out for that .
