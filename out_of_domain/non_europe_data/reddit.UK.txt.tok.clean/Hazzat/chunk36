  youtube is * unbelievably * oversaturated with minecraft videos . 
  there 's an absolutely astronomical number of them out there , and unless you bring something really really special to the table , you 're just another face in the crowd . 
  unless you 've got something truly unique to show your potential audience , i seriously doubt you will get anywhere . 
  what is the problem ? 
  is the console there turning out an error , or do you just not like looking at it ? 
  they might be using cobblestone monster eggs . 
  [ ] ( / chibidash ) that 's kawaii !, 
  [ ] ( / c12 ) `` black slimy changeling queen '' has the same number of syllables !, 
  hasbro has trademarked :, 
  * the names of most major and ponies ( the ones that appear in blind bags ), 
  * their cutie marks, 
  * the brands `` my little pony '' and `` my little pony : friendship is magic '', 
  as long as none of the above feature in the store , it 's all above board . 
  `` chrissi '' is borderline , but should still be safe . 
  bananas . 
  actually , a whole tropical biome to go along with it . 
  fruit of every sort !, 
  you 're right . 
  i just wonder if chrysalis 's name and likeness have been trademarked because i doubt hasbro is about to release a toy of her . 
  er , there already is one ... 
  / r/texturecraft, 
  [ phwoar , myrandall beaten to the punch at posting pony art ? 
  ] ( http://redd.it/1hsr08 ) i never though i 'd see it happen . 
  [ ] ( / c10 ) thanks for keeping the / r/mylittlepony front page stocked with quality content though !, 
  it 's just a little redundant to set up a new one , that 's all . 
  if a subreddit does n't have much content , it makes more sense to revive it than to start up a new one . 
  if a subreddit 's mods look inactive , it 's easy enough to breathe it back into life by asking the mods to , or by claiming it via / r/redditrequest . 
  yeah , what 's with the ridiculous influx of [ til ] posts lately ? 
  it feels like a way of showing off something that 's already in the game without putting in any effort . 
  i think it may have to do with summer vacation having started . 
  if you would like to build a lego minecraft chicken of your own , [ here are the instructions ] ( http://www.eightclickbrick.com/2012/07/lego-minecraft-chicken-instructions.html ) !, 
  yep , [ it was posted here about 10 days ago ] ( http://redd.it/1h5ojq ) . 
  yeah they are . 
  they 're just laid out a little differently under the hood and resource packs can do more stuff , but that does n't render a subreddit originally about texture packs obsolete . 
  maybe you should try not feeding the trolls . 
  ferd is on a conscious sprint to get the lowest karma count possible , while annoying as many people as they can on the way . 
  it 's unlikely , given that the development team is in japan and mlp : fim has only just reached those shores . 
  it 's the emblem for the fictional unitology religion from the dead space video game series . 
  it 's not some secret message !, 
   is there any way to cheat and teleport out ? 
  yes , you can use [ mcedit ] ( http://www.mcedit.net/ ) to move your player to a safer location . 
  i 've had `` socks '' come up several times . 
  ooh , mint green and purple . 
  that 's a lovely colour combination for an oc . 
  i checked mine and , by some stroke of luck , it said golden stag . 
  i 'm gon na make a killing tonight !, 
  by being a troll , duh . 
  they 're looking to get a reaction . 
  oh my gosh , stop thinking ferb is not a troll . 
  you should give 'em to your friends !, 
  most people i know do n't have one yet , and i only got mine after someone gave me one . 
  if there 's no beating him , you can always try joining the fan club at / r/fabulousferds . 
  welcome to reddit , new comment-sketching novelty account . 
  normal difficulty is just the start , my friend ... 
  that 's not new . 
  they 've been spawning in swamps for a few updates now . 
  ah , i remember the wip of being being posted on / r/mlpdrawingschool way back when . 
  it came a long way !, 
  mods are not part of the vanilla game , so mojang is under no obligation to support them . 
  but ... time zones ? 
  3 o ' clock does n't exist on the internet . 
  application support  minecraft  versions  1.6.2, 
  calm down . 
  [ sorry , you got beaten to the punch on this news !, 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/vocaloid/comments/1hpka5/its_official_hatsune_miku_english_will_be/ ), 
  it is , but how exactly is it relevant to anything here ? 
  evidently so , as it 's been posted at least 7 times today .

  aww , does loe use the celestia unlimited font ? 
  tsk tsk , they should really fork out the 20 bucks for generation b , the * actual * mlp : fim typeface . 
   they have tried to implement optifine before , but the maker denied them permission, 
  i 'm pretty sure that 's not true . 
  what actually transpired is fairly secretive , but when asking a mojangsta will say something along the lines of `` they did n't have the interest of the users at heart '' . 
  steps are taken towards the mod api with every update , whether it be single/multiplayer being merged , enormous backend changes being made and resource packs being implemented . 
  it 's a much larger project than they first anticipated , but steps are being taken all the time . 
  you still * can * mod your mac game , so i do n't know what you 're complaining about . 
  even if it 's slightly more fiddly now , it 's not mojang 's fault as they are not responsible for mods . 
  cool it . 
  the owner of mikufan.com has been hanging around ax , and they were posting pictures of everything they saw . 
  the first i heard was when they posted [ this picture ] ( https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=488179101256264 ) on their facebook page !, 
  only `` standard '' on extreme sadistic music factory ? 
  pssh , lightweight . 
  ^ ( just kidding , i 'm just jealous because i wish i could get a perfect :( ), 
  nope , it 's canon . 
  [ meghan mccarthy said on her twitter that is takes place before season 4 . 
  eqg wo n't have any effect on the show though . 
  heck , [ flash sentry is n't even a character in it ] ( https://twitter.com/mmeghanmccarthy/status/346349093565652992 ) . 
  not a mod , but a map for the xbox 360 version . 
  and yeah , ** putt-putt ^ \u00ae ** 's legal team has no idea what minecraft is and wrote to notch to get mojang to stop using their trademark . 
  not putt-putt .
