  what 's your issue with the word ? 
  its use is so widespread and commonplace that i doubt whining about it in reddit comments is going to make much of a difference . 
  [ ] ( / a14 ) i 'm gon na be on the minecraft panel !, 
  at 3:15 pm on saturday !, 
  [ ] ( / b30 ) at the same time as * ponies : the anthology 3 * ... 
  your guess is as good as mine !, 
  but hey , i 'd take anything that 's got miku on it . 
   they treat it like a cult and are always trying to suck you in, 
  when you start generalising large groups of people , you 're going to make a lot of mistakes . 
  i 've been following the fandom for about 2 years , managed communities , participated in meetups , gone to conventions etc. 
  ( basically , i 've met a lot of bronies ) and i really ca n't stress enough that the hyper-obsessed ones who think the show is the greatest thing to ever grace us television screens and will do their best to make sure everyone in the world is watching it are * absolutely the outlying minority * . 
  you just hear the most from them because they 're the loudest . 
  most bronies * are * sensible , reasonable people who treat it like it 's a tv show and not the gospel , wo n't force it on you , will only bring it up if it 's relevant and so on . 
  i think the perception comes from everyone having has an experience with annoying brony ( heck , even i was annoying brony for the first week before i calmed down ) . 
  [ this smbc comic sums it up well . 
  the world is ( pseudo - ) infinite and randomly generated , so if you keep going in any direction over an ocean it is a statistical certainty that you will find land eventually . 
  who knows how much ocean you 'll have to cross first , though ? 
  when i was little i won a collection of smurfs cd-rom pc games from a competition in a magazine . 
  it can happen !, 
  you picked up some experience orbs . 
  the number 1 means you are on level 1 , and the bar shows how close you are to level 2 . 
  you can spend your levels on enchanting tools with an enchanting table , or naming/repairing them in an anvil . 
  not stupid , just young . 
  i was unleashed onto internet forums at the tender age of 8 years old , and i spammed the heck out of them . 
  i was n't dumb , just uneducated in how to behave . 
  are you a horse ? 
  a little variety would have been nice . 
  well , it 's subjective . 
  i was n't dumb by 8 year-old standards . 
  [ here 's the official website ] ( http://kc-i.jp/event/miku/ ) !, 
  it 's in japanese though . 
  that 's ` moog city ' by c418 . 
  you can get it as part of the [ minecraft - volume alpha ] ( http://c418.bandcamp.com/album/minecraft-volume-alpha ) album . 
  [ ] ( / a14 ) i can see / r/openears is off to a great start !, 
  . . i 'm not really sure what your point is . 
  it works , although there 's three of the same grey flairs ... 
  perhaps a blank , editable one ? 
  * only 90s kids will remember ~ *, 
  it 's a tired and well-trodden argument that beta 1.7.3 was the last of `` old minecraft '' , and that everything that came after feels different . 
  this is n't really a new idea . 
  if you want that blast of nostalgia , go back to beta 1.7.3 and live out your glory days again . 
  i know i plan on doing it when they add all the old versions to the launcher . 
  the alien 's name is snoo , not `` master '' ... 
  1.6 made some massive technical changes to minecraft , meaning most mods are taking longer than usual to update . 
  but , as others have pointed out , optifine for 1.6 is already released . 
  in new leaf , you can upload your town to the internet and people can download it in-game to visit it in a dream . 
  the japanese ones are all a bit crazy like this !, 
  can you give us the dream code so we can visit it ourselves ? 
  i hope so too !, 
  i 've heard that it 's likely to be shown in oxford , so there 's probably a fair few showings yet to be announced . 
  `` ha ha this will be fun '', 
  * flooded with modmail *, 
  `` this is not fun '', 
  i mean , i have actual subreddits i need to be moderating , i ca n't be dealin ' with all this modmail . 
  but i just ca n't quit you , / r/modeveryone . 
  i just do n't know what to believe . 
  * i 'm overcome with grief !, 
  you do n't just comment here , you have to write / r/modeveryone in a comment . 
  i know minecraft inside-out , and can do css too . 
  ( previous work includes / r/brogres and / r/equestriagirls . ), 
  i see you 've already got / u/unacceptableuse making some changes , but if you 'd like another helping hand i 'm here !, 
  the rainbows only show up on firefox . 
  the lazy person who did that css did n't bother to make it work on any other browsers . 
  never let that ogirl leave your swamp, 
  lyra is often depicted as being a [ lyre ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lyre ) player . 
  that 's the closest thing she has to a job in fanon !, 
  / r/minecraft has [ some guidelines ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/minecraft/wiki/rules ) on promoting your own youtube videos , and i think you 're toeing the line a bit . 
   ### youtube videos , let 's plays , channel promotions and what we consider as spam . 
   generally speaking , it 's fine to post a related youtube video , but when that 's all that a user posts they are not participating in the community , they 're abusing it . 
  excessively posting videos from a channel constitutes as spam in that the aim is only to increase traffic to the videos or to gain subscribers . 
  repeatedly posting videos and not contributing to the community ( via non-video submissions or discussion on other posts ) will result in a [ friendly warning ] ( http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq#wiki_what_constitutes_spam.3f ) . 
  only if this warning is ignored will an account receive a ban . 
   90 % of this is enforced entirely by our / u/moderator-bot . 
  an algorithm was developed that has been effective at detecting users that we would judge to be on the verge of being a video spammer . 
  this algorithm assesses the last 100 comments and last 100 submissions of a user and gives them a score that is then used to determine if they should be considered to be spamming . 
  the number of videos , the frequency of what video authors are submitted , and the number of comments on their own submissions and that of others ' are all used to calculate this . 
   for more information and discussion , please check out [ this modpost on the topic ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/minecraft/comments/13crp5/youtube_promotion_whats_good_and_whats_not_plus/ ) . 
  again , if you have any further questions , [ you can send us a message ] ( http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2fminecraft ) !, 
  it 's not my job to enforce the rules and i ca n't say for sure that you 're breaking them , but be careful . 
  either way , let 's plays are pretty universally downvoted here . 
  really ? 
  it looks like the chests were organised before they were destroyed . 
  you can see food on the left , rare things ( gold , lapis , redstone ) at the back , coal and iron in the middle , cobblestone and flint on the right ... 
   live outside, 
  probably appealing to the wrong crowd here . 
  or , more specifically , like the css colour after which it was named . 
  but miku english is very 2013 !, 
  you probably should have set your difficulty to peaceful first before you started recording . 
  golly , the thames is looking placid today . 
  da rules :, 
   2 ) ** askreddit is for thought-provoking , discussion-inspiring questions . 
  you were looking for / r/help or / r/answers . 
  again ? 
  geez , i 'm losing count of how many times the fandom has ended . 
  / r/mylittlepony prefers really high-quality content like art , comics and discussion on its front page . 
  look at the front page now and almost all of it is that !, 
  image macros and rough photoshops do n't tend to go down well . 
  i know this can be a shock given reddit 's love for those , but i think it 's pretty cool . 
  banned from [ just about everywhere ] ( http://redd.it/1b944j ) .
