  oh yeah , i guess so now you mention it . 
  either way , she 's adorable . 
  as the guide keeps getting removed from the sidebar , the way to become a mod is to simply write / r/modeveryone in a comment anywhere on reddit . 
  you need a backslash , buddy . 
  becomes, 
  [ ] ( / abmad ) four legs good , two legs ... also good !, 
  i used to enjoy / r/cringe back when it was much smaller , but i had to quit after one too many posts that were essentially `` haha , look at these people enjoying themselves doing something i do n't like '' . 
  it 's no secret that brony meets and conventions can get a bit off-the-rails ( just like in any other fandom ) , but i do n't see why people enjoy ridiculing that . 
  just so you know , x-posting generally means just posting the same link rather than linking to the previous reddit post ... 
  it is . 
  that 's why i chose to resign , but you can drop in and out whenever you like . 
  i 'm the one mod who actually does anything around here . 
  i think it is somewhat of a shame that / r/mylittleminecraft does n't get all that many posts , but i do n't find it too heartbreaking . 
  i do what i can to promote the sub ( like if something minecrafty gets posted in / r/mylittlepony , i 'll leave a comment asking them to check this out . 
  i do the same thing with / r/equestriagirls ) . 
  mlp minecraft is certainly a small niche , and it seems that most builds are just pixel art , so there just is n't all that much content being made . 
  and i 'd rather have little content than just swathes of pixel art , which is why i put the big pink text about it on the submit page . 
  i think the inactivity here is simply down to the subject matter . 
  if you want more stuff to be posted , the best thing you can do is get your minecraft-playing brony friends to build more ( interesting ) stuff . 
  there 's loads of things you can build , from 3d pony models , to ponyville houses , landmarks from the show , all of equestria , all of cloudsdale ... 
  the content needs to be there first before people can post it !, 
  i was at the last bronycon and i 'll be at the next one . 
   what was the original reason they disabled comments on their videos ? 
  people were using google + accounts to make comments under the name bluexephos . 
  they would say stuff like `` simon is dead '' and the comments section would be set ablaze with people responding to them . 
  the comments had been in a bit of a state for a while , but that 's what triggered it . 
  even when one of those did n't show up , most of the comments were pretty much one of these :, 
  * trolls ( `` i 'm a mother and the yogscast should stop swearing or i 'll call the police ... '', 
  * people falling for the troll, 
  * people telling people that it is , in fact , a troll, 
  * quotes from the video ( which spoil it for people who are half-done watching ), 
  * `` where 's shadow of israphel ?? '', 
  youtube also made it so you do n't need lots of comments if you want to be on the ` most popular ' list anymore , so it was safe to turn them off . 
  we certainly do n't mind !, 
  / r/yogscast likes the yogscast more than / r/minecraft likes the yogscast . 
  i think it 's too soon for a movie like this . 
  you ca n't dramatise historical events until you 've seen their long-term consequences and resolution , and those are still taking place today . 
  good grief , that 's a lot of subway logos . 
  is all that actual paid product placement , or is it part of a joke in the show ? 
  it 's a humanised version of pinkie pie 's insane/depressed alter-ego from the party of one episode . 
  when her hair goes flat , she is often referred to as pinkamena diane pie . 
  be sure to check out / r/mlpdrawingschool if you want to learn how to improve !, 
  it is a bug , and the result of the green colour being overlayed on the leaves on the zombie 's head . 
  i prefer `` dubtrot '' . 
  i 've heard stories of guys who were watching the show with their little sister , and only discovered the online community later . 
  of course if you want to join in the big brony party , you need someone to introduce you , but i do n't think a push is necessary . 
  it 's a really cute start !, 
  you look like you 're straying to match the show 's style , which is a great place to begin , but your anatomy is way off . 
  the neck is a bit long , the ear is a bit small ( and looks like it 's floating ) and the hock - the notch on the leg - is much further down than it should be . 
  this subreddit has loads of great tutorials to help you get your pony anatomy right , all linked in the sidebar . 
  [ here 's one !, 
  ] ( http://redd.it/pxmj9 ) it may seem like a lot of reading , but trust me : it 's all worth it . 
  welcome to the world of pony art !, 
  i just ca n't help feel that the iron is still warming up !, 
  psst , there 's a reply button you can use to reply to comments !, 
  [ ] ( / colgate ) do n't worry , you 're forgiven !, 
  the first screenshot kinda debunks that theory . 
  i think / r/polandball is pretty fantastic . 
  the comics are often clever , witty observations of relationships between countries , or amusing retellings of historical events . 
  the subreddit itself is heavily moderated to ensure strict quality control , too . 
  i do n't think we have much need for an / r/ponyball though , given that ponies - unlike countries - already have illustrated forms . 
  hey , i thought poison damage ca n't kill you . 
  my goodness , you actually spelled ` makka pakka ' correctly . 
  ferd is an infamous comment troll who 's on a conscious sprint to get the lowest comment karma possible . 
  he has a fan club at / r/fabulousferds . 
  every single one looks so good !, 
  how do you go about creating colour schemes for your ocs ? 
  i always have a lot of trouble getting it right . 
  it 's pretty , but it does n't really look much like a launcher . 
  more like a title screen . 
  with -33,000 comment karma , it 's pretty clear that ferd is a troll and a prolific one at that . 
  he has become infamous , and has a fan club at / r/fabulousferds . 
  i have no doubt that someone will be uploading it very shortly afterwards . 
  [ diaspora * ] ( https://joindiaspora.com/ ) was meant to be the big privacy-centric facebook killer , i remember a lot of hype around it when it was first announced . 
  then they spent so long developing it that no one was interested by the time it went live . 
  [ ] ( / spikemeh ) spike is not a pony . 
  this has got ta be one of my favourite letsnotmeet stories . 
  thanks so much for sharing !, 
  they 're up to the point where they 're deciding who 's going to be the one wearing the triforce lingerie . 
  i 'm an ` aspiring designer ' because i 've been drawing all these paths for my town . 
  although i 'm scared of becoming a ` stump maker ' as i clear the way for all these paths to be placed ... 
  exactly !, 
  my animal crossing town is n't going to run itself . 
  original content is always something to be praised , especially in a place where most of the popular content is oot screenshots and questionable image macros . 
  keep making stuff !, 
  i think you 'd benefit from spending a bit more time outside . 
  actually , scratch that . 
  i think we 'd * all * benefit from that . 
  this is not a damn rage novel, 
  where the heck are the mods, 
   2 ) ** askreddit is for thought-provoking , discussion-inspiring questions . 
  you are asking in the wrong place . 
  go to / r/findareddit . 
  it depends . 
  is there a garden chair in view ? 
  yeah , it 's kinda like the negative space that exists so we can have an ` in ` side . 
  that was a mean thing to do !, 
  it looks bloody brilliant . 
  it 's worse , the post got over 3,000 upvotes . 
  it 's the ~ 1,600 downvotes that brought the score down .
