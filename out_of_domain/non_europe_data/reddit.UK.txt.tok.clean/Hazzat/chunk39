  stop taking ferd seriously , oh my gosh . 
  you should probably be asking / r/admincraft . 
  / r/unitedkingdom and / r/ukpolitics are good for stuff like that !, 
  the thing with skins is that it 's so much cooler to have a character as your skin ( human or otherwise ) , rather than just a representation of your irl self . 
  a lot of people do n't realise that and it 's why there 's the plague of `` teen '' skins . 
  absolutely . 
  i refuse to believe it 's at all possible anymore to become popular from making minecraft videos . 
  the market is way too oversaturated . 
  do a youtube search for `` let 's play minecraft '' and there are * over 1.5 million results * . 
  to stand out in that crowd ( and i think calling it a `` crowd '' is understating it at this point ) you have to bring something truly amazing and unprecedented to the table . 
  it 's got to be something so fantastic and original , everyone will want to share it with everyone they know . 
  the last time i saw something like that was the [ beetlejuice rollercoaster ] ( http://youtube.com/watch?v=afcudstm9za ) , and even that did n't result in a huge lasting fanbase . 
  wow , that 's pretty horrible of you . 
  uh , no it should n't . 
  we do n't need to encourage yet more advice animals ( they 're enough of a plague as it is ) , and submitting them here is against [ the / r/minecraft rules ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/minecraft/wiki/rules ) . 
  ** image macros , demotivational posters , and rage comics are not allowed . 
  that is because you can not spawn them in vanilla . 
  you need something like mcedit to do it . 
  you are looking for / r/mcservers . 
  do n't be afraid to turn people away . 
  the players you 're looking for like a mature community , high standards and as few little kids as possible . 
  implement tests to weed out the people who do n't want to read anything , and do n't be afraid to ban anyone who 's being a nuisance towards other players .

  in minecraft there 's no such thing as animal rights . 
  thank goodness for it . 
  you are being trolled , the only correct move is not to respond . 
  they are a troll who is looking to get reactions just like this . 
  c'mon , i thought that was obvious . 
  please no more reaction gif posts like this !, 
  gifs from animal crossing are fine , but this is really tenuously related . 
  i think the 180-degree rule was broken a few times after they crossed the street , which is what bugged me the most . 
  i got a little disoriented . 
  nah , it was on / r/letsnotmeet first . 
  you can see in the comments there someone told them to post it on / r/nosleep too . 
  i 've been a fan of letsnotmeet for a long time , and i 'm happy it 's seeing so much attention .

  it 's the name of [ a character ] ( http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/akatsuki ) from the anime naruto .

  suki is also the japanese word for love .

  my headcanon is that they sell everything to tortimer 's island complex . 
  those tours require a large number of very specific bugs/fish/furniture / fossils/items , and re-tail has a warehouse filled with all the appropriate things , which tortimer can purchase on demand . 
  seems appropriate as the hd blu-ray rip just appeared on youtube .

  you have n't finished streetpass quest until you 've got every single hat . 
  i got my 3ds on * launch day * - i even got my first streetpass hit then too . 
  i take it absolutely everywhere , i 've been to tokyo and loads of conventions and even i have n't got all the hats . 
  you 're in for a long ride !, 
  how do you get more than one item show up on the sign ? 
  is it dependent on luck ? 
  i 've got ta say , i 'd hire someone who can draw corn that well . 
  nah , you needed to click the spoiler button next to the post to hide the thumbnail and mark it as a spoiler .
