  it might come in handy if this post got some touchy responses . 
  i came here to post just that , the resemblance is uncanny . 
  edit : i killed the joke . 
  i have edited out my joke-killing . 
  okay , i edited it out !, 
  i 'll take it !, 
  i love cats millionaire 's music so much , it 's always so clever and subtly pony . 
  the intersection matches the original republican/democrat poster pretty well , i think he did a darn good job . 
  i always imagined redbubble is closer to home , but i could be wrong . 
  shopping at welovefine ( which i have done many a time - buying the official shirts makes hasbro likes bronies more ) usually means you 'll have to wait between a week and two weeks to get your shirt . 
  just make sure you pick the right type of shipping , because the default one is $ 80 !, 
  mind . 
  blown . 
  i had a similar story . 
  plumbing going on with my toilet and for some reason the pipe from the toilet goes outside the house . 
  i was told not to flush it until `` tomorrow '' and when tomorrow came i thought it was safe and flushed away the waste that had been sitting there for a day or so was sent through the pipes to this one pipe on the outside that had nothing connected to it , so it all went flying over to the neighbours ' wall , on our fence and down the side of the house . 
  i do n't know who ended up cleaning it up . 
  all end portals take you to the same end . 
  you 're not expected to use more than one portal though because taking a second one with drop you off really far away from the dragon . 
  no , you still land on/in/near the generated end , just really far away from the obsidian pillars and the dragon . 
  one of the things i 'm a little stuck on is whether to include a coherent narrative or take the more contemporary route of a collection of monologues . 
  at the moment i 've written a monologue on russel 's teapot and another on why atheism does n't mean a lack of morals , but i 'm not sure how to string them together . 
  noted , i 'll try to stay off the high horse . 
  make sure you have `` generate structures '' turned on , or else no villages will appear . 
  initially yes , but you can find saplings inside blacksmith chests to start a tree farm . 
  finding an alternative use is not the same as `` not getting the message '' . 
  the spartan afterlife is ... new zealand ? 
  it 's just another way to play minecraft , offering an interesting and different challenge . 
  hardcore/survival flatlands is a fun way to play and quite refreshing after the well-known and formulaic traditional survival . 
  testing what ? 
  testing sounds awfully dull too . 
  sure you can use it for testing things ( whatever things those may be ) but jeb left the villages in with a rather happy-sounding comment , knowing the implications . 
  i do n't see why you 're so annoyed by this different way to play the game . 
  you should try it , it 's really quite fun . 
  but you have n't yet elaborated why other than `` flatlands is for testing '' . 
  you still have n't said what you 're meant to test for or why anything other than testing is stupid . 
  how does one obtain one of these stickers ? 
  i 'm sceptical of anything being said `` by ugandans '' . 
  i 've seen video testimonies from ugandans on both sides of the fence , to generalise them all as having one view is totally biased in favour of whoever 's writing the article . 
  more importantly , how did the truck drive there in the first place ? 
  friendship wo n't bring my parents back . 
  is n't that the entire premise for the upcoming movie ? 
  the same is true of any sitcom , animated or otherwise . 
  they 're always written so that episodes - excluding season openers/finales - make sense even if it 's your first episode or watching them randomly . 
  you just get more out of it by watching every episode !, 
  that was a different hourglass , but this does raise a good point :, 
  why do they have these giant hourglasses throughout canterlot ? 
  it must be something reeeaaally important ... [ ] ( / abwut ), 
  i tell ya , i 'm gon na keep asking of pictures of rainbow dash from pizza guys until i finally get one . 
  and then i 'm going to keep asking . 
  sent my graphics card into a frenzy and everything on the screen started flickering . 
  an optimistic outcome indeed !, 
  notch looks a bit sunburnt ... maybe sandstone would have been a better choice for his skin colour . 
  not sure where you got this screenshot , but it 's already been posted ( and is currently on the front page of / r/minecraft ) :, 
  it looks like somepony needs [ mine little pony ] ( http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/748553-123-mine-little-pony-v121/ ) !, 
  if you 're a fan of the ponies , i 'd love to recommend [ love and tolerance ] ( http://www.planetminecraft.com/texture_pack/love-and-tolerance-texture-pack/ ) . 
  if you 're not a fan of the ponies , that 's okay . 
  pretend you never read this comment . 
  after a few days of being subscribed to [ / r/getmotivated ] ( / r/getmotivated ) , i 'd have to agree . 
  and now he 's in a mental hospital :, 
  i. . . do n't know who those people are . 
  i 've got a gallery of hi-res pretty pictures i took of minecraft equestria : http://imgur.com/a/ypob5, 
  of course they were n't intended to be wallpapers , but they would certainly work . 
  especially the cloudsdale one !,

  holy moley you 're good at drawing ponies . 
  where are your wings fluttershy ? 
  party pooper . 
  only in creative mode . 
  ... i 'm not seeing it . 
  [ love & tolerance ] ( http://www.planetminecraft.com/texture_pack/love-and-tolerance-texture-pack/ ) ( a pack for bronies ) . 
  it 's a pony version of the statue of liberty , but we 've yet to come up with a good punny name . 
  `` liberpony '' does n't quite cut it . 
  the original is , but we renamed it to make it our own . 
  yes sir , the inside is a fully-furnished hotel complete with everything you 'd expect to find . 
  i should probably have made this an album and included pictures of that , but i dislike lengthy [ build ] albums . 
  if i go back on the server today i 'll grab those for you . 
  there was a bit of interest here in seeing the inside , so i made a guided tour album :, 
  we 're a public server , so you can visit it yourself by connecting to brohoof.com and typing / warp burj, 
  ( warning : it 's a brony server so you 'd better be prepared for a pony overload . ), 
  edit : [ texture pack \\ ( love & tolerance \\ ) ] ( http://www.planetminecraft.com/texture_pack/love-and-tolerance-texture-pack/ ), 
  downgrading 's not hard . 
  here 's a backdating tool : http://digiex.net/minecraft/mcvtool/, 
  have the whole server : http://www.brohoof.com/, 
  ( world downloads are available through the website . ), 
  do you take any damage at all jumping in the lava ? 
  if you get a response , you 'd better let us know !, 
  taking a trip down their rather oddly-designed website . 
  i said `` absolute moral laws do not exist '' and it said `` seriously ? '', 
  and started accusing me of supporting child molestation . 
  edit : and the kerning is so bad that it 's very hard to read the walls of text it throws at you . 
  it would be nice if they put their letters a little closer together , gosh . 
  or just hop into creative mode with [ gamemode changer ] ( http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/618470-gamemode-changer/ ) if mods are n't your thing . 
  no i ca n't , the photos icon is in the way ... 
  i never thought i 'd see the day when something mlp-related made it to the top of / r/minecraft . 
  the times , they are a-changin ' . 
  not very , but everything pony-related i 've seen tends to get pretty heavily picked on . 
  i often have to redirect the person who posted it to / r/mylittleminecraft where they 're free to post pony as much as they like .
