  you can share this with / r/mylittleminecraft !, 
  she left out `` yognau ( gh ) t '' when she said it though ... 
  maybe lewis and simon are worried that if they are ever in a podcast-recording room at the same time , everyone else will leave and they 'll be forced to record a new yogpod . 
  awesome , thanks !,

  this day just got worse !, 
  you 're better off in / r/admincraft . 
  [ zan 's minimap ] ( http://www.planetminecraft.com/mod/zans-minimap/ ) is very similar . 
  aagghhh , all these bronycon prints are getting me so excited !, 
  i 'm pretty sure most of the music in all yogscast videos comes from [machinimasound.com ] ( http://www.machinimasound.com/ ) . 
   there are about forty thousand let 's play-style videos, 
  when you do a youtube search for `` let 's play minecraft '' , there are * 1.5 million * results . 
  to say the market is over saturated at this point would be a vast understatement . 
  people are n't going to watch your let 's play for the sake of watching someone playing minecraft . 
  they want to watch someone who 's charismatic , or funny , or someone who has clever ideas . 
  there are so , so many people out there making average , slow-paced videos mumbling into their mic having not realised they 're meant to be entertaining an audience . 
  [ ] ( / a14 ) if you liked the movie , be sure to check out / r/equestriagirls !, 
  ^ ( um , only if you want to though ), 
  watching it in the proper quality was great , there were a lot of details i had n't spotted before , like when human twi sticks her hand back in the portal , it turns into a hoof . 
  not to mention hearing that opening theme in its full , groovin ' glory . 
  yeah it was , i was just backing up your point . 
  i just got back from reading this entire thing and i feel much more confident about my own social abilities . 
  [ it 's on dailymotion !, 
  ] ( http://www.dailymotion.com/playlist/x2rf9q/1 ) in three parts . 
  / r/mylittlepony keeps a link in their sidebar to [ the latest youtube version ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me3hqop_xmu ) . 
  the quality 's not the best because they had to crop it to dodge youtube 's contentid filter , but if only youtube will do , that 's the best you 'll get . 
  the appeal in fancy ghasts is that people took an existing mob , and found a way to decorate it . 
  by just building a giant ( and not particularly accurate ) recreation of your chosen mob , you 've kind of missed the point . 
  sounds like fun !, 
  alternatively , many pony designs and technologies could have been inspired by trips to the human world . 
  'cause now it 's canon that there 's a portal there ... 
  yeah , we know . 
   it 's very much deliberate and the subreddit 's been filled with posts about it for weeks . 
  [ ] ( / e14 ) hey girls , i know how we can get our cutie marks !, 
  [ ] ( / b25 ) cutie mark crusader religion founders !, 
  i 'm not familiar with the 1920s style , but it seems a bit odd to me that the whole inside is one massive room . 
  the ceilings are absurdly high ( 3 blocks is sufficient in most cases ) , and i think it would look much better if you used walls to brake down the huge spaces into smaller , separate rooms . 
  this is especially notable when it comes to the sleeping area . 
  i would hate to sleep in a bed so totally exposed like that . 
  i like the exterior a lot , though !, 
  fluttershy vs. isabelle : who can be the least assertive character in town hall ? 
  i 'd be really grateful !, 
  i just added you . 
  would you like anything in return ? 
  be on your way, 
  this is the right place for it !, 
  video/music posts here tend to struggle against all the image posts in / r/mylittlepony , so every other thursday is designated as `` no pics thursday '' . 
  you 're best off posting videos and stuff then . 
  there are other subreddits this would fit into , such as / r/mlptunes and / r/equestriagirls . 
  cross-posting is more than welcome . 
  this is n't really nsfw , but in future please remember the very first rule of the subreddit !, 
  is it [ notenoughitems ] ( http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/909223-147152-smp-chickenbones-mods/ ) ? 
  i think reddit tags it automatically if you put [ nsfw ] in the title . 
  [ ] ( / c24 ) ** dear celestia that 's a lot of colours **, 
  it supplies several videos showing the mod off . 
  like [ this one ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgyqfoedjpk ) . 
  truly worthy of / r/skyrimporn . 
  ^ ( psst , we have that actual pose here in emote form ! ), 
  it 's a spin-off movie from a tv show . 
  check the `` what this is '' part of the sidebar over there -- ,

  is someone a fan of fonejacker ? 
  i 'm the one who 's in charge of emotes around here . 
  after we started adding emotes , the first thing i did was to go to the developer of betterponymotes and ask them to add / r/equestriagirls . 
  and , well , [ here 's how that turned out ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/betterponymotes/comments/1ep1hx/requestriagirls_is_adding_emoticons/caa7pn6?context=3 ) . 
  ( apparently humans are n't ponies ?!?!? ), 
  however , you can add them manually by going into bpm 's preferences , scrolling to the bottom and adding / r/equestriagirls to the list . 
  [ this page ] ( http://rainbow.mlas1.com/ ) tells you how to access the preferences . 
  [ ] ( / eg20 ) i 'm glad you like the emotes so much . 
  there 's always more on the way !, 
  [ you were n't the first person to notice that !, 
  [ ] ( / a13 ) also this should probably be flagged as a spoiler , because [ they have their ears and tails and stuff ] ( / spoiler ) ... 
  you should share this with / r/mylittleminecraft !, 
  woah , cool !, 
  thanks for making this !, 
  the tracks are n't quite named right though , here 's the names of the songs according to the mlp wiki :, 
  * [ this strange world ] ( http://mlp.wikia.com/wiki/this_strange_world ) * ^ ( which is n't included ? 
  * [ equestria girls ] ( http://mlp.wikia.com/wiki/equestria_girls_ ( movie_song \\ ) ), 
  * [ time to come together ] ( http://mlp.wikia.com/wiki/time_to_come_together ), 
  * [ this is our big night ] ( http://mlp.wikia.com/wiki/this_is_our_big_night ), 
  * [ a friend for life ] ( http://mlp.wikia.com/wiki/a_friend_for_life ), 
  [ ] ( / b04 ) sorry for nitpicking , i am really grateful you made this !, 
  oh come now , the quality of the art on the back surely makes up for any errors on the front . 
  playing sounds is beyond the capabilities of css , i 'm afraid . 
  oh yeah you 're right , doing that only makes them show up globally but it does n't add them to the list . 
  i think the only way would be to ask the bpm developer very nicely to add that feature ( or to add / r/equestriagirls :p ) . 
  i just fixed the table so the tabs do n't jump down to the bottom when you hover over one , so it should be a bit easier to use now . 
  i think the word `` wander '' is wandering across the page . 
  [ ] ( / e04 ) me too !, 
  well , not the bronypalooza bit , but i 'm from the uk and flying out to bronycon on thursday . 
  i 'm on a panel though , so that 's kinda similar . 
  okay okay questions . 
  * did you go last year ? 
  * are you on the [ uk of equestria ] ( http://ukofequestria.co.uk/ ) ? 
  * what pony merch do you own ? 
  * have you seen/did you like * equestria girls * ? 
  * where should i start when it comes to familiarising myself with your music ? 
  purple tinker is the founder of bronycon ( and , more recently , big apple ponycon ) . 
  she 's done some really cool things , like [ give lauren faust a massive poster of the fausticorn ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=289gaejes4o ) , but she 's kinda become infamous for being a bit of a drama magnet on twitter . 
  it 's a good theory , especially considering [ what equestria girl feet actually look like ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ipjtite.png ) ...
