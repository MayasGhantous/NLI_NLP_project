  the issue is that as soon as one gets banned , a new one is made . 
  the usernames are all random letters/numbers like kh2kj222kj , so there is n't really any pattern you can follow either . 
  i think they just wandered in here , maybe they were checking / r/all/new or something . 
  be nice !, 
  it was [ a reference ] ( http://lemondemon.bandcamp.com/track/the-ultimate-showdown-of-ultimate-destiny ) !, 
  depends which one you 're thinking of at the time, 
  woah there sonny , do n't go projecting . 
  just because you do it does n't mean everyone else does . 
  it 's different if you 're actually doing it with a dog, 
  listen bud , you just feel whatever you feel in the moment and roll with it, 
  how do you what ? 
  you forgot to include a verb . 
  that map was stolen by whoever put up that video ( by which i mean they gave zero credit to its creators ) . 
  it was made by the players on the [brohoof.com ] ( http://www.brohoof.com/ ) server . 
  that particular equestria map is really really outdated now , as the project was started over completely and is looking better than ever . 
  you can find the newer map at [brohoof.com/backups] ( http://www.brohoof.com/backups ) . 
  side note , you may enjoy / r/mylittleminecraft !, 
  you 'll find some great answers to this in the [ north korean refugee ama ] ( http://redd.it/1gs1wt ) . 
  oh yeah , i get these weird minecraft glitches all the time . 
  it always pieces together random bits of stuff that had been on my screen recently . 
  really odd . 
  i hope you do n't mind if i borrow this for use as an emote on / r/equestriagirls ... 
  done , thank you !, 
  restore the fourth , apparently . 
  i guess that 's the same people behind / r/restorethefourth . 
  you do not need to attend to receive your cape ( i know previously people were giving away/selling their capes to people who wanted them more ) . 
  but a cape is n't worth the money ; if you 're gon na buy a ticket , do it for the convention . 
  the cape is just a bonus . 
  i can assure you that as an awkward 16 year-old , you will not be out of place . 
  in fact , judging from previous conventions i 've attended , that 's one of the largest demographics ... 
  `` everfree '' was the only one i could come up with . 
  new emote !, 
  new emote !, 
  yay !, 
  i hope you do n't get any cockatrices moving in . 
  yeah , i do n't see why not . 
  the cmcs are always zipping around on their own anyway , so it 's no surprise that they 're not seen with their sisters . 
  applejack is sitting with her family at the start of helping twilight win the crown though . 
  this is michelle 's 10th convention , so she 's totally used to it by now . 
  having performed on stage so many times before , she 's a natural when it comes to being in the limelight . 
  maddy , on the other hand , has only been to one convention before and it kinda shows . 
  she 's fairly quiet on the panels and seems to struggle to get a word in edgeways with all the other voice actors talking all the time . 
  i think she 's still getting used to being a star !, 
  i 've never seen anything that says eqg will be anything more than a movie ( although there will be comics ) . 
  some people got confused when it was announced that * equestria girls * would be `` airing on the hub '' , which led to speculation that it would be a series . 
  her band , hey ocean ! , has [ some concerts coming up so you can see her perform for yourself ] ( http://www.loveheyocean.com/tour/ ) !, 
  absolutely not . 
  when they come to the uk , i 'm going to do what i can to make sure a brony meetup does n't happen at one of their concerts . 
  while i love brony meetups , this is n't the place for one . 
  they 've only just started announcing european dates !, 
  there will definitely be more to come ( although i ca n't guarantee they 'll come to spain :( ) . 
  check the link i posted , they 're coming to london , bournemouth and reading ( with more to be announced !, 
   ( with more to be announced ! ), 
  cool your sour grapes , there 's hope for you yet . 
  no , apple 's pretty big on their customer service . 
  [ ] ( / eg20 ) they 're beautiful !, 
  i like it too !, 
  [ but it was n't my idea ... ] ( http://redd.it/1gy8u9 ), 
  i absolutely agree that yes , the movie has its flaws . 
  it 's riddled with plotholes ^ ( not * that * kind of plothole ) , has dodgy story arcs , boasts a shoehorned love interest and overall is based on a premise that makes lauren faust squirm . 
  the villain 's motives are questionable , the character designs lack a lot of variety , some of the jokes fall flat ... and yet i found myself giddy with excitement the whole way through . 
  while watching * equestria girls * for the first time , i found myself overcome with the same sense of wonder i had when i first watched mlp : fim . 
  the animation was gorgeous , and it seemed to have the same sort of spirit as those first few episodes of season 1 . 
  in fact , the nostalgia was so great that some moments - especially the songs - really brought a tear to my eye as i remembered why it is i like the show so much in the first place . 
  it has that brilliant , creative , warm , ultra-happy attitude , and while technically the movie was n't perfect , it had enough of that aura to leave me with a great big beaming smile at the end . 
  hasbro 's interference and attempts to dumb it down certainly left a mark , but i think the talent and ingenuity of the creators was enough to bring back the magic . 
  i 'd rate it as one of my favourite mlp things ever , but perhaps it 's because i 'm not dissecting too hard !, 
  your statue is a fake !, 
  [ the real one ] ( http://www.econ.ohio-state.edu/jhm/arch/david/david_von_michelangelo.jpg ) only has his cloth over one shoulder . 
  only because it 's much bigger !, 
  there 's some charming little ones in there , like `` burger the pony '' just above it , and `` 5 guys is wonderbolts '' in the top left . 
  yes , i 'm not trying to say `` this is why you should like the movie . '', 
  i was saying `` this is why i liked the movie , '' which i believe is the question you wanted answered . 
  the implication is that `` moon '' means `` moon cycle '' , and one moon cycle is approximately a month . 
  ( that 's why months are called months ! ), 
  30 moon cycles would be ~ 2.5 years , so it would kinda suck to be stuck in another world for all that time . 
  shh , you ca n't use that as an argument in a hyper-analysis thread !, 
  five guys is a fast food restaurant which is known for having a wall which anyone can pin stuff on . 
  they supply little pieces of card and crayons , so you can draw something and pin it on the wall . 
  this one was just down the street from bronycon ( which took place last weekend ) , so naturally lots of bronies went there and covered the thing . 
  [ ] ( / eg29 ) um , she was back at home . 
  it was just me who went to the con . 
  like 8pm on monday . 
  i was n't really sure what to do with that time , so i walked aaaaaaaall the way out of baltimore in one direction until the buildings got short and the groups sitting in car parks got sketchy-looking , then i turned back and went the other way . 
  i 'm not very good at sightseeing . 
  i was also at the bronycon fiw panel , and i do remember jenny saying that the next fiw could be the last one . 
  / u/runujhkj is n't making it up , honest !, 
  i know this is a watamote reference , but i think she looks a heck of a lot like taiga from toradora !, 
  here . 
  it 'll be up on the [ everfree network youtube channel ] ( http://www.youtube.com/user/everfreeradio/ ) before long . 
  [ right here !, 
  report them to isabelle and she 'll have a stern word with them . 
  ### aaaaaaaaa i love cats milly, 
  [ ] ( / rb20 ) ** this is amazing **, 
  no , bronycon was in baltimore !, 
  it 's always east coast . 
  i 'm the one who does the emotes here !, 
  loads of people just sent the emotes to me and i added them to the list as they came in . 
  because of the way emotes work they 're all in one big image , so if you 'd like to use them for other things you 'd have to cut them up manually first . 
  [ this is the first set ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vkkkgnn.png ) , and [ this is the second set ] ( http://i.imgur.com/cfnecju.png ) ( which is still being updated ) .
