  i 'm glad you like them !, 
  [ ] ( / flutterwink ) / r/equestriagirls is always ready to hear a new discussion if you 'd like to start one . 
  they all kind of blur into one after a while . 
  [ ] ( / ajhappy ) you should n't really buy pony shirts off red bubble , as none of them are official so none of the money goes to hasbro . 
  you should buy from [ we love fine ] ( http://www.welovefine.com/41-my-little-pony ) instead , because then hasbro sees it 's profitable to make cool merch for bronies and will continue to do so !, 
  as for toys and stuff , i like to be daring and get my merch from physical toy shops ( although gen 4 mlp stuff is a bit few and far between here in the uk ) . 
  i think it 's a funny standard to have .

   a good shot of it, 
  but ... it 's nighttime . 
  i ca n't see a thing !, 
  [ ] ( / c24 ) i 'm going to milton keynes this weekend !!, 
  let 's see if we can make this happen . 
  ^ ( btw i added this list to the / r/equestriagirls sidebar because it 's cool ), 
  just yesterday they added pixel ponies that run across the screen when you search for `` my little pony '' . 
  although that one does n't actually work for me , so i 'd knock points off for that . 
  [ ] ( / a29 ) no cadance . 
  what 've you got against the pinkest princess , youtube ? 
   the movie could appeal to a wider age range than parents might expect, 
  [ ] ( / eg26 ) you do n't say ... 
  i was considering it , , but shipping costs to the uk are pretty astronomical . 
  / r/tarastrong may be dormant , but i 'm sure it 'd love to hear your compliments for her . 
  if you 'd like to make a case , make a post in / r/betterponymotes . 
  i 've done all i can ... 
  [ ] ( / eg21 ) pony twilight dear , your front legs are * enormous * . 
  but other than that , adorable . 
  i know sticked posts can have their own css , so you could definitely do something to make the current sub of the week stand out way more if you wanted to . 
  it 's certainly cute !, 
  although it could do with, 
  1 . not being an alicorn, 
  2 . some more pastel colours, 
  although i understand if those were out of your control . 
  [ ] ( / b34 ) psst , you forgot to include a link ... 
  in case you 're wondering , this is what the baltimore five guys looked like at the end of bronycon : http://imgur.com/ordshft, 
  do you think the little advertisement i had at the top of the subreddit did much for you ? 
  i 'd be happy to put it back if it worked , but i always felt adding an ad to your subreddit was breaking some unwritten rule of subreddit moderation . 
  * eqg * leaves the uk tomorrow ( tuesday ) so i 'll put the ad back then . 
  i saw a few people wearing your sweatshirts at bronycon !, 
  * [ my little pony facebook page post ] ( https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=695270117157095&amp;set=a.417049434979166.116621.118429394841173&amp;type=1&amp;theater ), 
  * [ fighting is magic background artwork ] ( https://fbcdn-photos-d-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/1150952_10151777869947527_2097440265_n.jpg ), 
  seems real to me . 
  `` what 's that up in the sky , commander ? '', 
  `` i do n't know , private . 
  all i can make out is five sets of pig nipples . '', 
  it looks cool !, 
  although you might want to keep a bit more consistency with the shading in future - it looks a bit strange having the really defined highlights on her wings and ear , but only a soft glow on her legs . 
  [ ] ( / flutterwink ) no prob !, 
  be sure to stop by / r/mlpdrawingschool if you want to get more feedback in the future !, 
  it 's well-written , well-animated and genuinely enjoyable . 
  there is n't really much more to it than that . 
  [ ] ( / raritywut ) that ... does n't even make any sense . 
  i 'd say choose your battles . 
  there 's nothing to be gained by standing up for bronies in / r/cringepics . 
  i was a fan of / r/cringe when it was much smaller , but over time as the community grew , it became less about sharing an excruciating embarrassment with someone and more about `` hey , look at these people having fun doing something i do n't like ! '', 
  no matter how well-explained your points are , you will not be listened to and will only be put down there . 
  [ ] ( / flutterwink ) just ignore it , let them get on with it and upvote all the good stuff in / r/mylittlepony . 
  bronycon was a couple of weeks ago , and i can assure you that the vast , * vast * majority of people there were nothing at all like the brony stereotype . 
  they were outgoing , well-hygiened , conversational and unbelievably nice to be around . 
  not only that , the vendors hall was filled with the most talented artists , animators , model-makers and creators in just about every medium i have ever come across . 
  please , do n't believe stereotypes . 
  in every case , not just this one . 
  she is cosplaying as the character rainbow dash from the cartoon * my little pony : friendship is magic * . 
  [ here 's a pic . 
  ] ( http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2012/203/e/7/rainbow_dash___the_gala_dress__by_pegasus_drake-d587j8n.png ), 
  rainbow brite was a totally different show . 
  yes , `` brony '' is a gender-neutral term . 
  this was at bronycon ( or it may have been otakon , which took place at the same convention centre one week later ) . 
  i 'd like to see lyra having found herself in the same room as the * equestria girls * portal !, 
  ( psst , you can edit posts like these . ), 
  adorable !, 
  hah , you 're still checking this thread ? 
  [ ] ( / fluttershh ) i mean , so am i , but ... 
  [ ] ( / lunasad ) confirmed . 
  ### original content do not steal, 
  [ ] ( / winkiepie ) i do have bpm , and i can see the discord . 
  i 'm under the impression that the general attitude to comic sans is that the typeface itself is n't bad , the problem is people 's application of it . 
  [ ] ( / e01 ) i 'd say it 's not the perfect choice for this circumstance , but it 's not bad either . 
  aww , i would n't complain . 
  it 's for a good cause . 
  [ here , i labelled it for you . 
  you may wish to share with / r/equestriagirls !, 
   boots on hooves / bikinis on top !, 
  well , we 'd been missing the latter of those two for a while now . 
  [ ] ( / c14 ) do n't you think that 's just a tad on the harsh side ? 
  no problem !, 
  i do n't blame you , the `` knee '' on that back right leg is a really odd shape . 
  best of luck with your painting !, 
  [ ] ( / c11 ) the server has been up for 2 years , and the current version of equestria ( which is our fourth go at making it ! ), 
  has been under construction since may 2012 . 
  [ ] ( / a08 ) it 's all done by painstakingly hyper-analysing screenshots to work out where everything is in relation to everything else . 
  the number of animation inconsistencies makes it * really * hard sometimes , canterlot alone took a whole year of planning before we could even start building it ... 
  [ ] ( / a01 ) in the end it looks great , because we have such high standards for our builders to meet . 
  one of our current big projects ( which i 'm leading ) is the school from * equestria girls * . 
  [ here 's what that looks like so far !, 
  it 's not a res tag , it 's a flair . 
  i always thought the crunch sounded like you were landing on a pile of doritos . 
  do n't worry , it was all done in creative with copious amounts of worldedit , voxelsniper , worldpainter and other helpful tools . 
  you may enjoy / r/mylittleminecraft !, 
  no way , that 's so cool !, 
  mlp merch in the uk is so thin on the ground ( and g4 stuff is even thinner ) that i never would have expected this here .
