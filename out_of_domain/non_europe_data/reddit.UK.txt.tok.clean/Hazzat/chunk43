  [ ] ( / b24 ) i 'm not seeing it . 
  [ ] ( / c26 ) if if keeps up at this rate , we might get ** the actual show to air !!, 
  [ ] ( / a13 ) uh , yeah . . 
  i mean you can use it to make pretty castles and stuff , but i guess that works too ... 
  season 1 was already aired over here a while ago , but boomerang did kind of a shoddy job , with the first half of the season aired twice at lots of different times . 
  it 's safe to assume we wo n't see it on our screens again until they relinquish the broadcasting rights . 
  all these are big community projects from the [brohoof.com ] ( http://www.brohoof.com/ ) server . 
  it 's all open to visit , and if you 're a good builder you can help to build it too !, 
  i answered this in another comment , so i 'll copypaste it here :, 
   [ ] ( / c11 ) the server has been up for 2 years , and the current version of equestria ( which is our fourth go at making it ! ), 
  has been under construction since may 2012 . 
   [ ] ( / a08 ) it 's all done by painstakingly hyper-analysing screenshots to work out where everything is in relation to everything else . 
  the number of animation inconsistencies makes it * really * hard sometimes , canterlot alone took a whole year of planning before we could even start building it ... 
   [ ] ( / a01 ) in the end it looks great , because we have such high standards for our builders to meet . 
  one of our current big projects ( which i 'm leading ) is the school from * equestria girls * . 
  [ here 's what that looks like so far !, 
  it is a server !, 
  check out [brohoof.com ] ( http://www.brohoof.com/ ) for all the info . 
  [ you can download them ] ( http://www.brohoof.com/backups ) , but that 's not as fun as walking around on [ the actual server ] ( http://www.brohoof.com/ ) !, 
  if you look in other comments , you will find links to the server this was build on ( and world downloads ) !, 
  you 're always welcome back !, 
  [ ] ( / sbbook ) ` tis the byproduct of having high standards , my friend . 
  [ ] ( / c01 ) fyi , the download is not the best experience !, 
  if you log into the server , there 's warps to get around , stuff wo n't burn , decay and melt , complex portal stuff works properly ... and there 's friendly people around ( like me ! ), 
  yes , we have baltimare !, 
  the list of all the towns/locations in the equestria replica is :, 
  * sweet apple acres, 
  * everfree forest, 
  * whitetail wood, 
  * appleloosa ( & buffalo camps ), 
  * dodge junction, 
  * manehattan, 
  * baltimare, 
  * trottingham, 
  . . and outside of equestria , there is :, 
  * cloudsdale, 
  * the moon, 
  * the crystal empire, 
  * the * equestria girls * human world, 
  [ ] ( / c03 ) we 've been busy . 
  you can join the server and see all the builds without signing up on the forums . 
  you only need to sign up if you want to build anything !, 
  for the most part it 's all one world , but the * really * big stuff like cloudsdale and canterlot are separate . 
  for the most part , the terrain was made with [ worldpainter ] ( http://www.worldpainter.net/ ) , which allowed us to create terrain like the smooth , rolling hills you see in the show . 
  you 'll find all the info about getting online at [brohoof.com/info] ( http://www.brohoof.com/info ) . 
  you can find all the info at [brohoof.com/info] ( http://www.brohoof.com/info ) . 
  you need a link or two , it 's on [ this page ] ( http://www.brohoof.com/forums/forum-1/announcement-6-server-info-please-read/ ) . 
  [ ] ( / flutterwink ) we like to encourage reading of directions . 
  i 'm not so convinced , although i know some people have managed to sneak a couple of pony references in before ... ( [ 1 ] ( http://redd.it/rm2to ) , [ 2 ] ( http://redd.it/rm2to ) ), 
  of course , there 's / r/mylittleminecraft which joins the two . 
  downloading the worlds is n't ideal , as on the server there are plugins to prevent ice melting , leaves decaying , grass spreading , everything burning etc. 
  [ the server is here ] ( http://www.brohoof.com/ ) , and [ the world downloads are here ] ( http://www.brohoof.com/backups ) . 
  / r/mylittlepony and / r/mylittleminecraft ( and , if you 're feeling daring , / r/minecraft and / r/mcrenders ) are good places as long as you give credit where credit is due . 
  oops !, 
  [ here 's the second one i meant to link ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/minecraft/comments/12jrti/ive_seen_some_pretty_amazing_art_here_heres_my/ ), 
  yeah , there 's a big moonbase/city . 
  i agree , although that episode had so much that did n't fit in anywhere else . 
  there 's that scene where they find themselves running through alleyways between tightly packed houses , and there 's nowhere that looks anything like that in the aerial views of ponyville ... 
  [ ] ( / egb23 ) `` my magic !, 
  it 's not working ! '', 
  looks pretty good ( although not perfect , of course ) !, 
  if you 're looking for feedback , head to / r/mlpdrawingschool . 
  there was some talk of it , but it 's kind of implied that saddle arabia is on a separate continent to equestria , so we could n't really fit it in anywhere . 
   a community for 2 years, 
  the benefit of showing up late to the party is that there 's already a well-established community of mega-helpful art critics who can help you on your way !, 
  ... which is called / r/mcservers . 
  ( that 's kind of an important detail ! ), 
  kapp ` n , you ca n't go around saying things like that when you 're a married man !, 
  remember how when human rarity first saw spike she said `` i think with a bit of work i could make him look like a rabbit instead '' ? 
  that 's what 's happened on the right side of the frame , anyway . 
  sure , i 'd love it !, 
  i just added your friend code . 
  it 's okay !, 
  i 've had 1 million bells set aside for a crown for a while . 
  it 's not , kind of by definition . 
  you 're using 3d blocks to make a 2d image . 
  on my way !, 
  those are in ponyspawn2 . 
  if you want feedback on your oc , head to / r/ratemyoc !, 
  oh c'mon buddy , do n't complain about downvotes . 
  it looks childish . 
  [ ] ( / b34 ) i reeeaaaally dislike the use of the word `` hater '' . 
  it 's the sort of thing the justin bieber fanbase would say . 
  it kind of implies that `` our side '' is always in the right and no one who disagrees matters now they 've been labelled . 
  it 's silly and immature . 
  is it necessary to give them a name ? 
  they 're just people with opinions , although with perhaps a more verbose way of expressing them . 
  in this case you could have said `` angry comments '' or `` abusive comments '' , but a mentality of ` them and us ' is generally to be avoided . 
  you are forgiven . 
  i have a ramshackle floor i 'm willing to part with !, 
  i 'd like the lucky black cat , please . 
  why not just use the [ forgot password button on minecraft.net ] ( http://minecraft.net/login ) ? 
  as of 1.6 , your password is not stored on your computer at all . 
  i will !, 
  i miss her , i have n't seen her in ages . 
  it was a fair fight . 
  i 'd love a glass top table and have a ton of nintendo items i do n't want . 
  anything in particular you 're looking for ? 
  i 'll just add you . 
  gates are open ...
