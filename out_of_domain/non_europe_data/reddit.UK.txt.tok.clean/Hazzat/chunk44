  i 'll reopen them to make sure i did n't actually pick `` nearby town '' . 
  open again !, 
  [ ] ( / eg21 ) you have much to learn , my dear . 
  please share with / r/equestriagirls !, 
  [ ] ( / c10 ) on / r/nevertoomanymlpsubs , everyone wins !, 
  it 's no secret that the equestria girls dolls are in direct competition with mattel 's monster high line , [ which looks like this ] ( http://i01.i.aliimg.com/wsphoto/v0/739950131_1/with-box-and-accessory-free-shipping-font-b-monster-b-font-font-b-high-b-font.jpg ) . 
  oops , i forgot to suggest anything . 
  the subreddit is looking good !, 
  i think the non-sticked links could be a bit smaller and something other than blue to help the current subreddit of the week stand out even more . 
  [ ] ( / eg17 ) oh man , you 're right !, 
  i do n't know much about monster high . 
  what i do know is that they have a subreddit : / r/monsterhigh . 
  not at all !, 
  i 'm an admin on a server where we have large-scale creative worlds which people like to download . 
  we have to include a warning on a download page that opening the worlds in single player will cause ice to melt etc. , so these gamerules would be super handy for both us and everyone who wants to play with our worlds . 
  that 's less than ideal , really . 
  ice ( which is a very pretty material ) would become totally unusable for most circumstances , and we would n't be able to have a dirt path through the forest and so on . 
  all i 'm really asking for here is more flexibility , so the option is there to build even more cool and creative things in vanilla . 
  wow , this is pretty !, 
  excellent work . 
  george foreman , it 's a type of grill, 
  but ... 
  i do n't do any of those things !, 
  the picture is a frame from the movie * hot fuzz * , so it 's part of the joke . 
  every now and then one slips through . 
  i 'm really impressed at how well / r/mylittlepony keeps them out most of the time . 
  [ ] ( / cadence `` well . '' ), 
  if you 're looking for feedback , go to / r/mlpdrawingschool !, 
  you forgot to include a link !, 
  and also [ viva happy has already been posted here ] ( http://redd.it/1j36jj ) ... 
  they 're not even bears !, 
  you 'll find a few more * equestria girls * fans at / r/equestriagirls !, 
  is there a list of all the places in australia it 's playing ? 
  if so , i can add it to the / r/equestriagirls sidebar . 
  you are looking in the wrong place . 
  go to / r/mcservers . 
  the majority of youtube videos get downvoted because they 're the same boring `` watch me do the same old let 's play '' we 've all seen a billion times . 
  videos of interesting creations ( especially redstone ones ) tend to make it through , and deservedly so . 
  i do n't think there are people downvoting each and every youtube video on principle . 
  i think if they start to become a problem , we can count on the mods to enforce a rule against them . 
  it 's just that there has n't really been any need for such a rule because the community is so good at keeping them out . 
  ### hot damn this is funky, 
  [ ] ( / c30 ) i wish there was enough content like this to warrant the existence of a / r/mylittlevocaloid . 
  / r/vocaloid welcomes you !, 
  this is on ( ion ) believable, 
  i 've got one for sale over here if that other guy 's offer falls through . 
  sure , just give me a minute to open the gates . 
  we are open !, 
  i 'd like to think that anyone with prices that high would have the courtesy to make a post about it ... 
  putting a fine on improper use of an emergency services number would discourage people from using it , even in a real emergency . 
  i feel it would endanger more lives than it would save . 
  yeah !, 
  you 'd been gone so long i thought you were n't coming back . 
  i 'll open my gate for a while again . 
  yes please i would like to sell some turnips in your town, 
  i 'll keep the gates open for a bit longer , but i recommend you sell your turnips [ in this town instead ] ( http://redd.it/1kqvy6 ) . 
  much bigger profits to be made there !, 
  sounds like you 'd get along swimmingly with [ this guy ] ( http://redd.it/1krhje ) . 
  i have both those already , but i 'd still be more than happy enough to give you the fossils . 
  i 'm around all day , so remind me again when you 're available !, 
  i really appreciate your advertising of this place , and the consistent stream of content you bring !, 
  lem me tell ya , if you had n't been doing the advertising , it would have been me . 
  * all your use of emotes has reminded me i was gon na add more but i forgot to do it aaaaaaaaa *, 
  [ ] ( / egb04 ) i 've seen some weird fanart from this movie , but this ... 
  it 's not special , it happens all the time . 
  [ you 'd be surprised at how many low-upvoted comments are gilded . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/all/comments/gilded ), 
  what did you make ? 
  annoying server messages ? 
  the custom font ? 
  the minecraft server list ? 
  i do !, 
  i have n't got rid of anything yet . 
  give me a minute or two to add you . 
  i have the dragon suit too , but thanks for offering . 
  i 'll be right over . 
  [ ] ( / eg12 ) if you 'd like to pester typhos by making yet another post making the case for * eqg * in / r/betterponymotes , go ahead ... 
  there 's a link in the sidebar to the version on dailymotion , which is n't likely to get taken down anytime soon - , 
  you can also download it from [ yayponies ] ( http://yayponies.eu ) . 
  there 's a mystery here , and i must solve it !, 
  [ ] ( / ppawe ) just look at those trees ... 
  this is beautiful . 
   like , are there actual ornate shirt/pants/whatever or certain clothes with other names fall into a theme ? 
  yep !, 
  normally you can tell by just looking , but if you want to make doubly sure you can look it up on moridb . 
  [ here 's the list of all the ornate clothes !, 
  ] ( http://moridb.com/items/search?category=&amp;q=&amp;obtained=&amp;interior=&amp;fashion=ornate ), 
  i gave 'em to someone else , sorry !, 
  i had n't heard from you can did n't want to keep the other person waiting . 
  certainly !, 
  i 'll just add you and open up . 
  we 're open !, 
  excuse the look , i 'm in the process of getting all the haircuts and official tops are lucky today . 
  sounds great !, 
  i 'll let you know when / u/stop _ squark has shown up and done their thing . 
  we 're good !, 
  come on over when you 're ready . 
  i 'd like to point out that if you take the pachysaurus skull as well , you 'll have a whole pachysaurus . 
  yep !, 
  i just added you , the gates will be open in a minute or two .
