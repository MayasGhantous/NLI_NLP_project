  on my way !, 
  well it spurred me into adding a new emote to the subreddit just so i could correctly express my response . 
  it 's yours !, 
  i just added you and will open my gates momentarily . 
  edit : open !, 
  do n't worry , i think it 's funny . 
  it was just a bit unexpected , that 's all !, 
  1 ) i run a little empire of not-very-popular subreddits , including :, 
  * / r/brickfilms, 
  * / r/mylittleminecraft, 
  * / r/equestriagirls ( which is actually sorta popular ), 
  and i made the css for them all . 
  i 've also moderating bustling internet forums for 4 years , so i know how the moderation game goes . 
  2 ) i 've been following this subreddit pretty much from the very beginning , back when it was still meant to be a place for sharing what you had to drink today . 
  i made a css theme and also tried to claim it via / r/redditrequest without realising it was already taken . 
  i never heard back on the ( now-dismantled ) css theme after i sent it in . 
  i think this community can be really grea - er , * fantastic * and i really want to see it flourish . 
  i started the [ sips catchphrase cache ] ( http://redd.it/1iwqhq ) just to help out the people posting a bit more , and i upvote stuff a heck of a lot here . 
  ( i know how important upvotes are for growing a subreddit . ), 
  3 ) i think the new guidelines are perfect , exactly what the sub needed . 
  right now i do n't think there are any problems / r/sips needs to address ( although the header image could do with being cleaned out a bit , it 's been a long time since we last saw paint sniffer and co. . . ), 
  4 ) i 'm in the uk , and i do n't really have much better to do than sit on reddit all day . 
  5 ) weekdays , weekends , week-middles , bank holidays , birthdays , weddings and christenings , i do it all . 
  6 ) / r/actrade is my addiction . 
  sabertooth torso ? 
  yep !, 
  i just added you , come over when you 're ready . 
  edit : i just dug up a sabertooth skull if you 'd like that too, 
  it is open !, 
  i reopened the gates now . 
  try again !, 
  i got to sing this at bronycon !, 
  i had the ears on and everything . 
  sips city and the surrounding landscape !, 
  it 's tumblr . 
  tumblr people are crazy . 
  [ ] ( / eg08 ) and when that happens , we just add more humans !, 
  probably need to include a link there , brogri\u00f1o . 
  [ baby !,

  holy duck feathers , it 's been a long time since i last saw a dolan reference . 
  / r/minecraft likes to get really high and mighty when it comes to kids who like youtubers . 
  [ ] ( / c06 ) there 's always bits in the banana stand !, 
  yay , thank you !, 
  i 'll add you and head over asap . 
  you 're not showing up ... are you sure you did n't pick nearby town or best friends only ? 
  they can never quite get his hair right . 
  well , now it 's the most downvoted post of all time . 
  i guess people are just seeing how far they can make it go . 
  [ ] ( / a04 ) she 's beautiful . 
  [ ] ( / c04 ) i guess that explains the little downvote brigade earlier . 
  please consider cross-posting to / r/mylittleminecraft !,

   a word or phrase open to two interpretations , one of which is usually risqu\u00e9 or indecent . 
  this does n't seem very risqu\u00e9 to me ... 
  i think you 're forgetting the point of snapshots . 
  yes , i will take her !, 
  i have n't seen her in * ages * . 
  we are open !, 
  snapshots do n't exist for us to get sneaky previews , they 're for mojang to get feedback and bug reports . 
  if what 's being worked on is n't ready for testing yet , there 's no need for a snapshot . 
  i know all the teasers can be annoying and we 'd all love to know what 's coming up soon , but remember the snapshots are n't for our benefit . 
  when the snapshot is released is not really of any concern for us , because they 're not for us . 
  if we have no news , so what ? 
  when mojang needs to release a snapshot , they will . 
  but evidently they do n't need one right now . 
  [ right here . 
  i believe the general rule for sharing adventure maps is * `` no pics , no clicks '' * . 
  you may wish to provide some more info . 
  [ ] ( / c21 ) what exactly am i looking at . 
  it 's a miracle there are any sheep still left alive . 
  especially considering they could n't even breed until beta 1.8 . 
  well , it 's not hurting anyone . 
  you may enjoy / r/mylittleminecraft !, 
  [ ] ( / wahaha ) adorable !, 
  i do n't know for sure why it 's unlisted , but it may have something to do with [ this little mishap ] ( http://i.imgur.com/9twhsqt.jpg ) ... 
  holy cow , this is * awesome * .
