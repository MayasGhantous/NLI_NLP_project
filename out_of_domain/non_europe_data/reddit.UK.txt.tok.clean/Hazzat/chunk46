  i ca n't wait to see her reaction . 
  under some circumstances that 's justified , i think . 
  if your name is offensive or contains a slur , it 's understandable that the server mods/admins would n't want it appearing in their chat . 
  sure !, 
  can i come to yours ? 
  all i need is an anklyo torso and iguanodon tail and my fossil exhibit is complete !, 
  how does 20,000 for the pair sound ? 
  i had a long `` please wait '' when trying to add you , too !, 
  strange . 
  certainly !, 
  i 'm in the middle of another trade right now so if you could just hold on for a minute that 'd be lovely . 
  well it says you 're on my friends list now . 
  i 'm not seeing you on porter 's list ... :(, 
  ( golly , it 's just issue after issue today , huh . ), 
  nope . 
  this comment right here is the trend i want to die out . 
  stop just quoting things , and for goodness ' sake stop upvoting them . 
  because i 've found the expression on an emote is more important than the character !, 
  no one uses the flash , granny smith or big mac ones because their expressions are n't very interesting . 
  if there 's a derpy vector/high-quality screenshot where she 's doing something interesting , i 'll certainly add it . 
  make a vector ( or take a really high quality screenshot that may as well be a vector ) , shrink it to 70x70 and message it directly to me or to / r/equestriagirls via modmail . 
  then i 'll do all the technical bit of actually adding it !, 
  i love parry gripp !!, 
  i 've met him irl and stuff and he 's really cool . 
  ohhhh gaaahhhhhhhhh my hearrrrt, 
  it melted, 
   each train still has a driver as nobody would trust a driverless train . 
  i 'm not entirely sure how true that is , given that the dlr ( docklands light railway ) line is completely driverless , and no one seems to mind . 
  yeah !, 
  i made [ a music video ] ( http://youtu.be/x6djxyr6b9g ) for one of his songs , and he got it played at the santa barbara film festival , so i got to fly out there and see it happen . 
  it was pretty rad . 
  lovely , not lonely . 
  i 'm fairly sure p means `` producer '' . 
  [ a huge number ] ( http://vocaloid.wikia.com/wiki/special:search?search=p&amp;fulltext=search&amp;ab=46%2c51 ) of vocaloid song-makers have p at the end of their name . 
  nope , they 're real . 
  it 's run by a teacher teaching english in japan , and they get their classes to make rage comics to help them learn the language . 
  iron golems hold and drop roses because they are a reference to [ the robots ] ( http://leekworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/2_7robotlaputa.jpg ) from the movie * laputa : castle in the sky * . 
  while i agree that 95 % of minecraft let 's plays are stupid and unentertaining , i feel this was an unsuccessful parody that ending up being as dumb as the videos it was trying to make fun of . 
  if you 're trying to start a pun thread , i want you to stop right there . 
  but if you are generally expressing a hope that more bees can be saved , [ there was a great / r/youshouldknow ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/youshouldknow/comments/1hrsyx/ysk_that_lots_of_bees_are_dying_that_is_bad_there/ ) post listing all the things you can do to help . 
  i think we need a biologist here . 
  paging / u/unidan !, 
  sometimes when two villagers bump into each other , they 'll start having a conversation . 
  you can listen in on it by trying to talk to one of them . 
  it 's not something you can force , it just happens . 
  i thought a .341 might have been some sort of qualification ( like a 2:1 ) , which would have been terrible for her . 
   what happened to redditors deciding what appears on the front page . 
  time and time again , it 's been proven that hands-off moderation and `` letting the votes decide '' results in a subreddit filled with low-quality , lowest-common-denominator posts . 
  i 've found that those with the tightest moderation have the best content . 
  ( see : / r/polandball ), 
  i agree that this should really be a guideline , but i do n't believe the mods should be encouraged to lay off . 
   please upvote for visibility . 
  i 'd like to take issue with that bit , given [ this post made by the admins recently ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/1jr429/moderators_you_can_now_sticky_a_selfpost_to_the/ ) . 
   ... please please * please * stop asking users to `` upvote for visibility '' for your announcements . 
  asking for votes is one of the very few things against [ the overall rules of reddit ] ( http://www.reddit.com/rules ) , so it sets a really terrible example for users and makes them think it 's okay to ask for votes too when they feel like their submissions are `` extra important '' . 
  you should share this with / r/mylittleminecraft !, 
  set yourself a big-scale project , either a really cool build or an adventure map or something . 
  minecraft is only fun if you set yourself an objective . 
  if you prefer survival to creative ( each to their own ) , hold out for 1.7 , where exploring is about to get a heck of a lot more interesting . 
  there 's certainly a balance to be struck . 
  i think / r/gaming does a ruddy good job of keeping quality as high as it can ( it was n't me who brought them up  ) and it 's wrong to say hands-off does n't work across the board , but in relatively small and more focussed subs - this one included - quality control is generally necessary to keep it healthy . 
  this proposal is n't about quality control though , so it 's kinda irrelevant . 
  each student has their own account , so it 's not like all the points are getting funneled into one place . 
  [ ] ( / c14 ) i 'm guessing that 's a friendly way of referring to people who play minecraft . 
  / r/mcservers , friend . 
  everyone who has ever bought minecraft at any point is able to play every version that was ever realeased , using the new launcher . 
  i think that 's what you 're asking . 
  nice try smart ass , but [ both ` spelt ' and ` spelled ' are correct ] ( http://grammarist.com/spelling/spelled-spelt/ ) ( although one is more correct than the other depending on where you are ) . 
  this is infinitely relatable . 
  what really helps me crack the cycle is [ selfcontrol ] ( http://selfcontrolapp.com/ ) ( mac ) or [ cold turkey ] ( http://getcoldturkey.com/ ) ( pc ) . 
  of course , the challenge is making sure you have something to fill up all the new free time , or else you 'll just find new ways to waste it . 
  i do n't so much have an issue with reaction gifs , but i do have an issue with people upvoting them . 
  the upvote button means `` this contributes to the discussion '' and reaction gifs are pretty much the exact opposite of that . 
  dude , you really need to learn to cut to the chase in your videos . 
  if i 'm a new viewer to your channel , i do n't want to have to sit through over three minutes of rambling before you actually show what the device does . 
  that 's no fun . 
  mojang looked to implement optifine at one point , but apparently the optifine developers [ do not want that to happen ] ( https://twitter.com/dinnerbone/status/352885081112719363 ) . 
  / r/self is kinda the epitome of that . 
  others have done a fine job of answering your question directly , so i 'll just supplement them . 
  as you 're a student , you might be interested in the [ bronystudy ] ( http://www.bronystudy.com/ ) , which is an ongoing series of surveys and analyses by actual phds ( real doctors ! ) . 
  they 've put forward some interesting findings , and their research might help you . 
  [ ] ( / e29 ) i have dust in my eye , i swear . 
  / r/drawforme, 
  i 'm ogre the moon about it, 
  this is fantastic absolutely 100 % perfect good job . 
  yay , thank you !, 
  i 'll add you and be over asap . 
  for more of the same , you might like / r/mylittleminecraft !, 
  this sort of post is better suited to / r/minecraftrelated , not here . 
  wow , that looks cool !, 
  but i have no idea how they plan to keep it up to date . 
  minecraft news is a never ending flow . 
  basically your character just kinda wiggles their head around , before throwing their arms out sideways with a big smile . 
  it looks even stranger when done whilst swimming . 
  thank you !, 
  i 'll be over shortly . 
  i do n't think it has a name , and i do n't even think it 's been released . 
  it 's by / u/pythosblaze , and [ here is their most recent post about it ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/minecraft/comments/1ikxjl/as_promised_a_progress_update_on_textures_for_my/ ) . 
  but not fast enough !, 
  [ they changed their minds .
