  ] ( https://twitter.com/dinnerbone/status/375606455036309505 ) new terrain is included . 
  see that 's funny , because [ jeb 's game studio is called oxeye games ] ( http://www.oxeyegames.com/ ) . 
  what does the super secret settings button do ? 
  i 'm pretty sure that 's deliberate . 
  look up pictures of `` mesa plateau '' . 
  i did n't build that one , i built the one at / warp eqg !, 
  ( which still is n't finished ... ), 
  take me , take me !, 
  noon pacific is in 2 and a half hours , right ? 
  i 'll do my best to remember . 
  i remembered !, 
  i made a special `` 1000 + wondercolts ! '', 
  celebration image for the occasion , but the computer it 's on is out of action !, 
  i 'll see if i can make a new one . 
  [ ] ( / eg25 ) welcome to the ~ ~ herd ~ ~ clique !, 
  half a million bells ' worth of turnips and the prices here are a measly 57 . 
  i 'd like to take you up on your offer please !, 
  surely the nuttiness is part of the cuteness ? 
  because it was a [ pony car ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pony_car ) !, 
  the minecraft wiki has [ a great tutorial ] ( http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/tutorials/setting_up_a_server ) on how to set up your own private server . 
  / r/adoptmyvillager is the place for this . 
  [ read the rules ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/minecraft/wiki/rules ) , buddy . 
  you 'd better do something nice with that place . 
  you brought it into the world , now it 's your job to nurture it . 
  as far as i can tell , the average feeling held is `` it 's not perfect , but it 's still a lot of fun . '', 
  you should check out / r/equestriagirls !, 
  so banned from subreddit now, 
  not really mlp : fim related , this is better suited to the / r/mlplounge . 
  [ you did !, 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/equestriagirls/comments/1mueu2/thoroughly_analyzing_equestria_girls_by_digibrony/ ), 
  they meant that [ it was already posted ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/equestriagirls/comments/1mueu2/thoroughly_analyzing_equestria_girls_by_digibrony/ ) !, 
  [ ] ( / eg24 ) we forgive you though . 
  [ ] ( / egb14 ) these are fantastic !, 
  it 's a british phrase . 
  `` 180-odd '' ( or any number - odd ) means `` roughly 180 '' . 
  i thought `` sherk '' was the name of the dance . 
  [ ] ( / a38 ) dryb0nes is a bot !, 
  honeydewyeayea , of course . 
  preferably the 10-hour version , but i guess the regular one would work too . 
  try / r/ratemyoc . 
  she says who and why at 0:28 . 
  that was really lovely , and must have taken a lot of work . 
  i 'd like to see this posted again on an npt so it stands a chance . 
  no pics thursday, 
  it 's okay , i forgive you . 
  there is no conflict you 're being trolled again . 
  remember , when it comes to being trolled , the only way to win is not to play . 
  press it , shrek can never be dreck, 
  either that or people might just be downvoting because they think just quoting movies is kind of inane . 
  [ this video ] ( http://youtu.be/pa7e9s6nk0e ) , from 2:28 . 
  / r/brogres , shrek is never dreck, 
  damn , nina is really good at drawing butts . 
  see / r/brogres for more . 
  i think it 's funny that he 's `` the brodyquest guy '' nowadays . 
  he used to be `` the potter puppet pals '' guy . 
   for when the great scorer * comes to write against your name * he marks not that ( not sure about this last word ) * won but how you played the game *, 
  surely this is talking about dr. friedlander 's psychiatric report ? 
  neil gets around . 
  once upon a time he was `` the ultimate showdown of ultimate destiny '' guy . 
  he 's done an awesome job at maintaining a youtube audience for so long . 
  if you like lego animation , be sure to stop by / r/brickfilms . 
  it 's only small right now , but it 's the home for lego stop-motion on reddit . 
  for a guy whose arms are made of bones , he sure is muscly . 
  the aim of the phonebloks project was to catch the attention of phone manufacturers . 
  that 's exactly what happened , and this is the next step . 
   motorola will also be working with the creator of the phonebloks concept dave hakkens on the ara project . 
  you can post spoilers for stuff , just tag them as appropriate . 
  ( see the sidebar . ), 
  [ ] ( / eg00 ) ** they all have exactly the same mouth **, 
   why even make it ? 
  i doubt it was designed by a person . 
  there are companies that just automatically generate random phrases based on what 's popular , plonk it in a template ( like keep calm and carry on ) and put the `` design '' on a hundred different items . 
  i remember amazon got in a bit of trouble a while back because one of these systems came up with something quite offensive , but i ca n't remember what it was . 
  i guess that makes this crappy algorithm design , rather than crappy graphic design . 
  moon chavs ? 
  that was n't what i was thinking of , but it seems this sort of incident has happened more than once . 
  for a convention !, 
  although as the convention takes place at the end of october it can double up as a halloween costume . 
  it 's a `` paint your own mane '' set . 
  you colour in the white area yourself . 
  aww , bethesda and mojang not only kissed and made up , but got married and had a baby . 
  that 's sipsco dirt factory , not moonquest ya dingus . 
  [ ] ( / a01 ) my one wish is that gak comes back . 
  my god , he 's cosplaying as himself . 
  even better , you can [ stop youtube remembering your history altogether ] ( http://lifehacker.com/5886904/how-to-prevent-youtube-from-keeping-a-record-of-the-videos-you-watch ) . 
  the added bonus is that they ca n't offer you recommended videos anymore . 
  it was n't without its flaws , but the fact that it hyped me up to a giddy joy , blasted me with a wave of nostalgia and brought a tear to my eye meant i loved loved loved it . 
  there are more discussions like this over at / r/equestriagirls !, 
  press esc and hit the super secret settings button a few times until it looks right . 
  this is n't really the place for such posts ...

  [ cr1tikal : the animated adventure !, 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzuslolz1ve ), 
  i always thought the writing around the edge referred to dr. friedlander 's psychiatric report . 
  this is what sm\u00e9agol , the site admin , had to say about it :, 
   i do n't control the hosting , though it 's possible the database got too large for the host 's limit or something . 
  i 've contacted schlaeps , we 'll try to get it sorted out . 
  edit : it 's fixed !, 
  the site is back up .
