  i can assure you it was a joke . 
  you 're not the first person who 's been asking whether it was real !, 
  [ this is where you can buy one !, 
  ] ( http://www.jinx.com/p/minecraft_creeper_face_mug.html ), 
  you should look into the [ kicvids minecraft app ] ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bluwolf.vids.family.mcraft ) !, 
  it 's an app that allows the user to watch only minecraft videos which have been pre-approved as being child-friendly . 
  there 's one for [ lego animations ] ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bluwolf.vids.family.lego ) too if they 're into that . 
  next thing we 'll need to add yogscast jason to the timeline !, 
  boddypen . 
  / r/mlpdrawingschool will always be there for you !, 
  wrong jason . 
  oh , the poor thing !, 
  many of your questions can be answered on [ the staff page of the yogscast website ] ( http://www.yogscast.com/about/staff ) , but you 're gon na have to be more specific if you want specific answers . 
  kim = mandrew, 
  there was a little kid who named his channel ` yogscast jason ' . 
  he made a lot of videos trying to convince people he was part of the yogscast ( eg . 
  recording himself reading out a fake message from `` bluexephos '' ) . 
  he shot to fame recently when sips commented on one of his videos saying `` welcome aboard ! '', 
  [ the channel has since been shut down . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/user/minecraft1830 ), 
  [ ] ( / abthis ) and everything in-between !, 
  you know you can save comments by using [ res ] ( http://redditenhancementsuite.com ) , [ reddit gold ] ( http://www.reddit.com/gold/about ) , or just bookmarking it in your browser , right ? 
  it is spam . 
  downvote , click report and post their account to / r/reportthespammers if you 're feeling vigilant . 
  [ ] ( / eg08 ) join the campaign to get / r/equestriagirls emotes in bpm !, 
  [ ] ( / eg17 ) uh , well , the reason they were rejected is because humans are n't ponies , and the creator thinks that allowing emotes of * equestria girls * humans goes against his quality standards . 
  also he did n't like * eqg * at all , which i suspect has more to do with it . 
  all we can really do is post in / r/betterponymotes asking him to change his mind , but several people have already tried that and got nowhere . 
  i wish i did too . 
  are you okay ? 
  do we need to fetch help ? 
  what the heck , that 's a tongue ? 
  i just thought it was a pretty scarf !, 
  [ link to facebook page ] ( https://www.facebook.com/ogreloads ), 
  i look forward to seeing what you can layer on top of your premise, 
  a cold day too . 
  i know some yogs have mentioned it in passing in their videos , but even if they had n't it 's kind of a given . 
  they 're a big deal and everyone ( both participating and watching ) loves them . 
  you can share this with / r/yogscast too !, 
  [ let us all revisit that moment . 
  if 3ds is an option , i 'd love to see everyone 's animal crossing towns !, 
  i swear there 's someone downvoting every post on this subreddit as soon as it appears , and it gets me right mad it does laddie . 
  [ ] ( / rspikepushy ) well , to be honest , they have n't done a very good job of taking our money ... 
  blanket statements like `` no one watches tv anymore '' are totally untrue , and i have no doubt that the bronies have given its ratings a boost . 
  ( it is the most popular show on the hub ever ... ), 
  the rest of it all comes from merch . 
  as well as the usual pony toy stuff , they have definitely been making an effort to appeal to the older fanbase . 
  [ t-shirts and other clothing items ] ( http://www.welovefine.com/162-my-little-pony-tshirts ) , [ comic books ] ( http://shop.idwpublishing.com/comics/series/my-little-pony.html ) , the totally awesome [ elements of harmony guidebook ] ( http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16032630-the-elements-of-harmony ) are all things little girls would n't really be interested in . 
  so hasbro are trying to get some products out there that appeal to bronies . 
  it 's just taken them kind of a long time to get round to it . 
  looks good to me !, 
  white ocs are easy to pull off because there 's very little worrying about getting just the right saturation , and it looks good with just about any mane colour . 
  dude , i think you need to learn to cut to the chase in your videos . 
  over a minute of preamble fluff before the tests start really is unnecessary and just dull . 
  you could have jumped straight into the tests and played them side by side and it would have been much more interesting to watch . 
  keep it snappy !, 
  the faded glyph looks to me like a crashed ufo . 
  could that be a clue pointing to the crashed ufo in the ocean ? 
  the answer may surprise you !, 
  ### tag your spoilers !!, 
  be sure to stop by / r/mylittleminecraft !, 
  `` where 's the jetpack '' ? 
  [ mcp ] ( http://mcp.ocean-labs.de/ ) - the tool pretty much all modders use to make mods - has not yet been updated to 1.7 . 
  the modmakers are all just stuck twiddling their thumbs until that happens . 
  i get the feeling they know already , and are keeping a close eye on our efforts . 
  i did work experience at sony a few years ago with the team working on playstation home , and there was one guy whose job it was to read forums all day and keep tabs on what the community was doing and saying . 
  with the importance of social media to companies having increased dramatically since then , i 'm sure there are people at rockstar who are watching very carefully . 
  what a bizarre story . 
  it seems the stone only became notable because people started calling it so . 
  i think there 's something very british about everyone just agreeing with that and not wanting to cause a fuss . 
  a while ago i made [ a whole bunch of aliens ] ( http://imgur.com/a/vcl9c ) for / r/vocaloid . 
  perhaps they could come in handy ? 
  that was one helluva review . 
  spot on , i think you 're totally right . 
  absolutely awesome . 
  i love the direction you took . 
  most yogscast music nowadays comes from [audiomicro.com ] ( http://www.audiomicro.com/ ) . 
  i 've done a bit of searching around and have n't been able to find this particular tune though ... 
  [ i did it !, 
  ] ( https://twitter.com/hazzat/status/402021723496652800 ) let 's see what happens . 
  [ bug reports go here !, 
  ] ( https://mojang.atlassian.net/browse/mc ), 
  nope , at least not on the larger channels . 
  / u/lewisxephos said in a reddit comment a while ago ( which i ca n't find now ) that they use audiomicro . 
  if you look in the sidebar , you 'll notice a [ biiiig list of minecraft subreddits ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/minecraft/wiki/faq#wiki_other_subreddits ) . 
  perhaps you 'll find what you 're looking for there . 
  i think 2013 was the year sips really came into his own . 
  skyrim , simcity , do n't starve and game dev tycoon were all golden . 
  also when he got killed by that pigman in skyblock . 
  [ ] ( / c16 ) no no no you ca n't just spring the spirited away soundtrack on people without warning ... ohhh maaaan . 
  i had n't been on gametee in a while , and i just got totally blown away by [ rythian 's merch ] ( http://www.gametee.co.uk/category/rythian-official ) . 
  that stuff is so cool . 
  this deserves its own post !, 
  you bring up some cool ideas . 
  is this really a suggestion for minecraft , or just for texture pack makers ? 
  i remember a mojangster once toying with the idea of including several default texture packs , but i guess nothing ever really came of it . 
  in the sidebar , there 's a link to an [ aesthetic building guide ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/minecraft/comments/qmndk/the_gigantic_guide_for_building/ ) with is a compilation of the best tutorials posted here . 
  apple bloom 's red hair makes her a fine teto . 
  hah , i like that she has a hairband thingy around her tail .
