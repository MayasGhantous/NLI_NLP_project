  can you show us where it is on the map so we can help investigate ? 
  exactly what i needed , thank you .

  [ ] ( / egb10 ) here 's [ something ] ( http://redd.it/1jwujk ) i wrote a while ago in / r/equestriagirls explaining why i love this movie so much , despite it being flawed beyond belief . 
   i absolutely agree that yes , the movie has its flaws . 
  it 's riddled with plotholes ^ ( not * that * kind of plothole ) , has dodgy story arcs , boasts a shoehorned love interest and overall is based on a premise that makes lauren faust squirm . 
  the villain 's motives are questionable , the character designs lack a lot of variety , some of the jokes fall flat ... and yet i found myself giddy with excitement the whole way through . 
   while watching * equestria girls * for the first time , i found myself overcome with the same sense of wonder i had when i first watched mlp : fim . 
  the animation was gorgeous , and it seemed to have the same sort of spirit as those first few episodes of season 1 . 
  in fact , the nostalgia was so great that some moments - especially the songs - really brought a tear to my eye as i remembered why it is i like the show so much in the first place . 
  it has that brilliant , creative , warm , ultra-happy attitude , and while technically the movie was n't perfect , it had enough of that aura to leave me with a great big beaming smile at the end . 
   hasbro 's interference and attempts to dumb it down certainly left a mark , but i think the talent and ingenuity of the creators was enough to bring back the magic . 
  i 'd rate it as one of my favourite mlp things ever , but perhaps it 's because i 'm not dissecting too hard !, 
  [ ] ( / egb13 ) ^ ( ps : do n't forget to add / r/equestriagirls as a custom subreddit in betterponymotes ! ), 
  it just takes a quick youtube search to find [ a region-unlocked version of the trailer ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpjpawhx21i ) . 
  but yeah , it 's dumb to make this available only to the us . 
  especially after you grab so many people 's interest with a title like that . 
  [ ] ( / b36 ) the day a new episode is set to air , [ equestria daily ] ( http://www.equestriadaily.com/ ) makes a big post listing all the streams you can use to watch the episode ( and , later , all the places it can be found on youtube ) .

  should you gather some nice pictures to be turned into emotes , that 'd cut the job time in half . 
  70x70 looks lovely for keeping it clean ( it 's a standard i adhere to for / r/equestriagirls emotes ) , but i get the feeling many potential emotes here might benefit from being taller than they are wide ... 
  i 'll let you make the call depending on what you find .

  for a time , `` the narwhal bacons at midnight '' was meant to be a secret phrase you could use to find redditors irl , perhaps by dropping it into conversation . 
  it did n't last long before people labelled it `` cringy '' .

  ### bow before the authority, 
  yeah , and what 's wrong with informing mobile users that you have an app that probably makes content easier to navigate ? 
  this just seems like whining . 
  i think the misnomer is part of the charm . 
  my favourite take on it is that it * is * a sceptre , but it 's named the cane/twilicane . 
  i do n't know what the secret is . 
  / r/equestriagirls took off quickly too . 
  capturing the zeitgeist , i guess ? 
  people will be more likely to flock to something if they 're already interested in it . 
  [ ] ( / tc00 ) yes !, 
  we need ** more ** cane subreddits !,
