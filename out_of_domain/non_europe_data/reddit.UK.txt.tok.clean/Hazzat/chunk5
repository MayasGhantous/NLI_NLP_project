  spiffing picture what what , but i regret to inform you that we do not utilise the term `` subway '' here in the united kingdom . 
  indeed , we refer to it merely as `` the underground '' . 
  that 's so strange , i once put my trousers on one day to find a rather sizeable squashed spider at the bottom of one of the pockets . 
  i spent the rest of the day rather scared and wondering how it got there . 
  yes it does . 
  i believe snowballs actually damage the dragon significantly too ( endermen being weak to water and all that ) , although i could be wrong . 
  i 'm pretty sure it worked when i tested it . 
  the first drawing is captioned `` ceci n'est pas une pipe '' , which is french for `` this is not a pipe '' . 
  which it why it is silly for the next person to describe it as a pipe . 
  suddenly ponies . 
  i do n't subscribe to [ / r/pics ] ( / r/pics ) because [ / r/all ] ( / r/all ) is [ / r/pics ] ( / r/pics ) . 
  minecraft 3ds . 
  just imagine how cool that would be . 
  in response to a question about cadence , she said that she was heavily involved in the creation of the finale 's plot ( although she did n't make cadence an alicorn ... ) . 
  but other than that , yeah she 's barely been involved at all this season . 
  he came from flickr . 
  it 's a pony-inspired pack called love & tolerance :, 
  saw this and thought of lost . 
  if you 're looking for feedback , you 'll want to stop by [ / r/mlpdrawingschool ] ( / r/mlpdrawingschool ) !, 
  i do n't know why , but this made me laugh very very loudly . 
  blackgryph0n ( whose song this is ) sent me the instrumental version of this for karaoke purposes a day or two ago . 
  not sure how acceptable it would be to distribute it though ... 
  i went looking , but the question on his tumblr seems to have been removed . 
  this was where it was :, 
  i think the ~ 200 comments of people talking about it on this post should affirm it though :, 
  well , it 's their own building . 
  an alteration , maybe ? 
  all you have to do is take a cup of flour ... 
  at artist friend of mine said to me recently :, 
  `` art is anything with serves no other purpose . 
  then it is design . '', 
  i would love to read that article . 
  that 's one short zombie !, 
  got really far away and really high up , then used optifine 's zoom feature to make it fill the screen . 
  the only thing it 's missing is some glamorous shaders . 
  welp , til . 
  thanks for correcting !, 
  his fingers holding the gun make it look like his mouth has extended past the side of this head . 
  saw this and immediately thought of [ poopoo bridge ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrmko7vxewo ) . 
  [ he said yes !, 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uw4nognhkn4 ), 
  looks more like nigel thornberry to me . 
  that 's one hella nose . 
  i chuckled . 
  jeb _ = redstonehelper, 
  i was intruiged , so i did some research . 
  while i did n't find why he was renamed waldo , you 'd be surprised at just how many names he does have across the globe :, 
  this looks terrible . 
  just ... just let go already . 
  you know what , i think i 'll turn that quote into a wallpaper for myself . 
  maybe replace `` the television '' with `` minecraft '' . 
  hand-delivered ? 
  do n't worry , yam ends in a few hours an it 'll all be over . 
  it was going to end in half an hour , but they just extended it by another day . 
  this will never be over . 
  oh do n't worry , the rest of the world has exactly the same stuff . 
  no , if you turn your screen brightness up and look at the very right hand side of the screen you can see what appears to be a new ore . 
  edit : excess words . 
  what if i told you you can press f2 to take a screenshot in-game ? 
  a much more pressing question is how on earth they can climb ladders . 
  exactly !, 
  i got the `` met 100 miis in one day '' achievement , i was so happy . 
  i think this is my favourite . 
  there is no one who ca n't relate . 
  `` enjoy '' is n't quite the right word ... 
  you 'll have to travel far away to somewhere you have n't been before to generate new chunks , and only there will you find emerald . 
  better get prepared w , start crafting those rails . 
  the [ sarcmark ] ( http://02d9656.netsoljsp.com/sarcmark/modules/user/commonfiles/loadhome.do ) was kind of a flop . 
  fortunately i know google . 
  the sarcmark was someone 's `` brilliant '' idea to make a sarcasm punctuation mark , but for some reason they decided to charge $ 2 for it so no one ever used it . 
  [ there 's a mod for that . 
  ] ( http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/379925-125-matmos-r12-environmental-sound-atmosphere-simulator/ ), 
  and the charming fellow who submitted this translation has been barred from submitting any more . 
  y u no submit this stuff to [ the wiki 's bug list ] ( http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/known_bugs/version_12w22a ) ? 
  ... common sense . 
  she 's just misunderstood !, 
  translations are crowdsourced using [ this crowdin project ] ( http://crowdin.net/project/minecraft ) . 
  anyone can submit a translation and they are voted up and down , but no one from mojang can check its accuracy because they do n't speak korean/afrikaans/bulgarian / whatever . 
  heinous inaccuracies ( intentional or otherwise ) often slip through and are only revealed after the update has been released and people notice this stuff . 
  now here 's an artist i wish i 'd known about sooner . 
  but can you collect rainwater in the desert when it does rain there ? 
  f+f 3 does exactly that . 
  `` umiiverse '' feels like a brand name . 
  `` miiverse '' is a word you wo n't feel embarrassed about when you say it out loud . 
  i found the iwata 's slow , yet understandable english rather relaxing . 
  plus you know there 's going to be a giggle just around the corner the next time he says a word with l or r in it . 
  it 's not a different type of block that shows up when you make a new world , it 's just a cosmetic change that makes all grass blocks ( that are sitting on grass blocks ) appear to have grass on the side of them . 
  you can turn it on and off . 
  i like you too !, 
  is n't this just `` not sure if trolling , or just stupid '' rephrased ? 
  what part of the minecraft community are you from ? 
  seems more fitting for / r/minecraftseeds, 
  i recall one of the mojang folks saying they wanted this , but implementing looping sounds would involve a rehash of the sound engine . 
  something we 've never seen before . 
  there 's so many pony servers out there now that do exactly the same thing , there 's no point for a lot of them to exist . 
  take a different , interesting angle and you 're bound to get people flocking to play . 
  minecraft 3ds . 
  tell me that would n't be incredible . 
  you and me both !, 
  i was worried i 'd be the only brit .
