  in / r/thecane , all our emotes are named correctly . 
  you may also wish to share this with / r/thecane . 
  did you stop by / r/thecane yet ? 
  [ ] ( / c03 ) aww , i 'm flattered !, 
  i 've never been taught how to do it , i just took codecademy 's html/css course one day and started experimenting after that . 
  my previous works include / r/brogres and / r/equestriagirls , and i learned a lot in making those . 
  other than that , it 's just a case of studying other people 's graphic/web design to work out what makes it look good . 
  if you 've managed to figure out how on earth reddit flairs work , you 're doing really well . 
  if you ever need help with anything , just ask !, 
  [ with the right tools ... ] ( http://gifsound.com/?gif=http%3a%2f%2fi.imgur.com%2fi74cveo.jpg&amp;sound=http%3a%2f%2fwww.youtube.com%2fwatch%3fv%3d4om1rqkpiji&amp;start=0 ), 
  [ ] ( / tc00 ) ** ` allo ` allo ` allo , what 's goin on here then ? 
  [ ] ( / tc24 ) ** `` scepters '' you say ? 
  [ ] ( / tc08 ) ** it 's off to the dungeons with that one i 'm afraid **, 
  indeed , but / u/fighterjet2 was quoting the sidebar of / r/thecane . 
  it does n't spin because it 's not in betterponymotes .

  this is the culmination of 9 months of desperation for something to make fun of ( and me staying up to 3am twice to get the subreddit looking pretty , lol ) . 
  loads of people are trying to talk about it right now , but they 're all limited to ` [ ] ( / scepter ) ` . 
  scepter \u2260 sceptre, 
  he had better . 
  [ ] ( / lunasad ) i have no idea . 
  people are just fickle sometimes . 
  ### this day , we have been graced by the voice of god, 
  [ ] ( / tc26 ) i could n't wait , so i collected some ( and had plenty sent to me ) and made a whole bunch of emoticanes myself . 
  if you * really * think we need more , send 'em in anyway !, 
  you may find you like / r/thecane . 
  [ ] ( / karmacane ) i swear i just put my head in my hands and laughed hysterically . 
  [ ] ( / twicane ) `` nothing to see here ! '', 
  [ ] ( / wildcane ) `` just us canes ! '', 
  [ ] ( / twicane ) `` move along now ! '', 
  [ ] ( / wildcane ) `` cane jokes are funny ! '', 
  [ ] ( / twicane ) `` ha ha ha ! '', 
  [ i found it on derpibooru !, 
  ] ( http://derpibooru.org/482994?scope=scpef7a1df7a62edd532b24a709a9232b987d3c5c7eb ), 
  scrolling through the '' [ twilight scepter ] ( http://derpibooru.org/tags/twilight+scepter ) '' tag on there is a wild ride . 
  but we can go so much further !, 
  [ ] ( / tc15 ) absolutely !, 
  anything cane-related is welcome , artwork especially so . 
  remember if you wan na contact the mods of a subreddit directly , you can [ send a modmail ] ( http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2fthecane ) !, 
  `` slash '' is british slang for `` pee '', 
  i 'm not sure who in their right mind would choose anything but a metric ton of layers . 
  [ ] ( / b15 ) try telling that to / r/thecane . 
  this is just screaming / r/hailcorporate , is n't it ? 
  then i shall have all 2,000 . 
  that way at least one of us gets to have a good time . 
  [ ] ( / raricane ) that 's the excuse i 've been using to get around the rule . 
  praise british english , the one true english !, 
  spike mistakes twilight for a cane . 
  in your dreams !, 
  [ ] ( / tc23 ) she is your cane . 
  [ well , it 's not quite asscoin ... ] ( https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=307419.0 ), 
  it became a subreddit somewhere in that process too . 
  that * speechless * film was excellent !, 
  is there a sunset one anywhere ? 
  i did n't come across one on my search , which is why there is n't an emoticane of her ... 
  i give this fifteen yogstars, 
  youtube has a live comment stream , but reddit turned it off for some reason . 
  what can i say ? 
  i see a sub with potential and ca n't help but dress it up to the nines . 
  bpm does n't let you search for emotes from custom subreddits . 
  yeah , if you want to look up eqgs you have to come back here i 'm afraid . 
  if you 'd like a `` search for custom emotes '' feature to be added , try asking in / r/betterponymotes ... 
  [ ] ( / ppshrug ) typhos gave several reasons about why he did n't want to add eqg emotes , mainly based on `` quality '' , and the fact that all subs have to be about ponies ( and apparently / r/equestriagirls is not ) . 
  however , i 'm pretty sure it 's just because [ he did n't like the movie ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/betterponymotes/comments/1k5iny/request_add_requestriagirls/cblog0l ) more than anything else . 
  i like to think of winning the crown as this noble and impossible end goal , towards which we all must strive . 
  like world peace , or curing all diseases , or something . 
  * [ to dream , the impossible dream ... ] ( http://youtu.be/c6ybgl73q1g ) *, 
  after * do n't mine at night * comes out , i plan on adding emotes to / r/mylittleminecraft . 
  you 're just gon na love / r/thecane . 
  it should show up in this subreddit ( as long as you have subreddit styles turned on ) , but if you want it to show up in bpm everywhere [ you need to add this subreddit manually ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/thecane/comments/1rpv4o/tutorial_how_to_add_emoticanes_to_betterponymotes/ ) . 
  so that the emotes themselves would show up across the site !, 
  if you had n't added / r/equestriagirls , if you tried to use eqg emotes in any other subreddit they would not show up . 
  it just looks like another graffiti tag . 
  there are loads of different ones all over the place and there 's nothing really to suggest that this one is special . 
  the thing about finding stuff in game files is that , in general , it * proves * that stuff is there to find , but does n't actually help us find it . 
  if anything , it 's good for keeping morale up by showing us that something 's still out there . 
  you try telling that to / r/thecane . 
  [ ] ( / tc16 ) ** cutie mark crusader troubleshooters !, 
  can you see the rainbow dash cane in [ this comment ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/betterponymotes/comments/1rhrlc/request_rthecane_in_the_name_of_her_majestys/cdp6itq ) ? 
  are you 100 % sure you spelled `` thecane '' right ? 
  is the issue just that you ca n't search for canes when you click the 'em otes ' button ? 
  please share with / r/thecane !, 
  ( \\ im so embarrassed,

  it can take a long time , sure , but it 's just following a template .

  does n't rhyme ? 
  ohhhhh laddie , you 've done it now, 
  we 'll smack ye right between the onions, 
  brogrea is latin for `` brogres '' .
