  as the designer here , i thank you for your kind words . 
  may shrek look favourably upon you and your kin . 
  there 's plenty more in / r/stopgirl . 
  a few years ago , my younger brother ( aged ~ 13 at the time ) learned of azerbaijan while watching eurovision . 
  he thought the name was funny and started saying it a lot . 
  his friend group at school started calling themselves the azerbaijanis , and he declared himself the king of them . 
  he still has n't * quite * got over it . 
  [ bronyville ] ( http://www.bronyshow.com/ ) have been doing it for aaaages . 
  i have n't listened in a long time , but i remember them being really good . 
  [ of the cane ] ( http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=198406034 ) !, 
  i 've just started skyrim for the first time and am veeeery tempted to install it . 
  i dunno if there 's a bugs bunny mod out there , although that would be pretty cool . 
  it 's `` australia '' said loudly and in a thick australian accent . 
  what do you do there ? 
  [ ] ( / b34 ) * psst * , you get in trouble for using out-of-sub emotes if you add nothing else in your comment ... 
  i was at bronycon 2013 and did n't need a separate ticket to enter bronypalooza . 
  i know some cons ( like buck ) work that way , though . 
  [ ] ( / tc00 ) you ca n't have too much of / r/thecane . 
  this was is n't ogre yet . 
  war *, 
  [ here 's a fan-made map of the moonquest server ] ( https://gusx2w.dm2302.livefilestore.com/y2p5hfih5jick9ou973yq4ef75wcqp71dlryu1zyp-blsjdam3o7_prf-brgxejfjxqgfffj1r6ph2jigwm4ans42rp6w4s80u6nz25fxdfowi/yogmap_expedition4.png?psid=1 ) , painstakingly crafted by taking screenshots of the minimap in the corner of the screen . 
  you can see just how close sipsco and j.a.f.f.a. 
  are there . 
  silences are n't awkward until someone decides it 's awkward . 
  there was a subreddit for this , but it never quite caught on ... 
  ** / r/mcwt ** ( minecraft world trade ), 
  [ ] ( / egb16 ) oh my goooosh this is cute . 
  nothing 's changed , it 's still the buzzing hive of creativity it always was . 
  if you hang around certain subreddits or forums the `` dae cringy fedora brony '' rhetoric shows up a lot ( here 's looking at / r/cringepics ) , but it 's absolutely not true . 
  i went to the past two bronycons , and i wo n't deny that there were quite a few overweight , poorly-shaven men wearing fedoras there , but they were by no means the majority . 
  places like / r/cringepics like to promote that stereotype because doing so gets you easy street cred and internet points . 
  [ ] ( / flutterwink ) i left bronycon 2013 with a warm glow around me unlike anything i 'd ever experienced . 
  for 3 days i had been surrounded by nothing but creativity , incredible talent , friendships and celebrations . 
  that 's what the mlp fandom is all about , and do n't let anyone tell you otherwise . 
  i have / u/quantumgiraffe tagged as `` steals minecraft renders '' . 
  so i 'm certain they 're already aware of it ( and they have no intention to give credit to the creator ) . 
  do n't forget about the official minecraft books !, 
  you might want to consider the minecraft annual 2014 , or the minecraft redstone handbook . 
  [ ] ( / lunacane ) no suns here , only canes . 
  the minecraft beginner 's handbook is for beginners and would n't interest your friend much , but i flicked through the annual when i found it in a comic book store and it was really interesting . 
  it has biographies of each of the developers , interviews with notable youtubers , building guides and more . 
  it 's certainly aimed at the more dedicated player . 
  [ ] ( / twicane ) you should share this with / r/thecane !, 
  this sounds awfully similar to / r/shitredditgilds ... 
  i copypasted it straight out of / r/cancerous :p, 
  try putting two line breaks after each line , instead of just one . 
  i did work experience at sony a few years ago with the team working on playstation home , and there was one guy whose job it was to read forums all day and keep tabs on what the community was doing and saying . 
  with the importance of social media to companies having increased dramatically since then , i 'm sure there are people at rockstar who are watching us very carefully . 
  hmm , i get the feeling someone did n't actually get [ the gif 's reference ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byzvveuzsbo ) ... 
  not as far as i know , but whenever there 's a new one it gets posted to / r/yogscast . 
  so keep an eye on there and search for `` map '' every now and again . 
  [ ] ( / abcane ) no one likes twist . 
  [ ] ( / wonderwink ) much better . 
  soi will rise again ... ; _ ;, 
  if you 're looking to learn , be sure to stop by / r/mlpdrawingschool !, 
  try / r/mlpdrawingschool !, 
  the colours and the sunset itself are very pretty , but the feather being there feels a little forced . 
  did you find it like that , or did you stick it in the sand yourself ? 
  [ ] ( / lunacane ) huzzah , the cane has been ~ ~ doubled ~ ~ ~ ~ tripled ~ ~ ~ ~ quadrupled ~ ~ duplicated ex ^ p ^ o ^ n ^ e ^ n ^ i ^ a ^ l ^ l ^ y. . . 
  i 've added pretty much every cane that exists as an emote . 
  there 's only a few that are out there that are missing ( eg cadance ) . 
  it looks to me like he 's walking up a path ( 2 lines below his feet ) to a house ( the squiggle to the left of his head ) . 
  that would lend credence to the theory that it 's not a guy with a jetpack , but a hiker . 
  [ ] ( / c25 ) you made me jump . 
  for a moment there i thought we had a rival . 
  [ ] ( / frosting ) mmmm , textless version ... 
  server advertising goes in / r/mcservers !, 
  [ ] ( / a07 ) i believe the term is `` dubtrot '' . 
  i do n't think your sentiment is against the general feelings of reddit . 
  whenever i see someone write this they get downvoted as far they can go . 
  not 1.8 , that would be silly . 
  tomorrow is 1.7.3 . 
  it 's almost like they do n't want people to see their movie !, 
  [ ] ( / tc19 ) they did n't initially , [ i had to give a little nudge in the right direction ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/thecane/comments/1s234f/caneperial_march_xpost_from_rmylittlegifsounds/cdt98ss ) . 
  [ ] ( / c01 ) it was proven fairly early on in the fandom that [ applejack is made of dark matter ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muvfidujxrg#t=252 ) ... 
  [ ] ( / ppshrug ) you found villagers in a village , who 'd - a thunk it . 
  well , those are my monitor dimensions . 
  i usually keep the window smaller though for the sake of multitasking , but i made it nice and big to take the screenshot . 
  [ ] ( / b24 ) you did that again . 
  why are you doing that . 
  it was the first pony thing i ever watched ( and i got very confused as a result ) . 
  it was made back in a time before the concept of `` lol dae cringe '' had taken root , which was a wonderful time to be alive . 
  somezing like [ zis ] ( http://i29.photobucket.com/albums/c283/omegasigma/tumblr_mwt35ttfqa1qf9djko1_500_zpsdf85f7ff.png ) ? 
  [ ] ( / rajhip ) aye , but it says right here in these commandments :, 
   referring to the cane as a `` scepter '' is heresy of the highest order . 
  nothing , it 's just making a funny face . 
  whenever someone posts `` hey , should n't we try this ? '', 
  i ca n't help but want to say back `` try it yourself ! '', 
  throwing ideas out there is good , but nowhere near as helpful as actually putting it into action . 
  plus if you do find something , there 's more internet points in it for you . 
  hear all your favourite fluttershy catchphrases !, 
  including :, 
  and , of course, 
  yep , it was released as a poster in walmart ages ago . 
  [ ] ( / sbbook ) hardcore analysts of mlp geography will know that it 's not very accurate , but it 's certainly pretty . 
  the most glaring error is that in the cutie mark chronicles , [ applejack gazes back towards ponyville as the sun rises ] ( http://static2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20110822214235/mlp/images/f/fc/sad_filly_applejack_s1e23.png ) . 
  the fact that she is facing the sunrise means she is looking east , and manehattan must be in the west of ponyville . 
  the map places manehattan in the east . 
  [ ] ( / a33 ) and people say we analyse this show too much !, 
  [ ] ( / b36 ) heck yeah , i 've been so hyped for this !,
