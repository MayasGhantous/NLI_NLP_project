  this movie features a ton of references to my [ love & tolerance texture pack ] ( http://www.planetminecraft.com/texture_pack/love-and-tolerance-texture-pack/ ) , which i got so excited about . 
  it 's nothing short of flattering to have someone like jan base their work on it . 
  bonus shout out to / r/mylittleminecraft !, 
  i 've been hyped for this because the art style is based heavily on my very own minecraft texture pack , [ love & tolerance ] ( http://www.planetminecraft.com/texture_pack/love-and-tolerance-texture-pack/ ) . 
  [ ] ( / flutterwink ) if you like pony minecraft be sure to check out / r/mylittleminecraft !, 
  planet minecraft is pretty notorious for going down a lot . 
  nothing i can do about it i 'm afraid . 
  [ ] ( / wonderwink ) [minelittlepony.com ] ( http://www.minelittlepony.com ), 
  yeah !, 
  when fighting is magic got taken down we said we 'd replace those paintings with original ones just in case , but all the artists we asked to do it never quite finished the job . 
  so the pony paintings will probably be in there for a while yet !, 
  this is a statue of princess celestia from the tv show * my little pony : friendship is magic * . 
  more pics of her in / r/celestia . 
  [ ] ( / b32 ) silly martin , sleeping through the episode !, 
  ** how long has carl sagan been hiding in this ad without me noticing **, 
  [ ] ( / ppohmygosh ) holy sweet mother of cane those were the funniest puns i 've ever heard, 
  / r/thecane welcomes you !, 
  [ ] ( / ppshrug ) i do have a much higher-res version of this , but i could n't upload it anywhere ( it was 9mb ) . 
  [ ] ( / ppcane ) `` i think you 're pretty dumb too rainbow dash ! '', 
  1.7.3 just came out , you might be waiting a little longer . 
  [ ] ( / a03 ) i wish to refer you to the commandments listed in the sidebar of / r/thecane . 
  [ ] ( / twicane ) a non-believer , i see !, 
  [ ] ( / raincane ) we 'll convert you yet !, 
  [ ] ( / celicane ) hail the cane !, 
  [ ] ( / lunacane ) hail the cane !, 
  [ ] ( / ppoops ) oops , my bad !, 
  the [ minecraft coder pack ] ( http://mcp.ocean-labs.de/ ) , which is the tool most modmakers use to make mods , has not been completely updated for 1.7 yet . 
  everyone is waiting on that . 
  [ ] ( / raindaww ) d'awww . 
  you wo n't get any closer than that i 'm afraid . 
  the only other one nearby is bronycon in baltimore . 
  * the phrasing is [ a reference ] ( http://yogscast.wikia.com/wiki/creeper_voice ) to youtube let 's - player network the yogscast , although i do n't think the reference is intentional . 
  * it 's not funny . 
  [ ] ( / c18 ) you may wish to share this with / r/thecane . 
  it 's hard to believe for some people , but there are actually grandmas outside the united states . 
  [ ] ( / twicane ) i wonder how many of you have noticed what we changed the name of the `` moderators '' sidebar box to . 
  the issue with that is that a locked chest would have to be indestructible to prevent people getting at the contents . 
  i 'm sure we 'd rather not give people the ability to place unbreakable blocks . 
  they are actually the same style shoes , not just the same colour ... 
  [ here 's the source . 
  ] ( http://fav.me/d6f9ag1 ) it might not quite be hi-res enough to print though ... 
  [ ] ( / suspicioustwi ) i 'm gon na need a blingee logo on that . 
  that 's some smart thinkin ' . 
  [ we 'd known about equestrian keyboards for a while ] ( http://static4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120402131156/mlp/images/1/10/foals_working_s2e23.png ) , but i never put two and two ^ ( and two ) together . 
  * wander over yonder, 
  * gravity falls, 
  * adventure time, 
  * bravest warriors, 
  and , when it 's finished :, 
  * bee and puppycat, 
  those should keep you going for a while !, 
  [ ] ( / hmmm ) i ca n't help but feel that this is a reference to something . 
  also , / r/thecane . 
  but ... 
  [ ] ( / rreallyshy ) i 'd like to be a tree . 
  alas , i do not . 
  although [ bravest warriors ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpdoscudq_0&amp;list=pl2dcnkn8hawspwgn9h2ggm4z0t6b0ysvd ) and [ bee and puppycat ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=log_utlxh58 ) are ( legally ) on youtube because they 're professionally-made webseries . 
  you got downvoted two times . 
  ** how do you feeeeel **, 
  / r/pics bans superimposed text . 
  i do n't think that quote means he was literally looking to create an empire , but to create something of his own instead of just helping out with someone else 's idea . 
  that 's a philosophy i can get behind . 
   i dunno if this is an official mojang thing or not, 
  it 's not . 
  if it was , it would have the mojang logo on it and would be promoted by mojang employees . 
  it seems interesting , but they have n't given nearly enough information to pique my interest . 
  you ca n't just post a paragraph of coded text and expect people to go crazy for it . 
  there 's nothing wrong with borrowing your favourite [ sips-isms ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/sips/wiki/sipsisms ) , but if you 're making your own content it just seems like a shame if your stuff is n't all your own . 
  just be yourself . 
  [ ] ( / danceshy ) [ and those are the parts of a pony !, 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsx7jdvpg_g ), 
  it 's green light for streetpass , blue is for spotpass . 
  i took my 3ds to tokyo once , and the amount of streetpasses i got there was nuts . 
  i was getting 20-30 people a day , and i swear the pok\u00e9mon center there is the streetpass capital of the world . 
  inside it , i could n't keep track of how many i was getting because it immediately filled up again as soon as i cleared it out . 
  i could have just sat in there all day . 
  i love streetpass . 
  it 's a store that sells nothing but pok\u00e9mon merchandise . 
  pok\u00e9mon plushies , t-shirts , hats , trading cards , stationery , figures , board games , instant noodles ... 
  it 's surprisingly hard to find good pictures of it , [ but here 's a nice blog post ] ( http://pokejungle.net/2013/05/20/pokemon-center-tokyo/ ) in which the writer recounts their experience . 
  is this in the uk ? 
  because here in the londonish area it 's been unbelievably misty all day . 
  [ ] ( / b01 ) hey there were all those posts on the front page about the shanghai smog a while ago ... what if it 's spreading !, 
   it will be $ 30, 
  [ ] ( / tc09 ) the cane is worth so little ? 
  no amount of money in the world would be enough to match the glory of the cane !, 
  ( is my way of saying i 'm a cheapskate :| ), 
   just hoping that it does n't go the same way as the voltz series, 
  what happened with voltz ? 
  it ended because it reached its natural conclusion , and it would n't really have been funny to keep it going . 
  they did n't stop it because they forgot about it . 
  i have no doubt that there 's more space program on the way , but with all the games sips and sjin have been playing lately it looks like they might be struggling to fit it in amongst the other stuff !, 
  send this to / r/thecane !, 
  you could always check [ the sub 's traffic stats ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/mylittlepony/about/traffic/ ) , even though they do n't go back * that * far . 
  it does seem quieter , especially during the off-peak hours which is when the 6-24 hours old stuff stays on / new . 
  but because the community is so dedicated , there 's still more than enough going down ( and the cccc is going well , i hear ) . 
  [ ] ( / twicane ) i ca n't wait for the next instalment !, 
  if you want to hashtag in a reddit comment , you need to put a backslash in front of it . 
  alright , i 'll meet you halfway . 
  let 's say it * is * a scepter , but it 's * called * the cane .
