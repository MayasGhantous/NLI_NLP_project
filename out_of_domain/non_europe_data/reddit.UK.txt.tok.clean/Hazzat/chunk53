  i 'm an avid frequenter of the / r/mylittlepony new queue and yeah , high standards are enforced . 
  there was [ a post in / r/technology recently ] ( http://redd.it/1siiiw ) which broke down the voting algorithm and showed that a post that receives a downvote as its first vote is pretty much doomed to never be seen . 
  that 's okay for a larger subreddit where new content comes thick and fast , but for smaller ones like those i run ( the most active being / r/thecane and / r/equestriagirls ) it 's kind of a worry . 
  and that 's why i upvote absolutely * everything * that comes through all of them . 
  baby subreddits need lots of upvotes to grow big and strong !, 
  [ here 's the greatest example of a post here that was tragically , damningly downvoted . 
  [ ] ( / wandercane ) just an experiment to see if it affects anything . 
  i 'm all for finding ways of promoting a new subreddit without having to spam comments of relevant submissions , which i 'm sure can get annoying for some people . 
  there also exists / r/megamegalounge and / r/megamegamegalounge for people who were gilded in the previous tiers . 
  i stayed up to 3am twice making this css theme , i wan na make sure people see it . 
  i had a similar dilemma trying to get / r/equestriagirls off the ground ( with the only way to grab attentions being to fill comments sections with advertising ) . 
  running subreddits is a fun hobby and reddit advertising is inexpensive , so i decided to give it a go and see what happens . 
  * we 're no cane-gers to loooove ~ *, 
  [ ] ( / karmacane ) ** heresyyyyyyyyy !!!!!, 
  first thing you 're gon na wan na do is get yourself a template to make your life a bit easier . 
  [ here 's some . 
  now , if you want to make it show-accurate , you 'll need to enter the magical world of * vector art * . 
  for this , you 'll probably want [ inkscape ] ( http://inkscape.org/en/ ) ( or [ ponyscape ] ( http://fav.me/d5tvs4f ) ) as they are freeee and very good . 
  i do n't think me explaining how to vector is gon na do much good , so stop by / r/mlpvectors , check out [ their tutorials ] ( http://redd.it/zhoq7 ) and start learning !, 
  the alternative to vectoring would just be to use a brush tool or something , but that would require a * very * steady hand to look right and would probably come out looking a bit sloppy compared to the clean line of a vector . 
  i guess it depends how much work you want to put in for your friend . 
  [ here 's the direct link to the ad . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/comments/1ry040/hail_to_the_cane/ ), 
  [ ] ( / c11 ) the idea behind buying ad space is trying it as an alternative to spamming comments . 
  i do n't think there 's anything particularly wrong with spamming comments ( hey , it worked for / r/equestriagirls ) but i guess it can get annoying for some people , so it 'll be interesting to see how well this works by comparison . 
  reddit advertising is cheap !, 
  i 'll report back my findings when it 's done , but in the meantime [ / r/thecane traffic stats are public ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/thecane/about/traffic/ ) so you can check for yourself if anything happened after the ad went up on friday . 
  [ ] ( / lunasad ) as far as i know there is n't a handy database of pony soundbytes . 
  [ kyrospawn ] ( http://www.youtube.com/user/kyrospawn/videos ) was the guy who uploaded clips from the show for mainly reaction video purposes , but stopped at the end of season 2 . 
  so if you 're looking for clips from the first two seasons , their channel is a good place to go . 
  ponyscape is a derivative of inkscape made by some pro-active bronies who were getting impatient waiting for the next inkscape update , so they added their own features . 
  [ this post ] ( http://redd.it/19sxvj ) has a nice introduction to its unique features . 
  sonds like you need some [ selfcontrol ] ( http://selfcontrolapp.com/ ) . 
  super mario 3d world , they 're inside a toad 's house . 
  [ ] ( / flutterwink ) you 're welcome to try and get / r/thescepter off the ground . 
  [ cold turkey !, 
  [ ] ( / e08 ) yes it 's okay , but i do n't think you 've given enough detail for anyone to be able to help you ... 
  what kind of pony has two ears ? 
  down the rabbit hole we go !, 
  if it 's your home ip , that 's not safe at all . 
  you run the risk of your home being ddos 'd , and your location can be tracked easily . 
  we spent a grand total of $ 10 !, 
  oh no i totally forgot we were meant to be promoting them back . 
  i just added them to the sidebar in nice bold letters . 
  i 'll look into it . 
  [ sips says he is not the special guest ] ( https://twitter.com/sips_/status/412490729647534080 ), 
  yeah , i think they want a picture of a dragonborn head on the end of the cane . 
  it would n't be the most outlandish one we 've seen ... 
  the reference cane in the sidebar comes from [ here ] ( http://sta.sh/01n5wblm8sgk ) , so maybe if you ask the artist nicely they can share their svg . 
  in their tongue he is dovahcane , [ dragon staff !, 
  it almost implies / r/sips has 3 million subscribers . 
  we 're not far off , we 'll get there any day now . 
  i really wanted a sidebar ad , but i could not work out how to get one . 
  the [ advertise ] ( http://www.reddit.com/ad_inq/ ) link at the bottom of every reddit page only lets you make a little ad for the top of the page . 
  absolutely nothing . 
  the juxtaposition of two unrelated things is meant to be funny . 
  i can help you by pointing towards the [ official guide ] ( http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette ) on how to vote :, 
   * ** vote . 
  ** if you think something contributes to conversation , upvote it . 
  if you think it does not contribute to the subreddit it is posted in or is off-topic in a particular community , downvote it . 
  [ ] ( / flutterwhat ) i could have just googled it ? 
  it looks like sidebar ads go out to all of reddit though , and you ca n't target them . 
  so i think it might get lost on many people and would probably drive in a fair amount of unwanted traffic . 
  which i think is a real shame . 
  controversial opinions are always more fun . 
  in practice , upvote/downvote arrows act as `` i want to see more/less of this '' . 
  if puns and movie quotes get lots of points , more people will post them . 
  if informed discussion gets them , more people will post that . 
  [ the big guy himself ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/sips/comments/1t5v3h/dear_buds_a_holiday_message_from_one_heck_of_a/ ) said that skyrim episodes take more time to edit than other series ( got ta cut out all the times he 's accidentally killed uthgerd , right ? ), 
  and as a result we wo n't be seeing much of it until the new year . 
  there are specific levels that require one person to be manipulating the level with the gamepad , but in most levels you get to choose whether you want to do that or jump around with your friend . 
  aside from one weekend when there was a buy-one-get-one-free offer because notch was getting married , minecraft is never on offer . 
  eh , i think it 's the picture resolution combined with jpeginess that makes it blurry . 
  but yeah , i 'm pretty sure those are all stars . 
  [ ] ( / b24 ) what is it with you guys ? 
  [ ] ( / trixcane ) the great and powerful trixie recommends / r/thecane . 
  [ ] ( / wonderwink ) i 'm flattered !, 
  i think i struck [ a nice middleground ] ( http://www.reddit.com/comments/1ry040/hail_to_the_cane/ce0pk9m?context=3 ) between the cane vs. scepter camps . 
  i know !, 
  ... is also great !, 
  i 'm not sure exactly , i think that dinnerbone guy has something to do with it . 
  a week is a long time to wait for such a thing !, 
  i should n't have scrolled this far down . 
  everyone 's being a jerk to everyone else because they like/don ' t like something . 
  they found a really tall birch tree . 
  you appear to be having difficulty skinning with the mine little pony mod . 
  you might wish to [ read the guide on how to skin in minelp ] ( http://www.minelittlepony.com/wiki/skinning ) , or use the very handy [ pony skincraft ] ( http://ponyskincraft.com ) . 
  / r/mylittleminecraft, 
  i think this only serves to highlight the importance of completely drawing a character 's body before you give them clothes . 
  if you do n't , it 's very likely you 'll end up with weird anatomical anomalies ... 
  try / r/minecraftseeds . 
  the nyan cat one has something when you hover over it !, 
  i would like to see something like / r/mylittlepony 's flair system , where the name of the relevant character shows up as alt-text shows up when you hover over the flair . 
  i always thought the faded glyph represented the underwater ufo . 
  the the three lines coming out the bottom make it look upside-down , as if having crashed . 
  that 's not even a pun . 
  it 's a start , and it 's wonderful you put so much effort in , 
  the main problem here is that is proportions are all out of whack , and the drawing is n't really helped by the fact that it 's half hanging off the page . 
  [ here 's a nice guide to facial proportions to help you out .
