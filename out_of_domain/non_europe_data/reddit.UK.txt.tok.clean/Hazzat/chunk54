  the best advice i can give is to pick up a copy of the book drawing on the right side of the brain . 
  the reason you 're struggling to capture a likeness is because you ( like everyone else ) had ideas of what a drawn face/eye/mouth / person looks like when you were young , and they 're really really hard to shake off . 
  the book will teach you how to look past that and draw what 's actually there , and as soon as you get the hang of it ( which only takes a day or two if you 're dedicated ) drawing anything you see suddenly becomes really easy . 
  one of the book 's first exercises is to turn the image you 're copying upside-down and make sure you * do not name any parts of it in your head * , so you could try that now . 
  i ca n't wait to see what you put out next !,

  perhaps you could find a way to get it printed . 
  you do n't , but trust me , others will .

  one day , in the summer of 2011 , someone on a forum i frequent changed their avatar to a picture of fluttershy singing the evil enchantress song .

  i ca n't give advice on finding a job , but as i 'm in the process of applying to animation uni courses right now , i know a little about that !, 
  as others have said , get to work on your drawing skills and do your best to draw a variety of things . 
  every place you apply will ask to see a portfolio of life drawings , and some will want to see a sketchbook of ideas , doodles and character designs . 
  that 's not everything though . 
  there 's an invisible checklist of relevant animation/filmmaking techniques , which , if you know them , will prove to be a big boost for you : stuff like composition , pacing , cinematography . 
  i 've only been drawing for about 6 months so my portfolio is nothing really special , but when i showed the interviewers at hertfordshire ( uk ) one of my stop-motion films , they offered me a place on the spot . 
  my experience is that the kind of person you are is often deemed more important than your skills . 
  i have a friend who went to summer school at calarts and they told him drawing skills are only the second-most important thing they look for in an applicant - your creativity comes first . 
  if you can show them you 're a dedicated , creative individual who really really likes animating things and has at least some ability in the relevant areas , they 'll be all over you . 
  and if you 're not that , find a way to pretend you are .
