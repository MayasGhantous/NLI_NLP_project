  [ ] ( / sbstare `` i jest , of course . '' ), 
  [ ] ( / flash ) / r/sunsetshimmer added sunset shimmer and flash sentry flairs ( and a snowdrop one , but she 's not canon so i guess that does n't count ) , and i added a coco pommel one to / r/cocopommel . 
  i think they 'd all be right at home here . 
  i 'll mull it over , but subreddits about 2 ponies is a little trickier because there 's two colour schemes to integrate ... a different approach might be necessary . 
  [ ] ( / rdsmile ) i 'll let you know if i come up with anything . 
  please share this with / r/mylittleminecraft !, 
  cuuuute !, 
  you should share with / r/equestriagirls . 
  [ ] ( / cake ) happy cake !, 
  [ ] ( / badasslyra ) there 's a reason / r/bestship is called / r/bestship . 
  it 's very nice of you to direct the internet points to the right place , but they made self-post so they do n't receive any points from it !, 
  [ ] ( / lyraunimpressed ) you 're pushing it . 
  wow , that was super-informative !, 
  i love the technique of using hard pencils to blend drawings from soft pencils , i 'd never thought of that before .

  nah buddy , [ sips said before christmas that there would n't be any skyrim for little a while because it takes time to edit ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/sips/comments/1t5v3h/dear_buds_a_holiday_message_from_one_heck_of_a/ ) . 
  plus , at the end of his woodcutter simulator video ( which was his first video recorded in 2014 ) he said there was more skyrim coming very soon . 
   sexy, 
  well , if you 're into that kinda stuff ... 
  hey man , i do n't judge . 
  [ ] ( / c28 ) now that 's just mean . 
  viw , you are amazing . 
  time is relative . 
  / r/learnuselesstalents * , 
  my favourite easter egg is [ one of the developer 's faces hidden randomly on the side of a mountain ] ( http://i.imgur.com/x3fzm7w.png ) . 
  [ / r/chiliadmystery managed to track him down . 
  there 's also / r/museumofreddit . 
  the musical ? 
  holy moley , this has quite a variety . 
  musicals , rap , indie rock , ska ... you just ca n't sit still on one genre can you ? 
  [ ] ( / c11 ) that , like , 60 times as much !, 
  it 's an advice animal called ca n't see carol who was popular for a while about a year ago , but never really went anywhere . 
   i ca n't speak for the sub, 
  i can - [ the sub 's traffic stats are public ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/mylittlepony/about/traffic/ ) if you want to see the numbers . 
  the brave little toaster goes to the moon !,

  [ ] ( / ppboring ) i feel like for it to be an authentic pony-written sign , it should really have the last few letters cut off . 
  also / r/forhire is the place to get employed through reddit .

  i thought the best way of introducing it was the old subreddit logo . 
  the 50k celebration one has been up for * ages * ( and is kinda outdated now the sub has passed 60k ) and i really hope it can go back to the one with the sparkly head tingles soon .

  let 's see what happens . 
  come back when your story is complete, 
  throwing out `` has anyone tried ... '' questions does n't get us anywhere . 
  try it yourself , then report back and people will listen . 
  my experience with conventions is that cosplay is always a free-for-all . 
  it 's always acceptable to dress up as any pop culture character , and someone will recognise you no matter what . 
  the folks at / r/chiliadmystery believe an asteroid may be involved in uncovering the game 's biggest easter egg . 
  there 's nothing to say that this is it , though . 
  it could just be a normal rock that was placed in the air . 
  [ here 's the timelapse of it being painted . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jazxilewheq ) it 's quite something !, 
  as in any subreddit , contacting the mods is better done by [ messaging them directly ] ( http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2ffantheories ) rather than just throwing your message out into the open . 
  * as long as you accept it into your heart first . 
  [ ] ( / a03 ) blah blah blah / r/equestriagirls blah blah blah !, 
  it 's not a bad start , but you have much to learn !, 
  / r/mlpdrawingschool is the place to go . 
  no way !, 
  there 's a team of people who are still trawling through the game files ( there 's a lot of game files ) and they 've shown that there 's all sorts of stuff still out there . 
  there 's [ an alien egg ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mwm1lui.jpg ) hidden somewhere in the map , [ a futuristic hud ] ( http://www.fastswf.com/k5meo2e ) with [ alien symbols ] ( http://youtu.be/hlfm2qulgj0 ) , an [ asteroid ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/chiliadmystery/comments/1rueq6/an_alien_egg_isnt_enough_asteroids/ ) and , most recently , [ a list of 190 things that change in the world by the time you see the mt.

  it 's not over yet . 
  i would n't think much . 
  youtube as already unbelievably oversaturated with gaming channels and videos , and it would take something truly * truly * special to break the mould . 
  if you think you and your friends can bring something new and interesting to the table , by all means go for it . 
  if not , you 'll just end up blending into the noise like everyone else . 
  and that 's why you should ` come back when your story is complete ` . 
  [ ] ( / ppawe ) hot damn , those are some * fiiiine * prizes . 
  nina-serena 's `` definitive '' character designs are fantastic and i love them , but it 's always nice to see something new and different for a change . 
  they got it pretty accurate with me . 
  i had $ 600k and i 'd found half of that just lying on the floor . 
  now i 'm down to $ 280k . 
   just because youtube are the ones who are paying them , does n't mean they 're necessarily employed by youtube . 
  that 's right . 
  each channel is registered as its own company , so technically all the content creators in the yogscast are self-employed . 
  last night i dreamt you could just select the jetpack when waiting in the lobby of a gta :o deathmatch , and we 'd all just overlooked that .

  bronies usually love going nuts for stuff , i 'm also surprised it kinda slipped under the radar . 
  yes you can , in both single player and online . 
  you can hold up the store by pointing a gun at the cashier .
