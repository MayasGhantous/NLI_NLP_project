  phwoar , smells like onions . 
  [ ] ( / a05 ) i thought slhrpg made it very clear that the missing pair is twipie . 
  i know it sounds weird from the title , but it 's honestly great !, 
  it 's really cute , very funny and truly made with love . 
  i highly recommend it . 
  there 's a mac version !, 
  so far all the evenings with sips this year have left me a bit cold . 
  the attitude he seems to be taking with them is more like a game review , or an introduction to the game so i can try it out myself if i like the look of it . 
  that 's not nearly as fun as just watching sips play a short blast of a game for the first time for his own enjoyment . 
  ( * gravity bone * , anyone ? ), 
  i think it 's telling that he spent over 5 minutes on the title screen of * long live the queen * talking about what the game was going to be like rather than actually playing it . 
  i do n't mind short series , but i just wish they were made more entertaining . 
  [ rhyming with oranges ] ( http://m.youtube.com/rhymingwithoranges ), 
  i was shocked to find microtransactions in bravely default . 
  i hope it does n't become a trend . 
  i think this screenshot is from the very first yogtowers video ( or at least a very early one ) so it 's before they had the chance to decorate . 
  [ ] ( / twiright ) / r/mylittlepony offers [ an faq ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/mylittlepony/wiki/faq ) which can shed some light on it . 
  you can always make a post there if you 'd like to ask more . 
  in short : it 's not ironic , it 's not sexual , it 's just because they think it 's a really good tv show . 
  [ ] ( / a04 ) i. . . 
  i 'm a little overcome . 
  i need a moment . 
  [ ] ( / c20 ) i 'm a little sceptical of spitfire claiming her actions were just a test ... 
  [ ] ( / a15 ) dude , it feels like i 'm having , like , rainbows poured into my brain . 
  [ ] ( / a36 ) spoiler in the title ? 
  for shame . 
  [ ] ( / tc14 ) [ i can one-up that . 
  [ ] ( / b07 ) this is the true season-long story arc . 
  and that 's why [ he 's # 1 ] ( http://www.karmawhores.net/ ) . 
  it was me , i did it . 
  we only need one brogre subreddit , and i figured the one that 's already got a nice css theme , detailed sidebar and active moderators is the best one to stick with . 
  / r/shrek may reopen as a subreddit dedicated to serious shrek content , but it 's not quite as easy as just making a post saying `` these are the rules now '' . 
  on top of that , there is n't all that much non-brogre shrek-related content being produced nowadays , so even if it was reopened it would be pretty much dead . 
  consider it closed for indefinite refurbishment . 
  [ ] ( / raritywut ) what 's up with / r/adventuretime and / r/harrypotter ? 
  what is it about mlp and tla that means people are so much more interested ? 
  [ will this do ? 
  could you give an example ? 
  this could mean several things . 
  i went on a tour of the medieval buildings of york ( england ) a little while ago , and when i poked my head into one of the gift shops i was surprised to find a master sword in there amongst the medieval replicas . 
  yep , but everyone seems to forget about [ the underwater one ] ( http://i1.ytimg.com/vi/uu4xegbo-oo/maxresdefault.jpg ) . 
  hmm , i think it would make more sense if beacons with different effects had different coloured beams . 
  it 's likely related to the game * portal 2 * , where the omnipotent robot glados [ is transplanted into a potato ] ( http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/546/193/3d5.jpg ) . 
  [ knowyourmeme has a page on the subject . 
  ] ( http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/recorded-with-a-potato ), 
  done !, 
  [ ] ( / derpcane ) / r/thecane [ ] ( / b32-in ), 
  lately i 've seen lots of outsiders in brony-related threads recently saying `` i thought it was weird and gross , but i watched a documentary about it on netflix and everything kinda made sense . '', 
  [ here 's just one example of that . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/outoftheloop/comments/1vili3/bronies_is_it_ironic/cesnzub ), 
  [ ] ( / a14 ) you did a great thing !, 
   wololo is the sound made by the priest unit in the 1997 game age of empires . 
  it is used as an interruptor , causing the color of something to change colors between red and blue . 
  they 've changed it so if you set your statuses to private , the status box comes up with some `` security tape '' lines around it . 
  so it 's pretty easy to spot . 
  it 's on netflix . 
  because this comments section is a graveyard of comments from people on both sides throwing slaps at each other with no one listening to anyone else and everyone getting angry . 
  i liked it when it was opinion-free week . 
  only for a week . 
  now we have to live with it again . 
  it 's nice and all , inoffensive and unprovocative . 
  but i always think it 's kind of a shame when a subreddit just implements an existing template , variety is always more fun . 
  this is my specialist subject !, 
  the brogre `` fandom '' originated on a brony site . 
  some members got fed up of the way it was being run so they created their own parody fandom dedicated to shrek . 
  the original brogre facebook page ( now deleted ) served initially to highlight dumb stuff people were doing on the site , but garnered more attention than expected . 
  it took off elsewhere when [ the original ` shrek is love , shrek is life ' greentext ] ( http://i.imgur.com/zkybg.png ) was posted on 4chan . 
  there are now a fair number of popular shrek-related facebook pages and sites , most of which are listed in the sidebar of the brogre home on reddit : ** / r/brogres ** . 
  join us , brother . 
  [ ] ( / ajsup ) your screenshots are nice , but your links are broken pal . 
  i can see what you 're talking about , but ... nah . 
  if this really was a clue it would be more clear than this , and it only kind of looks like an alien head . 
  ( i personally think it looks more like a horse face . ), 
  even assuming this was n't jesus toast , where would it lead us ? 
  yep , or at least it was to begin with . 
  now it 's perhaps less like / r/circlejerk and more like / r/onetruegod . 
  do n't feed the trolls . 
  with pleasure !, 
  \\  on deathbed, 
  \\  doctors say my time is up, 
  \\  tell family my final wish is to have ` all star ' by smash mouth play at my funeral, 
  \\  at funeral, 
  \\  laid to rest , parting words are said, 
  \\  ` all star ' starts playing, 
  \\  sky turns green, 
  \\  earthquake , people begin to panic, 
  \\  a booming voice is heard : `` what are you doing in my swaaaamp ? '', 
  \\  ogrelord descends from the heavens, 
  \\  reaches into my grave with his magnificent green hands, 
  \\  lifts my body up, 
  \\  whispers in ear `` it 's all ogre '', 
  \\  flash of light, 
  \\  mfw reincarnated as an onion, 
   why the downvotes ? 
  the ugly green watermark does n't help , but the problem is that it 's really not `` funny and awesome '' . 
  it 's a coincidence ( therefore perhaps better suited for / r/mildlyinteresting or / r/notinteresting ) but it 's not all that amazing . 
  your demanding attitude is off-putting too . 
  1 , the swamp , kingdom formerly run by lord farquaad . 
  ^ ( i 'm from the uk ), 
  yes , in fact it is one of the few songs the ogrelord permits us to listen to .
