  i 'll think on it and get back to you . 
  of course , of course . 
  mr. neil cicierega is hailed as a great prophet in the book of many layers . 
  can i have a free pass due to the fact that my floor is covered in lego ? 
  i 'm diving into research now and ca n't find any other source that says rainbow rocks will be a movie . 
  [ the original mlp forums post ] ( http://mlpforums.com/topic/85592-new-stuff-at-the-london-toy-fair/ ) is light on the details , and does n't provide any proof either way . 
  [ ] ( / egstare ) remain sceptical . 
  the guy who went to the toy fair said this :, 
   twilight heads back to the mirror world and the girls put a musical group together . 
  the apparent title is rainbow rocks ( as that 's what their backdrop was on the stage set for the toys ) . 
  no more information at all , just a short loop of footage running endlessly of a dance routine that 's in the movie . 
  pinkie will be playing the drums !, 
   confirmed by various sources . 
  ... care to share them ? 
  [ ] ( / soawesome ) i am ** pumped ** for this movie !!, 
  [ ] ( / spikepushy ) less pumped for people 's reactions to it . 
  ^ ( / r/equestriagirls - we 're still kinda magical ! ), 
  that happens with any phone number that does n't explicitly have a person on the other end . 
  you can type in any random number and you 'll get the same thing .

   open discussion is welcome , but if you just really want to vent about how much you do n't like the movie please do n't do it here .

  they 're a little ... [ disproportionate ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yie5_cyfzhk ) . 
  nice colours though !, 
  i 'm not convinced we 're getting the whole picture here . 
  the ad looks like it 's on a display , so there 's every chance it could be animated and the brand name shows up after this . 
  this one is really old . 
  it 's the cover for the fanfic ` my little dashie ' , but in this case someone replaced rd with fluttershy . 
  i did read it and ... well . 
  i ended up * ragequitting * half way through because i got really * really * angry at how badly i felt it was written . 
  it was packed with clich\u00e9s beyond belief , the protagonist was so irritatingly wistful and the whole thing just kept jumping huge leaps in time with nothing really happening for the most part . 
  i just could n't take anymore and had to put it down . 
  ( it did n't help that i was studying english literature at the time , so my critiquing skills were on fire . ), 
  my little sister read it all the way through , and convinced me to skip to the end . 
  i did , and yes it was very sad . 
  [ ] ( / ppboring ) but that 's just my opinion , do n't take my word for it !, 
  [ ] ( / eg17 ) uh , well , the issue is ... 
  [ ] ( / rreallyshy ) ^ ( flash sentry is n't all that expressive ... ), 
  [ ] ( / wonderwink ) i added a flash sentry flair now just for you , buddy . 
  [ ] ( / eg23 ) oh flash , you 're so dreamy ... 
  foxes say `` yip '' . 
  remember peewee ? 
  [ ] ( / spikewtf ) neither does anyone else . 
  you can do ` - ` or ` # ` or ` & nbsp ; ` to name a few . 
  [ peewee ] ( http://static1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120317200759/mlp/images/f/fd/peewee_just_hatched_s2e21.png ) was a baby phoenix who was meant to be spike 's pet . 
  he appeared at the end of s2e21 and was never seen again . 
  it was [ implied ] ( http://static1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130127111608/mlp/images/4/4d/spike_and_peewee_picture_s03e11.png ) later on that spike gave peewee back to his parents . 
  i know i was hoping for ai dee ... 
  [ ] ( / reg00 ) ** you get your hands off my husbando **, 
  one of the first things anyone did with the mural was try to overlay it on a map of los santos to see if the lines matched up . 
  no one found anything , but you 're welcome to try !, 
  use snapmatic !, 
  i 'm at the hippy camp right now and ca n't even find the garage you mention . 
  [ ] ( / ajcower ) tactical dmca takedown coming if this ever takes off !, 
  the art is really pretty though , i 'd certainly like to see where it goes . 
  i think they 're referring to the smaller hippy camp on top of a hill , with the banner that says `` welcome '' with a picture of an alien . 
  `` cloverfield '' was the codename for the incident . 
  the monster itself was called clover . 
  my theory is that each of the big boxes at the bottom of the mural corresponds to a different ending , and the fact that the ufo and jetpack are connected means you might only be able to access both those things ( whatever they may be ) if you killed one of the characters . 
  i agree it feels weird to punish a whole bunch of players for blindly picking the `` wrong '' option . 
  if you wanted to see the g4 breezies , you only needed to hang around for [ the * littlest pet shop * episode that followed ] ( http://i.imgur.com/4z6tigo.png ) . 
  stored in a separate dimension . 
  i think the idea is that it 's just for `` investigators '' to play together , rather than research together . 
  it 's pretty clear that there 's nothing to be found by playing online . 
  it 's the same mod !, 
  [ mine little pony ] ( http://www.minelittlepony.com ) !, 
  you got your feet on the * grooouuuund * , oh oh, 
  aw c'mon man , lps is great !, 
  i know the art style is a bit off-putting , but under the hood it 's a lot like * pony * . 
  the main difference is that because it has a less detailed lore , they 're free to go more crazy with it . 
  as a result , the whole thing is hilarious ( and there 's tons of references , meta jokes and 4th wall-breaking ) . 
  i lub the littlest pets . 
  read the sidebar rules , bud . 
   * finally , this is n't a chatroom and you 're not sending messages directly to sips .

  it plays at their hq and at some point during all the epsilon missions . 
  i have n't heard it play anywhere unrelated to epsilon . 
  you could copypaste this into / r/lifeinapost . 
  nah , i do n't see why they would n't just stick with the old icon for the sake of continuity . 
  oh man , this is what i used to do when i first discovered the yogscast and wanted to watch all of lewis and simon 's videos !, 
  would recommend . 
  the alien egg and the alien hud in the game files prove there 's more out there . 
  there may or may not be a `` huge secret '' , but we certainly have n't found everything . 
  ^ ( edit : rephrasing ), 
  it upsets me too , especially when i imagine the confused little kid on the other end . 
  but i ca n't stop watching . 
  if you 're looking to contact the mods , [ message them ] ( http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2fyogscast ) . 
  i often wonder what it means to be downvoted in / r/negareddit . 
  your choice probably affects your standing in the mysterious and cryptic karma system underlying the game . 
  you 're often forced to make weird choices without ever knowing what the implications are ( accepting/rejecting dr. friedlander 's advice ; your approach to the heists ; choosing to kill/spare dr. friedlander , the submarine parts lady and so on ) . 
  the only thing we know it affects is your psychiatric report . 
  is it part of solving the mystery ? 
  we do n't know . 
  maybe you can help us find out . 
  what 's the source for this ? 
  the person who posted it said they found it on facebook , but it 's not on the my little pony page . 
  ** edit : ** i found it .
