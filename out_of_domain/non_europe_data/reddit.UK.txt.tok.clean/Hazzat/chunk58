  i think cris says the earth is 157 years old , it always has been and always will be . 
  so the city could still have been founded in the 1700s . 
  [ ] ( / a28 `` back in my day ... '' ) it 's certainly a different feeling now . 
  maybe it 's the rose-tinted veil of nostalgia , but things seemed more exciting back then . 
  it was the dawn of something big , with promises of great art , animations , discussions , ^ events , ^ ^ sites , ^ ^ ^ communities ... 
  it 's been a long time since we 've had something that draws everyone together . 
  the hype for the new pony.mov , a new * friendship is witchcraft * , jackle app 's ` seasons ' album , lauren faust coming to bronycon , fighting is magic , attending the first meetups ... 
  many of these things are still going , but they lack the glow of knowing there 's even bigger things to come . 
  i think what we need is something new that everyone is interested in . 
  i guess that 's why i liked * equestria girls * so much - we 'd seen ponies for so long it was refreshing to have such a drastic change . 
  * friendship is manly * , jananimation 's work and [ the response to the cane ] ( http://reddit.com/r/thecane ) have come close , but they have n't quite captured the attention of the masses in the way things used to . 
  [ ] ( / flutterwink ) if there 's anyone out there who thinks they 've got an idea radical enough to get everyone excited again , the door is wide open . 
  [ ] ( / a14 ) / r/mylittleminecraft !, 
  i was thinking of [ his interview in gta : sa ] ( http://youtu.be/egu67jjzv8q ) ( jump to 2:09 ) . 
  that 's 3d universe so i guess it does n't count though . 
  listen to this guy !, 
  setting up flair is fiddly , but easy when you know how . 
  if not , i 'll take one of your finest neils please . 
  really ? 
  it 's all the same company , evening standard is just metro in a serif font .

  [ ] ( / celicane ) / r/thecane wants a word . 
  i 've had promotions running at the top of / r/equestriagirls , / r/thecane and / r/cocopommel for the past couple of weeks . 
  [ ] ( / ppshrug ) not that i think it 's made much of a difference , but i 'm doing what i can . 
   does anyone have a 99.9 % save game ? 
  ( or something close ? ), 
  pretty much - i 've just got a few under-the-bridges , knife flights and stunt jumps to go . 
  although if you 're on xbox i guess that 's not much help ... 
  she looks like ashleigh ball !, 
   i 'm sick of people doing ` good ' playthroughs, 
  has there ever been a case where someone played through it without killing a single innocent ? 
  because that 's something i 'd like to see . 
  in that case , / u/willeth should feel free to go buck wild . 
  or just being able to go back , highlight etc. 
  like your average text editor .

  it 's called lay 's almost everywhere in the world . 
  [ wikipedia sez  ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lays ), 
   ** lay 's ** ( also known as ** walkers ** in the united kingdom and ireland , ** smith 's ** in australia , ** chipsy ** in egypt , ** poca ** in vietnam , ** tapuchips ** in israel , ** margarita ** in colombia and ** sabritas ** in mexico ) ... 
   in 1932 , salesman herman lay opened snack food operation in dorset , ohio ... 
  oh my gosh , this makes sense . 
  i thought the mural charted a story path , but could n't work out where it started . 
  you 're right on everything , and it starts at the bottom-centre . 
  i think xs are things you should n't do , as they all lead to dead ends . 
  the aim should be to ascend to the eye . 
  are you sure you 're thinking of the right guy ? 
  it sounds like you 're talking about fabien , the yogi . 
  [ ] ( / frithmph ) a misconception i 've had about subreddits is that if you do n't get a big influx of people at once when you open , you 're doomed forever . 
  in reality , it 's a case of gradually grabbing the attention of more and more people over time . 
  the most efficient way is to watch the / r/mylittlepony new queue for relevant content , and leave a comment letting interested folks know there 's a dedicated subreddit . 
  ( it worked for / r/equestriagirls , / r/thecane and - to some extent - / r/cocopommel ! ), 
  of course , that can be pretty tricky if there is n't much apple fritter stuff being posted there ... 
  the only other options i know are to aim for mlp sub of the week , or [ buy a reddit ad ] ( http://www.reddit.com/ad_inq/ ) . 
  i love the theme here !, 
  i 've heard people discuss this before , using the terms `` hard 100 % '' for everything completed , and `` soft 100 % '' for the minimum having been done . 
  punch line in the title, 
  exactly how we like it, 
  and it 's not just the mouth animations . 
  as animation is basically acting by proxy , it really helps to know how a line was delivered before applying any movements at all . 
  [ ] ( / c20 ) the same thing happened last week !, 
  [ ] ( / b19 ) / r/cocopommel welcomes you !, 
  / r/vfx is where all the visual effects artists hang out . 
  i do n't know about a place for vfx requests though . 
  / r/lifeinapost ? 
  it was on cartoon network on january 20th . 
  ( if you wan na watch it right now , [ it 's on dailymotion ] ( http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x1a15nw_the-powerpuff-girls-dance-pantsed-special ) . ), 
  you should use [i.reddit.com ] ( http://i.reddit.com/ ) .

  [ ] ( / c26 ) did moldova 's eurovision act play the superbowl ? 
  ( the spike gif is based on [ this video ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy1b3aggnxw ) ), 
  no , i found rog and tyrone ( i 'm beginning to suspect those are n't their real names ) through [ this post ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/outoftheloop/comments/1wube7/who_are_these_guys/ ) . 
  merchandise , minecons and multiple platforms . 
  mojang has many ways to make money off their masterpiece . 
  other people have recommended third party sites , but you can find the exact date and time you signed up for reddit without leaving the site . 
  go to your user page and hover over `` redditor for 11 months '' on the right-hand side . 
   the stereo-type can represent reddit 's insecurities about itself, 
  for some people , perhaps . 
  but for the majority of people perpetuating the stereotype ( / r/cringepics , / r/fedorafederation et al. ), 
  it comes off much like kids making fun of each other in the playground . 
  i say that because the only time i encountered people saying `` hhahaaa fedora neckbeard lol ! '', 
  outside of pseudo-anonymous reddit discussion was a pair of 14 year-olds throwing it back and forth again and again . 
   it will disappear soon enough . 
  oh , please let it be soon . 
  when the hypothetical neckbeard 's attributes are used as a cautionary tale , i think that 's fine . 
  but when real people/groups start getting labelled as it , that just feels like kids throwing insults . 
  it 's a little weird , but it 's not a screamer or horror or anything like that .
