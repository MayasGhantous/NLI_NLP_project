  / r/brogres contests the notion !, 
  / r/redditgetsdrawn , / r/usernamesillustrated and / r/drawforme kinda have that niche covered ... 
  that 's awesome !, 
  the last one surprised me most of all . 
  it 's not every day you see a * wander over yonder * reference . 
  he 's a kid who uploaded [ a youtube video ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzcdjcashvc ) expressing his delight that his previous video had received one like . 
  [ it was posted to reddit ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/1x2jod/incredibly_enthusiastic_weird_kid_makes_a_video/ ) , made the front page and people flooded him with views , likes , subscriptions and twitter follows . 
  he 's pretty excited about it . 
   we 're still magical . 
  [ ] ( / eg20 ) only * kinda * magical . 
  ^ ( * psst , rule 2 * ), 
  [ you 're talking about this mural , right ? 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/69emwqc.jpg ) marnie paints it , and she 's as strong a believer in epsilon as anyone . 
  [ i believe its meaning was deciphered a while ago ] ( http://redd.it/1qeubo ) , although i guess it 's still up for debate . 
  because [ that 's how it looks on the rainbow power toys ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5htanpjz61e/usbi2fjx56i/aaaaaaaaan0/zrwzzbiuqtw/s1600/1517697_777274545623318_424571899_n.png ) . 
  you need to learn the ways of reddit formatting , laddie . 
  ( hint : backslashes ! ), 
  i recently upgraded to bnw and am struggling to understand the religious pressure dynamic . 
  if a city says ( +6 pressure ) , does that mean there 's 6 pressure being exerted on it , or is it pushing 6 pressure onto nearby cities ? 
  i 'm not australian , i 'm in the uk and i 've already seen it twice . 
  when so much of the appeal of this movie is seeing a * gorgeously * detailed and colourful world come to life , i would n't recommend pirating a crummy cinema recording to anyone . 
  i do n't really get it , who is she thinking about ? 
  space core ? 
  / r/greatgigsguy3, 
  do n't drink it . 
  everyone loves it . 
  8.7 on imdb , 95 % on rotten tomatoes , / r/lego is nuts for it and there 's barely a bad review in sight . 
  the only criticisms i 've seen are that the message gets a little muddled , there are n't really any strong female characters and `` lord business '' ( who , i 'd like to point out , is not actually a businessman ) being a bad guy is getting a few people riled up . 
  those are incredibly minor complaints , and the response has been * overwhelmingly * positive . 
  knowyourmeme explains it better than i ever could :, 
  * i mod a little group of similarly-sized subreddits ( listed on my user page ) . 
  i also did the css on them all !, 
  * outside of reddit , i 've helped to run a popular minecraft server and its forum for nearly 3 years , and have forum modding experience that extends back even further than that ... 
  * strictness ? 
  if someone breaks the rules , you bring down the hammer on them . 
  how strict you seem depends on what the rules are ( which really should n't be any more than `` all content must be related to zoey , and do n't be a jerk '' ) . 
  * i know i do n't post or comment here much , but i lurk a heck of a lot . 
  if you do n't have anything worth contributing , why try to contribute it ? 
  that 's me !, 
  oh my goodness , it 's brett mounce . 
  i have n't seen that guy in a while . 
  if the movie was made using actual lego , [ it would have used 15,080,300 bricks ] ( http://variety.com/2014/film/reviews/film-review-the-lego-movie-1201082797/ ) . 
  which is a little absurd !, 
  ^ ( btw , if you like lego stop-motion : / r/brickfilms ), 
  in received pronunciation ( the typical `` posh '' english accent ) d * ahh * nce and p * a * nts do n't rhyme . 
  `` eli5 '' does n't literally mean `` as if i was 5 years old '' , it just means `` in layman terms '' . 
  so says the sidebar of / r/explainlikeimfive . 
  the `` censoring '' just means the comment was deleted . 
  * ** rewarding : ** watching a blossoming community interact , share discuss and have a lovely time , all as a result of your actions . 
  nothing brings a warmer glow to my heart . 
  * ** challenging : ** actually getting people to show up in the first place . 
  platforms for getting your subreddit noticed are incredibly limited , and the only way besides / r/newreddits and / r/notsonewreddits is hoping you get lucky in a popular comments thread or two . 
  i 'm constantly looking out for discussions related to my subreddits in the hope that i 'll be able to get a snowball rolling , but it 's not easy . 
  your story sounds a lot like [ the one for / r/damnthatsinteresting ] ( http://redd.it/1tjmo0 ) !, 
  i 've been meaning to try it at some point , i just have to wonder if there 's really a market for / r/brogres content out there ... 
  / r/sudokuwatch is there to support you !, 
  you 're close , [ they were modelling a pig ] ( https://twitter.com/dinnerbone/status/430684874576760832 ) . 
  / r/wanderoveryonder , it 's what lauren faust has been working on since she left pony . 
  [ ] ( / flutterwink ) you should share with / r/equestriagirls . 
  [ ] ( / eg12 ) alright , here 's my philosophy with it . 
  if you do n't like the idea of human mlp characters in a high school , that 's cool . 
  i can see exactly why that is , and i share some of the sentiment . 
  but you 've got ta accept that no matter how much you kick up a fuss , the movie is happening . 
  heck , by the look of the trailer , it 's a fair way through production . 
  is it so hard to look on the bright side of the whole thing , and find stuff to enjoy ? 
  such raging anger really does put a downer on those of us who are actually looking forward to it . 
  i really enjoyed having humans in * eqg * - it felt really refreshing after 3 seasons of pony . 
  i do n't think it was perfect either , and i probably would have preferred a `` proper '' pony movie too , but there 's so much to love and i really wish more people would focus on that . 
  [ ] ( / egb16 ) ^ ( let 's just all be glad / r/equestriagirlshate never took off ), 
  did you not see [ how nice everyone was when she visited / mlp / ] ( http://i.imgur.com/k6376qw.jpg ) ? 
  it just needs a little more / r/thecane , i think . 
  nope , their fiverr pages are still up and running !, 
  there 's a subreddit for them now : / r/greatgigsguy3, 
  yep , we know already . 
  if you do a google image search for `` come back when your story is complete '' you 'll see a bunch of pictures of it . 
  have you tried analysing the epsilon music ? 
  i think if any sound is going to hold a hidden message , it 's that . 
  times new roman is n't the font for this . 
  try something sans-serif ? 
  [ first draft . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/q7puxql.png ) still needs some tidying up and i 'd like to put something on the `` picture '' , but i just wanted to share what i 'm going for . 
  remember this is likely going to be shrunk down to ~ 40px tall . 
  you 'll barely be able to see any of the things you added at that size ... 
  * that * guy is my favourite kind of guy . 
  thanks for explaining . 
  changes made : [ draft 2 !, 
  perhaps the best post we 've ever had . 
  stay layered , friend . 
  i get high on his love . 
  that 's excel too !, 
  you can tell by the green stripe on the icon , and the inclusion of an * fx * box . 
  lighting the room , of course . 
  there are levers on the opposite side of the lamps . 
  you can see one peeking out behind the lamp on the right . 
  is this the first yogscast video to have a swear word in the title ? 
  as far as i know , they 've all been clean up to now !, 
  franklin gets contacted by this cult during the story . 
  if you use him to send them money , they 'll give you the password ( s ) . 
  you get a special t-shirt if you follow it all the way through to the end . 
   i do n't think this sub should have a mod that is a scientologist .
