  [ this is as close as you can get at the moment . 
  ] ( http://www.planetminecraft.com/mod/mine-little-brony-125/ ) it 's a good mod !, 
  nope , mine little pony is purely aesthetic . 
  if you are looking for a gameplay-changing mod , there 's [ mine little brony ] ( http://www.planetminecraft.com/mod/mine-little-brony-125/ ) , which is made by someone else . 
  hate to break it to you , but i 've played with the person wearing that skin and ... it 's not tombstone . 
  said mod is available [ here ] ( http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/333322-world-downloader/ ) . 
  the guilt of returning to a returning to a weed-ridden spoontown where people have been getting distressed about my whereabouts for years would be unbearable . 
  downloading part of a world is n't stealing - it 's only stealing if you try to pass it off as your own later . 
  i do n't see anything wrong with downloading a creation if you just want to look at it in single player , or perhaps modify it to make it better , as long as you 're not claiming it 's yours . 
  you know you can take a screenshot in-game with fn + f2 ? 
  it means you do n't get the stuff at the top there . 
  well now you can move minecarts ( very slowly ) with the arrow keys while you 're in them . 
  that pretty much fixes all the problems with trying to get your cart to go once you 've put it on powered rail . 
  a good idea , but a subreddit for this already exists : / r/notsonewreddits, 
  if you understand code , you can read all about it [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/minecraft/comments/qprgw/notchs_secret_in_minecraft_discovered_rare_title/ ) . 
  edit : fixed the link, 
  and the advice animals are gaining tons of points again ... 
  [ you 're in luck !, 
  ] ( http://www.snorgtees.com/good-things-come-to-those-who-break-clay-pots ), 
  good on them for actually making something original for a change . 
  i was there when it happened . 
  towards the end of the writers ' panel , during the audience questions part , a guy was in the middle of asking his question when the crowd begins to go `` ooh ! '', 
  and turns around . 
  one of the light fixtures is sparking , and it sets the plastic covering the light on fire . 
  the plastic melts and drips down to the floor below . 
  thankfully it was over the aisle down the middle and not on top of anyone , so no one was hurt . 
  we 're all shuffled out of the mane hall ( yes it 's called the mane hall ) , somewhat reluctantly because it was pretty and drama is fun . 
  about a minute later they say they need to evacuate the whole place , so we 're all kicked out for about an hour and the whole day 's schedule is messed up . 
  makes a good story though !, 
  sparks on their own would n't have been too bad . 
  melting plastic dripping down from the ceiling is very , very bad . 
  there was a trial held afterwards . 
  spike did it . 
  [ ] ( / spikenervous ), 
  i wrote the story out [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/mylittlepony/comments/vvrom/well_you_bronies_certainly_act_fast/c585qp9 ) if you 're interested . 
  no sprinklers were turned on , i do n't think that 's the right course of action against an electrical fire . 
  the fire department was called and we all had to evacuate so they could get in and do their thing . 
  the lighting fixture itself was removed . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/mylittlepony/comments/vvrom/well_you_bronies_certainly_act_fast/c585qp9 ), 
  yep , it was peter new 's first and i think lee tockard 's as well . 
  not to mention that none of the writers ( amy and meghan ) had done anything like it before . 
  and while lauren has done conventions before , this is the first where there a several thousand-strong crowd was brought to their feet in applause on multiple occasions , just for her . 
  the panels were pretty much all run by one person ( final draft from efr ) , with audience questions kept to a minimum . 
  plus , all the questions were screened beforehand so there was zero chance of any `` red shirt guy '' questions . 
  the nearest hoof is reaching up and touching her `` chest '' , as if placing a hand on her heart . 
  do pony legs bend that way ? 
  the source code has n't been released officially , but all you have to do is open minecraft.jar and it 's all there . 
  many modders ( or just source code analysers ) use [ minecraft coder pack ] ( http://mcp.ocean-labs.de/index.php/main_page ) . 
  i came determined to get a plushie and was prepared to spend quite a bit ... but they were all gone within the first 2 hours . 
  you must have been fast . 
  you left an asteroid after the word `` amazing '' and it does n't lead anywhere . 
  please rectify this so i 'll be able to sleep tonight . 
  ooh , why not make each cloud into a wallpaper so you can have your favourite episode as your desktop ? 
  or if you 're living in the future you can have them rotate so you get the whole season ( s ) !, 
  do n't you know they must always come in pairs ? 
  bug reporting goes [ here ] ( http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/known_bugs/latestweekly ) . 
  it says in the link at the top that they had to push it to 1.4 , or else we 'd be waiting a very very long time for 1.3 . 
  and the 1.2-1 .3 wait time is already the longest gap between updates ever . 
  only if the server you 're trying to connect to also has the latest snapshot . 
  if the server is still on 1.2.5 , no you wo n't be able to connect . 
  every meme dies someday , kiddo . 
  the left is scissoring , the right is `` in the closet '' .

  [ ] ( / hmmm ) these colour patterns look awful familiar ... 
  fishing rods can be used to pick up mobs and pull them towards you . 
  of course , you can add your own houses to it and if they fit the villagers ' criteria ( four walls , a ceiling and a door ) the villagers will treat it as a house and go in there at night . 
  yep , `` sensible '' was the word you were looking for . 
  close . 
  it started on 4chan the day season 1 * began * . 
  ( or the day after . 
  anyway it was shortly after the first episode aired . ), 
  [ ] ( / fluttershy ) oh , is your mouse okay ? 
  i would n't want us to have caused anyone to break anything ... 
  [ ] ( / louder ) not cool , man . 
  [ ] ( / abbored `` here we go again ! '' ), 
  but that 's the thing - it 's not solely made for little girls . 
  the show 's creator and the whole production team is determined to make it a brilliant cartoon so that it can be enjoyed by not only the girls to whom the show is targeted , but the parents who are watching it with them . 
  it just so happened that more people caught on too ... 
  the show 's creator has said on multiple occassions that she wants to change the connotation that `` girly = stupid '' . 
  and judging by the quality of the show and , more importantly , the reaction to it , i 'd say she 's doing a darn good job . 
  the production team only discovered their unexpected following at the end of making season 1 , so there was no pandering or fan-service involved . 
  during much of season 2 creation they were still trying to wrap their head around it ( although now with writers , voice actors and even the creator herself attending conventions , they know pretty much all there is about bronies ) . 
  i mean not to sound accusative , but have you actually watched the show ? 
  if you have and you think that those who make it have changed their tack to appeal to the new fanbase , then that 's okay ( and if you could justify it i 'd be really interested to hear why ) . 
  it just does n't sound like you 're speaking from experience . 
  heh , i loved the power puff girls when i was little . 
  funny you should mention it , the creator of mlp : fim was a writer and storyboard artist on ppg , and her husband created the show . 
  i 'll drop it here . 
  if you 're interested in a detailed , concise explanation about why adult men like my little pony put better than i ever could , i 'd recommend you direct yourself towards [ this article ] ( http://www.hotdiggedydemon.com/post/16367923346/why-adult-men-like-my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic ) . 
  otherwise , just do n't let it bother you . 
  we 're not doing any harm , right ? 
  they never said it was a bug . 
  just that it bugs them . 
  the names are derived from the toy franchise 's previous ( and much girlier ) generations , partly because hasbro seems to value continuity ( perhaps for the parents ' nostalgia value , the same way parents will buy their kids lego ) and partly because the show 's creator based episode stories on stories she has made with her own toys when she was young . 
  and besides , twilight and pinkie hardly act in the `` sunshine and rainbows '' manner you might expect .
