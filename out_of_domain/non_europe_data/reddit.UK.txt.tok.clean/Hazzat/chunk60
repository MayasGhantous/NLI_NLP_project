  reddit does n't work like that . 
  they have principles of open discussion and free thought that they stick to vehemently , and they do n't deny people subreddits on the basis that they do n't want certain views heard . 
  if you want info , resources or advice on the subject , the first place to look is [ the fulbright commission ] ( http://www.fulbright.org.uk/ ) . 
  they 're an organisation dedicated to helping uk students study in the usa , and will be able to provide you with pretty much everything you need to know . 
  if you can , you should try going to their [ usa college day ] ( http://www.fulbright.org.uk/news-events/usa-study-events/usa-college-day ) , although as it takes place in september i guess that 's not the most useful information right now ...

  ethiopia 's happiness plummeted from 30 to -270 , so there 's that . 
  end of the month . 
  you have 9 days to scrounge together the cash for the roosevelt !, 
  i 'm afraid i 'm not really educated enough on gta cars to be able to answer that for you ... 
  that 's exactly what lewis likened it to . 
   regarding soi : i always think of soi a bit like half life episode 3 . 
  valve bit off more than they could chew , and have such high expectations riding on it that they just do n't want ( or need ) to deal with the pressure , and i feel the same way . 
  it 's not that i 'm unwilling to put time into it , i 'm just worried the payoff wo n't be as good as what everyone was hoping for , and therefore i do n't find it fun to work on . 
  i also do n't want a situation where we release 1-2 videos then go silent again . 
  / r/greatgigsguy3, 
  that 's not a pun, 
  the rain in spain falls mainly on the plains . 
  / r/sudokuwatch is there for you . 
  you may wish to fix the errors in the last section of your post - you have listed users using / r / as opposed to / u / . 
  are you serious ? 
  the majority of gilded comments have pretty low scores . 
  just look at / r/all/gilded . 
  this was addressed when this was posted in / r/frozen :, 
   no one really mentions what happens after that little cameo of rapunzel . 
  in the next shot it shows elsa singing but when it pans back to anna , she is walking away from where rapunzel was but also looking at that direction and waving . 
  giving us a hint that they did somehow say hi to each other but it was left off screen . 
  [ ] ( / e14 ) `` brony '' is a label you give yourself . 
  you wan na be a brony ? 
  you 're a brony !, 
  you wan na be a pegasister ? 
  you 're a pegasister !, 
  you do n't want to be any of those things ? 
  do n't worry , you can still watch the show without having to associate with either . 
  there 's no pressure to be anything you do/don ' t want to be . 
  [ ] ( / a14 ) do n't worry , i got this !, 
  i saw a similar ad on facebook calling for a my little pony expert , and it was for an mlp wiki that was looking for editors . 
  but it was looking to cover * all * mlp generations , so i left it alone . 
  edit : [ they 're advertising everywhere !, 
  i 've been doing some lego stop-motion work to help promote the movie , and it has n't been all that fun . 
  having to make what other people tell you to make is a little soul-crushing . 
  ^ ( shout-out to / r/brickfilms ! ), 
  [ ] ( / flutterroll ) thanks , m.a. 
  [ ] ( / faustfun ) well , technically she 's only been to one . 
  the show is made for little girls , and its intended demographic is little girls . 
  it can be enjoyed by everyone , but to say it 's not made for little girls is absurd . 
  [ ] ( / twilightfly ) ** do n't you guys know about friendship ??? 
  man , i love reading through things like these . 
  nice work !, 
  does no one know about [ reddit 's mobile site ] ( http://i.reddit.com/ ) ? 
  it 's got massive arrows . 
  [ ] ( / spikepushy ) i do lego stop-motion , and one time a friend and i tried to collaborate to recreate the mlp intro using it ... 
  it did n't go well . 
  nah , it 's building the ponies in the first place that 's the problem . 
  if you make them small ( minifig-scale ) then they 're too small to look cute/recognisable and you probably ca n't fit in any moveable joints . 
  if you make them big , then the whole set has to be really big !, 
  [ this is my favourite interpretation of that mural ] ( http://redd.it/1qeubo ) , and i believe it is correct . 
  tl ; dr : the `` dinosaur '' is the kifflom1 tractor , and the `` fruit tree '' is all the wonderful things epsilon promised you .

  move along . 
  [ ] ( / shimmer ) the promo art always looked wildly different to the actual movie . 
  i would n't expect sunset to end up looking quite like that . 
  [ ] ( / ppawe ) ** wow . 
  amazing !, 
  what pencils did you use ? 
  mine little pony is in the process of being updated . 
  these were part of [ a request for free promotion ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/pimpmyreddit/comments/1vm8mw/rbrogres_shrek_is_love_shrek_is_life/ ) via / r/pimpmyreddit . 
  we never heard back , so i guess they did n't like it . 
  [ panorama kit ] ( http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/2013623-164-forge-panorama-kit-30-your-world-as-youve-never-seen-it-before/ ) works great , although it 's only on 1.6.4 . 
  the post i linked provides a whole bunch of examples of what the mod can do . 
  i 'm pretty sure it 'll fit your needs . 
  yes , the sky is the same . 
  yeah , but the complaint here is n't about reposts . 
  it 's about the story being stolen . 
  nope , the stars have n't changed since 1.3.1 . 
  there 's more in / r/greatgigsguy3 . 
  that looks a heck of a lot like the submarine to me . 
  yep , spitting image . 
  the only thing i can think of this being is the submarine that dropped all the submarine parts . 
  in this case , do n't * be * a troll . 
  * lately * ? 
   why do admins refuse to do anything about it ? 
  they 're really big on free speech and zero-censorship . 
  they 're not going to remove someone as a mod just because most people disagree with that person 's views . 
  it 's a cool policy that works for the most part , but it 's vulnerable to the few jerks who want to abuse it . 
  but if they break the policy once , what 's to stop people asking for it to be broken elsewhere ? 
  / r/holocaust is run by holocaust-deniers , should they `` fix '' that too ? 
  it 's a rabbit hole they 're not looking to go down . 
   my post gives op an orangered, 
  only if they have gold ( which they do n't ) . 
  i 'm on your side though . 
  if anything , this one looks a lot like an egg ... 
   the commenter who suggested it was part of the way the game breaks the map into a grid is correct .
