  these ` cracks ' are everywhere and do not represent destructible scenery . 
  i guess they felt it had run its course and needed a change . 
  i do n't blame them , although it was nice to have an iconic theme tune instead of various stock music . 
  she has a [ tumblr ] ( http://ninaserena.tumblr.com/ ) , a [ deviantart ] ( http://nina-serena.deviantart.com/ ) and a [ twitter ] ( https://twitter.com/ninaserena ) !, 
  watch and find out !, 
   audiomicro.com is a great source we 've been using for a while now , it really has everything, 
   the fact that the mural was hand drawn by someone should give clue that its not drawn on a drafting board by an architect . 
  i 'd contest that . 
  the length of the horizontal lines have been shown to match the golden ratio , and the xs fit perfectly on a fibonacci swirl . 
  the mural was drawn very precisely . 
  a better example would be / r/fatpeoplestories and friends . 
  i would love to participate , but i suck at mailing things . 
  i do n't really like it when people attribute others ' creativity to drugs - it makes it seem as if you lack imagination yourself . 
  but that requires having more than one painting !, 
  i had the same problem once !, 
  just be aware that cosplay is not standard attire on japanese streets ( unless it 's halloween ) . 
  we already have a steam group linked in the sidebar ... might it be worth helping that one to grow instead of creating a new group ? 
  that 's why archipelago is my favourite map type - barely any contested borders !, 
  yeah . 
  sorry to ruin the mental image of japanese people for you . 
  i do n't , i was joking !, 
  i was just playing along with the silly idea that japan is one big anime convention all the time . 
  1 onion = \u221e layers, 
  \u2234 2 onions = 2 \u221e layers, 
  [ ] ( / spikepushy ) ^ ( neither do i , but i just love this guy 's videos ... ), 
  wow , i totally missed that . 
  better move this to mlas1 or something instead lol, 
  i went to tokyo over the end of october once and , yeah , halloween is a big deal there . 
  i doubt it is across the rest of the country though . 
  unrelated to the drama , i * really * dislike the / r/mindashq theme they use . 
  it 's creative and very well-made , but the look just does n't suit any subreddit . 
  then write to their mods and get the ball rolling . 
  ... there 's a pun ? 
  [ chuchithathechuchu on deviantart ] ( http://chuchithathechuchu.deviantart.com/art/lego-minecraft-chest-367404009 ), 
  no instructions provided , though . 
  it 's deceptively complex !, 
  eh , of all the prebuilt reddit themes out there , / r/mindashq is my least favourite . 
  it 's definitely creative and very well-made , but it just does n't suit the subject matter of any subreddit . 
  i find lo-fi subreddit themes are always better . 
  having bright green everywhere , flashy buttons and a * huge * header seriously distracts from the content itself . 
  i would n't object to a colourful redesign , but this is too much . 
  it looks like i 'm outnumbered , but i figured i 'd voice my opinion anyway . 
  i love you too , man . 
  / r/twoxchromosomes is a subreddit dedicated to women stuff , but they do n't allow memes/images ( except on fridays ) . 
  / r/trollxchromosomes is their meme/image-only counterpart . 
  it 's like i 'm in / r/talesfromretail . 
   100 k involved, 
  the stream had over 36,000,000 views . 
  a * heck * of a lot of people tuned in to watch the show and play along . 
  the system used to invite moderators to subreddits was only implemented [ in october 2012 ] ( http://redd.it/117wkp ) . 
  before that , you could add anyone as a mod to your subreddit without asking them . 
  in this case , the mods of those subs added zack braff because they could , and because it seemed funny . 
  pick a flair from over there --  so you do n't have to explain in future !, 
  aye , a shrexpert . 
  i run / r/brogres where we just talk about shrek all the time . 
  i run a sub called / r/brogres , where we talk about shrek all the time . 
  anything in particular you wanted to know ? 
  why are you being so accusative ? 
  he 's right - no post is ever really deleted/removed on reddit , just hidden from public searches . 
  nope , because snoop joined after the change was made . 
  so in that case he actually accepted the invites because he 's a cool dude . 
  you know how bronies are bros who like ponies ? 
  brogres are bros who like ogres . 
  yep , and a lot of other things besides . 
  [ ] ( / applegirl ) i 've got ta say , i was never expecting to see any * equestria girls * here . 
  you can prevent your sub from showing up in / r/all at all if you uncheck `` allow this subreddit to be shown in the default set '' . 
  given [ alison brie 's description of the place ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qm829yrpxxa ) , that 's not particularly surprising ... 
  you should share with / r/equestriagirls !, 
  here 's a calarts review left on google maps , and it does n't sound dissimilar :, 
   you say , `` cal arts is a top art , performance art , design , and film college . '', 
  not !!!!, 
  as a former student ( mfa costume design ) i have not one good thing to say about this hellhole . 
  they brought me in on a full scholarship then , out of the blue pulled it and added an extra year to my degree !, 
  people walk around nude and think they 're oh so avant-garde . 
  when i was there , every stage production had to include 1 or more of the following : nudity , massive swearing , urinating on stage . 
  the had a great-looking olympic-size pool ... which you could only go in if you were naked . 
  their sense of extreme liberalism is actually draconian . 
  i was promised a program where i would work exclusively on films . 
  once in , the department head told us , `` you do what i say , when i say it . 
  you do n't set foot outside the costume lab without my say-so . '', 
  the school actually sued one of my mfa fellows because she took a job on a film outside of school , on her own time . 
  they wanted her money !, 
  an entire department -- lighting or set design -- quit at the end of the year , including all faculty !, 
  can you imagine that at ucla ? 
  what a scandal it would be !, 
  calarts did n't even blink . 
  and never acknowledged or apologized for the conditions that led to the walkout . 
  the whole place stunk of evil . 
  in my class there were only 3 people to cover all of dance , theater , and film needs . 
  i quit , one gal went into hospital with a breakdown , the other ended up coping by using drugs and became a street dealer . 
  oh , and their credits do n't transfer should you wake up -- as i did -- and want out . 
   flee . 
  just flee !, 
  i 've applied there , so i 've picked up all these random trivia bits on the way . 
  yep , i read it and thought `` this is exactly my kind of place ! '', 
  it 's not just that , but the text is almost illegible . 
  white text with a black outline can be read on any background , folks !, 
  i know that does n't sound great , but a single piece of anecdotal criticism was n't enough to put me off the many many wonderful things i 'd heard . 
  do n't worry , i think it 's awesome too !, 
  i know there 's an / r/calarts subreddit , maybe you could use it to spread some of the nicer stories .
