  who , me or ms. brie ? 
  i am about 90 % sure [ it 's a troll account ] ( http://twitter.com/fatherwoland ) . 
  the orange guy could do with an extra frame when his face first rolls over the top ( it jumps a bit right now ) , but other than that they 're all great . 
  if you gild an admin , you 're basically just giving them $ 4 . 
  [ ] ( / mmmbananas ) mmm , bananas .

  you 'll love it for sure . 
  ** shrektacular **, 
  seriously , this is ace . 
  i made the sacrifice , gave up on exploring and just waited until i got satellites .

  they 're nice , but i think the clean look we have lends itself better to vector art rather than actual photos . 
  it was the first proper jrpg i 've played , and i did n't realise what i was getting into . 
  so many numbers to deal with !, 
  that 's why they 're the downvote icon , you see .

  it 's just his famous `` do a testimonial at my desk '' gig which has been taken down . 
  ** edit : ** now the other gigs are gone too , except for the $ 5 tip .

  out of 5,783 academy members , 2 said they had n't watched a film . 
  that 's terrible of them , yes , but i really do n't think it 's worth kicking up a fuss . 
  [ ] ( / eg17 ) gon na be honest : i 'm not sure either . 
  your drawings are lovely !, 
  [ ] ( #shrektacular ), 
  yes , i think the academy is pretty corrupt too . 
  i 'm just trying to put this particular article in perspective . 
  it began about a month ago on 4chan 's / a / and / s4s / boards , where people would request videos from rog and tyrone arguing over who had the best waifu , and the best taste in anime . 
  it spread across other 4chan boards too . 
  more recently , they skyrocketed in popularity thanks to [ the / r/videos post ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/1zpqjk/people_kept_on_pronouncing_my_username_wrong_so_i/ ) , and things will never be the same again .
