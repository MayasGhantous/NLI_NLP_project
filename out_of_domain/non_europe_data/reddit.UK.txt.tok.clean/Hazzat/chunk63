  it 's possible it 's a similar system though . 
  this question is about going the other way round - turning your karma into dogecoin .

  whatever you want , buddy . 
  do n't get too carried away , we have no way of knowing that 's actually him . 
  i 'm in contact with him and will ask him to do an ama pretty soon , i just do n't want to ask too much of him at once . 
  he knows this place exists and really likes us !, 
  listen here buster , i 've been following this thing since it was just a joke between a few friends at a drunken party one night , before it hit the internet and started gaining followers by the day . 
  so lem me tell you which one of us is a pioneer . 
  how is it still going ? 
  because more people keep finding it , it 's new to them , they like it and decide to stick around . 
  it 'll always be fresh to someone , and there 's always new content being created ( the list in the sidebar is only a small selection ) . 
  stop being such a party pooper , and have some fun . 
  fun fact : this video is where the sub 's reddit logo came from . 
  he does n't read this page much , so you wo n't get an answer here !, 
  i may be able to get him to do an ama at some point in the next few days , stay tuned . 
  i got him to do this , and wrote the script !, 
  he was so cool about it , was super-friendly and even recorded it completely for free . 
  what a guy , eh ? 
  why 'd you make this a modpost ? 
  you managed to get some real character out of the snoos . 
  you should try / r/iwantout , it 's a community dedicated to answering exactly these sorts of questions . 
  yeah , but the idea behind distinguishing yourself as a mod is that you 're only meant to do it when going about moderator duties , like making announcements and enforcing rules . 
  ( you 'll notice that if you hover over the green m , it says `` speaking officially . '' ), 
  this is mentioned in the [ moddiquette guide ] ( http://www.reddit.com/wiki/moddiquette ) . 
  thx i found it on 9gag, 
  there 's a time and a place for dickbutting around !,

  when i went there , they told us it was never finished , because they 're * always * working on restoring some area of it . 
  i thought it was pretty smart . 
  it made me jump when i suddenly spotted a pair of eyes peering out at me from the side of the page . 
   i never knew the city was that close to the pyramids . 
  wow , cool !, 
  we got to go up one of the spires , but did n't get a rooftop tour . 
  i 'll be sure to look into that next time . 
  i swear , for the whole movie this is what i thought was going to happen . 
  elsa was going to realise that shutting her sister out was wrong , and in a dire situation it would lead to anna discovering her own power . 
  then they would work together to unfreeze arendelle . 
  it says it was on the 25th of january , so you missed it . 
  i live pretty close by , so i probably would have gone if i 'd known .

  the dude has a reddit account too : / u/itsjustin, 
  this sounds more familiar !, 
  it just sounds like a way of trying to keep you multi-talented , and i ca n't understand why that would lead to people making fun of it . 
  this [ was posted ] ( http://claireonacloud.com/post/69914722373/pitch-poster-for-frozen-i-did-about-6-years-ago ) on claire keane 's blog . 
  she 's posted loads of concept art on [ her blog ] ( http://claireonacloud.com/ ) . 
  i wanted to share it all here , but there 's just so much !, 
  this was from before elsa even existed as we know her !, 
  she went through a * heck * of a lot of changes , from a [ showgirl ] ( http://25.media.tumblr.com/f241141065d9c2dd6960c0e8cdb01d21/tumblr_n04n81eotr1qcx6iuo3_1280.jpg ) , to [ a narnia snow queen-type ] ( http://24.media.tumblr.com/f084f2b80f184cfffcf3dfdd3a8465af/tumblr_n15m9760wb1qcx6iuo3_r1_1280.jpg ) , to a. . .

  reminds me of the time i went to / r/juststemthings ... 
  i recall hannah saying in one of her advent videos `` please stop sending jaffas , we have too many already '' . 
  i 've been taking classes in character design , so i can see where it comes from . 
  in the concept stage , it 's just about being expressive and getting ideas on the page . 
  you want to communicate that anna is confident and outgoing , so you quickly scribble down something that shows that . 
  and although it does n't look like it , something like that takes more skill than you think - i know i could n't create something that recognisable in so few lines . 
  never let it be said she 's a poor artist - she painted [ this ] ( https://fbcdn-sphotos-g-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/t1/1146608_683217975062940_1880656941_n.jpg ) of rapunzel . 
  at what ? 
  i 'm guessing it was [ polandball ] ( / spoiler ) , who , in an attempt to uphold their strict quality standards for content and discussion , prevent people linking their subreddit out of fear it would spur on a rush of the uneducated reddit populous . 
  i think their reasoning is pretty valid . 
  yeah , but they have a [ comment policy ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/polandball/wiki/index/policies/commenting ) too . 
  plus , if they hit the mainstream , they 'd be flooded with a * lot * of bad comics to manually screen . 
  i totally get it , i 'm into the arts too . 
  i 've seen plenty of stem elitism on reddit . 
  you 've missed out the crucial benefit of creating tourism : your influence over other civs can be very powerful , especially once ideologies start getting adopted . 
  the more influential your civ is over someone else 's , the less time it will take for a city you capture to come out of resistance , and less population will be lost . 
  if your culture is dominant there , there will be no resistance time and no population loss at all . 
  spies also steal faster from civs over which you are influential , and you get more science from trade routes with them . 
  if you have differing ideologies with a civ , and you have a big tourism score compared to their culture , they will start generating a lot of unhappiness . 
  it can get to the point where cities start leaving their empire and joining yours , or they will overthrow the ideology and force the civ to switch to yours . 
  yeah , tourism is pretty cool . 
  man , i just love all the oil paintings in this scene . 
  i really wish i could get a better look at them , they 're all beautiful . 
  that sounds awesome . 
  good luck with getting your career off the ground , it sounds like you 're already going the right way about it !, 
  from [ another comment ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/outoftheloop/comments/20e9yf/what_is_a_liberal_arts_degree_and_why_is_it_the/cg2oypq ) :, 
   that 's what they do n't seem to understand though : nobody does a liberal arts degree for money , or for a high-paying job . 
  they/we do it because it 's a learning tool , it can help build a portfolio of work , or because it 's your passion . 
  the degree itself is fairly worthless , you 're never going to get a job or do anything with the degree - but what you learn on the course and what you get out of the course are what is important . 
  it 's a more romantic view of the world . 
  the perfect answer , thank you . 
  most people here either explained why people mock liberal arts degrees , or why they mock `` artsy '' degrees , but no one really covered the confusion between the two . 
   this is usually used in anime , western animation , and other forms of cartoon . 
  concept art is used for anything with a visual style . 
  movies , video games , comic books , animated tv shows ... 
  it 's a really helpful way of communicating and remembering what sort of look you want your thing to have . 
  but yeah , this is n't concept art . 
  it 's just ... art .
