  and remember , the worst posts are at the bottom so you read upwards . 
  i do n't know what it is you 're doing tyobama , but [ i must really hate it ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wsvxyhm.png ) . 
  i remember when they were pushing that regulation out . 
  the big flaw people pointed out was you could just jailbreak your device to get around the cap anyway . 
  [ ] ( / bookz ) i forgive u, 
  my dad works for network rail , and he does n't get any discounts at all . 
  it 's the train operating companies who set the fares , so those are the guys you wan na work for . 
  `` upvote for visbility '' [ is technically against the rules ] ( http://redd.it/1jr429 ) , but people say it so often and generally with good intentions that they let it slide . 
  ferd only had to go because someone set up bots to reply to every one of his comments with horrific gore pics/gifs . 
  wait , people actually enjoy them ? 
  i just thought they were in the game for the novelty . 
  it was n't a downvote spree , it just happened gradually . 
  pretty much every time i see them , i find myself thinking `` that does n't contribute to the discussion at all '' . 
  sips 's voice is the best sleeping aid . 
  i use banished to talk me to sleep every night . 
  this reminds me of when genoa wanted me to find a new natural wonder , and were overjoyed when i found the great barrier reef inside their own borders . 
  super agreement 3 million, 
  shrexceptional . 
  fantastic work . 
  he 's just so happy !, 
  aw man , his smiles are contagious . 
  uh , should n't it be `` you should talk to me and dave '' ? 
  maybe it 's a british thing , but putting dave first sounds weird . 
  well spotted . 
  is this better ? 
  fantastic , thank you for your help . 
  \\* blush *, 
  xpost with / r/nataliapoklonskaya maybe ? 
  the fact that the background is n't transparent is something of a dealbreaker here ... 
   the sub gets very few new subscribers, 
  [ ~ 50 new subscribers a day is n't to be sniffed at . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/mylittlepony/about/traffic ), 
  that 's better !, 
  you could post her in / r/cutouts just for fun . 
  you should x-post to / r/brogres !, 
  yep , [ this article ] ( http://voiceofrussia.com/news/2014_03_19/newly-elected-crimea-prosecutor-reacts-to-internet-popularity-8198/ ) ( now removed for some reason ) said :, 
   the newly-appointed prosecutor of the crimean republic , natalia poklonskaya , has described her newly gained internet fame as `` unforeseen but amusing '' this has come in an exclusive interview with a russian tv channel . 
  the statement has already infuriated the self-proclaimed government in kiev . 
  [ the traffic stats are public ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/nataliapoklonskaya/about/traffic/ ) if you want to see for yourself !, 
  nice work !, 
  really dynamic , i love it . 
  you could probably share with / r/animesketch too . 
  the development of this fanbase has been so much fun to watch . 
  psst , scroll down . 
  `` unofficial '' could just mean `` unaffiliated her job '' , in the same way that many people have to say `` these opinions are my own , and not my employer 's '' in their twitter bio . 
  that said , i do find it a * little * suspect that this account 's first tweet was only 10 hours ago . 
  the way to grow a subreddit really fast is to get a popular post in another , really popular subreddit and mention the sub in the title . 
  ( i 've seen it happen in places like / r/damnthatsinteresting and / r/powerwashingporn . ), 
  unfortunately , i suck when it comes to getting successful posts in the default subs , so i 've never managed to pull it off . 
  [ ] ( / ohdeartwi ) the other noteworthy stat was that 31.8 % of people liked equestria girls , and 37.7 % did n't . 
  huh , the tweet got deleted . 
  / u/tweetposter archived it [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/nataliapoklonskaya/comments/20xdmb/this_cant_end_well/cg7lt86 ) . 
  yes , although perhaps a little preoccupied right now . 
  to add to what / u/aznmadness42 said , the ukranian government attempted to destroy natalia 's reputation by finding dirty pictures of her and spreading them around . 
  such pictures do n't exist , and the best they could do was find a few modelling shots like [ this one ] ( http://i.imgur.com/zm3rhtp.jpg ) . 
  the folks in kiev tried to make a big deal out of how abhorrent the pictures are , but it did n't work . 
  here she 's talking about how she does n't how how they got hold of her modelling pictures . 
  it was very flawed , but for some reason still got me whipped up into a giddy frenzy in the way only mlp can . 
  ( so much so that i took over / r/equestriagirls ! ), 
  if you have 80 minutes spare , i 'd say you should watch it . 
  the songs alone are worth it . 
  ` do you wan na build an autonomous republiiiiic ? ', 
  with love from / r/nataliapoklonskaya . 
  i 'm clicking around and pressing my arrow keys , but nothing 's happening . 
  you know you 're meant to submit to / r/nocontext when you link it , right ? 
  this one is my favourite . 
  it is : http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/darude-sandstorm, 
  [ if you must . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/nataliapoklonskaya/search?q=over18%3a1&amp;restrict_sr=on ), 
  there 's also the allure of taboo , given that she 's siding what most of us would call ` the bad guys ' . 
  heck yeah . 
  this is one of the best mlp fan works i 've ever seen . 
  hiya , i 'm a mod of / r/nataliapoklonskaya and i did the css . 
  it 's really been nuts . 
  there 's been at least 250 people looking at the subreddit at any given point over the past few days . 
  the highest i saw it rise was over 700 . 
  [ there 's been nearly 100,000 unique visitors . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/nataliapoklonskaya/about/traffic/ ), 
  i think it 's a bit weird that despite all that , we 've only got ~ 4,000 subscribers . 
  i guess most people go `` lol wut '' , then leave pretty quickly . 
  [ this is the source . 
  ] ( http://warm-quest.deviantart.com/art/goddess-natalia-poklonskaya-441764146 ) 483x800 is as big as it gets , i 'm afraid . 
  no it does n't . 
   2 : all images that are posted must have content related to the civilization , alpha centauri , or colonization series and should be original .

  refuse, 
  archipelago quickly became my favourite when i discovered it makes contested borders much less likely . 
  i like my cultural victories , and it 's much easier to get them when you do n't have to worry about the civ next door wanting to come and trample on you . 
  but i always stick to random maps , so that i 'm not giving myself an unfair advantage . 
  ^ ( los santos is n't a real place ), 
  aw man , that subreddit had such great potential . 
  shame nothing much happened with it . 
  at least we 've got [ humans of los santos ] ( http://imgur.com/a/dyukv ) . 
  uh ... no ? 
  yep , but random is the fairest of all . 
  let the game decide your circumstances !, 
  it 's achieved notoriety as [ the most controversial post here of all time ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/nataliapoklonskaya/controversial/ ) , so that 's something . 
  i 've been to bern several times ( my dad 's family is swiss ) , and it really is as gorgeous as it looks in the picture .
