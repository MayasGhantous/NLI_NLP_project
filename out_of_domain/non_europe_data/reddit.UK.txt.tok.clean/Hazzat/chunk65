  switzerland is beautiful . 
  i 've been to both the city and the alps in both summer and winter , and it 's a wonderfully pretty place . 
  the bern old town is gorgeous and rustic , while the mountains are the most beautiful i have ever seen nature . 
  there 's big parties and massive atmosphere when the skiing season is on , so it can be far from quiet . 
  they also have a lot of truckers and farmers , so bizarrely country music is extremely popular . 
  [ here . 
  [ here 's the video ] ( http://redd.it/214lt2 ) in which a reporter tells her she 's an `` international sex symbol '' . 
  we do n't know . 
  while many signs point to it being fake , it 's been referenced by many people as genuine , [ including this guy with a verified account ] ( https://twitter.com/nikitaodintsov/status/446711039435218944 ) . 
  [ ] ( / raritywut ) why is * it 's not easy being breezies * rated the worst mlp episode of all time ? 
  i thought it was pretty good . 
  ** edit : ** and * maud pie * was the best ever ? 
  i 'd take those season 4 scores with a pinch of salt .

  x-post / r/nataliapoklonskaya, 
  about five days ago , when [ the new prosecutor of crimea turned out to be a pretty lady ] ( http://youtu.be/ftoqplotkju ) rather than a bulky russian man , the internet went nuts for her . 
  there 's been a large amount of anime art devoted to her in particular . 
  i help to run the subreddit and did all the css , and it 's been super fun watching the fanbase grow . 
  [ ] ( / c38 ) you 're gon na give me wings so we can start the little sister uprising , overthrow our big sisters and rule the world , right ? 
  [ ] ( / sbstare ) oh , some words of advice ? 
  i guess that 's okay too . 
  the government in kiev is n't happy that she 's taken over crimea , and have put out a warrant for her arrest . 
  she has n't actually been arrested though . 
  well , it depends on who you ask . 
  ask russia and they 'll say it 's autonomous , preparing to be assimilated into russia . 
  ask kiev ( and most of the world , probably ) and they 'll say it still belongs to ukraine . 
  either way , prosecutor of the autonomous republic of crimea is the title she 's been given . 
  does this make you the newest disney princess ? 
  awesome !, 
  natalia would be proud . 
  russia 's tourism is so influential over crimea that they can be annexed with no resistance time . 
  do n't take the downvotes too personally , as [ this was posted already ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/nataliapoklonskaya/comments/20zdkm/an_interesting_crossover/ ) . 
  i would n't get too excited , [ this is what turps said ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/yogscast/comments/219njp/maker_studios_sold_to_disney_what_does_this_mean/cgazfnv ) :, 
   the yogscast was never owned by maker and thusly ca n't be sold to disney ... now if disney had a horse to trade for the yogscast then i am sure sjin and i could come to an arrangement with them . 
   as for how this effects the yogscast ; it 's extremely unlikely to change anything . 
  we 're our own beast ( s ) and will continue to be so, 
  djhd3dcinemax said it first in a shatblock video , it 's leaked into other sipsy content from there . 
  there 's been work-in-progress versions of it cropping up occasionally , which is what you are thinking of . 
  [ look who posted the first version ] ( http://redd.it/20wm9l ) . 
  [ it said on the blog ] ( http://vizual-statistix.tumblr.com/post/80468941142/unlike-like-emperor-kuzco-i-was-actually-born ) that the sources were :,

  [ ] ( / lyracane ) i love this tune so much , thank you for linking it so that i may listen to it again . 
  edit : holy wow , the gif sync up really well does n't it, 
  welp , i did a little digging for you and found there are several merchants on alibaba ( [ like this one ] ( http://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/best-custom-anime-3d-mouse-pad_1117483160.html ) ) that offer such a service . 
  some, 
  body, 
  where do i apply to become a shill ? 
  it depends what sort of game you think minecraft should be . 
  they keep adding more and more blocks , mobs , biomes and features , so it 's good if you like that . 
  the problem i have is that minecraft 's strength is in the fact that it 's a * platform * , not a game , and that 's what made it popular . 
  there were a few archetypal animals , plants and materials , and the rest was up to you . 
  they are working on official mod support very slowly , and i really wish they would stop adding features and focus on getting that finished . 
  describe your first shrek encounter . 
  you 're right . 
  it 's strip mining . 
  for some reason many people mix up strip mining ( digging out a big hole , layer by layer ) with branch mining ( digging tunnels underground ) . 
  steam workshop-style 1-click installation , never again having to dig around in your versions folder , better compatibility between mods , more user-friendliness and it may end up being much easier to make mods . 
  i 've never used forge myself as all my favourite mods use modloader/liteloader , but mods developers i 've talked to tend to get a bit snobby about it and do n't like it . 
  i 'm not passing judgement though . 
  nope . 
  his friend got off the hook , but his own fate is yet to be decided . 
  [ here 's the post . 
  ... [ and here is the link to said page ] ( https://www.facebook.com/pages/natalia-poklonskaya/496984517080221 ) . 
  ( it 's been in the sidebar for a while . ), 
  as much as i love this , we do get it posted a * lot * . 
  the last time [ was just a few days ago ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/brogres/comments/217l0b/mouth/ ) . 
  thanks for sharing though . 
  one of her earlier interviews mentioned that the kiev government tried to slander her reputation by finding dirty pictures of her and spreading them around , but they were unable to because such pictures did n't exist . 
  now they kind of exist . 
  there is no texture pack here , and shaders are n't being used either . 
  this was a render using a different program ( probably blender ) . 
  the easiest way to make your own is to use a program called chunky . 
  you can learn more in / r/chunky . 
  [ ] ( / wubseverywhere ) she is whatever you want her to be !, 
  they were searching before her popularity took off . 
  there were a few glamorous modelling pictures , but that was about all they could find . 
  eh , i think / r/conspiratard and / r/conspiratardmemes are better for that stuff . 
  this was clearly meant to be [ listened to repeatedly ] ( http://www.listenonrepeat.com/watch/?v=ubvcuzrrqt8 ) . 
  officialnasa.tumblr.com redirects me [ here ] ( http://pemsylvania.tumblr.com/ ) , so i guess not . 
  i once read a suggestion that these should take a turn or two to arrive at their target after being fired to give the target a chance to do something that can stop it . 
  currently , if someone 's got advanced ballistics , all you can do is build bomb shelters and hope . 
  hah , i 'd forgotten about these videos . 
  thank you so much for reminding me again . 
  just to clarify , this was made by / u/martinus . 
  it was just x-posted here by someone else .
