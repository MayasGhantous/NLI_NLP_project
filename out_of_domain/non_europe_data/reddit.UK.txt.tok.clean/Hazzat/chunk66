  you need a mod to approve each and every one . 
  that would be a jerk thing to do . 
  [ ] ( / b24 ) sketchy business , given that [ this person ] ( http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.php?mode=medium&amp;illust_id=42309100 ) did the drawing and i made the image . 
  writing anything at all is already against the spirit of the game to some extent , so this is n't a great idea . 
  hello david , i have had to remove your comment because you should n't share your email and password so publicly . 
  for anyone else reading , this is what the comment said :, 
   today is wendsday march 26th about 7am toronto ontarion time in canada that is ipm your time . 
  my name is david earl henderson and i am about 3 times your age that is 7o i was born in toronto on november the second 1943 . 
  at this time or say about 6 days after i was watching tv and saw the trains leaving the ukraine and crimea headed to prison camps . 
  i heade to the canadian air force base at dehaveland and flew to your country to save these people that i felt so worried about . 
  iwqs in the second world wafr as a soldier of fortune acting solely until about augustof 1945 when the world wafr was officially over . 
  at this time, 
  the british under british general montgomery led the american army and the russian army into germany and the city of berlin was divided with the west of berlin given to the americans and the east of berlin to the russians, 
  i was with canadian forces for some time and was even captured by the germans ands put into auswitz prison but escaped with my father . 
  i rarely fought weith him because he left canada to join the american infintry although he was from ireland i guess he felt more safe that way he survived at least and returned to toronto canada to work as a printer my mother was a waitress and came from glascow scotland . 
  i was almost two years old when the world war two finished, 
  never to happen again, 
  atomic bombs over nagasaki and the heroshima ja [ pan sent by american bombers under orders of u.s.a. president harry truman, 
   i read your little problems with the violation of article 109, 
  of the ukrainian nationasl socurity organization, 
  one of many others included, 
  thay say you took office in crimea defied the coop by others to take over the government seeking independent government by kiev from ukrainia itself, 
  well that coop has been diverted and the russians have sent the ukrainian army and marines home without any gun fire, 
  or conflict so these charges have been reverted and some good has come from it . 
   my email is [ redacted ], 
  password is [ redacted ], 
  you are allowed to look me up, 
   my pictures and stories are there, 
  your canadian friend david earl henderson, 
   iwill keep in touch, 
  man , this report is a bunch of nonsense . 
  while there was definitely a fair amount of porn and creepiness towards the start , it tailed off pretty quickly . 
  now if you try to post either of those here , you 'll get downvoted fast . 
  you just have to check the ` controversial ' list to see how divisive it is . 
  ^ ( edit : i said `` pretty quickly '' twice and it sounded weird ), 
  it 's a derivative of ` swiggity swag ' :, 
  done . 
  some people . 
  yeah , it 's just two guys who are planning to make a mod . 
  i 'm not sure why that 's newsworthy ... 
  this article is n't great , it does n't say which gta game they 're looking to mod . 
  i ca n't find any more info anywhere else though . 
  i 'm impressed by how fast this particular image has spread , given that it [ was only uploaded 3 days ago ] ( http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.php?mode=medium&amp;illust_id=42524808 ) . 
  but more importantly , ** where do i buy ? 
  or let everyone else build the wonders , then take them for yourself with the huge army you built instead !, 
  yep , i like to wonder whore too . 
  it 's just a lot of fun to play around with different strategies . 
  what makes you so special , eh ? 
  yep , dragonframe is the best around !, 
  but if it 's a bit out of your price range , boinx istopmotion is much cheaper and it 's still pretty great . 
  i 've been using it for years . 
  rockstar ( the gta developers ) are n't the sort of company that implements community-made mods in their games , especially as gta v is only out on consoles and modding it at all is likely against the terms of service . 
  implementing community content is more of an indie developer thing to do . 
  gta v earned over $ 1bn . 
  in your heart !, 
  just when you thought her cuteness was already infinitely scalable ... 
  [ ] ( / wonderwink ) they never said anything about * equestria girls * though . 
  finally , another tina . 
  i thought we were all alone out here . 
  it 's based on the last letter of your username , so there are 26 of them . 
  [ ] ( / thehorror ) will those get c&d 'd too ?? 
  dhx is the company that makes the show . 
  this was an april fools joke . 
  in more recent updates they 've started including that feature . 
  they 're gradually supporting more cameras over time . 
  semantics : satellites \u2260 satellite dishes . 
  you had me confused as i was scanning the picture for flying objects . 
  i really was !, 
  this sub is so full of crazy stuff , i 'll believe anything . 
  of course , you ca n't really because those games are very scammy with misleading advertising . 
  but it 's fun to see her used in it anyway . 
  if you want to conquer the world as natalia , stick to [ the civ v mod ] ( http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=240108029 ) !, 
   giveaway 's are something i have never seen frowned upon on this sub reddit, 
  asking for free stuff is against the subreddit rules , so participating in a giveaway could be viewed as that . 
  i thought it was utterly charming , especially the character designs . 
  it was a little slow-paced , but overall very entertaining . 
  i did n't take the picture ( sorry !, 
  ) , but the watch was free in mcdonald 's happy meals in 2010 . 
  there are a few available [ on ebay ] ( http://ebay.com/itm?itemid=281295783455 ) if you search for them . 
  as the designer of it , i 'd like to say \\* blush * and :3 . 
  i decorated the rest of the sub too . 
  it 's not very complex , i just borrowed [ this image ] ( http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.php?mode=medium&amp;illust_id=42309100 ) , then spent some time picking an appropriate typeface and googling how to make a ray pattern to put behind her head . 
  i 'm glad you like it !, 
  and now all the subscribers are ` poklonskaya poklinniki ' - , 
  she claimed to be married to england , so in this case i guess they just love the country !, 
  ah , thank you for the corrections !, 
  i ca n't program it , so poklonnikov will have to do . 
  * i am the music man , i come from far away ... *, 
  [ this was on ukranian tv !, 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss8ipbvtddq#t=106 ), 
  10 hour version , huh ? 
  guess i 'm in this for the long haul ... 
  correction , you can click the * thumbs down icon * on the ad and you wo n't see it again . 
  downvoting here only tells the reddit admins that you do n't like it , and they 'll refrain from running similar ads in future .
