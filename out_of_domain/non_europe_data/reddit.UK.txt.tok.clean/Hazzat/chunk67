  i added it to the sidebar !, 
  the sidebar is getting very long now with all these links , i 'm not really sure what to do about it ... 
  you 'd be surprised by just what a low percentage of visitors actually subscribe , especially in subreddit about very specific things . 
  i run / r/nataliapoklonskaya , which took off about 2 weeks ago in a major way . 
  it was getting linked everywhere , from / r/videos to / r/nottheonion , and we got ~ 100,000 uniques in 5 days ... 
  but only 6,000 people decided to stick around . 
  i think it 's likely you did get linked in a popular comment , but none of the visitors were really interested in dos . 
  i remember seeing this guy !, 
  he got a lot of pictures . 
  `` 14 years-old '' is a state of mind . 
  that 's what people really mean when they say that . 
  yeah , but so is everyone from california . 
  i was on the fence about this game , but now i have realised i can make a natalia mii and have her fall in love with me , i 'm sold . 
  the european version can be found [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lqiouk4sli ) , with even more crazy stuff in it . 
  perhaps the funniest 3ds game so far ? 
  woaah , was there a video of that ? 
  it must have been quite a sight . 
  no , the ball she 's holding has the [ flag of crimea ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/flag_of_crimea.svg/1200px-flag_of_crimea.svg.png ) on it . 
  awesome . 
  ps3 does n't have download codes , all updates are just downloaded ans installed automatically . 
  nah , people just do n't have much to say in subreddits like these . 
  see / r/demotivational , / r/facepalm , / r/ecards and so on for a similar experience . 
   the main thing you can do to help is , to put it simply , post !, 
  and , if possible , try to mention us in a popular comment . 
  most subreddits gain traction by getting listed in the sidebar of a relevant subreddit , but that 's not an option for us as there are no relevant subreddits . 
  the closest thing to it would be / r/4chan , and when i asked their mods how they felt about featuring other subs i ( predictably ) received a barrage of insults back . 
  there are * thousands * of people who would love to subscribe to this place - [ just look at these comments ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/22x91n/sr4_shreks_row/ ) - but they just do n't know it 's here . 
  we just need that one big feature to get the ball rolling , and we 'll spread like wildfire .

  they used to do regular newcomer threads here ( [ this was the last one ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/1yux35/official_newcomer_thread_2242014/ ) ) , but for some reason they stopped recently . 
  you could use a [ random civ game generator ] ( http://www.dropshock0.com/civ/ ) to pick your opponents and put them in manually .

  i 've discovered why . 
  it 's an edit of [ this image ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bsqmdqx.jpg ) ( i could n't find an uncropped version , sorry ) from a russian mmo called allods online . 
  well , [ this image was made just after the first smash bros wii u/3ds trailer came out ] ( http://redd.it/1g7tb6 ) . 
  your quest is noble , but do n't forget to drop a few links to / r/brogres about the place too . 
  nah , it 's just a spambot . 
  i 'm impressed by how friendly you are towards them , though !,

  really ? 
  i know there 's a bunch of shorts still to come , but surely there 's too much in this book ( including a coherent narrative ) to fit into the remaining ones . 
  as i mentioned in another comment , it 's because this is an edit of [ this image ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bsqmdqx.jpg ) .

  / r/greatgigsguy3, 
  man , what a story . 
  i 'd argue this guy has n't merely reached a middleground or attained mediocrity - he 's still on the way up . 
  you can find the info about how to join the server at [brohoof.com/info] ( http://www.brohoof.com/info ) !, 
  it 's a natural wonder , but a pretty rare one . 
  it does n't show up in many games . 
  these are awesome !, 
  added to the sidebar !, 
   no drawback whatsoever, 
  science and culture costs would still rise !, 
  but with no unhappiness , that would be easily manageable . 
  or moved 2 and got a mountain as well !, 
  wow , 29 comments and no one 's given an actual answer . 
  [ here is the knowyourmeme article . 
  ] ( http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/special-delivery-instructions ) while the people listed on it were by no means the first to do it , those instances were the start of it spreading on the internet . 
  why not pick one of [ the subreddit 's previous monthly challenges ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/1wvq4a/weekly_challenge_history/ ) ? 
  they 're all pretty fun . 
  if not , just convince yourself to pick `` random '' in the game setup more often . 
  i rarely pick my leader , or even the map type . 
  there 's no right answer to this . 
  the fun of civ is that you have to adapt and change your tactics depending on the situation you 're in . 
  outside of immortal/deity , there is no `` correct '' way to play the game . 
  because there 's only a limited space in that box , and i 'd rather use it to promote cool community stuff than the official dreamworks-run stuff !, 
  we 've all been there , bud . 
   [ 30fps ] would give me the same duration clip , but of much smoother quality ? 
  in theory yes , but in practice probably not . 
  working at 30fps is so hard because it requires you to make * extremely * tiny movements for each frame , and it 's likely your animation will come out looking worse as a result . 
  if you really can work at 30fps and are prepared to put in the huge extra amount of time and effort , go for it . 
  i just do n't think it 's worth it ... 
  `` shooting on twos '' ( which is what you are doing when you take 2 frames at a time ) is totally valid , and i believe that 's how professionals like aardman work . 
  it was kinda funny the first time , but now it 's just getting really annoying .
