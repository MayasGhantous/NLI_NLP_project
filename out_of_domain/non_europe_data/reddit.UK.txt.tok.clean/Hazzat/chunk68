  would there really be that much revenue ? 
  that 's worth about $ 5 . 
  but i guess it 's more an issue on principle . 
  yes , definitely . 
  not just because `` oh , they got * x * - thousand subscribers in a day !, 
  '' , but because the boost allows them to snowball . 
  now way more people know the sub exists , it will start getting linked more often whenever it 's relevant , either in sidebars or comments . 
  there 's plenty of stories where this happened . 
  that does n't explain the work boat . 
   diverting any production to a lot of soldiers may hurt him and allow rythian or duncan to get ahead . 
  as lewis already has the most soldiers ( they show the demographics screen in part 3 ) , i get the feeling he might try to warmonger just to level the playing field a bit . 
   what happened to just enjoying something . 
  that 's exactly what they 're doing . 
  i do n't know a single person who has rewritten their identity for it . 
  sure , those people are out there , but in no greater numbers than extremely devoted star wars fans/trekkies/whatever . 
  not always . 
  they 'll vote for you if they really , * really * like you , and that 's normally only achievable by liberating one of their cities after they 've been eliminated from the game . 
  sounds a lot like when [ the oatmeal tried to watch game of thrones ] ( http://theoatmeal.com/comics/game_of_thrones ) . 
  better out than in , i always say . 
  punchline in the title, 
  ** again **, 
  ... and now i understand [ the civ v `` game over '' screen . 
  ] ( http://well-of-souls.com/civ/images/defeat.jpg ), 
  [ also shakespeare 's ] ( #inglin ), 
   a person who sometimes gets bored with all the waiting, 
  . . are you sure this is the game for you ? 
  that would be because it was posted on both [ trp ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/theredpill/comments/23pbe5/article_dear_girls_who_are_finally_ready_to_date/ ) and [ mgtow ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/mgtow/comments/23q80c/dear_girls_who_are_finally_ready_to_date_nice/ ) , to general acclaim . 
  i ca n't believe it 's not satire . 
   do you crave adventure ? 
  krave adventure *, 
  [ ] ( / applebloomaruu `` i see y' all ! '' ), 
  it would have to be some ancient building , because the whole point of that opening shot is to show an ancient thing next to a futuristic thing . 
  [ ] ( / cerealpie ) i ` mma dump some knowledge on you . 
  the reason the ai wo n't make peace with you is because they think they can still win . 
  the only way to get them off your back is to build more military units , even if you do n't intend to use them . 
  they 'll realise victory wo n't be as easy as they thought and will back off . 
  having a sizeable army sitting around will also deter them from declaring war in the first place . 
  ( they can `` see '' your army size on the demographics screen - press f9 . ), 
  early game , make sure you improve all your luxuries as that 's where a lot of your money will be coming from . 
  i tend to find myself making 3-5 gpt until currency rolls around , which lets you start making the big ones . 
  trade routes ( bnw , i 'm assuming ? ), 
  are lucrative too , but risky towards the start when there 's loads of barbarians around . 
  capturing cities will always result in a happiness hit , so do n't do it unless you know you can take it . 
  you can mitigate unhappiness with wonders like the forbidden palace , and you can cut down on the resistance time by being influential over the opposing civ . 
  you could always sell/gift your newly captured city to another civ , and i 'm sure they 'd be very grateful . 
  gold focus is n't quite as good as having your city produce wealth , because with the latter you do n't lose out on growth and stuff . 
  [ ] ( / ppohyou ) as others have said , stick to the lower difficulties until you feel like you can ramp it up . 
  i learned it all on warlord !, 
  frozen , which was by disney . 
  that 's been in the sidebar for a long time already !, 
  i can never get enough of neil . 
  what a guy . 
  no thx m8 , organising raids is what gets you ( and your favourite subreddit ) banned . 
  the shreksual/god worship of shrek is only a pretty recent phenomenon . 
  there 's more in / r/brogres . 
  i 'd like to see sunset holding up a trophy with `` 100 '' on it !, 
  [ ] ( / sunsetnya ) awesome !, 
  it 's a / r/shrekspiracy !, 
  why ; _ ;, 
  [ ] ( / abshocked ) the plounge is here ? 
  no can do laddie . 
  / r/brogres prides itself on being a bastion of free speech and freedom of expression , even on the topic of dreck little `` lords '' . 
  removed for being irrelevant !, 
  this is * wonderful * . 
  a few semantics about phrasing :, 
  * the vanilla game avoids using terms like `` spawn rate '' , because it 's kinda immersion-breaking . 
  they 'd be more likely to phrase it `` the rate at which great artists , writers and musicians appear ... '', 
  * `` can you build a civili ** s ** sation that will stand the test of time ? '', 
  - while i am a speaker of british english , the game always spells `` civilization '' with a z !, 
  do n't let that make you think i 'm put off though , i love these mods and am always eager to see what the colonialist legacies series puts out next . 
  [ i too built a monument to the ogrelord !, 
  [ ] ( #shrektacular ), 
  [ ] ( / thehorror ) the fanfics !, 
  just think of the fanfics !, 
  [ ] ( / ppshrug ) if marketing results in stuff that 's this cool , they can market all they want !, 
  [ ] ( / a11 ) no no no , you all blinked !, 
  let 's try taking it again ... 
  [ ] ( / flutterwink ) the whole show has been four seasons ' worth of ( awesome ) marketing , and no one seems to mind . 
  the key ?? 
  [ ] ( / thehorror ) you mean there will be ** more boxes ??? 
  [ ] ( / thecane ) ** the cane !, 
  she lives !, 
  hail to the cane !, 
  the colours in this episode were really jaw-dropping . 
  when the alicorn magic swallowed tirek in a big explosion , somehow all the colours just * worked * . 
  [ ] ( / ppshrug ) that 's the power of harmonious combinations , i guess !, 
  [ ] ( / ajugh ) centaur anatomy is complicated . 
  [ i got ta know what 's in that box !!!, 
  ] ( http://youtu.be/9hjbl1sepzy ), 
  [ ] ( / rarityprimp ) oh shrek , you 're so dreamy ... 
  in addition to what / u/fringepioneer mentioned about the upcoming second movie , [ there will also be a spinoff tv series ] ( http://www.equestriadaily.com/2014/05/equestria-girls-equestria-academy.html ) . 
  ... there is no link . 
  [ ] ( #shrektacular ), 
  i picked herts in the end - other places like bournemouth focus purely on the aesthetic in order to prepare you for a life in vfx . 
  my interests lie in narrative and telling stories , which they do n't really cater for . 
  i asked about it in my interview at bournemouth , and they gave the example that if you were to pitch a film to them , they would n't be looking for a script and storyboards , but rather some concept frames of how your finished movie would look . 
  maybe that 's what you like best , do n't let me put you off !, 
  for your portfolio , life drawing is of course a must , but you 'll really want to show off anything distinct that they would only find in you . 
  the deal-sealer for every interview i went to was when i busted out a tablet with a 2-3 minute film i had made .
