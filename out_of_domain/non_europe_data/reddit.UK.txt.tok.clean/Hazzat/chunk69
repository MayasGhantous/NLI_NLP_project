  they loved it and it really set me apart , so you should do what you can to show them something of yours that will blow them away . 
  interestingly , the hertfordshire interview was more of a formality - they were ready to offer a place to everyone they had invited and just wanted to make sure the course was really right for me . 
  for that reason , your personal statement should be really strong , but there are a million guides on how to write one of those already . 
  just do n't be shy - you wo n't get far if you do n't show off !, 
  good luck !!, 
  backup plan ? 
  haaaahhhh ... ( no i do n't have one lol ), 
  the unis said that the uk is the place to be for animation/vfx right now , as better tax breaks mean a lot of animation companies are leaving canada in favour of soho ( london ) . 
  video games are also massive money spinners , with gta v making more money for scotland last year than all the country 's oil !, 
  it 's not been something i 'm too worried about as i 've made some awesome contacts , but it 's true that by studying it you are pigeonholing yourself into film/programming/the arts . 
  ( what a weird mix ... ), 
  it 's a leap of faith for sure , but if you think it 's a career worth pursuing you 'll just have to trust that your talent will carry you all the way . 
  whatever happens , it 'll be a helluva ride . 
  they mistook us for / r/brogress . 
  hello friend , i recommend you eat your onions and work on developing your layers in order to become as well-rounded as the ogrelord himself . 
  we will be here to help in your endeavours should you have any questions . 
  do n't worry about marking these as spoilers , they 're not clips from the movie so they 're not spoilery .

  i did that when i played on warlord and i thought i was so smart . 
  then i got totally wrecked on my first time playing prince . 
  buying an army is not a viable strategy .

  kids can have relationships , but only with other kids ( and they ca n't get married ) . 
  i have n't noticed any other differences , and my island has a bunch of kids . 
  you can try ordering [ directly through his website ] ( http://bigtyrone.com/services/order-custom-video/ ) . 
  yeah , it 's clear he just filled in a template . 
  who knows , maybe you could offer him your services ? 
  chances are you have n't given a mii enough pocket money to go to space yet , so you still have that to forward to !, 
  but yeah , my reaction has been very similar to yours . 
  it 's not really meant for people who like to sit down and play a game for an hour or two , it works best if you just check in every now and then . 
  stuff gets a little more interesting if you stuff the place full of miis ( the island fits up to 100 of them , remember ) but ... yeah . 
  this is it . 
  did you transfer them from mii maker , where they 'd already had their birthday put in ? 
  or scan them from an existing qr code ? 
  there is little/no replay value in this i 'm afraid . 
  it 's the sort of game you 're meant to check up on occasionally ( maybe once or twice a day ) , but if you 're like me and try to spend loads of time on it , you 'll run out of stuff to do really quickly . 
  it definitely wo n't keep you going for the whole summer . 
  she will grow up and may even head out on her own adventure , if you let her !, 
  it 's not meant to be a shadow puppet , it 's just a shape you can make with your hands . 
  i do n't know , i 've got 2 babies on my island and they 're still growing !, 
  i ca n't help but feel that a better closing line would be `` off your pants '' . 
  ( just in case you 're not aware dude , you 're shadowbanned . ),

  the first time i saw it , i thought the dead policeman on the ground was sips , and that he got totally flattened rather than pushed out of the way . 
  i spotted this and we all went * mental * . 
  ooh , i like your rarity mii . 
  do you have the rest of the gang too ? 
  his blessing did n't really help england much , though . 
  i know css , flair included . 
  ( i designed pretty much all the subreddits listed on / u/hazzat if you wan na see previous work . ), 
  if they ask you `` what do you think about me and ____ ? '', 
  and you say `` perfect ! '', 
  they will try a bit harder to get along . 
  you spoke my thoughts exactly . 
  i 'm trying really hard to love this game , but for the most part it really is a bore . 
   `` no one knows what god looks like . '', 
   `` they will in a few minutes . '', 
  i had to do a double take at that because i thought the girl was planning to kill everyone . 
  laddie , in the face of such farquaadary , it 's up to us , the chosen and enlightened few , to preserve and popularise the inner beauty of shrek jokes . 
  they say what they like , but we must always be here to make sure there 's always a place for true brogres to turn . 
  no no , that 's the prize for correctly guessing the number of molecules in * leonard nemoy * 's butt . 
  ^ ( i 'm so sorry i 've never watched star trek ), 
  it 's not really worth the $ 35 / # 35/whatever , given that it 's really shallow . 
  the craziness appeal wears off after you 've seen all the jokes once , and then what you 're left with is essentially just a collection of repetitive minigames . 
  it 's fine if you do n't play video games much and just like to drop in on them every now and again , but even then it 's hard to justify the price . 
  [ this guy 's post kinda sums up my experience . 
  the ups and downs were deliberately inaccurate after about 5 votes , so they were meaningless anyway . 
  i do n't understand why everyone is making such a big deal over them . 
  the '' % liked it '' would n't be cluttering if it was hidden in alt-text when you hover over the score . 
  for writing , you should try / r/writing and [ its various related subreddits ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/wiki/hub ) .

  watch what you say laddie , shrek still makes for a nice love story . 
  this is truly one of the best thing i have ever seen posted here . 
  you are the best friend . 
  has the renaming helped the town 's reputation at all ? 
  sort the comments by controversial to see all the stuff going down . 
  you said that your dad tries not to give you special advantages because he has the money , but what is your experience with other kids from similar backgrounds ? 
  do they have parents that will give them major boosts ? 
  because she has terrible social anxiety and does n't like creepy people . 
  nope . 
  you can buy at 18 , but drink from 16 ( as long as it 's in a licensed establishment , and with a meal ) . 
  oh , their actual mascot [ is much better than this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ravpmzd.jpg ) . 
  [ quite a few places , actually .

  i find it interesting that nowhere in europe goes higher than 18 + , with the exception of iceland . 
  there are english subtitles , press the cc button on the youtube player . 
  and their body movements too . 
  it 's all keyframed and looks very wooden ... 
  i was also in japan last month , and i heard let it go everywhere too !, 
  it was playing in the fast food resturants , there were kids singing it everywhere , someone put it on really loudly in the park ...
