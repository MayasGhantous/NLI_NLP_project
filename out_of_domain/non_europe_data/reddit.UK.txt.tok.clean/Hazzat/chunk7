  genius . 
  i started planning how i could do this with my own bag , then i realised i 've already filled my walls with posters from bronycon . 
  if you 're looking for a little more advice beyond just getting buried here , you might want to ask in / r/mylittlesupportgroup . 
  [ ] ( / thehorror ) what if it 's just a plot from anti-bronies to get all the bronies going to comic con in one place ? 
  i 'm really impressed with the quality of / r/mlp 's front page and how it 's overwhelmingly filled with art and clever musings , but the `` it took 5 seconds to make this '' image macros still slip through . 
  there 's two ( [ 1 ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/mylittlepony/comments/wdsz6/every_time_i_hear_this_lyric_i_wonder_what_rarity/ ) [ 2 ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/mylittlepony/comments/wdmbb/while_driving_with_friends_a_random_thought/ ) ) currently on the front page . 
  if you 're looking for feedback on pony drawings , i recommend you post this in / r/mlpdrawingschool !, 
  i 'm pretty sure they 've all received that question a billion times over already ... 
  the cast ? 
  which cast ? 
  who exactly in the cast ? 
  recorded interview ? 
  text interview ? 
  how long an interview ? 
  how many people ? 
  i demand specifics !, 
  [ ] ( / twicrazy ), 
  you 'd better deriver . 
  i really want to watch adventure time now , just so i can get this game . 
  gorgeous . 
  / r/usernamesnominated, 
  holy crap , i just realised i have that very same jay in my skype contacts . 
  i 'll have to ask him . 
  he has n't come online yet !, 
  i 'll admit i spent several minutes staring at the word `` burn '' to try to find a secret message hidden in the gaps between the letters before i realised there were other images in the album . 
  update : he is still `` probably '' getting it . 
  he is waiting for his friend to give it to him . 
  what , are you asking how the show adventure time is related to the adventure time game ? 
  nice cropping out of the hotbar there . 
  nope , you can see part of their hand in the bottom right . 
  the hotbar has consciously been cropped out . 
  i can assure you this is not just a british problem . 
  americans ( and no doubt those in other countries ) have to put up with exactly the same software , just with a different accent . 
  woah , thanks for linking that . 
  that 's an awesome subreddit . 
  come on guys , remember [ reddiquette ] ( http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette ) ? 
  which says do n't downvote things because you disagree with them ? 
  whatever side of the pony-fence you 're on , please do n't be rude . 
  [ this ted talk ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_lb3d7ay-m ) springs to mind . 
  it 's a good introduction to the subject of patent trolls if anyone 's new to it . 
  you can press f2 to take screenshots in-game so we only see minecraft and not the other stuff on your screen . 
  that was a fast repost . 
   slightly humanized, 
  [ ] ( / c10 ) the term is `` anthro '' . 
  oh , and the drawing is brilliant . 
  owner of the texture pack here . 
  i looked into it , but as i 've never played tekkit i did n't know what many of the textures were ... lots of people are often eager to volunteer to texture things so there may be a tekkit-compatible version at some point . 
  if you 're looking for feedback on your pony-themed artwork , you 'll find it in / r/mlpdrawingschool !, 
  if you 're referring to [ this post about a scootaloo episode ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/mylittlepony/comments/wwlsw/meghan_mccarthy_confirms_new_season_3_episode/ ) , it was just a joke . 
  meghan mccarthy tweeted the word `` scootaloo ! '', 
  and people took it as an opportunity to parody themselves and blow it out of proportion . 
  so why 929 , of all numbers ? 
  if you 're looking for feedback , i highly recommend / r/mlpdrawingschool !, 
  well i 'm sure a lot of stuff will be added to minecraft , yes . 
  if evitagen-armak said `` upvote if you tried to do the sound ! '', 
  then that would be youtube style . 
  instead they were just asking if anyone else tried to do the sound . 
  ( and the answer is yes , yes i did . ), 
  there 's a similar thing on / r/shittyadvice . 
  they 're not quite the rules , but strong recommendations . 
  but i 'm on your side here . 
  [ ] ( / ajhappy ) just for clarification for our confused friend here , `` the smooze '' is a g1 my little pony thing , `` lord smooze '' is a friendship is witchcraft thing . 
  i know this is fairly tame , but gory stuff goes in / r/mlpmature or / r/mylittlenosleep . 
  is that ... an ashens reference ? 
  yes , and it 's totally brilliant . 
  you can listen to some for free [ here ] ( http://dftba.com/product/xr/still-got-legs-cd ) . 
  ( i love chameleon circuit . ), 
  i 've been riding these trains for 3 years and never noticed this . 
  can not unsee !, 
  [ ] ( / pinkiefear ) i kind of misread this and thought you fell down a manhole or something . 
  / r/usernamesnominated, 
   * the sky is objectless , much unlike the moon, 
  dark side of the moon , maybe ? 
  the biggest problem with this theory is that the end is a series of big floating islands , and the moon is clearly not that . 
  [ ] ( / twibeam ) it needs the help of / r/mlpdrawingschool !, 
  that guy did it a little prematurely , more stuff has been added since then ( eg sideways logs , creeper damage ) . 
  steve jebs . 
  i dunno , i heard there 's some stuff going on there lately . 
  a more effective solution ( that does n't require you waiting by the door ) is to just replace the block above the door with a block of gravel or sand . 
  that way , when they break down the door , the block falls on top of them and they suffocate !, 
  ohh , that 's why the player does n't make the deep `` oof '' sound anymore . 
  [ ] ( / ajcower ) now you 've set it off , you fool !, 
  do n't you know ponies are only to be discussed outside of pony-related subreddits through pony emotes !, 
  why would you take a picture of your creation at night ? 
  surely it ca n't be that hard to wait just a few more minutes so we can actually see what you 've made . 
  i 'm desperate to know how they got a 3ds to do that . 
  i want mine to play fancy graphics !, 
  perhaps better suited for / r/mlpmature ? 
  hey , it 's better than being dead !, 
  [ ] ( / ajhappy ) the place to go for pony drawing advice is / r/mlpdrawingschool . 
  woah woah woah , mark your spoiler posts as spoilers !, 
  what sparked the recent blog post on gender in minecraft ? 
  i feel like i 'm missing some context as it seemed pretty heated and came completely out of the blue . 
  kiki is a 6-year old girl from la with a brain tumor , in desperate need of funding for her treatment . 
  tara strong is using her followers to raise money for her . 
  the donation page is [ here ] ( http://www.giveforward.com/supportkikiscancerfund ) . 
  for those who have n't seen this painting before , it 's based on/inspired by a series of beautiful songs by sogreatandpowerful called [ the standard model ] ( http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=pla089389c03b3be5f ) . 
  more griefer tools ? 
  ehhhh . 
  because that 's an arrogant and na\u00efve thing to assume ?
