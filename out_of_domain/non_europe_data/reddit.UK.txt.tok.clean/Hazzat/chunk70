  [ i took a picture of the poster for the movie ] ( http://i.imgur.com/lmi0awc.jpg ) , because it 's way more glamorous than the ones we have at home . 
  i liked it , but i did n't think it was anything particularly special . 
  still , the combination of appealing characters , a feel-good story , a tonne of marketing money and a song that people wo n't stop singing make for a guaranteed smash hit . 
  [ the folks in / r/frozen are going crazy for the news . 
  as much as i 'd like to agree , disney films do n't just get forgotten . 
  ghibli films ( * spirited away * , especially ) will always be considered among the most spectacular and fantastic animated films to ever have been made , but people will still be buying disney princess merch for decades to come . 
  if you want to get the word out on reddit ( which is the best place really , because it 's full of redditors ! ), 
  the best way is to set up a [ metareddit monitor ] ( http://metareddit.com/monitor ) to be notified whenever someone says words like `` shrek '' , `` ogre '' , `` swamp '' etc. , then reply to any relevant comments with the subreddit name . 
  i did that for a little while , but did n't really have the stamina to keep watching it all day ... 
  as for promotion outside reddit , i have little experience , but you have my blessing . 
  \\* with a heavy heart , stamps a seal of approval *, 
  do n't forget ` [ ] ( / #influence ) ` !, 
  [ ] ( / fluttershh ) i do too !, 
  and i win a lot . 
  i do n't see why people have trouble with it . 
  when i was in kyoto , i got rid of all my \u00a5 1s by throwing them in a little shrine on the grounds of the golden pavilion . 
  there were a bunch of schoolkids doing it , so i decided to join in !, 
  i saved my \u00a5 100s and and \u00a5 500s for the arcade , and used whatever else to pay for things in exact change . 
  the other two are n't so active ( at least , they do n't check every post that comes through like i do ) . 
  feel free to carry out your plan without them giving the thumbs-up . 
  oops , i missed that rule . 
  i 'll delete this and be back in a month or two . 
   why remove it ? 
  because the numbers were fuzzed and completely inaccurate to begin with . 
  they were misleading and unhelpful , so i 'd say we 've actually gained something by having them hidden . 
  and facebook . 
  this film is truly incredible . 
  an instant classic , and among the best brickfilms ever made . 
  i love it . 
  ^ ( please share it with bricksinmotion.com !, 
  the folks over there will be stoked to see it at last . ), 
  the text is all so big !, 
  there are a few reasons why someone might do this :, 
  out of tradition/habit , because before the ` retweet ' button was added everyone had to do it that way . 
  ( indeed , there are [ some people ] ( http://rays20.blogspot.co.uk/2010/06/traditional-retweet-tr-key-to.html ) who [ insist that ] ( http://youtoocanbeaguru.wordpress.com/2013/03/18/why-i-dont-use-twitters-retweet-button/ ) we should still do it [ the old fashioned way ] ( http://socialmediahandlers.com/why-you-shouldnt-use-twitters-web-retweet-button/ ) . ), 
  the platform they 're using might not have a retweet button , so copypasting is the only option . 
  they might want to track the reception of the tweet a bit better - it 's much easier to keep track of retweets/favourites/replies if it 's your own tweet . 
  i 've got ta agree with you . 
  the animation is just so wooden and the characters so unexpressive , as an animator myself i find it really hard to enjoy . 
  the jokes are neither here nor there , i do n't think it 's ever made me laugh . 
  yep , i run a subreddit dedicated to him . 
  have n't listened to the yogpod ? 
  [ you 're in for a treat . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le7q_ff2uus ), 
  the yogpod was so funny because it was two guys trying their best to make a really professional podcast , and failing hilariously . 
  they tried everything from jingles to segments , to viewer mail and celebrity `` guests '' , and nothing worked . 
  and even though they could , in theory , have any `` guest '' on that they wanted by having simon put on a different voice , they overlooked the most popular celebrities of the day in favour of warwick davis , brian blessed and the queen . 
  it was a bit rubbish , but in just the right way to still be endearing and we laughed along with them . 
  nowadays they could n't revive it because they have the talent and resources available to make a really good podcast . 
  if they wanted to recreate the humour that went into the yogpod , they 'd have to forget everything they 've learned , pass up all the editors and sound designers in the office and go back to just being two guys sitting in their dark bedrooms making references . 
  i do n't think anyone wants that . 
  ( it 's worth noting that the podcast 's spiritual successor , [ simple simon ] ( http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=plfdg8afobih1v6vgkfg7emvb4fzyvdah - ) has a similar brand of humour and can be pretty funny . 
  they also have actual celebrities on from time to time . ), 
  / r/iwantout could be helpful for you !, 
  [ the part of the dolphin shoals soundtrack ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuswiq4ugye#t=29 ) that kicks in when you resurface from being underwater sounds a bit like george michael 's ' [ careless whisper ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izgwdsrq1eq ) ' . 
  and that cites the description of [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvjueg0idis ) . 
  once they know where your capital is , they know where to go to attack you . 
  only give embassies to civs that are unlikely to warmonger , or those that already know where your capital is . 
  the courthouse sounds like a really simple solution , but remember its 4gpt maintenance can be pretty rough . 
  this is a place for people to post opinions you probably wo n't like . 
  i 'm not sure what you were expecting . 
  it 's from [ s1e17 : `` boyz crazy '' ] ( http://gravityfalls.wikia.com/wiki/boyz_crazy ) . 
  they keep passing 7 million , then youtube does one of their inactive subscriber purges and they drop below the mark again . 
  maybe this time it 's for real ? 
  miku 's english voice was only released pretty recently , so there has n't been time for songs written with it to make it into the games yet . 
  the western project diva f had song subtitles in romaji , so we still had no idea what the song was about . 
  but if you listen to a lot of vocaloid music , you should be used to that already . 
  project diva f is out for ps3/vita already , and f 2nd is coming in october !, 
  thank you !, 
  it was super fun to make . 
  ** edit : ** i should probably mention that i 'm eager to make more of these and am open to suggestions for future yoglego videos !, 
  ( more recent moments preferred , no tekkit or other really old stuff . ), 
  `` le goff '' ? 
  nope , i love all the yogs and try to watch as many of them as i can !, 
  the jaffa factory was great , but there 's been so much great stuff since then that i do n't want to overlook . 
  it was literally the ** best ** movie i watched during the 2 hours i was watching it . 
  that 's the plan . 
  i just watched it again and i should be able to cut it down to a reasonable length . 
  i 've got ta order in some special parts for it though ( eg sjin 's beard ) so it might be a week or two before i can work on it . 
  ^ ( edit : weird typo ), 
  aw , shucks . 
  * blushes *, 
  thanks !, 
  i work at 15fps . 
  because it 's related to the main channel !, 
  i have n't finished a brickfilm in * ages * , so i figured making a yogscast fanimation would be a fun project . 
  i did n't know whether i was going to make more , but after this response i guess i have to !, 
  i saw !!, 
  freaking out :d,

  good to see they fixed all the bacteria damage . 
  not for much longer , [ he 's being replaced by jane austen ] ( http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/banknotes/polymer/pages/default.aspx ) as of 2017 . 
  it means wanting to have a baby , which does n't make any sense in this context . 
  i think they meant [ brooding ] ( http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/brooding ) . 
  no thx . 
  pls no, 
  top ranking soldier ? 
  how many confirmed kills do you have ? 
  well , this link leads to a 404 for one thing . 
  [ also they 're just a pretty lousy company in general .
