  if his fiverr gig is paused , try going [ through his website ] ( http://bigtyrone.com/services/order-custom-video/ ) . 
  they 're fattening you up to become lean , mean and green . 
  you are forever indebted to them !, 
  i did n't make them , they were by [ marcie s. on tumblr ] ( http://marcefarce-art.tumblr.com/ ) . 
  it 's turn 281 . 
  that 's plenty of time for gifts . 
  `` wherefore '' means `` why '', 
  he does n't have gold , so that does n't work ... 
  it 's a place where there 's truly a community , and it 's wonderful to be a part of . 
  i do n't know the answer , but i do know all the yogscast stock music comes from [audiomicro.com ] ( http://audiomicro.com/ ) . 
  perhaps you 'll find it if you have a dig around there . 
  he 's an artist at yogtowers who drew all the original channel icons . 
  he also illustrated the [ forest of doom ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28fh54thdgo ) adventure during the christmas livestreams . 
  [ here is a picture of him with lewis and simon under the yogscast flag . 
  ^ ( you know too much ), 
  i ordered the beard in specially , and it 's definitely larger than it looked in the photos ... 
  try posting to / r/yogscastmaps . 
  [ ] ( / fsangry ) i love your flaaaaaair, 
  [ just for you . 
  itunes classifies it as `` comedy '' . 
  you can cancel the effects of the ^ sign by putting a backslash in front of it . 
  it 's a render , rather than a screenshot taken in-game . 
  i do n't know what was used to make it , but [ chunky ] ( http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-tools/1260564-chunky-minecraft-mapping-and-rendering-tool ) is a popular choice for this . 
  you make it sound like there 's a new eba game in the works . 
  the last one ended with `` to be continued ... '' and i 've been waiting ever since . 
  my mum grew up in northern ireland and moved to england when she was 20-something , and she says the use of `` whilst '' really caught her off-guard . 
  whatever people ask for ... ( i 'm looking for suggestions ! ), 
  ** edit : ** it was me who made this video , [ here 's some proof ] ( http://i.imgur.com/7s9nchm.jpg ) . 
  thank you !, 
  it took about 2 weeks , working on it all day every day . 
  turps just said on sips 's stream that he 's going , and so are hat films , kim and hannah . 
  gamechap got kicked out of the yogscast a while ago , so i do n't think that 'd be the best . 
  you 're fantastic, 
  aaaa thank you !, 
  i adore your work ciaran , so it means a lot . 
  i 'm glad you picked up on that , i 'd never animated laughing before . 
  it was fun working out how to make it look convincing . 
  thank you for the kind words . 
  [ he left a comment on the video too !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flapfmjdob0&amp;google_comment_id=z13mivii3maug30je04chxvggnufypr50cg ), 
  edit : eek , [ now simon tweeted about it ] ( https://twitter.com/simonhoneydew/status/489453706468143105 ), 
  i hear he 's made of plastic irl too, 
  surely you say that to every lego animator you meet . 
  * blush *, 
  it took about 2 weeks , working on it all day every day . 
  all the effects are pure in-camera stop-motion , with the exception of the faceblock bit . 
  i do n't really like editing/post-production much as it leaves me uneasy ( it means i do n't get to know what the final video will look like until i 'm done editing ) , so i try to do as little of it as i can . 
  daily routine :, 
  wake up ~ 8am, 
  eat breakfast while watching the new hat films video, 
  procrastinate a bit on reddit or whatever, 
  work on the film, 
  lunch , accompanied by whatever duncan uploaded yesterday, 
  work on it some more , with intermittent procrastination aided by the videos of nilesy/zoey/kim / hannah / ... 
  realise i 'm getting tired and my animation is getting sloppy, 
  prepare for bed while watching the latest from lewis & simon, 
  9 . zzzzzzzz, 
  it 's a very yoggy existence . 
  nice, 
  yeah , it would have used something like 15 million bricks . 
  ( although the credits sequence was real stop-motion . ), 
  i did adore * the lego movie * though . 
  the stop-motion-like style and faithfulness to the way minifigs actually move made it feel like the ultimate love letter to all us hobbyist lego animators . 
  i 'll admit , i teared up when it ended , because everything was just so * awesome * . 
  thank you strifey !, 
  i know you can make it look authentic using waterslide decals , but it 's not something i ever really looked into . 
  currently for sips , sjin and lewis 's custom torsos i just print them onto sticky labels , carefully cut them out and stick them on . 
  i 'll certainly look into it now , given how specific some of the yogscast character designs are . 
  it would be my pleasure !, 
  these are a blast to make . 
  ^ ( i just sent a talent@yogscast email ... ), 
  afaik there was never an official statement made about it , but it was likely due to the fact that his videos just became infested with boobs and clickbait . 
  he 's also made [ some massive jerk moves ] ( http://redd.it/28qt8d ) before and since . 
  nope , it 's not a reference . 
  it just sounds funny so they kept saying it . 
  [ ] ( / raritywut ) you mean ridge , right ? 
  there 's / r/dailydot , which is actually active . 
  benjammin did n't make it , i did . 
  he just posted it before i could . 
  the red matter bomb took about 2 weeks , and simon goes to the moon took about 1 . 
  i am planning more , but i have n't yet decided what the next one will be . 
  [ this one !, 
  ] ( http://www.bricklink.com/catalogitem.asp?p=3626cpb779 ), 
  i 'm 19 , and i started making animations when i was 12 . 
  `` milady '' [ is technically correct ] ( http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/milady ) . 
  he 's not small , just far away . 
  yes , i live a double life as a minecraft server admin !, 
  the fast track to getting good at it is to hang out on [bricksinmotion.com ] ( http://www.bricksinmotion.com/ ) . 
  that 's where the brickfilming community is , and i learned everything i know from them . 
  as for equipment , a high-quality webcam like the logitech c910 or quickcam pro 9000 is a great place to start , and there is plenty of free stop-motion software out there ( helium frog , monkeyjam ... there 's a list on bim ) . 
  there 's also / r/brickfilms , which i am a mod of , but it 's fairly quiet . 
  good luck with this noble endeavour !, 
  i 'd be happy to answer any questions in the future . 
  the compatibility tester has no bearing on how the miis interact . 
  rather , it uses their birth dates to `` calculate '' how compatible those people are * in real life * . 
  it 's just a bit of fun and does n't mean anything . 
  i love the yogpod , but is there a single giggle-worthy moment that has n't already been animated ? 
  [ ] ( / egb23 ) there 's something not quite right with baby twilight 's hand there ... 
  uh , yeah they do .
