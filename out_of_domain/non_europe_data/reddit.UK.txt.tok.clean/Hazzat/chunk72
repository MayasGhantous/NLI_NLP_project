  and he said yes . 
  it 's not unusual though . 
  type `` is [ any celebrity 's name ] '' into the google box and the first suggestion will always be asking if they 're gay .

  ` songs in the key of sips ' is by far my favourite yogscast fan content of all . 
  every song is filled with such wit and originality and i love every one . 
  it is nothing short of a crime that they go so underrated .

  yep , if you 're gon na utilise religion , you 'd better do it before your target has founded one of their own .

  [ ] ( / sbbook ) no , this is totally the opposite .

  which is way cool . 
  just because i did it first does n't mean i have ownership over any that are made afterwards !, 
  of course you can make a lego yogscast animation , i just do n't recommend calling it `` yoglego '' because then people would mix it up with my stuff . 
  i ca n't wait to see it !, 
  i am totally in love with the japanese takeover theme they 've committed to .

  shrek : the complete collection, 
  i make short animations for youtube and i 've had all manner of people tell me what to put in them ( and they usually request themselves ) . 
  i 'm in talks with the yogs , but i 'm not allowed to say too much about it . 
  10/10 layers , this is ace .

  i do n't believe the bottom half is actually attached to the top half .

   i like producing my own military with xp boosts and other promotions, 
  but if a gifted unit arrives in a city with a barracks etc. , they get the experience from it ...

  i believe it 's mainly for kids who bought a bunch of collectible minifigs and want to trade their duplicates for ones they do n't have . 
  that sounds cool !, 
  you should [ message the mods ] ( http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2flego ) about it .

  damn , this is sad . 
  ghibli were perhaps the only movie studio in the world who created films that were perfect , pure and innocent and were able to push them to some degree of success . 
  as a budding animator myself , this news leaves me worried . 
  is there still a place in the world for films like this , or will the genre be lost forever ? 
  [ ] ( / c39 ) do n't feed the trolls ffs, 
  i went to the previous two and had a blast .
