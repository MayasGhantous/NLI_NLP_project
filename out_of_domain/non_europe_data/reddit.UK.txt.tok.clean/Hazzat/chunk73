  yogbowl, 
  dude , he 's all over pretty much every episode . 
  [ ] ( #lotsofthings ) i see lots of things, 
  well , [ here 's the list of all his cameos ... ] ( http://gravityfalls.wikia.com/wiki/bill_cipher#cameos ), 
  do n't forget that sips recently had his skin remastered by / u/teutron , so he is n't as grey as he once was . 
  yeah , but i say no because it 's just messy in comparison to what we have already . 
  go to [needcoolshoes.com ] ( http://www.needcoolshoes.com ) and type in sips _ . 
  you can download anyone 's skin that way . 
  haha , this is ace !, 
  it was the first pikmin i played , and i had a blast . 
  it 's a real masterclass in what excellent game design looks like . 
  [ the whole album ] ( http://www.neilcic.com/mouthsounds/ ) is absolutely bangin ' . 
  damn i love neil . 
  [ ] ( / scootacheer ) i 'm a mod of a number of other mlp subs , and did css for them all . 
  i 'd be happy to help out . 
  if you want to !, 
  edit the url to remove the bit about annotations , and [ it becomes this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdoobqxfzp4 ) . 
  the reason it 's used on everything is because it 's based on one of lauren faust 's original drawings . 
  these official shorts are getting really weird . 
  and i have a pretty high threshold for weird stuff . 
  the chap presenting the stream said knowledge is good for promotion both science and culture . 
  the very first `` policy '' gives +10 % science , similar to rationalism . 
  [ ] ( / c37 ) such mean words ... 
  xpost to / r/brogres pls, 
  i realised my error a while after posting it . 
  i was looking at the title and thought `` that ca n't be right , the company name is n't firax ... 
  out of interest , how did you find this post ? 
  i made it ~ 3 months ago and every now and then it keeps getting a new comment . 
  i 've seen every single post that has come through this subreddit and have never seen it posted here . 
  [ ] ( / flutterhey `` hey , do n't i know you ? '' ), 
  every h4 link you add to the sidebar will become a submit button , and it looks like you 've only got two of those in the sidebar at the moment . 
  try adding more and see what happens ? 
  alright , the problem is that code you copied specifies that all the submit buttons should have a ` top ` value of 100 , except the last one which has 130 . 
  this means that all the buttons except the last are sitting on top of each other , which is why it looks like there are only 2 . 
  we 're gon na need to edit each one individually , and this can be done using ` nth-of-type ` . 
  currently , the first button , `` show us your oc '' is, 
  . side . usertext-body h4 : nth-last-of-type ( 4 ) a, 
  `` show us your art '' is :, 
  . side . usertext-body h4 : nth-last-of-type ( 3 ) a, 
  `` send in fanfics '' is :, 
  . side . usertext-body h4 : nth-last-of-type ( 2 ) a, 
  `` music '' is :, 
  . side . usertext-body h4 a, 
  by editing the ` top ` values for each one of those so they 're all different , you can stop them overlapping , and you 'll be able to see them all again . 
  awesome , it worked !, 
  thanks for your help . 
  fireax 's , of course . 
  i leave comment, 
  instead of a single thread , might it be better to create a separate `` free talk '' subreddit for yognau ( gh ) ts ? 
  i 'm thinking along the lines of what / r/mlplounge is to / r/mylittlepony - it 's a place for fans to just hang out and chat about whatever , and it 's been extremely successful . 
  it could also be an excuse to weird out less yog-relevant posts [ like this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/yogscast/comments/2d2467/ross_would_be_proud/ ) , unless you do n't really consider those to be a problem . 
  the answer to both is a mystery ~, 
  whose idea was the spinny flairs ? 
  they 're the best addition in ages . 
   particular markets , or places where there 's a lot of independent ( ish ) clothes shops, 
  it 's a hub of markets and indie clothes shops , niche styles and subcultures . 
  i think it 's just what you 're looking for . 
  yeah , i have the uk one and they only ever say `` my < object  ! '', 
  this game has some weird regional differences . 
  hi again everyone !, 
  as some of you already know , i 'm the guy who animated this . 
  i really want to say thanks to everyone who left kind words when i posted this myself a few weeks ago . 
  you gave some of the nicest feedback i 've ever experienced , and it was truly lovely . 
  i have n't been able to work on much yogscast stuff lately due to other commissioned work , but i 'll be getting back to it really soon . 
  animators like me do n't really `` join '' the yogscast properly , they 'll just upload my stuff if it 's good and i keep making it . 
  i have n't actually spoken to anyone at the yogscast besides their community administrator . 
  that said , i think this entitles me to my own page on the yogscast wiki ... ? 
  lol, 
  i was paid a certain amount , and given the promise of exposure off the back of it . 
  while i agree being mentioned half-way down the description is n't great , i did manage to get one of the first comments so i 'm at the top of the comments section . 
  ** edit : ** oh , do n't forget the annotation at the end that links to my channel too . 
   the yogscast having more views is a win/win for both parties . 
  i do n't actually get a cut of the video 's ad revenue , just a fixed amount before the video goes up . 
  apparently they used to do it like that , but the admin work of keeping up with how much a specific video was making got too much . 
  i totally understand why they ask for the originals to be removed though . 
   they probably got threatened with a `` let us reupload your video or we 'll get it taken down for violating our copyright '' . 
  there was no threatening , the removal was just part of the contract i signed . 
  it was all very friendly !, 
  they do n't commission me , they just offered to upload what i had already and said if i make any more they 'd be interested in those too . 
  my original upload from a few weeks ago ? 
  [ yeah it is . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjwrnqqonbm ), 
  not if your parents are ** dead ** !, 
  i uploaded this animation and another , similar one to [ my own channel ] ( https://www.youtube.com/channel/ucn1-syqnc2ojly2nuz0-z_a ) a few weeks ago , which is where many / r/yogscast people saw them first . 
  as part of the deal with the yogs , i had to remove them from that channel , which left some people quite confused . 
  as with every irk you might have with vanilla civ , [ there 's a mod to fix it ] ( http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=192953436 ) . 
  amazing !, 
  now we just need to find the agrarian skies intro tune ... 
  ooh , it 's so close !, 
  i went through all the artist 's other works and none of them were what we 're looking for , so there 's still no dice . 
  that 's just the end of the same song . 
  the first hearthstone game was n't streamed , but today 's one will be . 
  / r/tsundereshreks, 
  he 's been smiling like a mother in every picture . 
  what a guyyyyyy . 
  [ this might explain it . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjmovgzvtza ) no guarantees . 
   they could still build one and keep it in the basement or something just for fun, 
  that did n't go too well for blackrock castle . 
  it 's turps , it 's kinda hard to replicate his skin in lego so i got as close as i could .
