  i thought his face was still a good likeness though !, 
  i wanted to represent everyone who 's going to insomnia next week , as i 'm going too . 
  i had to leave out the fyreuk guys though as their skins are just * too * weird ... 
  yep !, 
  i just wanted to get the insomnia 52 attendees represented first . 
  i was tempted to scribble on her face with a purple marker ... 
  what is your favourite thing a fan ( or fans ) has ever done for you ? 
  no , that 's the all-encompassing term for `` pure '' art that is simply art for art 's sake . 
  ` traditional ' is the word we 're looking for here . 
  i heard the convention centre was literally left in ruins . 
  it 's fun seeing a bunch of physicists unknowingly puzzling over a mystery from a cartoon . 
  [ man , the old yogscast was weird . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cblbgj2efde ), 
  i 'm guessing/hoping there will be a bigger , mod-endorsed thread on the subject closer to the time . 
  we 'll be able to organise a bit then !, 
  if previous conventions are anything to go by , there will definitely be a signing . 
  not only that , but there 'll be a dedicated `` yogscast zone '' of the convention centre . 
  that $ 100 's name ? 
  albert einstein . 
  [ from the yogscast store . 
  there 's also a [ less pixelly version ] ( http://hatventures.spreadshirt.co.uk/walrus-vision-a19764742/customize/color/231 ) in the hat films store . 
  it 's not live , this is just a recording from 5 days ago . 
  excuse me mister ` merican , but [ you appear to have drawn our flag upside down ] ( http://greatbritishmag.co.uk/uploads/gb-flag-right-wrong_blog.png ) . 
  `` upside-down '' is the technical term . 
  when i asked what moments people wanted to see animated , * everyone * said the red matter bomb . 
  so , uh , expect a lot of people to respond with that . 
  hi again everyone , i 'm the animator who made this !, 
  i posted this here a few weeks ago , and thanks to your support the yogs guys picked it up for the main channel . 
  kinda related , i 'm going to i52 this weekend and i 'll be bringing my lego guys for photo opportunities or whatever . 
  [ details here ] ( http://zoot101.tumblr.com/post/94831500714/extended-lego-yogscast-family-i-will-be-bringing ) ... 
  cut me some slack , i had to trim 35 minutes out of a 37-minute video !, 
  i posted this here a few weeks ago when i first made it , but now it 's been reuploaded to yogscast lewis & simon !, 
  i 'm mentioned in an annotation at the end , and my channel is pretty high up in the description , so i think it 's all okay . 
  besides , animating for the yogscast is a labour of love . 
  ridge never actually said anything out loud during the ordeal , he spoke only through text chat ... 
  it 's kinda hard to animate the dialogue of someone who does n't say a word . 
  is it [ how to : flame leviathan ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cblbgj2efde ) ? 
  absolutely !, 
  who knows what the future holds ? 
  [ here 's the video . 
  ] ( http://izismile.com/2010/09/28/the_show_must_go_on_at_all_costs.html ) he is reading the news on the radio . 
  [ i found the comic . 
  totally seconded . 
  they really are as warm , funny and genuine in person as they seem on screen , and i was truly privileged to be able to chat to them today . 
  gtfo with your dreck subreddits, 
  nice job winning a copy of trials , i managed to get one just by being really tall and catching it . 
  / r/gravityfalls welcomes you !, 
  we do n't really want links encouraging people to watch the show illegally in the sidebar , sorry . 
  ( but it 's still okay to post about it . ), 
  dude this is currently on the front page of / r/sips at least 4 times , keep up !, 
  i always thought it was like you 're saying `` i am merely a settler , i need a lot of help '' or `` i am a deity , bring on the biggest challenge '' . 
  i ca n't help but feel that link should have gone [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28fvxyquloq ) instead ... 
  y u do dis habbro, 
  please stop linking to mobile sites . 
  welp , i guess i just spent a whole minute watching a video of a guy picking his nose . 
  the update kicked in when i started the game , and now it says `` version 2.0 '' on the games main menu . 
  i 'm in eu , so that might count for something . 
  # 11 here in the uk , or # 7 each if you buy them separately . 
  i 'm not sure if it 's my favourite , but i do like it and tend to vote for it online . 
  i did have to retry the mirror special cup more times than i 'd like to admit though ... 
  it 's the top difficulty level in which - you guessed it - everything is mirrored . 
  get a gold trophy on every 150cc cup to unlock it . 
  i 'm pretty sure they cover both . 
  i do n't think i 've lost * that * many races to the ai ... 
  it 's been known for some time that the music disc `` 11 '' has some secrets in it when you visualise it - namely , [ a creeper face and the numbers 12418 ] ( http://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2013/48/1385435755-decouvertedisque11-bsidro.png ) . 
  this video claims that by combining it with the disc `` 13 '' , you get a map of a building of some kind , likely a stronghold . 
  kim and hannah met their doppelg\u00e4ngers too , there are no pictures of it . 
  expect that in one of kim 's insomnia vlogs !, 
  the guy who made it probably saw a lot of details we ca n't , as it looks like the video got pretty compressed somewhere along the line . 
  perhaps a series of pictures would have made for better presentation ... 
  i 'm not sure the commentary added much . 
  turn the inside of your head into a zoetrope . 
  superhero movies . 
  i find them really boring . 
  alright there smartypants , [ that 's the name of the guy who made the discovery ] ( http://redd.it/1shmuk ) . 
   post anything involving naturally generating falling sand here . 
  i can tell you now that no , it does n't !, 
  i ca n't seem to find out ... all i found was that this is a screencap from [ a trailer ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0p8m0jmsthc ) for a documentary ( at 1:44 ) . 
  i just created it . 
  let 's make it happen . 
  and i shall return the favour !, 
  please do this admins !, 
  the place is looking really swish . 
  nice work fixing it up , guys !, 
  that 's me , thank you !, 
  as kim hinted in the video , stay tuned to duncan 's channel . 
  it 's nintendo 's r&d department going nuts again . 
  this is making me glad i never upgraded to an xl , though . 
  my launch-day 3ds is looking a bit battered and could do with an upgrade ... 
  i have no idea where the `` english people have bad teeth '' stereotype came from . 
  after all , dental care is free on the nhs . 
  when playing tomodachi life , you need to learn to calm your inner control freak . 
  you ca n't force stuff to happen , and some things you were aiming for may never happen at all . 
  just let the miis do their thing and enjoy the mayhem . 
  sounds like a great plan sjin , i 'm looking forward to it all . 
   lewis does n't cheat, 
  that 's the yogscast guarantee \u2122 !, 
  yep , she mentioned that at the i52 q&a . 
  yeah it 's true , he 's been a veggie for a long time ( source : i was lucky enough to eat dinner with the guys on the saturday of i52 ), 
  i noticed every one of these games contains `` mild violence '' .
