  who knew art academy : sketchpad could be so intense ? 
  the artwork , the dialogue , the dramatic music i heard playing in my head as i read it ... all perfect . 
  one of the best . 
  i love this !, 
  for those who want to know what the tanks actually look like :,

  i 'm glad you like my recreations !, 
  i use a site called [ bricklink ] ( http://www.bricklink.com/ ) to search for and order in specific parts , so most of the time is spent waiting for those to arrive . 
  but yeah , i put a great deal of thought into each one . 
  these are far from my first brickfilms ( which is the technical name for lego animations ) - i 've been doing it for 7 years !, 
  i 've finished two more since the bomb , but the contract i signed with the yogscast forbids me from saying anything about them . 
  you 'll just have to wait and see ... 
  mmm , tastes good . 
  it was a boring day in the summer holidays of 2007 ... 
  i was 12 , browsing this fairly new website called `` youtube '' , clicking through mac vs. pc adverts which were all the rage at the time , when i stumbled upon [ a lego parody ] ( http://youtu.be/_3wdaykgwn4 ) . 
  it looked really cool , so i watched another and another and decided `` i want to do this '' . 
  i told my dad , who set up a makeshift animation desk and his old camcorder in my room , and that day i made [ my first ever brickfilm ] ( http://youtu.be/zj3p4kqj9qa ) . 
  i 've already made a fair amount of money off it , thanks to youtube ad revenue , commissions ( including some from lego themselves ) and of course the yogscast , but actually being able to do it as a career is unlikely . 
  i 'll be going to study animation at university at the end of september though , so i 'll hopefully be doing something similar in the future . 
   where should i start ? 
  **[bricksinmotion.com ] ( http://www.bricksinmotion.com/ ) !!!!, 
  ** i ca n't recommend that place enough . 
  the community is super-friendly , knowledgeable and taught me everything i know . 
  heck , even if you are n't into making brickfilms and just want to watch some it 's worth a visit . 
  check out the [ staff favourites ] ( http://bricksinmotion.com/films/# | p = 1 | d = | s = | v = 1 ) , there are some real masterpieces of cinema in there . 
   would you ever join the yogscast and run an official yoglego channel ? 
  * would * i ? 
  that would be the coolest job ever !, 
  * will * i ? 
  currently i 'm just making the animations of my own accord , then sending them over , and the same goes for previous `` yogscast animated '' animators . 
  when i stop making them , the contract ends . 
  it gets extremely fiddly sometimes , especially when there are multiple characters moving at once and i have to keep track what each of them are doing in my head . 
  [ this shot ] ( http://i.imgur.com/4o7fbkh.png ) , for example , was an absolute nightmare . 
  simon 's tickling a pig , duncan is mumbling to himself , lewis is just looking around , then a sheep pops into the frame ... plus [ the set ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wqrupya.jpg ) was really wobbly . 
  i think i had to reshoot that 2 or 3 times . 
  the truth is i do accidentally bump stuff . 
  a lot . 
  i 'm just pretty good at moving everything back to exactly how it was before i bumped it !, 
  i try to minimise is by securing everything loose down with blu-tack . 
  that stuff truly is a brickfilmer 's best friend . 
  i ca n't really talk about yogscast moments i may want to do , because that might result in spoilers for the future !, 
  i prefer original things over recreations for the most part , so i do n't have any others planned . 
  as weird as it may seem , i really dislike star wars/batman/spiderman / superman/whatever brickfilms . 
  like , you 've got a whole world of cool films you could make , why limit yourself to someone else 's ideas ? 
  i wish i could take a picture , but they 're scattered all over my floor ... 
  i have 4 boxes that look similar to [ this ] ( http://www.electro-tech-online.com/imgcache/5519-94131.gif ) ( the big ones , not the small ones ) with the pieces sorted by colour , plus a few sets i 've built and a couple of tubs that were kindly donated by friends of friends , but are kinda useless because they 're not sorted . 
  over a 7-year period , accumulating that much does n't sting too bad on the finances . 
  i mentioned [ bricks in motion ] ( http://www.bricksinmotion.com/ ) in another comment , and it is absolutely the place to go to improve . 
  watch some really good brickfilms , share your stuff to receive feedback and you should start improving really fast !, 
  you 're in a good place , so i think the next step for you is to try to shake the `` these are just lego guys on a desk '' feeling . 
  everything could just be a bit more ... cinematic . 
  watch [ some really good animations ] ( http://bricksinmotion.com/films/#%7cp=1%7cd=%7cs=%7cv=1 ) and work out what separates yours from theirs , then try to copy what they do right . 
  that 's how i learned !, 
  * camera : a really old camcorder that used to belong to my dad . 
  specifically , a sony dcr-pc105e . 
  i do n't recommend it because it 's so old , but it 's got manual controls for everything which is the important thing . 
  * software : boinx istopmotion 2 for animation , adobe premiere pro for editing . 
  * hardware : i do it all on a macbook pro . 
  the top recommendation for brickfilming cameras nowadays is an hd webcam like the logitech c910 , or if you really mean business a dslr or hd camcorder . 
  surely if we 're parodying the typical ducks/horses question , it should be * 100 * minifig-sized simons ? 
  it 's have to be the simon-sized minifigs . 
  a hundred little guys could get into all sorts of crevices you would n't want them in . 
  yeah , that 's me !, 
  i originally tried [ this ] ( http://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/ipvnpwcg-uidkzbu.png ) for the banner ( it 's the bottom of the title screen postcard ) , but the black and orange theme ended up making the whole thing not seem very gravity falls-ish . 
  i can try pages from the book , but it 's really hard to find any `` perfect '' screenshots of it ... 
  yep , as people seem to like the new one . 
  i 've just got ta finish tidying some stuff up first . 
  i 'll talk to the other mods to see if they want to archive it somewhere , as they 're the ones who made it . 
  [ the banner is there for me ... ] ( http://i.imgur.com/4eadiow.png ) are you sure it did n't just fail to load ? 
  i see the issue now , i 'm pretty sure it 's an intended feature in res though . 
  that bright blue could be eye-burning against the black late at night . 
  after the bomb animation went live , i was pretty surprised by the number of people who were like `` what series is this from ??? '', 
  [ ] ( #puppetdipper ) you 're scaring me !, 
  i like it , the middle one specially . 
  i 'll see what i can do . 
  24 days ago , apparently . 
  yeah , i 'm still a bit torn about what to do with the ups and downs . 
  i was thinking of keeping bill for both and having the downvote cross his eye out like in [ this image ] ( http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20140428041604/gravityfalls/images/e/e4/shorts_the_hidden_page.jpg ) , but it 's tough to make that look good at such a small scale . 
  just to clarify , the new series wo n't be beyond earth . 
  they already started recording it and be is n't out yet . 
  no , it 's a rewrite of [ a famous copypasta ] ( http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/ken-sama ) . 
   ###### i understood le reference !!!, 
  i 'd like to think this is the spiritual sequel to ' [ ross hornby aka 3oh ! 3 ] ( http://hatfilmsthings.tumblr.com/post/95731630501/just-take-this ) ' . 
  [ the yogscast survey ] ( http://www.yetanotherreviewsite.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/millennial-gaming-large.jpg ) found most are 13-21 . 
  the insomnia crowd was overall pretty young , not just the people at the yogscast panels , due to the prominence of minecraft . 
  the `` ck '' is silent . 
  it 's pronounced `` coh-burn '' . 
  yeah , reddit does n't support adding sound files . 
  thank you , that 's me !, 
  i 'm just working out the emotes because they all broke for some reason . 
  the release schedule is just one of the many mysteries that surround this show . 
  turps was asked this in the insomnia q&a , and he said it 's something they 'd definitely like to do , but not yet . 
  i swear this gets more jpeg-y every time it 's posted . 
  i thought that might be it , but i do have code that covers that further up . 
  it looks like this :,
