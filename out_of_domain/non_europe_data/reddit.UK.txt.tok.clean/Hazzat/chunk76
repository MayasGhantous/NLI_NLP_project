  it just seems to be getting ignored for some reason . 
  that was it !, 
  thank you so much !, 
  hello crazy kid . 
  thank you !, 
  i brought the gold one to insomnia , [ and kim signed it ] ( http://zoot101.tumblr.com/post/95470684499/kim-signed-my-luggage ) . 
  [ flux buddies # 33 - door to door salesman ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r57b8cvpn9w ), 
  the clip i used starts at 12:21 . 
  hah , i 'm glad you spotted that !, 
  i was looking through my collection for a paper for duncan to read , stumbled upon the daily prophet piece and thought `` this is perfect . '', 
  nah , the arrangement is still the same as it ever was i 'm afraid . 
  i just asked the mods for this flair because it was becoming kind of a pain to reintroduce myself every time lego stuff was mentioned . 
  according to people in the youtube comments , you 're not alone ... 
  tomorrow ( monday ) , 9pm . 
  well [ i 've got my own wiki page ] ( http://yogscast.wikia.com/wiki/harry_bossert ) lol . 
  if you hover over where it says `` redditor for 2 years '' on his profile , you can see the exact date and time he created his account . 
  and it does indeed say 7 september . 
  [ will strife paid a visit to hannah and nilesy . 
  ] ( http://youtube.com/watch?v=y6jfbasdtmu ), 
  thank you !, 
  they took about a week each , with the exception of the bomb because that one was a bit longer than the rest . 
  as others have said , that 's not fan art . 
  it was drawn by either the super-talented / u/teutron or / u/nina-serena , who are official yogscast artists . 
  if you 'd like an insight into how they go about it , you should watch the [ forest of doom ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28fh54thdgo&amp;list=pl3xznmghpynp-gmglfpl4-iz6ipagpczn ) series from the christmas livestreams , where teutron quickly draws and colours stuff live . 
  someone requested a version where he shoots upvotes . 
  [ here you go . 
   wtf did i just see, 
  it 's gone very quiet over there . 
  i demand to be paid royalties, 
  thank you . 
   it took a heck of a lot of work ... 
  rule 2 , dude . 
  let 's not forget that mojang was offered a cut of the ad revenue on every minecraft video on youtube ( which would be an * insane * amount of money ) , and turned it down . 
  [ yogsquest 2 !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iiy-nz7kai ) you 're missing out if you have n't seen it yet , bud . 
  one day we 'll get oyster cards too , pal . 
  while it 's definitely better to watch in order , i think you 'll be fine if you do n't . 
  as long as you save the season finale ( gideon rises/dreamscapers ) and any season 2 episodes until last , it should all just about make sense . 
  welcome to gravity falls !, 
   21 - 20 - 29 - 28 - 27 - 17 - 16 if that means anything . 
  it does n't - the a1z26 cipher does n't result in numbers any higher than 26 . 
  [ ] ( #gf 09 ) as if it could get any * more * sad ? 
  / r/filmmakercirclejerk, 
  in general , [ the windmill does n't really make up for the production it costs to build it ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/2bs4xr/discussion_windmill/cj8fqi1 ) , and the early production boost of settling on a hill is likely to serve you much better . 
  thanks for all the laughs ben , and for being such a cool dude at insomnia . 
  here 's hoping the next insideyogtowers guy will be able to do just as good a job . 
  [ ] ( #kermit ) ** ban this sick filth **, 
  if one civ is so culturally influential over another that their happiness gets completely crippled , some cities will start revolting . 
  it requires some serious influence though , i 've only seen it happen once . 
  [ dick assman ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y39l6v3b_ly ), 
  but walrus baggin ' is the great hatter past-time !, 
  try / r/bristol !, 
  yeah , but just think of the upkeep costs ... 
  the decoded end-of-episode cryptograms can be found [ here ] ( http://gravityfalls.wikia.com/wiki/list_of_cryptograms ) ( but do n't scroll too far down - spoilers ! ) . 
  there is n't one specific question that encompasses the whole mystery of gravity falls , but there sure are a lot of questions that make it up , especially at the start of season 1 . who wrote the journal ? 
  where does stan 's door behind the vending machine go ? 
  what 's with the triangle guy , and why is he everywhere ? 
  what significance does the wheel that flashes up at the end of the title sequence hold ? 
  i guess if you had to make it one question , it would be `` there 's something out of the ordinary going on in gravity falls . 
  but what is it exactly ? '', 
  this is from the latest episode , s2e4 . 
  [ here 's a guide for maximising your tourism and influence . 
  ] ( http://www.carlsguides.com/strategy/civilization5/culturalvictory.php ), 
  stealing cities through influence is n't a strategy you can count on , as it generally requires not only huge tourism on your part , but also for your target civ to have very little total culture and for them to have chosen a different ideology . 
  in general , you 'd need several civs to be influential over them to bring on the crippling unhappiness that would result in cities revolting . 
  it 's cool when the stars align and it does happen , but do n't rely on it . 
  #golly , you are so full of questions !, 
  ** who is carla ? 
  earlier in that episode ( ` the hand that rocks the mabel ' ) , the commercial for gideon 's tent ends with the narrator speaking really fast . 
  slowed down , he is saying `` carla , i 've always loved you but i never had the guts to say it . '', 
  ** is stan trying to stop bill cipher ? 
  we do n't know . 
  ** why is puberty the greatest mystery of all ? 
  anyone who 's been through it knows the answer to this one . 
  ** who is aoshima ? 
  [ this is aoshima . 
  ] ( http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120719190959/gravityfalls/images/b/b5/s1e5_mabel_hallucination.png ) it is named after john aoshima , who directed a bunch of season 1 episodes . 
  ** what is in the vents ? 
  the head of wax larry king . 
  ** why is the konami code in the wheel of intrigue ? 
  the show is full of crazy codes , why not include a famous one like that ? 
  scrolls and cobalt ( the other game you 're thinking of ) were n't notch 's projects , they were being made by other mojang team members . 
  notch has tried to make his own games since minecraft ( see [ 0x10 ^ c ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/0x10c ) ) , but he never really seemed satisfied . 
   i saw a couple weeks ago someone discovered purchasing a settler would empty the food reserves of your city . 
  that was just a bug in the mod they were using . 
  it 's not part of the game . 
  both that and the fact that you get 3 culture per turn for opening tradition anyway mean the monument is n't really worth it . 
  goddamn i love songs in the key of sips so much . 
  every track is fresh and original , with an interpretation of the series i never saw coming . 
  your stuff is awesome , dude . 
  i 've lost count of the number of times i 've listened to this since it was first posted here . 
  it 's not comic sans , it 's the sphax bdcraft font, 
  i 'm pretty sure he 's from ontario , given that [ he would n't stop talking about it in this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78yaameakq0 ) . 
  combine that with the pantheon for +2 [ ] ( / science ) science from cities with a city connection , and every city you found starts out * really * strong . 
  as long as there 's a fair amount of coast , carthage is one of the best civs for playing wide . 
  yes that is me !, 
  thanks for your kind words . 
  well originally i put the videos on my own channel , and a few days later i got an email from one of the admin guys at yogscast saying that he thought they were great and offered to put them on the main channel . 
  i said yes , obvs .
