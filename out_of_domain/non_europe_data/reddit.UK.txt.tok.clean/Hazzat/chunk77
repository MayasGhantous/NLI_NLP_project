  i 'm doing an ama on / r/yogscast tomorrow evening ( uk time ) , so stick around for that if you want more details !, 
  i seriously doubt that modding will be outlawed in favour of paid dlc . 
  it 's not like the current dev team is getting kicked out - jeb _ , dinnerbone etc. 
  will still be working on it - and i 'd like to think they know the importance of the modding api . 
  yes , this is my favourite too . 
  it sums up the whole game pretty nicely . 
  why not watch ... [ the animation ] ( http://youtu.be/rfhmlza6fs0 ) ? 
  i 'm not allowed to say !, 
  the yogscast release schedule is very secret . 
  for a long time i thought they just really liked yoghurt . 
  nope , his ` real vlog , best vlog 's are just about channel updates . 
  i was planning to do one here for a while , but one of the / r/yogscastkim mods got excited by the idea and asked me to do one there first . 
  i hope that 's okay ... 
  yeah i get that and i did feel a bit awkward , but the mods here were up for it so i thought i may as well go through with it . 
  i promise i 'll stop talking about it after this !, 
  it 's a custom design printed onto a sticky label , which i cut out and stuck to his torso . 
  it 's based on [ this piece ] ( http://www.bricklink.com/catalogitem.asp?p=973pb525c01 ) . 
  also : / r/specart, 
  during the pretty boring summer holidays of 2007 , i was browsing this new site called youtube and clicking on all the mac vs. pc ads which were super-popular at the time , when i landed on [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3wdaykgwn4 ) . 
  being 12 , i thought this looked like the * coolest thing ever * , showed it to my dad and asked if i could do it too . 
  he set me up with a makeshift desk and an old camcorder , and i made [ my first animation ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zj3p4kqj9qa ) . 
  it was a few months later that i discovered there was a whole bunch of other people dedicated to these things ... 
  for the yogscast ? 
  i ca n't say how many are still in the queue , but i 'm hoping to squeeze in one more before i move out and go to uni at the end of next week . 
  i just have n't found the perfect yogscast moment for it yet ... 
  ** [ 2012 : a year in bricks ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3ucgewfoco ) ** ( which was a commissioned film for the lego company ) was a crazy challenge . 
  i figured i 'd need an olympic stadium for all the bits set at the olympics , so i contacted [ bright bricks ] ( http://bright-bricks.com/ ) who had built a to-scale olympic stadium earlier in the year and hired it out for a few weeks . 
  i 'd never before worked on a set so big i had to climb over it to get anything done !, 
  ** [ megaphone ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6djxyr6b9g ) ** is the film i 'm most proud of , which is why it 's the first thing you see on my youtube channel . 
  a few months after i put it on youtube , it was picked up by the santa barbara film festival , and i got to fly out there and have a true ` red carpet ' treatment . 
  it was awesome . 
  i am really bad at building ... :(, 
  i try to cut down the time i spend in pre-production , as i 've lost too many projects in the past to the lack of motivation that kicks in if i leave it without doing anything for too long . 
  as such , i 've had to master the art of quickly building sets that contain * just enough * detail so as not to look boring . 
  so i try not to spend more than an hour on each . 
  welcome to the world of brickfilming !, 
  [ bricks in motion ] ( http://bricksinmotion.com/ ) is absolutely the place to go if you 're starting out . 
  the folks there know * everything * , and i learned it all just by participating in discussions and sharing my films there . 
  in terms of equipment , the current recommended camera is the logitech c910 , as it 's hd , can focus really close and has full manual controls ( which is extremely important for stop-motion ) . 
  the logitech quickcam pro 9000 is also great , but is a bit older and does n't do hd . 
  for software , check out bim 's [ free software list ] ( http://www.bricksinmotion.com/forums/topic/68/the-free-software-list/ ) to find the stuff that 's right for you . 
  it will be worth buying some good frame capture/editing stuff if you continue with it , but for starting out the free stuff is great . 
  my floor is covered in the stuff , so i step on it several times a day . 
  years of training have meant i am now immune to the pain so many fear . 
  ^ ( * thanks for the kind words !, 
   how are you good ? 
  make film  receive feedback  repeat, 
  6 ' exactly !, 
  i was never really into it before i started making these films . 
  sure , we had a big box of it when i was growing up , but it laid untouched for many years before i decided to pick it up again . 
  i love noodles , which is partly why i 'm such a fan of kim . 
  i tried approaching them a long time ago about animations through the talent@yogscast email , but never heard back . 
  so i went and made my animations anyway to see what would happen . 
  a few days after i originally uploaded the bomb to my own channel , i got an email from ben at the yogscast asking if i would like to have my videos up on the main channel . 
  i said `` yes '' and you know the rest . 
  i 'd love to to a hat films thing , but their minecraft skins are just too weird for lego !, 
  that said , i do have a friend who likes 3d printing who has offered to custom-make a walrus head and a weird beard for me ... 
  nope , but i was paid a certain amount per video . 
  apparently they used to give a cut of ad revenue , but the admin work of keeping up with how much the animator was owed was too much . 
  oh come on , as if there 's even a contest !, 
  i 'm not a purist though , and will use mega bloks if they 're appropriate . 
  i like to challenge myself to hide one in every film ... 
  i 'm glad you like my stuff so much !, 
  it means a lot . 
  for that scene , i popped off duncan 's head and stuck it on a big blob of blu-tack that was inside the crate . 
  ( so much blu-tack goes into these things , you do n't even know . ), 
  i actually took a behind-the-scenes picture while i was making it : http://imgur.com/z37etl1, 
  the torsos were custom-designed by me , printed onto sticky labels and carefully stuck to the minifigs . 
  the rest is various actual lego i picked up through [ bricklink ] ( http://www.bricklink.com ) ( < 3 that site ) , with the exception of sjin 's beard which came from [ here ] ( http://www.brickforge.com/store/product.php?productid=18502&amp;cat=0&amp;page=1 ) . 
  yes !, 
  [ bricks in motion ] ( http://www.bricksinmotion.com/forums ) is the place to go to learn all this stuff . 
  i would love love * love * to do [ the end of the pointless button 2 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-s8lkfxsoru#t=762 ) , but i think a huge medal ceremony with the queen present is a bit beyond my scope . 
  maybe one day i 'll work out how to pull it off !, 
  the initial investment depends on how much lego you already have !, 
  if you have a bunch sitting around to begin with , it 's a fairly easy to get started - you need only a webcam , some lamps , a desk and a ( free ) animation software . 
  i do n't really have any tips on how to build your collection if you do n't have one as i never had to do that myself , try asking the [ bricks in motion ] ( http://www.bricksinmotion.com/ ) people . 
  the time takes depends entirely on how complex the video is !, 
  when it came to the yogscast ones , it roughly came to 1 minute of animation = 1 week of work . 
  this was pretty tricky stuff though , simpler animations as much faster . 
  editing is super-fast compared to live-action stuff , as i do n't need to cut any footage out !, 
  sound design can sometimes take a while , but nothing compared to the time spent animating . 
  i animate in boinx istopmotion , and edit in adobe premiere pro . 
  the biggest challenge for these animations in particular was just finding the right moments to animate . 
  the hard part is always deciding * what * to film rather than actually filming it - building the set , setting up the shot , deciding what movements you want the characters to make etc. 
  i 'm afraid . 
  i have no shortcuts for that , as that 's the challenge that makes filmmaking so rewarding . 
  as for a magic touch that makes your animations suddenly better , learn to `` ease '' in and out - gradually speed up the start of the movement , and slow it down towards the end . 
  it makes everything much more believable . 
  good luck with your animations !, 
  bim and / r/brickfilms will always be there to help if you need feedback . 
  * i 'm from the uk, 
  * lewis in a bee costume, 
   are you pursuing an education in animation or filmmaking ? 
  yep , i will be going to study animation . 
  all digital stuff though , which will be totally new . 
  there are very few places that offer courses in specifically stop-motion , but the people at the universities who interviewed me all understood the parallel between the mediums . 
   what do your parents think of everything ? 
  they have been very supportive , and love what i do . 
  they 'd never heard of the yogscast before i made my first animation for them , but they can see the appeal . 
  my mum has been planning a holiday to san francisco , so i showed her [ the 64th most interesting thing ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw3pustszxk ) video , and now i 'm pretty sure she 's a turps fan .
