   are you into other forms of animation too or strictly brickfilms ? 
  i 've only ever done lego , but in order to build a portfolio to show the universities i 've had to break into the world of art - specifically life drawing . 
  i do n't really feel that confident with it yet , but it 's certainly been fun and i 'm gon na get a lot of practice over the next few years . 
  i also really hope to mix digital effects with stop-motion to achieve scale i could n't before !, 
   do you have a `` hero '' in the genre ( past or present ) that you try to emulate ? 
  head to the [ bricks in motion film directory ] ( http://www.bricksinmotion.com/films/ ) and pick `` staff favourites '' from the drop-down box . 
  when it comes to lego animation , films like that are what i look up to , and i totally recommend browsing through them . 
  ( notable picks are [ henri & edmond ] ( http://www.bricksinmotion.com/films/view/3027/ ) , [ robota ] ( http://www.bricksinmotion.com/films/view/21/ ) and [ unrenewable ] ( http://www.bricksinmotion.com/films/view/369/ ) . ), 
  as for animation overall , i am a ** huge ** fan of studio ghibli and can only hope to make something as beautiful as their films one day . 
  and as controversial as it may be to say , the * my little pony : friendship is magic * cartoon played a big role in pulling me towards animation as a career . 
  yes every sunday we are required to sit around the table with a picture of the queen , drink tea and sing the national anthem, 
  monster fighters !, 
  the yogpod has been animated to death though , and there have been so many great yogscast moments in recent history that i 'd rather honour those . 
  i may do hat chat at some point though . 
  i found them several years ago when shadow of israphel was going strong . 
  i watched an episode or two of that and could n't work out what on earth was going on , so i decided to start from the beginning and watched every bluexephos minecraft video over the next week . 
  as for how they found me , [ that 's answered here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/yogscast/comments/2goa7u/i_am_zoot101_the_guy_who_makes_the_yogscast_lego/ckl175l ) . 
  yeahhh , while it 's not nsfw this stuff does n't really belong here . 
  coming soon : how to flame leviathan animated !, 
  the storm kept me up all bloody night . 
  old man sleeping on the green, 
  ca n't help but wonder what he 's seen, 
  ads and reddit gold . 
  although the site has never actually turned a profit , and still operates in the red . 
  [ here 's an album from when a / r/civ reader gave that a go . 
  unfortunately you ca n't research anything until you properly found a city of your own . 
  come and join us in / r/gravityfalls !, 
  it also rhymes with ... schmipper !, 
  blimey , the scarf is huge !, 
  with all that gold you stockpiled , there 's no excuse for not buying up tiles to prevent that happening , assuming you saw him coming . 
  as a windows phone user , this is all i 've been hoping for since the acquisition . 
  i 'd imagine that 's just their typical formatting for titles of things . 
  this is likely to be the last of my yogscast animations for now , as i 'm moving out to go to university at the end of next week . 
  i really want to make more in the future though !, 
  thank you yognau ( gh ) ts for being so nice about every one i 've made , it 's really been unlike anything i 've ever experienced . 
  his minecraft skin and youtube avatar both have hair , so it makes sense y' know . 
  that 's just vanilla minecraft bud . 
  just drag a 2x2 square with the left mouse button and it makes 4 even stacks . 
  when you get an explorer visit via streetpass , you get to look after them for the night . 
  if you give them a bath set , they have their bath in a big steel drum . 
  [ dirtquest # 32 ] ( http://youtu.be/vkwxbglnfma ), 
  [ the wiki page ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/sips/wiki/banner ) could do with an update , 
  vote brigading is explicitly against the rules , and subreddits have been banned for encouraging it in the past . 
  [ message the admins ] ( http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2freddit.com ) about it and they 'll decide whether they want to bring the hammer down . 
  alex does n't check this sub , [ but he did come to answer many questions ] ( http://redd.it/1kgq85 ) a while ago . 
  as for how to get a job like his , study character animation at calarts . 
  that 's clearly not a selfie though . 
  i did it mom , i updated the wiki page with all the details . 
  it 's `` pinecest '' and you 're not allowed to post it on / r/gravityfalls . 
  kw14 is n't their alias - kw are their initials and '14 is the year in which they drew the picture . 
  i removed this . 
  please no pinecest !, 
  [ ] ( #kermit ) ** ban this sick filth **, 
  i do n't think it would reveal much that 's new , a lot of the text in there is just very small . 
  look at me mom , i look like james brown, 
  just bought my ticket for the thursday !, 
  that 's actually my birthday , so this should be fun . 
  [ ] ( #angrybill ) ** noooooooooo ** ^ ( okay then ), 
  that 's definitely the [ badwagon ] ( http://imgur.com/bsrvnsj ) ( which is already in the game ) . 
  got my ticket for thursday !, 
  it works for me , but that site definitely has some weird behaviours about hotlinking . 
  replaced it with an imgur link now !, 
  from what i 've seen , the process for getting your animations featured on a yogscast channel involves you making the animations and posting them on youtube * first * , then hoping you get approached ( and if they 're good , you will ) . 
  i made the lego animations and that 's how it worked with me , and i know other guys like foxel , wordwizard and best of sips animated were posting their videos on their own channels before getting picked up . 
  if you go through with it , good luck !, 
  your preview screenshot looks very cool . 
  i think of [ this song ] ( http://youtu.be/b40mt8r6vo4 ) . 
  there is n't really a specific email to write to about this stuff . 
  there 's talent@yogscast.com, but they do n't seem to deal with fan animators . 
  so yeah , your only option is to follow the same path as the rest of us . 
  even if you do n't get contacted , you 'll still get a bunch of yognau ( gh ) ts visiting your youtube channel so you do n't have much to lose . 
  is there much info on that ? 
  all i can find is the date of the next episode , and that does n't make for much of a list . 
  i 'd be up for it anyway . 
  [ ] ( #dipcheer ) ... has got it goin ' on ... 
  i can confirm that it is indeed my birthday !, 
  i love it !, 
  aww , thank you guys . 
  it 's there now , although i may pretty it up later . 
  the gravi-team falls tumblr tends to post adverts for upcoming episodes in the week before they air , so that may come in handy ... 
  that 's soos 's cursor !, 
  [ here 's an interview with him . 
  ] ( http://hypervocal.com/entertainment/2011/meet-michael-clancy-the-young-lawyer-from-that-nu-thang-viral-video/ ) he took his sudden internet fame with a really good sense of humour . 
  man , i love the yogscast civ series . 
  it 's the reason i bought the game ( and all the dlcs ) . 
  [ ] ( #dipponder ) this tempts me to edit the css . 
  the `` nightwalk '' they 're talking about is [ this assassin 's creed unity site ] ( http://www.beta.projectwidow.net/ ) . 
  on the [ ac : u site ] ( http://www.beta.projectwidow.net/ ) i mentioned in my other comment . 
  this video is on the second map , on the bridge crossing the river . 
  he 's an astrophysicist who does a very good job of bringing the wonders of science to the masses . 
  reddit is in love with him . 
  [ nausic\u00e4a , of the valley of the wind ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nausica%c3%a4_of_the_valley_of_the_wind_ ( film \\ ) ) . 
  i did work experience at the ps home office in london a few years ago , and they talked about some interesting problems they faced with the japanese players . 
  for example , they came up with a vending machine that only let you buy items as gifts for other players . 
  it was fine in the west , but the japanese culture of gift-giving means whenever someone gives you a gift , you have to give one back of equal or greater value . 
  then vice versa , and it starts spiralling out of control ... 
  there 's [ a thread ] ( http://redd.it/2g5f2k ) for emote suggestions !, 
  ( it 's in the sidebar . ), 
  the important thing with emotes is that they have good expressions rather than just being of a specific character . 
  i doubt this one would get used much .
