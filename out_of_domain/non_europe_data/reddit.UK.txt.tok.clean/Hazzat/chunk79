  [ yes . 
  [ ] ( / wonderwink ) any chance you could add a shoutout to / r/equestriagirls in your op , theelinker ? 
  done !, 
  after you submit it , you 'll see a little grey link under it which says `` spoiler '' . 
  click that !, 
  yeah , emotes are case-sensitive !, 
  ( which is why your one in the post did n't work . ), 
  how did i miss this before ? 
  yeah , i find i prefer the more down-to-earth ghibli films too . 
  i still think about * the wind rises * every day , it was just that incredible . 
  [ ] ( #bill ) oh , the scalene triangle ... 
  [ a rare recording of harvey singing . 
  ] ( http://youtu.be/m5twt69i1lu ), 
  by being a mod !, 
  / u/gravityfallscipher requested that all the mods have a special flair , so i added this . 
  i think it 's perhaps a little more eye-catching ( pun intended ) than it should be , but it 'll do for now . 
  i 've got ta say , it took me a while to spot goldie in there . 
  are you kidding ? 
  you ruined * everything * !, 
  as a stop-motion animator myself , [ this gag ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fydmiuh.png ) hit a little too close to home . 
  i believe they just drew it themselves . 
  the one in the actual title sequence is an original drawing too , rather than a font . 
  i 'm gon na have to remove this . 
  rule 1 , dude . 
  do n't forget that ai dee would have required luka to be there too . 
  two vocaloids would be too much for the general public to handle !, 
  i liked the song choice . 
  it had a `` welcome to this new world '' feel about it , it was n't too alien and j-poppy and it was relatively new . 
  sure , a lot of people would be left scratching their heads , but the point is to just get her name out there so people recognise it . 
   miku was way too quiet and was tuned really badly . 
  i think you 're overestimating how picky the general public are about vocaloid tuning . 
  the song was chosen because it 's the theme for the ny and la expos , which she was there to promote . 
  i thought overall it was a great performance , and ` sharing the world ' was much better than ` world is mine ' ( which is ooooold ) or anything by mitchie m ( which is too j-poppy ) would have been .

  hot damn , this is ace . 
  the video is great too . 
  almost all of it comes from [audiomicro.com ] ( http://audiomicro.com ) .

  well , the comprehensive ' [ list of decoded cryptograms ] ( http://gravityfalls.wikia.com/wiki/list_of_cryptograms ) ' is linked in the sidebar . 
  it could use a bit of the good old [ mlg papers , please ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfk_f2jwp9y ) . 
  it is great , which is why it 's been posted here twice already !,

  regarding lore , i think a stronger distinction needs to be made between the fictional yogscast lore ( which is n't that concrete anyway ) and the actual factual pages . 
  right now , [ the page on honeydew inc. ] ( http://yogscast.wikia.com/wiki/honeydew_inc . ), 
  reads as if it 's a real company , and the same goes for just about every similar article . 
  as for trivia , i agree those sections are really unhelpful . 
  `` sensible '' trivia ( birthdays etc. ), 
  could be moved to the box under the person 's photo , \u00e1 la wikipedia . 
  that 's where i would expect to find such info , anyway . 
  i just got a pre-roll ad for conquest !, 
  with a teutron-animated simon telling me there 's a new yogscast channel and i could win a ps4 . 
  the [ crazy golf series ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z_ug6xshrc ) on the main channel has been promoting it too . 
  i ca n't begin to imagine the pressure in designing for a subreddit dedicated to designers . 
  it looks good , nice work !,

  i think it 's just the after-credits scene ?

  i was wondering what this year 's christmas album was gon na look like if parody songs were off the cards , but now that might not be an issue ... ? 
  the first time i discovered this , i was absolutely cracking up . 
  and crying at the same time . 
  get 'em while they 're young . 
  i removed this 'cause spoiler in the title . 
  for shame !, 
  revamp how ? 
  you 're being a bit vague . 
  nothing specific right now as i just started uni and do n't have much time for lego stuff , but i definitely plan on making more in the future and i 'm always noting down potential clips to animate whenever there 's a cool moment in a yogscast video . 
  stay tuned !, 
  this is n't actually in the game , i 'm afraid . 
  [ here 's a list ] ( http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/splash ) of all the title screen splashes that * are * in the game . 
  huh , i guess / u/gravityfallscipher did n't post one at the usual time . 
  [ i made one now ] ( http://redd.it/2keb8i ) , i just hope he does n't get mad at me . 
  it 's a promotional drawing by the episode 's director , sunil hall . 
  i got it from the [ gravi-team falls tumblr ] ( http://gravi-teamfalls.tumblr.com/post/100609189838/dontkicktrees-hey-everyone-the-first-episode-i ) . 
  [ ] ( #gideon ) i 'm just trying something different , let me know if you do/don ' t like it !, 
  as long as applicable stuff gets posted on gravi-team falls , yeah !, 
  i wanted to do this for the last episode , but they did n't post anything in time . 
  dude , flooding the thread with this many comments is just spam . 
  i know you 're excited , but for goodness ' sake calm down . 
  i 've removed it all . 
  credit goes to [ this guy ] ( http://biroking.deviantart.com/art/sips-487845073 ) . 
  it 's okay to be hyped and act a bit silly , but the number of crazy comments he left was absolutely absurd . 
  several people reported him for it too . 
  [ ] ( / imawesome ) alright !, 
  i guess [ the spoiler-embargo countdown ] ( http://redd.it/2hlih4 ) starts now .
