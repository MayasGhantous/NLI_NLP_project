  yes , it 's a great show . 
  yes , it 's something `` everyone '' can enjoy . 
  but not literally ** everyone ** loves a good cartoon . 
  max gilardi 's explanation for bronies was that it was that it appeals to their inner child , and not everyone is so in touch with their inner child . 
  * and that 's okay * , most people wo n't fall head over heels for an excellent animated show in the same way you wo n't become obsessed with whatever they 're into . 
  your main hang up seems to be with brony `` haters '' as opposed to people who just do n't get it . 
  that 's a terrible term to use when referring to people who dislike anything , it labels them as if disliking your thing automatically makes their view not count . 
  as for it being a surprise , * being a teenage/20-something year-old male who likes my little pony is weird * . 
  even to be a big fan of any cartoon at this age is a bit out-there . 
  and the irony is a big draw for a lot of us , the reaction is priceless . 
  so revel in the faces people pull and the disbelief they show . 
  it 's a lot of fun that way . 
  put it on a train , send the train through a [ tunnel ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/channel_tunnel ) .

  i 'm neither a handsome nor pretty follower , why does n't he want to know how i 'm doing ? 
  although jawmes808 did use the joke very badly here . 
  if it was accompanied by an amusing , appropriate gif then perhaps . 
  but yeah , most of the time it should stay in its own sub . 
  have a sort of filtration setup , where builders need to prove themselves before they can build in the `` main '' world . 
  the voxelbox does this and so do we on [ our server ] ( http://www.brohoof.com/ ) . 
  it means that crummy builders leave ( because they failed the test ) and good builders will want to stay . 
  it would help to have some sort of theme , goal or direction too , rather than just a plain freebuild server . 
  you can collect tall grass with shears . 
  i love this sort of stuff !, 
  if only / r/minecraftconspiracies was more popular . 
  assuming all the things in the frames are in the same arrangement as the last screenshot of them posted by dinnerbone , that 's the definitely the frame sprite with a new look . 
  you do n't need to raid a village for that sort of treatment !, 
  it 's not just with zombies breaking doors , i 've seen the `` cracked air '' happen when breaking a block in a certain way in multiplayer ( although i ca n't for the life of me remember what that certain way was ) . 
  i 'm pretty sure that 's what 's happened here , given that you can see the bottom of the cracked air block . 
  they probably did it while cutting down a tree . 
  that was part of the anvil update . 
  along with a higher height limit and cubic chunks , a ton of room for new blocks was added . 
  you know you can edit that , right ? 
  i have mine set to [ +10000000 ] .

  it 's like apple.mov done badly .
