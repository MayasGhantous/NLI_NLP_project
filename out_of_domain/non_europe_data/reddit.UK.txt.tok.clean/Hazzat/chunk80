  the reason there are big delays in the series is because sips only records one episode at a time , so that between them he can see what people are saying . 
  that 's super cool and i would n't want it any other way . 
  you forgot the second parenthesis , bud . 
  aw man , that 's the coolest thing ever !, 
  yeah it is , sorry !, 
  [ ] ( #blindeyeguy ) [ july 4 , 1982 ] ( #spoiler ), 
  damn , this is retro !, 
  i love how every shot feels so alive in spite of its jerkiness . 
  this is the sort of film brickfilmers starting out today can learn a lot from . 
  is it just me , or are there not enough apple flavours in chocolate stuff ? 
  apple + chocolate normally is a killer combination . 
  mmmm . 
  it 's on dailymotion and you can stream it . 
  ( links in the sidebar . ), 
  all the parody songs ( [ screw the nether ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqelqrcnw6g ) , [ big girl ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwzyltw6rgy ) etc. ), 
  were restored a couple of weeks ago after [ a change in uk copyright law ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-29408121 ) made them 100 % legal . 
  so it 's totally possible that we 'll see another charity album of parodied christmas songs !, 
  this is amazing !, 
  are you planning to ink and colour it ? 
  [ the grand finale of the pointless button ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-s8lkfxsoru#t=770 ), 
  [ kim the door-to-door salesman ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r57b8cvpn9w#t=723 ), 
  i borrowed some stuff from this when working on [ some lego sirs of my own ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fb2zexh.jpg ) ( still wip !, 
  [ team double dragon refuses to heed the warnings ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndv8pdb8b1o&amp;list=uuz3edpzni_qmubg2fihw5tq#t=801 ), 
  [ 5 fingers . 
  ] ( https://33.media.tumblr.com/f1ac2acb51b18c9dc9b4c767883dc48c/tumblr_ne4r5sddhy1rpcneyo1_500.jpg ), 
  the earliest of these paintings was from 2009 , and adventure time premiered in 2010 ( although [ the original short it was based on ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxjxzboufny ) was finished in 2006 ) . 
  ( just kidding , you guys look awesome ! ), 
  [ here 's a better picture . 
  ] ( http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20141028052913/gravityfalls/images/1/13/s2e7_young_mcgucket.png ) 5 fingers on both hands . 
  i do n't have any experience with it myself , but [ there 's a little talk about it at the start of this video ] ( http://youtube.com/watch?v=u9fd9crdgdm ) . 
  painting details at such a small scale is nigh-on impossible ( although you 're welcome to prove me wrong !, 
  ) , so you might want to look into printing custom designs onto sticky labels or decals if you 're picky . 
  it 's not as smooth as it looks - there was definitely an after effects filter applied to blend some of the frames together so it looks a little odd . 
  still , it 's not a bad animation . 
  smith is a really inspired songwriter . 
  i 'm working my way through the old hat chats and at one point he talks about how he read a book of last words from prisoners on death row , and he wrote a song based around it ( but never finished it ) . 
  it 's in the sidebar \u0ca0_\u0ca0 - , 
  he did them on livestream already . 
  i think the episode 4 recording was deleted but [ here 's episode 3 ] ( http://www.twitch.tv/sips_/c/4473246 ) . 
  please , nintendo , this is all too much so fast ... 
  well spotted !, 
  they are all references to [ joe pitt ] ( http://gravityfalls.wikia.com/wiki/joe_pitt ) , a ( former ) director and character designer on the show .

  we 've all become too much like sips - just saying the same thing over and over until someone does something about it . 
  / r/gravityfallstheories exists , but it 's pretty quiet to say the least ... 
  i 've got ta say that even though i was a bit unenthused by the episode when i read the blurb ( blendin is a bit boring , no secrets were going to be revealed ) , it was actually * excellent * !, 
  i loved it . 
  i like the idea , but it seemed pretty clear that soos 's dad was actually traveling the usa . 
  it 's possible that the postcards from him were just a cover-up , but i doubt it . 
  yaaay , now i can swap my hastily-made sidebar poster out for something much prettier !, 
  this is called the [ bootstrap paradox ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bootstrap_paradox ) , and its inclusion was definitely intentional . 
  the writers would n't just overlook a detail like that !, 
  i teared up at this part . 
  the whole movie was so bittersweet , with miyazaki so in love with his craft , but pessimistic about the future of ghibli , japan and humanity . 
  the dvd is out in december , although i was lucky enough to watch it in a cinema yesterday . 
  it 's cool , but whatever method you 're using to resize the image makes it look really pixellated . 
  yeah !, 
  it was sweet and sad and funny and beautiful . 
  i have this tendency to idolise ghibli and their work , so it was nice to see miyazaki and co. portrayed as just people . 
  i 'm actually reading starting point at the moment !, 
  i 'm really loving it , and it feels incredibly relevant to my current studies as an animation student . 
  i 've written to the / r/iama mods . 
  i 'll update the sidebar when i get a response !, 
  they said it 's being rescheduled . 
  nope !, 
  my experience is that endless open borders requests in v are because they want to send missionaries in . 
  that 's what happens if you spawn next to boudicca , anyway ... 
  yeah , but the loss off attrition can be pretty killer . 
  duncan 's already been doing it for a few weeks . 
  it 's inevitable !, 
  [ anyone can stream on youtube as long as they have no copyright strikes .

  [ oh , those careless shoals ... ] ( http://youtu.be/r48bttrsq9s ), 
  c'mon dude , do n't make us do the hard work when there are plenty of resources that will answer the question for you . 
  most of the sidebar here is dedicated to helping out people who are new to civ . 
  the goat , bee and cow were a nice touch . 
  it 's listed in the sidebar , under the blendin 's game poster . 
  neither this game nor borderlands are cel-shaded !, 
  they just put outlines on everything . 
  the folks who make the show do n't really visit here ( or , if they do , they do n't let us know ! ) . 
  you could try writing to the [ gravi-team falls ] ( http://gravi-teamfalls.tumblr.com/ ) tumblr , which is run by the show 's crew , or directly contact any of the crew members they 've reblogged through tumblr or their personal websites/email addresses . 
  awesome photo !, 
  you could also share with / r/japanpics . 
  rule 2 !, 
  an intermission during last year 's [ forest of doom ] ( http://youtube.com/playlist?list=pl3xznmghpynp-gmglfpl4-iz6ipagpczn ) livestream . 
  this was their design for the flag of yogscastia . 
  contrarian ? 
  in april 2013 , [ this image ] ( https://i.imgur.com/a40whi7.jpg ) started doing the rounds , and a lot of people got upset because it looked like a major spoiler had been leaked . 
  alex tweeted that he was `` fuming '' , then deleted his tweet shortly afterwards . 
  from then until ` society of the blind eye ' everyone was questioning whether it was real , and if mcgucket really was the author . 
  at a panel yesterday , alex revealed that he had planted the image himself just to mess with people . 
  that 's expert-level trolling !, 
  * edit : i got the date totally wrong *, 
  the panel was n't recorded , or if it was the recording has n't surfaced yet . 
  he tweeted [ something to the same effect though ] ( https://twitter.com/_alexhirsch/status/536054960018825217?p=p ) . 
  [ there was someone who did this !, 
  yeah , i 'd agree with that . 
  so many times in the film he questioned `` whether it was all worth it '' . 
  woah , i had a little panic moment when i saw all the posts about it and thought i totally forgot to get the post up on time !, 
  it 'll go up when i was planning to post it ( in a few hours ) because then more people are around and the post gets more upvotes .
