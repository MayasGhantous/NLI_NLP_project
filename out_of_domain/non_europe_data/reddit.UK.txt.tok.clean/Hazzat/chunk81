  i had to remove this due to it plugging a piracy site . 
  nah , she and fiona are moving in together !, 
  she talked about it a lot in [ her latest vlog ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0htgmnzf2a0 ) . 
  yeah , that 's better phrasing . 
  i 'll change it !, 
  what you 're describing is basically what they do on / r/gameofthrones , where any post that is n't tagged with its relevant episode is immediately removed by a bot . 
  that * could * work here , but as we 're not as bustling as there any mass-removal of posts could be pretty buzzkill-y . 
  i thought the fact that spoiler tags are only required for 24 hours after a new episode makes it pretty clear intuitively what 's being spoiled . 
  these early releases are pretty rare , and i 'm not sure it 's worth rejigging the whole system just to acommodate them . 
  people do n't like lots of extra rules to follow !, 
  nah , the art is all by tootz and nina nowadays . 
  if you 're looking to contact us , [ message us directly ] ( http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2fgravityfalls ) !, 
  would n't that spoil stuff for a lot of people ? 
  a lot of people ( myself included ) consider the end panel to be a spoiler . 
  the current episodes of dirtquest were filmed way back in summer bud , i think you 're a little late for suggestions . 
  ever since i started studying animation properly , i 've been kinda amazed by the amount of reference people use for everything !, 
  movements , poses , character designs , layout art ... * everyone * at every level has something open in another window to copy off , so do n't worry about it . 
  i get what you mean though about learning the different parts ( which are called contact , recoil , passing , high-point !, 
  ) , so check out the animator 's survival kit for the basics on all of that . 
  the olaf/lester parallels are too perfect !, 
  to counter what rgp said , barely any yogs music is done in-house !, 
  almost all the music in their videos is from the stock music site [ audiomicro ] ( http://www.audiomicro.com/ ) , and occasionally [ incompetech ] ( http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/ ) . 
  there 's no way to find a track you 've heard without just typing in words related to it and hoping you get lucky though . 
  getting a new piece of music written for every series would be a lot of work !, 
  for some examples , [ here 's the hole diggers theme ] ( http://www.audiomicro.com/jazz-big-band-saxophone-once-in-a-lifetime-royalty-free-stock-music-530163 ) and [ here 's one they used to use for outros a lot ] ( http://www.audiomicro.com/revelation-royalty-free-stock-music-882473 ) . 
  it looks great , i love it !, 
  although [ the sidebar is a bit screwed up ] ( http://i.imgur.com/n71isak.png ) with res . 
  the new [ yogscast live ] ( http://www.youtube.com/user/yogslive ) channel !, 
   hannah has stated that none of the members of the yogscast have had any sort of contact from yohimitsu for a long time . 
  in the 2013 christmas livestream , lewis confirmed that yohi is `` just gone '' . 
  thanks for letting us know !, 
  i worked with the local mind when they came into our sixth form a few years ago and i loved what they did , so i 'll be sure to send a donation their way . 
  no , it wo n't help . 
  please delete this post , as giving the guy attention is just feeding the troll . 
  let them remain unknown . 
  edit : looks like it was removed, 
   cards against humanity, 
  the guys have already been instructed to try and curb their swearing as it 's a charity stream , so i do n't think that would be a great choice !, 
  it 's gone without a hitch so far !, 
  although they did have to disable city states , barbarians and ruins and limit themselves to five players ... 
  datlof did not hold . 
  he said it was his first time playing multiplayer , too !, 
  they 're certainly similar , and there may have been some inspiration , but i doubt the time enforcers are a direct reference . 
  they 've returned in more recent episodes , you need to catch up !, 
  it 's actually the title of the song though . 
  it 's in the sidebar bud , under the * love god * poster . 
  there will be no new episodes until january . 
  this made me itch my nose ... 
  dude , [ it 's in the sidebar ] ( http://www.myranium.com/ ) . 
  [ it 's a very good likeness !, 
  of course , it 's very unlikely that this is a direct gravity falls reference , as there are many giant statues of [ paul bunyan ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/paul_bunyan ) across the usa . 
  you 're a little early - her birthday is on the 15th of december !, 
  the guys have been plagued by streaming issues and are often unable to play online due to someone attacking their connection . 
  it totally wrecked the #hakimon stream . 
  people are dicks . 
  they found [ the channel ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/bluespathi ) , but there are no videos on it to be seen . 
  it is * very * hat films . 
  i think the implication was that everyone in town ( except the society members , gideon , and those that work at the mystery shack ... ? ), 
  has had their mind wiped at some point . 
  [ episode 32 - gecko sporgy ] ( http://hatchat.podbean.com/e/episode-32-gecko-sporgy/ ), 
  i love pictures of london from the air !, 
  [ here 's one i took . 
  you 'd think sjin , of all people , would know the words off by heart ... 
  is anyone else drawing along with teutron ? 
  i did last year back when i was first learning character design , and it was awesomely helpful . 
  they 're a whole bunch of different tracks from [audiomicro.com ] ( http://www.audiomicro.com/ ) . 
  end polio nose !, 
  no , so do n't buy it yet . 
  i just posted this so people could hear it . 
  [ that 's also on bandcamp !, 
  ] ( http://yogscaststudios.bandcamp.com/album/carrot-for-a-nose ), 
  to quote simon on the stream last night ... 
   `` here at the yogscast , we have standards . 
  they 're very low standards , but we have standards . '', 
  pottymouthed as they may be , the yogs do have stuff they would rather not have said on the streams , and they 've already been asked to curb the swearing as it is all for charity . 
  i was in a similar position to you about two years ago !, 
  i only started drawing when i was about 18 , which is much later than most artists around me , so hopefully this advice will be helpful to someone who has n't been drawing their whole life . 
  life/figure drawing is essential in order to become a good character artist , and when i went to take some courses absolutely everyone recommended a book called * drawing on the right side of the brain * . 
  it 's like magic - after doing some of the exercises in the book , it was as if suddenly a light came on in my brain and i could just about draw anything in front of me pretty accurately . 
  if you 're looking to start exploring the big world of art , i 100 % recommend that as a starting point . 
  as for tablets , it 's not that big a deal which one you get , but do n't start with a cintiq . 
  you wo n't need it until you get really good , and a simpler , cheaper wacom is much better for learning . 
  but start with traditional media !, 
   what advice can you give to a person that once they draw something that looks awful , they lose all hope and give up ? 
  ( this is heavily me ), 
  a familiar feeling ... 
  i had been told that getting good at drawing involved practising for a long time , so i would sit down at my desk and doodle in my sketchbook for several hours , and when i looked back , the stuff at the end was no better than the stuff i drew at the start . 
  i thought `` what the heck , i just practised for a long time and did n't get any better ! '', 
  it was only later that i realised `` a long time '' is months/years , not a few hours . 
  this skill requires you coming back to it regularly , mixing and matching your own ideas and studying the work of others to see what makes it work ( i spent all of last night 's stream [ drawing along with teutron ] ( http://imgur.com/a/gbtly ) ) . 
  i first took a course in character design last december , and it 's only * now * that i 'm starting to see results i 'm happy with . 
  it requires some real dedication to get through the tough `` i ca n't draw ! '', 
  period , but once it clicks it becomes a blast . 
  ** [ never give up !!, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxgrhd_iwue ) **, 
  and if you ever need some quick advice , head over to / r/learnart . 
  the folks there are pretty helpful . 
  humans/organic forms are complicated , but less so when you break them down if to separate parts . 
  struggling with hair ? 
  gather some pictures of well-drawn hair , try copying them and pick apart why they look good .
