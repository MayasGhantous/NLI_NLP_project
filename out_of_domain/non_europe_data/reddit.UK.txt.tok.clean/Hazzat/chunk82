  fill a whole page with hair !, 
  and another if you 're not satisfied !, 
  struggling with eyes ? 
  do the same on another page . 
  there 's no shame in copying other people 's work when you 're a beginner - there 's no way you 'll work out what you 're doing wrong unless you compare it to what other people are doing right . 
  i read a lot of advice like what i just said back then and got a bit annoyed by it , but trust me , the day it all falls into place is coming !, 
  it was famously said that ` every artist has thousands of bad drawings in them , and the only way to get rid of them is to draw them out . ', 
  keep doodling , keep studying - just a little every day - and you 'll get there . 
  yes , that 's it !, 
  thank you !, 
  many more 21st birthdays , of course . 
  happy birthday kim !, 
  i do n't have the game , but apparently the gnomes jason and shmebulock are in it ? 
  alex voices all the gnomes . 
  ^ ( edit : spelled ` shmebulock ' wrong ), 
  i 'm a mod of / r/brogres ( which is all about shrek ) and every now and then we get someone who walks in asking about gains . 
  the community is always happy to recommend onion-based diets . 
  you ca n't edit reddit posts , silly . 
  you forgot to include a link , buddy !, 
  [ he eats alot ? 
  in the interests of fairness , you should ask the same question in / r/phineasandferb . 
  [ here are all the silly pictures of lewis and sips ] ( http://imgur.com/a/qqloh ) for your photoshopping pleasure . 
  arrived without a scratch !, 
  even the box is in pretty good shape . 
  thanks for the streams , they 've been a blast to watch . 
  pssh , who plays 2048 anymore ? 
  not me , no , i got over that a long time ago ... 
  [ ] ( #gf 28 ) oh , it seems i just spent an hour playing this . 
  [ the pyramids from above . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/3iwguud.jpg ) it 's such a surreal view . 
  aw man , that 's a bummer . 
  i know they asked us to remove them from the subreddit sidebar a little while ago , and i guess this is why . 
  get a nice , hi-res image of it , post it [ here ] ( http://redd.it/2g5f2k ) and maybe your wish will come true . 
  all cartoon writers are big jokers . 
  i would n't take anything they tweet as fact !, 
  no , this is / u / ___ deadpool ______ . 
  you 're thinking of / u / ______ deadpool ______ . 
  different people . 
  thanks for showing this !, 
  i just got a pebble today , so i went and grabbed [ the same face ] ( http://imgur.com/jeqrxud ) . 
  [ alien blue is the official reddit app . 
  ] ( http://www.redditblog.com/2014/10/the-alien-has-landed.html ), 
  it 's in animated form [ here ] ( http://youtu.be/czton59flri ) !, 
  all japanese cities look like that . 
  there 's not much point building something fancy when that increases the risk of it being knocked down by an earthquake/volcano/typhoon / war etc. 
  it 's not publicly available , i 'm afraid . 
  you could just go to [ the artist 's actual website ] ( http://deep-dark-fears.tumblr.com ) instead of reading an article about it . 
  watchcartoononline is not at all legal , lol . 
  there is n't really a way besides buying the dvds or , if you plan on watching a lot , a box set . 
  ghibli have n't caught up with all these new-fangled ways of distributing movies , so the only other options are hoping they get shown on tv or that a cinema near you is showing them ( there 's a place here in london that does studio ghibli sundays ) . 
  maybe at some point they 'll get up to speed , but not yet . 
  [ here 's a guy recounting his experience with one . 
  ] ( http://youtu.be/3htrrab_s9o ), 
  well done on that - i was always too scared to try mouth animations . 
  visual effects are tricky to get right !, 
  no but a fan club started up in / r/rick . 
  cheers bud !, 
  [ yep !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cuoent6lg4&amp;index=1&amp;list=plchxcoallby41ggai682lvm6rcp0whdt0 ), 
  gave me chills . 
  just so you know , all your etsy posts are getting spam filtered by default . 
  reddit does n't like them !, 
   are you saying reddit 's code spam filters etsy links, 
  yep , it 's their robot that 's doing it . 
  i 'm okay with the posts . 
  [ it looks like etsy links are generally allowed ] ( http://www.reddit.com/domain/etsy.com/ ) , so you must be doing something wrong . 
  i do n't know what though . 
   what sorts of things do you have to deal with here ? 
  very little , people are pretty well behaved and we are n't very strict . 
  rarely someone will post fake synopses for new episodes , or start a fight , but we do n't remove swearing and stuff because that 's pretty accepted on reddit as a whole . 
  that 's not the community 's call to make . 
  contact moringmark himself !, 
   but is n't his goal to stop their proliferation ? 
  nah , his goal is to get attention . 
  and it looks like it 's working . 
  just so you know , [ the 10 % rule was updated ] ( http://redd.it/2oamgp ) a little while ago , meaning comments also count towards offsetting self-promotion . 
  that 's why folks like / u/jimkb are allowed to post so much of their own stuff . 
  it 's a rule . 
  [ it 's the first rule . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/rules/ ), 
  it says this on the submit page :, 
   ** trying to contact the gravity falls team ? 
   this is n't the place to do it !, 
  alex and friends do n't read this subreddit ( or if they do , they keep very quiet about it ) . 
  this is just a place to share stuff with other gravity falls fans . 
  how the changes work with older versions of minecraft ? 
  will the changes show up in 1.7 , for example ? 
  hazzat , of course !, 
  yeah , but it does n't last all winter . 
  it 's still special . 
  no no , the detachable rails are to be used to defend yourself from the stampeding crowd fleeing from the fire . 
  whack people over the head , and escape with your life !, 
  or / r/amiiboswap . 
  this is right , no one pays for this ad . 
  it was put up for free via the admins ' / r/pimpmyreddit service . 
  dude , you need to hang out in some better subs if you think that . 
  sidebar updated !, 
  thanks for pointing that out , i fixed it . 
  i always thought he 's still in the vents was foreshadowing something .
