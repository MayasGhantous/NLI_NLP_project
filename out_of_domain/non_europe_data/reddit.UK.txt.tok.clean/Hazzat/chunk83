  yeah , it 's down for the moment because [ scarlet_j is busy ] ( http://redd.it/2s43ma ) . 
  removed . 
  seriously , dude . 
  this just in : the ai cheats like crazy !, 
  you do n't need to learn japanese to see tokyo . 
  the folks there do n't speak much english , but they 'll do their darndest to help you out anyway . 
  yep , there 's way more english around nowadays . 
  the public transport has station names in both english and japanese , and the people there do their best to be helpful in spite of the language barrier . 
  [ sips did n't coin the phrase ya dingus . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asvog03hyly#t=138 ), 
  my explanation is that ` we love the king day ' is an annual event , rather than just one day . 
  what you did was so great that they dedicate a national holiday to your honour . 
  although i 'm not sure why that would trigger a growth rate increase . 
  you could always pick it up from the eshop . 
  wander over yonder !? 
  heck yeah , i love wander over yonder !, 
  oh , and gravity falls too . 
  the other folks here have offered some great advice !, 
  i 'll be starting japanese classes soon , so i 've been watching a lot of j-vloggers and listening to their tips . 
  here are some of my favourite videos :, 
  * [ learning japanese : 9 tips for success ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfcc00zmpzi ) ( this guy makes fantastic videos ), 
  * [ a week in japan - day 5 : learning japanese ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abmvse9a3b8 ), 
  * [ how to learn japanese ( online & free ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enz8dnybmly ), 
  you ca n't learn purely through youtube , but watching people like this is great for picking up tips , methods and keeping it fun . 
  i stuck this in the sidebar because it 's a big deal !, 
  i had to go and check mine ... 
  it 's not quite 10m , but i think it 's still nothing to be sniffed at !, 
  contacts , dude . 
  i 'm in my first year of an animation degree in the uk , and i 've been looking for cool internships lately . 
  i know a guy in tokyo who interviewed me for wowow a few years ago about a film i made , so i decided to shoot him an email to ask if he knew of anything i could do . 
  he was extremely happy to help and will be forwarding my cv and details on to people he knows sometime in the next few weeks . 
  bear in mind that i reached out to him in january when i 'm looking for internships over the summer . 
  openings are always competitive and you have to get on it really early , and that 's especially true if you 're applying overseas . 
  you 're way too late for this holiday i 'm afraid , but i guess you 've got time to start asking around and meeting people before the next one . 
  oh no , it looks like i messed up !, 
  i 'll have to ask the mods to fix it . 
  when it is fixed , you just click ` edit ' in the sidebar next to where it says `` show my flair on this subreddit '' . 
  seconded !, 
  i have his ` amphigorey too ' on my shelf , and it 's great . 
  was n't this service already around in / r/pimpmyreddit ? 
  what will happen to that ? 
  sounds good to me !, 
  it 's true !, 
  i 'm half-swiss and took german in secondary school so that i would be able to speak to my relatives . 
  imagine my surprise when , at the family reunion this past summer , i could n't understand a single word being said ... 
  awesome , thank you !, 
  it was my first pikmin game , and i loved it . 
  it feels like a perfect piece of polished miyamoto game design . 
  definitely recommended . 
  / r/negareddit, 
  the `` about the same as itv '' stat got me . 
  never let it be said that new media does n't matter . 
  this sounded attractive , so i went and looked it up ... [ suddenly it does n't look so attractive . 
  [ entries are submitted on twitter with the hashtag #gftoys 2015 . 
  amazing work !, 
  this is seriously stylish . 
  i particularly like the ` flux you ' on the rocket . 
  now he just needs to get verified on youtube lol, 
  sometimes voting arrows are hidden from non-subscribers to prevent abuse and vote-skewing from people who disagree ( eg / r/pcmasterrace ) . 
  in this case , you can just click ` subscribe ' and they 'll show up . 
  listen carefully and you can hear the sound that plays when you try to select something that 's not available . 
  so it looks like they at least tried to pick him . 
  my mum would buy massive packs of ~ 200 creme eggs from costco , and that would keep me and my siblings going for months . 
  asda 's measly packs of 5 just are n't the same . 
  not in the complete guide , but he 's there if you hover over the tabs in the sidebar . 
  [ ] ( #dipponder ) i should probably update the complete guide . 
  there 's a guy in [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6ogt46tsgu#t=8m9s ) who managed to get very close to tokyo by requesting to be placed in one of the three prefectures around the city . 
  so if you really want a certain city , do that . 
  ( the [ whole playlist ] ( https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=plcdb0d161c5f6c138 ) of videos is pretty much essential watching before applying to jet , too . ), 
  but there 's no guarantees , it 's a lottery , and you 're much more likely to find yourself out in the countryside . 
  i live in the uk , so i 'm normally fast asleep when the episode actually airs . 
  i think it 's nice to post it a little early so people can share speculations , and get hyped together . 
   originally i thought three . 
  that may be too many though . 
  perhaps 2 and a movie . 
  im more interested in quality than quantity . 
  but i suppose anything can happen, 
  oops , my bad !, 
  that was me trying to be fancy . 
  should be fixed now . 
  it 's not a bad idea , but i just do n't think we 've got enough people here to warrant it . 
  it works in bustling communities like / r/mylittlepony , but i think it might just fall a bit flat if we tried it . 
  i 'd be willing to give it a shot if enough people think i 'm wrong though !, 
  ^ ( this is your cue to reply to this comment if you disagree ), 
  [ here 's a countdown . 
  they did n't read the rules :, 
   avoid linking to any sites that make money from hosting the episodes . 
  we understand not everyone can watch the show on disney xd , but these sites should not be rewarded for hosting someone else 's work . 
  removed !, 
  read da rules !,

  we understand not everyone can watch the show on disney xd , but these sites should not be rewarded for hosting someone else 's work . 
  got any other suggestions ? 
  i 've been looking to replace `` fallers '' in the sidebar with something better ... 
  i like this idea !, 
  / r/civ does something similar , and it works . 
  i get the feeling there may be another row or two below the triangle which have n't been revealed yet ... 
  they linked to one of those watchdubbedcartoonsandanimeonline.biz.ru sites . 
  do n't worry , i know your inivisonweb site is alright . 
  which makes her initials pen ... what could it mean !,
