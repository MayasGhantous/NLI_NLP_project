  [ and in case you do n't get the reference ... ] ( http://youtu.be/up863eqkgui ), 
  it was listed in different places under different titles . 
  sometimes ` noir ' , sometimes ` mystery ' , sometimes ` manor ' , sometimes ` mansion ' . 
  i went with what was on the gf wiki . 
  [ ] ( #gf 03 ) the number of people who do n't get [ the reference ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up863eqkgui ) makes me sad . 
  she 's mentioned it a few times on reddit , including [ in her q&a ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/yogscastkim/comments/2uiz1i/kims_qa_thread_1/co8x757?context=3 ), 
  `` on wednesdays , we wear pink . '', 
  1 ) sub box !, 
  or if i have n't been on youtube for a few days i 'll go straight to the channel . 
  2 & 3 ) i watch mostly on mobile , so end slates do n't mean much !, 
  for long-play series i 'll go through the playlist , especially if it 's split between two channels like flux buddies . 
  4 ) i do n't think i 'll ever get tired of minecraft stuff , but variety is the spice of life . 
  5 ) yes , go and `` borrow '' hat films 's layout !, 
  the current layout works , but a nice mix of videos and playlists is nice on the eyes . 
  i 'm really digging the solo videos of random games lately where you can just waffle on about whatever !, 
  removed . 
  no nsfw please . 
  the autodesk site has [ a guide ] ( http://knowledge.autodesk.com/customer-service/account-management/software-downloads/download-methods/education-community-download-methods ) to what the different download methods do . 
  it 's linked on the download page , so i 'm not sure how you missed it . 
  i know the guy who made this , and he had to do a bit of apologising when he realised what the article on the newspaper actually says . 
  first of all , do n't count on becoming a youtuber as a job !, 
  it is incredibly tough . 
  most professional youtubers ( including almost all of the yogscast ) were pursuing another career whilst doing youtube on the side . 
  knowing how to edit videos is important , but most editing programs are pretty intuitive and can be picked up quickly . 
  the real hard part of being a successful youtuber is not actually producing the content , but understanding social media , knowing how to game the algorithms behind it , jumping on what 's popular , networking and collaboration , nurturing a community and making sure people keep coming back . 
  it 's * hard * , and the reason there are a million minecraft-playing youtubers out there with zero views is because they do n't understand this . 
  they think that if they just record themselves playing games people will show up and watch , when that 's so wrong . 
  so if you ca n't see any career path in this world for you other than being a youtuber , make choices that will allow you to study marketing and social media at a-level/university . 
  but i do n't recommend youtube as an end goal - diversify yourself , get skilled at something else , and do youtube in your free time because you enjoy it . 
  that 's the attitude you should take - do n't do it for views , do n't do it for money , just do it for fun . 
  yeah , the influx of activity was huge after the latest episode , and by the looks of things the next episode will spur on a lot of discussion too . 
  we 'll definitely go for two threads next time . 
  there 's more people lurking around here than i thought ... 
  i ca n't really use automod for the job because i need to update the poster in the sidebar at the same time as posting the threads , so either i 'll ask one of the other guys , or just take one for the team and stay up until 2am that night . 
  sips is playing the long game . 
  sure , he could have a pretty steady supply of views by releasing gmod every day , but by having fun playing a variety of stuff he can build a fantastic loyal viewership . 
  in the long run , that 's much more valuable . 
   i 'm surprised there are n't more specific groups for this kinda thing lol, 
  that 's because translation is n't easy !, 
  being a translator is literally an entire career , so there are n't a huge number of people translating large blocks of text for free . 
  / r/translator is the best you 're gon na get , and people there only really do one or two sentences . 
  trust no one !, 
  themysteryofgravityfalls is not the official tumblr , it 's run by / u/gravityfallscipher . 
  gravi-team falls is the only official social media outlet the show has . 
  everything is more user-friendly than maya . 
  i wanted to be an actor , then a filmmaker , then an animator , then a director ... 
  i 'm sitting here with a mostly-blank sketchbook and i 'm not sure what to do about it . 
  then why does mine have [ a picture of a pen on the blue end ] ( http://www.koh-i-noor.cz/media/images/shop/6521001001kk.jpg ) ? 
  i 'm just a first-year 3d animation student who 's a bit bitter about being thrown into maya at the deep end . 
  i 'm sure i 'll learn to love it in time . 
  remember we have [ a master list of sips-isms ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/sips/wiki/sipsisms ) for whenever you need to look up a catchphrase . 
  no , bad !, 
  read the rules !, 
   avoid linking to any sites that make money from hosting the episodes . 
  we understand not everyone can watch the show on disney xd , but these sites should not be rewarded for hosting someone else 's work . 
  please only link to places like http://invisionweb.us/gravityfalls/ !, 
  sips ca n't talk to anyone in fallout because he set his intelligence ( in ) stat to 3 , which is ` poor ' . 
  you will be able to talk to npcs if you give your character an intelligence stat of 4 or above . 
  it 's safe for them because salmonella does not exist out there . 
  do n't try it in america/europe . 
  does n't matter , because this ship ai n't sinking !, 
  to be honest i do n't actually like all the shipping posts we 've had lately , but i let them slide anyway because people do n't seem to mind them . 
  unlike most ama request people , the gf team are easily contactable . 
  go forth and send out your messages and tweets !, 
  ( ask them to [ contact the mods ] ( http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2fgravityfalls ) if they 're interested . ), 
  [ all by ian worrel ] ( http://enworrel.blogspot.co.uk/2012/07/more-gravity-falls-development.html ), 
  the `` s '' was cut off by wax sherlock holmes in ` headhunters ' , but we do n't know why it has n't been fixed ... 
  i change the poster out when a new episode airs so that it can link to the new discussion thread !, 
  if possible , i 'll look to [ the official gravity falls blog ] ( http://gravi-teamfalls.tumblr.com/ ) , but i 'll go for fan-made stuff like this if they have n't posted a good poster . 
  see the very bottom of the sidebar . 
  [ user was banned for this post ], 
  done !, 
  i was holding out for a poster like this that was made by the gf staff . 
  no , lol . 
  [ as seen here . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfahfe3cwlc&amp;t=321 ), 
  done !, 
  [ ] ( #gf 04 ) technically it was n't a gif , it was [ this image ] ( http://i.imgur.com/qw4ljrx.jpg ) with a [ css3 animation ] ( http://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_animations.asp ) on it ( similar to the gravity falls logo in the header ) !, 
  the [ original image ] ( http://moringmark.tumblr.com/post/110630848593 ) was a gif though . 
  i ca n't really add an animation like that to an existing image though . 
  i guess i could , but it might look a bit weird . 
  \\* rolls up in police car *, 
  late to the scene . 
  one more slip-up like this and i 'm gon na have to hand in my badge . 
  his tweet had to come to an end . 
  rip alex 's tweet . 
  thanks for caring so much about the sub . 
  a lot of people seem to bring up the fact that we have a occasional `` dear alex '' posts , but we already have a note on the [ submit page ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/gravityfalls/submit ) asking people not to make them :, 
   ** trying to contact the gravity falls team ? 
   this is n't the place to do it !, 
  alex and friends do n't read this subreddit ( or if they do , they keep very quiet about it ) . 
  this is just a place to share stuff with other gravity falls fans . 
  i 'm not really sure what else can be done , because if people do n't read that , they definitely wo n't read the sidebar . 
  is it really `` unfair karma '' to post moringmark/the mystery of gravity falls 's stuff first ? 
  i thought `` unfair '' would be stealing other people 's posts and needlessly reposting , because that is cheating the system and spoils the sub for everyone . 
  for the average reader , it does n't really matter who posted the latest stuff , and i do n't see the point in penalising those who got there first . 
  i 'm not sure what you mean about low-quality posts , as i do n't feel there 's a great deal of that here . 
  we definitely have more kids than most , but the front page looks pretty similar to other cartoon-related subs ( / r/regularshow , / r/adventuretime , / r/mylittlepony ) . 
  i was thinking of adding a [ theory ] post flair , because people tend to state their theories as facts , but that 's all i can come up with . 
  if you have any suggestions about how to raise the bar i 'd love to hear them , because i do n't know what we 're missing !,
