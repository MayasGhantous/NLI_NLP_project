  me too , but if we let everyone do that the place would become flooded in text posts and it would be even harder to read !, 
  ( it 's happened in the past , and it 's not pretty . ), 
  the fairest approach is to just remove all posts like these until things quiet down . 
  if he 's glasses ... who is the hand ? 
  removed !, 
  please do n't put spoilers in the title of your post . 
  out of interest , how did you get here through / r/all ? 
  it 's not like anything was voted particularly highly . 
  come back same time tomorrow and i can assure you we 'll be much more lax on the rules , and your post will be more likely to reach the front page too !, 
  [ in the words of the man himself ... ] ( https://twitter.com/_alexhirsch/status/572474358607699968 ), 
  his style reminded me of [ another crazy prankster ] ( http://youtu.be/uyh3c1xdt3y ) . 
  please use [ the discussion thread ] ( http://redd.it/2yiada ) to discuss the episode . 
  please post your thoughts here instead : http://redd.it/2yiada, 
  removed for spoiler in the title . 
  i like this theory . 
  it makes me think of the journals becoming sentient and combining to become a mighty morphin ' power journal . 
  this is beautiful !, 
  [ we already had a crossover !,

  the floppy disc has been pointed out plenty of times already , the ker-prank 'd thing is new . 
  removed for spoiler in the title . 
  please keep the discussion to the [ discussion thread ] ( http://redd.it/2yiada ) !, 
  i 'm removing this because it 's been posted * so many times * . 
  removed , do n't hype people up for nothing . 
  is it ? 
  i do n't think there 's * that * much junk here . 
  removed for spoiler in the title . 
  removed !, 
  c'mon man , the second rule makes it pretty clear . 
  we only allow ad-free places like [ the invisionweb site ] ( http://invisionweb.us/gravityfalls/app.html ) . 
  the thing on top is [ the shapeshifter ] ( http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gravityfalls/images/1/11/s2e2_experiment_210_creature.png ) . 
  top left is [ the hide-behind ] ( http://media.tumblr.com/3f2e8fbf7210ee038658d2a86cf0a46d/tumblr_inline_n9qwydse781r9l2ko.png ) from the gf shorts . 
  left are [ the zombies ] ( http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gravityfalls/images/e/e0/s2e1_zombie_disco.png ) . 
  right is the [ society of the blind eye ] ( http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gravityfalls/images/8/85/s2e7_tied_up_gang.png ) . 
  i think those are all the things in the image which have been revealed so far . 
  it hints towards the fact that the author was revealed in the latest episode . 
  not a huge , direct spoiler i know , but we 're still on spoiler lockdown until 24 hours after the episode aired . 
  removed for spoiler in the title .

  is this the first time we 've seen kids with five fingers ? 
  all the modern-day kids have four , and [ even in flashbacks ] ( http://24.media.tumblr.com/96e2cccc477213331af3061c2e66eb62/tumblr_mq7fspm92a1ra7zx1o1_500.png ) we have n't seen any fingers . 
  [ you 're a little late ] ( http://redd.it/2yiixb ),

  it 's against [ reddit rules ] ( http://www.reddit.com/rules/ ) to link to there . 
  post removed . 
   '' ... if you start to go down the [ reddit ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/gravityfalls/ ) rabbit hole , i think your mind might be a little blown ... '', 
  [ ] ( #puppetdipper ) aaaaaa he linked to us !, 
  [ ] ( #kermit ) now i feel very self-concious . 
  your questions should go [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/yogscastkim/comments/2ylnex/your_questions_for_ask_kim_3/ ) !, 
  yep , i think we 'll probably have more of a delay next time between the end of the episode and the start of the discussion thread , so people can calm down a bit . 
  i 'm just not sure what the ideal delay time should be ... 
  [ ] ( #gfb 00 ) you do n't need to spoiler-tag this stuff anymore , it 's been 24 hours since the episode . 
  the author has been gone for 30 years , and the show is set in 2012 . 
  so it 's pretty well-accepted in the fandom that something major happened on july 4 , 1982 . 
  [ you 're too slow . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/gravityfalls/comments/2yoryo/av_club_interviews_alex_hirsch_about_not_what_he/ ), 
   originally i thought three [ series ] . 
  that may be too many though . 
  perhaps 2 and a movie . 
  im more interested in quality than quantity . 
  but i suppose anything can happen, 
  just so you 're aware dude , you 've been [ shadowbanned ] ( http://enhanceviewsbugs.uservoice.com/knowledgebase/articles/340520-what-is-reddit-shadowban ) . 
  if you want to know why , you should [ message the admins ] ( http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2freddit.com&amp;subject=&amp;message= ) . 
  the guy behind the soundtrack is [ brad breeck ] ( http://bradbreeck.com/ ) . 
  but it 's not his call to make , it 's disney 's !, 
  i 'm just going off what happened in the mlp fandom , where people were clamouring for a soundtrack release for years , but the composer ( daniel ingram ) was tied down by hasbro 's rules . 
  it did come out eventually though . 
  they 're great . 
  i have removed this post because alex and friends do not ( publicly ) read this subreddit . 
  this is not a place to send messages to the people who work on gravity falls . 
  this is a place to talk to other gravity falls fans . 
  kerprank jumping out from behind plants reminded me more of [ this guy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyh3c1xdt3y ) ... 
  we 'd love to have you !, 
  send [ a message to the mods ] ( http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2fgravityfalls ) and we 'll set you up . 
  the background art for some of these was posted on [ gravi-team falls ] ( http://gravi-teamfalls.tumblr.com/ ) recently . 
  if they 're a 3d matrix , does that mean it 's possible to plot these points in 3d space and make a model ? 
  or am i misinterpreting ? 
  ` deleted ' and ` removed ' are different things . 
  an op can * delete * a post , and it 's gone forever . 
  mods can * remove * a post , and it can be restored later . 
  i 'm removing this because it 's not really gravity falls-related . 
  this is not gf-related , please do n't post it here . 
  you 're right !, 
  i 'll remove the link to the old one and get a new one up soon . 
  we 've had a few discussions about this lately !, 
  brad breeck , who wrote the soundtrack , even [ chimed in ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/gravityfalls/comments/2yx9t1/brad_breeck_the_composer_of_the_music_in_the_show/cpdzkor ) . 
  no no , it 's an enormous , evil , time-devouring baby from another dimension that 's frozen in an antarctic glacier . 
  it 's only [ a matter of time ] ( http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gravityfalls/images/1/12/s1e9_time_baby.png ) .

  i 'm surprised ( and a little disappointed ) that we did n't make it into / r/trendingsubreddits for that day . 
  / r/stevenuniverse managed it , but no love for gf . 
  we had [ an ama ] ( http://redd.it/1kgq85 ) with the show 's creator in / r/gravityfalls , and he said :,
