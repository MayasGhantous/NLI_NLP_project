  [ this post ] ( http://redd.it/2zc811 ) hit the top of / r/all !, 
  the traffic stats are linked in the sidebar , buddy . 
  i have removed this post because you did n't read this note on the [ submit page ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/gravityfalls/submit ) :, 
   ** trying to contact the gravity falls team ? 
   this is n't the place to do it !, 
  alex and friends do n't read this subreddit ( or if they do , they keep very quiet about it ) . 
  this is just a place to share stuff with other gravity falls fans . 
  [ this is not a new discovery . 
  that happens when reddit 's automatic spam filter thinks their comment is spam and hides it . 
  a moderator has to come along and manually approve the comment , and i have done so now . 
  aa a first-year 3d animation student , the amount of work that went into this just blows my mind . 
  great stuff !, 
  [ here 's a post ] ( http://redd.it/2v7cuu ) from a while back that might answer a few questions . 
  yep , it does n't get much more remote than northern hokkaido . 
  i 've heard of `` what would you do if you were placed in northern hokkaido ? '', 
  coming up as an interview question . 
  dude this is incredible . 
  fun fact : disliking a video actually * improves * the search relevance , meaning it will be listed in more places . 
  so you did the company a favour . 
  here 's the video explaining it : https://vimeo.com/81788562, 
  you do n't actually get freaky with anyone , it 's just the theme of the game . 
  hah no , but it 's something i 'm thinking of doing after graduating ... in 2017 . 
  i like hanging around here to live out the dream vicariously until the time comes . 
  '' [ please understand . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f535xpu0nde ) '', 
  the fact that * everything * stops and bounces back feels a little stiff ( it would be better if just the body did that and the arms continue to follow through ) , but otherwise this is really nice . 
  uthgerd looks pretty mad about being neglected for so long, 
  this sub gets really weird sometimes . 
  there is no way this is real . 
  the characters are organised too haphazardly for nintendo quality , and all appear to be 2d images with a photoshop 'em boss ' effect on . 
  i 'm sure ac wii u is coming , but this is not it . 
  hi , i picked the flairs we have . 
  i have a big thing for simplicity in subreddit design , and i get a bit annoyed by themes that go overboard . 
  the ones here were inspired by those on / r/mylittlepony - small and unintrusive , but still just enough to reflect your personality . 
  disney has a well-honed formula of finding the date when an episode will get the highest number of viewers , and puts it there . 
  this sucks for us , but the ratings show that it works . 
  this . 
  this is my favourite crossover . 
  it 's not spoilers , this episode aired in september of last year !, 
  \u70cf\u8cca , which means `` squid '' . 
  it 's in the city of himeji , which long predates the castle . 
  i do n't believe the name has any special meaning . 
  well , it says in the post ... 
   viewing it here in the lab , i can definitely see some fading . 
  but in the picture it hardly looks different at all ... 
  only that one . 
  you can do it by typing ` [ ] ( #fantastic ) ` . 
  [ here 's a more zoomed-out view of the spot . 
  i removed this for referencing nsfw stuff . 
  it 's at 7:30 am on the 2nd of april for us in the uk , surely you can wake up in time for that ? 
  i do n't really wan na do that . 
  do n't worry , that 'll happen for sure . 
  just got ta remind everyone to buy gold !, 
  well , i did finally work out how to edit the `` give gold '' link underneath every comment ... 
  i stuck this in the sidebar because it 's cool !, 
  maybe i would 've done if you 'd linked directly to the playlist rather than brad breeck 's soundcloud profile . 
  where on the wiki does it say ` stnlymbel ' is the password ? 
  i did a search for that , and nothing came up . 
  ` stnlymbl ' ( no e ) is the numberplate on stan 's car , which could just as easily mean ` stanley mobile ' . 
  removed for nsfw . 
  rules are in the sidebar - , 
   all content must be sfw , and related to * gravity falls * . 
  i linked a time converter in the post , click the ` april 1st ' bit !, 
  everyone i 've talked to on my course who took a gap year is glad they did it . 
  uni is such a big jump , it helps to be out of the system just for a little bit . 
  just make sure you have a plan for your year . 
  i did n't , and i ended up sitting in my bedroom feeling doing nothing for 18 months . 
  it sucked . 
  i really would love to tear this css theme apart , i fear it may obstruct/confuse all the new visitors that may be arriving . 
  file that one under * maybe * . 
  disney has a magic formula for working out the date on which an episode will get the most views . 
  for some reason it means long breaks between episodes , but the ratings show that it works . 
  hi , welcome !, 
  i recommend you leave this sub immediately and do n't click on anything to avoid spoilers . 
  come back when you 're caught up to avoid having anything ruined ... 
  please help i 'm stuck inside this website, 
  they 're referencing [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/n9doice.png ) . 
  but this post is a bit weird . 
  nope . 
  i 've removed this post for having nothing to do with gf . 
  i do n't know what it is about these pictures , but they moved me . 
  for some reason i just lost myself in [ this one ] ( https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/007.jpg ) . 
  that ama was with alex - the upcoming one is with bill . 
  technically bst now . 
  ama = ` ask me anything ' . 
  it 's basically a big question and answer session . 
  if you want to see an example of what it 's like , alex [ visited us for an ama ] ( http://redd.it/1kgq85 ) once before . 
  their data is based on decades of scheduling disney channel shows . 
  i 'm not going to pretend i know more about tv programming than those guys !, 
  dude , it says in the post !, 
   april 1st , 11:30 pm pdt, 
  i do n't think anyone could tell you what that black smudge is . 
  i always just thought it was a leaf . 
  the gag is n't in this announcement , it 's in going to / r/videos/new and seeing people taking this seriously and shakily trying to describe videos they 've seen . 
  the [ one tweet that remains ] ( http://goo.gl/ipycz1 ) makes it pretty clear than an event is happening . 
  and no , we have no special information !, 
  7:30 am on thursday , 2nd of april . 
  it 's best to consolidate all your questions into one comment to avoid flooding the place . 
  it 's okay to ask multiple questions , but chances are the fewer you ask , the more likely it is that you 'll get an answer ( in a normal ama , anyway ... ), 
  huh , that 's the last time i let that triangle guy take over the stylesheet .
