  what a jerk , he did n't even give me the pack of skittles he promised !, 
  ^ ( * please leave your feedback here !, 
  yeah pretty much, 
  i was hungry . 
   very easy on the eyes . 
  do n't get wise with me , buster . 
  it 's possible to have multiple skins which can be switched by changing the letters before reddit.com in the url ( like gf.reddit.com or whatever ) and there are subs like / r/leagueoflegends that allow it . 
  i 'll see if i can implement that because i know a bunch of people will want to switch back , but i might go over the stylesheet 's character limit . 
  there 's one more non-cipher secret message , but other than that you got them all . 
  i 'll need to hide some more !, 
   could we get the option to change between them ? 
  sorry no . 
  it 's not nearly as easy to implement that as it sounds . 
  it 's only for today , surely you can live with it ? 
  it 's always been that way in res , the lines just show up more on a dark background !, 
  stuff you 've clicked on is white , and stuff you have n't is light grey . 
  i tried using more distinctive colours , but it got really messy . 
  can you screenshot the issue ? 
  and are you using res ? 
  this is to commemorate april fools/bill 's arrival . 
  we 'll go back to normal after the ama . 
  aw man , i thought i fixed this because [ it looks alright to me ] ( http://imgur.com/kaclp9w ) . 
  res is a nightmare to work around because it just overrides everything . 
  which browser are you on , and have you tried clearing your cache ? 
  [ jet fuel ca n't melt steel beams ] ( #spoiler ), 
  who knew , right ? 
  i wrote this in another comment :, 
   it 's best to consolidate all your questions into one comment to avoid flooding the place . 
  it 's okay to ask multiple questions , but chances are the fewer you ask , the more likely it is that you 'll get an answer ( in a normal ama , anyway ... ), 
  wednesday . 
  just a normal wednesday . 
  [ someone made a post ] ( http://redd.it/30lnou ) a few days ago trying to compile a list of questions . 
  is that what you 're looking for ? 
  i linked to [ a time converter ] ( https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=april+1st%2c+11%3a30pm+pdt+2015 ) !, 
  thank you !, 
  it was just me working on it by myself . 
  i was n't expecting the response to be at all positive ( people can get * really * fussy about subreddit styles ) , but it 's a nice surprise to see people actually enjoying it !, 
  we can definitely keep it longer if that 's what you want . 
  maybe we 'll do a poll or something . 
  hiya , i designed this !, 
  as i said in another comment , i was n't expecting anyone to like it !, 
  but i was possessed by some sort of mind demon that kept telling me to work on it anyway , so here we are . 
  we can definitely keep it for a while if people really do like it !, 
  he 's not here yet , you 're about 24 hours early . 
  come back tomorrow . 
  welcome to the subreddit . 
  bill cipher will be hosting an official ama ( ` ask me anything ' ) here on april 1st , 11:30 pm pdt . 
  we 're all getting pretty excited for it . 
  i think i fixed it !, 
  let me know if you have any issues . 
  thanks for reminding me to glitch the theme up by the way - it 's something i wanted to do for a long time . 
  [ it was funded through kickstarter ] ( https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1127979050/dont-hug-me-im-scared-the-series ) , so they 're not backed by some evil company ... 
  everyone seemed to think it was a day earlier !, 
  in spain it 'll be at 8:30 am tomorrow . 
  here : http://www.avclub.com/article/gravity-falls-alex-hirsch-his-shows-big-cliffhange-216411, 
  it 's our pleasure , thanks for joining us . 
  sorry for being so distrusting !, 
  when i first pushed out this theme i was convinced it was ugly and everyone would hate it , which is why i thought you were being sarcastic . 
  i looked into the multiple themes thing , and it would be a lot of work to implement . 
  i wo n't be able to do it in time for the ama , but maybe i 'll do it later so people can switch back to this theme if they miss it . 
  so ... what happens at 11:30 pm ? 
  yep . 
  on the face of it , it looks like the site has n't changed in a long time ( it 's always been floating bill and the grembert story ) , but the code of the page keeps changing to different secret messages . 
  the ama has n't started yet , friend . 
  also , remember you 're not asking questions to alex , you 're asking questions to bill . 
  i saw it and tried deciphering it , but it was too hard for me . 
  [ if anyone else wants to have a go ... ] ( http://redd.it/310q3u ), 
  sure , but try not to get to spammy please . 
  it 's gon na be hard enough monitoring the ama , never mind all the posts coming in ... 
  i saw your tumblr post !, 
  just remember to vote on a bunch of links here to prove that you are human . 
  if you do n't do that , the site will think you 're a bot and put a strict limit on how many comments you can post . 
  bill will makes post at 11:30 pm pdt , and you ask your questions in the comments of that post . 
  the ritual has already been performed . 
  traffic is terrible on the interdimensional subspace highway though , so we 've still got a while before bill arrives . 
  i 'm also slightly scared of this given that he has n't mentioned it at all since the announcement several days ago . 
  he has n't contacted the mods here or anything either , so we 're all in the dark ... 
  it starts in just over 11 hours . 
  you got it wrong !, 
  [ here 's the countdown . 
  ] ( http://www.timeanddate.com/countdown/generic?iso=20150401t2330&amp;p0=137&amp;msg=bill+cipher+ama ), 
  that got nsfw at the bottom , so i 'll have to remove this . 
  hiya , welcome to the sub !, 
  how did you find out about this place ? 
  if you cropped out the last sentence , this would be alright . 
  they let you play missions which can unlock exclusive weapons and fashion items , yeah . 
  post restored !, 
  i do n't think so , given [ this image ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wucr0cy.png ) which shows an unlocked item with effects . 
  thank you . 
  [ you 've been ker-prank 'd !, 
  nope , it was n't in the direct at all . 
  they were all shown in seperate boxes . 
  keep your eye on / r/amiibo !, 
  the ama has n't started yet . 
  [ here 's the countdown . 
  ] ( http://www.timeanddate.com/countdown/generic?iso=20150401t2330&amp;p0=137&amp;msg=bill+cipher+ama ), 
  because people on / r/iama would have no idea who bill cipher is ? 
  there is nothing to suggest that search for the blind eye is official . 
  in fact , alex outright denied it when he did his ama here many moons ago . 
  [ here 's the wiki page about it ] ( http://gravityfalls.wikia.com/wiki/search_for_the_blindeye ) , which details its history and the various codes that have been hidden there over time .
