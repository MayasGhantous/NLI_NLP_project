  it 's always changing . 
  vote on ten things and that 10-minute comment restriction * should * be lifted . 
  he knows lots of things . 
  breathing exercises . 
  it has n't started yet . 
  40mins to go !, 
  40 minutes *, 
  i 've been hyping the hot belgian waffles out of this both here and on tumblr . 
  if it turns out to be one big ker-prank , i 'll be made a laughing stock !, 
  c'mon alex , do n't let us down ... 
  it has n't started yet , bill will make his post in about half an hour . 
  lots of comments , but not many people upvoting the post !, 
  however will bill hit the front page if people do n't vote ? 
  questions go here : http://www.reddit.com/r/gravityfalls/comments/315yoy/im_bill_cipher_i_know_lots_of_things_ask_me/, 
  asking people to vote for things is [ against reddit rules ] ( http://www.reddit.com/rules/ ) . 
   tell them your secrets !, 
  i think he knows them already ... 
  the rules are there for good reason , so i 'm not gon na break them . 
  partly because i 'd risk getting banned , but mostly because vote manipulation is actually bad . 
  please do n't use bit.ly links , reddit removes them automatically . 
  that 's got ta be the best tinfoil hat i 've seen today !, 
  believe me , [ people have been taking screenshots ] ( https://www.tumblr.com/tagged/gravity-falls ) . 
  when you 're outside time and space , number lose all meaning !, 
  it was meant to be over 20 minutes ago , but he 's still having too much fun !, 
  thanks for joining us bill !, 
  we hope to dream you again soon . 
  the ama is over , you can stop asking questions !, 
  you 're too late !, 
  and i ca n't read anything in all-caps without it being bill 's voice !, 
  a few people did actually #cut 4zayn , but the scale of it was blown way way out of proportion . 
  no one died . 
  i agree this would be ideal , and i 'll do my best to implement it !, 
  the poll is assuming i 'm not able to . 
  that 's the luck of the draw !, 
  maybe some offerings/tinfoil hats would have helped your cause . 
  the poll is voting for the backup option in case it 's not possible to have multiple themes . 
  dude , the ama ended over 12 hours ago . 
  you 're too late !, 
  i 'm hoping to get a subreddit/tumblr-wide `` draw bill '' event up at some point . 
  you 're ahead of the curve !, 
  therebare no hashtags on reddit . 
  i 'm hoping to get a subreddit/tumblr-wide `` draw bill '' event up at some point to encourage this sort of behaviour . 
  i have n't worked out the best way to organise it though ... 
  also , stickied posts did n't exist back then !, 
  bill gets an extra boost by being able to stay at the top of the subreddit for days on end . 
  yeah !, 
  i know there are other people at my uni that watch this show , and i 'd love to find a little bill somewhere . 
  i was considering having a contest of who can draw the most bills , or who can draw a bill in the most interesting place , but i do n't really have any prizes to offer . 
  maybe we can have a big counter somewhere that goes up whenever people submit drawings of bills they 've drawn . 
  i 'll have to keep mulling it over ... 
  # ** user was banned for this post **, 
  it 's a joke . 
  what a square !, 
  dude only has 4 fingers . 
  cut him a break !, 
  you can pre-order the base game from the game website , but the special edition bundle is n't available yet . 
  hey man what ` chu stalkin me for ? 
  graffiti = / = street art . 
  ( this is the latter . ), 
  it says this on the submit page :, 
   ** trying to contact the * gravity falls * team ? 
   this is n't the place to do it !, 
  alex and friends do n't read this subreddit ( or if they do , they keep very quiet about it ) . 
  this is just a place to share stuff with other * gravity falls * fans . 
  [ this ] ( http://gravityfalls.wikia.com/wiki/list_of_cryptograms ) is the place to go if you want to discover what all the secret messages mean . 
  the show starts to take on a new meaning once you know ... 
  welcome to gravity falls !, 
  rub the peppers on your eyes !, 
  you wo n't find anything but guesswork until the next episode airs . 
  why bother telling him your secrets when he knows them all already ? 
  heck yeah !, 
  the charming roughness reflects the pikmin art style too . 
  uh , wow . 
  that 's a first . 
  congrats on being a css smartypants !, 
  [ gftable ] ( http://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/qh9mlo1kjcmogklfxtn5nk5ofwe_u6uaz3n2xv3saww.png ),

  unfortunately they 're in one big sheet , so you 'll have to separate them into individual emotes yourself . 
  it even says this when you try to submit a new post :, 
   ** looking to ask bill a question ? 
  tough luck , the ama is over !, 
  but you can read it [ here ] ( http://redd.it/315yoy ) !!!!, 
  suggestion : add flair here so we can list our nnid by our username . 
  bonus points if it works like / r/wiiu 's flair , but with a selection of squid and inklings . 
  ( if you need help setting it up , just ask . 
  i 've done this stuff many times . ), 
  i wan na get [ physical , physical ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwz9vn40nca ) because that 's the only way you can get the squid amiibo here in eu . 
  if that was n't the case , i would have gone digital . 
  imagine the noise whenever you ran anywhere !, 
  * inkling brings the pain ( t ) !, 
  try this !, 
  i was planning on keeping it until a week or two after the ama , then attempting to implement it as an alternate subreddit theme . 
  we 'll see if i can manage it !, 
  it hit the front page of / r/all , so there were probably a whole bunch of confused people who had never heard of gf and did n't want to see it . 
  i feel like the comic timing [ in the movie ] ( http://youtu.be/lqz_tbbr2ts ) was a little better . 
  looks like your account got shadowbanned , which means no one except moderators can see your posts/comments and your votes do n't count . 
  no special edition ? 
  i 've got ta have that squid !, 
  they 're on [ toywiz ] ( http://database.toywiz.com/index.php?b=disney&amp;f=brand&amp;v=gravity%20falls ) !, 
  i agree it looks a bit weird on its own , but it makes for a neat colour triad when placed next to the inklings ( who i 'm also planning on nabbing ) .
