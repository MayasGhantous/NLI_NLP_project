  they wanted to start again after finishing the standard model series of songs . 
  that was the past , time to move on to new things . 
  they asked about wither skeletons , not the wither . 
  as we all know , minecraft is the most original game . 
  it has not copied anything from anywhere . 
  a brand new mod ( or technically , mob `` variant '' ) which was added in the latest snapshot . 
  they 're skeletons that spawn only in the nether , which are black and much taller . 
  you place their heads on top of the soul sand t-shape in order to summon the wither . 
  mobs will drop their * own * heads randomly : a creeper will drop a creeper head , a zombie will drop a zombie head , a skeleton will drop a skeleton head and a wither skeleton will drop a wither skeleton head .

  it 's pretty good , although perhaps a tad big and a tad square . 
  the random vines , tall rooms and brightly coloured wool are a bit of a let-down though . 
  [ ] ( / party ) unrelated to the house , i have [ a pony-themed texture pack ] ( http://www.planetminecraft.com/texture_pack/love-and-tolerance-texture-pack/ ) you might like !, 
  it 's a giant mushroom . 
  you can grow them yourself ( use bone meal on a mushroom ) but they only occur naturally in the very , very rare `` mushroom '' biome . 
  mushroom biomes are very desirable as they have a rare type of purple-ish grass called mycelium and red cows called mooshrooms which can be `` milked '' to yield mushroom stew , both of which are exclusive to this biome . 
  also , no hostile mobs spawn there so you can live life in peace . 
  none really , it 's just another material you can use . 
  you can only pick it up with a tool that 's got silk touch on it though . 
  i 'll admit that i found this hilarious . 
  do n't take it too seriously , folks !,

  * please do n't : announce your upvotes to the world . 
  these predictable comments are n't terribly interesting and only contribute to the noise-to-signal ratio . 
  when i made a world in 12w39a i thought it was stuck , but i forgot about it and left it for ages until it suddenly finished building the world . 
  i think the long time it takes is due to lengthy lighting calculations to ensure there are no black spots .

  [ ] ( / twiright `` dear celestia i love the new emotes '' ), 
  i agree . 
  latching onto the `` i 'm an introvert , so i ca n't talk to people '' mentality is incredibly unhelpful . 
  i 've always preferred my own company to others , but over the summer i made some awesome friends and much time as possible out of the house with them and i enjoyed it way more than just being content , whiling the day away on reddit .
