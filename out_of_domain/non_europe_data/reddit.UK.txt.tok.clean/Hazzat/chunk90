  removed . 
  the ama is over . 
  over !, 
  there 's also [ this site ] ( http://tane.us/ac/nl.html ) if you do n't like chrome or extensions . 
  here 's the part of the / r/wiiu stylesheet that does the splatoon flairs . 
  what 's important is that . flair has that ` transition ` property , which allows that slick hover animation between its normal and ` : hover ` states . 
  if you want to design your own fancy flairs , that 's the thing to keep in mind . 
  . flair : before {, 
  content : '' '' ;, 
  display : inline-block ;, 
  background-repeat : no-repeat ;, 
  background-image : url ( % % userflair % % ) ;, 
  . flair {, 
  background-color : transparent ;, 
  color : # 0096c8 ;, 
  display : inline ;, 
  transition : all .2 s ease .2 s ;, 
  . collapsed . flair {, 
  opacity : 0.4 ;, 
  display : inline-block ;, 
  background-color : #f 5f5f5 ;, 
  display : inline ;, 
  * + html . flair {, 
  cursor : pointer ;, 
  height : auto ;, 
  line-height : normal, 
   it seems however that the snoo in use on the subreddit was slightly edited to remove the lines on the tentacles, 
  they 're still there if you look closely !, 
  they ended up almost invisible when the image was shrunk , though . 
  thanks for the great advice !, 
  i 've got page monitor installed now , so here 's hoping i can be there on time . 
  bonus question : is there a time these things usually go up for pre-order ? 
  is it necessary for me to stay up all night listening for page monitor ( because damn it , i will ) . 
  [ proof !, 
  ] ( http://40.media.tumblr.com/0aea559d7b6eb3cc27e433dc3f6d9ac9/tumblr_nm6btqnvfz1rz0olro1_1280.png ), 
  imo , the first episode does a fantastic job of introducing the show . 
  it 's got enough laughs to keep you entertained , and enough mystery to keep you hooked . 
  they 've added the product image for this now ... but who knows then the pre-orders will open ? 
  how likely is it that they 'll drop today ? 
  i 've got my eyes on the inklings and am wondering if i should be doing the same as you . 
  you would n't want this in the us - the game that 's included would be region-locked . 
  make sure you buy the pack with the right t-shirt size !, 
  the one i linked is small . 
  i did too , but then i got all flustered when i realised i 'd picked the wrong size t-shirt and cancelled my order . 
  i 've tried to un-cancel it , but my fate is in the hands of nintendo customer service now . 
  it 's my first time amiibo'ing , can you tell ? 
  the bundles were all removed from the site shortly afterwards , so it may be that they 're not actually sold out , but instead they were released too early . 
  stay watchful . 
  makes me feel like i should have secured the bundle for myself before posting here . 
  woohoo , i managed to grab mine too ( with the right size t-shirt this time ! ), 
  me too !, 
  \\* sigh of relief *, 
  is there an explanation ? 
  yep , and probably for real this time . 
  it came back once before , so it 's probably wise to keep your auto-refresher running . 
  why do i get the feeling / r/splatoon will become nothing but pictures of t-shirts come the 29th of may ? 
  i managed to grab the bundle with all three . 
  my hype level is in orbit right now . 
  that 's got nothing toad do with this !, 
  a whole makeover like the last one would be pretty demanding , but we can certainly have small touchups for events ( header changes , images in the sidebar , stuff like that ) . 
  no guarantees !, 
  it looks like every sub that does alternate themes seems to do it in a different way , i 'll see what i can learn from there . 
  that reminds me , i 've been meaning to watch klk ... 
  there was never a bill flair !, 
  there are other bundles stil available which include the game , t-shirt and 1 amiibo , but this triple whammy deal is gone . 
  copy that . 
  the flairs you can select are all from around the edge of bill 's wheel , and i like the simplicity of that . 
  i 'm a fan of de-cluttering , especially when it comes to potentially messy stuff like flair . 
  start with [ the faq ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/amiibo/wiki/faq_amiibo ) !, 
  it includes a [ rarity chart ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/amiibo/wiki/rarity ) if you want to know what 's rare . 
  [ ] ( / raritywut `` rarity chart , you say ? '' ), 
  try / r/identifythisfont !, 
  the splatoon logo was certainly hand-drawn and vectored , so do n't expect to find an exact match . 
   i 'm still fighting with myself over whether i 'll make a girl or a boy . 
  me too , although it may not be as big a decision as you think . 
  i 've seen people [ theorise ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/splatoon/comments/31py2a/how_does_character_creation_work/cq3wz7w ) from the trailers that multiple inklings will be possible , so you might be able to hop from one to another depending on your mood . 
  the liberal democrats saw this kind of video was popular and tried to make their own . 
  it was really bad . 
  moderators have a special blind eye flair , gf staff have [ three exclamation marks ] ( http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gravityfalls/images/a/a3/s1e19_full_bill_page_kinda.png ) , and bill himself has a glowy yellow name . 
  that 's all !, 
  the triple amiibo pack was only an na thing . 
  those of us in the eu region ( including australia ) can only buy the inklings individually , and the squid with the special edition of the game . 
  the nintendo uk store offered a bundle with the game + all three amiibos + a t-shirt ( which i managed to grab before it sold out ! ), 
  so maybe you 'll get something similar . 
  ( i should probably put that in the post . ), 
  you can buy it [ heeeeere ] ( http://store.yogscast.com/proddetail.php?prod=fb_yogs_0110&amp;cat=3914 ) . 
  i like the idea of using the splat charger to immediately drop a line of ink for the team to squid into when the game starts , then running around and charging up snipes . 
  it looks like one of the most tactical styles . 
  i do n't know for sure , but [ this thread ] ( http://redd.it/31w49c ) has some good info . 
  [ keep your eye on / r/amiibo for updates . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/amiibo/search?q=splatoon&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all ), 
  you could always make a post in / r/amiibo asking for help , but prepare for downvotes as everyone there is just miserable these days . 
  sips 's channel art is all by [ nina-serena ] ( http://ninaserena.tumblr.com ) . 
  the body is n't pikachu , it 's luma !, 
  you can see [ the actual traffic graph ] ( http://reddit.com/r/amiibo/about/traffic ) if you 're interested . 
  sadly not , that 's one of the limitations of reddit . 
  why jump overboard ? 
  the email youtube sent out to partners put big emphasis on the fact that this was being introduced just to give viewers more choices . 
  if you do n't wan na pay the fee , you can keep watching videos like always . 
  i do n't expect youtube to last forever , but i also do n't think this feature is a harbinger of the end times .
