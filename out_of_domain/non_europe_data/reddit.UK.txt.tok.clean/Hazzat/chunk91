  if you do n't like it , you can ignore it , and i doubt very much they 're going to start forcing it on people . 
  what could get screwed up ? 
  reports of this kind go [ here ] ( https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1axk4esdrnvt4wwmxzynkiwpg4iecvxfbjufito3hawi/viewform ) !, 
  woah , i did n't realise how mandatory the new system will be . 
  some of those terms really suck . 
  do you take good care of it ? 
  these are gorgeous . 
  [ youre in luck ] ( http://scottstutzman.bandcamp.com/album/songs-in-the-key-of-sips ), 
   dip is kind of a square, 
  thank * you * for continuing to make awesome music !, 
  i wrote to you many moons ago saying i 'd make a lego music video to one of your songs , and i still totally plan to . 
  hopefully i 'll have time in the summer . 
   tad 's a real square and that is an objectively stupid shape !, 
  ^ [ [ 1 ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/gravityfalls/comments/315yoy/im_bill_cipher_i_know_lots_of_things_ask_me/cpynzvm?context=1 ) ], 
  i do n't believe he 'll literally be a square though , as some recent fanart is suggesting . 
  bigger than smash ? 
  nah , as smash has a 16-year head start on building a community . 
  but i definitely expect to see splatoon played competitively , and i know i 'd tune into streams of it . 
  it will take a while for the scene to find its feet , though . 
  it would require someone developing a browser extension similar to [ this one ] ( https://ponymotes.net/bpm/ ) , and everyone would need to install it . 
  [ it 's true !, 
  all their amazon links have a referral in them that will give iheartamiibo some kickback for every amiibo sale . 
  the fact that they 're doing that in secret feels pretty sketchy . 
  do new flairs only become available when the corresponding amiibos are released ? 
  [ inkling girl ] ( http://splatoonus.tumblr.com/post/115984187096/inkling-girl-amiibo-report-this-amiibo-is ) and [ inkling boy ] ( http://splatoonus.tumblr.com/post/116025994840/inkling-boy-amiibo-report-this-amiibo-is ) have had a few more pictures released . 
  do n't remind me !, 
  your link to the previous winner goes to the wrong image !, 
  i 'd like a green inkling girl in palutena 's dress , please !, 
  if you can fit it around the blobby tentacle-hair , sure . 
  because they 're only now being posted on the official splatoon blog for easy sharing . 
  woah , that 's way cool !, 
  i love the staff/paintbrush !, 
   the only thing you really need to decide is the actual art style of the model, 
  yes !, 
  it 's very tricky to just go straight into 3d modelling without a plan . 
  you need drawing or photo reference of your design in order for your model to make sense . 
  everything i read about the development of this game just leaves me with a big smile on my face . 
  the upbeat attitude the developers have is just infectious . 
  wow , you post a lot of your own videos . 
  be aware that [ reddit 's rules on self-promotion ] ( http://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion ) say doing that could get you banned . 
  post removed because the ama ended so long ago it is n't funny . 
  you can get it for yourself [ here ] ( http://imgur.com/u3pjmqt ) . 
  ( it does n't look so great in portrait mode , though . 
  it 's a feature of the app they 're using . 
  [ remember why you 're here . 
  now i really want to see how the squid amiibo talks . 
  i 'm guessing you 're \u30e9\u30ea\u30b9 ? 
  you 're wiping the floor with everyone !, 
  sev ` ral timez are so hip , they livin ' in the future . 
  the band is just crazy . 
  it goes no deeper than that . 
  it 's in the / r/iama sidebar , so it must be true !, 
  i removed this because it 's way too tenuously related . 
  [ ] ( #dipponder ) someone reported it with the reason '' / r/mildlygravityfalls '' . 
  maybe we should set that up ... 
  where in europe ? 
  if you 're in the uk , [ game is still taking pre-orders ] ( http://www.game.co.uk/en/splatoon-with-inkling-squid-amiibo-inkling-boy-amiibo-and-inkling-girl-amiibo-558830 ) for the splatoon + 3 amiibos bundle . 
  i 'm [ pretty convinced ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/splatoon/comments/31py2a/how_does_character_creation_work/cq3wz7w ) that we 'll be getting multiple inklings , so i 'm not fretting over it too much . 
  i 'll pick whatever takes my fancy on the day . 
  ** edit : ** but i do like that top-knot . 
  [ here 's the article . 
  ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2015/04/11/nintendo-will-sink-splatoon-with-its-short-sighted-multiplayer-decisions/ ) it 's pretty much the same stuff that 's been said before , and the headline makes the ordeal sound more doom and gloom than what the article says . 
  voice chat with friends would have be nice , but it 's not the end of the world . 
  preview copies had a space where the d-pad could be used to communicate to teammates , so it 's not like there wo n't be any communication at all . 
  removed for having nothing to do with gf . 
  removed . 
  if you wan na test stuff , use / r/test . 
  they did a kickstarter a while back , and got enough funding for 5 episodes in total . 
  one more to go !, 
  ** username : ** zoot101, 
  ** flair : ** inkling boy, 
  do n't be silly . 
  no one would ever ... 
  `` okay , now how do you say ` three letters back ' backwards ? '', 
   either that , or they 're terrible but have their older brother play online for them a lot, 
  as an older brother , this fills me with confidence . 
  the article is n't evil , and more people talking about splatoon is never a bad thing . 
  i know , that 's why i provided a link to it . 
  here 's a pound sign if you need it for copypasting -  #, 
  the inking amiibos go for # 15 each . 
  it 's kinda the opposite - i 've read that there wo n't be any anti-aliasing . 
  the game wo n't be blurry enough !, 
  i really like the way you approached the keyboard design . 
  nice stuff . 
  i do n't really see it happening , but i 've read a lot of discussions where people say `` i 'd be surprised if they * did n't * make it into smash '' . 
  it gives me hope , and i voted for them anyway . 
  i removed this because it 's not related to gf . 
  it 's allowed [ within reason ] ( http://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion ) . 
  to me , the splat charger ( sniper rifle ) is the clearest demonstration of why the ink mechanic is so cool . 
  the moment a game starts , you can fire off a line of ink , immediately squid into it and race into the battlefield whilst recharging your ink level . 
  then start tactically picking off the enemies one by one . 
  i 'm psyched about the many uses we 'll find for all the weapons . 
   still so many non-videogame characters or non-nintendo characters being pushed . 
  but shrek would be a great addition to smash !, 
  i have removed this because it 's completely unrelated to the subreddit . 
   next picture is a shot of the huge painting across from the mona lisa which i found more impressive . 
  you 're not the only one who felt that way !, 
  i 'm sure the curators at the louvre did that on purpose . 
  summer 2015 . 
  that 's all anyone knows .
