  i think the reason this has spawned so much contention is because splatoon is the first of its kind . 
  to my knowledge , there has never before been a competitive online team game that 's kid-friendly , so there 's nothing we can point to and say `` voice chat did/didn ' t work there . '', 
  we 're all going to learn something . 
  i noticed / r/pics flaired this as ` backstory ' . 
  maybe they 're planning to separate posts that rely on sob stories ? 
  do n't take that guy seriously . 
  i did n't look for one because i did n't mind the motion controls ( i 'm a weirdo who plays mk8 with motion controls too ) , but there 's [ a little icon ] ( http://www.gamingbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/wiiu_splatoon_scrn02_e3.jpg ) in the top-left of the gamepad screen that looks like it might be a toggle between the control setups . 
  damn , that image of stan alone on the swing is heartbreaking . 
  [ uhh ... 
  it 's just you ? 
  people have been building vertical farms in minecraft for a long time because they 're space-efficient . 
  life is imitating art !, 
  this is cool !, 
  you should get an actual 360 degree camera so you can make videos like [ this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecsk7bdyfom ) . 
  / r/thewaywewereonvideo is really cool . 
  click the ` subscribe ' button in the sidebar on the right - , 
  ( you can also unsubscribe from subreddits by clicking the same button . ), 
  you did n't include a link to your wallpapers . 
  you should hit up / r/animesketch for some advice better-tailored to what you 're drawing !, 
  this could have used a bit more construction at the start , as it would have avoided some of the issues like that right foot that does n't look like it has a leg attached to it . 
  if i were to draw a skeleton underneath this , i do n't think everything would line up properly . 
  it 's not really stuff you can fix in retracing . 
  it 's not bad though , and you 're on the right track . 
  i 've found that drawings always turn out better the longer i plan them out at the start , so have patience and work from the ground up !, 
  it 's still early days for this tech , and there 's only one camera out there that can film 360 right now . 
  while it does film in 1080p , that does n't look so great when that resolution is stretched around a whole sphere . 
  [ these beavers ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dssmitz.png ) are on fire , and manny needs the fire extinguisher to get past them . 
  you could use the inkling boy and girl amiibos as cake toppers !,

  i knew it was a good idea to hold onto some of my plaza tickets !, 
  this should not exist . 
  but i 'm glad it does . 
  post removed . 
  i suspect it started out as a 3d model , then was painted over with some nice brushes in photoshop . 
  that does n't detract from the awe-inspiring scale of it , though . 
  it all gets posted on [ pidgiwiki ] ( http://www.pidgi.net/wiki/main_page ) . 
  nah , all the channels are abandoning their spreadshirt in favour of store.yogscast.com . 
  you nailed it !,

  just kidding , wolfram alpha automatically converts time based on your computer 's location .

  kristen schaal 's ama starts in just under 6 hours , bud . 
  okay , then i removed it for * very tenuous * link to gf . 
  surely you can make better posts than this . 
  it 's still going !, 
  you can ask away . 
  [ write to the moderators . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2fmariokart ) for extra credit , you can make their job easier by including some images which can be turned into flairs .

  the gravity falls investigation society is a new thing we 're trying here where we 'll explore the tv/movies/books / media and mysteries that inspired the show . 
  so you can go and watch the first three episodes of twin peaks , then come back here and share what you thought . 
  / u/uddictiun , you might want to add a little introduction at the top of your post for all the confused people . 
  march ... 2016 ? 
  everyone 's fawning over that guy with 8s . 
  matsumoto is cool !, 
  there is n't a huge amount to do there besides visiting the castle and the nearby daio wasabi farm ( the largest wasabi farm in the country ) , but it 's got a really chill atmosphere to it and can be a nice break if kyoto gets too hectic . 
  at least , that was my impression when i visited last may . 
  if you can fit it in , i 'd definitely recommend a day trip from kyoto to nara . 
  that place is so beautiful , and wandering it was one of the highlights of my trip . 
  please share with / r/splatoon !, 
  my prediction is that , like all previous april fools events , anyone who participates will get some kind of permanent reward like a user page trophy . 
  i 'm not gon na sit idly by when there 's something to be had !, 
  i believe they unlock 15 missions off the bat , plus an extra 5 unlockable ones for if you beat the special conditions for each mission . 
  this subreddit has [ a really great wiki ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/wiiu/wiki/index ) which can introduce you to the console and point you in the direction of games you might like . 
  you should start there . 
  first hit on google took me to [ fuji tv 's q&a page ] ( https://wwws.fujitv.co.jp/safe/en/fip_archive_form_new.html ) where it answers questions about joining in with the shows in english . 
  you can apply , but you have to go through a japanese website . 
  the timer rounds up , so if you click it while it shows 21.40 or whatever , it will count as 22 . 
  just doing my best to make sure they do n't make the same mistake next ti ... oh . 
  we do n't know !, 
  but now i really want to see inkling boy in the schoolgirl outfit . 
  [ here 's a complete list . 
  ] ( http://www.bricklink.com/catalogitemin.asp?p=61506&amp;in=s ), 
  i was on the ball when the splatoon + 3 amiibos + t-shirt bundle went live on the nintendo store , and managed to snap it up before it sold out in under half an hour . 
  pretty psyched about that . 
  thanks for the advice though , i 'll keep it in mind when i next dive back into the amiibo world !, 
  more like : u, 
  maybe , but i think it 's unlikely . 
  the outfits are the big selling point for the amiibo , so they 'd probably want to promote any variations a fair bit . 
  this is a repost for sure , but i 'm letting it slide because it 's a special occasion . 
  update streetpass mii plaza for a whole bunch of new stuff , including new hats you can buy with plaza tickets . 
  i was thinking plain old orange or blue until i saw [ this picture ] ( http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/splatoon/images/6/64/wiiu_splatoon_character_01.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20141107184051 ) . 
  now i 'm all about that green . 
  not in the uk , but it 's certainly the standard for much of mainland europe . 
  now i really want to know what a squidtrifuge looks like . 
  you should see [ this incredible hong kong photography project ] ( http://imgur.com/a/ixxhg ) by michael wolf . 
  these pictures changed the way i view the world . 
  why do you do this, 
  yes !, 
  let 's say he drew the picture himself , and added an extra finger to make him look older . 
  reddit formatting . 
  the ^ symbol is used to make text tiny , so it gets hidden and the text after it is made small . 
  if you stick a backslash in front of it , it cancels the formatting : \\ ^_^, 
  which is weird because borderlands is n't cel-shaded . 
  in the interview , he does n't directly attack emoji at all . 
  he just says he prefers text-based emoticons like :-) over `` ugly '' smiley yellow circles .
