  the headline is a bit misleading . 
  movie ? 
  no one has said anything about a movie . 
  the word you 're looking for is `` angling '' . 
  i like it !, 
  abso . 
  lutely . 
  [ the new squidboards site ] ( http://squidboards.com/ ) just opened . 
  i wonder if that 's related . 
  others have said it does , but i do n't know for sure because i did n't sign up to the old one . 
  no , just amiibo . 
  and you probably wo n't need to pre-order those as they do n't seem to be in that high demand . 
  i 'm in !, 
  also consider sharing with / r/nintendouk . 
  yep , and the coins themselves are like [ animal crossing bells ] ( http://images.pocketgamer.co.uk/images/featimgs/animalcrossing-newleaf-tips-02.jpg ) . 
  yeah , this is strange . 
  the direct when these were announced made it pretty clear that the squid would be in the special edition , while the inklings would only be available separately . 
  i 'm not complaining . 
  i remember getting mario strikers charged because it was nintendo 's very first online wii game ( in europe ) . 
  it was great fun . 
  the gamepad is pretty essential for turf war matches , as it shows the location of your teammates , where the ground is inked in what colour , and lets you leap into battle quickly . 
  anyone playing without it would be missing out on key game mechanics and find themselves at a huge disadvantage . 
  the default control setup is very similar to the gunship in metroid blast , where you aim by tilting . 
  that can be changed to moving purely with the analogue sticks if you like . 
  local multiplayer requires player 2 to have a pro controller . 
  gravity falls !, 
  does the bot just pick random titles from a list ? 
  if so , that 's kinda a weird way of doing things . 
  we 're gon na need a source for that , friend . 
  alright , that makes sense . 
  you should probably make a tag suggestion post or something to grow the list !, 
  backslashes , not forward slashes !, 
  they look great !, 
  i suggest you give them a ` cursor : default ` property though , to stop people thinking the emotes can be clicked on . 
  [ ] ( #lotsofthings ) no , it 's because there 's a massive conspiracy man open your eyes, 
  when it comes to learning about history on reddit , you ca n't beat / r/askhistorians . 
  still , i do n't think `` this sub is dead , jump ship ! '', 
  is the attitude to have . 
  get out of my house !, 
  the wii u can play wii games , so there probably is n't much point setting up both on the same tv . 
  unless there 's something in your situation i do n't know about !, 
  everything on reddit is american until proven otherwise .

  you ca n't pin link posts , only text posts . 
  that 's not a res thing though . 
  it 's still a way off from hitting the mainstream , but now youtube offers 360 degree video filmmakers are already finding creative ways to make films that fit the format . 
  [ time couch ] ( http://youtu.be/7iayjz2usdk ) was made in the unity engine , and the folks who make unreal [ want films made in their engine too ] ( http://www.cartoonbrew.com/tech/unreal-encourages-filmmakers-to-use-its-game-engine-111708.html ) . 
  as a 3d animation student , the possibilities are getting me psyched . 
  [ ] ( #trigger ) i do n't think you understand reddit . 
  this sort of event is n't really for the fans , it 's a pr event for drumming up media coverage . 
  i 've removed this post for being off-topic , so please read [ reddit 101 ] ( http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddit_101 ) and lurk around a bit more before doing much else . 
  why do you make these things, 
  we do n't know !, 
  we do n't know !, 
  https://yournextmp.com can tell you who 's running in your area , and provides links to where you can learn more about each candidate . 
  you ca n't do this yourself ? 
  it 's not hard to take your own screenshots , or find a [ really nice gif ] ( https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-mybwxscbqgk/aaaaaaaaaai/aaaaaaaagak/r2ae5wgp8qa/photo.jpg ) of it and separate that into its individual images . 
  wendy is okay . 
  you can post wendy . 
  i blindly trusted nintendo up until tomodachi life . 
  they hyped up that game so hard and it ended up being so dull and shallow that it made me realise `` oh , i guess nintendo * can * do wrong '' . 
  i wo n't lie that i 'm slightly concerned the same will happen here , but interviews with the developers and the very positive response from preview-players so far is keeping my hopes up . 
  my ~ ~ fingers ~ ~ tentacles are crossed . 
  thanks for the advice !, 
  i 'll look into it . 
  thanks !, 
  i 'm very proud of that one . 
  we know a lot of general stuff , but there are a lot of specifics to be cleared up . 
  how will playing online with friends work ? 
  will there be any relationship at all between single player and online ? 
  what sort of dlc can we expect ? 
  and can boy inklings wear the schoolgirl outfit ? 
  these are important questions !, 
  no but everyone on the sipsco coast does and he likes to accommodate that . 
  requesting / r/orangerevolution !, 
  when nintendo says they want to attract `` new players '' , they mean kids . 
  and they ca n't market a game to kids in good faith when there 's a possibility of them getting shouted down by other players . 
  strategising wo n't be impossible , as i saw a preview player notice that there was a space for d-pad communication with set phrases - it was n't finished at the time so they could n't use it , but i 'm expecting to see it in next week 's direct . 
  making friends through splatoon wo n't be impossible either , thanks to communities like [ squidboards ] ( http://squidboards.com/ ) and local facebook groups ( i already joined the splatoon uk group ) . 
  there 's no need to freak out . 
  [ an alex hirsch point-and-click is possible .

  if you want the moderators to do something , [ message them directly ] ( https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2fsplatoon ) . 
  if you want a predictions thread , make one yourself !, 
  this post is weird . 
   friend lobbies, 
  that has n't been not-confirmed , there are just no details on it yet . 
  we know that playing with friends will be possible , and the details will probably show up in the direct . 
  you will be able to team up with friends , but we do n't know the specifics . 
  i totally expect that question to be answered on thursday 's splatoon direct . 
  predictions !, 
  * details on how playing with friends will work, 
  * details on how communicating with other players will work ( because i bet there will be some kind of communication ), 
  * explanation of what future dlc/updates will include, 
  wishes !, 
  * weapon reveals - there are two in [ this image ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wbakdus.png ) that we have n't been introduced to yet, 
  * amiibo functionality with other games, 
  * inkling for smash !,
