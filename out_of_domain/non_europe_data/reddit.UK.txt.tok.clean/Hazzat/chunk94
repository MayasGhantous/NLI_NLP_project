  i 'd bet four of my ten tentacles that this will be the case . 
  two-party ? 
  while it 's true we only really have the chance of a con/lab prime minister , there is going to be an unprecedented representation of the smaller parties . 
  [ this sight ] ( http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/82099000/jpg/_82099916_82099915.jpg ) is completely unheard of , and i do n't think calling the current state of affairs a `` two-party system '' really does it justice . 
  designing new villagers feels a bit weird , but i agree that animal crossing could be so much more . 
  we need more control , and more to do !, 
  * carthage in my skin !, 
  because some of the challenges are really grindy . 
  i 've still got all five hammers and only a handful of challenges left , but i think i 'm gon na have to pop one on ` destroy 50,000 blocks in trophy rush ' . 
  red looks like blood , white looks like ... yeah . 
  no , this is a render , not gameplay footage . 
  in-game they look like [ this ] ( http://cdn3.dualshockers.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/wiiu_splatoon_scrn08_e3.jpg ) . 
  share it with [ squidboards ] ( http://squidboards.com/forums/ ) !, 
  [ here 's the trailer . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsq9fl0vckk ) it looks pretty gravity falls-y !, 
  the precursor to the jazzland ferry by 400 years . 
  ** stop . 
  the ama ended weeks ago . 
  adobe flash + adobe after effects is still the standard for a lot of 2d animation these days . 
  there 's also a little bit of pencil-and-paper traditional animation ( the intro was made using that ) . 
  good luck with your project !, 
  that was a joke , he almost certainly used photoshop or paint tool sai . 
  i invited him to do an ama here so we could ask him ourselves , but i never heard back . 
  yeah !, 
  my tumblr name is zoot101 . 
  if you 're interested , shoot [ us moderators a message ] ( http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2fgravityfalls ) . 
  i was wondering when you 'd show up , / u/trendingbot !, 
  we 'll get featured on / r/trendingsubreddits one day . 
  people got ta get their pun fix somewhere . 
  we know it will be possible to play with friends , but we do n't know exactly how it will work yet . 
  check back tomorrow after the splatoon direct and we 'll probably have the details . 
  it 's okay to have stuff you want from the game , but you do n't need to sound so entitled about it !, 
  as others have said , we do n't know yet whether or not there will private lobbies and/or custom rules . 
  expect it to be covered in tomorrow 's splatoon direct . 
  is this how kids talk these days ? 
  i did n't think i was * that * old ... 
  there will be a communication system with preset messages on different d-pad buttons , so you wo n't be going in totally deaf and mute . 
  / r/splatoon welcomes you . 
  it 's media-only , yes . 
  we 'll be able to read about what happened after the splatoon direct today . 
  it was for the gaming media only , and it was only for one day . 
  they will be able to talk about it after the splatoon direct . 
  woah , those look really good !, 
  i was a little worried that they would turn out with derpy eyes like the villager amiibo , but they 're spot-on . 
  given the fact that there 's going to be a whole deluge of splatoon news today , i would imagine this was a brand new build of the game with all the new stuff . 
  we 'll hear the reports after the direct . 
   is splattershot jr. just a subcategory of it ? 
  yes , because there is also a [ splattershot pro ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rv5rxsg.png ) !, 
  it 's likely that a lot of weapons have weaker/faster and stronger/slower equivalents . 
  you thought your voiceover was weird ? 
  you should have heard the guy narrating [ the uk version ] ( http://youtu.be/n6bikjnpywy ) !, 
  the amount of retailer exclusives you have to deal with in the us sucks !, 
  we do n't yet know how the inkling smash outfits will be made available in europe , but you guys really have it rough . 
  it was a weird message to be greeted with , because we 've got nothing to compare it to . 
  mario kart 8 has product placement/advertising due to its mercedes-benz dlc , but it does n't have to have a warning on the title screen . 
  where is the line drawn for `` product placement '' ? 
  amiibo functionality , references to other nintendo games and branded in-game merchandise could all be advertising . 
  we just do n't know . 
  i 've been keeping up with all the news to to with upcoming wii u game splatoon lately , and when i saw [ this image ] ( http://i.imgur.com/9espqy8.jpg ) my eyes immediately gravitated to the line of white dots on the right . 
  `` what a strange pattern - it must be morse code ! '', 
  i thought !, 
  then i remembered i 'm not in gravity falls land right now . 
  communication will be possible through preset phrases on the d-pad , and fully customisable private lobbies will be coming in a big update in august . 
  the first round starts at 4am in the uk . 
  and there 's no way i 'm missing it . 
  he needed to have two tentacles on his head somehow ( the inklings must have ten appendages , like real squid ) and i thought the top-knot was a pretty smart approach . 
  he 's meant to look like [ a fashionable japanese guy ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/e1/11/e6/e111e6abed3a9679e42c8098cfbc0849.jpg ) . 
  [ yes . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ei1jatx.jpg ) at least , it looks like it . 
  let 's rock , baby . 
  i fully expect pop to win , but we 've got ta provide some stiff competition . 
  we 've had two different answers !, 
  in michael rianda 's ama , [ it was made very clear ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/gravityfalls/comments/zzyin/im_michael_rianda_cartoonist_and_creative/c69aqpv?context=3 ) that the fingers were just an aesthetic choice . 
  but when alex hirsch was asked at a panel , he held up the world 's most distracting object , signifying that the answer would be spoilery . 
  we 'll have to wait and see ... 
  the gamepad is necessary for the minimap and super-jump feature , so you ca n't really play without it . 
  there 's nothing to suggest there will be support for any other controllers . 
  it 's for the best . 
  they need to open the hype valve a little to stop us exploding , but not so much that it all escapes . 
  yes , that too . 
  you need to be able to tap the map to jump to your teammates though . 
  the splatoon demo *, 
  it 's hard to know what to think when we have no idea what this means . 
  it could refer to the fact that the demo is a kind of advertisement , there 's adverts for amiibo or there is real product placement for other brands in there . 
  we 'll have to wait and see . 
  ^ ( edit : typo ), 
  we do n't know , there 's been no details on how it will work . 
  in the full game you 'll be able to turn off the gyro controls and only use the right stick , but we do n't know if it will be possible in the demo . 
  there 's a 1v1 local multiplayer mode called battle dojo , which focuses on popping balloons rather than covering the ground in your ink , where player 2 can use a pro controller . 
  splatoon is definitely an online multiplayer game before anything else . 
  it says bst in the image !, 
  the local multiplayer is its own gamemode and only 1v1 , so there 's no super-jumping involved . 
  yes !, 
  if you click the date in the post , it will take you to a time/date converter . 
  we chatted behind the scenes . 
  if you want something from the moderators , [ message them directly ] ( http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2fsplatoon ) , do n't just make a post . 
  the mods here are n't really very quick when it comes to preparing for big events . 
  no , you can only play with the gamepad . 
  it 's pretty weird seeing / r/gravityfalls crossover with / r/amiibo . 
  the roller is easiest to pick up , but you should start with the splattershot or jr. to get the hang of the controls in general .
