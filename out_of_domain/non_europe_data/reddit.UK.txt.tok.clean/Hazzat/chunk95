  hoping i do n't get the same technical that stopped me joining games last time . 
  if i do , i guess i 'll go play the tutorial three more times . 
  i restarted the game and the console , tried using my phone 's hotspot instead of the university wifi and just tried repeatedly trying to join for 15 minutes - nothing worked !, 
  hit up [ squidboards ] ( http://squidboards.com/forums/ ) - there 's already plenty of teams there looking for recruits . 
  different in-game brands are ways of getting different sets from the same weapon , yeah . 
  tentatek is one of those brands , krak-on is another . 
  / r/pitchforkemporium *, 
  i 've seen [ nothing but glowing reports ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/wiiu/comments/35d4n2/thoughts_after_1_hour_of_game_play_on_splatoon/ ) from everyone who played the demo today . 
  silky smooth 60fps with nary a dropped frame , and no noticeable lag when interacting with our players . 
  nintendo has finally got the hang of this whole online thing . 
  it 's strong and at first it looked like any players with it would * ahem * steamroll everything , but once people learned how to counter it and that its sub/special weapons balance it out , it did n't seem so scary anymore . 
  the amount your points go up and down depends on the vr of other racers compared to you . 
  if you get beaten by someone who 's 2000 vr ahead , you wo n't lose much , but if you get beaten by someone who 's 2000 vr behind , you 'll suffer quite the penalty . 
  i was n't able to connect to any of today 's events due to that message . 
  it bums me out , but googling has told me the fault is not on nintendo 's end so i 'm not annoyed at them . 
  it 's weird because i managed to get into one game of mario kart today despite receiving the same error for the most part . 
  regardless , i am overjoyed at the response the demo got . 
  i was hoping and praying that this game would live up to the hype and be everything that was promised , and the unanimous praise makes me so happy . 
  may 29th ca n't come soon enough !, 
  [ this was the best fix tutorial i could find ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buoijfzfsh0 ) , and it involves going into your router settings . 
  i 'm not able to do that due to being in university-managed accommodation , but fortunately i 'll be out of here before launch day . 
  i 'll be seeing you on the battlefield ( splattlefield ? ), 
  then . 
  you 're too late , the final testfire ended 20 minutes ago !, 
  the folks on [ squidboards ] ( http://squidboards.com/ ) are already planning out what a competitive community will look like . 
  there 's a sizeable group of people who want to see it happen , so i fully expect some splatoon tournaments !, 
  when you take damage , ink of the enemy 's colour starts encroaching on the edge of your screen . 
  when that gets too much , you pop and die . 
  there 's no traditional health bar , but that 's pretty typical for modern shooters . 
  the main theme ? 
  [ yeah !, 
  ] ( http://www.nintendo.fr/games/oms/splatoon/music/track_1.mp3 ), 
  the full version will have multiple gamemodes , a wealth of customisation options and a full-on single player campaign . 
  also , the two-maps-at-a-time thing is only for regular battles , and not ranked . 
  surely that 's enough to get stuck into ? 
  nah , it 's just a brand name . 
  white ink is the worst possible idea . 
  they would n't want to let all the hype out before launch day . 
  got ta treat us mean to keep us keen . 
  if you want the moderators to do something , do n't just throw your suggestion out randomly . 
  [ contact them directly . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2fsplatoon ), 
  yeah , only ink on the ground counts as turf covered . 
  ink on the walls just lets you squid around more . 
  you 've got a few options , depending on how much you care about pre-order bonuses !, 
  the [ nintendo store ] ( http://store.nintendo.co.uk/games/wii-u/splatoon.list ) is offering a t-shirt with every order , and everything from [ game ] ( http://www.game.co.uk/en/games/wii-u/splatoon/?cm_mmc=facebook-_-digital-_-splatoonall-_-link ) comes with an inkling beanie . 
  the absolute cheapest i 've seen the game for is # 24.95 on [ thegamecollection ] ( http://www.thegamecollection.net/splatoon-wii-u.html ) , but that does n't come with anything . 
  i hope that helps !, 
  i really really do n't want any kind of mario sunshine or otherwise crossover dlc . 
  as a brand new ip that makes a point of being original and different , it needs to prove it can stand on its own ~ ~ two feet ~ ~ ten tentacles without being turned into a billboard for other franchises . 
  there are no in-game pre-order bonuses , thank goodness . 
  there 's only the amiibo . 
  i just wrote this in another comment :,

  nah , that 's a promotional image from [ the splatoon tumblr ] ( http://splatoonus.tumblr.com/ ) . 
  [ here 's another . 
  ] ( http://images.nintendolife.com/news/2015/05/gallery_splatoon_development_updates_bring_fashion_amiibo_game_modes_and_more_paper/attachment/1/630x.jpg ), 
  [ yeah , we know . 
  and i 'm getting bored of people trying to squeeze other nintendo ips into splatoon . 
  it 's a brand new franchise , let it breathe on its own before stuffing it full of other stuff !, 
  in the uk you can get a special beanie if you pre-order from game , but that 's it . 
  i pre-ordered just to make sure i got all the amiibo before they sold out . 
  i trusted them without question until tomodachi life . 
  they hyped that game up so much , i got so excited and it turned out to be really shallow . 
  i 'd seen all the content in it after two or three days . 
  still , the unanimously positive response to splatoon 's previews and demos means i 'm not at all worried about the same thing happening . 
  this game is gon na rock . 
  the single-player and online modes will only support the gamepad . 
  battle dojo is a 1v1 local multiplayer mode where player 2 plays on the tv using a pro controller , while player 1 plays on the gamepad screen . 
  i have had massive fun with nintendo land whenever i 've had people over for a wii u party , so we 'll have to agree to disagree on that one . 
  that sounds ... really uncomfortable . 
  you 'd have to be rubbing your heads against each other to get a good view of the screen . 
  it still looks good , the painterly style looks much better than any of the renders would . 
  i 'm just hoping one of the mods realises that the banner has been knocked off-centre and fixes it soon ... 
  it 's 1920x180 . 
  [ here 's the full thing . 
  this was n't organised through us , so do n't expect it to be stickied or anything . 
  i 'm gon na try to finish all the smash wii u challenges before splatoon launch day . 
  i found the switches from games where blue is good to games where blue is evil to be pretty disorienting . 
  when you buy a new weapon , it comes with fixed sub/special weapons . 
  there are differently branded weapons with different subs/specials , but you ca n't mix and match as you like . 
  what you can customise is the upgrades on the weapon ( eg ` swim speed up ' , ` defense up ' etc. 
  oh yeah , you 're right . 
  the trailer for the single player campaign features [ both bloopers and octorocks ] ( http://i.imgur.com/p91nhlc.jpg ) . 
  given that the august update is such a big one that 's oriented towards people playing in teams , it 's absolutely a possibility . 
  we 'll have to wait and see . 
  something to keep in mind when designing new inklings , is that all the canon inklings have [ ten appendages in total ] ( http://www.pidgi.net/wiki/images/f/fc/squid_limbs_-_splatoon.jpg ) , just like real squid . 
  that 's why inkling boy has his controversial top-knot . 
  aside from that , your design is pretty cool !, 
  yeah , the attention to detail in this game amazes me sometimes . 
  even marie 's radical hairdo [ fits the rule ] ( http://i.imgur.com/m6hjpbj.jpg ) . 
  this is not how you contact the mods . 
  you should [ message them directly ] ( http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2fsplatoon ) . 
  the parts of the outfit you can change are ` headgear ' , ` clothes ' and ` shoes ' . 
  almost all the ` clothes ' we 've seen do only change the torso , but it 's possible that higher-level items will change your whole outfit . 
  no , it wo n't . 
  the only local multiplayer is battle dojo . 
  and callie and marie !, 
  why did you link to the tiny thumbnail ?
