  [ here 's the bigger version . 
  wikia is weird . 
  whenever someone mentions inkling `` hair '' , i always have to post [ this image ] ( http://www.pidgi.net/wiki/images/f/fc/squid_limbs_-_splatoon.jpg ) . 
  the reason there are so few styles is because those are some restrictive rules to design within !, 
  also the idea of an inkling getting their tentacles cut is a bit nasty ... 
  yep , but it 's important to note that they do n't grow and shrink gradually as the area share increases/decreases . 
  instead , they suddenly jump to the new size when one team gets a significant lead . 
  this means the mystery over who is winning is maintained when the teams are roughly equal . 
  heck yeah , i could totally see a 10 y/o me singing `` you 're a kid now you 're a squid now '' all day after seeing this ad . 
   do n't forget the squid sisters, 
  even marie 's radical hairstyle [ fits the ten-tentacle rule ] ( http://i.imgur.com/m6hjpbj.jpg ) !, 
  / r/wineorcheese, 
  according to [ this ] ( http://redd.it/35pb37 ) ( big spoilers ) you can change anything about your inkling any time you want . 
  gender , skin and eyes . 
  ^ ( edit : typo ), 
  [ from the comments . 
  also in [ this video ] ( http://youtu.be/3varrl4ale4 ) you can see the character creation , and it says `` you can totally change it later if you want to ! '', 
  [ squid eggs ] ( https://aboutgiantsquid.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/squideggcase.jpeg ) , of course . 
  it 's been that way since day one . 
  the reason the results screen shows the map from directly above is because only paint on the ground counts . 
  there are a bunch of colours that did n't get featured in the official art . 
  do n't worry , yellow is still in the game . 
  the texture of the ink does depend on what surface it 's sitting on , so it 's possible that the difference you 're noticing is just a result of the modes taking place on different maps . 
  it 's probably not a thing , as i have n't seen anyone else bring it up . 
  but will there be squid involved ? 
  do n't just throw your ideas out randomly , [ message the mods directly ] ( http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2fsplatoon ) . 
  removed for not being related . 
  *** it works for piiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiigs !!!!, 
  [ i can hold ten babies at once !, 
  you 're not the only one with squids on the brain , i 've done very little besides refresh squidboards and / r/splatoon for the last few days . 
  it was probably mentioned in one of the directs , but i 'd rather not go digging through all that !, 
  there are a bunch of articles that talk about it when you google the subject though , like [ this one ] ( http://uk.pcmag.com/computer-console-gaming-products/33676/news/nintendo-paints-a-colorful-wii-u-future-with-splat ) :, 
   the finer points of park vandalizing, 
   the game only counts ink on the ground towards the final coverage rating and ranking . 
  however , in squid form , you can swim in any surface that is inked in their color , including walls . 
  painting walls lets players reach much more advantageous positions and secluded areas within maps , which in turn lets them take out opponents and cover the map more effectively . 
  inklings exist in a quantum state where they are both a kid * and * a squid now . 
  / r/wiiu runs mario kart 8 tournaments every weekend . 
  [ this was the most recent one . 
  the splatoon tumblr [ has said ] ( http://splatoonus.tumblr.com/post/119025304264/this-just-in-the-splatoon-global-testfire-is ) that this testfire will feature the same maps and weapons as before . 
  on the 23rd , yeah . 
  it 's important to note that for most people here - usa included - this will be on the 23rd . 
  uh , not quite . 
  it 's going to be on saturday 23rd in the us . 
  [ wolfram alpha says the 23rd . 
  ] ( http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=sunday+24th+may+2015+00%3a00+cest ), 
  all is forgiven . 
  you ... did n't provide a link . 
  this is a joke referencing [ this controversial video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjposknofta ) . 
  squid vs. kid is n't actually an upcoming splatfest . 
  yep . 
  it would be weird if the outfits were only for single player , given that you unlock them after beating all the missions . 
  all memes must run their course before dying off , you ca n't just kill them . 
  enjoy it while it lasts . 
  no , there wo n't . 
  the review copies of the complete game were already sent out , so aside from any big fixes , there wo n't be any more changes . 
  you can download the splatoon global testfire from the eshop right now , but it will only be possible to play it for that one hour on saturday/sunday . 
  woulda been nice if they gave credit to the individual artists . 
  still , this is some really high quality work . 
  i do n't know how they 'll pick a favourite out of [ all this ] ( https://www.tumblr.com/tagged/nintendocontestentry ) . 
  it 's true , splatoon is not a full-price game over here !, 
  i 've seen it as low as # 25 , which is crazy . 
  i removed this because you 're not allowed to share personal information on reddit . 
  if you ca n't find alex 's email anywhere , that means it 's private for a reason . 
  / r/wineorcheese, 
  the background ^ * makes things kinda hard to read and the header is a bit tall , but otherwise this is pretty cool . 
  if someone wants to run it and can show me it wo n't flop , sure . 
  i 'd rather not have a ` gravity falls investigation society ' thing again where the guy running it did n't do a very good job of getting people to join in . 
  the normal price for wii u games is # 40 = $ 60 . 
  is [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/pkg1loi.png ) not sufficient ? 
  as cool as the event was , good grief this is a long-winded vlog . 
  he did n't need to detail every single selfie and thank everyone for it . 
  cut to the chase !, 
  thing is , a blue shell is much rarer than a lower-place racer getting a mushroom or triple mushroom . 
  a blue shell only shows up once every few races , but people are going to take that jump every single time . 
  200cc much more manageable once i got the hang of the `` braking while drifting '' technique . 
  it 's a bit tricky at first , but it allows you to make much sharper turns . 
  i 've not got three stars on every 200cc cup !, 
  except for the crossing cup ... because of cheese land . 
  [ it 's spagett !, 
  ] ( http://youtu.be/uyh3c1xdt3y ), 
  feel good ink . 
  i hate to break your heart like this but [ / u/pinkie _ pie is a robot ] ( #spoiler ) . 
  i was in a similar situation where i swore i would not pre-order the game , but when the amiibo went live i figured that would be my only chance to grab them . 
  and good thing i did - the bundle sold out in 15 minutes . 
   pls tell me wat is it ? 
  about two weeks ago this subreddit was overrun with people making grunkle stan puns , including ... 
  * and , the most meta , [ grunkle spam ] ( http://i.imgur.com/5nv3m7x.png ) . 
  eventually we chased them out and now the puns live in / r/gfpuns . 
  i removed all your posts but this one . 
  please do n't spam so many of the same thing . 
  we do n't have an answer for this yet because although reviewers have been able to play with the full version of the game , none of them were sent the amiibo . 
  you can change your inkling from girl to boy and back at any time , so you 'll still be able to use the outfit even if it is restricted . 
  game is pretty prompt - in fact there 's been times where i ordered something and it arrived * before * release day !, 
  completing the amiibo missions unlocks [ these exclusive outfits ] ( http://nintendonewsfix.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/amiibo-splatoon-gear-and-weapons.png ) . 
  you did n't include a link !, 
  a lot of reddit newcomers make this mistake - you either submit a link * or * text post , you do n't fill in both parts . 
  it 's true , to preserve balance and stop someone building an unstoppable setup . 
  there are multiple loadouts for each weapon , though . 
  most of the game 's customisation is in the clothes , rather than the weapons .
