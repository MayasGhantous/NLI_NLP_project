  [ we had a big discussion about this recently . 
  ] ( http://redd.it/34fkwf ) you can find something to satisfy you there !, 
   is there a splatoon missed connections yet ? 
  well , there 's [ this ] ( http://squidboards.com/threads/the-i-saw-you-online-thread.1480/ ) ... 
  this patches a bug that let lv .20 players get unlimited re-rolls or extra gear slots from spyke . 
  it 's different between na and eu for some reason . 
  made by / u/throwawaygskjdhskjdg !, 
  not a pun , just a [ reference ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arowana ) . 
  try to stick on the side platforms as much as possible , so when the killer wail comes you can dodge it by running into the middle path , which gives you lots of room for maneuvering and dodging . 
  if you stay on the middle path , the wail will trap you in a small , easy-to-splat area . 
  if the octotroopers are giving you trouble , prioritise shooting the octo-balls before they can land !, 
  i agree that nintendo got a bit carried away with the whole ` releasing content over time ' thing after its success in mk8 and sm4sh , but i do n't think it 's as big a problem as you make it seen . 
  there 's still tons to get stuck into , and definitely enough to keep me playing all the way up to august . 
  i do n't feel shortchanged at all . 
  it ends when the timer hits zero . 
  who knows when that will be ? 
  he 's the 4chan trolling target that never stops giving . 
  naut theme makes me sad . 
  / r/wiiu was always my favourite-looking sub , and it was the best example of the fact that building a theme from scratch makes a sub feel way more unique . 
  i always get a little sad when i go to a community i like and see that it 's been naut 'd , and now looks like everything else . 
  play ranked , try new weapons and get better at them , switch up your gear to stay fresh , wait for new updates . 
  you 're forgiven !, 
  i like what you did with naut anyway . 
  if someone finds the source image , i 'll make it an emote . 
  the most glaring errors to me were that the super mario and super mario sunshine logos were in japanese , but the amiibo and splatoon logos lacked the japanese text that accompanies them in all japanese advertising . 
  also , the splatoon logo they used was the [ old one ] ( http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20140710001355/logopedia/images/7/7d/splatoon-logo-01-600x317.jpg ) , not the [ updated one ] ( http://nintendoeverything.com/wp-content/uploads/splatoon-logo1.jpg ) that replaced it ages ago . 
  the overtime mechanic rocks . 
  it means you can never rest on your laurels , even if the 3-minute mark is close . 
  matches are tense and hectic right up to the last second . 
  remember those figures are all japan-specific , we do n't know how many it sold worldwide . 
  hah , i just [ saw this on miiverse ] ( http://imgur.com/ehhf5cq ) . 
  the plaza is a mix of people you 've played with , people who have made popular miiverse posts , and a few random miiverse people . 
  so maybe we played together , but probably not !, 
  give the old flairs * back !, 
  i refuse to worship the virtual boy !, 
  ink , not paint !, 
  the fact that squids shoot ink is the whole premise of the game . 
  / r/splatoon, 
  it 's a brand new online multiplayer shooter by nintendo on wii u. 
  you play as squid/human hybrids called inklings , and the aim is to shoot ink to cover as much of the arena in your colour as possible . 
  it 's super fun . 
  / r/splatoon, 
  not paintball guns - ink !, 
  the whole premise of the game is that squids shoot ink !, 
  the original name for reddit was [ ` snew ] ( http://farm1.staticflickr.com/114/315068775_e0e203e8f4.jpg ) ( as in , `` what 's new ? 
  '' ) , which is where the alien 's name comes from . 
  it 's 50 subs now , and their subscriptions do n't contribute to the counter until they subscribe/unsubscribe from any subreddit . 
  it just released today on ps4/xb1 . 
  they 're going pretty hard on the advertising for it , there are ads all over the london underground . 
  it 's definitely a ramp , there 's no indoors section . 
  when my brother first saw blackbelly , he remarked that it looked an awful lot like a skatepark map from cod . 
  i looked it up , and [ resemblance is uncanny ] ( http://www.destructoid.com/ul/243463-review-call-of-duty-black-ops-ii-revolution-dlc/c4-noscale.jpg ) . 
  ( wacky waving inflatable arm waving tubemen included . ), 
  i really hope this question becomes a splatfest one day . 
  and you unlock two damn cool outfit sets . 
  every time i feel like `` okay , i 've played this enough now , time to put it down for a day or two '' , something new gets added !, 
  curse these squids !, 
  they banned * harrassing * subs . 
  the horrible communities that were n't banned survived because they never attacked anyone directly . 
  woah , this is cool !, 
  gives me a real [ panty & stocking credits ] ( http://youtu.be/5eu8-zbzhms ) vibe . 
  inklings die in water , does that mean the humid kelp dome is filled with poisonous gas ? 
  naaaa na na na na na na na na \u266a, 
  calamari damacy \u266a, 
  according to [ this thread ] ( http://redd.it/3800s2 ) , level 27 has 120 eggs on it . 
  it is a flooders level though , so maybe you wan na steer clear . 
  what weapon are you using ? 
  your weapon dramatically affects how you should approach this map . 
  the n-zap is n't the strongest choice because it 's narrow spread makes it a focused mid-range killing machine , which is n't so great on kelp dome 's open spaces and long , wide corridors . 
  by the time you 're able to splat someone , they will have seen you coming and you wo n't have enough ink on the ground to slow their progress . 
  i 'd suggest switching to something with more range ( eg a squelcher ) and taking to the gangways above , or more spread ( eg the splattershot or aerospray ) and sticking to the ground where possible . 
  this will allow you to play to the weapons ' strengths and hopefully turn the tide of battle !, 
  derp , i meant 25 . 
  disney is taking the leak extremely seriously and have asked us to remove content related to it , so you wo n't find it here . 
  everyone i know who 's touched it has become instantly addicted . 
  it 's simple enough to pick up and play , but the tactics go * deep * . 
  online gets hard as nails when you reach the higher ranks . 
  it 's real . 
  the weapon 's english name is the splash-o-matic ( as seen [ here ] ( http://cdn.nintendonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/nes_zapper_splatoon_dlc_weapon.jpg ) ) . 
  the aerosprays really are n't that powerful . 
  at close range they 're unstoppable , sure , but their range is so short that it 's easy to take one down if you see them coming . 
  it 's especially true on kelp dome , where the the corridors are so long and the spaces are so wide that anything short-range does n't stand a chance of sneaking up on you . 
  you 're a cat . 
  do n't forget the bonus waiting lobby minigames they unlock !, 
  squid jump gets old without being able to switch it up . 
  disney xd !, 
  have you tried tapping the cog wheel icon in the youtube player to change the video quality the same way you would on a pc ? 
  that 's the best way to do it . 
  it only shows up after the video starts playing which is kind of annoying . 
  if it 's still not there , i have no idea what the problem might be . 
  i 'll make sure we get one soon , but we need the current one up there for a bit longer to make sure everyone knows when the show is returning . 
  normally i 'd agree , but given that this is a follow-up to a [ pretty funny post ] ( http://redd.it/284zb4 ) from a year ago , i 'm happy to let it slide . 
  nope , we can only have one . 
  removed for being lewd . 
  yep , the prince charles is well known for being a bit kooky . 
  they 're the sort of cinema that has a lot of cult movie quote-along events , and has showings of the room where it 's okay to throw spoons . 
  do n't post links to leaks on the subreddit . 
  we 'll just remove them . 
  the thing is that disney is taking it super seriously and has asked us to remove any leaked content , so there are n't any exceptions . 
  i think if anything spoils the low-poly look here , it 's the super smooth edges on the text .
