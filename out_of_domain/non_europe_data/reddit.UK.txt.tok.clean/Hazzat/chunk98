  that and the roof texture ( which may have looked better modelled ) break the aesthetic . 
  the lights look fine though . 
  i 'm not sure what you can do about the text either . 
  i 'll give it some thought , because i 'm sure there must be a way to mould it into the low-poly look whilst remaining legible . 
  as for the roof , yeah it 's too flat . 
  i feel like if you 're going to texture low-poly stuff , you need to either texture everything ( [ like this ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-nj31spklj0c/uqndy8cysgi/aaaaaaaaazu/jdjv8kb7eco/s1600/6.jpg ) ) , or nothing at all . 
  otherwise the textured stuff looks out of place and draws the eye . 
  ** user was banned for this post **, 
  it 's out now , so you can buy it as soon as you can actually open the eshop ... 
  those stats do n't actually go back far enough to the last episode . 
  the sub gets really lively , especially if the episode was a big one . 
  after nwhs , the `` users here now '' counter in the sidebar passed 1,600 , and the flood of comments and posts was uncontrollable . 
  ( i removed a lot of posts that day ... ), 
  a new episode is a big deal . 
  the other hub for gf fan content is [ tumblr ] ( https://www.tumblr.com/tagged/gravity-falls ) . 
  there 's a lot going on there . 
  i 'm just gon na remove all these funposts you 've made . 
  [ it 's ten tentacles ] ( http://www.pidgi.net/wiki/images/f/fc/squid_limbs_-_splatoon.jpg ) , not six . 
  you should check out / r/low _ poly !, 
  yep , the big circle is the main ability , and the smaller circles are weaker sub-abilities . 
  three subs are equivalent to one main . 
  no , points are different to money . 
  the money does n't have a canon name . 
  this is a novelty account i can get behind . 
  * will * we choose ? 
  the game has been out for over two weeks ... 
  i keep switching between boy and girl depending on my outfit . 
  they 're both cool . 
  it takes extra skill to get the jump on someone , spin around and hit them with pinpoint accuracy , so pulling it off earns you bragging rights . 
  absolutely not . 
  it would look really gross , like oil , and spoil the game 's carefully-crafted colour scheme . 
  `` poison ball '' sounds like the disruptor to me . 
  nothing you 're asking for exists , and there is nothing to suggest any of the things you requested will happen . 
  the closest you 'll get is / r/amiiboswap . 
  ... where all the content is locked behind amiibo !, 
  i 've never lost so much hype so quickly . 
  it would ease the hurt , but i 'm still not really interested in a mario party/fortune street re-skin . 
  the european shop has some discounts for the event , but nowhere near as many . 
  triforce heroes looked sweet !, 
  i 'm moving into a student house with a bunch of other 3ds owners at the end of the year , and we 're already planning to play this together . 
  so it 's normal to get beaten up repeatedly until you level up enough to take the bad guys on for real ? 
  if so , i feel a bit better about my performance so far . 
  [ here 's a converter/countdown . 
  [ are you sure ? 
  ] ( https://static-ssl.businessinsider.com/image/5411c0b3eab8ea455425dd38-1024-768/facebookburgerkingjapan.jpg ), 
  i 've been called out by ticket inspectors for using an off-peak ticket during peak time in the past , and they 've always let me off because they know the system is too complicated to understand . 
  [ we 're discussing this on squidboards . 
  ] ( http://squidboards.com/threads/l-3-nozzlenose-discussion.2551/ ) people have some good ideas , but no one 's entirely sure what this weapon 's purpose is yet . 
  no , you ca n't boost it to a three-shot splat through strength upgrades . 
  i guessed this must be the tune !, 
  my favourite thing in the plaza is that whenever a train pulls up at the station , this jingle plays . 
  i have to remove this , because you 're linking to the leaked episodes . 
  we ca n't do anything by reporting , the only people who can are disney/alex . 
  that second picture is so relatable . 
  [ this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reqnmdkkgs4 ) was fake . 
  the one posted here is new . 
  do n't believe any of them . 
  [ he has help !, 
  to the smash ballot !, 
  if you find a big group to join ( there are [ plenty on squidboards ] ( http://squidboards.com/groups/ ) ) you can make sure you 'll never squid alone . 
  cool list !, 
  although this one :, 
   psa : swim and move around in your ink to refill your meter faster !, 
  by / u/thesammy58, 
  is totally false . 
  [ refill speed is always the same ] ( http://youtu.be/dnczqff7tpo ) , whether you 're moving or not . 
  when i started at uni , the domino 's team was out in force making sure we all knew they were there . 
  our kitchen table was buried under the flyers and tote bags we were handed that day . 
  i thought i was the only one avoiding them !, 
  let 's stay strong - if we ignore them for long enough , maybe they 'll go away . 
  this is the first post like this you 've seen here because posting this stuff is against the subreddit rules :, 
   no meme posts allowed , unless they are of original art . 
  ( example : say somebody drew a inkling with a scumbag steve hat and made a post with it . ), 
  . . are you offering ? 
  as i posted in my other comment : http://youtu.be/dnczqff7tpo, 
  uh , we do remove all links to the leaks as we find them . 
  if you see something you think should be removed , click the ` report ' button . 
  they stack , but with diminishing returns . 
  so your second swim speed upgrade will be worth less than the first . 
  unless there 's a stat you * really * want to boost , it 's best to diversify . 
  this is sweet . 
  looks like [ tank girl ] ( http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/4/48605/2482398-tankgirl.jpg ) . 
  nope , jamie hewlett ( who later went on to design the band gorillaz ) . 
  i suspect they 're there for technical reasons , either to get all the players re-synced to the new maps , or to hide the loading of them . 
  i know i 'd prefer to see a pair of cute squid idols than a loading bar ... 
  you should check out the [ squidboards groups ] ( http://squidboards.com/groups/ ) and find a friendly one you 'd like to join . 
  that 's the best way to make splatoon friends !, 
  they 're amiibo-only . 
  the racing game is unlocked by playing the inkling boy 's challenges . 
  as an inkbrush user , kelp dome is awesome . 
  the more beats you hit , the more jellyfish turn into yellow ... things . 
  it 's true that you ca n't really lose though . 
  i only have two words for you : http://i.imgur.com/pqdgpxd.jpg, 
  i 'm an animation student who 's a bit lost in this big wide world of animation . 
  i feel like i could make films about * anything * , which is both really cool and extremely daunting . 
  do you have any tips on how i can narrow down the possibilities so i can focus my energy into one type of film ... or is this just a curse animators are stuck with forever ? 
  [ ] ( #puppetsoos ) thank you for joining us today !, 
  i 'll do my best . 
  just keep [ this chart ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/table_hiragana.svg/2000px-table_hiragana.svg.png ) and [ this chart ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/table_katakana.svg/2000px-table_katakana.svg.png ) to hand as you play . 
  reading the names is something interesting to do if you get tired of squid jump .
