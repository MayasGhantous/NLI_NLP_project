  facts about unit 731 are never fun . 
  no , that 's not a party mode . 
  that 's online functionality that lets you organise lobbies with your nintendo network friends . 
  sorry to be pedantic , but squid beakon * . 
  the name is a pun because [ squid have beaks ] ( http://bioweb.uwlax.edu/bio203/s2012/bonis_alis/beak%20flickr.jpg ) . 
  yes , if you 've added each other 's nnid 's you can join the same lobby . 
  you 'll be put in random teams though - organised lobbies are coming in a big update in august . 
  if the game felt polished and complete - if a little sparse in the content department - in its launch state , i 'd like to think we 'd be cool with it . 
  that 's the case here , as splatoon 's core mechanics are so solid that it 's still a blast to play . 
  if splatoon was unfinished in the sense that it was bug-riddled and unbalanced , then there 's a reason to be pissed . 
  july 13th, 
  there 's one of these cards at the end of every season 2 episode , and it looks like they 'll make a big image when we have all the pieces to stitch together . 
  [ here 's what it looks like currently . 
  ] ( https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/177o_dyl4z6d7ewtp3pdmqmq0mbpopisynbbvezwygna/edit?pli=1 ), 
  we do n't have a date for the splatfest rescheduling , but nintendo network was down for 10 hours of maintenance today so they may have fixed whatever was wrong . 
  [ my favourite report on the subreddit so far . 
  yeah , i downvote stuff that is n't really relevant to the show ( and so should you - it 's in [ reddiquette ] ( http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette ) ! ), 
   if you think it does not contribute to the subreddit it is posted in or is off-topic in a particular community , downvote it . 
  i do n't plan to remove this though , as we 're starved for content enough as it is thanks to the hiatus . 
  it 's true , the gravity falls hiatus pales in comparison to the homestar runner one ... 
  [ this is the best video on the subject . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtt583rugai ), 
  ^ ( tl ; dw : hard work , lots of people there , but it 's worth it ), 
  people stopped complaining about that weeks ago . 
  these days people like to complain that you ca n't buy different pants . 
  [ the best gravity falls one i saw . 
  uh , let 's wait until we know whether or not it 's coming to the west before we kick up a fuss , okay ? 
  also , if this petition was necessary , you 'd need way more than 100 signatures . 
  i removed this , please do n't post stuff like that . 
  it is pretty helpful , given that the tweet was deleted ... 
  soon \u2122 . 
  very carefully . 
  they never announced that the eu one was delayed , but if it was actually happening this weekend i think we would have received our t-shirts by now . 
  if you want a change made to the subreddit , do n't just throw your suggestion out randomly like this . 
  [ message the moderators ] ( http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2fsplatoon ) instead . 
  of the 1 million splatoon copies sold , 476,000 were in north america and 368,000 were in japan . 
  i would n't call either one the `` core market '' as they 're both huge . 
  [ it 's europe 's too . 
  [ it will be on the same day in europe . 
  this was the shortest delay possible ( as the eu one was meant to be this week and was delayed to july 4th too ) , so i guess the priority was to get the splatfest up and running asap . 
  if it was delayed longer , i 'm sure people would be kicking up a fuss . 
  sometimes you just ca n't win . 
  [ yep !, 
  you 're not alone . 
  i get a little sad when a subreddit i like switches to naut for the reasons you mentioned , and the fact that * so many * communities go for naut these days . 
  they all lose their individual flavour . 
  i saw someone ask for vehicles . 
  * vehicles . 
  * like , ink-shooting tanks and mechs and stuff squeezed into the tiny spaces in the current maps . 
  it 's insane to ask for a feature so huge and game-changing at this point . 
  in splat2n ( whenever that arrives in the far future ) maybe , but it really is the dumbest suggestion i 've come across . 
  there 's going to be a sequel one day way down the line ( on the nx or whatever ) , so i 'm just speculating about what they could do with that to make it different to what we have today . 
  giant maps and vehicles would be taking the game in a direction way too far removed from what the game is aiming to be . 
  also the development team will have been stripped right down by this point , with only a fraction of the team remaining to do balance patches , push out updates and run splatfests . 
  there are no more huge features coming besides the ones we know . 
  the colour choices seem a bit out of place - i would have chosen to build the flag out of actual inkling ink colours . 
  it 's more meaningful that way . 
  is actually `` to me ! '', 
  in eu . 
  becomes `` nice ! '', 
  yes , your message is changed as it crosses into the other languages . 
  there are a whole bunch of small translation differences , as the na and eu localisation teams worked independently . 
  pretty much all the dialogue is different , as well as the menu options , some of the clothes names and the [ sunken scrolls ] ( http://squidboards.com/threads/differences-between-european-and-american-sunken-scrolls.2177/ ) ( octo valley spoilers ) . 
  there are [ 22 unique ink colours in the game ] ( http://cdn.wikimg.net/splatoonwiki/images/a/ac/sunkenscroll7.png ) , if that helps . 
  if you 're looking to ask matt braly questions , you need to [ go here ] ( http://redd.it/3aj99f ) . 
  wow , you post a lot of your own stuff here . 
  be aware that what you 're doing counts as spam under the [ reddit rules of self-promotion ] ( https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion ) , and you could find yourself banned from the site if you keep it up . 
  also the fact that all your posts get downvoted should probably tell you something about the quality of your content too ... 
  no , it does n't . 
  the tester is meant to show how those two people would get along irl . 
  ( it 's weird i know , but so is this game . ), 
  this has n't been mentioned at all by nintendo , so it 's very very unlikely . 
  also they want people to use the gamepad , because they put a lot of r&d into that thing . 
  4th of july , 6pm bst ( uk time ) !, 
  [ the eu one was rescheduled too . 
  / r/gravityfalls follows the same spoiler policy as a lot of other cartoon subreddits , which is that spoilers only need to be tagged if they 're related to an upcoming episode , or an episode that aired within the last 24 hours . 
  this post is fine . 
  sorry you got downvoted though , i understand your concern . 
  if you want a change made on the subreddit , do n't make a post about it . 
  [ contact the mods directly . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2fsplatoon ), 
  to get rid of it , you need to open all the applications that have been downloaded/updated . 
  you can see them listed on the data management screen ( the blue box icon with the arrow on it ) . 
  nope , nothing this weekend . 
  if there was , we would have picked our teams and received our t-shirts by now . 
  i have n't seen it myself yet because i 'm in europe too , and the only place to have a splatfest so far is japan . 
  [ here 's a video of what it was like . 
  ] ( http://youtu.be/urcygdcfuxu ), 
  this is what we were warned about when we first ~ ~ startup ~ ~ started up the game ... 
  the folks on [ squidboards ] ( http://squidboards.com/ ) ( a lot of whom came from the smash community ) really want to see it happen , but it relies entirely on whatever is in the august update . 
  let 's hope it 's good . 
  the t-shirt booth sets up a week in advance so everyone can get the message , and you have time to level up your t-shirt . 
  splatfest is still next saturday !, 
  it says in the image that this is [ mogok browser ] ( https://appsto.re/gb/xxk_b.i ) , the selling point of which is that it 's the only browser to properly support the burmese language . 
  assuming she 's not from myanmar , how do you even stumble upon this ? 
  you can only use the pro controller and classic controller ( pro ) for battle dojo , the local multiplayer mode . 
  everything else is gamepad-only . 
  that 's fair enough then . 
  it 's still pretty crummy of the app developers to stick ads on it . 
  the person who posted this is in australia , so for them it 's on sunday .
