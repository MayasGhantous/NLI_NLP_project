  or you can find a motorcycle in good nick at the atom cat 's garage . 
  i was disappointed how far down i had to scroll to reach a comment about the poor cows . 
  think on your sins people !, 
  same here . 
  i 've once managed to oversleep by 8 hours . 
  was meant to be up at 8 . got up at 4 . 
  ahh i miss the civ games where domination was controlling 2/3rds of the land and population . 
  creeper in the 7th picture looking for his next diamond shovel . 
  one of the reasons i 'm looking forward to a borderlands mod . 
  not enough r/tr8r, 
  the rail unions are n't fantastic : /, 
  no , that just creates further tension with the irish . 
  as someone from essex , i firmly consider myself to be part of east anglia , but instead i 've seen myself in the home counties , the south east , the south , and on our own . 
  this !, 
  even when you acknowledge your mistake and thank others for correcting you , they just pummel you down into dust . 
  as a brit who considers most us humour confusing and childish , i do find jimmy fallon 's covers very good , 
  and do n't mind hancock , he 's just admiring the view . 
  no this is not a retarder , like / u/wheresmyhammer has stated , it 's actually a gap between the concrete bed of the tunnel and the start of the sleepered & ballasted track to protect against expansion, 
  e : i 'm studying civil engineering atm and things like this are much the same reason as the gaps on a concrete road surface . 
  this is how language is born people . 
  we 've just witnessed the birth of a new word !, 
  annnnnnnd here 's me having just downloaded [ this mod ] ( http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/1145/ ? ), 
  allowing me to place cars and many other things as i see fit . 
  sorry mate [ the lib dems are finished ] ( http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/02/01/15/30c8d96600000578-0-image-a-22_1454341989907.jpg ) . 
  google said so !, 
  ^ ( yes , sorry , it 's the mail but it was the first image i could find ), 
  or that he revealed too much of his telescope . 
  first are shedding routes everywhere . 
  in my home area ( braintree/colchester ) they now only run two services , when they used to run most . 
  now instead we have network colchester , chambers , hedinghams , or regal doing most of the secondary/local routes . 
  he 's not an entertaining bellend . 
  just a bellend, 
  well if they drop chris evans and matt leblank i think it could be a success with sabine and 3 unknowns . 
  the cleanliness and technology really did have me in a wow , and talking to shaun in a relieved manner , really did shield myself from the true horror of the institute until after i finished the quest line . 
  this was partly influenced by how the brotherhood , my heros from fallout 3 , lacked some of the humanity of eldar lyons ( having followed the back story in more detail since i realise how that had caused a rift ) . 
  also i did n't read the script for the speech or visit the fev lab until after completing the main quest-line , and well , i ca n't wear the institute x-01 power armour ever again because of the sick truth that really under lies it . 
  i almost immediate went back on myself and did completed it with the railroad because they 're far better . 
  i 'm now struggling with the brotherhood play through because maxson is a massive cunt . 
  oh geez , i had n't considered it till now , but that just adds to my disdain for maxson . 
  it 's a lovely coat . 
  exactly !, 
  which makes it even more galling when [ you listen to cut audio files from danse during blind betrayal , where you become the elder . 
  ] ( / spoiler ) if they factored in the element to not fuck with the railroad that would be a double massive plus !!, 
  do n't forget the +5 / 10 seconds of breaking after the driver applies the break upon seeing the vehicle on the cross . 
  yeah that was what i meant . 
  it 's dissapointing because it looks so cool , but the institute makes me cringe now, 
  this , having come straight from fallout 3 i found really disappointing , as i was so used to having a laser pistol as a separate weapon with it 's own ammo . 
  it 's a good game , i like the technology/engineering aspect, 
  yup , i ca n't bring myself to kill the railroad , they 're too lovely . 
  * ^ ^ okay ^ ^ well ^ ^ yes ^ ^ i ^ ^ can ^ ^ for ^ ^ the ^ ^ achievement , ^ ^ but ^ ^ not ^ ^ for ^ ^ anything ^ ^ else *, 
  the assault rifle in fallout 4 is essentially an lmg , it looks like a maxim gun ffs . 
  i wish it looked more like the assault rifle in fallout 3 . 
  this , besides not finding any ( good ) legendary variants of it has led me to never use it . 
  for the 50 cal problem : http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/4227/ ? 
  allows you to change the ammo for the minigun to get more damage for less rof, 
  well as a total southerner ( pompey ftw ) i to an extent revere any scots , and many of the people i know admire them too , whereas i can imagine scots would n't like their oppressors moving in on their homes . 
  well , at first i prefered the meerkats , bu i think the gimmick is over used now . 
  i do n't really like brian as it reminds me of our oncoming and possible death to ai, 
  sorry : c but you just have to think of all the jobs he is slowly replacing or driving out of business ; the poor gocompare man will soon be unable to afford the maintenance on his mustache . 
  as a british person , i can agree than cromwell did many evil things in ireland , and was one of the names that sprang to mind after seeing this post . 
  which when added to the following 400 years of colonial atrocities , it makes me seriously fail to understand how people can be patriotic of a country that has done so many wrongs throughout it 's history . 
  i mean we 've caused/been involved in so many wars & invaded so many places it just makes my skin crawl . 
  added to current and recent government & famous figures activities , it makes me lament the damage my ancestors have done to the world . 
  now i will say , we 've had achievements that i am patriotic of , such as the industrial revolution , railways , british standards ( which form alot of international standards ) and the nhs ( at least up until recently ) . 
  but i really ca n't have much national pride because we 're not trying to right our wrongs . 
  nah , he may have invaded alot of europe and the med , but he did n't do anything near as much genocidical killing as hitler . 
  he came to power as the guillotining everyone part of the french revolution was going out of fashion . 
  can i share this to my lego society facebook page ? 
  as we 'd probably find it amusing, 
  same, 
  well , you ca n't say for certain . 
  although he might , someone has been keeping track of all the [ ama requests for john oliver . 
  ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/iama/comments/48c8s1/ama_request_john_oliver/d0ikm98 ), 
  nah , it 's not tigers the isle of wigit needs to worry about , it 's them goddamn dinosaurs . 
  i 'll ask my nan where she got theirs as they got a new one recently with the insert in the lid, 
  edit : i 'm a poor ass student , so am using a fox 's tin from christmas , and i find it seals well enough to keep the biscuits fresh long enough for me . 
  if you 've still got one of those about ? 
  my family has a habit of keeping tins for me as i use them to store odds and sods . 
  and pet bears . 
  he tamed them just by glaring y' know . 
  yup . 
  putin will either cut trump to pieces , or no deal will be reached . 
  2 seems likely . 
  i mean , our uk 2015 election shows this : having more than 2 parties with fptp leads to one party getting in on a 37 % majority ( after discounting the 33 % who did n't vote . ), 
  with ukip and greens gaining diddly squat despite massive rise in support . 
  [ cgp grey explains this better than me ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9rgx91rq5i ), 
  yep . 
  pacers are the epitome of the flaws our rail network has . 
  swim there from warwick homestead , and then fast travel back to get your power armour . 
  it 's what i did . 
  i felt a uk/europe fallout would be cool , and after some digging into the lore i 've only found some vague pointers that in 2060 after the first of the resource wars ( the european-middle east war ) , there was a civil war that was presumably still on going when the nukes were fired . 
  random , but i like your username . 
  i take it you are against gresley societies ' choice to remove the duck ? 
  i know !, 
  those guys are bloody bullet sponges , and they always tend to attack the slog when i go there , and they just take all day to kill . 
  starlight is lovely as they all attack from the same direction !, 
  so i just have a load of turrets on the overhang and i just turn up and farm the xp, 
  fully upgraded , overseers guardian . 
  ( non-auto ) , silenced , wiht long scope, 
  ashmaker , with tri-barrel + alhough i do n't use this against them .
