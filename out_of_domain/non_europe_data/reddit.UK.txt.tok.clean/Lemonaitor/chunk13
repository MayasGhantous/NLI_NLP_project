  sentinel 's plasmacaster , fully modded , long scope . 
  two shot laser rifle , improved long barrel , top capacitor , reflex sight . 
  for some reason i read overstocked pigeon . 
  i 'll go away now . 
  i was the brother that did this . 
  luckily my brother and i would often make towns and then train minifigs and fight battles and then i 'd get the crystals back . 
  yeah . 
  that or have it so that you have to do one/both to reach bench making , and then the order is irrelevant . 
  hmm . 
  interesting idea for say a pre-inhabited world with more interactive villagers or something, 
  as a student , this bugs me as our student elections do , and i feel they are far better . 
  shame the guys that run never really seem to do anything . 
  thank you . 
  and the only exception to that could possibly be the ira , whom came about due to injustices caused on ireland by our government . 
  ( in addition to historical deep seated distrust of the english : - tyvm cromwell ), 
  man , our university has these , and man they are slow . 
  it makes me cry because the library is so busy and there 's one piece of software i 've not been able to get at home :'(, 
  oh god . 
  just eat . 
  chicken fucking madras . 
  get out . 
  i 've been home to see family this weekend , and i do n't have a telly , but they do , and so it feels like the evenings have just been this bloody advert . 
  it 's no where near as good as the a1 , but it certainly tops the t1, 
  ironically , this is how i ( and probably other brits too ) was brought up to understand the reasoning behind it . 
  as such , cars would be a `` he '' but boats and steam trains , would always be a `` she '' because of how beautiful they are . 
  [ checks out .

  but too much : c, 
  and i graduate this year . 
  do n't forget the sweet af hat !, 
  i do this !, 
  man , lidl cereal is just the best . 
  oooo !, 
  and 4 pints of milk is 89p !, 
  everywhere else it 's # 1 !, 
  royal mail *, 
  also , more likely to use a train than a plane during ww2 . 
  in fairness , with the state of creme eggs since kraft took over i 'd be happy with this substitution . 
  for my parents , mum does n't drive and works evenings , and my dad has a busy work schedule and a hobby on the weekends . 
  edit : also when i was younger my siblings and i hated being dragged shopping , and this stopped that happening . 
  also i personally hate supermarkets so tend to be in and out as quickly as possible . 
  shit , this just hit me with the realisation that i have been *** that guy ***, 
  well , if it 's anything like my course mate from there says , or what it looked like from the train . 
  i 'm fairly sure it 's that bad . 
  now there is a word i should use more often . 
  i 'm slightly annoyed i forgot it . 
  this is the problem , i 've not been enjoying other 's misfortune enough . 
  or observing others delighting in schandenfreude that the word has escaped my immediate mind . 
  so up yours mate . 
   so up yours mate . 
  i got it alright . 
  rule 34 . 
  oh i had this happen to !, 
  every year the company my dad works for runs `` fun days '' for their employees & family . 
  which was chosen months in advance , so when we actually went , about 2 weeks after it re-opened , the queues were tiny , and the thing that took the time was actually getting along the queue lines . 
  the day out also came with 2 fast passes for each of us , but we never had to use them . 
  in 3 and 4 you had to use transport ships . 
  everytime . 
  it 's being considered , after dutch police have started training eagles to do so . 
  why is this response not higher ? 
  seriously , it was only a matter of time till a drone hit an aircraft . 
  thankfully it has n't caused critical damage , but probability of that happening gets higher the longer current rules are n't getting enforced fully . 
  i saw someone buy twelve of those yesterday ... 
  i just ca n't even ... paid with 5 # 50 's too . 
  i got the sarcasm before the / s. 
  seeing '' / s '' disappoints me as not enough people understand sarcasm . 
  i can see that . 
  `` the republic of the home counties '' or something . 
  as they 'd probably work financial influence over the south east 's airports . 
  and that ' most probably lead to the incorporation of the south east , with a divide as you go north and west . 
  in fairness , for that you can blame those french vikings ( normans ) , the last people to successfully invade us . 
  which did then lead to the next 500 years of invading france . 
  because , why not . 
  it 's why beef comes from a cow , an so on . 
  english is a lovely complicated language . 
  i went shopping on monday and had the buzzer go off as i left the shop ( tesco ) and ended up standing there awkwardly with my receipt for a minute to see if someone would come and check , and a member of staff on their way for a break was just like , `` do n't worry about it '' so i left , but now feel too awkward to shop there again . 
  as a tea drinker , i want to rebuke you , but i regularly drink my tea in a coffee cup , so touch\u00e9 . 
  to be honest , the longer she 's alive , the longer charles is n't monarch , so yes , let 's hope she 's still here in 20 years . 
  me too !, 
  i used to love playing sto but now the more i look at it 's approach the more it repulses me . 
  i 've been in reading all weekend it 's mostly been sunny . 
  it drizzled a bit the morning both days and had periods of being overcast , so i 'll say it 's still working . 
  i agree , the tiger adds a positively glorious streak to the picture . 
  hardened stained clay is a beautiful material to build with , but it 's bloody hard to get enough of it in survival without having a nearby mesa to demolish . 
  i would , but i need that clay for glorious red brick  also it 's still rarely enough . 
   such as heir apparent prince charles, 
  what !? 
  noooo !, 
  everyone here loves charles . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ we ^ ^ ^ ^ just ^ ^ ^ ^ would n't ^ ^ ^ ^ mind ^ ^ ^ ^ if ^ ^ ^ ^ he ^ ^ ^ ^ kicked ^ ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ ^ bucket ^ ^ ^ ^ before ^ ^ ^ ^ liz ^ ^ ^ ^ does . 
  really ? 
  hmm , the only thing i 've brought tickets online for gave me a discount for booking online and printing them ... 
  i like the custom track with the super-elevated curves . 
  3 new variants . 
  one with a 107mm gun rather than the 152 . 
  do n't have them , but i imagine it 's not unreasonable . 
  probably has better pen , but less derp, 
  i have a friend who does this all the time , he regularly and willingly goes with some of our squad mates into realistic jet battles to do this . 
  i know right !? 
  just one end does n't work .
