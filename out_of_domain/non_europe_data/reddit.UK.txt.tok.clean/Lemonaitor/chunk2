  they was a massive campaign to have them removed . 
  that is true indeed . 
  you probably could sue them now . 
  we seem to be slowly inheriting this american culture of suing someone rather than solving the issue . 
  that was good , sir . 
  * puts on hat , tips hat at you , puts hat back on hat stand *, 
  * ahem , ` pavement ' *, 
  however , i utterly agree , the ` blame someone else and sue them ' culture is a disgrace , it shows some people have a complete lack of responsibility . 
  oh i understand on the whole that in some cases the issue at hand is justified . 
  due to the sensationalised way the media works , you more frequently hear about the stupid and superfluous cases . 
  < sidenote  this is all my opinion , and it 's slightly based in being brought up to work hard , so often it 'll take a disabling injury to stop me from getting up and carrying on . 
  and i have a high value of myself , so do try my best to avoid injury . 
  my comment was intended as a satirical one . 
  however there may be evidence for and against it , i believe there have been a couple cases related to insurance to do with drivers hitting pedestrians and cyclists who have put themselves in danger but then blamed to driver for it . 
  however i 'm unaware if they have been successful or not . 
  with side skirts are beautiful . 
  * my opinion is biased *, 
  i salute you . 
  that 's a superb post , if you had it open to all i 'd be interested . 
  and welcome to one of the finer positive points for reddit and the internet :d, 
  why is the paper form only available to north korea and cuba ? 
  i would call you brave , but actually , it 's awesome to see people contradict prudish social standards . 
  i tip my hat to you sir !, 
  * tips hat *, 
  splendid work on making a very well reasoned and referenced on points supporting this point , you have saved me the time and effort to make a similar comment . 
  you make a good point , i was just nagged because they were not created , they evolved :p, 
  i beg to differ . 
  some people do bring up their cats with a reasonable sense of freedom/independance , and they can still be pro-active feline hunters , however each cat does respond differently and may stay dependant, 
  we have/had a few cats in our household , and one is an avid hunter/fighter , and will fight other cats , capture and kill smaller prey animals , but will still come home for breakfast and dinner . 
  the other was a proper house cat , rarely ventured further than the garden , enjoyed the company of my close family , did n't really hunt , and was content with how we fed him . 
  thank you  i respect that comment . 
  everytime i go to a supermarket i get a voucher saying my shopping was cheaper elsewhere , so i 'm probably worse , i sort of just select the first shop that 's on route, 
  we may well be from the same town . 
  albeit i have been talking from my experience of living away from home in hampshire . 
  yup . 
  it 's dreadful , because i 'd like to fly the cross of st. george , but i do n't ** ever ** want to be associated with anyone like the edl , or ** heaven forbid ** britain first . 
  i would ask where might i apply , but it appears i 've been beaten to it :p, 
  hi , i have a friend that will be starting at portsmouth in september , and he also got rejected from halls , so is also looking for housing . 
  he 's a wonderful guy , great and easy to get on with , maybe i could introduce you ? 
  he will also being going down to one of the housing events , so you may of course meet him there . 
  i 'm about to start my second year at portsmouth and unfortunately am already sorted for housing . 
  i 'm afraid i do n't have info myself , and i ca n't seem to turn over any additional from the uni website . 
  however when you get into those groups you should find many people in the same situation , my friend has been approached by three people since joining last week , so i imagine that 's the best source . 
  i 've not had this struggle myself , as i got into halls for my first year , and i 've had a year to arrange second year house mates and house , 
  okay , now i like blue hair :p but yours is a beautiful suit for you , 
  [ crash course ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/crashcourse ), 
  school could learn from this , 
  this modified my expectations of what unicorns would be like . 
  i think catcalling is awful , however i have n't witnessed any . 
  and i 've been working in an environment which society suspects/attributes/blames catcalling on , but i 've yet to see it openly occur . 
  i 've not witnessed anyone do it , of heard of any instances where it 's happened . 
  come to the uk , a fifth of drivers go around as if they 've forgotten their indicators ( or turn-signals , as you call them ) exist . 
  edit : i mean , on a daily basis , i see drivers failing to use them . 
  you guessed it . 
  okay , i 'm actually a civil engineering student , however i 've been spending this summer between the years in my degree working as a setting out engineer on multiple sites . 
  some of them in areas near where there are visibly people passing by regularly , i 've yet to see anyone on site do it , even on a lazy , warm and sunny friday afternoon . 
  ( i feel like i 've jinxed this and it 'll happen at work tomorrow . ), 
  oh and i live in the uk , if that changes things . 
  i prefer your selection . 
  and i tip my hat to your username . 
  the only problem i had was they sent through a second declaration , saying `` you have n't sent back your declaration yet '' 3 days before the actually details + declaration arrived . 
  i ended up triple checking both letters to ensure they were both legitimately student finance . 
  yeah , i know , this is my second year of using the system  but i was checking that against my personal note of it :p, 
  man , texas must be big . 
  okay , alaska is bigger . 
  i adore your hair !, 
  have you taken any others with this colour ? 
  bankers . 
  what happens to northern europe and the middle east ? 
  they could either be check rails to reduce the possibility of derailment . 
  or the could be for maintainance/rail replacement . 
  here in the uk , because of how planned engineering ( maintenance ) work is organised , it 's very common for spare rails to be laid in the 4ft or 6ft on a running line in preparation for planned replacement of the rails due to wear and tear , as it allows the line to remain open and operation for as long as possible < sidenote  our railways are regularly checked as to tackle excess wear on the lines long before it has the chance to break and cause fatalities , which comes after a few recent ( ish ) cases of such happening [ potters bar 2002 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/potters_bar_rail_accidents ) and [ hatfield 2000 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hatfield_rail_crash ) . 
  so it could be possible where you are depending of how these things are done . 
  thank you , 
  thanks for the correction and useless fact :d, 
  also , stop downvoting this guys fools :p, 
  i do n't want scotland to go . 
  i think it 's noble thing to be considering independence and even more of a miracle to be taking a referendum on it , but seriously , do n't leave us with these ass-hats that currently run government . 
  if you do leave , can i come live in scotland ? 
  i feel your pain man . 
  loads in victoria park , and and assortment along winston churchill avenue , ravelin park , by the union , on park road . 
  and if you include southsea as part of portsmouth , a load on southsea common , and a few more in that park further east along the sea front, 
  unless of course we 're talking about the wrong kind of trees ... 
  the second bridge coming in from the right , is that a closed line or something ? 
  it 's only a sarnie when between two slices of bread , not a bun . 
  awesome buildi - omg there is a creepy man at the window d :, 
  to be honest , railway delays are not as regular as people make them out to be . 
  * at least for me that is *, 
  i 've yet to try it , but i 'm fairly confident i could get a pz .38 f though one . 
  and probably a bt-7 too . 
  although i have killed/been killed through these , 
  hmm i see . 
  i personally did n't notice much of a problem during my two years of travelling on greater anglia . 
  while there were delays and cancellations on some days , overall i found at least 15 days every month did n't have any delays whatsoever . 
  however in your case , i think your issue there is your sample . 
  you said were focusing on crosscountry services . 
  now i think it is possibly logical to surmise , that they stand a higher chance of delay , as the routes they follow cross multiple mainlines throughout their duration , and thus have a some-what higher risk of being affected by a delay elsewhere in the country . 
  also i can somewhat evidence this , as close to where i currently reside , there is the origin points of a crosscountry service , and very often for coming into the area it will be delayed by 10-20 minutes . 
  however for departing these areas , very often i find them to be on time . 
  ( extreme cases usually are where they are 30 + minutes late ),
