  well , that depends where you are . 
  in the bits of the uk i 'm in i find the police to be really responsive , fair and i honestly feel like they keep us safe .

  hat 's off to the guys taking the video for calling the fire brigade, 
  ooh !, 
  this post has just reminded me of something totally un-related , and it was that i 've been reading the long earth series , and was struck by the name lobsang and not being able to place where it was i 'd come across it before , and this has just reminded me . 
  thanks . 
  i should have cracked the tibetan monk reference ... 
  does reddit count ? 
  i 'm an avid tea drinker , which contains more caffeine than coffee , and my only advice for your friend is do n't quit . 
  tea and coffee are stimulants , which are actually good for you , and it takes a considerably large amount of caffeine to cause yourself harm . 
  * sigh * have an upvote . 
  i wish the uk had more modern stations this light an airy . 
  i was just reading in in rail 774 . 
  it 's a idea that pleases me , but i 'm very skeptical as they can easily mess it up , which would be a massive tragedy . 
  edit : like this guys comment !,

  did n't locusts get air droped in a similar manner to tetrarchs ? 
  i 'm fairly sure it wasone of the reasons they are so small . 
  ahh thanks . 
  these stories are not the norm . 
  they seem like it now because of the rise of ukip , but they 're not . 
  source : actually living in the uk . 
  how about trains ? 
  depends what you are into . 
  for some people this does it . 
  damn , i 'll see what i can do . 
  i had them for our sweepstake , i was pleasantly surprised by how well they did . 
  although i was fuming they gave the uk 0 . 
  it 's that dark green you were wearing . 
  much better for concealment than the black most assassins wear . 
  america all over . 
  things like this make me inclined to believe fifa and seth blatter are n't the corrupt ones , they 're just refusing the us 's corrupt manner . 
  i do n't think he 's wrong to , european and us media have been doing a very good job of trying to paint him as the bad guy . 
  maybe we 're all just looking at this wrong , and that our institutions are the corrupt ones . 
  yeah , and look at how the ~ ~ sheep ~ ~ people all ignored it . 
   our press - / - the truth, 
  yup , of course . 
  get it back !, 
  it 's awesome . 
  like wise !, 
  i looked at those supports and thought : `` yeah , they 'd totally work , not . '', 
  got ta love nintendo . 
  i like this bridge arch , this is good arch . 
  i despise this woman , but i agree with the point . 
  * do n't kill me for mentioning this *, 
  however , i recall hearing or reading , that the lower classes in britain , have been recorded playing a game colloquially know as `` football '' since at least the 1600s , possibly earlier , albeit unrecorded . 
  * this is a vague recollection of something that may well not be fact * : - please do n't, 
  oh i agree , the game to which i referencing i recall it consisting of two teams chasing 1 ball , that they kick , up and down a pitch with points scored for it going in a goal , of between two posts , and that teams did n't have a formal size cap . 
  gloves and a hat . 
  i do n't do dick pics , so may i snapchat too ? 
  i know someone whom worked at the mcdonalds in the atheletes village at the london 2012 olympics , and he served usain bolt 20 chicken nuggets , so that kinda supports this claim . 
  also i 'm fairly certain that usain bolt himself said this 100 nuggets comment in an interview after the 2008 olympics, 
  i agree agriculture uses alot of water , however bottled water companies are still pretty bad, 
  people who want more towels ? 
  not all students are pretentious . 
  a lot are , but not all : c, 
   ... oh right !, 
  i havent ripped my vag to shreds pushing out a devil spawn . 
  ftfy, 
  it 's always more than you expect !, 
  i have occasionally read some through again , and it 's always surprises me how some characters re-appear when you do n't expect them . 
  as in the computer games software ? 
  oh , well that was to be expected , it 's about trains !, 
  much like my reason for this post being i was reading this while going , `` i 'll be firing a steam engine tomorrow '' . 
  i 'll add that to my growing list of why i 'd rather live in scotland than england . 
  local mps do n't hold any real sway over local affairs , they have less control than say you local councillors . 
  sounds like most rural suffolk pubs . 
   `` it 's not me , it 's you '', 
  reminded me of rhett and link 's the break up song . 
  i live close to the essex/suffolk border , so have visited a number of pubs that are much the same . 
  they still have n't seen total sense . 
  the high court may have declared it legal across the us , however they have n't put down any protections against discrimination of homosexual people . 
  * tips hat *, 
  i saw him in the sun on the train on friday morning . 
  it was 7am ( i 'm a student ) and was horrified by how poor the writing in the sun is ( no surprise in hindsight - also the paper have been left on my seat on the train ) and also that he was berating the queen on her supposed `` pro-eu '' speech , a speech that i felt was appropriate . 
  that will be a pacer for at least 10 more years !, 
  good luck : /, 
  i imagine he 's trained to incapacitate with the most efficiency , so probably a slash or a shot somewhere non-vital . 
  for south west trains you can go in and pick up a form from any manned railway station . 
  and it 's 30 minutes . 
  virgin seem to have good customer service for their tv and broadband too , i would say it 's a virgin wide company thing , but then i have no experience with the planes , so i do n't know if that is the same . 
  actually from exeter you have the option of taking south west trains to london waterloo . 
  for an extra hour 's journey and ~ ~ probably an identical ~ ~ * a larger * price on a similarly uncomfortable train . 
  edit : checked train prices . 
  and formatting, 
  ahh but it 's better at it than jet fuel . 
  ftfy, 
  but what about north korea ? 
  light-saber duels are way better . 
  whoever invented glow in the dark condoms needs a pat on the back . 
  ^ ^ just ^ ^ kidding ^ ^ i 've ^ ^ not ^ ^ actually ^ ^ done ^ ^ this . 
  well , russia is `` can i fix it at home ? '', 
  and austrailia is `` look kids , nature kills ! '', 
  have been reading the discworld vimes ' storyline again , am on jingo at the moment , will be on either fifth elephant or through to nights watch by monday probably .
