  i play with my friends , that tends to do the trick for me . 
  it 's a hard life is n't it ? 
  it 's new to me . 
  and there was me expecting a aztec jaguar warrior from civ 3 : /,

  this is a superb description of how most are responding to this situation, 
  this seems to be the status quo atm . 
  ftfy ? 
  yup . 
  if they truly understood the people that wanted to use them , they 'd be open till 11 to combat the little sainsbugs and tescos `` that are stealing their business '' . 
  i mean even all the old dears that do n't do anything during the day now seem to go to tescos rather than any local shops . 
  ahh , sounds like my sort of pub !, 
  i think it will be a long ^ time ^ till ^ this bottoms out . 
  busses in norfolk will still be cash only in 2050, 
  it 's not familiar to anything i know of on british railways , could be american , but i 'm not sure . 
  by the looks of it , the rudder is in a fixed position with the rest of the raft . 
  edit : plus it may well be attached to the ground . 
  i 've seen similar at some of the modern playgrounds here . 
  bullshitting about how good i am . 
  and talking about trains . 
  albeit i may be higher than a 10 at that ... 
  i like your flair, 
  germany . 
  i like the production and science , just push to tanks and then blitzkreig them all xd, 
  yeah , first class on aga is only ever really worth it on the intercity services to norwich . 
  all the other services have for first class is a tiny compartment with less and ^ * supposedly * more comfortable seats, 
  they 've also just replaced the cabinet room with a bouncy castle . 
  both english too ... with a username like that i expected you to be canadian . 
  it worries me , because it 's driving the best people out of healthcare professions , and that is taking the nhs on a downward spiral . 
  drs 's new paint job for you . 
  i prefer in in [ chilterns mainline livery ] ( http://www.mainlinediesels.net/index.php?nav=1000001&amp;lang=en&amp;file=vl_2689_59&amp;action=image ) . 
  i think it 's fabulous , whereas the [ class 70 ... ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/41/trimley_branch_line_-_freightliner_70017.jpg ) * shudders *, 
  you need a better auto-correct if it spells stupid like that . 
  well i know that the livery was stolen . 
  but wrexham and shropshire never had 68s , so my point still stands , 
  i personally find the new scotrail livery a bit complicated too . 
  i 'll put it down to personal taste . 
  to be fair , if i had to pick i 'd prefer fl 's green . 
  i can see that , however for me that comes across as aggressive , a trait i usually apply to large american locomotives . 
  whereas i prefer my trains to look sleek or professional . 
  i 'll put it down to personal preference . 
  as a brit , seeing the flared radiators at all makes me tut disapprovingly . 
  it does n't look like they have a dummy for the air brake pipes , so they may just be controlled by the valve ? 
  i 'm merely speculating from what i see , i always thought train break-pipes had a dummy for the pipe , but i also know the air brake pipes on a loco have that valve . 
  these , like many passenger trains in the uk tend to be run in push-pull mode ( or be a multiple unit ) , with a driving cab at each end , so the driver has no real reason to be looking backwards out of the cab . 
  cheeeeeeeeeky nandos !, 
  only because my mate the archbish of banterbury suggested we go there . 
  you 'd sit it on top of the engine to boil . 
  typhoon . 
  that open suck-hole man . 
  no , sorry it 's 4pm, 
  [ `` but there is n't any war when the clock strikes 4 ,,

  go for it !, 
  get some braavosi coins , and * valar morghulis * . 
  20 , started with civ 3 , still prefer it too :d, 
  to me waste disposal suggests tower block living . 
  you are correct , i was about to say the same . 
  class 60 's are so rare on uk mainlines today xd, 
  eat an apple . 
  it 's a rare occurrence in manchester , but a daily one in russia . 
  thank you for this , it has substantially brightened my day :d, 
   `` in our reactor ? '' he thought about it for a moment . 
  `` you 'd die pretty quickly , before reaching the water , from gunshot wounds . '', 
  security was obviously a low point there . 
  yup , from about a 2m distance they dent a tin can . 
  and then takes about 4/5 shots to topple a stack of 6 . 
  they 'd only ever cause damage if they went in an eye or a ear or something . 
  anywhere else you 'd feel it , but it 'd cause as much damage as a paint-ball might . 
  have a friend who 's a cadet and is n't a twat . 
  ( albeit he has mentioned most of the other cadets are . ), 
  my area !, 
  i suppose i can see some similarities , but i would n't say doppelganger, 
  it 's happening everywhere : /, 
  see mia solis in the side bar , 
  it 's because of the `` big man '' history ideals , it 's far easier to pin it all to one man than to go into all the details . 
  it 's simpler for the vast majority of people ( ie the ones in the real world ) to be able to root for one man than to try to understand all the complex intricacies . 
  depends which book you 're on . 
  i think it does ? 
  i feel like i should mine like this more often as it 's realistic . 
  tea !? 
  yes please sir !, 
  lilith lust ( or rainia belle ), 
  [ more can be found in this comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/cumsluts/comments/3g0bpr/redhead_cum_selfie/ctvee8n ), 
  you 're as good as england & wales , so yep , 
  proximity to russia maybe ? 
  to be honest , i got the impression scunthorpe might have been a good place because tiny temper ( or whatever bastardised spelling he uses ) has n't been there . 
  i 've only known it as trainspotting in the uk . 
  railfan seems to be a continental / american term . 
  yep , that too !, 
  i forgot to say that , especially as i prefer to see myself as a railway enthusiast  . < and worse , i often make the distinction purely because i 'm not one for tracking the individual numbers of an engine , but almost instantly distinguish the class of a loco at a glance . 
  it 's boring because i mostly see 66s , 70s and 90s , with the occasional 86 pair . 
  : / oh and not forget units . 
  industrialisation , mechanization of work , modernisation/digitalisation , widespread education , and ( hopefully ) enlightened masses over throwing * corrupt * / wasteful warlike governments to allow the creation of progressive liberal governments . 
  aha yes !, 
  on another note , i 've heard that some 20s have been overhauled and fitted with a silencer ? 
  i was curious whether anyone has heard similar ? 
  do you mean the star or the numbers ? 
  neither makes much sense to me ?
