  it ; s fantasic . 
  however ^ i ^ always ^ imagined ^ him ^ as ^ a ^ bit ^ taller , but as it 's you , basically more rust and dents will do the trick  and keep up the excellent work !, 
  ahh okay , still a drop extreme to call it a war crime :p, 
  hmm , well that may well be skewing my view . 
  very good shot though , 
  hmm til . 
  yup , i almost certainly retract my point , you are taller than me and that 's probably how tall i 'd expect him . 
  well , i do hope you enjoyed your near death experience !, 
  yus i realise that now ... 
  tell me about it , i honestly did n't know , the geneva conventions are not something that i 've read so far in my life : / i 'm happy to have enlightened , but it 's always lovely to see the dark side of people . 
  i believe , that it is a cast designed for that purpose to fit around a ~ ~ [ maxim machine gun ] ( http://browningmgs.com/maxim/photos/maxim_1904.jpg ) ~ ~ [ vickers machine gun ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c9/vickers_iww.jpg ) . 
  which look pretty much the same .

  i 'm a third year civil engineer , and i 'm in southsea , but quite close to lidl and fratton station , yourself ? 
  hmm , not a uncommon idea for dealing with flies . 
  i know of a building that used to be insulated with horse hair , and every summer they smoke bomb it and it 'd clear out the flies . 
  i think for me it 's the concept of approaching the world from a different and idealised angle . 
  for example by reinvigorating bits of history by wearing fashions that to other 's may seem outdated , but giving them a spin that also carries a flair of fantasy . 
  i also find that the industrial undertones of it all come across as strangely beautiful , in the same way i think steam trains are fascinating . 
  well at least you were earlier than me !, 
  30th of october 2011, 
  `` great western '' electrification ( if you ignore anything south of bristol ) will totally be done by 2018 . 
  totally . 
  oh , well i suppose by comparison we do have a improvement . 
  especially since the govt is moving toward approving hs2, 
  do n't forget she has a fandom !, 
  actually , i think there was a twist with the law about a glass of wine with a meal from ~ ~ 13 ~ ~ 16 up , but only one and only with a meal . 
  although that might apply to restaurants rather than pubs ? 
  edit , just seen the [ actual gov.uk guidance ] ( https://www.gov.uk/alcohol-young-people-law ) in [ another guys comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/london/comments/3n3wjq/is_there_a_minimum_age_for_pubes/cvkqlvh ), 
  so it was !, 
  my apologies . 
  i saw that and came here hoping to upvote it . 
  it 's rather amusing :d, 
  i voted . 
  i 'd like to join the greens please . 
  i think i completed this survey this morning , 
  it 's often because , at least for here in the uk , the media is largely owned by people who will benefit from this deal being passed . 
  chartered trains are common in the uk as people will pay to have a meal on a train pulled by a steam loco, 
  [ i 'm sorry , i 'll pass on electronic voting , thanks . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3_0x6oadmi ), 
  yup 4 of the largest read newspapers in the uk are owned by one guy , who is ( most probably ) in support of ttip, 
  in the uk at least , there are plenty of checks and re-checks that stop tampering at practically every stage of our voting process . 
  but yes , for the time being i shall keep my opinion . 
  i 'd rather it be a system that requires a large scale operation to tamper with than one that can be affected by one person , practically anywhere in the world . 
  i am , and yea , he 's one wealthy and powerful man . 
  yeah but it 's not particularly impartial atm . 
  e ~ formatting, 
  i too have this problem . 
  especially as i use one of the ** massive ** sports direct mugs, 
  this has just reminded me i 've not have tea for nearly two weeks : c, 
  i 'm owed a pint for my pain though , so i 'm holding out . 
  yup , i saw that recently so am now in on this one . 
  only the best geometry equipment . 
  i 've learnt something new today, 
  this !, 
  3 and 6 xd, 
  i have never seen that brand of pencil ... 
  the best make , and the one i use is staedtler, 
  i think so too !, 
  i always feel awkward when people start slating them , because it leaves me going ^ ^ um , ^ ^ excuse , ^ ^ but ^ ^ i ^ ^ think ^ ^ it ^ ^ looks ^ ^ quite ^ ^ appealing , ^ ^ actually . 
  ticket to ride ftw !, 
  cloudy . 
  please it 's before the watershed . 
  that 's pollution : - not hail . 
  it 's half ironic as you guys probably made the sheeple . 
  but you see aluminium cans everywhere ? 
  and they 're like 0.1 weight for 1 aluminium , so i have a plentiful supply of the stuff , i struggle more getting all the oil and copper i need !, 
  i did not know this , thank you kind sir . 
  i shall start planting more corn . 
  omg shoot it . 
  i mean , literally shoot it . 
  it 's what i 've been doing . 
  yeah i know !, 
  it 's really useful, 
  even better, 
  this , i 'm from essex , which is the bottom bit of east anglia , and it infruiates me when we get grouped as south east england, 
  why does draft , or rather : out of a keg , taste better than both ? 
  i feel a bit left out as i only have half a suit of t-51 , but i have 4 complete suits of t-60 . 
  well you get given a full suit by the bos , and i 've found 3 other incomplete ones , of which 2 made 1 complete set , and the third i brought the missing t-60 pieces from the bos quartermaster . 
  i also revenetly found an incomplete set of x-01 , but i looked up the quest i found it on , so i 'm that level now : /, 
  as for raider , i 've collected one set , but i think it looks quite grotesque , so when i 've since encountered 2 more , i have n't bothered to collect them . 
  true fact , they 've been used to sell things for many years . 
  ah there 's the raider camp at the school near the castle , the barbed wire !, 
  90 % air , could n't shoot through it . 
  explains why i 'm friendly but skeptical to them !, 
  i always prefer imperial guard ; fooking tanks man . 
  coffee cups . 
  coffee cups everywhere . 
  yup !, 
  it 's the current that kills !, 
  basically the english civil war ( 1642-1651 ) happened , and that left oliver cromwell in charge as lord protector , of the commonwealth of england , which at the time would include our colonies . 
  after he dies , the role of lord protector goes over to his son , richard , and in reality , this guy was a pussy and lost the throne back to charles ii in 1659 . 
  my guess is that this map is / u/joejoe98 's idea of how this would have progressed had richard not lost the commonwealth , and passed it on to his sons after him . 
  ( my guess is james , and james . 
  ( ii ) which would bring us to about the 1750s . 
  they 've had 200 years to forget things like the human rights act . 
  i 've used the flare gun twice . 
  both times : no minutemen are available to assist you . 
  i have 6 settlements with 5-18 people .
