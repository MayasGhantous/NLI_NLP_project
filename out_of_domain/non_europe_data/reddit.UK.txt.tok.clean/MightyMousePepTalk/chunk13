  i get why , but i hate the assumption that all teenagers are out to cause trouble . 
  when i was 14 i was waiting with some friends to be picked up from the cinema . 
  we were getting bored so we started playing leap frog on the bollards outside the electronics shop . 
  the security guard comes out and kindly asks us to stop and move on . 
  fair enough , he was nice about it , we left . 
  what pissed me off was when he went back inside the shop erupted with applause . 
  i mean , wtf ? 
  still pissed about that . 
  i work for a high-voltage dc interconnector under the north sea . 
  you could not use ac for this as you would lose too much energy . 
  when the cable makes landfall it goes into a convertor station and feeds into the ac grid . 
  they do work together already . 
  to add to this : they come in pairs ( that your house shows well ) :, 
  / r/palletstorage, 
  or a cow, 
  the way op wrote it , yes it should be ox 's liver . 
  if op dropped the 's ' ` beef liver ' would also be an acceptable translation . 
  either way , you were right to correct . 
  really enjoyed this one . 
  the last bit especially i found hilarious . 
  i welcome the dutch rulers of the galaxy . 
  hup holland hup . 
  do you know dictionary of numbers ? 
  well immediately after you said, 
  `` compared with mt everest at almost 9km '', 
  it said to me :, 
  [ \u2248 height of the highest mountain on earth , mount everest ], 
  maths checks out . 
  yes , but then sealand expanded it 's water to incorporate most of norfolk . 
  eu rules neither was legit so both had to back down . 
  sort of de facto recognition from uk . 
  ah , looking it up , you are right . 
  i got my knowledge mixed up . 
  sealand did extend it waters to incorporate much of norfolk , but as it is an artificial installation it has no territorial waters . 
  however , i was correct about the de facto status ( but for the wrong reasons , i admit ) : taken from the [ sealand website ] ( http://www.sealandgov.org/history ) :, 
   since roy was still a british citizen a summons was issued under the fire arms act and on the 25th of november 1968 . 
  roy and michael were in the dock of the crown court of chelmsford assizes in essex . 
  there was much argument and laws going back to the 17th century were called upon . 
  during his summing up the judge said `` this is a swash buckling incident perhaps more akin to the time of `` sir francis drake '' but it is my judgment is that the uk courts have no jurisdiction . '' this was sealand 's first de facto recognition . 
  no one else mentioned it , but i wanted to mention [ hutt river province ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/principality_of_hutt_river ) to you op and ill do my best to eli5 :, 
  1972 declared independence from australia after writing to the queen informing her of his intention . 
  received no response inside 2 years . 
  under [ convention of montevideo ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/montevideo_convention ) this gave it the right to self-determination ( the right to be your own country ) . 
  threatened with legal action . 
  leader of country gave himself a royal title to take advantage of british 1495 treason act . 
  still going today . 
  in france , it is never the pedestrian 's fault , even if it totally is . 
  similar story in limburg , south netherlands , except they are goat people ( as limburg is hilly ( ish ) . 
  comes from this story http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/buckriders, 
  i like to think parts of gelderland will be fine . 
  if not i 'll head back to them southern hills . 
  hmm , thinking about it , op did say holland , so * technically * noord and zuid would be fucked ... 
  [ do you like clown hats ?

  go onto the mainz website . 
  it will tell you the fixtures and when the tickets will go on sale . 
  as for when the dates become firm i dont know , but i would guess about a month in advance . 
  edit : [ here you go ] ( http://www.mainz05.de/mainz05/stadion/ticketing.html#!stadion/ticketing/vorverkauf.html ) . 
  this site tells you when the tickets go on general sale `` freier verkauf '' for home games . 
  this will obvious get updated closer to each game . 
  i could paint a romantic picture of the golden glow of the street lights and she was german . 
  really , my group of mates awkwardly waited for me and her mates awkwardly for her under the horrid glare of the lamp post . 
  i also asked her if i could kiss her in my poor german : * darf ich du kussen ? 
  on the plus side she was german and i cupped a feel . 
  pretty win . 
  i think a nordic cross is not a bad choice , but it would obviously have to be a bit further away from st george 's cross . 
  the vikings settled all over the north of england , including down the southern cumbria . 
  [ and if the normans get a nordic cross ] ( http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:normandy_flag_large.svg ) , the north of england could too !, 
  the mouvement normand does use the st olaf flag as an unofficial norman flag . 
  the word unofficial is the key word and i only meant that they had a flag they used . 
  the vikings settled all over the north , otherwise the town and place names we see today would not exist . 
  the dialect of cumbrian comes from old norse, 
  if you have to take a day off work to wait for a delivery thats on you . 
  if you have to take a second day off because they failed to show up the company has to compensate you for your loss of income ( amount up to the cost of one days wage . 
  i know that did n't quite happen to you , but i thought you should know . 
  also , i always get packages sent to my work , because then i will always get them and i do not have to wait at home . 
  disagree with this but only because i find them very useful for my work . 
  not everyone needs one and for people who ` think ' they need one , like your students , they are a gimmick . 
  however , i travel a lot for work so i only want to bring a limited amount of luggage with me and i want to keep it light . 
  having a tablet is much easier ( especially at airport security ) than having a laptop and much lighter . 
  the point that / u/i _ drink_cereal made is valid . 
  ipads are for content consumption . 
  i have a windows surface . 
  these are much better for content creation ( it has microsoft office on it . ), 
  so , they are n't totally useless . 
  edit : i a word, 
  / r/britishproblems, 
  i was n't chastising you !, 
  made me laugh at it was a very british problem !, 
  it 's probably something to do with them trying to be more ` healthy ' by not including in the meal deal . 
  a sandwich and drink is n't real a ` meal ' imo . 
   i was just using simpler language for an audience ( people from the uk ) who probably do n't know the fine details of black history in america . 
  woah , that 's highly presumptuous !, 
  that photo is one of the most famous and is not affiliated with jesse owens ( at least not directly ) . 
  call it the black power stance but certain do not assume that you have to use ` simpler ' language for one of the most iconic images of the 20th century . 
  it certainly was not a ` fine detail ' of black history . 
  it was even in forest gump !, 
  anyway , i do agree your suggestion would be a powerful message . 
  at first i thought `` oh great . 
  another crappy page about how much the english want to be germany '' but this is actually really good !,
