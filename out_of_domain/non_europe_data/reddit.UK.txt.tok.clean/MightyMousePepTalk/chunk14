  as an english speaker with limited german i have bookmarked this page . 
  many thanks . 
  [ the one in stuttgart you have not missed !, 
  ] ( http://www.stuttgart-tourist.de/en/search-book/e-stuttgart-beer-festival-2013-241 ) ( event site [ here ] ( http://www.cannstatter-volksfest.de/index.php?id=2&amp;l=1 ) ) there was one in spring , maybe that 's the one you thought you missed ? 
  edit : apparently this one is the second largest in germany !, 
  anyway , there is also one in [ bamberg ] ( http://www.volksfeste-in-deutschland.de/sandkerwa-in-bamberg.html ) at the end of august . 
  there is also one in erlanger at some point , not sure when . 
  my second link goes to the website you posted . 
  it 's probably called the stuttgart beer festival to make it clearer to non-germans ( like myself ) who would n't know what the wasen pertains to . 
  my gp will ask patients how they are . 
  when they reply `` fine thanks '' ( british ) he will say `` ah , we 'll soon change that ! '', 
  i do n't like this . 
  curse you for posting it !, 
  ok , not really . 
  it 's just i travel * a lot * for work . 
  lot 's of expenses . 
  i * would love * a credit card . 
  thinking of all those rewards i could acrue makes me salivate . 
  however , due to technicalities i am on a work agency contract . 
  by dutch law i 'm not allowed a credit card . 
  have to pay for everything with cash/debit card . 
  makes me cry . 
  i do n't think this applied to ireland . 
  i knew plenty of kevin 's there doing well for themselves . 
  edit : my bad . 
  did n't realise op only meant in germany !, 
  met a turk called anil . 
  in english it was unfortunately hilarious . 
  did n't realise op meant in german !, 
  in no position to comment there . 
  your username . 
  where i studied my bachelor there was a guy in the mountaineering society who was called herman and was german ... 
  yup , and one of the first known instances of this practices being done for height rather than distance was in my home town in [ northern england !,

  just ctrl + f this thread for lorc\u00e1n / lorcan . 
  nothing . 
  why are we always forgotten !, 
  thank you for this . 
  i live in nl and i never knew . 
  i worked at mcdonald 's for a summer and thank you for posting some sense !, 
  edit : ca n't spell, 
  how was that helpful ? 
  at least post the correct spelling . 
  that 's how [ louis braille ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/louis_braille#early_life ) went blind . 
  i recall from my history degree that the loss of the thirteen colonies signals the beginning of the second british empire ( from an historians viewpoint ) as they then turned their attention to other parts of the globe , australia , india etc. 
  also , there is the theory of informal empire . 
  sure , the thirteen colonies were no longer british , but they are still going to trade with britain so britain still has influence . 
  even without that theory , they would still trade so britain would still make money . 
  i was once denied a student discount as my student card `` did n't have a expiration date '' . 
  i did n't push the issue as i had graduated and it was a paltry 10 % but i know that guy was in the wrong !, 
  it said student discount but did n't specify that the id had to have an expiry date . 
  i 'm sure if i kicked up a fuss i could 've gotten it . 
  like i said , i did n't because i was no longer a student . 
  i have a traditional irish name , but it was also chosen as its pronunciation is like the spelling , unlike some irish names . 
  i do n't live in an english speaking country anymore so i 've actually changed how i pronounce my own name . 
  there are two ways anyway , so i just switched . 
  if i in a situation like op i just use my surname so i can say `` murray , like andy murray '' . 
  although i 've still been called barry as a result . 
  does n't bother me then , as i still get my stuff !, 
  ( hopefully i do n't steal from barry 's ), 
  in other situations i 've got the nato phonetic alphabet down so spell it easier . 
  tip , if you have the altgr key on your keyboard ( even on a laptop , its to the right of spacebar ) you can do l\u00f3ts \u00f3f f\u00e1d\u00e1s \u00f3n \u00e1ny v\u00f3w\u00e9l . 
  y\u00f3\u00fa s\u00e9\u00e9 ? 
  ( \u00ed ) how ? 
  hold altgr then press the the vowel . 
  makes spelling my name , which has a fada , much easier . 
  only works with fadas , not grave or those hungarian double accents . 
  edit : typo, 
  oh ... then my tip was useless . 
  i have failed you . 
  [ i am ashamed .

  was the ibis sign an actual sign or a sign put up by ibis ? 
  in that case the fault is not with dutch road signs but with the unofficial sign put up by the hotel . 
  also , dutch diversion signs are yellow , what colour was the ibis one ? 
  ( i live there and have never had a difficulty with their signs , except the one that means that cars coming from the right have/no longer have priority , that was confusing ) . 
  i was thinking the same thing , also there are to people in the background of the shot . 
  one head to the right of the shot , and another by the flagman 's left leg . 
  standard for me that . 
  although i usually announce it with a subtle `` it just got warmer ! '', 
  the last shadow puppets - the age of the understatement, 
  you get my upvote for two reasons :, 
  cumbria !, 
  haha , love it !, 
  i actually meant to write danger mouse but when it came to registering , my mind went blank . 
  i do not know why peptalk came into my head . 
  i studied history then i studied political science . 
  i think i hate myself ... 
  i liked the methaphor and how it worked so nicely with the username . 
  leuven or louvain . 
  are you walloon or flemish ? 
  are you proddy or catholic ? 
  you know , for science . 
  that film needs to be understood before watched . 
  watched it once . 
  thought it was utter shit . 
  had it explained . 
  omg . 
  amazing . 
  you seen a self made hero ?
