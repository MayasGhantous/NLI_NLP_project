  un h\u00e9ro tr\u00e8s distrect ( on ipad auto correct a bitch ), 
  early next year at the latest is what i have heard . 
  they have finished filming and are editing . 
  i 'm mobile right now so i do n't have a link , but i think churchill considered the 7 years war ( french indian war ) to be the first world war as it involved several countries . 
  so even before the ~ ~ revolt of the 13 colonies ~ ~ american revolution . 
  edit : [ found it ] ( http://www.huntington.org/huntingtonlibrary_02.aspx?id=7010 ) he says it in his book * a history of english speaking peoples * . 
  during my googling , [ this wiki page ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_war ) was interesting , showing all the ` world wars ' before the the great war . 
  similarly , `` nuking the fridge '' is the term applied to a scene in a movie where a character survives such an impossible scenario that you know they will survive any future mortal peril , thus removing any suspense . 
  stephen moffat for you . 
  he just makes it a big mess imo . 
  brilliant in sherlock ( although you unfortunately still get glimpses of it ) , but moffat is great in one off episodes ( the girl in the fireplace , the empty child , blink - my favourite episodes ) , but as head writer he goes full retard . 
  best i can do is sportlemon.tv . 
  that usually has a link to sportschau stream . 
   except maybe the super rich in private schools . 
  except maybe ~ ~ the super rich ~ ~ in private schools . 
  went to private school . 
  not super rich . 
  not even rich . 
  comfortable , yes . 
  was not an expensive private school . 
  you 're welcome to your opinion , but if you actually met some of the people who attended my school you would n't think that . 
  been with my so for 6 and a half years now . 
  finance . 
  do n't have enough money to do it yet and we would rather save our money to spend on other things , such as a trip we are planning to latin america, 
  also , i have a large family and it will be a bitch to organise logistically . 
  we 're still young , so no need to get married yet . 
  plenty of time for that . 
  certainly no added benefit from a bureaucracy perspective . 
  edit : i accidently a word, 
  umbrellas . 
  fuck umbrellas . 
  a combination of me forgetting i meant to write danger mouse and then the next two words in my head . 
  pretty much this but just to add what / u/sp00ked _ yuh said , but in a slightly different way . 
  you tell them what you are doing . 
  let each other know what you are up to and trust each other . 
  not going to work without trust . 
  my so and i did long distance for 5 years and now live together . 
  it can work . 
  you just have to want to try . 
   lake windermere . 
  ~ ~ lake ~ ~ windermere . 
  this annoyed me more than it should have . 
  i experienced bullet time once too , but never to such a hair raising event . 
  was playing in goals ( football/soccer ) . 
  i had a torrid season with no clean sheets . 
  we were winning 1-0 . 
  almost the end of the match and the opposition had a throw-in . 
  the thrower launched a fast throw into the area , which their striker headed , pretty powerfully . 
  that 's when time stopped . 
  i watched the ball . 
  saw it was going to go over my defender 's head into the top corner . 
  decided i would have time to dive and save it . 
  dived , hit the tip of my finger , onto the bar . 
  time returned to normal . 
  then i heard someone shout : `` who is that guy ?!, 
  i am signing him on football manager ! '', 
  we won 1-0 . 
  i would go to the town hall and ask there . 
  also , your local library/librarian . 
  definitely . 
  but then [ this is better than northern rail .

  hungarian wine is awesome . 
  i went to [ vill\u00e1ny ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vill%c3%a1ny ) in the summer and that place makes amazing wine . 
  it 's on the same longtitude as bordeaux but has no sea so apparently this makes it even better but you will pay half the price you would for , say , a wine as good as a saint-emillion . 
  also , the man at the winery said that the best oak for wine barrels comes from california , france , and hungary . 
  the winery we went to was [ wunderlich ] ( http://wunderlich.hu/visit-us/wine-cellar/ ) ( family name , as the area was settled by serbs and swabians ( stuttgart area of germany ) ), 
  so yeah , i agree . 
  edit : added hyperlinks, 
  bit of balsamic vinegar , a bit of sugar ? 
  amazing strawberries ready to serve !, 
  personally , i would put nbynw higher up because i have seen all of the above ( except alien ) and i enjoyed it much more than some of them . 
  that said , i 'm going to rewatch pulp fiction because it has been aaaages . 
  but for a list of 9 movies you 're going to have people complain at your own opinion . 
  i totally agree . 
  try voetbal international www.vi.nl, 
  `` what is australian football ? '', 
  `` gaelic football , with a rugby ball , on a cricket pitch . '', 
  `` that explained nothing . '', 
  yes, 
  i consider coupling to be the uk version of friends . 
  3 glorious seasons . 
  they sit in a pub , not a coffee ~ ~ shop ~ ~ house . 
  edit : coffeeshop would probably be the dutch version, 
  the creator of coupling writes sherlock and is the current head writer of doctor who . 
  although he can create overly complicated plots at times , he 's usually fairly solid . 
  in fairness , i never watched 4 . 
  i saw the one episode and just went `` nope . '', 
  i did n't give it a chance, 
  learnt about him in second year of my history degree . 
  man was amazing . 
  man i go to great portland street loads . 
  next time i 'm in london , i 'm walking a little bit further to baker street and checking that out !, 
  you , safaridiscoclub , just made my list ... of things to see ... a bit longer . 
  brick roads can be smooth , especially when laid correctly . 
  [ here is the dutch method ] ( http://q8allinone.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/tiger-stone-the-brick-road-laying-machine.jpg ), 
  i recently got my french passport and i was not born in france either but my mother was french . 
  i did not have a french id before i applied ( i did have a very expired french passport , but i lost it ) . 
  the two main things i had to provide were my french birth certificate ( you were probably registered with the local consulate by your mother in which case you should have a french birth cert even if you were born in switzerland . 
  i was born in uk and have uk birth cert and french birth cert ),
