  ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ think ^ ^ ^ they 're ^ ^ ^ delicious, 
  good lad that kid . 
  probably the closest i 'll ever get to seeing ulverston on reddit !, 
  probably the total amount of ulverstonian redditors !, 
  good effort though and a good place to have it !, 
  nikki minaj - starships . 
  pretty sure my so would move out if they knew ... 
  australia is still the continental mainland though . 
  like europe . 
  the main land mass is the continent , but the islands are just part of the continent . 
  so australia is the continental mainland of australasia . 
  although , i think that is often disputed . 
  aqua ? 
  i 'm pretty sure they do have something like craig 's list if the uk had gumtree and the netherlands has marktplaats . 
  in fact , i just checked and they do . 
  it 's called markt.de . 
  this is even easier though as you just dump it on the street , rather than having to photograph it , put it online . 
  lot of effort , that . 
  no , no . 
  they as in the gender ambiguous they . 
  something we need to use in english more . 
  i am using the they in the singular . 
  the royal they . 
  but that 's just like my opinion man . 
  fair enough . 
  i just did quick google search based on the dutch version . 
  good to know as i live on the border with germany . 
  in the heat of the night . 
  germany did not need to invade belgium , you 're right , but it was part of their military strategy to circumvent the heaviest area of french forces on the franco-german border , which they were to still attack , but with a diversionary force ( the schlieffen plan ) . 
  of course , this plan was diluted and ultimately failed in its goal to knock france out of the war and only succeeded in bringing britain into the war . 
  so did the germans need to ? 
  no , but i can understand the strategy . 
  i do agree with you in terms of the nationalistic remembrance . 
  phrases like the * rape of belgium * only add to this . 
  if we can talk about the [ remembrance poppy ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/remembrance_poppy ) that we have in the uk . 
  it is a symbol to remember those who lost their lives in world war i ( originally ) and now it is for all those who lost their lives in all wars . 
  on face value , i like this , as they should be remembered , because they lost their lives in a futile endeavour . 
  but now ? 
  now , if you are in the public eye , you * have to * wear a poppy . 
  if you do n't you will be criticised for being unpatriotic , a monster with no heart , and you will get abuse , as a female newsreader in the uk received . 
  if wearing it becomes an obligation , then it ceases to be an act of remembrance . 
  ( the newsreader chose not to wear it as she supports many charities and she did not want to discriminate in favour of one particular one ) . 
  so what is my point ? 
  well we have now entered into an era of hero worship , especially with the conflicts in iraq and afghanistan . 
  they are our brave boys , fighting overseas and we have learnt nothing from wwi . 
  hero worship prevents a debate ; it prevents legitimate criticism and to do so would label you has unpatriotic and * just would n't be cricket old boy * . 
  calling the fallen from wwi ( and wwii ) heros , should not be done . 
  they should be remembered , and they should be remembered for their sacrifice . 
  not because they were heros , not because they were defending our freedom , but because their deaths were futile , satisfying the ambitions of the elite . 
  to quote wilfried owen 's * dulce et decorum est * :, 
  * if you could hear , at every jolt , the blood, 
  come gargling from the froth-corrupted lungs ,, 
  obscene as cancer , bitter as the cud, 
  of vile , incurable sores on innocent tongues ,, 
  my friend , you would not tell with such high zest, 
  to children ardent for some desperate glory ,, 
  i recently explained to my so that many people have been outraged by `` blurred lines '' due to its implications of sexual assault . 
  they did n't get it until a spoke the lyrics . 
  they had only thought it was catchy ( granted english is not their native tongue . ), 
  make ~ ~ her ~ ~ him read [ bad science by ben goldacre ] ( http://www.amazon.com/bad-science-ben-goldacre/dp/000728487x ) . 
  my old man is a gp and even though they all want everyone to be vaccinated , he says it still revolutionised his practice . 
  one of the things that really annoyed me about this was tony blair refused to state whether or not his son leo had been vaccinated . 
  it would have done a lot of good if he had called bullshit . 
   the vet said to keep about 2000 $ in cash lying around for emergency vet visit . 
  very wise . 
  my parents have separate bank account just for this dog . 
  they pay a bit of cash into it every month to keep it topped up so they always have cash for the dog , just in case insurance wo n't cover ( although the dog is well insured ), 
  just gon na stop there ? 
  not to forget that dael comes from dalr of old norse !, 
  i come from an area of england where we had lot of vikings but anglo-saxons ? 
  not so much . 
  pretty much all the names in the area come from old norse !, 
  i love learning about language related to my area and now , thanks you , i know that the word dollar is related to all the dales in my county !, 
  whoops . 
  sorry about that . 
  michel thomas method is good ( you can torrent it , not that i condone that , of course ) . 
  hugo : dutch in three months is pretty . 
  i used this to get started my self . 
  other good resource is [ de opmaat ] ( http://www.staatsexamennt2.nl/de_opmaat/algemeen ) , this is sort of the `` official '' book as you begin to work towards getting a qualification ( you dont have to do the test of course ) . 
  you can buy the book on [ amazon \\ ( probably \\ ) ] ( http://www.amazon.co.uk/opmaat-uitgeverij-boom/dp/9085067235/ref=sr_1_1?ie=utf8&amp;qid=1387638970&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=de+opmaat ) . 
  it also then allows you access the material on the website i linked . 
  you can also get it from [ bol.com ] ( http://www.bol.com/nl/p/de-opmaat/1001004006509294/ ) ( dutch amazon ), 
  de opmaat is used in conjuction with [ klare taal . 
  ] ( http://www.amazon.co.uk/klare-taal-uitgebreide-grammatica-nt2/dp/9085062586/ref=sr_1_1?ie=utf8&amp;qid=1387638927&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=klare+taal ) for grammar . 
  you can also get this on [ bol.com ] ( http://www.bol.com/nl/p/klare-taal-cd-rom/1001004002728755/ ), 
  first time i snowboarded ( was working a ski season and i ski ) i followed everyone down everything . 
  i was slow and hopeless and just stuck to my back edge . 
  ate snow a fair few times , but i did n't plummet to my death on the black so that was good . 
  this this two more days and on night of the 3rd day i had a dream that told me how to shift my weight . 
  4th day i was much better and could indeed shift my weight to use both edges without falling over !, 
  not saying i was amazing , but more competent . 
  may have had something to do with smashing my head on ice the 3rd day and being blind for a few seconds ( i recall , but my memory is fuzzy ) . 
  what a silly man . 
  if he was there so early why did n't he just queue to get the fancy seats that do n't sell !, 
  i tried to get the fancy seats that do n't sell ( i believe they sell them 10 minute before curtains so you could get a 200 $ seat for 10 $ , if i remember well ) . 
  i did n't and stood to watch swan lake . 
  several people fainted . 
  i like bill bryson in notes from a small island when he says if anyone . 
  could have put up with communism it would have been the british . 
  we just would have gotten on with it .
