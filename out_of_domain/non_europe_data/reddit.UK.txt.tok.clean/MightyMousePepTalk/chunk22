  disclaimer : i am from furness and would love it to happen . 
  it is not going to . 
  firstly , windermere is actually closer to the m6 than barrow is to coniston ( the closest body of water to barrow ) so it would make no economical sense to build a bridge from barrow to morecambe for tourists . 
  toll everyone ? 
  well then they would just take the quicker and cheaper option via the m6 . 
  ok if they wanted to go to the west coast of cumbria the bridge * might * be quicker . 
  by 5 minutes . 
  so not worth it for the price . 
  if they want renewables in morecambe bay they can test via the existing viaduct . 
  a new bridge will meet with an unholy amount of resistance for ecological reasons . 
  so the entire northwest would not benefit . 
  barrow would benefit . 
  but that would not justify the cost of a # 600m + ( cost completely pulled from my head . 
  this is the cost of a 260km electricity cable from uk to nl ) bridge . 
  unlike the denmark-sweden bridge , it would connect an irrelevant town , with a forgotten town and would be of no great net benefit to the country of england . 
  i want it to happen . 
  it would be great for barrow . 
  it would add nothing to the uk . 
  it 's not happening and it is a pipe dream . 
  did you care for it ? 
  we called our teachers their title and surname in my cumbrian school . 
  mr smith ; dr jones etc etc. 
  started on mort . 
  i used one of those workstands for a party once too !, 
  except it was a standard english ale cask , so it was laid flat and the workstand just kept it in place and people just opened the tapped cask ( and often forgot to close ... ), 
  pretty much exactly what i did ( used a car roof strap to keep it in place ) . 
  the tap was an issue was people would open it , then ` close ' it by turning a full 180 ^ o. 
  lots of spillage . 
  i was taught at uni in a course on the history of science and technology that the guage used in england is how it is simply because that was what was used it in the mines and the same tracks were used by stephenson . 
  why were they that width in the mines ? 
  no idea . 
  if i can piggy back on this thread , some videos that explain hvdc cables and ac/dc convertor stations would be awesome . 
  dracula managed it well enough . 
  never thought i would see the area where i live on xkcd . 
  would be awesome to swim in ullswater if it was tea !, 
  if a bit warm ... 
  randall avoided calling it lake ullswater !, 
  love him for that . 
  bison grass vodka and apple juice . 
  taste like cinnamon apple pie . 
  in czech republic they call it ` strudle ' . 
  i know it has a polish name but i ca n't spell it . 
  in the 1962-1963 season , norwich city 's 3rd round fa cup match v blackpool had been postponed 11 times due to extreme weather in the uk . 
  3rd round fa cup matches are traditionally played in the first weekend of january , but the weather saw a postponement of 566 matches that season . 
  in one desperate attempt to get the match played , [ norwich used a flamethrower to try and defrost the pitch ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/jun/13/theknowledge.sport ) . 
  however , it proved ineffective , for `` as fast the ice melted , it froze again . '', 
  as an aside , [ the fixture list got so congested that the draw for the 5th round , which features 16 teams , had 36 names in the hat . 
  the draw had been moved to a later date \\ ( from 28 jan to 5 march \\ ) , otherwise it would have had 49 teams in the hat !, 
  ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jan/15/knowledge-fa-cup-draw ), 
  one match was drawn as `` walsall or manchester city or birmingham city or bury v norwich city or blackpool or bradford city or newcastle . '', 
  possibly the largest number teams to be drawn for one match . 
  it was eventually played by man city v norwich . 
  just rewards for norwich who went to such extreme lengths to clear their pitch . 
  man utd won the cup that year . 
  because he 's worked for a good mechanic and people see he has started his own company and people say :, 
  `` need to take my car to the shop '', 
  `` oh , jim from john 's cars has just started his own business . 
  john is the best in town but a bit pricey , so i took mine to jim and he was great . '', 
  like that ? 
  you got it rough !, 
  i hit the curb twice in the car park on my test ( and did some other dumb stuff ) . 
  past first time ... only 13 minors !, 
  ( 15 was a fail ) . 
  i would still put my money on a [ panserbjorn . 
  ] ( http://hdm.wikia.com/wiki/category:panserbj%c3%b8rne ), 
  actually , no i would n't . 
  it would cook in its own armour !, 
  the [ portuguese discovery of australia theory ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/theory_of_the_portuguese_discovery_of_australia ) is a thing , but as / u/bagdaddy says , it had little bearing on history . 
  much like the vikings in north america . 
  ok , they got there first , but it has n't really mattered in the grand scheme of things . 
  no , of course not . 
  i love history and the more we can learn and understand , the better . 
  i curse the person who pointed out the finger to me . 
  ca n't bloody unsee it now . 
  i believe jk rowling said that she would go to a caf\u00e9 to write harry potter and see how long she could sit there with just one cup of tea before the staff would get pissed . 
  not that she was playing a game . 
  she was broke and being in the caf\u00e9 was warmer than at home . 
  except :, 
  the hundred years war, 
  war of the league of cambrai, 
  italian war of 1536-38, 
  war of the quadruple alliance, 
  the thirty years war, 
  french spanish war ( 1635 - 1659 ), 
  french conquest of corsica, 
  french revolutionary wars, 
  war of the oranges, 
  finnish war, 
  crimean war, 
  french conquest of algeria, 
  world war one, 
  world war two ( as part of the allies ), 
  algerian war of independence ( military ), 
  so they won plenty of wars . 
  so , mali ? 
  pretty good then . 
   algerian rebellion : lost . 
  loss marks the first defeat of a western army by a non-turkic muslim force since the crusades ,, 
  incorrect . 
  the french were won the military victory against the fln .
