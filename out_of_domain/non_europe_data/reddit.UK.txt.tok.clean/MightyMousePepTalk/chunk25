  i hear plenty of us brit 's get it wrong . 
  he did n't . 
  u2 is a shell company in nl to avoid taxes . 
  same building as rolling stones and ikea and google . 
  makes it worse imo, 
  my dad is irish and he will say to me '' what kind of an eejit are you ? '', 
  he says it because it presupposes that i am am in eejit . 
  the question is what kind . 
  this is the same . 
  brilliant . 
  the irish speak in numbers :, 
  i 'm grand, 
  thanks a million, 
  ca n't remember the actual irish but it translates as a thousand welcomes, 
  mille failt\u00e9 or so, 
  it 's not about citizens . 
  it 's about the corporate tax rate and the way that the netherlands does n't double tax . 
  by that i mean amp major companies register in nl then send their earnings to the caribbean . 
  nl has one of the lowest rates of corporate tax and by registering there companies avoid being doubly taxed as nl has several tax treaties with non-eu countries . 
  so companies earn their money in us or uk for example but only pay the nl corporate tax rate and then send their earnings to the caymen islands or somewhere like that . 
  it 's totally legal but highly criticised . 
  so , the problem is n't the native country , it 's the lack or transparency and general cohesiveness in international corporate tax . 
  fyi u2 is a company . 
  edit : i know uk is eu , my point is that eu companies can do it too with money earnt in other eu countries . 
  hi guys , i really like your comics and i really like your twitter rob . 
  who does the animation and voices for your shorts ? 
  also , will there ever be a prequel to ted bear ? 
  indeed , but that 75 % tax is not the corporate tax rate . 
  the french corporate tax rate is 33.33 % , which is still one of the highest , however . 
  better example would be the [ papal bull issued against elizabeth i by pope pius v ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/regnans_in_excelsis ), 
  northen ireland is part of the uk and they are irish . 
  that rather depends . 
  i have a couple of catholic mates from ni and they call themselves irish . 
  well each person decides for themselves if they feel northern irish or irish . 
   besides , what you 've said does n't bear out in truth . 
  it 's really only the southern english that no-one really likes . 
  you 've lost me . 
  i did n't write the original post . 
  coupled with this :, 
  the most westernly , southernly and eastern points of europe are in france . 
  edit : i mean european union . 
  exactly , la r\u00e9union in the indian ocean is the most easternly and southernly and guadaloupe is the most westernly . 
  both these islands are overseas departments of france , and therefore a part of france . 
  just like any other the departments inside the hexagon ( metropolitan france ) . 
  compare this with the falklands islands of the uk . 
  they are a self-governing british overseas territory so are not part of the united kingdom in the same way that cornwall is . 
  guadaloupe , la r\u00e9union , martinique and french guiana are as part of france as calvados or champagne ( two departments inside france ) . 
  i knew there was something missing from my post !, 
  i meant european union . 
  thanks for pointing it out ! . 
  tremendous , you could say . 
  facebook/lookback . 
  or something similar . 
  you have to request yourself . 
  it 's instant once requested . 
  / r/footballhighlights may also have somethings to help you !, 
  not always german language highlights for the bundesliga . 
  worth a try though . 
  if that stone has affected one carlisle united , you can bet i would drive up there help the bloke smash it myself !,

  edit : for all you smart-alecs commenting on the queen , if you read the link you will see that it states `` with the exception of the monarch . '', 
  first time i heard it . 
  just gon na say . 
  worked at mcdonalds in nl . 
  was ok . 
  but i knew i would only have to be there 3 months . 
  that helped . 
  i see some cillian murphy in there . 
   soviet bloc residents make amazing lineup waiters . 
  so , you 're saying the brit 's would have been just fine in a soviet state ? 
  the colours were chosen because at least one of those colours appear on every flag in the world . 
  e : word . 
  well , i did n't want to be quite so blunt . 
  but , yes . 
  calm down . 
  just had to google that . 
  that could work too !, 
  pretty prevelant in the uk . 
  you can get the bottles too though . 
  they found an inactive isomer that is not differentiated between methamphetamine . 
  strict liability means he never got his medal back , but he was cleared . 
  if was alain baxter in 2002 . 
  it was harsh , but strict liability . 
  he was cleared in the end but his appeal to get the medal back was unsuccessful . 
  i 'm afraid you 're wrong . 
  they are as much a part of france as hawaii is a part of the usa . 
  [ as you can see here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/overseas_departments_and_territories_of_france ), 
  i am only referring to french guiana , guadeloupe , la r\u00e9union , martinique , and mayotte . 
  these island are part of the eu .

  * mind wanders to laura trott ... *, 
  someone made the point over in / r/rugbyunion that if it was to change ( and i think it should ) there should be a vote and a choice . 
  the three that were suggested at the time were :, 
  jerusalem ;, 
  land of hope and glory ;, 
  i vow to thee , my country . 
  rhode island as well : rood = red in dutch and rhode island is named after the reddish soil that exists there ( i heard this in a pub quiz , so thats my source ),
