  i was going to call bullshit , but i then did some research . 
  while i do n't have a specific amount for nbc , north american broadcasters certainly contributing the majority to the overal kitty ( with broadcasting making up about half ( 47 % ) of the ioc revenue stream ) . 
  [ link , ] ( http://www.olympic.org/documents/ioc_marketing/olympic_marketing_fact_file_2013.pdf ) for those curious ( pdf warning ) page 27 give you the broadcasting the breakdown . 
  i saw de graafschap play jong ajax the other week , the ajax youth team in the second division . 
  the lack of opposition support just made the whole thing feel ... i do n't know how to explain it . . neutered , i guess . 
  the atmosphere was lacking . 
  oh , i know where it is !, 
  used to cycled past it every day going from my faculty to the library !, 
  thanks for delivering op . 
  that is cool . 
  in the uk we just gave a hotel suite to yugoslavia for a day so that the baby would retain the rights to the throne ( although , that throne no longer exists , so the child never got to be monarch ) . 
  in the uk we get a christmas tree from norway every year for the same reason . 
  although , they did stop for a bit because of acid rain . 
  although it ca n't happen now , [ real madrid castilla once played in the cup winners cup against west ham ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/real_madrid_castilla ), 
  do n't . 
  it 's too soon . 
  and it was last week , officially . 
  edit : should also mention after coming straight back up , we then got promoted the following season . 
  so we 're still in the football league !, 
  yay !, 
  on the plus side , the guy who bought gretna wanted to buy carlisle but the board did n't want to sell . 
  dodged a bullet there . 
  but relegation in 1999 could have been terminal for the club . 
  i 'm going to guess op is referring to when he went back to argentina and refused to come back and was then transferred . 
  he 's just donated his boots to the national football museum in manchester !, 
  yeah , that 's what i thought . 
  that goal saved the club . 
  after explaining to my man utd friend , he agrees that jimmy glass scored the most important goal in may 1999 . 
  [ the club folded ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gretna_f.c.#demise ) in 2008 . 
  a successor club was founded in its stead . 
  while the good times would have been great , i am glad we avoided that crash . 
  i find it interesting that the french call the second world war * la seconde guerre mondiale * . 
  you can call it * la dieuxi\u00e8me * and be totally correct but in that implies that there could be a third , fourth , etc. 
  * seconde * in french implies it is definitive and there will no successor . 
  i dunno , seems kind of crass . 
  get that out of here !, 
  the clarinet is superior !!, 
  never heard of this but my google fu tells me kenny deuchar . 
  he plays for arbroath . 
  socrates is also a doctor, 
  someone in another thread called it a post-modern critique of social consumerism . 
  i loved it . 
  ^ ^ the ^ ^ fact ^ ^ that ^ ^ i ^ ^ am ^ ^ half-french ^ ^ has ^ ^ nothing ^ ^ to ^ ^ do ^ ^ with ^ ^ it, 
  sebastian tellier 's song in 2008 was almost entirely in english . 
  bbc one is available in several countries . 
  it is definitely available in ireland and the netherlands ( and maybe belgium , but i 'm not sure ) , although rte and nos also broadcast it . 
  so you could watch it on those , if you wanted to . 
  personally , living in nl i watched it on the bbc . 
  i read that as british hoptimism . 
  what sort of beer you bringing ? 
  better be hoppy !, 
  yes , yes , yes , and yes . 
  can not recommend enough . 
  i wish there was an hungarian one though . 
  edit : although its michel . 
  such as :, 
  [ the edict of expulsion ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/edict_of_expulsion ), 
  [ the highland clearances ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/highland_clearances ), 
  [ the plantation of ulster ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/plantation_of_ulster ), 
  [ the siege of drogheda ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/siege_of_drogheda ) and cromwell in ireland in general . 
  [ one of the first known instances of biological warfare ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/siege_of_fort_pitt ), 
  and by concentration camps i assume you are referring to the [ boer war ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/second_boer_war#concentration_camps_.281900.e2.80.931902.29 ), 
  yeah , we were dicks . 
  and this does n't even begin to cover the half of it !, 
  the british raj being another example . 
  there is still one game left in the season . 
  when i worked in a kitchen the non-smokers would down tools too and `` go for a passive '' . 
  it was open air so you didnt actually get passive smoke . 
  it worked . 
  yup , exactly that . 
  nah they do n't mind . 
  st george 's channel is down at the bottom anyway . 
  equals out . 
  how about the east atlantic islands ? 
  or the north west european isles ? 
   there is no warfare, 
  films set in wartime but depict none of the actual fighting can be brilliant viewing . 
  films such as * la grande illusion * , which is one of my favourites . 
  i am actually going to check this out on your recommendation because i have seen many of such shows from a british angle , but never german , except for a woman in berlin , but that is post war . 
  ah well . 
  my dad stayed at the opus dei student residence in galway . 
  the depiction of them in the da vinci code pissed him off . 
  he said that nothing at all weird every took place . 
  he did n't even have a curfew !, 
  i would get more info for you , but i 'm at work and so is he . 
  he 's on a mission from god to awash man of all sin . 
  ^ ^ ^ by ^ ^ ^ which ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ mean ^ ^ ^ he 's ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ gp, 
  nah , that was because ciss\u00e9 broke his leg in a pre wc friendly . 
  you would have destroyed the ec with him . 
  clearly , the best example is sir alex ferguson . 
  i ca n't think of anyone else . 
  saw that later . 
  i guess 26 years is a age in football . 
  too lazy to change !, 
  his hand was across his chest . 
  that would have been soft . 
  seen them given though, 
  in a 41000 stadium ?!, 
  disgraceful from uefa, 
  like webb in 2010 world cup final .
