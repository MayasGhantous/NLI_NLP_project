  easy to clean when i forget to clean the grounds for a week . 
  a carlisle fan !, 
  in korea !, 
  also scoring in every premiership season until this year . 
  can never be broken . 
  i agree but one of the issues is that the rules have to be the same in the entire competition . 
  they do n't use it in the fa cup because the lines of barrow and fleetwood town etc just could n't afford it . 
  the epl can afford it and that league is separate to the rest of the league structure . 
  you ca n't have glt if not every club in the competition has it . 
  that said it is necessary . 
  edit : since i get a lot of responses to this : i just wrote what i read a while ago . 
  turns out they did use glt in the fa cup when a ground had the capability . 
  they also used it in the fa cup final ( and presumably to semi-finals ) . 
  i agree but that is what uefa say . 
  until they change it that is how it is . 
  good knows trying to get fifa or uefa to adopt logic is nearly impossible !, 
  i had n't seen this even though i read the evening mail every so often . 
  holy cow . 
  great news !, 
  i second suit supply . 
  maybe the maasmechelen outlet centre ? 
  they use it in the epl . 
  [ sir john barrow ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sir_john_barrow,_1st_baronet#career ) apparently suggest st helena . 
  barrow in alaska is named after him . 
  he was second lord of the admiralty , becoming the first permanent secretary for this position ( most senior civil servant position . ), 
  [ they erected a penis in his honour ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hoad_monument ), 
  i drank it for the questions . 
  horse piss has more health benefits . 
  netherlands :, 
  looks both ways crossing what looks like a mini red road ( cycle path ) . 
  if you do not ; you will die . 
  i played this but with cider . 
  edward ciderhands . 
  alternatively , amy winehands . 
  [ father ted crilly ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_father_ted_characters#father_ted_crilly ), 
  [ father dougal mcguire ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_father_ted_characters#father_dougal_mcguire ), 
  [ father jack hackett ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_father_ted_characters#father_jack_hackett ), 
  take your pick !, 
  sir bobby robson - the king maker, 
  carlisle united - dire aliens ' cult, 
  roy hodgson - two in sweden ( although malmo finished top of the regular season 5-times in a row ) and one in denmark with fc copenhagen . 
  you do , but there are only 40 of these in budapest of the c. 500 trams they have . 
  i have never actually seen these trams in the city !, 
  anyway , about 50 % of the trams look like [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tatra_t5c5 ) , although there are also quite a few like [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tw_6000 ) that were bought from hannover . 
  i know amsterdam has some older trams too , and they are definitely louder !, 
  but yeah , i agree . 
  i have just realised this was a really boring post . 
  when i said i knew there were old trams i meant the second image . 
  they operate the tram stop at amsterdam zuid . 
  that must be one of the two lines !, 
  ( tram number 5 , i think ? ) . 
  do n't think i 've ever been on the ones in the first image . 
  closest i 've ever seen a scot get to mvv was jim calderwood, 
  stood there twice . 
  good view . 
  great atmosphere . 
  good price . 
  my mate tackled a guy who feel awkwardly . 
  that was a blood curdling scream : snap his forearm and the bone stuck right out . 
  on the plus side i scored my first ever try in that match . 
  unrelated incidents . 
  edit : sodding autocorrect . 
  double check mightymouse !, 
  i got banned from a friend 's house for redecorating their bathroom that had a cream carpet with vomit . 
  they had to buy a new carpet . 
  yeah and most chip card loading stations only take a pin pas . 
  bloody joke, 
  do n't retire it !, 
  at least i have netflix in nl and i use my proxy to switch to canada/us/uk for greater choice . 
  not a great example , but everything in argentina and nl was all ov . 
  you could switch the language in argentina and both countries have subtitles on offer . 
  nl got netflix last year . 
  october i think . 
  i often use a vpn to switch to the us/uk/canada for greater choice . 
  example : family guy : in nl seasons 1-5 . 
  in us seasons 1-10 . 
  a lot of the shows are up , but not every season yet . 
  but the choice increases every month . 
  yup . 
  i actually use my dad 's account . 
  he is in uk and i am in nl . 
  no problem . 
  anyway , i turn on my vpn . 
  i have the netflix of whichever country i am ` in ' . 
  carlisle united - [ bring me the head of keith mincher ] ( http://www.keithmincher.com/ ), 
  i 've never seen a drive-up atm but my guess would be this :, 
  they probably just use the same keys rather than creating new ones to save costs . 
  what do you think is cheaper ? 
  some braile and some non-braile ; or, 
  all braile ? 
  can i have gold ? 
  at least the carlisle hartlepool derby is back on this year !, 
  i agree , none of them really strike me . 
  i like that croatia have gone back to full chequered though . 
  what annoyed me about it was that they put all the jokes in the trailers . 
  nothing else to laugh at by the time i saw it !, 
  ** golden compass ( northern lights ) **, 
  i would love for them to remake this but without trying to make it like lord of the rings and to really focus on the religious aspects of the book . 
  ah that 's when they just avoided automatic relegation . 
  man , he must be so bummed now .
