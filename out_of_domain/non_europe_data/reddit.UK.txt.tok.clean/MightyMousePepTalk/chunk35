  sounds the same as me : i agree with many of the green policies but nuclear power is a sticking point for . 
  i 'm pro so green do n't get my vote . 
  if they had a less definite opinion on nuclear ( ie they dont have to be so staunchly against it ) i would vote green . 
  email is annoying . 
  my junk mail inbox is full of election emails . 
  i have it on high so some times legit emails end up there . 
  now they are lost among the political ones . 
  quite annoying . 
  i 'm a registered french citizen living in holland . 
  the french do emails . 
  i think about the same . 
  the playoff final is said to be such a big pay day because it comes down to one game . 
  the others got promoted over 46 games so no one big pay off match of winner takes all . 
  cumbria is selected for a new plant which would be a major employer in the region . 
  the greens are big on wind which is also big in cumbria but nuclear would generate more jobs bringing more cash to the county . 
  i also just do n't think going off nuclear child turkey is the right thing to do . 
  it is clean energy ( aware of the waste issue ) so it could contribute to reducing emissions . 
  that 's the tl ; dr. on mobile so too hard to go into more detail . 
  what i mean is that people would work at the plant and spend money locally, 
  next you 'll tell me that i could iron my socks dry . 
  or underwear . 
  that 's just crazy !, 
  i vote for french meps ( long story ) so i 'll have to check . 
  these photos are great . 
  i wish they had more explanation in them though as to where they were taken . 
  i say this because [ this photo ] ( http://life.time.com/history/wwii-before-and-after-d-day-color-photos-from-england-and-france-1944/#10 ) looks so much like my aunt 's house in ste mere eglise . 
  step one : get a place to live :, 
  kamernet.nl is one place to find a room, 
  step two : register with your local gemeente ( council ) . 
  ca n't link you because it depends where you go !, 
  step three : get a bank account ( you will need your bsn ( social security number ) , which you will get when you register with the gemeente . 
  as an eu citizen you do not need to register with immigration ( ind ) . 
  if you stay in nl for longer than 5 years you can apply for permanent residency/dutch citizenship . 
  job agencies such as :, 
  these might hire you if you have some basic dutch . 
  * might * . 
  learn dutch . 
  the more you learn the easier it will be . 
  mcdonalds also might hire . 
  learning dutch : michel thomas method is very good to start . 
  ( you can get in on kick ass torrents ), 
  get an [ ov chipkaart ] ( https://www.ov-chipkaart.nl/?taal=en ) . 
  this will be your ticket to use all public transport ( you have to top it up ) . 
  hup holland hup !, 
  ( football chant ), 
  kruistoch in spijkerbroek - for young adults . 
  its about a kid from modern day amstelveen who ends up going back in time to koln during the [ child crusades ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/children's_crusade ), 
  quite good and not too difficult . 
  i was always more a fan of [ hobart 's funnies ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hobart's_funnies ) myself . 
  but the dd 's are up there . 
  oh definitely . 
  in the end it comes to what do you consider the most important points . 
  top 3 or 5 . 
  and which ones you just ca n't stand . 
  no pirate party candidate for overseas france . 
  wait . 
  hang on . 
  are they called guernseys ? 
  so sport tops are named after channel islands ? 
  how strange !, 
  * see i 'm from a little place call great britain *, 
  * but i dunno if i love or hate britain *, 
  * these words upon my page written *, 
  * are the things that make and break britain *, 
  * one inch to the left , to the left , *, 
  * could have been the difference between life and death , *, 
  * knife wound to the heart to the side of the chest , *, 
  * could of been one statistic less . 
  * see sometimes great britain ai n't that great , *, 
  * kids getting stabbed at an alarming rate , *, 
  * press with a passion to exaggerate *, 
  * increasingly clueless heads of state ? 
  *** you see knife crime knife crime ai n't about knifes , ***, 
  *** it 's about young britain and the ways of lives , ***, 
  *** you do n't solve knife crime by taking knifes to hand , ***, 
  *** you solve it by instilling new hopes and plans , ***, 
  [ * great britain * by dan le sac v scroobious pip ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7la55fh3_jm ), 
  not that quoting song lyrics is the best empirical evidence , but scroobious pip is one of the best rappers out there , in my opinion , especially when it comes to making social comments on inner city youths in england . 
  i personally think that the emboldened part is quite poignant . 
  op meant could n't care less but for some reason could care less has become a common americanism . 
  were n't you a gk away from being same to field an all french side at one point ? 
  you also has some utter sinkers though . 
  veron and forlan aside ( who were n't terrible i grant you , things just did n't work out for them ) , there were several players who came and went quickly and that all adds up . 
  not many clubs could afford to do that . 
  for every schmeichel there was a taibi . 
  better than 50 ? 
  yeah probably . 
  low fees but they all made a loss . 
  milne aside those other 3 made a total loss of 8m once resold . 
  my point is that not many teams could afford to do that . 
  of course man u also did sell others for massive profit so it was offset . 
  but again not many other clubs could do that . 
  not my point . 
  not many clubs can to through the initial outlay on players and how they come off . 
  saf bought 104 players in his 23 years . 
  he had plenty of money to spend . 
  not oil money but still big bucks . 
  i went to bed , but i just wanted to clarify some things :, 
   nobody is denying he had money to spend . 
  ~ ~ unless i misunderstood your initial point , you did .
