  both are first class so you are both right !, 
  there is no outbreak of war . 
  only outbreaks of peace, 
  it 's like berwick upon tweed was at war with russia for 100 years until 1966 . 
  ca n't remember the particulars ( on mobile ) but it was basically because someone forgot . 
  also berwick is an odd entity, 
  ra\u00efs, 
  they also boost your park rating no end . 
  you 're both right because the original point was ambiguous as to what it meant imo . 
  i am willing to make this sacrifice .

  this is why i love my new office that my company just moved into : canteen and the bowl of salad is $ 1.55 !, 
  it 's also a self serve salad bar .

  turns out , my comment is apocryphal . 
  as berwick-upon-tweed had been passed between england and scotland a few times there are instances where it is specifically mentioned in documents e.g. 
  `` england , wales , and berwick-upon-tweed ... '', 
  the story is that something similar was written in the declaration of war for the crimean war , but in the peace treaty berwick was missed out . 
  turns out this is n't true . 
  ah well . 
  just some practical advise for arnhem :, 
  getting to the cemetary you have two options :, 
  train to oosterbeek and it 's a short walk , or, 
  hop on the number 1 bus to oosterbeek and go to the airbourne museum in oosterbeek , then walk over to the cemetary ( about 15-20 minute walk ) . 
  either way oosterbeek is small so its easily done . 
  just wondering though , could you no wait a few weeks and come during the airbourne weekend ?

  [ abortion is legal in england , scotland , and wales .

  i dunno , it 's kind of burren ... 
  in fairness , ni is part of the uk and the abortion law in ni is different ( and much stricter ) than in the rest of the uk .

  an owner can only have one team in a competition . 
  it is rumoured that chelsea made vitesse not qualify for the cl so that chelsea could . 
  the old chairman made a comment . 
  the knvb looked into it , but i have heard nothing else . 
  i would link but i have a meeting !, 
  edit : [ link explaining knvb investigation into vitesse ownership structure ] ( http://www.insideworldfootball.com/world-football/europe/14401-vitesse-links-to-chelsea-come-under-knvb-scrutiny ), 
  [ link explaining chelsea supposedly stopping vitesse qualifying for champions league ] ( http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2014349-chelsea-investigated-over-claims-they-stopped-vitesse-reaching-champions-league ), 
  also , why have i been downvoted for this ? 
  i did n't say chelsea did do it , just that it was rumoured because merab jordania , for chairman of vitesse , claimed it . 
  chelsea probably did n't do anything of the sort . 
  i was simply giving op an explanation . 
  was n't so that they would n't meet each other , it was because uefa do n't allow clubs with the same owner to be in the same competition . 
  so vitesse could be in europa league and chelsea in champions league , but if chelsea got knocked into the europa with vitesse still in it ... well that would be very interesting to see the developments !, 
  that is , of course , if it could be proved that roman owned both clubs . 
  i really do n't think any of these are that nice . 
  red ones are the best but even then they are not great . 
  sure they will look better on actual players though .
