  it 's good . 
  this is too stupid . 
  i love it, 
  a reflex that closes the throat to prevent water entering ? 
  an important difference is that the ww1 armistice was signed by german politicians , not by the army . 
  the german army felt betrayed ( look up the november criminals . 
  that 's what the german army called the politicians ) . 
  the generals felt that germany could have continued fighting ( regardless if that was true or not ) . 
  in ww2 the assumed german supreme commander admiral doenitz ( chosen by hitler ) ordered the surrender . 
  will it happen to us ? 
  can it ? 
  no :( sorry i just do n't think it will happen in the next ... 30 years . 
  and i 'm just talking about making the championship . 
  i loved that stuff . 
  i saw something ( ages ago now ) that coca cola used some pretty under hand tactics to undermine it from supermarkets etc. 
  virgin found out years later and could have sued . 
  far too late though . 
  it was always more popular in blind tastes though . 
  ( again , only apparently . 
  no empirical evidence here . 
  just something i saw once on tv . ), 
  edit a word, 
  haha thanks . 
  have all , scored a goal ? 
  it 's called the 1812 overture , actually ... 
  kit latura more like http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116040/, 
  i know . 
  it was a joke . 
  but i appreciate the sentiment nonetheless . 
  just my opinion but i think the french classes ( or any language class ) is good to spark an interest in french and france . 
  of course it wo n't work for everyone . 
  it could even develop an interest in other languages : `` man this french sucks . 
  russian would be so much cooler . 
  i 'm just going to learn that . '', 
  but without the french classes , how would you know if you hate it or not ? 
  i am aware a lot depends on the teacher . 
  i loved german in school . 
  yet here i am with a ba in french !, 
  `` the washing machine broke so i called a man . 
  he will be here tomorrow to fix it . '', 
  `` oh great . 
  thanks honey . '', 
  * wife goes to garage *, 
  `` honey , why does the washing machine look like it has been attacked by a hammer ?! '', 
  - outnumbered , bbc, 
  this might not be the most popular option in the subreddit but you can get a great pair of leather waterproof hiking boots for 150-200 $ . 
  they will have no problem with the snow and leather ones can look very smart . 
  i love michel thomas courses . 
  i 've been using his spanish one . 
  he does the french one himself too . 
  they are really good, 
  well `` good-looking '' is very subjective , obviously . 
  but , personally , i think these [ scarpa 's look quite smart . 
  a classic-looking walking boot . 
  full grain leather , gore-tex \\ ( so waterproof and breathable \\ ) , and vibram soles ( good soles , vibrams . 
  and you can replace them ) ] ( http://www.cotswoldoutdoor.com/scarpa-mens-ranger-2-gtx-activ-boot-32110376?id_colour=143 ), 
  a cheaper option would be [ these berghaus ] ( http://www.cotswoldoutdoor.com/berghaus-mens-explorer-ridge-gtx-boot-32110055?id_colour=143 ) again , quite a classic looking boot , in my opinion . 
  not vibram-soled but it does have full-grain leather and gore-tex . 
  pair of thick socks with either of these and you 'll be grand . 
  an alternative is [ walking shoes ] ( http://www.cotswoldoutdoor.com/index.cfm/fuseaction/products.list?query=fh_location%3d%2f%2fcatalog01%2fen_gb%2fcategories%3c%7bcatalog01_c2%7d%2fcategories%3c%7bcatalog01_c2_c27%7d%2fcategories%3c%7bcatalog01_c2_c27_c149%7d%26fh_refview%3dsummary%26fh_eds%3d%c3%9f%26store-region%3duk%26subsite%3d%26devicetype%3ddesktop%26fh_view_size%3d22 ) , but i do n't think any of these look good . 
  while a pair of red wings would handle the ice , and with a pair of thick socks keep you warm , they are going to get pretty ruined in the polish snows , especially once that stuff starts to turn to slush . 
  watch * zwarte boek * ( black book ) , too . 
  it 's in dutch , but it is arguably one of the best dutch movies . 
  also , it has carice van houten in it ( lady melissandra from got ) . 
  duolingo has just started dutch in beta . 
  michel thomas ' dutch course is great for sentence structure , vocab , and pronunciation . 
  [ micro brewery with a happy hour and amazing tarte flamb\u00e9es ? 
  you are welcome . 
  i think i put on 10kilos from this place alone . 
  oh yeah ... i see that now !, 
  they have vegetarian tarte flamb\u00e9es !, 
  probably . 
  quite so . 
  it is frustrating at times . 
  i think michel thomas is a better basis as he build up your knowledge so simply . 
  personally , i started with hugo : dutch in three months . 
  it was good but a bit old fashioned : it taught me how to say ` how do you do ? ', 
  it 's fine for pronunciation . 
  better than duo lingo . 
  tells you how to do it . 
  if course the ` g ' can be difficult to begin with . 
  i would say the reason someone says it 's bad for pronunciation is because you have no direct feedback on how you are saying things . 
  it is however a dutch woman teaching you , which is better than duolingo . 
  duolingo is awful for pronunciation . 
  i did the spanish on it , then did michel thomas . 
  that 's when i found out i said everything wrong . 
  my stress was well off !, 
  not saying duolingo is awful overall or michel is perfect . 
  but use them both together and anyone should go far !, 
  what i like about the hemingway one is that i once interned at an embassy . 
  i was taught to use never redundant words . 
  so i would n't say '' i met with mr x '' because the met implies i met with someone so i would say `` i met mr x '', 
  more to the point , however , i was told not to bother with big words because `` everyone knows you 're clever , you do n't need to prove it . '', 
  this applied to everyone , was n't just directed at me . 
  reminds of this irish ad https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=al6ha-fvobw, 
  `` how did you lose your arm ? '', 
  `` let 's just say when the teacher tells you put your arm back in the bus , you do it . '', 
  '' he was dead before i shot him '' - * yates is dead *, 
  '' he was dead before i shot him '' - * yates is dead *, 
  i 've used dutch netflix since it first arrived .
