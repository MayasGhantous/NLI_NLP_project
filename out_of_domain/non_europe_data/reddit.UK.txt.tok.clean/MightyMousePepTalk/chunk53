  but in general terms it is fairly generic , yeah . 
  still , i was drunk and had no beer glasses at home !, 
  it also had a widget, 
  i think you 're right . 
  i do n't think there are many cities left that could host , but spread around a region/country could work . 
  the new england olympics . 
  share the cost and the benefits !, 
  less pressure on one airport too . 
  for me trying to run in a dream is like trying to run in gta iii when he 's exhausted so you start jumping because you think it 's faster only the whole game is treacle . 
  i kicked it back once ... and slipped and landed on my arse . 
  check out michel thomas french . 
  really good for helping with pronunciation and the language in general . 
  does your sos family give you stick ? 
  my mum was french but i learnt my french in university ( good reasons for this , unrelated . ), 
  my french family love how much better my french has gotten and they have never mocked my french . 
  they 'll correct me and help me if i make a mistake , but most of the time they let little things slide , like when a french person says `` make a photo '' we let it slide . 
  my so is hungarian . 
  i 've tried learning it but bugger me is that hard . 
  [ the vasa ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/15/the_vasa_from_the_bow.jpg ) , a swedish ship that sank pretty shortly after it was launched , was lifted in the pictured condition from the bottom of the baltic sea 333 years later . 
  but the baltic sea has one benefit for the ship : [ it is less salty than other seas ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baltic_sea#salinity ) . 
  iirc , this mean a certain bacteria that would usually decompose the ship , was much much slower in doing so . 
  not really sure of my point . 
  i guess i am agreeing and saying that sometimes you get lucky !, 
  indeed the two are vastly differently . 
  i have no idea if that aircraft could be lifted . 
  but to speak of the vasa . 
  i never said it was in good shape . 
  if you compare it to how it looked , it was in very poor shape indeed . 
  it was , however , in relatively excellent shape for a wooden vessel that spent 333 years submerged . 
  compare it to an older wreck , the mary rose and it looks much better . 
  the ships of a similar age that sank in the caribbean have also decomposed to only the cannon that were onboard !, 
  in british . 
  i dumped sugar in my tea . 
  now i do n't . 
  now i 'm civilised . 
  now it 's a drop of milk and no sugar in my yorkshire gold, 
  i use to reach around to wipe . 
  but one day , for whatever reason , i went frontal . 
  never looked back . 
  now when i wipe it 's always :, 
  - lift ballsack, 
  - wipe, 
  - inspect . 
  - repeat as necessary . 
  edit : why do i do this ? 
  - less chance of smearing shit over my arse . 
  i do n't get it on my ball sack as that is lifted . 
  i trim my pubes because i 'm civilised dammit !, 
  - less chance of accidental shit hand . 
  - easier to inspect the wipage . 
  fyi i 'm not skinny . 
  98kg and 1m95 . 
  that 's why i lift the ball sack and trim my pubes !, 
  got ta have trimmed pubes . 
  is just civilised . 
  you must be hopelessly weak if you ca n't lift up a dick . 
  then i apologise for the misunderstanding !, 
  it just works for me . 
  except in those odd curricular toilets . 
  inspection and repeat . 
  inspection and repeat, 
  they called it sunday http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/news/rosie-swims-to-sanctuary-with-calf-she-fought-so-hard-to-save-30638774.html, 
  argentina believes the people there are there illegally having displaced an indigenous population . 
  they do n't believe a referendum can solve the issue because they care about the land , not which country the people want to belong to . 
  subtle difference . 
  having been to argentina , no one really gave a crap about the islands, 
   pumped, 
  thing is , when i visited auschwitz , we were told that zyklon b was in the form of tablets and they opened up hatches in the roof , poured in the tablets and closed them up again . 
  the collective heat of all the bodies in the chamber activated the gas from the tablets . 
  so it was was n't like turning on the gas on your hob . 
  * the boy in the striped pyjamas * shows the action of pouring the tablets in from the roof . 
  we tried to sign to him this summer . 
  he said no . 
  i know of a film called [ crust ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0271445/ ) that is about a giant shrimp that is taught to box . 
  it was never released as it was only to dodge tax apparently . 
  [ there is a trailer of it online ] ( http://vimeo.com/18629466 ), 
  pretty much anything by [ fc stjarnan in iceland ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0gbyfj-zmq ), 
  bang in the centre , near the cathedral . 
  free entry .

  edit : linked because i 'm nice . 
  ha , yeah . 
  i went to norway recently and upon arrival i thought `` better get some cash out '' as my previous trip had been to a country where cash was king . 
  anyhoo about two minutes after taking out the cash i discovered you can use your card pretty much everywhere in norway !, 
  plus , ode to joy is the anthem of europe . 
  so as long as there is an eu in the future ... 
   if your british , you 're fucked . 
   if the uk did negotiate like france, 
  i knew there was a good reason for me to apply for a french passport and not a british one !, 
  i used to live very close to [ terryland park ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eamonn_deacy_park ) although i see looking it up that it has been renamed eamonn deacy park . 
  it was home to galway united , but they have since gone bust . 
  now called galway f.c. 
  anyway , to answer your question , i ca n't say i noticed much when there was a match on . 
  well , i know the irish president , michael d higgins , was the honorary president of galway united and is also the honorary president of galway fc so it is essentially the same club . 
  i would say the fans have been retained . 
  actually , if anything the number of supporters has increased because the new club represents the entire county of galway as it merged galway united , mervue united , and salthill devon . 
  a good move in my mind . 
  i would say that because the club was small it certainly affected my life a lot less . 
  galway gaelic football matches disrupted the city more , but i did n't live close to that stadium .
