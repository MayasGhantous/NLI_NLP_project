  but i 'm not linking that . 
  my dad lived in berlin in the 70s and in 2006 we went there on holiday . 
  he had never been back but he had told us stories . 
  we met up with one of his old friends and she took us to the brandenburg gate . 
  my dad started crying . 
  he is n't german but the fact he could walk through no problem just hit him . 
  21 for england should have buried the rebound to make sure . 
  i assume you mean individually , because you had euro 2000 . 
  but i remember the dutch fa just hearing the fifa requirements and thinking : `` you want us to give a priority lane on dutch roads ? 
  are you insane ? 
  how about , no . '', 
  along with other things . 
  nah , on ** your ** birthday , ** you ** have to bring cake into the office . 
  or bring whatever you want . 
  does n't have to be cake !, 
  personally , i make my own cake because i find the shop bought cake in nl horrid . 
  personal favourites :, 
  - p\u00e9p\u00e9 le moko ( 1937 ) - gangster from paris hides in the casbah of algiers,

  both star and are directed by french comedian dany boon, 
  edit : for something that would be easy to analyse from my list i would go for :, 
  la grand illusion, 
  also , just to add that i like other films listed by others , but i did n't want to repeat them !, 
  tie break ? 
  have you noticed how self baked here often means `` i made it from a box ? '', 
  i guess because when you make it yourself , you care as to how others will judge it ? 
  it reflects you in a way . 
  there is an awesome looking patisserie near me with the best window displays . 
  i bet they do good cakes . 
  but i still rather make my own !, 
  edit : i got on a bus and pressed send too early . 
  but his initial penalty was poor : perfect height for a gk and no where near the corner !, 
  edit : the flying kicked reminded me of a story, 
  when i was a school we were playing a team that scored even though the ball had gone out of play . 
  the ref , our teacher , let it stand . 
  i was angry and it totally ruined my composure for the rest of the game . 
  anyway , we were 4-0 down and suddenly it 's one on one and i 'm the goalie . 
  i rushed forward to throw myself on the ball . 
  somewhat hot headed , i admit . 
  i 'm in no.man 's land and he lobs me . 
  wait ... no . 
  that 's a slow moving ball . 
  i leg it back to my goal line from the edge of the area , dive , and punch the ball clear off the line for a throw-in . 
  i played shit that game , but at least i did that !, 
  well according to dante the innermost circle of hell contains a frozen lake , so ... 
  i did that in primary school . 
  all the boys did . 
  i think our mothers had a pact to not let any boy wear trousers because we always came home with filthy knees from playing football at break time . 
  so call it the wfa world cup . 
  ( world football associations ) . 
  failing that , world championship . 
  is that the european country only rich people have heard of ? 
  purists will say it 's a crappy mass produced german pils . 
  i think it 's a nice crisp refreshing pilsner . 
  exactly what you want at a match . 
  barrow afc has a nuclear submarine on their crest , as that is where the royal navy build their nuclear submarines . 
  but that is n't what is weird . 
  there is also a bee being skewered by an arrow . 
  it represents the town 's name : bee-arrow . 
  i 'm on t mobile and in arnhem . 
  had a 4g phone since march but arnhem only got 4g with t-mobile like two to three weeks ago !, 
  personally , there is a big difference in speed . 
  my 3g was shit . 
  google nexus 5 is my phone . 
  i was hosting a pub quiz at the back of the student union bar and when it finished i went to the front and bumped into a friend . 
  she invited me over to drink with her group . 
  in said group was a dutch fella . 
  i use my then limited dutch to say hello and he was a bit impressed : not many dutch speakers at that uni !, 
  anyway it turns out he is from the same town as where my so lives , so we have a good chat . 
  everyone then says that we are going to a house party . 
  me and the dutchie keep , chatting and i spend the evening mine sweeping drinks for him and me . 
  that was 4 years ago and it 's still a beautiful bromance and we only live 20 minutes apart in nl . 
  that gif is amazing . 
  `` i 'm fine ! '', 
  scott carson is a saint !, 
  i may be slightly biased . 
  i thought they changed that at the start of this year . 
  the same thirteen people voted in each round . 
  however , in the first round the votes were weighted by points . 
  the thirteen voters ranked the bids 1-3 .
