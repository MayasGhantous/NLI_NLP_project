  `` curse you from nl !!! '', 
  is what i imagine that kid who turned 16 in january this year would say . 
  you also have haggis , which i believe is illegal in the us ( because it contains animal lungs ), 
   best dairy products in the world, 
  the dutch and the fine folk of jersey , guernsey , and normandy may take issue with that . 
  but irish dairy products are brilliant . 
  no denying it . 
  edit : added guernsey . 
  please do n't hate me . 
  [ as fair as i am aware , yes . 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-28070716 ), 
   so much sneaking around , distrust of cops in case they `` bust '' you , fake identification cards , experimenting amongst themselves , not letting any parents know , and so on . 
  that 's pretty much what we did when i grew up in england . 
  difference was you also knew the bars that would serve you without id even though you were 16-17 . 
  nowadays , you would never get served at that age since everything is `` think 25 '' and the punishment is too great for bars . 
  the law does n't really say :, 
  `` a goalkeeper is not permitted to keep control of the ball in his hands for more, 
  than six seconds . 
  a goalkeeper is considered to be in control of the ball :, 
  \u2022 while the ball is between his hands or between his hand and any surface, 
  ( e.g. 
  ground , own body ), 
  \u2022 while holding the ball in his outstretched open hand, 
  \u2022 while in the act of bouncing it on the ground or tossing it into the air, 
  when a goalkeeper has gained possession of the ball with his hands , he can not, 
  be challenged by an opponent . '', 
  [ page 120 , the laws of the game ( pdf ) ] ( http://www.fifa.com/mm/document/footballdevelopment/refereeing/81/42/36/log2013en_neutral.pdf ), 
  so , arguably you could say that he is in control here , because he does get appear to get both hands on it , however briefly . 
  the bullet points do n't clarify if it is when the keeper is in clear control of the ball so it 's open to interpretation in my view . 
  i set up pin-sparen recently ( every time i pin a percentage of it goes into my savings account . 
  why am i explaining this to a dutchman ? 
  anyway ) , and for doing so abn-amro gave me some free portable speakers !, 
  the speakers suck . 
  the latter !, 
  the former would be very odd . 
  haha , yeah i assumed you would . 
  i felt daft for explaining . 
  too lazy to hit delete though !, 
  aaaand now i miss galway more . 
  great pics . 
  gives the city a victorian feel . 
  i live in la for lancashire . 
  i am from cumbria . 
  not with an la postcode . 
  but cumbrian in general , yes . 
  aaaand now i find her attractive . 
  damn you reddy mcredcap !, 
  i like bad santa secrets, 
  it was also known as the french disease in german , hence why * petite-france * in strasbourg is so-called : it contained a hospice for those with syphilis . 
  ca n't comment on that because i have no idea about baseball major or minor . 
  however , people go watch for a variety of reasons :, 
  - cheaper tickets, 
  - support local, 
  - generally friendly crowds . 
  the closest club to me by a significant distance is barrow afc who play in conference north . 
  serious stuff . 
  of course the quality is n't as good . 
  but you accept that . 
  it 's also part of it 's lure . 
  i lied . 
  the closest club to me plays in the 12th tier . 
  i have my limits . 
  i only go watch them because my mate plays . 
  it was n't amsterdam but a train from amsterdam . 
  man walked up to me and my three mates `` want to buy coke ? '', 
  i politely declined . 
  you get s holiday for lizzie 's birthday ?!, 
  we do n't in the uk !, 
  you just described my first away day : it was cold and wet , and we lost 6-1 . 
  then we were escorted back to the station by the police . 
  interesting !, 
  the guy who makes these is norwegian so that makes sense !, 
  look , i 'm sorry . 
  i just could n't face another season in divison one so , yes , i restarted the game until i beat you in the playoff final . 
  if it makes you feel better i only won one game that season in the premier league . 
  ah , championship manager 96/97 . 
  one of the romanian players , alfred eisenbeisser feraru , got pneumonia and got off the ship in italy on the way home . 
  somehow , his mother thought he had died and held a funeral for him , which he ended up walking in on .

  penultimate paragraph ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/may/13/world-cup-stunning-moments-25-conte-verde-uruguay ), 
  criteria to be nominated :, 
  - it should be a beautiful goal ( subjective -- the spread of goals should include long-range shots , team goals , overhead kicks , individual plays , etc. ) . 
  - the importance of the match should be taken into account ( objective -- limited to `` a '' international teams , confederation championships and national top-division club matches : the more important the goal , the better ) . 
  - the goal should not be the result of luck , mistakes or a deflection by a teammate or the other team . 
  - the goal should support fair play , i.e. 
  the player should not have behaved badly in the game or have been charged with doping , for example . 
  in pennsylvania , right ? 
  someone told me that the carlsberg brewery used to offer all you could drink but once you left , you could n't get back in . 
  the toilets were outside . 
  they countered by pissing in empty 2 litre bottles under the table . 
  no one else i have ever spoken to has confirmed this . 
  what was his name ? 
  down votes for being wrong : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/natural-born-citizen_clause, 
  you have to be a natural born us citizen . 
  this can mean being born abroad to us parents .
