  as for carlisle well , we have been in more football league trophy finals than anyone else ( 6 ) and won the first ever one in 1997 . 
  we 've only won it twice mind . 
  brunton park is the largest football stadium in england that is not all-seated . 
  before my time , but we once sat atop of the football pyramid after winning the first three games of the ' 74 - '75 season . 
  and potato and meat , too !, 
  i have edited my post to include your other pie victories . 
  sorry about that . 
  might have to pay a visit to morecambe this christmas : i 'm only across the sands !, 
  '' ** look deep into the parka ** '', 
  `` what ? '', 
  '' ** look deep into the parka . 
  there are many things in here , things you could never dream of . 
  `` like what ? '', 
  `` i 've dreamt of rubies . '', 
  `` i 'm not interested in your stupid dreams . '', 
  * flash of like emits from the parka *, 
  '' . . the eeeegg ! ... '', 
  e : dammit ipad . 
  you reminded me of this story : http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6254282.stm, 
  in 1990 the hungarian government fixed the price of heating oil to one-fifth the price of diesel . 
  heating oil was just red diesel . 
  people soon figured out and initially would fill up canisters , drive down the road and fill up the car . 
  when they realised the police gave no shits , the filled up from the pump . 
  it was the so-called ` oilgate ' . 
  also involved were the mafia . 
  quite interesting . 
  personally , i use tunnelbear . 
  there are others out there , but i like how simple tunnelbear is . 
  yes , i pay 50 $ a year for unlimited data . 
  could i pay nothing ? 
  easily with someone else . 
  but tunnelbear lets me use it on 2 devices and my laptop . 
  i travel a lot to countries with no netflix so to be able to use it on my ipad is great !, 
  also , it makes your browsing private . 
  i recommend . 
  i do n't know of one as good as tunnelbear . 
  but if anyone can recommend another one to me that i can use on an ipad i am all ears !, 
  edit : also 50 $ isnt so much as i am in the eurozone, 
  ok that sucks . 
  but happy birthday !, 
  and here 's to a much better christmas !, 
   `` bridge-day-off '', 
  i have no idea how to translate that . 
  i know what you mean though . 
  the french say `` faire le pont '' * lit . 
  * make the bridge . 
  so , i just use that most of the time !, 
  slightly related : the lonely planet released their book `` top places to visit in 2015 '' and one of the places was el chalten !, 
  so you may get more tourists next year !, 
  i went to argentina in march this year . 
  i love your country . 
  it 's incredible , as the people . 
  and your steaks changed my life . 
  history ( since i have a degree in it ) , but no real time period . 
  my interest in periods waxes and wanes . 
  related to history : ** etymology ** , i love learning how words came to be . 
  i sleep terribly . 
  my so gets up slightly before but constantly snoozes her alarm ( about three times before she gets up ) . 
  i just read your other post and would you say that the thing to do would be to get up when her first alarm goes off , thus setting a regular waking time ? 
  i do n't much fancy getting up at 6h30 on a weekend , but if it helps me sleep better !, 
  their wine is fine too . 
  when they have their french week i usually stock up on a couple of well priced bordeauxs and crements that would certainly be more expensive in booths or tesco . 
  or in my case , albert heijn . 
  but the point still remains . 
  it 's about testing it out for yourself . 
  example . 
  use lidl laundry powder . 
  just as good as ariel ? 
  keep it . 
  find its not as good ? 
  ok stick with ariel . 
  i buy a lot of their toiletries . 
  i do n't know . 
  park bench ? 
  [ pay and sit . 
  ] ( http://breakingdownthnews.blogspot.nl/2014/06/pay-and-sit-park-benches-homeless-spikes.html ), 
  [ guardian article for context ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/jun/12/anti-homeless-spikes-latest-defensive-urban-architecture ), 
  that website really needs to proof read !, 
  read some other articles and it said newton published his book pincipia in ** 19 ** 87 !, 
  anyway , cool pictures . 
  what ? 
  you do n't trust a party that is the minor party in a coalition government with a slim majority because they could n't fulfil a pledge ? 
  seems daft to me . 
  not that i voted lib dem , but i think that is unfair . 
  vote for whoever you want based on their next manifesto and what you think is right for you . 
  not for what happened five years ago . 
  what do you call a med student who graduates bottom of his class ? 
  a doctor . 
  good luck !, 
  you can do it !, 
  my bro worked his butt off and got real stressed . 
  he is now a qualified doctor in two countries and loves it !, 
  champions league though . 
  arguably could 've won another one with vds . 
  saf said he always felt he could have won another in that time and he regretted not signing vds from juventus . 
  but hindsight is 20/20 and all that . 
  you 're right about their domestic success though . 
  watching skyfall right now . 
  silva just that the line . 
  they got into my library .
