  ' i can see , boss . '', 
  the telescoped focused in more . 
  an object came into view . 
  the image became sharper . 
  ` is that ... ? 
  that makes no sense . 
  is it ? 
  kid , what is that ? ', 
  ` boss , it looks like a traffic cone . ', 
  jenkins fell off his chair . 
  the famous barrow and blackburn manager . 
  legend !, 
  i experienced an annoying form of ageism once . 
  i had just picked up my bike from the repair shop and was cycling it through my town . 
  i saw the cars up ahead had stopped at the zebra crossing . 
  so , i slowed right down and looked at my back wheel to see if it was still buckled . 
  i was probably doing about 5mph and i totally misjudged the cars moving so i ended up bumping into the back of the car in front . 
  totally my fault . 
  looked at the bumper , not a scratch , thankfully . 
  i went round to the driver saying `` really sorry !, 
  no damage though . '', 
  the guy totally flipped . 
  `` i 'll be the judge of that ! '', 
  he yelled in my face as he stormed round the back of his car to inspect it . 
  he sees no damage but then yells some more in my face `` if you were n't on so many drugs , you kids might be able to see where you are going ! '', 
  really ? 
  just because i was 18 ( at the time ) that i must instantly be on drugs ? 
  some ageism right there . 
  i was too dumbfounded and angry to say anything witty in return . 
  so , i cycled off , slowly , in front of him , through the one-way system of my town . 
  he continued to hurl abuse at me , but i took solace in the fact that i was pissing him off . 
  i wonder his wife , sitting in the car , thought of the whole thing . 
  they could speak in latin ( probably ), 
  i can assure you that [ this pizza hut ] ( http://statics.192.com/estreet/original/large/2122/21220754.jpg ) is not thought of as ` high-end ' . 
  ( barrow-in-furness , uk ), 
  i would say in the uk in general it 's considered a fast-food restaurant , but a step-up from mcdonalds , but a step-down from all the chain italian restaurants we have . 
  just my take though . 
  do n't know about other countries , although i went to one in belgium once a long time ago . 
  i was trying to think what the thoughts on pizza hut are in the netherlands where i live and i have no idea !, 
  i do n't think i 've even seen one , but i 'm sure the exist !, 
  i still use my first email address and it has 2k in the address because i made it in ... 2000 !, 
  i was 12 . 
  it 's my `` i do n't care if this gets filled with spam , but i still have a junk mail filter '' email . 
  i think what i 'm saying is , i agree with you . 
  french author philippe delerm ( * la premi\u00e8re gorg\u00e9e de bi\u00e8re et autres plaisirs minuscules * ) has summed up why i will have a beer , although this translation takes away some of the charm . 
  no other work has ever captured the essence as to the amazingness that is that first sip of beer :, 
  `` the first sip !, 
  its journey is already well advanced by the time it reaches your throat . 
  with a frothy trail of framing gold around your lips , bitter happiness slowly permeates your palate . 
  it seems to last a small eternity , that first sip . 
  you drink without hesitation , gulled by your own instinct . 
  the ritual is familiar enough : the right quantity to ensure a perfect prelude ; the instant rush of wellbeing , punctuated by a contented sigh , a smack of the lips , or silence ; the giddy sensation of pleasure teetering on the brink of infinity ... 
  yet you know that the best is already over . 
  you put your glass down on the beer mat and push both slightly away . 
  time to relish the colour - ersatz honey , cold sun . 
  if only you were patient and wise enough to grasp the miracle behind the disappearing act . 
  you notice with satisfaction that the brewer 's name on the glass corresponds with the beer you ordered . 
  but whatever the relation of the vessel to its contents , nothing can bridge the gap between them , or conjure liquid out of thin air . 
  what would n't you give to capture and encode the secret of pure gold ? 
  instead , you sit at your table , like a frustrated alchemist intent on keeping up appearances - each mouthful is a falling away from pleasure . 
  happiness has a bitter taste when you have to drink in order to forget the first sip . 
  `` sit here and do n't touch anything , got it ? '', 
  he said . 
  `` got it . '', 
  i said . 
  `` good . 
  nothing . 
  not a thing . 
  except the chair , obviously . '', 
  he said . 
  `` obviously . '', 
  i said . 
  '' * especially * not the big red button . 
  never touch that . '', 
  `` you hear me ? 
  do not touch it . 
  not now . 
  not ever . '', 
  `` right . '', 
  `` i ca n't even begin to tell you what would happen if you so much as touched it . '', 
  `` the consquences would be * catastrophic * . 
  you do n't want that , do you ? '', 
  `` nope . '', 
  `` good . 
  then do n't touch it . '', 
  `` because it you do ... '', 
  '' ... blamo . '', 
  `` blamo . 
  exactly . 
  not good . 
  look , just do n't even think about the red button . 
  forget i mentioned it . '', 
  `` will do . '', 
  `` just act like it 's not there . 
  no red button . 
  then you wo n't touch it . '', 
  `` smart . '', 
  `` good . 
  ca n't have you touching that red button . 
  that big .
