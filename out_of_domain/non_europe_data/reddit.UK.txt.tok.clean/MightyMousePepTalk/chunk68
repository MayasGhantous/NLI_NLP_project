  just sitting there with those big white words saying ` do not press . ', 
  ca n't be having that . '', 
  `` no siree . '', 
  i 'm stepping out now . 
  when i come back . 
  you better not have pressed it ! '', 
  `` see you . '', 
  the most westerly , easterly , and southerly country in the european union is france . 
  and the most northerly is ... finland . 
  and `` jemig de pemig '' which i think , but please correct me as i am not native dutch , `` goodness gracious . '', 
  read it in the dutch harry potter . 
  must be real, 
  norway is not in the eu, 
  la r\u00e9union is an integral part of france and is in the indian ocean . 
  as an integral part of france it is in the eu . 
  the same applies to the caribbean island of saint martin . 
  do you ? 
  do you know anything about france ? 
  la r\u00e9union is an integral part of france and is in the indian ocean . 
  as an integral part of france it is in the eu . 
  the same applies to the caribbean island of saint martin . 
  maybe use google before trying to be clever and failing, 
  those are not an integral part of the uk so they are not in the eu so that argument would n't work . 
  just read this http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/extreme_points_of_the_european_union#including_overseas_territories, 
  this just reminded me of a guy at my uni . 
  start of the year he bought a tonne of oats and decided that it would be his food for the semester so he could spend his money elsewhere ( i.e. 
  the pub ) . 
  he ended up in hospital with malnutrition . 
  had a rugby dinner once and the speaker was a former ref who was one of the first to ref a game with a mic . 
  he warned the players of the mic and to watch their language . 
  match goes well . 
  towards the end of the game one team ( i think it was oz v nz but i ca n't be sure ) runs over the try line , but instead of scoring he does a bit of showboating first . 
  the ref said `` stop pissing about and put the fucking ball down '', 
  regardless of if it was true , was a great story so i want to believe . 
  fruit . 
  the colour is oranje . 
  ca n't speak for the us but at the mcdonald 's i worked at in netherlands we got a 50 % discount when we working . 
  i brought my own sandwiches . 
  edit : i 'll add that i was on minimum wage and this was back in 2008 so i do n't remember exactly but i think i was on around 8 $ an hour . 
  the dutch minimum wage changes depending on your age . 
  from 15 to 22 there is a different wage every year . 
  23 and older is the same . 
  however , this being reddit , i am happy to be corrected by someone if i am mistaken . 
  why is it called new south wales ? 
  captain james cook was born in yorkshire and had no seeming connection to wales . 
  anyone know why ? 
  `` dai : where are you from ? 
  gethin : rhyl , originally . 
  dai : [ hefina , dai and cliff turn serious ] no , no way . 
  hefina : [ to johnathan ] listen , we do n't mind the gays , and the lesbians , that 's fine . 
  but do n't you dare be bringing people from north wales down here !, 
  the imp shuffled his feet nervously and let out a small cough . 
  no reaction . 
  the imp did n't want to disturb verrine , but , well , it was urgent , and he always said that anyone could , if it was urgent . 
  the imp hated that its boss was verrine : the most impatient of the eight crown princes of hell . 
  it was his specialty of course , tempting men with impatience , but it did not make for a good work environment . 
  ` either you have something to say , or you need the toilet . 
  so either say it , or go away , ' said verrine , without taking his attention away from his paperwork that lay neatly organised in front him on his desk . 
  ` we have a , um , situation , sir , ' whimpered the imp . 
  ` at the docks , sir . ', 
  ` okay . 
  and ? ' replied verrine continuing with his work . 
  ` that 's charon 's domain . 
  have him deal with it . ', 
  ` he ca n't , sir . ', 
  ` why , not ? ', 
  ` they threw him in the styx , sir . ', 
  verrine 's pen paused mid - sentence and his eyes rose to look at the imp over the top of his horn-rimmed glasses . 
  ` what ? ' said verrine , the volume of his voice rising , with a hint of annoyance . 
  ` explain . 
  now . ', 
  ` it 's , er , one of the new condemned , sir . 
  communist . 
  he 's been spreading ideas , getting the rest of the condemned all excited . 
  perhaps you should get down there ? ' the imp had n't meant for the last bit to be a question , but having a crown prince of hell staring at it had made the imp even more uncomfortable than it already was . 
  verrine said nothing . 
  instead , he methodically put the lid on his fountain pen and carefully placed it to one side , in parallel with the paper . 
  next , he removed his horn rimmed glasses , folded back the arms , and gently lay them atop his papers . 
  lastly , he slowly sat back into his chair and brought his hands hand up to chin pensively and looked at the imp, 
  ` no . ' he commanded , his voice deepened . 
  ` you will go to olivier and you will tell him to bring this condemned to me . ', 
  the imp had feared this . 
  it had tried to ready itself , but it knew verrine was not going to receive the next news well . 
  ` you are still here . ' it was no question ; an observation . 
  a statement wrapped in anger . 
  ` it 's just , sir , olivier ... ', 
  ` what about him ? ', 
  ` he is talking the side of the condemned . ' was what the imp had tried to say , but it was barely more audible than a whisper . 
  ` louder ! ' verrine bellowed , still sat back in his chair . 
  ` olivier is siding with the condemned , sir . ', 
  ` then get luvart , or verrier . 
  i do n't care who brings him to me , just bring . 
  him . 
  here ! ' verrine was standing down , his fists knuckle down on his desk , and was yelling at the imp , the imp that was still standing in front of him . 
  ` are they siding with him as well ? ' roared verrine . 
  the imp nodded rapidly in the affirmative . 
  ` out ! ', 
  the imp scurried away as quickly as it could but slower than it wanted .
