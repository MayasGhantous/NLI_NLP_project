  just call it ah ( a-ha ) for short . 
  define hoedown, 
  good luck up there !, 
  hello fellow rick rolled from birth redditor . 
  mother theresa is not a nun !, 
  ... ok she is a nun but she is not a great nun !, 
  no matter how much you wiggle and dance ; the last three drops go down your pants . 
  take bread, 
  dip into anything runnier than bread . 
  depends how it is used . 
  it can work really well . 
  terry pratchett with his igors work wonderfully ( yeth , mathter ) . 
  but he even mocks the points by saying that an igor is nothing without his lisp . 
  but that 's pratchett . 
  it can also be done really really badly . 
  the other option would be australia , which is in the same federation as qatar . 
  australia has plenty of stadiums too . 
  both us and australia are great options though . 
  i would love that , but the world cup before it is in russia ( so uefa ) , so i would doubt they would consider it . 
  certainly an option , of course , but behind usa and australia imo . 
  still , who knows !, 
  they sell it in albert heijn now . 
  the american budweiser . 
  this particular one is n't his best . 
  his take on rugby and football though are much better ( and the only two others i 've seen ), 
  he lives in cumbria though * , so really when england get the world cup the final should be held in brunton park . 
  [ * i 'm assuming since a bbc article on the matter said `` meanwhile , up in cumbria '' ] ( http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/32909649 ) and this article from [ cumberland news ] ( http://www.cumberlandnews.co.uk/news/people/cumbrian-journalist-waging-one-man-war-against-fifa-1.711307 ), 
  have you ?!, 
  * cries from the memory *, 
  and then we got thrashed , so there was karma . 
  but lasers is a dickish thing to do . 
  bridge too far, 
  too easy !, 
  that took all of 2 minutes . 
  nice . 
  flying back to cumbria tomorrow to get married next week !, 
  still have n't written my speech !, 
  haha , so am i !, 
  do what is best for you . 
  in the future , who knows maybe you 'll be back . 
  i left . 
  no regrets whatsoever . 
  go live the right life for you . 
  you get entered into a lottery if the tickets you want are over subscribed . 
  i assume it was due to the logistics but 1956 melbourne games , the equestrian events were held in sweden . 
  ah that makes sense . 
  thought it might have been that the logistics of shipping horses that far could have been an issue !, 
  spy plane , ready . 
  in case anyone is wondering : you can apply at any time during the window . 
  it will not affect your chances of getting the tickets . 
  in the same boat as you . 
  do n't know where you live but you can use a [ pre-paid mastercard like this ] ( http://www.mastercard.co.uk/prepaid-card.html ) *, 
  you have to top it up . 
  so apply for tickets . 
  see what you get . 
  ensure you hav enough on it . 
  tickets . 
  * not sure if they are accepted , but it worked for the rugby world cup, 
  you are correct . 
  no idea why i wrote that . 
  very misleading . 
  so misleading that it is plain wrong . 
  best advice i ever got during an internship : everyone knows you 're clever , you do n't need to prove it . 
  do n't use a big word for the sake of it . 
  thank you for this . 
  i live in the netherlands and it makes me unreasonable bothered . 
  i do n't know where this stands legally , but it annoyed me :, 
  i was in tesco in galway about three weeks before easter . 
  some suits walking around with clip boards . 
  they stop near me as i 'm deciding what the best value meat is . 
  i get the mince for 3 $, 
  `` easter is the second biggest time for us ... '' i hear . 
  the next day the same mince is 3.50 $ and remained so until the week after easter when it became 3 $ again . 
  [ the best last minute goal scored in may 1999 ] ( https://youtu.be/kejwqhldeos?t=94 ), 
  i fell asleep and woke up at 1-0, 
   i 'm a swede, 
  that 's unfair though !, 
  you 're england 's bogey team !, 
  in the valley of the deadly nightshade lie the ruins of a once great abbey . 
  i would love to see furness abbey before the dissolution of the monasteries . 
  anyone know about tickets to these ? 
  i guess it 's the same for the other nations . 
  thanks !, 
  hmm . 
  i disagree . 
  i think english commentary is pretty good , generally speaking . 
  on the bbc , during the wc ? 
  brilliant . 
  this though ? 
  this is shit . 
  and its why he is on something called `` goal '' ( never heard of it before ) and its worse than eurosport highlights levels of bad . 
  but english and american commentary are different . 
  america like statistics . 
  lots of them . 
  the english like background info . 
  they are different and they work for their markets . 
  trevor noah sums it up well https://youtu.be/2r-464kzh_k, 
  we had something like this as a kid . 
  it was a folding camper . 
  there was a toilet .
