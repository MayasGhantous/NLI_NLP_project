  so both are good options , ulimately . 
  it is what you make of it yourself . 
  which course do you really want to do ? 
  which uni do you really want to go to ? 
  which city do you really want to study in . 
  i do n't know your british uni , but i will say amsterdam is a ( relatively ) big city , so while plenty of students , they are all mixed up the general vibe of the city . 
  that said it is a great city in a great country . 
  however , the student life * is * different in the netherlands to the british student life . 
  oh and , in my experience , while you can mess about a bit in first year in britain ( and ireland ) and just pass the year . 
  the dutch expect you study hard from the get-go . 
  just differences i have personally found . 
  hope i have been some help . 
  is n't it on ard ? 
  so if you have ziggo , you should be able to watch it ? 
  aaaand i just realised i misread your post . 
  well two options then i guess !, 
  nicky butt . 
  when i first started following football as a young kid i liked man utd ( i was 6 and they were there best ) . 
  everyone liked cantona or , in my brother 's case , lee sharpe . 
  i went for butt . 
  he was my favourite . 
  i had the blue and white away shirt with his name on it . 
  got loads of grief but whatever . 
  after that it was probably van der saar as i was a keeper and everyone has a player they wanted to emulate . 
  apart from vi , which i do n't even watch that often , i ca n't be doing with a lot of dutch commentary/punditry . 
  just lacks something imo . 
  i 'm surprised it did n't chart after notting hill !, 
  fun ( ish ) fact !, 
  filmed on same day , but not in one shot . 
  check out the video for the wombats - kill the director . 
  it 's a homage to this scene, 
  saw a video of a clogger making clogs . 
  was like watching a hit knife cut butter !, 
  heck of a skill . 
  related question . 
  so ac is used because it 's easier to to step up and step down the voltage allowing for transport across a grid , and to allow it be used in a house . 
  but why are hvdc interconnector used ? 
  as in why are long distance subsea cables generally dc ( some ac ones exist , i know ) . 
  why are n't they ac ? 
  is all to do with voltage ? 
  in the cartoons , yes . 
  i * hate * you, 
  for reference !, 
  nothing personal , duncan, 
  thanks man !, 
  you just made my `` you guys are alright '' list . 
  well before birmingham couple of seasons back no english club had ever won in bruges . 
  would n't say its in the bag . 
  but a professional job should see them safely through, 
  you got downvotes but this was my first thought as well : how do people physically remove their clothes, 
  haha yes . 
  something else i have learnt : do not anger wizards ... 
  thanks !, 
  my so is hungarian and dracula was from transylvania ... you do n't think ... ? 
  but i can see why people would put on weight , especially when organising the wedding !, 
  my family certainly tried their hardest to make it as stressful as possible . 
  my brother studied medicine in the czech republic and the eu says you ca n't descriminate between foreign eu citizens . 
  however , there were two medicine courses : one in czech and one in english . 
  the one in czech was free to any eu national who could speak czech . 
  and the one in english was $ 10k ( i ca n't remember the exact figure , so i 'll use this one ) . 
  if a czech student opted to do the one in english , they would also have to pay the $ 10k . 
  so , you see , the course is offered to all for the same price . 
  out of interest , and feel free to say it 's none of my beeswax , but why would you want to cancel your german citizenship ? 
  mmm ... i 'll give it a shot . 
  i get horrible motion-sick if i try to read in a car . 
  this is something i ca n't stand . 
  i was having a discussion with a man utd about something man utd related . 
  his argument was `` what would a carlisle fan , now anyway ? '', 
  how does my support of a league two club affect my knowledge and opinion of the premier league ? 
  if anything , it should make me more impartial !, 
  good man . 
  top place france, 
  * subtly hides french passport *, 
  went to bergen last year for two nights . 
  absolutely loved the place . 
  did a short fjord cruise and ate whale ( fucking expensive , oh well ) . 
  beer was really really nice . 
  i mean 10 $ for a small glass of ipa , but it was damn tasty . 
  - drink unicum ( black liquer , similar to jaegermeister in taste , bitterer ), 
  - drink palinka ( clear liquer . 
  basically schapps . 
  different flavours ), 
  - drink beer ( soproni 1895 is my favourite for standard lager ), 
  - drink hungarian wine ( e.g. 
  vill\u00e1ny ( a region ) has excellent reds , tokaj is a well know sweet white . 
  bull 's blood is probably the most famous - a full bodied red . ), 
  - go to a ruin bar, 
  ** eat **, 
  deep fried dough covered in creme fraiche , onions , garlic , cheese, 
  - turo rudi - chocolate bar filled with a sweet cheese curd, 
  - goulash soup ( obviously . 
  expensive , and look for for the fucking pigeons . 
  but they are very tasty cakes . 
  i liked the sacha . 
  usual touristy stuff : fisherman 's bastion , chain bridge , budapest castle , citadel , a bath house . 
  maybe even catch an hungarian football match !, 
  ferencvaros just opened a new stadium quite recently . 
  ** be prepared **, 
  to not understand the language . 
  you 'll be fine for english in budapest though i would say .
