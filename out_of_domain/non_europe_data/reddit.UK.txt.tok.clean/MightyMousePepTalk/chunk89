  i always have been !, 
  it 's a big city . 
  it has it 's problems . 
  do n't be a moron . 
  i spent 5 years in a long distance relationship before moving to her country 3 years ago . 
  we got married in june . 
  what 's an hour , eh ? 
  really ?!, 
  this sort of thing is strictly protected by eu law . 
  i 'm not saying herp derp stupid us system . 
  but is n't there some sort of similar ruling state side ? 
  totally just took it from the once upon a time actors . 
  why does the little boat behind it act like a micro machine badly trying to get round a corner ? 
  i found a bar to watch ireland v france in a tiny town in patagonia last march , so i reckon you 'll be able to find somewhere showing world cup matches in ba or salta !, 
  i ca n't say how argentina fans will receive an england shirt . 
  i 'll leave it to you to risk it . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ you 'll ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ be ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ fine, 
  great player . 
  top scorer for us one season !, 
  honestly no idea . 
  i do n't even know how i would find that info . 
  it was 18 in total . 
  i would guess a fair few . 
  7 of the 18 in 2009/2010 were penalties . 
  not the man who created them , but the man who owned the company . 
  but it was the owner , not the founder . 
  my / r/showerthoughts of the day was that they should have a third european competition that is just straight knock-out for all the teams that got knocked out of the el before the group stages and the third round qualifying losers of the cl . 
  some random teams they would have there !, 
  could be a lot of fun . 
  when 's it out ? 
  nah he 'll get to the final , make one minor slip up and that will cost him the title because they only judge the overall winner based on bake in the final episode , which is nonsense . 
  the other episodes should count for something , surely . 
  twin twin - moustache, 
  britney spears - work bitch, 
  nicki minaj - starships, 
  verka serduchka - dancing lasha tumbai - this is my all time number one, 
  shakira - dare, 
  freaky fortune - rise up, 
  pitbul ft ke $ ha - timber, 
  generally speaking eurovision is a gold mine for work out songs . 
  except this year . 
  was all power ballards this year .

  make sure the shiny side is facing up . 
  if there are air holes at bottom of bbq be sure to poke through foil for them .

  he 's being told he does n't seem `` up to the job '' and other such stuff . 
  i know my brother and he will do anything you ask of him as best as he can , but i get the impression he does n't understand the american service sector . 
  can you please give me some tips i can pass on to him ? 
  we are franco-irish but born and bred in england , and i 've told him to emphasise his irishness with the clientel . 
  what other info can you give to help him out ? 
  thank you reddit . 
  i 'll respond to as many responses as i can . 
  edit : i 've passed on all the responses so far to my brother . 
  you 've all been super helpful even though i was a bit vague in what he was doing ( truthfully , i 'm not 100 % but i 'm pretty sure it the games area ) . 
  i 'm sure your tips will make him a better employee . 
  thanks guys and gals !, 
  i was walking down the street in the netherlands and a man just stopped me and started talking to me . 
  my dutch is n't very good , so at first i did n't have a clue what he was saying , but upon reflection he asked `` can i ask you a question ? '', 
  at first i ignored him because i thought he was a crazy , or worse , a charity mugger . 
  i was going to tell him `` i do n't speak dutch '' in english but he probably would have spoken english , so i switched to french . 
  this confused my brain and all that came out was an `` uuhh '' as i was doing a hand gesture near my ear to tell him i do n't understand ( would have made sense if i said something audible ) . 
  he immediately said `` oh , sorry '' and walked off so i assume he thought i was deaf . 
  so , reddit , what disabilities have you feigned , accidently or otherwise ? 
  tl ; dr : tried to ignore a man asking me a question in dutch and utter inaudible nonsense instead of replying and he thought i was deaf . 
  disclaimer : it was not my intention to pass off as someone who is deaf , it was purely by accident . 
  i just moved to arnhem from maastricht and my bike has broken ( needs a new bottom bracket , i think ) . 
  can anyone recommend a good , honest , not too expensive bike shop in arnhem ? 
  does anyone know where in cumbria that abbey was suppose to be ? 
  doing my head in . 
  not that cumbria existed in 1207 !, 
  a famous ( for ulverston ) monument in cumbria dedicated to an influential man in british history . 
  it was his idea ( allegedly ) to exile napoleon to st helena when he was the second secretary to the admiralty ( now the permanent secretary , so the highest ranking civil servant ) . 
  the most northern city in the usa is named after him : barrow , alaska . 
  greeting / r/netherlands , i recently started playing football for an amateur team and i speak some dutch ( a2/b1 standard ) , but i do n't know any phrases that one would hear on the pitch . 
  i was hoping you could help . 
  for reference i 'm a goalkeepr . 
  i 've made a list that i will update as i get answers . 
  if you can think of anymore that i should know that would be great :, 
  '' ** man on ** '' : `` tijd '', 
  '' ** keepers on ** '' : `` keeper '', 
  '' ** push up '' / `` push out ** '' : `` aansluiten '', 
  '' ** mark up ** '' : `` aanpakken '', 
  '' ** keepers !, 
  ** '' : ( i presume i could just use the same phrase here ? ), 
  '' ** square it ** '' : '' ( baaltje ) breed '', 
  edit : updated the list . 
  many thanks everyone !, 
  this is invaluable . 
  really appreciate it . 
  special mention goes to / u/damindenie for the extra phrases . 
  so , i work for a company via an uitzendbureau , as the company has no actual employees as it is a joint-venture and its employees are either seconded , or external contractors . 
  i am the latter . 
  working via the uitzendbureau was a work around . 
  my fase a period is almost over ( 78 weeks ) and i would expect to move onto a fase b. 
  however , my uitzendbureau has just told me that they will move me to another bureau for 3 months , then move me back again to them . 
  this means my contract `` resets '' and i start back at the beginning of fase a. 
  does this sound iffy to anyone ? 
  my company is ok with it , for whatever reason . 
  however , i am led to believe that with a fase a i can not get a credit card ( well , thats the reason abn amro gave me , when they turned me down ) .
