  so my question is , does anyone think this is iffy ? 
  why would the uitzenbureau not want me on fase b ( they said it is not common for people to get fase b anymore ) . 
  why would my company not want me on fase b ? 
  i 'll probably contact the juridisch loket , but i was hoping reddit would let me know their thoughts . 
  edit : thanks for the answers so far . 
  i have been doing the job for 18 months in october ( once you take into account holidays , which do n't count towards the weeks as i understand it . ), 
  i understand the whole permanent contract thing , but fase b is not a permanent contract , just a temporary contract . 
  edit ii : thanks for the replies guys . 
  seems above board at least , if still a bit annoying !, 
  i 'll be pushing for normal contract from one of the parent companies . 
  i 've been there 18 months . 
  must be doing something right . 
  op says while posting this from work !, 
  so i went to ikgeefbloed.nl to see if i could donate blood and it said i ca n't because i lived in the uk between 1980 and 1996 . 
  i understand why ( mad cow disease ) but i was 9 at the end of 1996 . 
  online test aside , do you know if i could still give my blood ? 
  would the blood centre be able to screen me to see if it was good ? 
  edit : thanks guys . 
  i knew cjd was an issue , but i did n't realise the only way to see if you have it is an autopsy !, 
  it 's a shame , but as you guys say the rules are there for a reason and they are totally understandable . 
  nothing i can do !, 
  really appreciate all the answers . 
  as the title says : i am going to hsv with some friends in a couple of weeks . 
  we 're staying near the hauptbahnhof , so i assume that getting to the stadium will be easy enough . 
  our match day tickets give us free transport to and from the stadium , right ? 
  my main question is how to buy beer : i know some clubs make you have a card that you top up ( bvb , for example ) , is this the same at hsv ? 
  how much does a beer cost at the stadium ? 
  how early should we get to the stadium ? 
  i was thinking about an hour before kick-off for the the atmosphere . 
  thanks !, 
  well , fair play for never giving up , and you dominated possession as well as having 30 shots on goal to our 3 , but the last kick of the game ?!, 
  97:54 is the goal time according to the bbc . 
  so late in the game , and just after a penalty save too !, 
  well , the point should be enough to keep us up i think . 
  enjoy league one !, 
  i was watching the world 's end last night when something struck me about the names . 
  obviously , gary king is the king . 
  at first i was thinking it could be a soft g so ja-rinking !, 
  but that was a stretch . 
  but then , hang on , steven prince ( paddy considine ) ? 
  prince ? 
  of course !, 
  steven prince, 
  andy knightly, 
  oliver chamberlain ( a chamberlain manages a royal household ), 
  peter page ( a young male servant ), 
  any other names ? 
  shane hawkins - a bird of prey . 
  shane bullied peter . 
  preyed on him , if you will . 
  mr shepherd - all the blanks were sheep and he was their leader, 
  the marmelade sandwich , who were sirens in the mermaid :, 
  erika leekes - a leak e.g. 
  leaky ship, 
  beck salt - the sea is salty, 
  tracy benson - a benson is a type of carp . 
  ninja edit - basil . 
  basil comes from greek word * basileus * meaning king, 
  lastly - the reverand green - he sold pot . 
  anyone notice this ? 
  or have i been really slow ? 
  male . 
  this will probably be longer than i intend !, 
  ** background **, 
  when i was a kid i was a bit chubby . 
  when i was 12 i decided to eat less sweets and drink less coke and not take seconds . 
  age 18 , after years of rugby and football i was in good shape ( sorry ca n't remember my weight ), 
  then i went on a gap year and to uni and got big and did no sport . 
  combination of terrible diet , beer , and tearing ankle ligaments in second day at university and using it as an excuse . 
  ** weight loss **, 
  * summer 2010 * - photo of me on the rope swing . 
  i had just finished an erasmus exchange in france where i ate a lot or flammkeuchen and drank a lot of beer and wine . 
  this is me at my heaviest . 
  saw this pic and knew i needed to change . 
  i started by eating smaller portions and eating better . 
  cooked big meals and divided them out so i would eat well every day and not have to cook . 
  i went down to 98kg by summer 2011 . 
  then i moved to the netherlands and jumped up to 100kg and stayed there . 
  * summer 2014 *, 
  i was still 100kg . 
  i had joined a football team but it was n't enough . 
  i had a new job where i travel a lot and i was finding it hard to eat well . 
  * september 2014 - august 2015 * - 100kg - 93.5 kg . 
  tl ; dr rugby and getting engaged, 
  i found a rugby team where i live in nl and a chance encounter with one of the team convinced me to join . 
  i had been out of the game properly for years . 
  i found rugby to be a big motivation and researched training routines to get for my position of lock . 
  also in september 2014 i got engaged and was motivated to get fit for the wedding ( i was 95kg for it ) in june this year . 
  so , i started doing the couch25k ( i can run 5k now in 26 minutes and a 10k in 55 ) and throwing some weights around . 
  since the end of last season ( march 2015 ) i started sprint training and long distance running and hiit for push ups and squats . 
  all a bit ad hoc as i never followed a programme . 
  if i had i would have lost weight quicker i think !, 
  ** diet **, 
  i started counting calories but could never keep that up . 
  i found using a smaller plate has helped a lot . 
  typical day of food is :, 
  breakfast - 200g natural yoghurt, 
  lunch - salad and fruit salad ( work canteen varies them each day ), 
  dinner - whatever i want but in a small portion . 
  i , or my so , cooks it .
