  finished 3-2 in the end . 
  proud of that stranger . 
  i always say yeah , ask for their name , number , then say if they call me again i 'll report them for harassment . 
  well was the tree insured ? 
  allardyce looks completely different !, 
  and dyche looks like michael cudlitz, 
  nunez , cheyrou , pellegrino , were way before five years ago . 
  of course he 's not , anyone that would bid something like that are doing it for his potential . 
  but it 's obviously a load of horseshit, 
  until we pulled out as we did n't see it as value for money, 
  one of my friends used to go that buffet star place , still the butt of many jokes . 
  very happy with them, 
  i 'd probably just talk asoiaf and theories, 
  save us , origi !, 
  last year it would be easy . 
  jarvis to carroll = goal . 
  mig ; johnson , mascherano , skrtel , moreno ; alonso , gerrard , hendo ; sturridge , suarez , sterling . 
  i 'd do that . 
  fucking hate playing against him . 
  ca n't stop him . 
  probably , yeah . 
  it 'd help if italian football has another golden age , to really bring more attention to you lot . 
  it 's the principle !, 
  it 's fine mate , you 're from runcorn , you 've probably ate worse ... 
  same , once had a pancake which was black through and through . 
  ( widnes here , i think both towns have no decent food ), 
  i 'm in uni fella , my brother used to go kingsway though . 
  my main experience of runcorn is your terrible roads on my driving lessons , hah . 
  how can you live with them ? 
  reddit uses english . 
  i think that person probably thinks english was invented in america ... 
  goalie comes out , nowhere near the ball , clatters striker and injures him ? 
  no foul , play on . 
  all the fucking time, 
  it 'll help both of them , too . 
  not just mario . 
  mario is obviously not one to rely on his movement into the lines , that 'll be danny 's job , mario can hold up the ball really well though . 
  when does he have a blackpool accent ? 
  he 's from birmingham . 
  you do realise cheshire is n't posh , right ? 
  just say the word ` lad ' all the time , you 'll be fine, 
  to be fair , i passed my test today , and i would n't know what to do in this situation ? 
  who would have right of way ? 
  they dress how my grandad used to . 
  so many flat caps . 
  i 'm from england , not too close to birmingham , but the accent does n't seem too off to me . 
  i think you 'd have to be from birmingham to know what exactly is off about it . 
  passed my driving test this morning, 
  i wo n't talk about how it gets on , but that first episode hooked me like no other . 
  goddamn i think everyone loved the first episode . 
  such a fresh concept . 
  jacob 's ladder was a bit creepy . 
   i wonder will we get ps + edition, 
  destiny 's gash , but how did it have a bad release like driveclub ? 
  destiny 's servers were/are superb , as were game sales . 
  op , there 's no point unless you link the articles . 
  this is a pretty common feeling i find . 
  it 's why so many people think of themselves as scouse first , english second , and why hardly anyone cares about the english national sides, 
  i nearly crashed on a driving lesson because some cunt did n't turn his fog lights off when he seen me . 
  if it was a definite goal , then what 's the issue ? 
  he 's giving the goalie a chance to save it . 
  yeah but it sticks to you if the water 's warm . 
  it 's formerly gmtv, 
  hahaha , love the little chuckle from behind the camera . 
  exactly . 
  seen the trailer , thought ` boy that looks shite ' . 
  wo n't waste my time on it . 
  this is how traffic happens, 
  oh god , just end it roy , just stop speaking , please . 
  no need to create this debate , just talk to rodgers about it , not newspapers . 
  clearly digging great british bake off . 
  but what was the score ? 
  cheers pal, 
  it 's such a typical teenagers subreddit . 
  ` should i go to prom ? 
  i have no friends ' , ` my dad wo n't let me go the cinema [ rant ] ' , ` snapchat thread ' , ` lol this memee ', 
  i 'm subscribed to both in fact , does n't mean i agree/upvote/comment on every submission on here or r/teenagers . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ you 're ^ ^ ^ ^ in ^ ^ ^ ^ my ^ ^ ^ ^ lectures ^ ^ ^ ^ then ... 
  surely everyone feels the same way ? 
  100k karma points for a reddit key ring . 
  [ there 's loads on here . 
  ] ( http://mrgugu.com/collections/sweaters/man ), 
  scouser 1 , standing by . 
  it 's because a lot of our players play for england , and play the majority of matches . 
  hodgson was woeful here , but i personally do n't mind him , i just wish he 'd be a bit more media savvy and not try stir the pot a bit , when he does n't need to . 
  agree . 
  think markovic will show his quality soon too . 
  * queue the singular tranmere fan to jump in . 
  there 's loads of horror movies i like , but are n't too scary . 
  ( pontypool , trick r ' treat , session 9 , the thing , etc ) , but the fourth kind and signs fucked with my head , aliens just do that to me . 
  we were always going to be underwhelming so far , any team that loses suarez is obviously going to miss him . 
  think we 're the united of last season , where / r/soccer just hates on us . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ yeah, 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ now ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ get ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ closer . 
  hohala 's admitted to misconduct iirc , and been banned for a match . 
  for english rugby league , yeah . 
  but in the uk , it 's not too popular . 
  only really in the north . 
  packed out old trafford stadium though . 
  really think deulofeu is either going to sink or swim .
