  this videos hilarious though . 
  deserve it . 
  i mean , you win the record for the most crowd surfers in the world , you expect it !, 
  but yeah , they really are the best live band i 've been to, 
  i joined reddit , just so unsubscribe from / r/atheism the sheer stupidity and elitist attitude is too much . 
  though , the / r/atheism is the sole evil of reddit . 
  such an elitist , idiotic community . 
   pretty nice and tolerant, 
  well then , let 's take a look at the front page this morning . 
  top post is a satirical picture comparing doctor who to muhammed , in which it is criticising muhammad . 
  r/atheism does nothing but criticise religious believers for having something they do not - faith in a god . 
  the vast majority of religious believers do not try to push their religion unto atheists , however the / r/atheism does nothing but call them crazy , criticise their religion , and does not actually discuss anything , they just use shitty macros and memes without a discussion into the actual atheistic beliefs . 
  well , no worries , perhaps religious subreddits are the same , if they 're all the same , i ca n't criticise / r/atheism right ? 
  well then , let 's look at / r/christianity front page . 
  the entire front page is discussion , and no shitty macros at all . 
  the top post is a discussion about religious experiences entitled `` the coolest experience ever yesterday ... '' , none of which criticises other religions , nor atheism . 
  over to / r/buddhism now . 
  front page full of discussion topics , and not macros nor memes . 
  top two posts are about meditiation and the dalali llama . 
  perhaps calling it, 
   sole evil of reddit, 
  is a bit over the top , and yes those subreddits you listed are also dreadful , but for me / r/atheism is worse , as the elitist attitude is not present in any other subreddit i 've gone into . 
  you do n't need to , to understand it . 
  but if i were you , i would anyway - aliens is a super film . 
  my primary school used to be a graveyard apparently , so whenever we kicked the ball over the fence , it disappeared and the dead people got it . 
  oh and there was supposed to be a haunted house a few roads down , and my friends said they went in there , and there was a bath tub with a dead woman in it . 
  at the time i believed it , then i realised why would they leave a dead woman in the bathtub after she was killed ? 
  i would have loved an urban legend about a man in a bear outfit performing fellatio . 
  that scene was wonderful, 
  high five for uk !, 
  not rape,

  it took you that long to give into the power that is sigur ros ?!, 
  dawn of the dead would be fun though !, 
  all those motorbike gangs and people playing with the zombies !, 
  ... fair point . 
  but think of the motorbike gangs !, 
  completely agreed on eeyore . 
  lazy bastard . 
  plus you get to put the zombies on takeshi 's castle, 
  it 's not over here in the uk , it 's quite the classic . 
  like father ted . 
  tim : what 's the hold up ? 
  mike : there been an accident . 
  someone got hurt . 
  tim : who ? 
  mike : a lady . 
  tim : how d'you know ? 
  mike : because we hit her . 
  tim : did we ? 
  mike : yeah . 
  that 's her there .

  tell that to those who frequent / r/atheism, 
  catcher in the rye is a great book . 
  very relateable to teens feeling down and lonely . 
  i recommend it . 
  you are not . 
  but you 're probably being changed into the typical r/r/atheism nobber , which i strongly recommend against . 
  money . 
  catcher in the rye ? 
  i would n't classify british humour as just one category , it does vary greatly in the manner it 's made . 
  watch spaced , or father ted , and then peep show or only fools and horses etc , and you 'll see it 's all quite different types !, 
  ha , i 'm currently reading it . 
  i personally would n't call him a whiney bitch , he just seems melancholic and a bit messed up ( so far ), 
  oh god yes . 
  crytek get on it already , it has a massive following !, 
  you only love her coz she 's dead are pretty damn good , paraffin is my particular favourite . 
  ** shock horror ** i listen to radiohead and sigur ros !, 
  i 'm a redditor 's wet dream . 
  they 're both fantastic in different ways , two of my favourite artists . 
  thom yorke and johnny greenwood are pretty fantastic musicians . 
  enter shikari are another of my favourites , not the most gifted musically , but damn they put on a good show and have some catchy tunes . 
  nine inch nails , fleetwood mac , mumford and sons , slipknot also have recent plays from my spotify . 
  [ this fucker from courage the cowardly dog .

  still terrifies me, 
  ` super ' . 
  the one with ellen page and rainn wilson , it came out about the same time as kick-ass , except it 's not very liked . 
  i find it absolutely hilarious . 
  i 've never seen this ever , i have to say . 
  in my experience , say i 'm a girl , it 'll normally be upvoted because sex . 
  i used to use that , but being a liverpool fan on there does not end well . 
  / r/picturesofiansleeping, 
  if there 's grass on the field , play ball . 
  even though it 's after a nuclear war , it looks fucking fabulous . 
  [ here 's mine ] ( http://thumbp2-ir2.thumb.mail.yahoo.com/tn?sid=1127920925&amp;mid=afntfbwaapwvt93t6qcu0nsrarw&amp;midoffset=2_0_0_1_14967985&amp;partid=2&amp;f=1713&amp;fid=inbox&amp;w=637&amp;h=480&amp;httperr=1 ), 
  believe it or not , it 's fake :p i am going to stretch it though , probably order one tonight . 
  stretched ears are cool i think . 
  piercings in general are . 
  [ i am a mummy ] ( http://oi48.tinypic.com/351g2nk.jpg ), 
  the ear which apparently indicates your sexuallity changes each town you go in . 
  it honestly does n't matter at all . 
  healing time is about 6 weeks , just get some tcp and a cotton bud and clean it every few days until then . 
  after that , take out the stud and put whatever you like in . 
  [ here we are ] ( http://oi49.tinypic.com/1y4k9e.jpg ), 
  you can tell it 's the summer , i 've not shaved in a while hehe . 
  as long as you do n't leave face piercings in that long , when you remove them , the holes will go !, 
  pierce pierce pierce !, 
  the fact that i was not always here , the world was here before me , and millions of people had lives i 'll never know about - and after i die there will be millions of people i 'll never know about .
