  dream house . 
  i thought it looked good , but the trailer gave away far too much - figured there might be another surprise in it or something , if that spoiler is given away , nope . 
  have to say i was hoping the lib dems would pull out of the coalition to try save face , after the failure of their local elections . 
  shame . 
  have to say , i know little of the titanic , but is it true it was rushed being made , and thus had a few errors in it which led to the downfall ? 
  ` super ' with rainn wilson and ellen page . 
  came out about the same time as kick-ass , except i actually enjoyed super . 
  go speak to them , could be anything . 
  for all you know , could be a no smoking zone and they 're pissed !, 
  damn right we do . 
  personally , i ca n't pee next to anyone . 
  heck , i ca n't pee in a bathroom if there 's * anyone * else in there . 
  my bladder is shy . 
  not really , it 's more of a bonus . 
  abnormally large tits are silly , but a nice pair or shapely ones are awesome . 
  [ i am a tiger ] ( http://oi46.tinypic.com/mmzu34.jpg ), 
  fuck me you must be clever . 
  i barely passed my gcse in year 11 . 
  if you got done with your gcse 's already , you should well pass at least . 
  next up for the tories ' is bringing back the tripartite system . 
  so out of touch it 's silly . 
  ca n't see many employers giving too much of a crap about the gcse 's though . 
  i know they 're * apparently * supposed to , but a-levels and possibly degrees will be looked at first . 
  you have little chance to get a part time job anyway mate . 
  the employer has to pay a fair bit more since you 're under 18 , plus you 're on inflexible hours . 
  there 's not many jobs as it is for full time people , keep trying for sure , but do n't hold your breathe . 
  paper rounds are n't bad though . 
  # 15-20 a week for about 2/3 hours work, 
   not using the word maybe, 
  dare i say it ? 
  call me maybe . 
  * sigh * . 
  asking on reddit , you 'll get tons of people who are in the same boat . 
  do n't sweat it , it 'll happen , do n't rush into it if you do n't want to . 
  you 'll probably slag about in college . 
  i found it quite amusing , not cocky . 
  would n't recommend an industrial piercing . 
  i like them too , but it takes about a year to fully heal , you have to clean them constantly , and can quite easily get caught on things and that * will * hurt like a bitch . 
  rafa offered him out because he had a dreadful year the season before , that inspired him to up his game . 
  without the pushing out , alonso most likely would n't have had such a season . 
  was it anything like ` goodbye lenin ' ? 
  i think most philosophical questions you ca n't ` obsess over for no good reason ' , they 're some of the biggest questions in life itself , and should be discussed . 
  in modern life no one thinks about those questions , there 's too many material goods and whatnot distacting us for answering the biggest questions of all , like ` how ought i live ' ? 
  volcano would kill a lot in a large radius , but by no means all people or anything . 
  the fumes and smoke would enter the atmosphere and block out the sun , killing off a lot of the sunlight which will kill most other things . 
  as a neutral , this is sad to me . 
  the old firm was the only real scottish match i 'd go out of my way to watch , this just makes the top division about 50 % weaker , and puts celtic at about 99.9 % to win the league . 
  not * everyone * here is american or using the us system of schooling . 
  just keep that in mind . 
  do n't know about where you live , but they probably do n't even care , just act confident, 
  false , we got the big bang theory from over the ocean :( there 's plenty of good us tv that comes on , but a fair lot of it is tripe though . 
  arrested development is usually on a cable channel at 1am , whilst friends has been on non-stop for 8 years , 4 episodes a day . 
  so ... you 're the hipster on / r/teenagers, 
  [ jesus christ ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_indbpvryk ) always gets me . 
  well jesus christ , i 'm not scared to die, 
  i 'm a little bit scared of what comes after, 
  do i get the gold chariot, 
  do i float through the ceiling, 
  am i correct in thinking that is about their friend who committed suicide ?

  your move , bruce_campbell21, 
  op is a member of 6 months , has it changed that much in 6 months ? 
  really ? 
  our rugby team used to be the best in the world in the ' 90 's , and we gave the world one of the people from sex and the city . 
  shame we ca n't offer more , but the daft wages of our average players are just far too high to actually sign good players on good wages until we get rid of them . 
  our scouting system is dreadful anyway , we 'll end up with some average english player . 
  very different players . 
  he 's a van der vaart player , not modric, 
  he would have joined if we had a higher wage budget , with less of a joe cole , and aquilani on the books . 
  i 'm pretty confident he did n't choose spurs over us for any other reason than wages . 
  that 's true , but as we 're not in the champions league , nor are spurs , and they have lower wages and more to spend . 
  this is why i 'd never move out of england . 
  seriously .

  the chances this girl , actually does infact use reddit , subscribes to this subreddit of about 10k and will view it today , and look at this individual thread and think `` oh they , that 's me ! '', 
  is pretty low . 
  perhaps if it was in / r/askreddit, 
  ** lollipop chainsaw ** - really fun game with some re playability . 
  fun humour , since it 's from suda51 , and it 's very cheap already . 
  ** bully scholarship edition ** - favourite rockstar game , really fun and had me gripped . 
  ** re orc ** - okay game , nothing super special , a decent campaign and a fun online . 
  ** binary domain ** - my game of the year , absolutely wonderful game . 
  just play it . 
  do it . 
  torres and owen are more hated than diouf , thought diouf is a cunt .
