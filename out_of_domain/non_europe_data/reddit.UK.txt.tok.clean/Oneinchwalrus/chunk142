  got an awfully big head . 
  do you realise moreno is actually a great crosser ? 
  watch his first few games back , and when he was at sevilla . 
  get brannagan on !, 
  the only newcastle player who looks like he tried , gets sent off . 
  stupid first yellow , too . 
  edit - terrible challenge !, 
  how many newcastle players get sent off against us ? 
  it 's mental . 
  your next match when he 's banned will be ... fun to watch , i 'm sure . 
  amazing how a club like newcastle can be playing with mike williamson at cb , and have a manager like carver . 
  bet he 's glad he did n't join arsenal then . 
  until you meet an average side in the round of sixteen and go out again . 
  i got downvoted the other day in the ` americans , why do you own guns ' thread , because someone said ` because it 's my constitutional right ' , and i said that 's not a reason to own a gun , just because you can . 
  people always say where is gendry ? 
  is he still on the boat ? 
  and all that , when maybe * he 's just not an important character . 
  well said . 
  people in the thread said things like for ` protection ' , or ` hunting ' , and okay , i get that . 
  that 's an actual reason , but ` because i can ' is just a stupid reason . 
  us and gladbach have a great friendship . 
  i always forget he played for you lot . 
  do you think jedinak is world class ? 
  hahaha !, 
  di santo . 
  dear lord . 
  it 's actually getting some pretty decent reviews . 
  ign seems to [ love it ] ( http://uk.ign.com/articles/2015/04/15/unfriended-review ), 
  and it is n't just based on war of the roses , a lot of other bits are taken from a lot of history . 
  spoilers for upcoming twow . 
  [ sample chapter from twow ] ( http://www.ign.com/boards/threads/sample-chapter-from-winds-of-winter.207815997/ ) and [ russian battle ] ( http://english.pravda.ru/history/13-01-2004/4561-history-0/ ), 
  i love handanovic . 
  i was gon na buy buffon , but i packed handanovic , and he 's been great for me . 
  kicking is shocking though . 
  club for me too . 
  i do n't think you 'll find too many scousers who prefer nt over club . 
  yeah , coutinho has n't been as good as some , who have n't made the shortlist , but it 's not our choice . 
  the players decide . 
  why ? 
  could be a nice surprise if it 's decent . 
  kung pow enter the fist, 
  tucker and dale vs evil, 
  but it 's not our choice , it 's the *** players *** player of the year . 
  do n't read the comics then ... 
  sau is still pretty lethal though . 
  became unbearable at christmas matches , good lord . 
  yeah it is . 
  get the shock of my life walking from greggs to mount pleasant . 
  every time i near shit myself . 
  how long did it take you to come up with this one ? 
  not even the second to last one ... 
  in my secondary school , they really did n't care . 
  even our strictest teachers did n't care . 
  though , if i said cunt , and a teacher heard it , they would have probably told me off, 
  the people in paris were alright when i went , but when i went to the south of france , the people i met were despicable !, 
  what did he say it in response to ? 
  ca n't we all just get along ... 
  is session 9 still on netflix ? 
  read the title of the thread . 
  i just know when it comes out , this 'll be the first game i play on ps4 and just ca n't physically stop for 30 hours . 
  i go back to them every year or two , and they 're still as good as ever , i just never had a chance to play them online . 
  still not as much of a dick as fashanu, 
   `` when does an old man uncage a dead bird ? '', 
  when he realises it 's dead ? 
  gim me the trailer, 
  no goals in our team , bit weird how we can spend so much money in the summer , and be left with no midfielders to put on the bench , and play with sterling up top . 
  nor are we . 
  a lot of warriors kits are a bit meh . 
  can plays five positions each match . 
  coutinho will win us this cup on his own, 
  as soon as he switch to four at the back that happens . 
  3 cb 's makes us defensively difficult to break , but does n't half destroy our attack . 
  with can , we have our own kevin grosskreutz, 
  he 's a pretty good crosser , but he is barely allowed to get forwards , when he does , there 's no height in our side . 
  rodgers is really gambling , then . 
  he was n't even bad today . 
  rodgers has fucked up by putting gerrard into a dm position . 
  again . 
  you know , brendan , when we were conceding 2/3 a game ? 
  yeah , that 's when gerrard was playing there . 
  oh be quiet . 
  glen johnson to save the day ? 
  that was shocking . 
  rodgers fucked the game up with his subs . 
  no desire , no ability to defend ( skrtel/lovren . 
  really ? 
  ) , and no one who can score . 
  manager shat the bed . 
  players shocking . 
  we 're not even as good as we were two seasons ago . 
  it 'll be an interesting situation . 
  kenny got sacked for less . 
  he won us a cup , got to a final of another , but shat the bed in the league . 
  this year we 've been absolutely terrible . 
  looking at us play last year , i was in the ` we 're more than a one man side ' , it was n't just suarez/sturridge playing incredibly well , they got those around them to , too . 
  but looking at this year , we were just a one man side , with a manager who knew how to get the best out of suarez/sturridge . 
  now , we 've signed complete shite , and played shite all year . 
  i do n't know what 'll happen with rodgers , but if we were to sack him , i 'd know who i 'd want to replace him .
