  ca n't see sterling knuckling down like suarez did . 
  six feet under . 
  it 's a character development , not really a tv show . 
  i do n't normally cry in movies or shows , but i teared up a few times in this . 
  favourite show . 
   fsg wo n't have it any other way . 
  then why has it happened for the last few years , then ? 
  an fa cup and a carling cup . 
  i 'm not american , though . 
  [ pfft , nothing compared to mine ... ] ( http://autopazar.co.uk/media/1244/used_renault_clio_2004_blue_hatchback_petrol_manual_for_sale_in_warwickshire_uk.jpg ), 
  as soon as i seen that ford ( ? ), 
  in the background , i knew you were british . 
  i 'm english . 
  i * like * my country , but i 'm not patriotic . 
  i 'm english . 
  got a bit boring at 18 , when you can drink legally . 
  on a motorway when there 's a cop there , sticking to the speed limit . 
  three lanes of people doing 69 mph . 
  there 's so many different types of drinks , they all taste different . 
  beer/cider/wine / spirits , and then loads of different types of all those ... 
  little fucker handballed it . 
  what a cheat . 
  the office , futurama , trailer park boys , arrested dev . 
  pulp fiction . 
  do n't wear liverpool gear . 
  sit there , you can clap if we score or something , but do n't go ott and no one will be bothered . 
  few years ago i was sat next to an evertonian at anfield , no issues . 
  as long as you 're not a cunt you 're fine . 
  there 's a horrible roundabout near me , which no one can get right . 
  this is right in the town centre , accidents [ always happen . ] ( http://i2.liverpoolecho.co.uk/incoming/article9310593.ece/alternates/s615/js63995515.jpg ) . 
  no one can seem to get it right . 
  funny thing is pal , it 's not actually in liverpool , i live just outside in a not-so-big town . 
  problem is , there 's about 4 supermarkets around it , a huge market , an industrial park , central bus station , shopping centre etc , so you get loads of people who have never used the roundabout before trying to navigate it , and there 's no markings or indications whatsoever . 
  use that bad boy at 5pm on a friday , you 're playing with fire . 
  age has been lallana 's friend . 
  i 'm going to race him . 
  i 've only heard the uk one since they were on graham norton 's show the other week . 
  apparently estonia 's song is really good . 
  best get my stein out !, 
  why do france always have crap songs ? 
  at least we * occasionally * have catchy songs, 
  this sounds like a justin timberlake song, 
  * sigh *, 
  * upvoted *, 
  definitely has a few kids in his basement, 
  electro velvet actually sounded decent on graham norton show the other week, 
  * ^ ^ at ^ ^ least ^ ^ they ^ ^ got ^ ^ in ^ ^ the ^ ^ competition ... * , 
  this is great !, 
  this is our most ` eurovisiony ' entry in ages, 
  i really think we 're gon na give you 's full points , even if it 's shite . 
  the yanks would get 0 points from everyone . 
  i 'd watch it . 
  because otherwise we would n't get in ... 
  that was terrible, 
  first year i 've seen a / r/eurovision subreddit , this thread 's great so far . 
  oooh i like lithuania, 
  do all girls in lithuania look like that ? 
  and here 's me watching it on my own for 10 years !, 
  and down it when someone kisses , too . 
  dawn french is serbian ? 
  are you russian ? 
  he done something bad as a kid , and now this ? 
  someone hire a private investigator . 
  the girl from brave ? 
  because eurovision is always camp as fuck . 
  it 's cheesy europop , and recently lgbt have actually been given rights in most of these countries, 
  catchy , but i ca n't see this winning . 
  for someone to beat that , they 'd have to fuck on the stage . 
  really look like cat deeley, 
  it 'd default to germany . 
  like everything else greek . 
  said there was a shortage of botox in montenegro, 
  he looks like david guest . 
  looks like cat woman, 
  ` love injected ' hahaha, 
  needs more lithuania, 
  afraid it 's just a one-off , even if you 's do win . 
  oh , my mistake then !, 
  this year has n't had too many wacky songs, 
  the georgian girl looks like she 'd crush me, 
  is she going to get out a whip and fuck someone up ? 
  she hit the perfect balance between terrifying and sexy, 
  quite enjoyed that to be fair . 
   liverpool plot # 30m raid for benteke, 
  ailing reds plan to strike for aston villa forward whose goals helped tim sherwood 's men beat the drop this season, 
  by jonathan northcroft, 
  liverpool are plotting a recruitment drive , spearheaded by the # 30m capture of christian benteke , that they hope will enable them to make up ground at the top of the premier league -- and help persuade raheem sterling to sign a new contract . 
  james milner , danny ings and fiorentina 's brazilian goalkeeper , neto , are other primary targets as brendan rodgers seeks proven talent to enhance his squad . 
  rest in paywall, 
  suppose it 's legit . 
  we 'll never learn, 
  not just that , one who ca n't run in behind . 
  two wingers , sterling and ibe who ca n't beat the first man with the cross . 
  so what do we do ? 
  buy a striker who 's good in the air . 
  would n't be surprised if he joins in with the rest of them , hanging about on the box ... 
  he knows nothing this bloke . 
  says a lot of things . 
  well in san marino !, 
  love how they got the programme time on bbc1 so wrong .
