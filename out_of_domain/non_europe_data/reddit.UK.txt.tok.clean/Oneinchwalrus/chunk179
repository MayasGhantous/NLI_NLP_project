  ysera is amazing in control v control matchups due to its value and added resources . 
  based on the cards you listed that you want , do you wan na make a fatigue/control warrior ? 
  ysera/grom/harrison / justicar/alex are all pretty necessary for control warrior , so it sounds like it 'd suit you . 
  great in control warrior for control mirrors . 
  it 's good against aggro decks . 
  in control mirrors it 's pretty bad i find . 
  you just get out-valued . 
  priest does n't normally need as many legendaries . 
  control warrior is really expensive . 
  if you decide to make a dragon priest then ysera works in both dragon priest and control warrior, 
   cars with one or more broken headlights/tail lights, 
  this really fucking bugs me . 
  you can flash someone with their fog lights on , and 99 % will turn them off . 
  you ca n't flash someone for only having one light and tell 'em to get it fixed . 
  you 'd think with justicar the deck would have just gotten better . 
  weird how these things work . 
  meh , when your deck has such great curve it 's bound to happen . 
  minibot , muster , shredder , loatheb , challenger , boom , tirion , win . 
  it 's a pretty great deck , so not too surprising . 
  any rogue arena deck that has backstabs and deadly poisons are probably gon na do well . 
  just found out i 'm off uni next week for study week . 
  also work has n't found out ( i only did this morning ) so i have next week off , and only two shifts in work . 
  bliss, 
  buy a small turtleneck and give it to him, 
  `` the gunners have been firing on all cylinders today ! '', 
  sigh, 
  tell that to commentators, 
  i noticed more people than usual carrying it out , but still like 70 % left it all, 
  ** carragher ** : you may not finish your career at barcelona . 
  when you get to 31 or 32 ( suarez is 29 now ) , would you like to come back to the premier league ? 
  or would you like to try the other leagues in europe ? 
  ** suarez ** : no . 
  i 'd prefer to stay here for many more years . 
  i know it does n't always turn out that way . 
  but if i had to return to the premier league , i would only go to liverpool . 
  i would n't go to another team . 
  it would n't be a move for money . 
  i 'd also love to play again for ajax as they allowed me to develop as a player in europe . 
  we can only dream ... 
  honestly , sounds like a dick move from both you . 
  going 20 in a 55 just sounds dangerous . 
  they got some cool thing here in the uk recently . 
  it 's like a camera on their car which auto checks you 're insured etc , i 'd imagine they get more info from it too, 
  what about a 1/3 for 1 , which gains +1 attack everytime you equip a weapon ? 
  kinda like wyrm . 
  harsh . 
  his goal scoring record was good . 
  his play was decent . 
  edit - what was the name of that young spanish centre mid that used to play for you 's ? 
  and if he was , it would n't be to barca . 
  they just do n't need him . 
  i 'm gon na put a bet on it happening . 
  ranieri is a bit of a ` sink or swim ' manager , if they lose some key players , along with the champions league and added expectations , you never know . 
  i 'll get good odds for it . 
  i 'd rather a stoner deliver drugs on a bike than a car to be fair, 
  i 've been seeing a surprising amount of face warrior recently . 
  arcanite reaper is annoying . 
  face warrior with coldlight oracles . 
  that was an odd match . 
  you might , but no one else in the cinema wants to hear your comments . 
  life of pi had a bad one . 
  yeah . 
  odd state of affairs when you want your opponent to entomb your * boom *, 
  it was in the deck list when it first came out ( the decklist i found ) . 
  i know there 's new listings without him , but he 's won me matches . 
  those channel five movies are fantastic i do n't care what you say . 
  at zebra crossings ? 
  i do . 
  speke is n't * really * liverpool, 
   ` murican liverpool fans are especially bad , they all claim to love the city and understand the culture of a place they 've never fucking set foot in . 
  claiming to hate everton despite never meeting an everton fan in the flesh or bantering with them at work . 
  there was a thread over on / r/liverpoolfc the other month , something like ` what prem team do n't you mind ? 
  ' , half the answers were everton . 
  i knew there were a lot of yank fans on there , but fuck me . 
  same . 
  it 's just fun on both sides of it . 
  it 's a difficult spot if you 're on ~ 10 cards , you could drop everything , but if he has vanish and you have no good deathrattles out you 're gon na have a bad time . 
  yeah , do wonder where his position in the team will be though . 
  since we have no wingers , if sturridge were hypothetically to stay fit , i 'd imagine him and firminho , with cou inbehind . 
  nah he 's not , he 's a good championship player . 
  yeah , his family love the place . 
  speaking of which , i still find it hilarious djibril cisse is the lord of the manor of frodsham, 
  same, 
  slows them down . 
   di canio at sunderland was odd , considering all the , you know , fascism and stuff . 
  and he was managing swindon in league 1 . 
  i could understand it maybe if he was a former player , and they wanted him to save them from relegation and get the crowd motivated . 
  very odd . 
  is it too early for marko grujic to be in consideration for the squad ? 
  [ well i just got confused ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/charly_musonda ), 
  well that 's egg on my face !, 
  going to wear my comment as a badge of shame, 
  to be fair , shearer played in some not-so-great squads . 
  well yeah , to be expected . 
  surprised watford are so low . 
  just defending in general . 
  on his way back to north wales !, 
  my paper round was decent . 
  done it from 14 until i was 18 , delivered about 220 papers , had to fold the leaflets too . 
  my pay depended on how many leaflets i had to fold , least i 'd get was ~ # 15 , most was about ~ # 22 .
