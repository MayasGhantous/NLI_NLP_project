  the sheens ? 
  the pheonix 's ? 
  who else ? 
  not sure they quite got their fact checks right . 
  why even mention that ? 
  they must know that 's not quite right ... 
  seen a load of people with flags and shouting things , but i could n't make out what they were saying ? 
  now obviously this is all subjective , but i was just bored looking through chris nolan 's directorial history , and i was surprised how few movies , he 's actually directed , but goddamn i ca n't spot a single bad movie in there . 
  the dark knight rises, 
  2010 inception, 
  2008 the dark knight, 
  2006 the prestige, 
  2005 batman begins, 
  1998 following, 
  thought up edgar wright , too . 
  ( excluding shorts because i 've not seen those ) . 
  who else ? 
  just curious , really . 
  i used to work in a call centre in liverpool , england . 
  it has quite a distinctive accent , and a lot of folks do n't like people from the area , i 've now discovered . 
  i had a call once , where as i picked up and read the opening script , someone went `` oh fuck off you scouse cunt '' . 
  this was an inbound call . 
  he called for advice and help , then says that ? 
  i had another one once , where , me being 18 at the time , someone refused to speak to me , and wanted to speak to someone older , presumably so they had more experience . 
  it was bizarre , because it was a call centre with a high turnover , and , without sounding stuck up , i was one of the better advisors . 
  you know , where they knock on their door constantly until someone answers . 
  the bloke just went into someone 's house without permission !, 
  if it was me , i 'd think someone was breaking in . 
  i know it 's the scum of the uk , but that 's just bizarre . 
  go on jeremy kyle high as fuck . 
  just rewatching season one , came across a weird bit i never remembered in episode 7 , where tig is telling clay what he likes about having sex with dead bodies . 
  anything you never picked up on , watching it first time ? 
  paying # 42 for a man to look at my car and say ` yep , that 's a car ' . 
  ca n't drive the bastard , because i need to wait for a logbook through now , which will take up to six weeks , and i had to get it insured to take it to the vic check !, 
  what a waste of money on insurance .

  27 ' - [ ] ( #icon - ball ), 
  ** goal !, 
  ** coutinho ever so slightly offside it seems , tried one for the near post , bounces out to markovic on the edge of the box , calmly side footed into the back of the net . 
  markovic with his first goal for liverpool !, 
  bournemouth 0 - 2 liverpool, 
  27 ' - great chance for bournemouth spurned !,

  looked to be going into the back of the net . 
  41 ' - francis momentarily forgets which sport he 's playing as he tries a conversion out wide . 
  44 ' - lallana fouls smith on the edge of the box . 
  chance for bournemouth . 
  stanislas to take , but skrtel clears it for a corner .
