  mamadou sakho replacing dejan lovren, 
  48 ' - found out somebody is hording snickers in my kitchen cupboard . 
  50 ' - [ ] ( #icon - ball ), 
  ** goal !, 
  cargill has taken off his bandana , immediately afterwards sterling jinks in and out of the defender , before slotting it in the far side of the goal . 
  clearly his power was in the bandana . 
  bournemouth 0 - 3 liverpool, 
  52 ' - [ ] ( #icon - sub ) ** double substitution **, 
  stanislas is replaced by ryan fraser , and kermergant is replaced by midfielder harry arter .

  56 ' - [ ] ( #icon - ball ), 
  ** goal !, 
  ritchie does well on the right hand side , gosling given far , far too much room in the box and squeezes it through jones . 
  game on !, 
  bournemouth 1 - 3 liverpool, 
  60 ' - fraser is ushered out of play by kolo toure . 
  the search for the ball is over , but the search for fraser 's neck will clearly be in vain . 
  63 ' - liverpool continuing to try to play it out from defence , despite the fact none of the centre halves can pass it , and jones could n't kick a bag of potatoes . 
  64 ' - chance for bournemouth !, 
  ritchie 's header just falls the wrong side of the goal , and wilson just could n't get to it in time . 
  65 ' - spurs lead newcastle 3-0 , harry ` alan shearer ' kane has scored the third . 
  66 ' - coutinho and lallana link up to give sterling a great chance , but the finish is poor , as he drags it wide of the near post . 
  69 ' - great double chance for bournemouth !, 
  gosling hits the post , it is eventually cleared , the ball is played back into the box with ritchie , his strikes it across goal , but nobody was there to pop it home . 
  72 ' - defensive frailty is back in liverpool 's defence . 
  in trying to pass it around and kill the bournemouth tempo , they just decide to pass it out of play . 
  73 ' - [ ] ( #icon - sub ) ** substitution **, 
  coutinho is replaced by emre ` tank ' can . 
  80 ' - [ ] ( #icon - sub ) ** substitution **, 
  o'kane replaced by the man , who , the commentators seem to want to constantly remind everybody is from jersey , brett pitman . 
  83 ' - the drummer must have left the match early , not heard him for a while . 
  either that or he passed out . 
  85 ' - matt ritchie should do a sterling and cut his hair . 
  looks like an overused toilet brush . 
  86 ' - the forgotten man fabio borini is warming up , ready to come on . 
  87 ' - can gets bored of defending and pushes over the bournemouth winger . 
  88 ' - opportunity for cargill , from a cross by fraser , but his header is tame and right to jones . 
  89 ' - [ ] ( #icon - sub ) ** substitution **, 
  fabio borini , the man who 's wife , according to her twitter , really does n't like borini not playing , replaces steven gerrard . 
  92 ' - looks like rodgers will have a peaceful nights sleep tonight .

  a few i love ; zodiac , gone baby gone , gone girl , se7en , mystic river et al. 
  cheers !, 
  just the intro made my skin crawl , especially being from cheshire . 
  sat stationary for a few hours in a big box shatters me , but going to uni , or even lazing about my house does n't tire me out like driving . 
  seriously . 
  i can handle a godly sniper , or archer , that 's fair enough , they 've got some talent . 
  but nothing makes me throw my controller more than some dick smoking & shivving me . 
  how op is smoke !, 
  pricks . 
  argh . 
  thought it looked interesting , but i do n't have sky atlantic , so i wo n't get around to it for a while . 
  heard it 's a bit like twin peaks , is it ?

  feature-length opening episode of the thriller , starring stanley tucci , sofie grabol , richard dormer , michael gambon and christopher eccleston,

  all i can think of right now is jim 's dad from american pie .

  synopsis coming soon ... 
  air date ; 19/02/15, 
   dan and frank travel up the coast in search of a suspect ; dan 's feelings for elena threaten to overwhelm him . 
  what changes would there be to everyday life ? 
  jobs ? 
  would the world be better ? 
  seriously , how different would the world be for those days ? 
  going into work and there being absolutely no women ? 
  air date ; 26/02/2015, 
  everyone is a suspect in the murder of charlie stoddard , especially frank and elena . 
  the sheriff seems to have some emotional tie to elena/esmerelda , and the truth soon comes to light : she spent 7 years in prison for killing an ex-boyfriend who abused her during their relationship , and the sheriff handles her case to the extent of providing her with a new identity . 
  only recently came out , i went to see it last night and i was pleasantly surprised by it . 
  despite the name , and the fact it 's a low budget horror , i actually found it quite creepy , it really builds on your paranoia , and does n't rely on jump scares .
