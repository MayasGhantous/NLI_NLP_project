  bit lucky with the deflection , but still a decent bit of play from him, 
  honestly , i would n't say sherlock is as big in britain as it is in america , which is very odd . 
  but i hardly hear people talk about it much here at all . 
  i always thought patrick stewart 's voice would be wonderful for documentaries . 
  where you too busy smoking to eat pears ? 
  yeah i thought that , but as long as he has a script or something it 'd be fine, 
  he has one kid . 
  one . 
  the other claims were fake . 
  moot point , but holden plays in the championship, 
  not really , i think it 'll be like that on the outside of / r/teenagers too . 
  is n't it mandatory to stay in school until 18 now ? 
  hi bill !, 
  welcome !, 
  love for you to do an ama sometime , you 're a big hero of all us here . 
  i do them naturally , and i ducking hate it because i 'm unable to control them . 
  it essentially involves my mum trying to kill me and being chased by a bloke in drag . 
  terrifying stuff . 
  green mile , the perks of being a wallflower , happiness , hachi etc. 
  that was the most frustrating gif i 've ever seen . 
  i 'm curious what udinese will choose to do with him in the summer, 
  few times i 've seen him for palace he 's been better than zaha , but as i say , i 've not seen him too much, 
  american beauty .

   and most importantly black . 
   ** dawg ** sfan1,

  i got too scared and closed the browser immediately . 
  i do n't have it in me to look any more, 
  bloody heck , you left it what , 2 days before making this thread after the last one ? 
  my mind was blown that you call it clue over there . 
  film proved what a great actor will smith is , and that he 's not just a comedy actor . 
  the world 's biggest industry is the bleaching of paper, 
  it has a lot of springs , volcanic activity etc. 
  as opposed to a real dead one ? 
  i want to fill a bag of m&m 's with skittles and surprise the fuck out of someone . 
  tobias ? 
  hope so . 
  the tory backbenchers only appear when something about gay marriage is mentioned . 
  the current government is a big one ( uk ), 
  the daily mail and the sun , too .

  as an englishman , i 'm not the biggest fan of the monarchy , but i also do sort of hope we keep it . 
  it 's culturally quite a big thing for us , and provides a fair bit of tourism . 
  we 'd be a different place the day we lose our monarchy . 
  which probably wo n't happen i 'd say , with such a majority voting for it , they 'll look like plebs if they reject it, 
  really out of proportionate votes of those rejecting it are tories . 
  so does my * sixth form * ... 
  to be fair , as far as holocaust films go , that 's * one of the happier ones *, 
  my local mp for halton voted against . 
  he 's a labour supporter too . 
  never did like him , definitely not getting my vote now . 
  well my college has an email system , which is a good function , but the problem is you ca n't even use your emails on the app !, 
  it 's just for looking at ` news ' , ` message of the day ' , and shit like that, 
  which just means he 's against it , but worried about his position . 
  slimy , slimy politicans, 
  mine 's a labour mp and voted against . 
  he 's always been a bellend though . 
  oh yes we are !, 
  can tell we 're northern , since we 're getting f-d up the arse by the tories . 
  we 're very close to preston though !, 
  i can get there in half hour , since half my family live there , i do quite often !, 
  typical lancashire elitism ... :p hahaha, 
  trim , do n't shave . 
  some people find it really itchy to shave . 
  he could summon cthulu, 
  i 've shaved a few times , it 's never itched . 
  it just looks a bit odd . 
  i 'd be careful with him !, 
  ca n't trust that lot !, 
  it 's also in film version , which i watched . 
  bloody good film actually . 
  shame i did n't read the book prior . 
  aye , when you buy the s * n you 're funding that terrible , terrible corporation and murdoch gets his jollies . 
  at least in the metro you 're not doing so , it 's arriva and bus stations that are, 
  that 's quite the stat !, 
  odd stuff . 
  macheda 's goal against villa . 
  jagermeister . 
  the night i drunk that , is the only drunken time i 've ever had which i ca n't remember . 
  this thread got dark quickly,

  sarah millican, 
  as much shit as they get , and their pricing is horrible , but damn , their drinks do taste nice . 
  it 's annoying , because if anyone graffiti 'd over it , and got caught they 'd be done . 
  mine in the north west was a secondary school, 
  essentially the government cut most aspects of society which affect the poor , disabled , and essentially everybody other than themselves . 
  raised tuition fees from about 3k to 9/10k which will , personally affect me massively . 
  cutting ema ( money for certain people whose parents are low earners during 16-18 in school ) which is vitally important for a lot of students .
