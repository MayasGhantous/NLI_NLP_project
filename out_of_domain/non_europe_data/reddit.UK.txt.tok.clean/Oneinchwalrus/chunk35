  is n't mourinho leaving at the end of the year ? 
  the problem for me , is what seriously happens between 16-18 to make people so much more politically ready, 
  marx 's communism has never been actually tried how he actually wanted it to be , in its truest form . 
  missed 68 this time !, 
  not that bad as usual !, 
  chavs look a bit more twatty , actually . 
  believe it or not . 
  have i got news for you , would i lie to you , who 's line is it anyway , a question of sport , another few i can think of . 
  ( though , i would not recommend celebrity juice ; fucking keith lemon , man ), 
  guinness of course . 
  no because it 'd be illegal to join anything like that pre-18 . 
  facebook , or social networks are your best bet if you really care that much, 
  much more harmful drugs . 
  and then the biggest thing you can do to your health ; die . 
  fucking hell guys , it 's only smoking , if op wants to do n't get so pissy . 
  i shop at asda . 
  why ? 
  no better alternatives . 
  with 10 % discount and it being the closest supermarket , not really, 
  i 'll give it until tuesday when it 's gone out my system , 
  it 's on a sunday though , so to make up for it i 'm having a two/three day binge on guinness over the weekend !, 
  i find it amazing when people said ronaldo should win it because messi has won the last few . 
  that 's just stupid reasoning, 
  this is a good one , they certainly do n't hold back on money . 
  look at alexis , song , alba , mascherano , villa , ibra , that ukrainian centre half , fabregas . 
  how many of those can you say were value for money ? 
  mascherano , alba , villa , and to a degree fabregas , but the others ? 
  was n't amazon at one point , selling a book detailing how to be an effective paedophile ? 
  can only worry what type of list people who bought that would be on ... 
  i sucked it up and googled it for the sake of reddit , http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-11731928, 
  ( if i go missing from reddit , remember me ), 
   you 're less likely to get nauseous when you do n't drink more than 2 or 3 different kinds of alcoholic drinks, 
  this is one moral i can not adhere to !, 
  it gets dull to keep drinking the same thing, 
  getting drunk is fun , though . 
  it does n't suck for me , it 's quite a lot of fun and is a great socialising time . 
  metro have reported it to be fair . 
  though they do n't sell papers ... but still ... 
  he was n't reelected immediately because he took it for granted he would be , because he 's the man who ` won the war ' , and like lloyd george in ww1 , thought it 'd be a landslide victory . 
  so the tories put little effort into their campaign , then labour won . 
  yup . 
  i do n't like that man , not one bit . 
  he comes across as a smug so-and-so , constantly moaning , but he has n't half put a good team together . 
  do n't get me wrong , in the transfer market he 's been pretty poor , but his man management seems great . 
  look what happened to charlton when they got rid of curbishley, 
  i love all the paranormal , unexplained experiences threads which crop up every month or so, 
  you know what to do , my son ... 
  same :( i tried to make it edgy , too , http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/19hhhq/does_anyone_have_any_pleasant_experiences_with/, 
  hsm was the baddest type of shit when it came out when i was 11 , but i seen it like three years later and jesus is it awful, 
  ca n't see lloris being in the team . 
  he 's not been their regular for that long . 
  begovic , perhaps ? 
  they were miming it all anyway ... 
  no we 're not . 
  have fun !, 
  yes , i remember those !, 
  the guy who nearly who thinks he nearly got took done an ama at some point , though it may not have been gacy , but another famous killer, 
  am i the only one who finds the whole ` nerdfighters ' hideously cringe-worthy ? 
  it 's like how it 's now cool and trendy to call yourself a nerd, 
  john green fans ? 
  firefly, 
  he , too , has been poor when played . 
  do n't get me wrong , he 's no played too much , but still poor . 
  and he 's not a ` footballing ' player anyway . 
  a good scissor kick and he 's suddenly a great footballer ? 
  he 's really not . 
  and when you 're talking about him being a rock , do you remember what happened in that qpr match by any chance ? 
  not city ? 
  quite a few !, 
  suso , ibe , sterling , mclaughlin , et al, 
  hershey 's chocolate tastes awful , though !, 
  add another 20 million onto that , and take away giovinco . 
  for both of them , that would cost over 100 million ? 
  you say that like united 's team are angelic saints, 
  reminds me of last year , i was 16 at the time walking to the bus stop outside a shop , some kid in school clothes , probably only a year younger than me , came up and asked me to go in the shop for them . 
  i said i was only 16 , and she stared at me in disgust , then said `` i 'm 18 , i just have no id '' . 
  she was in her school clothes . 
  maybe . 
  brand new , sotd are there , but the rest are a bit meh . 
  it 's impressive you can still use that site despite the constant videos autoplaying, 
  `` like a more liberal 4chan with slightly less mentions of being called a nigger '', 
  finishing third on the x-factor does n't mean they 're talented , though . 
  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq49gv3wfb0 this guy lasted ** eight ** weeks . 
  do n't forget jedward , too . 
  false . 
  doctors do not get paid the same as garbagemen . 
  all doctors , nurses , etc get paid the same , whilst all garbage men , and disposing people get paid their own wage . 
  i 'm not op , but i 'll give it a crack . 
  basically , the foundation of communism is equality , and evenness throughout society . 
  however , as humans are naturally greedy , and want possessions , it is a bit hopeful that they would abide to the idea of selfishness and not become so interested by material goods . 
  the idea of communism , is everyone is equal . 
  however , to make everyone equal , it needs a government to make everyone equal , therefore it becomes no longer equal as the government will live in luxurious mansions and be minted , so it 's not truly a selfless society , as they 're not all equal . 
  like in a capitalist state , a small % will own a large % of the wealth . 
  if you 're really interested , give animal farm by george orwell a read , it 'll explain a lot of your questions . 
  well in a proper ** real ** communist state , there would be no wages at all , people work for the good of the state . 
  everyone gets what they need without paying according to their needs . 
  but of course , that 's in an ideal world . 
  changing that system mentioned is much easier said than done . 
  the first generation of people in which this change would happen would not end well . 
  i wish communism would work , i honestly do , but i can not see it .
