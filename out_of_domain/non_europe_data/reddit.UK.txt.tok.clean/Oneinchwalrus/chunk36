  maybe a government is not needed , but a body to organise the food , and materials and hand them out , is . 
  i dunno , i 'd say ryan giggs systematically cheating on his brothers ' wife and ruining their marriage is pretty fucking awful . 
  a single , momentary act of racism is worse than a long term affair on your brother 's wife ? 
  i do n't really care unless as long as you 're not in a popular aisle, 
  gerrard now-a-days is much more of a central midfielder , who does all sorts all around the pitch , whilst lucas very scarcely makes any sort of run forwards , he 's mainly the defensive cover . 
  allen 's apparent primary position is basically pushing up , hussling , getting it , running few yards and laying it off . 
  so kind of neither gerrard or lucas ' position , sort of his own . 
  though you 're correct , henderson is picked over allen because he 's been much , much better all year, 
  of all players ; hulk ? 
  ** stop **, 
  birmingham, 
  weeeooooeeeooooeeeoo, 
  hardly breaking news ... 
  that is * slightly * more than the falklands, 
   this pretty much confirms how much of a sausage fest the internet is, 
  ftfy, 
   the memes on this subreddit are too damn high, 
  ftfy, 
  `` hello dear people !, 
  open letter, 
  i 'm not sure what has prompted the sudden spree of comments about reddit , so i thought i would clear up a few things . 
  this page was created as there was no facebook page for british people problems - which i simply could not understand !, 
  i thought it would be fun to put some of the best statuses from reddit on facebook for those of you on here . 
  the page works in three ways ( for those of you really , really interested ! -, 
  1 ) i put a few of my own statuses from up inside my own little head , but they 're not so often , as i 'm not that interesting . 
  2 ) as clearly stated in the description of the group - i take highlights of the best statuses from reddit - as is the main purpose of the page . 
  this has been in the description since the page has been created . 
  3 ) i take inbox problems , and put them on the page , usually about half of the time , but it 's a little less currently as i 'm so busy . 
  i currently have 85 from you , sitting in my inbox - you agitated lot , 
  and for those of you that really , really care , i did consider putting reddit in the title of the page - something like `` british people problems - reddit edition for facebook '' . 
  the main reason this was not done - and i 'm not arrogant enough to suppose reddit care about a little fb page - i did not want to clash with an official page , had they decided to put one on facebook . 
  reasons such as legality issues from me not having permission to use their name , claiming it is official when it is more of a fan page , and misleading people , but mainly , it 's just a huge pain in the arse having to change a pages name and description when building a fan base as people get confused and a whole lot more work has to put into the page in its running etc etc. 
  aaaaaanyway , i know a good percentage of you stopped reading about two sentences in to this massively boring status ! - but i wish you a beautiful saturday wherever you are and i look forward to reading more about your peculiarities and rage issues . 
  sincerely ,, 
  british people problems . '', 
  from that page . 
  bastards . 
  my dad met bill shankly once :(, 
  i hope they post op 's, 
  well that really breaks my crayons, 
  andrew lincoln from the walking dead , too, 
  250 films ( quite a nice number ) and a fair 700-odd gb, 
  and a damn good player , a real hard worker and a menace to play against . 
  does n't half commit some fouls , though, 
  fired because he was gay ? 
  gosh . 
  do you live in america ? 
  i had a few gay teachers in my secondary school across the pond, 
  * not * fire them ? 
  bad move by suarez , no excuses etc. 
  should be banned , really . 
  however , i do think there should be more action faced by players for holding players during set pieces . 
  it 's just stupidly common now , and just expected and allowed by ref 's . 
  it must suck when they get the munchies, 
  ben howard , enter shikari , ** smashing pumpkins ** , would be good , though , despite the meh main three headliners . 
  never seen that , it 's always white lightning here, 
  riise went off the boil in 2007 , surprised he 's still making it in the premier league to be honest . 
  ah , my apologies , did n't know that . 
  only seen this bit posted on tumblr, 
  no it does n't . 
  no , they ` cry ' that he did n't play well * for us * , not that he * is n't * a good player, 
  or rather , for signing him in the first place as he did n't fit into the midfield . 
  i do !, 
  i 've always been one of the hairier people of my age group , and i can grow a pretty killer beard , just no ` stache which is a shame . 
  if he was , he would n't be rb for spain and madrid . 
  admittedly competition in those places is lacking , but shite ? 
  this . 
  some sad bugar has been going through here downvoting everyone . 
  to answer op ; the killer inside me was a bit weird . 
  very late to the party , but ; league of legends . 
  only played about 5 matches , all ai vs bots , and not doing so well . 
  but i am quite enjoying it , but ca n't really see how people get so addicted to it , yet . 
  happiness !, 
  i would n't blame him * that much * for wanting to leave the show, 
  that makes sense . 
  fuck , now i 'm pissed too . 
  tea , doctor who , jeremy kyle , full english breakfasts , and free health care . 
  i could live like that, 
  he 's already 45 . 
  of course , time to mature , but he 's not some young kid !, 
  -5 for me ... 
  great , now i 'll need to buy a 3ds for luigi 's mansion 2, 
  i did try clicking them , then into the room but it did n't seem to work still . 
  i 'm not quite sure what i 've done wrong , because other rooms work fine , but these 5 or so are like ghost cells :(, 
  oh sweet fuck no . 
  never mind , the save itself has corrupted or something and disappeared , so i guess problem resolved . 
  thanks for the interest guys !, 
  hi darling < 3, 
  dunharrow was unbelievably difficult . 
  the last bit , where you 're running out of there in a time limit reduced me to tears on co-op, 
  thought it was neil buchanan at first http://images.wikia.com/sooty/images/a/a2/neilbuchanan.jpg, 
  is it true what they say about manchester - the sun has never been seen ? 
  haha , i kid , of course . 
  i 've been to manchester . 
  it 's definitely true . 
  pounds , not euros * . 
  that 'll be about 15 $ though i do believe . 
  wally 's an insult a toddler here in the uk would use , but it does n't mean willy though . 
  was n't he in the metal band prior to art attack ? 
  plus i have him on facebook ...
