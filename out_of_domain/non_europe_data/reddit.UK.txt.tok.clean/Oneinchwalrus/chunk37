  if it was a * real * person whom died , perhaps . 
  i apologise . 
  i 'm rewatching season 1 , and gosh , glenn 's grown up so much since then !, 
  he almost sounds prepubescent when we first see him . 
  this bit was cut out last time it was on tv here . 
  pissed me right off , it started at like 10:30 on itv , and they cut out the word cunt ?!, 
  bollocks !, 
  now in . gif form http://25.media.tumblr.com/a2dcf4e0a5610224f5f9571abec6d21c/tumblr_mkquytrzcx1r0gdz1o1_500.gif, 
  maybe then we 'd get cadbury back , so it would n't taste like arse anymore !, 
  none of that kraft shite . 
  but if china , or someone went under too , that 'd affect everyone , yet we do n't hear about their trials & tribulations with other countries . 
  us/nk news has been over here a tad , as too much us news normally does over here , but give them a break for not being massively up-to-date on the situation , as i can bet you they probably know a fair bit more than probably a lot of americans . 
  tl ; dr if anyone goes under , it 'd affect a lot of other countries , but they 'd survive . 
  how do you motivate yourself , arnold ? 
  i was at that match, 
  i seen you, 
  * probably *, 
  any match , does n't matter really :p, 
  shadows of the damned does a terrific job of humour . 
  some of them are cheap laughs , but they work because of the dark , odd place it 's set in . 
  i 'm not sure how many people have played it ; but it 's a terrific game , and one i 'd definitely recommend . 
  especially the johnson rap . 
  two for me . 
  one , ** defiance ** . 
  got it on xbox , really quite enjoying it . 
  as far as mmo 's go on consoles , this one is for the record books . 
  really has a borderlands feel to it , except with millions of randomers driving about on mopeds . 
  story seems a bit lax , but i think it might improve when the show begins too . 
  second , is ** prison architect ** . 
  real fun game !, 
  frustrating beyond belief trying to get your prison working , without them escaping and that though . 
  the interface , ability to see what your prisoners ' charges , what they pleaded etc was really nice . 
  still in alpha too . 
  most of it is just fishing for compliments . 
  i mean i know plenty of people deemed attractive can have inferiority complexes , but not * that * many . 
  i got mentioned there once too !, 
  oddly proud , i 'll try get there again . 
  it 's not always on at the same time though , i think . 
  last few weeks have fell at a good time to me , but the few before that were always on a friday when i was in bed , now it 's more on a saturday afternoon . 
  agreed though , think it 'd be fairer with more change . 
  but most religious idols are just like this , not just jesus . 
  that 's why the core basics of most religions are fine , but it 's how interpretation ruins their good name , with people going off and claiming things in the name of a religion , which is stupidly far from the word of the religion . 
   the uk, 
  ftfy, 
  dead . 
  ( let 's be honest . ), 
  million voices by otto knows ? 
  and she was just a plain old cunt too . 
  i like his music , he 's a pretty great musician . 
  very outspoken about his views , but meh , what he says does n't make much a difference anyway , he 's not in a real position of power . 
  63 upvotes , 63 down . 
  bravo . 
  feel free then to make your own thread about the differences between your country , and other ones . 
  no one is stopping you . 
  though i prefer show hershel to comic hershel, 
  `` we 're gon na have a party , cos maggie thatcher 's dead '' chant . 
  in case anyone 's curious , it 's not really a spoiler . 
  it 's from near the start of the comics , and was covered in season 2 . 
  really ? 
  it looks identical to the bit when carl gets shot by otis, 
  it could be , but i think most people watching the show will be past the first part of season two . 
  no it 's common knowledge . 
  it wo n't be the case , though , i really could n't see that happening . 
  it has millwall fans all over it , it 's how they usually are . 
  what happened to him ? 
  she was in charge , and helped to cover up the disaster . 
  that , and she thought of liverpool as a city not worth helping , she helped implement stop and searches , where literally anyone would be stopped by the police and searched for no apparent reason . 
  she hated liverpool , and clamped down on it , and helped to fuck it up . 
  the whole stop and search thing really got on peoples tits , as you could imagine , and the toxteth riots ( which happened nearly ten year prior to hillsborough ) etc etc. 
  do you not have that phrase in boston ?!, 
  gosh !, 
  thought it was a common thing throughout the uk . 
  no wonder you do n't know much about liverpool and thatcher , not knowing that phrase , people in boston must live in their own little bubble =p, 
  did n't think about that actually , just assumed he meant boston in the uk because of the subreddit, 
  this makes more sense, 
  heck no !, 
  i wo n't hide from my mistakes !, 
  i 'm a proud , independent black woman who do n't need no dodging . 
  yeah , that too !, 
  i 'm not the most knowledgeable about thatcher 's influence in liverpool , since i was born a bit after her time , so apologies for missing stuff out ^ ^, 
  time 's ko ? 
  cheers guys . 
  it 's on espn for anyone in the uk guys !, 
  definitely this . 
  telling your folks will just be bad , they could be angry at her and confront her about it and make it even worse . 
  talk to her about it yourself , do n't condescend her , be supportive and help her . 
   utopian, 
   killing off people, 
   force people, 
   utopian, 
   ** utopian **, 
   *** utopian ***, 
  socialism . 
  in the uk , none of the major parties represent my views , even the major left leaning party are too conservative for my likings , lack of working class representation in british politics . 
  is this that totallyedgyfunnyguy who has some crappy facebook page or something ? 
  beautiful mate , beautiful . 
  ( i also know your plight , i sometimes shave down there to try keep it from sticking ), 
  mate you need to go to liverpool sometime , it 'll be a whole new experience for you . 
  you 'll be terrified of everyone there , then when you talk to them they 'll be the loveliest people you 'll ever speak to, 
  no no , i was stalking you i 'm holding no false pretences,
