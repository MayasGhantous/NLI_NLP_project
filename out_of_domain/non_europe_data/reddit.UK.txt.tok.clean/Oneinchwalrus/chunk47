  why would you make friends by the criteria they share your religion ? 
  you looked a bit like robert baratheon in the first picture, 
  great work !,

  cultural differences . 
  most places people do n't find tipping necessary , like where i live . 
  if there 's an exceptionally good thing about the service , sure , i guess . 
  but i would n't call someone a dick for not tipping someone , even they spent $ 500 . 
  pretty sure the young fans did n't like it so much, 
  ** stop ** . 
  on the negative side of that , his description of food would be loads more than it already is, 
  the video is banned in your country . 
  i live in england !, 
  the country where this show was made !, 
  what fresh madness is this, 
  bloody heck , you guys . 
  oh you guys . 
  mate *, 
  ** stop **, 
  same for jeremy kyle this morning . 
  it was ridiculous !, 
  you 'd think they 'd talked enough about the little buggar on gmtv or whatever it 's called now, 
  i 've seen hundreds of horror films , i 'd say the best i 've seen are ... 
  session 9 , event horizon , 1408 , insidious , it , and paranormal activity for pure shock value first time around , if you know nothing of it, 
  it means we need to tell suarez someone has bid , it 's not a release clause, 
  i 'd trust the echo to be honest , they 're spot on with liverpool stuff, 
  if arsenal were to agree a fee , chances are madrid would come straight in with the same fee , anyway, 
  i 've had it twice , but both my times were very tame compared to what most people seem to . 
  basically i was lying in bed , and i watched qi before bed , next second i was awake and my tv was off . 
  tried to move , could n't , kept trying , no luck . 
  i was pretty terrified , i wanted to scream for my parents , but i could n't . 
  i tried everything possible to move , or to scream , but nothing ; just pure blackness in my room , no light from anything . 
  next second i woke up , qi was on my tv and i was fucking terrified . 
  on this one , they skipped the entire scene from the first episode in the hotel room with the loofa, 
  why are you such a bellend ? 
  brynden tully as lord commander , kingslayer , syrio forel , ser loras , barristan , greatjon , ned stark, 
  i prefer loyalty over pure strength i guess , looking over that list . 
  tried it , for a while i 'd smoke when drunk , but it just lost its appeal very quickly . 
  still think renly would have made a good king . 
  he had the ` ned effect ' were men loved to serve him , he was just a loved guy , and in the book , at least , seemed very competent . 
  he 'd have done it eventually though , close his eyes and gurd his loins , type deal, 
  got mine yesterday too , it really is very fun . 
  got to day 11 last night , soundtrack 's beautiful and so are the graphics . 
  very impressed . 
  have to say i did n't like this film , thought they built up a lot of the creepiness , then just ended it when it got a bit actually scary . 
  it 's really good so far . 
  i 'd be much more ok about it should it be city , as they 're going to be one of the top teams for ages , no matter how much we improve , plus we 'd get a sexy fee from them , but not le arse . 
  you can stick around but you must accept our constant teases and jokes about your bad half, 
  it 's also worth noting we had our hands tied , with no foreign team interested , so had to sell to chelsea or keep him another half a year . 
  we 're not saying we 're not going to sell suarez , but just not to a rival .

  oh bad move , never criticise stannis on / r/asoif it 'll only end badly, 
  benjen is clearly strong belwas . 
  but seriously , i 'm of the opinion that he is probably dead somewhere . 
  seems a bit typical grrm to let everyone big up benjen and what he 's up to , when he 'll just be a wight or something somewhere , possibly in the prologue ( was n't it confirmed there 'll be a chapter in the ` land of eternal winter ' or whatever it 's called ? ), 
  refer to ; http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/search?q=benjen&amp;restrict_sr=on for more information . 
  which is an amazing film , too , by the way, 
  shows that drag on too long get worse and worse , generally . 
  it crowd stopped whilst on top . 
  i always thought the last series of the it crowd was worse by a fair bit than the first few , so im glad they ended personally, 
  just after christmas i think . 
  it was snowing , so that 's a bit of an easy way to remember . 
  riise post '07 was poor , aurelio was better , though injury prone . 
  torres ' form dipped greatly in his last season , babel was crap , riera hit a youth player , and masch wanted to leave . 
  do n't get me wrong , we replaced them poorly , but it 's not as easy as you suggested, 
  rafa made poor signings , but most of his were great . 
  sorry , just do n't buy your post . 
  voronin was free , morientes was a flop , garcia was quality , dossena was poor , babel too , pennant was good at first , and n'gog we made a profit on . 
  you forgot to mention some of the other players ; mascherano , alonso , torres , arbeloa , skrtel , agger , reina , et al. 
  from 2007 onwards , he was running on a ` sell to buy ' programme mainly , and it was just difficult for him to strengthen the squad by having to sell first . 
  johnson was a lot at 18 million , but i 'd rather us pay an extra ten million on top of what we paid for dossena to get someone of actually quality , who 's been our first choice for the last four odd years, 
  asda 's not a place i 'd go to buy games , good for food and drink , but i only look at the media if i 'm bored . 
  it 'd mean david luiz , would n't it ? 
  3 million apparently , too . 
  eh , i love dagger , but they probably do better, 
  we 're not going to get the top 4 this season unless we sign two players of a high quality , which is incredibly unlikely . 
  as it is , i think we 've signed some decent players , but not enough to push us ahead of spurs . 
  a commanding centre half , a back up left back , a goalscorer ( whether it be a midfielder or striker , or am ), 
  those amazing christmas time turkey stuffing walkers . 
  oh my god, 
  well he went to speak to renly to try persuade him to join him , instead he insulted him a bit ( renly and his peach !, 
  ) , and from then on i think he was dead to him . 
  there were loads of usurpers in the eyes of stannis who needed defeating , renly at this point was pretty much dead to him . 
  so brave . 
  asos and affc for me had quite a lot of errors , just sort of casual ones every so often . 
  did kind of annoy me though . 
  question to anyone who knows ; when grrm talks about stannis , who always puts '' stannis 's '' instead of the correct `` stannis ' '' . 
  why does he do that ? 
  i 'm trying to get into blacksmithing and bee keeping in a few years . 
  sounds fun . 
  same , but i think that was because joffrey 's , tywin and the rw had all been spoiled for me , but i really did n't see lysa 's death coming , same with the epilogue, 
  he 's loyal , but i still think he 'd probably join barca , because our transfer committee would see an offer of 20 odd million and decide to sell , unfortunately . 
  we nearly sold him last summer , remember ? 
  he 's a great player and guy , and our manager likes him , but should a high offer come in , i do n't see him thinking about it . 
  he could well turn into an england starter if it goes correctly for him . 
  he 's very technically good , can score some great goals too .
