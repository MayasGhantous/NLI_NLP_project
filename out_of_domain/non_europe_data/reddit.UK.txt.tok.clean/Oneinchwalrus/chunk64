  it felt rushed , it was a big mess . 
  they thrown in all enemies possible , and the regeneration felt especially rushed . 
  sort of like , we 'll spend the episode on matt smith , then make him regen at the last possible second then end it . 
  check your pm 's ... 
  you get used to it . 
  most of the names are n't important . 
  skrtel 's a liability . 
  ref 's a cunt . 
  defence is crap . 
  not sure i agree , our defence was woeful . 
  do n't know what 's gotten into johnson lately , but he 's been really out of form . 
  skrtel 's not as good as people are claiming he is this season . 
  sakho played well until those mistakes , and cissokho 's a huge liability who actually played better today than he has before . 
  ref really fucked up . 
  the sterling call , and all the shirt tugging , then when suarez was taken out by lescott . 
  six points youve got now , against us and arsenal that you should n't have . 
  skrtel did n't even look at the ball , or jump . 
  he just tried to stop kompany . 
  he 's so poor at set pieces . 
  i like sakho , even if he had a poor second half . 
  cissokho and johnson offered nothing . 
  johnson 's been way out of form for ages now . 
  we just ca n't cope set pieces . 
  well , not that you should n't have , you played well both matches , but just got a lot of help from the officials . 
  in the end , our lack of changes who can affect the game cost us . 
  from the bench we had aspas , who has barely played , and moses , who quite frankly has been woeful for us . 
  hope we strengthen in january if we actually want to finish top four . 
  full back , centre mid who can score , and a good winger would n't go amiss . 
  he 's doing well , but a nomination for young sports person of the year or whatever it was , was just ridiculous . 
  not a controversial opinion . 
  really ? 
  bit different here . 
  it seems hot fuzz/sotd are always on tele here so i imagine twe will be in a few years, 
  til americans do n't have christmas crackers . 
  he done an ama once . 
  true . 
  but i think ** most ** of the top 25 or so are deserved , i think tssr should be about 25th , personally . 
  saying that , i 'd have american beauty top , and that 's not even in the top 50 !, 
  film 's decent as far as book to movie films go , but i 'd say the book is still far better than the film, 
  by must-see i 'd assume you want films which could change your life , with that in mind ; ** american beauty ** . 
  in my opinion the closest to perfect movie i 've seen , everytime i see it i pick up on new things . 
  wonderfully directed , acted , wrote , with a killer soundtrack , and it 'll just make you feel good , and a bit sad at the same time . 
  i dunno , i think if you got the idea whilst watching it of the fascist undertone you realise it 's a bit tongue-in-cheek and ` typical on purpose ', 
  the first movie is easily the best , though . 
  that film could even make kevin bacon look average at best . 
  `` they 're in the god damn ground ! '', 
  that scene where the couple get savaged and the car gets stuck in the floor remains quite possibly the worst acted scene of all time . 
  soundtrack made ` sunshine ' . 
  not bad . 
  seems to split opinions , but even if you did n't enjoy it , it 's far from some of the other films in this thread like ` troll 2 ' . 
  drive was a cinematic masterpiece to be honest . 
  compared to a lot of game movies , it 's decent . 
  the sequel was awful though . 
  the first had the sh feel to it , the second did not . 
  at all . 
  i just think it 's beautiful , in a sentence . 
  there are so many small references throughout about plato 's cave , which is basically what it 's about . 
  the soundtrack , directing , and casting were spot on , not just with kevin spacey , but the teens cast , in particular . 
  whenever i watch it , it just makes me feel happy , i first seen it when i was depressed and the speech at the end , in particular , ` it 's hard to be mad when there 's so much beauty in the world ' , ' i ca n't help but feel gratitude , for every single moment of my stupid little life ' . 
  there 's only been a handful of movies which made me feel what ab made me feel . 
  the most worrying part of it is that he does n't seem arsed . 
  when he lost it , he barely tracked back to win it back , he just jogged . 
  he 'll be good at west brom , and keep them up , whilst cardiff will probably go down . 
  op , if you 're just through asos , tagging it ` all spoilers ' is n't a great idea . 
  he looks like how andy carroll looked here . 
  like someone who should n't play football , he just looks so clumsy, 
  to be fair , aspas was cheap , and has been injured most of the season . 
  he 's a far better player than that mong moses, 
  once i got a qui gon jinn lego man in a christmas cracker . 
  how times change . 
  i did n't much like breaking bad on the first watch . 
  i got a season through , and was n't blown away , then i watched half of season 2 , felt the same and stopped watching it . 
  went back to it , and loved it so much more , now i think of it as one of the better shows i 've ever seen . 
  game of thrones took me a while to get into , then i read the books and that made understanding the show much easier . 
  coleman 's playing really really well , but i 'm with you , i think zabaleta 's more solid . 
  sagna seems to be returning to form recently as well . 
  i watched kids three years ago , and i still do n't know how to feel about that movie ... 
  sick of glen johnson now . 
  he 's such a liability this season . 
  did n't you know , suarez ca n't be fouled . 
  we have a tiny squad , it 's hardly new news . 
  we did n't get the players we needed in the summer , and now we 're struggling . 
  my word it 's annoying with the audience constantly laughing . 
  is this what it 's like in america ? 
  thanks for letting me know . 
  shout out to wayne 's world 2 . 
  my friend 's a bolton fan , he was a huge fan of alonso , knew he was too good for them unless they got promoted . 
  could be a great signing . 
  montoya 's signing a new contract ( ~ ~ ballbag ~ ~ ballague ), 
  love treasure planet !, 
  i 'll lick my seat at anfield if this happens . 
  wonder if klose was top earner whilst at bayern ... 
  it 's from / u/whynotbeme2 so i think it 's legit . 
  glass of water next to his bed side . 
  good call ian . 
  good call , you never know when you 'll wake up with a thirst . 
  he never changes . 
  and the same season , jelavic !, 
  yeah he looks odd on the ball , like djimi traore , but he 's really quite comfortable on it . 
  for anyone who does n't know , he took over liverpool in 1959 in the second division , we won promotion , won three top division titles , two fa cups , 4 community shields , a uefa cup .
