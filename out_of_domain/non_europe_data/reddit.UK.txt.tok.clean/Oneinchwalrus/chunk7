  syndicate 's next to it , which came out less than a month ago . 
  how would we pay for it then ? 
  dead space 2 final boss on zealot , with hardly any health/ammo or the appropriate weapons . 
  took up most of my sunday . 
  i snapped the disc , then realised there 's two discs for the game , now i have half of dead space 2 . 
  rabble rabble rabble raaaah, 
  i think we recouped a lot of the money spent , but we spent it on subpar british players , who are n't good enough . 
  ( carroll/downing/adam ) , henderson has been okay , but he 's young and will improve , whilst carroll , i do n't think will . 
  our tactics have been awful , today , just like all season , we have 6 players on the edge of the box looking for it , and not one inside of the box - how are we supposed to score like that . 
  it 's simple ; we 're not . 
  the players can take the blame to a point , but afterall , it 's kenny and comolli who signed them , and kenny who chooses the line-ups and decides on the tactics . 
  ** i 'm not saying sack kenny ** , but if fsg are serious , then i honestly think they might just in the summer . 
  the fame was too much for him , he could n't handle it . 
  with a drug addiction , and his long term bipolar condition , he committed suicide . 
  if you were being watched 24/7 by the world , and had a long term paranoia , partly drug induced , what would you expect to happen ? 
  unless you have paranoia , you would n't understand . 
  i am not famous , but suffer from low level paranoia . 
  it 's bad enough for me , i ca n't imagine what it was like for him . 
  if he wanted to commit suicide , it 's * his * life , it 's * his * decision . 
  let him do what he wants . 
  but nice name calling , really . 
   should celtic turn a result , that mob will run riot, 
  it 'll be a riot anyway probably, 
  nice . 
  that 'd * bee * interesting, 
  as someone who does n't wash his own socks , i would n't even try it . 
  the shock my sock washer would get ... 
  i borrowed the second disc , and beat it first go . 
  but i still have dreams about it to this day ... & # 3232 ;\\ _ & # 3232 ;, 
  you shut your whore mouth :(, 
  i see what you mean troll ... & # 3232 ;\\ _ & # 3232 ;, 
  i did n't . 
  we do n't have them in britain , we only know crumpets . 
  you do realise that the link i posted is to the american version of red dwarf . 
  so your point is invalid , silly . 
  ) finished my tasks for the sunday, 
  ) gon na watch up later for the first time, 
  ) i have brahma beer and chocolate, 
  it happens everywhere , because it can be a yellow card offence . 
  red , sometimes too . 
  [ love this version ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnl_lchq7og ), 
  no problem . 
  maybe you should n't drink and reddi ... who am i kidding , it 's impossible not to !, 
  i 'm doing it right now, 
  calm down guys !, 
  it 's not like izzard is a common discussion on reddit for him to know if he 's well known or not . 
  why did the monkey fall out of the tree ? 
  it was dead . 
  [ d'aww ] ( http://alltheragefaces.com/img/faces/large/fap-now-kiss-l.png ), 
  the bi-weekly dempsey thread i see . 
  he 's a good player , nothing special . 
  essien would have made this list ~ ~ last season . ~ ~ two seasons ago, 
  he had a long term injury last year , and even when he did n't , he was n't too good, 
  americans are very militarily proud , very . 
  long has flopped for wba . 
  gomez is pretty unrealistic . 
  that 's true . 
  shame carroll 's not relevant to this thread . 
  beats the lure of darius henderson , liam trotter , and tamika mkandawire . 
  hahem ... http://img2.moonbuggy.org/imgstore/rape-rape-rape-rape-rape-rape-rape-rape-rape.jpg, 
  it 's * always * in the music rooms huh . 
  even in my old school . 
  so brave, 
  bellend . 
  pretty much this . 
  the ` jocks ' were generally the ones more likely to be bellends though . 
  everyone snorted shit like that . 
  sherbet , salt , pepper , etc, 
  ross kemp or peter andre . 
  that would be fun . 
  bar session 9, 
  do n't go the cinema often , too far away . 
  but i seen the dark knight twice , only film i 've ever done that too . 
  the beatles never really had strong scouse accents though . 
  i 'm scouse myself , only scousers understand scouse . 
  everyone else does n't bother even trying, 
  really do n't care about them , i 'd rather our players have a good rest . 
  doubt many of ours will be called up though . 
  suarez , henderson , kelly , carroll , perhaps . 
  i think the hatred stage passed , and now it 's just pity for him . 
  now i have reason to buy a multi-region dvd player , and get it shipped to england . 
  downvote all the people, 
  i do n't know what i 'm yelling about, 
  it 's the dead centre of insert town/city name here . 
  reina , flanno , carra , skrtel , enrique , gerrard , shelvey , spearing , bellamy , suarez , carroll, 
  will definitely be looking out for them now . 
  hope he does well , and takes over here eventually . 
  used to it . 
  came to expect this crap all too familiarly . 
  you were saying ? 
  there 's only out there who 's actually tried today , and that 's shelvey . 
  pathetic liverpool , the worst thing is , they do n't even look like they care . 
  done with him now . 
  stormed out of the stadium also . 
  cut losses on some poor sap who 'd buy him . 
  we would . 
  we could still get some money for him , believe it or not . 
  a club like stoke he 'd thrive at . 
  as someone who 's been to every home game this season , and got 7 years . 
  carroll lost support a long time ago , it 's now basically putting up with him , same with henderson .
