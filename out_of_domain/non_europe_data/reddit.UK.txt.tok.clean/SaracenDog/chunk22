  where does it come from ? 
  how do i prevent it from constantly escalating ? 
  now , after months of being able to gloat about my practically perfectly-functioning copy of rome ii , it seems that patch 5 has snuffed that out . 
  now the game crashes every time i open it up , going to the loading screen that precedes the movies ( the one with the title and all the copyright information below ) before a `` rome ii : total war has stopped working '' message appears . 
  is this the result of a flawed patch or its effect on modding ? 
  i have the radious total war and the two turns per year mod installed , but thats all . 
  are they , combined with the new patch , causing the game to fail on startup ? 
  i 've been wracking my brains about this for close to a year now . 
  i 've looked at the previous `` brony phenomenon '' thread , questioned one or two friends who have `` converted '' so to speak , and i 've managed to nail down that the show is apparently humorous on a stealth-adult level , has some relevant social commentary , and other such arguments in its favour . 
  still this leaves me no explanation as to why so many on the internet appear to be practically bathing , perhaps even living their online lives through this fandom . 
  some basic questions arise ;, 
  1 ) why do so many men , in a growing quantity of online photographs ( particularly of irl `` brony clubs '' ) wear mlp t-shirts and other clothing ? 
  what propels them to abandon preconceived notions of masculinity and wear such items in public ? 
  2 ) why do they create memes , images , online personas and even pornography based off of the shows characters ? 
  i understand many on deviantart and furaffinity ( to name but a few sites ) share `` unusual '' fetishes in the first place , but what about others ? 
  what causes them to create such a swelling of mlp-based content ? 
  3 ) why does the online fanbase seem to consist of a much higher concentration of men who openly praise the show ? 
  is there an equal number of women i have missed , or is the gender disproportion accurate ? 
  i mean no offense by these questions , i am genuinely curious about why the show affects and perhaps even inspires people in such a way . 
  re-linking to other relevant threads will be appreciated . 
  this just hit me a day ago . 
  back in medieval times , i assume people judged how long a year objectively was by breaking it down into a quarter per season ( spring , summer , autumn , winter ) to judge its length in days or weeks , and then maybe used a calendar to tell the length of time passed for each successive year . 
  now considering summers and winters are decades long in the asoiaf series , you 'd think the westerosi definition of a `` year '' would be much greater than ours - yet various characters describe ( in both show and book , iirc ) summers that last for `` several years '' , despite there being no basis for them to use the normal definition , or any definition less than the combined length of their summers and winters , of a years length . 
  is there some other way the westerosi learned how to count the length of the year ? 
  or is this just a way of making things easier to understand for us readers/watchers ? 
  theoretically , if i were to post fanfiction of fallout , where would i put it ? 
  is there a certain subreddit i need to go to , or is it okay to plonk here ? 
  i 've recently got back onto playing ro2 , and i was wondering if the tanks , like their real world counterparts , have the ubiquitous `` weak points '' that real tanks had ; ie , does hitting it in the rear hull/engine cause more damage/have more of a chance to land a killing or crippling blow ? 
  i ask this because from what i remember about my past ro2 experiences , whether it was going toe-to-toe with a t-34 behind the wheel of a panzer iv or scurrying up behind the latter with an rpg-40 , hitting it in the rear or side did n't seem to do much more harm than simply hitting it head on . 
  is this just my poor memory , or was i doing a good job by flanking enemy tanks all along ? 
  also , be sure to check out jfd 's other custom sponsors - they 're really something to behold !, 
  not specifically speaking in gameplay terms ( though such observations are welcome , of course ) but rather , how would you have ended the tiberian story ? 
  personally , i found the whole kane-gdi alliance and his reveal as a space alien to be a little ( read : very ) hokey , and a big letdown after the events of the third game - not to mention the character you 're forced to take on in the cutscenes , and the cringey relationship subplot you have to trudge through . 
  so , given the authority , cncers , how should have the story ended ? 
  this is my first proper ( ie actually organised ) army list , and i 'm about to get back into the hobby after missing several editions ( i last played during 4th ed ) . 
  could you guys give me some thoughts on this list ? 
  cheers !,

  reckon there 's anything else i should have , or something i should subtract ? 
  on a related note , if the ccs has carapace armor , does the master of ordinance also get it ? 
  many thanks !, 
  hey guys , i just wan na know , is it possible to achieve xp for accomplishing class-specific xp goals , while operating as a different class in killing floor 2 ? 
  say , for example , i was playing commando , and had , as backups , a boomstick and a medic pistol . 
  would i achieve support and medic xp for killing zeds with the shotgun and healing teammates with the pistol , respectively , even though i 've selected commando ? 
  i remember hearing this somewhere , possibly totalbiscuits pre-early access commentary , but is it actually true ? 
  or is xp only granted to the class you 're playing as ? 
  thanks !, 
  bit of context ; i recently tried to use fallout character overhaul and new vegas redesigned 3 in conjunction , which worked fine until i got to primm and the powder gangers/named ncr characters had the `` missing model '' textures and floating teeth and eyes for heads . 
  reasoning this was a conflict , i uninstalled fco and reactivated nvr3 , even verified my game cache , though the error now seems global . 
  it might just be doc mitchell whose fucked , but i do n't have the patience to go finding out who else has the bug . 
  any help would be sorely appreciated !, 
  edit : i updated nvr3 to the 3.0 critical fixes , and doc mitchell was fine ... outside however , the bug persisted for sunny smiles and goodsprings settlers . 
  as per suggestion , i will try rolling back to nvr2 . 
  watching the numerous e3 footage of fallout 4 ( which was , to say the least , fuggin ' ballin ' ) , i 've noticed a few of the new features are pretty familiar . 
  for example a sprint function that uses up action points is something both the fwe and project nevada mods did , and the crafting appears to have expanded into what some mods attempted to do . 
  probably the biggest one , though , is the ability to build settlements - its as if they personally wanted to kick the dev of real time settler out of his hobby !, 
  do n't get me wrong , it 's got me hyped too - my point being , though , it looks as if bethesda is really taking cues from the modding community . 
  hell , look at the new doom !, 
  it looks like they 're rolling with the ultraviolence of brutal doom , one of the franchises most popular mods !, 
  this also spells good things for fallout 4 's modding capacity too , as it was mentioned that the game runs on an upgraded version of the creation engine ( no unmoddable id tech , yay ! ) . 
  by gum , these are exciting times indeed . 
  sorry if i appear to be rambling . 
  it has been a good day for seeing things . 
  now i 've seen a lot of people talk about the fact that the player character has been given a pre-set backstory by bethesda . 
  for those of you who may not be sure what i 'm talking about , essentially the player character is a military veteran according to both official sources ( namely the e3 trailer ) and certain pre-e3 rumours . 
  a lot of people are worried that this will stunt their rp experience , having a good deal of the characters backstory restricted by this `` imposition '' . 
  i was one such naysayer . 
  but after some thought , i 'm beginning to rescind my opinion ; if anything , this gives rp ` ers a great deal to work with , considering the context of the fallout universe . 
  of course , this relies on bethesda 's writers not hamfistedly trying to fill the gaps . 
  for instance , you know you are a discharged veteran - but from what branch ? 
  army ? 
  air force ? 
  marines ? 
  did you serve with distinction or indifference ? 
  rise to the rank of nco , or remain a lacklustre recruit ? 
  these sorts of things would be something to consider when picking your special stats tag skills ( assuming they still exist ) for instance - if the pc survived many gruesome encounters during the sino-american war , maybe they get high luck ? 
  or high endurance if they got out of a chinese prison camp alive ? 
  did they take part in the anchorage , gobi and/or yangtze campaigns ?
