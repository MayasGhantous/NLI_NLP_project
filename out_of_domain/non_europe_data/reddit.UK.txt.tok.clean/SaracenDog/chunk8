  ** but , ** taking the `` whatwecanuse '' teaser into account , and the theories surrounding the box of parts shown in the trailer and screenshots , then if we do indeed have one animatronic ( lets call him `` rotten '' ) , then perhaps we 're looking at a lone antagonist that is constantly and modularly upgrading himself , adapting to your tactics with different parts and combinations , perhaps even being able to split himself into multiple parts etc. 
  its a terrifying possibility , and if its true , i 'm interested to see how scott will pull it off . 
  p.s - what ** we ** canuse may allude to rotten having an accomplice ... possibly golden freddy or the purple man . 
  hell , if rottens getting constant upgrades , he 's gon na need someone to help apply them !, 
  that is infinitely cool . 
  good fuggin ' job . 
  `` at first there were only empty shells , a hand , a hook ... then a remarkable discovery was made . '', 
  ** `` at first '' **, 
  maybe this `` remarkable discovery '' * was * the ability to create endoskeletons . 
  however , the only reason there 's one animatronic ** so far ** might be because the salvage is only a test model , with other incomplete endoskeletons in storage at the start of the game . 
  which will probably lead to some devious hybridised horrors later on , built by the salvage as part of some `` rebellion '' . 
  i 'm about 98 % sure this is satire . 
  but part of me worries it is n't ... 
  well , supposedly , we are getting new plastic khorne berserkers , so ... 
  with the black parade uniforms and all ? 
  christ on a bike , those were some wierd enemies to put in a ww2 game ... 
  looks like a map straight out of ut99 . 
  great job though , very creative !, 
  would this be implemented in tt games , or is it just a setpiece ? 
  aw , i was hoping we would get a necromunda game after mordheim . 
  still , this looks damn good , and here 's to hoping for some ganger shenanigans from focus in the future !, 
  i always had ideas like this . 
  right on , i say . 
  you 're basically thinking of epic 40,000 - if there 's one of the old specialist games that needs reviving , it 's that one , and in this format , definitely !, 
  edit : i was thinking of wargame , my mistake . 
  something in the vein of mordheim . 
  except its necromunda . 
  and we get to create and customise our own gangs/houses , if we wish . 
  exactly what i was thinking . 
  there 'd be strategic element in the form of a gang hq layer , sort of like xcom 's mission control , where you equip and arm your gangers , pick up contracts from across the hive , etc etc. 
  as well against fighting off the arbites and other gangs , you might also face off against mutants , scavvies , redemptionists , and genestealer cults - lots of variety , lots of ways to get your gangers slaughtered . 
  same here , those diddly-little models were adorable :(, 
  `` multiple points of view '', 
  warhammer 40,000 - a telltale games series ? 
  and where are you getting that sweeping generalisation from ? 
  the mirror and metro are tabloid trash . 
  the express and breitbart are both some of the most notoriously hard-right publications in the country . 
  so yeah , stormfront in all but name . 
  and the english version !, 
  ... where the fuck did * that * come from ? 
  that 's some misery-level shit right there . 
  an alien according to cnc4 , mind you ... 
  well , in the first tiberium war , nod was using m1a2 bradleys and apache/commanche helicopters in their standard roster . 
  maybe their was more than one reason for kane to recall you from the attack on the states ... 
  thrax was always about generally anything toxic - germ warfare , chemical weapons , probably even nuclear given the chance . 
  oh yeah , forgot that the nod ai was legion in the third game . 
  but yes , same voice actor apparently !, 
  i always assumed cnc4 would be jumped on by modders hoping to restore it to some state of acceptability . 
  that being said , there were apparently no modding tools and i doubt most modders could justify buying a game they would be sinking wasted hours into `` fixing '' anyway . 
  better that people stick with cnc3 modding anyway , the game is much more playable as-is and mods only make it more interesting . 
  holy hell , this was too good . 
  i love rammstein , and i 've always wanted to see metropolis - you 've given me chills and convinced me to go find a copy !, 
  cabal and legion are essentially nods version of eva , but they 're artificially intelligent as well ( legion , i assume , had his freedom of thought clipped to prevent another firestorm crisis ) . 
  as well as informing the human commander , they were equally capable of directing operations on their own . 
  `` you are probably a racist . '', 
  `` you are white . '', 
  `` who cares about the irish . '', 
  and then ; `` please learn to do our hair . '', 
  `` please season our food . '', 
  so in short , beer good ? 
  good paint job - but if he 's wearing a full hostile environment suit , should n't he be wearing gloves at the very least ? 
  possibly , though i imagine the hostile environment suits are for areas with high radiation , nuclear blast zones , extreme temperatures and generally nasty places to fight ... though if its just a case of bad air , i suppose he could get away with wearing no gloves . 
  i giggled at that mental image , well played . 
  so ... why is this a thing again ? 
  ah , very good then . 
  just seemed a little strange . 
  good calls here , really good advice . 
  the demolisher could use some stripping down , you 're right , so would you recommend i ditch the hb sponsons and lascannons ? 
  as for the infantry platoon suggestion , that might work , though would n't they struggle to keep up with the main force ? 
  i mean , sure , they 'd be a good flank protector , but if they fall behind too far would n't that limit their effectiveness ? 
  also , should i keep their equipment barebones as possible , or maybe gear them up a little ? 
  thankyou for taking the time to reply !, 
  two russes sound like a neat idea , though what would be the best variant to complement a demolisher ? 
  the dozer blades are definitely a good idea though , i just thought recovery gear would ease my paranoia a little when my vehicles inevitably get knocked out !, 
  also , autocannons on chimera 's are a technicality - they are possible , but supposedly only with an imperial armour listing . 
  i suppose this is something i should discuss with whoever i 'm playing in a friendly , since i 'm using the standard am codex for the most part . 
  that being said , what is the next best weapon to stick on a chimera ? 
  red orchestra 2 is a pretty damn good depiction , if you 're not looking for a strictly-narrative experience . 
  my guess is a speculative military-grade ambulance . 
  i do n't speak dutch , but i 'm fairly sure its saying something along the lines of `` do you want it to end up like this ? '', 
  its as if they have no idea that they 're the ones being satirised . 
  they are so dense its unreal . 
  believe me , it is . 
  this guys been seen around before , like so ; https://img.4plebs.org/boards/pol/image/1387/06/1387067076243.jpg, 
  also , possibly ; https://img.4plebs.org/boards/pol/image/1386/96/1386967582809.jpg, 
  ignoring the fact that this was sourced from the sun , of all places ... context ? 
  had to google it to find evidence of this guys existence , and it was the best i could find , unfortunately . 
  i would n't go near / pol / unless i absolutely had to prove something so terrible was real . 
  please do n't tell me this is the warlord titan . 
  please , just let it be another knight variant , or at least just a mars-pattern warlord . 
  if the latter , then we better get a lucius pattern that looks like the classic version ; http://belloflostsouls.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/favorite004.jpg, 
  so ... what was the great head for converting tank crews and inq . 
  henchmen ? 
  okay , maybe not that classic !, 
  more like the `` modern '' version . 
  then again they 're bringing out the istvaan campaign book , so its likely that this 'll be a heresy-era warlord , i think . 
  god damn , that discharge feature is so disgustingly beautiful !, 
  an absolutely perfect way to do flight-stands for these things , well done !, 
  you forgot the hyper-realistic blood . 
  wait , so you 're friends with david firth ?
