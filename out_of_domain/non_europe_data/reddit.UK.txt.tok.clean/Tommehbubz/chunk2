  i 'd never played it properly until the 3ds version , having never owned an n64 , being at an age where everything i wanted was at the whims of my parents . 
  but i picked up the 3ds limited edition bundle and really enjoyed it . 
  i think i would have enjoyed it more at the time . 
  i think wind waker 's my favourite , but oot is still up there .
