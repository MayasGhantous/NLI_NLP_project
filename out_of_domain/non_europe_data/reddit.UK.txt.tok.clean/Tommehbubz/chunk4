  i think minimum wage should be increased to the point where anyone working an 8-hour day , 5-day week would n't need to claim any benefits ( council tax relief , working tax credits and housing benefit etc. ) . 
  as it is at the moment , many employers are simply paying employees the minimum with the notion that they can claim the rest they need to survive from the government . 
  these companies are making vast profits off the work of these people , so they should pay them accordingly and reduce the burden on the tax payer . 
  if people working full time are n't earning enough to live without benefits , they are n't being paid enough for their work . 
  increase taxes on high earners , increase minimum wage to an actual living wage , abolish university tuition fees . 
  supporting nuclear power and maintaining our armed forces . 
  based on a similar model to how http://www.livingwage.org.uk/calculation have done it . 
  it 's not overly difficult to establish , and their calculations show that the current minimum wage does n't quite cut it . 
  [ willam belli ] ( https://www.youtube.com/channel/ucro9hj5vqgjufblvjy-8d1g ) is a drag queen with some really funny and well done song parodies , mainly addressing lgbt topics . 
  `` examining the cases of more than 10,000 sons and daughters revealed how a ** cold or distant ** father can damage a child 's life , sometimes for decades to come . '', 
  it does n't mention the absence of a father altogether , just a father that does n't have a healthy relationship equal to the mother . 
  there are plenty of studies that show same-sex couples are just as good at raising kids . 
  i agree they 're sensationalising it , but how is it a non-issue exactly ? 
  nintendo should stand up for what 's right , not what would offend the least amount of people . 
  just like all the controversy the sims , skyrim etc. 
  have had for including same sex relationships ... 
  i think the backlash nintendo have received so far proves that people will be more offended by its exclusion . 
  and if people are uncomfortable with lgbt relationships then that 's their fault , nintendo should n't try to appease them . 
  i do n't get why parents are so hesitant to expose their kids to positive representations of homosexuality . 
  what are they scared will happen ? 
  i knew nobody who was gay growing up , and i ca n't remember coming across any positive portrayals of the lgbt community in games/tv/movies etc. , and i ended up gay anyway . 
  coming across the sims as a teenager was amazing to me , actually being able to experience gay relationships without the stereotypes . 
  allowing potentially lgbt kids to see that gay relationships are no different within a game like this could do wonders for their self esteem . 
  if you want to he a good parent , you 'd actively expose your child to representations of normal , healthy lgbt life . 
  i played the sims as a kid , so did most of my friends , so did thousands of other kids . 
  regardless , what 's so nsfw about lgbt relationships ? 
  the sims got a teen rating for it 's sex , irrespective of the genders of the sims taking part . 
  i do n't see how excluding a whole demographic is good business practice . 
  by including same-sex relationships they 're not choosing demographics , they 're including both . 
  heterosexual relationships would still exist . 
  i should stop reading the comments to tomodachi posts , they piss me off too much . 
  i honestly thought the gaming community was getting over its homophobia ... 
  just because something is n't the most common , it does n't make it abnormal . 
  only 1-2 % of the world 's population are redheads , but it 's not considered abnormal , it just occurs less frequently . 
  normal, 
  \u02c8n\u0254\u02d0m ( \u0259 ) l /, 
  adjective, 
  conforming to a standard ; usual , typical , or expected . 
  abnormal, 
  \u0259b\u02c8n\u0254\u02d0m ( \u0259 ) l /, 
  adjective, 
  deviating from what is normal or usual , typically in a way that is undesirable or worrying .
