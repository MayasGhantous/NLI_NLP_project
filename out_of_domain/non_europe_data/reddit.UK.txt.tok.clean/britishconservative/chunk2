  which , in my opinion , would be closing the borders . 
  to everyone really , although especially the countries with the highest rates of terrorism ( syria and the surrounding region ), 
  right so you want evidence , okay,

  if you think countries have n't stopped immigration in the past , or that they 've never taken isolationist policies , then you 've never read a history book in your entire life . 
  it is political bravery . 
  it 's bravery to say `` this is fucking absurd what 's going on , germany invited 1 million new migrants into its country without checking who the hell they were , and now they 're raping women and attacking people for not conforming to their completely incompatible ideals '' ( oh yeah that was another attack i should have mentioned , [ the rapes in cologne , and other german cities , on new year 's eve ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/new_year%27s_eve_sexual_assaults_in_germany ) ), 
  and it 's chickenshit lunacy to say `` hey let 's pretend this is n't a problem !, 
  let 's pretend people are n't being killed all across europe !, 
  let 's pretend [ sweden is n't covering up the truth when migrants rape swedish women !, 
  ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/11/swedish-police-accused-cover-up-sex-attacks-refugees-festival ) let 's pretend [ france is n't covering up the sickening reality of the bataclan attack !, 
  ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3692359/french-government-suppressed-gruesome-torture-bataclan-victims-official-inquiry-told-castrated-eyes-gouged-isis-killers.html ), 
  that 's chickenshit . 
  you do n't have the balls to face up to what 's going on . 
  and you have the gall to call people who want to do something about it `` chickenshit '' because you 're too chickenshit to endorse what 's really needed , for fear of `` oh no i might * offend * somebody !, 
  how dreadful !, 
  i 'm sure many more of our people can die if it means i 'm not * offending * anybody ! '', 
  absolutely pathetic . 
  look at the vast majority of nations around the world - do they have open door immigration policies ? 
  a nation has absolutely no obligation to open up its borders to anybody if it does n't want to . 
  and at the moment the west is suffering because we are letting in people who want to kill us . 
  we have absolutely no obligation to let anybody in , but our politicians are too bloody spineless to do anything about it . 
  and lefties wonder why donald trump won the republican nomination . 
  why brexit won . 
  why marine le pen is now polling second for the french presidency . 
  why the afd has surged in germany . 
  why norbert hofer is within a whisker of winning the austrian presidency . 
  why geert wilders is polling first for the dutch elections . 
  why the sweden democrats are surging in sweden . 
  ( if you had n't figured it out , these are all anti-immigration parties . ), 
  westerners are looking at the evidence of these attacks being committed by migrants and they 're realising `` we have no obligation to let anybody in . 
  why the hell would we let people in who want to kill us . '', 
  they 're looking at the evidence and making a rational decision . 
  and you 're too * chickenshit * to admit that truth and admit that we need to do something about it , or else it will just happen again and again . 
  okay , but here 's the kicker - the ones using social media are probably going to do better in life . 
  but that 's kinda how it is . 
   i do n't understand why conservative opinions are so offensive to them . 
  they 're jealous of people who have fun . 
  modern progressives are like the victorians - no fun , no sex , no nothing , apart from oppressively strict morality . 
  those on the right today have fun and live life and they ca n't stand it . 
  lol , labour are a bloody mess . 
  i love it !, 
  maybe now people will realise that going to uni for a mickey mouse degree is a waste of time . 
  surf studies ( yeah it 's a thing ) , gender studies , communication , journalism ( seriously , just do english or history ) , criminology , philosophy ( i did a philosophy degree - unless you want to become a paid academic , it 's a pointless degree ) , psychology , anthropology , etc. 
  any job that you can get with one of these could also be got with a rigorous degree like english or history . 
  or obviously you could do a stem degree and expand your options even further - physics , biology , chemistry , mech . 
  eng. , whatever, 
  a metric fuckton of people who do those mickey mouse degrees end up working in starbucks . 
  what a waste of time . 
  why did you let cultural marxists destroy western society ? 
  `` they '' is plural and i am not going to accept it as a singular pronoun , unless you do n't know the sex of the person you 're referring to, 
  you are born male or female ( unless you have klinefelter 's or are intersex , but that 's pretty damn rare ), 
  damn ... 
  i think that shows just how distorted this generation is that they ca n't even tolerate different opinions, 
  i definitely think this is going to change at some point though . 
  things will happen where they realise `` huh , our peace and love message is n't helping us when people are being killed ... maybe we should change tack '', 
   most women have no problems doing the same work men do in the average workplace . 
  i 'm sorry but i have to disagree with you . 
  men and women , in general , excel in different areas . 
  i 'm also a developer and i 've met female developers who are way better than i am . 
  but being completely honest - meeting female developers * at all * is the exception rather than the norm . 
  as you certainly know , the field is largely male . 
  in my view ( and in the view of scientists that i have read and watched ) , that is the result of biology . 
  men generally have vastly higher testosterone levels than women , and that 's what makes them more interested in systems , logical thinking , and generally worse at social skills , talking , and empathy . 
  thus software is mostly male , and nursing is mostly female . 
  women are ( generally ) better at making eye contact , better with empathy , more interested in people , better at communication , better with social skills . 
  i 'm not saying anything about men being more competent overall than women - in every single human society , both men and women have had to work , and be competent in the work they 're doing , otherwise the society does n't function . 
  but they have had different roles , to suit their different natural skills and abilities . 
   if you think women should have more kids or more time to nurture , you should support parental leave , and workplace policies that enable work/life balance such as flexible schedules and remote work . 
  i assume you mean paternity leave . 
  perhaps , but i know many men are not interested in being carers - they would rather go to work , and provide for the family . 
  i do very much believe we should respect both men and women for what they are , instead of trying to make both exactly the same , which they are n't , and which they 'll never be . 
   feminists do n't want to be the same as men , they want equal opportunities as men . 
  they want an equal right to vote , own property , run for office , test their strength in boot camp . 
  you say this and yet feminists say `` there are n't enough women in tech !, 
  we need to encourage women to take stem subjects ! '', 
  they assume the reason there are n't more women in tech is because of discrimination . 
  in reality , men and women choose different subjects , because they ( in general ) have different interests , due to biology . 
  even in the womb , male babies are producing twice as much testosterone as female babies , and this affects brain development . 
  the higher your testosterone ( whether you 're male or female - but males generally have much higher levels ) , the more interested in systems you will be , the longer you will take to learn language , to develop social skills , etc. 
  whereas females ( or those with low testosterone level ) are , as babies , more interested in faces , quicker to acquire language , have better social skills , are better with empathy . 
  this is why i think it 's valid for lauren to raise this point . 
  many feminists today ( you see it even in mainstream media all the time ) are n't striving for securing rights and liberties for women , which is noble . 
  they 're striving for enforced equality , which is not noble . 
  it 's unfair , and it 's bad for both women and men in my opinion ( e.g. 
  like , how lauren says , women can end up being 40 and thinking `` crap i really wish i had had kids instead of focusing on my career '' ), 
   i 've worked in a variety of jobs and the women are never any less competent than the men . 
  i 'm a software developer and i 'm as good as the guys on my team . 
  firstly , no one 's saying women are generally less competent than men . 
  but men and women generally excel in different areas . 
  due to biology . 
  as you say , physical jobs are one area in which males generally excel due to biological differences . 
  there are of course strong women - ronda rousey would kick my arse in two seconds flat - but generally , men are naturally stronger than women . 
   work culture in the western world simply has n't yet adjusted to provide good work/life balance , but that 's improving . 
  would n't the best balance be that the man goes and works for resources , while the woman takes care of the children and the home ?
