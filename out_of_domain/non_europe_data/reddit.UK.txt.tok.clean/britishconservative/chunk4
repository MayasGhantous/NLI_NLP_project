  i 'm a trump supporter but i personally do n't see why this comment is interpreted as racist . 
  she was describing criminals . 
  why do people automatically assume a racial element ? 
  i hate when the left automatically assume a racial element when one does n't exist , so i have every reason to hate it when the right does it too . 
  kek . 
  good post . 
  again , proving my point nicely . 
  tens of millions of americans feel their livelihoods are under threat and you laugh about it , then wonder why they hate you . 
  interesting . 
  damn , you 're right . 
  they should just kill themselves instead . 
  they 're not allowed to have concerns because they do n't fit into a designated minority group . 
  my mistake . 
  cool , so we 've established you 're advocating , or at least you `` would feel better '' , if political dissenters were exterminated in a mass genocide . 
  glad we can clear that up . 
  i fail to see how your generalisation that all trump voters `` hate [ you ] for [ your ] birth '' , or that they `` believe in a giant globalist ... conspiracy '' ( and it 's hilarious that you think that , by the way ) , is any more noble , and less discriminatory , than generalisations about races or genders . 
  care to explain that one ? 
  the white race is non-existent ... interesting . 
  no need for black lives matter then ? 
  races do n't exist , you say , so their movement does n't even make sense . 
  how can you people honestly ask the question `` why do working americans hate us with such vitriol '' when you treat them with such disdain ? 
  i can see the lefty brigade did n't like my last comment , hence the downvotes . 
   i personally think that it 's important to teach personal responsibility and that it 's important to be able to provide for a family . 
  i think it is important , but that it should n't necessarily be tied to manhood . 
  i think the family structure is important , but that when given a choice where the father makes less than the mother there should be no shame in swapping the traditional roles . 
  i can respect that view . 
  but i disagree with it really . 
  because :, 
  a ) women lose respect for men who earn less than them and, 
  b ) men become emasculated by women earning more than them, 
  some people can make it work , sure . 
  that does n't erase human biology though . 
  men like to be leaders , and women are attracted to leaders . 
  testosterone creates these differences . 
  it can lead to a lot of resentment when those roles are reversed . 
   oh yes , that known `` right winger '' leon trotsky sure should have thought twice before being a `` conservative '' dissenting voice . 
  okay you 're right , it was just all people who were `` enemies of the working people '' . 
  so everyone apart from stalinists , which is of course a far-left position . 
   do n't act like stalin 's atrocities have anything to do with marxism . 
  oh yeah sure , because it 's not like the marxist regimes in [ cuba ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cuba#human_rights ) , [ china ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/china#sociopolitical_issues.2c_human_rights.2c_and_reform ) , [ vietnam ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/communism_in_vietnam#north_vietnam ) , [ cambodia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pol_pot ) , and basically everywhere else that marxism has been introduced , have committed either organised murders or human rights abuses against those who dissent against the state . 
  yeah , you 're right . 
  none of that ever happened . 
  yes it is . 
  i 'm not offended by the inclusion of black soldiers in the game . 
  i 'm saying that it is obvious political correctness when they 've put a black soldier on the cover of this game , despite the fact that black soldiers were probably less than 1 % of soldiers fighting in europe . 
  i even watched a video where someone from dice said `` oh we heard about this , that there were black soldiers fighting in europe , so we decided to highlight it '' . 
  yes , there were indeed black soldiers fighting in europe - like one or two units out of thousands . 
  such a infinitesimally small proportion that they are statistically irrelevant . 
  dice have deliberately chosen to push this narrative for their own political goals . 
  i do n't hate you , i was making more of a point about trump supporters in general , although yes i will admit that of course i dislike the patronising attitudes that come from the left . 
  i disagree , i think humans are purely driven by emotion . 
  we have this concept of being `` rational '' but rationality is really just a tool of the emotions . 
  human actions make zero sense without an ultimate grounding in emotions . 
  say you want to punch someone in the face but then you think `` no , rationally , i should n't do this - i would go to jail . '', 
  the basis for your choice is still emotional . 
  you feel a dislike , or fear , towards the idea of going to prison . 
  and you feel an emotional attachment to the security that not being in prison provides . 
  politics , like everything else , is no different - there is no logical or rational basis for your political decisions other than your emotions . 
  they are the fundamental grounding and impetus for why you would ever choose one set of political ideas over another . 
  it is political correctness . 
  sorry you would rather be politically correct than show the truth . 
   '' [ we want to show diversity in the game . 
  that 's been a key goal .

   they would not have a problem if it was an australian or a canadian . 
  that 's because way more australians and canadians fought in the european theatre of wwi than black soldiers . 
   harlem hellfighters, 
  this argument is so terrible because one single fighting unit out of thousands does n't prove that a high percentage of soldiers fighting in europe - it proves the exact opposite , that these units were incredibly rare . 
   i just do n't like that they did n't show the german side or leaving the french out of the muliplayer, 
  exactly , that does suck , they 're leaving out the main combatants of this war and presenting a deliberately skewed perspective on the war for their own political game ( and for sales i guess since sjw revisionism has an audience ), 
  if the `` sides of the war many did n't know '' were shown realistically then this game probably would n't have such a backlash, 
   if a black face is every presented its political correctness . 
  false . 
  a black face on the front of madden or fifa is not political correctness . 
  why ? 
  because lots of black people play american football and football . 
  lots of black people did not fight in the european theatre of wwi . 
  that 's why it 's political correctness . 
   what if a turkish american was on the cover ? 
  that would also be political correctness because the majority of soldiers fighting in the european theatre in wwi were not of turkish descent . 
   the fact that you automatically think its `` correctness '' is telling . 
  it is political correctness . 
  i already explained why it 's political correctness . 
  1 ) the number of soldiers of african descent fighting in the european theatre ( the main theatre ) of wwi was very , very , very small . 
  2 ) the game developer themselves said it was a `` key goal '' to `` show diversity '' . 
  rather than an accurate representation of the historical events . 
  how do you think this feels to white people whose relatives fought and died in wwi ? 
  to see their memory defaced in the interest of political correctness ? 
  or do you only show `` solidarity '' with a racial identity group when it 's one that you 've determined is the eternal victim in every single situation until the end of time ? 
  [ skanky crack whore ? ] ( http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=s.c.w . ), 
   black americans fought in the war . 
  are you saying their story rarely told is n't will never be worthy of telling ? 
  it 's just correctness ? 
  what about the white europeans who outnumbered them by several orders of magnitude ? 
  are their stories not worth telling ? 
  are we just going to piss on the memory of the soldiers who actually fought and died in wwi in the name of political correctness ? 
  how many black american units were there ? 
  i have n't heard of any apart from the harlem hellfighters . 
  this game also portrays black german soldiers too , and i have read accounts of black soldiers fighting for germany in the european theatre , but their number would have been astronomically tiny . 
  this is the 2010s mate , have you not looked at a calendar recently ?
