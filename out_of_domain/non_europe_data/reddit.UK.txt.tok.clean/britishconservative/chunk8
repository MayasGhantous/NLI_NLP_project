  i 'm male , i 've always wanted kids , and like 90 % of this thread does n't want kids , and i find it absolutely horrifying . 
   productivity and profits have exploded since . 
  market sizes have gone global . 
  gdp has consistently risen . 
  wages have not risen with inflation , prices across the board have . 
  the only things that have changed since is women saturating the labor market giving businesses a larger labor pool to tap , lowering wages . 
  still does n't justify not following inflation by a wide margin . 
   if you ever sit down and think about how bad they fucked us , it makes you ... not happy . 
  so fuck what the older generations want . 
  i share your resentment on all these issues , but why are you blaming the older generation ? 
  millennials are the ones who currently vote for flooding the labour markets of industrialised nations with unlimited migrants . 
  millennials are the ones who oppose the imperialism of the west ( which is what made the west , and * your parents * , so well off in the first place , by the way ) , while also fully supporting globalism , which just sees the empires of china , russia , india , and other developing nations grow day by day . 
  if the western nations banded together like we used to do , and conquered the rest of the world , then we would be as rich as we used to be . 
  you might say this is mean ... but life 's a competition . 
  alternatively , i suppose the working/middle classes of all nations across the world could band together and overthrow the wealthy , or something like that . 
  maybe we need to start some sort of movement for tackling financial inequality , and for paying better wages ? 
  perhaps even one that is willing to use force if necessary . 
  look throughout history , and the only way that people got what they wanted from oppressors ( which the world 's international wealthy elite currently are , i suppose ) is through force and violence , so maybe that 's needed now . 
  if you think how many people there are across the western nations that are being absolutely shafted these days , i bet you could get together enough people to create a serious force that could create problems for those in power , unless they promise to tax the rich more heavily and increasing working class wages , or something along those lines . 
  since this thread is meant to foster discussion , allow me to retort . 
  here are some crime stats from the fbi 's website ( you can check each link for yourself ), 
  in us murders * where the race of the offender was known * ( so i 've excluded the `` unknown '' column , underneath `` race '' , from these percentages ) :, 
  [ 53.3 % were committed by blacks in 2015 ] ( https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2015/crime-in-the-u.s.-2015/tables/expanded_homicide_data_table_3_murder_offenders_by_age_sex_and_race_2015.xls ), 
  [ 53.0 % were committed by blacks in 2014 ] ( https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2014/crime-in-the-u.s.-2014/tables/expanded-homicide-data/expanded_homicide_data_table_3_murder_offenders_by_age_sex_and_race_2014.xls ), 
  [ 53.6 % were committed by blacks in 2013 ] ( https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2013/crime-in-the-u.s.-2013/offenses-known-to-law-enforcement/expanded-homicide/expanded_homicide_data_table_3_murder_offenders_by_age_sex_and_race_2013.xls ), 
  this is despite blacks being just [ 12.6 % ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demography_of_the_united_states#race_and_ethnicity ) of the us population . 
  we can debate about what the significance of these stats is , but i just wanted to respond to your idea of unsourced stats , by providing you with some sourced stats , so that you can reach your own conclusions . 
  but blacks are more likely to commit many sorts of crime . 
  that 's probably why they 're jailed more . 
  in us murders * where the race of the offender was known * :, 
  [ 53.3 % were committed by blacks in 2015 ] ( https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2015/crime-in-the-u.s.-2015/tables/expanded_homicide_data_table_3_murder_offenders_by_age_sex_and_race_2015.xls ),

  edit : let me provide some speculation on why this disproportionality may exist . 
  sure , culture and wealth are almost certainly two factors . 
  however , there may well be genetic factors too . 
  we already know that [ certain genes are linked with criminal behaviour ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-29760212 ) . 
  how do we know that such genes are n't more prevalent among certain races / ethnicities ? 
  we do n't . 
  so this could well be a factor too . 
  i know that suggesting that is highly controversial . 
  but controversiality has nothing to do with a proposition 's truth value . 
  it might be true ; we do n't know . 
  maybe he just means they 're not * prohibitively * expensive . 
  in my opinion , the money is worth it . 
  what else would i do with that ? 
  buy material possessions ? 
  these things are meaningless to me . 
  sure holidays are fun , but they end , and that 's it . 
  if you have children then you leave a lasting legacy upon the earth . 
  think of it this way : every organism on the planet is fighting to reproduce , to proliferate . 
  humans have been doing that for our entire existence , and will always do it . 
  same with amoebae , fish , lichen , trees , zebras , koalas , hippos , chimpanzees , humans - all are fighting each other for survival , and dominance even , and will continue to do so for ... ever , i guess ( unless the universe self-destructs ) . 
  this fight , the fight for survival ; i do n't want to lose at it . 
  i want my genes to pass down the generations . 
  i want to have a stake in the future . 
  that 's how i see it . 
   i 'll be a lot happier when schools are smaller, 
  but that wo n't happen . 
  either we reproduce more , or - as current predictions indicate - mass immigration to western countries will occur over the next 30 to 50 years . 
  our schools will not get smaller ( unless we stop immigration i suppose ) . 
   what 's worse is i do n't think it 's a reddit demographic thing . 
  it 's actually a general trend amoung millennials . 
   i think part of it 's culture . 
  the married and kids thing is n't such a big deal , and everyone seems to want to live in the cities and splurge on their hobbies . 
  and this worries me massively . 
  firstly , splurging on hobbies is utterly meaningless if your genes are n't going to survive . 
  in my opinion . 
  secondly , we face a terrible future . 
  either we become like japan , with an ageing and shrinking population , where people are worked to the bone in order to support the welfare state . 
  or mass immigration happens . 
  which will change the natures of western countries forever . 
  some people do n't see a problem with mass immigration , but i think they are a little short-sighted . 
  true , it has happened throughout history ; the anglo-saxons conquering britain , the umayyads conquering spain for a few hundred years , and the europeans settling the new world . 
  but none of these processes were painless . 
  in fact they were very pain-ful , for the original inhabitants of the places that experienced the mass immigration . 
  this is why i worry . 
  historical precedent shows that mass immigration will not be a happy-go-lucky experience ; it shows that conflict will be inevitable . 
  it does defy logic ; the reason being that a biological truth about all organisms on this planet is their desire to reproduce . 
  every single healthy organism on this planet will attempt to reproduce . 
  amoebae , lichen , trees , zebras , fish , cats , gorillas , humans . 
  if you do n't want to reproduce then it shows that , psychologically , you are not in perfect health . 
  they 're not even thinking about the future . 
  they are only thinking about buying the next zelda game . 
  or watching the next marvel movie . 
  it is utterly , utterly depressing that these people are choosing to live such meaningless lives . 
  and they 're choosing to fuck over our countries while they 're at it . 
  maybe we should remove the vote from people who do n't procreate ? 
  they do n't have a vested interest in the future !, 
  i agree with you on all this , definitely . 
  so yes i guess you are right that boomers should be blamed for these things . 
  but , like i said , millennials support these policies even more than their parents . 
  that 's the great irony . 
  you have kids saying `` fuck you boomers , you 're the reason i ca n't get a job ! '', 
  - but then in the next breath , they say `` yes to unlimited immigration !, 
  lol , if an immigrant takes your job , then work harder , dummy !, 
  '' , and then in the next sentence they whinge again about having to work 24/7 , and still not making enough money to even afford rent , let alone have children or anything . 
  christ they ca n't even add two and two together . 
  no need to be employ passive-aggressive sarcasm my friend , we can have a reasonable debate .
