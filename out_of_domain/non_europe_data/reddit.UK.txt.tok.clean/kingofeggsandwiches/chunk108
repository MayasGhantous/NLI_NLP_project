  personally i 'd say that mama is the german word for mama , not mom , but whatever . 
  exactly, 
  actually we have n't been invaded since 1066 little one !, 
  you 're quite a handy source of resources when we blow all of ours fighting bad guys though . 
  ok , but did you know hand is the german word for hand ? 
  in deepest bavaria the normal german word for mother is schwester . 
  ouch right in the feels . 
  it 's his assumption that a word like mama that virtually any european language speaker would understand needs explaining that it i was trying to poke fun at . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j66rutktxu4&amp;t=38m34s ), 
  also to clarify this once and for all :, 
  ** english : ** mama ** german : ** mama ** italian : ** mama ** linguala : ** mama ** romanian : ** mama ** swedish : ** mama ** arabic : ** mama ** bulgarian : ** mama ** dutch : ** mama ** polish : ** mama ** russian : ** mama . 
  ergh but it 's not a german word , it 's like the universal word for mother . 
  it 's about as german as the word pizza . 
  i was never trying to claim it was n't a word in use in germany , it 's just not a germanic word that needs explaining . 
  you were the guys who jumped on me saying it is a german word just because it 's in duden . 
  anyway i agree this nitpicking is getting dull . 
  maybe a generational thing ? 
  probably too prescriptivist for modern education, 
  i 'm stealing that one for my english students . 
  no but perhaps the dumbest, 
  what the fuck you on about . 
  the most successful military of all time you mean ? 
  i 'd take australia or canada over us any day , those guys know how to build nice successful societies . 
  america is just a country of excess . 
  it took in a massive number of people in immigration because they are not a proper nation caring for each other , they are more like a business where the have-nots are n't important to the haves . 
  bound together only by being under the same government system , rather than the brotherly bond most nations have . 
  america is not a people , but many peoples inhabiting the same space . 
  their society values money over everything , that 's why they pay low wages , do n't allow unions , do n't provide healthcare , crappy welfare system , allow any idiot to own a gun , authoritarian police force , harsh criminal punishment with a terrible plea bargaining system . 
  it 's only successful in material terms , in other regards its shit . 
  changing rooms and toilets would be unisex i imagine . 
  god what a clusterfuck of a thread . 
  as someone who works in tefl i can tell you that 90 % people that thread is bullshit . 
  british english pretty much owns the world of foreign language teaching because it always historically has , from this we moved on to teaching multiple forms of english never proscribing one above the other . 
  there was never a point when general american was considered proper because the notion that a proper accent exists is outdated itself . 
  still most tefl books are written in british english spelling wise . 
  when we do listening exercises with beginners they tend to use rp ( or the modern equivalent ) as the most easy to pick up , then when it 's more advanced students you 'll hear a myriad of accents including , most importantly , the accents of people who are n't traditionally considered native speakers , places like india and some european accents , alongside the usual ones like australian , american , and irish . 
  the truth is that when you teach non-anglophone speakers english they are going to be using it the most with other non-anglophones . 
  a conversation between a german and a dutch person will almost always be in english . 
  the level of interaction they will have with a native speaker will always be dwarfed by the amount of interaction they have with non-native speakers in english . 
  generally the focus is on being understood and not on trying to sound like you 're from one part of the world or another . 
  personally i 'm extremely happy if some foreign speaker achieves anything like a native accent , regardless of where that accent is from , it usually has a lot more to do with where they 've spent time living and exposure rather than what the teacher tells them . 
  as a briton i find boston not too bad . 
  [ this one is sexy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwvonjxjuo4 ), 
  no i 'm afraid not in my experience . 
  i personally find the american accent rather grating . 
  i 'd put it down to two things , nasal sounds and the letter - r. nasal sounds are a big no no in british english , the french fucking love them , but to us they sound whiny . 
  there 's also the - r sound that is most silent in the uk apart from a few regional variations . 
  it 's especially true when talking to american women , they can be so grating . 
  the male accent can be less annoying but sometimes is equally bad . 
  what 's funny is the accents like the southern drawl and boston do n't sound as bad to me , whilst often i hear americans complaining about them . 
  it 's the non-standard american accents we actually like , the one that is considered the prestige accent is not nice which is weird . 
  dick van dyke has his own accent , certainly is n't fucking cockney !, 
  i 've got to say i think you guys are worse regarding racism , although it 's hard to generalise . 
  there are parts of europe where there 's very few people who are anything but white . 
  you 'll see some very old fashioned ignorance in some of these places , staring at black people because they do n't encounter them so often and stuff . 
  then you have your hard line right wing racists who probably say that stuff you 've seen , but they 're a tiny minority of the population and most people are very strongly minded against them . 
  however i feel like there is more systemic racism in american unfortunately . 
  not the kind of neo-nazi `` whites are genetically superior '' bullshit ( although you have that as well but it 's the small minority , possibly smaller than europe ) but the kind of racism that creates segregation , black neighbourhoods and white neighbourhoods in different parts of town . 
  it feels like european multiculturalism is more colour blind in this regard , race/ethnicity ( at least by non-racists ) is seen as something that simply does n't matter , and cultural a black or white european will be culturally closer than a black and white american . 
  you guys seem to put a lot of important on race/background as part of your identity , sure you mostly get along , but perhaps because of history you guys are more acutely aware of being different . 
  that 's my thoughts on the matter anyway . 
  that 's a massive generalisation . 
  lots of europe is highly multicultural and integrated . 
  why would you be ? 
  statistically america smokes more than most of europe . 
  i think we 're just more accepting of it so people are more open about it . 
  being anti-english seem to be a reddit thing now . 
  utter crock of shit . 
  imperialism is well in the past . 
  no england did n't invade scotland we unionised peacefully through the joining of royal lineages . 
  scottish kings actually sat the british throne . 
  england did some bad things in ireland , installed loyalists in power and discriminated against the catholics , but no we did n't cause the potato famine , we just did fuck all to help when it happened . 
  no we did n't oppress american colonists , we just wanted you to pay for the 7 year war and you still paid less tax than the average briton . 
  that 's bullshit . 
  nobody will even know you 're american to start with , if they have no english they wo n't know what type of english speaker you are . 
  not saying it never happens but it 's not like you 're guaranteed to take shit for being american if you visit . 
  sure europeans do n't tend to have the same curiosity about americans as europeans often get in america , but that 's because we 're more used to it . 
  come here and act like a grown up and you 'll be fine . 
  plenty of americans live here and are n't subject to abuse . 
  occupying countries with a massive local population and their own sense of national identity and culture always goes so well for the us . 
  surely it would work for a whole continent . 
  they were n't anti-islam , they were anti-islamic immigration , it was mostly reactionary against the paris shootings , 17,000 in country of 80 million is n't that big . 
  not all of them would 've been hardline racists either . 
  anyway like i said there has always been a small minority of right wingers in europe . 
  you are n't talking about pegida then ? 
  because that 's in the news a lot right now so i assumed . 
  it 's not if you 're honest , people are just uptight as fuck it seems . 
  sounds like a dick move to me . 
  the american admissions system sounds reeeaally douchey . 
  i submitted my grades alongside 1000 words on why i found the subject interesting and a bit of padding listing some extracurricular activity and was accepted to a top 10 uk university , in the world top 200 . 
  nobody asked me a single fucking thing about my personal life nor was an interview necessary since the course was n't oversubscribed enough . 
  does n't seem fair to actually evaluate someone as a human being for course admission . 
  exactly this is the definition of a backpfeifengesicht . 
  there 's something about those stupid high eyebrows makes it so eminently slappable . 
  the biggest freaks in the universe play this shit . 
  venti stone !, 
  you mean being the second country to ban slavery after denmark and giving blacks the right to vote in 1726 ? 
  do n't confuse colonisation with slavery . 
  guys it 's just satire , no need to take it so seriously ... 
  bring back the milliard !,
