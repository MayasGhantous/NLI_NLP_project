  i ca n't believe what you 're saying . 
  yes it ** is ** a crime to lie to a court , which she did . 
  you 'd have to be a xenophobic moron to lie as much as she has when you 're innocent , to have so little faith in the system is absurd . 
   how do you know that these lies were n't coming from a naive kid who was trying to avoid trouble in a foreign country ? 
  what does ** foreign ** have to do with anything . 
  again the seeping xenophobia of your position is apparent . 
  she 's not a kid , she was an adult . 
  love how you embellish your narrative . 
   her blaming everyone she could think of is pretty natural . 
  this is laughable ? 
  i know what will help my case , fabricating as much evidence as possible . 
  she is not a naive child . 
  nobody does that . 
   his innocence being proven only by a water-tight alibi only proves how ridiculous the whole case was . 
  oh so telling bad lies proves there was no malice in their intention , that 's most ridiculous justification ever . 
  she could 've put an innocent man in prison . 
   god forbid you , or anyone you know ever gets treated to the injustice of that legal system . 
  i 'd take it over the us one in many situations . 
   that is the legal system you 're defending ? 
  anecdotal suggestions generalised to an entire justice system . 
  this is getting childish . 
  oral sex and cohabitation is still illegal in many places in the us . 
  does this mean every trial there is worthless ? 
  i guess by your logic yes . 
   enjoy your down-votes . 
  oh noes muh internet points . 
  it 's patently obvious that reddit thinks knox is innocent , it 's also a majority american website . 
  the irony is i 'm not saying she 's guilty of what she 's been accused of , but this notion that she 's being persecuted by the italian system is abso-fucking-lutely brainwashing . 
  i love how the us public at large has passed judgement on this . 
  and to think , some americans were butthurt when they didnt get that autistic ufo hacker . 
  except nobody has said that and you guys have a victim complex . 
  this is the pro-america circlejerk, 
  google the real true detective . 
  that 's how it 's spelt, 
  large spineless jellies made of plasma lying on their backs . 
  alternatively fat cowardly lazy gooey pussies . 
  mccoys have shit flavours , chicken , ham and mustard , flame grilled , bbq ribs , bacon sizzler . 
  they all have the nasty chemical fake meat flavour . 
  if i did n't have the wrapper i would n't even know what they were meant to be . 
  if i wanted something that tasted of meat i 'd buy some fucking meat . 
  walkers are the best because they mostly stick to proper core flavours like ready salted , salt and vinegar , cheese and onion , prawn cocktail and worcester sauce . 
  whenever stupid gimmick flavours like bolognese come out they get shunned . 
  anything else can get to fuck . 
  doritos , being nachos , have their own flavours , cool blue , cheese and spicy all work well on a nacho but would be dreadful on crisps . 
  got me at the bagpipes, 
  you 're going to miss out on some quality posts on [ perry production ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ws2hvnkpyma ) . 
  as much as i hate to admit it some colonial friends explained gridiron to me and it 's not actually that complicated . 
  way less complicated than i expected anyway . 
   nationalistic inferiority complex, 
  nice that you have to post this on an alt account, 
  you are pk2346 and i claim my five pounds . 
  also the advert is funny , it 's the butthurt comments that are hilarious sas . 
  ok / u/xvampireweekend nobody cares, 
  cos you like having sockpuppets that agree with you ( and write the same way as you ), 
  i 'm sending the queen to sort you out post haste . 
  ( actually no , because we all know you 're / u/xvampireweekend, 
  he was the \u00fcberhalsbartmensch, 
  i feel like the clich\u00e9s about my school are different to the clich\u00e9s about other people in this thread 's schools . 
  to answer the question no we did n't play soggy biscuit or sodomise each other . 
  twice the accounts , twice the trolling . 
  let 's face it that 's why you come here . 
  you actively enjoy espousing opinions people here disagree with because you did n't get enough hugs as a child . 
  just like men , all women have assholes . 
  sadly this joke would n't work where i 'm from :( there 's difference between ass and arse . 
  just like the `` why 's six scared of seven ? '', 
  does n't work either `` seven et nine ? '', 
  what ? 
  i do n't have a stick up my ass about america . 
  in fact i recently watched the superbowl and it was n't bad . 
  as an ex-pat many of my friends are american . 
  i just do n't like the pro-american circlejerk that so frequently appears on reddit , so i make fun of it . 
  nothing against americans or their culture , i just do n't tolerate nationalistic morons . 
  your very soul, 
  i guess this has a slight point but it 's also kinda douchey and there 's a lot of be said for learning the fundamentals in school . 
  if everything was practical people would find it harder to pass over those skills to other things . 
  try doing taxes without first basic mathematics . 
  do you think studying difficult literature does n't help overall literacy ? 
  i agree politics and the monetary system should be covered more ( but it 's also a massively sensitive subject since it causes friction in communities with differing opinions and can leave educators open to accusations of political manipulation ) . 
  yes i think we should be teaching languages at an earlier age , but fyi most people acquire decent ( not fluent ) english in non-english speaking countries because they do n't have much choice . 
  not necessarily because they 're particularly interested in anglophone culture even , but because if they go virtually anywhere where their native language is n't spoken then english will be the primary lingua franca . 
  how many germans are good at french ? 
  how many polish people speak good german ? 
  admittedly more than speak a decent second language in most anglophone countries but it 's not a huge share of people who do . 
  anglophone countries should realistically be aiming to increase the rate of second language speakers to the same level as people speaking languages other than english in non-anglophone countries . 
  you ca n't compare a lingua franca l2 with an ordinary l2 . 
  in many ways his argument to learn another language flies in the face of his practical subjects argument since realistically you wo n't need french to help you that much unless you take a very specific line of work or move to france . 
  funny how he complains of only being fluent in one language and then contradicts himself by mockingly saying `` mais , oui , je parle un peu de fran\u00e7ais '' as if that were useless , he probably should have studied harder in french lessons . 
  yes learning basic legal stuff , human rights , and taxation , but you get a classroom of young kids who ca n't even get excited by reading relatively accessible classics like hemmingway and steinbeck to be interested in law , tax and human rights . 
  i guess he has a point about learning more about first aid , the signs of illness and mental health , but again these are sensitive topics that have to be covered carefully . 
  do you really want to worry a bunch of 14 year olds with the possibility of terminal illnesses . 
  how does one help a friend with mental illness ? 
  get them to a professional is the answer , what do you expect to be a mental health professional by the time you leave school ? 
  even first aid has to be taught carefully , do you want some over enthusiastic teenager breaking their friend 's ribs with compressions when they 've just passed out from too much booze . 
  worst of all this video seems to totally absolve anyone of having to learn anything by themselves ever . 
  if you do n't know these things go fucking learn about them . 
  we have a nigh on infinite wealth of knowledge at our finger tips these days , far more than any generation before us , and we 're complaining we were n't spoon fed it as children . 
  seems like a stupid position to me . 
  there are websites where you can learn languages interactively , and groups with whom you can speak that language over skype that are full of native speakers . 
  you know how our grandparents learnt languages ? 
  from a book , translating the bible or the iliad line after line until they had it all to heart .
