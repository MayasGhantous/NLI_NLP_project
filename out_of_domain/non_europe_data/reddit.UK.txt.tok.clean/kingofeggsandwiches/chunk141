  yours was in how many parts of the world hear the name america they think bombs , tanks , fighter jets and war . 
  ah to be european , living further north than most canadians and still never seeing more than a foot or two of snow . 
  god surely smiles upon our peoples . 
  what amazes me if the amount of americans who wo n't drink the water anywhere . 
  they can be standing in a bar on swiss glacial mountain when skiing and be like , no ice in my mineral water please . 
  ffs where do you think that mineral water comes from ? 
  in the uk paki is becoming like the n-word . 
  only pakistanis can use it . 
  and i once ruined a day or two of holiday eating some bad fish in spain . 
  does n't mean i never ate fish on holiday again . 
  many european countries have better water than most of america . 
  yeah but you can look that kind of shit up . 
  it surprises me how paranoid some american tourists are though . 
  that 's all . 
  i understood at word !, 
  apparently grenze also means boundaries in danish . 
  ok but what she says does n't even make sense . 
  `` challenge his side that results in her desire for the softer side ? '', 
  what the even fuck ? 
  literal word salad , i have no idea what she means . 
  what she says makes no sense at all . 
  challenge his side that make makes her result in the desire for his softer side ? 
  what ? 
  ok but it can also mean limit in german , sounds very similar . 
  you just bought 1000 litre milk !, 
  trials : frontier , some people hate it because it 's not comparable to a real trials game but personally i find it the perfect time waster on the underground that you just play for ten minutes . 
  i have other games , for example gta : san andreas which i 'm about halfway through , however this requires sound and ca n't easily be played in 10 minutes , and flight control , which is a fun game but it 's the same every time and gets old pretty quick . 
  i also have the simcity mobile app which is just a shitty pay to win waste of time . 
  trials is also kinda pay to win but if you 're only paying it for 10-20 minutes who the fuck cares if it makes you wait a day or two for upgrades to be effective . 
  it 's only really pay to win if you 're overly invested and impatient . 
  really , i was rooting for him to kill mel gibson the bloody oath breaking traitor . 
  some people ca n't take a joke :(, 
  that sounds like the opposite of fifty shades to me and more like every romantic comedy ever written . 
  here do you want to sign my sex contract ? 
   now , the question is are there any brits here that find this a bit disturbing ? 
  no , those are n't pornographic magazines . 
  in modern times any 10 year old in the western world could get their hands on pictures of equal sexual nudity . 
  in fact we regularly use such images for advertising , as well as allowing pop stars to walk around in bikinis on television that is often viewed by children . 
  you got no fans !, 
  lots of chelsea hatred in here . 
  it 's one of the biggest clubs in the uk with millions of fans around the world . 
  some of them will be racist pricks . 
  most chelsea fans are neither racists nor rude cunts . 
  do n't make out like this is a chelsea specific problem , shitting on chelsea seems to be becoming a national pastime . 
  edit : i know about the history of the chelsea headhunters and the ties with right wing groups , the no surrender and anti-catholic stuff too , but that was a long time ago and still a tiny minority of fans . 
  what you 're seeing here most likely has no connection to that , and is just an isolated group of racist fans and could 've easily been any british football team . 
  99 % of chelsea fans were nothing to do with that minority of racists , therefore it 's pretty inaccurate to portray chelsea as a more racist club than any other . 
  i used to smoke way too much the point i was just using it a crutch , staying high almost all the time and never wanting to go without it which impacted my life negatively . 
  so i just quit one day , had a shitty couple of weeks , exercised so i could sleep and stuff and was fine . 
  went about 8 months without touching it again . 
  since then i 've smoked a little bit here and there , never letting it get the better of me . 
  now i live somewhere where it 's hard to find and the police are stricter on it than where i was before so its not worth going to any great lengths to track it down . 
  that said i would n't mind having a little bit to toke once in a while as an alternative to drinking at a social event but not having it is n't a big deal . 
  well done on inventing a way to share data sets between universities and research facilities this , however , is the web . 
  them splinters . 
  a moment 's silence for our fallen brothers . 
  knock 'n' run for me in the midlands too . 
  er if you drink one drink every 45 minutes over time you are definitely not in a fit state to drive , legally or otherwise . 
  more like a lisp to be honest . 
  if they want gutteral - ch they just write - ch . 
  pipe down frenchie or we 'll be sending the fleet ... 
  the jelly in the field ? 
  even if she 's not great to look at , every girl deserves a prince !, 
  especially tumblrina aspiring novelists . 
  the german test is a bit whack if you ask me . 
  i mean yes it 's very proficient like so many things here in germany , but it 's also like many things in germany is structured as to force you to spend cash and create guaranteed jobs for people undermining a free market system . 
  i mean you ** have to ** have so many hours and it ** has to ** be with a someone with the licence to teach driving . 
  rather than being purely meritocratic and going on performance . 
  fortunately i got my licence in the uk where the test was also expensive and a bitch to pass ( one hour of city driving and only a few minor non-dangerous mistakes allowed ) , but at least i was free to get in practice hours with my rents to minimise the cost of driving lessons ( probably ended up doing 25 hours with an instructor ) . 
  i passed 4th time which was shitty , since you pay per test , but it was my own fault . 
  point is if you pass first time with minimal professional instruction it 's only going to cost half of what it costs in germany . 
  even with my fails it still did n't cost the equivalent of 1400 euros total , probably around 1000 . 
  if i 'd failed that many times in germany it would 've cost even more than 1400 euros since i 'd have had to go through the system again . 
  as much as i admire german efficiency , some of the regulation here borders on theft , justified on the grounds of keeping up standards but really just propping up antiquated systems giving some people a licence to print money . 
  i 'm looking at you maklers , gema , zdf and ard . 
  oh and to add the uk has less driving fatalities than here in germany , which i 'd put down to the german driving style being so rule orientated rather than cooperative . 
  i 'd like to add nf ( national front ) , bnp ( british national party ) and edl ( english defence league ) ... 
  ah the young turks , the universal symbol for close the video before some whiny cunts speak for 10 minutes about 30 seconds of actual footage . 
  our cars are also made more efficiently with wrenches *, 
  amazed you got a meal there for less than a fiver , especially living in the deep south . 
  i would say for letting any moron get a gun , thus meaning cops need guns making them more paranoid because they 're more likely to die . 
  stupid notion that the average citizen needs access to deadly weaponry . 
  countries where gun ownership is not prolific have far far less homicides despite people having access to knives and stuff because it 's just much harder to kill someone that way . 
  all gun ownership does is escalate the whole scenario making nobody safer . 
  amazingly criminals willing to kill people still struggle to find guns in countries where guns are outlawed . 
  like that comedy sketch saying if every bullet cost $ 5000 . 
  only the minority of criminals will use guns . 
  also even the worst criminals avoid it in many countries , because it keeps them safe from being shot themselves and would rather just used regular physical violence to get what they want , safe in the knowledge their victims wo n't be armed either . 
  neither is having a gun to a sane person . 
  people need to realise gun controls do work . 
  not because it stops guys like this getting a gun . 
  black markets are unavoidable . 
  but because it breeds a criminal culture that does n't need to use guns , which is ultimately preferable to one that does . 
  in countries with tight gun laws the only criminal who regularly needs to arm himself is a professional hitman and even then only for a specific purpose . 
  illegal guns are less available , cost more , and often work less efficiently . 
  when the punishment for having a gun is high , and the risk of being shot yourself is lower , carrying is not worth it for most on a simple risk/reward analysis . 
  most crimes can be committed without guns if most other criminals and the general public do n't have guns . 
  mugging someone with a knife or hammer is far smarter . 
  most police in countries with gun control go their whole careers without even drawing it in public , if they do they wo n't fire it . 
  violent crime is lower in all nations with gun control because the police do n't feel threatened all the time , despite what bullshit statistics comparing non-comparable things say ( in the uk for example shouting in someone 's face to intimidate them is recorded as a violent crime ) .
