  and that 's just one rather us centric list . 
  to americans - drinking until you 're falling over once in a while = a ok . social drinking a few times a week or having a couple of glasses of wine with dinner = alcoholic dependency . 
  not that brits are any better , but they ca n't judge anyone since they take the best of both worlds . 
   hat an intellectually dishonest thing to do ; fact is no one in the world has the impact on the fields of philosophy and engineering like germany did in the late 19th century . 
  absolute subjective bullshite , no they did n't that 's all i have to say , germany made some great contributions but to say they made the definitive ones is absolutely your bullshit subjective opinion . 
  truth is that germany fell behind in the 19th century in scientific and engineering contribution , and this is absolutely uncontroversial . 
  meaning we drink cheaply throughout the week and then have a terrible antisocial binge drinking culture at the weekends . 
  i 'm english and i can admit we 're shitty but still we do n't smugly judge other nations for it . 
  honestly , i would just go buy and give them your id . 
  if they check the day then you 'll have to wait til midnight . 
  most people do not check that thoroughly and will only look at the month / year . 
  it 's still illegal to sell you it but worse things happen at sea . 
  i think a fee is bad because it will discourage people from calling if they 're broke , also there 's situations where other people call for someone and they obviously ca n't be made to pay . 
  people might try and play the system by having someone else call an ambulance for them . 
  however i definitely think there should be fines for wasting emergency service resources . 
  a lot of money is wasted because people call out ambulances for the stupidest shit . 
  writing it in a stupid way killed it . 
  i assumed you were ripping on the asian guy because ramsay would n't say foking or wans ... 
  he 's a relatively well spoken british guy wtf were you thinking ?
