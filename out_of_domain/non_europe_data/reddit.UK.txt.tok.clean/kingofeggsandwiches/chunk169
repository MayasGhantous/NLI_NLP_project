  to do such a thing is nothing more than a fuck you to their allies . 
  the quebec agreement was `` reinterpreted '' by the us to include military progress despite not including such in the agreement , the hyde park agreement was `` lost '' on the grounds it was `` improperly filed '' ... 
  that 's the practical stuff . 
  i was talking more theoretically from a research standpoint . 
  we 'd have to assume that had germany got their hands on britain 's research they 'd have conquered britain and therefore would have been in a much stronger position . 
  probably would , it 's basically an exploitative welfare system at this point .

   you also do n't account for the fact that the premier research in nuclear physics was well underway in the usa long before the wwii had begun in europe and that the principals of research in the form of international scientists had already relocated to american universities as faculty members by the 1930s . 
  that 's just false .

  absolutely true , pay more attention .

  wow making something more cheaply , such ingenuity .

  you 're smoking crack if you think you 'll hear `` pure rp '' virtually anywhere in london these days , even amongst he very wealthy . 
  frankly the rp gets more conservative the further away from london you go . 
  what you 'll hear in london is sloane rangery posh london speech but not traditional rp . 
  traditional rp seems to only survive amongst older rp speakers in places like the east midlands where it 's more isolated due regional dialects . 
  these kids definitely speeching a generic south east accent , definitely some vowel fronting noticeable . 
  [ i 'm not here to cite studies ] ( http://lmgtfy.com/?q=american+children+respond+to+british+accents ), 
  acquiesce ? 
  that would be to make the mistake that i was arguing a position . 
  i linked to a news article , from where have you the idea that i have an in depth knowledge or opinion on the study itself ? 
  it 's certainly an indication of your insecurity , be it `` off the top of your head '' or not , that you 've rushed to critique the methodology of a study that has n't even been linked ; lacking , as you are , a single shred of information about it . 
  what you 've written is pure speculation . 
  if you want to critique the study upon which the article i linked is based . 
  go ahead and google it , i 've even done it for you . 
  do n't put the onus on me to contradict your speculative critique of something i never claimed to be knowledgable about . 
  i linked a fucking news article , that 's all . 
  your language is loaded as fuck to be honest . 
  to suggest that you 're not going to acquiesce without further information pretty much tells everyone that you 've made up your mind and taken a position before you 've even seen the study in question . 
  do you realise how biased this makes you ? 
  why do n't you google it , read the study , and then form an opinion on it . 
  cool bit of pop psychology . 
  sorry i do n't idolise ford and the cult of the entrepreneur . 
  pretty sure using a conveyor was n't that radical , yet ford is an american icon so naturally i must be projecting . 
  says you with no facts whatsoever, 
  i 'm just saying you 'll find more old fashioned rp speech amongst the old people in places lie cambridge and oxford , and various pockets rural communities from norwich to wiltshire , than you 'll hear in london due being isolated from the modern changes in what would be considered a prestige accent generally . 
  when people parody a posh london accent it 's drawn out with people saying things like `` daaaarling '' , when traditional rp is far more clipped . 
  outside of london you 'll hear diphthongs like / \u028a\u0259 / in pure and cure , / tj / for tune and / dj / for dune , you wo n't hear / \u0252\u028a / in fold and gold , but the traditional / \u0259\u028a / . 
  all things that have become increasingly rare in posh speakers surrounded by the more generic south east speakers . 
  one being pronounced / w\u0252n / instead of / w\u028cn / . 
  also fyi the queen does retain these traditional elements , and cameron only some of them , but the average posh londoner / sloaney does not . 
  traditional speaker : / w\u028cn fa\u026ands \u00f0\u0259t pj\u028a\u0259 g\u0259\u028ald me\u026aks \u0259 g\u028ad tju\u02d0n /, 
  average london posho : / w\u0252n fa\u026ands \u00f0\u0259t pj\u0254\u02d0 g\u0252\u028ald me\u026aks \u0259 g\u028cd t\u0283u\u02d0n da\u02d0li\u014b /, 
  i 'm sorry but what you 've said is simply not correct . 
  these are all well known changes in what we could call the prestige dialect of the uk . 
  changes that are simply more prominent in london speakers than more isolated ones . 
  we can check what the queen says [ quite easily ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuxhvlmpz9i&amp;t=48 ) . 
  sounds like / \u0259\u028ald / to me and certainly nothing like / \u0252\u028ald / . 
  if you still use the / \u028a\u0259 / diphthong you are in the minority . 
  what you say personally is n't really relevant . 
  obviously the daaarling thing is a parody , but a parody based in reality , there really is a rah rah london accent that does n't really resemble rp at all , and tends to mean that london is n't the best place to hear true rp accents . 
  firstly i think you 're wrong about academics calling it rp , they seem to have differing opinion on this . 
  it depends on a lot , when it comes to the new standard southern , an accent of english that reflects these changes i 've mentioned , people like wells might call it modern rp , others like rosewarne and coggle might call estuary english or a conservative sub-category of it , others might simply call it standard southern english english . 
  however the true rah rah accent that includes things like saying / ja\u02d0 / for yeah and so on i do n't think falls into the same category as standard southern english . 
  we must be careful not to conflate the two . 
  both accents show the types of changes i noted earlier , but rah rah has further elements that attempt project an image of being upper class without actually containing the traditional elements that historically would 've been associated with that class . 
  furthermore i do n't think rah rah has the same prestige that conservative rp once held , because it 's not really imitated anywhere outside the circles in which it 's used . 
  standard southern english could be considered the new rp in that it 's considered relatively neutral ( at least locale wise ) and reasonably desirable , however people differ on where to place this new standard . 
  we get into murky territory with disagreement about what standard truly is . 
  for example some say the new standard is estuary english , however i think that most descriptions of it have elements that people find undesirable , especially ones outside the south east . 
  there 's almost a hierarchy of changes , for example / \u0252\u028a / replacing / \u0259\u028a / before dark l is basically standard now to the point that if you use / \u0259\u028a / in a southern standard accent , ( leaving accents like liverpudlian where the change has not occured out the debate ) especially if you 're young , you sound frightfully out of touch or even foreign , whereas / \u0254\u02d0 / replacing / \u028a\u0259 / is totally neutral and nobody will care if you say / \u02c8t\u028a\u0259.r\u026ast / or / \u02c8t\u0254\u02d0.r\u026ast / , however other changes such as vowel fronting , merging dune - june and tune - choon , and t-glottalling are n't perceived as particularly desirable . 
  personally i think there 's a habit of `` over-estuarising '' the new standard description amongst some . 
  it 's certainly true that the influence of ee and london accents is growing , but i think its growth is more felt in non-prestige accents , for example i 've even heard young brummies replacing / \u03b8 / with / f / , prevocalic / \u00f0 / with / d / and intervocalic / \u00f0 / with / v / , all in combination with the existing elements of brummie speech such as / \u0254\u026a / for / a\u026a / , however these were n't prestige speakers . 
  ultimately ca n't agree that the rah rah speech is correctly described as rp because rp has many definitions however almost none of them fit the bill . 
  if we define rp as the prestige accent then i disagree , rah rah is only prestige to a small group of local speakers . 
  if we define rp as the neutral accent then no , rah rah is anything but neutral . 
  if we define rp by it 's traditional conservative definition as bbc or the queen 's english , again no , it 's a long way from the way these have been spoken historically . 
  in my personal opinion if any accent is the new rp ( by the definition of being desirable , geographically neutral , and associated with higher class/education ) it 's a relative neutral standard southern dialect that combines the elements of old rp that have n't become taboo ( e.g / tj / and / dj / ) with elements of ee that are n't considered low class ( e.g / \u0252\u028a / for fold ) . 
  the main difference however is that this is a way of speaking shared by both many upper and middle class speakers , quite an interesting phenomenon really since i believe it reflects people 's desire to no longer sound `` upper class '' or `` middle class '' but to sound more generically educated and neutral . 
  it 's this very phenomena that has probably given rise to rah rah speak , since this accent is emulated by the few who do want to sound `` upper class '' and distinguish themselves amongst a community where this new standard english is the norm , yet do n't want to sound out of touch by imitating a more conservative style . 
  edit : i made some mistakes in my phonetic script , fixed now . 
  i added some information in at the end of my comment that might address this .
