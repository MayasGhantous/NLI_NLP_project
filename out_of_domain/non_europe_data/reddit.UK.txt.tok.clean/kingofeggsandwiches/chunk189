  women who never grow out of the princess mentality are always going to end relationships badly . 
  problem is it can be hard to tell when you 're still in that lovey honeymoon period since your naturally make a fuss of each other at that point . 
  i mean for fuck sake they have a kid together !, 
  [ it 's got nothing on this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtqsv3q7rru ), 
  better still there are like 4 videos . 
  and i just expressed it , do n't call the objectivity police on me !, 
  / thread, 
  rural jury !, 
  i do n't think it 's an accident . 
  who said anything about damning !, 
  it 's not particularly bad because it 's so common , people have sexual fantasies , however if you asked people about these desire they 'd deny their existence , exposing the hypocrisy inherent in society . 
  god i ca n't tell you how irate i became when i first saw one of `` keep calm '' things that did n't even keep the format . 
  it 's bad enough we 've been subjected to hundreds of proper ones . 
  now i have to see `` keep calm i 'm a mummy '' , it 's torturous !, 
  you could 've been youtube famous !, 
  sigh , i tend to feel the same whenever a colonial speaks our sacred tongue , nevertheless for those unfamiliar with the scouse dialect . 
  girl 1 : on me own , on me own , on me own, 
  bystander woman : listen !, 
  listen to me !, 
  i 'm not getting involved or nothing but i 'm just saying to you i would n't stand here whether or not ... and watch a girl get stuck . 
  girl 1 : < interrupting  laa obviously not , obviously not . 
  listen , we 're not going to beat her up . 
  girl 2 : i 'll beat her up happily ... 
  i 'll beat her up the little grass ... < shouting  little graaassss !, 
  girl 1 : stop it girl , get away from her , they 're going to bring bizzies . 
  ( police ), 
  girl 2 : look at them hiding in there ... let me record this ... come on it 's on video ... 
  girl 3 : it 's recording . 
  girl 2 : ah you muppet !, 
  l *** , look at you hiding !, 
  on video !, 
  you muppet !, 
  on video !, 
  girl 1/3 : what 's he going to say ? 
  girl 2 : oh my god !, 
  you 're on video , you 're on video !, 
  girl 1/3 : let me video her over the counter ... 
  girl 1/3 : got the slag !, 
  you 're dead !, 
  you 're dead !, 
  girl 2 : you 're getting videoed you little fucking tramp !, 
  you little fucking muppet !, 
  you think you 're all big and hard now ? 
  you 're getting recorded you little slag , and it 's s ****** w ***** i 'm going to kill you !, 
  girl 1/3 : i 'm s ****** p ******* i 'm going to punch your head in . 
  you little muppet !, 
  if anyone with better skills in scouse wants to fill in gaps go right ahead . 
  edit : thank you to / u/awesome182 for the corrections . 
  i 'm only an intermediate in scouse , but not fluent, 
  that 's one of those bullshit myths that gets spread around and regularly debunked on reddit . 
  neither american nor british are `` proper '' ( who decides what 's proper ? ), 
  and both are significantly different from how english was spoken in the past . 
  i mean if we get deeper into it there 's not just one form of american or british english ( this video should be proof of that , or do these girls sound the same as patrick stewart to you ? ), 
  so your statement does n't even make sense . 
  it 's because liverpool is a port . 
  lobscouse was a stew eaten all around the baltic and north sea . 
  since many of these sailors would be regularly going through liverpool it became a dish there too . 
  thus scousers . 
  well it 's one of the biggest ports in the uk , you 'd be hard pushed to find a north american of european descent who did n't have a relative who went though there . 
  i mean it was probably eaten in other ports too like portsmouth but it 's only there that it gained notoriety , probably due to have a high number of immigrants and being an impoverished region . 
  do fuck off you ignorant cunt . 
  you should do the world a favour and take yourself out the gene pool . 
  which words ? 
  slag = whore , slut , grass = informant , snitch , muppet = popular american puppets which are used to mean idiot/fool in the uk , on me own = on my own , alone . 
  tramp = homeless person , but when aimed at a female often means something like dirty whore . 
  bizzies = police, 
  well as with every accent it 's not like they all speak with an accent this thick in that area . 
  most of them would just [ sound like this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsybwvdk51g&amp;t=4m0s ) which is n't that hard to understand . 
  as with anywhere though the people who are most isolated from outside influence speak with the thickest accents . 
  like hill billies , people in deprived inner city communities do n't get out of their own communities very often leading to the dialect drifting towards more extreme levels of variance from standard . 
  i 'll also add that ghetto kids in the uk tend to play up their accent as a point showing off their identity of being working class and from a certain region , plus they do n't have to work and therefore need n't talk in a way non-local people will find within a tolerable level of comprehensibility . 
  i do n't know why those programmes and films would be hard to understand . 
  this however is very thick dialect , they said :, 
  girl 1 : on me own , on me own , on me own, 
  bystander woman : listen !, 
  listen to me !, 
  i 'm not getting involved or nothing but i 'm just saying to you i would n't stand here whether or not ... and watch a girl get stuck . 
  girl 1 : < interrupting  laa obviously not , obviously not . 
  listen , we 're not going to beat her up . 
  girl 2 : i 'll beat her up happily ... 
  i 'll beat her up the little grass ... < shouting  little graaassss !, 
  girl 1 : stop it girl , get away from her , they 're going to bring bizzies . 
  ( police ), 
  girl 2 : look at them hiding in there ... let me record this ... come on it 's on video ... 
  girl 3 : it 's recording . 
  girl 2 : ah you muppet !, 
  l -- , look at you , hiding !, 
  hiding !, 
  on video !, 
  you muppet !, 
  on video !, 
  girl 1/3 : what 's he going to say ? 
  girl 2 : oh my god !, 
  you 're on video , you 're on video !, 
  girl 1/3 : let me video her over the counter ... 
  girl 1/3 : got the slag !, 
  you 're dead !, 
  you 're dead !, 
  girl 2 : you 're getting videoed you little fucking tramp !, 
  you little fucking muppet !,
