  pronounce your fucking - th 's , they 're not fucking - f 's ok . 
  i think you 're confused . 
  the vowel in `` beer '' is not what you would call a long - e in english , because it 's the diphthong / \u026a\u0259 / , same as in `` beard '' or `` fierce '' . 
  something called the `` long - e '' does exist in english words like `` meet '' and `` bee '' , marked by / i\u02d0 / . 
  that being the - e you hear in the alphabet song , rather than the short - e you hear in words like `` set '' and `` bed '' . 
  this sound also exists in french in a word like `` r\u00e9gie '' / \u0280e\u0292i /, 
  but the wikipedia is n't making a mistake when it equates '' \u00e9 '' to / e / . 
  furthermore / e / is present in the word `` stay '' . 
  the english word `` stay '' would be rendered as / ste\u026a / , `` d\u00e9sol\u00e9 '' as / dez\u0254le / . 
  if anything an english speaker with poor french speaking accent might be pronouncing `` d\u00e9sol\u00e9 '' as / de\u026az\u0254le\u026a / , but this would mean they are making the vowel too long and not too short , turning it into a diphthong that 's travelling towards the / \u026a / sound , as found in the word `` sit '' / s\u026at / . 
  when i was a little kid we did n't have a computer in the house , when i became a bit older you could n't go on the internet for a long time because someone might be trying to call the house . 
  i take multivitamins and work-out , merely because i know i wo n't eat a recommended diet getting all my rda of everything otherwise . 
  preferably i 'd eat a better balanced diet and would n't need them but i do n't . 
  i 'll probably eat a yoghurt for breakfast , a sandwich for lunch and some meat and veg for dinner . 
  i wo n't get my 5 a day so it seems to make sense . 
  i disagree , all this could have already happened and people reject it , they scorn internet media and find solace in some absurd reassurance that programmed television is somehow more relevant . 
  the thing that determines your timeline is the general public 's willingness to embrace a new and better way of things . 
  how long this will take however is up to how stubborn people are not technology . 
  personally i stopped watching television in 2006 , i started again in 2010 however because i wanted to keep in touch with what the television watching public are aware of , despite watching most of it online . 
  it 's coming ... 
  i hear it 's big in europe, 
  never going to happen , you 're going to lose to brazil and germany just like the rest of us . 
  it 's just rugby for girls with adverts every 3 seconds . 
  sounds awful . 
  if history has taught us anything , it 's that military success against germany only increases the likelihood of losing to them on penalties in the semi-finals . 
  no brainer , potential cost of risk far outweighs the potential roi on investment of the sum equal to the cost of insurance . 
  obviously just do n't buy volcano insurance if the nearest volcano is 3000 miles away . 
  assess risk , buy insurance accordingly . 
  you must be fun at parties . 
  i 'm angry at you for putting a - p in warmth, 
  i disagree , plenty of rubgy players weigh 20 stone and hit just as hard . 
  american football is boring and you stop every 3 minutes for a breather . 
  your youtube research is meaningless . 
  just [ watch ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwilrewptvs ) , direct hits to the body with hard torsos , guys going up in the air , none of this padding nonsense , desperate grabs they are not . 
   ask not what your country can jew for you , ask what you can jew for your country, 
  when i did it was certainly more lively than christchurch looks, 
  farage is so bigoted he thinks that everywhere else in europe is like hell on earth , what with the absence of good old fashioned britishness . 
  thus the entirety is just dying to move here and queue in the rain for frequently late buses . 
  sitting in the sun drinking beer and eating ice cream on your days off in some quaint quarter of the mainland whilst tanned attractive members of the opposite ( or same ) sex stroll the promenade ? 
  clearly a fate worse than death . 
  fuck me harder than a jewish prostitute you piece of flesh ? 
  ours was fun until we gave it a bath :(, 
  we were listening to genuinely good dubstep intermixed with jump up and liquid dnb in the uk in the mid 2000s . 
  america kinda ruined dubstep :(, 
  is n't the uk technically scandinavian ? 
  but makes no sense , air balloons would n't float , so how would the soviets see them in the air . 
  surely they 'd need to be helium balloons . 
  wow , then the last guy said thank you thought he was overreacting , but seriously thank you for this game , kept me up til 5am you bastard .

  who sold the book to albert einstein for 100 shillings . 
  if the entire rest of the world worked together and just straight up ignored america it would just be a matter of time before the us was weak enough to be taken by force . 
  with absolutely no outside trade the us could probably survive but left this way for 5 years and it would be considerably weakened . 
  most the population might not starve but they be left eating restricted quantities of food . 
  oil could still be found but it would be incredibly expensive and transport would be limited . 
  the population would be massively dissatisfied with the state of affairs and could lead to political instability . 
  the us would probably do better than most countries without international cooperation but it would still be fucked , no modern society can maintain its current level of prosperity without the international community and access to foreign labour markets . 
  really now we 're far better dressed than you , we are after all european , not these people though . 
  i mean worst dressed of us probably are wearing outmoded american fashions , but the better dressed are n't wearing american fashion at all , with good reason . 
  somehow these people are still more fashionable and attractive than [ these ones ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxraqyiqx-m ),

  a king in the north is the king of the north . 
  they were just saying a king in the north because the were endorsing the idea of a king in the north . 
  stop being so pendantic pendant !, 
  johnny in `` the room '' ... why lisa ? 
  why ? 
  mark you were his friend :(, 
  regardless , the king in the north is still the king of the north , by the grace of the words in the meaning of the english language , pendant .

  your fedora is showing . 
  you need a cat to catch a bat ; o, 
  ` wrong ' ` proclaim ' ` ad hominem ' neckbeard definitely showing . 
  anti virus is always relevant . 
  ` semantics ' are also always relevant . 
  titles are descriptors after all . 
  even if the canon prefers the ` in ' title . 
  correcting someone like ` of ' was somehow incorrect is the act of a dumb fan boy redditor whoo writes like they 're trying to project intelligence with canonical knowledge and pompous words . 
  what does it matter what they call him . 
  neckbeard fan boys like you suck the fun out of things . 
  `` of the '' `` in the '' does n't fucking matter . 
  grrm ca n't write for shit anyway . 
  i just think you 're an arsehole for `` correcting '' that guy , but whatever i 'm sure your got knowledge is a useful life skill . 
  got to run now `` musts needs '' . 
  stop them before they implement a communist dictatorship , eat bacon . 
  that 's not banning ritually slaughtered meat , it 's just banning eating pork . 
  also jesus in the new testament pretty much abolishes the law of the old testament . 
  thing is , it serves meat manufacturers and food retailers to not say anything . 
  observant muslims will be aware of where they certainly sell halal meat , and if in doubt will ask if it is . 
  non-muslims will be blissfully unaware that it 's anything but regular meat . 
  if everything is labelled then it could cause a split in the market , muslims food interests do n't want this because it could negatively impact sales . 
  personally i think everyone has a right to know everything about what they 're eating , but it 's clearly not good for business . 
  itt : americans rushing to defend their masculinity rather than just taking it for what it is , a joke ... 
  seriously guys , and you wonder why the rest of the world gives you a hard time ;(, 
  welcome to the american sense of humour . 
  what 's that a joke that is n't entirely serious or realistic ? 
  let 's quickly apply scientific arguments to disapprove it . 
  now let 's go laugh at comedians whose comedy entirely resolves around making fun of their racial stereotypes .
