  ( in these situations both can be used actually ), 
  fyi in british english the conjugation of a verb following a noun depends on the preposition with which that noun would be replaced . 
  `` the team are playing well ''  `` they are playing well '' not `` it is playing well '' . 
  this is a special rule for nouns that represent collectives , which is not the same as ordinary uncountable nouns . 
  `` the sand in the desert is hot ''  `` it is hot '' ( `` are '' does n't work here because it 's an ordinary uncountable noun ) . 
  please understand that there is a difference between ordinary uncountable nouns like `` water '' , `` sand '' , and `` fish '' , and those nouns that are not themselves uncountable , but in the singular always represent a plurality such as `` government '' , `` team '' , and `` army '' which are sometimes known as group nouns . 
  trust me on this i am british and a language teacher , i know how british people speak and what is considered correct . 
  please do n't make comments like :, 
   no one in britain or america , says the government are corrupt . 
  when you obviously do n't know what you 're talking about . 
  your knowledge of english leaves a lot of be desired . 
  for example when you say : -, 
   ` tomorrow when it rains i wo n't go out ' . 
  this has absolutely nothing to do with the future tense and is perfectly correct english . 
  do you realise that `` rains '' in this sentence is a verb ? 
  as in `` i rain '' `` you rain '' `` it rain ** s ** '' ? 
  when `` rain '' is a verb it 's perfectly correct to conjugate it by adding an - s in the 3rd person singular . 
  we could have it in the present simple by saying `` it rains frequently in mumbai '' which represents a recurring event . 
  finally when `` rain '' is a noun , you are partially correct that it is a collective noun and therefore `` there were lots of rains yesterday '' would be considered incorrect in standard british english under strict grammatical rules . 
  however remember that uncountable nouns can be pluralised when they refer to a plurality of types e.g `` the greengrocer 's had a selection of fruits '' `` the sands of the sahara '' `` the rains of the monsoon season are wide and varied '' . 
  there 's a good chance that the people in india are just using some creative licence and being grandiose by referring to the rain in india as `` rains '' . 
  for an example of this check out this song from the popular programme `` game of thrones '' called [ `` the rains of castamere '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3qw8pvyynm ) . 
  you should also note that there is such thing as indian english and that many of the things that are considered normal in ie have either become antiquated in bre and/or ame or are new constructions that have never been standard in either . 
  if you still do n't believe me please check out [ this lesson ] ( https://learnenglish.britishcouncil.org/en/english-grammar/nouns/common-problems-countuncount-nouns ) from the british council , particularly number 5 . 
  no , you are still not getting it . 
  he does n't need a plural point of reference , and he does n't need to mean the tory party or any other specific party , he could mean every member of parliament as well or every civil servant in the whole damn country . 
  just forget about specific parties you 're getting confused by this . 
  if he says `` the government are corrupt '' , he 's more likely to mean the people in government are corrupt . 
  if he says `` the government is corrupt '' he 's more likely to mean the systems of government are corrupt or he could mean the people too , or anything in between . 
  he is free to use either and he 's absolutely not wrong . 
  you are completely wrong in claiming he is wrong . 
  `` the new government are terrible '' is a perfectly legitimate thing to say , all it does is show us that he 's conceiving of the new government as a collective of individuals ( which it is ) . 
  please just give this up , i 'm telling you as someone born and raised in england , with a qualification in the teaching the english language and many years of experience under my belt that he is not wrong . 
  you are wrong . 
  tories is a plural noun anyway so it 's completely relevant . 
  however you can say `` the tory party are corrupt '' and equally you can say `` the government are corrupt '' , because singular governments and singular parties are always made up of individuals , therefore it is always possible to refer to them using a verb conjugated for the plural . 
  you literally can not be wrong in doing this , whether someone elects to use the plural form or the singular form of the verb merely shows us how they are thinking about the subject , there is no rule saying you must conceive of them one way or the other and therefore it 's impossible to be wrong in doing this . 
  think of it this ways `` the new government are corrupt ''  `` they are corrupt '' vs `` the new government is corrupt ''  `` it is corrupt '' . 
  both are absolutely fine , since we can use the substitution `` it '' or `` they '' we are free to use either `` are '' or `` is '' without being incorrect . 
  sometimes one or the other is mandatory e.g `` the audience clap their hands '' , as `` the audience claps its hands '' sounds strange , again `` the team take their seats '' rather than `` the team takes its seat ( s ) '' as the latter sounds strange , but this not one of these cases . 
  however you are correct in saying that `` the high level of rains have caused flooding '' would be considered incorrect under standard british english guidelines . 
   as far as indian english goes , there 's not such thing . 
  while american english grammar has developed through various styles and form such as the chicago manual . 
  no such linguistic / outline grammar exists in india . 
  its mostly a mix of old british english and a lot of it includes poor grammatical form . 
  and poor syntax / diction . 
  this is a crock of shite my friend . 
  a dialect does not have to be standardised and recognised by an organisation in order for it to be considered a form of english . 
  there is no official authority of scots english , hiberno-english and australian english and so on yet they are all recognised forms of the language . 
  it seems to me you just have a hard on for being authoritative which is very old fashioned and silly . 
  i really could n't give a toss whether people use the plural form of an uncountable noun inappropriately or not personally . 
  look chap , you know that guy who ca n't admit he 's wrong and clutches at straws in a pathetic attempt to save face , ultimately only looking more like an idiot for doing so ? 
  that 's you right now . 
  there 's nothing remotely contentious about this whatsoever . 
  i am telling you , with authority , what the rules for british english are , and that 's ** modern ** british english , not some old fashioned rule that 's going out of style . 
  this is simply what is taught to 2nd language speakers around the world . 
  i can also tell you how american english works . 
  in american english the verb form always follows the plurality of the noun it relates to , and is nothing to do with the pronoun that the speaker would prefer to substitute the noun with , this can lead to sentences like `` the team takes its seat as they nervously await the judgement '' , which british english avoids . 
  therefore in ame `` the government is corrupt '' is the only way to make this statement , however i clearly stated at the start that i 'm talking about british english . 
   most british universities for example prefer you use chicago style of grammar . 
  no , they do n't . 
  please do n't make things up . 
   its hardly a crock of shit . 
  you could easily argue those languages in themselves are a derivative of british english and hence there 's no such thing . 
  as far as lack of standardisation in grammar and dialect , that 's merely opinion . 
  please give it up . 
  pick up a book on linguistics and educate yourself . 
  it does n't matter where the form of english is derived from , nobody says stuff like `` x dialect '' does n't exist any more , it 's very offensive to the speakers of that dialect . 
   since you are in the uk try writing a dissertation without using proper form outlined by the correct form / style . 
  well guess what ? 
  i have written a dissertation in the uk at a top 10 university nonetheless , so i can tell you about how that works too . 
  firstly the foremost recognised style is oxford grammar , not chicago , however you are free to write in whichever recognised style you wish provided your submission is consistent within that style . 
  since there are so many international students who may have learnt american english , professors are perfectly willing to accept that , provided there is consistency . 
  referencing is always oxford , but grammar and spelling wise you can use words like `` gotten '' , `` oftentimes '' , and `` specialty '' with no penalty . 
  you are clutching at straws trying to make out as if it were n't plain and simple . 
  in british english it is one way , in american english it 's another way , there 's no room for disagreement on what the various authorities recommend . 
  sure you can say `` i prefer the american style and use that '' just as i can say `` i prefer the british style and use that '' , however you can not deny correctness of the statement under the british style . 
   yes the verb does follow the plural noun . 
  that article pretty much says what i 've just explained to you numerous times . 
   uh yes they do , i do n't know when you went to university . 
  but there is a trend to find a standardised style and there is a clear movement away from the oxford style . 
  maybe in your delusions there is . 
  if you think british universities are going to start using american english you 're living in a dream world . 
  please stop making stuff up . 
   pick up a book on linguistics ? 
  its plenty clear that you ca n't completely go off on a tangent when it comes to grammar . 
  whether you use oxford or chicago , or whichever form of grammar / style the level of grammar and style is pretty consistent . 
  try picking up a newspaper in scotland or australia or anywhere else for that matter . 
  grammar is pretty standard . 
  idioms and expressions may not be but that 's hardly whats in question here . 
   the whole question for what is ` indian ' english leave a lot to be desired for . 
  as far as i am concerned there is no such thing . 
  well in my opinion your nothing but an idiotic language fascist , who are you to tell a native speaker that their internally consistent grammar is `` wrong '' . 
  `` the car needs washed '' may sound wrong to you and me but it 's perfectly acceptable in parts of the us , stop being such an uptight pedant . 
   delusional about what ? 
  the movement towards standardised form of style ? 
  whatever floats your boat son . 
  yes you are delusional about it since no such trend exists . 
   hardly being uptight . 
  by most forms english grammar is pretty standard .
