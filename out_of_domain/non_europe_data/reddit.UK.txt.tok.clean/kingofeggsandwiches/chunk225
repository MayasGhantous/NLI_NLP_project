  there just is n't enough damn poverty here to fuel it , and also a strict and over funded police force and judicial system . 
  get caught and prepare for the geldstrafe . 
  the only time i 've known people have weed is from a mate who sells it on the side to mates only . 
  it 's not a poor thing where i am either , but in a large number of cases poverty pushes the supply side of it . 
  in the uk i could call one of 4 or 5 numbers from about 2pm until 11pm and have it delivered within an hour . 
  these guys literally drive around all day selling weed until they turn their phone off for the evening . 
  they did n't care who you were , they 'd just tell you a street corner and text you when they were 10 minutes away . 
  it was their job , they were professional weed dealers , and everyday they 'd have hundreds of pounds in cash in rolls from making 50 + deals a day . 
  often they were part of a criminal enterprise that might be growing or buying a few kilos every week , when they ran out they 'd just go back to the big guy and he 'd tick them a few ounces and tell them to come back when it was gone . 
  sure i knew guys who did it and had jobs as well , supportive parents , decent cars who sold a bit on the side , but these were the guys who a ) would only sell to people they 'd been introduced to or at least a friend of a friend b ) did n't always have it , half the time they 'd be out of stock , supply exceeded demand even only selling to a select number of people , mostly because they 'd pick up a couple of oz at a time , smoke half of it and sell the rest c ) were unreliable , most the time their phone was off , they were at work , or out with friends , if you wanted it you 'd text a day in advance and see arrange a time the next day , they 'd then turn up 45 minutes late and what you to smoke with them for 15 minutes when they got there . 
  drug dealing at the end of the day is a criminal enterprise , sure you your friendly neighbourhood stoner can sell a bit on the side without much hassle , however ordinary people who get too deep into it end up getting their houses broken into , being threatened with weapons , and risk jail time , why even bother if you 're not a hardened criminal with nothing to lose ? 
  just too much protein man , whatever is a man to do ? 
  that 's correct though strictly speaking . 
  `` to be '' is a linking verb meaning the object is still the nominative case . 
  this is why in old fashioned stuff people will say `` it is i '' not `` it is me '' . 
  it 's not a rule that 's very commonly observed nowadays but i 'm sorry , they were n't wrong , either they 're shit hot on `` proper '' grammar or accidentally spoke correctly . 
  we ate the chicken that were on the roof - we did n't eat the chickens that were n't on the roof . 
  we ate the chickens , which were on the roof - we ate all the chicken and they happened to be on the roof . 
  to out pedant you , it 's the irrealis mood not the subjunctive . 
  it 's just come to be known as subjunctive . 
  the worst thing about grammar is how willing people seem to be to make up rules on the spot in order to appear clever without having the first clue about it . 
  it 's literally the minority of americans who sas mocks being butthurt because someone is calling them out on their shit . 
  thank you for your service !, 
  [ cool story ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpekma9tcvg&amp;t=8s ), 
  rpg and adventure make a really great combo 7/10, 
  thanks op , got spoilt !, 
  it 's ridiculous to say there 's no military training , you learn how cover terrain in formations , you learn how to camouflage a camp , you learn how to dissemble , reassemble and maintain an sa-80 rifle , hell a couple of times we did weekend long training simulations with blank round ammunition , we had to find and make camp , the other group were assigned to find us and ambush us , we then had to wake up , prep , find cover and return fire until the guys in charge felt like we 'd had enough , all in the half light at about 6am in the morning . 
  we also spent plenty of time at the range with pretend guns practising marksmanship . 
  to say it 's not military training is rather silly if you ask me . 
  yes the the bulk of the material learnt was similar to the stuff you learn in scouts , there were many weeks spent on outdoor survival , how to set up a tent , tie knots , how read maps and use a compass , operate a radio , build a fire a stuff like that , but it 's hardly like there 's no crossover between these skills and military skills , not to mention the specifically military skills you learnt on top . 
  the whole thing is approached with the mentality of being as close to real military experience as possible with actually putting kids in danger . 
  honestly i did it for 2 years and really it put me off the idea of ever joining the army to be honest , so it was n't really a bad thing . 
  we had some fun at times with outdoor pursuits and playing soldier but it did make me think why would i put myself through this day in and day out . 
  the thing is without the propaganda element it was really quite a positive experience , it was a relatively inexpensive way to get to experience things that otherwise would n't be accessible to you , yet simultaneously its positivity detaches you from the fact that were you to join the army proper you 'd be expected to actually fight in wars . 
  well it 's just the same but we actually touch guns but only occasionally get to fire blank rounds in them .

  castle doctrine in a country lacking a single legitimate castle . 
  i 'd call that irony , although that seems dangerous nowadays since so many enlightened redditors seems to want to call people out on that nowadays . 
  how is going to iraq and stepping on an ied protecting anyone . 
  it 's a crock of fucking shit is what it is . 
  i 'm not anti-military i 'm anti-war . 
  war should be reserved from genuine threats to sovereignty and peace , not some geopolitical chess piece for toppling regimes that you politicians do n't like . 
  you know how different the world would be without the invasions of iraq and afghanistan ? 
  fuck all . 
  fuck the us marines , their ideology is a retarded one . 
  should n't it be `` this is my and jimmy 's new car '' then ? 
  america is still a third world country when it comes to toilet cubicles . 
  the us is in many ways a jokes , so mockery is apt . 
  please shut up with your jingoistic nonsense . 
  there has n't been a war worth fighting since ww2 . 
  so in mainland china public toilet hygiene is generally very poor , there are also general hygiene taboos that do n't exist in western countries . 
  for example , especially in more rural provinces , people are disgusted by the notion of babies wearing nappies and prefer their children to shit outside when they need to . 
  this is because they 're terrified of faeces coming into contact with the skin in any sense . 
  this fear carries over to the notion of never touching anything a public toilet , it 's just get in and get out without making contact with anything , making this kind of hovering pissing and shitting is coming more and more common in areas frequented by tourists from mainland china . 
  i 'm seeing more and more signs like this in tourist areas sadly . 
  in the last one of these threads there were plenty of testimonies from americans about kids , weirdos , people with mental health problems , looking in on them poop . 
  oh you mean those people who go from living under one dictatorship , to living in a war zone , to living under another dictator soon after the area is no longer occupied by the west . 
  it 's complete and utter bullshit that wars are fought for the liberty of the population living in those countries , utter crap . 
  the peoples in those countries ' quality of life has barely been affected . 
  many have gone from living under the taliban or saddam to living under isis , or some other corrupt regional warlord who pays lip service to the west . 
  you can not actually believe you 're fighting for people 's welfare , it 's ridiculous . 
  saddam and the taliban never `` ruled '' the world , they ruled a pitiful war torn spit of land that just happened to hold some resources that west desire to control . 
  the only reason men fight and die in these places is so old men can see their profits rise and the economy grow . 
  young men who 've barely tasted life , being paid a crappy wage , dying and being broken physically and psychologically so some rich old fucks can buy their second yacht and put their kids through harvard so they can live lives that do n't involve any danger so ever . 
  fuck your delusional patriotism , it 's literally poison . 
  oh shut up you brain dead war monger . 
  it 's this assumption that other countries have an any obligation whatsoever to do what the western powers say that is ridiculous . 
  go join up and waste your life for nothing , see who cares .

  i 've seen kilo bags that are imported in europe , they come in incredible thick industrially sealed vacuum bags that reek of petrol . 
  whoever imports that shit knows what they 're doing . 
  oh and for the record , this was in someone else 's house who just happened to be a dealer , nothing to do with me . 
  you 've got to understand that not everyone is young or in a town with lots of people they know . 
  i think a large number of the people who buy weed online are older folk in more respectable circles who do n't know who to turn to and do n't want to go around sniffing some out . 
  when i was younger in my home town i could get hooked up easily , however now i 'm older , i 've moved a long way for work i would n't know where to start , therefore i 've quit smoking , but i can see someone who were in my situation and did n't want to quit turning to online services . 
  i did n't say it was n't , it 's merely that the person animating and the person narrating may not being collaborating that closely , therefore mistakes can happen . 
  still it 's no excuse because it 's silly to ruin a piece of work that so much effort has gone into with easily remedied sloppiness . 
  it 's from a programme called [ that mitchell and webb look ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km94pcakliw ) , welcome to today 's 10.000 . 
  remember , when you live in a world defined by fox news paranoia and actions films , russia invading a nato state is a real possibility . 
  russia really is just on the brink of marching troops into poland despite it being suicidal and would probably trigger world war three . 
  europe , despite having two nuclear powers and a combined military spending that far exceeds that of russia , would be absolutely powerless to fight back as they do n't have 11 aircraft carriers , and as we all know , the oversized sitting duck ships that require dozens of smaller ships to protect them and can be sunk by 30 year old submarine technology are what really win wars . 
  it 's all the damn commie welfare schemes that let european be lazy living lives of luxury , instead they should be using the military of a form of welfare , creating thousands of jobs for young men who would otherwise be out of work and causing trouble .

  i 'd quite like to hang out there but i really do n't want another fluffy style encounter . 
  i also agree about pleasant valley , i actually find it the easiest place to survive since you can spent 90 % of your time out in the open . 
  it only sucks when you lack some man-made necessity like a gun or knife/hatchet .

  and we 're all glad you 're not in charge . 
  if you kill someone in a car accident you do n't go to jail unless you 're negligent in doing do .
