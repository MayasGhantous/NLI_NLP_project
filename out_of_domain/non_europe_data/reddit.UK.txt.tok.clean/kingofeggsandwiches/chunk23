  now you 're reacting like an american . 
  we beat france germany and italy , i consider that a win . 
   the funniest jokes are the ones that are mostly true , or smartly satirical . 
  just no . 
  this is humour for the unimaginative . 
  shitty observational boredom , the us 's greatest comedy . 
  serious if you think the joke is shit or old just say so , do n't go providing density charts and arguments to `` disprove '' this shit . 
  and they say germans have bad humour . 
  that 's complete bullshit . 
  firstly because it is n't true but also because you should n't equivocate countries . 
  if someone is joking about estonia they should defend themselves , but if ireland or australia has a cheeky pop at the uk nobody goes into serious mode and starts getting so defensive . 
  hell it not like you see latvians complaining about potato jokes . 
  america , land of the insecure . 
  mdma, 
  mine did , i know because some friends would work there . 
  it was n't just for suicide it was for students undergoing pressures that were unhappy and needed to talk with someone . 
  but suicidal people were very common and a big part of the their training . 
  in all my time on reddit i thougt i 'd heard some fucked up things , but you are truly sick . 
  afaik [ america is still winning in obesity ] ( http://www.noo.org.uk/noo_about_obesity/adult_obesity/international ) , followed by mexico . 
  i do n't see any other countries providing fatmobiles in supermarkets . 
  i 'm 5 '11 and 95kg , i lift everyday but i 'm hardly the biggest guy in the gym . 
  apparently i 'm almost obese ? 
  bmi is useless i 'm afraid , i 'm certainly not excessively muscular , could definitely be bigger and still be nowhere near obsessively big . 
  clearly a mrs bouquet , preferring the french - ou in mousse over the proper british one in - mouse, 
  i think it 's come a full circle and it gets confusing . 
  `` nice guys '' used to be the pua term for people who were n't pua guys or what they call `` naturals '' , basically guys who do n't get get laid all the time using their ridiculous strategies . 
  so i always thought it was obviously a was n't a bad thing to be called a `` nice guy '' because it essentially meant you were n't a pua red pill dickhead . 
  but then `` nice guy '' got picked up by tumblrites and their ilk as the kind of people who define themselves as `` too nice '' and blamed that for their lack of success with women , rather than their terrible personalities/bad bo/physically repulsive nature . 
  guys who feel entitled to the romantic interest of women on the grounds that they were nice to them and imed them all the time . 
  exactly the type of guys who would think doing pua to stop being `` too nice '' would be the ideal way to get women 's attention . 
  it 's confusing because you have one group of dickheads using `` nice guy '' as a slur on men who do n't use pua style flirting , and another group using `` nice guy '' on guys who would probably see pua as really cool if they have n't already started subscribing to that ridiculous ideology . 
  it makes no sense i tells ya . 
  i remember when a chav wore one of those hiking jackets that pulled in at the waist , a burberry cap at a 45 degree angle , tracksuit bottoms and rockports . 
  those were the days . 
  ( also we called them kevs and barries in my neck of the woods , female versions were sharons or shazzas ), 
  i saw a facebook post that said `` keep calm , i 'm the maid of honour '' . 
  it does n't even fit the bloody formula . 
  good sleuthing, 
  what sidewalk ? 
  that 's a pavement . 
  scone rhyme with known ? 
  what are you ? 
  satan ? 
  it just means attempted to get some action with . 
  very common expression in the uk . 
  not really , you could try it on and succeed . 
  it 's just you 'd probably just say x got with y in that case . 
  omg i 've been using right click  select open in new tab all this time . 
  this could have saved me a few milliseconds x a million in my life . 
  whhhy ? 
  but it 's not germanic grammar . 
  the normans equally frenchified the grammar and syntax as they did introduce romance words . 
  olde english had a similar word order to germanic languages . 
  that 's why we say `` i want to go home '' = `` je veux rentrer \u00e0 la maison '' , instead of `` i want to home go '' = `` ich will nach haus gehen '', 
  this pisses me off . 
  older drivers never ever indicate off roundabouts . 
  they 'll be going right and keep their right indicator on which makes it looks like they 're going back the way they came . 
  if they 're going straight on they just wo n't indicate at all . 
  everyone over 45 should be made to retake their test so they actually learn the modern rules . 
  to be honest learning a germanic language will teach you just as much . 
  you 're treading grammatically controversial waters !, 
  most tefl teachers speak of present simple , past imperfect , past perfect , past pluperfect and so on as tenses . 
  although you are correct , tense is the form of the verb , the impact of auxiliaries on the semantic value of a sentence is tense + aspect . 
  and still wrong . 
  farther is becoming increasingly rare is british english , which i put down to a combination of non-rhoticity and `` father '' taking a long - a i 'm afraid . 
  i disagree , language users can go screw themselves . 
  proper language usage is a combination of beautification and semantic value . 
  we should all strive to speak in the most beautiful and semantically marked manner possible , to become linguistic masters . 
  were the world to do this we 'd all live more harmoniously i 'd wager !, 
  that 's why we give authority to a group of learn\u00e9d people to make these decisions for us and obey them with absolute obedience , much like the `` academie francaise '' . 
  for this they are disdained , i weep for la langue de moli\u00e8re :(, 
  i like hurting small animals, 
  good for you , the bipolar ex-girlfriend would go on alcohol and drug binges and end up in a squat houses sleeping with scum bags then expect me to bail her out of trouble and apologise . 
  good to see not all bipolar people are like that . 
  why is n't this top comment , bravo ... 
  i was entertained . 
  i 'm with you on this . 
  just seemed like a rather presumptive and not at all shocking diatribe . 
  twee humour for people who think just talking about sex is taboo . 
  wearing your skin probability : high, 
  worst of all he said `` game '' instead of `` match '' , what is this ? 
  america ? 
  is an hour and 30 minutes a long time ? 
  i mean most of these people are coming from countries where that 's how long it takes to cross the city . 
  seriously do n't refer to yourself as nordic , especially if your american , even if you can trace your entire family on both sides of every marriage back to scandinavia . 
  it 's not like actual europeans do this . 
  it smacks of outdated genetic typecasting . 
  i like my classical music a little dark so : -, 
  [ brahms - hungarian dance no. 5 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3x9lvc9wkkq ), 
  [ shostakovich - waltz no. 2 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmcnqduso4i ), 
  [ prokofiev - dance of the knights ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbskplb2e6q ), 
  [ mozart - requiem in d minor ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=splhkp0nzii ), 
  [ britten - serenade for tenor , horn and strings ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lis4yvldoc ), 
  because [ they 're a totally different thing ] ( http://www.seriouseats.com/images/20090513-english-muffin.jpg ), 
  why is gone pronounced to rhyme with on ? 
  and shone for that matter . 
  it does n't need to make sense to be correct . 
  listen to your so !, 
  not every - e is magic !, 
  shone gone etc.
