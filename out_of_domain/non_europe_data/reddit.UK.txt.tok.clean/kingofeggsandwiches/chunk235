  what is a semi ? 
  i always assume it was the state of your penis in the morning or a type of rifle . 
  except for the avoiding diabetes thing , especially if you 're big meal after fasting is full of refined carbs and sugars like most western diets . 
  pretty sure they do n't lock them in . 
  shut up, 
  that was more badass than i 'd expected . 
  ok , i 'm just going to be honest here , child me hated this programme , and was n't too keen on art attack either . 
  child me was incredibly annoyed by the lack of dialogue and disliked the kitsch zany style . 
  he also disliked the way it was a series of short sketches so nothing could really evolve in terms of plot , each sketch was an entirely self contained joke or narrative . 
  i would always turn over to the bbc to watch the demon headmaster or even sodding blue peter , the only time i watched it was when i went to friend who were citv watchers . 
  personally i was a cbbc kid and only occasionally watched citv for the occasional cartoon . 
  i ca n't actually explain how strongly i felt about this and since i was about 5 i really do n't think i was doing it some ulterior motive . 
  i really did find the lack of speaking irritating and the humour stupid in the extreme . 
  i mean seriously this emotion in me almost bordered on disturbing as in i felt there was something perverse about its very existence , seeing this has awoken the memories some rather odd feelings in me . 
  skip to about 9:50 for the creepy talking bust statue . 
  if that 's a semi what 's a full ? 
  and now it 's immortalised as a [ somewhat creepy context free gif ] ( http://imgur.com/5tb4rzg ), 
  i 'm sorry i do n't speak murican . 
  i recognised some of the sources , quite a few of them are from the documentary `` the story of english '' which was made in the mid 80s . 
  the speakers were all old and selected for their isolated accents . 
  in many ways this makes the samples non-representative of the current accents spoken in those places . 
  the yorkshire accent featured rhoticity for example which is unheard of today . 
  it 's not really fair to use a yorkshire accent that was probably more prominent in the first half of the 20th century and compare it with a modern accent really . 
  i think some were taken from the british library that has an excellent archive of accents but i do n't think they 're quite as old or traditional . 
  i felt like some of the accent did n't really do justice to the areas , the kent accent did n't feature an alveolar tap for example . 
  some accents like scouse and brummie have changed massively over time , and some like kent , sussex and suffolk have been supplanted by varying levels of estuary influence . 
  good ol' cilla said / \u025c\u02d0 / and also used it in words like there and square . 
  that 's some classic scouse . 
  there was a belgian restaurant in london a while back that specialised in moule frites , if you could name 20 famous belgians you got a free order with your meal . 
  sadly with the advent of smartphones i doubt this offer is still available . 
  i was sleeping in an abandoned dam , looking for useful things to survive , when i awoke to the sound of scratching , i hope it would go away if i went back to sleep , so i did , but when i woke up again there was a wolf outside the room i was in , the moment i stood up and move it ran straight in and pounced , i did n't know what to do and was torn to shreds . 
  uk works 10 % more than germany and produces 10 % less in terms of productivity : / 9 hour days are sadly becoming the norm . 
  9-5 's are very rare , it 's usually 8.30 to 5.30 , and in some cases even 8am - 6pm which is crazy if you ask me . 
  i do n't get it : /, 
  yeah , reading and the other 30 million + who live in the sound of england ... 
  because american is known for being such an attractive accent right ? 
  does n't remotely sound like hoff to me . 
  sounds like half just with a long - a instead of a short one , like the sound you make in milan . 
  hoff sounds like well hoff ? 
  if anything it 's some american accents who say hoff who make it sound like haahff . 
  so americans ca n't pronounce a short - o so therefore she 's saying hoff ? 
  nope , you 're all saying david hasselhalf . 
  i just do n't get it . 
  even americans use the long - a occasionally , otherwise you 've all been going to toco bell , and visiting milon in italy . 
  it 's just stupid if you ask me . 
  in germany there is the attitude that you are paid to work during your contracted hours . 
  everyone should be free from work once they 've finished , the only exception to this is if they 're being paid to work overtime consensually . 
  it 's better to work 8 hours , work hard , and then have maximum time for recreation , family and friends , than work 10 hours and spend a percentage of that time on facebook or having long chats with colleagues . 
  i understand more than you ever will . 
  the irony is you 're the ones who ca n't differentiate between a long - a as in `` taco '' and a short - o as in `` pot '' , and yet you 're impertinent enough to suggest she 's the one saying what it sounds like in your derivative dialect . 
  the arrogance of stupidity . 
  well to me when that guy says `` mop '' is sounds like maaaaaap , while most americans seem to say it like mahp . 
  fact is though that most european languages used `` ah '' for a. 
  the british have both `` ah '' and what you think of as `` a '' . 
  it 's only americans who use `` ah '' for for - o. 
  i 'm sure you 're an expert . 
  that 's a diphthong . 
  actually that 's a crock of shit . 
  if we want to get technical a long vowel is one with the / : / phonetic script after it . 
  `` lake '' has a diphthong / le\u026ak / / e\u026a / = ay , the way natalie dormer says `` half '' uses a long vowel / h\u0251\u02d0f / / \u0251\u02d0 / = ah , and the sound in a word like `` trap '' is a short vowel / tr\u00e6p / / \u00e6 / = a. 
  the point i was making is that it 's fucking retarded for americans to be claiming and english person is speaking the english language in a way other than how it 's written . 
  she 's not saying hoff , americans are saying haff . 
  itt : americans suggesting that an english person is pronouncing english incorrectly . 
  shame you ca n't develop a culture , speak english , or stop killing each other though : /,

  muh military pays for ur healthcarez !, 
  foreigners are evil and jealous of our freedom , especially the ones that are n't white !, 
  lol , that 's you 're culture , that 's what 's so funny . 
  as a briton , i often fantasise about taking over australia and relabelling all the vegemite to marmite . 
  ah yes , the great anglo-australian war of 1878 , we would n't want a repeat of that . 
  my feelings [ about this ] ( http://imgur.com/ygew3yh ), 
  now it 's my time to shine . 
  been making [ a few gifs ] ( http://imgur.com/ygew3yh ) of [ this video ] ( http://imgur.com/c3g6rv1 ) . 
  kinda i annoyed i did n't get your karma op . 
  garage is quite a wide genre . 
  there 's [ speed garage ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta02rjq1nn8&amp;40s ) , which is more house influenced with vocals , house pianos , and basslines . 
  there 's [ 2 step garage ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkj9m2eqawc&amp;t=8m40s ) which was more r&b influenced . 
  then there 's the old skool grime [ that was more like garage ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzdob2qbg0&amp;t=6m40s ) . 
  grime started off as a sub-genre of garage but nowadays it 's more like it 's own genre entire and has moved away from the garage beats . 
  the thing is all this stuff was never that clearly defined and there was always cross over , that video from that n64 game sounds more jungle influenced than anything . 
  maybe try [ something like this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcxnk_kdl1c ), 
  america ? 
  i 'll put this out there . 
  1 ) you might be overqualified 2 ) having been a police officer might make the cautious . 
  people do n't necessarily employ the most capable person for a job , they want a cog who fits the machine . 
  as with many low skill jobs , if you write that you 're ambitious go getter with team leadership skills who likes to take the initiative , you may get rejected on that alone . 
  i once got through a psychometric test for a supermarket job by answering the opposite of what i 'd write for a regular job , much more humble and less about selling myself as mr. 
  there 's also an element of people wanting someone they can mould , rather than someone who is already confident and might challenge their authority . 
  also being a copper is really intimidating to some people . 
  if i was a small business that was sloppy about things occasionally i would not want an ex-copper around . 
  i 've worked for plenty of coke heads and worked plenty of low skilled jobs where half my colleagues were stoners . 
  people are just generally conditioned to be nervous around coppers , you might also be facing the same discrimination legally qualified people do , employers do n't want people who will hold them to the rules and potentially cause a problem if they fail to uphold them . 
  also being a police officer is the kind of job that require some degree of mental activity and initiative , it 's also pretty exciting ( at least compared to stacking shelves ) , maybe they think you 'll be under stimulated and move on . 
  this is pretty much the overqualified thing . 
  have you tried positions which are based on trust ? 
  part time security work for example . 
  these are the kind of jobs where your history would be a massive asset . 
  you 're also guaranteed to ace any checks so even working around children would be possible . 
  worst censorship of the name and photo ever . 
  where do you think the aussies learnt it ?
