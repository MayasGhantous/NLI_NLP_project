  there were never that many vans . 
  at one point what they had were vans that had audio amplification equipment in them i believe . 
  all this really did was increase their ability to hear through walls . 
  the idea that they have some high tech equipment that detects the electro-magnetic signature of televisions has always been a complete fabrication designed to scare people into paying it . 
  the fact is that the tv licensing people mostly work by fear to get people to pay it . 
  the law is that you are legally obliged to pay it if you receive live broadcast television in the uk , however it is not a criminal matter not to pay , but a civil one . 
  the tv licensing institution has no special legal power any more than royal mail does . 
  how it works is that if they want to take you to court to force you to pay they have to gather evidence that proves you 're not complying with the law , in the same way that any individual could gather evidence on a fellow citizen who they suspect is breaking he law . 
  there are a number of ways they can `` get '' you . 
  one way is to see you watching television through your window , another is to walk up to your door and put their ear to it , if they hear live television being broadcast they 've got you , another is if you let them into the house and they see your television is on . 
  all the magic vans they had in the past were , were two guys doing exactly this , however they had the aid of an audio amplifier so going up to your door was unnecessary , and they could hear the evidence more readily . 
  however they were stopped from doing this on the basis of privacy . 
  while it 's acceptable to glance through someone 's window , and it 's acceptable to use your ears while standing on someone 's door step , using technology to amplify sound from the inside of someone 's house goes a step too far . 
  an ordinary person could n't get away with this and therefore neither can the tv licence guys . 
  nowadays the vans are just two guys snooping around without the aid of audio amplification , nevertheless they still catch a number of people out . 
  the whole thing really works off fear , they will spam you with threatening letters , if you ignore them they will get redder and scarier as time progresses . 
  if you do n't have a television you 're meant to inform them . 
  nevertheless they will point blank refuse to believe you and continue threatening . 
  there have been a few cases where they 've got warrants to search houses because of tv licencing , but this is no different to any civil dispute because what 's happened here is that they 've gathered evidence proving the person is violating the law , taken it to a judge and obtained a court order , and then that person has continued to not cooperate and deny the existence of the television , it 's only in this situation that the court with authorise the police to enter a house . 
  i mean in my opinion you should pay the licence because the bbc provides a great service , however if you really ca n't afford it just do n't pay it and make sure to keep your tv away from any windows , do n't have it so loud that people outside the house could hear it and and do n't let any tv licence people into the house . 
  that depends , i think if you 're a family you just pay one licence for up to so many television ( realistically though you could have 20 and nobody would check this provided you paid ) . 
  if you share a flat then you only pay once provided the tv is in a shared area of the building . 
  technically if you each had a television in your room you 're meant to pay separately , but again this is something that is never enforced , they 're interested in catching non-payers than underpayers . 
  one place they do catch people out is in university halls of residence , since they might allow the people to look around . 
  there is definitely a right wing faction in likes to make the uk is super fascist and a massive nanny state , mostly it 's bullshit . 
  for example the cctv myths are the commonest ones . 
  the uk does have more cctv per capita than any other country , but what they fail to mention is that it 's mostly privately owned . 
  cctv is more effectively in densely populated areas as well . 
  all it is used for is to bring bring down the cost of insurance , cctv coverage is a requirement in many big policies now . 
  it 's only look at after the fact when a crime or accident has occured . 
  you only find police owned cameras in high risk areas , not all are watched , if they are it 's alongside dozens of other camears , and they are not tracking your whereabouts , it 's simply to help the police respond faster and gather evidence easier in known crime spots . 
  bit of a random one , but i think deaf parents who decide raise their kids deaf rather than give them cochlear implants should n't be able to make that choice . 
  i think deaf culture is the symptom of a disability and not something special that should be preserved , a world without deaf people would be a better world . 
  logistically the soyuz was a lot more sensible , you make a rocket and stick a person in it . 
  the bottom parts break away and you 're left with a capsule . 
  the shuttle was always a massively over engineered glory piece , it looked cooler because it was more like we imagine a `` spaceship '' , but it was complete unnecessary to have it strapped to the side of a rocket and landing like a plane . 
  unnecessary complexity made it inefficient , expensive and dangerous , simple as that . 
  mbe is birmingham 's answer to mle . 
  it 's very distinctive when you compare it to the older generation . 
  it 's not brummie mixed with mle , but it 's own distinct variation on older birmingham dialects just like mle is variation on cockney dialects . 
  sure there is some crossover but that 's the asian and black influence . 
  some people in brum do sound more like mle , but his was actually a really good example of real `` hood '' brummie , not just a mish mash of brummie and mle . 
  no , just no . 
  you 're not required to carry id in many countries , in most countries in fact you only need be able to produce id at a later date . 
  in the uk you can actually live without any id . 
  there 's a big difference between eea / eu and commonwealth . 
  eu have the right to stay indefinitely anywhere in the eu . 
  while technically not citizens with the ability to vote and so forth , they are automatically equivalent to permanent residents . 
  technically they can be sent back if they break the law in the country but even this is very rare and will only happen in serious cases , they can also be sent back if they are entirely unable to support themselves , since they wo n't be afforded the same benefits are natives until they 've stayed over a certain amount of time . 
  all being in the commonwealth means is that you get a visa waiver and can come for up to six months as a guest , this is no different from what a british or canadian can do in america ( although america are definitely more uptight about it , recently they refused a german girl because they read her facebook messages and saw a conversation in which she offered to take the kids to school for her relative which they classed as illegally working as an au pair which is insane ) . 
  if i had a lot of money in the bank i could spend 6 months in the us , i 'd just have to show that i was able to support myself for that time . 
  all an eu citizen has to do is turn up in the eu country and register , once they 're registered then they are given a national insurance number or equivalent and they are treated like any permanent resident . 
  they can buy / rent a house , get a job , pay tax and have virtually the same rights as a citizen . 
  the only things they ca n't do is vote , hold political office , and stuff like that . 
  i did exactly this when i left the uk for germany . 
  the only legal channel is the registration , which simply involves proving you 're a national of another eu country . 
  the benefits you can receive as an eu immigrant are limited , but once you 've stayed over a period of time ( something like 2 years ) become equivalent to what a citizen would be have available to them , which obviously differs from country to country . 
  i 'm sorry but you 're mistake , all eu citizens are here legally , that have a right to reside indefinitely , they are n't breaking the law by simply being here . 
  russia is n't in the eu . 
  furthermore virtually all eu citizens do register , it 's necessary if they want to work or use the nhs or any of these things . 
  the only reason an eu citizen might not register is if they were working cash in hand and avoiding tax , but most do n't do that . 
  a small percentage might , but it 's no different from a british national tax evader . 
  funny how when someone tries to do this for an american accent it just gets downvoted . 
  some irony in americans thinking that british people are the ones not pronouncing the language as it 's written . 
  what he 's saying : yeah i 've got skills , what you going to do about it ? 
  what the average american says : yeeah ah gahd skeels , wat yu gahn doo bowd it ? 
  why ? 
  it 's quite charming really . 
  dutch people - always giving themselves a hard time over the speaking of languages , languages whose speakers could n't be bothered to learn dutch if you paid them . 
  how is that nsfw ?? 
  i 'm pretty sure nature videos are the definition of sfw, 
  in what job do you work where it 's not ? 
  the only things i 'd get in trouble for at work is video that is somehow sexualised or politically incorrect . 
  nature documentaries are fine .
