  people who wanted to appear cultured still got to say the word `` rare '' , albeit combined with `` medium '' , but avoided getting a steak that grossed them out . 
  the older types who were n't comfortable with any blood or redness could now order `` medium '' and get what they wanted ( a pinkish steak with no blood at all ) rather than what the french consider medium ( \u00e0 point ) , and those anglo weirdos who actually wanted their steak to be nuked to oblivion could now says `` well done '' and get `` trop cuit '' rather than `` bien cuit '' , which they would still perceive to be medium . 
  therefore , the whole system ended up sliding so that the english terms no longer properly correspond with the french terms . 
  i like my steak '' \u00e0 point '' , which means if i 'm in the english-speaking world i 'll order it medium rare , and if i 'm in france i 'll order it \u00e0 point . 
  all to get the same damn steak , and do n't even get me started on the unpredictability of the germans . 
  if you said to a french chef `` entre \u00e0 point et saignant '' , the literal translation of medium rare , you 'd get something considerably less cooked than what the english speaking world associates with medium rare . 
  ultimately medium rare is just one of those terms that kind of bugs me , and i know it bugs many chefs too , especially those who studied in france or are french themselves . 
  imagine being a french chef going to work in london or new york and being told in the english-speaking world medium ( \u00e0 point ) = medium rare , well done ( bien cuit ) = medium , burnt in the fires of hell itself ( trop cuit ) = well done and so forth , they must think we 're brain-damaged . 
  the real problem is the ambiguity it can sometimes lead to . 
  it 's also the case that in many parts of the world , particularly the us , the most commonly ordered type of steak is medium rare , and it 's agreed upon by many that medium rare is the best way to have steak . 
  well , of course , it is , a medium-rare steak now means '' \u00e0 point '' which has always been considered to be the perfect level of cooking for a good steak . 
  yet it just seems stupid that this perfect temperature is n't called medium as it is france , surely what the majority consider to be ideal is by definition medium . 
  ah well , it 's a stupid thing to be annoyed by but there it is . 
  edit : i 'll also add that because of this stupid clash of steak cultures problem that the dilution is getting worse . 
  i 've even read of people saying they wanted a medium rare steak , went to france and ordered \u00e0 point , and got something that was too rare for them . 
  these people need to be sat down and have it quietly explained to them that the steaks they ordered `` medium rare '' in buttfuck , alabama were actually medium ( bien cuit ) . 
  this is the product of this assumption by many americans that medium rare is steak cooked what they perceive `` correctly '' since medium rare is now universally considered superior . 
  the poor chef in buttfuck , alabama knows that his hick client\u00e8le want their steaks bien cuit , but also knows that because of fashion they will say they want medium rare regardless and thus the people of buttfuck start to believe that medium rare = bien cuit . 
  i mean where does it end ? 
  one day we 'll all be ordering our steaks `` rare '' and getting bien cuit for fuck 's sake , then we 'll have to say blue rare for medium rare and blue for actually rare , for blue we 'll have to tell the chef to wipe its arse and stick it on the plate . 
  how you have your steak should n't be a matter of fashion , and we should n't judge people for ordering steak how they like to eat it , or at least the people who eat the steak should n't let fashion influence what they say to a waiter . 
  it 's totally making chef 's jobs harder , especially if they 're dealing with an international client\u00e8le , waiters have to start putting notes about what kind of person ordered the steak just so the chef can actually figure out what that person really wants . 
  this is n't a joke , by the way , in paris it 's not unusual for the waiters to note if the client is an anglo ... 
  haha well you 're not technically wrong , because nobody can fucking decide what is correct !, 
  using the french standard that steak looks bien cuit because it 's pink not red and i ca n't see any blood whatsoever ( perhaps demi-anglais , a french joke meaning `` half-english '' a term used for a steak a little bit more than \u00e0 point but not quite bien cuit , the idea being that the english burn their steaks to a cinder ) , in an anglo country i 'd call it medium . 
  however i know to a lot of people would call that steak medium rare in the english speaking world . 
  to the person who posted the picture that steak may well what they call rare !, 
  there 's literally no consensus . 
  these days there even official definitions put out by food boards describing what is what defined by temperature , but since so few people actually use a thermometer when cooking it really does n't help . 
  perhaps a [ photo like this ] ( https://avanzado2eoi.wikispaces.com/file/view/15%20degrees%20of%20steak%20doneness.jpg ) is more useful . 
  it 's only contentious if you 're a chef really ( i used to be a low ranking chef ) , because honestly all a good chef really wants is to give the customer what they want so they 'll walk away saying good things about the restaurant , a job made very hard by the ambiguity . 
  where i worked at least once a week we 'd get someone sending their steak back , thankfully usually it was some macho idiot who asked for rare but got cold feet when they saw the bloody juices coming out of it . 
  this was usually just a matter of throwing it back in the pan for 30 seconds on each side , however i know a really good chef would n't even do that , that steak would be going in a bin ( or at least given to an attractive waitress ) and you 'd have to do it again which is obviously very costly to the restaurant ( good job they charge so much in such places , but now you can see why ... ) . 
  you mean `` bless your heart '' is the american version of `` god bless you '' surely ? 
  it 's all in the neck *, 
  you 're the one saying `` it 's awl in the nairk '', 
  i 'm sorry , reddit does n't understand sarcasm : /, 
  english rather than americanish . 
  are you even trying ? 
  are you a bit slow fella ? 
  whether the video is or is not from nz is completely irrelevant to what the guy i responded to just said . 
  i 'm fully aware that the video is from nz , but let 's break down what was said . 
  one guy said `` throw another shrimp on the bar-bie '' , now ** this ** probably was n't sarcastic , this poster probably thought they were australian . 
  however look at what the poster i was responding to said ... `` i feel like this is gon na get a lot of australian upvotes . '', 
  this is obvious sarcasm because everyone knows that australians hate the clich\u00e9 shrimp-barbie phrase because it 's not something that any australian has ever said . 
  so when he says that it will get lots of aussie upvotes it 's ** obvious ** sarcasm . 
  that fact that the original video was actually from nz is just another reason why australians would downvote it . 
  making his sarcasm even more apparent . 
  edit : god almighty i ca n't believe i even have to explain this . 
  what on earth is that ? 
  sounds like a topical cream ... 
  i 'm sorry to me it seems like a fundamental flaw in american culture that this was even able to happen , even just the once . 
  whether or not the school was in the region where coke is made or was attempting to gain funding from coke is irrelevant . 
  the reason it 's so fucked up is because it shows how america blurs the divisions between private capitalist interest and the public sector . 
  it seems fucked up to me beyond belief as a non-american that private interests would be able to get press ( to ultimate sell more of a product ! ), 
  through appealing to the public sector like this . 
  especially the educational public sector . 
  it 's not even the kid 's punishment that 's the fucked up part . 
  it 's the fact that coke is permitted to do this in schools !, 
  the reason america is fucked up from an non-americans perspective is how at ease americans are with capitalist interest , it 's as if americans capitalism somehow worked for the greater good or something . 
  it also shows how authoritarian american schools are by the fact they suspended him over what essentially a moderately amusing prank . 
  this nobody can deny , zero tolerance rules , drug tests for kids , metal detectors american schools would makes hitler proud . 
  it 's not just schools either , there are parts of america where you can be jailed for sagging for fuck 's sake . 
  for the land of the free modern day america sure seems awfully fascist . 
  coke should n't be allowed to run a content trying to appeal to schools with grants , and school should not be permitted to enter in contests with private interests , simple enough really . 
  in my country this would not fly ... 
  haha , well to be fair ireland was n't involved in the war , not many irish people died . 
  even the uk their neighbour was n't completely fucked up , most of the horrors were overseas , ( sure there was the blitz and the battle of britain but at home casualties were few , and even the casualties abroad were nothing compared the great war ) . 
  you can see how some naive old folk in rural ireland but actually think it would all just blow over in a few years . 
  moral panic is not even a new thing . 
  there are multiple cases like this . 
  a community gets convinced that there is a network of child abusers within it and suddenly everyone is see children being burned on pyres and networks of paedophiles working in the community . 
  often it 's the testimony of a child that triggers it . 
  some psychologically unstable parents trains their kid to say horrific things and nobody can bring themselves to doubt the reality of it . 
  there was a thing in london not long ago going around the internet where two children were claiming all the teachers and many of the parents in a school abused children sexually in satanic rituals and wore shoes made from the skin of babies . 
  later it was found that the mother was schizophrenic and her boyfriend was a nasty piece of work who encouraged the whole thing . 
  funny how in places with gun control dont have a weekly active shooter ... 
  well i can attest that the murder rate is vastly lower in my country , and so it the frequency of mass shootings , but maybe that 's got absolutely nothing to do with the fact the vast majority of people do n't have access to guns ... 
  the whole of western europe seems to be doing quite well avoiding shooters with their gun control , funny that . 
  i live there already . 
  however if i were a us citizen i wouldnt be able to anyway . 
  it 's not like americans can come to europe easily , not unless they 're very rich or have a very desirable skill set . 
  i do n't know where you 're getting your stats but violent crime is much lower in europe than in the us . 
  the myth that europe has more violent crime was a deliberate misinterpretation of statistics by right wing gun nuts , comparing the us definition of violent crime ( rape , murder , aggravated assault , robbery ) with wider definitions that would include stuff like threatening someone verbally and minor assaults in which nobody was injured . 
  the population of a country is completely irrelevant to its murder rate . 
  the rate of murder per 100,000 people in my country is 0.8 compared to the us 's 4.7 . 
  that means you 're six times more likely to be murdered in the us . 
  it 's wrong because it 's allowing the private sector to use government-funded institutions to turn a profit . 
  the public sector should n't be able to accept money from corporations . 
  had coke said to the school , we 'll pay you a grant if you do this publicity stunt for us , it would be called a bribe , yet when they offer the grant and let the school decide what kind of stunt to pull off it 's somehow acceptable ? 
  i think not . 
  furthermore , the school , by doing this , is tacitly endorsing coke , it 's saying that coke the company is ok , and it 's ok for us to take their money and be associated with them . 
  what about all the immoral things coke does in third world countries ? 
  what right does the school have to impact their student 's opinion of coke as a corporation ? 
  if impressionable kids grow up with this stuff it teaches them that it 's ok . 
  i personally do n't hate coke the company , but many people do . 
  one thing that is obvious to me at least though is that educators in the employment of the government have no right to impact that decision . 
  honestly many europeans probably feel as strongly about this as americans do about keeping religion out of state funded schools . 
  personally i do n't care about religion in school , it seems a whole lot worse to let corporations use schools for advertising than it does to allow prayer and such into school ( provided the rights of all other religious denominations are not infringed ) . 
  to me , it seems like an obvious ploy .
