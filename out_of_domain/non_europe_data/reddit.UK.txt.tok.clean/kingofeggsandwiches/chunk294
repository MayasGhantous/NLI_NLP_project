   i would not have, 
   what ? 
  you 've lost me now . 
   can we go back to standard english now please ? 
  did you or did you not just write this ? 
  to me , it seems like you 're questioning whether the construction `` i would not have '' is standard english . 
  lol . 
  i 'd 've = i would have . 
  not `` i had have '' . 
  anyway , i was trying to talk more generally about double and triple contractions , but you seem hung up on that first post . 
  what you responded to is n't incorrect because it has an extra `` have '' as you have construed it , but because it puts `` if '' and `` would '' in the same clause , a common feature of many dialects which is non-standard . 
  lol redditiquette . 
  jesus christ mate , did you get up on the wrong side of bed this morning ? 
  stop being so angry . 
  you made a mistake interpreting what `` i 'd 've '' would stand for and consequently we have our wires crossed . 
  no dialects say `` i had have '' but plenty say `` if i would have '' , despite it being non-standard . 
  chill out :d, 
  i was n't suggesting that you suggested that `` i had have '' was correct . 
  both `` if i had have '' and `` if i would have '' are non-standard , the difference is that the latter is common , the former is not . 
  the problem occurred when you said :, 
   for a start , it should just be ` if i had thought of ' . 
  no need for the ** extra have ** , even though it 's common in some places . 
  you see this got me confused because the person you initially responded to said `` if i 'd 've thought of it '' . 
  this stands for `` if i would have thought of it '' not `` if i had have thought of it '' , so your talk of an extra have makes zero sense in the context , there is no extra `` have '' , only a superfluous `` would '' . 
  you made the mistake mate , this whole chain of confusion would 've been avoided if you 'd known your shit , no offence and all , but do n't get angry at me because you think `` i 'd 've '' stands for `` i had have '' when it does n't . 
  anyway , because i did n't spot your error initially i thought you were suggesting that there was a superfluous have in my example of `` i ` d n't 've '' as if `` i would not done that '' were grammatical and `` i would not have done that '' were not . 
  this is why i was questioning whether you were a native speaker because that seems like the kind of mistake only a non-native speaker would make . 
  i 'm not a troll , i 'm a guy who was responding earnestly to your comment and got confused because of a misinterpretation you made . 
  furthermore if you find reddit wastes your real life time then i suggest you stop using it . 
  we 'll let you have the danelaw back if you promise to declare war on wessex and get rid of cameron . 
  it 's kind of ridiculous that just touching someone is considered battery . 
  america , the land without common sense . 
  in most countries she 'd probably just be given a fine for being drunk and disorderly and sent on her way . 
  you are n't reading what i 'm saying are you . 
  i know that ... 
   both `` if i had have '' and `` if i would have '' are non-standard , the difference is that the latter is common , the former is not . 
  both are incorrect as i have stated . 
   also incorrect is `` if i had have thought of it '' which is also common . 
  this is the extra ` have ' . 
  see , this is ** not ** common . 
  it 's not a known mistake . 
  it would be virtually impossible for a native speaker to make this mistake . 
  you are misinterpreting people saying `` i 'd have '' as `` i had have '' when in fact they are saying `` i would have '' . 
  it does n't happen . 
  all instances of `` i 'd 've '' and `` i 'd have '' are in fact `` i would have '' . 
  a sentence like `` i 'd have done it if you had let me '' is perfectly grammatical because '' 'd '' = would and never have in a sentence like this . 
  `` i had have '' is not something anyone says ( contracted or not ) , even a 6 year old knows that you ca n't follow `` i had '' with a present tense form . 
  edit : even if you 're going to go on to claim `` i had have '' is a common error ( which it is n't , at least not outside beginner english classes ) , you still completely missed what is undoubtedly a more common mistake ( if i would have ) and jumped straight into talking about extra haves , which imo was a huge oversight on your behalf . 
  which is why everyone is in prison over there , or at least rotting in a holding cell waiting months for trial . 
  just like your comment !, 
  i 'm afraid sacrifices will have to be made , and you will have to make the ultimate one . 
  thank you for your service o7, 
  err . . 
  i did n't say they were useless , however it only takes one sub to take down an aircraft carrier . 
  if it was n't for the ability to project force on land from international waters then the us would not spend all that money on having 11 of them . 
  all out naval wars are n't that common you realise ? 
  i think it 's different kinds of racism . 
  i always tried to explain that to black american friends , european racism is more based on ignorance ( not that it makes it any better ) and is more overt , while american racism is more systemic , more historical and is more veiled . 
  for example if a black person were to go to many small towns in the balkans they might find that they get stared at , that people act funny around them , that people will say inappropriate things and so forth , you 'll also get your hardline european racial purists who pick on anyone who stands out that much immediately . 
  much of this simply stems from not being in proximity to people of other races for most of ones life . 
  however what is shocking in the us , to me at least , is that social groups and communities are virtually segregated on the basis of ethnicity , that there exists black communities at all is crazy , that the economic disparity between black and white is virtually taken for granted . 
  the very existence of `` black areas '' is a foreign concept to most europeans even those growing up in multicultural areas . 
  in much of europe you tend to get rich areas which are mostly white , and then multicultural areas which are entirely mixed . 
  sure this means there is still economic disparity between white people and other races in europe , nobody would claim otherwise . 
  however , in the us you literally see `` black area '' , `` hispanic area '' , `` poor white area '' , and the amount that people are integrated as communities is pathetic . 
  likewise you have `` black schools '' and `` white schools '' and so on . 
  americans just do n't seem to get the concept of integration . 
  much of their concept of not being racist had seems to me to be about emphasising the difference between different races . 
  as in `` you 're a different race from me and i can ** never ** understand your perspective on anything but i can at least respect it '' , while the european version would state that the absence of racism is being colour blind and treating everyone the same regardless of the colour of their skin . 
  it 's almost as if america has forsaken the concept of being one people as a lost cause and seeks only to tolerate each other 's presence . 
  another thing that says a lot is how ill at least many americans are , of all ethnicities , with interracial relationships . 
  good to know that the american desire to get people into prison for any kind of physical contact does not overcome the american moral imperative `` thou shalt tip at least 15 % even when the service is shitty '' . 
  the point was that in reality the us wo n't be fighting a naval war so whatever benefits they provide during a naval battle are moot . 
  even then there air superiority is n't such a big deal these days now we have missiles that can travel 2000km and hit a target 10m2 . 
  the point was simple , the carrier fleet is more about protecting america 's status as `` world police '' and about being able to reach any nation who defies america no matter how remote , less about about winning wars with other naval powers . 
  any laser capable of taking out a missile can probably take out a plane and any missiles launched from a plane . 
  for the cost of a carrier america could build five submarines that would have far more use in a naval battle , but that 's not what it 's about since there is currently is n't any real threat of that , when the us start mass producing nuclear subs that 's when we should be worrying . 
  ultimately the point is that carrier are far from `` war winners '' they are slow , hard to manoeuvre and sitting ducks in a naval battle requiring many smaller ship destroying vessels to back them up . 
  many americans seem to think are the ultimate trump card in a war , when really they serve a rather specific purpose . 
  yeah i 'm sure the free lawyer would 've been competent enough , but i just did n't want to wait or rely on the german services ( nobody at the court would speak english with me for fuck 's sake , all my letters were sent in german , free homework i guess ) . 
  the cost of the lawyer was n't thaaat bad , and it meant he had the time to sit down with me for a few hours and really figure out strategy for the case . 
  i think the reason it was n't versuchte gro\u00df fahrl\u00e4ssige k\u00f6rperverletzung i believe was because of the bottle being classified as a werkzeug which automatically escalates the matter to gef\u00e4hrlich . 
  i should have qualified all the charges brought against me were `` versuchte '' since nobody was actually physically harmed by my actions . 
  yeah that german legal system does work , however , it gives me the feeling now that it 's a bit over zealous and thorough . 
  as in even in very minor incidents it still requires that people attend court and go through the motions , even if the sentence is going to be a 14 day fine at 10 % of earnings . 
  typical german efficiency i guess . 
  i 'll also add that this was in bavaria where apparently the system is even more thorough because of low crime rates and high incomes meaning they 're not short of cash , my rechtsanwalt did say that if this add happened in berlin the prosecution services would n't have the time or money to bring such a minor matter to court xd, 
  1/4 was i think that 's the point . 
  meh , / r/askhistorians perhaps , i 've got no clue . 
  nope , there is no pause , if anything it 's more like `` metul '' . 
  so many americans seem to think that glottal stopped - t 's are `` british '' ... no that 's `` cockney '', 
  i actually enjoy the superbowl , but only for the adverts, 
  what a reasonable person might suggest `` why do n't we only allow countries to host the olympics if they can demonstrate that it will be done as ethically as possible '' . 
  what an american says `` why do n't we host the olympics in america every year ! '', 
  source : the patriot, 
  actually he 's not entirely wrong there . 
  the ** eu ** is 4,324,782 km2 against the us 's 9,857,306 , the us is 2.2 times bigger than the european union , he 's exaggerating but he had specified the eu rather than the whole of europe ( which includes part of russia i believe ) . 
  the population of the eu is 508,191,116 , but notices how he avoids this by only mentioning the eu 's biggest country germany at 80.5 million roughly 1/4 the size of the us . 
  that was n't apparent to me, 
  a nation known for its ethics for sure !,
