  ipa charts the actual sounds that a speaker uses when he pronounces a word , right down the precise positioning of vowels with diacritics and everything . 
  phonetic script is nothing but a simplified script based on ipa that dictionaries use to outline how a word roughly should be pronounced ( or how it is pronounced by the majority at least ) . 
  to put it simply , phonetic script shows you which sound should go where , but it tells you nothing about how that sound should be produced . 
  ironically due to tradition phonetic script tends to resemble british english far more than american english , but that is by the way , since it does n't actually matter because phonetic script is n't anything but a rough guide to how a word can be spoken , it does n't actually tell you whether you need to round your - o 's or use a fully open vowel for - a. 
  you are so wrong right now you should really just know when to give up . 
  please just stop talking shit about stuff you do n't know anything about . 
  it 's just annoying to see people spread misinformation on reddit . 
  jesus , everything you are saying here is the product of ethnocentric logic . 
  you know nothing about the phonetics of the british accent , or the american one for that matter . 
  for example you say `` rounder , more full vowels allow for greater volume and better tone . '', 
  yet , do you know which vowel the british accent uses for a word like dog ? 
  it 's official name is the [ `` open back rounded vowel '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/open_back_rounded_vowel ) , the sound that americans typically use here is the [ `` open back unrounded vowel '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/open_back_unrounded_vowel ) . 
  in fact it 's british accents that tend to round vowels more , yet you 've just claimed that rounder vowels are better for singing , so you 've just contradicted yourself completely . 
  also what you claim about the - o not doing anything in californian english that would surprise a non-native speaker is illogical too , since most other roman alphabet languages tend to correlate - o with a rounded vowel , the fact that american english uses an unrounded vowel for short - o as in `` pot '' would be unusual to them . 
  you might think that non-rhoticism is complicated , the feature which changes the pronunciation of - r if it 's not followed by a vowel , yet many many european languages are non-rhotic too . 
  for example , french and german . 
  also the - r is almost never rolled in modern british english , so again you are mistaken . 
  in reality , there is no such thing as a simpler or more phonetic version of english , it 's entirely our own cultural biases , the product of the sounds we heard being associated with letters as we learnt the language , that dictate people assumptions about how letters and sounds should be pronounced . 
  there is nothing more accentless , or truer to the written form , about californian english than scottish english even . 
  furthermore i 'd advise you not to attempt to write out things phonetically without using phonetic script or ipa , since again this is entirely dictated by your own manner of speaking . 
  you are still talking absolute bollocks though . 
  i would expect a vocal teacher to know what a rounded vowel is . 
  no , rounded does not mean something different to a vocal teacher than it does to a phoneticist , you are talking out your arse i 'm afraid . 
  the pronunciation from snatch is equally open as the californian one , they are both using the `` open back unrounded vowel '' imo . 
  if anything the hacky irish accent in snatch places the vowel slightly more forward but they are both equally open and equally unrounded . 
  i 've already posted why americans often believe british singers sound more american . 
   the real reason americans think british singers sound more american when they sing is simply because the act of singing removes some of the phonetic elements that tell your brain which accent someone has . 
  these being stress patterns , the length and shape of diphthongs ( dictated by the length of the note on which they fall ) , and the precise positioning of vowels ( which can be affected by pitch and volume ) ... 
  furthermore the beatles did try american accents for a few songs and dropped it because it sounded silly and fake . 
  that 's why paul mccartney can get away with rhyming words like `` there '' and `` square '' , because they 're singing in scouse accents . 
  if some americans still think they sound american it 's entirely for the reasons i outlined in the quote . 
  edit : i 'd also expect a vocal teacher worth their salt to know ipa or at least have a basic understanding of phonetic script , which would avoid having to make approximations like `` the rayn in spayn foles maynly awn the playn vs the rayn in spayn falls maynly on the playn '' . 
  better to write british - '' / \u00f0\u0259 re\u026an \u026an spe\u026an f\u0254\u02d0ls me\u026an.l\u026a \u0252n \u00f0\u0259 ple\u026an / '' vs us - / \u00f0\u0259 re\u026an \u026an spe\u026an f\u0251\u02d0ls me\u026an.li \u0251\u02d0n \u00f0\u0259 ple\u026an /, 
  i mean just think for a moment , does that make any sense to anyone but you ? 
  does `` foles '' represent / f\u0254\u02d0ls / or / f\u0251\u02d0ls / , you can listen [ to both here ] ( http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/fall ) . 
  which one is foles and which one is falls ? 
  could this be entirely dictated by your own accent ? 
  which you think the letters best represent is entirely determined by your experience and not by anything objective . 
  i ca n't be arsed correcting you if you 're going to be so set in your ways . 
  needless to say the entire linguistic community is against you , and what you are spouting is renowned for being a silly prejudice that various out dated linguists tried to push in the early 20th century . 
  it 's not square and there , that was a mistake . 
  the sounds that the beatles often rhyme are words like `` her '' and `` there '' , which rhyme in scouse but not in most other english dialects . 
  there 's a quote somewhere saying how when the beatles were just starting the record companies encouraged them to use more american pronunciation , but they quickly dropped it when they realised it did n't sound right , apparently you can hear it in their very early work . 
  it 's funny how you keep talking about a tighter embouchure as a bad thing , which refers to the rounding of the lips , while simultaneously saying that american accents require a more rounded shape . 
  is rounding simultaneously good and bad ? 
  furthermore i 'll add that british accents feature more rounded vowels than american accents , which have mostly been lost . 
   besides all of this , never forget that all of english was non-rhotic until around 250 years ago , and was affected willfully . 
  this makes the californian accent closer to a non-accent than most english accents . 
  again this is just a whole heap of stupid . 
  firstly accents are n't `` affected wilfully '' , they evolve naturally . 
  nobody said `` let 's deliberately start speaking differently '' , it was merely that some people started losing or lessening their rhoticism and it spread as a trend until most british accents were non-rhotic . 
  secondly , while american accents did n't lose the - r ( except for the whole east coast and parts of the south of course ... ) , there also changed massively in virtually every other regard , rhoticism is one feature of speech , while i could point out dozens of changes that occurred in american english and only american english in the 250 years that followed , making american english no closer to how english was spoken back then than modern british english , i can also point to dozens of features that british english retained and american english lost . 
  the same is true vice versa , american also retained stuff that british lost , and british also developed new stuff that american did n't . 
  neither language is truer to the original though . 
  finally , however , even if american english were somehow truer to an older form of english , which it is n't . 
  that still would not make it remotely anything like a non-accent . 
  the very term `` non-accent '' is just a politically loaded fantasy . 
  i 'm sorry but the fact that you believe this shit about american accents is purely the product of early 20th century american nationalism that just wo n't die , you are perpetuating ridiculous beliefs invented by men who simply could n't abide believing their mode of speaking was n't the `` truest '' english . 
  wow , you are just not listening . 
  do n't worry i am calm , but it 's amazing how often this brand of ignorant linguistic prescriptivism you 're espousing gets thrown about and quite frankly it 's tiring to hear how everyone thinks they 're a linguistic expert and spreads this crap . 
  if you really want to learn there are nice people over at / r/linguistics and failing that / r/badlinguistics who will show you the error of your ways . 
  as for the beatles , i suggest you look up the work of peter trughill who analysed the beatles use of language throughout there work . 
   linguist peter trudgill tracked rhoticity in british rock music over the years and found that the beatles ' pronunciation of rs decreased over the course of the 1960s, 
   beatles actually tried to americanize their english in the early days , to imitate their models in rock and blues music . 
  now as for the rhoticity in the british english , can you not understand the difference between a slight change amongst one group of speakers spreading to other groups and as you described `` wilfully affecting '' a different accent . 
  the change to non-rhoticism was a perfectly natural change for a group , who happened to be prestige speakers , and it eventually was copied because prestige dialects hold the most sway . 
  ironically you can see exactly the same trend in modern american english except the other way . 
  fewer and fewer speakers are speaking non-rhotically in the us these days , as general american , the prestige accent of the us is rhotic , meaning that on the east coast in places like new york and boston , non-rhoticism is being considered more and more a feature of working class dialects and more middle and upper class people are speaking rhotically . 
  prestige non-rhotic east coast accents have become the target of ridicule , for example [ locust valley lockjaw ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wruwjt2kd1y ) and [ boston brahmin ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwvonjxjuo4&amp;t=22s ) , which have all but died out due to greater influence from rhotic dialects . 
  sorry , bro , but you 're way off the mark . 
  unless you think the people in new york who wish to sound more like newsreaders or their favourite celebrities are `` affecting '' the change . 
  linguistic change happens for social and cultural reasons and not because people `` affect '' it . 
   i 'm saying that if you read an english sentence phonetically and use the letters as they were used in shakespeare 's time , you 'll sound more californian than northern, 
  yet again you are wrong . 
  we can actually hear how shakespeare would have sounded at the time [ as shown in this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gplppht7n9s&amp;t=180s ) . 
  i can assure you that phonetically that is no closer to modern californian than it is to modern british . 
  in fact that are people in parts of the uk today who [ still sound that way today ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=berf_kpu5fw ) , and while they retain rhoticism like americans , much of the speech is far closer to british regarding things like vowels , yods , stress patterns and so forth . 
  finally you closed with, 
   america has little to no character as a culture . 
  it makes sense that their accent would be this way as well . 
  this is the exactly the kind of linguistic prejudice that 's annoying the hell out of me . 
  i would never say the american accent lacks character . 
  it 's just as characterful and linguistically interesting as any other dialect of english . 
  however to say it 's accentless/most neutral/characterless/better of singing or whatever else crap you want to spread around is complete and utter bollocks . 
  it 's also complete crap to connect the way people speak with their character , it 's like something they believed before eugenics even . 
  are all germans harsh because you think their language is harsh ? 
  are the french soft because you think their language is soft ? 
  it 's ridiculous . 
  i 'm done with you . 
  you are an idiot . 
  linguistics is a science far more than psychology or any other social science . 
  we can actually objective measure sound waves after all and there millions spent every year doing exactly that . 
  if you 're going to be proud of your ignorance by demeaning the study of linguistics you can go take a flying fuck . 
   an you not see that standardizing and educating children to speak this way was , in fact , a cultural affectation ? 
  mandatory education did n't start in the uk until 1880 , well after the change had occurred . 
  great logic there . 
  if you had n't realised most accents are dominated by the speech of the prestige speakers , it 's why londoners do n't pronounce their - h 's for example , copying the french speaking aristocracy . 
  in fact the real spread of non-rhoticism in the uk did n't occur until the invention of the wireless which increased standardisation . 
   sounds irish , if not american . 
  more la than london .
