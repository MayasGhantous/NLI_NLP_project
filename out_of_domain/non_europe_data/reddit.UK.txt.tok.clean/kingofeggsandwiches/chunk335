  which is what i 'd call canonical . 
   but if you want to add subtlety , flavour , nuance -- if you want the language to live and to express the full range of human emotion and experience -- then you depart from the neutral . 
  exactly what i was saying ... 
   no , it has n't . 
  which entirely contradicts what you say here . 
   in other words , if you use that formulation , you 're saying : `` and now even the bartender wants to throw you out , '' to which the response would be , `` did i miss something ? 
  who else has been trying to throw me out ? '', 
  then you say . 
   there just is n't a cast-iron rule in german that the subject must come before the object . 
  that 's a fairly important rule in english , but that 's because that 's how english works . 
  german works slightly differently . 
  i 'm well aware of this . 
  again , you seem to be hung up on the fact i used the word rule . 
  my point was merely that most languages tend to stick the standard ( canonical ) constructions unless there is something that changing that would affect , as you said a nuance or subtlety . 
  people do n't just go messing with the conventional syntax for no reason whatsoever . 
  as far as i understand in this case we want to stress the unit `` barkeeper throw out '' but we do n't want to stress the `` you '' , because that would suggest that maybe someone else has been thrown out already , or that some other people want you thrown out . 
  just has in english '' * he 's * going to throw you out '' , `` he 's going to * throw * you out '' and `` he 's going to throw * you * out '' all have different nuances , so is it the case here but using syntax rather than word stress . 
  `` auch noch der barkeeper dich rausschmeissen '' what put too much stress on the `` you '' , `` dich auch noch der barkeeper rausschmeissen '' removes the `` dich '' from the scope of `` auch noch '' which avoids stressing the you ( as you say here `` what comes after `` auch noch '' basically tops whatever has gone before '' ) . 
  at least that 's what i think people are saying . 
  in other words my iteration would be `` now even the barkeeper wants to throw you out '' and which makes it sound like the shocking fact is that the barkeep , rather than other people , want to get rid of you , when in fact the kicker is the fact he 's prepared to go as far as throwing you out . 
  ( actually i 'm still not sure what the kicker is , the act of throwing out ? 
  the act of the barkeeper throwing you out ? 
  this is still not clear , and that 's what i 'm trying to understand ) . 
  we have some options for translation here . 
  i 'm trying to ascertain the precise sense of this construction . 
  i do n't need a lecture about how language functions , i 'm perfectly well acquainted with that , i 'm trying to understand this case to improve my german . 
  edit : i do n't mean cardinal i mean canonical , my bad , it 's been a while since my study days . 
  * bad * acting !, 
  [ ok how about this ] ( http://vocaroo.com/i/s0kz8gwrihae ) , i just read this off more naturally . 
  ok , but you asked me to read something off the cuff , and reading off the cuff is not so easy for language learners . 
  you ca n't fault me for doing what you asked . 
  the other text i virtually know off by heart which is why i used it . 
  maybe i should just say something and not read anything , because if it 's read , whether i know it off my heart or just read it off the cuff , it 's going to take time or it 's going to sound unnatural ... regardless , i 'm trying to find out how my accent sounds , and not about how well i can read out loud : / so far i 've been told i sound queer , which is n't particularly useful . 
  seriously , do n't give me that shit . 
  rewboss has n't answered my question at all really , maybe his first response was constructive but after that he 's just been lecturing me about shit that i already know and giving me a lecture about linguistics . 
  he 's presumed to teach me about cases , which frankly as someone who live in germany and speaks german every day is just offensive , and given me a lecture about prescriptivism and how grammatical rules are n't absolute laws which is entirely unnecessary . 
  i just want some to explain how syntactical differences actually impact the meaning of the construction , that 's it . 
  i do n't need a lecture of linguistics . 
  so far his answers have barely touched the issue . 
  if anything / u/23powerz 's answer were far more enlightening since they actually focussed on the language , unlike the other responses that just misinterpret what i 've said and tell me that i do n't understand how language works ... 
  i mean seriously let 's look at what rewboss has actually said . 
   german has cases which makes it possible -- and common -- to break the subject before object convention . 
  it does n't always work , and sometimes there 's ambiguity , but german word order is more flexible than english word order . 
  as a b2 speaker i obviously fucking know that . 
   that 's why you have to learn all those cases . 
  `` dich '' is clearly the direct object ( its case shows it ca n't be anything else ) and `` der barkeeper '' is obviously the subject ( the only alternative would be genitive plural , but that would make no sense ) . 
  again as a b2 speaker does he think i do n't know the difference between nominative and accusative pronouns ? 
  does he think i do n't know that 's obviously not a genitive construction ? 
  does he think i do n't know that the subject before object rule is not absolute ? 
   that 's not how languages work , though . 
  actually it is how language works . 
  if he bothered to consider what i said for a moment he 'd see that . 
  languages do n't usually alter the syntax for no reason whatsoever , i want to know why , not be told that i 'm somehow misunderstanding language . 
  subject before object is typical in german , if that rule is being broken there has to be a reason why . 
  i did n't say it was an absolute rule that should n't be broken , i merely asked what would be so important as to warrant abandoning that convention . 
  also how presumptive is it of someone to tell them that 's `` not how language works '' . 
  i 've actually studied philology , communication , the logic of natural language and the philosophy of language , i really do n't think i need to be told `` how language works '' . 
   grammar rules are n't the law : they are descriptions of how native speakers speak in real life, 
  which i never suggested they were , a completely irrelevant fact too , we 're not studying a construction belonging to an unconventional dialect , this is standard german . 
  what he said was patronising and did n't answer my question . 
  i would like to analyse the construction and find out what it means and why it is constructed in the way it is . 
  instead i 'm being told that it is `` cuz german '' and that i 'm not understanding language for asking why . 
  it 's fucking stupid . 
  if someone asked me what the difference between `` the fat man quickly ran to the bus stop '' and `` the fat man ran to the bus stop quickly '' , i 'd do my best to explain the nuance , not say `` cos english '' . 
  you learn languages through understanding why things are the way they are , so far nobody has really provided an adequate explanation of why it 's `` nun will dich auch noch der barkeeper rausscheissen '' rather than `` nun will auch noch der barkeeper dich rausscheissen '' or `` nun will der barkeeper dich auch noch rausscheissen '' , and saying `` cuz german '' is just fucking idiotic . 
  i 'm not op fyi . 
  the lovely rainy not even real mountains where you can get stabbed and buy skag !, 
  i 'm not being defensive i was agreeing with you , but just pointed out i have n't had much commentary on my pronunciation , rather my reading style . 
  whatever . 
  i 'm not mad at all . 
  i 'm just explaining the responses i 've had were not `` spot on '' as you said , i do n't know why you 're even involved to be honest . 
  your accent sounds very british but i can hear traces of what i think is scandinavian . 
  your accent is quite strong i 'm afraid . 
  i had a start time following in places . 
  when you say competitive the first time it sounds like comp-puh-tea-shun rather than comp-puh-ti-shun . 
  also when you say foods the first time it sounds like the vowel from `` foot '' when it sound be the vowel from zoom . 
  hope this helps . 
  it 's very good but there 's a few weird bits . 
  i 'd assume you were american/canadian from your `` tells '' but you could be australian or something i suppose . 
  hell you could be british and just messing with your accent a bit . 
  first thing i 'd note is the you pronounce `` cold '' like co-eld , ( `` co '' to rhyme with `` show '' , `` eld '' to rhyme with `` held '' ) . 
  this is n't wrong , it is traditionally the british pronunciation , however british english is undergoing a change with this set of words , almost young people now pronounce it differently , instead of pronouncing the `` co '' section to rhyme with `` show '' , they use the vowel from a word like `` lot '' . 
  this is also called the wholly / holy split . 
  young people now pronounce the words holly/wholly/holy with three different pronunciations , while in older speakers holy and wholly and homophones . 
   rise of the diphthong [ \u0252\u028a ] . 
  increasingly in rp words such as fold , goal are said with a back rounded diphthong with a starting point comparable to the [ \u0252 ] of lot . 
  this diphthong is found only before dark / l / , [ \u026b ] , or the vowel that develops from it ( see below ) . 
  speakers who do this are often quite conscious of the difference between their [ \u0252\u028a ] and ordinary [ \u0259\u028a ] . 
  through a process of morphological regularization , they may extend this to words where / l / is morpheme-final but followed by a vowel , yielding occasional minimal pairs such as wholly / \u02c8h\u0252\u028ali / vs. holy / \u02c8h\u0259\u028ali / . 
  this automatically marks you sounding a bit theatrical . 
  it 's not wrong but it 's not modern . 
  on a stage it would be fine but in real life it might raise some eyebrows if you did n't seem like the kind of person to use it . 
  another note . 
  it should be `` thee emperor '' not `` thuh emperor '' , british rp is still quite insistent on `` thee '' before a vowel ( although it can be used for stress as well ) . 
  your pronunciation of emperor with two syllables rather than three is spot on though , 
  the first point where you sound like someone who is n't british though is the word flowing . 
  the - n and - ng phonemes and pronounced differently in british and american english . 
  the `` ing '' comes out too nasally . 
  try to move the sound down from resonating in your nose so it 's more in your mouth and throat . 
  it will still resonate up there a little bit , it has to , but to sound british it should be at bare minimum .
