  also `` bloody '' is a give away too . 
  there is a difference between the way light `` l '' is pronounced in american and british english . 
  americans tend to stick their tongue on their back teeth and let the sound build up a bit more , when in british it should be lighter . 
  ok , another thing that sticks out to me is when you say `` the light now fled '' ( this is the most extreme example but it 's also happening with words like dead ) . 
  have you been practising by watching game of thrones or sean bean ? 
  because what you 're doing here is using the more open vowel [ \u025b ] instead of [ e ] . 
  the vowel is noticeably too open at times . 
  this is a feature of northern accents . 
  the problem is that your accent is n't a northern british accent in other regards so it does n't sit well together . 
  i think this raises an important point , if you want to sound more convincing now you 're going to need to really hone in on precisely which british accent you 're going for . 
  even within an accent like rp there are different forms , some more traditional , others more modern , some are more upper class and some are more middle class , some are more london influenced and some are more `` oxford english '' . 
  you 're best off picking a british actor and trying to imitate their speech exactly at this point , because then you know you 're getting something that phonetically sits well together . 
  finally , the pronunciation of eyes at the end is just a bit off . 
  sounds like `` oys '' or `` aw-yees '' . 
  you 've go to ensure the starting position of the diphthong is `` ah '' and not `` aw '' . 
  again , there are british accents that do make it sound more like oys , but the one i think you 're going for does n't . 
  [ here 's an audio explanation because it 's quite hard to explain in text ] ( http://vocaroo.com/i/s0i56atmkwoq ), 
  you should probably slow down and enunciate a bit more . 
  it does sound like you 're mumbling at times . 
  thing is , you 're pronouncing all the words correctly , you are n't mispronouncing vowels or consonants . 
  however what you have is an accent . 
  the thing about accents is that it 's usually not that one particular sound is completely wrong , stuff like that is easy to fix . 
  it 's more like , whenever someone attempts to speak in a foreign language , or speak with any accent that is n't there natural one , they do n't hit the vowels and consonants in exactly the same way as someone who has that accent . 
  what they do is an approximation of what they hear when people with that accent speak . 
  when we first do this we only really get half way there . 
  we end up creating sounds that are more like a compromise between our natural accent and the target accent . 
  as we improve the ratio changes , 30 % native accent influence combined with 70 % target accent influence , then 10 % native influence combined with 90 % target and so on . 
  this is what you have . 
  every vowel you say is slightly out , that 's just part of having an accent , with time your vowels will shift every closer to whatever your target accent is . 
  it ca n't really be fixed by an explanation , only with time and exposure to the target accent . 
  also , the accent you are closest to right now is general american , so that 's what you should work on as your target . 
  there are two kinds of countries , those that never had the bolshevik revolution and those that won the space race . 
  there are two kinds of countries , those that do n't eat bacalhau and those that discovered the new world . 
  there are two kinds of countries , those that do n't have queen elizabeth as the head of their national church and those that started the industrial revolution . 
  see it works for anything !, 
  after this we need some / r/eyebleach, 
  damn , i guess that what you get by learning german from war films and bavarians . 
  what 's the difference between the german and english `` l '' ? 
  i also recorded this [ one ] ( http://vocaroo.com/i/s0kz8gwrihae ) because someone said the other was too acted . 
  i see what you 're getting at it . 
  it 's not the actual `` l '' that 's different it 's the affect it 's having on the preceding vowel . 
  if you look at an english word like `` heel '' it 's actually pronounced like hie - el or hee - ul . 
  it probably does n't help that spiel is a german loanword in english which has taken on it 's own pronunciation and meaning : / you can blame german speaking american immigrants for that . 
  btw , do you know where i 'm from by hearing my accent ? 
  there 's no th in ticket and tin . 
  unless you 're trying to say thicket and thin . 
  in which case you definitely need to work on pronouncing your - th . 
  a lisp is a speech impediment which causes people to have trouble with certain sounds . 
  it can effect - s - z in german , the - s and - z in english , also the french - j sound . 
  i do n't think you actually have a speech impediment . 
  i think you 're just having trouble pronouncing the unvoiced - s sound . 
  as used in english words like seven and sorry and so on . 
  many german dialects do n't have this sound ( although they do in baden-w\u00fcrttemberg , where is replaces the typical german - s sound , which is actually the same as the english - z sound ) . 
  for example , in german you write sansibar and in english you write zanzibar in order to get the same pronunciation . 
  however the - s sound in english might be absent from your dialect your dialect which would explain your lisp . 
  ironically when you say words with - s in them it sounds a bit too close to - th . 
  lisp sounds like lithp . 
  so you definitely can say - th you just do n't know that you 're doing it . 
  this type of lisp is usually caused by incorrectly position your tongue when trying to english words that begin with s. 
  check where you tongue is when saying a word like sissy . 
  it should be relaxed and not be touching the back of your teeth or protruding between your teeth . 
  in fact , it should be in the same place as when you say a word with a - z. 
  try saying zebra and then saying sebra , for both words you should have your tongue in the same place for the first letter . 
  in other to learn how to say - th then you need to do this in reverse . 
  in this case , your tongue needs to be touching the back of your top front teeth . 
  another thing you do which makes me suspect you 're a german speaker is that you pronounce words beginning with - a like they are usually pronounced in german . 
  for example , when you say the word accent . 
  in german , typically there is something called a glottal stop before words beginning with - a. 
  this is when the flow of air in your throat is stopped for a split second before you pronounce the sound which causes a pause in sound . 
  you need to stop doing this when talking english . 
  hope this helps , also if you are a german speaker , please judge my accent [ in this thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/judgemyaccent/comments/3zvfrc/what_does_my_accent_sound_like_to_you_german/ ) , 
  fyi that 's not a trilled - r . in english the common - r 's are alveolar approximant and retroflex approximant , so i do n't know why you 're want them trilled : /, 
  ah ok [ here ] ( http://vocaroo.com/i/s0i56atmkwoq ) is what i sound like in english ( from a response in another thread ) , which is probably some of the reason why i sound the way i do in german :d the british accent i have tends to be quite cut and precise which i think is contributing to why people keep saying my german sounds campy / queer . 
  when you said `` i speak a language called esperanto '' i thought you mean you were fluent in it . 
  it did n't come across like `` i 'm learning a language called esperanto '' . 
  a trilled - r is a rolled a - r like a spanish person or russian my use . 
  ah ok well . 
  everything is still valid just ignore the part about german then . 
  you 're going to need to learn the differences between the various sounds `` s '' `` z '' still . 
  the english - s is equivalent to the french - \u00e7 , and the english - z is equivalent to the french - s when it appears in a word like `` d\u00e9sol\u00e9 '' . 
  try imagining a word like lisp is written li\u00e7p , that might help . 
  you should also look a guide on how to pronounce - th and get practising . 
  ok so now it sounds like you 're saying the `` duh tin rat ran down duh street '' , it 's really common for foreigner language speakers to do this so do n't stress it . 
  there 's some stuff you 'll need to understand to do it right . 
  first off you need to realise that - th actually represents two different sounds . 
  one of them is voiced and the other is unvoiced . 
  when a sound is voiced it means that the vocal chords in your throat are vibrating , just like when you hum a song . 
  humming is vibrating your vocal chords with your mouth closed . 
  however when we want to say words , we do this humming but use the shape of our mouths to change the quality of the sound . 
  that said , some sounds are unvoiced so the humming is n't happening . 
  for example the letter - f is pronounced unvoiced but the letter - v is voiced . 
  likewise , the soft - s sound ( in french \u00e7 ) is unvoiced , but the english - z sound is voiced . 
  - th has an unvoiced version as in `` thing '' and `` fourth '' and `` thin '', 
  and a voiced version as in `` that '' and `` the '' and `` bathe '', 
  so when you understand this you can practice them separately like they were two different sounds . 
  right now your voiced - th sounds like - d and your unvoiced sounds like - t , but do n't worry about that . 
  the reason it goes to a - d is because the starting position in the mouth with a - d is similar to a - th . 
  when you start a - d the tip of your tongue should be touching the back of your top front teeth and the area at the front of the roof of your mouth . 
  however , the - th is slightly different because instead of back of the teeth , the tip of your tongue should be touching the edge of your top front teeth . 
  so move your tongue forward and press the tip against the sharp edge of your two front teeth .
