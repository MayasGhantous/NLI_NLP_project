  the other major difference is that when you say a - d , your tongue quickly moves down as the sound is made . 
  however , to make the - th sound you need to keep your tongue in that position and blow air out of your mouth around the gaps just like how you blow air out when you say the letter - f. it 's a bit like hissing . 
  now the only difference you need to master to do the voiced and unvoiced separately is to learn to do it both while making sound in your voice box , and also learning to do with without making sound in your voice box . 
  remember that your tongue should stay in that position until the sound is over . 
  the sound is not made by moving your tongue but my keeping it still . 
  have a practice and maybe you 'll get it . 
  does n't sound asian or french to me . 
  strange accent , very hard to place but noticeable not native . 
  quite a good accent all round though , you 've obviously worked hard to remove the traces of your native accent . 
  you do n't sound like any ukrainians i 've met . 
  one word that stuck to me is causes . 
  here you use the vowel that would normally be used in words like `` no '' and `` show '' . 
  your pronunciation sounds like `` hoses '' but starting with a - c instead of an - h. 
  this is not the correct vowel to use . 
  one vowel you can use here is the same one as in the ukrainian which would be written - o as in a word like \u043a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430 . 
  the other vowel , which is more american style , would be written in ukrainian as \u0430 or \u044f . 
  feel free to use either , everyone will understand regardless , just do n't use the vowel you used in the recording . 
  also i did n't understand a word or two , at the end you say `` xxxxx for research '' and i ca n't understand what precedes it . 
  are you saying subcessional grants for research ? 
  it 's quite unclear . 
  you did at one point sound like you 'd got it , but then you went back to doing it wrong xd . 
  remember it 's not a hard sound like a - d or a - t , it 's a soft breathy sound like an - s or an - f . this is what it sounded like, 
  duh tin rat ran down duh , ** the ** , duh street , how 's zat , how 's ** that ** . 
  try to focus in on what you did on the one before last time you said `` the '' and he last time you said `` that '' , because that 's when you got closest to doing it right . 
  try doing an exercise like this, 
  i realise it 's hard because it 's scientifically been shown that you actually have to learn the difference between - th and other sounds like - f over time . 
  people who do n't speak english are actually unable to tell the difference . 
  you have to tune your ear to recognise the difference in the sound the air makes as it flows around your tongue when making a - th sound . 
  yes , your accent is very good and clear , easy to understand . 
  also , you 're lucky to be swedish because it 's one of those accents that sounds very nice in english ( unlike german or russian ) , very musical and pleasant to the ear . 
  i 'm sure lots of guys would go for it haha . 
  you do n't mispronounce any words so really you 'll only be able to improve now by immersing yourself in the sound of british people speaking and naturally the swedish influences will become less and less apparent until you could pass for a brit . 
  i would n't worry , with the accent you have right now you could easily do any job in the english speaking world , teacher , doctor , customer services , so you it 's up to you if you want to bother trying to sound native . 
  when americans say you sound british do n't listen to them :d what they mean is that some of words you pronounce are the british pronunciations . 
  for example if you pronounce the word `` car '' like \u043a\u0430 like british people do instead of using the american rrrr sound at the end , or if you say words like `` pass '' like \u043f\u0430\u0441 instead of using the vowel from words like `` cat '' and `` pat '' , then they 'll say you sound british . 
  that does n't mean you actually sound like a british person though , just that you use you the british pronunciation model . 
  the vast majority of english learners in europe do this because the '' \u044f '' sound exists in virtually all european languages while the english `` cat '' vowel only exists in a few , also the american `` rrrr '' sound can be hard to master as it does n't exist in any other european languages except a few weird dutch dialects . 
  i 'm not american but you definitely sound foreign to me , hard to place , you could be italian or you could be asian . 
  your accent is n't super strong but noticeable . 
  your pronunciation leans more towards american english but does n't really sound american . 
  nonetheless it 's safe to say you 'll be understood with this accent in the english speaking world . 
  to me you sound a bit indian . 
  your accent is quite american . 
  very understandable , but there 's no way you 'd pass for an american . 
  you sound like an immigrant who has lived in america for a number of years and picked up the accent but not completely lost your native accent . 
  i 'm blowing the air out but deliberately super elongating the sound to give you an idea of what should be going on with your mouth . 
  try getting your mouth in the right - th position and then blowing the air out for a few seconds and then forming the actual word . 
  also the word is sucking * !, 
  speak like what exactly ? 
  your accent right now is perfectly understandable provided you do n't mess up words like you did with causes and substantial . 
  some people think the american accent is easier but i ca n't really understand why they think that , i think it 's just because they are exposed to it more often , it bears less similarity to most european languages since it has a higher frequency of / ae / and it has the `` rrr '' sound that comes after the vowel which has to be learnt . 
  how difficult it is to make this sound differs from person to person . 
  much like the rolled - r in russian some people can master it in 10 minutes and others still struggle after years of practice . 
  american english has fewer vowels though , and fewer diphthongs , but that sometimes means the pronunciation is not reflected by the spelling . 
  for example , most foreign learners would not expect `` cot '' and `` caught '' to be pronounced the same as they are in most american dialects . 
  also most european language speakers would not expect the letter - o to be pronounced like \u044f / a. 
  i do n't really know what you mean about - t . the english - t is very similar to the ukrainian - t ( there is some slight difference between where the tongue is positioned ) . 
  again american english confuses things , by pronouncing - t like a - d when it appears in the middle or at the end of a word , but now at the beginning . 
  either way the best way is to find which you find easiest and then stick to it . 
  you 'll find more american films and tv series of course , but for most of europe they 'll find more brits to practice with , and more brits working as languages teachers , and more courses that teach british english . 
  ultimately unless you 're trying to sound completely native to the point where people ca n't tell you 're not a native english speaker then mixing the two wo n't matters since the two versions of english at like 95 % + mutually intelligible . 
  haha , did bj\u00f6rk have something to do with this . 
  sounds very scandinavian . 
  ah ok , the aspiration . 
  you 'll find that it wo n't really matter matter * that * much if you speak clearly . 
  people will understand an unaspirated version as being similar enough to the aspirated version that they wo n't get confused at least even though you wo n't sound native . 
  sometimes unaspirated p sounds like b to me though . 
  as for the glottal stop , this is not part of `` proper '' british english , and is only present some dialects . 
  it 's part of london working class accents and since london is pretty much the only place foreigners know about in the uk it 's over represented in media compared to how often it 's actually used . 
  it 's really up to you which one you use , you have to decide for yourself . 
  right now you sound like you 're leaning slightly more towards british so maybe stick with that , but you 'll have to try out different things and find what works for you . 
  as i said , it does n't really matter if you mix the two a bit unless you 're trying to pass for british or pass for american . 
  here you go . 
  thing is though , singers have been avoiding rhotic pronunciations while singing since forever . 
  tonnes of american pop singers who normally speak rhotically cease to do so when they 're singing , otherwise it 's greatly reduced . 
  either way , it has n't led to this kind of phenomenon until now . 
  maybe it 's simply the fact that many non-native speakers are popular in this genre , which has led to the genre developing a non-native accent style , just like how singers of soul and blues outside of america tend to adopt american pronunciations into their singing . 
  lol i 'm pretty sure you americans are slowly working on removing all the vowels from english . 
  yeah , because they did oo, 
  i think the trick is to not force sounding native really hard . 
  i 've known a few people who do this and they end sounding strange . 
  for example i knew one guy who sounded like dick van dyke and another guy who ended up sounding like an 80s punk rocker because they pushed their accent too hard in a certain direction that they thought was `` british sounding '' . 
  i have this problem in german with people sounding i sound like a parody of camp nazi soldier ( damn you inglorious bastards ) . 
  you do n't need push your accent any harder , you 're saying all the words correctly , you just need to let your ear naturally tune itself to the sounds of british accents and it will come naturally . 
  i will say that you sound like you 're leaning towards very standard british bbc english ( like a newsreader , not like the queen or anything too posh like that , just very standard middle class ) , at this stage , it will help you to learn how to pick out the different types of british accent you hear . 
  the more you hone in this kind of accent , which really easy since it 's very common on british television , the quicker you 'll naturally adopt it . 
  if you just listen to british accents generally without recognising what kind they are i.e cockney , northern , west country , then you might end up mixing up accent features which will inadvertently make you sound more foreign . 
  seems like a pretty standard british accent , ca n't really tell if it 's north or south , but there 's something off about it which is probably been affected by your currently primary language . 
  i suppose if you went to the uk now they 'd assume you were a foreigner who 'd been living here a very long time , like 10 + years . 
  you sound like an middle eastern american . 
  some words that stick out are five = sounds like foive and `` his leaders '' which sounds a bit like hiss leaders . 
  the london conurbation spreads even further , if we simply counted that i 'm pretty london would have 12 + million people . 
  it 's the same with other cities in the uk , if their conurbations were could n't both birmingham and manchester would have 2.5 million + people . 
  ireland has had constant emigration though since that time . 
  not just to the us , but millions of irish have moved to britain and been completely integrated to the point that many would n't know about their ancestry . 
  in the us people think ancestry is important but in the uk within one or two generations that family will be entirely british . 
  it will be to do with the age of the population . 
  if we want to know how many people will be born in 2030 , then we need to look at people born around the 2000 's , in 1995-2005 say . 
  since we already know this figure we can predict the growth rate . 
  traditional white european values * , should point out we were n't the only ones .
