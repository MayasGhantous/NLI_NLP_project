  you 'll also meet english speaking germans there who 'll help you with your german if you insist upon speaking it . 
  your problems sound like non-problems to me , and are really indicative of a deeper problem of unhappiness the product of lacking proper social support . 
  the public insurers in germany and the nhs in the uk are not strictly for profit services like in the us . 
  you are not a customer you are a patient . 
  they cure you when you are sick because it 's their duty , not because of the money they know they 'll get money for doing so . 
  doctors in the us are incentivised to respond to every whim of the patient and even go overboard on testing and diagnosis because every little thing = more money for their industry , they are also terrified of malpractice lawsuits . 
  in germany , the national insurer are nationalised insurance funds . 
  you do not pay the market value premium for the coverage you get . 
  you essentially pay a nominal charge and the tax payer pays the rest of the cost , otherwise you 'd be paying a hell of a lot more for coverage or you would n't get the same level of coverage . 
  you can not go bankrupt here because the insurer did n't cover you for something , and you should never be left out of pocket . 
  if you lose your job you can fall back on the state to pay your premiums provided you 're in the system . 
  ironically it 's in the us where the care is n't `` patient focussed '' , rather it 's financially focussed . 
  in a country like germany you will get far more patient focussed care than you could ever get in the us because the doctor will do their best to decide what is the right decision for your situation with little to no financial issues clouding their judgement . 
  they will not pump you full of drugs you do n't really need . 
  must i remind you that statistically americans consume the most drugs per capita of any developed nation while have pretty mediocre average health and life expectancy . 
  i would be nervous having to deal with an american doctor whose advice is so obviously financially incentivised . 
  the reasons the doctors are getting annoyed with you for asking about specific treatments is because here they are the experts who are meant the decisions about what you need , you are n't meant to have a say in what you get just because you saw an advert on television that seemed convincing . 
  furthermore , you are presumptuous in thinking that germany does n't have all the same medicines as are available in the us . 
  of course it does , they just are n't called by their us `` brand names '' here but rather by their proper scientific names , or at least by the brand names the european drug manufacturers have deemed to give them . 
  many of them are mostly likely prescription only here in germany because the regulations on what chemists can sell is sometimes more restrictive . 
  if you want those drugs you 're going to need to do your research and speak with a doctor , and that doctor is going to have to decide that that medication is what is best for you . 
  your feelings are irrelevant , you know nothing of medicine , so why should your opinion matter , your roles is nothing more that giving feedback on how the treatment is affecting you and only in situations when that ca n't be objectively measured . 
  lots of what you say is just typical whining that i 've come to expect from a portion of the american ex-pat community . 
  do n't like the coke ? 
  try some fritz-cola . 
  do n't like m&m 's ? 
  try some milka chocolate . 
  it 's just childish to complain about these things , adults should not care about pointless stuff like cola and sweets brands . 
  again you moan about air conditioning , but you do n't seem to understand that we do n't want air conditioning . 
  i find it hard to sleep ** with ** air conditioning . 
  so why would you expect us to have it . 
  for the whole 2 months a year it actually gets above 25 degrees i sleep with a fan , and i 'm quite happy with that . 
  moreover , it 's not like air conditioning is n't available , if you want it then buy it , do n't expect it to be provided . 
  you seem to be complaining like there 's something wrong here . 
  the problem is with you . 
  i 've been to the us many times , and i like many europeans despise the service culture in the us , it makes us feel awkward and uncomfortable , just as we hate being pestered by waiters checking up on us and giving us the bill the moment we 've finished and expecting a 15 % tip . 
  yet we do n't expect the us to change , you have your way , we have our way , which you like is personal preference . 
  now imagine how all the europeans living and working in the us feel every day ? 
  they probably feel much like you do . 
  as someone who has been here much longer than you have and has been through all the culture shock and adapting i 'm going to tell you something straight up , and i 'm not saying this to be a dick but just simply to help , but the problem ** is you ** . 
  there is nothing wrong with the german way of doing it just as there is nothing wrong with the british way of doing it or even the american way of doing it ( politics aside ) . 
  sure there are things that annoy me from time to time , sunday closing hours , annoying bureaucracy , but then i think about all the great things about living in germany and realise that . 
  on a cost-benefit analysis , living here is just as good as living in the uk and therefore i have no reason to be unhappy here . 
  you have a choice , either change your attitude , or go back to the country you came from , simple as that . 
  do n't expect germans to agree with you when you list of a bunch of stuff that is pissing you off , it is this way because germans want it to be this way , not because they 're unaware of how things work in the us . 
  i have nothing against the us , btw , i , like , many europeans are n't fond of the politics over there , but americans themselves are just people like any other country . 
  you however , are displaying an attitude that seems to occur frequently in american ex-pats ( but often happens to brits as well ) , and that 's coming here not being willing to change your outlook , you think you should be catered for because you 're used to having been catered for your whole life , however you are mistaken in that belief . 
  ironically english speaking ex-pats have it fucking easy comparatively , and if you were german and moving to the us you 'd be having it twice as bad , so think about that . 
  sadly i think these kind of sub-cultural movements are gone forever . 
  at least ones of the same magnitude . 
  the internet changed culture forever . 
  back then , cultural movements seemed to just come out of nowhere , it would happen almost completely by chance that a tiny minority of people where into the same fashions and same ideas at the same time . 
  then young people would see these people dressing and acting the way they did , expressing the attitudes they did , and then copy , growing and developing the cultural zeitgeist . 
  their growth was exponential , very slow at first and then accelerating until they suddenly and rapidly exploded . 
  it was n't until they exploded that the mainstream culture would become aware of their existence . 
  if you were n't `` in the know '' it was very hard to penetrate the underground culture without a concerted effort - keeping your eyes and ears open for new things . 
  something that young people tend to do but older folk are n't that interested in . 
  this made it all feel so much cooler , so much more exclusive , the young folk could laugh at the ignorance the older generations about their `` things '' . 
  take this video here . 
  despite the fact that the guy had a camcorder , how many people do you think saw the video of this rave before it was published on the internet ? 
  how many people actually bought the vhs that the rave organiser got `` blue mutt productions '' to make ? 
  a few thousand i 'd reckon at best . 
  the popular wisdom says that bands become uncool the moment your parents ( or more like your parent 's generation ) , start listening to them . 
  i think this is true not only of music but all this youth culture stuff . 
  it was only when these things reached a certain critical mass that the mainstream media would grasp onto and categorise them . 
  it was only then that older generations and ordinary folk would be able to be aware of what was going on , and this usually heralded the beginning of the end for any of the youth cultural movements , however , it could be years until this actually happened . 
  it was only then that the concepts and ideas that culture represented could be repackaged and cynically commercialised for easy consumption . 
  this is exactly what happened to electronic music culture in the 90s . 
  compare the warehouse raves of the early 90s with the commercial big beat of the late 90s and early 00s . 
  it started underground and cool , slowly became more mainstream until the young people lost interest . 
  by the early 00s ibiza was full of rich coked up 30 year old bankers paying obscene amounts for drinks . 
  the difference is today , in my humble opinion , is the internet . 
  today , being in the know is simply a matter of going to the effort to seek it out online , and that 's available to everyone . 
  as soon as something interesting develops or happens , as soon as a new thing is discovered , it 's only a matter of time before it 's available for everyone to discover online . 
  whether people actually bother to do so is irrelevant , the point is that they can , there is no barrier to sub-culture any more , and therefore nothing to make it feel as special and mysterious . 
  the cool factor is gone . 
  many older people look at today 's young people and think they all look rather similar . 
  you do n't need the mods vs rockers , the goths vs the new wavers , the ravers vs the hip-hop heads , the skaters vs chavs , any more . 
  that kind of youth tribalism is out of vogue . 
  however , is that surprising given the rate we consume and spread culture around these days via the internet ? 
  the moment something like that got going it would be picked up on , put on youtube , explained and demystified . 
  it would n't be sub-culture it would just be culture , singular , which explains why kids do n't feel the need to act like that any more . 
  i do n't know how many redditors remember what it like to be a teenager in the days before the internet . 
  sitting at home with your records , or cassettes , or cds and really thinking that they were reflective of your identity . 
  passing other groups of kids on the streets and being generally curious about what they were into , whether they knew about music or scenes you 'd never heard of , longing for that sense of belonging , of being on the cutting edge , a member of the tribe . 
  now kids have every song ever written at the click of their fingers , why would they choose to identify with one scene or genre over all others ? 
  such things seem terribly old fashioned . 
  they know exactly what they peers are up to because they see it on social media . 
  we 've swapped slow moving viral culture with lightening fast viral videos , and we 've swapped hidden cultural trends with trending topics on twitter . 
  the internet has changed the way our culture functions at a very deep level , whether we like it or not . 
  so what you meant to say is `` relevancy scale '' not the relevant * scale . 
  i was sitting there asking myself which scale exactly was the relevant one . 
  that 's also kind of untrue . 
  australia is pretty relevant compared to many countries . 
  rich , english speaking , well developed , it 's a hell of a lot more relevant than namibia . 
  additionally , the pay has nothing to do with how relevant the country is , and is far more likely to be combination of how wealthy the country is and how comfortable the populace is with their leader earning lots of money . 
  what a fascinating and interesting response . 
  what you have in a america today is a pale comparison to this . 
  the edm scene in the us seems to be like `` stadium edm '' , big names , expensive tickets , controlled environments , lots of low quality knock off `` molly '' that does n't have any mdma in it . 
  it 's really just a shadow of the old days .
