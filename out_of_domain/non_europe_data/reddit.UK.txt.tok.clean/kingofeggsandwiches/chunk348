  maybe they do . 
  [ this is quite interesting what he says here ] ( https://youtu.be/oe7rauh12as?t=2040 ) about how dance music started in the us but never really caught on to the same degree . 
  i think the us missed out on this era because of the rise of hip-hop there . 
  while this was going on in the uk , it was being eclipsed in the us by biggie and tupac and the like . 
  hip-hop did have a following in the uk but it was never really that massive since the uk did n't really have a strong hip-hop scene . 
  people were more interested in dance music during the 90s . 
  home-made uk hip-hop never really broke the mainstream , it had to develop into separate genres like grime and garage to find a stronger following . 
  even us hip-hop i would argue did n't become really successful in the uk until the 00s with the rise of artists like eminem who had more of a universal appeal , since britons naturally had a harder time identifying with african-american culture . 
  the uk definitely went big on more urban styles in the 00s , so maybe this was an attempt to switch over from the rave culture peace and love to something more in tune with what had been happening in the states . 
  likewise it 's take until the late 00s for edm to really catch on the us , as it was n't until then that it could be synthesised with the dominating us concepts of what was cool . 
  different countries means different attitudes , brits did n't fancy hip-hop because it was too aggressive , too ethnic and too foreign , meanwhile americans did n't like edm because it was n't gangster and had an association with gay communities in chicago . 
  it took each country a while to reconcile their perceptions of it , for the music industries to find ways to market to them they 'd find agreeable to their tastes . 
  it 's clear as day really , when you look at the edm that succeeding in breaking the us it was more aggressive , broken beat styles like dubstep , and if you look at how hip-hop broke the uk it was via more dance influenced styles like garage and grime as a gateway . 
  i think the eternal september phenomenon is a related idea but not quite the same . 
  it 's not solely that things blow up too fast that stop them being the same , although that is a big part of it , i think it 's also got a lot to do with the information being far more theoretically accessible as well . 
  anything that 's very good but very small and unknown does tend to get changed by newcomers . 
  the rate of newcomers to a community too fast meaning that the thing ultimately gets changed by the new arrivals rather than the new arrivals being moulded by the original concept . 
  however , i think the way that information about stuff just being out there , and requiring no barrier to entry , removes some of the exclusive `` chosen ones '' vibe scenes used to have . 
  the feeling of being fortunate to be part of something special and unique is hard to come by without the deliberate exclusion of people , because back in the day merely the fact you knew a party or event were going on was proof enough of your worthiness . 
  things do of course blow up much faster these days , but neither can anyone maintain the pretence of amongst a special group either . 
  i agree . 
  93 was pretty much the critical mass of the explosion as evidenced by the tens of thousands of people at this event . 
  the underground phase was before this and what came after this showed increasing control and commercialisation . 
  93 after all was the summer of love , and will go down in the history books as the most crazy summer for rave culture , the point when the culture really exploded but before it was really well understood . 
  cool story , i live in one of the biggest student villages in my country , i am surrounded by young people at work and every time i go out for a drink . 
  furthermore , i was n't denying there are sub-cultures either , i was merely pointing out that we do n't see youth movements of the scale we used to any more . 
  i certainly do n't want to look through , but if you 're susceptible to stage fright this must be a nightmare . 
  that 's quite an american thing , never seen an open casket in europe , nor ever heard of one . 
  i feel the same about `` focussed '' and `` focused '', 
  this is so hilariously shit and wrong . 
  english has 11 vowels excluding schwa . 
  it would as simple as having :, 
  a = `` ah '' as in father, 
  \u00e4 = `` a '' as in cat, 
  i = `` i '' as in sit, 
  \u00ef = `` ee '' as in meet, 
  e = `` e '' as in bed, 
  \u00eb = `` u '' as in putt, 
  u = `` oo '' / `` u '' as in book / put, 
  \u00fc = `` oo '' / `` u '' as in zoom / mute, 
  o = `` o '' as in not, 
  \u00f6 = `` o '' / `` aw '' as in law, 
  y = `` ur '' / `` er '' / `` ir '' / `` or '' as in word / bird / herd, 
  all the rest are diphthongs and could be written roughly how they 're pronounced . 
  i\u00eb = here, 
  ei = day, 
  u\u00eb = tour, 
  \u00f6i = boy, 
  e\u00eb = wear, 
  ai = eye, 
  au = how, 
  it 's nothing to do with the fact that english is a mix of difference languages , most languages are . 
  the difference is that english missed the boat when it came to developing a phonetic spelling system . 
  by the time the first dictionaries were being written english was already being spread all over the world . 
  standardisation really just reflected convention . 
  even just within england , there was n't an agree upon standard pronunciation until the 19th century to base a phonetic orthography off . 
  what you 're say makes no sense whatsoever though , because german has a phonetic spelling and there was far more linguistic variation across the area we now call germany than within the english speaking world . 
  what they spoke in the south was pretty much a different language to that in the north . 
  however because germany unified later it needed the standardisation to assert it 's unity , `` hochdeutsch '' was agreed upon and everyone learned that despite still speaking their own dialects amongst their own . 
  english 's lack of diacritics is a product of history , nothing to do with english being more of a mixture of other languages or being more evolved . 
  what it really is to do with is that fact that english lost its diacritics at some point in history , then around the time of the first dictionaries spelling was standard enough at the time that we could make do with convention , then later on when more formal theories about phonetics existed it was impossible to change without making it almost a completely different language from that spoken in other countries . 
  you 're missing the point entirely . 
  i never said there are n't any underground raves any more . 
  it 's nothing to do with music genres . 
  the point is merely that youth culture movements of this scale ca n't happen because the way that they are seized upon and demystified so much sooner , a product of the internet lowering the barrier to mainstream access . 
  sure there are still small niche underground scenes and parties , however when something like that starts to get bigger they are quickly engulfed by mainstream culture . 
  this means they lose their underground feel at a comparatively much smaller number of participants than before the internet was part of everyone 's life . 
  that is my point , nothing else . 
  should n't you be called `` dial_a_clich\u00e9 '' ? 
  you yank bastard ? 
  it 's only danny fucking dyer !, 
  i remember seeing a talk by her father . 
  the advice was completely messed up . 
  he essentially said that you 're better off drinking , smoking weed or snorting coke than messing with any of that e or hallucinogenic stuff , because we know the worst that these drugs can do . 
  totally ignoring the pharmacological side of things, 
  i just never got gabba and hardcore , that kind of music would bring me down off whatever high i was enjoying . 
  it 's like what they might play in hell . 
  i 'm not saying there are n't any good raves around . 
  i just mean the big edm movement in the us is as i described . 
  there 's been good raves with good drugs all over the world from 1985-now , i was referring only to the big edm movement that happened in recent years in the us, 
  they are similar , and in old english for example they were the same . 
  however most native english speakers pronounce the vowel not only shorter but ever so slightly more back in the mouth and ever so slightly more open . 
  that 's why when french people say `` bitch '' many english speaker hear `` beach '' no matter how short they make the vowel . 
  [ check out this chart ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ipa_vowel_chart_with_audio ), 
  i = ee as in meet , but \u026a = i as in sit . 
  pretty much !, 
  i was there man . 
  i used to spend a lot of time when i lived in the uk splitting my time between the local speed garage and drum n bass scenes ( mostly jump up in those days ) . 
  the dubstep came along early in the 00s and it was nothing like what dubstep became once it started going global . 
  my first experiences of it were at drum n bass raves when the a dj would throw in the occasional dubstep style track , before it had even become a proper genre in its own right . 
  by the time it was like the late 00s i was totally disillusioned with it too , as well as the drum n bass scene which has the same thing happen to it with liquid dnb . 
  the only difference was that i quite liked liquid dnb , but i did n't like the level of commercialisation its popularity brought . 
  the time i deliberately tried to go raving at my favourite club the whole thing had changed , x10 as many people , tonnes of pretentious types and a lot of fake mdma and mephedrone ( mcat ) . 
  the way the scene blew up back then , practically overnight , pretty much demonstrates exactly what i 'm getting at , as well as removing the mystique of the culture around it because anyone could get their hands on it . 
  it 's impossible nowadays to convince yourself that a big event is still underground , but in the 90s it certain was , which is the other thing i was getting at . 
  i 'm quite a fan of vapourwave , but do n't really know anything about the scene . 
  you 're missing the point . 
  as i said in another comment . 
   i never said there are n't any underground raves any more . 
  it 's nothing to do with music genres .
