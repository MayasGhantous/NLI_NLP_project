  the programmer knows programming , the server admin understands how to manage his server , the designer knows how to make pretty looking webpages display in different browsers , however it 's only really the hardware expert that actually knows what makes it all happen at a physical level , and that person might not have a great understanding of other things going on at a software level , so it 's only the real fucking expert with the cs masters and the 20 years of industry experience who really gets the full picture of the wtf is actually going on in a computer . 
  and that 's why it 's hard to understand kk !, 
  now despair when you realise that the majority of people who use computers for a living are actually only at the mum or at best brother level of competence depending on how old they are , computers may as well be magic to them and when anything unusual happen they 're just completely frustrated and terrified . 
  oh ok , it 's just the rest of the english speaking world use the english word for it because they speak english , do you see ? 
  by rest of the world , i meant all the people who speak english but do n't live in north america , and since we 're speaking english i do n't think you can count mexico , chile and peru . 
  canada is in north america . 
  i do n't see what 's wrong with pointing out that everyone else calls it coriander ( when they 're speaking english ) . 
  a common trait i see in people , even people who i do n't really dislike , is the need to chip away at someone in trivial ways . 
  i do n't mean in the really nasty way some people do it with obvious ill intentions , i just mean in a kind of childish way . 
  drop a glass ? 
  oh you 're so clumsy !, 
  make a slight error like getting the name of a band wrong !, 
  oh do you ever get things right !, 
  have a single button undone on your fly ? 
  did you dress yourself backwards today !, 
  it 's in a `` we like you but you 're this or that '' way , i think people get it from their parents , the need to use other peoples mistakes as a way to get a tactical advantage , a way to make other people feel more grateful towards them for being their friend by making them feel slightly less confident . 
  my attitude has always been that we 're all fallible and not to sweat the small stuff . 
  the people who do this make just as many trivial mistakes as everyone else . 
  it 's something i see commonly in work environment too , even amongst friends , because it 's a slight dominance move . 
  they want to appear more capable and thorough than the others . 
  i tend to just ignore it because i know a lot of these people ca n't really help it , but when others make trivial mistakes and never use it against them , which is probably a product of my up bringing too . 
  pretty sure he was n't serious ... 
  here are some things that are probably wrong with your dialect ... 
  - `` these apples are different than these apples '' - most americans say this , but hang on a second , `` than '' is for comparatives and saying something is different is n't a comparative , you 'd need to say `` these apples are more different than these apples '' for that to work . 
  surely you should be saying `` these apples are different from these apples . '', 
  - `` he just did it '' - seems grammatical at first , but hang on , the perfect aspect is often used to express when there is a close or special connection between a past event and a current state of affairs . 
  `` just '' here reinforces that something is recent and still has a bearing on the present , so surely this should be `` he 's just done it '' , and the same goes for other words like `` already '' and `` yet '' , all demand the perfect aspect . 
  ( in fact op 's statement should be corrected to `` they 've done '' and not `` did '' ) . 
  - `` it tastes like it should '' - again perfectly comprehensible english . 
  but wait a minute , `` should '' is a verb and `` like '' is a word that 's used for asserting similarity to things not actions . 
  it should read `` it tastes as it should '' . 
  - `` lay down on the ground ! '' . 
  again a really common way of speaking in much of america . 
  however the official form for the intransitive verb `` to lie '' is lie / lay / lain . 
  so that should be `` lie down on the ground ! '' . 
  same goes for `` i laid in bed all day '' , no , `` you lay in bed all day '' . 
  - `` he likes pizza more than me '' . 
  initially we 'd assume that he 's a pizza a fan and that the speaker of this sentence is n't so keen . 
  however , hang on , what if he 's saying that his friend prefers pizza over hanging out together , that he 'd rather go eat pizza than socialise with him . 
  that would be the same right ? 
  so if you want the former you need to say `` he likes pizza more than i '' . 
  - `` he 's going to try and learn grammar '' . 
  i 'd wager the majority of people would say this . 
  however , what 's this ? 
  he 's going to try , and then completely separately learn grammar ? 
  what do you mean ? 
  he 's just going to go around `` trying '' in the general sense ? 
  is he a judge trying people for crimes ? 
  oh right , you mean `` he 's going to try to learn grammar '' . 
  however , because i 'm not an arsehole ( yes , an arsehole , because an `` ass '' is another word for donkey ) , i am perfectly willing to accept that these `` mistakes '' are n't mistakes but actually perfectly reasonable uses of the language in much of the world , so why you 're getting so pissed off about this guy defending his dialect i will never understand . 
  they 've done *, 
  actually , not really . 
  not all german towns are historically important enough to warrant anglicised spellings . 
  if a town or city became significant to english history before a certain point then it will most likely have an anglicised name . 
  mannheim most likely had alternative spellings in its history , but it was the modern german version that reached england by the time of international standardisation . 
  hanover however may well have been given a standard english spelling before any german spelling reforms . 
  in german generally a double letter signifies that the vowel is short , so that extra - n may have been added at some point to make that clear . 
  another example is braunschweig , which in english is called brunswick . 
  this is because they were ruled over by the same king at some point and so the people of the past felt an anglicisation was in order . 
  however , a town like chiemsee in rural bavaria was never that significant , so never got a foreign version . 
  basically , hanover is the odd one out because of the hanoverian dynasty ruling over britain . 
  most likely britain kept the original spelling as standard and germany reformed it to make the pronunciation more obvious . 
  mannheim however was never historically as significant to the uk , so they just adopted the modern spelling when it became necessary . 
  ah but if you raise the image of your resort even further you can get away with charging people more for those rooms and ski passes . 
  think about that for a moment . 
  if they tried it in finland they 'd be like `` we 're going all the way to austria to ski ? 
  why not just drive down the road to those bloody great mountains over there ? '', 
  lol this ca n't be real . 
  you do n't see it because probably half of all native english speakers speak this way . 
  while op 's way of speaking tends to be a london accent kind of thing , although there may be other places i 'm aware of the speak the same way . 
  all my examples though probably started off as regional corruptions at one point and spread around to affect whole countries to the point where they 're considered standard or at least legitimate alternatives . 
  still , reddit 's reaction to this guy writing the way he speaks is totally uncalled for . 
  if you think sounding like an inbred kennedy or katherine hepburn is classy i guess . 
  it 's all contextual . 
  typically in the world of telemarketing and customer `` good '' regional accents are preferred for cold calling and base level enquiries . 
  this it because it humanises the caller / speaker to the customers and put them more at ease , however rp like accents are preferred for elevated calls with pissed off customers because people ca n't help but associate these voices with the authority needed to get stuff done . 
  on the whole when irate they will behave more civilly with an rp speaker , in this case dehumanisation works in the speakers favour . 
  it 's funny because until you get to birmingham there 's always a decent percentage of rp speakers in any community , even in somewhere like banbury there will be a bunch of them . 
  however north of birmingham the percentage of rp speakers dwindles , meaning rp is perceived as comparatively posher and more affected . 
  essentially south of the border rp = merely not working class , however north of the border rp = trying to be upper class . 
   and now that the canadian dollar is n't doing so hot , more places in canada like our money as well . 
  it does n't work like ffs , you 're displaying exactly the type of ignorance that people on this thread at complaining about , you think there is something special about the us dollar above other first world currencies . 
  if places in canada take us dollars it 's because they 're used to catering to us tourists and know they 'll get more business that way . 
  having a `` weaker '' currency is n't a reason to prefer the us dollar . 
  all weaker means is that your currency trades at a lower rate per unit with other world currencies than it did before . 
  in this situation there is absolutely no advantage to taking a stronger currency as payment because the conversion means you still get exactly the same amount of money as you would with the canadian dollar . 
  the reason poor countries prefer us dollars much of the time because their currencies are unstable , their value is constantly and unpredictably fluctuating . 
  despite the canadian dollar being comparatively devalued for economic reasons , the canadian people still have utmost faith in their currency , there 's no fear that they 're going to wake up one day and their currency wo n't be worth the paper its printed on , and so there is no reason for them to prefer payment in us dollars . 
  depends if it 's an obvious affectation or not . 
  i have no problem with americans saying those words , but sometimes is so obvious they 're just shoehorning them in because they think that 's what british people want . 
  ** you guys ** ? 
  i think you mean ** you guys ** ( i.e. 
  americans ) , we were the ones that stayed at home if you remember correctly . 
  it 's not pronounced boro though ... and it 's nothing to do with the scottish accent . 
  there may be places in the us where the borough suffix is pronounced that way , but that 's not how the scottish one is pronounced anywhere in the world . 
  you 're saying it wrong out and out . 
  what you 're doing is like me doing to des moines and pronouncing it exactly how i would if it were a town in france . 
  no that is wrong . 
  the place is pronounced `` deh moin '' and that 's the only correct way to pronounce that city in the whole world . 
  the buruh pronunciation is not a consequence of the accent , it 's actually how said .
