  being eligible for citizenship is n't quite the same as you know , actively being part of the country and culture . 
  in what fucking world does people driving like dicks warrant waving a gun around ? 
  seriously , you 're just going to assume the guy who drives around with his pistol lying around the front seat is in the right ? 
  fucking some people . 
  yeah , she 's just pathetically not able to move on from him so decides she needs to do everything to make him suffer for not staying with her . 
  you can see both those women are used to being able to use their gender to avoid being challenged . 
  their logic is like , stand in front of a car , if he tries to drive it then he 's trying to run me over , stand in front of a door , if he tries to move past me he 's assaulting me . 
  they are the permanent victims no matter what dumb shit they try , and men are default in the wrong when they go against anything . 
  how dare you , as the father of these children , get them a hair cut . 
  it 's just fucking insane . 
  in theory , yes , but lack of forthcoming victim in a case like this would put the prosecution at a massive disadvantage , which might not make it worth their time . 
  judges still put a lot more faith in witness testimony than video evidence, 
  mustard, 
  i think you misspelt gem\u00fctlich, 
  the thing is , both the regional pronunciations , and the way english is spelt has drifted . 
  a town like worcester was once written how it 's spelt , however both how we pronounce that spelling and how we speak has changed since then . 
  all the words that end in gh for example , - gh used to have it 's own unique sound , at some point english lost that sound but the town names stayed the same . 
  i had a teacher who taught kant , except the way he said it sounded a lot ruder, 
  eye-yun is how people in the uk say it . 
  in south africa that would n't be a problem . 
  that 's a broad - a , not a soft - a i.e. 
  the kind some british people ( southerners ) use for lots of words but americans reserve for loan words like milan , taco , and pasta . 
  i 've always found americans doing this kind of weird . 
  most european languages only have one sound for - a ( and if they do n't they mark it with an accent of some kind ) , which means it does n't really matter if you say taco or tahco because what they say is kind of in the middle . 
  i 've even heard some americans say it 's uneducated to not say tahco , there was even a family guy sketch making fun of it , but honestly i reckon to spanish speaking people who do n't speak english they sound the same . 
  that said , the way americans say words like `` hat '' and `` cat '' is slightly more shifted towards - e than the way most british people say it these days , so that might make it sounder wronger from an american if they say `` taco '' rather than `` tahco '' . 
  that 's not really correct . 
  the italian pronunciation lies between the british pronunciation of `` a '' and `` ah '' so neither is correct and either is fine . 
  to be fair the british pronunciation is closer to the original french . 
  the american one is a latinisation . 
  british people do this exactly the same . 
  it was a change that was going on in shakespeare 's day and is actually noted in his plays . 
  there 's an old fashioned scholar type who goes around saying all the latinate words phonetically and complaining about the lazy speech of the youth . 
  one way americans and brits tend to differ though is words ending is - sion like version and immersion , americans are like ver - jun , with the - j pronounced as in french ( like the name jacque ) while brits are just like ver - shun, 
  your spelling is n't really helpful still . 
  industry is pronounced in-dus-tree , not in-dis-tree , however the sound for the dus is schwa . 
  the way you 've written it does n't tell us anything about what sound he actually uses . 
  is he using the - u from put , putt or putin ? 
  he was actually using the older pronunciation , which should be like hurri-cun . 
  the hurri-cain pronunciation is newer and only standard in america . 
  it should rhyme with hat . 
  new-clear is the correct pronunciation , george w says `` new-kyu-lur '', 
  sure they 're not saying jewelry ? 
  jewel-lur-ree , jew-lur-ree jewel-ree jewl-ree are all considered correct . 
  there 's a lot of silent - l 's in english . 
  for example , salve , salmon , folk , half , vulnerable . 
  solder is just one of those that people could n't make their mind up about . 
  do n't be that guy , especially if you do n't know about regionalisms . 
  i find it very rude when someone from a different country / region tries to correct my pronunciation when it 's considered correct in my dialect of english . 
  also the consh-tant-ly sounds like he had the same speech problem as sean connery . 
  heighth is actually an old alternative to height that used to be more prominent but has died out in almost all english dialects . 
  it 's pretty much impossible to say with two . 
  that would be in-tree or dus-tree or whatever . 
  i think what he 's doing is stressing the second syllable rather than the first , making it sound like `` in ** dust ** tree '' rather than '' ** in ** dustree '', 
  try calling in about your i r a in the uk and they 'll be sending the police round . 
  usually but not always , and not in this case , it 's always rhymed with hat . 
  i 'm not saying you 're that guy i 'm just saying do n't be that guy . 
  the one who corrects someone for speaking in a way that 's perfectly normal in their part of the world . 
  if you 're not doing that then that 's fine . 
  however really doubt you could locate anyone in the uk within a county , it 's virtually impossible , one because there are plenty of accents that even most british people have never been exposed to , and also because accent in the uk is n't just regional , but also age , race and social class related . 
  most people in the uk could locate people from around their area , assuming the person they hear even has a regional accent . 
  there are plenty of people in the uk who speak with a generic middle class bbc accent but come from places where other people have what would be thought of as a regional accent . 
  there are also places where the bbc style accent is the regional accent , and telling them apart is nigh on impossible . 
  also there are accents that are virtually extinct too . 
  still , people in newcastle might be able to tell the difference between a durham , a sunderland and a geordie accent , but most people even 50 miles down the road would n't have a clue . 
  same goes for birmingham , wolverhampton and coventry , to the people who live there it 's as clear as day but to everyone else they 're all just generically west midlands , or northumbrian , or london , or west country . 
  only the people who 've lived in these regions for large portions of their lives have the kind of finely tuned ear that can tell them apart . 
  there are 86 counties in the uk , i mean would you really be able to know what a rutland accent sounds like ? 
  or differentiate a bedfordshire accent from a hertfordshire accent ? 
  a cumbrian accent from a lancashire one ? 
  do n't be crazy . 
  it 's good that you 're interested in accents though , but even the natives can mostly only recognise the main accent groups : cockney , middle class southern , really posh , west country , west midlands , east midlands , east anglia , mancunian , scouse , yorkshire , geordie ( northumbria ) . 
  when german words end in a - d it essentially becomes a - t , that 's actually something that i have to make myself do as a native english speaker when speaking german . 
  vegetable = veg - tu - buls . 
  but all germans i know say veg - et - tab - uls . 
  i do n't think an american dictionary really has any authority on a word of chiefly british usage . 
  also there is poem of it 's first usage in 1660 where it rhymes with hat . 
  `` they 'd talk ' t of his having a cardinalls hat , / they 'd send him as soon an old nuns twat '', 
  a county away is still a pretty big ask imo . 
  but i guess it would depend which county , good luck getting people within the home counties or around the east midlands . 
  sometimes a county means an entirely different dialect and sometimes it means an ever so slight change in one or two vowels so subtle you 'd need practice for hours just to catch it . 
  what makes it hard is that you ca n't really make a reference frame from one just hearing one person , because that person might be anomalous , they might have influence from other areas or from their parents who were from somewhere else . 
  you have to hear 1000 people from birmingham speak and then 1000 people from wolverhampton speak until your brain can entirely grasp what the difference between the accents in a concrete way . 
  accent tags are great and all but the people living in these places are much more tuned into the subtle differences . 
  i 've seen a lot of accent tags too , they 're very interesting . 
  age and class make a big difference too . 
  for example an older speaker from liverpool will rhyme fur and square by making them both sound like fur , however a younger speaker will make them rhyme by making them both sound similar to square ( but monophthongised ) . 
  an older brummie will roll their - r ( alveolar trill ) while a young brummie will use an alveolar approximant or even a labio-dental approximant in some cases . 
  it 's a well documented fact that regional dialects are being eroded and more and more people are speaking with a `` prestige dialect '' in both us and the uk . 
  in the us this can be seen by how many people in east coast areas who traditionally would 've spoken non-rhotically , ( without pronouncing - r 's that are n't follow by a vowel as in `` car '' and `` parking '' ) are now pronouncing the - r because that 's part of prestige genam dialect . 
  in the uk , more and more people from regions that traditionally had accents are speaking with what could be called modern rp , which is a bbc accent but without older elements , and elements associated with being upper class removed . 
  a good example of this might be someone like martin freeman , who speaks in this very politically and geographically neutral manner . 
  however , there are also interesting things happening , for example , estuarisation , which is the growing influence of london accents . 
  the traditional kent accent is virtually dead , so you 'd have a hard time placing someone in kent for sure , due to its proximity to london most people have adopted london-esque accents . 
  in fact all the traditional accents from the counties around london are gone , and are either replaced with modern rp or estuary english . 
  another thing that 's happening is the rise of new accents , such as multi-cultural london english , which is quickly replacing traditional cockney amongst many young people in the london urban area . 
  other cities are also doing this , with cities such as birmingham and manchester developing their own multi-cultural dialects . 
  just from hearing someone 's voice you can tell so much about them , whether they consider themselves working class or middle class , or if they 're upper class , you can tell how old they are , and you can tell if they perceive themselves as part of `` urban culture '' or not , and that 's not evening looking at the geography of it all .

  we die inside every time we hear people speaking that broken colonial creole you try to call english to be fair .
