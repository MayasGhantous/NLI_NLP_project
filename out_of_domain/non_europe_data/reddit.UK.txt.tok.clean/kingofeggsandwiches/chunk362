  funny how it 's only on sites populated by yanks where people pull this shit , maybe it 's because other countries are n't so culturally insular that they think an accent not native to their country are worthy of such attention . 
  it certainly would be nice to have one fucking / r/videos thread featuring a non-american without some idiot writing `` fooking '' , `` facking '' , `` u wot m8 '' or some other bollocks . 
  if you have n't realised i was n't being entirely serious . 
  but if you want to get into it , my point was nothing to do with where it originated , my point was that the ** english ** language will forever belong to ** england ** no matter where is is spoken , not because it originated there but because the word ** english ** is literally synonymous with `` the language of the english people '' . 
  thus , if everyone in england decides to start speaking a language based on klingon then english will now be mutually intelligible with klingon but not with the languages spoken in america , australia and ireland . 
   he reason why you are seeing those comments of people mocking british accents is because reddit is a website created by americans used by mostly americans . 
  if you brits decide to make a british alternative for reddit then by all means , mock our accents all you want . 
  guess what , we do have british websites populated by majority brits , but guess what , we rarely , if ever , mock american/australian / irish accents when we see videos containing them because , and here 's the kicker , ** we are not fucking culturally insular dickwads . 
  ** would n't it be nice if americans stopped being culturally insular dickwads and trying to respell the way other english speakers pronounce words . 
  maybe a few people in other countries do this , but generally they are considered to be ignorant cunts , they are considered this for exactly the reasons you are citing , who has the right to claim their way of speaking is `` proper '' , to claim such a thing is inherently xenophobic , an attempt to assert your culture as dominant . 
  however , on reddit they get gold and upvotes from all the american idiots who arrogantly assume their way of talking reflects the way the language is written , the only conclusion we can make is that america is full of ignorant cunts who assume they are the centre of the universe and that only their way of pronouncing things is correct , which is only made ironic by the fact that the language does n't even come from america in the first place . 
  seriously , every fucking thread on / r/videos i see with a brit , an aussie , an irishman or whatever it 's the same shit . 
  offensive fucking linguistic arrogance from a country that does n't even have a majority british heritage , did n't originate the language , and does n't seem to grasp the concept of irony . 
  what you do n't seem to grasp is that while you think it 's haha very funny , let 's respell the way she speaks to how it sounds to my ear on the basis of how people around me speak , doing so is offensive at the deepest fucking level going . 
  it 's an assertion of supreme cultural arrogance , if it were brits doing it to irish people in the 19th century it would take on a much nastier tone would n't it ? 
  just fucking stop it , it makes you look like a nation of ignorant arrogant cunts . 
  i imagine any guys do n't seek custody because they do n't feel comfortable taking a legal position of responsibility for the child . 
  perhaps , they just assume that the mother will allow them to be involved in the child 's life in some form or the other because of some verbal agreement they made . 
  imagine you got a woman you 'd only known a matter of weeks pregnant by accident and she said she is keeping the child . 
  the mother says you can be involved in the child 's life to some degree ( birthdays , christmas , monthly visits ) but she is n't remotely interested in a relationship with you or having you around much of the time . 
  since you never intended to have a child , and do n't have a close relationship with the mother , would you feel comfortable pushing for joint custody and legal visitation rights ? 
  the mother might be so against that idea that she says she 'll fight you over it if you attempt it , you do n't want a lengthy court battle and arguments with the mother , so naturally to keep the relationship between you and mother civil you agree not to . 
  the problem is in a situation like this that the mother can just disappear with the child and you 'd be left with little recourse . 
  the mother might have met a new partner and have decided she wants the child to grow up identifying with him as the father and you 're just an unnecessary complication who will confuse the child , or she might simply see you as a mistake she made and feel that making a clean break if the only way for her to move on with her life . 
  of course , you might be an alcoholic , a drug addict , or abusive in which case the mother could be quite justified in feeling this way , on the other hand you might just be a regular bloke who was thrown into fatherhood while all too unprepared . 
  the problem is that fathers have virtually no rights as fathers that are just given on the basis of fatherhood . 
  a father has to go to court to secure those rights , which works better when the child is the product of a marriage or long term relationship , but does n't work very well otherwise . 
  i think father 's should have some baseline of rights simply on the basis of being the father , at least something as basic as being able to go to the government and be told where the child lives and some contact information for the mother . 
  if the mother wants to deny a father the ability to do this the onus should be on her to show he 's an unfit parent . 
  without that this , a man in this situation would n't even be able to go to court to secure visitation rights because they would n't even be able to issue the mother a summons . 
  it 's kinda assumed by the law that a father that does n't push for some legally secured involvement in a child 's life must not want any involvement whatsoever , which does n't really reflect the reality of things . 
   or because you elected not to exercise your rights , in which case your having access to the kid probably was n't in their best interest anyway . 
  this is the big hole in your argument if you ask me . 
  it does n't follow that just because someone did n't exercise their rights that it 's not the child 's interest to have some kind of relationship with them . 
  if i had a child with a woman i barely knew by accident and she decided she was keeping it , given my current age and financial situation i would n't feel comfortable taking a custodial role over the child , i might not bother to secure visitation rights legally because of a verbal agreement with the mother . 
  that does n't mean it 's fair that mother can then break our verbal agreement and break off all contact with me and that i should have no recourse if the mother and child just disappear out of my life , i 'd at least want the basic things like knowing the child was ok , having an address to send gifts for birthdays and christmas , having the option to help out financially in any way that i could . 
  surely as the genetic father of the child you should have some basic right to know if you child is still alive and well ? 
  mate , you do n't even know how lucky you yanks get it when it comes to freedom . 
  i had officers from the bureau for retail licencing track me down to my mother 's house last week !, 
  they 'd tried me at home and i was n't in , so they 'd tracked me using my oyster card , followed me on cctv and then cross referenced the local registered addresses , seen a matching surname and decided to try knocking on to see if i was about . 
  you can imagine my face when i opened the door . 
  why ? 
  my retail licence had expired whilst i was on holiday and i had n't been in to renew it since i got back . 
  luckily i was able to smooth it all out once i showed them the receipts for my flights . 
  good thing too , the penalties for being unregistered are not to be trifled with , such is the price of security in this modern age i guess . 
  but how would the perpetrators of civil crimes like littering and the illegal sale of licensed products like branded carrier bags be held accountable ? 
  seriously i have no idea how society functions in the us , seems like anarchy . 
  swim knew a guy who could actually get his hands on imported aldi bags from germany , un-fucking-believable , you could get at least 12 uses out of them , you just had to be careful nobody saw the foreign registration code . 
   you do n't just get to help out in whatever manner you `` feel comfortable . '', 
  actually many people do do this , it just requires that the parents cooperate like adults and respect each others wishes . 
  you say this like it 's a bad thing that a biological parent wants to help out in some way , even if that help is just sending the occasional check or birthday / christmas card . 
   if mom does n't agree to share the kid with you , you can sue to establish paternity yourself , but you 're going to be accountable the same as above . 
  which you ca n't do if you do n't know where the mother has taken the child , which is why i think the biological parent should at least have the right to 1 . 
  know the child is alive and has n't been taken into care 2 . 
  have some way of contacting the mother , even if it 's an intermediary like a government agency . 
  it 's not exactly asking a lot is it . 
   either you 're a parent or you 're not . 
  not true , you can have legally secured visitation rights without taking on custodial responsibility , payment of child support depends on whether the other parent asks for that or not . 
  i know that because when my parents divorced my dad got partial custody of us but never paid my mother any money despite the fact she had us most the time because my mother decided it was n't worth it . 
  ( he was retired , she was the primary earner ), 
  ultimately , i 'm not saying that being a biological parent should give you automatic rights to see your child , i 'm just saying that a biological parent should never be put in a position where they are completely unaware of the child 's welfare and have no way to contact them , simply because they did n't press for that legal right earlier in the child 's life . 
  the system whereby you sue for visitation rights or partial custody can not function if the biological parent does n't have any way to contact the custodial parent . 
  it 's an issue similar to gun control i guess , americans do n't realise how dangerous the free bag market is . 
  i understand that , i do n't believe child support guidelines are mandatory in the uk , the parent with primary care is financially well off and does n't feel like pursing child support then they can opt not to . 
  the parent who sees the kid on weekends is expected to support the kid financially while he or she in their custody , but it 's not mandatory that they pay the other parent if both parents are fine with that not happening . 
  sometimes parents do this simply to ease the speed of the process . 
  i 'll add that i was n't talking about what the law is , i simply saying from a moral standpoint , it sucks that a biological parent who has not been shown to be unfit can ever be on a position where the do n't know the welfare of the child and do n't have a means to contact them whatsoever , even if that contact is through an intermediary and only for the purpose of filing a paternity/maternity suit . 
  imagine you father a child with a woman you do n't have a close relationship , you agree to stay in touch but then 2 weeks after the child is born the mother disappears with the child , you ca n't even establish paternity because you do n't know where she or the child is . 
  i do n't think anyone should be in a position where they do n't know where their kid is simply because they failed to promptly exercise their legal rights . 
  it simply does n't follow that because someone failed to exercise their legal rights that it 's not in the child 's best interest to have contact with them . 
  seems kind of sad that people 's only recourse is to hire pis to find their kids though right ? 
  and expensive . 
  going back to the video , obviously we do n't know the backstory here . 
  as you said , he might have had his kid kidnapped , in which case it 's a matter for the police , or he might his rights to visitation / partial custody denied to him for some reason , in which case he certainly should n't be looking for him . 
  however , if he simply did n't exercise his legal rights then i hope he finds out where they are and is able to make an arrangement with the mother or at least take her to court . 
   grammar and phrasing, 
   living dependant, 
  maybe it 's you who we should be kicking out . 
  edit : if you speak american it 's always dependent , if you 're using british english it 's dependant for the noun and dependent for everything else . 
  lol brilliant . 
  huh ? 
  why would i lie ? 
  i thought it was common knowledge that the eu had issued retail licences for all uk citizens to crack on illegal immigration and black market transactions , i think they introduced it around 2007 . 
  every time you make a cash payment you swipe the card , it 's just like chip and pin except it does n't have any money on it . 
  it just records what you purchased , how much it cost and the time of purchase in a encrypted government database somewhere . 
  thing is you 've got to renew it every few years and if you do n't have a valid one you 're liable to detained under the suspicion that you 're an illegal , obviously i 'm not an illegal , but not having a valid one carries a hefty fine since it wastes government resources detaining you to establish your right to reside in the uk . 
  i kinda assumed every country had something like that . 
  i think when i used my oyster card on the london public transport system it flagged me as having an expired card that had n't been renewed and that 's how they got me . 
  lucky i had documents proving i 'd been out the country at the time on my phone otherwise i would 've spent hours in customs and immigration trying to get the whole mess straightened out . 
  well in germany the germans try to say the english bit sounding like an english speaker , they do n't say bahk-kawn doob-luh chay-zuh baw-gah , they say it with the english pronunciation , so i just say it english style . 
  the only problem is a say the english pronunciation a little too english sounding , so i worry that they just think i 'm a really pretentious german showing off their english pronunciation , or if i 'm giving away that fact that i 'm not a real german . 
  the opera does n't end until the 1st soprano , typically a fat diva , sings her main aria , thus `` it 's not over until the fat lady sings '' . 
  shut it you dirty tree hooker !, 
  a ) hello, 
  b ) ( grunt of acknowledgement ),
