  those are n't electronics , that 's software , us seems to be dominant in software . 
  but the electronics here ( tvs , radios , pcs , smart phones ) are almost all asian . 
  most american accents use a different sound for the letter n than most british accent , letting it resonate in the nasal passage more obviously . 
  pretty good generally , i 've noticed more hostility from the dutch about the english , but maybe that 's because all the scum of our nation makes a yearly pilgrimage to amsterdam because it 's the only place they can go and be certain there 'll be more drugs than back home . 
  quality over quantity . 
  seriously ? 
  are you a fucking nazi ? 
  if britain had n't stood up to hitler he would have taken over a piece of europe from aachen to the russian border , there would have been genocide of slavic peoples that would make the holocaust look like a minor incident . 
  once he had unopposed control of europe then smaller countries like the scandinavian nations , holland , belgium would have been little more than german puppet regimes . 
  then we 'd have had a militaristic fascist regime covering the whole of a central europe , a regime that hated homosexuals , religious minorities , ethnic minorities to such an extent it would 've killed them off or at least sterilised them . 
  a regime without democracy or personal liberty . 
  britain was the only country with bravery to actually dare oppose this tyranny . 
  hitler was insane and evil , churchill was wise and making a just sacrifice of his countrymen 's blood in order to stop an absolute fucking monster destroying the future of europe . 
  yeah , we could have taken the easy route , allied with hitler or remained neutral , we could have kept our empire and stolen colonial wealth , the threat to britain was far less than that to central europe , but instead we fought against tyranny . 
  the fact that hitler had no intention of conquering britain makes the decision to go to war only more noble , the fact that you suggest that it wrong of britain to get involved despite no direct threat shows you 're nothing more than a nazi sympathising scumbag . 
  40 quid a gram , 35 for the really shit stuff , and less if you bought in bulk , 120 for 3.5 grams . 
  it was n't something you could do every day but plenty kids got their hands on it when i was in sixth form college . 
  other drugs that were available , 10-15 quid gram of speed , 10 quid gram of mcat , 10 quid for 1.7 grams of weed , ketamine 15-25 a gram , mushrooms from a head shop for a tenner a box before they were banned in 2006 . 
  what does a danish face look like ? 
  moreover , how do you tell a danish face from an english face ? 
  i 'm pretty sure the whole east coast of england was settled by danes . 
  anyhow , little finger just mixes irish and english pronunciations he ends up sounding like he 's from nowhere . 
  who is denzel ? 
  who was he in game of thrones ? 
  ah ok . never seen it , looks interesting . 
  fine , it only applies when ** approaching ** a junction not ** immediately reaching ** a junction . 
  in this video nobody is a approaching a junction , a junction is not a left turn , a junction is a junction , where a road meets a road . 
  either show some evidence for your claim or accept that you are talking crap . 
  it 's not the duty of drivers to check for cyclists trying to overtake them on the left when making a left turn . 
  if you 're a cyclist and try to overtake someone while they 're making a left turn then you are at fault . 
  the woman here has n't broken 167 because there is no junction involved . 
  i 'd also say that neither has 187 been broken , because she did n't overtake ** just ** before she turned left , but significantly after it , and for all we know she used her mirrors and she definitely indicated . 
  cyclists do not have priority to overtake on the left over left turning cars , just the same as cars do not have priority to overtake on the right passing right turning cars , to suggest otherwise is absurd . 
  well yeah , i think the idea was that they did n't fit in with the nerds or the cool kids , they wanted to be cool and popular but they did n't know how . 
  still i think my point stand , the inbetweeners did n't really have any grittiness to it . 
  while in my experience many kids my age where doing the drugs and having sex like in skins , but somehow it all managed to be as socially awkward and embarrassing as the inbetweeners a lot of the time . 
  100 for an 8 ball seems really cheap to me !, 
  i do n't know if that would be considered significant enough to fail someone , personally i think she left enough room . 
  also i do n't know if entrance to a supermarket counts as a junction , to me i would n't call that a junction , lowered pavement or no , but there does n't seem to be a definition out there that i can find . 
  just wanted to make clear that cyclists do n't have a special overtaking rights that take priority over cars ability to turn left , if a turn in was blocked and someone was waiting for it to clear with their indicators on , and the cyclist comes up behind then the cyclist is expected to stop and wait , just as a car coming up behind someone waiting to make a right turn with their indicators on is n't allowed to overtake on the right . 
  i do n't see the stop being so dangerous before her left turn , also stopping is always the person behind you 's problem , certainly when there 's an accident that 's who will be at fault . 
  i 'd like to know what authority you have it on that a dropped curb constitutes a junction other than your own interpretation . 
  i 'll give you that she did n't leave enough space to overtake a car when passing , but really very few drivers actually do . 
   we take people 's things , and make them ~ ~ better . ~ ~ unhealthier . 
  sorry i think i misheard . 
  it 's not so much the language but the culture . 
  you can be fluent in the language but no the culture if you get my gist . 
  i 'll sure you 'll make plenty of british friends , but it 's amazingly common for even the most fluent foreigners to band with other foreigners for some reason . 
   the junction in question also has full t-junction markings on the joining road . 
  on what authority do you have it that this would be considered anything other than a junction in the eyes of the law ? 
  ( in case you 're going to suggest that it 's private land and therefore different : until the car has fully cleared the main road and the alignment of the pavement , public land is still involved . ), 
  well i 'm saying that i do n't know , but i do n't see why your definition is any more value . 
  the supermarket might have painted those lines themselves . 
   in any case , if she 'd stopped blocking the junction , the cyclist would no longer be behind her . 
  why would n't he ? 
  unless he overtook her , which is what i 'm saying would be illegal ( if we imagine that the overtaking had not occurred ), 
  i 'm all for ice tea , drink it fairly often when the mood strikes . 
  sweet tea on the other hand is an unholy abomination . 
  and we can finally enjoy our tea in peace without a bunch of god bothering frontier sorts getting all shouty . 
  also you can thank the british engineers for their assisting you build those nuclear powered cars and , satellites , probes and whatever else . 
  you mean the russians do right ? 
  since the american ones blew up too much . 
  no you are , and what 's more you 're a nazi sympathiser . 
  someone made a homophobic joke and that was the end of it . 
  actually there is a good documentary - [ barely dead ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=darri_poodc ) about the rise and fall of rollerblading , how it got kicked out the x-games , these kind of things . 
  these days the us pays the russians to use their rockets , oh how the mighty have fallen . 
  i love england in the summer when this happens , we get a bit of warmth and sun and people lose their minds , the whole summer wardrobe comes out , sun glasses , shorts , people stripping off to their waist , girls showing their cleavage with the shortest skirts imaginable or those shorts that do n't even cover the legs . 
  then 2 hours later it 's raining again and people are running for cover , pulling out raincoats and umbrellas , it 's like part of the culture . 
  thing , a lot of foreign students still do it at good universities in the west . 
  a lot of wealthy chinese students at world renowned universities are simply paying broke post grads to write them something original that wo n't show up when run through a plagiarism checker, 
  that 's why they pay out of work post grads to do it . 
  lol , fuck off , manchester is n't even the best place for a curry in the uk . 
  american steroid pumped chicken with american chemical pumped gm vegetables with american chemically recycled water ? 
  sounds awful . 
  top quality ingredients are actually hard to find in the us due to lax laws around farming . 
  everyone knows the 70s was a culinary disaster era anyway , not just for the uk but at least in us you had fast food that tasted good . 
  70s food in much of europe was just awful , as people were just started to experiment with foreign dishes but horribly mangled and altered to their national tastes . 
  this was the era when prawn cocktail ( defrosted prawns , ketchup and mayo sauce ) was considered the height of sophistication . 
  fondue was a way of showing off to your neighbours because it showed you could afford to buy the equipment just to eat fondue . 
  swedish food was in with smorgasbords being considered a mark of cultural open mindedness . 
  when you 're at home there are essentially no rules governing the consumption of alcohol . 
  it 's so a parent can let a kid take a sip of wine without breaking the law . 
  the 5 rule is there because giving kids alcohol under 5 is considered flat out child abuse . 
  we do have saunas that are n't for getting cock , they 're in gyms / sports clubs / swimming baths all over the country . 
  we have loads of saunas in gyms and sports clubs and stuff . 
  we just do n't have dedicated saunas where you go just for the sauna , anywhere labelled sauna will be a gay brothel of sorts / place for men to hook up with men . 
  it harks from the days before gay clubs so they had find some premise to meet . 
  not even a good film . 
  i 'm sorry , you seem to really care about this . 
  when the thing is , we do n't care . 
  we do n't care about wasting money on space programmes to show off to the rest of the world ( we could have easily contributed financially to your space programmes in order to send more astronauts as other countries did but it was never important to us , in fact the first space programme the uk ever contributed to was the esa ) . 
  we already did out bit when we conquered 1/4 of the world 's surface creating the biggest empire in human history , caused the industrial revolution and modern age with our science and inventions , colonised the world with our peoples so that english is the undisputed international lingua franca , and discovered and charted half the landmasses previously unknown to western civilisation . 
  when you 're by far the most historically influential cultural force the world has ever seen , you care very little for astronauts . 
  we , unlike the us which has barely had a century in the sun , have nothing to prove , to ourselves or to the rest of the world . 
  in the distance future , when historians discuss the 2nd millennia ad of human history , britain will just as crucial to the debate as the roman empire is the previous ones . 
  not in english it ai n't . 
  we have kebabs too . 
  i 'm not american but i was n't raised to do this in the uk . 
  frankly , asking a grown man to take off his shoes as if you doubted his level of hygiene seems barbarous to me . 
  i 'm sure a resourceful , good look gay man can find cock almost anywhere .
