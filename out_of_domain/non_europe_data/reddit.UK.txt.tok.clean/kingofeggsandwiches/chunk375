   and the english are n't known for being honest about their issues, 
  wtf ? 
  if anything we exaggerate our problems to make it seem like the world is ending . 
  seriously ... 
  [ in netherlands and northern germany they certainly exist ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwdhlffwpok ), 
  username checks out . 
  it 's nothing to do with feeling shit in your heart . 
  art is subjective , judging art based solely of the accuracy of the representation is ridiculous . 
  you do n't have to like this performance , but when you start saying it 's objectively bad , and claiming to be in a better position of judgement because your `` training '' , you are automatically a cunt . 
  the person responding did n't even realise this was performed by a successful professional pianist , and assumed it was an amateur , which shows how much he actually knows . 
  what about all the americans that simply come to europe on tourist visa and start trying to live without any paperwork whatsoever . 
  i met a group of american over stayers who 'd been in germany for over a year working online and living in hostels and stuff . 
  they 'd been working on a plan to try and get a flat in dresden but were struggling to find anyone who would rent to them without passports . 
  there have been plenty of rewrites of shakespeare and some have been well received . 
  reinterpretations , translations , edits . 
  if the performers goal is to precisely recreate something and they fail , then it 's a fuck up , if they take creative licence to play it how they want to , then it 's not a failure . 
  holding something sacred simply because it 's old is tedious . 
  the assumption people are making here is that she did n't intend to play it that way , which she probably did . 
  you might not like it , everyone has their tastes , but the person to whom i responded seemed to shoving his or her arrogant objectivised opinion down our throats , and that 's the behaviour of an elitist arsewipe imho . 
  still , what i found funny about these americans is that they were so naive and oblivious to the fact that they were essentially illegal immigrants . 
  they were basically just hipsters who turned up , never registered for anything and decided to stick around . 
  all white english speakers do this in my experience . 
  there is a market , yes , it 's smaller than the market for english naturally , but also there are fewer people doing it . 
  imagine if it turned out he 's from china ... awkward . 
  blame your commie gambling laws . 
  i 'll be over here in the land of the free ( healthcare ) with my unrestricted gambling and tax free winnings . 
  lol , he 's in the uk running a legal raffle under uk law , the only people who could remotely be considered to be breaking the law are the americans who enter it . 
  do you even understand that the uk is n't in the us ? 
  lol it 's already been explained elsewhere in the thread , if a us person enters this and wins it could be considered tax evasion . 
  in the uk you do n't need a licence to run a raffle although it 's illegal to run a raffle and not give away the prize . 
  also this clearly is n't a scam . 
  amy schumer already seems off brand to me . 
  ecumenical, 
  do n't cut yourself on that edge ... 
  you 've got to be a troll . 
  all the good english speaking countries . 
  it 's a thing in most of europe , scandinavians are the most keen to traumatise their kids though . 
  what 's about some of the world 's most hi-tech trains taking you where you want to be at 300km/h with wifi and a bar ? 
  this is just crazy , growing up in europe a while ago i 'd just wonder off from my parents in the supermarket and nobody would get stressed whatsoever , innocent times . 
  it happened so often i even learnt how to go to the customer service desk and make an announcement so they could come get me . 
  ok so personally i find the most obscene stuff the little stuff . 
  sure private jets , rare sports cars , penthouse flats in the middle of capital cities are impressive but ultimately you 're getting what you pay for , all those things are expensive because they 're really worth the money . 
  however , the obscenest spending i saw was from a bunch of rich kids at my university , mostly russians , who were ordering table service in a fancy nightclub , kind of place where a beer costs # 8 . 
  anyway , they were ordering grey goose vodka , champagne , and later caviar to the table and generally just acting like tits , getting girls over to the table trying to show off . 
  anyway , my girlfriend at the time knew some of them and we went over for a bit and had some champagne with them , apparently they were paying # 800 a bottle and the bill for the table at the end of the night came to # 15,000 . 
  i also saw an arab guy throw # 400 at a tuk tuk driver in central london before . 
  those things are generally a rip off but not that ridiculous . 
  also i was once staying at the ritz-carlton in berlin while there was this huge hasidic jewish wedding . 
  it was going on while the berlin film festival was going on and george clooney was staying there . 
  they 'd still managed to take over half the hotel . 
  they had television cameras and gift bags with expensive watches and jewellery inside . 
  i 've always been around wealthy people in my life because of my school , but sometimes you get exposed to a different level of wealth which can only be described as rich as fuck . 
  to be fair a lot of dubai natives spend their summers in the uk , london to be specific . 
  knightsbridge and mayfair in the summer [ look like this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7eo4vf0ozy ), 
  yes , it 's one of those phrases that sticks in people 's heads from school, 
  concorde almost did n't happen because the us government and us aviation industry hated it so much . 
  they imposed ridiculous requirements on it in order for it to fly , such as turning the engines off while flying over new york and making it get miles and miles from the us before it could go supersonic since only us planes were permitted to travel faster than sound in us airspace , not to mention a ridiculous number of costly safety procedures that a normal plane would never be subject to . 
  even after it was built it was hindered at every opportunity by us interests who knew that it was only economically viable if it flew new york to london/paris , since during that era nowhere else had the economy to pay for it . 
  it was also expected to expand into routes like ny  la , but was never able to because of these restrictions , it was intended to be sold to airliners around the world , but because of the legislation nobody was interested except air france and ba which were nationalised . 
  why did they hate it ? 
  it was an entirely anglo-french creation that the us airlines had no stake in and could n't influence , it also made the us look bad for not having a home grown supersonic passenger craft project . 
  after concorde was produced it was wrought with so many bureaucratic issues which incurred additional costs that nobody was remotely interested in producing any more . 
  concorde barely made a profit in the end anyway , even with the crazy costs to passengers , and was kept alive purely because of what a good advertisement it was for the airlines who ran it , and because it represented a politically significant joint endeavour between the british and french government during the post war era . 
  had the project not been beset on all sides by opposition from the industry and the us government supersonic flight may have well been considered more viable . 
  were the us aviation industry less incestuous it could have led to the us industry building their own super sonic passenger plane , with newer more modern supersonic aircraft being developed after it in the 80s and 90s setting a new industry standard . 
  hell , we could be taking supersonic flight for granted by now had things been different , especially given how the global markets have opened up in the past 25 years . 
  i hope to fuck you mean doilies , otherwise that would be creepy . 
  to be fair those guys do n't sound scottish to me, 
  so much murica in this video . 
   seems like he ** world ** has been struggling to come to an agreement, 
  cue : us flag , us capitol building , and map of the us divided by us politics, 
   anyone thinking domestic ? 
  some people actually put their hands up . 
   never been outside the country ? 
   you gota get out of the country at least ** once ** in your life, 
   what if you do n't have a passport ? 
  all fly off to a country virtually on the same continent . 
  ( although i guess this airline is barely `` international '' ), 
   a beautiful day for america, 
  yeah sounded like that to me too . 
  interestingly `` cock '' , well , the local translation , can mean penis in virtually every european language . 
  i 'm pretty sure the point was that zebra domestication while technically possible just was n't practical for early civilisations in africa . 
  there was obviously something about the horse that made it more suitable which is why it got domesticated instead . 
  we know the horse was n't as shitty as the zebra because there are still wild horses around and we know a lot about wild horses , and one of things we know is that they are pack-like . 
  we can compare this with wild zebra around today and know they are more of a herd and no hierarchical . 
  given that only 11 million americans take leisure holidays abroad by aeroplane , and less than 30 % expressed in interest of ever going abroad when polled , it 's not surprising really . 
  the old myth that there 's no need to leave the us because it 's already got everything here is still going strong . 
  i 've met a lot of swedes who were fluent in english and many were the most pseudo british sounding bastards . 
  short a and \u00e4 are both super open in swedish , and i always hear swedes saying / \u0259\u028a /, 
  i was making more than that working 2 hours a week . 
  i do n't know what she is calling `` work '' but it 's not work . 
  you can make more than that mowing lawns or babysitting for christsakes , there are 13 year old 's who ca n't even legally work making more than that . 
  14 hours for $ 100 is straight up third world still . 
  it 's fine . 
  i worked in a supermarket for quite a few months at uni . 
  i actually quite enjoyed the work itself , i was good at dealing with the customers and their problems and i did n't mind the shelf stacking particularly . 
  however , some of my colleagues were fucking arseholes . 
  that said , most of them were fine . 
  there was the seemingly nice old granny who was definitely a bit racist when you got to know her . 
  the sour faced section manager who was incredibly patronising , bossy , and smug about everything who you just had to humour .
