  screw the lot of them . 
  why ca n't we be like the mainlanders and treat bikes for what they are rather than some alternative lifestyle car replacement . 
  you 're an idiot , that 's not what i said at all . 
  i have a bike , i have n't had a car in a couple of years , i used to live in the uk but now i live on the mainland and the cyclists here are way better . 
  why ? 
  because most see cycling as an alternative to walking rather than alternative to a car ( the tram or the train is an alternative to a car ) . 
  there 's laxer laws about cycling on pavements , riding abreast is illegal , the common cycle paths must be used if they 're available by law . 
  everyone from kids to the elderly rides bikes , so people tend to be slower . 
  meanwhile in the uk only fucking cycling nuts go out on the roads ( because everyone knows how dangerous it is ) and with it comes the delusional belief that they 're a car simply because their 50 gear road bike and iron thighs lets them do 30mph . 
  if you think laws = facts , you 're naiver than most , my whole point was that it does n't matter what the law says you 're allowed to do when a bad driver speeds around a blind corner at 80 mph in a 60 mph limited major a-road and takes out you and your friend riding two abreast at 30 mph . 
  your olympic speed wo n't save you and you wo n't get a second chance , you 'll be joining one of the 3000 + cyclists severe injured on the road every year in england alone , and you 'll be lucky if you ever ride a bike again . 
   you have to share the things we all build together . 
  also , this is cute , the roads were not built with cyclists in mind . 
  if i 'm driving a car then i do n't share it with pedestrians , shall we let jogger take the centre lane of major roads now since we have to share ? 
  furthermore , since when have cyclists contributed to the building of roads ? 
  when cyclists start paying road tax let me know . 
  i have nothing against cycling , i cycle myself , i 've just seen how fucking dangerous and entitled to the road these hardcore cyclists are , who seem they 'd rather die than concede that they do n't have the same protection or capacity as a motorised vehicle , spurred on by the uk 's antiquated cycling laws that were written when there was 1/4 the number of cars on the road as today . 
  no you do n't , there 's zero common sense in the cycling community in the uk , otherwise the spandex warriors would n't be defending archiac practices like riding two abreast which are illegal in virtually every country ( even massively pro cycling countries like the netherlands and germany ) . 
  when you 're the next casualty under a lorry with squashed internal organs do n't expect any sympathy from me , it 'll be your own fault for using your own fatal vulnerability as leverage to get more respect on the road and as a tool to enforce the highway code . 
  good luck not becoming one of the 3000 + cyclists severely injured on the roads every year , if you 're wondering what that looks like [ watch this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj13jfkwfoo ) . 
  i hope for your family 's sake you 've got a good life insurance policy . 
  look , you are not a scientists of the road simply because you have cycling experience , i am not making outrageous claims that contravene some objective facts like a creationist . 
  i 'm giving you a reasoned argument , you can disagree but i 'm permitted to argue my point . 
  honestly , i do n't want you to go under a bus , i do n't wish that on anyone , but frankly i think people who road cycle like those in the uk are taking their life in their hands . 
  also , just because something gets lots of google hits ( from cycling websites ... ) does n't mean it 's true . 
  cycling for 30 years does n't make you good at cycling , just as driving for 30 years does n't make a good driver . 
  plenty of misinformation and unfounded beliefs prevail in the motorist community despite decades of experience , is it so hard to believe that that might be true in the cyclist community . 
  i do n't have a car , but i do have a bike . 
  i used to live in the uk but now i live on the mainland . 
  you could n't pay me enough to use cycling as a mode of transport in the uk , because i 've seen how absurdly dangerous it is , and i 've seen how bikes and cars interact . 
  here i use my bike like most people , for going to see friends or get some shopping on a mixture of road , pavement ( legal here unless expressly forbidden by signage ) , and lane cycling . 
  i do n't go fast so i do n't try to compete with cars for the road . 
  if i want an alternative to a car to go long distances i use public transport . 
  riding two abreast is a punishable offence here , and it works . 
  in my opinion the road cyclist community in the uk are a bunch of suicidal idiots . 
  they behave as they do because they believe bikes ** should ** have the same rights as a car on the road , and maybe they 're correct about that , they ** should ** . 
  but it does n't matter when an accident that would be a minor shunt between two cars becomes a potentially fatal incident as soon as a cyclist is involved . 
  and as i 've already said , maybe you are right that statistically you are less in danger by being two abreast or in a pack to make it harder and more dangerous for cars to pass you . 
  but in doing so you are literally being martyrs , using your own vulnerability to force people to do the right thing , which is fine most of the time until it 's not at which point you do n't get a 2nd chance . 
  personally i 'd like to see the rights of road cyclists removed completely . 
  100 % of inner city areas should have cycle lanes , rules about pavement cycling should be relaxed and in all other areas road cycling should be forbidden , long distance cyclists should be made to use the vast expanses of footpaths and tracks we have in the countryside , cyclists have no place on busy de-restricted a-roads pretending to be real vehicles . 
  or if not a complete ban , cyclists should be banned from all roads with more than a certain speed limit just as they are banned from the motorways . 
  there 's no denying that measures like this would decreases injuries and fatalities . 
  do your family a favour , get the fucking bus , and make up the cardio in the gym , because if you do go under a bus they 'll spend the rest of your life wishing that 's what you had done . 
  where did i defend road rage moron ? 
  i 'm not defending this shit at all , i 'm just stating how stupid i think people who cycle like this are . 
  frankly , no , people do n't get to choose their risk aversion when it affects other people . 
  what about the drivers who will kill cyclists despite the cyclist being at fault e.g skipping a red or trying to overtake a legally turning car on the inside ? 
  it 's they who 'll have to live with it . 
   also , the idea that these cyclists or any others do n't contribute to building roads really gives you away as an uninformed asshole spreading hate . 
  that 's completely irrelevant . 
  i know that the roads are n't paid for solely by road tax , but road tax is an additional tax symbolic of the requirement of road users to pay additional taxes in order to use the roads . 
  even if cyclists are contributing in a general sense , as are pedestrians and public transport users , if you want `` the same right as a car '' , you should `` pay the same amount as a car '' . 
  simple as that . 
  if it were up to me i 'd ban road cycling from everywhere but cycle lanes and roads with speed limits of 40mph or under . 
  amazingly i reckon we 'd see a massive reduction in injuries , fatalities , reduced costs to the tax payer in medical costs and a reduction in congestion as well . 
  then we could put funding into building a stronger network of cycle lanes like many other nw european countries have . 
  the majority of cyclists would n't even be affected , just the entitled wankers who think they have the god given right to cycle down roads with 70mph speed limits at 30mph risking death and increasing congestion . 
  in other words : `` this repressed in denial homosexual is afraid of being emasculated should a woman take away his substitute erection '', 
  good response ... stay safe . 
  there 's no place for drugs in cameron 's big society , the poor will squander their wages on it rather than saving for the next time the banks accidentally lose all their money like a prudent tory would . 
  the only exception to this of course is if you 're an ex-public school boy fresh out of oxbridge doing a bit of naughty salt on the side while they 're roughing it living in somewhere awful like fulham until daddy 's friends decide you 've messed around with the proles long enough to warrant a pay rise and a bonus . 
  we can trust the upper middle classes not to overindulge and if they do they wo n't a burden to the tax payer anyway as they can afford 5 star rehab clinics . 
  [ ca n't be worse than my recent trip to the us ] ( https://i.imgur.com/ro0slfr.jpg ), 
  if you 're living in a developed country you 've probably got your own local reasonable accurate news stations and access to television . 
  if you 're somewhere less developed or with a spare population the bbc world news might be your only access to impartial news or news altogether , thus lots of coverage of those areas . 
  want to ? 
  pretty sure it was already done . 
  lol . 
  no it 's not . 
  i 'm sorry , but that 's not it works . 
  you ca n't just pretend your beliefs or the common beliefs of the cycling community are unchallengeable truth . 
  your facts are n't `` fact '' , they 're your beliefs , who are shared by some but not all people . 
  you are not an impartial observer , and neither are the sources you 've linked , hardcore road cyclists obviously have a biased opinion weighted towards rights for cyclists . 
  your opinion is no better than mine , you are not professor of cyclogy at oxford university . 
  there are plenty of anti-cycling lobbies who want to see road cycling restricted , many of them consisting of people who 've lost loved ones who were cycling on the road . 
  just as there are pro cycling lobbies who want to see the rights of cyclists further enshrined in law , stuff like making it illegal to pass a cyclist if any part of the passing car is in the same lane . 
  of course nothing happens and the status quo is maintained because it 's such an opinion splitting matter with cyclists losing their shit like babies when criticised and many car drivers just taking an anti-position because they do n't like cyclists . 
  ultimately , i 've given you my opinion , which is that if you cycle on busy roads such as restricted country a and b roads which see heavy traffic or dual carriage ways you 're an idiot . 
  if you want to travel on a 60mph road you should be able to travel at 60mph , simple as that . 
  and if you cycle like how you suggest then you 've got a deathwish . 
  deal with it and move on . 
  i did n't say it was illegal to cycle two abreast in the uk . 
  i said it was in germany , where i much prefer the cycling culture . 
  people here , while being very pro cycling , understand that bicycles are not cars , and the primary function of the road is to serve cars not bikes . 
  virtually everywhere has a cycle lane which is tied into the pedestrian crossing system , not the regular lights . 
  the people here actually use the cycle lanes too , because they 're not martyrs with a death wish wanting to show all the lazy car drivers they 're equally as important as their vehicle . 
  unlike the uk where the cyclists just bitch about how bad the lanes are and how they should be optional and so forth . 
  i like the cyclists here , because they 're just ordinary people on bikes , whereas in the uk you have to a fucking tosser in spandex to ride a bike given how dangerous it is . 
  and the uk cycling community is toxic , with every indignant middle class balding tit getting on their high horse about it at every opportunity . 
  furthermore ... really is that the best * `` evidence '' * you can find to support your claim ? 
  you 're having a laugh right ? 
  reading what you 've provided , i 'll note that bikelaw is obviously a bias pro-cycling website , citing a fucking blog post from `` some guy '' which claims two abreast is safer . 
  furthermore , if we look at the committee results , there is no research done into riding two abreast , the committee simply concluded, 
  `` motorist-overtaking-bicyclist crashes involving bicyclists riding two abreast are practically non-existent -- we can not find any record of them happening in nc '', 
  so the absence of recorded incidents in one state is meant to prove that cycling two abreast is somehow obviously not more dangerous . 
  absence of evidence is not evidence of absence . 
  do you not see how the absence of recorded crashes involving two abreast cyclists in one us state is not evidence that riding two abreast is safer ? 
  it 's not even an argument . 
  it 's just saying `` we 're not going to change it because we have no grounds to do so '' .
