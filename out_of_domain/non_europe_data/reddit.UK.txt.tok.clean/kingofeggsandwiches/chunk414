  yeah , i think my public school experience was vastly different from yours . 
  less nancy mitford and more top bantz with the 1st 11 on the way back from twickers downing guinness out of a shoe . 
  i do n't know what you 're even talking about . 
  nothing i said had anything to do with the film . 
  the allegations of `` whitewashing '' in hollywood are something i 'm totally indifferent to . 
  to me the whole concept of `` whitewashing '' in hollywood seems like some american concept of racial equality that seems like a non-issue in the rest of the world . 
  a bit like how americans lose their shit at the thought of blackface , regardless of the context , seems like a whole load of fuss over nothing . 
  most visible absence of an accent if you ask me . 
  bloody yanks and their funny words noises . 
  no idea why you think that, 
  it was beautiful , i had the honour of playing there for the last 6th months and it was the best time i 've had in wow since tbc . 
  i have faith . 
  whatever , i do n't find that convincing , sounds you 're trying to convince me way too hard . 
  `` cultural differences '' is such a bullshit explanation for anything . 
  i 'm just as capable as seeing asian facial features as you are . 
  i 'm still think that anime depictions are westernised to some degree . 
  sure they 're no trying to draw caucasians , i never suggested they were , but there is definitely western influence in there , whether you want to admit it or not . 
  wanting to play a version of the game that is n't completely different to what they bought originally ? 
  providing servers for free to the community ? 
  those evil bastards !, 
  i assumed that it was because the high sparrow has complete control of him . 
  maybe using his naive feelings for margaery against him since they 're holding her captive . 
  have to see next week . 
  nope she has to go to the dothraki temple . 
  i knew it was coming because it already established that khal 's widows go there . 
  tin foil hats suit you, 
  i know a guy who converted to marry a girl he 'd been seeing since school who was egyptian and whose parents would n't have approved otherwise . 
  they seem pretty moderate and westernised though , although they do practise islam and go the mosque every week . 
  no booze and no dogs in the house . 
  the wife wears a headscarf . 
  other than that it would be hard to know . 
  i do n't know any crazy extreme muslims who are white . 
  no the criteria is gdp per capita and economic diversity . 
  italy has a large and varied manufacturing sector , making everything from clothes to cars to guns . 
  ever been to milan ? 
  it 's an economically powerful city that could easily be in germany or the uk or anywhere . 
  ireland has loads of stuff too , finance , it , customer support , manufacturing . 
  these countries were defined as advanced because they have high gdp per capita and their gdp does not rely heavily on one industry . 
  none , but converts to any religion tend to have the stereotype of being crazy and extreme . 
  probably phrased that badly , what i meant to say was `` i 've never met or seen any of those crazy and extreme radicalised white people you occasionally see on television or in the papers '' . 
  but it 's tru tv, 
  it 's a matter of gradable and ungradable adjectives . 
  they teach this to learners of english at quite a low level . 
  basically , some adjectives already express extremity ( we call these ungradable adjectives ) , which makes combining them with adverbs that express the matter of degree redundant . 
  for example `` it was very boiling '' sounds weird , the kind of thing that only an english 2nd language speaker would say , because if you 're saying `` boiling '' then the `` very '' is already implied . 
  however , it is ok to say something like `` it is very hot '' , because `` hot '' is gradable , it can be moderately hot , or it can be very hot , so the use of `` very '' is not redundant . 
  a similar thing works in reverse , if you say `` it 's absolutely hot '' it sounds a bit strange . 
  this is because `` absolutely '' ( in this sense ) is an adverbs that functions to simply reinforce the fact that something is at the maximum , in which case why did n't you use the ungradable form ( if there is one ) . 
  consequently these kind of reinforcing adverbs , opposed to adverbs that express degree , are only acceptable to combine with ungradable adjectives like boiling . 
  so the rules are . 
  ( adverb of degree ) + ( gradable adjective ) 2 . 
  ( adverb reinforcing the maximum ) + ( ungradable adjective ) . 
  e.g it 's very hot / it 's absolutely boiling, 
  it 's very cold / it 's absolutely freezing, 
  i 'm extremely wet / i 'm completely soaking, 
  i 'm extremely frightened / i 'm completely terrified, 
  i 'm very drunk / i 'm totally hammered, 
  it 's very good / it 's totally amazing, 
  so absolutely fun sounds off to you because you think that fun is more of a gradable adjective than an ungradable , which means when it 's paired with absolutely ( an adverb that reinforces the maximum ) , it sounds off . 
  i imagine `` it looks extremely fun '' sounds just fine to you , because extremely is an adverb expressing degree . 
  i 'm prepared to let this slide though because ultimately there 's no ungradable adjective in english that means exactly the same as fun . 
  the closest you could get would be something like `` absolutely amazing '' or `` totally exhilarating '' , which does n't quite have the same meaning . 
  edit : wow , gold thanks , i 'd better correct some terminology then , words like very and absolutely are adverbs not adjectives . 
  \uff21\uff25\uff33\uff34\uff28\uff25\uff34\uff29\uff23, 
  what kind of sausage have you got in that hot dog ? 
  frankfurter , thought so , is frankfurt in america ? 
  stop culturally appropriating me !, 
   incidentally , americans should n't eat apple pie -- it 's dutch . 
  no it 's not . 
  it was eaten all over northern europe since before records began , nobody `` invented '' apple pie , although we can agree that the americans ca n't eat it . 
  [ this is how i imagine tru tv ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4z7vp-gzk1q ), 
  what a load of shit . 
  comic nerds will make anything light and fun into some faux important issue , they 'll also bitch about anything . 
  one of the reasons i , and i 'm other people too , like x-men but do n't like crap like avengers is because it tries to be a bit more real and less comic book . 
  are they making these films to please comic nerds or to please the general public ? 
  totally disagree with this guy . 
  i disagree , batman and spiderman were bad films in my opinion , the latest x-men were actually better films that did n't feel like just fan service . 
  the style of sausage you typically associate with a hot dog is called a frankfurter , obviously they 're not as authentic as the ones in frankfurt but that 's what they 're meant to be . 
  no , you can only eat completely unique foodstuffs that you can prove were invented by someone with a valid passport from your country . 
  americans can eat corn dogs and hot pockets , if you eat poutine you 're a culturally appropriating shitlord who needs to check their privilege . 
  dogs coming back next episode confirmed !, 
  you know botchlings are actually based on real folklore , check out mylings, 
  i do n't understand your logic . 
  why have n't you gone with :, 
  you 've basically said `` slay the lords '' `` mother is slave masters '' , it kind of defeats the point of the message which is the assert that daenarys is the same as the people the older piece of graffiti was protesting ( regardless of which word it uses as it reflects the change of public opinion in the city ) and it is also a bit ungrammatical . 
  your declension is incorrect with `` belmurtys '' , not only have you used the accusative when `` issa '' asserts identity and therefore takes the nominative as it does in most languages ( modern english being the exception , english allows stuff like `` it is him '' whilst most languages would insist on `` it is he '' , i checked that high valyrian was n't like english with the phrase `` raqnon n\u0101kost\u014db\u0101ves issa '' `` love is weakness '' ) , but you 've also used the plural accusative form of belmurtys ( the singular has no accent over the i ) . 
  belmurtys being 2nd declension / solar / - ys stem ( like loktys : sailor ) . 
  since there is only one mhysa being referred to , this should take the singular form . 
  so what it should say imho is :, 
  `` belmurt\u012b oss\u0113n\u0101t\u0101s ; mhysa belmurtys issa '' or to break it down ( belmurtys : noun , 2nd declension , solar , - ys stem , plural , accusative ) + ( oss\u0113nagon : verb , regular , nasal stem , imperative , plural ) ; ( mhysa : noun , 1st declension , lunar , - a stem , singular , nominative ) + ( belmurtys : noun , 2nd declension , solar , - ys stem , singular , nominative ) + ( sagon : verb , irregular , indicative , present , 3rd person , singular ), 
  this would most accurately be `` kill the slave masters ! '', 
  `` mother is a slave master '' . 
  alternatively you could have '' \u0100eksia oss\u0113n\u0101t\u0101s ; mhysa \u0100eksio issa '' . 
  but from my understanding \u0100eksio is more like `` lord '' than slave master . 
  edit : it occurred to me that i should n't be too discouraging , high valyrian is a fuck of a language with hardly any resources to explain it so it 's good that you 've made this . 
  i mean who the fuck makes a language with 6 different declensions , 8 cases , 4 numbers , 4 genders , and then sticks a bunch of semi-irregular stem variations off these declensions , not to mention 10 verb conjugation patterns each with 7 tenses , that 's 14 endings when you factor in voice , 56 when you include number and person , double that to 112 when you add the subjunctive mood , and then you 've got participles , imperative , infinitives on top of that . 
  as far as i can see it 's a language with over 640 ways to end a noun and over 1120 ways to end a verb , the real number of possibilities being far higher than this . 
  edit2 : i 'll also add that it 's controversial that i 've described mhysa as 1st declension lunar since it 's a loan word , but people seem to think it would be treated as such in high valyrian due to the stem , ultimately it does n't affect the translation .
