  you are retarded if you think russia could get anywhere in europe . 
  500 million in the eu vs 140 million in russia , + over 3 times the military spending and vastly vastly larger and more productive economies . 
  i 'm afraid it 's you clapburgers who are overly concerned about security , because you 're a bunch of paranoid reactive panic buyers who are afraid of your own shadow and still think it 's 1980 and the cold war is in full swing .

  except that 's a complete load of shit , you would n't even know the refugees are here . 
  a few cases of abuse and rape does not make an epidemic , in fact even with the refugees the rate of rapes is still lower than the us . 
  the only thing funny here is your delusional belief about germany is like currently .

  fuck off , you are n't welcome here . 
  good , we do n't need your money . 
  argentina i 'd guess lol, 
  we are n't concerned about russia , please leave . 
  that 's true , the german people would welcome it . 
  actually yes , we wish you 'd fuck off . 
  we hate that you try to play world police , please stop it . 
  we do n't need your protection . 
  go ahead , fucking do it , slash your military budget by 80 % and focus only on homeland security , we 'd welcome it . 
  you are talking a load of steaming shit there my friend . 
  rent is very cheap in germany , berlin even has a housing surplus . 
  tax is pretty average for a developed nation ( the us is an anomaly because of its retarded politics , which is why americans lack the basics most countries take for granted like functional public transport that does n't smell like piss and access to education ) . 
  also germany has an it sector worth billions , in fact half the people i know work in technology , so that 's a load of shit too . 
  you sound very jaded , like most people who are made to move abroad against their will you have a incredibly biased opinion of the country towards the negative . 
  about time the us stopped pretending the cold war is still going on as a front for their for-profit wars and got the fuck out of europe . 
  we do n't want or need you . 
  if you think you contribute to our security you 're delusional . 
  so what you 're saying is that your personal opinions about the state of the it industry in germany means that there 's no hope of working in technology in germany ? 
  wow , that 's stupid . 
   rent not being high ? , almost 40 - 50 % of my monthly income goes to rent and i am living cheap for my region, 
  i find that hard to believe if you 're an it professional . 
  you can get a flat in most germany cities for 500 euros a month , so earn as little as you say you 'd have to be earning pittance . 
  either that or you live in central munich and are paying way more than you can afford . 
   yes the system is built for public transportation that 's for sure , if they were n't always striking ( at least automation might take over there , germans are good at that ), 
  where 's been like a what ? 
  a week of db strikes in the last couple of years , that narrative is retarded . 
   too bad all the good doctors are moving to the states, 
  yeah that 's not happening . 
  in fact if the doctors go anywhere they 'd probably go to australia or nz because the economy is vastly better for doctors there and it 's far easier to start practising there as a foreign doctor . 
  we are funding our social programmes . 
  when the us pulls out we 'll change absolutely nothing . 
  amazingly , russia wo n't suddenly invade as your fox news paranoia has got you believing . 
  actually it is what they say . 
  the only countries scared of russia are the poorer ex-soviet bloc countries , why do n't you move your bases over there ? 
  most eu countries already have sufficient military spending to defend their borders , it 's only the us who are obsessed with power projection and hosting invasions of countries there other side of the world . 
  amazingly , a major western european power with military funding that rivals russia 's , one which is part of nato , the un , and the eu , is not the same as poor state that border 's russia and was nothing more than a puppet government of russia but until a few years ago . 
   yes it rivals russia 's budget . 
  but you do n't buy at the same market , or pay the same price . 
  apples and oranges . 
  what the fuck are you talking about . 
  all the most hi-tech arms are developed in europe or the us . 
  russia does n't even have access to a lot of this technology , whereas most western countries have relatively full access . 
  russian equipment is like at least 15 years behind the western allies . 
  you are talking absolute shit . 
  it is apples and oranges , russia 's billions ca n't even buy it what europe can buy , so it should be considered even less . 
  even so , all this talk of militaries is complete bollocks , because 1 ) russia is n't going to invade any time soon , that would be suicidal 2 ) europe has 2 nuclear powers , and a fair few countries that could easily become nuclear powers if they needed to .
