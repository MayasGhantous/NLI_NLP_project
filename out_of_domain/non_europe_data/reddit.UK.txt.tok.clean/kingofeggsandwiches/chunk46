  jog on son !, 
  mostly a load of tosh . 
  oh look some minor cultural differences , no hipsters ? 
  wow we 're in different culture . 
  we 've got everything !, 
  wow arrogant much . 
  what you have here is culture lite . 
  yes you can go to a different climate and geography so what ? 
  pretend you 're travelling when you 're never far from your favourite brand of chain restaurant and everyone perfectly understands you . 
  aussie rules obviously, 
  judging by the puncture marks around my car door lock where people have unsuccessfully had a go i 'd say that 's why ... 
  that would n't go down well in the west or west midlands .

  i 'll let you off on account of [ ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmkysndx4du ),

  your friend is messing with you quite clearly . 
  the myth that english beer is warm is because in england there 's four kinds of beer here : ale , bitter , stout and lager . 
  all but lager are served at cellar temperature , which means it should n't be warm but it wo n't be chilled either , a bit like red wine . 
  lager is by far the dominant beer in the us to the point where beer just basically means lager . 
  in the old days yanks would come into pubs , ask for a beer or be bought one by a briton , be given some ale and then wonder why it was n't icy cold and tasted different . 
  they 'd then of course go home to the us and spread the idea that britons drank funny tasting warm beer rather than realise they were getting a totally different drink from what they 'd expected . 
  if you order lager it will always be cold unless you 've happened upon the worst pub in the uk somehow . 
  a tip for ordering : use `` i would like a '' or `` could i have a '' , do n't say `` can i get a. . . '' or `` i want a. . . '' the latter are considered uncouth , i wo n't lecture you on please and thank you since coming from the deep south i 'm sure you 're well aware of these . 
  in regards to pubs , realise that in almost all drinking establishments ( not restaurants ) you 're expected to go up and pay for your drinks at the bar then carry them back to your table , if there are staff wandering around it 's likely that they 're just wiping down tables and are n't waiters who want to take your order . 
  use your common sense of course if they 're taking orders from other people it might be that you 're somewhere that does do it this way . 
  do n't cross your utensils , put them together vertically on your plate knife facing inward when you 're done . 
  not a clue where your friend is getting these ideas from . 
  another tip in this area would be to eat with both utensils at the same time . 
  do n't chop your food then set your knife down and use your fork like a skewer and spoon , it seems juvenile to europeans . 
  do n't call us brits , we never refer to ourselves as that except occasionally on reddit to blend in . 
  we 're all britons at worst , preferably english , scottish , welsh and irish , do n't insult any of the latter by calling them the former . 
  do n't rent a car in london it 's the worst idea imaginable , you wo n't find anywhere to park to start with or you 'll get tickets from not understanding the rules , the traffic is horrendous , you 'll get lost so it 'll end up taking more time than the tube / buses . 
  you do n't need a car at all to be honest , the train will take you to all the important places . 
  if you do want a car then wait until you 're done with london , find a place outside the city reachable by public transport and drive when you want to explore the rest of the country . 
  even then be wary of british driving rules , there 's no left turning ( right turning in usa ) at red lights , even when it 's clear , there 's no rules about coming to a complete stop , there 's lots of roundabouts ( always give way to the right ) , there 's lots of zebra crossing ( crosswalks ) where pedestrians have right of way , never pass on the left on a multi-lane carriageway . 
  no they just quietly judged you !, 
  probably : please god do n't let the tabloids disgrace us too badly or any angry mob bosses put prices on our heads . 
  i know !, 
  occasionally it just slips out . 
  particularly when buying coffee in starbucks or whatnot , surely conditioning from too many yank films . 
  i 'm so glad someone saw it . 
  i was lucky enough to see the whole tragic poem in stratford the town of shakespeare 's birth . 
  camille o'sullivan is wonderful here 's some of her other stuff [ here singing dylan 's `` do n't think twice '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iegbpsuphpo ) and [ here brel 's `` la chanson de jackie '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak0dohoo43i ) maybe slightly more uplifting . 
  i think i 'm in love ... 
  yeah like vietnam , go / r/inglin !, 
  well done !, 
  those amusement parks bitches do n't deserve shiiit !, 
  no the rules were implemented by 1909 . 
  then nobody changed them and no one had much interest in changing until much later on . 
  probably half of all new taps in the uk are now are mixer anyway , some people prefer separate taps especially in kitchens for dish washing . 
  that 's not a debate i 'm touching , needless to say some would be prefer to be called northern irish , some british irish , others british . 
  no yew, 
  i am yet to see one of these outside of supermarket car parks , but i think this exception would be self-explanatory anyway . 
  where does it fit in ? 
  err ? 
  in a pint glass on a hot summer 's afternoon like today ? 
  it 's not a beer is it haha, 
  here 's a [ climbing place ] ( http://peterboroughclimbingwall.co.uk/ ) in peterborough,

  i think you 're over thinking this . 
  she 's 28 not 18 , talking with the parents is unlikely to happen , if they open the door and say hello then by all means be polite , introduce yourself and be cordial , you do n't need to be deferential or call her dad `` sir '' or any of that nonsense . 
  usually the one who invited the other on the date pays , then again the other person will usually offer to pay as well or go dutch , typical etiquette is to decline and say you 've got it covered unless they insist . 
  there 's no rules about kissing or sex or whatever , just go with the flow ffs !, 
  wear what you think looks good , you do n't need to be smart in the pub , just do n't dress like you 're ready for the gym . 
  ( how bristolians actually say nice ), 
  it 's used non-literally to imply something so luxurious and hedonistic that one must have low morals to enjoy it without guilt . 
  this is not a new meaning of the term . 
  you should get out more . 
  [ this bbc one is very good as well in my opinion ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfcgoyshedi ) - this should be fun ?

  what on earth is a milk bone ? 
  you 've misunderstood . 
  call me a briton or british if you like , do n't call me `` a brit . '', 
  i 'd prefer foreigners took the time to acknowledge that we 're four different countries in a union but i have no problem being british whatsoever . 
  i think that 's self-explanatory really . 
  if it bothers you so get ye to / r/scottishproblems, 
  i hope you realise how difficult obtaining a citizenship here is , unless you 're a millionaire share holder , a leading pioneer in your field , have close family here or marry you 'll be very lucky to get here . 
  you do n't see the difference between the term `` brit '' and briton ? 
  i 've never seen or heard any british person use the word `` brit '' outside of reddit . 
  it 's basically an americanism and using it will make you stand out as not being well experienced with british culture immediately , which is what op did n't want to do . 
  calvin klein is actually made in china, 
  obviously not since you believe people use terms that they quite frankly never do . 
  i will admit briton is n't that common these days and people tend to prefer the british or british people , but it is at least the proper word and not a piece of colonial slang . 
  next you 'll be saying we call ourselves redcoats , lobsterbacks and limeys . 
  it 's not difficult as in hard to do , it 's just hard to qualify to get indefinite leave to remain here and therefore hard to become a british national . 
  thanks for cutting my town in half :(, 
  watford or the watford gap ? 
  because the watford gap bisects warwickshire laterally , if only to confuse things more . 
  way to bring the usa into things unnecessarily , are you really shocked some things are n't in the us , this planet of 7 billion is far more diverse than just one country with a god complex . 
  now that 's what i call capitalist initiative !, 
  a lame tendency indeed . 
  i wear one of [ these ] ( http://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/mtmxnfgxnjaw/z/ez0aamxqlgts5qg0/$_58.jpg ), 
  i have to disagree the the - u 's are not superfluous , it 's the bloody letters the yanks leave in that are superfluous . 
  colour is pronounced cul-luh , pronouncing it cul-lor is just madness !, 
  what you 're saying saying does n't make sense , or is pronounced - or , not - our , that at least has a - u in it . 
  kul-lur is the right way to say it , why do n't americans understand the [ / schwa / ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/schwa ) !, 
  children pronounce all the letters because they 're still learning , but you 'd save time and effort were you to grow past this !, 
  i 'm an englishman and i 've been twice , although i 've never met anyone else who has .
