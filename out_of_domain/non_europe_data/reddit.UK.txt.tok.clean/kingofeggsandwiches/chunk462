  zenmate is good , even the free version :p, 
  really ? 
  i rarely meet germans who have that mentality , mostly they seem forward thinking and willing to welcome foreigners ( i live in nrw ) . 
  when i 'm back in the uk i hear plenty of people grumbling about the bloody foreigners coming over here , stealing our jobs , claiming our benefits , and overburdening our healthcare system . 
  i mean i even hear stuff like `` i ca n't get a council house because i 'm not polish and other such bullshit . '', 
  asides the occasional pegida supporting tattooed asi skinhead walking around with his rockweiler that he keeps in a one bedroom flat drinking oettinger fliesendtisch owning idiot , the german people seem positively progressive :p, 
  you wo n't be saying that when switzerland goes for the science victory !, 
  i 'm still waiting for north america , let alone the us , to starting sending their own astronauts into space again :d, 
  it 's the girl with the dragon tattoo , let 's hope he/she does n't rape their trusted man up the arse with a dildo . 
  quit that shit man . 
  i had to quit for a year to prove i 'd really beaten it , i occasionally smoke a j now and then these days , but before i was a wake and up and smoke until bedtime , get anxious when i was running low kind of guy . 
  i would n't stop talking to you because i hate you . 
  i 'd stop talking to you because i 'd be worried you bust me for that oz of dank in my sock drawer . 
  just do it . 
  prepare yourself mentally . 
  get yourself a small number of sleeping tablets if you must , just to get you through the first week or so , i found ambien to be great because it has a hypnotic effect that has a similarity to weed and wo n't just knock you the fuck out for you to wake up feeling shit again a few hours later . 
  after that transfer to something weaker and otc like night nurse . 
  some people say to throw away your stash and delete your dealers number . 
  that did n't work for me because i 'd get anxiety thinking about the idea that i could n't get weed . 
  instead i just wrapped it up in cling film , sticky tapped it shut , chucked in a lockbox , and put the key in the boot of my car . 
  drink some wine in the evenings to take the edge off , buy yourself an addictive video game or download a long series like breaking bad or something . 
  starcraft 2 worked for me because it 's a very intensive game that i was actually more suited to when i was n't stoned . 
  roll yourself one giant joint before you go to bed one night , and then lock the rest away like i said . 
  start that first day by saying i no longer smoke . 
  eat small meals and often , getting too full will make you want a joint , good healthy food not junk food , get your vitamins , go on long runs or go to the gym , work out until you 're physically exhausted everyday . 
  i had to figure out what was causing my anxiety , turned what i was afraid of was being in a situation where i wanted to get weed but could n't get it , the other fear was that my mind would literally snap . 
  however , having that weed squirrelled away , out of convenient reach but not impossible to get , made me realise i was being afraid of nothing . 
  i told myself `` if it ever gets so bad , so bad that i 'm literally losing my mind , then i can go get that relief if i have to '' . 
  simultaneously , however , i told myself that i 'm better and stronger than this . 
  i did have a relapse once , smoked a small joint about 9 days in , felt so guilty that the feeling of guilt was worse than the craving ever were . 
  seriously , about 2 months later and i was feeling great . 
  it was really just 2 shitty weeks , and then 2 mediocre ones , after that i started to really enjoy not feeling stoned , and realised how lazy and boring it had been making me . 
  i was easily smoking 1-2 grams a day , morning to evening by the way . 
  you can do it bro . 
  / r/leaves is a great place for support . 
  my accent is pretty decent :d certainly good enough to fool someone who does n't speak the language , good enough to fool people who are n't as fluent as i the majority the time , certainly not good enough to convince a native speaker or someone with near native fluency . 
  do n't know which one to categorise the average dutchman as . 
  most people think i 'm dutch when i speak german actually , although i occasionally get swedish . 
  my \u00fc comes out a bit exaggerated . 
  i did manage to convince a german i was bavarian for few minutes once , basically just by speaking like a drunk and rolling my - r a lot ^ ^, 
  shush you traitorous swine , my legion of mecha-brits will be keeping order by the time you know what 's hit you . 
  yeah , i lived in bavaria for a year so i picked up some tricks :d,
