  people watch too many films and think they 're on every flight . 
  i spoke it at a basic level when arrived , i got by with limited german , now my german is more more comprehensive but still not fluent . 
  the biggest struggle with the language is bureaucratic stuff which is all done in german . 
  setting up internet , for example , can be hard if you ca n't speak german well enough over the phone to sort things out . 
  day to day stuff , such as buying stuff in shops , restaurants , and bars , can all be done in english if you want . 
  it 's all relative though , i laugh when americans say stuff about got actors not realising that half of them have been on british television their whole careers . 
  aiden gillen , however , has been on us tv in big shows before , you should really pay him the respect of calling him by name . 
  i mean he was in the wire and the dark knight rises for christ 's sake and americans love that shit . 
  if you really like utopia , especially the cinematography , i suggest [ you check out residue ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ofujkxk3ci ) , on netflix . 
  it 's directed by alex garcia lopez who worked on utopia , and showcases many of the same styles . 
  it also stars iwan rheon and natalia gastiain tena . 
  it 's horses all the way down . 
  and you trust stars to tell you what to watch , why ? 
  there 's tonnes of highly rated stuff that i just got bored watching , and loads of lower rated stuff that i personally found great . 
  if anything , residue is worth watching for the cinematography , they did a really beautiful job mixing scenes filmed in london and hong kong to create a dystopian landscape . 
  the narrative is n't the strongest i 've ever seen and the dialogue can suck at times . 
  i mean come on , orange is the new black has like 5 stars on netflix and i was falling asleep before even finishing the first season . 
  not everyone 's tastes are the same . 
  except we did receive it back and more in the economic opportunities and growth it brought the country . 
  outside the eu we 'll be losing more than 199m a week in lost opportunities . 
  the british started the work on the bomb first with the tube alloys programme . 
  it was two jewish scientists ( one german born and one austrian born ) , who 'd emigrated to the uk well before the war broke out , who were the first to see the potential for a nuclear fission bomb using existing materials . 
  a big problem was that getting the radioactive material in such large quantities as the methods of extraction and purification were very unrefined at the time . 
  the canadians were brought in on the project to help with this . 
  a lot of the work was large theoretical but it also practically resolved many of the problems that stood in the way of the bomb being a feasible reality rather than merely a theoretical construct . 
  during ww2 the british government realised that with the war effort they were never going to get the resources together to finish the project within a useful time frame , so then an agreement was brokered with the americans to pools resources and knowledge to get project running . 
  all the scientists that had been on the tube alloys project were packed off to the us to work on the manhattan project , and the us and canada contributed their own best minds to collaborate with them . 
  a condition of this was an agreement that the 3 countries involved , us , canada , uk , should all benefit from the fruit of the project , having access to anything it might bear . 
  however , these agreements were brokered under the roosevelt administration in a very secretive way which mean the general public had little knowledge of what was going on . 
  by the time the manhattan project actually created the bomb the hoover administration had come to power , and hoover was much less keen to share a bomb that would put the uk in a position to blow up cities , and did n't feel bound by his predecessors agreements . 
  consequently the us government `` lost '' the pertinent agreement , and pretended that no one in the government knew of it . 
  the us also passed the mcmahon act , forbidding the us government from sharing research relating to nuclear weapons . 
  both the uk and canada were incredibly pissed off about this , and it actually led to a 10 year `` cooling '' of us-uk relations . 
  it 's a big reason why the uk did n't play a more active role in the war in the pacific . 
  arguably , this could be considered a contributory factor in why the us were able to us the bomb on japan , because they were acting alone and were n't tied down by the bureaucratic quibbles of a military coalition . 
  the uk recalled all its scientists from the manhattan project and set them to work reconstructing the bomb , essentially reverse engineering the work they 'd done there from memory . 
  this is why britain did n't get a bomb of its own until 1952 . 
  when britain did get its own bomb the us government decided to relax its stance on sharing nuclear secrets with foreign powers , and later on all data from tests were shared with the british , which is why britain did n't do that much nuclear testing of its own while the russians , and later the french , did . 
  that was the leave campaign 's strategy yes , any moron knows that the market access we get within the eu is worth over 200 million a week to the uk economy . 
  [ citation provided ] ( http://news.cbi.org.uk/reports/our-global-future/factsheets/factsheet-2-benefits-of-eu-membership-outweigh-costs/ ), 
   a cbi literature review suggests that the net benefit of eu membership to the uk could be in the region of 4-5 % of gdp or # 62bn - # 78bn a year -- roughly the economies of the north east and northern ireland taken together . 
  in comparison, 
   the uk 's net contribution to the eu budget is around $ 7.3 bn , or 0.4 % of gdp . 
  as a comparison that 's around a quarter of what the uk spends on the department for business , innovation and skills , and less than an eighth of the uk 's defence spend . 
  the # 116 per person net contribution is less than that from sweden , denmark , finland , germany and the netherlands . 
  ah yes , but i guess the confederation of british industry , of which over 190,000 british businesses are a member of are just talking shit right ? 
  ah yes mate , it 's all a conspiracy . 
  you fucking nutcase . 
  around the indy ref i heard a few people say `` i hope the scots leave so they can fund their own luxury welfare system/socialist utopia '' . 
  asides from that i rarely hear anti-scottish sentiment . 
  i mean nobody actually questions right of scots to be part of british society , so you 've still got it x50 better than the polish . 
  i 've been accused of `` wanting britain to fail '' for thinking that the uk is going to get screwed in any future trade negotiations by the same people who 've been calling the eu a failed project and cheering at its shortcoming for how many years now ? 
  protest and what ? 
  do n't know why you 're getting downvoted . 
  must be some irrational patriots about . 
  the us is the only country to try to collect tax from nationals living overseas . 
  i know people have never lived in the us but have us passports who are afraid of the irs tracking them down one day . 
  no , i just think the country is in a shitty position . 
  now , i do n't `` want the uk to fail '' at all , although i think most brexiteers unashamedly `` want the eu to fail '' , as if that was somehow any different . 
   you 'll be proven, 
  proved * trust patriotic brexiteers to inadvertently use americanisms . 
  depends on the university . 
  if it 's a good one they can probably walk into the finance sector as an analyst . 
  i 'm a `` philosopher at uni '' does n't quite have the same ring to it . 
  mathematic ** s **, 
  math ** s **, 
  in ancient greek , most fields of study were written in such a way that they ended like a plural but were not themselves plural words . 
  this was later reflected in english by ending them with - s e.g mathematics , economics , physics etc. 
  the british abbreviation of mathematics continues to reflect this formula , the americans abbreviation does not . 
  ultimately , it was the old school british mathematicians who first started using the abbreviation and wanted it to retain its etymological legacy who are responsible for the - s on maths . 
  no it 's not . 
  [ this is the most plausible explanation i 've heard ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/4vsk1e/a_tour_of_academia/d62c1w9 ), 
  pretty sure i also got you on the other thing too . 
  wish brexiteers understood this . 
  i 've many say things like `` the drop in currency value is great for exporters '' , which would be great , if the uk exported anything like as much as it imports . 
  because only ukip supporters care that much about who their mep is . 
  we do n't want it to happen , it is happening , which we 're trying to get people to see that . 
  it only looks that way to people who are in denial regarding the negative impacts of brexit . 
  just because big mike down the pub says that brexit wo n't change anything does n't make it true , and the vast majority of academics , businessmen , and financial experts are talking about the damage it 's doing . 
  i mean the most anti-brexit newspaper around ? 
  the financial times . 
  i 'm surprised the traditional right are n't worried when it 's the ft , not the the morning star or something , with the most pessimistic outlook . 
  sadly , it 's just a sign of the times , we 're moving away from the economic right wing who advocate free market thinking and oppose left wing people before economics mentality , and towards the alt-right , who advocate protectionism and oppose progressive social thought and globalism . 
  ironically though , the masterminds behind brexit were the most extreme free market thinkers who ca n't wait to make the british people have to compete with chinese workers living off bowls of rice rather than poles who expect a more reasonable standard of living . 
  nobody thinks number of items sold is a sensible metric . 
  generally we look at the value of goods out compared to value of goods in . 
  these were n't american ex-pats , these were people who have the citizenship but have never lived there , either due to a parent or being born on us soil . 
  it 's rather more intimidating when english is n't even your first language and it 's not your culture . 
  ah yes , i see what you mean . 
  so basically a currency 's value on the world exchange market affects the difference in prices between economies more than it does within a single economy . 
  for example , a few years ago russia 's currency dropped massively in value . 
  now , for sake of argument , imagine it dropped 50 % . 
  the price of bread in that country did n't simply double when the price dropped , because bread is made within the russian economy , wages are paid in roubles , grain is bought from russian farmers who pay their wages in roubles and set their prices in roubles . 
  so as far as russians were concerned the price of bread did n't change . 
  ( this is an oversimplification because there are no industries that do n't rely on imports for something or the other but ignore that for now ) . 
  however , from the perspective of a russian the price of an iphone doubled virtually overnight . 
  this is because iphones are bought in dollars . 
  this means the russian importers of iphones have to pay twice as many roubles to buy enough dollars to buy the iphones they sell to customer . 
  when a countries currency drops in value it will always increase the cost of importing goods in other countries whose currency has stayed the same , but simultaneously it benefits exporters whose goods now appear much cheaper to those people who live in countries that use a currency that 's price has stayed the same . 
  if your country exports more than it imports then a drop in your currency can actually be beneficial in the long run , which is why countries like japan do everything they can to stop their currency becoming too valuable on the world stage .
