  those are indian orders not india itself . 
  that sounds irish to you ? 
  sounds new york to me !, 
  fair point , but once you know the language they 're using it narrows it down considerably . 
  obviously it 's not a simple as matching letters to other letters but with computers that know all the permutations and shit . 
  damn i love those videos though . 
  i 'd pay to see that, 
  [ this explains it ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/duke_of_normandy#duke_of_normandy_.28british_monarch.29 ) , my personal favourite :, 
   while queen elizabeth ii was on a visit to mainland normandy in may 1967 , french peasants began to doff their hats and shout `` vive la duchesse !, 
  '' , to which the queen supposedly replied `` well , i am the duke of normandy !, 
  that was actually beautiful , kudos !, 
  quite the pathetic conspiracy theorist are n't you ? 
  [ think again ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/2bc0ty/til_that_the_queen_of_englands_portrait_has_been/cj41ge5 ), 
  well she stopped saying lawst and awff and started saying lost and off if that 's what you mean . 
  source ? 
  are you confusing yourself with l'\u00c9tats unis ? 
  so a few peasants do so and you infer that it 's necessarily sarcastic , i 'm afraid i see no grounding for your `` inference '' , the queen usually receives quite a decent reception in france . 
  ( whatever they say i think they quietly miss their monarchy ), 
  i 'm sorry , but if someone does something , you ca n't assume it 's not a genuine action unless you have some evidence , the onus is on you to prove that the action were in jest . 
  [ here are the french people lining the streets upon a royal visit ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjrrjqufzhk ) now please i want to see the evidence that the denizens of normandy were merely taking the piss when they did as they did . 
  i think you just failed logic 101, 
  you 're simply an idiot . 
  the queen went to normandy . 
  a few peasants came to see her pass by out of curiosity and respect , aware of their cultural heritage they shouted `` vive la duchesse '' ( `` long live the duchess '' in case you were n't aware ) for fun . 
  the queen said humourously `` well i am ( technically ) the duke of normandy '' . 
  there was no spite in it , just a bit of historical banter . 
  what of it ? 
  yes clearly i am a no-life troll for taking the meaning of the words written in wikipedia at face value . 
  please tell me more about how i 'm a no-life troll for doing so , it 's so fascinating . 
  now are you going to support your conjecture that the whole series of events were spiteful or are n't you , otherwise you certainly look the fool for getting into this debate , do n't you ? 
  the monarch forms orders , of knights and other noble folk , some of them were formed in india whilst the royal family were heads of state , the orders persist despite india 's breaking away from the empire . 
  really ? 
  it 's at times like these that ( unlike a large segment of my immediate family ) i enjoy not being one . 
  i mean [ does your country have this ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvgl_2jrius&amp;t=7m18s ), 
  as we say in merry old england , if there 's grass on the wicket , let 's play cricket . 
  you are simply a moron i 'm afraid . 
  the queen performs a roles no different from a civil servant . 
  if people venerate anything it 's the historical legacy she represents , nobody is required to respect her or even her position . 
  certainly no worse than having schoolchildren pledge allegiance everyday or america 's infatuation with the founding fathers . 
  here you go , like this : -, 
  alternatively , which strongly reddit endorsed opinion do you disagree with ... dae think atheism and funny pictures of cats suck balls ? 
  if reddit 's taught me anything its that many americans have no clue about the size of anything . 
  it always comes up when discussing gun crimes / police fatalities , that they 'll be some who think the difference can be explained by screaming about `` per capita '' as if the us were hundreds of times the size of every other developed nation . 
  mercian britain is the best britain , in the far south they 're virtually french , in the north they 're practically a bunch of scandinavians , to the west nothing but celts . 
  mercia is the true england !, 
  mercia will bury you !, 
  shakespeare was n't from the north, 
  i understand that the vowel shift was virtually over by the time shakespeare was writing , furthermore there 's no such thing as a generic northern accent really , of the variety of northern accents , very few have significantly shifted vowels . 
  there 's a video floating around of what phonetician think shakespeare would 've sounded like and it certainly is n't a generic northern accent . 
  it 's more like west country mixed with irish and the extinct rural yorkshire dialect . 
  that 's kind of the point, 
  with a website like that there 's no stopping us !, 
  is this really facebook ? 
  sounds more like twitter . 
  my facebook is just `` amg gusy i got married '' `` omg look at these pix of me on holiday '' `` random pix of my children so you know what i 'm about '' `` girl 's night with mah besties !, 
  ! 11 '' `` look at my fancy restaurant dinner '' . 
  basically just insecure people fishing for likes and trying to display their life as exciting full of partying and holidays . 
  well as a european i find america ridiculous , what with your loud uneducated opinions , your gun totting hicks , your vulgar outdated nationalism and your religious notions . 
  those things exist , they are at least actually things , unlike your wildly generalised nonsense opinion . 
  i 've seen that link many times , it 's actually almost my [ top comment ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/29a88e/eli5_where_does_the_stereotypical_pirate_accent/cij6wq3 ) , the vowels are n't that shifted . 
  if you were listening to pre-vowel shift vowels you would n't understand a word . 
  it 's generally accepted that the shift finished in 1700 , but people then certainly sounded a lot closer to that video then than to most britons of today . 
  i 'm not saying they 're not stereotypes , and i do n't think all americans are those things , but you 'll find plenty of loud uneducated people who believe they 're entitled to their views , gun tottin hicks , nationalists and religious wackos in the usa , such a significant amount it 's clearly visible in your politics in how certain ideologies are taken seriously that simply would n't be in most eu nations . 
  i was just meeting the prior posters ridiculous condescending judgement with one of my own . 
  i do n't know why you 'd think we 're in disagreement . 
  point is though, 
   closer to the northern english accent . 
  is a misleading and inaccurate thing to say . 
  closer to a thick west country accent would be slightly more accurate but still not entirely accurate . 
  me too ? 
  i do n't understand where this filter is ? 
  that 's not actually part of the vowel shift but a later development , it 's actually pretty negligible . 
  furthermore there 's actually 3 ways modern britons pronounce the letter - a although most people are only aware of two . 
  northerners say / \u00e6 / , people in the south east and rp speakers use / \u0251\u02d0 / and people in the west country use / \u00e6 : / . 
  it 's likely ( although i do n't know for sure ) that people then would 've used / \u00e6 : / not / \u00e6 / . 
  the only northerners that are n't affected by the vowel shift so much are in the far north , as [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ets33ijrgj8 ) explains ( it 's in german but with english subs ) . 
  because pro-russian separatists shooting down a passenger plane did n't do that already . 
  of course you probably believe nonsensical propaganda that blames the ukrainians , clearly they had sam capacity in an area completely controlled by pro-russian forces , or used a jet fighter in a 9/11 truther-esque false flag right ? 
  seriously go get an education you moron . 
  just people from school i do n't really give a shit about . 
  the closer the friend the less likely that they 're highly active on facebook generally and i like it that way . 
  no , you 've just demonstrated that you 're a complete and utter moron . 
   i can be outraged both by the ukrainian neo-nazies illegitimate government that started this whole mess, 
  oh yes because wanting to be part of the eu rather what they were , the puppet of a corrupt , racist russian state , clearly makes them neo-facists , get the fuck out you utter moron . 
  you 're an idiot . 
  even if some members of the legitimate ukrainian government are heavily right leaning , democracy is a condition of being an eu member state and that 's the primary driving force in the revolution . 
  if ukraine finally breaks free of the shackles of russian oppression and turns out to be too far to the right or anti-democracy , that is a problem that will be dealt with in turn by real world powers like the eu and the us . 
  a facist ukraine poses no threat at all and wo n't last a year . 
  russia however has no say in the matter , and no grounds for authority , and is heinously funding a bunch of savage nationalists leading to the death of civilians . 
  why ? 
  because it 's ran by a bunch of macho cock waving idiots who wo n't accept their diminished place in the world and beckoning irrelevance and therefore want to maintain their financial and ego driven hold on the area . 
  the ukraine can join the eu , and in turn it will behave as a democracy and russia can go take a flying fuck into irrelevancy like the backwards racist homophobes they are . 
  pipe down obese disowned son , canada is a good boy !, 
  deal with it !, 
  you were n't complaining in 1776 now were you !, 
  such a poignant mix of horrifying reality and hilarity,
