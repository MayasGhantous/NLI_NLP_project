  normally i 'd just say ireland too , but if there 's a need to be clear there 's nothing wrong with distinguishing roi and ni . 
  ironically many brexiteers thought leaving the eu would mean greater protectionism due to reduced immigration , when ironically most the support became from ultra free marketeers for the whom the relatively mild eu tariffs were still too much . 
  while leave did try to paint the eu as economically stagnant and protectionist , they simultaneously painted a future outside the eu where the value of low skill british labour would rise due to absence of immigrant competition , when really fewer tariffs will just mean more of this work being done overseas . 
  it 's libree or nothing . 
  you only feel like a jackass doing it because you 're surrounded by jackasses . 
  `` skone '' is a middle class pretension , truly upper class people say `` skon '' as well . 
  you think we sound pretentious ? 
  [ here 's something you should think about ] ( https://youtu.be/py37ifukxyw?t=5 ), 
   the french pronunciation of the french word croissant uses sounds that do n't even feature in english phonology, 
  yes , but the closest english approximation , the one that the british use , does n't use any sounds that do n't appear in english phonology . 
  the british do n't pronounce the word as the french do . 
  they literally just say `` quah-son '' , which any english speaker is capable of saying . 
  cruh-sont is just wrong . 
  quahson is not remotely hard to say , nobody is asking you to pronounce the guttural - r or nasal - n at the end . 
  you 're just fucking the word up more than it needs to be by saying cruh-sant, 
  fillet is the english word . 
  pronounced fill-it . 
  filet is the french loan word . 
  pronounced fill-ay . 
  it 's not that they misspell the word . 
  it 's just that they prefer the frenchism over the anglicism . 
  i 'm sorry kwa-son is still a far better approximation of the word . 
   also , `` kwa sahn '' is like triple wrong because the french do have a rhotic sound in there , a voiced uvular trill ( what we 'd call a guttural ch ) [ \u0281 ] , the last vowel is a nasalized sound [ \u00e3 ] , and the final n is in fact silent . 
  these are both phonemes that do n't exist in english . 
  kwah-son is literally just saying the word in the closest way you can reconstruct it using english sounds . 
  ( son is far better than sahn , provided - o is pronounced with a rounded vowel , something that yanks struggle with ), 
  while there may be a `` rhotic sound '' in there ( rhotic means almost nothing in this context and typically refers to post-vocalic sounds ) , the similarities between the typical english retroflex or alveolar approximant with an uvular trill are virtually non-existent . 
  this makes it a terrible substitution , and the word retains far more phonetic similarity when no attempt at substituting - r is made ( so it 's simply skipped out ) and then the nasal vowel is substituted with a rounded back vowel followed by an - n . as krw is impossible to say if the - r represents an english type approximant , so including it will result in the kw , becoming kr , which makes the word unrecognisable . 
  say kwa-son to a native french speaker with zero english and they 'll get the message , say cruh-sahnt and you 'll get a blank stare . 
  kwah-son is by far the more accurate and logical preferred pronunciation . 
  if kwa-son is triple wrong , then cruh-sant is like x10 wrong . 
  for comparison . 
  here is the french pronunciation [ k\u0281wa.s\u0251\u0303 ], 
  now the non-us english / kwa.s\u0252n /, 
  now the us english / kr\u0259\u02c8s\u0251nt /, 
  and all the english speakers outside of north america of course . 
  but if you say kwason ( croissant ) , neesh ( niche ) , cleek ( clique ) etc. 
  you 're only using sounds that already exist in english . 
  nobody is asking anyone to use foreign sounds . 
  insisting these pronunciations are correct in america would be like the brits insisting that jalapeno pronounced with an - h is pretentious , and that jal-la-pee-no was the correct way . 
  jewellery is a perfectly valid version of the word . 
  drawers and draws are perfectly homophonic in bbc english , so i suspect you 're the wrong . 
  you 're just defeated your own argument by resorting to name calling . 
  here is the french pronunciation [ k\u0281wa.s\u0251\u0303 ], 
  now the non-us english / kwa.s\u0252n /, 
  now the us english / kr\u0259\u02c8s\u0251nt /, 
  one clearly bears more resemblance to the original while using only those phonemes that exist in english . 
  well in a way the - r is n't there . 
  in british english if an - r follows a vowel is changes the positioning of the vowel . 
  in this case changing the `` a '' of cat to an `` ah '' so that cart is pronounced `` caht '' . 
  it 's pronounced through a shift in vowel positioning as opposed to being a consonant of its own . 
  uncontroversially homophonic when unstressed within a sentence in virtually all dialects of english , if you never do this then you 're the odd one out . 
  it 's a dialect thing . 
  aaron and erin are totally different in non-rhotic english to the point where confusion is impossible . 
  eh-rin and ah-ron . 
  the problem is that the - r 's in rhotic dialects tend to fuck with the vowels around them . 
  which is why for many mary-marry-merry are all homophones , whereas others would think these impossible to confuse . 
  it 's a linking sound that 's been in english for hundreds of years , if you do n't like it then deal with it . 
  it only bothers you because you insist on pronouncing - r in every single word it occurs like some kind of phonetic dictation device . 
  they 've been homophones when unstressed since pre-1900 . 
  i 'm sorry , it 's just how english works . 
  the the words is stressed , as in `` it 's our house ! '', 
  then it should be homophonic with `` hour '' , however , when it 's not stressed as in `` are you coming back to our house ? '', 
  then having `` our '' sound like `` are '' is perfectly normal english . 
  if you 're annoyed by this you 're literally annoyed by the english language . 
  lan-cust-uh is the correct british way . 
  loren and lauren as homophones . 
  the - au is the french - au of haut , not the more anglicised version . 
  in the uk i 've never met a lauren who did n't pronounce it the same as loren , and lauren is a common 1st name for a girl here . 
  the lauren of ralph lauren is pronounced differently because it 's a french surname . 
  however , if you meet two girls called lauren and loren , then it should be the same . 
   there should be absolutely nothing leading you to pronounce it that way . 
  actually there is , it 's the combination of two related linguistic phenomena whose history go back hundreds of years . 
  when english was old english , before the norman conquest , it 's believed that the language was more typically germanic in its pronunciation . 
  german languages tend towards being more abrupt and less flowing on the whole . 
  however , when the normans invaded britain they brought old french with them , which was a romance language , and this impacted the way english was spoken . 
  a feature of french , and in a wide sense romantic languages , is that the flow of language must continue , and glottal stops , whereby air through the through the vocal chords is cut off by the glottis , are avoided . 
  french achieves this through a feature called liaison , which is why the final letter of french words is n't usually pronounced . 
  the only time it is is when the next word begins with a vowel e.g `` les '' normally something like `` lay '' , in the phrase `` les amis '' becomes `` leyzami '' . 
  this preference for flowing speech disseminated amongst the english speaking peoples and affected how english was spoken . 
  english therefore has a large number of linking sounds . 
  `` what are you doing ''  `` wotchadoing ? '' . 
  coming linking sounds in english are / w / / j / ( w and y ) . 
  you probably just do n't notice these invisible sounds creeping in because you 're used to it . 
  however , it 's the use of / r / as a linking sound that splits the english speaking world . 
  the first phenomenon is called linking - r . this is when a dialect that does n't normally pronounce an - r at the end of a word , will do , but only when the next word begins with a vowel . 
  for example , better off becomes `` betteroff '' amongst speakers who 'd normally pronounce better as `` bettuh '' . 
  in this case it 's exactly the same as the french using the silent final letter to link the vowel words and avoid a pause in speech . 
  the other , which is the one you seem annoyed by , is called intrusive - r . now this only occurs when a word ending a vowel , e.g idea , is followed by a word beginning with a vowel . 
  thus `` idea of '' becomes `` idear of '' or `` idea rov '' . 
  now if your own dialect does n't contain his feature , then it will stand out to you very clearly that the word has been pronounced differently , however , amongst those speakers that use it they honest to god wo n't hear the - r sound at all until it is repeatedly pointed out to them . 
  just as all our brains have been trained to ignore the linking w and y in certain phrases , their brains have been trained to ignore this - r , which is officially called intrusive - r. 
  there is a strong correlation between being a rhotic speaker and not using - r as a linking sound . 
  this is because rhotic speakers are - r sensitive , and are listening out for word ending - r sounds , whereas non-rhotic speakers do not . 
  so ultimately that is what is leading people to pronounce it that way . 
  it 's a 1000 years old legacy of pronunciation influence from other languages that as resulted in `` idear '' being heard amongst certain speakers of english . 
  ultimately you can say that `` idear of '' is wrong anymore than a foreigner could tell you that pronouncing `` what are you doing ? '', 
  as `` wotchadoing ? '', 
  is wrong , and it really it sound be pronounced much more formally and separately . 
  i think it 's fine to use the pronunciation that is most common amongst the people you live with .
