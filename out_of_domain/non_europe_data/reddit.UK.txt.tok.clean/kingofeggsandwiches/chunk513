  the problem is n't lane splitting , it 's doing it at 90mph . 
  if you 're going fast you should overtake like a car would , in a trafficky situation you should n't be going much faster than the cars you 're overtaking . 
  if the cars are stationary then you should be going no faster than a bicycle would . 
  look for the shitty house with its windows completely black out that feels warm to the touch . 
  i hear it 's common for serious growers to move around a lot , rent something in a crappy desolate street in a fake name , seal everything so the house is virtually air tight , keep the place looking like nobody has moved in , do a single huge grow and then move onto the next place . 
  i understand why these sentences are grammatically ambiguous . 
  i 'm still at a loss as to how `` when is chair the chair the red thing ? '', 
  is grammatical . 
   the cotton shirts are made from, 
  this is fine , it 's confusing because `` the cotton shirts '' is understood as a complex subject of a single clause , and because english always `` that '' to be dropped when it is n't used as a relative pronoun , and because english does n't insist on commas to demarcate clauses , there 's nothing to show that it should n't be read that way . 
  really it 's `` the cotton that shirts are made of '' , that 's fine . 
  i 'm at a loss regarding the chair one though . 
  that seems desperate given that if the police find out you 're squatting they 're liable to come check up on you . 
  better to just rent in a shitty neighbourhood where people mind their own business , keep the place looking grey and uninteresting . 
  these places are also targets for other criminals too as well . 
  seems to me to either need `` chair the chair '' treating the phrase in inverted commas like a noun , or we need chair the chair , as if the chair were named chair , similar to something like brian the gardener . 
  does n't seem like a real garden path sentence to me anyway , seems more like the famous `` tom while john had had had had had had had so tom won . 
  '' , which should really be `` tom , while james had had `` had '' , had had `` had had '' , so tom won . '', 
  in aldi you can get `` english bacon '' , sadly it 's not very authentic , the cut is wrong , it 's just the back without the fatty bit , more like canadian bacon , and it 's way way too thin and salty . 
  i 've never seen proper english style sausages in germany , they have a very different type of skin and the contents tend to be ground more finely . 
  you get a real textured experience with a proper british sausage . 
  if you cut into a british sausage you should see something [ like this ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_8usc80rhqdo/s0h9jdoipii/aaaaaaaaabq/la6b5qmld90/s400/4+-+bowers+traditional+norfolk+pork+sliced.jpg ) . 
  it 's generally coarser , and when you cook it the skin should wrinkle up [ like this ] ( http://i2.wp.com/www.loverofcreatingflavours.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/sausage-on-a-fork.jpg ) . 
  the closest i see in german supermarkets is just your typical german rostbratwurst , but it 's not the same . 
  not lean as possible , that would be bordering into canadian bacon territory , and unfortunately that 's often sold under the name english bacon in europe leaving them believing that 's what we eat . 
  sadly his thought did n't make the cut . 
  maybe it 's like `` an historic '' , never heard it before though . 
  go easy though , whoever wrote the title could not be a native english speaker . 
  i got some level 3s and it 's just beautiful . 
  i 'm not heavily aggressive any more but have been rolling an antirockered set up . 
  with these new wheels i 'm free to go almost anywhere , which is great . 
  i would definitely say `` an historic '' , it runs together nicely in elided speech , which is why it 's a pattern that 's survived from the days when all french derived h words were pronounced without the h being sounded and therefore took `` an '' over `` a '' . 
  `` you guys are aahsome , good jaab '', 
  does it get more american than this ? 
  blue passports !, 
  no , but those choice of words definitely are . 
  british would probably say `` that was bloody brilliant , nice one ! '', 
  it 's certainly similar in the sense that the rural areas that vote labour in the uk tend towards being poorer and places where industry has declined . 
  careful saying `` far right '' . 
  csu is a centre-right party imo . 
  far right tends to imply radical right wing thought . 
  seems about right to me . 
  there are some exceptions like inner city birmingham of course . 
  the problem as i see it though is that the midlands on the whole is very anti-progressive thinking for the most part . 
  it 's the homeland for people who think `` political correctness has gone mad '' and are sick of brussel 's bloody healthy and safety . 
  now lots of the people who think this are n't that well to do economically , and can be lured towards labour when they think it 's in their interest to do so , but they 're not ideologically pro labour . 
  the alt-right wing has really played off this segment of society very well , turning possible labour voters into ukip and conservative voters , with powerful simplistic rhetoric . 
  meanwhile the labour party has been portrayed as effete ineffectual and prioritising minorities ' interests over those of ordinary working class britons . 
  the high moraled labour policies towards multiculturalism and other issues do work to get the cosmopolitan city dwelling progressives on side , but it does n't fly with the typical middle england demographics . 
  the north has also seen surges of right wing support compared to recent decades , and really it 's only the legacy of left wing ideology that means they 're more left leaning than the midlands . 
  what the fuck are you talking about ? 
  it 's not `` incorrect english '' , it 's literally written into books on grammar as a common expression and an accepted usage . 
  it was n't that long ago that `` a historic '' was considered wrong in british english . 
   now that were in an english speaking country , you should follow the rules of the language , and one of those rules is that h makes a distinct sound and there 's no need to help it with the n from an to be more understood . 
  perhaps you should follow your own advice and actually use rules such as putting an apostrophe in the word `` we 're '' and capitalising the start of sentences ? 
  you do n't seem to be understanding anything i 've said . 
  i 'm not upset , what you 're saying is annoying because it completely misses the point over and over again . 
  i 'll try to be very clear this time . 
  the original poster said `` an hilarious '' , all i said is do n't give him a hard time , which you have n't so i do n't see why that is being brought up . 
  my other point was that `` an historic '' / `` an historical '' is actually 100 % correct english according to many style guides . 
   and i hope you realize that when you say `` it was n't that long ago it wasnt accepted '' your also saying that it is accepted now . 
  yes , i 'm saying that `` an historic '' used to be the only accepted form , and that these days both `` an historic '' and `` a historic '' are accepted as correct forms . 
   why would it change ? 
  maybe because people realize that the h is there for a reason and they 're no need to add in the extra letter n, 
  it changed because languages change all the time , they never stop changing . 
  lots of what people say today would have been considered ungrammatical 100 years ago . 
  for example , in the 19th century pronouncing the - h in words like hotel , historic , historical and so forth would have been as incorrect and uneducated sounding as pronouncing the - h in words like hour and honour . 
   unless you only want to make it sound `` cool '' or british or something . 
  or they might do it because , you know , their parents did it , their neighbours did it , their grandparents did it . 
  people do n't choose what to say because it 's `` cool '' , they just learn to speak from the people around them . 
  oh and fyi , i am british , so i do n't need to try to `` sound british '' , whatever that means . 
   do you think i slighted then for the simple correction ? 
  i do n't understand . 
  you do n't seem to get it , `` an historic '' is not wrong , it 's officially correct . 
  as for the guy you corrected way back at the top of this chain i have long since stopped thinking about that . 
   the one he made was almost definitely intentional . 
  people do n't speak like that naturally . 
  yes , they do . 
  if you grow up around london you probably wo n't say the - h at the start of any words , it 's a feature of the accent . 
  if you 're french and speaking english as a 2nd language you may not ever pronounce the letter - h because you 're unable to . 
  both these types of people might naturally put an an before a - h word because for these people the words start with a vowel sound . 
  furthermore , if you 're still learning english , you might see `` an historic '' used correctly in a text book somewhere , and assume the same exception applies to `` an hilarious '' . 
   it 's unnatural , intentionally wrong and goes against the way we were taught to write and speak english ,, 
  i was taught to write and say `` an historic '' . 
  it 's not remotely unnatural . 
   , and is `` accepted '' the same way ebonics is accepted as a language . 
  if you mean that it 's accepted in university dissertations , scholarly journals , and in newspapers , then yes . 
  `` an historic '' is accepted in all these things . 
  however , i do n't remember ever seeing ebonics in any of those things , so i do n't think it 's remotely the same . 
   because it 's popular , and urs hard to stop these things so in order to bring more understanding to those who speak normally ,, 
  i do n't actually know what this sentence means . 
  try writing it grammatically and maybe i 'll understand you . 
   and that is pronouncing the letter h the way it 's suppressed to be , not ignoring it . 
  according to whom ? 
  because like i said , there are books written about grammar that suggest `` an historic '' is correct , and perhaps even more correct than `` a historic '' . 
  you also seem to be highly prescriptive in your mentality towards how people speak . 
  people have accents , that 's part of life , it does n't make them wrong . 
  i mean look at american accents , even newsreaders ca n't say words like mary , marry , merry with different sounds , even newsreaders say caught and cot as if they were pronounced the same , and even newsreaders use the same vowel to say `` f ** a ** ther '' that they use to say `` b ** o ** ther '' . 
  they even make words like patty and paddy sound the same . 
  i guess every single newsreader in that whole damn country ca n't speak english properly .
