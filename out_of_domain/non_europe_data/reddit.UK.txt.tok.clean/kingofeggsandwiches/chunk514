  honestly , i think a lot of the pro multicultural rhetoric is actually more popular with the progressive students and middle classes than many immigrant populations . 
  a lot of the immigrants that are settled here and nationalised do n't want new arrivals taking resources that the nationalised population could be benefiting from . 
  never imply hp sauce is trash tier . 
  - a faithful remainian hp sauce aficionado, 
  yes yes , brexiteers are all egg and sausage bap types , while remainians are all cous cous and houmous . 
  not surprising when the divide is based so much on age , education , and class identity . 
   the greco-egyptian scientist claudius ptolemy referred to the larger island as great britain ( \u03bc\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03b7\u03c2 \u0392\u03c1\u03b5\u03c4\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 - meg\u00e1lis brettanias ) and to ireland as little britain ( \u03bc\u03b9\u03ba\u03c1\u03ae\u03c2 \u0392\u03c1\u03b5\u03c4\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 - mikris brettanias ) in his work almagest ( 147 -- 148 ad ) . 
  seems i was n't entirely wrong . 
  also british isles was widely accepted to mean both great britain and ireland until recent times . 
  damn , even my olympic body match does n't look [ that in shape ] ( https://rws-munition.de/uploads/tx_twrws/rws_daniel-brodmeier_pokal2.jpg ) . 
  it 's a german shooting athlete btw . 
  they probably were n't teleport hackers , by the cata era the farmers had hundreds of accounts that they 'd log out by spawn points . 
  the real hack was what they used to acquire server information that would tell them when and where nodes would spawn . 
  seriously the farmers had access to hundreds of account on each server , all kept active by stolen credit card data . 
  most gold services and account trading platforms had accumulated more accounts than they could sell , so they had to keep them active somehow . 
  what you actually saw was botted players logging in and stealing your node , they were n't teleporting . 
  hacks that messed with what was going on server side were actually banned very efficiently by blizzard . 
  with hundreds of days played i barely saw any proper hackers . 
  once or twice i 'd see a level one flying but that was about it . 
  all the other hacks you 've mentioned are n't really hacks , but exploitation of game mechanics assisted by automation . 
  the only thing that could be considered hacking the retrieval of data from the client and server . 
  edit : apparently teleport hackers are typically invisible in game , under and inside the node , and can move around faster than is possible , so if you witnessed something like that then you saw a real one . 
  real shitty lawyer *, 
  wow that was a blast from the past . 
  there are tonnes of guides online , maybe look at them ? 
  buying a house is n't something you should do on a feeling , that 's how you get those horror stories you hear about . 
  i know people who 've bought flats not knowing how the system of building upkeep for the building 's structure , and had not realised or ignored the fact that major work would be necessary in the next few years , then ended up having to sell up at a noncompetitive price or take equity out of their home to pay the shared repair cost . 
  i 've even know people drop a couple of hundred grand on a luxury holiday `` chalet '' in devon without reading the small print , only to find out that 1 ) they were contractually obliged not to rent the place out when they were n't living there due to the house being part of a closed community 2 ) the house was built using cheap quick methods and poor materials and was never expected to last more than 80 years , it looked outwardly fancy and modern with wall length windows and lots of decking but was mostly a timber build 3 ) they were only leaseholders and the freehold on the land the community was built on was well below the 80 year mark 4 ) they were getting shafted every year in upkeep costs to keep the gated neighbourhood looking pretty , probably in an attempt to convince other rich saps to buy there . 
  all this basically made the property unsalable , at least not at anything like the price they 'd paid , the only people who owned the places were rich idiots who were either taken for a ride by the estate agents or too rich to even care that they were throwing their money away . 
  edit : in case anyone was wondering this was near salcombe so there was a market for rich idiots buying property without really knowing what they were doing . 
  the small wheel size of aggressive skates will always make them feel a bit less responsive . 
  with aggressive skates i always feel like i 'm doing more work to get up , and particularly maintain , speed , and that my turning to done mostly by the direction my feet are facing . 
  with bigger wheels i feel more able to turn with my body weight , which in turn makes for a more responsive experience . 
  also aggressive skates do tend to be heavier , because all the plastic needed to create an adequate surface for grinding , sole plates , royale groove etc. 
  they also tend to be bulkier so they 're more protective , especially hard boots . 
  however , that 's kind of the point of aggressive skates . 
  they 're designed for environments like skateparks where much of your speed comes from ramps , or for situations where only a short burst of speed is needed , such as clearing a set . 
  they make terrible cruising skates , which is why many aggressive skaters i know carry a set of 70-80mm frames and wheels around for travelling to and from spots/parks . 
  that said , there are definitely some perks to rocking a very low frame when it comes to aggressive skating . 
  in some ways you do gain more control i think , because you can really feel the ground under foot , and really know how much friction there is between your wheels and the floor . 
  if you find aggressive skates in a flat set up frustrating i do n't recommend you ever try an anti-rockered set up . 
  it just exaggerates the bumpyness of the ride and the lack of responsiveness . 
  yet cocaine is far more psychologically addictive because of the way it works on the brain . 
  also psychological withdrawal can cause psychosomatic physical withdrawal . 
  for example , someone withdrawing from crack cocaine might feel nauseated and be sick , but only because the psychological withdrawal is convincing them that they feel unwell . 
  likewise they might get the runs , but only because the psychological withdrawal is making them consonantly anxious , which can trigger intestinal activity . 
  honestly , the difference between physical and psychological addiction is n't really as clear as it can seem . 
  all physical addiction means is that there 's some direct mechanism of the drugs , that means when the body is deprived of it suddenly then it will stop functioning as its supposed to in some way or another . 
  from just seeing clips i thought something similar , it was only after i watched an interview with a dev that i realised it was n't a shared universe .

  except this people are joke entrepreneurs who are mostly morons and the whole show is a farce . 
  they have to `` delegate '' as part of the show 's narrative . 
  yes , real life entrepreneurs do have to delegate real tasks , but the tasks the real life entrepreneurs need to delegate are far more complex than the stupid jobs they give each person on the show . 
  in real life book keeping is hard , in the show they literally just need to count up a single stock order . 
  any entrepreneur that needs to delegate a task that simple should probably look for work in industry more suited to their skills . 
  no one that incompetent should be trying to run a business . 
  even though the show 's format requires that the team leader delegate , i ca n't help but hate that woman for mouthing off about she 's `` so shit at costing '' . 
  do you think real entrepreneurs have that attitude ? 
  really it just exposes how childish and stupid the show is . 
  the problem is that dumb people watch it and think this is what the working world should be like . 
  it 's really just annoying having these reality star idiots paraded around as `` business people '' . 
  if you 're going to do it the proper british way , rather than the lazy just use - s for everything way , might as well do right !, 
  so you 're saying a canadian or australian could n't pull it off ? 
  to be fair the `` walmart '' in the uk is n't anything like american walmart and is just more like a regular british supermarket , just one that 's more on the tacky side . 
  you 'd have a hard time making a fort there . 
  you ca n't really call someone who comes from an age where belief in spirits is accepted ignorant . 
  similarly , the people who believe in this stuff in communities where everyone does are n't really ignorant , it 's more that the community is ignorant as a whole , which is actually of product of lack of education . 
  yeah , a commercial that has entertainment value , so more of a sponsored video . 
  i see no problem with that so why you bitching about it ? 
  `` special '' relationship . 
  the conclusion of scepticism is n't that the chair does n't exist though , it 's that we do n't know if it exists or not . 
  i 'm pretty confident there are websites where you can just paste your work and it will spell check it for you in whichever language you select . 
  nice , are you a skater in cologne ? 
  acceptable to whom . 
  by your definition every generation holds prior generations to be `` ignorant '', 
  you 're definitely closer to it than the uk . 
  in germany i often see cars crossing pedestrian crossings while the green man is showing , there are signs that allow this provided the cars give way to the foot traffic . 
  in the uk this is n't allowed , meaning any filters that allow `` right turning '' ( which would be left turning in the uk ) , can only be active when the pedestrian crossing is showing the red man . 
  this means longer waits junctions , and might be a factor in why we have so many roundabouts . 
  there is a major difference between eu countries though . 
  for example in the uk if you get the filter light ( green arrow on the side of the traffic light ) it means you have right of way , so you 're not looking out for cars . 
  a filter light in the uk also means that pedestrian crossing are showing the red man , so you 're not really giving way to foot traffic either ( although technically in the uk law the is that you must always give way to pedestrians ) . 
  these things mean there 's no just thing a permanently switched on filter in the uk . 
  if you do need to give way in the uk it will typically be marked by double barred lines , sometimes it says `` give way '' written on the ground with an upside down triangle shape . 
  junctions where left turning traffic is constantly safe to filter ( which would be right turning if you drove on the right ) , will typically have a separate lane for doing so [ as shown here ] ( http://www.sabre-roads.org.uk/wiki/images/4/45/left_turn_filter_lane_-_coppermine_-_9473.jpg ), 
  i think europe is split between those countries that do it the british way and those countries that do it the german way . 
  in germany you can be filtering but also giving way to people crossing a pedestrian crossing that is showing green , so you have to be much more careful when you filter . 
  that 's the real story . 
  basically , the dursley family were being targeted by a bunch of weirdos in a cult because the cult had decided that their adoptive son , who they were highly abusive to , was their messiah . 
  due to the years of living in a poorly ventilated cupboard , their adoptive son harry was prone to mental health problems such as hallucinogenic mania , which convinced him he could do impossible things like talk to snakes . 
  the cult kept trying to lure harry away from the family by sending fake offers of school places . 
  the dursley family panicked and went into hiding , but were found by one of the more senior members of the cult , a giant guy called hagrid , who the cult often used for jobs requiring physical intimidation . 
  hagrid convinced harry that there was a magical school he could go to , which was really a compound in scotland which the cult operated from . 
  hagrid told harry to go to king 's cross station at a certain time , the dursleys , out of fear for their own safety , just let him go . 
  the cult intended to pick harry up at the station and take him to the compound . 
  sadly harry was hit by a train while wandering blindly around king 's cross mumbling something about an alleged platform 9\u00a03/4 before they could reach him . 
  the impact caused major damage to harry 's brain meaning he 's on constant life support and entirely unresponsive . 
  everything that follows is a coma dream harry 's mind created to stop him from going entirely insane .
