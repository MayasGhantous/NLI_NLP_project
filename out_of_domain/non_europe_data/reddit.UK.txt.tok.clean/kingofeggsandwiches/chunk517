  australia was widely colonised by native english speakers ( albeit a diverse group of them ) 2 . 
  australia was n't that cut off britain , while it was geographically cut off , it remained part of the empire with a strong british identity ( read up on the 10 pound poms if you do n't know about this ) , by the time australia became independent we already had a lot of technology that allowed communication to continue e.g television . 
  australia 's population was n't so large as to mean it cast off its old identity and embraced its new one without any elements of conservatism , nor was it so small as for it to be considered a backwater and have limited contact 4 . 
  finally the settling of australia did n't happen so long ago as to give it enough time to diverge more than it has done ( somewhat of a truism ) , and although settlement started a long time ago , australia saw a large influx of settlers in the 19th and 20th centuries , meaning there was a constant flow of speakers from community of speakers it was diverging from showing up and reinforcing the linguistic traits belonging to that community 's dialects . 
  realistically , to answer this question all we can do is look at factors that play a role in linguistic divergence generally , and try to see how australia fits them . 
  we ca n't really know why australia diverged the way it did , or even tell you if the divergence of australia has been fast or slow . 
  all we can say is divergence may have been greater if x or lesser if y. 
  well it just goes to show that people like different things , so your opinion is merely an opinion . 
  i personally did n't hate gof or hbp as films . 
  i thought the weakest was part 1 , with very little cool or interesting happen but a whole lot of drama over nothing . 
  the deathly hallows book was far better than the film , but especially part 1 . 
  i just meant that we have differing opinions . 
  coarify that !, 
  post deleted . 
  honestly if that accent was n't so hilariously bad he might not have been to memorable to british audiences at least . 
  it may well have helped his career . 
  it was a comic role and he did a comic accent , worked out quite well . 
  surprised nobody has linked [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfsvdz4t7vk ) . 
  they could be best buddies . 
  my point from the start was that on averages nations differ , but individuals can be indistinguishable . 
  i ca n't tell who is polish in the uk , and the people who think they can are delusion . 
  nor can i tell who is german and who is scottish . 
  it just does n't work that way . 
  you are vastly overestimating your ability to distinguish someone as foreign using faulty logic based on hindsight . 
  whatever mate , you think you 're some kind of special nationality recogniser . 
  i reckon if you dropped most macedonians in the uk had him speaking perfect regional english without the tan or the culture influences of macedonia he would n't stand out at all . 
  at points it 's like he 's not even trying , at other times there are comically exaggerated cockney linguistic traits . 
  short answer is because it 's negative . 
  ** never ** * have i * seen such behaviour !, 
  at ** no ** point * did i * find it amusing !, 
  and so on . 
  english occasionally does this for other stuff :, 
  rarely * have i * seen such talent . 
  now * is the winter * of our discontent . 
  so great * was the impact * on their minds , many went mad . 
  i play violin , as * do all my friends *, 
  he likes ponies and so * do i *, 
  nothing like that . 
  very few people dislike people because they are ethnically roma , just as very few people dislike from people because they are ethnically black . 
  the people who do are racists . 
  saying , i generally avoid gypsies is no different from saying i stay away from very poor people in the lowest tiers of society . 
  it 's just a fact of life that people do that . 
  when you see people with shabby clothes living in the projects talking all ghetto you generally avoid interaction , does n't matter if they 're black , white , or latino . 
  you can call this classist but everyone does it to some degree . 
  and for good reason , everyone knows that if you hang around with a bunch of unemployed , broke , low-education people who embrace a certain `` street culture '' you 're more likely to a victim of crime and 2 . they probably wo n't accept you if you 're not like them in culture and circumstance . 
  you can be nice invite those feral street kids around for a drink , but do n't be surprised when the next day you find you games console missing or the money in your wallet has disappeared . 
  i 'm sick of people failing to demarcate the difference between culture , ethnicity , and behaviour . 
  it 's wrong to dislike or avoids someone for being ethnically a traveller , it 's wrong to dislike someone for living in in caravan ( that is culture ) , it is n't wrong to dislike someone when they break the law and treat women , children , and animals poorly , behaviours that are rife within travelling communities . 
  in an ideal world every individual would be judged on their merits , but sadly we have to make some assumptions based on imperfect evidence . 
  when people say gypsies or travellers , they do n't mean an ethnicity or a cultural way of life , they mean people living in the gypsy community where poor moral standards are common . 
  to make a comparison with muslims , it 's wrong to dislike muslims just because some of them behave in a certain way way . 
  disliking someone for being ethnically muslim is wrong , disliking someone for going to mosque is wrong ( culture ) , but disliking terrorists is just fine . 
  people 's inability to distinguish between behaviour and identity leads to so much dumb stuff being said by racists and anti-racists alike . 
  disliking terrorist should not be synonymous with disliking muslims , and disliking those gypsy communities that are prevalent in your country should not be synonymous with disliking anyone with a traveller heritage or a roma ethnic background . 
  it 's very hypocritical when people from countries where there are no or very few travelling communities to point the finger at those who express disdain for such communities , all the while never having experienced them first hand . 
  but when you see the children out shoplifting on a school day , the scams being pulled on tourists and vulnerable people , the feral unkempt packs of dogs who 've never seen a vet roaming around the sites , you ca n't help but feel there is something very wrong with those communities . 
  this such a disposable culture mentality . 
  truth is , we no longer learn to maintain thing because we no longer buy things to last , once it break you chuck it out and by a new one . 
  furthermore people are discouraged from maintaining stuff themselves , because it creates an industry in replacement and repairs . 
  tonnes of stuff you buy these days is designed to be deliberately hard to repair . 
  mechanisms are sealed in hard plastic casing with non standard screw to stop you doing something as simple as replacing dead battery cell . 
  casing is plastered with stickers saying `` danger : live electric may be present '' , and `` warranty invalid if opened '' . 
  at lot of this `` protection '' is under the guise of liability , companies saying they do n't want to be sued if someone messes with their product , however , it also benefits them financially . 
  you simply never hear of a plug breaking because you rarely keep an electrical item long enough for the plug to break before you get a new one in . 
  we should be taking the power back from corporations by making practical education like this mandatory . 
  everyone should be learning to take apart electronics in school , maintain a car to a basic level , take a part a sink and so on . 
  you can learn this stuff when you 're 12 years old and never have to learn it again . 
  however , we do n't because it does n't make anyone richer when ordinary people can rely on themselves rather than repair services and manufacturers . 
  i think its admirable that this knowledge was taught in the uk for so long . 
  that 's a design failure of the splitter , not the plug . 
  you have n't understood the video at all have you . 
  eu plug has not got a ground wire , the eu plug does not automatically run to ground if the wire becomes frayed . 
  electrical fires are still more common in the eu countries that use that plug than in the uk/ireland where the british plug is used . 
  it 's just an elaborate ruse to piss off mainland chinese people . 
  wow , do n't get so personally insulted . 
  i mean `` you '' as in colloquial sense of the term , using it to mean the impersonal 3rd person . 
  `` one never hears of a plug breaking because one rarely keeps an electrical item long enough for the plug to break before one gets a new one . '', 
  [ this is what you sound like ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uuoy1huo7m ), 
  plugs do break all the time . 
  things fall off tables and yank the cords , vacuum cleaners and lawn mowers are likely culprits . 
  with time even plug sockets fall apart . 
   but apparently uk is full of idiots that constantly break the plugs or what ? 
  err ... yes the uk is full of serial socket breakers , stop acting like an imbecile . 
  one thing the uk does have though is statistically fewer electrical fires than most other countries in the world . 
  cool story bro . 
  funny , in germany all the sockets are built for the former but all the appliances have the latter . 
  now is an adverbial of time . 
  it 's considered v2 because , even though it can behave like a subject , it still creates unusual inversion . 
  it also happens with adverbials of place , as is `` here comes the bus '' . 
  also in modern english we still readily say things like now is the time . 
  it 's because most places in europe are n't too far from the sea . 
  much of france , belgium , the netherlands , and germany 's goods come in from either antwerp , rotterdam , or hamburg , and then go off in lorries . 
  much of what the uk consumes comes into felixstowe , or goes across the channel in lorries . 
  when you have nice peninsula dense geography like europe , freight trains do n't make much sense for anything except stuff that is too bulky to be sent on lorries . 
  lol , no european governments are saying here 's $ 20k we 're taking the land . 
  most countries pay the market value of the property + a little extra for the inconvenience if your house is going to be demolished for some other purpose . 
  sometimes people with large tracts of land make a killing off government projects such as motorways and railways . 
  also plenty of countries that were n't `` blown to shit '' in ww2 have decent rail networks . 
  the more densely populated bits of the us do n't have trains simply because the impetus is n't there . 
  they 'd have to pay all those people for their land and much of the areas where it 's worth building trains have high property values .
