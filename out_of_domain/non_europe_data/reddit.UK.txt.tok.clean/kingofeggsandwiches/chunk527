  if anything i think that the bbc was too objective . 
  it made leave seem like a much more credible and realistic option than it really was . 
  you can not expect 100 % turn out amongst any demographic . 
  that 2.4 million probably did n't vote because they were ambivalent about it , or did n't really know what to believe amidst the lies and disinformation . 
  it 's perfectly natural for young people to less interested in politics than older demographics . 
  young people turned out in record numbers for the referendum , so no fault lies at their feet . 
  not really . 
  firstly you do n't need extreme population growth , you just have to ensure that every time someone retires there 's a worker or two coming into the workforce to pay tax . 
  furthermore , with sensible investment in housing and public services there 's no reason why this country could n't support a much larger population than it does . 
  the notion that the country is `` full '' has entirely been a product of tory austerity . 
  gp wait lists , lack of public housing , all these issues could 've been eased greatly with proper investment . 
  instead we 've had the tories obsessively trying to reduce the deficit as if the uk were a household budget , despite the fact most economists around the world agree that the benefits of this were few . 
  `` the groaning mess of the eu '' yeah , all those terrible things the eu did like take away our bent bananas and subsidise our minuscule agricultural and fishing industries . 
  is that meant to mean something to me ? 
  that 's clearly not `` football '' . 
  yeah you are right . 
  however , i think many people did n't vote leave because they believed it would be better option for them or for the wider population . 
  i think a lot of the older voters the way they did purely for ideological reasons , and were in a unique position to do so because they know they 're not going to be around for much longer , hoping before they die they can set the uk on a course for a return to the kind of anti-european pro-british culture society they remember from their youth . 
  they simply do n't care about short term and medium term impacts , they are just trying to set the uk on a course towards the kind of isolationist pro-britishness culture they want and think the youth would want too , if they knew better , which of course , being older , they feel they do . 
  do n't know what white has to do with it but brain drain would surely harm the uk 's economy drastically . 
  the reason is because it 's a neuter word . 
  the article or possessive pronoun changes depending on both the gender of the word and the grammatical case it is in . 
  adverbs also have different ending that follow gender and case , but also depend on whether an article or possessive pronoun is present . 
  this is the table for the definite article . 
  possessive pronouns , when functioning like adjectives coming before the noun , rather than in the predicate position , follow the indefinite article - ein, 
  in your example wochenende is singular and in the nominative case ( remember that with forms of `` sein '' your are making a statement of identity rather than an action on something else , so both subject and object are nominative , however this does not apply here because you 're forming a question so naturally the subject is in the nominative ) . 
  since the word here is neuter you can see that `` ein '' without any additional ending to the stem is correct , therefore , since possessive pronouns behave like the indefinite article , dein is correct . 
  you really need to use duolingo in combination with other sources . 
  if you have a lesson on conjugations you should learn that from wikipedia first , and then do the exercises . 
  doing the exercises does help to ingrain what you learn , but it 's a very frustrating way to learn it . 
  oh god that 's exactly how mine looked when i was 12 . 
  scone to rhyme with gone is the posh way . 
  scone to rhyme with cone is the mrs. 
  bouquet middle class with delusions of grandeur way to say it . 
  better take a bath !, 
  why ? 
  it 's regional . 
  except it 's a worker 's lifetime of tax that matters , an average working career is far longer than an average retirement , furthermore , it 's not just the income tax , there 's all the other tax they pay , both direct and indirect , then tax their company pay on the profits that worker assisted them to make and so on . 
  if a greater rate of new workers are coming into the labour force , and there 's enough jobs to keep most of them employed then there must be economic growth occurring ( assuming this is n't at the expense of existing jobs ) . 
  the new money created by that persons efforts will go between the government and the people many times . 
  it 's the economic growth that new workers bring to the economy than increases the governments tax revenue across every form of tax that will raise enough money to pay for the pension . 
  not purely the income tax they pay . 
  all that really matters is that they are economically for a large chunk of their life . 
  hang on , i thought the germans so desperately needed the great british public to keep buying their cars that they 'd roll over and give britain whatever it wanted ?? 
  no thanks . 
  going down with the ship is not something eu supporters should do . 
  especially given how had remain won farage and co would already be calling for a 2nd referendum . 
   if we can survive depression , recession and german bombs we can survive one more bad economic decision, 
  god that 's a stupid thing to say . 
  do you really want to see the uk regressing ? 
  falling behind the global curve of quality of life improvement ? 
  inflict hardship on a large segment of the populace ? 
  of course the uk can survive it , you could probably survive a round in the ring with a professional boxer , does n't mean it 's a fucking good idea does it . 
  lol telling me to fuck off is stupid . 
  what i 'm telling you is well recorded to be true . 
  it 's a fact that upper class people have always historically said scone to rhyme with gone . 
  the poet john betjeman even made a poem parodying the upwardly grasping middle classes that makes fun of the pronunciation that rhymes with stone , and a quick look at nancy mitford 's noblesse oblige , a basic guide to the habits of british aristocracy , will tell you the same . 
   phone for the fish knives , norman, 
  as cook is a little unnerved ;, 
  you kiddies have crumpled the serviettes, 
  and i must have things daintily served . 
   are the requisites all in the toilet ? 
  the frills round the cutlets can wait, 
  till the girl has replenished the cruets, 
  and switched on the logs in the grate . 
   it 's ever so close in the lounge dear ,, 
  but the vestibule 's comfy for tea, 
  and howard is riding on horseback, 
  so do come and take some with me, 
   now here is a fork for your pastries, 
  and do use the couch for your feet ;, 
  i know that i wanted to ask you -, 
  is trifle sufficient for sweet ? 
   milk and then just as it comes dear ? 
  i 'm afraid the preserve 's full of ** stones ** ;, 
  beg pardon , i 'm soiling the doileys, 
  with afternoon tea-cakes and ** scones ** . 
  this poem was written to be as utterly bad taste as possible , featuring multiple faux pas on every line . 
  things like saying serviettes instead of napkins , saying toilet instead of lavatory or loo , saying requisites as a euphemism for toiletries , calling their housemaid `` the girl '' , saying sufficient instead of enough , putting the milk in first , and most importantly , rhyming scones with stones . 
  saying scone to rhyme with stone is n't posh , it 's mrs bouquet-esque pseudo-posh that caught on with the chattering middle classes . 
  edit : downvoters i 'm sorry you do n't like facts ... 
  it 's pronounced `` bou-quet !, 
  only edgey teens and mouth breathers say `` mongoloid '' . 
  cheeky slag would be meant jokingly if said with the right tone , but if said without said tone then it would be very insulting . 
  cheeky is a very versatile word , `` he 's a cheeky chappy '' means someone who is irreverent in a fun and amicable kind of way , `` cheeky pint '' or `` cheeky nandos '' implies that that you did something that you were n't supposed to ( cheeky pint during your lunch break ) or you feel you should n't really have done ( cheeky kebab on the way back from the gym ) . 
  however in a more serious or aggressive context it could imply that someone takes seriously liberties and you dislike them e.g `` that kid 's a cheeky fuck , i want to smash his head in '' . 
  retardish ? 
  i do n't think that 's a word . 
  you do fit into both . 
  and get a load of that anger , you must have some serious personal issues . 
  those undemocratic bastards for wanting bilateral agreements that work both ways . 
  i 'm pretty sure they can do a spell to purify water . 
  it seems to be lacking some post-production i think . 
  i think around 0.38 what you 're seeing there is one single shot of the scene , when it was probably shot from multiple angles , and had it made he cut then these multiple shots would 've been edited together to make the actual scene . 
  there are points , for example when snape notices the presence of people in the carriage , when he closes the door , and when he backs away from karkaroff , where the actors do n't even look like they 're trying and it almost looks comical , you ca n't even really see what 's happening at these points , these are all moments that would normally invoke a cut to a different perspective or closer , to show a reaction , or to make a movement look natural . 
  instead , because it was n't used , they 've just taken the best shot of the scene of the lot and called it a deleted scene . 
  they probably decided not to use the scene halfway through the editing process . 
  there 's no way that that natural movement when snape backs away and lifts his arm would make the final cut of a big budget film for example . 
  point is the scene might look badly shot and acted , but with a bit of editing magic it could be made to look just fine . 
  that would be insanely expensive .
