  the problem arises when most of a group wants to share , while a few do not , and feel socially pressured to share . 
  they might feel rude saying that `` no i want my own meal '' . 
  what you 're describing sounds more chinese culture being adverse to not sharing food . 
  if you went to china and said , i do n't want to share i want to buy my own meal and eat it , that would be weird . 
  that expectation is n't just limited to tapas restaurants or whatever , where sharing is the norm , but to all restaurants , because sharing is a ubiquitous cultural norm in china . 
  point is that the british problems twitter account is just scrapping the bottom of the barrel because it 's run out of content to steal from the subreddit . 
  british people are n't universally against sharing food , but are amenable to sharing when they feel it 's appropriate or desirable , it 's just that people might differ in their judgement of which contexts this is appropriate in . 
  people here are just making generalisations . 
  british people share food quite a lot , like i said it depends on context . 
  it makes perfect sense . 
  chinese culture does n't have many context where not sharing is normal . 
  in the uk we have both contexts where it 's normal , and context where it is n't . 
  british people just like to grumble at stuff and play up their anti-social side , which is what you 're seeing here . 
  the thing is , how difficult it is for a foreigner to learn a language generally is n't a factor in language formation . 
  by their adolescence the average german speaker is easily able to remember that it 's `` das nashorn '' but `` der bus '' , so even linguistic features that only have minor or contextual benefit ( e.g when the nouns have different genders ) will tend to be preserved . 
  the only time 2nd language speakers get to influence a language is when there is a large and sudden increase of them amongst a community of language speakers , especially if those newly arrived 2nd language speakers are in a culturally dominant position . 
  as what happened with english with both the vikings and the normans . 
  gender is just one of things that tends only confers minor advantages at a huge cost to language learners , but sadly language learners do n't help shape a language particularly under normal circumstances . 
  no , it 's the third biggest economy . 
  the referendum result saw an end to that 2nd biggest title . 
  the uk makes up less than 10 % of the business of most eu countries , it 'll be much grimmer for the uk than the rest of europe if the uk does n't start cooperating .

  i will tell you some hard truths . 
  not drinking is n't what might negatively impact your social life . 
  not wanting to be in situations where people are drinking because either you do n't enjoy them , or you find them impossible to enjoy while sober , will . 
  if you think you can enjoy yourself while being around friends that a drinking in places where most people drink a lot then there 's literally no reason for you social life to be affected by your choosing not to drink . 
  if the idea of spending an evening around people in pubs and nightclubs while sober bores the pants off you , then i suggest you look for similar non-drinkers to socialise with most the time , as unfortunately so much of uni life revolves around `` going out '' to places where alcohol is consumed . 
  i 've known non-drinkers that actively enjoy staying out until the early hours with drinkers , and i 've known non-drinkers for whom that prospect is wearisome . 
  you will have to decide which kind you are and act accordingly . 
  ultimately very few people will exclude you just for not drinking , and if they do they 're probably not worth your time ( although you might get the occasional joke directed at you , i 'd recommend taking it in good humour unless someone is really getting at you ) . 
  however , if you do n't participate in the fun when everyone else is drinking , look bored , or leave early , people will stop inviting you out to drinking events because they 'll assume you do n't want to be there . 
  it entirely depends on what kind of non-drinker you are . 
  you definitely have the right idea getting to know as many people as you can . 
  my one regret at university was sticking with too narrow a group of friends . 
  by the time i was in third year the 10-12 people in my social group had mostly lost interest in one another , some had found bfs/gfs and stopped going out as much , and everyone was super focussed on finals and coursework , so there was n't much opportunity to meet new people or expand my existing network . 
  my number one tip for university , regardless of whether you drink , is to cast a very wide social net in your first year , as this is an ideal time to get to know people . 
  people who are `` always '' around in the first year tend to steadily drop off , and be more socially selective as the time constraints on socialising become more intense during 2nd and 3rd year . 
  i do n't want to overstep my mark but i wondered if you 'd tried therapy ? 
  universities often offer such services . 
  learning to become comfortable with moderate alcohol consumption might be part of the healing process the result of a traumatic event . 
  that data is outdated , simple as that . 
  economic forecasts now put uk gdp per capita ( nominal ) below that of france . 
   the uk makes up 16 % of the eu 's exports . 
  that makes it the eus biggest export market, 
  16 % across the eu but for many of the countries it 's less than 10 % , and any one of those countries has the power to veto a uk trade deal . 
   unless your talking about businesses that rely on the uk ? 
  in which case between 5 % and 8 % of british businesses trade with eu , so it is also `` less than 10 % '' . 
  you 're being completely intellectually dishonest here , at you that desperate to convince yourself that brexit is n't a harmful idea ? 
  we are talking about percentage of exports , not percentage of businesses . 
  the eu makes up 44 % of the uk 's export markets . 
  16 % vs 44 % , you tell me who has more to lose from brexit ? 
   that 's not how gdp works . 
  you ca n't just play with the exchange rate like that, 
  actually that 's exactly how nominal gdp works . 
  it is defined by the value relative to exchange rates , not in terms of ppp . 
   all the calculations that go into figuring out last years gdp have to be done at the same time , and that includes adjusting for exchange rate . 
  yes , when more time has passed and end of year figures come in we 'll have a more accurate picture . 
  i 'm not denying that . 
   looking at our growth forecasts for the rest of the year , it 's almost certain that we 'll still beat france . 
  nobody knows that . 
  we 'll have to wait for the hard data . 
  however , it 's certainly not impossible . 
  we also do n't know what impacts britain will suffer longer term , so there 's still plenty of time for recession to hit . 
   i applied/self-referred to two places in lincolnshire and they both denied me over the phone before getting an appointment or anything . 
   my gp has a waiting list of 6-9 months per appointment ( which i 'm pretty sure lasts 10 mins tops ) and he has no concerns whatsoever over my mental health . 
  bear in mind that the appointment system with gps is completely redundant , as everyone with a cold or a cough gets an emergency appointment , which in turn forces everyone else to to . 
  you really need to be insistent in the nhs or you 'll get fobbed off sadly . 
   i 'm going to try to get in with the people at uni who handle that stuff but i do n't see it working out/have kinda already lost hope from past experience . 
  universities tend to have more resources for these things , i know a number of people that had good experiences with them . 
  that 's not what i 'm saying remotely . 
  those outdated figures do n't change because of what happens now , they are just a snapshot at a certain point in time . 
  however , nominal gdp is affected by changes in currency value , so we have strong reasons to believe the uk 's nominal gdp has decreased and the next time the data is collected we will be considerably lower than where we were at the start of 2016 . 
  the only one sounding idiotic is you , wildly misinterpreting what i 'm saying and trying to indirectly deny that nominal gdp is tied to the currency exchange rates . 
  nominal gdp has everything to do with currency exchange , so the idea that the uk 's nominal gdp did n't decrease with the referendum result and resultant drop in the pound , is absurd . 
  i really do n't think it 's pointless when there are leading economists predicting the uk falling behind france economically . 
  the only other factor in nominal gdp is the growth ( or lack of growth ) in the uk 's gdp for the year 2016 ( this of course consists of many factors but they all add up to the same thing ) . 
  i think expecting growth rates to compensate for a 10 % drop in currency value is a bit unrealistic . 
   and from a law dictionary , `` the inclusion of one is the exclusion of all others '' means that the above definition of an `` accident '' is an intentional collision . 
  that 's absolutely not what it means . 
  if i say `` an accident is defined as i ) an intentional collision ii ) a collision arising from negligence iii ) a collision arising from unforeseeable mitigating circumstances '' that does not mean it must be i ) , it merely means that whichever definition it falls under then it is considered to be that thing at the exclusion of the other options . 
  simply put that in law an accident can not be both intention and due to negligence , it is either intentional or it is negligent or it is due to unforeseeable circumstances , it can not be more than one of these things . 
  if a lay person said to a judge that `` he had an accident '' , he would then seek to ascertain which definition of `` accident '' this event falls under . 
  he would n't assume a layperson meant any specific legal definition of accident , so even in some crazy world `` accident '' was legally defined solely as intentional , it still would n't be interpreted as meaning that when an ordinary person said it . 
  part of a judges job is interpret what laypeople actually mean , they 're not there to trap them with unintuitive legal definitions . 
  sure legal language can be unintuitive , that 's just one more thing keeping lawyers in the job , but it would be very odd for it to carry the exact opposite meaning of its everyday use . 
  it may well be . 
  i ca n't tell you how the economy will behave , if i could i 'd be much richer than i am . 
  if brexit negotiations are n't going well and it looks like we 're losing passporting we could see another drop in sterling . 
  even if we do n't drop past france we 're going to be comfortably closer than we were at the start of 2016 , and longer term trends could see them overtaking us . 
  i 'll also add that we 're already behind france in gdp per capita ( ppp ) , and i expect the uk 's purchasing power has already dropped with the currency , and we 'll see the effects of this gradually over the next or so as sterling contracts expire and supply chains catch up with customers . 
  it 's quite a common name in the uk at least , and much of europe afaik . 
  i am looking at the gdp per capita ( ppp ) figures , not the national figure . 
  2015 imf has france ahead . 
  even if the uk has a bigger gdp and fewer people , cheaper access to equivalent goods and services can account for this . 
  sure,
