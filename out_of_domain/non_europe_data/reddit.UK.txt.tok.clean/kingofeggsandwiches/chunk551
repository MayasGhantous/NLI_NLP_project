  bear in mind that the report is from spring . 
  you have to take into account the methodology of the data analysis if you really want to know . 
  are your units in `` current international dollars '' ? 
  also bear in mind that for the year 2015 imf has the uk 's nominal gdp at 43,771 while the french were at 37,675 , so despite that difference in nominal currency value the french still managed to have a greater per capita mean average purchasing power than the british . 
  the uk just has lower purchasing power than france , being less connected to numerous large economies has its drawbacks . 
  a 10 % drop in currency exchange will certainly mean a similar drop in the gdp ( ppp ) , especially with the uk running an export deficit . 
  a big problem i foresee is that so much of the uk 's exports are in services , services that benefit from trade agreements . 
  services are very easy to move abroad since you just need to move people and skills to one place and recruit any skills you lack . 
  many of the uk 's biggest earners are exporters who are n't tied down like industry is . 
  this could really increase this deficit , resulting in the uk 's purchasing power dropping heavily , which will hurt the material conditions of every british person . 
  imf might use population statistics based on hard data , while you might be looking at statistics based on projected growth . 
  ultimately , if one thing is clear it 's that in both 2015 and 2016 the imf the uk and france as very close in terms of gdp per capita ( ppp adjusted ) . 
  i think it 's fair to say that an approximate 10 % drop in sterling 's value is undoubtedly going to hurt both the uk 's gdp per capita ( nominal ) , even if we account for growth , even if it does n't drop it so far as to bring it below france in the next set of figures , and the uk 's gdp per capita ( ppp adjusted ), 
  i also think there 's a real danger that a knock to uk service exports , and the consequent increase in trade deficit , due to a changing regulatory environment in the face of brexit could really harm the pounds purchasing power , and this could lead to an even greater drop in the international ranking . 
  in this scenario i do n't see britain 's purchasing power improving to pre-brexit level unless the uk is able to negotiate itself into a better global trading than it was in . 
  it 's just common sense ultimately , the uk is an island nation with the associated costs of import . 
  it 's not like the mainland schengen area that has ports supplying many many different countries . 
  the uk 's entire economy revolves around import . 
  even are manufacturing is typically soft manufacturing , buying in parts from other countries and making them into products . 
  the rest is in services which are n't tied down . 
  in many ways we 're a nation of pen pushers . 
  we import raw materials , low skill labour intensive products , foods , and other consumables . 
  we sell high skill products and services . 
  if it starts costing more for us to import , then it will start costing us more to export , our exports will become less competitive globally , and our currency will devalue . 
  it 's funny , but teaching adults you do n't get anyone breathing down your neck , you get left to basically do your thing with only minor checks to see your students are getting what they need . 
  teaching children really does n't appeal to me simply because of the culture . 
  lol , if you believe this to be true then you are a comical human being . 
  that does n't mean they 're doing it on purpose . 
  accents change all the time . 
  for example with scouse , in the days of cilla black and the beatles the word `` square '' would 've rhymed with `` her '' , sounding like `` squrr '' . 
  now it 's moved to a totally different vowel , that sounds a bit closer to `` here '' ( although it 's a different sound ) . 
  why this happened nobody knows , but we do know that fewer young people chose to rhyme `` square '' and `` her '' to the point that it started to seem old fashioned to do so . 
  perhaps it was a greater frequency of conversations between scousers and non-scouse that led to this , we ca n't really know for certain . 
  none of this means that the liverpool accent is affected or deliberate . 
  accents just change with the times . 
  why did brummies stop rhyming `` pass '' with `` parse '' and start rhyming it with `` ass '' in the latter half of the 20th century ? 
  why did aristocrats stop pronouncing `` my '' and `` me '' the same in the early 20th century ? 
  these things just happen . 
  mle is the accent , and it 's ubiquitous over se england amongst the youth and even some areas that lie just outside of it . 
  ali g is playing it up quite extremely of course . 
  yeah , sure , we do consciously change our accents at times , but changes in anyone dialect occur `` on purpose '' . 
  young scousers might be perceived as `` over pronouncing '' their scouse accents , whatever that actually means , but the change in the dialect is not due to conscious efforts on their behalf . 
  a change in register does n't always have to involve changing your accent either . 
  i find it unnerving when someone 's accent changes too noticablely in different environments . 
  when it starts to seem like a deliberate action it starts to seem very inauthentic . 
  sure , many people will glottal their t 's less frequently in front of their boss than they would with their mates down the pub , but people who immediately switches to - th fronting , - h dropping , and opening their - u 's the moment they are around someone with a working class background are fucking nobs . 
  you clearly have some deep seated thing against students that makes you want to rampantly generalise about students . 
  let 's look at some examples :, 
  john owns a small traditional pub between a well known inner city student area and the main campus . 
  during the day they do a carvery + pint deal for # 6 . 
  over half of john 's day time business is students coming in for a quick lunch . 
  john loves students and what they do for his business . 
  brenda owns a live music venue that host small rock bands . 
  over half of her clientele are students , but she does n't find them any worse behaved than the typical rock music crowd she is geared to deal with . 
  students increase her business and student bands help her fill her bar 's schedule with events . 
  brenda loves students too . 
  johnathan owns a very pretentious house music venue in the inner city . 
  they have a strict door policy , rules regarding the ratio of men to women they let in , dress , appearance etc. 
  entry is # 10 , drinks are expensive and upkeeping the lavish setting is expensive . 
  most of the guys that frequent the club are in their late 20s and early 30s , however many of the girls are students looking for a more glamorous experience . 
  johnathan loves students , they help him keep his club 's young and sexy image . 
  brian owns spankies a large but slightly shabby venue in the heart of a student dominated area . 
  to keep profits up brian aggressively markets to students , 2 for 1 offers on vodka redbull , hiring student promoters , free entry before a certain hour . 
  he crams his nightclub full of drunk freshers mostly paying # 6 entry and # 2 more if they 've got a coat . 
  while he depends on students for a living , deep down he fucking hates them , because rarely a day goes by when he does n't deal with teenage girls falling over in heels , people being sick on the dance floor , adolescents fighting in his smoking area . 
  his staff hate them too . 
  tina owns a small nightclub venue on the very edge of the inner city in an area that badly needs some economic rejuvenation . 
  her venue was in very bad state when she took it over . 
  the only way she was able to get enough customers was by opening the venue to host djs of any musical style , including more urban styles such as trap music , hip-hop , and dnb . 
  unfortunately this attracted the attention of some less savoury characters who would probably struggle to get into more established venues in the city centre . 
  her venue is gaining a rep for being an after hours dive for drug users and local disenfranchised urban youths . 
  the police have already issued a warning after few incidents of ambulances having to be called due people collapsing due to drug use . 
  tina desperately wants more students to come to her venue . 
  she would love nothing more than for scores of students with their bank accounts brimming with grant money and parental support to come spend money in her club . 
  it 's pretty clear that all pubs/bars/clubs do not hate students , it depends on their market . 
  it 's also perfectly apparent that students are not the lowest market for all licensed premises , as there are plenty of places that would swap their current clientele for a bunch of idiotic but mostly harmless students in a heartbeat . 
  all you seem to be saying is that the people who choose to work in tacky student marketed venues that cater to the freshers crowd , out in search of the cheapest buzz they can get , really hate students , which is fucking obvious anyway . 
  the idea of universally hating on students though , as if everyone who ever went through higher education is a bad customer , is fucking stupid thing that can only be born of some deep personal resentment against them . 
  snobbery is an amicable vice when it looks upwards i guess . 
  if you 're poshing up your natural accent for a professional environment that calls for it then there 's nowt wrong with that . 
  i 've experienced many natural rp speakers or near-rp speakers who clearly affect a pseudo working class accent when confronted with working class people . 
  it 's like when george osborne gave that speech to the builders . 
  to me it smacks of a patronising attitude that seeks to speak to working class people in their own language as if they would n't understand you if you did n't , or would immediately take a dislike to you if you revealed your true background by the way you speak . 
  i just cringe when i run into school friends who had incredibly middle class upbringings and spoke very standard near rp as children and teenagers who turn up speaking a thick local dialect just a few years later , just because they 're living and working in inner city birmingham now or wherever , and i cringe even harder when someone is carrying a conversation on with me in very rp like english and then turns to the barman and orders `` free points of laagah '' . 
  i do n't agree that pubs hate students at all . 
  i think in a lot of venues that get mixed student / non-student business you 'd probably not be aware of who 's a student and who is n't . 
  in fact i think the majority of businesses that benefit economically from students get absolutely no trouble from them whatsoever . 
  all pubs hate is if they get a reputation with a very specific student crowd , the ones looking to get completely trashed for cheap in an environment that consists almost solely of other students . 
  however , catering to that market can be a way of keeping a pub there where there otherwise would n't be a pub anymore . 
  of course you also get bottom feeders who ruthlessly go after that market and cut costs by neglecting other things , every university has one of these , manchester has sankies , nottingham as stealth , warwick has smack , coventry has kasbar , at least these were the places in my day . 
  and yes , it sucks for the people who work in these venues since they do n't see the profits , but saying all pubs hate students is just dumb . 
  in fact generalising students , as if every student were a 18 year old lad 's lad who tried to make # 10 last the whole night , does n't know his limits , and necks half a bottle of cheap vodka before entering a venue is just stupid too . 
  i 'm pretty sure enslaving members every foreign culture that could n't resist you was pretty hardcore srs . 
  i 'm also certain the people of rome were incredibly obnoxious towards those from other cities , fucking gaulopoors with their commie pagan gods !, 
  well the ancestors of their rulers did at one point buy the title of emperor i believe . 
  still , the english culture saw very little direct influence from the romans . 
  england was an undeveloped backwater when the romans left . 
  even if the dark ages were not so dark , the torch of globally dominant civilisation hardly went directly from the roman to the british empire .
