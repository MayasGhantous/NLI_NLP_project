  westworld is sci-fi , which means that there will be a plausible logical narrative behind it . 
  comparing the symbolism and narrative that takes place in what is clearly a planned controlled environment is just foolish . 
  it 's becoming clear that the endless quest the mib is on is actually an attempt to find some easter egg left in the park by arnold . 
  whoever arnold turns out to be . 
   is n't this just someone reading out how it was written ? 
  first thing . 
  there is no such thing as saying a word `` how it is written '' in english , as there is no strict consensus on what sounds different letters/clusters of letters/morphological forms are meant to be pronounced . 
  the `` dictionary pronunciation '' of a word in british/american/canadian english etc , is defined by use and not by spelling . 
  secondly , there are a number of ways of reconstructing the pronunciation of the past , by analysing poetic rhyme schemes , looking at historical reports , applying a scientific understanding of phonetics , we can build a picture of how people sounded in the past , albeit an imperfect one . 
  wtf are you talking about ? 
  the guy even said most squatters do come quietly . 
  if you know anything about the squatting scene , most of them do leave once given the correct legal mandate that means if they do n't they police will physically remove them from the building . 
  most squatters are just people who , for some reason or another , are exploiting the law to take empty properties as a temporary dwelling . 
  the majority of squatting takes back in non-residential buildings too , as they are more likely to be vacant for long periods of time . 
  who is going to riot ? 
  it 's hardly like the urban youth of today give a shit about brexit . 
  you clearly do n't understand the concept of anonymous . 
  it 's not a club that exists , full of elite hackers , its a banner which attracts like minded people . 
  there is no secret club of which to become a member . 
  anyone can claim to be a member of anonymous , because anonymous is just whoever feels motivated enough to engage in the activities that the current `` anonymous '' zeitgeist supports and want to identify with them . 
  while some wannabe hacking groups do identify with anonymous , it 's not like you have to be in the club to say you 're anonymous . 
  anonymous is by definition simply anyone who can co-opt the `` movement '' sufficiently to their cause . 
  it 's not a simple question because it will all depend on the political realities . 
  when the referendum was more recent many people compared the arrangements that switzerland and norway had for example . 
  the problem however is that the eu wo n't ever allow another swiss agreement to evolve , that agreement developed organically over decades and it 's been a nightmare for the eu throughout its existence . 
  realistically i only see three possibilities in reality , although the details of these are completely up in the air . 
  uk stays in eu, 
  uk leaves eu but stays in single market and customs union , retaining freedom of movement , financial contributions continue to be paid to eu , legal relationship between uk and eu is changed to reduce the quantity of eu legislation is obliged to follow , as only those laws pertinent to single market and customs union membership would be applicable . 
  although in reality this would subsume most eu legislation . 
  uk leaves eu and leaves single market and customs union . 
  uk is on its own to trade with the world . 
  aims to broker a deal that would allow it favourable single market access . 
  in this situation i imagine there would be no trouble brokering an agreement that allowed the free trade of goods ( provided they met domestic market regulations , which means that uk manufacturers would still end up following most eu legislation given that the single market would remain our richest export market ) between the uk and eu , but services would no doubt be subject to a complex regulatory environment , much as how services traded between the uk and the usa are . 
  given that the uk runs a large trade deficit , and something like 80 % of uk exports are classed as services , this situation is less than ideal . 
  there 's no point talking about a norway model or a swiss model , because one thing that is 100 % certain is that the eu would not allow the uk to simply copy exactly what another nation has , but would build a bespoke deal for the uk . 
  do not confuse bespoke with `` better '' though . 
  it 's simple that the uk is an entirely different beast , and it 's in the interest of both sides to develop a custom relationship . 
  lol would n't call k\u00f6lsch a soft language/dialect . 
  good !, 
  in my experience jews are often very intelligent and pragmatic people , hopefully they succeed haha . 
  is it normal to eat salad at bar mizvahs ? 
  i do n't get it , seems like a kind of shitty party meal . 
  if i went to the effort of going to some dumb religious thing i 'd at least hope there would be a hot buffet . 
  because it 's an ex-prison that 's now a hotel you muppet . 
  americans indoctrinate their kids with a love of processed shit early i see . 
  you really need to choose what kind of skates you want . 
  skates is a bit too generic, 
  well first off the majority of anime is watched online anyway , and britons are less used to watching tv with subtitles . 
  that said i think uk culture is a little more adverse to anime generally . 
  certainly when i was growing up anime labelled you as strange . 
  i would watch a bit on toonami but the kids who were into that shit did seemed to be social outcasts . 
  personally i do n't really like anime . 
  there are a few really good more serious classic films , and few good series of it , ones that have genuine artistic merit , but most of it is just culturally unrelatable , repetitive , and formulaic . 
  of the few animes i 've started , the majority i ended up giving up on after a dozenish episodes , as i just stopped caring , often because the story arc seemed to be a pointless indefinitely stretching quest . 
  i also find the `` romance '' , endlessly self torturing unrequited juvenile affection , plus endless trying so hard to be cutesy miscommunication and zaniness . 
  the comedy side of it just seems revolve around this stuff and over the top support characters . 
  even the emotional reactions of the characters often do n't make sense outside if japanese culture , and i have little interest in learning about it . 
  i 've tried a bunch of supposedly classic anime , covering a variety of styles , from more comic , to sci-fi , to realistic , and the majority were a waste of time . 
  personally i ca n't say i think the uk is any worse off for not being a huge place for anime . 
  anyway , it 's not like manga and anime shows have n't been popular in the uk at times , it 's just generally with a children 's audience . 
  i think generally adult britons are bit more liable to view cartoons as for children , and not being able to achieve the kind of real merit as actual television . 
  i do n't disagree with them really , a small amount of anime has some merit but the majority is self indulgent fantasy dross . 
  what are space varying detectives with a robot meant to teach us about our own lives ? 
  it just lacks so much of the human element that is what actually makes narratives interesting . 
  so i guess these jewish kids are well trained bar mitzvah guests, 
  i think intelligent people universally have a less dogmatic way of thinking about the world . 
  an implicit understanding that facts are n't simply `` facts '' , but also depends on how we as people conceive of the world around us . 
  imo dumb people are very attracted by the certainty of various ways of thinking , no just stuff like dogmatic religion ( which is an extreme example ) , but also just with day to day . 
  why does it work this way ? 
  because it does , in an answer that only the more dim witted are satisfied with . 
  clever people relish complexity , stupid people try and banish it from the world to give them a feeling of security . 
  this is exactly why i left the country, 
  looks about as likely as the solar panel roads guys . 
  ** ** \uff21 ** \uff45 ** \uff53 ** \uff54 ** \uff48 ** \uff45 ** \uff54 ** \uff49 ** \uff43 ** **, 
  this is something that has become so apparent . 
  i thought since say , the 80s , this mentality of sheer hatred towards central europe , the perception of them as out to get us , and the deification those who acted against them , had died down . 
  however , it really just simmered amongst the racists ( who claim not to be racist ) , the xenophobes ( who claim not to be xenophobes ) , and much of the traditionalist working classes . 
  a bunch of thicko cunts who ca n't make their economy `` work good '' because half of them are n't to be trusted with a spoon . 
  `` although a solution to the growing illiteracy problem has not been found ... '' ist richtiges englisch . 
  oh where did you go to uni ? 
  err ... in warwick ? 
  so warwick then ? 
  yes, 
  although to be fair warwick is actually in coventry , and oxford has oxford brookes . 
  if someone said to me `` in oxfordshire '' , i 'd be inclined to think it was a brookes student trying to mislead . 
  there 's a scene in the first episode of westworld like this ... 
  '' ... than me '', 
  `` than i. 
  `` i '' is this subject of the 2nd clause '', 
  people like that are always compensating . 
  people who do n't this are n't known for descriptivism . 
  according to prescriptive rules written many years ago , nauseous is wrong , and that 's what they 're pointing out . 
  to a prescriptivist it 's never a `` lost cause '', 
  i 'm so happy ; that you made that clear, 
  when this happens i just locke the computer and walk away . 
  i take some time so i camus things over . 
  sometimes i call my girlfriend and i 'm like `` hegel can we just chat , the facebook philosophers are getting me down '' . 
  before bed i russell up some bacon and then go to sleep . 
  ^ thanks ^ i 'm ^ here ^ all ^ night, 
  you sound very judgemental , in many ways it 's no different from getting your opinions and knowledge from a newspaper or other media source , especially given how unscrupulous journalism is these days .
