  one thing that 's really nice about much of europe is that although taxes are high , it 's very evenly distributed , and everyone is reasonably nice . 
  there 's few hoods and ghettos . 
  very few people are starving hungry or living in constant fear of street violence . 
  i would n't include sk or japan . 
  they 're too vastly different to compare . 
  quality of life is most good there but some of the social practices are unthinkable to anyone who grew up in a liberal western democracy . 
  i agree with the rest though . 
  you forgot ireland , celtic tiger is hardly a bad place to live these days . 
  i 'd put the uk on about the same level as france . 
  better southern and eastern europe but not really as good as those countries who 've consistently put their people first throughout the past 50 years . 
  yes , i agree english is easy to start but hard to master . 
  the syntax becomes very nuanced at higher levels of communication . 
  even c2 students often do n't sound remotely native ( even if they 're completely fluent and you ignore their traces of a foreign accent ) , merely because the way they choose to express themselves is far more rigid . 
  the thing is though is that a simple language is a bit of a misconception . 
  equivalent cultures need to express equivalently nuanced thoughts and ideas , and they must find a means of doing this with the language they have . 
  if they do n't do it with a complex system of cases then they 'll have to do with somehow , whether that be with auxiliary verbs , tenses , syntax , phonetics . 
  so ultimately there 's no way around containing all that possible meaning within the scope of a language . 
  the only simple language imo would be something like a tribal language , a language that has simply never needed to express certain complex ideas so remained a more limited form of communication . 
  i do think some people need to face facts though . 
  tefl teaching is n't naturally a lucrative business . 
  in various parts of the world at various times it has been lucrative purely because of supply and demand , but as in any market these things tend to naturally rebalance themselves . 
  i mean if you think english teachers are badly paid , look at how poorly the teachers of other languages are paid in much of europe . 
  that 's because there simply is n't the demand for italian or french teachers that there is for english teachers . 
  i would n't class france as a southern european economy myself . 
  it 's really quite equivalent to the uk as it stands . 
  i do n't even see britain going below say spain after brexit , that would be quite a considerable drop , and of course it will depend on the metric . 
  however , i do see the uk dropping to a real wealth level equivalent to somewhere like spain if we leave the single market , measured in terms of average purchasing power adjusted earnings per capita . 
  currently we 're about $ 41k per capita , and spain is something like $ 35k , and this would fit a predicted 10-20 % hike in the cost of living across the board that leaving the single market would entail . 
  i think it is a kind of artistic entitlement though . 
  throughout out history artists have produced content in all mediums , and people have been free to hate it , dislike it , be indifferent to it , like it , or love it . 
  a tv series is a piece of artistic content no different from anything . 
  yet with modern tv there 's this attitude that shows existence to pander to their fan base rather than write the stories the writers want to write . 
  this is entitlement , and it ruins shows sometimes when it 's taken too seriously . 
  this attitude of `` i love the show but hated this episode and feel really let down '' are kind of shitty . 
  you take the piece holistically or not at all . 
  when shows just start giving the viewers what they want they start to become predictable and lose artistic integrity . 
  they cease to challenge the viewer and just spoon feed him his favourite thing until he gets sick of it and moves on . 
  sure it could . 
  there 's always other problems . 
  it 's never a matter of that society is perfect and this one is fraught with problems . 
  all societies are fraught with problems , it 's just which problems do you prefer . 
  personally i think the uk has worse problems than many european countries , because of how brutal its culture is becoming . 
  there 's very little sense of british unity , have above average rates of violence , there 's a lack of identity amongst the people that leads to rapid dehumanisation of the other . 
  we 're plagued with a conservatism due to our history that constantly holds us back . 
  i have the strong feeling that brits fear one another more than the european average . 
  anyway , every country has its flaws , i just personally find britain 's to be particularly bad . 
  i mean the us . 
  forgetting about esl teaching right now but just generally . 
  america is what ? 
  320 million people ? 
  that 's a big labour market . 
  yeah i was just pointing out americans have access to a market of 320 million people , britons get access to what 64 million , without the eu britons would actually be worse of getting jobs generally . 
  i only mean , americans should n't feel hard done by , they have access to their own country and very few others do . 
  i mean that if the uk leaves then the british discoveries , which are numerous , would n't be able to bear the eu flag . 
  i dislike what it 's become . 
  i do n't dislike the working class for being working class at all . 
  i hate the culture that has arisen amongst the working class , cynicism , apathy , and a fuck you got mine attitude are becoming the norm . 
  you do realise we do n't have independence of church and state in the uk ? 
  it 's a very american concept . 
  the queen is literally both head of the church and head of the state , does n't get less independent than that . 
  yes , we have freedom of worship , but church and state are the same . 
  germany has plenty of dirty run down parts . 
  anywhere near berlin , hamburg , or the rhine and ruhr areas is super similar to britain in its messy urban and industrial sprawl . 
  germany is only super neat in the rural parts and in bavaria , which is close to austria which is also super clean . 
  to be fair , i still think you 're talking 1 in 1000 at best . 
  the us is hardly brimming with german speakers , there 's just a minority in the mid-west that maintained the tradition of speaking german at home and teaching it to their children . 
  you can spot the yanks in those countries by how all their clothes are a size to big for them . 
  there easiest thing to pickpocket is a zip up hoodie with big pockets on either side of the zip . 
  [ talking about this ] ( http://i3.cpcache.com/product/1222443565/pocket_pugs_zip_hoodie.jpg?width=350&amp;height=350&amp;filters=%5b%7b%22name%22%3a%22crop%22%2c%22value%22%3a%7b%22x%22%3a58.3%2c%22y%22%3a0%2c%22w%22%3a233.3%2c%22h%22%3a280.0%7d%2c%22sequence%22%3a1%7d%2c%7b%22name%22%3a%22background%22%2c%22value%22%3a%22f2f2f2%22%2c%22sequence%22%3a2%7d%5d ) . 
  hoodies without pockets tend to have a single two opening pocket across the gut , these are pretty easy but at least they 're pretty big so you can position stuff in the middle , the big pockets on zip up hoodies are the easiest because they kind of flap out to the side and your wallet wo n't be pressed to your body . 
  i know this because i got pick pocketed that way , these pockets are worthless anywhere dodgy . 
  specially annoying on a cool summer evening when you 're wearing shorts with fuck all pocket real estate and think it 's smart to bring a hoodie along for when the sun goes down and the temperature drops . 
  not with that attitude you ca n't !, 
  and the midlands . 
  i 'm pretty sure it 's a phrase that 's understood across the uk , but it 's come to mean something akin to `` brush someone away with an unsatisfactory bullshit response '' . 
  `` to fob off '' is a common british expression meaning to turn someone away with an unsatisfactory and bullshit reaction . 
  `` the # 20 bag of weed was half a gram too light , but the dealer fobbed me off with some bullshit about brexit raising prices '', 
  point is that 's a difference between freedom of worship and separation of church and state . 
  typically , people talk about separation of church and state in a constitutional context , and constitutionally it 's not something that 's part of britain 's history . 
  freedom of worship has been a huge part of britain 's history going back hundreds of years what with the schism from the catholic church and such . 
  i totally get what you mean , i was just pointing out this nuanced difference . 
  we would n't want to be confused with yanks now would we ? 
  for me they have slightly different uses . 
  intention is more unitary , and in the singular favours usage with either an article or a possessive plural . 
  people use intention when specifying a specific thing someone is planning to do . 
  intent is more simply the noun form of the verb intend , and prefers to go with less specific desires , often when describing the general nature of what someone plans to do . 
  it 's hard to put your finger on it but you 'd say :, 
  `` he acted with no ill intent '' but you probably would n't say `` he acted with no ill intention '' . 
  you might say `` he destroyed the car with malicious intent '' but not `` he destroyed the car with malicious intention '' . 
  in contrast with that `` his intention was to buy a car '' is probably preferred over `` his intent was to buy a car '' in most people 's dialects , although the latter does n't strike me as wrong , just less common . 
  notice how you might say `` he had the intention of buying a car '' , but probably would n't say `` he had the intent of buying a car '' . 
  the latter sounds quite strange to me at least , i 'd never use intent with the genitive like that . 
  intent seems to have a preference for the to-infinitive . 
  `` he has the intent to buy a car '' sounding much better than the previous usage with `` of '' . 
  despite this i think `` he has the intention to buy a car '' is much more common . 
  i have a vague feeling that intent also seems to be favoured with infinitive clauses . 
  `` he went out with the intent to buy a car '', 
  and that the genitive would be preferred if you wanted to use intention . 
  `` he went out with the intention of buying a car '', 
  furthermore we can note that people tend to say :,
