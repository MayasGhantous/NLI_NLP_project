   a lot of people mis-pronounce `` bald '' as `` bold '' , no matter their region/accent . 
  it 's not a `` mispronunciation '' if it occurs consistently in words with shared phonetic and orthographic properties . 
  e.g alderly edge = olderly edge , false = folse . 
  much rather it 's a feature of the accent/dialect . 
   do n't agree . 
  i would sometimes say `` wholly '' to rhyme with `` holy '' . 
  again , saying it outloud , depends on what i am saying . 
  the holy/wholly split is a well documented feature of modern british speech , many nw dialects have resisted it . 
  i 'm not quite sure what you 're agreeing with or not agreeing with frankly . 
  people definitely do pronounce these words differently in much of the uk , due to the rise of the sound / \u0252\u028al / before dark - l in accents in the south of england . 
   this is far more complex . 
  scone pronunciation crosses regional and class boundaries - posh people in one region say `` sc-own '' and `` less educated '' say `` sconn '' , whereas in another region it 'll be the other way around . 
  this was a joke mate , but historically the pronunciation rhyming with `` on '' is the upper class `` u-speak '' pronunciation . 
  [ this is a heat map of the pronunciation ] ( http://www.cam.ac.uk/sites/www.cam.ac.uk/files/scone_rhyme_with_gone.jpg ) . 
   one subtle accent you can sometimes tell is if someone is from east london/essex border . 
  they will often have a very slight essex accent , which you can normally pick up from how they say words like `` water '' ( wortah - w / a dropped ` t ' ) , their `` o '' from `` no '' sound and `` a '' from `` pay '' sounds are also more emphasised . 
  a friend of mine was surprised i could tell she was from that area ( ilford in her case ) - she thought she spoke with a generic south east accent . 
  you 're referring to - t glottalisation and the shifts / \u0259\u028a / \u2192 [ a\u0264\u0308 , \u00e6\u0264\u031d\u0308 , \u0250\u0264\u0308 ] / e\u026a / \u2192 [ \u00e6\u026a ~ a\u026a ] . 
  well known features of se dialects . 
   bristol and somerset have a very specific feature that you can pick up in the mildest of accents . 
  they pronounce `` r '' quite strongly where it would be silent for everyone else ( e.g. 
  when it appears at the end of a word ) . 
  this is called `` rhotic r '' and very specific to the south west region . 
  a bit like a pirate . 
  yes , rhoticism , probably one of the most prominent features of english accents subjectively , i was interested in more in minutiae . 
  everyone else ? 
  that 's a bit of a stretch , there are plenty of rhotic accents outside sw in the uk . 
   finally , one very generic difference that will exist even in the mildest of accents is the `` a '' in grass , bath , glass , path , ask , etc. 
  southerners , in general , will rhyme it with `` cart '' . 
  anyone midlands and north , rhymes it with `` cat '' . 
  as always , there will be exceptions . 
  yes , the trap-bath split , everyone knows about this . 
  again a very prominent feature . 
   i 'm assuming you 're not british - but i 'd say try not to over-analyse accents . 
  you 'd be wrong there . 
   they are fascinating , but it 's a natural ear for them you have to develop over time , rather than trying to shoehorn in specific examples which naturally will always have exceptions that throw you off . 
  no offence mate , but that 's rather condescending , and to me it sounds like you 're the one that needs to work on developing an ear for this stuff . 
  a lot of what you say here is just wrong / r/badlinguistics type stuff . 
  this was really not just meant to be a fun thread asking people what things stick out to them as regional even for speakers who try to speak rp english ( or something like it ) . 
  i tried to keep the technical side out of it because i was curious about what sticks out to ordinary people and not a discussion about phonology . 
  you did n't say where you were from . 
  one/gone suggests you 're not a strict rp speaker ( or at least you did n't grow up in environment dominated by middle class rp speakers in somewhere like say surrey or berkshire ) , tour/paw suggests you 're younger and/or less posh . 
  holy/wholly the same ? 
  that 's quite strange as it would suggest you 're either older and/or northern influenced . 
  you 're wrong about the scone thing though . 
  the north ( and essex ) is where scone = stone is most common . 
  here 's [ a map ] ( http://www.cam.ac.uk/sites/www.cam.ac.uk/files/scone_rhyme_with_gone.jpg ) . 
  yeah there 's are n't universal rules , they 're just general patterns . 
  historically , one was more often pronounced to rhyme with run , but many northern english dialects ( but by no means all ) , rhyme it was gone . 
  red = scone = gone . 
  to me the north is everywhere north of derby :p as you can see the scone = phone people are mostly around the north midlands / south of the north , and essex . 
  never seen that app before , looks good , will check it out . 
  it would sound like `` on '' but with a - w , so won ( but a lot of people pronounce this as `` wun '' so it 's not a good example ) . 
  i would listen out for it it 's very common . 
  in southern british english this is usually the case , but as you go further north you 'll hear one = gone a lot more often , even from well spoken people who do n't sound particularly northern . 
  it 's quite well documented as a linguistic phenomena , remember that yorkshire does n't encompass the whole of the north . 
  lol , well he has to send a tax return if that 's what you mean by `` hell '' , it 's only the very rich who end up paying extra if they retain us citizenship . 
  sadly , in this day and age this is n't even that rare given how expensive housing is within any kind of reasonable commuting distance to london . 
  hell , my own dad was doing this in the 90s and the m40 was n't even built , he was driving m6  m1 and back every day . 
  i walk about 300m to work !, 
  do n't have so much , there sit *, 
  otherwise your english is perfect :p, 
  what on earth 's a barm :p ? 
  do you mean balm ? 
  pff you bavarian noobs . 
  ok but i hope brexiteers realise that they 're imposing this outdated bullshit on hundreds of thousands of very anglicised uk immigrants and hundreds of thousands of british citizens who , like myself , live in an eu country . 
  seems to me like most brexiteers do n't even realise the sheer stress and inconvenience their decision has wrought upon millions of people . 
  currently there is no middle ground between freedom of movement and immigration laws that treat you like the citizen of a 3rd world country trying to sneak into the west under false pretences . 
  i know some sad twats think that this is a fair price that foreigners to pay move to britain , compounded by the fact that most lack the wherewithal to ever contemplate living anywhere more than 20 miles from where they grew up , but it seems like something that has gone complete ignored in the referendum debate . 
  bureaucracy is always shitty if you ask me , but essentially a brexit vote has been a vote for more bureaucracy and not a vote for the free and egalitarian immigration system some delusional fools have been touting . 
  at it 's basis the eu was a remarkable achievement , that overall benefited everyone across the eu universally , it 's a tragic waste that we will be leaving that . 
  that 's fucking bullshit . 
  you 're defending absurdity , and it 's quite ridiculous . 
  after some duration of living here that person should default to being nationalised , that it 's just basic fucking common sense ( that the tough of immigration types arrogantly claim to have a monopoly over ... ) . 
  regardless of whether it be 10 years , 15 years , or 20 years , there should be some limit to this madness . 
  yet the fact that we even question it is evidence that our outmoded immigration model is not adequate to face the reality of post-brexit britain . 
  even the us has jus soli so people born in the us are automatically nationalised . 
  i think you 're being pedantic , when someone complains about bureaucracy they 're not complaining about the staff employed to implement it but the law and policy makers who created the situation . 
   i do not believe the uk is a xenophobic , small minded , inward looking nation . 
  weird because i do . 
  the brexit vote was a vote against all the forward thinking liberalism and multicultural that britain was supposed to represent . 
  you 've got the populist masses turning against what is supposed to be britain 's defining character . 
  i know that leave wo n't actually mean a return to the days of putting british nationals ahead of everyone and protectionism , but you ca n't deny a lot of people who voted brexit thought they were voting for this . 
  this attitude is abhorrent . 
  british passports are n't some kind of gilded `` privilege '' , if someone has lived a significant duration in the uk they are british . 
  nobody who 's lived here their entire life should have the burden of proving that their parents were here legally . 
  are you for real ? 
  have you never seen an 11 line paragraph before ? 
  paragraphs are n't there just to break up text so it looks nicer , they should be used when warranted , and honestly i do n't feel like that comment warranted breaking into paragraphs . 
  i 'm british and living and working the eu not the other way around . 
  i 'm not expecting people to not vote brexit just because it will inconvenience millions of people , but i wish it had been more widely acknowledged . 
  of the brexiteers i meet they 're usually shocked that someone they know may actually be affected by brexit . 
  they 'll say things like `` yeah ... but you 'll be ok right ? '' . 
  well actually no , there 's a real assumption that the `` good immigrants '' will be fine with the brexiteer lot , when in fact there are hell of a lot of `` good immigrants '' who work hard , contribute to the economy of their nation of residence , but are n't in positions that make it possible to get a visa . 
  well you might be able to handle an 11 line paragraph but i think you find they 're not that unusual if you read anything thicker than a newspaper . 
  as for the wherewithal , if you ask me there 's a big correlation between being a brexiteer and being the kind of person who would never even think of living away from their hometown never mind abroad . 
  people who would consider living abroad tend to see the eu freedom of movement as a benefit , whereas those who think their hometown is the centre of the universe see it as a unfair trade because in their mind everyone wants to come to britain but nobody from britain wants to go abroad . 
  i did n't say `` take someone 's word for it '' , but when they can prove they 've lived in the uk over a certain amount of time that should default to nationalisation . 
  this guy has a birth certificate for christ 's sake , he 's lived in britain his whole life , he 's british , why the hell should he have to prove the legal status of his parents decades ago . 
  you can make spurious accusations against my character if you want .
