  frankly this is n't just true of lottery winners but most people generally . 
  plenty of people who 've worked their whole lives amassing wealth end up splurging too much in retirement and only leaving a dwindling portion to the next generation . 
  lots of people are unrealistic about how much they 'll need to see them through til their dying day . 
  it 's human fucking nature . 
  the lottery is only different in that you 're taking a truly random segment of the population rather than the typical person who might make a lot of money . 
  and while the rich might be a tiny bit smarter on average there are plenty of people who are amazing earners and terrible savers/investors . 
  the lottery barely makes a difference . 
  when the lottery winners do fuck up big style though , it 's all over the papers , because it makes a good story for people to catheterise their envy with . 
  yeah , just translate sondern as rather . 
  it tends to be used when something is directly related to something that contrasts with it . 
  he did n't like cats , however ( aber ) he liked dogs . 
  he did n't like men , rather ( sondern ) he liked women . 
  if you 're already acquainted with grammar i 'd just use this, 
  no , i do n't agree with you because your statement was overly simplified and reductivist . 
  i think that was pretty clear . 
  ergh , modal logic pisses me off . 
  just to get this straight . 
  ** du h\u00e4ttest da sein sollen ** = you should have been there = back then `` you should be here '' was true . 
  = at that point in the past normative thinking would 've placed you there , but you were n't . 
  ** du sollst da gewesen sein ** = you are supposed to have been there = all things being equal , you should have existed in that place back then = it is currently true now that you should , in the past , have been ( there ) = normative thinking now places you there at that time , but we 're not sure if that 's true . 
  ** du h\u00e4ttest das machen k\u00f6nnen ** = you were able to do it = back then , in the past , it was at that time possible for you to do it . 
  `` you can do this '' was true back then = at that point in the past a possibility to do it existed , but you did n't . 
  ** du kannst das gemacht haben ** = you might have done it = it is currently possible that , in the past , you actually did it , we do n't know . 
  = it is currently possible that you did that in the past , but we do n't know for sure . 
  ** du h\u00e4ttest das machen d\u00fcrfen ** = you were allowed to do it = back then , in the past , you were permitted to do it . 
  `` you may do this this '' was true back then . 
  = at that point in the past there existed permission to do it . 
  ** du darfst das gemacht haben ** = you are permitted to have done it = it is currently permitted that you did something in the past ( but maybe if you did the same thing now it would n't be ) . 
  = currently there exists an allowance for people who did that in the past meaning they are n't currently breaking any rules . 
  ** du h\u00e4ttest das machen m\u00fcssen ** = it was necessary that you do it = in the past , it was required that you do something , `` you must do this '' was true in the past . 
  = necessity required something of you in the past . 
  ** du musst das gemacht haben ** = you must have done it = it is currently necessary that something in the past was done by you . 
  = necessity currently requires that something in the past was done by you . 
  honestly , i really struggle with grasping the logical difference between these constructions , especially the one with `` sollen '' , you should have been there back then and back then you should have been there seem like logical equivalent statements to me . 
  no to mention all the times when german modals take on modalities other than what they normally represent . 
  i know that many of these could be interpreted differently with a non-standard modality , i 'm just sick of using these phrases like stock phrases and want to expose the underlying logical structure . 
  actually oversimplifications are harmful and you should either bother to make nuance clear or not at all . 
  you post made it sound like all politicians need do is follow the will of the majority , which is a harmful idea and exactly the kind of stupidity populists are currently getting behind . 
  i am calm mate , you need to be more precise or say nothing . 
  half truths seem big on the agenda right now . 
  edge of tomorrow : tom cruise is an alien battling time lord , he 's a pretty good alien battling time lord , until he has a crisis of confidence and meets a good looking woman / ex-time lord who talks him into being a better alien battling time lord . 
  sorry i misunderstood your first point . 
  as long as london is capital i see no problem there . 
  you 've forgotten ( he is still in a state of forgetfulness until he hears this utterance ) we have more guns than you have citizens . 
  if you 're referring to the uk i think we 've won more than a few in our day . 
  i think that 's pretty much what i 've got . 
  starting with the h\u00e4tte followed by two infinitives , the final one being a modality ( which is actually the perfect but does n't look like it due to lack of a - ge affix ) = subjunctive mood , indicating that a particular condition of modality existed in the past , but was n't acted upon . 
  with the preterite form of the modal + the infinitive e.g ich konnte das machen = indicative mood , indicating a certain condition of modality existed in the past and was acted upon . 
  with the present tense form of the modal verb followed by two non-modal infinitives ( one of which will be haben or sein ) = there is a current condition of modality that influences our belief about the past . 
   now , you can also use these things in their literal sense ( i.e. 
  to express a need or want or permission to have done something in the past ) . 
  but this is rather unusual , although it does happen, 
  yeah , i 'm well aware , but right now i 'm just trying to look at the strict logical structure of it . 
   this usage might also refer to a specific point in the future to form a sort of variation on futur ii : e.g. 
  yes , a similar thing happens in english , but only when certain signal words are invoked . 
  for example `` the application must have been submitted '' `` the application must have been submitted by next friday '' . 
  ( although most speakers would avoid this when talking about the future and just the future passive : the application must be submitted by friday , its usage is typically limited to the modal verb `` will '' to avoid ambiguity ) . 
  i 'm guessing that :, 
  der antrag muss eingegangen sein = does n't form the future ( or at least that 's not obvious ) in english : the application must be done ( now ), 
  let 's stay away from `` sein '' verbs for a moment to avoid an added layer of confusion . 
  die hausaufgabe muss bis n\u00e4chsten freitag gemacht sein = statal future , also translated as `` that must be done by next friday '', 
  is that even german ? 
  i guess this is how i would intuitively try to create the future perfect passive as an english speaker , but it looks kinda fucky to me . 
  by going on how `` it will have been done '' works , it seems logical . 
  london has the infrastructure too i believe . 
  it has been a capital city for a lot longer after all , even at one point being the capital of america . 
  it 's exactly the same in english of course , we would just use the future i passive 99 % of the time , which covers the job of both futur i passiv and the statal future too . 
  is there any real difference between ? 
  and, 
  as in is there any real difference in meaning between statal future and futur i passiv ? 
  the only time we might say `` the homework must have been done by next friday '' is if we really wanted to stress that its completion must occur before friday , but it 's rare , especially without `` will '' being used to really show we 're talking about the future . 
  `` the homework will have been done by next friday '' while hardly that common , is far more common in english than the `` die hausaufgabe wird bis n\u00e4chsten freitag gemacht sein worden '' is in german . 
  when you want to say `` would be '' in english , you 'd say `` w\u00e4re '' or whichever form of the word the sentence calls for . 
  funnily the mistake goes the other way too , i hear a lot of `` if you would be there '' from germans in english . 
  ah that 's interesting . 
  for the first meaning in english we would almost always use the future perfect, 
  it helps that in english the adjective form `` open '' and the verb form opened differ , so technically a slightly different meaning is conveyed ( the latter . 
  so the future simple passive `` the window must be opened by this evening '' and adjective form `` the windows must be open by this evening '' actually have different meaning here , the former stressing that the event must occur before that time , with the latter stressing that the state of openness must be the case at that time , but for many verbs their participle form is identical to their adjective form . 
  e.g `` the rug must be beaten ( adjective ) by this evening '' vs `` the rug must be beaten ( verb ) by this evening '' . 
  english needs the future perfect for these cases when it must be stress that a event must happen before a certain point ( rather than exist at a certain point ) , whereas i guess in these cases german does n't need it as it can choose between statal and simple passive futures . 
  seems that the statal future has basically made the future perfect unnecessary in german ( the futur passiv can do its job , and the statal can do the job of what in english would be mostly be done by the future passive , as the forms ( adjective vs verb ) are almost indistinguishable in english ) , and although it 's still capable of doing its job it 's almost completely defunct . 
  die fenster m\u00fcssen bis heute abend aufgemacht sein = the windows must be open until/by this evening . 
  more questions :, 
  is `` aufgemacht worden sein '' right ? 
  i guess i messed up the verb order in my example . 
  how do you distinguish between the meanings of :, 
  `` the windows must be in a state of openness up until this time '' vs `` the windows must be in a state of openness by at very least this time '' . 
  i 'd be tempted to use `` bis '' to translated both these meanings , but that 's probably wrong . 
  i guess i might translate the latter using `` vor '' but i do n't know if that 's right .

  you do/take the exam . 
  sorry i ca n't help regards the question . 
  or is he trying to say he skates at an old people 's home ? 
  i also think `` aber '' sounds weird , as it is n't really contrasting with the previous sentence , i would guess that he means `` sogar '' . 
  eigentlich , just use it whenever you want xd like `` denn '' it seems like one of those words that people just use to make questions sound a bit more proper . 
  she has some good videos on separable and inseparable prefixes , which , more than just telling which are which ( pretty easy to remember after a while ) , actually go through all the most common words with those prefixes and explores their `` meaning '' a bit , which is obviously quite vague and illogical at times but interesting nonetheless . 
   only in one case , in the grammatical ending - ig ( which corresponds to english - y ) , the fricative pronunciation of final \u27e8 g \u27e9 is prescribed by the siebs standard , for instance wichtig [ \u02c8v\u026a\u00e7t\u026a\u00e7 ] ( ` important ' ) . 
  the merger occurs neither in austro-bavarian and alemannic german nor in the corresponding varieties of standard german , and therefore in these regions - ig is pronounced [ \u026a\u0261\u030a ] .
