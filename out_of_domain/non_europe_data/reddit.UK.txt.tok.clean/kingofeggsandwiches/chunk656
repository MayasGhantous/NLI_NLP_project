  not really , i try to look for the best in people , but for a graduate student to come out with that stream of consciousness babble in an area she 's meant to be becoming an expert in is just not up to scratch . 
  it 's hilariously bad, 
  / r/shittymapporn meets / r/badlinguistics, 
  yeah the solution is not to haha . 
  also despite that some of these are just completely illogical even if you forgive the accent of reference ( wherever that may be ) . 
  for example netherlands has a - th in the english version , a sound that does n't even exist in dutch . 
  he 's not even been consistent or logical within his own attempt at phonetic rendering with english phonology , some of them are just wrong by any standard . 
  why would you use - th to represented / d / ??? 
  why a - g for / \u0272 / ??? 
  why is / a / sometimes - a and sometimes - ah, 
   uh , let 's see . 
  because `` the '' is a word and `` dee '' is n't and also because some dialects genuinely pronounce ` th ' as 'd ', 
  that 's the stupidest thing i 've heard in a while . 
  how the hell are we supposed to know which dialect the - th belongs to . 
  fyi the vast majority of english accents do n't have this . 
   let 's be honest , there is no reason to have both / d / and / \u00f0 / since english does n't have a / d / / \u00f0 / minimal pair, 
  so thy and die ? 
  thine and dine ? 
  those and doze ? 
  what the fuck are you talking about mate . 
   i just wrote ` land ' then people would likely think it 's pronounced / l\u00e6nd / instead of / ` land /, 
  so you wrote - ah for iceland but - a for deutschland ? 
  seriously dude , i think you need to revise your phonetics a bit . 
   yeah , well , i 'm sorry i do n't speak english as my first language . 
  / \u00f0 / is a really rare sound anyway and it 's close enough to / d / that no one will care , especially in this language that does n't have them as a minimal pair * anymore . 
  what the fuck are you talking about mate . 
  english speakers are going to care a great fucking deal . 
  those and dose , though and dough , they and day . 
  you clearly have no clue what you 're talking about . 
  to the vast majority native english speakers these sounds are as different as day and night . 
  simply put at least 300 million of the people that speak english natively are going to care a great deal . 
  these sounds are n't remotely allophonic to native english speakers . 
   that 's your fucking problem , or more precisely your language 's problem . 
  yes , let 's just have ambiguous words and then blame people when they ca n't figure it out . 
  you 're blaming english phonology for your inability to think clearly enough to realise that you 're randomly choosing any dialect you want to represent the sound is fucking stupid . 
  you sound like you 're got a big chip on your shoulder about english too buddy . 
  many asian languages are made out of thousands of unique symbols that you just have to learn , at least english 's words have some degree of logic even if it 's inconsistent . 
   nobody uses thy or thine anymore so yes , for all intents and purposes they 're not minimal pairs . 
  it 's not needed . 
  except all the other words that are minimal pairs with those sounds in english you delusional idiot . 
   / do\u028as / . 
  / do\u028az / . 
  mate , / do\u028as / is n't even the correct ipa for - those , what you 've written is n't a word ( at least not in the vast majority of english dialects ) . 
  the ipa for those is / \u00f0\u0259\u028az / or / \u00f0o\u028az / for doze it 's / d\u0259\u028az / or / do\u028az / . 
  mate you need to swallow your pride and give up because it 's coming hilarious clear that you do n't really understand even the fundamentals of phonetics . 
  you also clearly lack the understanding of english ( you 're unable to recognise what is and is n't a minimal pair , you 're making obvious mistakes with your ipa ) and many other european languages for this to be anything other than a big mess . 
  your blaming this on english orthography is just stupid , you chose to write this in english , i suggest you check wikipedia for a good attempt at phonetics that rely on english orthography . 
   well , considering i 've spoken english for 20 years , pronouncing / \u00f0 / as / d / and no one has ever picked up on it or complained ( i 'm in the uk by the way so please do n't just say i need to speak to native english speakers ) , yes . 
  there . 
  need . 
  distinguish . 
  them . 
  the words are different enough that context and pitch alone is enough ( yes , english has pitch , unless you say everything in a monotone voice . ), 
  mate . 
  you either do n't do that or you have a strong accent and do n't even realise . 
  in the uk there are lots of foreigners and we consider it rude to correct you provided we can understand you . 
  unlike the french we do n't really care if every word is n't perfect . 
  ( i 'll also add that pitch has very little to do with discerning words in english and is mostly dictated by where a word falls in a sentence ) . 
   ps , i know brexit happened and all but do please remember the rest of the world is still there and there exist dialects other than british and american . 
  so / do\u028as / and / do\u028az / is how i pronounce them . 
  yes , so you pronounce them non-standardly and have an accent . 
   oh , i know what you 're going to say - i 'm bastardising english with my weird dialect and i should probably go back to school . 
  well tough , maybe if you did n't colonise half the planet and lead to this world today where english is the de facto language for communications then there are n't going to be 7 billion people needing to learn it for communications , which is what english is supposed to be in the first place . 
  `` the language that allows everyone to understand each other '' , not `` the language that you need to spend half your life studying because lol who cares about globalisation and working together that 's not what language is for '' - oh , wait , i forgot i 'm speaking to a brit . 
  never mind . 
  yep , this is just one massive projection of your personal chip on your shoulder . 
  i do n't give a shit how you speak mate . 
  what i object to is amateur linguists spreading nonsense . 
  that 's the real problem with linguistics , everyone thinks they 're an expert . 
  i suggest you head over to / r/linguistics and also check out / r/badlinguistics and educate yourself a bit . 
   by the way , someone once told me that you 've lost an argument once you resort to insults . 
  it 's something i 've always remembered . 
  someone is an idiot . 
  i 'm sorry if i 'm insulting but when you 're making up nonsense like the notion that / d / and / \u00f0 / . are n't minimal pairs in english it 's hard not to . 
  just because one can get by in a language without differentiating a sound does n't mean they 're allophonic to native speakers of that language , nor does it mean there are n't any minimal pairs . 
  the sporting thing to do would be admit you fucked up instead of endless delusional ranting and accusing people of racism just because they point out how bad your phonetic transcriptions are and pointing out you 're pronouncing words non-standardly . 
   now if you 'll excuse me , i think i 'll go learn spanish . 
  hopefully the spaniards would be delighted i 'm trying to learn their tongue instead of telling me off for not pronouncing their \u00f1 correctly . 
  you do that . 
  you 're going to in for a shock when you realise that much of europe is way more fussy about proper pronunciation . 
  one of the great things about english is that we do n't have a dominant standardised form . 
  cute that you think it 's different anywhere else . 
  i think you 'll find it worse in most countries . 
  you 're taking these really personally as if i were being racist . 
  it 's also funny that you 're making out like i 'm a brexit nut patriot ... 
  i do n't even live in the uk . 
  i do n't give a fuck how people speak . 
  i would just rather people did n't bullshit in the field of linguistics and inadvertently spread misinformation . 
  well , i 'm also objecting to your shitty attitude and falsification of information to try to appear correct . 
  i wo n't lecture you about how your native language words if you do n't lecture me about mine . 
  i think i 'm rather more in the position of authority here . 
   well , i presume you think i 'm saying that they 're the same sound , because i 'm not . 
  i 'm just saying that / d / and / \u00f0 / can be merged in english and it would n't create any ambiguity . 
  that 's not what a minimal pair is . 
  you can merge whole vowel sets in english and still be comprehensible . 
  that does n't remotely mean nobody is going to care when you write `` the '' for `` duh '' . 
  you 've come off proper arrogant to me , and you also seem to have some deep seated issues with english and thinking british people are all racist , which is sad . 
  you 'd think living there would be proof enough that dissuade of such bigotry . 
  have fun anyway mate . 
  this is a pointless conversation .
