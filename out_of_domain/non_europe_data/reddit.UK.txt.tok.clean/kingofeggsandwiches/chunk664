  aussie accents are n't really `` americanised '' my friend . 
  that 's just how aussies sound . 
  except for when teenagers start cracking out those americanisms . 
  i 'd like to see you demonstrate that with evidence that the phonology of australian english has shifted towards american . 
  i really do n't think it has , sure teenagers pick up expressions and words , but i hardly think the accent has been americanised . 
  that 's just how australians sound . 
  do n't worry mcburgerfat , y' all go back to speakin ' murrican naw, 
  i 've found people with aspergers and autism to be the most offended when they get interrupted . 
  their lack of awareness about how people are reacting to what they 're saying does n't allow them to pick up on the social clues that tell you when you 're going on a bit long or the other person is eager to participate in conversation . 
  honestly i do n't know who are worse , the people interrupt excessively or the people who make that pouty insulted face whenever they get interrupted regardless of what they were saying . 
  when you 're down the pub it 's called chat for a reason . 
  if you 've got a funny interjection it 's not going to be funny in a minute 's time when you 've finished your exposition . 
  i have some friends from the mid-west of the us and they are really into taking turns to talk . 
  i 've often interjected with a short jokey comment or point and in response they stop speaking entirely and look at you as if you 've annoyed them , not seeming to understand that adding a comment does n't mean their time with the `` speaking stick '' has to be over and they can just continue with what they were saying . 
  serial interrupters are annoying , especially when they 're just going to start gushing out their opinion after not allowing you to finish yours , but an element of interruption is part of an interesting group conversation . 
  different parts of the english speaking world definitely have difference tolerances for interruption too . 
  big city cultures tend to compete to get their word in whereas simpler folk tend to prefer to say their piece and then acquiesce to the next person and allow them their turn . 
  yeah , word to the wise , do n't go around getting annoyed by people 's grammar mistakes . 
  language is a tool not a sacred system . 
  it 's perfectly natural for people to conflate homophones . 
  if it were in a professional or academic capacity that 's somewhat different as it shows a sloppiness in that they did n't bother to check what they 'd written . 
  otherwise it 's no real indication of character or intelligence . 
  ironically , the people who get most annoyed by grammatical errors are those who do n't really understand grammar themselves and tend to follow a bunch of grammatical superstitions like not ending sentences with prepositions or not starting sentences with conjunctions . 
  i 'm sure if you submitted some writing to me i could find a ton of grammatical errors in your writing ; the only difference is that you 're not aware of them . 
  for example you wrote : `` i 'd want to have that discussion before deciding if i want to make him my man '' which is ungrammatical . 
  there 's probably someone raging because you do n't know the difference between `` i 'll want to have that discussion before deciding if i want to make him my man '' and `` i 'd want to have that discussion before deciding if i wanted to make him my man '' . 
  the other answer is quite confusing imo . 
  to explain a bit further there are 3 verbs that people get confused . 
  x | present simple | past simple | present participle | past participle, 
  to lie ( decieve ) | lie | lied | lying | lied, 
  to lie ( intransitive ) | lie | ** lay ** | lying | lain, 
  to lie ( transitive ) | lay | laid | laying | laid, 
  the transitive version of the verb is only used with an object e.g to lay eggs , to lay mines , to lay a book on the table . 
  the intransitive version is used for the meaning `` lying down '' , which is the relevant usage here since there is not object . 
  in this case you need to use the intransitive form of `` to lie '' , however , you also need to the past simple , as the verb needs to agree with the earlier verb `` clambered . 
  it basically means that england gets first dibs on enterprises when they equal what is offered by other countries . 
  otherwise means `` in all other regards except this one '' , `` this one '' referring to the fact that it 's england offering the enterprise rather than another country . 
  bear in mind this is not normal english and it 's only in a legal context that anyone would feel it necessary to point out that the equality of the enterprises needs to exclude that fact they 're offered by different parties . 
  both are grammatical . 
  context will decide which is better . 
  `` then '' here stresses that his continuation of his speech was preceded by something else that happened . 
  putting `` then '' in when it 's not following something else will sound wrong , leaving it out , even when preceded by something else , wo n't . 
  the former is correct and the latter is ungrammatical . 
  `` had '' never follows `` would '' except in rare circumstances when they 're separated by some form of punctuation . 
  the latter is correct due to tense agreement being necessary in english . 
  `` would '' is treated as a past tense in the english language , although that can be less than obvious due to its modality . 
  `` see '' here is in the infinitive . 
  examples of tense agreement, 
  `` he says he is a doctor '' ( all the time ), 
  `` he said he was a doctor '' ( and he still is but we use the past tense anyway due to tense agreement ), 
  `` he said he had been a doctor '' `` he said he used to be a doctor '' ( correct way to invoke the past tense while maintaining tense agreement ) . 
  this is fine both with and without `` then '' . 
  `` then '' makes perfect sense to use in this context . 
  however , be aware that `` he begun '' is incorrect and it should be `` he began '' . 
  `` began '' is past simple , `` begun '' is the past participle form . 
  nothing seriously wrong with it . 
  it 's a relatively simple sentence . 
  the only objection i can see is that the preposition `` with '' does n't particularly fit as the driving experience has little directly to do with the licence itself . 
  `` i have a driver 's license , 12 years of driving experience , and a clean driving record . '', 
  seems appropriate . 
  also if you 're using british english `` driver 's '' should be `` driving '' and `` license '' should be `` licence '' ( noun vs verb form ) . 
  pat is an abbreviation of patrick at least so it 's acceptable if peculiar . 
  bloody humourless krauts , had it been posted in / r/askuk it would 've been full of posts confirming his darkest fears . 
  i 'm sure corbyn will be well up for that role given how little he attempts to oppose the tories . 
  honestly i think that taking away the option to become part of a european superstate from younger generations is a big part of why the old flooded the polls to vote out . 
  no sensible human being actually thinks that the eu could make us into a federal part of the eu against our will , but many realise that given another 25 years the eu would be as normal as anything ( the generation that remembers the uk prior to that period mostly being dead ) and then britain might willingly join a larger european state . 
  so nice of granddad and grandma , in their infinite wisdom , to rob this younger generation of no-good slackers of the possibility before it even becomes a possibility . 
  after all , granny knows best ... especially when it comes to britain 's geopolitical place in the world . 
  brexit was a vote for the downfall of the centuries old union for sure . 
  well done little englanders , your patriotism is going to destroy the country you claim to prize so highly . 
  you got me there . 
  yeah you are right , sadly that does n't really answer my question . 
  i 'm quite happy with standard if-then conditionals . 
  what i 'm trying to get to the core is how modal verbs in their preterite forms interact with the various tenses when they have clauses as their object , or to put it another way , how the predicate `` would like '' interacts with a complex object like `` what i say '' `` what i thought '' etc. 
  you would like what i say, 
  you would like what i said, 
  you would like what i 've said, 
  you would like what i 'd said, 
  compared with :, 
  you like what i say, 
  you like what i said, 
  you like what i 've said, 
  you like what i 'd said, 
  you liked what i say ( ungrammatical afaik ), 
  you liked what i said, 
  you liked what i 've said ( ungrammatical afaik ), 
  you liked what i 'd said, 
  then the further question is how this applies to stative verbs . 
  with a dynamic verb in a sentence like `` you would like what i say '' it seems to me that the habitual aspect is invoked , however , this is obviously not possible with stative verbs . 
  thus :, 
  you would like what i think, 
  you would like what i thought, 
  you would like what i 've thought, 
  you would like what i 'd thought, 
  seems to behave differently from the first example . 
  it would be great if you could tell me which of these examples you consider to be ungrammatical and why . 
  i 'm really trying to get to the core of how tense concordance comes into play in these examples . 
  sorry if i was n't clear on that before . 
  edit : it 's just occurred to me that like is stative so :, 
  you eat what i make,
