  twice here functions as an adverb modifying the verb `` need '' . 
  how do they need water ? 
  they need in a way that is twice as great as humans . 
  in `` as other animals do '' `` do '' is functioning as auxiliary verb standing in for the previous verb . 
  e.g `` he needs as much water as you do '' = `` he needs as much water as you need '', 
  in `` as do other animals '' all it means is that the same is true of the latter as the former . 
  e.g humans need water , as do animals '' . 
  what ? 
  you seem to be ignoring tense concordance, 
   i saw on her facebook that she ** was ** working ... 
   i saw on her social media that she 's working as a waitress, 
  should be :, 
   i saw on her social media that she ** was ** working as a waitress, 
  english requires to tenses to agree . 
  the fact we say ** was working ** does n't mean that it 's an event that is currently finished . 
  the logic of english simply demands that because that the time you thought to yourself `` she is working as ... '' , and because you had that thought in the past , it gets reported as `` i saw she was working '' . 
  native speakers wo n't interpret that to mean she no longer works as such . 
  it can seem illogical to speakers of languages without this feature at first , but when you think about it it 's actually quite logical because if you saw that in the past you ca n't really speak for the present moment with complete certainty . 
   i see on her social media that she 's working as a waitress, 
  this is fine because `` see '' is in the present tense . 
  the reason you can use the present tense is because certain verbs like `` think '' , `` see '' , and `` hear '' can be used in a more general sense which allows the use of the present simple . 
  compare :, 
   i heard he was working there, 
  suggests a one off event in the past in which the speaker heard this piece of information . 
   i hear he is working there, 
  suggests a general `` hearing '' of the news , perhaps from gossip . 
  it might be closer to `` it is generally said that he works there '' . 
  there are exceptions tense agreement in english , the most common being when we 're dealing with things that happen all the time and are stable and routine e.g, 
   i heard he ** plays ** football, 
  would be a common way of expressing that at a one off point in time you were told that football is a regular hobby of his . 
  this usage tends to be restricted to the present simple though . 
  this really depends on what you mean , which is n't really clear to be honest . 
  `` i will see myself out '' is a common phrase in english which means `` do n't accompany me to the door when i leave '' . 
  do you want that meaning ? 
  or do you literally mean that you can envision yourself as free . 
  i 'd suggest :, 
  `` i can see myself as free '' in this case , which means that literally in this moment you can envision yourself at being free . 
  `` i see myself as free '' would suggest it 's something you envision often , repetitively or constantly , because of the present simple . 
  primary is n't often treated as a relation in english , because it is quite literally first . 
  being primary does n't require something it is primary to , whereas something ca n't be secondary without being secondary to something . 
   x is primary , and y is secondary to x, 
  is what my gut suggests would be a clear sentence . 
  however , that said , it sounds like you 're doing maths or logic or something , and in these situations the rules of ordinary language tend not to apply . 
  as long as your meaning is clear i ca n't imagine a professor would mark you down for the english . 
  by whose political definition are you making that grand claim ? 
  it 's perfectly evident that all those countries see themselves as synthesising elements of socialist , democratic , and capitalist political theory to create a balance of social and economic freedom , egalitarianism , equality , and national prosperity . 
  why on earth do so many american right wingers seem to think it 's really clever to apply karl marx 's definition of socialism as a society in which the means of production are entirely publicly owned whenever someone says the word `` socialism '' . 
  maybe every time someone brings up capitalism we should hold that to adam smith 's definition as a society that relies on virtually malthusian principles of survival entirely led by the invisible hand of the market . 
  i swear to god people are becoming so stupid that all nuance escapes them completely . 
  words mean what they are meant to mean and not what some guy who coined the term defined them as hundreds of years ago . 
  all serious modern right wing politicians believe that some modicum of state ownership , market regulation , and public work is necessary in the same way that all serious left wing politicians believe that a monetary system , democratic leadership , and private enterprise is necessary to society 's continued function . 
  why do n't you stop trying to appear intelligent by citing long out of date political definitions and actually engage with the argument earnestly . 
  very few of the people calling for `` socialism '' want marxist socialism , they tend to simply want taxes to be spent on a bigger welfare system . 
  technically correct but very archaic sounding . 
  i would suggest `` like so '' as a more modern alternative , or even `` like this '' which would be be even more everyday language . 
  `` staff '' is definitely the subject . 
  `` staff '' ( referring to workers ) is a plural noun in my dialect . 
  never heard anyone say `` the staff has left '' , but it 's probably possible if you 're treating them as a singular entity . 
  first of all , you should be asking why all the other words lost their inflections while the 3rd person singular retain its inflection . 
  as for what 's special about the 3rd person singular that causes it to resist the pattern of morphological simplification that occurred over the centuries that 's a very hard to question and ca n't really be answered by `` grammar '' experts . 
  perhaps try / r/linguistics , they might have a better explanation as to why . 
  i 'm going to add a bit more compared to the last guy , because the usage of `` meta '' to mean self-referential is actually quite a new one . 
  you could even say that this limited understanding of the word is a mistake based on how it 's used and the cross it has with self-referential things . 
  this words has been cropping up in online culture quite a bit lately . 
  reddit users often use it when someone makes a joke that refers outside of the topic or thread . 
  for example , if there 's a popular thread about united airlines , and in a totally different thread about youtube drama someone links something someone said to united airlines as a joke , people will say things like `` meta '' . 
  gamers also often talk about meta to mean a type of strategy that is beyond the actual straightforward game skills , and similar to macro , suggests a wider or larger strategy . 
  the etymology of the word is :, 
   word-forming element meaning 1 . 
  `` after , behind , '' 2 . 
  `` changed , altered , '' 3 . 
  `` higher , beyond ; '' from greek meta ( prep . ), 
  `` in the midst of ; in common with ; by means of ; between ; in pursuit or quest of ; after , next after , behind , '' in compounds most often meaning `` change '' of place , condition , etc. 
  this is from pie * me - `` in the middle '' ( source also of german mit , gothic mi\u00fe , old english mi\u00f0 `` with , together with , among ; '' see mid ) . 
  notion of `` changing places with '' probably led to senses `` change of place , order , or nature , '' which was a principal meaning of the greek word when used as a prefix ( but also denoting `` community , participation ; in common with ; pursuing '' ) . 
   third sense , `` higher than , transcending , overarching , dealing with the most fundamental matters of , '' is due to misinterpretation of metaphysics as `` science of that which transcends the physical . '', 
  this has led to a prodigious erroneous extension in modern usage , with meta - affixed to the names of other sciences and disciplines , especially in the academic jargon of literary criticism . 
  at it 's more simple level i would say the everyday meaning of `` meta '' is simply beyond . 
  metadata is `` beyond '' the actual data itself , but is rather data about the data , in which case you get this notion of higher order , but it does n't have to mean self-referential . 
  the word `` do '' does n't need to be avoided in professional writing , what you 've written is very clear . 
  i 'd be careful substituting words because they often slightly alter the tone and meaning , as you 've quite rightly noticed . 
  `` customers misunderstand '' would suggest they tried to understand but got the wrong idea whereas `` customers do not understand '' is simply a clear statement of the fact that they do not possess the understanding . 
  in all writing we tend to avoid repetition because it becomes boring for the reader , but in business this is really a secondary concern , whereas in literature it 's a bigger deal . 
  are bidets common in europe ? 
  i 've not noticed them in central europe much . 
  i believe it 's mostly a french thing . 
  yeah , the suggestion is that they are `` beyond human '' , and have somehow become more or greater than human . 
  self-referential things tend to have an element of `` meta '' , because it 's looking at a thing from a higher order perspective , but the word itself does n't actually mean that . 
  honestly when i read that i did n't even notice the pun did n't work in english . 
  all i did was wonder what the fuck a `` long waiting queue '' was . 
  honestly , native english speakers would n't even get that there was meant to be a joke , they 'd just be fascinated by the weird word choice . 
  i mean it kinda suggests the queue itself likes to wait a long time like a `` late sleeping student '' or a `` hard drinking sailor '' . 
  poor sob ( son of a bitch ) is the normal expression i think . 
  well warteschlange works in german is it 's not that crazy xd but yeah , german can be pretty pointlessly overly explanatory . 
  thing that 's strange is how they 've used the present participle as an adjective . 
  it basically says `` lange wartende warteschlangen '' . 
  the french decided that 's how to spell `` queue '' , got to differentiate it from `` cue '' somehow !, 
  no way !, 
  things and ideas are not simply compounds of other things and ideas , a unique sign for every thing is far more elegant imo . 
   taking out trash,
