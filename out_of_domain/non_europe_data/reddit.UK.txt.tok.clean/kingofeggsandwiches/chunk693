  then you have to realise that there are least a dozen more english words being change that we have n't discussed here because they 're harder to correlate with the german words and their precise senses . 
  english tends to be a bit more forgiving in the sense that you use `` change '' for almost all of these ideas if you want , but if you 're doing that and thinking english lacks synonyms then the failing is n't with the language but with the way you 're using it . 
  you would n't say `` he liked to played guitar '' . 
  so why would you say `` he did n't went there '' ? 
  it 's only the finite verb that is inflected according to tense and person . 
  on what scale ? 
  newcastle is both a shithole and the best place in the world in the eyes of many . 
  coventry is industrial grey and shit with virtually nothing remarkable about it culturally . 
  it 's cultural no-man 's land with plenty of 70s buildings , a horrible ring road , and a lot of poverty in its northern part . 
  the nazis flattened it during the war and what they build afterwards was generic and horrible . 
  that said i had a great time when i lived near there because ultimately life is about the people you 're with and not the city you 're in . 
  newcastle is industrial grey and shit but with a very strong local culture and sense of local identity . 
  it 's notoriously one of the better places in the uk to go out and party , with probably the lowest price for booze in the whole country ( but also some of the lowest wages and living costs generally ) . 
  most people i know who went to uni in and around coventry had a great time but said the city is a shithole that they will never return to . 
  most people i know who went to uni in and around newcastle had the great time but remember the city fondly for its friendly unique culture and sense of local solidarity , claiming that they 'd like to go back there some time . 
  what can i say , both cities are industrial , grey , cold , and outwardly depressing . 
  newcastle just had a bit more unique about it and is the dominant city in its region unlike coventry which is virtually just an extension of birmingham these days without a unique identity of its own . 
   i used to live in the uk , in glasgow and i struggled a lot with both of these in the beginning . 
  humour ? 
  that 's not a grammatical sentence . 
  i will go / i will be going / i would go / i would be going, 
  i will have gone / i will have been going / i would have gone / i would have been going, 
  i go / i am going, 
  i went / i was going, 
  i have gone / i have been going, 
  i had gone / i had been going, 
   future-in-the-past perfect continuous, 
  he was to have been playing ? 
  honestly i think you can get by without that one given it comes up probably only a few times a year in formal writing and such . 
  more likely you 're delusional . 
   its pretty clear to me when to use simple perfect , but present perfect is ... weird . 
  there is not such thing as the `` simple perfect '' . 
  there is the present perfect simple and the present perfect continuous . 
  `` simple '' here means the same as `` not-continuous '' . 
  the rules are relatively simple :, 
  we use the present perfect simple to describe a completed action in the past that has a special relationship to the present . 
  this can be :, 
  1 ) an action that started in the past and is still going on when combined with a time phrases :, 
   i have worked here for 3 years . 
  relationship = started in the past and is still continuing . 
  perfect aspect is possible because of the time phrase meaning the `` 3 years '' is complete . 
  2 ) an action in the past that is now complete but has a special relevancy to the present in the sense that happened recently and is assumed to be new information to the listener :, 
   the prime minister has announced an election, 
  this must have happened recently and is new information . 
  3 ) when there 's a clear casual relationship between the current state of affairs and a past event . 
   `` there 's nothing here by ash and ruins ; the house has burnt down '', 
  relationship = burning of house happened in the past but is still influencing the present . 
  4 ) when we 're talking about events in the past and we are n't interested in when they happened , often combined with `` ever '' . 
   have you been to france ? 
  i have been to france !, 
  relationship = criteria for truth value of statement is timeless . 
  quite literally `` i possess the `` going to '' of france . '', 
  and that is something that you possess regardless of when it happened . 
  edit : the other thing to remember is that the present perfect can not be used with any time phrases that are finished . 
  `` i have eaten breakfast today '' is great = `` i possess today 's eating of breakfast '' . 
  `` i have eaten breakfast yesterday '' is wrong = `` i possess yesterday 's eating of breakfast '' ... no you do n't because yesterday is already over . 
  no , definitely meant to respond to you . 
  maybe i misunderstood what you were trying to say . 
  no offence , but looking at your post history that seems like a dubious claim e.g, 
   all the maps will have slowly have made its way into your feeble mind . 
  this does n't work firstly because the pronoun for `` maps '' should be `` their '' as it 's plural . 
  also your sentence has too many `` haves '' , `` will have slowly have made '' is unnecessary and ungrammatical . 
   hell , there 's well known competetive payers who cant even get a hit on him . 
  there are * , competitive *, 
   here 's all his lines if you want to enjoy them . 
  here are *, 
   you were n't intended to dunk in basketball . 
  you clearly do n't understand how the word intend is used . 
  the person who intends here is the person who makes the rules , and not the player who does the dunking . 
  correctly this should be `` it was n't intended that you dunk in basketball . '', 
  ( impersonal pronoun ) or `` the game 's designers did n't intend for people to dunk in basketball '' . 
  `` you were n't intended to do it '' does n't really make sense . 
  you 're treating `` intend '' with the same rules as `` meant '' , which is sadly not the case . 
  some of your mistakes are clearly just being lazy , spelling etc. 
  and you make mistakes that natives make . 
  but you also make some mistakes that clearly show you do n't have a native like grasp of the language . 
  do n't want to be mean about your english skills , but if it were as easy as your claim why are you still making some fundamental mistakes ? 
  you 've fallen into the trap where your english is good , good enough for everyone to understand you and you end up thinking you 've mastered the language and it 's easy . 
  sadly it 's harder than you 're giving credit . 
  not really . 
  i actually overlooked all the `` lazy mistakes '' you make and just tried to focus on the kinds of mistakes that native speakers do n't tend to make . 
  no native speaker would say `` you are not intended to do that '' for example , it just makes no sense to someone with a native background . 
  although i 'm sure you 're highly fluent , i highly doubt that you 'd be able to write as the level of a native college graduate or equivalent , so before you go around boasting about how easy it is i suggest you look at your own abilities and ask yourself why , after so many years , you still ca n't produce flawless english every time . 
  no they 're all future in the past . 
  the form with `` to be '' is generally more formal . 
  the difference is that the `` would '' and `` was going to '' forms are generally treated as conditional , as they imply that something did n't happen . 
  they are in essence counterfactual . 
  a statement like `` in 1900 , nobody could 've predicted that there were to be only 14 years until a war between germany and britain . '', 
  is a true `` future in the past '' , because it 's saying what was set to happen in the future from the perspective of the past , and also saying that it did happen . 
  the counterfactual of this is `` was to have been a war '' , which includes the idea that there was n't a war . 
  compare :, 
  `` he was going to come '' ( he personally intended to , but he did n't in the end ), 
  `` he would have come '' ( if something had been different ),
