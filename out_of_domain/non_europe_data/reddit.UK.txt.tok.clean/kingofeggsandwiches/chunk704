  britons are well aware of the good side of america , and in the clinton era it was our favourite country , sadly the last 20 years have sullied america 's rep sadly . 
  to be fair . 
  it 's a british show that is going out to a mostly progressive and relatively left wing audience . 
  a lot of humour is taking the piss out stuff in a way red blooded irony-free american patriots would be appalled by . 
  doug stanhope 's bits fit well with the programme because it gives it a bit of balance . 
  british culture is pretty self-deprecatory so we can laugh at someone talking the piss out of us . 
  lol that 's massively historically inaccurate . 
  i 'm not agreeing with the guy who you responded to but your version is just as one sided and wrong . 
  yes , they were born on the british colony of america and all of them had british citizenship and were born seeing themselves as british subjects of the throne with british parents . 
  christ , actually read your founding father 's work . 
  they hated continental europe as much as the english and put english culture of the highest pedestal imaginable . 
  they actually appealed to english law when they justified the revolution . 
  they thought old england had lost its way and they could do a better job . 
  gandhi was indian , a culture that had existed on that occupied land for millennia , the british colonies were unsurprisingly populated by british peoples and had their culture . 
  america might like to see itself as a completely mixed melting pot but that really did n't come until much later . 
  where are the culturally german , french , and dutch founding fathers ? 
  they do n't exist , because british america was unsurprisingly culturally british . 
  here 's franklin on germans just to give you a taste of how they actually thought :, 
   why should pennsylvania , founded by the ** english ** , become a colony of aliens , who will shortly be so numerous as to germanize us instead of our ** anglifying ** them , and will never adopt our language or customs , any more than they can acquire our complexion . 
  lol , seems like that one must have touched a soft spot . 
   you 're just sad little brit who wishes that there was still a raj and that your country was n't going to shit . 
  alas , such is life when one of our states has nearly as much money as your whole country !, 
  that being said , i am appreciating it - and i love doing it just to be able to go back to america and use the education to give back to the usa , and not a dime to this pathetic tory filled shitstain of a nation, 
  so you 're a nationalist who likes to get into gdp dick waving contests and that 's why you ca n't stop pining for the us ? 
  ah makes sense now . 
  seriously , what 's pathetic is that you stay in the uk when you feel that way about the country . 
  it 's also a bit rich of you to call a the uk a shit stain for being tory filled . 
  if we 're basing this on right wing populism then if the uk 's a shit stain the us would be a turd . 
  all i was trying to do was make you see how sad it is to be somewhere and pine for home . 
  i love the uk regardless of what you say about it and its flaws but i do n't spend my time abroad missing home , it 's a healthier way to live your life . 
  in germany i 'm too busy enjoying the richness of a different culture to miss the uk , and i 'm sure if i were at harvard i 'd be too busy too ( i admire american culture for its accomplishments just as i admire german or french culture , even if britain is ultimately where my heart lies ) . 
  incidentally i seem to have revealed your deeply nationalist fervour that is preventing you from letting go . 
  it 's all good . 
  have a nice life in the usa , thanks for the tuition fees . 
  thank you jesus , i 've been looking for this feature forever but was too lazy to google it . 
  this is pure reactionary bullshit . 
  it 's nothing to do with morality , and by buying into that moral decay argument you are contributing to the americanisation of the uk that consists in simplistic narratives that promote social conservatism . 
  look how america effectively uses conservative morality to tell the `` good people '' how they should n't have to pay for a social support for the `` bad people '' . 
  it 's time to legalise drugs , stop blaming modernity for society 's ills , and encourage social responsibility . 
  other countries have the same drugs , the same video games , and the same modern phenomena , but they actual take responsibility for it instead of buying into this `` final days of rome '' culture that it 's in love with the idea that society has lost its way . 
  britain is incredibly susceptible to this kind of thinking due to the legacy of empire and `` greatness '' , and you see it in ever bloody tv programme popular in the uk it 's all negativity and fear of the future . 
  dystopia porn is everywhere because it lets people feel better about not giving a shit . 
  your attitude of seeing everything as fucked is exactly what is causing it to be that way , it 's exactly what tells people that if they take drugs or do n't follow the moral majority opinion they are not valued in society , and that 's what causes people to stop giving a fuck . 
  you are literally causing what you claim to hate . 
  it 's these stupid conservative moral values that glorify that past that let 's people stop engaging with society , dehumanise the other , and wash their hands of social responsibility . 
  britain needs to come together , stop the disownership of the poor and/or dysfunctional , and working on including people in society again warts and all . 
  corbyn is less committed to a hard brexit than may is now . 
  may has committed herself and now has to deliver , corbyn is able to backtrack a bit as he would have a new mandate . 
  nobody thinks keeping fom is viable now but with a deal eu migrants in the uk and british overseas residents in the eu are more likely to have favourable terms and a deal is more likely under a labour government . 
  yes i will be voting . 
  as an british citizen resident in the eu is makes sense to vote against the tories if only to undermine their mandate as much as is humanly possible . 
  i will be voting strategically in my constituency to maximise the chance of reducing their majority , and i recommend everyone else who opposes the tories do the same regardless of how they personally feel about corbyn or farron . 
  first it was cold and there were no people . 
  then hello , the snow is melting and people are walking across the remaining ice . 
  barbarian tribes just hanging out until the romans arrive . 
  and then piss off a few hundred years later leaving little more than some old villas and christianity . 
  what 's this ? 
  hello germans from across the sea , like our country ? 
  why not take it ? 
  kill some of the locals and breed with the ones left ? 
  a bit later , what 's this ? 
  more germans ? 
  this time with an even more scandinavian flavour , coming to rape and steal from the older germans ? 
  why not , what goes around comes around after all . 
  in fact why not take the whole east side of the country ? 
  later still , what 's this ? 
  french flavoured german scandinavians ? 
  this is getting ridiculous . 
  thankfully they only wanted a hostile takeover of the upper management roles . 
  by the way , we 're part of northern france and the language du mode is bad french now , at least that 's what the cool kids speak . 
  but feel free to mix it with your weird german-norse hybrid language . 
  slowly lose parts of france until northern france is an island in the north seas now . 
  what do we do now lads ? 
  let 's fight the french a bunch !, 
  ok , france is n't working out . 
  but hey there 's an island to the east that looks kinda sweet . 
  let 's have that instead . 
  pope is being a dick . 
  guess we 're protestant now . 
  fuck the catholics !, 
  you know what 's cool ? 
  boats !, 
  let 's fight the spanish and colonise stuff ? 
  scotland takes over the ceo role . 
  oh no , the king has too much power let 's have a revolution . 
  no more kings !, 
  oh no , looks like we 've swapped a king for a dictator , bring back kings !, 
  scottish decide to join the team . 
  plagues and stuff , capital city burns down . 
  dutchman takes over the ceo role . 
  you know what 's great ? 
  north america , potatoes and cancer sticks and stuff . 
  we can have the irish grow em for us . 
  germans takes over the ceo role . 
  you know what sucks ? 
  north america , ungrateful bunch of whining frog lovers who are too cheap to pay taxes . 
  let 's colonise something else . 
  back to the tried and tested ways , let 's fight the french !, 
  we 'll give the yanks a bit of a kicking too . 
  that was hard but we won .
