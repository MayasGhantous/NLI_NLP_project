  do we know why they were torn down ? 
  no , it 's left ambiguous , it might have been because the king did n't like them or it might have been because they were old and ugly and needed to be torn down anyway . 
  `` which '' here is just adding information about the houses , that information being that they happened to offend the king . 
  it 's like saying `` there were some houses , they just happened to be disliked by the king , and at some point the townsfolk tore them down . '', 
  so in b ) we have something different . 
  we are saying that the particular houses that the king was offended by were torn down by the people . 
  probably because they offended the king . 
  in b ) the set of houses that is relevant to the statement is defined by the fact they offended the king . 
  it 's like saying `` each house the king was offended by was torn down by the town 's people '' . 
  i 'm sorry that 's not correct . 
  i think the guy above you is confusing `` which '' the interrogative with `` which '' the reflexive pronoun . 
  these are different uses of the word . 
  when asking questions for example ( interrogative ) , if you have a number of cats in front of you , you would ask `` which cat do you like the most ? '' . 
  this is in contrast with more open questions like `` what is the best way to wash a cat ? 
  '' , since there is not a predetermined set of ways to wash a cat `` which '' does n't make sense here . 
  however you 're using it as a reflexive pronoun . 
  you 've got it entirely the wrong way round . 
  in your example `` the cat , which had black fur , crossed my path '' , is something you 'd say when there ** was n't ** necessarily more than one cat present at the time . 
  this is because `` which '' is used to add information that is n't necessarily directly relevant . 
  you could say this with only one cat and it would be natural . 
  if you said `` the cat that had black fur crossed my path '' , this is something you 're more likely to say if there ** was ** a number of cats to choose from , only one of them having black fur . 
  this is because `` that '' does work specifying the particular things the statement is true of . 
  `` which '' is for adding information that is n't directly relevant , `` that '' is for adding information that is directly relevant to the sentence in question . 
  please check my other post for clarification . 
  i 'm sorry that 's not really it : /, 
  i 've already explained why it does n't work to change the spelling of words generally [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/2kkdcy/nonnative_speakers_of_english_what_is_something/clmid1v ) if you 're interested . 
  in short simply leads to the divergence of languages into entirely new languages that are n't mutually comprehensible . 
  this is different because it 's a place name . 
  but i disagree anyway , everyone knows how to pronounce it , not only does not changing it maintains the the history of language , but it also acts as a shibboleth . 
  the germans had a terrible time trying to spy during the war purely because of things like this . 
  you 're not wrong . 
  just to use your example to further explain . 
  a ) the tv shows , which were on hbo , were bad . 
  b ) the tv shows that were on hbo were bad . 
  a ) = we have some shows . 
  they were on hbo . 
  they were bad . 
  do we know that every show on hbo was bad ? 
  no , only the predefined set of shows were bad , there may have been other shows on hbo that were good . 
  we are just adding information about the shows that are have already defined , that information is that they just happened to be on hbo . 
  b = each and every show that was on hbo at the time was bad . 
  do we know that there were n't any good ones ? 
  yes , all the shows that were on hbo at the time were bad . 
  we can go deeper if you want . 
  for example, 
  c ) john made tv shows . 
  john 's tv shows , which were on hbo , were bad . 
  d ) john made tv shows . 
  john 's tv shows that were on hbo were bad . 
  c ) = all of john 's tv shows are bad , they just happen to all be on hbo . 
  are all this shows on hbo ? 
  yes, 
  d ) = are all of john 's tv shows bad ? 
  only the ones on hbo . 
  he might have shows on other networks that are good . 
  i hope you can see what i mean when i say - `` that '' does work , it specifies that criteria a thing needs to meet for the statement to be true of it . 
  `` which '' does n't do work , it adds information that is indirectly relevant to subject but does n't define it . 
  also bear in mind that people use this incorrectly all the time but this is how it 's meant to work . 
  i think it 's only maintained in rhotic accents because in non-rhotic father and farther are homophones . 
  it becomes easier just to say further and not have any confusion in non-rhotic . 
  i know that in the uk the only people who differentiate are language professors and actors and such . 
  in germany in some places the pub is attached to the bloody church !, 
  come friendly bombs and fall on slough , it 's not fit for humans now ? 
  nope . 
  britons just say `` got '' where an american would say `` gotten '' . 
  gotten sounds strangely oldey worldy too us , although it still survives in some turns of speech like `` ill-gotten gains '' . 
  i do n't actually need tips i am a native english speaker . 
  i just think it 's dumb to even try and say it when sikth is fine and putting - s and - th together like that feels so forced . 
  to shame me too , except when she was about 12 in parent trap , in my defence i was 11 . 
  i remember liking her more than buffy after a time . 
  telling a depressed person to cheer up is callous , but telling them you believe everything will be ok in the end is n't a bad thing , even if they do n't believe it themselves . 
  i despise people who say honey , thank god it 's not really used in the uk . 
  why was it worst ? 
  give us dets, 
  i do n't . 
  if we had technology to develop sentient ai we could easily develop robots that could handle all the household cleaning and chores that would be no more sentient than a roomba . 
  i do n't see why anyone would want a sentient ai to do the cleaning , judging you if you masturbate ... 
  kein problem . 
  pg tips ? 
  does n't that still make you a ponce ? 
  get yourself a yorkshire tea box !, 
  haha ok , some of those i knew already , like `` helfen '' not `` hilfen . 
  i also know that adverbials of time do n't go at the end of sentences , that was just a slip up writing like it was english . 
  some things i can never understand . 
  for example : -, 
  to me they both seem like subordinate clauses so why do the verbs go at the end in one and not at the other ? 
  what 's the difference ? 
  also why is it . 
  `` aber es ist sehr schwierig '' but `` heute ist es 29 grad '' , why does the `` es '' and `` ist '' reversed in one and not the other ? 
  is there a rule for this ? 
  forget about questions i already understand that , just not the rules for other reversals . 
  when to use `` wie '' and when to use `` als '' , i 'll read the article you linked and see if i get it . 
  edit : do n't get it !, 
  if wie is used when things are equal , how is deutsch equal to englisch if deutsch is more complicated !, 
  zomg how can you not know ice age was after fallen empires ... like seriously ? 
  omg ... who does n't know that ? 
  what planet do you live on ? 
  earth to / u/gantothes , earth to / u/ganthothes ? 
  is your brain on vacation ? 
  even my grandmother would know that .
