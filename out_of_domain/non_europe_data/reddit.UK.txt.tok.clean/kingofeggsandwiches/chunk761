  do you hate each so much americans , and care so solely about your own shit that you ca n't make allowances for other people 's doggos ? 
  i realise she 's nuts , but in much of europe you 'll find dogs in restaurants and bars , nobody cares . 
  i mean if you went to a dinner party and that person had a dog you could n't freak out , so why now ? 
  of course it 's different if that dog is getting piss , shit , or salvia everywhere , but a well trained dog is safe to have around . 
  too many americans are grossed out by the dumbest shit , a low gross out threshold is certainly an unbecoming and common character over there . 
  utilize is closer to make use of and not just use . 
  it suggests a degree taking advantage of what is available rather than just puttibg smthg into use . 
  we must utilise all available resources has a very different sense from we must use all available resources . 
   you ** r ** language is pretty easy to learn , at least ** , ** from my experience . 
  it ** ' ** everywhere ** , ** so you just get used to ** the ** sound of diff ** e ** rent words and it ** ' ** s not difficult grammatically ** . 
  apostrophes are n't necessary then ? 
  trust me i 'm in the same boat . 
  the brexiteers do n't give a fuck . 
  they do n't even live in reality , they live in a daydream that they 're the centre of in which all that matters is the opinion of white british salt of the earth types and everyone else can fuck off . 
   no it was n't . 
  you can listen to sounds as well as `` the '' sounds . 
  in fact , your `` edited '' sentence interchanges the singular and plural by saying , `` the sound of different words . '', 
  different words have different sounds , you can not listen to a singular `` sound '' of many different words . 
  you 're wrong the there . 
  we talk about the sound of cows in a meadow , we do n't talk about the sounds of cows in meadow . 
  it 's completely correct . 
   it 's annoying and you 'll probably mess something up yourself . 
  i just did it because he was boasting about how easy it is grammatically . 
  well you can do that if you want , but it makes the reader think you mean the different sounds they can make e.g barking , yelping , snorting etc. 
  google has over 200k hits for `` sound of different words '' but only about 100k for `` sounds of different words '' . 
  that 's the magic of complex , nuanced language like english . 
  when you communicate with another fluent speaker different minutiae of meaning can be expressed with minor things like the presence or absence of an - s . 
  a language which is really no simpler than any other language as we all have to find some way to express the same thoughts anyway . 
  given the vast wealth of literature , scientific and philosophical thought , and historically significant text that exists in the english language , rivalled by few other languages frankly , you 'd think people would n't be in such a hurry to call it `` simple '' . 
  but sure , nod agreeably when people who consistently drop articles , incorrectly conjugate verbs , destroy the syntax , and use about 3 of englishes plethora of tenses tell you how `` simple '' the language is . 
  that 's your prerogative . 
  see my [ other comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/710zxw/i_forgot_how_hilarious_i_love_lucy_could_be/dn84ss7/ ) . 
  it 's not just that book . 
  `` sound of different words '' is far more prevalent than `` sounds of different words '' . 
   they are completely contextually different , and you failed ( continue to fail ) to grasp that . 
  i grasp is far better than you 'll ever understand , and it remains a fact that in this context `` the sound of different words '' makes a lot more sense . 
  if i say i love the `` sound of spanish words '' i mean the subjective impression . 
  if i say i love `` the sounds of spanish words '' i mean i love the phonemes that make up spanish . 
  the guy i responded to did n't mean he learnt the phonemes that make up the english language ... he meant he learn the sound of the words i.e. 
  the subjective impression each word made . 
  the cow example was just to refute your argument that `` you can not listen to a singular `` sound '' of many different words . '' . 
  i guess you just belong the set of dullards who think morphological form is all that matters . 
  yeah , because you 're a pissant who 's way out of his depth . 
  care to explain why `` sound of different words '' gets way more hits on google than `` sounds of different words '' does ? 
  all this to defend the poorly constructed sentence of someone who 's labelling your language as `` simple '' ( which is pure / r/badlinguistics fyi ) . 
  oh yes , because it 's fine for people to go around talking about how `` easy '' and `` simple '' a language is when they ca n't even form a decent sentence without a bunch of mistakes . 
  normally , i 'd totally agree with you . 
  it is ignorant and arrogant to snarkily edit people 's grammar on reddit . 
  but if they 're going to call it easy while making the kind of mistakes that even teenagers have grown out of e.g. 
  dropping articles , then they those rules no longer apply . 
  of course , if you want to feed foreign linguistic prejudice towards english , go right fucking ahead . 
  otherwise you should acknowledge that those rules cease to apply once some starts boasting about how easy your language is . 
  thanks for the patronising psa . 
  good enough for the job does not mean it 's unnecessary . 
  oh i heard about this . 
  i believe he also fed a cat to an atm . 
  we do n't have hoa 's in europe and we do n't fucking want them . 
  they are an american abomination and a force for evil in the world . 
  rich people and fat people have something in common here . 
  [ relevant ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9tdcgmbefm ), 
  the people in government are elected . 
  the people in the government attended respectable universities . 
  they will make a rule that affects millions of people . 
  local busybodies are pensioners looking to fill their lives with meaning . 
  i know on which side my bread it buttered . 
  depends on so many other factors . 
  from what i 've heard in asia they just expect to be able to point you in front of the class and set you off teaching from a set course following a book . 
  they do n't expect you to do huge amounts of prep or any marking outside of the class room . 
  teaching like this higher contact hours are possible because it 's not demanding . 
  still , 42.5 ca n't be the contact hours , you 'd destroy yourself trying to do that . 
  well this is depressing , but the article has a point . 
  the career prospects of the job are incredibly limited . 
  i 'm sure all language teachers have met weird people who somehow manage to function in the role , despite minor mental health issues or substance abuse problems . 
  language schools and in company training firms are exploitative as fuck and basically pay a fraction of what the client is paying them for doing pretty much fuck all aside the marketing and administrative side of things . 
  plenty of the teachers i 've met in tefl are pretty thick with very little language awareness . 
  of course , it 's natural for new teachers to be a bit ignorant of many of the linguistic features of their native language that might confuse non-natives , but the ones who do n't ever address this are either incredibly lazy , thinking they can just phone it in every lesson by virtue of being a native speaker , or too thick to master the abstract thinking necessary to understand the language in the concrete fashion that might help a struggling student . 
  i lucked out a bit and found a position at a quasi-respectable institution ( not a language school or in-company training firm ) . 
  had i not , i doubt i 'd still be in this line of work and probably would 've already gone back to university or at least taken a crappy full-time job . 
  there 's only so long someone can run around a city teaching apathetic people in offices who clearly have limited english simply because they do n't want to integrate english into their daily life in any sense or form and think by sitting in a class for 1.5 hours a week they 're entitled to sudden improvement in their capacities . 
  that said , we 're still basically wage slaves with no job security : contracts are signed on a per course basis , you have no way of knowing your income in six months time , and there 's very little continuity to the learning process . 
  the only difference is that you 're treated with a bit more respect by the students/staff and you get more money per hour . 
  i hope i 'm gaining useful skills in some sense or form . 
  the challenge of teaching young students ( 18 - 25 ) is enjoyable and avoids that hassle of dealing with cynical middle age types ( at this point i feel that in most cases if they were going to become proficient they would 've already ) or children ( too many complications ) . 
  it 's also great to have the opportunity to gain language skills . 
  although , constantly working with english is definitely not the most direct route to that . 
  personally , i 'm looking at furthering my education to allow me to switch to teaching something i find more interesting . 
  i 'm sick of being a 2nd class teacher working around people people paid 1000 euros for 12 hours work a week . 
  of the language teachers i 've met , many seem to fall into similar categories : you 've got your rich older types who burned out of what they were doing before , but have enough money saved to be set for life and are just doing it because they see it as a low stress job that can earn them money on the side before they claim their fat pension , you 've got those who are younger but surprisingly well off who are just doing this a job safe in the knowledge that when their parents die they 'll get their hands on a fortune , you 've got your housewives who wanted to go back to work now that the kids are a bit older and are just really supplementing their partner 's income , you 've got the younger 20 something who just want to live abroad and need an income , and finally you 've got the older 20 somethings and early 30 somethings who just have n't quite found their way in life yet . 
  sadly i 'm amongst the latter . 
  tax rates overseas are lower, 
  statements like this are what makes this sub annoying as hell to be honest . 
  i 'm pretty sure it depends on which country you 're working in and which country you 're coming from . 
  the assumption that tefl consists only of young american graduates teaching in se asia is fucking boring . 
  pick up a damn book on linguistics . 
  grammar is like the sacred cow of tefl . 
  lots of employers want it , but so few of the people hiring have a enough of a clue to actually be able to talk about it . 
  if i were hiring people the first thing i 'd ask them is the difference between coordinating and subordinating conjunction . 
  if they look at your with a blank start , then what place do they have teaching grammar . 
  especially if they 're more advanced students . 
  i 'd be very careful mate .
