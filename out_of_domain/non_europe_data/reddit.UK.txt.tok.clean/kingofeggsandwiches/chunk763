  is their any explanation for this phenomenon ? 
  why are so many people able to hold a tune but are n't musical in the truer sense of the word ? 
  i 'm not talking mispronunciations but legitimate ways other people might say words that you find irksome . 
  bit of variation from the norm today with an anecdote . 
  so i went into a bar today to use the cigarette machine ( in germany where almost all the bars have one ) . 
  the barman tells me it 's downstairs by the toilets . 
  so as is totally customary in this part of the world there was a toilet attendant sitting at the bottom of the stairs . 
  you 've got to have some respect for these guys because naturally the job sucks as you 're cleaning toilets all day in a busy tourist packed part of town , people unleashing last night 's beer and currywurst mid way through day trips trying to pack in every sight in the city left right and centre . 
  so i go to use the machine and i 've only got a 20 euro note on me which is too big for the machine . 
  so i ask him ( in german ) whether he has two tens to change the note . 
  he says yes and gets a wad out from his back pocket and shit you not at the bottom was the wad was the distinctive green that could only be dollar bills . 
  i asked if that was american money in and he was like yeah , and went on a bit of a rant about how today they 'd had loads of american tourists through , and how many of them do n't tip and some of them think it 's ok ( or funny ) to leave him dollars on the tip plate . 
  it 's crazy how americans , from a nation that is known for tipping and ca n't understand the crazy parts of the world where tipping is n't a big deal , seem to not think it necessary to tip these guys who clean up their shit ( quite literally ) , and also solid proof that some americans tip dollars in countries thousands miles away from any country where that is legal tender . 
  like paying for water in a place where you 're sitting around taking up the space of a paying customer ( and in the case of some americans two spaces ) , tipping the guy who makes sure it 's hygienic to relieve yourself is a step too far for some americans .

  [ different states are like different countries ] ( http://np.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/396m4d/how_to_distinguish_an_american/cs19tne ), 
   americans differ greatly from coast to coast . 
  compare people from la to ones from mississippi for example - huge difference . 
  or new yorkers to texans - night and day . 
  [ muh diversity ] ( http://np.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/396m4d/how_to_distinguish_an_american/cs0zrtx ), 
   how does one choose a stereotype when it comes to americans ? 
  we are one of the most diverse country in the world . 
  it really makes no sense to me .

  [ europeans are obsessed with america ] ( http://np.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/396m4d/how_to_distinguish_an_american/cs0yt04 ), 
   all i hear is hate about the americans . 
  and then when i visit family in the us , i do n't hear even a mention of europe . 
  a lot of europeans seem to just try and always be better than america ( at least online , always trying to gain that upper hand ) , whilst america does n't even think about them .

  would i be right in saying `` that 's a bingo ! '', 
  feel free to try and beat my score i 'm sure there is more to be found !, 
  and why ? 
  i 've been playing for a few weeks now and i 've found that now it 's relatively easy to survive in pleasant valley ( playing voyageur ) . 
  as long as i can get a gun and ammo then it seems very easy to live off the land around the farmstead , you can also quickly loot most of the buildings in the zone within a few days and then i never really need to leave the house more than a few hundred metres . 
  i can survive there for a month or two easily . 
  i almost wish there were a mechanic that would force me to move zones or something other than boredom / running out of ammunition . 
  i usually just sit there until i 've crafted some of the craftable clothing and then move on to coastal road to inevitably die from a wolf attack . 
  i know the game is about exploration but this seems to clash with the fact that once you 've got a good thing going needlessly travelling offers little reward and a lot of danger . 
  maybe i 'm just a coward , but i just ca n't justify abandoning my secure cosy home grounds . 
  the only time i die on these play throughs is if i make a bad decision when trying to acquire the mats for a wolfskin coat / bear skin rug . 
  imo it would be good if there were some more long term elements like zone specific loot that you would eventually need to stock up on during a long play through . 
  both serious and funny answers are welcome . 
  so i 've bought some new usd evo 2014s , and they 're a pretty good fit overall . 
  however i like many people suffering from having slightly different size feet . 
  my left is 9.5 and my right a perfect 10 . 
  with shoes i just wear 10s but a bit room on the left does n't bother me when walking . 
  anyway i 've bought size 10 skates and feel pretty comfortable ( my feet are average width ) i 'm also aware that they need to be worn in a so the liner really shapes to my feet and the boot softens up a tad . 
  but i 've found that if i remove cardboard insole from the right it fits just as perfectly as the left . 
  so , is this a good idea ? 
  i wo n't be damaging the skate or losing anything in doing this ? 
  just wanted to check . 
  it seems to be made of ordinary cardboard like material and not offer much in shock absorption or anything . 
  so i 've just got done reading `` harry potter and the methods of rationality '' . 
  i elected to read it after it was recommended to me by some people on reddit in response to some of my musings about rowling 's harry potter books that i 'd absent-mindedly posted . 
  i 'm currently re-reading the hp series a second language for practice which got me thinking about the books . 
  before i started this re-read i 'd only read each harry potter book once before , back when they 'd originally been published ( i started when only the first two books had been published in the uk , actually reading `` the chamber of secrets '' first for some reason , long before film deals and such were on the table ) . 
  i have to confess that despite liking the hp series quite early on before it achieved worldwide acclaim i never considered myself an hp fan . 
  as a kid , i enjoyed them immensely , to the point that i 'd buy them as soon as they came out and read them cover to cover . 
  however that did n't make me a fan in my eyes , it just meant they were good books , once i got to the end i 'd put the book down and not think about them until the next one was out . 
  another confession is that i know nothing about fanfiction , it was n't a word that existed in my vocabulary until maybe a year or so ago , and even then i 'd only heard about it in the context of mockery . 
  from what i understood , fanfiction was just angsty teenagers living out personal fantasies in badly spelt , ridiculously written , shit posts on forums . 
  the idea that there might be even halfway good fanfiction out there just did n't occur to me . 
  after all , good writers , capable of constructing good narratives , were also capable of creating their own universes in which to set them , or at least that 's what i previously believed . 
  in fact , the only reason i think i even read hpmor was because it simply did n't seem like how i imagined fanfiction to be . 
  it had its own website and i was able to download a pdf of the finished `` book '' straight away , which helped a lot since i do n't really have the patience for reading off websites and requiring an internet connection every chapter . 
  anyway , now that i 've read hpmor i 've got to say i was pleasantly surprised with it . 
  if i had to sum it up in two words i guess they 'd be `` disorganised genius '' . 
  that 's not to say that i found it to be an utterly flawless piece of either writing or storytelling , but nevertheless i 'm really impressed . 
  one thing that struck me is long this story is , at as guess i 'd say it was three times longer than the longest harry potter book , which makes it so long i 'm not even sure it could be published in a single paper book ( at least not without some ridiculously small biblical font size ) . 
  i wish someone had warned me about this because my strategy of reading obsessively cover to cover and then walking away did n't really pay off . 
  it took me a week to finish and definitely reduced my productivity during this time more than i 'd care to admit . 
  another thing that struck me was how irregular the structure of the narrative is . 
  being used to ordinary novels with an ordinary structure i expected a clear beginning , middle , end style and a normal story arc ( even if a story has a twist that does n't mean the arc is n't `` normal '' ) . 
  to me , hpmor seems like 4 or 5 story arcs within a meta-arc .
