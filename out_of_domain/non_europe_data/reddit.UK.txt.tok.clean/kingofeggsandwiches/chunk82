  if it was just a scary demon it would n't be an issue , maybe slightly in bad taste since it looks so much like a children 's toy with the `` beautiful music '' and anime girl on it . 
  but really it 's not cool to have child demon girl cutting herself . 
  if i saw that when i was a child it would 've fucked me up wondering the fuck it meant . 
  self-harm is a pretty serious issue amongst kids and teenagers so it 's really not nothing to depict it in that way . 
  instead why do n't you learn about time zones . 
  shut up , colloquially it 's known as gmt . 
  they have a national day of mourning this sunday . 
  they do n't actually observe the 11th . 
  damn colonies . 
  my three bird roasts always had a pheasant in there somewhere . 
  you know the germans , they would n't want anything to disrupt the working week !, 
  you should watch series 1 episode 1 of black mirror . 
  ... and if you think berlin is expensive you should try munich . 
  in germany they have the volkstrauertag , a day of mourning for everyone that died . 
  i do n't think it 's a bad thing to remember the wars . 
  it 's not about remembering the individual people but to remember the tragedy of it and sacrifices made by people regardless of whether the reasons for that those sacrifices were justified . 
  it 's only bad when people use it as a celebration of warfare , rather than a tragic reminder as to why such things should never be permitted to happen again . 
  because doctors . 
  everywhere in the world doctors form their own little cartels . 
  they also all assume that the medical schools outside their own country are inferior and teach the wrong things . 
  it is slowly changing thankfully , but it always suited doctors to keep it in the family otherwise their pay could decrease from people training elsewhere in the world and coming to their country , and even native people going abroad to study and coming back . 
  best advice , a relationship is like a fart , if you have to force it then it 's probably shit . 
  this is good advice for farting as well as your love life . 
  never force a fart . 
  you are the epitome of stupidity in america . 
  you pay barely any less tax than us . 
  having guns is fucking useless . 
  you live in a delusion . 
  americans doing british accents fuck up everything and sound like dick van dyke so i consider that a compliment . 
  i 'd just mastered eich\u00f6rnchen and then my friends introduced me to this . 
  it 's not . 
  americans always make this mistake , the only people that say secta are cockneys . 
  it 's sectuh , with the same - u sound as in `` buck '', 
  who says secta ? 
  ( cockneys only ) it 's sectuh if anything . 
  americans just mix up all the vowels with diphthongs and vice versa , it 's like they are just doing it to annoy us . 
  americans always use the `` big alphabet letters '' ( diphthongs instead of pure vowels ) when there is no call for it . 
  so - ee and - ay and - oh and - eye . 
  research becomes reesearch . 
  patriotic becomes paytriotic . 
  yoghurt , nope yohgurt . 
  iraq ? 
  this does n't bother me by itself but then when it actually comes time to use the diphthongs they decide not to !, 
  prohgress ? 
  nope prog-ress . 
  no data . 
  nope nich, 
  it 's like you 're deliberately doing it backwards to troll the british . 
  no it does n't . 
  it does n't anywhere in the uk . 
  cum-fort-ta-bel is a mispronunciation not a regional thing . 
  that 's pretty much standard the world over . 
  not an american thing at all . 
  he also used thy and thine though , writ for wrote , constantly used past imperfects for the past participle , and wrote his lower social class characters in his local warwickshire dialect . 
  err we do n't do that . 
  in british those words are ideeuh , chinuh , indiuh . 
  this is because in english , vowels get reduced to a schwa unless they are stressed . 
  it 's a very common feature of germanic languages . 
  - er at the end of words is also reduced to a schwa but that 's not the same as adding an - r to words ending in - a. 
  i do know that but i did n't want to use any technical terms to explain it . 
  yeah . 
  to us you sound like you 've forgotten all the vowels apart from - a. mary , marry , merry often all sound the same . 
  caught and cot often sound the same . 
  job sounds like jaab . 
  it 's a funny old thing accents . 
   how do you say it ? 
  pat-tree-ot-ic ? 
  pa-tree-o-tic ? 
  pat-tree-ot-ic , but a number of young people have picked up the americanised version these days . 
   so what , you say it like `` cost-uh rica '' like some sort of filthy savage ? 
  that was a bad example because it 's a place name i guess , yoghurt is a better one . 
   i 've heard americans say both ways when referring to something that 's moving . 
  same with data . 
  in fact , i do n't think i know anyone that pronounces `` data '' like `` datta '' . 
  i think these are about 50/50 . 
  i 've heard a lot of yanks on tv saying datta or dahta . 
  i 'm not an expert on os design . 
  but i never had a problem with windows 7 , it was the natural successor to xp . 
  i loved both oss and knew them like the back of my hand . 
  unless you 're talking about a donkey i think you 'll find . 
  modals *, 
  except there 's a reason why the schwa is in brackets so no it does n't, 
  i really do n't no what you 're talking about . 
  do you mean a rhotic - r or what ? 
  i 've never heard a single british person add a rhotic - r to a world like china , most of us are n't even rhotic speakers . 
  cool story bro . 
  [ when did scotland join the union ? 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_the_petroleum_industry#modern_history ), 
  yes but it 's a mistake . 
  the 3 syllable one is the more prevalent pronunciation in the uk , and also the proper rp one [ source ] ( http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=j6fmagaaqbaj&amp;pg=pt122&amp;lpg=pt122&amp;dq=comfortable+three+syllables+or+four&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=knr6h4tokl&amp;sig=v2xyrm-du7dtebvsrl14za-9oku&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=kkhjvip_eit9pn26gjai&amp;ved=0cfaq6aewbw#v=onepage&amp;q=comfortable%20three%20syllables%20or%20four&amp;f=false ) . 
  [ cambridge has it correct here if you listen to the example ] ( http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/comfortable?q=comfortable ), 
  he has n't confused the two i assure you , he 's just mistaken . 
  the three syllable one is also more prominent in standard bre . 
  here 's the guru john wells on the [ matter ] ( http://phonetic-blog.blogspot.de/2011/05/comfortable.html ), 
   main pron , bre and ame \u02c8k\u028cmft\u0259bl\u0329, 
   secondary pron , bre \u02c8k\u028cmf\u0259t\u0259bl\u0329, 
   secondary prons , ame \u02c8k\u028cmft\u025abl\u0329 , \u02c8k\u028cmf\u0259t\u032c\u0259bl\u0329 , \u02c8k\u028cmf\u025at\u032c\u0259bl\u0329, 
  in my experience john wells is never wrong  seems that carr 's work is incorrect on ame though . 
  ah ok , but that 's only happening when you have words that end in a vowel followed by another vowel , it wo n't happen if you say words in isolation . 
  it 's also more like adding an - r to the start of the following word than putting it the end of the word ending in a vowel .
