  i was aware there is some difference here and that 's where the old freedom to and freedom from notions come from , but still seems quite ridiculous what this guy is saying . 
  there are also plenty of laws in europe governing the right to search , officers must have reasonable articulable suspicion and so forth , but he makes it sound like police in europe can just do as they please which is completely wrong again . 
  actually yes since i know some people who were there , and whilst i 'm not really into all their protesting they are all regular students , not militant violent activists , not one of them would assault a member of staff as was suggested . 
  in reality the security guards tried to physically force them out the building , which is totally illegal i 'll add , and in resisting the security guards decided it constituted assault . 
  the police turned up and without a moment of investigation into what actually happened went in to break up the protest . 
  the protesters were n't even aware that the police were there on the grounds of investigating assault when this all happened . 
  when the protesters asked the security about the police when they saw their van outside they were told the police were there to deal with a separate issue . 
  this was complete collusion between the police and corporate security with the aims of breaking up a peaceful sit in under false pretences , absolute bullshit and a real black mark on the reputation of one of the uk 's leading universities which historically had left leaning ideals . 
  sit ins of this nature are fair frequent occurrence there and never have i heard of anything like this . 
  well i know that is not the case in the uk . 
  they need to show reasonable articulable suspicion , which is pretty much the same as probably cause , it may even be more stringent than the rules in the us . 
  have n't been pulled over in germany yet so do n't know . 
  he 's good . 
  he should now go and spend a year or so ruthlessly going around the comedy circuit until he 's really good . 
  then go to the uk where he can make good money haha , stand up comedy in the us is hard to make a living from . 
  if i was going to be critical , i 'd say it 's one thing to raise the roof with a good crowd , but a true mark of talent is someone who can break a bad crowd . 
  also his timing and delivery could be more precise . 
  right now he strikes me a highly talented amateur with good material , not a professional yet but i 'm sure he could make it with experience . 
  twist : they 're actually going to the dentist opposite disney land . 
  not really , the original necknominations started as just doing dumb stuff like downing a pint of guinness with a bottled of tabasco in it , kinda stupid but harmless . 
  it was the idiots who ruined it trying to out do each other in the quantity and strength of the booze that did it . 
  i 'd rather not live in the 3rd world thanks !, 
  come on now , it 's nice that they 'll get some help with his business and all but why are you crying . 
  he 's not saving impoverished children he 's selling a product for a profit , and now it 'll probably sold for a lot more to a wider range of people . 
  i do n't understand how anyone can cry over capitalistic success . 
  i 'm sorry but capitalism necessitates the profit of one person over another . 
  it 's nothing but a necessary evil for the function of society . 
  if anything about this is sad then it 's that this man , who naturally and instinctively does n't want to exploit his fellow man by selling his product at a high margin , will now most likely be having his product sold by greedy profiteers only interested in squeezing the last penny possible . 
  look at the faces of disbelief the rich investors make when he says he only wants a fair share , it 's because they are devoid of the natural moral attitude towards business seeing only the bottom line . 
  if there 's nothing immoral about profiteering why does this nice man naturally not want to sell his product at a higher price ? 
  this video does n't make me cry , it makes me sad that every one of these salt of the earth folk , whose intentions are only to improve the lot of those they know with their inventions , will have their companies taken over by those who care only about maximising profit margins . 
  i 'm happy the guy has finally seen some recognition , but i 'm not going to cry or feel emotion over him being on the receiving end of what is nothing more than a self-interested action of which he 's on the end . 
  i 'm not anti-capitalism , it 's the best system we have , but to glorify this as anything more than two self-interested individuals finding a mutually beneficial situation is egregious . 
  the glorification of capitalism as inherently moral is sickening . 
  good response . 
  we should ignore the truth about capitalism so we can all wear plastic smiles like the people charging as much as they can merely for the means of our survival were doing us all a massive favour . 
  ok but is what bill gates has done good because of capitalism or despite it , because it seems to me that latter . 
  no one forced him to be philanthropic . 
  anyway i do n't hate capitalism and i 'm glad this guy will hopefully finally earn a decent crust , but ultimately call it as it is , capitalism is n't beautiful in the way charity or sacrifice is , there 's no point getting all weepy about it , it 's self interest and nothing more . 
  well it depends , are you doing more good with the service/product you provide + your philanthropy than that which you take from the people from which you profiteer ? 
  why do so many successful people start out trying to make a killing and later change tact and become philanthropists ? 
  it 's not black and white , and that is why i 'm not anticapitalism , but i 'm not going to get soppy or sentimental over someone achieving their capitalistic aims . 
  sure it 's nice to see someone who seems like a decent person succeed , all i 'm saying is let 's not lose our heads here , essentially this is nothing more than a business deal . 
  not something to be sentimental about . 
  i appear to be getting mad downvotes here , and i can only assume that some people are so indoctrinated with capitalist shite that they believe a person who offers a good product achieving monetary success is a noble and beautiful thing on par with someone making self sacrifice for the greater good , which saddens me . 
  the only noble or beautiful thing i see here is how this inventor did n't want to raise to profits too high for the benefit of farmers , something that will no doubt come to an end now he has been invested in by these so called `` sharks '' . 
  hearing that people shed a tear over someone doing well in business makes me highly uncomfortable and fear that people have elevated capitalism from a necessary evil to a religion . 
  general american is an accent . 
  it 's not the absence of anything . 
  it just happens to be an accent , making certain sounds with your mouth , that his shared by a lot of people in a lot of geographical locations across america . 
  go to any other english speaking country and your accent will stand out like crazy . 
  it 's not pedantry . 
  it 's fundamentally ignorant to claim that one does n't have an accent merely because one does n't have i highly regionalised way of speaking since it fails to acknowledge that english is language spoken all over the world and therefore one can never be truly neutral . 
  what the fuck is an elevator ? 
  you mean a lift right / s,

  so do n't say you have no accent , it 's straight up ignorant ... ? 
  what 's funnier is the us actively does all it can to prevent this . 
  they fucking love pretending they 're the new british empire of old , policing the seas etc. 
  did i say that ? 
  i just said it 's ignorant for anyone to say `` i have no accent '' , it shows a lack of self-awareness . 
  it 's not what i think , it 's what 's necessarily and absolutely true . 
  good night . 
  when i thought white americans could n't get any more retarded , i read this post and it gave me cancer ... :(, 
  two types of people , father christmas and ordinary folk , got ya !, 
  no , they 're saying `` you are a wanker '' , you 're saying `` you arrrr aa waankarrr '', 
  what 's wrong with drinking beer on the train ? 
  many trains i 've been on sell beer . 
  it 's an electrically assisted bicycle . 
  basically nothing more than a bicycle for old people who find it hard to pedal . 
  since it still requires physical action of move it i doubt it could be categorised as a mobility device . 
   this year in history , we talked about the failure of democracy . 
  how the social scientists of the 21st century brought our world to the brink of chaos . 
  we talked about the veterans , how they took control and imposed the stability that has lasted for generations since . 
  we talked about the rights and privileges between those who served in the armed forces and those who have n't , therefore called citizens and civilians . 
  mobile infantry reporting , hoo rah !, 
  the northern irish might have a problem with that ... it 's like telling the us to give puerto rico back to spain , the puerto ricans might not be too happy ... 
  actually they did pretty much . 
  if america had waited a bit they could have peacefully obtained independence as the opposition party strongly supported the notion . 
  furthermore taxes equivalent to the british ones at the time were soon introduced after the revolution . 
  as for taxation without representation just ask the inhabitants of washington d.c !, 
  federalise the eu !, 
  europa will rise again !, 
  to be fair there 's no fucking `` o `` s in color either . 
  maybe we should all compromise on culur, 
  it 's such a misnomer that british people like doctor who , we do like the old doctor who because it 's kitsch and nostalgic , but the new ones are n't extremely really popular like sherlock or anything . 
  if the rest of the world did n't like the new doctor whos so much then i doubt it would be considered a success . 
  you would n't eat [ this ? ] ( http://www.nathankramer.com/cookbook/file/spotted-dick-1.jpg ) ... 
  that 's right , tell me how good my spotted dick tastes ... 
  ages beats size every time i 'm afraid , you 're just the arrogant teenager who 's drinking protein shakes and lifting every day , we 're the wise sensei with the long beard who beats you for not using your chop sticks right . 
  and we have random buildings lying around that are multiple times older than the declaration of independence !, 
  multiple !, 
  i believe many of those bombs were american made !, 
  anyway that 's what you get for invading your neighbours !, 
  but that 's what i 'm saying . 
  i do n't dislike it but it 's not considered amazing or massively popular . 
  i agree some episodes are decent , some are shite , that 's exactly it , it is n't considered to be really good and it 's not unmissable in the slightest . 
  pretty sure the british is / \u02c8k\u028cl.\u0259 / at least in standard southern british and general american is / \u02c8k\u028cl.\u025a /, 
  british imperialism - making you speak english way before it was cool . 
  ruled the world for a good while , i 'd call that wise : ,
