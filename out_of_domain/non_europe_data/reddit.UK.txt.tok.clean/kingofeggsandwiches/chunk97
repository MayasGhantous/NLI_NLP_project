  i eat steak tartare all the time and never get sick ... 
  us has more cases of salmonella from eggs i think . 
  you 're so glad you have worse tasting eggs that do n't last as long and higher rates of salmonella from eggs ? 
  lucky you ... 
  absolutely can do . 
  now can we talk about why the channel tunnel is so damn expensive !, 
  i would like to use it more often but it 's usually cheaper to fly ... 
  i 'm afraid the world does look to britain very often for the basis of a sound and reasonable society . 
  they copy our laws , implement governments based on our democratic system , use our military tactics and financial policies . 
  you should see how brits are treated in hong kong by the people there . 
  america might lead the world innovation wise but people certainly are n't saying oh i wish we had a nice reasonable civilised society like america , everyone thinks they 're fucking nuts . 
  you 're going to have to try harder . 
  i 'm sorry there 's no point being reasonable with someone filled with irrational hatred like you . 
  [ how about reading this new york times article about how much more successful the city of london is than wall street and why international finance does n't trust america ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/04/magazine/how-london-surpassed-wall-street.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 ), 
  here 's a quote for you . 
   london is the world 's financial center . 
  needless to say the whole world 's legal , financial and social matters the world looks to the uk . 
  more business is still done in london today than anywhere else in the world . 
  the world of business and finance actually trust the british legal system not to merely favour the homeside unlike the us courts . 
  scotland wanted to leave because they 're highly left leaning and a long way from any centres of financial interest in the uk ( i.e the south ) , thus many believe since they have oil and little else , 5 million people , they could build themselves a little socialist utopia like norway . 
  the only thing that mattered a damn in the grand scale of things was the military installations in scotland that would 've cost billions to move . 
  having a referendum is absolutely not indicative of a nation 's success . 
  many people in bavaria want to have a referendum too but does that mean germany is doing badly ... 
  but seriously go on telling me how the uk is n't leading the world , i bet you 're one of those yanks who believe the sensationalist nonsense about sharia law and muslim invasions too . 
  you are fucking hilarious honestly . 
  firstly ok the word is anglophile . 
  secondly , norway has a population with 5 million people and is oil rich , exactly the same as scotland , do n't expect large nations to live off one natural resource that 'll probably run out before the end of the century . 
  now as for your hilarious points . 
  `` spy cameras '' - surveillance cameras ( for those of us who managed to get through university ) have been massively successful in reducing crime and catching those responsible for them . 
  the vast majority of them are not being observed in real time , but massively drive down insurance costs for business owners and assist the police when needed . 
  funnily there is no `` anti-camera '' culture in the uk at all , most people having realised what a benefit they are . 
  violent `` soccer '' matches - excuse me are you from the 1980 's because it sounds like you are ? 
  football violence has practically been eliminated in the uk thanks to highly effective policing tactics ( even without guns ) , you 'd have to go to russia or somewhere to engage in football violence in the old days . 
  despite this , a few hooligans punching the shit out of each other whilst drunk was hardly a major social problem even at its peak , hardly comparable to having whole cities of abandoned houses without water supply is it ? 
  binge drinking - this is n't even a serious problem and it 's hilarious that you think it is . 
  sure there is minor issues in some cities with anti-social behaviour but it 's not like anyone 's being murdered by the police now is it . 
  whilst the consumption of alcohol on a regular basis may offend north american sensibilities it 's also a country heavily influenced by archaic puritanism that also circumcises its youth because someone once thought it would stop masturbation , wo n't allow teenager to have sex until 18 in many states and has politics based on religious homophobia . 
  please if there 's any countries leading the world right now it 's germany and the uk when in comes to large nations with mostly sound policies in various areas . 
  the uk when it comes to facilitating international finance , the justice system and investment , germany when it comes to the growth of industry , social policy and supporting the eu . 
  ` they are book smart but they do n't have common sense ... ' ah the ego protection of morons the world over . 
  funny trollz manz , dank memez too , we 're all going to take you serious from now on . 
  seriously / u/xvampireweekend all you do is talk bollocks and try to shit on europeans because of some weird inferiority complex . 
  come on now . 
  everyone says cunt in england , you 're not making anyone uncomfortable ya cunt !, 
  dry masturbating compared to what ? 
  underwater masturbating ? 
  pardon is lower class , aristos say `` what ? '', 
  your friends are just prissy, 
  shower *, 
  you 're to be deported forthwith, 
  because we do n't care . 
  if we 're really only asking if you 're dying / being pursued by assassins / about to jump off a bridge . 
  if you 're getting sick you 're still ok by the standards of the question in this sense . 
  i hate you , you 're killing my flow bro ... 
  tell your wife to grow a set, 
  you should eat it like that in a fancy restaurant , that is how italians eat it . 
  otherwise you 're good . 
  so you 're the barbarian in pizza express picking it up with your hands ... 
  you must live in america ... 
  ah the french farewell, 
  because what we are really asking is `` is something seriously seriously wrong ? '', 
  or `` are things within a tolerable level of shitness ? 
  '' , if i said `` how are you ? '', 
  and you said `` terrible , a family member of mine was just kidnapped by isis '' i 'd be sympathetic . 
  if i say `` how are you ? '', 
  and you say `` hmmm , i 've got a bit of a cold coming on and the water pressure in my house has got a bit weak '' i 'd be thinking ` what a self absorbed arsehole ' . 
  the answer you are looking for is `` not bad '' or `` could be worse '' ... this tells everything we need to hear , we know you 're not elated but the details are insignificant . 
  if you 're average just say `` fine , thanks '' and if you 're feeling good say `` great '' . 
  to me it seems presumptuous of you to think we are asking for that type of fine grained information of your state of wellness . 
  if you are otherwise fit and healthy , not suffering any great problem of bereavement you are by necessity `` fine '' . 
  but we do care , we care that you are not having a major trauma , it 's nice in a way . 
  that 's what we humans do , we look after each other when we can when each other have serious problems . 
  we do n't give a shit about each other when you stub your toe or have a case of the taco shits . 
  i 'm afraid that 's your own cross to bear . 
  occasionally we do say , `` i 'm in a bad way '' , and because this is an unusual response it signals to us that it 's important and usually people will try and help you out . 
  it 's not the frequency of this happening that makes the question worth the breath , it 's the significance of it when someone responds with something other than `` fine '' or `` not bad '' . 
  you 're basically breaking the rules if you mention trivial problems when someone asks you `` how are you ? 
  '' , because it 's a cue for assistance , and then you mention something minor which makes you seem like an egotistical idiot who thinks other people care about your minor issues . 
  you 've got to realise that words are not always literal , where i 'm from it 's common to ask people `` you alright ? '', 
  which is probably a better way to phrase it but it 's still the same meaning . 
  maybe that 's some kinda of cultural difference because `` how are you ? '', 
  i 'd only ask to an acquaintance , because it 's expecting a response . 
  with people who i do n't really know i use `` you alright ? '', 
  which does n't even expect a response , apart from maybe `` yeh , alright '' . 
  it 's really just how humans check with each other that there 's no immediate threat or serious problem going on . 
  as in `` you alright ? '', 
  `` no there 's a tiger in those bushes '' . 
  like a bawhs, 
  i do n't have to give too much of a shit about tips because i 'm fortunate to live in a country where everyone gets paid a decent wage and nobody 's living relies on the guilt factor . 
  because there are other forms of english than the one you use ? 
  if you want my `` whilsts '' molon labe . 
  here are some examples ... why say `` often times '' when you can just say `` often '' , why say `` most of the people '' when you can just say `` most the people '' , why say `` fell off of the table '' when you can just say `` fell off the table '' . 
  it depends what you grew up with , now stop being an arsehole , ( yes arsehole ... not asshole ), 
  `` this is a picture of my cat and i. '', 
  is a technically wrong ( standard grammar speaking ) hyper-correction . 
  whilst is a valid word used all over the world , some of us differentiate between `` while '' meaning a length of time , and whilst meaning during or `` on the other hand '' ... 
  maybe he comes from one of the hill billy places that retain some british styles , like pronouncing `` ate '' like `` et '' and saying `` i reckon '' for `` i believe '' . 
  no need to judge man . 
  apparently a lot of people take their shoes off in the house , which i was brought up to see as barbaric unless you 're relaxing in private and simply want to not be wearing shoes . 
  doing it for alleged hygiene was barbarous,
