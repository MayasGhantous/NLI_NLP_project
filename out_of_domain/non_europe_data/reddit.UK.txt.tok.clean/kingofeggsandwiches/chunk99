  if all you can see is the women being portrayed this way then it 's in fact you who is the sexist shit . 
  the whole thing was a fake by the bulgarian prime minister to try and look heroic as far as i 've been told . 
  this was great , but should n't they keep the heart and tongue for eating ? 
  ~ ~ english speakers ~ ~ americans * if you guys would stop saying ay for a that would be great ... fyi there was never anyone called aydolf hitler, 
  so when are we seeing a 1080 ? 
  was n't very funny sadly, 
  well that was unbelievably shite, 
  not australian, 
  the guy does n't even have an aussie accent, 
  those two girls in the bottom left can circlejerk me any time !, 
  20 bucks says you have a leg/neckbeard, 
  america needs to eat more lamb , why do n't you eat lamb ? 
  no you owe me 20 bucks cuntface, 
  le reddiot us military cirque le jerk hue hue . 
  i bet that 's what most modern invasion forces looks like , guys jumping out of planes , nothing special about this . 
  another popular drinking song of 19th century british men ? 
  why none other than the score to the american national anthem, 
  actually the song started during the 7 year war not the revolutionary war , it was sung by the british to the allied militias to wind them up . 
  no one seems to have got this completely right so here goes . 
  yankee = american , doodle = fool/simpleton ( low german : dudel ) , dandy = young man with fashionable aspirations . 
  macaroni was from the slang for the `` macaroni club '' , not a real club but rather a term for when affluent young men went on the grand tour ( a world tour rich young men would do to become more cultural ) and came back obsessed with italian high fashion and culture . 
  such men were then said to be part of the `` macaroni club '' , this owing to the fact that macaroni was a popular italian food they would acquire a taste for whilst abroad . 
  the song is not a revolutionary song but rather harks from the 7 year war with france where both british regulars and american militias fought together . 
  the british held themselves in higher regard than most of the american bumpkins who often were n't professional soldiers and being of humble origins had little contact with european high culture . 
  the british made up this song to wind up their allies in jest . 
  suggesting that this imaginary yokel american fool had aspirations above his station , believing that he could jump on a pony stick a feather in his hat and suddenly he 'd be `` macaroni '' , i.e. 
  as fashionable as the wealthy youths who would be labelled as in the `` macaroni club '' back home . 
  it was n't until later during the revolutionary war that the americans began appropriating the song for themselves , partially because its so catchy and the lyrics did n't really matter and partially to mock the british in a `` ha ha we do n't care about your jibes and we are proud of our hopeful naivet\u00e9 '' kind of way . 
  i once heard a guy pronounce niche `` nitch '' , route `` rowt '' , croissant `` cruhsaant '' , worst of all he insisted this was the proper pronunciation !, 
  not until noah webster changed it ... 
  yeah i know , i was just trying to draw a comparison between american 's massacring of french words with some people 's massacring of spanish ones . 
  you guys think it 's funny to say `` jal-a-pen-no '' but readily say `` cruhsaant '' which seems equally ridiculous to me . 
  niche is a french loan word , therefore it 's pronounced neesh , route is a french loan word , therefore it 's pronounced like root . 
  croissant is a french loan word and the closest approximation is kwason . 
  all these supposed valid pronunciations are no less ridiculous than saying jal-a-pen-o is the point i 'm making . 
  why should anyone pronounce jalape\u00f1o the spanish way and walk around like a douche ? 
  what 's the difference ? 
  why do n't you pronounce the `` h '' in herb ? 
  that 's rather french douche if you ask me too , what 's the difference ? 
  actually i 'm being the opposite , i 'm making the point that it 's more or less arbitrary whether words are pronounced in accordance with their foreign phonology or the speaker 's native one . 
  therefore someone saying `` jal-a-peen-o '' is n't any reason to lose faith in their abilities in their native language . 
  just drop the french - r and you 're good . 
  `` kwa '' like in `` quack '' , `` son '' like in `` song '', 
  ok but go to other parts of the english speaking world and you 'll find that people saying jalapeno incorrectly more frequently ( although less so now with the prevalence of mexican chains restaurants ) yet you 'll be laughed at for using the anglicised pronunciation of niche , route and croissant . 
  same applies when you call the composer wagner `` wag-ner '' instead `` vahg-nuh '' and the composer chopin `` chop-in '' instead of `` show-pan '' i 'm just trying to make the point that it 's all relative , europeans are very close to france and germany but a long way from mexico , the opposite applies to many americans . 
  i did n't say you did n't , i was responding to his point by saying croissant pronounced in a closer to the french fashion is close to english too . 
  which is point i 'm making , what 's common in your neck of the woods , and therefore what sounds funny or silly to you may not be the case in other peoples ' . 
  do n't judge peoples ' intellect by their pronunciation . 
  indeed , and what you consider the great revolutionary war where you kicked the british 's arses is considered by many historians to be merely a sub-conflict with the napoleonic war . 
  and yet jalapeno correctly is n't douchey and saying it incorrectly is stupid apparently ? 
  ok but what 's to say other wo n't considered you a douche for saying jalapeno correctly , or dropping the - h in herb , or the - t in fillet . 
  there 's absolutely no reason to think it 's douchey except the fact it seems have become a consensus in some corner of the world . 
  * cough * national anthem, 
  enjoy prison , also this is the uk ... 
  no he does n't . 
  this guy is brummie and that guy was east end cockney , they 're about as similar as new york and boston ... 
  it 's birmingham , one of the roughest parts of the uk . 
  til us can not into glorious european road safety, 
  we do . 
  indicative : i go , you go , he goes , we go , they go . 
  subjunctive : i go , you go , he go , we go , they go . 
  indicative - he goes home . 
  subjunctive - i suggest he go home . 
  sorry i got confused with 1812 and could n't be arsed to edit . 
  itt : grammatical rules people know are incorrect . 
  seriously though , one i rarely see observed is the `` she is faster than i '' one about comparisons wherein you drop the verb . 
  not many people still do that in my experience . 
  sounds ridiculous to me . 
  common use . 
  i 've saw is wrong though ? 
  virtually only native speakers make these mistakes , because would 've and should 've sound a lot like would of and should of . 
  yeah it 's only been around for like 400 years . 
  for me they 're pronounced differently too , which makes it more confusing . 
  no shit :p but saw is n't a past participle so i 've saw is just as bad as i seen . 
  first legitimate response to the question i 've seen so far !, 
  no , it 's bre vs ame, 
  nope , different style guides suggest different methods . 
  personally i prefer to add an extra - s if it 's a singular word that ends in an - s , and merely use an apostrophe when it 's a plural word with a possessive . 
  charles 's motorbike, 
  the dancers ' meeting, 
  this not only adds clarity but also reflects pronunciation most of the time . 
  i think this one is becoming more accepted , it 's stupid there 's no contraction of `` there are '', 
  do you realise x and i can be equally as wrong ? 
  jill and i went up the hill . 
  they gave the award to me and jill . 
  i suggest that he ** go **, 
  god ** save ** the queen, 
  may he ** live ** long and prosper, 
  is it necessary that we ** be ** here, 
  i recommend that he ** join ** us, 
  i think it 's both . 
  afaik it 's the subjunctive mood since it 's irrealis , and it 's the bare infinitive form of the verb since it follows a modal verb , i think it 's actually `` may '' that 's in the subjunctive mood here . 
  no that 's poppycock . . we 're not speaking german ( despite the fact in german it 's actually dative `` weh mir '' ) , the fact that `` woe is me '' is in hamlet and the king james bible should clear that up for you . 
  `` to be '' behaves like an ordinary transitive verb in english . 
  furthermore what you 've just said is just wrong , `` me '' is the pronoun for the direct object in english . 
  `` i '' is the subject . 
  this means that when you say ... 
  `` this means that both nouns are the direct object . '', 
  it does n't support your suggestion that ... 
  `` the correct way to say it is `` woe is i '' . '',
