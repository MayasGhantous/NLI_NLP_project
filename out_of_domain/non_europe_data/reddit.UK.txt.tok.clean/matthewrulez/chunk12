  thought i 'd let you chaps know about / r/totalwar, 
  there is a picture of spartans killing germanic barbarians and athenians killing celts , but i do n't care, 
  it 's # 45 on steam , and this activates through steam . 
  for the sleek campaign mechanics , the fast paced but great battles , for the epic music , for the great artwork , but mostly for the voiceover guy, 
  empire had great battles , as did napoleon . 
  well i am playing on easy ( my first proper game ) and the arab ai had * no * resistance when i invaded . 
  i took those provinces and then 10 years later attacked again ( holy war cassus belli ) and managed to annex them in about a year . 
  in the process of that :p, 
  edit : i have somehow converted the majority of their provinces to the one true faith , and only one province is rebellious - also i have inherited the throne of england, 
  is this eb ? 
  oh cool , it looks great , thanks . 
  oh right !, 
  i did n't realise i did n't like them . 
  tell me , what are my favorite films again ? 
  do i like watching this tv program ? 
  you could save in napoleon , too ? 
  where in lancashire ? 
  never heard of that where i 'm from . 
  it 's an unsolved mystery of the universe, 
  it does n't make much of a difference to gameplay once the gong has been ... er ... gonged, 
  i mean , sure , i can see if you 've brought the only thing that i would consider `` cheap '' in matchmaking - donderbusses and mounted gunners - but once the game starts it does n't make a blind bit of difference . 
  the least they could 've done is buy him a new tent , for fucks sake, 
  if it was n't for france you 'd still be in the glorious empire . 
  dirty peasant . 
  brazil 's nice , quite powerful and good resources . 
  but on total war , the * relatively * fast paced battles mean they are very hard to actually make much use of , and the fact that they are 60 men with shitty shooting stats . 
  for flanking it 's easier to just use light infantry . 
  i only find they have use when used inaccurately , ie shooting on horseback, 
  the whole point of total war is that once you press end turn on the first turn , it 's your own path . 
  no-dachi samurai can be used well , i have 2 that i regularly use in my army composition to charge when the infantry is closing in , to be followed by the katana samurai who will mop them up . 
  i have 3 upgrades on each , all 3 on charge . 
  for the katana sam i have just melee attack upgraded as i have no use for charge as the no-dachis job is to do that . 
  i am not a great player , but i 'd say that no-dachi are good in certain games but if you get them caught out or use them ineffectively they can be a huge waste of 1000 koku . 
  i 'd say use them sparingly and only in larger fund battles . 
  i do think the charge has made a difference , sometimes my guys kill 50 guys in a charge lol . 
  if you 're unsure , just try it out , it 's not going to cost you anything unless you are really bothered by your w/l ratio . 
  i do use them against non-traditional armies , however they are not very good at charging head on ( for obvious reasons ) so i tend to use them less often and try to flank instead of using them as a spearhead . 
  the charge bonus is not as good when against these armies as if you get a charge on without being mowed down it will be less cost efficient than charging katana samurai in . 
  in those battles i try to get powerful nagi and katana cores into the melee asap as fots players tend to forget about melee and focus on trying to outgun you . 
  ashigaru work great at absorbing volleys and the naginata sam have great armour so use this to your advantage and rush his main line . 
  if london 's gone , it 's looking bleak . 
  is it any good ? 
  thanks . 
  i 'm the guy that asked him how the book is . 
  his answer was nice and concise , i did n't ask for a book report . 
  also , this post is good , because now i have another book to read !, 
  if you want to make a change , do it . 
  do n't complain about other people * not doing it *, 
  wow , today 's `` what total war do you want '' has fewer wwi suggestions than usual . 
  i 'm proud of you , / r/totalwar, 
  it 's a bit like saying `` why is n't napoleon in medieval 2 ? '', 
  or `` why is there no ~ ~ vickers machine guns ~ ~ fgm-148 javelin in empire ? '', 
  my god, 
  as much as i do n't like pom , it 's good to see an impersonator go down . 
  did cringe when he said the balance meter `` did n't take into account skill level '' though . 
  do n't be the dick who spreads out his line infantry . 
  it 's stupid and unfair . 
  also , if 5 out of the 10 players on your team are artillery , do n't be artillery . 
  you do realize , within the total war community , this guy is * the * rome total war commentator ? 
  he has something like 2000 videos on youtube , it would n't surprise me if there were not more that 60 imitators . 
  forgetting his attitude in terms of what he does on his channel , he claims he is some god of total war who is `` undefeated '' and although he is an alright total war player , he really is n't the best . 
  but because there is a large fanbase for him he believes he is the greatest whereas there a far better tw youtubers , but with little following . 
  [ heir of carthage ] ( http://www.youtube.com/channel/uczlnshkh_exh1wbp9p-ypdq ) is not the best player . 
  he is a good shogun 2 player . 
  but when he loses ( and lose he does ) he takes it as an opportunity to show his mistakes and he is well aware of what he did wrong . 
  he does n't have this god complex that pom does , and is very modest about his game . 
  operating system ? 
  computer specs ? 
  implying the schlieffen plan was successful, 
  can we stop memes ? 
  please ? 
  take order , rename it stalingrad , wait for eternal battle for that city . 
  he 's wearing a turban, 
  there is a palm tree in the background, 
  yeah that was really a shot in the pitch black, 
  so no one should buy or use anything , because they were once used by slave owners ? 
  also , if you are not a fan of any ancient ( or later ) civilizations , ** why the hell are you on / r/totalwar **, 
  edit : you do realize `` spartan-113 '' is a reference to halo , do n't you ? 
  please , tell me you do, 
  whereas you are at the peak of human moral condition, 
  depends really , he wo n't know what he 's missing if he does n't play . 
  like one time long ago , i got a lego set for christmas ( it was huge ) and on boxing day we were going on holiday , but i still started to build it and all through the holiday all i was thinking was about the lego . 
  when i say `` fan '' i do n't mean literal go-to-the-stadium-cheering - `` spartaaa '' - fan , i mean like . 
  i said nothing about glorifying . 
  your rebuttal makes no sense , i asked, 
   so no one should buy or use anything , because they were once used by slave owners ? 
  so unless you have a response for this , i suggest you give up and admit to being a bit of a nutter . 
  ** edit ** also , case in point , do you own anything made of cotton ? 
  cotton was once made by slaves , yet you 're not glorifying slavery . 
  the armour looks cool . 
  no way to deny it . 
  do you know what else looks `` cool '' ? 
  nazi insignia and uniforms . 
  you have to admit , they did a damn good job at that . 
  but i am not a nazi and do not advocate the mass murder of millions of jews and minorities, 
  lol * brazil at least has its own culture and viable bonuses and unique units, 
  some great ones there : `` poland can into space '', 
  possibly my favorite episode of any tv series ever . 
  episode 4 `` private plane '' of blackadder goes forth . 
  what is this contributing ?
