  i 'm not even joking here , this exact thread comes up * every * tuesday . 
  it 's incredible , as if it were planned . 
  ~ ~ what ? 
  france starts with the bourbon flag , then if you have a lower class revolution it goes to the current flag of the french republic . ~ ~, 
  ~ ~ if it does n't have another revolution of course it retains the flag of the republic , i do n't know what you mean there . ~ ~, 
  no , i 'm just entitled to my own opinions . 
  are you trying to be funny ? 
  well i do n't understand why anyone could be so ignorant . 
  i do n't really feel like i have to justify *** my opinion *** , especially on a little app like this . 
   you are a god damn fucking retard if you want to buy this game , and i will gladly come knock some fucking sense into you if you give me your address , you stupid ass fuck . 
  i am beyond mad right now . 
  creative assembly had no say in this , confirmed by will ca . 
  it was steam who lowered the price . 
  medieval 2 , or rome for that fucking squalor shit, 
  i like it . 
  the problem is that when i was new , the matchlocks were not nearly as cost effective , so it was easy to overrun a veteran army with just loan swords and yari ashigaru . 
  nowadays the most powerful armies are the matchlock/mounted gunners that we see today . 
  not strictly true , there is a small chance that the army of the ai will turn into a rebel army , but the majority of the time the ai 's armies all disappear after all their provinces are taken . 
  maybe they 're in the same situation as me , someone still at school who does n't buy his own food , but has to buy his own games etc. 
  well most of the articles i read say that it is kind of a historical scenario or battle . 
  i thought it was starting in 270bc - one of the new screenshots shows a picture of the campaign map and the date says around 255bc, 
  yes ? 
  upgrading mine specifically for rome ii , but hopefully battlefield 4 as well :d, 
  irish ? 
  she was leader of the iceni tribe of england , around the area of norfolk . 
  ( i believe , and so does wikipedia ) . 
  in game she speaks welsh though . 
  yes it is , it 's actor kevin mckidd , but here he is with his co star in hbo 's rome . 
  i thought these threads were reserved for tuesday ... 
  how did you know ? 
  it 's kind of prevalent in napoleon , but in shogun it would n't work at the same level . 
  i mean , it gets better , and in empire and napoleon it works to an extent , but it 's still not * great *, 
  yes . 
  shogun is much more streamlined and very different to napoleon , and the same for napoleon to empire . 
  but the difference between ntw and etw is minimal . 
  ntw has smaller map , and less choice of what to do , but ultimately has better gameplay in most people 's opinion ( not mine , but i love empire ) . 
  empire is huge and the vast scale makes the gameplay more fun for me . 
  i have a mid-range computer , and i have literally had about 2 crashes on empire and only a tiny amount of minimal bugs in my 374 hours of play time . 
  * edited to seem more coherent, 
  i literally laughed out loud . 
  it was brilliant on shogun ii , getting a not so trusted ally to waste his troops and get them slaughtered while weakening the enemy by just letting them attack without help . 
  you ... are ... a. ... complete ... twat ... 
  but archers still take a fifth off the health of a helicopter gunship ... 
  i think it 's `` addictive '' because i really , really like it . 
  it 's just brilliant . 
  pop the difficulty up to prince or king before giving it up entirely . 
  i have lots of the people who i regularly see round here contributing tagged as / r/totalwar , these being 2 of them . 
  well because in the time periods of empire everyone ** was ** using the same tactics and infantry in europe . 
  so i do n't see your point . 
  and in shogun , it was the same deal , in sengoku japan , most of the armies employed by the diamyo were made up of the same types of units , aside from the odd takeda fire cavalry etc. 
  short answer : yes, 
  if you have activated a game on steam , you ca n't gift it . 
  i 'd say the 670 will last you a long time in terms of how well it will run games , and the processor is very good . 
  not an expert though . 
  to answer your first question, 
   are you really saying a storm of arrows would n't do any damage to a helicopter ? 
  even if , somehow , magically , they managed to hit the helicopter , the one arrow that does - or even 1000 arrows - would not do much more than a scratch . 
  so yes , i am really saying . 
   some of that is for gameplays sake, 
  i know , that 's why i was having a little joke about it . 
  thanks , 
  the ikko-ikki , whose rise to power and glory had been the result of not so much their military prowess , but rather their huge armies of peasants who rose up to defend their faith , had experienced unlikely success in japan . 
  within 10 years of the first war against their rival clans , the ikko-ikki along with the ikko faith had spread to encompass the area around kyoto , spreading from coast to coast . 
  this achievement was attributed to the strange successes of mobs of armed , unfearing ashigaru of the ikko against the armies of the like of the lesser clans , such as the hattori , and the bessho . 
  the generals and leaders of the ikko-ikki were given basic guidelines to follow in attack ( or defense ) : the front line of yari ashigaru hold the enemy in place , whilst the bows of the ikko rain onto them . 
  once the spears are tired and weakening , a second line of loan sword ashigaru charge into the enemy , swarming them and cutting them into pieces . 
  this battle plan had been used to high success for many years , and the ikko war machine was yet to be stopped . 
  but then , at a field just outside of kyoto , the ikko-ikko army met their match , in the form of an army , lead by the daimyo of the hojo clan . 
  pulling back to a hill , the ikko deployed in their usual formation , expecting the same results . 
  but this battle was different . 
  they were equal in numbers - this was not unusual - but the enemy had not an army of peasants . 
  the hojo had an entire army of well disciplined and deadly samurai . 
  nevertheless , he ikko general assured his men of victory . 
  the first wave of katana-armed samurai hit the ikko spear wall . 
  almost immediately , the effects of this devastating charge were felt as many hundreds fell to hojo blades . 
  the spear wall did stand , however , and many hojo samurai fell to the yaris . 
  but after hours of fighting , both generals were forced to commit all troops . 
  the loan sword charge was not as successful as previous battles . 
  both sides continued to charge and slaughter each other , and the battle was looking to be a hojo success . 
  however , in quick thinking , the general himself and a unit of warrior monk cavalry , elite forces only used when in dire need , were sent to strike at the back lines . 
  this caused mass routing as hojo katana samurai were no match for the general 's blade . 
  as the last of the hojo retreated , there was no victory . 
  although the hojo had run , and would not threaten the safety of the clan for many years , the ikko-ikki had not won . 
  they had not only lost thousands on the bloody field , but the battle showed a new breed of army - those of elite and well disciplined units - had come about . 
  the time of the ikko-ikki massed ashigaru was no more . 
  by the way , i have you tagged as one of the / r/totalwar crew , 
  yeah , i wrote this massive story for internet points . 
  why not just do these as a weekly challenge kind of thing , like / r/civ does . 
  good challenge though . 
  yes , 
  you legend, 
  keep the twc autistic historicity out of this place , please . 
  if this 'd happened to me i 'd have gladly given him my 47 dota 2 keys . 
  he does mention america a few times , 
  dude you 'll get so downvoted for posting such controversial opinions round here, 
  they threw 3 , when i thought they were only armed with 2 . 
  annoyed me more than it should have . 
  [ whenever you are sounding a cavalry charge ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=af5nhmiyeqi&amp;list=plgmpvrtbxii92js3-scqwhegn3sudzzd6&amp;index=2 ), 
  because , if you know * anything * about it , it was n't about britain `` taking over the us '' , far from it . 
  i do n't see any american football teams winning the premier league !,
