  brilliant, 
  nothing on earth compares to the dark brotherhood in oblivion imo, 
  they did n't shoot from horseback in reality , iirc . 
  dat resolution, 
  the original xfm shows with karl are literally the funniest things i 've heard . 
  the more he 's been pushed doing things , the less funny he has become . 
  there is no way you could do this, 
  really ? 
  i mean , no offence , but they are statistically one of the worst units in the game . 
  they 're destroyed in melee by every other cav , they 're incredibly slow , and not really worth the cost . 
  * oh god please be trolling *, 
  how is marketing an overpriced product for normal price and saying it is a sale illegal ? 
  it is technically on sale , but the sale prices are the same as average prices for that product anyway . 
  i would love it, 
   just people in my age group dont understand, 
  you do realize that makes you look like an `` edgy '' 12 year old, 
  9th for us , 12th for rest of the world . 
  oh yeah , like the time you came into wwi right near the end and claimed victory ? 
  or the time you , after getting the skies cleared by the raf and the atlantic by the navy , helped the war in the allies favour ? 
  touch\u00e9 . 
  i played it , it 's a great introduction to empire and it 's very fun . 
  lefter than conservative though . 
  i 'm not arguing , sorry , i do n't really know what point i was making . 
  me ( takeda ) , hojo ( friend ) and the satake ( friend 's vassal ) ** vs ** yamanouchi ( in the fort . ), 
  but when you finally kick the filthy corpse of the germans into the dust , you get really proud of what you accomplished . 
  really good campaign . 
  that 's exactly what we did , we let the satake run their entire army in , and get slaughtered , and then just won without taking more than 100 casualties each . 
  me and my friend are planning on a sparta + athens co-op , with me taking the economic and naval side with athens , and sparta doing the heavy lifting when it comes to land wars . 
  why are people not `` allowed '' to be successful ? 
  if a song 's shit but people buy it , good on them . 
  how *** i *** deal with natives :, 
  * line up infantry, 
  the end . 
  damn , i spent ages looking for that guys house . 
  i did n't get any of the battle , only a few of the aftermath : http://steamcommunity.com/id/tradingmatt/screenshots/?appid=34330&amp;sort=newestfirst&amp;browsefilter=myfiles&amp;view=imagewall, 
  he has a key to `` ulberth 's house '' as well as one to war-maidens . 
  smaller but smoother, 
  not a very well written article . 
  incite revolts , and try and stir up relations between either you and your allies or your allies and their friends . 
  sabotage buildings and cause unhappiness to try to cause rebellions . 
  but realm divide will eventually come , so you 'll have to backstab or be backstabbed . 
  m8 it 's fucking nearly 25 \u00b0 c , way too hot to go outside, 
  i feel it should be on the sidebar , it 's asked so many times, 
  yeah , i thought about doing that . 
  what we 're used to is 11 months out of 12 being overcast and about 55 \u00b0 f , and an 80 % chance of drizzly rain, 
  if you were british you would understand, 
  it 's a common british thing to complain about the weather , whether it 's hot or cold . 
  i ca n't speak for every briton , but i feel a nice temperature is around the 21 \u00b0 c mark, 
  it 's silly though , most of my achievements for empire do n't register - 386 hours and 5 achievements . 
  if you group them by pressing g , you can select each group by pressing the numbers, 
  every time it 's gone on sale , it 's been 75 % off . 
  so wait . 
  why is this on wtf , and why is it a screenshot when, 
   read the rules . 
  no screenshots !, 
  where are you from ? 
  i agree with caught in the act being number 1, 
  this really belongs on / r/civcirclejerk,

  maybe because they are n't finished yet, 
  every other month a patch is released for multiplayer , and it balances/unbalances lots of units . 
  recently the craze was using matchlock/spear armies mixed with mounted gunners for the most annoying gaming experience i have ever had . 
  but crappy battles . 
  total war is using the campaign to fight battles , paradox games are purely campaign map . 
  i would n't call lionheart a multiplayer expert , but i love his campaigns . 
  i am excited now . 
  depends what you like , really . 
  rome and medieval are obvious , but empire takes place between 1700 and 1800 , and napoleon takes place between 1805-1812 . 
  shogun 2 is 1560s japan , and fall of the samurai is 18 ( 60s ? ), 
  japan . 
  ^ such ^ salt, 
  catherine the great ? 
  both incredibly powerful leaders who brought success for their countries . 
  i agree with you , memes and mfw etc. 
  do n't have a place here . 
   empire was glitchy, 
  was being the key word, 
  winston churchill 's overrated . 
  victoria for sure though . 
  really ? 
  because i 've played ~ 500 hours of empire and experienced little to no bugs . 
  at least it does n't crash to desktop whenever i tab out . 
  the ai , in fairness , is not great , but if you think it 's any worse than the medieval ai then you 've got it wrong . 
  have you ever played a siege on medieval ? 
  and have you played shogun 2 ? 
  nice work . 
  i 've completed 4 on co-op , can never finish them on singleplayer . 
  he did n't do great things for his country though , like bismark . 
  sure , he oversaw a nazi empire that took most of europe , but after 3 years it was demolished and germany was plunged into shit . 
  i never said he did n't do anything good , i just said that he left germany a wreck . 
  that 's america . 
  in the uk there 's security but nothing on the scale of when a us president does a speech . 
  everyone needs it, 
  seriously ? 
  it 's like a month old , and you 're on a subreddit where every tiny piece of news is posted . 
  plus , to see if it has been posted - check . 
  as txtbus said , as long as it sells , it will continue to sell .
