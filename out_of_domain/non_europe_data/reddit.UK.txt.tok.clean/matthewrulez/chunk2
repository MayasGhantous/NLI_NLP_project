  i will think about this , thanks - this is unfortunate that i am going out for 2 hours now , will be back later and i 'll make my mind up, 
  i already own a copy of civ v , sorry . 
  i would really like the napoleonic wars , that 's mainly why i am coming here . 
  if i get no offer for that or a change my mind , i may want to . 
  shogun 2 is so smooth , gameplay wise . 
  i love it . 
  i am not a big fan of rome , but everyone seems to be so i would recommend trying rome first before buying it . 
  is that offer still up ? 
  trade confirmed, 
  a game company who has worked hard on a brilliant game trying to make money by putting previously preorder bonus clans on sale for a pound !, 
  what 's next , they charge us for expansions ? 
  corporate fat-cats , all they want is money ... 
  i do n't care at all . 
  in fact it 's more of an inconvenience than anything . 
  that 's the summer olympics anyway . 
  the winter ones are awesome . 
  yes he is , i do n't know why . 
  you can do it in rome ? 
  thank you !, 
  and yes , in the others you follow the projectile , but my empire is buggy when that happens . 
  edit : thinking about it , empire 's buggy when anything does anything . 
  and they are n't even that good - 700 kills to 400 deaths * is n't that good . 
  i only found out two days ago , i have put in 200 hours on empire and 400 hours on shogun 2 . 
  glad i can help !, 
  i do not think so . 
  i tried moving the mouse and it simply removed me from the view . 
  it is only artillery and ships that you can control , using a button on the gui . 
  but you can not control soldiers that way . 
  pressing insert changes the view to that of a soldier , not allowing you to control it . 
  it is indeed . 
  glad i could help . 
  political humour , ow yeah . 
  it 's not rome 2 , so your point is invalid . 
  well by then , trade is useless as if you 're developing the regions properly , you should be getting 2000-5000 from each province a turn anyway . 
  you insist that the germans are n't better than us at football , because we beat them in war twice . 
  heroic victories are commonplace , not that big a deal . 
  and this picture is overused . 
  if you look closely , you can see neil degrasse tyson 's face on her asshole . 
  this subreddit gets better every comment i read . 
  well if an arrow hit , the tension of the stretched out silk would perhaps at least significantly slow down the arrow before it hit . 
  you ca n't mod campaign maps, 
  ctrl + f reptilian masturbation - was not disappointed . 
  no , in the thread where one of the employees of ca answered some people , one person asked - ` is it rome 2 ? 
  or is it just wishful thinking ? '', 
  to which he replied `` wishful thinking '' . 
  also , around the time ted was announced ca said they are working on something new . 
  they are ridiculously easy . 
  it seems that everyone is expecting this . 
  imo none of the shogun 2 factions are very distinctive , aside from their 4 bonuses . 
  factions on games like empire and medieval 2 each had their own very varied feel . 
  poland - lithuania . 
  for some reason , they are the only faction in any game i have actually finished a campaign with . 
  maybe it 's the feeling of being and underdog , slaughtering the damned austrians , swedish and ottomans . 
  maybe it 's the starting position , placing you between mighty powers , all wishing for a little more land , your land . 
  or maybe it 's the *** fucking winged hussars *** . 
  i mean jesus , look at those beasts . 
  every time i read/watch sharpe , i immediately want to play napoleon . 
  then they would have to buy the rights of making a game off warner bros. . 
  not going to happen , my friend . 
  moving on ... 
  and then you exterminate your own population ? 
  just get bbq beef flavoured ... best flavour . 
  surely a unit fresh to battle would have higher morale than one who has seen the horrors of battle before .

  i know everyone hates your videos , but when i watch every one of them i am laughing . 
  i do n't think we 've met, 
  wait and see , usually dlc does go on sale . 
  not every item on steam goes on sale , you know . 
  is this real ? 
  we have as much of an idea as you . 
  i 'd like to see redguardia, 
  edit : i was making a joke . 
  i have never encountered any of these things , aside from occasional weird unit movement on empire siege battles . 
  th great war is a napoleon total war mod . 
  also there are n't trenches . 
  if you want trenches , you have to deploy barricades . 
  if trenches were set out properly , with troops not in huge blocks but rather deployed garrisoning the trenches , it would be one of the greatest mods ever made . 
  how could it . 
  think about it . 
  the western front was literally still for 3 years . 
  the campaign map would n't work , as battles were n't pitched events like in napoleonic times but rather a stalemate of troops waiting for their opponent to move . 
  battles would last weeks , not hours . 
  and 99 % of that would be sitting and waiting . 
  also , there is no way ca or any other game company could capture the essence of wwi . 
  firstly the number of troops and casualties could never be representing . 
  even if somehow , ca represented say , the battle of the somme ( which lasted half a year ) as a pitched battle , there is no way they could represent over *** a million *** casualties . 
  also the horror that was world war one was not * just * the horrendous battles , but the conditions of the trenches . 
  how a pitched battle could represent this , i have no idea . 
  decaying bodies rotting next to living troops . 
  lice , rats and diseases ripping through the morale of an army . 
  it does n't work . 
  and it does not fit into the total war series . 
  in my opinion , the latest ca could do is the late 19th century , with the rise of the german empire and the american civil war and aftermath , including the american-spanish war . 
  ** edit ** : to answer the op , leave the company of heroes gameplay/combat the creators of company of heroes . 
  exactly . 
  turn it off and on again ; the computer and steam, 
  reinstall the game off steam or wherever you keep games nowadays . 
  if it does n't work contact ca , i 'm sure they 'll do *** nothing ***, 
  what does it matter what kind of victory it says it is ?
