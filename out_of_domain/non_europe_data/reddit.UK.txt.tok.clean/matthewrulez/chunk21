  anyway , pm me about times etc :d, 
  it 's darthmod napoleon , really good mod . 
  the unit i think you 're talking about has a french name like colonne d'attaque or something , i 'll check later . 
  it has 500 men though . 
  ai milan 's job is to piss off the player in any way possible , i believe . 
  me vs tanwonder - friday 6th , around 7pm . 
  it should come on release , just leave your computer on with steam and it 'll patch it . 
  assuming you have a reasonable uk download speed , you 'd have it done easily in a few hours . 
  i have school on wednesday , so bad luck for you . 
  oh god - `` this has been milked as much as the twelve bar blues for fucks sake '' made me angry , sad , and even more angry at the same time . 
  i said the `` few hours '' thing because he is going to school . 
  it 'll probably be less than a gig . 
  aha , well fuck you . 
  yeah , went on that and saw the comments and checked you had n't posted them already . 
  it 's astounding how that video has so many likes . 
  2 days before rome ii ? 
  why not continue a napoleon play-through !, 
  here 's [ part 8 ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/totalwar/comments/1lhfth/i_dont_know_if_anyone_remembers_but_about_4/ ) . 
  i 've also noticed that every post on, 
  http://www.reddit.com/r/totalwar/new/ is downvoted immediately . 
  literally every one . 
  is this to do with reddit , or is someone just getting a laugh out of going down the new section downvoting everything ? 
  the man 's way . 
  `` fertile crescent '', 
  you can change the battle difficulty separately to the campaign difficulty . 
  so hard battles , medium campaign . 
  i think they get extra morale , nothing more . 
  however that can be a potent advantage . 
  so in 8 hours ? 
  i 'm reading rubicon too !, 
  i just read lustrum , a novel about cicero , which i loved too . 
  i do n't really have an excuse , i was too busy watching the fight , my mistake . 
  plus i do n't like having my men walk into forests , it makes it easier for me to miss them . 
  i do n't know what bug you speak of . 
  i am using darthmod napoleon though , since it is a vast improvement . 
  dude i was literally just going to say , within 2 hours there 'll be at least 10 posts called `` pullo , formation '', 
  ca said that the 9.9 gig is encrypted and as soon as it is unlocked it will unpack to become a bigger file . 
  so yeah , the 9.9 g is all of it . 
  the 35gb is just a placeholder file size to warn that you might need it with future expansions etc. 
  mainly the ai , but it also increases the unit sizes , adds the ability to play as nearly every country , adds tons of new units for each country , and generally improves the atmosphere of the game . 
  what ? 
  there 's no spoilers , not much to do with rome ii . 
  well i do n't know what he was expecting anyway , since it 's 20 hours until release and it is a ca panel . 
  i have no idea , surely people want to see what the game looks like before buying it . 
  guys , read the reviews before saying it is shit , they all got 7/10 etc and most of their issues are to do with glitches which may be patched in the release day patch . 
  chins up lads . 
  `` by themselves , none of the things that are wrong with total war : rome 2 are that big a deal . '', 
  edit : some are complaining about turn times taking up to - prepare yourselves - 1 minute !, 
  * did they ever play a total war game *, 
  i think the complaints are about how the ai has n't improved , which , honestly , i did n't expect it to . 
  mate , i 'd give empire a 9 . 
  but yeah , they are bullshit , how can you rate how much enjoyment someone will get out of a game ? 
  empire 's turn time was at least 5 minutes just for the ottomans to move 300 single units around turkey, 
  here 's a list i found on the forums , copy pasted :, 
  rock-paper-shotgun :, 
  nowgamer : 9.5 / 10, 
  gamesradar : 4.5 / 5, 
  gamesvillage : 9.4 / 10, 
  cvg : 9/10, 
  pushstartuk : 9/10, 
  electronic theatre : 90/100, 
  gamestar : 89/100, 
  meristation : 88/100, 
  egm : 8.5 / 10, 
  thesixthaxis : 8/10, 
  one hit pixel : b/a +, 
  digital spy : 4/5, 
  ** it looks a lot better with all these 9s **, 
  ** edit ** all links fixed , sorry about that . 
  the key words being `` you '' and `` someone '', 
  holy fucking shit , the graphics . 
  even if the ai is shit i will just stare at this in amazement . 
  i will fix them , sorry about that , it was a quick copy from the total war forums . 
  already explained i am . 
  before i found the big list , the 5 reviews i saw were around 7/10 . 
  now i see the average is more like 8.5 / 10 , which is a great score . 
  it is kind of open to abuse - imagine going over to greece , getting a couple of elite hoplites , then sailing over to africa to get some elephants , then over to parthia for some horse archers . 
  imagine that army . 
  yeah civ 5 24 ai late game is something else , usually takes like 20 mins on my computer !, 
  pc gamer gave it a 85 , same as fots . 
  to be fair it was satisfying wiping out the ottomans for this reason . 
  in shogun 2 you could give yourself 40 units , so it 'll probably be in rome ii, 
  in the uk you can join the army at 16 , and be out killing people at 18 , but call of duty is rated 18 . 
  it 's silly . 
  and me and / u/ksmv were right !, 
  a new record pace of 14 hours before release and we have a `` pullo , formation '' post . 
  [ congratulations ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/totalwar/comments/1lkbqo/24_hour_countdownhypediscussion_thread/cc05211?context=3 ) . 
  except there are already mercenaries , and this barracks will enable you to get the best troops from countries , not just mercs . 
  are you fucking serious . 
  god damn continentals . 
  you see that bar that says `` search reddit '' ? 
  or the thing on your browser that allows you to search ? 
  try it . 
  you live on the east coast usa ? 
  that 's 5 hours behind the uk i believe , so rome is out at about 3am for you . 
  do n't quote me on that . 
  they were pretty op in real life, 
  such humour, 
  how long did the unpacking take ? 
  mine says 2 hours - . -,
