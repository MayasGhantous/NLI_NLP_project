  i think , in my 12 hours of playtime today ( i know ) , that it 's been worth my # 30 . 
  even if the fps goes down to 15 sometimes , i do n't care , it looks real pretty . 
  and i just ca n't get over how fucking huge the campaign map is . 
  yep , they were destroyed as early as yours were in my game . 
  go check who destroyed them , if it was the minor faction beginning with q , i imagine some re-balancing needs to be done . 
  what 's your computer 's specs ? 
  great band name, 
  yeah , in my rome campaign i have fought massive oathsworn and celtic warriors and lost , and in my war against sparta and macedon they fielded massive armies of pikemen and royal spartans etc. 
  it 's around 220bc, 
  hard . 
  what year is it ? 
  i have faced a lot of armies like that , ones that i could win with just one legionnaire . 
  ( talking of that , literally 1 soldier from my first cohort managed to kill 60 of those basic celtic spearmen . ), 
  if you get too powerful or someone else does , then civil war . 
  other than that , not much . 
  are catapults worth it ? 
  not got the techs yet , but do they balance out cost wise ? 
  and what 's the ammo like on them ? 
  do n't think you can, 
  paragraphs, 
   impossible to mod the map, 
  someone made a map of the british isles on shogun 2 , so ... 
   hated empire , mainly because the ui was fucked up on 1360x768 . 
  i 'm probably going to give it another go as i like the time period, 
  the ui is fine , i do n't know what you 're talking about . 
  i have a 1360x768 moniter too, 
  holy shit is that a caterpillar, 
  source ? 
  cool, 
  they need to be fed . 
  3 dacian tribes have just united against me and pushed me back out of dacia and taken my holdings in illyria , where they did n't own before . 
  they 'll be crushed in a few turns by my 1st , 3rd and 4th legions , but still . 
  very high settings , no aa or ssao, 
  campaign map i am getting a poor 15-20 fps , in small battles i get around 40 when zoomed out and 20 when zoomed right in , and in big battles it 's more like 30 - 10 . 
  i doubt 50 000 men could survive off the farms they loot . 
  well that 's comparing 1860s us agriculture to 2nd century bc spanish . 
  you can just tab out , by the way . 
  not perfect , but it 's good . 
  yeah , happened to me a few times . 
  quite annoying . 
  what are you saying ? 
  are you asking is there anything good about rome ii , or are you saying that people should n't complain about the quality of the game they have bought ? 
  well not really , i mean if you 're making 1000 from trade that nets you 20 more a turn . 
  what the fuck are you talking about ? 
  i have a good computer that should be able to run a game like this , but it is poorly optimized and straight-up bugged - meaning i get about 20 fps in the campaign map and 15 in close up combat . 
  and 80 % of the complaints are n't even about this !, 
  go on then , what computer do you have . 
  right let 's get this sorted . 
  i have played over 1500 hours of total war . 
  safe to say , i know my shit . 
  my computer is of course not as good as what you say yours is , but neither are many people 's . 
  i could run shogun 2 on maximum settings . 
  i can run rome ii on very high , with only a few problems . 
  so it 's not really that that bothers me . 
  have you played the game ? 
  it 's buggy as can be !, 
  the ai is useless , in shogun 2 it was incredible ( relatively ) and yet in rome it does n't even know how to disembark troops , or when not to send an army of 3 men and a horse against a full stack of mine . 
  i do n't really complain about the design choices either . 
  i mean , they were done , and there 's nothing can be done about them , apart from mods . 
  but what i do complain about is things like boats flying through the ground as if it was water . 
  even if it is my computer , ** which i assure you it is n't ** , i still have ground to complain , as i was told ** by the creative assembly ** was above the recommended settings . 
  turning down the graphics does n't increase the ai intelligence and decrease the amount of bugs , mate . 
  and please , stop being a little snobby prick . 
  thanks . 
  well , in shogun 2 it realized that to win it had to actually move . 
  veneti in the alps and qidri in egypt are the biggest , but the veneti are tasting roman steel at the moment . 
  are you retarded ? 
  how would sharing the location of your file do anything ? 
  and it 's not even the right file . 
  i am beginning to think you are under the age limit of the game ... 
  you can look at the encyclopedia, 
  you can look at the encyclopedia , it 's in the top left . 
  just click it . 
  yeah , during the turn phase , i can go to the encyclopedia . 
  let me check . 
  edit : yes i can , just hover over and it turns into a cursor, 
  what ? 
  i have a 660 and ca n't play on very high perfectly . 
  it 's the cpu . 
  i like it . 
  julii , because caesar . 
  also go for hard . 
  it does . 
  he was n't there , and i have messaged him but no reply :(, 
  sssh , do n't let ca know , i am enjoying having a legion of wardogs . 
  my game wo n't advance past turn 75 :(, 
  * vomits uncontrollably *, 
  does n't work - i went back to turn 60 and when i got to turn 75 it did the same thing . 
  in my game there are only 5 factions left in europe , me , a super gaul , the suebi who are huge , an unknown spanish kingdom and the thracians . 
  so my game is quite different to yours . 
  turn 75, 
  is he not allowed to do what he wants ? 
  i do n't understand . 
  as with all greek factions . 
  dude i thought you had a titan ? 
  thanks man . 
  could you be sure it 's the ssd ? 
  thanks guys !, 
  entering , for justice . 
  i think you picked a bad picture , it looks like the romans are keeping in formation here .
