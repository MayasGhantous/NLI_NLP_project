  best version ? 
  but i agree , shogun 2 is probably the best made total war game . 
  always like that , but it 's good so it wards me off of that cesspool . 
  i 'll be playing / u/jakex28 on thursday , at around 6pm, 
  ctrl + g, 
  which i ( closely ) won !, 
  good game to my opponent , well played . 
  i have the replay if anyone is interested . 
  g is to group . 
  ctrl g locks their formation . 
  so i did answer his question . 
  * you 're * the one in the wrong here . 
  forced march is on . 
  you can ? 
  just select all of them then hover over one of them and click upgrade . 
  yes you do . 
  dude , by the time augustus came to power rome had jerusalem , gaul and egypt . 
  i do n't notice ? 
  did you look at the map ? 
  going by this logic , korea is the mediterranean . 
  go on , who 's going to stop you ? 
  it 's a rich land . 
  lots of gold . 
  i 'll yet you think about it . 
  so you 're not counting the places i said then . 
  i did n't realise all of france was in the mediterranean , as well as jerusalem , and the north coast of spain . 
  probably because they are n't . 
  i was saying that before augustus , parts outside of the mediterranean were conquered . 
  you clearly ca n't admit to being wrong , so cheerio , do n't bother replying some more shit , kk, 
  lol no it 's ridiculously powerful, 
  the obvious answer is to blockade every single coastal city asap, 
  you need to put the pike phalanx ability on . 
  if it 's a sally out , you have to defend a flag . 
  they probably captured it . 
  yes it 's shit . 
  cwb is a rule set , which i think still work in rome ii , it stops heavy inf . 
  spam . 
  do n't join a cwb game then break the rules . 
  yes . 
  yes they are . 
  yes please !, 
  shogun 2 is in my experience the most polished and well made total war . 
  single player or multiplayer ? 
  if singleplayer as rome - 1 general , 19 legionaries ( or better ) usually works to kill everything . 
  some are flat-out made up though , such as the one i had today which said '' `` et tu brute ? '', 
  - julius caesar after seeing his assassins '' when that is a quote from shakespeare . 
  as have i , but for this it did n't . 
  yeah , what the hell happened to them , and the white chocolate in heroes ? 
  now you 've pointed that out , i 'll always realise christmas is slightly worse than it was a few years ago . 
  in battles you can also just select units in the order they will appear , left to right , by ctrl clicking each one in order . 
  it 's good as i usually have a reserve line of praetorians - evocati - eagle cohort - evocati - praetorians . 
  do n't use them to fire at a line of your units facing theirs , siege units are wildly inaccurate and will probably kill a lot of your men . 
   i played etw/ntw on high settings and my computer is struggling with medium for r2 . 
  to be fair , that seems reasonable . 
  the more people , the more poor conditions and poverty there is . 
  makes sense to me . 
  i assume they die ? 
  shogun 2 had rice fields , which was basically the big flat map of that game . 
  very good video , very good tactics . 
  beta 3, 
  ~ ~ * i do n't understand why i am being downvoted * ~ ~, 
  ~ ~ you want proof or something ? ~ ~, 
  most battles on rome 1 were decided by the cavalry in my experience , in medieval ii you can not say they were n't powerful - you must n't have played it , in empire they were a bit weak and slow , yes , in napoleon they were just a bit better than empire and in shogun single player they sucked balls and multiplayer were the best things ever . 
  i 'd rather it be fun though, 
  the game says the starting position is easy , my difficulty settings say `` hard '' , 
  that 's not even my main complaint anyway, 
  edit : i should n't have to pick a deliberately difficult faction for at least a little bit of a challenge , anyway . 
  razing 's the best way to go in terms of public order !, 
  you do n't have to spend money on demolishing buildings , and people are too dead to be unhappy in a few turns . 
  you just need to keep an eye out on the razed settlements for a couple of turns , build a farm and a sacred grove , and move on . 
  i razed literally every city i captured , as it saves money and public order . 
  there are no invading fleets to kill though . 
  i might try building a few though . 
  the battle difficulty i ramped up to the top . 
  you ca n't change the campaign difficulty once you 've started . 
  i know this does n't help ** at all ** but when that happens to me i put it in windowed mode and go watch netflix or something . 
  and i realize it should n't have to come to this . 
  what 's the point of a game if not a challenge ? 
  all difficulties should offer some sort of challenging aspect , and hard should be hard . 
  i should n't have to pre-empt awful ai so i can have a bit of fun . 
  i love you and want your babies, 
  try reading more . 
  i was literally about to post it via self-post , so it does n't really make any difference mate, 
   this specific picture is neither funny nor interesting nor aesthetically pleasing . 
  well ~ ~ 20 ~ ~ 500 people thought otherwise . 
  get off your high horse . 
  i do n't want to `` reap karma '' , i was posting an image *** i found funny *** . 
  also , does every image need a huge discussion ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  `` explaining a joke is like dissecting a frog . 
  you understand it better but the frog dies in the process . '', 
  try linking to the actual image url and it 'd make it easier for us res users !, 
  but a * unique * army composition , never found velites too important . 
  it 's just that i 'd like to fight on open ground , in the proper way , as that 's the best part of any total war game in my opinion . 
  it 's not that i do n't like them , it 's just open field battles ~ ~ give me an erection ~ ~ make me happy, 
  i misunderstood , i thought you meant the actual power , not the ai . 
  no idea , the kindness of strangers . 
  as most of the soldiers do in total war . 
  nothing racist about that . 
  is n't that leopard print ?
