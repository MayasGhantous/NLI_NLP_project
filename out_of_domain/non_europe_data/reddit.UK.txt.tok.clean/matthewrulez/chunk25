  but hopefully you 'll see some improvements as they update . 
  does it * really * matter ? 
  if he captioned it `` i created this - me - not anyone else '' then i could kinda see your point . 
  @ 2.22 the guy gets hit on his shield by a small rock , goes flying back about a second after impact . 
  i ca n't watch documentaries like this , it just makes me cringe more than anything,

  throat ? 
  rightfully so, 
  this has happened in my rome campaign - the middle east is just rebels as far as the eye can see . 
  sparta and athens - me and my friend did this , very fun ( i went east , he went west ), 
  we are about to start a parthia-pontus campaign , take the seleucids on together . 
  other ideas i have are egypt and the seleucids when they are released , and maybe carthage and egypt , macedon and pontus or epirus and rome . 
  slingers were fixed in recent patch , and have you even used archers or javelinmen ? 
  they 're awful for killing anyone . 
  any sources for that ? 
  most of the major factions have good late units , the arverni oathsworn are indomitable , and hellenic royal guards and spartan heroes are a tough nut to crack, 
  rome definitely used archer auxiliaries , - that is common knowledge , and many , many sources will back me up on that . 
  just google 'd it and i came up with 6 sources for roman archer use :, 
  g. l. cheesman : `` auxilia of the roman imperial army '' , ( 1914 ), 
  jeffrey l. davies : `` roman arrowheads from dinorben and the ` sagittarii ' of the roman army '' , britannia , vol . 
  coulston , j.c. `` roman archery equipment . '' the production and distribution of roman military equipment . '' ed . 
  bishop . 
  oxford : b.a.r. 
  international series , 1985 . pp . 
  http://www.intratext.com/ixt/lat0189/_pg.htm vegetius , epitoma rei militaris , book 1 , chapter 15, 
  roman military equipment from the punic wars to the fall of rome ( paperback ) . 
  bishop , j.c. coulston . 
  oxbow books 2005 . 
  wikipedia 's great , as long as it 's backed up . 
  just because according to a forum post ** that says ancient greece ** and is one source that is hardly any evidence against people ** not ** using bows , and another that talks of a certain war where bows were banned ( ? ), 
  does n't mean there are n't countless sources etc. 
  of bows being used , as well as human intuition - would you rather be dead with a spear in your hand or alive with a bow ? 
  watch a few youtube let 's plays - there are loads and loads, 
  here 's some screenshots showing legionaries and evocati cohorts with the armour you talk about . 
  from my campaign , it 's 117bc and legio i italica are trapped in britain with no reserves . 
  in custom battles the only armoured units are armoured legionaries and evocati , so i do n't know where you 've seen the normal ones . 
  fyi there 's no ' in assyrians or babylonians, 
  you can rename generals ? 
  him and prussian prince are my favorites . 
  prussianprince seems to be a better bet for winning though . 
  i would n't know , i do n't think anyone visits lancashire on purpose, 
  i did my btec year 11 ict last year and did n't bother with all that bollocks , sat and played flash games for two years while everyone worked away - everyone ended up getting their target grades , so i got the same mark and in some cases higher marks for doing fuck all, 
  shogun 2 worked perfectly for me and my friend - but anyway are you sure that the desyncs are not actually legitimate ; as in you and your partner have trouble connecting due to internet issues etc. 
  awful editing, 
  so *** meta ***, 
  for beethoven 's fifth , i wrote beethoven 's fifth and it accepted it, 
  plus most of his army seems to be hoplites , which are utterly useless low stat spearmen in patch 4, 
  who the fuck reviews chocolate, 
  it 's not , if you read the bottom space as an f , which is what he is doing , the piece does n't sound like this . 
  you do n't deserve anything , it was your choice to buy the game, 
  that 's different to me , that 's what i would expect . 
  for me i get lag spikes , so for instance i could be zoomed on on battles and be getting 40fps and then suddenly for a brief period , 3 , and then back up to 40 . 
  this may have done the trick , no noticeable stuttering 40 minutes in !, 
  it was k in shogun 2 and k in rome 2, 
  can it beat acii ? 
  it was one of my favourite games , still is , but the sequels so far have been a let down . 
  ( brotherhood was good though ) . 
  really quite excited for this though . 
  well the person in this video does , so i wanted to show the difference in the actual melody rather that key etc. 
  besides , it sounds nicer . 
  good advice , but just to let you know it 's capital when talking about a capital city and capitol is a specific building - which interestingly derives its name from the capitoline hill in rome . 
  the punic wars ? 
  over arguably the most interesting part of roman history that would be perfect for ac - the transition from republic to empire . 
  caesar , marc antony , augustus , and political intrigue on the largest scale . 
  i 'm thinking cicero as being the new machiavelli . 
  exactly , if you want a stack of 40 of the most powerful ships vs a javelin transport , why the fuck not ? 
  [ the schengen area ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/schengen_area ) allows members of it to pass freely into other member countries . 
  most of the eu and some non-eu countries are members , apart from ~ ~ britain ~ ~ the uk , annoyingly . 
  more like ca n't draw on paint.net, 
  the queues at the airports here are usually atrocious, 
  because your army is made up of awful units ? 
  eastern spearmen are the 2nd worst in the game iirc , and they have utterly crap morale . 
  and if a unit next to you ran because half of them died , would n't you ? 
  completely vanilla , but we were testing multiplayer campaign , me as spain and my friend as britain . 
  we have n't properly tried it , we were just testing to see if it was working . 
  we 'll probably play properly today , it 's just my friend 's internet connection is wobbly and will only be fixed today, 
  that was beautiful, 
  well it is n't true at all what he said , so no need to worry . 
  sure , i 'd watch a bit of it, 
  also charging good shock cavalry into spears ( not pikes ) will usually end with the cav winning, 
  commenting for lancashire, 
  no it 's not , there 's no quicksave feature on legendary . 
  shogun 2, 
  empire, 
  rome, 
  medieval 2, 
  rome 2, 
  minecraft surely must be the most modded game apart from the source engine, 
  that does n't seem like * too * bad a chance, 
  overall , what do you think of it ? 
  and how is the stealth , if at all in there, 
  biggest flaw with this argument is the whole stomach thinking part, 
  i 'd like to be in, 
  this could be brilliant with a lot of people, 
  i know right , then the stomach starts giving shit to the intestines, 
  i have played 400 hours of empire , most of it playing as poland . 
   is there any relationship between the different phrases other factions will reply to me with and how close i am to a deal in diplomacy ? 
  which phrases correspond to which ones ? 
  i do n't really think so , not sure , sorry, 
   how much do relations matter in getting an alliance ?
