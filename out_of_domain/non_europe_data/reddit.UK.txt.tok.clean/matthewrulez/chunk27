  great , that 's nice , but *** in game *** as i was talking about , they have a higher ap value . 
  look it up if you do n't believe me . 
  ~ ~ oh , and nice to see you downvoted my comments . 
  well egyptian infantry are basically mobs with hats , so i see why you struggled . 
  i 'm next , and you have really made progress for gaul !, 
  i ca n't seem to download the file , the website just opens the page in a new tab when i press download ? 
  thanks, 
  not entirely true , there have been a few server fixes by dice, 
  now * that 's * being a dick, 
  we had a lot of hail up in chorley, 
  and my g500 !, 
  i play on high on bf4 at about 50fps with a pretty poor build compared to this - i5-2310 @ 2.9 ghz , gtx 660, 
  used some tips from you lot , and me and my friend ( hornflakes ) played a few games . 
  i did quite well and improved my stats ** a lot ** . 
  this is our latest battle report : http://battlelog.battlefield.com/bf4/battlereport/show/1/399327756822346816/884213593/, 
  he 's on large unit sizes, 
  then you realised you were on operation locker , you got shot from behind 2 walls and then you crashed ? 
  because it 's fun ? 
  first thing i noticed was the guy running up to you from the right, 
  it 's # 30 for bf4 in the uk . 
  so more like $ 50 . 
  but are they as good at medium as say , a sniper with short scope , or a longer range assault rifle , like the sar 21 , or even a lmg like the m249 ? 
  i mean come on , if you 're a standard bearer , why the hell would you have your phone on ? 
  i play in a brass band and had my phone off from around 10 !, 
  why did they do it on ms paint ? 
  i know a tengri mass murderer, 
  it was 100 . 
  in bf4 it depends on the health you revived them to , so the base stat is a measly 20 points , which is usually all you have time to revive to since the timer is so short . 
  i could get 50 points from being spawned on . 
  what i 'm saying is that there 's really no point reviving . 
  by the time i have revived someone , there 's usually been like 10 deaths anyway , and not many matches are decided by 1 or 2 tickets . 
  usually it 's down to a few hundred . 
  and my mentality is to have fun . 
  i do n't `` only do stuff for points '' . 
  i do it because i want to . 
  and at this stage of the game , if there 's no actual incentive to revive , which there is n't , then why bother ? 
  it wo n't make a noticeable difference to the outcome of the game ( unless you 're on perhaps squad rush or something ) , and it does n't give many points , which , let 's face it , is the basis of the fucking game . 
  that 's the point i missed out - the defense of `` oh they 'll fix it '' has now worn out . 
  i recommend civilization 5 wholeheartedly , it 's a really good game . 
  getting either brave new world or gods and kings dlc with it is pretty essential to fully flesh out the game however . 
  so why force me to sit and watch a clusterfuck of boats until the timer runs out ? 
  what if people do n't have the timer on ? 
  that 's not an excuse , it 's a complete lack of forethought, 
  sun tzu - `` to a surrounded enemy , you must leave a way of escape . '', 
  i 've spent more time on shogun 2 and empire in the last 2 months than rome ii . 
  dude , sorry , but my opinion is my opinion . 
  yours is yours too , i 'm sorry if this post offended you or something ( ? ) . 
  i 'm not bashing ca . 
  i 'm bashing the game , which , as you say , is two months out . 
  two months , and i would n't say this is acceptable for release . 
  maybe in a few patches , and a few more months , it will be . 
  that 's what i think . 
  `` bravery land '', 
  `` very lucky soldiers '', 
  `` big profit '', 
  i 'm from northern england and say them the same ? 
  a soft d sound , on both words . 
  woah , woah , up ` ere in chorley we do n't . 
  it is a bit shit though is n't it, 
  i 'd rather pay a quid * not * to watch it, 
  it 's not * that * bad , if you ignore the capital letters and the no spaces after commas , which is n't even grammar . 
  there 's also one spelling mistake on `` please ** d ** '' but do n't be too harsh , he is crying . 
  i 've given a fiver today at college . 
  wow , that 'd be cool if i could see the screen through all the fuzz . 
  it was in 1943 , big part of that . 
  not saying it 's reason you should know . 
  so what , you 'd rather have your government *** kill *** fraudsters ? 
  just think about that . 
  that 's fucking despicable . 
  how can a government enforce morals that it breaks . 
  it 's working for me . 
  nice one for being able to use the sniper elite - it 's the worst sniper by far, 
  must be a mistake , i doubt it comes with a 3 and a half foot model, 
  just to let you know , pompeii is the town that was destroyed by the eruption of vesuvius , and pompey was the consul/general . 
  saying the effects were overdone would be an understatement, 
  are they condoms ? 
  you mean you as in `` one '', 
  medieval ? 
  more like roman empire era !, 
  strike at karkand was my favourite map , and kharg island is easily better than 3 of the maps it 's coming with . 
  gulf of oman is the only one that deserves a space here . 
  ahh !, 
  i loved wake island before bf3 , but it just was n't as good and a lot less good looking in 3 . 
  got ta say though , have some really good memories of wake island on 1943, 
  i have bad memories of damavand , because i played console conquest . 
  really ? 
  my pc costs around # 600 and is better than a ps4 easily . 
  that 's not what i was arguing about . 
  what i was saying is that you do n't need to spend anywhere near # 1000 to have more powerful hardware than a ps4 , like the comment i was replying to implied . 
  i agree with you , a ps4 is probably a good choice for lots of people , and has lots of advantages over a pc that is n't hardware . 
  that 's your opinion . 
  same with the guy you are replying to , that 's his opinion . 
  i disagree with you , ** i think ** it is the worst total war game i have played . 
  it 's the worst, 
  my game runs at like 50fps then drops randomly down to 1-2 for a few seconds , at least 5 times a minute . 
  it is so fucking annoying . 
  it just happens randomly most of the time too , for example it 'll be smooth and fine when there 's 5 tanks exploding at once , but when i am just walking it 'll stutter like crazy . 
  the worst part is when it stutters in a jet or especially helicopter , it 'll `` pause '' and then come back , the helicopter will have exploded or hit a building , killing everyone in it including me . 
  happened to me , i rushed through to where i 'd got to , somewhere in sequence 3 . 
  does dropbox work ?
