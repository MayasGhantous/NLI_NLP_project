  i 'm willing to bet it 's an incredibly common username , especially on a valve game . 
  forget that then . 
  i 'd go egypt , and rush all the important wonders . 
  watching lps is always good . 
  heir of carthage , lionheartx10 , surrealbeliefs , diplexheated ( i think ) and volound are good . 
  well do you have gods and kings or brave new world ? 
  my friend bought civ , but instead of easing him in with settler , we made his first game be multiplayer with us 2 and him , and 3 ai , on prince . 
  it worked well , i have to say , because after one game he seemed pretty competent , though i have to say the only reason he was n't wiped off the map on the multiplayer game was because the only person on his continent was me . 
  sorry , what 's nc ? 
  is it always sunny on christmas day ? 
  pouring down yesterday , but it 's like the baby jesus told the rain to fuck off, 
  australia and nz probably hold a few percent . 
  as well as the rest of the fucking world that is n't europe and the uk, 
  got to agree , darthmod napoleon is easily my second favourite total war . 
  no , fuck people who do * this * . 
  maybe , at most , fuck this area of manchester . 
  usa vs uk on empire . 
  those uniform colours, 
  just put one rule , being do n't be a dick . 
  just make it clear that you can report posts and message the moderators if you do n't think a certain post is up to scratch . 
  empire has n't got many hard factions . 
  the hardest i 've played is poland-lithuania , but that was just a struggle to deal with the germans at the start . 
  it 's weird , only showing the gold edition, 
  aside from the specials , my favourite is the one with the hammerhead eagle-ithrust or whatever it was called . 
  the whole episode was brilliant . 
  what ? 
  no , i have n't , by the way . 
  rome ii 's co-op ~ ~ does n't ~ ~ did n't work anymore and i stopped playing it . 
  but who are you and why are you mentioning me ? 
  haha !, 
  no , probably not , i spend most of my time here . 
  but i do n't know who this guy is in connection to me . 
  are people seriously sending you pms ?!, 
  that 's ridiculous . 
  know that we 're not all bad . 
  well it did n't work in patch 7 for me , have n't launched rome ii since then . 
  thanks though .

  nice work . 
  true , forgot about that . 
  fuckin 365 turns a year making this slow as hell, 
  i did later , after realizing that this was n't getting me anywhere, 
  if anyone does n't already have ** civilization 5 ** i heartily recommend you buy it . 
  the gold edition includes the gods and kings dlc which adds so much to the game and turns it from a 7/10 to a 9.5 / 10 in my books . 
  the brave new world dlc just adds more amazing stuff , but is not as essential as g&k . 
  i completely agree , but if you 're tight for cash the gold edition , which includes g&k , is the thing to go for . 
  yes , buying the gold edition and then bnw is everything for civ 5, 
  where 'd you get any ammo for it ? 
  ca n't find any anywhere !, 
  is it called .357 ? 
  just making sure, 
  he is , you can see a shadow of the camera-man, 
  pause all the time . 
  without pausing , my grand campaign battles with full stacks just end up a huge mess . 
  with pausing i can make sure every unit knows what they 're doing and where to go , and i can pull off huge tactical maneuvers without a flaw . 
  that does n't zoom in as much as a red dot scope on this game , so it 's hardly comparable to binoculars . 
  to spawn near friends usually, 
  well you 'd hope so , after 8 fucking patches, 
  that does n't just make sense ; it * definitely * should be in the game . 
  that , in theory , is an amazing idea , i just fear that putting it into practice wo n't exactly be easy . 
  when she paused after `` final solution '' , i was dreading what she was about to say, 
  rome : illyrian mercenary peltasts . 
  do n't ask me why . 
  empire : us line infantry , because they have the best colours . 
  napoleon : again , because of the similar units , i 'll go with the best colour scheme , which is probably sweden . 
  shogun 2 : ikko-ikki loneswords . 
  they carried me to victory in an otherwise hard campaign, 
  there 's no need for any other units , they utterly destroy . 
  i think they got a completely new ( or different ) part of ca to do this . 
  but it looks really interesting , i agree . 
  moderators , not modifications :d, 
  unless you knew this would get seen and did n't want to start a new thread , so good on you . 
  try the radious mods or the mods suggested below , but i am not sure about unit size . 
  and the guy behind darthmod retired before rome ii 's release to make his own games . 
  here 's my take on a good ** empire ** set up . 
  line infantry should always be your core , for all factions aside from indians and ottomans . 
  so with this in mind , make at least 60 % of your army made of line infantry . 
  cavalry is less important than in other games . 
  very good cavalry could win a battle , yes , but it 'll never assure victory just because you have the cavalry advantage , like in say rome or medieval ii . 
  2-4 units would be ideal . 
  artillery is in the middle . 
  late artillery with quicklime must be a warcrime , it is simply disgusting and is one of the only times when i 've felt guilty on total war . 
  simply put , in an early army without any special cannons , do n't go overboard , but in a later army with huge caliber cannons and howitzers ( oh god howitzers ) , do whatever you feel you can defend . 
  skirmishers are very good late game . 
  always try to bring a few units to screen your main line . 
  grenadiers are optional . 
  no real reason unless you can get up close to wreck them with grenades or charge a weak point in the line . 
  so this is my ideal setup :, 
  * general, 
  * 9 units of line infantry, 
  * 2 units of cavalry, 
  * 4 arty ( 2 howitzers + 2 cannons if facing advanced european faction , 4 howitzers with quicklime for anything but be prepared to get ptsd ), 
  * 4 skirmishers - riflemen usually . 
  spread in front of your line and retreat when their lines get close enough to shoot you . 
  what the fuck, 
  how, 
  why, 
  who, 
  where, 
  why,
