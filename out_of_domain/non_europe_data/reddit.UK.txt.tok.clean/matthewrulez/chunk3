  could n't you just have entered the steam key it gives you like i did ? 
  it gives you the dlc with it . 
  i 'm going to need to see this, 
  poland fucking lithuania . 
  it is the best campaign . 
  i have played as all the factions , and i just found it fun and interesting . 
  you played as the maratha , most likely , as they are the only playable indian faction without a mod . 
  what the hell are you recording this with ? 
  it 's unbearable to watch . 
  edit : are you even recording this ? 
  or is it hundreds of photographs ? 
  i think so . 
  thanks !, 
  yes , i want something different . 
  in rome and medieval ** imo ** battles consist of just ramming inf . 
  together and hoping . 
  it wasnt about the flanking or positioning . 
  it 's been uploaded to this subreddit 3 times already . 
  *** steam *** swap ? 
  i just thought of that . 
  well let 's hope valve * can * release a third of something . 
  sounds like a badass . 
  it 's things like this post that inspire me to play . 
  thanks . 
  they piss me off more every time i see a fucking video . 
  no one wants to watch a video of gameplay filmed on what seems to be a potato . 
  if you want people to watch these videos , you 're going to need to invest in a screen capture device . 
  you also ca n't kill other historical characters , such as sir arthur wellesley . 
  did you play the game ? 
  also was it a free game , as those do n't count i do n't think . 
  okay , that 's ruined my day . 
  sorry , what is pve ? 
  oh , thanks . 
  i have seen gladiator , and it is awesome . 
  i will check out the other movie . 
  thanks !, 
  i will try and see it . 
  thanks !, 
  will do, 
  destroy it !, 
  burn it !, 
  i know your problem , you 're playing vanilla . 
  get darthmod empire , if it still does it then , i do n't know . 
  why good luck ? 
  yeah . 
  do you know if the napoleon campaign is worth trying ? 
  thanks for helping , anyway . 
  more customisation . 
  put the avatar deal into the singleplayer . 
  each general , depending on status , popularity and wealth has different custom options , and depending on where he is stationed and wealth etc , the customisation of troops . 
  ( not what weapons they have , but what colour their armour is and what accesories such as fur hoods and the like ) . 
  also the naming system added to immersion on empire , why take it out ? 
  i found poland lithuania easy !, 
  but good tips . 
  another faction that is good to start with is britain . 
  the ai never try to invade brittany , so you are basically safe . 
  but at the same time i hope it goes well . 
  on one side , i want the over patriotic waste of money shitty logo piece of shit to go badly so i can say ' i told you so ' , but also i want it to go well because it will be * so * embarrassing ... 
  god damn it , me and my friend have just found the motherload of m1911 ammo . 
  now we will have to find the fucking m9 . 
  if you think napoleon is complicated , play empire . 
  never realised this . 
  still got to find a revolver . 
  so midday in the uk , i think . 
  i will be coming , but it will be a massacre . 
  run steam as administrator ? 
  men in top hats dancing around the shire ? 
  what 's not to like !, 
  you need a name . 
  good video and all , but why do you need to say ` in a game called mount and blade : warband ' on the mount and blade subreddit ? 
  mount and blade warband, 
  there are also a load of mods out , but they need support from steam, 
  i have never found one ... any tips/places i should look ? 
  is n't new spain a protectorate of spain ? 
  good luck !, 
  it 's not just your graphics card , the ram and cpu all account to having smooth fps with thousands of troops on the screen . 
  it has to render all of them . 
  defending a battle is easier , as all you have to do is counter the enemy . 
  it 's in the vanilla game of empire total war , when you have the best military building in your capital playing as poland-lithuania, 
  where does it say that ? 
  i read the article and at no point did i see him mention them spawning with the player . 
  i was in class in my youth sitting next to a classmate who i did n't like . 
  i had dandruff , and i itched my head and white dandruff came from it . 
  he turns to me and shouts `` get the fuck away from me you 've got nits !, 
  ( head lice ) '', 
  i replied no , it 's dandruff . 
  you know , dead skin ? 
  `` then how the fuck does it crawl to the edge of your hair '', 
  do it . 
  it apparently does it on the hour , every hour . 
  why were you taking a picture of a half built house ? 
  sounds fishy . 
  get all of them , and join a regiment on napoleonic wars . 
  i am in the 5th brigade , which means i play with my ` clan ' on organised line battles with cavalry , skirmishers and line infantry against other regiments . 
  [ here is a helpful link ] ( http://forums.taleworlds.com/index.php?topic=222770.0 ), 
  it 's really a friendly and secluded community . 
  there are not hundreds of thousands of regiments , but there are a good few hundred to choose from . 
  i am in a 95th rifle company . 
  it is amazing and you make a lot of new friends . 
  also the community is so close , there are grudges and friendly ( or not so friendly ) rivalries between regiments .
