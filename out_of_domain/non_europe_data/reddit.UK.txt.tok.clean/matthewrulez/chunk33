  an enemy of your enemy is your friend, 
  wait - are you saying he was n't russia 's greatest love machine ? 
  hey , i 'm originally from the great town of salford , who recently changed the colour of their bin lids to luminous pink in an effort to rebrand themselves . 
  well i have been living in chorley most of my life , and my family 's from here , so i 'd say i am from chorley if someone asked . 
  i do n't want to put this down , but there 's plenty of mod ideas on twc that post with a faction list and concept art , but nothing ends up happening . 
  thanks . 
  germany 's is good as well . 
  ours is shit though . 
  i actually liked the snowboarding commentary , it was much more lighthearted and entertaining than the usual stuff you get .

  poor poland always gets gang-raped by austria , prussia and russia . 
  i feel sorry for it . 
  he evolved a few weeks ago, 
  alt on pc . 
  ahh , but some people have friends, 
  i got frustrated with rome ii for those reasons , and that 's why i went back to empire . 
  darthmod empire, 
  not really a political statement , more of a statement about equality and human rights , which is exactly what the olympic games are about . 
  well there 's no argument whether it was an injustice, 
  see : the comment above you, 
  love the people getting angry because you spent  # 40 on a game and you want to play that game in a way you want . 
  in regards to balance , the earlier unlocks for most classes are amazing - m416 , acw-r , aek etc , and most guns have just as good early unlockables as the later ones , apart from snipers . 
  i do n't pay # 60 to have a game of 5 a side though . 
  it does n't give you any warning about minimum level requirement . 
  i slowly built up a horrible feeling in my stomach until i finally vomited at picture 20 . 
  truly horrifying . 
  i do n't think that 's technically true , i think that he simply has very fast health generation . 
  i might be wrong . 
  that 's why one big hit from falling kills him , so in theory a massive amount of damage delivered in one blow could kill him . 
  there 's no such thing as a `` british accent '', 
  hard/hard on darthmod . 
  i ca n't think of a way to prove it , but it is . 
  he stops going to cake shops, 
  i do n't have a webcam goddamnit, 
  surely it 'll only filter out 4/5 bots . 
  i live in the uk , and each specific area has * very * very different accents . 
  saying there 's one single `` british '' accent when britain encompasses scotland , ni , wales , and england , and each of those has about 100 different accents that are wildly different is incorrect . 
  that 's what i was saying . 
  i was n't trying to be a prick mate , sorry . 
  i know people here think there 's an `` american '' accent , and they 're wrong too . 
  i 'm wrong as well - i ca n't tell differences between different us accents , but i know there 's more . 
  you can understand with the wording '' ** a ** british accent '' is a bit ambiguous . 
  anyway , sorry if i offended you . 
  oh my god !, 
  thanks for the gold . 
  you know there 's something up when you 're using shogun ii ai as measurement of ai capability lol . 
  ^ ^ i ^ ^ love ^ ^ shogun ^ ^ 2, 
  oh it is , but it 's still not ... great ... 
  * my son *, 
  sure it was, 
  ~ ~ i believe it 's just the amount of multiplayer matches played , basically . ~ ~, 
  *** edit *** oh my god if this is multiplayer this is a colossal fuck-up, 
  well it must be singleplayer , because if not , it 's gon na stay on 50 % is n't it . 
  does coh even have singleplayer `` battles '' ? 
  two questions to that : why is there a percentage ? 
  and coh2 does n't have singleplayer `` battles '' , so how on earth does that work . 
  i know you ca n't answer it , but it 's very strange . 
  i 've been told in another thread that it 's singleplayer ( too ? ), 
  makes sense , thanks,

  [ he did n't even have to use his ak ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4uqmylds7q ), 
  faster than elephants , and armed with javelins . 
  the tabasco at minimum i thought was really good, 
  these are really quite common, 
  hey , bf3 was nearly perfect when they released bf4 . 
  he 'll never be released . 
  direct opposite of sweden , then . 
  were they all marsh tiles ? 
  that seems very lucky . 
   as an aside , i 've played darth mod for empire , it 's barely and improvement . 
  i know it 's cool to hate on him , but that 's a downright lie . 
  his darthmod empire and napoleon are astounding and huge improvements in both features and ai . 
   poetry videos can be 15-30 seconds . 
  that is disgusting, 
  you asserted your opinion as fact there . 
  if you 'd said `` i did n't like it '' i would n't have said anything . 
  they 're really nice, 
   first off , people are railing at the whole concept of paying for an additional product created apart from the main game . 
  ahh , but they are in the main game , but before launch they are ripped out and sold later . 
  it 's wrong . 
  it 's good that cas videos all have thousands of dislikes now , it 's good that their facebook posts have nothing but negative comments . 
  hopefully , they 'll realise that people are n't falling for this shit any more . 
  they probably wo n't though . 
  people seem to forget the only time that you 're in melee range is ... when you 're in melee range . 
  which is about a meter away . 
  did you play the prologue ? 
  that should help . 
  also , for your first campaign , try rome , as they 're so easy . 
  because they purposely took a part of the game out that is crucial to the whole experience and sold it later - greek states , and the new crappy unit pack , which contains units that were shown in videos before launch as being in the game . 
  no i know , i understand what you 're getting at . 
  i 've already got 100 hours out of rome ii , which is better than most games . 
  but it 's back to empire and shogun 2 for me . 
  well photoshop is like sellotape or hoovers , brand names that have become common terminology for what they are . 
  ... to own slaves, 
  or pellets from a shotgun ?
