  next it 's up to you : keep going and attack france and spain and take all of the usa , or make your fortune overseas , colonising india and even europe - the barbary coast , greece , malta and [ even the ottoman empire ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/totalwar/comments/1wx4bu/fixing_the_ottoman_problem/ ) are good targets . 
  quite poorly written in my opinion , plus a lot of grammatical mistakes . 
  surely russians , not ukrainians, 
  that is absolutely filthy, 
  why would the us fight the ukrainians ? 
  it 's very unlikely they 'll be fighting anyone , but why would they go against the eu , nato , the un and themselves - ( * `` russia has violated the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the ukraine '' * ) by fighting for the russians ? 
  ^ ^ ^ probably ^ ^ ^ not ^ ^ ^ serious, 
  we are all apes, 
  last * few * years ? 
  watch anything past about series 5 and it 's what you described : a car based comedy series, 
  i see no flaw in your logic, 
  favorite unit in the game . 
  i call it the seaborne artillery . 
  plus i love the looks of it , it 's so cool, 
  it 's not a typo . 
  s ` all relative, 
  you foreigners are really missing out, 
  that was awesome , some twists - spain going from a huge power destroying the moors , and then in a dozen turns they were replaced by the portuguese , who were in turn destroyed by the moors . 
  so much false about what they 're saying about wwi it 's unbelievable . 
   so , england reversed its historical rivalry with france , in 1904, 
  anyone with any grasp of history would know that it was to prevent war between themselves , not to ally against germany . 
   but a minor , unanticipated dust-up, 
  again , you 'd have to be pretty retarded to call the assassination of the heir to the austro-hungarian empire a `` minor dust-up '' . 
   in a freak event , a serbian teenager killed the heir-apparent to the austrian-hungarian throne . 
  so austria-hungary attacked serbia . 
  well not exactly . 
  the austrians gave serbia , who had already been a keen target to expand their empire , an ultimatum . 
  serbia was a target because they objected to the annexation of bosnia into austrian territory . 
   germany moved to defend its ally , austria-hungary , by attacking russia 's ally , france . 
  again , not totally worded well . 
  germany had already kinda wanted to invade france , since like , forever , and had been looking for an excuse basically . 
  they put the schlieffen plan into action , a plan drawn up nearly a decade before , and invaded france through litte neutral belgium . 
   england , france 's ally , responded by declaring war on germany . 
  no , the uk , not england , was allied to belgium through the 1839 treaty of london , so was drawn into the war famously because of a `` scrap of paper '' as the german chancellor remarked . 
  also , calling wwi a `` war about oil '' is vastly oversimplifying and incredibly naive . 
  there were many complex reasons why there was a war , and in the words of blackadder `` it was simply too hard * not * to have a war '' . 
  where 've we seen that before, 
  oh my fucking god, 
  `` great '' in great britain does not mean `` amazing '' etc. 
  it means big . 
  like , this island is greater in size than brittany in france . 
  if it got windy you 'd have some soggy pillows, 
  is n't that part of the game ? 
  adapting to the map , and learning as you go . 
  i feel you, 
  i was banned for commenting [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/skeptard/comments/209nfr/rconspiratard_makes_fun_of_the_content_of_the/cg13j8z?context=3 ) lol, 
  and here , we see a zoophile, 
  especially since no one here says any of this shit , it 'd be funny if the stereotype was true, 
  i would have such an erection if i was the netherlands right now, 
  go on then , have your discussion about ** having sex with animals **, 
  as someone 's said , quick is the best for multiplayer and , surprisingly , quick . 
  basically any units you produce will become obsolete very fast until the modern era , so that 's when most wars tend to be started ( pikemen have a long life also , i recall ) . 
  standard is my favourite for singleplayer , as it 's a balance between being fast enough that it does n't take years to complete , but slow enough so earlier wars are easier . 
  epic is generally not too slow , and a lot better for domination games with civs that mainly focus on earlier game warmongering , such as the aztecs and especially the huns . 
  i 've never played marathon because epic is slow enough for me . 
  so no comment . 
  your analogy would make sense if you added the fact that you could just choose to be with one of the 7 other people that do n't drive you as mad , and have slightly more functioning brains, 
  i know you might be joking , but its spelt picket fence and it comes from the french word `` piquet '' . 
   the commerce social policy track is almost mandatory with england . 
  exploration with brave new world has all the naval bonuses . 
  commerce has been changed to land trade routes, 
  referring to the seven other total war games other than rome ii, 
  the only time i use or occasionally make these is because they look so cool , and so does their animation . 
  well in real life , mad is n't a set `` agreement '' , and this is the same for civ . 
  in both real life and civ , starting a nuclear war would have drastic and destructive consequences , so no one wants to be the one to start it . 
  why not ? 
  could have *, 
  this better not be faked, 
  yay a new picture of a victory screen !, 
  this is fake guys . 
  the image is from this video : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7p1b6cj1hmq, 
  it 's fake, 
  can you elaborate ? 
  i do n't like rome ii , but the last time i played it was a few patches ago and they 'd definitely made a good job of the performance . 
  no ' in nazis, 
   20 year old game vs. one that is just about a year old, 
  try 9 years vs 6 months . 
  rome i in my opinion is better than rome ii in nearly every aspect aside from its graphics . 
  native americans were mainly killed off by disease . 
  also , decimation does n't mean i assume you think it means . 
  i scroll down to laugh at these people , but get depressed when i find out they 're real, 
  no apostrophe in needs, 
  no apostrophe in its, 
  i think it means to the nearest 50 000, 
  is it possible to compare this with the hdi of other countries ? 
  the wikipedia page i 've found has a different scale of hdi i believe . 
  in napoleon , units would do this too , and the best i heard was a british soldier screaming about how he saw a snake, 
  i prefer , at least on rome ii , to have armies composed of mainly one unit , especially when playing greece , so i can form a giant phalanx line that can consistently win using similar tactics . 
  but thanks , i will probably take a few hoplites on the side to ward of cavalry . 
  i know what you 're saying , but the ai on rome ii 's battle plan is usually just to frontal charge my pikes with everything . 
  and of course i am bringing a skirmisher and a cavalry contingent . 
  has it been updated to patch 10 ? 
  guys , mods wo n't work if not compatible with the recent patches . 
  assassin 's creed : white flag, 
  yep, 
  you know you 're on prince when shaka 's invasion force is 2 swordsmen and a composite bowman . 
  because americafreedummyrightssecondamendmentguns, 
  you are truly a music defener, 
  not really though , i watch the 10pm news most nights and it 's as it always has been . 
  * cough * pc,
