  that 's how it 's pronounced , no ? 
  looks like it 's from a louis theroux documentary , but i have no idea which . 
  well , not england , but the uk , as it was invented in scotland . 
  never used it once . 
  i play on king , that may be why , but it comes too late ( and is fighter upgrade ) to do anything meaningful . 
  the real gold is in trade routes , so make sure to prioritise getting these up and going fast . 
  coastal trade routes are worth so much more than caravans , so make sure you have a few coastal cities to trade . 
  \\ #shogun 2sieges, 
  just came off rome after a siege involving an allied force of libyans grab their ladders and spend 20 fucking minutes spinning around on the spot , getting shot by javelins and arrow towers . 
  2000 libyans died , and i had to take rome all by my self , outnumbered in a siege assault . 
  first thing i did . 
  check the main post , i 've sorted it out now . 
  a few frigates/battleships would n't go amiss, 
  like highlands inca, 
  well his mum made his bedtime earlier and said he had to do his homework before being allowed on the computer, 
  why would attila like a city-state ? 
  it 's not * that * bad , with that pantheon for production from fishing boats you 'd have one hell of a city . 
  even without it that is a fuck ton of fish and whales . 
  well i 've never heard someone say `` are-ent '' or whatever you say . 
  i 'm from the uk . 
  are the seleucids hard on dei ? 
  because on vanilla they 're possibly the 2nd easiest faction i 've played , after rome . 
  it is, 
  also : the mayans have 2 militaristic city-states behind them , so they are sorted for life , and gandhi has now got musketmen - i still have swordsmen . 
  should i just consolidate behind my walls and hope that they kill each other ? 
  also : the mayans have hidden behind them 2 militaristic city-states , so they do n't even need to build units , and gandhi now has musketmen , whilst i have swordsmen . 
  should i just consolidate behind my walls and hope they get themselves into a mess ? 
  i really ca n't fathom how you could manage to lose on science as babylon/korea . 
  i only ever take this if i have :, 
  a ) already filled either liberty or tradition and am planning domination, 
  b ) got to the late game and already filled out all of the social policy trees i want ( including ideology ) and just want to let loose some destruction for the lols, 
  what am i looking at ? 
  are both of those spy kills from the same spy ? 
  to be fair , he is exaggerating to make a point , but i agree with some of his stuff . 
  i play quick games twice a week with my friends and i regularly notice that any domination early/mid game still has a negative effect on relations at the very end game . 
  this is stupid and unrealistic . 
  the first city is the capital , not capitol . 
  like the capital of the uk is london . 
  but i do what you do , mainly . 
  if i start in tundra , or in a large forest , or no where near a coast , i re-roll . 
  i do n't want to spend hours trying to make up for my bad start . 
  do n't feel bad about it if it 's what you want to do to have fun . 
  i know that feeling , as i play with 3 friends regularly . 
  if i 'm playing multiplayer , we have a vote , where if a majority of us vote to keep or restart , we do it . 
  if i happen to have a shit start and everyone else loves theirs , i just roll with it . 
  i usually win every game anyway , so sometimes it 's a welcome change . 
  edit : also if you 're not happy with your capital , you could always just , you know , take theirs . 
  i swear to god , there is nothing more annoying than an american claiming that he is german/irish/italian etc because his great-great-grandparents ' aunt 's friend was from there . 
  * well *, 
  ( no meta links ), 
  naah m8, 
  who the fuck thinks people would stop either listening to classical music , or appreciating art ? 
  i mean come on , we listen to things that are already 500 years old , so why should it not continue for 500 more years ? 
  second city size 15 in 1950 ? 
  f12 screenshots on steam , by the way . 
  how much money are you making ? 
  i second this , his smug little prick face makes me want to destroy him as soon as i meet him . 
  what you do , as i did many a time before i gave up on rome ii , was put it into windowed mode , and then tab out and watch netflix . 
  there 's a reason there 's a rule 5 on this subreddit . 
  but nice going , i once purposefully left it until 1969 to launch the rocket in civ v , and win the game . 
  we 're classy over here in chorley, 
  i 'm telling you , if you go to mcdonalds on an average thursday afternoon , you 'll find nothing but the chavs and parklands high school students covering it like ants . 
  i do n't think there 's * too * much anal, 
  / u/user _ history_bot matthewrulez, 
  544 hours , i only moved up to king from prince a few months ago . 
  it feels less game-y , if you know what i mean . 
  it 's not a mod , it 's in the vanilla game ( bnw ) . 
  i 've had it occasionally . 
  i know it 's venice , so it 's technically cheating , but check that out . 
  what luck to get venice as an opponent , when you turned css off . 
  such coincidence . 
  do n't you * dare * insult the hobnob, 
  i once got a 73 turn one , did n't leave golden ages from ~ 1200 . 
  oh god that city is half snow , how could you bring yourself to found it there, 
   just one in ten agreed with the statement : `` i would describe my dreams as pleasant . '', 
  oh so it 's looking at my iphone that causes nightmares . 
  ^ ^ what ^ ^ a ^ ^ piece ^ ^ of ^ ^ tosh, 
  end game , go to replay tab and then graphs . 
  darthmod napoleon is one of favourite mods of all time . 
  so intense . 
  i did a series here with sweden , but stopped posting due to dwindling popularity . 
  i 'd already done this with some of my favourites , eg . 
  new world symphony and 1812 overture , but thanks . 
  he 's using a mod called red i think , it makes the units more realistically sized/smaller . 
  no , it 's just basic marketing . 
  i do n't want to bend down to look for cornflakes , do i. 
  venice is so easy to wreck on multiplayer though , just blockade their trade routes and they 've basically got one city making fuck all . 
  you must be on legendary start , that ivory/cotton is ridiculous . 
  good point , and not to be a dick , but capital *, 
  ^ sorry ^ but ^ this ^ really ^ bugs ^ me, 
  most countries do n't have a capitol building, 
  well it seems you were way ahead on techs on this , so maybe try out king ? 
  i play on king , after playing countless hours on prince , and now i have to actually think . 
  mostly . 
  but whatever floats your boat . 
  are there people that seriously believe that the earth is flat or something ?

  the funny thing is , i have that map pack , yet i never noticed . 
  thanks . 
  i understand that , but i think they should have some sort of direct tourism yield .
