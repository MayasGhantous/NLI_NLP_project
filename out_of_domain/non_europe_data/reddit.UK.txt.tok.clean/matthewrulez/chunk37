  to kill the barbarians . 
  but yeah , i would have restarted as soon as i saw tundra , nevermind snow . 
  i play on king too , and i kinda agree , but not totally . 
  there is more a need to build defenses on king , as the ai seems to build bigger invasion armies . 
  also wonders get picked up more often , and the ai never falls very far back like they did on prince . 
  i 'd say keep with prince until , like me , you win every game without thinking , then move on to king . 
  i 'd be interested in that , too . 
  having an earlier caravel seems a little op , maybe instead of two extra movement , it has * less * movement or sight . 
  just an idea though . 
  well whenever i kill venice , his next capital is always a puppeted city that remains puppeted . 
  i am not sure about the second question though . 
  when will people understand that games that are popular are popular for a reason . 
  they 're good . 
  statue of motherfucking liberty , best wonder in the game, 
  temple of artemis , so sexy, 
  sistine chapel , because why not, 
  stonehenge , like you said , but i hardly get it due to rushing toa, 
  guessing pretty low , his science per turn is shockingly low and he has no army yet he has n't been completely wiped out, 
  napoleon total war , playing russia . 
  i had an army fighting france in switzerland , and another fighting the ottomans . 
  but the french were too powerful . 
  so i decided to build a third army in st. petersburg , and land it in the netherlands . 
  we landed , and were immediately met by the dutch army . 
  the battle was long and fierce , but i pulled through . 
  i had won , and amsterdam was in my reach . 
  however , in the next week , a french army led by none other than napoleon himself , assaulted my army . 
  i was outnumbered two to one , my cavalry was all-but gone and it was grim . 
  the battle was a mess of melee fights , that my hardy russians won at , and line battles , in which we were completely outclassed by the french . 
  after an hour , all i had left was a last unit of russian guards , in square position , protecting my general , surrounded at all sides . 
  the french charged , and my men fought well . 
  however it was too much , and my army was completely wiped out . 
  as someone who is n't colourblind , ethiopia 's colours always get me frightened , thinking they 're barbarians . 
  i like plopping a few points in exploration , but obviously not prioritizing it over rationalism . 
  what difficulty are you on ? 
  arabia always seems peaceful , until his uu camel archers come , then he goes mental, 
  it 's worse when you accidently plunge your civilization into war with ethiopia , causing immeasurable harm and death to your civilization . 
  in other news , why is the yes option on `` are you sure you want to declare war on the world superpower to whom all your trade routes are to ? '', 
  on the left hand side ? 
  i know , but for some reason on civ it feels weird and wrong , for me . 
  anyway , i 've gotten used to it . 
  human hearts - the aztecs, 
  this, 
  i 'm 16 from england , there seems to be a few people here , so maybe we should get something going ? 
  i am away however for the weekend , but i 'm on easter holidays like you . 
  battleships, 
  sandstorm netherlands is the most op thing since highlands inca, 
  happens every game for me , unless i mod it so it does n't . 
  i like having rome as an opponent , they 're the only faction that are completely unique . 
  completely unique ? 
  they have a base of hoplites , like nearly every faction in the game . 
  i like ranged sea units . 
  you can take a city with 3 or 4 of them , and one trireme , so they 're good to use until frigates become available . 
  her voice is the worst part about this . 
  and the rest of it . 
  do what you want to have fun . 
  if it improves your experience , then why not ? 
  no one loses out from your strategy . 
  i 've come to accept - ize , as it makes sense . 
  you do n't pronounce realize as realise , unless you 're learning english in the netherlands, 
  ^ ^ ^ nearly ^ ^ ^ 17, 
  poland-lithuania in empire , [ because of these guys ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_hussars ), 
  yeah , sweden is so close . 
  weird, 
  you are persia ... 
  i play multiplayer with 3 other people most nights and the only problems we have are annoying loading screens mid-game . 
  it never crashes for us . 
  i 'm pretty sure poland gets 7 in total, 
  surely zulu + russia would be better, 
  ~ ~ he probably ca n't use steam . 
  because it 's pirated . ~ ~, 
  i retract this statement , and the views expressed by windchild are in no way affiliated with me, 
  no , but they have a much better bonus to land maintenance than germany iirc, 
  no , the zulus units cost 50 % less maintenance whilst germany 's is 25 % less . 
  meanwhile william has his own continent, 
  silly that this is an early tourism wonder , i know that , for balance i suppose , they needed a tourism one , but the parthenon should be faith or happiness based . 
  no real need to get it , and it usually gets snapped up quickly . 
  quick side-note : i once had greece build this followed by the statue of zeus . 
  exactly . 
  you do n't ** need ** to know most of what 's on the news . 
  if you did n't know , you would n't be affected by it . 
  people complaining about the news is pointless ; do n't read it then . 
  why ? 
  mongolia is one of the weaker civs, 
  if you get bnw you get all the game mechanics from g&k as well . 
  so all you 'll be missing out on is the 9 civs from g&k : the netherlands , celts , maya , ethiopia , austria , carthage , byzantium , the huns , and sweden . 
   powerful early warmonger civs like mongolia, 
  does n't their only redeeming quality , their uu , come at knights ? 
  i would n't call that early . 
  the point is there are so many better warmongering civs that mongolia kinda falls to the bottom of that pile . 
  their ua is about taking city states , if i am not mistaken , which is a terrible idea , as it will only make every civ in the game hate you . 
  their uu is good , but so is the zulus , who come with a ua reducing maintenance costs on melee units by 50 % , which is brilliant . 
  arabia 's uu is arguably the best in the game , and their ua is amazing as well . 
  the huns are an early warmonger , with a brilliant uu , the ram , and although i consider them a weaker civ i would much rather use them for domination than the mongols . 
  granted , i do think that science oriented civs like babylon and korea are the best in the game * ( as well as poland , obviously ) * , there are some great warmongers that would be a better choice for overall wars than the mongols . 
  more money rounded civs , such as persia , or generic production focused ones such as russia would be an easier alternative than the lackluster mongol ua . 
   by going to war early and grabbing tons of land , you accomplish several goals simultaneously, 
  this can not be accomplished by the mongols more than any other civ . 
  they have no bonuses to early warmongering , other than their gg uu ( oh the acronyms ) , which would be hard to obtain early enough to make a real difference . 
  the points you make about early warmongering can be applied to almost any civ - and many civs do it a lot better !, 
  rome , ** the huns ** , greece to an extent , the zulus , persia - the list goes on .
