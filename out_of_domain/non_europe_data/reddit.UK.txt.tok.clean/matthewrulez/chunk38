  i 'd be interested to hear your counter-argument . 
  emperor - somehow got the temple of artemis , the hanging gardens , and petra , and then kasbahs on top of petra-fyed tiles . 
  also full tradition , full freedom , and swords into plowshares . 
  religion bonus , +15 % growth when not at war, 
  i know right, 
  quick, 
  it 's not * that * much gold per turn is it ? 
  each trade route is worth like 20 . 
  on another game i was making over 1100gpt . 
  the hydro plant was the best thing ever , added like 30 production . 
  freedom for the less food from specialists/statue of liberty, 
  could have been a lot bigger if i 'd put any internal trade routes . 
  i ca n't believe i did n't think of it sooner . 
  did he promptly kamikaze into a battleship ? 
  what does this have to do with anything, 
  imo the mayans stay a relevant and good civ throughout the game, 
  surely 7 free policies ? 
  classical , medieval , renaissance , industrial , modern , atomic , and information, 
  ahh the famous cotton plantations of gloucester, 
  i 'd go ol' bluetooth too . 
  his country that was responsible for the genocide of millions !, 
  surely that alone is a reason to bomb crucial weapons facilities , factories etc. 
  i know this is 4 days old , but, 
   that is very localised to stoke, 
  is false . 
  i am from chorley ( google it ) in lancashire and many people , particularly older people say that . 
  same with some people from salford , and bolton . 
  pretty sure 1 000 000 is a million, 
  because it 's a good book ? 
  hahahahaahhahahahahahaha did u see it it says nob, 
  utter sick, 
  i put my second city on the forest tile on the coast south-west of my warrior on the 3rd picture . 
  it 's currently the size of my capital , and has a lot more production , thanks to the pantheon for production from fishing boats . 
  oh , sorry , i mean the one close to my warrior , right of the cattle under my warrior, 
  ** king difficulty **, 
  [ scenario ] ( https://www.dropbox.com/s/5ft8d1so87ys45h/awesome%20continents.civ5map ) ( open mods , play , then load the map and scenario ) . 
  this way you can play on any speed you want . 
  [ just autosave ] ( https://www.dropbox.com/s/r12u6un5rvyyma8/autosave_initial_0000%20bc-4000.civ5save ) - it 's on quick . 
  and with different civs aside from you , portugal . 
  but same start . 
  the berserker 's sword is ridiculous !, 
  i ca n't imagine thinking that would be my weapon of choice - it 's about 9 inches long , and is decorated like something out of oblivion . 
  bring a longsword you idiot . 
  its like the same as napoleon 's except you have to go through the trouble of pressing `` replenish '' on the side . 
  it 's amazing how the farmers did n't notice that for 6000 years they 've had giant green glowing craters covering their fields, 
  no , he 's wrong , jenne does n't have a mountain . 
  well i managed to get the hanging gardens and the temple of artemis , and by turn 100 i had the largest population and gnp , so i would n't call it awful . 
  it 's great for portugal - the river makes trade routes even better - and my second city is brilliant . 
  besides you get lighthouses at what ? 
  latest turn 40 ? 
  i am playing on king , i play on king-emperor . 
  i have played 600 + hours of civ 5 . 
  this is one of the best i have seen - a few tiles away from 2 of the best natural wonders in the entire game , next to a faith based city state , mountain on river , with insane amounts of luxury resources . 
  fine , i 'd probably rather have a triple-river flood plains start as the netherlands , or a mountainous hill filled valley as the inca , but i really do n't see how this start is awful , even without the mountain . 
  shame no ones mentioned chicken tikka masala , the single greatest meal to come out of britain, 
  yes , without the honourable and mighty us army , norway would fall to invasion from like the famously war-like swedes or something / s, 
  this is n't the argument or the point i was making , but go on then , who the fuck would invade norway ? 
  the only reason i can see for it is oil . 
  now who would invade just for oil ? 
  keep telling yourself that without america , the western world would collapse under the mighty rule of kim jong un, 
  only if you base whether to upvote/downvote on popular opinion . 
  shogun 2 ? 
  but seriously , is this how people think ? 
  so that rules out things like a chinese total war , apparently . 
  amazing , whole continents dismissed because people have n't learnt their history . 
  fuck right off with your racism, 
  i did n't like shogun ii because it had cool ninjas , i liked it because it was ** and is ** a brilliant game . 
  dismissing chinese history as not being `` cool enough '' is incredible . 
  the famous walled city of troy, 
  it 's all a matter of opinion , surely . 
  [ oh god this is hilarious ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90lo7e44e5k ), 
  so if i came over to you and slit your throat , no-one should be able to do anything about it ? 
  this guy 's got ta see schindler 's list, 
  i could kill you with a spoon , but would you rather i was armed with a gun ? 
  they both do the same thing according to that . 
  bullet-time ? 
  babylon is n't a very good place to build petra, 
  well i suppose it 's so quick that it does n't matter , and is comparatively pain-free compared to burning alive/suffocating . 
  `` it was a magnificent display of trained and disciplined valour , and its assault only failed of success because dead men can advance no further '' - about an assault by the royal newfoundland regiment in wwi that killed 650 of the 700 men involved . 
  na-ray-ter or na-ray-tor, 
  long story . 
  my dying king of ireland was fighting the scots for a tiny bit of land up in the highlands , when i saw that a young , unmarried , childless queen had come to power in england . 
  immediately i assassinated my old wife , and married her . 
  after she gave birth to a son , i had to make him my heir to unite the kingdoms . 
  unfortunately , i 'm pretty new to the game , so the only way i could think was to assassinate every heir up to him . 
  which included a lot of my sons , their sons , their daughters , and even a baby . 
  i did n't care what people would think of me with all these failed assassinations , he was gon na die pretty soon anyway ... 
  and now my new king is heir to the throne of england . 
  now we wait . 
  update : i formed britannia . 
  [ nsfl borders . 
  yeah , i 'm not ashamed . 
  i got really pissed off with my bad planning leading to my heir causing my kingdom i 'd built to crumble , so this time i wanted little matt to have an empire without trouble . 
  i used the cheat `` cash '' once or twice . 
  *** i 'm new please do n't judge me ***, 
  that 's an ~ ~ amazing ~ ~ incredibly unfair idea and i will not be doing it as soon as i load up ck2 . 
  no way . 
  i used the cheat cash , but this was all one save , my guy just took a huge huge piety + relations hit with everyone , but died like a week after . 
  and a little bit of sweden that i did n't know was mine, 
  what about those catapults ?
