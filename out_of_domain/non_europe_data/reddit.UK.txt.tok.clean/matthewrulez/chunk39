  they are n't from shogun 2 . 
  i bet it 's a modded older total war . 
  they really did a good job with it compared to the one in rome ii . 
   `` if it is not historically accurate , than it is not a total war game '' . 
  holy shit is you serious, 
  \\ #flamingpigs, 
   it will never be featured in a total war title . 
  top lol when total war : warhammer is announced, 
  i only started playing rome after i 'd played shogun ii and empire , and it really is n't nostalgia , it 's just an amazing game . 
  the graphics are n't that bad , seriously , and the gameplay is incredible . 
   implying it 's not just a matter of opinion, 
   what about my post is homophobic ? 
   but , but what about le gaybois !, 
  fuck you, 
  he 's obviously not 10 , i would say 14 or 15 . 
  also to buy this all you really need is a computer and the brains to enter your steam age as above 18 or whatever . 
  you do n't even need a credit card . 
  well i think it looks better than the car featured in op 's post . 
  yay opinions, 
  is n't the north , especially the north-east , very genetically related to the vikings ? 
  i remember seeing something about it on reddit once . 
  how so ? 
  i see no link between the usa and hitler 's rise to power . 
  but my education on this topic is from gcse history . 
  oh yeah , britain was getting richer by the second . 
  oh , wait , no it was n't , it was crippled . 
   i am from britain , but i am from england . 
  it 's like a japanese person saying `` i 'm asian . '', 
  it just would n't happen , would it ? 
  no but we are `` british '' . 
  that 's the noun . 
   like the un governs over europe, 
  the un `` governs '' over the world . 
  the eu `` governs '' over europe . 
  and it is completely different to the federal government of the us . 
   the monarchy rules over the 4 countries, 
  well , the monarchy rules over a lot of countries , and one of those is the united kingdom . 
   the people of britain basically view themselves as separate to one another, 
  i really do n't think that 's true . 
  the olympics etc. 
  there is hardly any cultural difference between the people of england , scotland , wales , n. ireland and the rest of the uk . 
   english and scottish and welsh and irish . 
  irish ? 
  ireland is n't part of the uk . 
  it definitely is n't part of great britain , which you are confusing with the uk . 
  northern ireland is part of the uk , and [ i 'm pretty sure if you said someone from there was irish to a northern irishman , you 'd get a punch to the face . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_troubles ), 
   irish guy english, 
  [ idk , especially since they 're a completely separate country . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ireland ), 
   why would you call a brazilian south american ? 
  because they 're from south america !, 
  it 's not either-or , you are both south american and brazilian if you are from brazil . 
  i am both british and european . 
  nigerians are both african and nigerian . 
  seems you lost two poor romans . 
  i always feel sorry for those guys , imagine finding out your husband/son/brother was not only dead , but died in a clean cut victory where he was one of the only few to die . 
  `` in 1870 , 10 % of africa was under european control ; by 1914 it was 90 % , with only abyssinia ( ethiopia ) and liberia still independent . '',

  sorry about the colours !, 
  blame wikipedia . 
  i 'm not an expert in the history , but to my understanding the europeans managed it through guns v. spears, 
  the great wall of china is pretty thin , is n't it ? 
  surely you want one with lots of width, 
  i disagree with you on some points . 
  yes , in theory , rome ii should be the perfect total war game . 
  but in reality , many of the features you mentioned do n't work out as planned , or simply * do n't work * . 
  diplomacy is broken , simply put . 
  the ai has no thought process when it comes to the amazing unit variety you speak about , so good luck seeing anything but an army of 15 slingers and 4 peasant hoplites . 
  the only faction i would say who have more variety than shogun is rome , and they skip past their first entire half of units by researching what , like 5 techs ? 
  making the hastati , principes , and triarii units disappear within like 10 years . 
  also , in rome ii , there are many ideas that just are n't pulled off correctly . 
  mercenaries , ** `` politics '' ** if you want to call it that , food , the fact that every fucking building gives you like -10 happiness etc. 
  sure , there are some amazing things that it does - line of sight in battles is so cool , and the public order mechanics are alright . 
  but shogun ii does everything it attempts right . 
  the main argument people bring up is the `` unit variety '' being so small . 
  so what ? 
  you actually get to see and understand those units , and get to use them all , and the ai knows how to use them all . 
  and you say all games pan out the same . 
  it 's all anecdotal evidence . 
  in * my * experience , most of the games are all different . 
  on rome , the same can be said , as most of the games have some stupid minor arab faction take out the seleucids , egypt and other supposed major factions , and rome is always destroyed or does n't get past northern italy . 
  also the customisable generals/family tree are amazing . 
  in rome ii , i do n't care or even know my generals . 
  they die in like 20 turns anyway . 
  anyway gtg, 
  i really thought gods and kings was great - not 10/10 , but a solid 8 . 
  i would call post-bnw civ v a 9.9 / 10 though . 
   i only have tradition/liberty full and opened another tree . 
  how the hell do you finish 2 full policy trees before the renaissance ? 
  even in my maddest culture games i only get through tradition and then half of another before i get to the renaissance and go straight to rationalism . 
  oh , now i look stupid, 
  well as someone studying classics , i still prefer shogun ii or the original rome . 
  that must just be me then . 
  i do n't understand how you could win a science victory that early with only 700 science ? 
  when i 'm making like 1500 it still takes till the 1960s before i win . 
  if you want to talk english alliances : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anglo-portuguese_alliance, 
  surely `` war '' would have been better than `` warfare '', 
  honestly the jump from prince to king was n't very big - the only thing that really was different was the ai started to actually build large armies .
