  i have a 660 - not the best graphics card in the world - and a good processor . 
  i get about 60fps , maybe down to 30 in a populated town . 
  how can you resist not invading egypt ? 
  this does n't explain the `` large islands '' map being so small . 
  i also have a hard time believing your explanation , as surely both would spawn similar numbers of islands . 
  what computer have you got to play skyrim on ? 
  i know that , i meant invading the lands of egypt , owned by the dutch . 
  have you verified the files ? 
  right click the game in your steam library and click properties , then go to local files and click verify integrity of game cache, 
   best music in history, 
  i think that 's a matter of opinion, 
   they also had women who were more feminine . 
  that has a bit of a weird vibe . 
   any tw game, 
  played any rome i or medieval ii ? 
  those turns take less than a second most of the time . 
  that 's stainless steel . 
  even with it , it 's faster than rome ii . 
  edit : to clear things up , i meant mid-late game like he said . 
  although that was never the argument . 
  i really do n't know why i 'm getting downvoted here , if people think rome ii has faster turn times than ** vanilla ** ( i never mentioned mods ) med ii and rome i then they 're just delusional . 
  go back and play it . 
  jesus christ this subreddit pisses me off sometimes . 
  i never said that it was to do with the computers though . 
  all i said was that turn times in pre-empire total wars are faster than rome ii , which is undeniably the case , and got downvoted by people who seem to think that rome ii is a perfect , completely polished game and is better than all others in any way , and any attempts at showing that there are in fact aspects of the game done better in previous games is a crime against / r/totalwar . 
  i 've played a very large amount of empire and sadly i do n't think i 've ever seen it happen . 
  i 've seen plenty successful american revolutions though , in the 1770s . 
  he 's not a troll though is he ? 
  he 's just stating his opinion on rome ii in a horrible way . 
  the history of medieval japan is very wildly different from medieval europe , so do n't worry about having similar settings . 
  in my opinion shogun ii is the best total war , for gameplay . 
  the battles are smooth , easy to understand but hard to master , the campaign is brilliant , having a really simple but effective way of managing your provinces . 
  the combat is only similar to med ii in the fact that it uses swords and spears . 
  in fact , if you do n't like that at all , get fall of the samurai , the stand-alone expansion that is utterly astounding . 
  go and watch some let 's plays - heir of carthage did a brilliant otomo clan shogun ii series . 
  make up your mind . 
  but i recommend you get it . 
  what is this , a pirate cd cover from 1998 ? 
  yeah , i think however the royal marines are better than the american marines for shooting , whilst the americans have the best melee strength . 
  sadly the only way to have * proper * wars is to play multiplayer . 
  keshiks are always crazy powerful, 
  brass bands should n't run, 
  patriotism is a silly thing, 
  i hate how most of them use their shield as a counter-weight rather than an actual shield . 
  all of the ideological wonders get the free policy , which is why this is the weakest . 
   which they do in rome 2 . 
  they do ? 
  all i 've ever seen is men literally jumping into spears , ala https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oimimzhnrvi&amp;feature=youtu.be, 
  yep , far cry 3 is definitely the same game as assassin 's creed iv . 
  yep , far cry 3 is the same game as far cry 2 . 
  do n't worry if this does n't get many upvotes , / r/totalwar is n't usually a fan of posting videos such as these . 
  i mean , i 'm not usually , but i follow you on twitter and this was very informative and good . 
  please continue . 
  shhhh , do n't cry , accept it . 
  petra is pronounced pet-ra, 
  marrakech is pronounced marrakesh, 
  but there 's also a popular romanticized thought of pirates that people have , which probably outweighs those negative thoughts . 
  so not a very solid move for those companies . 
  unique battle mechanics being `` roll three dice against two , if you 're lucky you might win '', 
  i 've gone honour instead of tradition just to get a free great general for less, 
  irish capit ** a ** l city in real-life belfast ? 
  also york would be better called liverpool , but that probably would n't fit . 
  crescent roll . 
  wow . 
  every pub and hotel in the uk has that, 
  this is actually pretty common for russia to do - they send armies to help austria out against france , and end up taking french territory . 
  that map 's definition of europe is a bit off, 
  i 'd feel uncomfortable buying souvenirs to fuel the nk regime, 
  are you doing a-levels in the uk ? 
  my last exams also on the 6th . 
  after that though , i 'd be in for a game . 
  they 're probably not although this is the west pediment of the parthenon . 
  i checked the temple of zeus at olympia and iirc the pediments and friezes were wrong, 
  the temple of zeus is a map on custom battles , so check your facts before commenting, 
  ~ ~ edit : love this , getting downvoted even though i 'm right , go check for yourselves ~ ~, 
  do you have any mods ? 
  if so , turn them off, 
  you ca n't blame sega for everything . 
  they clearly had n't thought things through , and silly easy to fix bugs were completely looked over that could have been found by simply playing the game for 30 seconds ( see : `` zombie face textures '' ), 
  does n't usually work for full-screen games , it just captures a black screen, 
  you do n't play on abundant resources, 
  in real life it was n't much better for them, 
  however he still was a general under the anti-semitic nazi regime . 
  i would say this is ironic , since israel was set up as a `` refuge '' sort-of for the jews . 
  also , see this : http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/25ih5k/yet_another_rommel_post_according_to_some/ for information about rommel . 
  well actually it 's a shot from a sling . 
  so no hyphen , i think . 
  side note : which mod is this ? 
  are you venice ? 
  no offence or anything but anyone could easily win a 3-to-1 outnumbered battle with 6 units of rome i phalanxes . 
  i have n't seen anyone say that . 
  i do n't want to get into it , but there many reasons why i prefer rome i. 
  well he did n't fix the economy , and this thread is the most disgusting thing i 've read on reddit for a while . 
  why do they always put the gifs in black and white ? 
  surely with the old gods for crusader kings ii you can play as harald bluetooth ? 
  i 'm european . 
  platoon firing is used on elite units , and fire and advance is not worth it , trust me . 
  the problem with ukip is people writing it ukip . 
  it 's a fucking acronym . 
  yeah but it replaces the normal mode of firing , so it 's not a choice iirc,
