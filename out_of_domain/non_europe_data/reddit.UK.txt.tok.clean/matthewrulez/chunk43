   you look like a fucking pig in heat , and if you get raped by a pack of niggers it will be your fault, 
  i do n't think he is , it 's probably tutankhamun, 
  i agree that dido is a better representation of carthage , but saying hannibal was `` just a general who got elephants over the alps '' is putting it incredibly lightly . 
  this guy was responsible for some of the greatest tactical achievements in history . 
  one is n't real , the other is famous only because he was famous, 
   mao and stalin are largely known for killing millions upon millions of their own people . 
  remove the word ` own ' and that 's exactly what genghis is known for . 
  you can not defend genghis , great military ruler as he was , as being any less than a ruthless killer and rapist of literally millions of people . 
  hitler was an idiot and more importantly a genocidal maniac . 
  bismarck is an infinitely better representation of germany . 
  bush ? 
  of all the presidents of the usa . 
  bush . 
  do americans actually cheer/clap in movie theatres ? 
  i thought that was a exaggerated stereotype . 
  do you clap the pilot when he lands a plane ? 
  it 's from braveheart , where the irish mercenaries join the scottish side to help defeat the english . 
  ** do n't buy it yet ** , it 's not on a daily deal/flash sale/community choice . 
  it 'll go lower than this . 
  fuck that guy , what an imbecile, 
  it 'll be on daily in the next 3 days, 
  i do n't play any sports games apart from fifa , in which you can choose to play as one player , a player manager or the manager of the team . 
  if you play as the one player , you start off playing fairly low skill and you build your way up through leagues and into the national team until you are a `` legendary player '' or whatever . 
  i am the same as you !, 
  i do n't watch/play football ( aside from watching big world cup matches ) , but i love the kinda rpg element of the fifa be a pro mode . 
  once won the world cup as scotland with my striker . 
  slightly off-topic , i live in a region where people say were instead of was all the time . 
  annoying as fuck . 
  well yeah , it 's kind of the regional dialect . 
  `` i were at the dentists '' `` it were reet cold yesterday '' etc. 
  were is kind of pronounced `` wuh '' as well . 
  i live in lancashire in england . 
  but there 's loads of accents around here , so not all of lancashire speaks like that . 
  most probably speak completely differently . 
  i bet most of the areas were like this , for example `` baltic peoples '' , but we have more detail on british tribes . 
  / r/nocontext, 
  if you 're going with the full gun based army , there 's really only one way to deal with melee charges : shoot them before they get to you . 
  seriously though , bring some very good cavalry , that should help . 
  when you 're engaged in melee , do the old hammer-and-anvil , and charge them in the back, 
  still terrorists . 
  an innocent prisoner is still a prisoner . 
  exactly this . 
  you do n't tip unless there 's a reason to . 
  here in the uk we do n't have to tip at all . 
  sure , the food 's more expensive , but thats the price we pay for having a fucking minimum wage , like a modern country should have . 
  not all of `` not-usa '' is like this . 
  * cough * uk * cough *, 
  when did we ( the uk ) go to the moon ? 
  this makes them look so much cooler than they actually are, 
  we do n't use kilometers . 
  no we use miles , for pretty much everything that is n't maths/science . 
  meters are the same system as kilometers , if you did n't know . 
  we use feet and inches sometimes , and yards are also used by older people . 
  the people using the metric system ( meters , cm , etc ) are generally the generation i 'm in and below , who were taught using the metric system in school . 
  but we still have mph road signs , people know all their distances in miles , their weights in pounds , ounces and stone etc. 
  started as russia , quickly brought two armies and wiped out the ottomans in the south . 
  then i got my northern army to take helsinki or wherever the capital of that finnish province is , whilst building an army in lithuania . 
  after finishing both war with the ottomans and sweden , i positioned my 4 armies to take on austria and prussia , killed 4 full stacks with my half-stack armies and took all the provinces i needed . 
  nothing good 's come out of birmingham , a city of a million, 
  the ai does n't know how to use cavalry . 
  i do . 
  in fairness , i think you misunderstood . 
  i killed ( basically ) a full stack * each * with one of my armies . 
  so it was like 4 fights , where i was outnumbered only 2-to-1 or lower . 
  my armies were whatever i started the campaign with - a few militia , line infantry , artillery and some cav . 
  source ? 
  i 've read that he had anywhere between 1 and iirc 35 ( ? ) . 
  but before the crossing of the alps he had 37 elephants , and at the battle of zama he had 80 . 
   not driving hovercars, 
  that 's hilarious . 
  also the capital of india is delhi, 
  i keep hearing this , but in my co-op campaign with my friend , he is the seleucids , and his empire/client states are literally every faction from thrace to baktria . 
  i 'm sat as epirus , trying to control carthage , whilst he is just conquering the last remains of egypt and the few regions of arabia that he has n't already got . 
  i would n't call 1864 the 18th century, 
  that 's the uniform of the colonial army . 
  though this picture is from a game where the original picture has a redcoat with british flags in the background . 
  they had to change it to suit americans .

  yeah i know , but all i can think is surely it would be easier to walk there through some forests rather than sail around the known world . 
  ^ ^ ^ it 's ^ ^ ^ capital ^ ^ ^ not ^ ^ ^ capitol, 
  holy shit !, 
  that is the exact same situation !, 
  haha , that 's brilliant . 
  i wish , no one ever trades with me , even if i pay them more money than they 'd ever make/lose over the course of the campaign . 
  in game there is a road that i can go through in half a turn with my armies . 
  i mean sure , sea travel is much faster , but to a point . 
  that sea journey is going to take a long time , and is probably just as dangerous . 
  this is the map change mod : http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=266987729, 
  i am using a lot of mods , if you want the list i 'll post, 
  this is off-topic but you linked that to me in my / r/totalwar thread . 
  small ~ ~ world ~ ~ reddit, 
  accident ? 
  do n't some sources say it was ordered ? 
  but if ogedai had named a successor , then maybe there 's an argument that there would have been more stability in the years afterwards , instead of everyone kind of splitting off . 
  have you played fots ? 
  i did n't know !, 
  just a funny coincidence . 
  this exact same comment was also posted yesterday , on this thread . 
  i have n't played naval battles since the launch day . 
  they were awful , worse than they 'd ever been .
