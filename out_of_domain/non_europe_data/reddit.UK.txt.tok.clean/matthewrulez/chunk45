  \\ #banter, 
  \\  extremly deep gameplay, 
  [ how 's this ? 
  that was his last chance . 
  what the fuck, 
  it has a nice fps , no instagram filter , and has all the frames to match the words . 
  so it 's not . 
  how am i meant to play my origin and uplay games ? 
  in fairness to / r/conspiracy , it 's clearly not the whole subreddit 's view . 
  just one or two retards . 
  welp . 
  i can only think of a few european countries that could compete with germany . 
  what ? 
  [ another angle friends picture ] ( http://eb-blog-blog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/friends-tv-show.jpg ), 
  * looks in wallet *, 
  dat framerate tho, 
  that is awful, 
  are you serious ? 
  the big bets were on brazil and other south american nations . 
  loads of people thought france or belgium would surprise us and go on to win . 
  english people were slightly hopeful they 'd do well . 
  edit : forgot the netherlands . 
  and spain . 
  hell , even before the final a lot of people thought argentina would win . 
  pc has both , and better, 
  i love the time period of rome . 
  i am not very interested in sengoku japan . 
  but shogun ii is a much better game than rome ii , imo . 
  i know right ? 
  people ask for opinions other than their own * and then downvote it *, 
  i love the music !, 
  prefer napoleon 's though , i think * that * is the the best soundtrack for any total war . 
  a few slingers guarded with high armour spearmen can easily destroy them though . 
  your friend just was n't prepared for it . 
  love that the stereotype of americans not being able to take jokes is true . 
  race ? 
  race ? 
  oooh shit you edited it . 
  there 's literally hundreds of comments saying how `` america is *** soo *** much better than australia '' and `` do n't you dare insult our beloved country '' etc. 
  you clearly ca n't take jokes . 
  it 's okay , we brits * really do * like tea . 
  it is the stereotype . 
  the joke may not be funny , in your opinion ( i agree with you , it is old , but whatever ) but you 'll see it time and time again , where americans , even if a little insulted , venomously defend their country . 
  the roma stadium is really old and in need of repair , as you can see in [ this photo ] ( http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02448/colosseum_2448253k.jpg ), 
  oh my god , the comments are awful . 
  people saying `` wtf have i missed ?! '' . 
  just fucking , idk , update yourself on current events once a day ? 
  not fucking hard . 
  you are right , these guys do n't sound up to scratch with like 4th section brass bands in the uk . 
  [ this is what a championship band sounds like ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfznmilo_ck ) . 
  you know if you get super rich and do n't know what to buy ? 
  buy dozens of them . 
  why not drink out of a tap, 
  so your definition of 3rd world is anyone other than nato , basically . 
   continued occupation of cymru, 
  what are you on m8, 
  you could be the greatest human being of all time , saving lives etc , but if you have sex with a sheep you 'll be ever remembered for that , not all the good stuff you did . 
  does n't the awful blurring annoy you ? 
  it gives me a headache, 
  the skull used on the ss was not a nazi symbol , but a german ( prussian ) military symbol . 
  mine have 5 . 
  is that weird ? 
  your thumb is a finger . 
  there 's no argument about that . 
  it is . 
  yeah , there 's tv adverts sometimes telling you about co here in the uk . 
  it 's a kinda cockney accent , which is what the australian accent is heavily based on . 
  too . 
  as in , there 's ** too ** much post-processing in these screenshots . 
  mine is too . 
  strange . 
  found it : https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=674081219333748&amp;set=a.125554144186461.25910.113800552028487&amp;type=1&amp;theater, 
  i just watched a video of yours . 
  i do n't watch campaign videos anyway , they 're all way too boring in my opinion ( why would you watch a video of it when you could just play it ? 
  ) , but my god the fps you get is unbelievably low !, 
  how could you play with that , nevermind * watch * it . 
  examining it further , you look like you have the graphics settings all the way up . 
  why . 
  you 're getting what , 5fps at max ? 
  i ca n't play a game if it dips under 40 !, 
  turn the settings down to the lowest . 
  for real madrid, 
  as would i , it 'd be a great group . 
  i ca n't deal with anything under 30fps . 
  lower than that , i just wo n't play . 
  yeah , this is almost like just posting the front of the box it came in . 
  have you tried looking at the front page of this subreddit ? 
  or searching ? 
  they must be for public order reasons . 
  otherwise , what on earth are you doing op . 
  well , if it was anything other than a russian or separatist map , it 'd show crimea as ukrainian . 
  because european countries are separate countries , but it could be interesting to see how the eu stacks up as well ? 
   compare that to the uk , where # 1 through # 6 are all in the london metro area ( oxford , cambridge , imperial , uc-london , lse , and king 's college ) . 
  oxford and cambridge are n't in london !, 
  and what list are you looking at , when i search top universities in the uk i get the common ones i hear about , oxford and cambridge , then durham ( near newcastle ) , st andrews ( in scotland ) and some variants of the london universities . 
  i agree , i think the one of the only parts rome ii did well was diplomacy . 
  stupid how you ca n't trade regions though . 
  there 's mods for it , in the meantime . 
  i have to rush out , but search something like roman supremacy ( ? ), 
  on the steam workshop for just rome , or major factions are major/minor factions are minor .
