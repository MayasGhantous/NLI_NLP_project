  i love it . 
  i was thinking less `` stupid idiot '' and more `` completely crazy '' . 
  let 's also not forget that his 3rd reich that conquered half of europe collapsed in 3 years . 
  that 's the most embarrassing thing i 've seen in my whole life, 
  in the uk it 's september starts . 
  he left me for athletico madrid , as well as my lb . 
  he was a legend for the 3 seasons he played . 
  do n't ... buy it ? 
  he was good when i did n't really have an amazing stike team like i do with neymar and co. 
  he was good in early seasons , but he 's been on the sideline for a few years now . 
  well i could do this without any lag on my i5-4570 @ 3.2 ghz , 8gb of ram and a gtx 660 . 
  as much as i do n't like rome ii , it is really optimised it seems for my system . 
  maybe kids would be more willing to actually read the book if it was something they 'd heard of/something that was , as you say , easy to read , whatever that means . 
  otherwise , the chances of them actually reading the set book is quite slim . 
  i never read any of the books we got in english . 
  doubt many others did either . 
  scotland ? 
  plenty of british players that play outside of england . 
  also there 's this one welshman , forget his name ... 
  he cost me bloody $ 30 mil on fifa . 
  what on earth, 
  had to go ruin it at the end did n't you, 
  you 're south african, 
  which game and what is your hardware . 
  you did n't have headphones on whilst on the train ? 
  by `` not everyone '' you mean `` no-one at all '' and by `` great sense of humor '' you mean speaking like a retarded real-life interpretation of / r/circlejerk, 
  ca n't tell if serious, 
  i never use goal kicks . 
  it just gives away possession half the time . 
  i love scouting places that have traditionally not had many great players , like australia and canada etc. 
  or places where people have cool names . 
  ( croatia , serbia , czech republic etc. ), 
  put them together , what do you get ? 
  that 's right : fernando torres, 
  what does that link prove ? 
  second this , signed him as real sociedad and he was amazing . 
  really good in defense , and so fast that he doubled as a winger . 
  how do you get those ut cards for players in cm ? 
  am i missing something really obvious ? 
  i think it 's where you try a goal from well out , with a really powerful shot . 
  i do the same as you for my goalkeeper . 
  let 's see what he 's made of . 
  if i get pissed off , it 's just lb+y for me all the way . 
  so op . 
  thanks mate, 
  couple of years ago , maybe dempsey would have made it in . 
  maybe . 
  right , on the same subject , i find that if i physically * watch * the game being simmed , as in from minute 1-90 on the simulation screen , my players hardly ever get injured . 
  but if i sim it and press y to skip , there 's invariably `` your best stiker has broken his entire spine '' every match . 
  insigne is great for me . 
  eriksen ca n't be too old either . 
  he 's awesome . 
  markovic could be played as a cam , same with kovacic . 
  firstly , that 's not true at all , and secondly , maybe this subreddit is made of 27000 people with ** different opinions to each other ** , which means sometimes you will see differing viewpoints . 
  no , just that continental western europe is an hour ahead of us . 
  we like to forget about blackpool, 
   top 15, 
  20th in the world, 
  pretty sure people 'd be saying the opposite if fifa put us higher than the elo rankings . 
  he did ? 
  in the post he says '' [ i ] thought i 'd give it go '', 
  have you seen borat ? 
  you *** literally *** ca n't rout from the top level of the citadel . 
  that 's why siege defence is * so * easy . 
  otomo is amazing . 
  as hard as the ikko ikki , but with amazing unique units . 
  no , he was completely serious . 
  scotland 's national team could easily wipe the floor with most teams in the world , let alone europe . 
  i 'm rubbing one out as we speak, 
  nord huscarls ? 
  they rape literally everything , so i do n't see them losing to rhodok spears . 
  the flag is of niger in that picture though, 
  what is this screenshot showing ? 
  then why has he put a question mark at the end of his title ? 
  makes it sound like he 's experienced a glitch or something . 
  yep , 30 swadian knights can easily defeat armies 6x bigger . 
  add a couple of huscarls and you 've got yourself an unbeatable army . 
  cataphracts were in use in the late * western roman empire iirc . 
  it 's greek for `` fully armoured '', 
  pro tip : if you do n't want to be downvoted , do n't ask why you 're being downvoted . 
  how is it any harder ? 
  i speak about fifa - you just plug an extra controller in and you 're done . 
  and arrogant, 
  to be fair to you , you do have a point . 
  wwii was an allied effort . 
  but you seem to make it out like the usa could have done it by themselves . 
  without one of the `` big three '' the war would have been very , very different . 
  but then you say this . 
   two world wars, 
  are you serious ?!, 
  victory in wwi was not dependent on the usa at all !, 
  by the time the americans joined in 1917 , ( and actually were properly involved in 1918 ) , the huge battles of wwi had already been fought . 
  verdun . 
  the somme . 
  by 1918 , the war was conclusively in the allies ' favour . 
  the british navy was blockading the german ports , and their people were starving . 
  austria had already been effectively defeated . 
  so , even if i do ( kind of ) agree with you on your points about wwii , do not try and sneak in a stupid lie about ` merica coming to save france ` like we always do ' . 
  they have great lancers , yes . 
  but the problem is , their top-tier units are no where near as good as the top-tier of the other factions .
