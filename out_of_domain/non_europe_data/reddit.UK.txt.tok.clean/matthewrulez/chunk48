  plus the ai has no idea how to actually horse skirmish . 
  i love how this is n't even exaggeration . 
  20 swadian knights could kill an army of at least 100 of whatever the ai can throw at you . 
  [ step 2 ] ( http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/572/078/d6d.jpg ), 
  should 've seen / r/totalwar when rome ii was released . 
  it was like armageddon . 
  basically this game , rome ii , was incredibly hyped for like 6 months . 
  amazing screenshots , all this talk about how amazing the ai was , interviews with developers about how awesome it 'll be etc. 
  and then it released in september , and it was shocking . 
  i mean , it did n't work for half of the people , and there were some awful , awful design decisions . 
  now the hate has died down a little , and 15 huge patches in , it 's a lot better . 
  but on the [ developer 's youtube channel , ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/thecreativeassembly/videos ) videos are still hugely disliked , most from before september have more dislikes than likes . 
  the subreddit is also divided now between people who love rome ii and people who hate it . 
  what 's really weird is , from his post history , he seems like he is english . 
  something strange is afoot . 
  did you go to school ? 
  or is your information from high school musical ? 
   one of my pet peeves is when someone ~ ~ mentions ~ ~ pretends they 're an aussie , then another ~ ~ aussie ~ ~ american pretending to be australian for the sweet , sweet karma comes along and soon enough every reply is filled with ` cunt ' for no good reason . 
  people from newcastle speak nothing like this . 
  did you watch it ? 
  it was one of the most boring 90 ' of tv ever aired . 
  especially when its an incredibly sweaty pass-back goal . 
  i 'd be fine if it was a 40 yard amazing shot . 
  is n't that way offside ? 
  why ? 
  fuck 'em , not our problem anymore, 
  probably going to be boring and close . 
  england have n't looked great , but on paper we should be winning . 
  england 1-0 switzerland is my bet , but watch it now be 9-2 to switzerland . 
  `` you know what the fellow said -- in italy , for thirty years under the borgias , they had warfare , terror , murder and bloodshed , but they produced michelangelo , leonardo da vinci and the renaissance . 
  in switzerland , they had brotherly love , they had five hundred years of democracy and peace -- and what did that produce ? 
  the difference is , if you kill someone on dayz there is a significant reward for doing it . 
  / r/dayz comments are fucking shit . 
  there 's no discussion , just salty people complaining about bandits , and anyone who disagrees is downvoted wildly . 
  because i find it fun . 
  lose your job and possibly face prison for an indirect insult ? 
  for consoles . 
  on the liverpool - city match it puts you on , i ended on a goalless draw , but i beat liverpool as manchester city 3-0 when i played kick-off . 
  i love how the dribbling is actually responsive and people can change direction nicely . 
  crossing is weird , hard to get balls on target . 
  the goalkeepers seem to make ** insane ** saves every match , like jumping across the entire net to tap out a ball coming through their entire defence with the tip of their index finger . 
  you say you played 2 matches , but you have n't realised once you exit the city/liverpool match you go to the menu where you can turn the difficulty up , and also be any team you want from the demo . 
  rome ii was , and still is , shit . 
  do n't say that over at / r/totalwar . 
  but shogun ii , in my opinion , is the best total war , and honestly one of the best overall historical games . 
  it does what most historical strategy games do at their best - gives the player an accurate representation of the time period , but lets the player change it at will . 
  why do they have to speed up the voice ? 
  he makes good points , but it 's so fucking annoying to listen to . 
  oh and their theme tune is shite . 
  dude , i know the feel , but please , do n't buy anything . 
  save the money for when you *** do *** want to buy something , and then you 'll have the money !, 
  or save up for a holiday . 
  bring in a dutch guy, 
   it 's pretty easy to avoid . 
  not really though - it 's all over / r/unitedkingdom , because he 're it 's very pro-monarchy , it 's all over every mainstream news website/paper , all over tv and everyone will be talking about it . 
  give it 5 years , it might be what it was hyped up to be !, 
  i was always rooting for antony , even though i knew what would happen in the end . 
  he was so fucking cool . 
  brass bands have both baritones and euphoniums . 
  different instruments , different range and sound . 
  his k/d though, 
  he basically goes through the entire french army with the butt of his rifle in sharpe . 
  on my poland-lithuania empire campaign , spain owned all of america and most of western europe . 
  that is the only time in all of my total war playtime that i have felt as if the war i was about to initiate could go either way . 
  * cough * tablet e-book, 
  what 's historically inaccurate about this ? 
  qpr , presumably . 
  if it 's any longer than 10 seconds then your internet is shit, 
  how the fuck is it still 50/50, 
  no , he 's from cali ( fornia ? 
  ) , but his great-great-great-great uncle 's cousin 's daughter 's best friend 's dog was from scotland . 
  exactly !, 
  ask most people in britain the capital of canada and they 'll say either `` i do n't know '' or `` vancouver/toronto '' . 
  same with australia , it 's considered a piece of trivia that the capital of australia * is n't * sydney or melbourne . 
  i was trying to think of a good comparison , and that works . 
  tiberius was a bit of a twat though, 
  even if they do vote independence , it 's hardly going to be `` scotland '' . 
  it 'll be `` slightly more than 50 % of scottish people '', 
  putting apostrophes in every word does n't make it sound scottish, 
  griezmann only 86 ? 
  i played him for 4 seasons and he was a 90, 
  your mum or his ? 
  the greeks did use marble , but i think they mainly used bronze . 
  the romans copied them for many reasons - one is pretty simple , that they wanted a copy for themselves . 
  like people have a copy of a painting in their house . 
  plus i think marble is a lot easier to colour in . 
  ancient egyptian civilization was based around the nile , not the sahara . 
  the nile was and still is one of the most fertile places on earth . 
  how ? 
  they were never based in the sahara . 
  dude , total war * is * rts . 
  if you want penalties in fifa 14 , turn on handballs . 
  that shit is crazy , handballs every cross . 
  if they do this right , then maybe one day we can move 800 years into the future . 
  a total war about another steppe horse archer empire . 
  tim howard was 83 ? 
  even with darthmod/40 units , you 'd have trouble making armies a tenth of the size of real napoleonic armies in napoleon tw . 
   alexander the great 's conquest of west , central , and southern asia ,, 
  alex died 800 years before the tree was alive tho, 
   great wall,
