  memes change , as is the definition of meme . 
  this is in my science book at school , this is n't wtf, 
  the cat could n't give a fuck about the name . 
  the owners can call it what they fucking want , i do n't care , and if you 're offended , be offended . 
  it 's a famously shite newspaper over here in the uk , and should never be taken with any seriousness . 
  yeah fuck the system, 
  where i live , we say `` fell over '' and nobody gives a shit, 
  he also doubles as the artist, 
  lionheart you fucking legend , i 've been waiting for the day for you to post your videos to / r/totalwar . 
  i love all your videos . 
  my friend 's and my tags are, 
  swag, 
  and some others , but just like my username , i hope people take it as ironic . 
  do n't post too many videos , people do n't like getting spammed with videos , but do drop a few in occasionally . 
  also i would love to see you active on this subreddit, 
  big love to everyone , it 's the only subreddit i am part of where i read every comment and even recognise some people , eg `` oh there 's x '', 
  he is using radious mod for shogun, 
  * so brave *, 
  `` fart into the radio ! '', 
  `` yes sir '', 
  then they 'll be slightly loose and i 'll feel insecure, 
  can someone say in what circumstance you play one of these ? 
  is it when you are being blockaded and sally out ? 
  because every success kid is the same, 
  so fucking brave dude, 
  yeah you tell 'em, 
  i believe it 's that new one , chernarus . 
  who , pagans ? 
  you 're very welcome . 
  what if , in a very unlikely circumstance , you had - i do n't know - maybe missed the sale or did n't have enough money ? 
  maybe father christmas is bringing steam wallet vouchers this christmas day ? 
  since when am i in fucking financial trouble , i simply do n't want to buy a steam game today when i could just wait . 
  well then you are missing my point . 
  all i was saying is that if you had n't bought it for one reason or another , it is a great chance to buy these great games again . 
  especially when the sale will tie in with christmas day , when the amount of people buying the games will go up . 
  i am not talking about some homeless man selling his clothes for steam wallet funds . 
  / r/firstworldanarchists, 
  far cry 's story missions are shit , it 's the open world that makes it playable after you finish them, 
  where did you hide the body ? 
  native american warriors are really good if you use them correctly . 
  do n't just go wildly charging into them . 
  use forests to your advantage , and sneak behind their forces , while eliminating their inferior cavalry with yours . 
  this will leave just their main body of troops . 
  try and surround them without them knowing . 
  once you have got a large number of your troops behind the enemies without being spotted , charge a `` suicide '' group from the front for a distraction . 
  as soon as this hits , charge your flanking forces and surround their troops , and use bowmen ( who can fire whilst hidden ) to help destroy them . 
  that 's my tactic . 
  to keep hidden , just move your troops to a forest and ** walk ** wide around them . 
  do n't go into range and do not run . 
  i think the native warriors and bowmen can remain hidden while in certain low grass etc so make sure to check out the terrain and plan a path for them . 
  i do n't really like playing as the native americans . 
  i prefer fighting against them . 
  when firing against cavalry , your line inf will fire at will , as using fire by rank would be stupid , is that your problem ? 
  or if your problem is them firing when they only just come in range or whatever just right click their troops you want to fire upon, 
  that 's very strange then, 
  is that population drop due to germany ? 
  it 's not very obvious . 
  that 's devastating to your opponent . 
  surely the 2290 men must have got more than 3 kills , that 's just embarrassing . 
  yeah sorry , i believe they were 2 different german states , not sure which ones , hence the question mark . 
  darthmod - late campaign, 
  in my defense , i only looked at the flags after i was off etw so i had to guess from memory . 
  it looks a lot like wurttemberg 's flag when it 's very small . 
  as i have said , i am playing with a mod, 
  it does n't really matter, 
  inb4 capital cities are spelled with an ` a ' not an ` o ' . 
  the younger , the more mountains . 
  i assume you died mid-sentence, 
  all the names on napoleonic wars are things like sean bean because - i assume - of the tv series ` sharpe 's rifles ' ( which is awesome ) . 
  all i got from this is to practice pissing in my sink, 
  although i agree with you on your point , i do believe this is actually due to a bug in darthmod which made dagestan gain lots of protectorates, 
  on this same game however i invaded austria 's territories ( as the usa ) and i was just about to take their last two when bavaria swooped in and took one , and the dutch took the other . 
  it annoyed me very much . 
  compared to the older games in the view of the majority of the tw community the newest games such as s2 are very simplified compared to the older generations . 
  just because you think it 's bad , does n't make it a bad game to everyone else . 
  if you are trying to argue your opinion , try and not offend or assume that you are the only person who is right . 
  imo shogun 2 ( singleplayer ) and fots were very well made and very fun to play , not as versatile as say rome or empire but still probably a 8/10 game for me . 
  if you did n't enjoy empire because of it 's bugs , maybe go back and play it now , it 's a hell of a lot better , and is ** in my opinion ** the best total war game evar . 
  i do n't know what you mean in terms of having to know where your armies are and where they are from , is n't that aspect identical to early games ? 
  i could have sworn they said they are keeping the 20 unit limit somewhere, 
  the comments on that video ... 
  is the cave you are living in comfortable ? 
  i need to see a source on this, 
  ahh , he * does * say * `` with land and sea , we 're not going to necessarily go above 40 units that we 've got for fall of the samurai '' *, 
  but in fots if i am not mistaken that 40 unit barrier could only be achieved if you reinforced a 20 unit army with another 20 unit army , and he is saying it will be the same as fots, 
  sometimes though , you 've got to just look at the game and think , fuck , this looks awesome . 
  maybe you are using too much power and/or it is overheating ? 
  $ 2000 for a laptop ? 
  and i 'm sorry , just because you 've got a laptop or ipad does n't at all make your family very well off . 
  i know a lot of people who 's family is living through trouble but who own iphones , laptops and try to save for presents such as these . 
  edit : i apologize , i just saw a macbook for # 1000 . 
  that 's just silly . 
  as sad as it is , it happens . 
  i do n't understand why people waste money on a lot of things , but there you go , that 's life . 
  i genuinly like ant and dec, 
  not very nice, 
  i am in a party with friends, 
  exactly . 
  i think he means drives them to the pub so he can have a pint , not makes him depressed, 
  so you 're saying on average you spent 19.1 hours a day playing this ?
