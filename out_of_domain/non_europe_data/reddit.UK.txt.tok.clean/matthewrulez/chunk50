  * military allies . 
  * trade agreement . 
  * past friendships . 
  * past grievances . 
  i really want one . 
  ** you also ** * made * ** random ** * words * ** italics **, 
  i 'm confused about the uk - there seems to be 2 within gb itself . 
  r u 4 reel, 
  why ? 
  history before 1776, 
  why ? 
  i bet quite a lot of people have the same posters, 
  it 's not 1994 anymore , not exactly a very popular band over here . 
  they split up like 5 years ago , and they were shit for 14 years before that . 
  most reposted thing on this sub, 
  that does n't work, 
  that literally makes no sense, 
  / r/lewronggeneration, 
  were they bugles ? 
  did they have valves ? 
  invaded in summer . 
  educate yourself . 
  this pasta tastes better than dog shit , so in my books it 's really good !, 
  i 'm english, 
  that 's the date today, 
  you are right in some ways , and should n't be downvoted . 
  i do n't agree with what you 're saying completely , but you have valid points . 
   forcible removal of money from a person is theft . 
  nah mate it 's robbery . 
  i disagree with the guy , but bit of a straw man there . 
  somalia 's state is not exactly due to its tax-free policy . 
  though if you play 4 * teams you go against either colombia or cska , so it 's not much better, 
  we just call it the american revolution , but to be fair it is n't taught in schools at all , and no-one in england actually knows/cares about it that much . 
  i still play as cska , it 's just that having both musa and doumbia is pretty god damn sweaty, 
  as much as blackadder is hilarious , i would n't call it an accurate representation of historical events . 
  no , it 's just there 's so much other ( more important/relevant ) history to teach . 
  we learn the history of our country , and there 's plenty more important stuff to teach kids . 
  the majority of people in the uk have n't even heard of that . 
  damn , butthurt americans downvoting me for telling you what little kids get taught in school . 
  the world is n't just about you guys . 
  damn , if only you still had griezmann with vela on the wings . 
  he should n't play . 
  people seem to forget he * bit someone * . 
  yes, 
  add 2 commas to his comment and it makes sense . 
   sociedad is a beautiful club in , in my opinion , one of the most beautiful cities in spain . 
  top 6 seems a bit hopeful , does n't it ? 
  so many good teams in spain , it 'd be really hard for sociedad . 
  you really think there is a connection between being a bully and using a word ? 
  i had lloris , at 29 years old he was 90 , and by my 4th season he was 92 overall . 
  are wales playing in liverpool kits ? 
  i prefer their red & green colours . 
  i pick teams on kits , and i have to say that hamburger sv have the best kit in the bundesliga . 
  10/10 sexiest sock colours in the world, 
  see : the netherlands, 
  some of the artists involved have great songs . 
  well , not them , but bastille , olly murs etc write great pop songs . 
  the only time i 've seen a real-life gun ( when not in america ) was outside downing street . 
  lose . 
  not `` loose '' . 
  what a bellend, 
  you really do n't see how cavalry battles play out ? 
  it 's not natural . 
  they teleport all over the shop , stop , and dance around each other in 1-on-1 duels . 
  regardless , no one can deny the game was just ** awful ** at release . 
  ca blatantly lied to people for money . 
  well i guess that 's good for you . 
  if you do n't notice it then i am envious . 
  back to shogun ii for me . 
  this is n't my video , by the way . 
  but yes he is . 
  he clearly gives his reasons . 
  it 's an expansion . 
  like fall of the samurai is to shogun ii . 
  what ? 
  paying for content that was already modded in ? 
  what else ? 
  the only reason i can possibly see for buying this is the `` unique '' unit roster . 
  all the factions were already modded in . 
  yeah , quite refreshing to see a 17 year old referring to himself as a ' 00s kid ' '', 
  why ? 
  it 's one click to turn it off or on . 
  4 seasons in , scuffet is not going to be less than $ 10 mil, 
  they were already perfectly playable !, 
  all you had to do was one or two clicks to get a fucking mod . 
  not bloody rocket science . 
  i agree a bit with your cherry picking , and i used to agree with your `` the ai charged his general onto your yari ashigaru , along with the rest of his cavalry at the start of the almost every battle . 
  '' , but then i moved the difficulty to very hard . 
  i do n't mean to sound patronizing but seriously , they stop doing that shit . 
  i was n't talking about unit expansion mods , i was talking about the faction unlocks mods . 
  well if you 're alright with paying however much it costs to have that `` official '' feeling , then alright . 
  i kinda get you . 
  it 's just something i would n't do . 
  that 's the dream, 
  if everyone `` knew '' then he would be serving a sentence for manslaughter . 
  sorry , but you can not base a legal system off your gut feelings . 
  * would have, 
  it 's alright . 
  which is actually disappointing , for me , as the other total war games i play ( ed ) are amazing . 
  i 've said this before , but shogun ii is the best game of the series for me , and rome ii is nowhere near it .
