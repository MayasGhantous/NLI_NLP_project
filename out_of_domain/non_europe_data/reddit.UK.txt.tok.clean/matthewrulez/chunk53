  asking on the subreddit for a game if it is good is never going to get you unbiased opinions mate, 
  i agree with you and all , but i do n't think that was at the world cup . 
  no messi . 
  blackadder and fawlty towers, 
  [ it 's shit like this , america . 
  ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/11054506/british-embassy-forced-to-apologise-for-tweet-celebrating-anniversary-of-burning-of-white-house.html ), 
  ^ ^ yes ^ ^ i 'm ^ ^ still ^ ^ mad, 
  is there a way to force this glitch to happen ? 
  what do you have to do to encounter it ? 
  thanks . 
  it 's highly unlikely he wo n't , he was probably the best player at the world cup and has had an amazing start in real madrid . 
  diving does n't get you put in prison if you were n't a footballer though, 
  why ? 
  but why ? 
  it 's just a photo . 
  you do n't have to see it , and even if you did it would n't affect you in any way . 
  it 's just a bit of fun . 
  how does that have * anything * to do with my comment, 
  tbf that is a filthy free kick, 
  i do n't disagree with you , just saying . 
  who is that with that turn ? 
  that 's insane !, 
  anyone can have 9 shots on target . 
  they were probably just shit shots . 
  from england , can confirm this is exactly the mental image i get when i think of an american . 
  just realised telles should say lb , not cb . 
  i need this, 
  that is the most mediocre player in all of fifa, 
  can i have benfica instead of eindhoven ? 
  or is that not allowed ? 
  just realised , that 's awesome . 
  i probably wo n't live up to your expectations !, 
  messi is the only argentinian , xavi the only spaniard and lahm the only german . 
  what 's your point ? 
  true that , literally crying at some of them, 
  dude it 's 2015, 
  slightly unrelated , but what 's the appeal of playing as real madrid/barcelona/bayern munich in career ? 
  anyone with any shred of ability can win the treble in their first season with them . 
  guys , i doubt this is * entirely * serious . 
  surely 7 , not 8 . 
  if he had 4 * skills , he would be my favourite player on career mode . 
  shame . 
  genuine question : to me , that looks like costa was running to the ball and put his foot down , not realising can 's foot would be there . 
  sure it 's a foul , but what could costa have done ? 
  mate it 's like their 3rd best album, 
  revolver and rubber soul for me probably, 
  thx bbe, 
  yeah but minecraft is a fucking awesome game, 
  even if in 1000 executions , one is innocent , i would find it hard to accept that the death penalty is morally acceptable . 
  most interesting animal over here is the fucking badger , and i have n't even seen one of them that was n't run over on the side of the road, 
  rf ibarbo, 
  guaranteed every squad on fut from now on, 
  most of your activity on reddit is dayz related - hardly a beacon of mature milsim gaming . 
  okay then , i apologise about the english part , but do n't you see the hypocrisy in claiming that `` altis life & co , filled with 12 years old wannabe gangster , youtuber , streamer & modder . '', 
  when you lament me for generalising the dayz user base ? 
  40 mins to the north or south of manchester ? 
  can you hum it ? 
  also try looking through the top 40 or whatever the equivalent is where you live, 
  sure it was n't this ? 
  tbh i 'm enjoying his punditry, 
  ikr , occam 's razor, 
  basically paying 50k more for 1 * more wf . 
  where abouts in europe are you talking about ? 
  i appreciate your comment , but people on these kind of threads seem to think that europe = one country . 
   i love the public transportation systems, 
  clearly not the uk then, 
  needs drmic , he 's a monster . 
   attila on the complete opposite side , will be the most polished ,, 
  really ? 
  above shogun ii ? 
  shogun ii is the game i would show people if i wanted to show what total war could be at its best . 
  i still play shogun ii , i have nearly 700 hours in it . 
  there 's no nostalgia involved for me . 
  the game has flaws , sure , but objectively out of all the total wars it is the least buggy and has the most polished mechanics . 
  i digress anyway , the point was , will attila be that good ? 
  not even toty lahm , fucking scrub, 
  dude , dinkledge 's accent is so obviously fake to anyone from britain . 
  y' all need [ greece 's away kit ] ( http://www.futhead.com/15/items/kits/814/ ) in your life, 
  yeah i know , 5 at the back , but what am i meant to do , ignore the fact that it 's the best formation in the game ? 
  yeah mate , i experience it all the time : http://www.damninteresting.com/the-baader-meinhof-phenomenon/, 
  totally agree , my second squad plays 4-3-2-1 and it 's really good going forward , but not quite as *** completely impenetrable *** as the 5-at-the-back, 
  [ i have you res tagged, 
  no apostrophe in `` thanks '' mate . 
  `` scholesy 's taller than that '', 
  wow , first squads here that are n't worth  # 100, 
  i know , bono has n't written anything good for 15 years, 
  shogun ii - not a massive selection of units , the best ui in the franchise and an easy rock-paper-scissors battle system . 
  it 's a great word . 
  what do you find so offensive about it ? 
  it describes the thing perfectly . 
  music is n't an objective `` better than '' . 
  brilliant , adler in net over weidenfeller . 
  because you 'd have to learn not to rely on pace . 
  people here really tend to overrate pace . 
  my top scorer in my club is mandzukic . 
  no , that 's just not how it works . 
  if you ca n't get past division 3 with `` reus/van persie/sanchez '' then it 's not your players that are the bad part of your game . 
  or just - idk - play with them ? 
  so are most of these comments . 
  shameful really .
