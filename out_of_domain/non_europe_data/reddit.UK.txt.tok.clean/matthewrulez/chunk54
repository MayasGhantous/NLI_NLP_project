  claiming wwi as an american victory is like claiming you made a meal because you put salt on it when it arrived at your table, 
  it 's not `` 1500 gmt '' . 
  as of your edit , it was 13:24, 
  you need a certain number of gcses to get into college though - for me it was 5 bs . 
  definitely the hipster choice this game, 
  good job . 
  why would there be an apostrophe in `` scores '' ? 
  i do n't know if it 's just having played hundreds of hours of civ 5 , but i can immediately recognise whether each tile has a resource and which resource it is . 
  maybe it 's because my graphics settings are on max , but sheep are blindingly obviously sheep , cows look like cows , etc. 
  i play with the resource icons on though , they make it much easier to recognise good city locations . 
  that 's great and all , but most people go from gcses -  a levels -  university , so saying `` failure in gcses does n't matter '' is wrong . 
  crossbows are fucking op , i ca n't see why anyone would take bows over them, 
  never thought i 'd say it , but i love them !, 
  makes it so much easier to quickly tell what units are of what type , so i can assess the battle faster . 
  hi , i do n't have an addition but if it 's meant to be 12-bar blues i think that the 5th note only needs to be played for a bar , in this sort of pattern :, 
  love this loop !, 
  really do . 
  http://onlinesequencer.net/70839 obviously these ideas , in a full song , would n't all be smushed together at the start . 
  you could easily build a great tune out of this thing you 've composed . 
  guys . 
  capit ** a ** l. please ^ stop ^ ^ typing ^ ^ ^ capitol, 
  dude are we the same person, 
  seriously i 'm not trying to be offensive or anything . 
  it 's just a really common mistake people make that bothers me . 
  it 's instant for me , so your internet must n't be very good . 
  in my opinion he is an incredible player , amazing at set pieces . 
  who are you ? 
  he 's the best pundit on motd ( which is n't hard ) . 
  you do n't need high rated players . 
  your team costs literally millions of coins , whereas my div . 
  1 team costs comparatively very little . 
  these motherfuckers really hating on aladdin ? 
  bollocks . 
  everyone has a sense of rhythm , and it 's mostly learnt . 
  also , i doubt there are many people on earth that could consistently keep a tempo without wavering . 
  that 's why we have metronomes . 
  never heard someone in england say the short `` a '' sound as an `` o '' . 
  you need to improve your accent game fam, 
  what i do n't get is why people want him . 
  for 140k you could buy 140 giovani dos santos ' , who has basically the same stats with better dribbling and pace . 
  only people i can imagine saying `` fom '' are the royal family , but i 'll take your word for it since no one uses fam un-ironically where i live up north . 
  also might include sheffield which is huge, 
  huge for the uk mate, 
  it is . 
  / r/conspiracy, 
  at this point , maybe it 's his players who are n't the weak link . 
  i 'm just jealous that people have a bit of money to splash around on ut players . 
  than united at the minute , yeah , i 'd take liverpool 's players . 
  do n't think that 's how `` no offence '' works . 
  because we 've never needed to - there 's never been an evolutionary advantage to closing our ears , therefore we never developed the ability to . 
  well in fairness , australia is massive . 
  like , nearly the size of the contiguous us massive . 
  i do n't know if it actually does , or we just hear about it more from our anglo-centric media - * cough * reddit . 
  but most of australia is a massive inhospitable desert , so i guess that the more deadly an animal is , the more likely it is that it will kill and catch any prey that it finds , meaning that the deadly animals live and reproduce whilst the less successful un-deadly animals do n't get to eat . 
  well you would n't , you 're german . 
  people lie about their age , ofc they 're going to lie about what division they 're in . 
  it 'll be like  90 % saying division 1 . 
  the only `` uncommon '' part of that team is totti . 
  round my end , cheap means like drmic or something , not the most expensive st in the bundesliga . 
  ^ apart ^ from ^ if ^ auba, 
  did you read the thread or are you just posting your squad ? 
  how the hell is that `` uncommon '' . 
  it 's uncommon in the fact that no one can afford that . 
  i think of the show as a fantasy , based off the viking sagas . 
  people trying to defend the historical accuracy of the show are as pointless as the people pointing out the incredibly inaccurate points . 
  ... or he 's shit, 
  there 's one rule on this sub and u fucking broke it, 
  \\  bpl, 
  \\  no southampton players, 
  who ? 
  i just know it 'll be cloudy . 
  yes - blood vessels are tiny . 
  there are millions of them . 
  i remember when i first started supporting shalke , as soon as southampton moved out of the top 4 . 
  does n't rhyme bro, 
  loose rhymes with moose, 
  booze rhymes with ** lose **, 
  it was irl a loss for the greeks . 
  yeah they did n't expect to win , but it did n't * really * achieve much . 
  forgetting the dreams all the women had that were the same , and how he appeared exactly how they had dreamt . 
  ahh england , land of the madman, 
  if the dutch play like they did against them in their qualifying match where iceland won 2-0 , then they have a good shot, 
  not enough pace for wing , not enough defence for mid . 
  cam is his best fifa position . 
  mate , i like the song , but that 's stretching it a bit . 
  he 's clearly just merged greeks/romans , not caring/knowing about the historical accuracy . 
  his lyrics are brilliant most of the time . 
  some really clever stuff . 
  ah yes , the good ol' kingdom of britain , founded in the year 1215 ad, 
  you 're presumably american , so do n't realise that english does not mean british . 
  manchester represent, 
  *** so *** last year , southampton is the way to go, 
  the people that made those legislative decisions are not the everyday person , they 're politicians . 
  but i do n't seem to understand what you 're getting at - firstly , europe is n't one big culture . 
  what are your `` assumptions about social and sexual culture in the uk '' ? 
  i 'll try to answer , as an english person . 
  [ the uk is divided into little sections ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/2010ukelectionmap.svg/640px-2010ukelectionmap.svg.png ) , and in each of these little sections the population vote for a member of parliament ( mps ) . 
  these are their representatives in parliament , and are a member of a political party . 
  there are 650 mps elected into the house of commons . 
  the leader of the party that has the majority of mps in the house of commons becomes prime minister , as well as being an mp for a place .
