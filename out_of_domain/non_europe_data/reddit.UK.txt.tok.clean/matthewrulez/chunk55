  i 'm in division 1 on pc and i do n't ( or very rarely ) experience any problems like you do . 
  also when i come against really high rated teams , totys etc , i actually get excited b/c i know the player is going to be considerably worse than a div 1 player who got there using your average team .

  been thinking about this for a few days , since i heard it in a song .

  [ all four awards in one month went to my team : best goal , potm , motm , ypotm .

  like seriously , if you keep possession , do n't make risky passes ever , you ** will ** win . 
  the ai is great at build-up play , sure , but their shooting is terrible . 
  they never take long shots , never switch the play , and are very predictable . 
  and , as someone 's already said , if you score first , it 's virtually impossible to lose . 
  mate i 'm not rachmaninoff but if you gave me a few piano lessons i 'd be able to play better than my mates, 
  elm is sick ig though,

  wait - you do n't have a proper shower ? 
  where do you live ? 
  are you talking about pan-european competitions , or each country 's leagues ? 
  each country has a league system , where teams ( usually 18-20 ) compete . 
  the bottom 2-3 are relegated to the lower league , and the highest are promoted to the next highest league . 
  for example , i will use the english league :, 
  premier league ( highest division ) -  lowest 3 teams relegated to the championship ( the second division ) . 
  the championships lowest teams are relegated to the rather confusingly named league one , and their best 3 teams are promoted to the premier league . 
  pretty simple . 
  as the top teams in the highest division ca n't be promoted any higher , they , depending on their position in the table , are entered into the next seasons european competitions - the champions league , into which the top teams from each european league either go straight into or are entered into qualifiers for . 
  the amount of teams from each league depends on how well their league performs on average in european competitions , so , for example , england gets 4 champions league spots , whilst the dutch league only gets 1 guaranteed spot , and their second best team enters the qualifiers . 
  after the champions league spots are the places for the euro league , which follows the same format but is larger , allowing lots of teams from the less powerful european leagues , such as ukraine , greece , and belgium . 
  ** international competitions **, 
  aside from official uefa/fifa international competitions , there 's also friendlies between countries that take place every few months on `` international breaks '' . 
  there happens to be an international break on just now , which has matches that include friendlies and qualifiers for next years , ** euro 2016 ** . 
  this is a competition with a near identical format to the world cup ( group stages -  knockouts ) except just for members of the european football association uefa . 
  at the moment , all 54 uefa members are in qualifying groups of 6 , of which the top two after they 've completed all their matches are qualified for the group stages of euro 2016 . 
  you can see the current standings here : http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/season=2016/standings/, 
  the next world cup will be in russia in 2018 . 
  most of what i 've said here applies to the majority of other continents/associations ; eg leagues playing for champions league spots for their continent , and international competitions specific to a continent , [ such as asia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_afc_asian_cup ) or [ africa ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_africa_cup_of_nations ) . 
  slight bias here , but the english premier league is the most followed , at least i think , in the world , purely because it 's entertaining and also the second most valuable ( in terms of players ) in the world . 
  plus i think it 's on american tv a lot , / r/soccer seems to have a lot of americans in it . 
  it 's currently only got about 8 games per team left - [ here 's the table at the moment ] ( http://www.premierleague.com/en-gb/matchday/league-table.html ) - and the next games will be next weekend . 
  you can see that the teams at the top of the table are fighting for the top 4 places , as they are the champions league places . 
  quick guide : chelsea are pretty much guaranteed to win at this point , and everyone hates them , the manchester clubs and arsenal will be trying to bag their top 4 finish , and liverpool and tottenham will also want to be there . 
  southampton are doing better than anyone expected . 
  other leagues of note are the spanish la liga ( liga bbva ) , where you 've probably heard of real madrid or barcelona , the two most expensive and arguably best teams in the world , with the two best players in the world , ronaldo and messi . 
  also competing for the title of `` best team in the world '' is the german bundesliga 's bayern munich . 
  [ we 're also up to the quarter finals of the champions league , which should be great .

  i was having this issue , and it turned out that my cpu was overheating . 
  it probably is n't the case , but download a program that monitors your cpu temps and look at it while playing fifa .

  what game were you playing ? 
  it 's always been full of kids , since like beta . 
  the fan base has always been majority children - just look at the most popular youtube videos : yogscast etc are and were popular with mostly kids . 
  you 're looking through the glasses of nostalgia mate, 
  ` ave it, 
  he 'd just lost 7-0 to qpr as well , and after this match he showed interest in the man city job and was fired immediately . 
  i was in tears , was n't thinking to press f12 , just grabbed my phone . 
  i mean when your friend goes 6-0 down in 16 minutes , you ca n't think straight . 
  so fucking good , you do n't have to be a history nerd to like/understand it .

  people do n't actually `` circlejerk '' to zlatan here . 
  it 's either people pretending to do so in the name of irony ( eg all the april fool 's day things ) or people circlejerking about how people circlejerk to ibra . 
  but maestro is an english word , not originally , but it 's still an english word . 
  so confused reading this , since all these place names are in the uk too,
