  sweden ? 
  norway ? 
  the netherlands ? 
  poland ? 
  the czech republic ? 
  hungary ? 
  to be honest i ca n't think of anywhere in europe where you would `` get lynched '' . 
  and you should n't generalise all of europe into one country . 
  ayyyy, 
  mhmm, 
  not just that , but he was portrayed like he had autism/asperger 's . 
  it 's in context with the rest of the sketch . 
  the two men are telling their relative about how gay people should be allowed to marry , and the line before `` what do you think , curtis '' is `` besides , everyone should be treated equally '', 
  well the confederacy was born b/c they wanted slavery . 
  so the flag is a symbol of a ` country ' that was born out of racism . 
  makes you proud to be british, 
   the point is phones and the internet make it easier to become out of touch with people, 
  ignoring the fact that they do the complete opposite, 
  ah yes , the famous asians thiago silva and pel\u00e9, 
  great joke , original, 
  or chicharito , he 's not starter material for rm but could easily be a top striker for an upper mid-table team anywhere in europe, 
  i 'm sorry for your affliction, 
  no queen and the font is n't fancy as fuck mate, 
  easy cheesy stuff like `` what does respect mean to you '' and `` who is your role model '' . 
  chrismd 's things that are n't pack openings are funny . 
  i like them , but again nothing can really compare to the quality of spencer 's . 
  love that one , the lyrics make me laugh every time . 
  [ laf ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnnlyybywqq ) is one of my favourites, 
  also ca n't help singing along to that [ busy earnin ' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcsfftwluf0 ) one . 
  contrary to the rest of the thread i think that avicii one is easily one of the worst - pretentious shite lyrics and an annoying tune . 
  weak by his standards of good pop songs . 
  i think this soundtrack is one of the best fifa soundtracks ever . 
  it has so many good songs , only a couple of weak ones . 
  14 was utterly atrocious , apart from that john newman one . 
  the humour comes from the fact that his `` specific tastes '' are `` you 've got a pulse and you are breathing/you 're just my type '', 
  only if it 's straight after two headed boy , the transition is dank, 
  if you see piles of rocks , do n't knock them over and you 'll be fine . 
  that sub is filled with americans trying to be english but sounding like twats, 
  so true, 
   when writing a noun ( person , place , thing , or idea ) . 
  only proper nouns , which are what you have said without `` things '' . 
  nouns such as `` cup '' and `` dog '' are n't capitalised . 
  that 's facebook dude, 
  brings a tear to my eye, 
  oh come on mate it was still a group in which the usa were 3rd or 4th favourites . 
  the usa were great in the world cup , better than us and were a success story . 
  do n't anti-circlejerk too hard . 
  is n't dost more like a huntelaar ? 
  the epitome of poaching and hold-up play . 
  not what would fit the system . 
  griezmann is already `` surprisingly big '' , he was great in la liga for real sociedad and since simeone had the fantastic idea of converting him to a striker he 's one of the best ( just outside the top 10 i 'd say ) in the world . 
  which is hands down the best youtube channel of a league . 
  shit yeah lol, 
  still fight me, 
  the lyrics on that entire album are some of the most accurate/funniest in music . 
  '' * there 's only music , so that there 's new ringtones * '', 
  i 'll get downvoted for saying this but bayern munich might be in for a shot of winning the german premier division 1 . 
   rudiger 's ~ ~ really good ~ ~ has 80 pace anyway . 
  it 's brilliant because the guy you are replying to is a clear racist . 
  check out his submissions/comments . 
  what a disgusting twat . 
  nah fair fucks to the kid , i mean it might have given everyone cancer but he was confident enough to do it . 
  either that or he had absolutely no self-awareness . 
  is this the navy seal copypasta ? 
  modest mouse vs arcade fire :, 
  the suburbs, 
  funeral, 
  the moon & antarctica, 
  the lonesome crowded west, 
  ca n't deal with his sharp breaths between each phrase , like he 's really nervous or something . 
  once i noticed , i ca n't un-hear it . 
  just listened to everything everything - get to heaven and it is fantastic . 
  the album 's first half especially is incredible . 
  tagging you so when you 're posting about your career mode in fifa 16 i can link you to this . 
  you 've played how many matches ? 
  unrelated , but his free kicks make me moist, 
  ukraine 's best player . 
  does n't sound like a lot , but ukraine has a relatively decent team . 
  he was really impressive when i watched him for kiev in the euro league . 
  damn , that 's my dream in life . 
  being on pc though the market is completely fucked so i 've only got sif eremenko . 
  his longshots are dastardly though . 
  really expensive , and sometimes extinct . 
  that squad looks so awesome , sif tosic is so good !, 
  i use this : http://www.futhead.com/15/squads/36760102/ , but it 's my rotation squad with a solid la liga team . 
  that 's why there are hardly any goals scored on fifa 15 . 
  british *, 
  he 's brilliant though . 
  just does n't look like it for argentina . 
  he was their top scorer though . 
  used spotify, 
  him and falcao top scorers in the first season every time . 
  ironic really . 
  if you use a \\ it does n't appear . 
  \\ #correctformatting, 
  there 's like 6 mullers in the game, 
  surely you hear the rattling every time you strum ? 
  how ? 
  the real saying is that `` a rolling stone gathers no moss '' . 
  it was on at work the other day and there 's not even that many good looking people on it anymore .
