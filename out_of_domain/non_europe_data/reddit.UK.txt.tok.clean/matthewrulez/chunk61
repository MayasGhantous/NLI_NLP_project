  i still mistreat the welsh, 
  wigan is just down the road, 
  when your corner gets headed clear by an opposition defender , straight to their striker who is 1v1 with your last cb . 
  when you 're on `` balanced '' . 
  [ this video sums up my thoughts ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rytckgav0bm ), 
  i 'm really surprised to see comments that agree with the banning of an artist from the country for his work . 
  especially here , this sub would be the first place to laugh at news and politicians blaming gun violence in america on computer games or whatever . 
  but as soon as it 's someone or something * they * do n't like , well who cares !, 
  mongs . 
  / u/isreactionarybot matthewrulez, 
  decent league one side that , with cuadrado and salah tearing it up, 
  spain 's starting xi in their last game had 3 players from barcelona and 2 real madrid , so idk what people think when they say the spain squad is just real and barca . 
  oh and to be fair , on paper , the spain squad is ridiculous . 
  they * should * be amazingly good . 
   hollywood, 
  we 're not talking about films though ? 
  mbdtf is acclaimed and always is in the runnings for `` best album of 2010 '' or `` best rap albums ever '' so idk what you 're on about, 
  i know it 's a joke but that word does n't look remotely welsh . 
  double `` y '' does n't happen i do n't think , because it 's a vowel . 
  needs more `` ll '' . 
  and anyone who thinks modric is lower than an 87 clearly has never watched a football game . 
  rather be by clean bandit, 
  the scenes if it was an ireland - ni match, 
  dude we beat switzerland away , we 're going to win the euros, 
  did someone vomit on your pile of feet, 
   wing 's, 
   shot 's, 
   work 's, 
  there 's no ' in any of those words . 
  you do n't just stick one in every time there 's an s. 
  it does that on 15, 
  because of the move from left winger/forward to full on striker . 
  he 's brilliant there . 
  one of the best in the world . 
  why would that feature be removed ? 
  alcacer is such a legend in fifa , now with 88 potential , that is insane . 
   as long as their will be religion there will be war, 
  as long as there are people there will be war , would you propose banning people ? 
  transatlanticism by death cab . 
  definitely a concept album and it is probably my favourite that has not already been said . 
  but yeah let me rehash hospice and itaots, 
  lmao sociedad finished 7th the season before and that was with griezmann . 
  moyes came in when sociedad were near the bottom of the table and got them a slightly disappointing 12th , but it was n't a huge drop off . 
  drop d was invented well before black sabbath, 
  ball roll and fake shot are the best 2 skill moves in the game . 
  they 're so easy to master and a quick ball roll can completely demolish defenses . 
  very obvious joke, 
  butland was so good , england 's 2nd keeper surely ? 
  `` have a day off mate '', 
  pretty certain it 's mdma, 
  he is gurning so badly though, 
  not hard tbh, 
  to be fair to her , most if not all of the scenarios in the song are actually ironic . 
  from the oxford english dictionary : `` a state of affairs or an event that seems deliberately contrary to what one expects and is often wryly amusing as a result '', 
  i do n't know why you would n't have smalling as one of your centre backs . 
  him and hart are the two in the england xi that are unquestionable . 
  i 'd have him over sanchez, 
  uniform colours are classic `` prussian blue '' and red , and if you look closely you can kinda see the eagle on the regimental standard, 
  crying with laughter ? 
  that 's not too unusual ( ? ), 
  are n't the cradle of civilisation dlcs maps ? 
  just start a new game and select the map ? 
   i cant think of a top team without several black players being integral to it . 
  the op is an idiot but this is a weird statement . 
  real madrid and barcelona ? 
  you just ignored everything he said though . 
  julius caesar was indeed `` just a man '' but you 're ignoring the fact that he was/is one of the most influential people in history . 
  mercedes, 
  tennis court remix is an absolute classic session song . 
  the music video is incredible . 
  did you roll it with baccy ? 
   however , they could be dangerous if you do n't know how to safely handle them . 
  they 're surely more dangerous if you ** do ** know how to handle them . 
  this is big news in the uk , so idk what people are talking about when they say people outside of the us do n't care . 
  yes , to the user . 
  problem with that is ... 
  yeah , i doubt that they 're english . 
  not even a slight challenge to understand their accents . 
  voice is n't emma watson-like , it 's chavvy af . 
  listen to how she says easy - ** uh **, 
  it 's one of the most simple rules no ? 
  i mean it 's better than any of us could do , but it 's hardly a fine piece of sculpturing . 
  bollocks , there were african empires before colonisation . 
  chavvy = fucking google it if you do n't know what it means you twat, 
  that 's fantastic but has nothing to do with his argument . 
  africa would never look like this without colonisation , that is one of the biggest piles of rubbish i 've read . 
  stop trying to sound english , you 're embarrassing yourself, 
  still be a while away from me mate , have to fork out a ridiculous price to get here by train, 
  lets just say he 's not a vigin anymore , 
  hmm it 's still a bit of a shithole, 
  no chorley 's shit as well . 
  when is gaya supposed to be back ? 
  yorkshire really need a big team . 
  for their population , leeds , sheffield , bradford etc need to step their game up . 
  west and south yorkshire are fucking hugeeeeeeee though , compare it to ( historical ) lancashire and it 's odd that they do n't have at least a couple of premier league teams . 
  the gunshot sounds are g, 
  well yeah , with that attitude, 
  exactly how i feel . 
  yeah when someone who is influential or was a great musician like bowie dies it 's a little sad , but not personally . 
  people use it as a topic to get attention on social media .
