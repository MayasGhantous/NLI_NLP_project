  people just drive over them anyway . 
  i have n't ( yet ) joined the reddit brigade - i want to join as i got bored of my other regiment ( i was 2nd lt of the 5th brigade 95th rifles ) and i looked around here and thought it looked good but i really want a change of pace , i love playing as cavalry but never got to as i was a skirmisher . 
  anyway yeah to join your cavalry , should i just join a normal regiment or is there a specific person i need to speak to ? 
  the ikko-ikki , whose rise to power and glory had been the result of not so much their military prowess , but rather their huge armies of peasants who rose up to defend their faith , had experienced unlikely success in japan . 
  within 10 years of the first war against their rival clans , the ikko-ikki along with the ikko faith had spread to encompass the area around kyoto , spreading from coast to coast . 
  this achievement was attributed to the strange successes of mobs of armed , unfearing ashigaru of the ikko against the armies of the like of the lesser clans , such as the hattori , and the bessho . 
  the generals and leaders of the ikko-ikki were given basic guidelines to follow in attack ( or defense ) : the front line of yari ashigaru hold the enemy in place , whilst the bows of the ikko rain onto them . 
  once the spears are tired and weakening , a second line of loan sword ashigaru charge into the enemy , swarming them and cutting them into pieces . 
  this battle plan had been used to high success for many years , and the ikko war machine was yet to be stopped . 
  but then , at a field just outside of kyoto , the ikko-ikko army met their match , in the form of an army , lead by the daimyo of the hojo clan . 
  pulling back to a hill , the ikko deployed in their usual formation , expecting the same results . 
  but this battle was different . 
  they were equal in numbers - this was not unusual - but the enemy had not an army of peasants . 
  the hojo had an entire army of well disciplined and deadly samurai . 
  nevertheless , he ikko general assured his men of victory . 
  the first wave of katana-armed samurai hit the ikko spear wall . 
  almost immediately , the effects of this devastating charge were felt as many hundreds fell to hojo blades . 
  the spear wall did stand , however , and many hojo samurai fell to the yari . 
  but after hours of fighting , both generals were forced to commit all troops . 
  the loan sword charge was not as successful as previous battles . 
  both sides continued to charge and slaughter each other , and the battle was looking to be a hojo success . 
  however , in quick thinking , the general himself and a unit of warrior monk cavalry , elite forces only used when in dire need , were sent to strike at the back lines . 
  this caused mass routing as hojo katana samurai were no match for the general 's blade . 
  as the last of the hojo retreated , there was no victory . 
  although the hojo had run , and would not threaten the safety of the clan for many years , the ikko-ikki had not won . 
  they had not only lost thousands on the bloody field , but the battle showed a new breed of army - those of elite and well disciplined units - had come about . 
  the time of the ikko-ikki massed ashigaru was no more . 
  literally gandhi, 
  since bnw came out barbarians have been doing more damage to me than anyone else . 
  me and my friends were just playing multiplayer and about 15 turns in i saw 3 barbarian horsemen , a few spearmen and about 4 archers come at my city , basically rendering me useless until i wasted my production on like 15 spearmen who kept dying . 
  it completely broke my civ and i quit out of frustration . 
  my other friend had a city taken down to no health by a barbarian , and then the mongols came in and took both of his cities as his entire army was wiped out by fucking barbs . 
  just saw this in the pcgamer review and nearly exploded with happiness :, 
  `` but romans can construct auxiliary barracks that will let you recruit other factions ' units properly . '', 
  options , battle interface . 
  does installing onto an ssd make any difference in loading times etc ? 
  i have either a choice between 4gb of extra ram ( already have 4gb ) , or an ssd . 
  do n't ask why i have this choice , just do . 
  ** edit ** turns out i posted 4 times , kept getting a `` 502 error '' . 
  before i say anything , i have 100 + hours on rome ii , and have enjoyed a lot of it . 
  i am on hard . 
  here is a picture of my empire : http://i.imgur.com/twivcgp.jpg, 
  237 units recruited . 
  of these , all of them are land units . 
  i disbanded my first navy as soon as i realised how useless they are . 
  in total , i have lost 5 full units in my entire campaign . 
  this says a lot of the difficulty of my campaign . 
  291 battles , of which 83 i have fought . 
  the other 200 i autoresolved because they were either basically an entire roman legion against 2 levy spears , or an army of mine against a large army of 80 % slingers , which i can not be bothered with . 
  291 battles . 
  38 of them were land battles , the rest were settlements . 
  did n't ca say that there would be more focus on land battles ? 
  well in shogun 2 i had way more open land stack vs stack battles than this . 
  it 's silly . 
  i lost 10 % of my battles , and most of these were hopeless settlement battles where i had 3 plebs and a levy against a small force the ai decided to use to take an empty backwater settlement instead of defending their capital . 
  \\ #battleai, 
  what 's the best thing i can use for high-quality screenshots ? 
  steam makes them awful , and fraps is hardly any better . 
  is the text that important for me to have to bump into your back and awkwardly say sorry a few times ? 
  the game runs smoothly for me , i get like 50fps on very high , but every 30 seconds or so it drops down to 1fps and then back up after 2 seconds . 
  really really annoying and making my game just unbearable to play . 
  anyone got any advice ? 
  sorry about this , i just need clarification , and you guys are the best , but after playing about 30 minutes of singleplayer bf4 , at high settings with my gtx 660 , and getting around 60fps constantly , no stuttering apart from loading sometimes , i decided to go on multiplayer . 
  as soon as i get it , i get incredible stuttering , i will be running at 60fps then suddenly for 3 seconds i wo n't even get 2 frames in , and then it goes back to 60fps . 
  i tried doing everything , updated all drivers , lowered settings down to the minimum which just makes my inbetween-stuttering fps go to about 130 . 
  is it my computer , or is this something that will be fixed server side ? 
  i 've played probably hundreds of hours of battlefield over the years , and recently , especially in 3 and more so in 4 , i have found that my games go like this :, 
  spawn in on vehicle - the enemy all gang up on me and kill whatever i 'm in . 
  spawn on squad mate , running with a group of our team . 
  i am the first to be sniped from across the map . 
  spawn in somewhere . 
  i run , and within 10 seconds i am dead to an enemy that i just did n't see . 
  spawn in again . 
  this time i try to play more conservatively . 
  i shoot at an enemy that has n't spotted me , he turns round and kills me . 
  i spawn as assault . 
  at this point i am really quite annoyed , i seem to be the only one who is dying repeatedly . 
  so assault 's op guns should help me out at least . 
  but alas , either a helicopter or jet that only seems to be aiming for me kills me . 
  most of my matches end with me with a k/d of like 3-10 or 2-7 . 
  i would n't care if i was having fun . 
  but i 'm not . 
  i really need some tips and a way to just improve , youtube videos would even be sufficient . 
  i am just getting really infuriated at my inadequacy . 
  tl ; dr : need tips/videos that will help me be better, 
  right , i 've always defended rome ii on the grounds that it was an ambitious project that would be fixed eventually , so we 'd just wait and it 'd be the total war we 'd all love . 
  well this battle tipped me over the edge . 
  i am playing in / r/thearvernisuccession 's game , which i will persevere to bring out my story by the end of the week , and i was attacked in italy by 3-4 armies all at once by carthage , against my garrison army . 
  [ take a look at this screenshot . 
  there are so many things wrong with this battle , and this game , that just ruin it . 
  this is not the first time this has happened to me . 
  it 's probably the tenth or eleventh time that the ai has just sat outside a siege , and i am forced to spend 20 minutes waiting . 
  this is one of the many occasions where the naval ai is unable to physically fit its boats onto the beach to land , and is forced to sit there . 
  this is a massive flaw in game design that is inexcusable . 
  who would n't have realised that during big battles there would n't be enough landing space ? 
  ridiculous . 
  and of course , this is definitely not the first time i have experienced one of these battles - where you and your measly garrison army slaughter thousands upon thousands of heavily armoured trained men , because the ai is so * fucking * inept it is incapable of victory against anyone with just a little experience of the game . 
  they just land their troops and one by one charge every man , skirmishers and hoplites , into a spear wall , or into a mosh pit of celtic warriors , where they do not hold the advantage . 
  i 've seen bad ai in total war , but nothing on this scale . 
  on ** empire ** on the hardest difficulties you would see a measly peasant indian army at least * try * to outflank and use their melee advantage , but on `` very hard '' battle difficulty here it 's the same intelligence as a fucking chimp , but with added morale boosts .
