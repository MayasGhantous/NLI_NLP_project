  fuck all that . 
  i am going to continue this game , so not to let down the community of / r/thearvernisuccession , but i sure as hell do n't want to go near this game again . 
  not until i see any reason as to why this is n't the worst total war title to date . 
  i apologize to all the people i argued with over the state of the game , and now see the error of my ways . 
  [ here 's a link to the part i know , played on sibelius . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rynahsapjms&feature=youtu.be ), 
  it 's a woman on vocals , always on films where a party scene is involved , and has probably been on loads of games . 
  it 's from the early 2000s or 90s , probably . 
  could be anytime , i do n't even care i just need to know what it is or i will explode . 
  please help !, 
  this always confused me . 
  the usa fought for independence from the british in the 1770s - 1780s , and fought each other in the war of 1812 . 
  but by the 20th century it is to my understanding that we were allied , with the americans joining wwi and wwii on our side . 
  this could of course just be simply to protect trade or whatever . 
  whenever i press space to look at my troops ' movement , the little green dots only show up for a fraction of a millisecond . 
  if i hold it for long enough , they seem to flash repeatedly but this only works if i am still . 
  i will get a video if needed , but does anyone have a way of fixing this ? 
  error, 
  game disconnected : could not join server .

  game disconnected : could not join server . 
  every fucking server i try, 
  i ca n't play a fucking game, 
  what is happening, 
  so yeah if anyone 's got some idea of a fix that 'd be great, 
  *** double prefacing : this thread has been linked in / r/whiterights ***, 
  ** i must preface this with the fact that i am a bad historian but am just angry **, 
  so i am/was arguing with a racist over at [ this ], 
  ( http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiratard/comments/1wh07o/til_white_men_only_rape_white_women/cf293u6 ) thread , and to make his point he links me to this site here . 
  so i clicked on it , expecting some drivel , but i was surprised at how fucking angry it made me . 
  i 'm going to just pick a few examples of the bad history here , but have fun going through it yourself . 
  ** `` fact '' # 2 : throughout 6,000 years of recorded history , the black african negro has invented nothing . 
  really ? 
  come on !, 
  did black people literally have * nothing * before the whites came along ? 
  i 'm not even going to bother getting examples of specific items invented , because that would just be insulting . 
  there 's a lot here which is n't bad history , but bad science , statistics and pure racism . 
  here 's a good quote from it : `` negroes and other races should be classified as different species . '', 
  ** fact # 49 : the constitution was written by and for ` we the people '' and dedicated to `` ourselves and our posterity , '' all of the 55 delegates that met in philadelphia to draft the constitution and all of the members of the 13 state conventions that ratified it were of the white race . 
  what does that even prove ? 
  there were no black people because the majority of the population that were n't slaves were white , especially the upper classes . 
  however i am not very good at american history so someone help me out here . 
  it goes on to drivel on about how portugal , because it is the `` most homogeneous '' country in europe `` has produced virtually nothing in 100 years and by most standards is the most backward nation in europe . '', 
  by that i assume he means that they have stayed peaceful for all those years . 
  ** fact # 56 : haiti once had a promising future . 
  before 1789 as a french colony under white rule , san domingo ( haiti ) was as rich or richer in productivity as all the 13 american colonies combined . 
  it was considered the `` crown jewel '' of the french colonial system , and was in fact the most prosperous colony anywhere in the world . 
  populated by 40,000 whites , 27,000 freed mulattoes , and 450,000 black slaves and with a bountiful climate and productive soil , it supplied all of france and half of europe with sugar , coffee , and cotton . 
  ahh , it was so good back in the days when the whites ruled over black people as if they were cattle . 
  ~ ~ not exactly bad history ~ ~ , just blatant `` slavery was good '' rattle . 
  after speaking about how the white egyptian master race was corrupted by nubian black slaves , this appears . 
  ** fact # 65 : by the time of king tut ( 1370-1352 b.c. ), 
  even the ruling classes had been mongrelized and egypt began a tailspin downward . 
  today , the once-mighty egypt is very much a third world country , having lost its art , its medicine , its architectural ability , and its position in world affairs . 
  wait , so in the new kingdom of egypt it was already declining ? 
  they had ramesses ii , called `` the great '' for a reason . 
  of course , egyptian society and culture kind of broke down eventually , and its position in the world is not exactly up there with the [ usa ] ( https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:and9gcssz3py6cl1ejqwqvxtaamuqxbhgphsnvf9dgom_jq34-vk8gvs ) at the moment . 
  and that is all the blacks ' fault . 
  nothing to do with , idk , getting invaded a few times , by the persians , macedonians and then romans ? 
  and then the muslim caliphates , the ottomans , the british etc. 
  there 's plenty of reasons other than conquest of why they fell , none are because of the genetics of black people . 
  ** fact # 66 : white people have lived in south africa much longer than negroes . 
  [ no ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bantu_peoples ), 
  ** ( black people ) appear incapable of forming any extensive plans of government or conquest **, 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/songhai_empire ) [ no .

  i ca n't be bothered with this . 
  i never wanted any of this . 
  why are people so ignorant ? 
  it really makes me sad . 
  in your opinion , what is better ( on rome ii ) to have as the mainstay of your army - pikes or hoplites . 
  me and my friend are playing a epirus/seleucid co-op , me as epirus , and i am planning on invading rome , if that helps . 
  any advice would be nice , thanks . 
  does anyone know why this has happened or a way of getting rid of it ? 
  i fixed it by reinstalling the entire game . 
  stupid . 
  say once flight is researched , natural wonders should start producing tourism . 
  this puts more of an incentive on settling on all natural wonders , not just the good ones , and it makes perfect sense . 
  people go to see mt. 
  fuji , uluru and the great barrier reef all the time !, 
  is it just me , or does the food -  starvation mechanic on rome ii only make the ai have a harder time of winning ? 
  what i mean is , the starvation of armies losing their strength and sometimes even dying without fighting a battle only ever in my experience effects the ai , making them even less of a challenge . 
  in all the games i 've played , i 've hit minus food like twice , and only for a few turns at most , but the ai always seems to be starving . 
  it 's silly . 
  i recently spawned after not playing for a month or two . 
  spawned in berezino , ran across the map collecting gear and then looted the nwaf . 
  i have everything i could possibly need , i think - m4a1 with suppressor and acog , magnum , loads of ammo , a 35 slot backpack full of food and drinks , plenty more shit that means i could just stay alive on my own . 
  i need inspiration as to what to do now . 
  i 've got this far before , but i end up running down south and getting sniped without putting anything to use . 
  any ideas would be appreciated . 
  this is the `` large islands '' map : http://i.imgur.com/t4sydsw.png, 
  this is the `` tiny islands '' map : http://i.imgur.com/e3xaooo.png, 
  every random generation of these maps show that the tiny islands map has much bigger islands than the large islands map . 
  very stupid , what kind of sadist would play on the so-called large islands map . 
  bought alcacer two seasons ago , and despite winning 2 trebles and the serie a golden boot , he has not gone past 80 . 
  i really love him on fifa , his finishing is great , but i want to tap into that potential . 
  does anyone know why this is happening/how to fix it ? 
  cheers,
