  exactly . 
  that last one is just obnoxious, 
  they 've already said they are covering the time period up to the end of the republic , so about 250 years . 
  realisticly , judging by the amount of turns in all the other games , this means about probably at max 2 turns a year, 
  `` a new world congress that votes on critical issues like implementing trade sanctions against rogue nations , limiting resource usage , designating host cities for the world games , and the use of nuclear weapons . '', 
  i came, 
  got ta be belgium . 
  my guesses would be hungary , portugal , zulu , and gran colombia lead by simon bolivar . 
  assyria and poland are confirmed , making it 8 . 
  so one more ? 
  probably a civ from around the caspian sea , we have n't got much there . 
  belgium would have a nice cultural side but would be alright at defending itself . 
  hungary would be religious and have a nice patronage ua . 
  portugal would be all about the navy and the exploration . 
  zulus have appeared in lots of civ games , so yeah, 
  gran colombia would be quite powerful at domination but good in cultural victories as well . 
  i 'm not buddhist but i still play shogun 2 as buddhist factons, 
  you 're good . 
  well done , you are officially retarded, 
  alright , calm down, 
  that really is an opinion . 
  imo empire ( now , not 3 years ago ) is the finest piece of fuck awesome ever, 
  lol darthmod turns them into lead-ball firing rape and death machines on napoleon, 
  i have honestly never experienced any lag when giving orders , but yeah siege battles are unplayable . 
  about 1000 hours, 
  what 's happening on the first photo ? 
  it does n't look like a battle to me , it 's way too close up . 
  strange . 
  crap , just read that he died shortly after ... shit that 's sad . 
  rip, 
  i think some died of laughter as they mercilessly slaughtered thousands of natives, 
  sorry , i was asleep , it is darthmod and i am playing as the us, 
  it 's not just about that , also ca want to sell more copies and having an 18 + age restriction limits their audience , in the same way skyrim was a 16 + . 
  it 'll be the same as shogun where there is a 50p `` dlc '' for blood . 
  i thought the trailer was an alternate history , as if you the player was napoleon invading all these countries . 
  that 's what total war is about . 
  we can see this on the last part where he has clearly landed in britain , something that never happened . 
  also , those ` better generals ' did n't plunge europe into 20 years of conflict . 
  they also would n't make for a good game . 
  i prefer a good game to a historically accurate one . 
  also there is a fucking sign saying `` london x miles this way '', 
  you did n't answer my point . 
  also the game is about the napoleonic wars , a pretty well known and large event in european history , and world history . 
  darthmod empire , playing grand campaign as us . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.twcenter.net/forums/forumdisplay.php?1126-darthmod-empire ), 
  must be a bug with darthmod, 
  it 's been done , good news for you !, 
  well clearly yes , if they have them . 
  no , not brazil , it 'd have to be gran colombia lead by simon bolivar . 
  i would really like to - gmt, 
  shortly after taking the last screenshot , my game crashed . 
  i lost the 40 minute battle . 
  so i will have to replay it soon . 
  i hardly ever bring vetted units , and my w/l is n't * that * bad, 
  it 's just in the main darthmod campaign ? 
  i felt a bit exploitative , knowing they would blindly charge into it ... 
  i just fought it again , and lost quite a few more men . 
  you 'll see in the next part , i 'll hopefully do one tomorrow . 
  that is strange . 
  do you have the newest one ? 
  [ part one ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/totalwar/comments/1ajpfs/sweden_ntw_campaign_part_1/ ), 
  [ part 3 ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/totalwar/comments/1aqx9e/swedish_ntw_campaign_part_3/ ), 
  please comment names for regiments !, 
  i 'd love the personal side of the game to be good . 
  the second part is up : [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/totalwar/comments/1alsho/swedish_ntw_campaign_part_2/ ), 
  it 's a lot better . 
  i am not the best player but on hard it really knows its stuff , pushes against weaker units and has good awareness . 
  it can sometimes make silly mistakes and is certainly no match for a person though . 
  sounds awesome !, 
  i do n't really know much about the history of scandinavia , apart from when it is entangled in ** british ** history ( the best history :d ), 
  first off , thanks !, 
  napoleon and empire are different to s2 because specific melee units are useless and do n't exist anyway ( unless you 're playing as the native americans or indians in empire ) . 
  the line units therefore are used if it comes down to melee , and some countries have better line at doing this . 
  ( my swedish line have better melee defense , for example . ), 
  also there are some special line units like grenadiers who are very good in melee . 
  cav is not very varied and not as useful and good as the shogun 2 cav . 
  the main difference between etw and ntw is the scope and scale of the grand campaign . 
  empire has a vast campaign map from india to n. america and has a lot of different factions . 
  empire is also , unfortunately , slightly more buggy and not as streamlined and well made ( ? ), 
  as napoleon . 
  it is still my favorite . 
  napoleon has a smaller map , just europe , but it is very polished and does feel grand and big . 
  it also comes with a lot of mini campaigns focusing on napoleon . 
  think of the combat in napoleon as an improvement to empire but the campaign as a scale down . 
  he does indeed . 
  for the record , i am english . 
  edit : in case anyone thought i was swedish - i 'm not . 
  i did n't mean to offend anyone or something ? 
  sure thing !, 
  maybe . 
  it 's good . 
  300 turns is fine by me , i lack the concentration to last any longer . 
  and who would you be in support of ? 
  yeah i plan to keep the other enemies of napoleon as my friends , especially prussia and britain . 
  rush to the bridges in the south , reinforce from the north . 
  bridge battles are easy victories . 
  not on my watch , 
  he has a public holiday in stockholm to remember his sacrifice, 
  soon ... 
  i knew you could rename units , but cities ?
