  if this is true i need to pull my jaw from the ground, 
  on empire and newer , press `` insert '' and thank me later . 
  no real tips for rome , i am only just beginning to play it . 
  filthy french , dirtying our fine ships, 
  you ca n't buy rome ii and not play as the romans first . 
  but the first * other * faction will definitely be the suebi . 
  i have heard a british soldier say something along the lines of `` is that a snake ?! '', 
  you do realize that history was also * before * the second world war , right ? 
  it looks like the cinematic at the beginning of the game, 
  empire is so fucking awesome . 
  so is rome . 
  so are medieval 2 , shogun 2 and napoleon . 
  [ part 2 ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/totalwar/comments/1alsho/swedish_ntw_campaign_part_2/ ), 
  next part , i promise to have dave 's jaegers . 
  holy crap , i did not realize that !, 
  thanks . 
  keeping the line pure . 
  no sir we ca n't . 
  oh god i thought i was on / r/circlejerk, 
  lol the twc is gon na go mental, 
  really sorry , i had edited all the titles and descriptions and forgot about cleaning out the images , so there 's about 40 images of nothing much . 
  [ part 3 ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/totalwar/comments/1aqx9e/swedish_ntw_campaign_part_3/ ), 
  maybe the other 8 did n't respond for the same reason ? 
  what game can i buy where the ai is smarter than me ? 
  pretty sure it 's iol , algeria . 
  edit : i mean the city in modern times is in algeria . 
  has anyone ever told you how much of a faggot you are, 
  so you really think canada and australia would be better choices than say , lithuania or belgium ? 
  haha , thanks , i was looking for a fucking moron . 
  i 'm pretty sure he was clear about it being a joke . 
  it was a joke, 
  1 : do n't play seleucids first, 
  because over at the total war centre they will use any excuse to complain and be utter pretentious little cocks . 
  i got so sick of it , i just stay here on / r/totalwar, 
  also , on screenshot 7 there is a city state , ur , that ( correct me if i 'm wrong ) is n't in the game already , and has lilac borders . 
  could anyone see if this replaces the colour of another city state ? 
  y' all need to get it into your head , the xcom unit was a joke . 
  and it focuses more on culture than anything . 
  do they purposefully pick the most annoying and least knowledgeable people on the subject to host ? 
  thanks !, 
  it 's [ darthmod napoleon ] ( http://www.twcenter.net/forums/forumdisplay.php?1824-darthmod-napoleon ), 
  they 're referencing the other , hardly unknown , game firaxis makes , xcom . 
  nope , he was a medic . 
  the sniper was wheeliebin, 
  this is my first playthrough and these are my only ranked up guys . 
  if i get a mission within 9 days i am screwed . 
  rise of the samurai is like $ 10, 
  here , if you do n't believe me : http://store.steampowered.com/app/34343/?snr=1_7_15__13, 
  fall of the samurai is the best # 30 i have ever spent . 
  i enjoyed it so much . 
  really fun , i would recommend it to everyone . 
  yeah i needed it to replace my major who died . 
  world war one would n't work . 
  copy pasting from the another thread :, 
  `` if you give any thought into how it would play , you would give up on the idea . 
  total war games are about idyllic battles and expansion , not sitting in a trench for literally 4 years in the same place in belgium and occasionally charge our troops at the enemy , literally to watch them be mowed down by gunfire while in the meantime spend the rest of the game watching artillery slowly whittle away at your troops . 
  i see this suggested all the time , and i challenge anyone to actually explain how the hell this ( or any war post-mid-1800s ) would work in terms of gameplay and actually enjoy-ability . '', 
  also , ww1 was fought mainly across two fronts , and there was no diplomacy , no capturing major territories . 
  it also was basically one big battle , no little skirmishes . 
  it would n't work and ca will never make it . 
  - . - you know what i mean lol, 
  the thing is , troops did n't deploy barricades . 
  they lived in them . 
  the battles were not grand events of tactics , the real battle was surviving . 
  it was a war of attrition . 
  there was no tactical maneuvering . 
  there was no grand strategy . 
  it was just a long line of trenches either side . 
  you 're completely forgetting about how the `` battles '' - if we can call them that - were fought , and how the campaign map would work . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.emersonkent.com/images/western_front.jpg ) is the western front . 
  the troops * lived * in the trenches . 
  they did n't sally out to attack another army . 
  it was one line of trenches . 
  i can not understand how this could ever be represented . 
  also , the damage was not done by the fights between infantry , it was done by artillery bombardments that lasted days . 
  it was n't like the germans brought forward the howitzers along with the rest of the army and started blowing up the weak spots while lnfantry advanced , it was constant , day to day bombardment . 
  there is no way a strategy game like total war could represent this war with any degree of accuracy . 
  not to mention the fact there were no real troop formations , and there were no longer large armies lead by generals . 
  any war post late 1800s would n't work . 
  at all . 
  leave combat like that to company of heroes . 
  i just know it will , too . 
  yep , they 're all named after my friends . 
  [ part 4 ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/totalwar/comments/1av3e2/swedish_ntw_campaign_part_4_warning_very_long/ ), 
  suggestions on my next strategy would be nice . 
  i 've been trying for a peace treaty with napoleon every few turns , but he hates me , whilst the prussians are still just `` unfriendly '' with me . 
  i guess they only declared war because of my endeavors in hannover . 
  but a peace with france would be great so i can concentrate on prussia for the time being , as long as russia stay friendly . 
  hard/hard . 
  it 's a french word, 
  it 's not like there 's 4 guys sitting making rome ii all day , it 's a large company . 
  anything before about 1000bc , and anything post late 1800s would not work . 
  there 's nothing better than letting off steam by slaughtering natives , as long as there are minimal casualties on my side :p, 
  bravery level : so, 
  the middle man looks like a partisan soldier , not an official trained soldier , so yes , militia . 
  the right man looks like a sailor to me , judging by his uniform - the hat is definitely a naval cap . 
  as the op has said , we can see that this is certainly a staged photograph . 
  i do n't know much about the subject though , so i 'm not much help . 
  empire because i love the time period and span of it . 
  for battles though it 's tough between rome and shogun 2 , rome as it is so awesome watching your little roman men slaughter barbarian scum and shogun 2 because samurai .
