  my favourite commentators are lionheartx10 and heirofcarthage , both are really entertaining and seem really nice . 
  guide for the ** other ** side :, 
  line up troops, 
  let ai run straight at you, 
  clean up native dead, 
  it is , from a custom battle i set up - france ( me ) , usa , cherokee and spain ** vs ** britain , britain , the dutch and prussia . 
  you can see it 's a custom battle by my units and the fact the ai has deployed it 's artillery outside of the box . 
  not really a cringe , i just am angry . 
  `` i just do n't like ... africans '', 
  i agree with you , but it was a joke . 
  although , the square that he is making is only a viable tactic on melee based total war games - on empire it is just pointless and stupid , especially since you press one little button and your infantry is now invulnerable to cavalry . 
  i was n't bashing the tactic , i was just intrigued as i had never seen this tactic employed by the ai . 
  i read `` reboots '' as robots . 
  that 's what i 'd like to see . 
  believe what you want , i do n't care , because i know i 'm right . 
  so you 're saying i set up a complex custom battle with an accomplice who set up a square , whilst fighting 4 armies , for 40 link karma ?

  [ part 5 ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/totalwar/comments/1b29kq/swedish_ntw_campaign_part_5/ ), 
  sorry about the delay , i am in the middle of exams and stuff . 
  really good !, 
  please continue . 
  i 've never seen venice trade the province in greece with the iroquois before , weird . 
  copenhagen seems pretty happy under swedish rule , it ai n't gon na be happening soon . 
  we are now under one rule , a nordic empire !, 
  what do you like best ? 
  that 's the thing . 
  i love the empire era of line infantry and chivalrous and honorable fighting , and that 's why empire is my favorite . 
  `` god damnit , blucher '' is becoming the catchphrase of this campaign . 
  thanks !, 
  well i have napoleon covered , you have got an empire play through . 
  nice . 
  i do n't know , i started allied to them though . 
  i hope they stay friendly , i do n't want any more enemies . 
  have a feeling he 's playing darthmod etw, 
  sweden, 
  what bug are you talking about ? 
  oh yes , i got that in one of my games . 
  i do n't know what to do , i just played around it . 
  that 's a portrait of mozart , i believe . 
  but who can refuse the uniform colours of the swedish line infantry ? 
  germany , or another germanic country that is n't britain , because i like the uniformity and awesome line infantry of prussia on empire , but i do n't like playing as britain or england ever because i think that they 're a bit too clich\u00e9 . 
  the original rome had 9 factions , empire has about 10 and napoleon had 4 . 
  what makes you think they 'll put more in ? 
  wow you are milking your screenshot folder , are n't you . 
  i would n't count the three roman families as separate factions . 
  i think the ca are going to move heavily focus on 8 or 9 fleshed out factions rather than lots of them . 
  vehicular . 
  empire because empire, 
  [ part 6 ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/totalwar/comments/1boeq4/swedish_ntw_campaign_part_6/ ) !, 
  i think of the empire more of a joining of the danish and swedish empires , and i have centred most of my production in copenhagen . 
  plus it 's position in the world is more ideal for my military endeavors into europe . 
  ( p.s i know that the capital of sweden is stockholm ), 
  heh , i 'll see what i can do . 
  what i 've noticed from all these screenshots is that the arrows seem to be more like actual physical objects , if you know what i mean . 
  they just seem * heavier * and like they would carry some force , unlike arrows of yore . 
  i like that . 
  tell me about it . 
  the scope and magnificence of the game is awesome , but it 's so difficult and confusing , on the easiest difficulty i just ca n't figure out how to get my economy in form , and i have no idea how trade works . 
  i 'm sure if you persevere it gets easier though . 
  i see you get your kicks by posting this round reddit . 
  i 'm just going to say here that the artillery on empire is always useless , not just for the indians . 
  do , it 's such an improvement . 
  i love vanilla still but darthmod really refines it and makes it better . 
  `` yes , i 've landed a shot all the way through the enemy column !, 
  look at all those dead bodies ! ... 
  oh wait they all stood up '', 
  no mods , and i did n't do any editing . 
  autoresolve is just bad . 
  well there 's your problem : i 've played 450 hours . 
  it was confirmed to be the same price as gods and kings , so # 19.99 or ~ $ 30, 
  i 'm not so sure , i got one of these before except it was the opposite way round - i had no way of winning in a real battle - and the autoresolve predicted a win but i lost as you 'd expect . 
  i do n't think they 're able to steal your techs , as it is n't a university anymore . 
  i 'd assassinate or duel them still , just in case . 
  i 'm sure there is n't a diplomacy hit if you duel , but i 'd need to check . 
  why did you film yourself then ? 
  trying to get my head round europa universalis 3 , and mastering civ 5 . 
  etw has a huge campaign map , from america to india , and spans from 1700-1800 , so the combat changes during the timespan . 
  ntw has a more focused campaign map of just europe and is from 1805-1812 . 
  the combat in napoleon is the same as etw for european factions except improved . 
  the difference is the native indian/american factions . 
  garrison the city with lots of dragoons , build happiness buildings . 
  no such mechanic in empire , it 's as easy as :, 
  take over city, 
  recruit loads of light dragoons as garrisons/stay in city for as many is needed ( every turn the unhappiness decreases ) for it to be happy, 
  move on to next target . 
  they do ? 
  when are they not doing it ? 
  i am playing a swedish play through and all my line infantry * do . 
  is n't there a technology in vanilla that unlocks it ? 
  no , there is a technology in vanilla . 
  i just took time out of playing civ with my friends to open this and find it . 
  read underneath . 
  `` enables fire by rank firing drill '', 
  edit : no reply but downvotes ? 
  to get a new government type , which holds different bonuses . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.twcenter.net/forums/showthread.php?280656-guide-to-governments-and-revolutions ) is a nice guide to it . 
  also , cool flags . 
  can i ask where you lived ? 
  are you talking about [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ettjicogvq&amp;list=uurogots1b_ga_ntt9kg4hwq ) that plays at the end of every battle on fall of the samurai ( for me at least ), 
  there are lots of herbal teas and spiced teas they drink down there .
