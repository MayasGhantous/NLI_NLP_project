  i do n't care about you , your stroppy attitude , or your massive rant about xml . 
  i 'll leave you to talk to * all the other people * that want to debate it with you . 
  have fun . 
  * braces for downvotes *, 
  no no no no no !, 
  the person you are responding to is somewhat abnormal . 
  i applaud his intent , and wish him luck if he 's willing to try , but masturbation is a normal thing for guys to do . 
  it keep the otherwise rather overpowering sexual urges in check and allows us to think about stuff-that-isn ` t-breasts every so often . 
  now , he may have the balance a bit wrong ( eg , if he 's masturbating in preference to fucking you ) , if that 's the case then you should certainly help him sort it out . 
  but you should n't be pressuring him to give up porn altogether . 
  i tried it for a few weeks . 
  concentrating is hard , walking around with a semi on a hair trigger is . . kinda impractical . 
  only plus side is if you keep it up for long enough , you 'll have some excellent dreams , 
  that 's kinda cool . 
  good work , google . 
  i wonder what other sneaky little things there are . . 
  many , many schools in the uk are affiliated in some way with churches , particularly primary schools ( at least , they were when i was that age ) . 
  so , like many people , i have been to church many times without actually praying . 
  i even went to `` sunday school '' ( like , er , a lame bible study thing for kids . . do you have that wherever you are ? ), 
  until i was old enough to realise it was all bollocks ( i think up until i was 7-8 , maybe a bit older ) . 
  more likely they simply consider themselves `` christians '' because their school and/or parents expect it . 
  there 's very little of the rabid fundamentalism here that i often hear about from the us . 
  we have an excellent invention here - the church of england . 
  it 's about as passive as religion can possibly be . 
  ( [ eddie izzard 's opinion on it ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtrjwdw3jsg#t=2m20s ) is n't * that * far from the truth  ), 
  when i was younger , which was many , many years ago ( i 'm kinda old ) , i knew a bloke who was well into punk , hardcore and a bit of industrial . 
  he was n't quite straight edge , but he took himself rather seriously and * hated * anything that would be considered mainstream . 
  he got a tattoo on his arm that said `` tattoo '' . 
  not massively amusing , but at least it was n't a barcode , right ? 
  well , recently i saw an episode of `` never mind the buzzcocks '' ( uk celebrity music music quiz/comedy/panel show thing . 
  very amusing , and worth a watch , if music and/or comedy is your thing ) . 
  there was a chap on from mcfly ( horrible manufactured , sugary pop punk boyband - everything not-quite-straight-edge-bloke hated , basically ) , who had [ this ] ( http://i13.tinypic.com/4mj819u.jpg ) tattoo on his wrist . 
  oh how i laughed . 
  you probably had to be there . . 
  * gets coat *, 
  yeah they were popular for a while with the straight edge anarcho-punk chaps ( although often confused for the [ black flag logo ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/black_flag_logo.jpg ) ) . 
  no particular meaning apart from being a kinda ironic `` number of the beast '' kinda thing . 
  be warned , they 're [ not particularly original ] ( http://images.google.co.uk/images?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;um=1&amp;sa=1&amp;q=barcode+tattoo&amp;btng=search+images&amp;aq=f&amp;oq= ) these days , and considered a bit lame . 
  pop3 does n't provide any means to send email back to the server . 
  it 's purely for accessing mail in a mailbox . 
  however , someone could be using google 's smtp server to send spam using your account ( that would likely be apparent if you looked at the headers ) . 
  or they could simply have another session open to your account . 
  there is some means to nuke other sessions , i believe , but i could n't tell you where to find it . 
  that 's fine dude , i was simply correcting inaccuracies and clarifying the possibilities . 
  using the smtp interface is more likely , certainly , but someone logging in through the web interface is possible - they 'll need the same password for either . 
  ( in fact it 's * possible * someone hijacked the session , but it seems unlikely since you 've logged out and stuff . 
  if it keeps happening , use ssl ) . 
  no `` bots '' necessary ( javascript or otherwise ) , although that * is * possible . 
  as i mentioned , if the emails were being sent using the smtp interface , then the headers of the emails in the sent box will contain not only evidence that has happened , but very likely the originator 's ip address as well . 
  check [ here ] ( http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=45938 ) for a means to nuke other sessions and view activity on the account , in case that 's the problem . 
  you can send messages back to your * mailbox * with imap ( though not pop ) , but you ca n't send a message to the mailserver for delivery with it . 
  that 's what smtp is for , 
  the damn stackoverflow anal jobsworth brigade got to it and closed it , 
  your obvious irritation at being corrected , and being forced to defend your comment 's inaccuracies to maintain your geek honour ... is simply delicious . 
   there is no widely-recognized consensus in the industry about what subset of html is appropriate for use in e-mail for interoperability . 
  who says it has to be a subset ? 
  obviously you do n't want to allow javascript , or html extensions like flash , but everything else is pretty damn obvious . 
  besides , it 's a stupid argument as * they have to convert to html anyway * , so they 've clearly already decided on a subset they deem appropriate . 
  heh , and as if they 'd follow it if someone actually took the time to define a specific subset , 
  the big problem for people designing emails is n't the fact that there 's only a subset of html available - its that the msword renderer is a law unto itself when it comes to rendering . 
  it 's one thing to have to keep your email content simple and not use certain features , but it 's another thing * entirely * to have to deal with a * completely * crazy html renderer that seems to follow no sane rules . 
  so , this post is just a bullshit attempt at appeasement . 
  well , thank you very little .

  when i was commuting regularly it was a proper eye-opener to see people trying to scrounge money with the same damn lines every day . 
  i 've been sucked in more than once by someone who seemed legit , but i saw a coupla days later trying the same thing . 
  so now i refuse to give any money at all . 
  instead , if i have time and they seem legitimate , i 'll buy food , bus/train tickets or whatever else they 're claiming to get the money together for . 
  sometimes they 'll get angry when i offer ( i 'm assuming these are the smackheads/alchies ) , sometimes they 'll realise they 've been rumbled and just say no and leave . 
  but occasionally there are some that are really grateful . 
  i once bought a sandwich for a girl who was hanging around outside the train station ( at the time i did n't really care whether she was trying to scam me or not , she looked so damn depressed ) . 
  she thanked me , started eating it , but it did n't seem to cheer her up very much .
