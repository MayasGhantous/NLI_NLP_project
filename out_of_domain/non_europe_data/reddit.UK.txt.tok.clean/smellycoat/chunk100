  a jbod gives you the same 2tb as raid0 over four drives , a little bit slower ( but not so much that you 'll notice it much ) . 
  the advantage being that you will at least have a chance of recovering some of the data if one drive dies . 
  tl ; dr : raid10 or jbod , depending on whether you want 1tb or 2tb . 
  okay . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://i.imgur.com/iz0pw.jpg ) the front of a macbook pro . 
  see the black thing on the right ? 
  the ` sleep ' light is next to that , it disappears when it 's off . 
  there 's an explanation about it on apple 's website [ here ] ( http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/design.html ) . 
  `` look to the right of the thumbscoop . 
  you see nothing . 
  until you close the display and your macbook pro goes to sleep . '', 
  now this * is * really cool , but it 's just not that usable . 
  because it disappears and the `` breathing '' indicator , you have to stare at that spot for up to three seconds to convince yourself it 's actually off and not asleep . 
  there 's a video somewhere of jony ive banging on about how indicators that are n't indicating things do n't need to be there , so they went to great expense to make it disappear when it 's not in use . 
  again , really cool bit of engineering , but why the fuck is it next to a mystery black blob which apparently does nothing ?!, 
  i have no idea what that is ( is it an indicator ? ), 
  and why it 's important for the sleep light to disappear but not the mystery black thing . 
  so i do n't think it 's `` obsessive attention to detail '' as much as a desire to do cool shit . 
  aha that makes sense . 
  but still , why make a disappearing indicator if it 's right next to something visible-but-useless ? 
  ( useless in the sense there 's no point in me being able to see it ) . 
   writing sql more complicated than `` delete * from table1 '' would probably have me googling tutorials and keyword definitions . 
  clearly !, 
  here , let me ftfy : ` delete from table1 ` , 
  now try pressing it against your thigh or arm , anywhere where you have decent-sized blood vessels close to the surface . 
  move it around until you find one . 
  weird . 
  i 'm with you man . 
  if a cackhanded thief ruined my bike trying to steal it , not only would i have to walk home , but i 'd have a now-useless bike to carry too . 
  if it 's an actual app ( and you 're not using perl to control apache directly ) , then pick something else . 
  they 're not really * fake * , they 're still intel processors , just oem versions ( exactly the same , but cheaper , and designed for sale to system builders , hence the lack of official packaging ) . 
  so really the biggest concern is being ripped off by paying retail prices for one . . 
  it 's interpolating frames to create new interim frames , though . 
  so while it 's not `` upconversion '' , it 's still fucking with shit it should n't really be fucking with . 
  it 's the frame-rate equivalent of `` digital zoom '' . 
  the reason it looks odd is for two , largely unrelated reasons : higher framerates are usually associated with cheap video ( rather than well-produced film ) , and the new frames it generates are n't ever going to be exactly right . 
  film is 24fps , which all tvs can display already . 
  where do you think those frames come from ? 
  if we had more ( any ? ), 
  120hz content , then i 'd maybe be more interested . 
  until then i 'll survive without interpolated extra frames . 
  the term `` upconversion '' usually refers specifically to increasing the resolution of each frame to display it on a device with a resolution greater than the source material . 
  that is : it makes the picture bigger , but does n't add any detail . 
  the variously-named 120hz image processor things increase * framerate * by creating entirely new interim frames and slotting them in-between the existing ones . 
  [ `` a video scaler is a device for converting video signals from one size or resolution to another : usually `` upscaling '' or `` upconverting '' a video signal from a low resolution ( e.g. 
  standard definition ) to one of higher resolution ( e.g. 
  high definition television ) . 
  '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/upconversion ), 
  tricky .

  the means by which a photocopier gets ink onto paper is basically the same as a laser printer . 
  they 're both relatively complicated ( and expensive ) bits of kit , but are reasonably cheap to run once the hardware has been purchased , as the toner they both use is essentially just carbon ( with some extra stuff ) , so relatively cheap . 
  black and white laser printers and photocopiers have comparable running costs . 
  inkjet printers are a different story , the hardware tends to be sold cheaply ( maybe even as a loss leader ) , while the proprietary ink cartridges are marked up considerably . 
  of course , it 's possible to find photocopiers and laser printers trying to use the inkjet model , with cheap hardware and expensive refills , but as the average consumer is less interested in black and white printing or photocopying , they 're pretty rare these days .

  excellent . 
  so , some dude made a video bitching about your girlfriend . 
  is it damaging past being slightly embarrassing ? 
  does the video have any significant exposure ( ie , a large number of views ) ? 
  your description does n't suggest either of those things . 
  if not , then it does n't sound like it 's a problem , unless you make it a problem . 
  do n't give the dude the satisfaction of reacting . 
  let it disappear into obscurity along with all the other shit on youtube . 
  otherwise you risk [ unintended consequences ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/streisand_effect ) . 
  i think any implementation of herobrine should be in keeping with the original intent of the story . 
  a mysterious , shadowy figure , always watching from the periphery , but only very occasionally visible . 
  unknowable . 
  i think his appearance should instil both interest and fear in the player . 
  to that end , i think attempts to approach him should cause him to run away and despawn . 
  if you manage to get close enough to get a good look , or even to catch him or try to kill him , you should be punished severely - like a creeper , but more devastating . 
  a large explosion , for instance . 
  killing you , destroying your items , and leaving a large , burning crater in the world . 
  but i do n't think he should be an entirely malicious entity . 
  just timid . 
  afraid . 
  i think he should leave things in the world . 
  evidence of his existence . 
  maybe the occasional torch , a modest dirt hovel , a small mine . 
  if you tolerate his existence without provoking him , attacking him , stealing his stuff , interfering with his mines , etc , then maybe , if you 're really lucky . . 
  he 'll allow you to approach . 
  but not too close . 
  he might even leave you a chest with some goodies in it . 
  i think something like that would create the right balance between mysterious , dangerous and benevolent . 
  an event you both anticipate and dread . 
  subtle and rare , but can not be ignored when it happens . 
  tl ; dr : like the g-man in hl2 , with explosions . 
  and maybe , if you 're very very lucky , gifts . 
  you stated elsewhere that the legit email you got came from createsend.com . 
  that belongs to [ campaignmonitor ] ( http://campaignmonitor.com ) , an email marketing platform . 
  so , assuming your email address is n't easily-guessable , and you only ever used it for ebay 's mailing list - here are the possible ways in which your email address found its way into the hands of spammers ( in increasing order of likelihood ) :, 
  * campaignmonitor got hacked or managed to leak all or part of their email database/logs . 
  * ebay had a security breach and lost their subscriber database somehow ( could be anything from someone breaking into their database to some marketing weenie losing a memory stick with the list on it ) . 
  * someone who had an email from you in their inbox for whatever reason got themselves a virus . 
  the last thing there is far more likely . 
  companies will often arrange for stuff ( like new subscribers to relatively obscure mailing lists ) to be announced via automated emails to various people . 
  and there are tons of viruses that 'll dig through your email inbox collecting addresses . 
  though it 's possible it 's something more serious , and as fun as the ensuing drama would be , chances are high it was something relatively mundane .
