  take this empty glass . 
  here it is , peaceful , serene and boring . 
  but if it is ... 
  destroyed !, 
  look at all these little things !, 
  so busy now !, 
  notice how each one is useful . 
  what a lovely ballet ensues , so full of form and color . 
  now , think about all those people that created them . 
  technicians , engineers , hundreds of people who 'll be able to feed their children tonight so those children can grow up big and strong and have little teeny weeny children of their own , and so on and so forth . 
  thus , adding to the great chain ... of life . 
  you see , father , by creating a little destruction , i 'm actually encouraging life . 
  in reality , you and i are in the same business . 
  cheers . 
  you 're right , of course . 
  but you ca n't give them that window . 
  he was massively disappointing in it . 
  none of the nuance of stringer bell , just a crybaby policeman ( on the * edge * of the * laaaw !, 
  * ) who shouted a lot . 
  was n't his fault , of course . 
  i blame the shitty writing . 
  ctrl + f spaced, 
  no hits . 
  you should all be ashamed of yourselves . 
  ashamed !, 
  go watch [ spaced ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spaced ) . 
  ninja edit : dammit the title specified bbc shows . 
  although i suspect he meant `` british '' rather than specifically the bbc . 
  i 'll let you off on a technicality . 
  * this time * . 
  i enjoyed it , although i found ewan mcgregor 's character to be a little . . creepy . 
  i 'd recommend it still , though . 
  plummeting dram prices means adobe will feel justified in making their pdf reader even more bloated in 2011 . 
  have a look at [ this page on the mit website ] ( http://housing.mit.edu/off_campus/housing_code_checklist ) ( i assume it 'll still apply to you , same area right ? 
  i live in the uk so i may be way off , but i do know university websites are generally a good resource for information about rental accomodation ) . 
  notably , it says heating must be :, 
   adequate to keep every room at 68 \u00b0 f/20 \u00b0 c during the day and at 64 \u00b0 f/17 \u00b0 c at night between september 15 and june 15, 
  they also have what looks like some great information about [ tenant 's rights ] ( http://housing.mit.edu/off_campus/discrimination_tenant%e2%80%99s_rights ) . 
  this might be a massively condescending post , but i know central heating systems can be a bit confusing , so it 's worth a go . 
  do your radiator valves look [ like this ] ( http://news.plumbingpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/honeywell_vt120.jpg ) ? 
  if so , that 's a standard water based central heating system . 
  hot water ( not gas ! ), 
  flows into the radiators from the boiler , the rate is controlled by the valve which has a simple thermometer on it . 
  turning it to higher numbers makes more water flow in ; gets hotter . 
  feel the radiators to see if they 're warm at all . 
  if the boiler/furnace is working then you should at least be able to feel the pipes running into it are warm ( careful , they could be very hot ) . 
  if the bottom of the radiator is warm , but the top is n't , then they might need [ bleeding ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bleed_screw ) to remove any trapped air preventing the radiator from filling . 
  you can do this yourself ( make sure the heating is off and cold first , and use a towel or something - the water in those things is nasty ) . 
  if the pipes are cold , then there 's a couple of possibilities . 
  boiler/furnaces often have timers to switch them on and off at particular times of day , and often have controls that disable the heating entirely ( so they serve only hot water for taps ) . 
  there 'll also be a thermostat to control the temperature , if it 's too low , it wo n't come on very often . 
  if the system is getting hot ( even a bit ) , then chances are you just need to bleed the radiators or fiddle with the settings a bit . 
  make sure the timer ( if it 's there ) is set to something sensible , the radiators are switched on ( if the boiler has a control for that ) , the valves on the radiators are turned up high , and that the radiators get completely warm ( rather than just at the bottom ) if they get warm at all ( bleed them if necessary ) . 
  also it 's worth plugging up any obvious draughts . 
  even relatively small draughts can make the temperatures plummet . 
  do n't worry about the style of radiator , they 're all pretty much the same thing , even [ this style ] ( http://user-agent.org/stuff/images/cast_iron_radiator_06.jpg ) . 
  they 're just metal containers with hot water flowing through them . 
  the old style ones are actually pretty good ( as they hold a lot of water ) , but do tend to be thicker metal , so take a while to warm up . 
  as long as they 're not leaking , they 'll be fine . 
  cold at the top , hot at the bottom is a classical indication they need to be bled . 
  that is , air has collected inside them , so they can no longer fill properly with hot water , and become far less efficient . 
  i bet if you bleed all your radiators , all your heating problems will go away . 
  there should be a small valve at the top on one side ( it * has * to be at the top ) . 
  some can be turned with a screwdriver , but yours will probably need a special tool to operate . 
  you should be able to find one very cheaply ( a coupla dollars ) at a hardware store . 
  taking a photo of the valve with you is probably a good idea , they 're not all the same . 
  you might even find a tool to do it in the back of a drawer in the house somewhere . 
  all you need to do is turn the valve slowly until air starts coming out ( do n't remove the valve completely !, 
  just until it starts hissing ) , then wait until you see water coming out , and tighten it all back up again . 
  you do need to turn the heating off and let everything cool down first , though . 
  and hold a towel against the valve while it 's bleeding - the water inside is likely to be horrible , brown and rusty . 
  if the valve looks damaged , or you ca n't find the right tool , do n't touch it . 
  it 's not worth breaking the valve and having the heating system water all over your floor . 
  [ here 's a video ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tginkwkrqsw ) ( although the guy has a really strong north england accent - i hope you can understand him ! ), 
  although your landlord should have probably done this for you , if only out of politeness , it 's really not a hard , expensive or time-consuming job to do yourself . 
  certainly less hassle than fighting your landlord . 
  ah , shit , the * top * is getting warm ? 
  then ignore my post on bleeding the radiators . 
  that 's a flow rate problem - there 's not enough hot water making its way into the radiators . 
  are the pipes underneath warm ? 
  what about the pipes nearer to the boiler/furnace ? 
  that could be as simple as turning the valves at the bottom of the radiators to a higher setting , or turning up your thermostat . 
  but it could also be indicative of a bigger problem with the heating system . 
  what 's the boiler/furnace like ? 
  can you access it ? 
  is it very old ? 
  very new ? 
  go ahead man . 
  though this is your post , so i doubt it 'll piss anyone off to do it here , 
  when it 's cold and wet , i have a jacket that i believe is for snowboarders . 
  it 's longer than a normal jacket ( keeps my arse dry ) , warm and waterproof ( but breathes a bit ; it has some vents under the arms i can open ) and an excellent hood with a peak that helps keep the rain out of my eyes . 
  i usually wear it with just a t-shirt underneath , as it 's generally warm enough on its own , and means i can regular heat by opening vents or the front zip . 
  not what you 'd want for a proper ride , admittedly , but excellent for commuting . 
  if it 's not cold , i find it easier to just embrace the rain . 
  throw on shorts and a t-shirt ( anything that 'll dry quickly ) , and take a change of clothes with me . 
  whatever you do , if it 's raining ( or likely to be ) , a spare pair of socks is easily-stowed away , but can be a godsend . 
  jesus , way to make a simple concept confusing . 
  generally speaking , all you need to know is this :,
