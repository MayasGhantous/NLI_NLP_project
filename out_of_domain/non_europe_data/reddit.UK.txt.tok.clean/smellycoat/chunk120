  i do put in some effort to stay above 20mph where possible , though . 
  the speed limit around these parts is 20mph , and i 'd love * nothing * more than to get a speeding ticket while on my bike . 
  happen . 
  you * happen * to deflect arrows . 
  i 'm pretty sure the done thing around these parts is to hoon past at an entirely arbitrarily selected moment ( bonus points for doing it on a corner ) , and then immediately reduce speed to below that of the person you just overtook . 
  oh and , whatever you do , do n't let them overtake back . 
  to my mind , it 's the sexiest of the palsys . 
  you ca n't jump when you 're sprinting ... maybe that will help . 
  the question is , why ?

  looks like someone is getting paid per resolved ticket . . 
  he is wearing safety protection . 
  he 's got a layer of heat-resistant foam protecting his hand . 
  i did n't get the impression the original complainant actually knew gabe , just ccd him ( and some other gaming-related news sites ) when he realised shit was about to get real ... 
  people who get to the point of suicide have way , way deeper issues than how it 'll affect others .

  all photos were taken in the past . 
  i think you 'll find the cunt never left scunthorpe , 
  with my current setup ( sabnzbd , couchpotato , sickbeard , 50mbit internet ) it 's considerably quicker and less effort to download a fresh copy than it is to rip anything . 
  i 'd be willing to bet a lot of the tiffs you 've received were once jpegs ... 
  jpegs are lossily compressed , that is , some information is thrown away to make the file smaller . 
  the compression algorithm is specifically designed for photos , and works really quite well with them , but tends to make a horrible mess of anything else . 
  so jpeg is fine for photos ( like , actual proper photographs of real things ) . 
  for pretty much everything else you 'll want png .

  this is a beautiful bit of design . 
  but , if all the components necessary to assemble the phone are in the book ... why not ship them pre-assembled ? 
  she 's putting in a special effort to `` talk proper '' , though . 
  every so often she drops a glottal stop instead of properly pronouncing a `` t '' , for example . 
  that does n't sound very plausible to me . 
  encrypting the key with the 4-digit pin would be so easy to brute force it would n't even be worth the effort . 
  that 's not the misfits .

  you made me cry , you fuckers , 
   hands down the best terminal app for any platform . 
  i too love securecrt , it 's my terminal emulator of choice on windows machines . 
  i got ta say that iterm2 on os x trumps it , though . 
  rectifiers are pretty cheap , so i ca n't imagine there are that many instances of people hooking up leds to ac currents without them . 
  more likely , the flickering you see is down to the use of a [ pulse-width modulation ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pulse-width_modulation ) circuit . 
  these are often used to `` dim '' leds , by essentially switching them on and off rapidly . 
  as i understand it , minor manufacturing differences can cause dramatic differences in performance at low voltages , so pwm is favoured over simply reducing the voltage as it leads to far more predictable results - particularly important when driving more than one led . 
  while true , this does n't factor into balance very much . 
  otherwise bikes with small wheels would be much harder to ride than bikes with larger wheels , and [ these things ] ( http://www.microscooter.org.uk/micro-scooter/micro_scooter_bullet_1.jpg ) would be damn near impossible to ride . 
  the gyroscopic effect is what makes it ( kinda ) possible to ride a bike without holding the handlebars , though . 
  while i kinda get what you mean with the correlation between cheap crap and flickery leds , i ca n't think of common a device ( cheap or otherwise ) that would require an led but not a dc current to run a microcontroller or something . 
  tesco [ use ] ( http://www.brandrepublic.com/news/739706/tesco-signs-deal-epsilon-email-services/ ) a company called [ epsilon ] ( http://www.epsilon.com/ ) as their email marketing service provider . 
  last year , epsilon suffered a [ massive security breach ] ( http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/2040043/banks-hit-biggest-email-address-heist-history ) , in which a large amount of personal data was stolen . 
  so , there 's that . 
  this is excellent advice , if you follow it correctly any urges you may have to not become a bofh will soon disappear !, 
  that 's fucking disturbing . 
  i do n't tan , i just oscillate between pasty white and sunburnt-to-fuck . 
  i 'll still chase every last second of sun , though !,

  fuck yes !, 
  i 've spent all day literally shuffling a lawn chair around my boss 's garden to leech the last precious rays of sun .

  how bizarre . 
  i 'm pretty sure that top photo was taken on donnington bridge in oxford , which is part of my morning commute .

  leave justin alone !, 
  honestly , i came here to say deus ex . 
  i 'd heard great things , desperately wanted to love it , but just could n't get into it . 
  we give iphones to our sales guys , who naturally abuse the shit out of them . 
  upshot is we 've collected a number of iphones with smashed screens or backs , which i took upon myself to try to repair . 
  as you say the backs are very cheap and simple to replace . 
  you can pick up a digitiser and screen from ebay for not too much ( # 30 here , so probably $ 50 ) , and they typically come with all the tools you need to get the job done . 
  although it 's rather fiddly as you have to strip the phone right down to get at the screen , and as you say a number of screws to keep track of , it 's actually a relatively straightforward process . 
  there are very easy to follow guides on ifixit.com . 
  i 've replaced several broken iphone4 screens so far , with no problems . 
  the only one i could n't save had been taken into a shower . . 
  yes . 
  originally we were using 3gs , which do n't seem quite as delicate . 
  by the time we 'd moved onto 4s , apple had started giving away freebie cases . 
  after they stopped doing that we had a number of ... casualties before realising why , and started issuing cases . 
  has n't solved the problem entirely , but definitely makes a big difference . 
  yeah , cos nobody ever [ fucked up ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/http_referer ) in an rfc , 
  ` unicode_eval ' and ` evalbytes ' ? 
  exactly this . 
  last week i checked in some code to honour the dnt header in one of our products . 
  this week i will be removing it , entirely because of this decision .

  that 's a spicy metaball-a !,

  which seems , y' know , better ... 
  two reason removing voting from the api is n't the magic fix you think it is :, 
  * it would break alternative clients ( like alienblue , the immensely popular iphone client ) . 
  * if voting via the api was banned , it 's not * that * much harder to fake a vote by pretending to be a real user in a real browser . 
  precisely the kind of thing bot authors are totally happy doing . 
  jay , you are awesome . 
  did the jason mewes porno that kevin talks about in one of his `` evening with `` s make it out into the world ? 
  it 's not that i 'd like to see you on the job but ... well no , i 'd kinda like to see you on the job .
