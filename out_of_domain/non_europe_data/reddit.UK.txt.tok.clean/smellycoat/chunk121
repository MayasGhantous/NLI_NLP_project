  the fuck is this ? 
  i do this sometimes when i 'm watching a movie in bed . 
  at work i 've got a 27 '' imac , and a 20 '' ( 1600x1200 monitor ) set at 90 degrees sits neatly alongside it . 
  point is that the 20 '' on its side fits nicely against the imac . 
  my goal is n't to show off ( that 's just a happy side-effect  ), 
  i must own that, 
  once you get past the silly screws ( and there 's only two , the rest are normal philips ) , iphones are actually quite easy to dismantle . 
  i 've replaced a number of screens and fixed a few other bits and pieces in various models . 
  btw , if your friend 's speaker works but is very quiet , it might just be gummed up , it 's happened frequently with the iphones we give out sales guys . 
  you can often solve it by sticking your mouth over it and sucking hard , as bizarre as that sounds !, 
  that 's such a shame . 
  some of my fondest memories were struggling with a friend to get into a new area we probably were n't really ready for . 
  lost count of how many times we died ( and how lost we got ) trying to get to ironforge for the first time . 
  that legislation came long after unsolicited bulk email was known as spam . 
  well , i remember the legislation , and remember balking at its painful backronym name . 
  the term ` spam ' was originally coined in the 90s referring to advertising posted to usenet , which had almost entirely died out ( for online discussion , at least ) by 2003 . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://www.catb.org/jargon/oldversions/jarg310.txt ) an old copy of the [ jargon file ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jargon_file ) from 1994 that has an entry for ` spam ' , if you want something a bit more concrete . 
  it 's kinda [ bodoni italic ] ( http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/paratype/bodoni/italic/ ) . . but not quite . 
  not sure it 'd help , [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/oales.jpg ) happened to my marathon plus tyre . 
  absolutely destroyed my mudguard :(, 
  ... little boxes made of ticky-tacky, 
  seriously i 'd massively appreciate a howto on this . . looks awesome !, 
  because any complete bike sold in the uk must have :, 
  * a bell, 
  * reflectors on both sides of each wheel, 
  * white front reflector or light, 
  * red rear reflector or light, 
  * reflectors on the front and rear of each pedal, 
  . . so the majority of road , mountain and other specialist bikes are sold `` incomplete '' . 
  the easiest way to do this is to exclude pedals , as a large number of serious riders will have their own pedal preferences anyway . 
  she 's a beaut . 
  i love the colour !, 
  so , it 's a. . . sign you saw on a paint store door ? 
  well thanks for that . 
  now amazon is going to forever suggest bizarre medieval-looking bondage devices . 
  i missed everything past about 2:30 because i was laughing far too hard at `` gammon socket '' . 
  edit : [ here 's a decent sample ] ( http://i.imgur.com/1nolf.gif ) . 
  [ proteina ] ( http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mendoza-vergara/proteina/ ) , i reckon . 
  i 'm a bit pants at serifs , i 'm afraid ( and that 's pretty low res ) . 
  it looks like a hand-drawn baskerville-ish serif . 
  my first thought would be something like [ mrs eaves ] ( http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/emigre/mrs-eaves/ ) ( which is n't right , but has the right sorta feel ) . 
  a bit of digging around turns up [ this ] ( http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/glc/1676-morden-map/ ) , which ( although again not quite right ) is getting there . 
  edit : [ closer ] ( http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bagraphics/caslon-manuscript/ ) . 
  i 'm giving up now , 
  while i never would ( or could ) ride like that , this is just about the most exhilarating thing i 've ever seen . 
  well , that 's fucking bollocks . 
  ` mv * / * . ` will work too . 
  admittedly deleting the dirs is n't quite so easy . . 
  good point , well made , 
  that 's awesome . 
  actually much more interesting than the negotiation that they did show . 
  that was awesome , 
  i love seeing cars with snowhawks ... 
  writing goes from left to right . 
  awesome project , but that video is hilariously bad !, 
  i particularly like the camera guy 's heavy breathing . 
  astraweb can max my 50mb without any trouble pretty consistently ( even with ssl ) . 
  i 've also used them on a 100mb connection and that was nearly maxed but a ) i do n't what other traffic was happening at the time and b ) i only used it a little and have no idea if they 'll be able to push that consistently, 
  dude !, 
  looking hot !, 
  good work , you look awesome !,

  trolley goblins . 
  higher gears help prevent you from skidding when accelerating . 
  it can be difficult to moderate power to prevent your wheels slipping ( as there 's little feedback ) , particularly when pulling away . 
  a higher gear makes that a lot less likely to happen . 
  it also forces you to drive very smoothly , carefully and deliberately - all good things in icy conditions !, 
  changing down to decelerate ( rather than stamping on the brakes ) is a legitimate tactic too , though . 
  tom cruise, 
  looks like [ balladeer ] ( http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/profonts/balladeer/ ) . 
  probably medium weight . 
  i have a sneaky suspicion the designer manually placed the dot on the `` i '' . 
  it does n't look like it 's in quite the right place . 
  it only feels good and relieves stress because the withdrawal makes you feel bad and stressed . 
  non-smokers do not get these feelings when they smoke . 
  the social aspect is arguably a thing , but smokers are becoming rarer and rarer these days , so i suspect that will diminish somewhat over time . 
  edit : honestly , you can downvote me all you want , but this is the truth !, 
  does n't explain the yellow staining all over the ceiling and floor , and i do n't think i buy `` exploding ballast '' in the first place . 
  i 'd expect to see a concentration nearer to where the light was ( to be honest i 'd expect to see a semi-circle centered over where the ballast would have been ) , and possibly even some damage for an explosion that big . 
  i 'll admit that seems pretty heavy for a smoke stain , though . 
  but that still seems like a reasonable explanation . 
  that seems reasonably believable . 
  yes . 
  except that , once addicted , normal dopamine production in the smoker 's brain is reduced to compensate for the dopamine that 's released when smoking . 
  at which point smokers * need * to smoke just to `` feel normal '' . 
  but that 's a far more subtle effect than is provided by simply relieving the withdrawal symptoms . 
  the law was intended to protect users ' privacy from large-scale behavioural tracking . 
  the law hoped to achieve this by forcing the sites to ask the user 's permission doing said behavioural tracking . 
  what actually happened was the lawmakers got hung up on the technology being used , in this case cookies , and framed the wording of the law around the use and misuse of tracking cookies . 
  add that to the complete clusterfuck that ensued when the laws went into force , and total lack of any reasonable guidance from the regulatory bodies , and we 've ended up in a situation where everyone has missed the point . 
  what 's happened is this : anyone with an analytics system on their website , or cookies that are used for purposes past providing features like shopping baskets has implemented a notice telling users that cookies have been set . 
  this is entirely not what the law was intending - it is n't concerned with a single site 's analytics , and it specifically says sites should ask for permission * before * setting cookies , not just tell them it happened . 
  what 's worse , is the big ad networks are still tracking people , without asking , or even informing users of their use of cookies !, 
  so , yes . 
  now we 're stuck with websites that pop up cryptic messages about cookies every time we visit them . 
  awesome . 
  another eu directive that 's turned into complete fucking monkey tennis . 
  panda . 
  hot . 
  here 's a [ street view link ] ( https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=ferry+hinksey+road,+oxford&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=51.750285,-1.277048&amp;spn=0.003354,0.004302&amp;sll=51.462243,-0.114048&amp;sspn=0.013502,0.017209&amp;oq=ferry+hinksey+road&amp;t=h&amp;gl=uk&amp;hnear=ferry+hinksey+rd,+oxford,+united+kingdom&amp;z=18&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=51.750141,-1.276954&amp;panoid=dtmmz1tqvluh-9ulnw_zma&amp;cbp=12,176.19,,0,18.07 ) from before the grafitti went up .
