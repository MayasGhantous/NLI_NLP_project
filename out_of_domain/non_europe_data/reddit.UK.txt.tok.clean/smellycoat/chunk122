  if you turn around you 'll see why it 's called electric avenue . 
  that 's near where i work , i go past that every morning . 
  i 'm currently struggling to decide whether to be excited my little town is on reddit , or pissed off that i could have had all this sweet , sweet karma for myself if i 'd bothered to post a photo ... 
  i read that as `` this is a chalk drawing , not a potato '' . 
  i 'm a tiny but disappointed , if i 'm honest . 
  `` this video contains content from channel 4 , who has blocked it in your country on copyright grounds . '',

  sorbs buy up expired domains , stick mailservers on them and list any ip that hits them , causing all manner of trouble . 
  i 'm not sure if they 're still doing the $ 50 delisting fee ( they were definitely still doing it long after they 'd removed any mention from their website , though ) . 
  they 're basically scam artists , and fortunately these days it 's reasonably safe to ignore them . 
  splendid use of `` embrasure '' there . 
  bravo , sir . 
  around 3:00 the narrator says `` state of the art equipment '' while the screen is clearly showing them using blu-tack to attach them to some test equipment . 
  no it is n't . 
  they might have slightly iffy mailing practices , but that 's a legitimate marketing email . 
  papajohns use [ exacttarget ] ( http://www.exacttarget.com ) to send their marketing email . 
  while they 're certainly in the business of sending as much email as they can , they have no desire to spam people that do n't want it ( not least because they make no attempt to hide who they are , so blocking them would be simple ) . 
  if you 're having trouble unsubscribing , then the best way to deal with it is to fire off a quick email to exacttarget 's abuse address : abuse@exacttarget.com ( include a copy of the email you received , ideally . 
  failing that make sure you include the email address they 're sending to ) . 
  they 'll almost certainly remove you from future mailings and ( if they 're a half decent abuse desk ) will look into why your unsubscribe request did n't work . 
  oh totally . 
  just thought it was amusing they picked that particular shot to show when the narrator was talking about `` state of the art equipment '' , 
  i imagine it is !, 
  top ten email marketing providers ... in order of how much affiliate kickback you get ? 
  if it 's brown it 's cooked , if it 's black it 's fooked . 
  ca n't find it .

  okay i 'm * so * going to forget about where i hid half my settings stuff .

  this is the first tune i 've wanted to play that i have n't been able to find tabs for , and i 'm struggling a bit ! . 
  i managed to work out it starts with g - c - d ( or at least something close to that ) , but then i get lost . 
  hopefully this should be pretty straightforward for someone that does n't have cloth ears like me , 
  yes .

  [ no capes !,

  that 's probably caused by a fuckup like :, 
  that looks invalid , but is valid syntax ( if not a valid attribute ) as an html boolean attribute ( like , for example , ` < input type = `` text '' disabled  ` ) . 
  now , boolean attributes are n't supported in xhtml ( well , they 're not valid in xml , hence not used in xhtml ) . 
  instead they 're written like ` < input type = `` text '' disabled = `` disabled ''  ` . 
  it ' relatively easy to see how , when converting from html to xhtml with an automated tool ( or even just trying to tidy up the html ) , this kind of thing could happen . 
  while not not acceptable , is at least easy to see how it might happen . 
  anyway sorry . 
  i always feel like a tit explaining stuff like this , i 'm not sure why i thought it 'd be a good idea this time . 
  interested in a bunch of 3-6 year old dell desktops and/or rackmount servers ? 
  most will be without hard drives , is the only wrinkle . 
  the desktops are cheap optiplex things , but the servers are all pretty decent quality mid to high end poweredges . 
  ai n't you seen no muthafuckin ' helvetica befo ' , niggah ?!, 
  kidding . 
  that 's helvetica , 
  i hope you 're okay , dude . 
  take a fucking break !, 
  like 8 years ago this would have been utterly awesome . 
  now it 's just 8 years too late and we 've all moved on . 
  seriously i 've been wishing for this for years , but it 's just too late . 
  one slip can ruin their evening . 
  ftfy, 
  i recently spent # 25 on 250 plastic disposable chinese-takeaway style containers . 
  each is probably good for 3-5 reuses , depending on how stinky the food is you put in , and whether they get microwaved or not ( they ca n't survive many nukings without deforming ) . 
  for the man who frequently throws away tupperware rather than clean the week-old filth out of it , this seemed like a pretty good alternative !,

  [ apple chancery ] ( http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/apple/chancery/ ) , final offer !, 
  edit ( again ) : if you want something close that you 've probably got already , try [ monotype corsiva ] ( http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/monotype-corsiva/ ) . 
  why ? 
  it 's a pretty small city so you 're never far from an exchange - adsl is okay pretty much everywhere . 
  there 's bt infinity in a few places , but many areas have cable ( from virgin ) who offer speeds up to 120mbit . 
  check to see if you can get cable at your new place ( around the cowley rd should have it ) . 
  you 've got a perfect voice for ska tunes , 
  if you look / really / carefully , the sun looks almost exactly like a burned retina !, 
  that 's fucking awesome !, 
  i had the same problem . 
  went to the lbs and they built me a new rear wheel using spokes intended for tandems . 
  was n't cheap , but i have n't broken one since !, 
  `` holibobs '' . 
  grrrr . 
  the guy who ran it had a sex change . 
  i shit you not , 
  that 's awesome . 
  why have i never heard these dudes before ? 
  more like that !, 
  or one half-decent lock and a bike that is n't too fancy , that works too . 
  my reasonably-well-maintained but somewhat ugly hybrid has been left locked up in some pretty daft places ( often for days at a time ) with no problems over the last 5-6 years . 
  compared to the shiny new commuter bike i bought that got stolen from outside the office within a couple of months , despite multiple locks . 
  it 's not as if modern family was suffering from a shortage of plot ... 
  that , my friend , is [ futura ] ( http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/futura/ ), 
  $ 149 per server per month is like half the cost of our servers ... 
  the per-server pricing model does n't work well for people going for large numbers of lower-spec servers ... 
  niggah , ai n't you seen no god damn [ helvetica ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/helvetica ) befo ' ? 
  is that simply because it 's more dense , or is there something else going on there ? 
  . . even the shark in jaws, 
  does n't actually need to be a heater , a desk fan will work almost as well ( and use a fraction of the electricity ),
