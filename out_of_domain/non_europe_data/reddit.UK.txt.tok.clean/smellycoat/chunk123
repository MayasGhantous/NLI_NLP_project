  honestly i know it 's not what you 're asking , but [ iterm2 ] ( http://www.iterm2.com/ ) is so damn good that for a heavy ssh user ( like myself ) it alone is almost worth the apple tax ...

  food is great , beer is pretty good ( 2/3rd pint schooners are . . interesting , but not entirely unpleasant ) , although it has more of a student union bar feel than an american style diner .

  this is tweaking my font-geek ocd in a bad way . 
  i tried and tried and tried to learn to sing and play at the same time for weeks by playing the chords repeatedly then trying to sing/hum quietly over the top ( thinking i 'd work on making the singing better once i got the basics nailed ) . 
  but i had very little success . 
  eventually the thing that made it click for me was making singing the primary thing i was focusing on , and not thinking so much about the guitar - basically trying to play on autopilot . 
  i had a major breakthrough by trying to sing loud , and pausing a tiny bit at each chord change so i could hear the chord and sing the next bit in tune . 
  it really was like the two activities working together as one thing , and the whole process got much easier . 
  the song i did most of my learning on was neutral milk hotel 's in the aeroplane over the sea . 
  very simple rhythm . 
  good luck !, 
  yes .

  storage heaters work by heating up large bricks at night when electricity is cheap , and then using that stored energy to heat the room over the course of the day , by opening vents to allow heat out . 
  on a typical storage heater you 'd have an input and output control . 
  input controls how much energy is put into the bricks overnight , and output controls how much heat is allowed to radiate . 
  generally speaking you 'd set the output control to 0 at night , and turn it up during the day ( or whenever you need heat ) . 
  the input control is a bit more difficult , as you ca n't know for sure how much energy you 'll need the next day , so it can take a little while to learn its quirks . 
  basically , if it 's going to be bastard cold the next day , crank it up a bit , otherwise turn it down . 
  generally speaking the heater will be set up so that the max input setting will be just enough heat to get you through a typical british winter day ( so you probably do n't need it on max quite yet ) . 
  english breakfast is primarily assam with some other bits and bobs thrown in .

  my girlfriend of 12 years ran off with a guy 10 years her junior . 
  that was n't a lot of fun . 
  the fact he was much younger and skinnier than i totally buttfucked what little self-esteem i had . 
  if it 's any consolation , it gets easier . 
  that 's a lie , it does n't get easier , but you do think about it less frequently , which is nearly the same thing . 
  two pieces of advice i can offer you that helped me :, 
  * `` make new memories '' . 
  by which i mean go and do new/interesting/dumb shit so all your experiences are n't relative to her . 
  eventually you 'll stop comparing things to times you had with her . 
  * channel the soul-crushing despair into something positive . 
  i was getting pretty self-destructive , but was convinced to focus on quitting smoking . 
  it was hell , but i was fucked up enough at the time that i had the stubbornness to see it through - something i was unlikely to be able to do otherwise . 
  hit the gym , learn a new skill , redecorate your house . 
  something . 
  good luck bro , 
  awesome !, 
  i 'll make that badboy for dinner . .

  off topic but . . caffeine is dead easy to quit , if you do it right . 
  cravings are pretty minimal , people mainly have trouble with the rituals ( coffee in the morning , etc ) , and the side effects ( the withdrawal headaches are like being stabbed in the back of the head - not fun ! ) . 
  what worked really well for me was using caffeine pills . 
  i worked out what my consumption was , dosed myself a similar amount with the pills while i set about breaking the habit ( mostly just switching to water ) . 
  once i 'd done that i slowly weaned myself off the tablets over the course of a few weeks . 
  very easy , and i did n't have any of the tiredness or headaches that had ruined previous attempts . 
  you misunderstand how typical locks and keys work - there are only a finite number of possible keys . 
  and actually , that 's fine , because locks are n't infallible . 
  it just needs to be harder to find a matching key than to break the lock or whatever it 's locking .
