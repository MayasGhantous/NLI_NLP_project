  perfect , thanks man . 
  this is the kind of information i need , 
  any ideas how much dances are there ? 
  nice . 
  looks like sugar lounge is the ticket . 
  thanks , 
  sugar lounge it is !, 
  thanks mate !, 
  alas , apparently closed now :(, 
  i called but the guy did n't seem too forthcoming with discounts , etc , but this is all awesome information . 
  thanks so much !, 
  almost certainly a gyroscope . 
  [ here 's ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao7pn3uiwa0 ) a ( fascinating ) teardown of a device with a similar warning on the side . 
  the variable stroke weight rules out gill sans . 
  something along the lines if optima , maybe ? 
  that 's not quite right either but getting a bit closer ... 
  if i was n't on my phone i 'd have a look around for you . 
  while i do agree with you , there 's a difference between removing functionality purely for aesthetic reasons and removing functionality to actually improve something . 
  apple , for instance , are excellent at dropping functionality without compromising experience . 
  for the same reason theists procreate . 
  because they 're biologically programmed to want to do so . 
  that is to say ; because they want to . 
  pretty sure most atheists relish a chance to argue on a solid point . 
  the things that 'll get downvoted are the answered-a-million-times stupid soundbites of the `` then why are there still monkeys ?!?!, 
  explain that atheists !! '', 
  i have that [ exact table ] ( http://i.imgur.com/8tb6jkb.jpg ) ( apologies for potato quality ) , except mine is constant . 
  and has a lot more crap on it . 
  hot damn girl , those eyebrows are fierce . 
  disco ball, 
  what the fuck is that ?!, 
  good god man do n't touch it !, 
  absolutely . 
  putting the car in neutral will use more fuel . 
  admittedly not much more , but still . 
  also by keeping the car in gear , the engine is providing some resistance , reducing wear on your brakes . 
  and it keeps the engine turning over at a decent rpm so you do n't have to use fuel to get if back up to speed at the bottom of the hill . 
  in fact it 's common when driving a car with manual transmission to rely heavily ( even solely ) on engine braking to reduce descent speed on moderate slopes . 
  source : i live in the uk where we do n't go in for those fancy schmancy automatic gearboxes . 
  i 'm disappointed that is n't a thing elsewhere . 
  in fact no , i 'm disappointed that it needs to be a thing in the first place . 
  not sure why you 're being downvoted . 
  this is precisely the reason they 're there , to prevent it from being modified into a proper bladed balisong . 
  balisongs are very illegal in the uk at least ( more illegal than a gun - you can legally own or use a gun , no such luck with a balisong , illegal to buy , sell , own or use ) , so novelty versions are deliberately designed so they ca n't be easily , presumably to make it less likely the shipment will be rejected at customs . 
  get this racist shit out of my / r/punk . 
  edit : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjuuxouy1fg, 
  i looked into it a bit recently because i wanted to buy one ( at the time i had no idea they were illegal here ) . 
  customs are lazy . 
  something that looks like it 's designed to bypass the laws ( eg a `` blank '' unsharpened knife designed to be sharpened after import ) is much more likely to be seized . 
  that 's why almost every [ butterfly knife trainer ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=butterfly+knife+trainer&amp;safe=off&amp;espv=2&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=lspvu87wfyhroewngagk&amp;ved=0cacq_auoag&amp;biw=1214&amp;bih=1106 ) you can buy has either holes in the `` blade '' or something else to prevent them from being sharpened , simply to ensure they 're not mistaken for the real thing ( or something designed to be easily converted into the real thing ) . 
  pretty much the only thing that copyright boilerplate text is good for is working out whether a website has been abandoned or not , judging by how out of date the year is . 
  which is interesting as the only ** potential ** ( though flawed ) use case for that kind of statement is to prove something was written before some other copy , so updating it every year is completely counter-intuitive . 
  but if you do n't do it everyone assumes your site is massively outdated . 
  i digress ... 
  nothing , basically . 
  it 's fucking useless , 
  yeah can do !, 
  it 's a silver claud butler urban 200 ( well , the frame is , most of the rest of it has been replaced  ) . 
  not a lot in the way of pictures apart from this : http://i.imgur.com/ai0lxqj.jpg, 
  . . but it 's lots done to it since then ( notably it 's had its front derailleur and crankset removed and replaced with one of [ these ] ( http://www.universalcycles.com/images//products/large/33845.jpg ) and a pair of [ these ] ( http://gear.mpora.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/saint-pedal.jpg ) pedals ) . 
  apart from the lack of front derailleur , a subtle-but-distinguishing feature might be that the front wheel rim , hub , and spokes are black ( and crappy ) , while the rear are all silver ( and slightly less crappy ) . 
  honestly if anyone manages to find it , there 's a reward in it !, 
  good shout , i shall investigate , thanks , 
  will do , 
  yeah i 'll head down there at the weekend and have a looksee . 
  i posted some info elsewhere : http://www.reddit.com/r/oxford/comments/247rth/my_bike_got_stolen_any_ideas_where_it_might_end_up/ch4v6i3, 
  thanks muchly , 
  there 's no way ms were dumb enough not to realise that turning on dnt by default would be the beginning of the end for it . 
  that 's likely the minor resurgence that happened around the time that [ moose ] ( http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?moose ) became popular . 
  actually i think drivers only have to give way to pedestrians already on the crossing , not those standing on the pavement waiting . 
  i fucking love me a good star fort . 
  [ garamond ] ( http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/adobe-garamond/ ) or maybe [ bembo ] ( http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/bembo/ ) or some other oldschool roman serif . 
  kinda , yeah . 
  it 's set up so it 's next to impossible to fire cannons directly at any part of the wall without being in a direct line of fire from another part of the fort . 
  a self covering design , 
  there 's a big difference between water that 's brown and nasty because it 's muddy and water that 's brown and nasty because it 's full of concentrated fish poo, 
  um , really ? 
  it 's not quite , but its something very similar to [ din ] ( http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/din-1451/ ) . 
  try also [ this variant ] ( http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/dinmittel/ ) , [ ciutadella ] ( http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/emtype/ciutadella/semi-bold/ ) ( particularly that semibold ) , [ korolev ] ( http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/device/korolev/ ) , [ helsinki ] ( http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ludwiguebele/helsinki/ ) , [ ca cula ] ( http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/capearcona/ca-cula/ ) , [ elephant ] ( http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fw-alias/elephant/ ) . 
  none are quite right , but close . . 
  cheeselog . 
  if you know each other well enough that she was aware that you knew she was in a relationship ( ie , you know about her relationship for normal social reasons , not because you stalked her ) , then you 'll be fine . 
  if you feel weird about it try going in with just an `` oh i 'm sorry to hear that '' , and see what she says . 
  you can always drop in a `` what happened ? '', 
  if conversation stalls at that point . 
  stop overthinking it !, 
  at least in the uk there have been prosecutions : http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/10590181/motorist-faces-court-after-splashing-schoolchildren-with-puddle.html, 
  i have a [ dew plus ] ( http://www.konaworld.com/images/bikes/large/dew_plus_opt.jpg ) ( in white , it looks awesome ) , it 's nicely designed for the money . 
  the gears and disc brakes on it are a bit crappy , i 'd have preferred the money they spent on disc brakes to be put into better quality rim brakes and gears , but i was sold on the white frame so had to have it ( i 'm a bit of a tinkerer so it might end up with better gears and rim brakes one day ... ), 
  some random points in no particular order :, 
  if you 're interested in drop bars , stop looking at hybrids and pick a road bike or cyclocross bike that comes with them . 
  they 're a pain to add later ( as mentioned elsewhere , got ta change brakes and shifters so it gets pricey ) , and a hybrid frame geometry will be all wrong with drops on it . 
  if you expect to be mainly on roads ( and you wan na go fast ) , maybe look for something with narrower tyres . 
  i put slicker 32s on mine as i found the 35s it comes with a bit too squidgy and the extra tread was unnecessary ( i would have gone with 28s but i 'm a fat fucker  ) if you want something for 90 % road use , look for either a road bike with drops , or a flat bar hybrid with 28s or something ( specialized 's cirrus and trek 's 7 . x hybrid range come with 28s , those are very popular and great bikes - i test rode them both . 
  chose kona in the end as they had a frame size suitable for me ) . 
  i 'm entirely with you on minimalist designs . 
  if you like the simple single crank on the felt ( and think you can do without the other chainrings ) , you can always fit one aftermarket and lose the front shifter . 
  i did just that on my last bike , and put a reasonably cheap [ shimano alfine ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=alfine+crankset ) single crankset . 
  i did n't much use the other chainrings so it worked for me , and i loved it . 
  might do the same on this one . 
  i agree with what someone else said here about the felt 's weirdly big rear triangle .
