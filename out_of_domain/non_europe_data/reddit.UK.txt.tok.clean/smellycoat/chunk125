  i 'm not sure how much fun that 'll be to ride , but if you want something with a relaxed feel it might work for you . 
  dew has a relatively tight rear triangle so feels a bit more agile . 
  if you 're a fan of the matte black look and are n't afraid of a bit of diy , you can always [ plastidip ] ( http://www.plastidip.com/ ) any bike  it 's easy , looks good and protects the original paintwork . 
  cool video , but that 's the worst music i 've ever heard . 
  that 's ... really fucking clever !, 
  if the bottle is n't full , you can squeeze the air out of the bottle and reseal it . 
  that gives the gas room to come out , but without the risks of having an open bottle in the fridge . 
  also means you can control how much of the fizz you lose ( ie , if you want to reduce it but not eliminate it you could just squeeze the bottle a bit ) . 
  i used to use this technique back in my soda-drinking days as i did n't like them super fizzy . 
  i do n't think it 's possible to fit a belt to a bike not designed for it . 
  unlike a chain , a belt is one piece and ca n't be cut , so the bike needs a gap in the rear triangle somewhere to get the belt `` inside '' ( so it runs over the [ chainstay ] ( http://www.pedals2people.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bikepic.png ) ) . 
  most frames designed for chains do n't have this gap . 
  fitting lights is dead easy . 
  installing a dynamo hub , not so much . 
  it * is * possible , but means building a new front wheel ( doable , but difficult and requires specialist tools ) . 
  a bike shop will be able to build you a suitable wheel , or you can probably purchase a complete wheel with a hub dynamo in it already . 
  are you totally sold on the nuvinci hub/belt drive ? 
  it 's an odd choice for a first commuter bike . 
  those nuvinci gears are very cool , but there are tradeoffs : they 're heavy , expensive and lower pedalling efficiency . 
  there 's a reason 98 % of bikes still have derailleur gears - they 're light , easy to maintain , reliable , efficient , cheap , etc. 
  my recommendation ? 
  get a reasonably-priced , derailleur-equipped hybrid with tyres suited to your journey ( say 28mm if it 's all road , 35-40mm if it 's a bit bumpier ) , and some removable lights ( knog do nice usb-rechargeable ones ) . 
  rack and mudguards can be fitted easily aftermarket . 
  you should be able to get a nice one for around half your budget !, 
  how about this [ trek 7.4 ] ( http://www.trekbikes.com/us/en/bikes/road/fitness/fx/7_4_fx/# ) ? 
  there 's a [ disc brake version ] ( http://www.trekbikes.com/us/en/bikes/road/fitness/fx/7_4_fx_disc/# ) too , if that 's your thing . 
  i 'm 6 ' 5 '' so i feel ( some of ) your pain with frame sizes !, 
  many manufacturers do n't make anything that fits me , let alone you . 
  trek do 25 '' frames in some of their models . 
  i tried a 25 '' [ 7.2 fx ] ( http://www.trekbikes.com/us/en/bikes/road/fitness/fx/7_2_fx/ ) that was a little too big for me , so i 'm thinking trek might be the way to go for you . 
  their [ road bikes ] ( http://www.trekbikes.com/us/en/bikes/road/performance_race/1_series/1_1_h2_compact/# ) go up pretty big too ( but i 'm not a road bike guy so i 'm not sure if the measurements are comparable on a bike with drop bars ) . 
  in terms of gears , unless you 're really sold on a single speed/hub gear , i 'd probably suggest getting something with a standard derailleur . 
  hub gears are heavier and less efficient , and even if you do n't have any hills , having a gear range helps so you can drop a few gears to accelerate/pull away quickly or so you can change up and hit 30mph pedalling down a hill like a lunatic , 
  at 250lb , if you 'll forgive my bluntness ( i 'm heavier , and shorter , if that helps any  ) you probably do n't want to go * too * light , or you 'll just break stuff !, 
  yeah i do n't have a problem with internal hub gears ( i had a scott sub with an alfine 8 on it for a while ) , but they * are * expensive , heavy and less efficient . 
  not to the point where it 's a massive problem , but it 's something to be aware of . 
  however the nuvinci hubs are even heavier than typical ones , even less efficient and really expensive - again that 's probably ok if you 're aware of it , but you have to be very sure you want one !, 
  yeah i agree , they 're perfectly good bikes . 
  i guess the point i was trying to make is that a derailleur is a bit more flexible so i struggle a bit to recommend an internal gear for a first bike . 
  but yes , in the right situation they 're awesome . 
  glad i could help , dude !, 
  they 're solid bikes . 
  the fx range goes from $ 400 to a few thousand ( and i think they all come in 25 '' frames ) , so you should be able to find something in there that suits you . 
  go find a bike shop and test-ride one !, 
  ( seriously , test ride before buying ! ), 
  you do n't say much about the style of bike you 're after or what you 'd like , so i 'm gon na guess a pretty typical hybrid . 
  if you want quicker , look at road bikes with drop bars and thinner tyres , or you could maybe go fixie or singlespeed if you want something that looks more fashionable . 
  if you do n't know/care , then for a first bike i 'd recommend something with gears to give you the most flexibility . 
  even if you do n't have hills , you 'll still use them . 
  how about a [ specialized sirrus ] ( http://www.specialized.com/gb/gb/bikes/fitness/sirrus/sirrus ) ? 
  nice bikes . 
  can be had for [ about $ 500 ] ( http://www.eriksbikeshop.com/specialized-2014-sirrus-base-event-bike/pr3c14881/product ) . 
  it 's a hybrid ( so flat bars ) , but 28c tyres means it 'll be nice and quick . 
  i could totally learn dutch . 
  you want a [ conformal coating ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/conformal_coating ) , it 's specifically designed for waterproofing pcbs . 
  alas , i do n't have any left or i 'd offer you some . 
  ebay has some [ suitable rattlecans ] ( http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/pro-power-ppc121-pro-power-conformal-coating-400ml-/171329872497?pt=uk_boi_electrical_components_supplies_et&amp;hash=item27e40e6271 ) if you 've got a few quid . . 
  do you even car ? 
  dominos are likely to be a catch-all type as that just gets shown to anyone ( since they 're pretty universal in their appeal ) . 
  it 's not like they show you no ads when they ca n't find any tracking information about you ... 
  a non-serrated knife will always give you a better cut as long as the blade is sharp enough that it cuts before it starts to crush the material . 
  a serrated blade , on the other hand , produces a rougher cut , but does n't require ( as much ) downward pressure , so is less likely to crush . 
  some particularly dumb servers * can * be tricked into thinking you 're coming from a particular ip ( by faking an [ x-forwarded-for ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/x-forwarded-for ) header , which is [ pretty easy ] ( http://techgeek.com.au/2012/02/09/how-to-watch-the-daily-show-colbert-report-abroad-with-no-vpn/ ) ) . 
  now , you 're not going to trick anyone who 's trying to do any real ip security stuff ( they 'll have thought of this ) , but you might just fool people that are only recording ips for logging purposes . . 
  not suggesting that 's necessarily what 's happened here ( although it 'd probably be reasonably easy to work out if the site in question is vulnerable to this ) , but it might explain why people seem to think it 's a trivial thing . 
  i 'm slowly learning the chords version of [ the decline ] ( http://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/n/nofx/the_decline_crd.htm ) . 
  it 's an awesome song with a bit more variety to it than your typical three or four chord punk tune ( not that there 's anything wrong with those , of course ) , so it stands up on its own even with no other instruments or vocals . 
  [ astro zombies ] ( http://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/m/my_chemical_romance/astro_zombies_crd.htm ) is another good one ( may danzig forgive me for the fact that these are the chords for the my chemical romance version ! ), 
  there 's absolutely nothing weird about a woman breastfeeding a child . 
  there 's * absolutely * something weird about a woman breast feeding a deer . 
  consider some other bodily-fluid-exchanging activity ( kissing , sex stuff ) , that 'd be a pretty weird thing to do with an animal . 
  look , i 'm with you that breastfeeding your children is normal , healthy and generally a good thing to do . 
  i 'm not sure i 'd go as far as `` beautiful '' , but whatever . 
  the fact remains , however , that to most people , breastfeeding a random animal * is * a bit socially unacceptable . 
  and , furthermore , i 'd bet there are good , solid evolutionary reasons * why * the exchange of bodily fluids outside of a long-term trusting relationship is socially unacceptable . 
  i imagine that our species developing that particular stigma has saved many from unnecessary disease . 
  a reasonable point , that is a bit strange . 
  although i imagine most would find the idea of drinking cow 's milk [ directly from the udder ] ( https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2789/4347479850_e2328e7ffc.jpg ) a little bit odd . . 
  i enjoyed the shit out of better off ted . 
  when i 'm dealing with people who are a bit flaky and are liable to ignore a request , i often do this just to make sure they ca n't pretend they did n't see it . 
  is this what happened when i went temporarily blind after snorting a ( foolishly large ) line of cocaine , given it 's a vasoconstrictor ? 
  that 's some fantastic plot right there . 
  i favour a lightweight , crappy combination cable lock , plus good insurance . 
  the cost is comparable to a decent u-lock . 
  aww, 
  this . 
  the landlord is obligated to put your deposit into the deposit protection scheme , which provides third party arbitration in the event of a dispute . 
  if he has n't put it under the dps then he 's liable to pay you a fair chunk of money . 
  read more here :, 
  ask about the dps , ask about third party arbitration . 
  when he says no say you 'll be taking him to the small claims court . 
  watch him immediately return your money !, 
  the kerning on that poster gave me cancer,
