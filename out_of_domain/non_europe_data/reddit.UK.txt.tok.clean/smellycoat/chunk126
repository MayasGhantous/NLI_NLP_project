  scott sub indeed sound about right . 
  do n't get the hub geared ones if you expect to do any jumping ( they 're really heavy at the back , anything more than a bunnyhop feels weird and wrong ) . 
  how about a [ kona dew plus ] ( http://www.konaworld.com/dew_plus.cfm ) . 
  i 've owned both a hub geared scott sub and a dew plus - would recommend the dew plus . 
  to be honest , though , i imagine pretty much any hybrid with reasonably fat tyres will work for you . 
  nice try , kfc, 
  that 's very close . 
  admittedly it 's hard to tell given the blurriness but i think it 's [ tabac slab ] ( http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/suitcase/tabac-slab/regular/glyphs.html?render=old ) . 
  the angled ends of the serifs on the s match nicely . 
  my bet 's on [ tabac slab ] ( http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/suitcase/tabac-slab/regular/glyphs.html?render=old ) . 
  welcome to the list . 
  we hope you like the country you 're currently in . 
  it will be transmuted by the post office 's secretive alchemists into a small card demanding a ludicrous sum of money that will be gruffly thrust through your letterbox by a discontented morning goblin . 
  hmm . 
  antic slab 's s is wider at the bottom , which does n't fit . 
  and i 'm pretty sure i can see angled ends to the serifs on the s and t ( admittedly it 's tricky to tell ) , which would fit with tabac slab . 
  it * might * be antic slab , but if i were a gambling man i 'd still put my money on tabac . 
  difficult to say for sure since it 's almost certainly a hand-drawn bitmap font , but it 's likely based on [ eurostile extended ] ( http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itfmecanorma/eurostile/ ) ( a pretty commonly used font in scifi stuff ) . 
  i lost my shit at lesser knapweed flower weevil . 
  ah everyone loves a nice mature bit of helmetdale . 
  goes well on crackers . 
  except they 're fucking huge , bigger than the old 50ps , and virtually worthless . 
  they make up for it with the plastic notes , those are cool . 
  cider here in the uk basically starts at 6 %, 
  just to add to this a bit , most ( all ? 
  the ones i 've used all do ) credit card companies offer a facility to set up a payment from your account to automatically pay off the entire balance at the end of each month . 
  i 've been doing it for years , with most of my spending going via a credit card . 
  it works wonderfully and have never been charged any interest . 
  yeah i think i 'm going to have to . 
  i tried cracking some paint off but it did n't clarify things very much . 
  thanks for looking at least though !, 
  i took a photo of [ the least hospitable area i 've ever seen ] ( http://imgur.com/kmx7psb ) somewhere around china . 
  interesting . 
  never had any marketing stuff from crc , despite lots of orders . 
  i 've done four already this morning . 
  if that 's the case , they really need to be a bit more careful with their marketing ... 
  some people react worse than others to flea bites . 
  if they 're concentrated on the lower half of your body , and you have pets , then i 'd say fleas are high up on the suspect list . . 
  have you properly checked your cats for fleas ? 
  honestly i 'd take it seriously , fleas can be a nightmare to get rid of and the longer you leave it the harder it gets ... 
  unf . 
  unf . 
  coconut water . 
  it feels so damn hydrating . 
  apart from lacking a bit of sodium , it 's pretty much perfect for rehydrating , and has way less sugar than soft drinks . 
  apparently back in ww1 , it was given to soldiers intravenously when there was no saline solution available . 
  which i thought was quite an interesting fact . 
  that is genius . 
  i have the same scale and it did the exact same thing to me this morning , for the first time . 
  i 've had a very similar problem with my last bike . 
  could be almost any part if the drivetrain as has been mentioned , but mine turned out to be my nds pedal had been overtightened and had bitten into the alu of the crank . 
  greasing and retightening fixed it . 
  worth checking !, 
  that said , my current bike had the same problem and i totally failed to track it down . 
  bought an entirely new ( much better ) groupset in desperation/drunken-whim and had loads of fun working out how to fit it . 
  expensive , but worth it !, 
  that is the greatest suggestion ever . 
  hairway to steven, 
  [ not really what he said ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui4z1h7pg5s ) . 
  or maybe he 's changed his mind . 
  would fuck . 
  if it 's not caslon , my vote would be [ fleishman ] ( http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/fleischman-bt-pro/ ) or [ century old style ] ( http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/century-os-mt/ ) . 
  pretty sure it 's not a pixel font - it 's far too messy to be deliberate ( i hope !, 
  ) , and the `` r `` s are different . 
  you 're right that a simple regex like this does n't match every valid email address , but one could certainly match every * useful * email address . . 
  well that 's just a shitty regexp validator . 
  does n't mean the technique ca n't work , just means some people are idiots . 
  what i 'm getting at is that , yes the email address format accepts crazy shit , but most of the world agrees it 's localpart@domain . 
  there 's a regex in an rfc for validating domains ( on my phone and too lazy to find it ) , so anything@valid-domain is a pretty simple regexp to put together , which matches everything a modern person expects from an email address . 
  you can add some basic exclusions from the localpart as well ( eg @ ) to avoid common typos . 
  sounds like a fuckup somewhere . 
  are they coming in via a feedback loop ? 
  which provider is it ? 
  you could always contact them , most of the big webmail players are receptive , returnpath run most every other fbl and they 'll answer questions too ... 
  to be honest i 'd be inclined to give it a day or so and see if it stops . 
  i ca n't imagine it 'll have a significantly negative effect . 
  that 's . 
  wow . 
  and bacon . 
  burned black . 
  the top cap must be tightened first ? 
  really ? 
  oh dude , that 's awful . 
  you have my deepest sympathies . 
  please talk to someone about this . 
  that last part has been the hardest for me !, 
  til top caps are n't just to stop crap getting into the steerer tube !, 
  hmm . 
  while i generally prefer postfix syntax for stuff like this , that 's feels like it 's just replacing one ugly , hard-to-grok syntax with another ugly , hard-to-grok syntax . 
  except that the new one is longer . 
  and ( depending how you feel about asterisks ) , more line-noisy . 
  catchy . 
  source : blind racism ? 
  beautiful . 
  [ they 're ] ( http://www.neemantools.com/en/products/leather-belts ) not silly expensive either . 
  had the same problem . 
  after many months of wrangling i tried it . 
  was extremely self-conscious at first , but it turns out nobody gives a fuck . 
  man up and use your fingers . 
  i imagine because his shows are basically the same kind of thing as a ted talk , but in a format that makes them way way more lucrative for him .
