  what an awesome toilet seat, 
   outgoing , extremely friendly , and disinhibited , as well as `` somewhat coquettish '' ( playfully flirtatious ) and having an abnormally high desire and tendency to approach others,

  a few mates and i go to [ britchcombe farm ] ( http://www.britchcombefarm.co.uk/ ) in uffington most years , it 's a beautiful place . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vjquozu.jpg ) a photo i took that makes it look like teletubbyland . 
  would n't `` irl '' have been better than `` afk '' ? 
  the london underground uses [ johnston ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/johnston_\\ ( typeface \\ ) ) , not gill sans . 
  although they are similar ( and related ) . 
  they ca n't control what developers do , and releasing such a demo would either delay the game , take resources away from it or cost more , so i ca n't see many devs doing that . 
  i think valve are doing it right by allowing you to get a refund on a game if you have n't played it much . 
  that 's got to be the way forward . 
  i ca n't not join in ... , 
  i was thinking of random words to see if it still worked , first thing that popped into my head was `` trousers '' . 
  totally works . 
  yeah but you generally do n't have to worry ( much ) about ie6 and 7 these days . 
  i know which i 'd rather !, 
  but because the spec ( such as it is ) allows fields to be quoted , using a proper csv generator is infinitely better than the alternative of some random guy going `` oh pipes almost never turn up in my data , i 'll just use those as a delimiter and assume i wo n't ever need to quote or escape '' . 
  because pipes will show up in your data , eventually . 
  and then your shit will break , and you 'll have a bad day . 
  why ? 
  if you 're using a csv generator , then what delimiter you pick does n't make much difference to you . 
  but many systems that support csvs only support commas for delimiters , or make weird assumptions about files with other delimiters ( such as that they do n't support quotes ) . 
  sticking to commas gets you best compatibility . 
  i do a lot of csv work too . 
  it 's naively-created csv files that cause most problems for me . 
  yeah pipes are less likely to show up in data , and so it 's a bit more robust as a delimiter , but all it takes is a pipe character in your data ( which will eventually happen if you 're accepting user data ! ), 
  to break your files , so they 're still fairly fragile . 
  the easiest thing to do is just throw the data at a csv generator , regardless of the delimiter that will provide you with a robust , properly-formatted file !, 
  if you do n't have any preconceptions about the type of bike , i recommend a rigid-framed hybrid . 
  that 's usable basically anywhere . 
  most major manufacturers make one , and they 're available at a lot of price points . 
  worry about suspension only if you 're travelling on extremely bumpy ground , otherwise it costs more , adds weight and saps power . 
  as for tyres , most hybrids come with 35mm or 40mm fairly slick tyres . 
  that tread pattern is good for roads and their size gives you a bit of absorption on bumpy tracks at the expense of a little bit of efficiency . 
  only consider knobby tyres where you 'll regularly be riding on very loose or muddy surfaces . 
  trek 's fx line sounds like it 'll work for you . 
  you 'll probably fit on a 21 '' frame , but it 's much better to go to a shop and test some out rather than guessing . 
  the light they give off is pretty nasty and not at all like sunlight , it 's basically only good for seeing roughly what you 're doing at night . 
  but the side-effect of the weird orange light is that it 's less disruptive to those ( people with a light outside their window , animals , stargazers , etc ) who do n't want extra light ... 
  disc brakes are better for stopping in the wet , and in theory require less maintenance day to day ( but when they do need maintenance , it 's more work ) . 
  however discs cost more , so for a given budget a bike with disc brakes will compromise elsewhere . 
  either will work fine unless you 're riding down mountains . 
  i 'm similar weight . 
  you should n't have major problems . 
  avoid suspension and particularly suspension seat posts ( it 'll be too squishy to be useful ) , rely on tyres for shock absorption ( 35mm is a good place to start ) and keep them inflated . 
  i tend to break factory-built rear wheels ( tho i abuse them so you might not have the same experience ) . 
  if you break a spoke have the bike shop rebuild the wheel with better spokes and you should n't ever have the problem again . 
  fit is important if you 're a bit heavier , so definitely test ride some . 
  fuji are good . 
  trek , giant , specialized are a few more to consider . 
  personally i 'd go with whatever trek fx fits your budget , but there 's tons of good bikes out there . 
  good luck !, 
  he sounds like an [ asshole ] ( http://youtu.be/yznkjdxaw88 ) . 
  yes , although if you pick a hard-to-guess mailbox its effectively private for its intended use . 
  this dude did n't say why he was asking the question , so i was taking a guess it was to make mailboxes quickly to sign up to stuff . 
  it goes round the wrong way !, 
  the one in my local coop says you can `` tap '' , however the gormless bloke at the till will eventually say `` nah mate , ya got ta put ya card in da slot , innit '' after you try 7 or 8 times . 
  the pool in la fitness is tiny . 
  ferry pool between summertown and marston is council run , far cheaper and much bigger . 
  they do adult swims most days . 
  [ cateye 's basic 3-led rear light ] ( http://www.cateye.com/en/products/detail/tl-ld135-r/ ) are cheap , well-designed and ubiquitous , but more than bright enough for a rear light , with good runtime on a pair of batteries . 
  importantly for me they 're rather small and boring with a nice solid clip , so less likely to get stolen than fancier-looking alternatives . 
  alas , they 're aaa not aa . 
  but they run for ages . 
  beautiful , love that song .

  about `` rode '' rage !, 
  man i 'm not sure anyone proofread this pile of shit . 
  according to their [ annual statement ] ( http://www.whitbread.co.uk/content/dam/whitbread/download_centre/reports_and_results/2015/interactive-annual-report-2015.pdf ) , they made over # 450m in profit last fy . 
  the article says they have 34k employees earning below the new minimum wage . 
  assuming they all work 40 hours per week ( probably unlikely ) , the extra 70p per hour would cost them ~ # 49m per year . 
  a little over 10 % of their profit . 
  not turnover , profit . 
  now i 'm not suggesting companies do n't deserve to turn a profit , or even to put up their prices to cover cost increases . 
  but given they literally pay 75 % of their workforce as little as they can legally get away with - and relying on these people for their business - they could at least be a little less dickish about it . 
  it is . 
  but i find it in bad taste that they 're stroppily begrudging their lowest paid workers a modest pay rise , because they wo n't make * quite * as much extra profit this year . 
  they increased their profit by 33 % last year . 
  it 's not like this change is in any danger of harming their business !, 
  that 's an instrument , you dirty heathen !, 
  do n't have time to properly check but i want to say frutiger . 
  the home contents insurance i 've had only covers up to ~ # 400 worth of bike , and they also sometimes only cover the bike at the property , not when locked elsewhere or our on the road - check your policy before relying on contents insurance . 
  i claimed twice on barclays home insurance , and lost a bit of cash both times ( yes i was too lazy to sort it out after the first one ) . 
  on the plus side they waived the excess as my bike was worth a bit more . 
  in both cases , the bikes came from the cycle to work scheme , so i more or less broke even . 
  they did up my policy though , so i moved to cycleguard . 
  they 're the same as the scheme evans cycles offers , but a bit cheaper if you go direct . 
  btw when they last renewed my policy they charged me a bit more than their website was advertising .
