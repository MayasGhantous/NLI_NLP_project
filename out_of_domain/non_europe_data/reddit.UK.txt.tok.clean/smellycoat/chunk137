  i just learnt to piss accurately and never lift the seat . 
  actually it was living at a place with a heavy wooden seat that would sometimes spontaneously fall down that made me learn that particular skill . 
  but still , no seat lifting now . 
  ride bikes , play guitar , play games , watch awesome films , build lego , cook huge batches of chilli . 
  not a van , but bodrum on cowley road ( the far end , not the town end ) is * amazing * . 
  also another vote for botley kebab if your purveyor of spicy meat absolutely * must * be van-based . 
  [ life on earth ( 1979 ) ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/life_on_earth_ ( tv_series % 29 ) . 
  the production values are n't quite as high as planet earth , and there are some things that are now a little inaccurate ( the burgess shales segment , for example ) , but it 's amazing to see david attenborough in his heyday telling the story of the genesis and evolution of life on this planet his own way . 
  also the outfits are hilarious . 
  his first life documentary is fascinating too , that corrects a lot of the earlier misconception in life on earth 's explanation of the pre-cambrian explosion . 
  have the signal change frequency every time it transmits based on a predefined sequence ? 
  i must know . 
  chevy chase never played batman !, 
   i whistled for a camel, 
  lost it right there, 
  it could easily be the spokes . 
  spokes flex and rub over one another , and they can become corroded or collect dirt around the point where they cross which can cause them to make noise . 
  take each pair of spokes that cross and give them a squeeze , they should move a bit relative to one another . 
  if that makes any noise then clean and lubricants them . 
  if you have a lot of flex , or lots of spokes that make noise like this , then increasing spoke tension might solve it ( something like a quarter turn to every spoke ) . 
  are you sure that 's coming from the wheel itself ? 
  it sounds way more like gears to me . 
  http://naturalbreadcompany.co.uk awesome bread . 
  they have a cafe on little clarendon street which i have n't been to but am told is fantastic . 
  if you can be bothered to go to headington ( 10-15 min bus ride ) , jacobs and field certainly has the artisan hipster vibe : http://jacobsandfield.com, 
  m&s own brand wholemeal bread is definitely more expensive but it lasts a solid week ( longer if i wrap it up properly ) , so works out way cheaper than buying a loaf of hovis that 's stale and mouldy in a few days . 
  waitrose sell bread from jackson 's , that similarly lasts a ridiculous amount of time ( and is very tasty ) . 
  was the dark knight 's title really set in arial ? 
  never draw your gun unless you 're prepared to fire it : https://www.usacarry.com/what-does-brandishing-mean/,

  i 'm helping protect him . 
  any idea who owns the green-haired guy next to him ? 
  he is on your approved art list : https://www.reddit.com/r/greenlattice/comments/6331lf/this_is_now_the_official_approved_art_any_art, 
  update : aw thanks guys , he 's back to his former glory < 3, 
  that was truly awesome . 
  thanks admins , i had a fantastic time . 
  i hope you consider releasing the full dataset - i 'd love to see someone make an interactive time lapse !, 
  also fyi i 'd totally pay for a poster ... 
  you need a thru-axle to qr conversion kit . 
  you * could * have a machinist make them for you ( it 's a fairly straightforward part ) , but you can buy them off the shelf . 
  something like :, 
  http://www.chainreactioncycles.com/nukeproof-conversion-kit-15mm-to-qr/rp-prod80192 and http://www.chainreactioncycles.com/nukeproof-conversion-kit-qr-rear/rp-prod34779 assuming 15mm and 12mm is correct . 
  my ex once said to me `` i ca n't drink gin it makes me cry on the stairs '' . 
  she was n't lying . 
  that press release contains so much bullshit . 
  as if `` vibration '' is the reason people do n't use jigsaws ?!, 
  and wtf is the nonsense about changing the `` nomenclature '' from 10.8 v to 12v ?!, 
  you fuckers are just adding marketing wank !, 
  i ca n't believe i sat through all of that and he did n't cut it open . 
  yeah i think this is the bit of info i was missing ; i 'd seen road hubs were 130mm , so i assumed road disc hubs would be 130mm too , so was looking at mtb hubs . 
  this makes way more sense , thanks !, 
  okay this is making more sense now ( thanks to / u/tehwildman _ ) . 
  it seems my choices ( at least if sticking to shimano ) are limited to fairly pricey [ ultegra ] ( http://www.chainreactioncycles.com/shimano-ultegra-cx75-cl-disc-rear-road-hub/rp-prod155161 ) or off-group [ rs505 ] ( http://www.madison.co.uk/products/cycling/tyres-tubes-wheel-components/hubs/fh-rs505-freehub-for-centre-lock-disc-36-hole-q-r-135-mm-black/ ) . 
  any better recommendations ? 
   i do n't see how mtb vs road factors into the discussion, 
  because , as i understand it , 11spd mtb groupset will fit onto any 10spd mtb hub/freehub body , but the same is not true for a road groupset . 
  so i was looking at mtb hubs but seeing stuff that said i would n't be able to put a road groupset on it . 
  that 's a good shout , i 'll look into it , thanks . 
  ( although i do kinda fancy having a crack at building a wheel ) . 
  yes i agree that 's the sensible course of action . 
  i got myself tangled up assuming i was looking for a mtb hub and then things got confusing with road vs mtb groupsets . 
  now i know road-specific disc hubs are 135mm it 's all making a lot more sense . 
  thanks !, 
  my understanding is that everything 's different . 
  so you 'll need a new shifter because that 's where the indexing happens , the chain is different so you 'll need new chain rings ( and likely cranks and front mech ) , the cable pull is different so you need a new rear mech too . 
  that 's basically a complete new drivetrain . 
  you could also replace the stem with one that has more of an angle , or even ( if the stem is angled downwards ) simply flip it over . 
  actually looks pretty good . 
  check to see if it 's big enough for you ( ideally by riding it , but specialized probably have a size chart on their website ) . 
  otherwise i 'd say that 's a pretty reasonable choice . 
  i was sitting at a bus stop eating a [ scotch egg ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scotch_egg ) and a wild-haired older lady walked up to me and asked me if i was eating an egg . 
  i answered in the affirmative , and she asked if i had any salt . 
  to that i said no , and she proceeded to bellow `` an egg without salt is like a man without a mustache '' . 
  then she left to find me some salt . 
  fortunately , my bus turned up before she returned . 
  nice . 
  love the harmony at the end . 
  there 's an episode of elementary about weird programming languages ? 
  i 'd be surprised if a bike shop missed it , but the symptoms sound exactly like the chain is running the wrong side of the metal tab on the rear derailleur , causing it to scrape . 
  modern bikes are almost always hex bolts these days . . well , mine at least . 
  i can strip 90 % of it down with 3,4,5 mm hex wrenches . 
  knife wrench !, 
  ( y' know , for kids ), 
  woot canaw, 
  if you 're going to take care of it and use it regularly then i 'd pay the extra , if you can afford it . 
  the components are a little better so you 'll have fewer problems and they 'll last you a bit longer . 
  i agree it would be fairly easy to assume that 's what people want and make it do the right thing , particularly given the frequency with which people get that wrong . 
  however if they do that , then people will link to subreddits that way , and that would mean if they wanted to use any paths under / they 'd be breaking working links . 
  so i can see why they have n't . 
  having previously had a bike with an xt drivetrain , i * really * miss the clutch on my ( currently sora ) gravel bike . 
  if there was a simple way to get that back i would ( but as i understand it cable pulls make it impossible without buying weird shifters ) . 
  maybe it 's more than just the clutch , but now i get quite a bit of chain slap , occasional chain suck and unreliable shifting on any less-than-ideal surface . 
  yeah but that means some subreddits will work that way and some wo n't . 
  and worse , if they ever want to use any of those urls for anything , those links will change . 
  you want either a hybrid or an `` adventure road '' / gravel bike , depending on whether you want flat ( mtb style ) handlebars or drop ( road bike style ) handlebars . 
  there 's a wide range of both available from all the major manufacturers so you should be able to find one that suits you and your price point . 
  trek 's fx hybrids or giant 's revolt gravel bikes are a good place to start looking . 
  something like :, 
  select date_trunc ( ` day ' , timestamp ) , status , count ( * ) from some_table group by 1 , 2 order by 1 , 2 ;, 
  you could also use timestamp : : date to cast timestamp to a date without time , but i thought i 'd show date_trunc as it 's more flexible .
