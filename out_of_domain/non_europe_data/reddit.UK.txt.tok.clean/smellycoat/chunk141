  i.e. , more likely to protect their own and less likely to trust the authorities to deal with the problem without demonising the entire community . 
  sounds like you 've got it sorted , but shortening the cable housing should make it run at less of an angle . 
  i 've only done shimano hydraulic brakes ( which are oil rather than dot fluid ) , but i imagine it 's a similar process . 
  it is a tricky procedure , as has been noted , but it 's definitely achievable if you take your time and follow the instructions . 
  my advice is get extra olives , barbs and fluid in case you fuck up . 
  the olives and barbs are one-use items so you if you get something wrong you 'll need new ones , and they 're cheap and good to have on hand as spares anyway . 
  do n't cut your hoses too short , leave enough so you can cut them down and refit if you have to . 
  pay attention to torquing the compression nuts properly ( i assume hopes have those ) , easy to over or under torque and introduce a leak . 
  rate hate ? 
  for what you want , your basic choices are a road bike ( drop bars , fast , aggressive riding position , only really usable on decent roads ) , a hybrid ( flat bars , comfortable , upright riding position , usable on roads and rough roads/trails ) or a gravel/adventure bike ( somewhere in between , drop bars , more relaxed riding position , but usable on rough roads/trails ) . 
  most people start with a flat bar hybrid as they 're easy and comfortable , but you can do basically anything with it . 
  but if you 're up for drop bars , go try some out . 
  there 's a learning curve , but the comfort and flexibility is worth it . 
  one thing to note : your budget will get you either a mid range hybrid , or an entry level road/gravel bike . 
  road bike components ( which the gravel bike shares ) cost a bit more , so you do get more for your money with hybrids . 
  best bet is go to a bike shop and try some .

  life on earth - david attenborough 's 1979 wildlife series is * fantastic * . 
  the production values , while amazing for the time , do n't come close to today 's nature documentaries , and it 's a little inaccurate these days as our understanding has improved . 
  but it does something that most nature documentaries these days fail at : it tells the story of how life evolved on our planet , from the earliest microscopic organisms , all the way up to us , now . 
  and it does it without dumbing down the subject matter , avoiding the word `` evolution '' , or reducing itself to just showing short sequences of tenuously-linked dramatic footage to pander to short attention spans . 
  highly recommended . 
  if only we could weaponise autism ... 
  solved !, 
  thank you kind sir !, 
  i use an abus bordo folding lock ( the strongest they do ) . 
  it 's fairly convenient , at least compared to a u-lock or chain , as it bolts neatly to the bottle cage mounts . 
  but it 's heavy as fuck . 
  nowhere near as heavy as a comparable chain , about the same as a good u-lock . 
  but still noticeable . 
  the best lock in the world wo n't save you , though , it 's just a deterrent . 
  i 've had bikes stolen by someone cutting through the bike rack . 
  get insurance , or a bike you can afford to lose . 
  sales calls only happen because they work on * somebody * . 
  here in oxford , the council have been slowly widening or entirely removing those barriers , i can think of three that have been altered or removed in recent years . 
  alas , i do n't know their reasons , but it 's a welcome change for me . 
  you could ask them . . ? 
  yeah . 
  the barriers either end of [ this park ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/cavell+rd,+oxford+ox4+4as/@51.734847,-1.2374259,457m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x4876c130adcb6ad9:0x47a213d6ee94b9c!8m2!3d51.7347223!4d-1.2338502?hl=en ) have now been removed , both on the [ cavell road end ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@51.7346521,-1.2347069,3a,60y,258.8h,83.03t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1syj9du1he94d7ghvfrmatvg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?hl=en ) ( it 's still there in this pic , but it 's been removed in the last couple of months ) and [ meadow lane end ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@51.7347487,-1.2385294,3a,75y,118.83h,70.58t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s3byafcl-nwrusgblzgllww!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?hl=en ) ( that 's one is just hidden behind the hedge ) . 
  they 're either end of that track you can see running diagonally across the park . 
  one of the two barriers at each end of [ this footbridge ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@51.7459141,-1.2562501,3a,60y,251.27h,80.05t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1stpu-d5l19ahgnhfqvbk34w!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?hl=en ) ( [ before ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@51.7458972,-1.2562601,3a,75y,251.27h,80.05t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s0nslx84r2hrvdrbfqugtjg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?hl=en ) , [ after ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@51.7458969,-1.2562504,3a,75y,251.89h,83.33t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sc4_gzspf2g9jiym0skhikq!2e0!5s20150601t000000!7i13312!8i6656?hl=en ) ) just off [ folly bridge ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/maps/search/folly+bridge/@51.7451095,-1.2584585,17z/data=!3m1!4b1?hl=en ) has been removed , the other has been widened by a foot or so ( you can * just * see it [ here ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@51.7458969,-1.2562504,3a,15y,255.8h,84.66t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sc4_gzspf2g9jiym0skhikq!2e0!5s20150601t000000!7i13312!8i6656?hl=en ) ) . 
  the barrier at the entrance to the [ marston cyclepath ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@51.7593064,-1.2506657,3a,47.2y,53.55h,88.07t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sp7svnm6ekodi15gct1lxvg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?hl=en ) was widened some years ago ( you can see one of the bollards ) . 
  can take photos if you 're desperate , none of them are far out of my way . 
  hahaha 50gb . 
  my sweet summer child . 
  i do n't touch the gears while i 'm braking , i just brake and then press the clutch when the engine ' nearly idle ( to prevent a stall ) . 
  then , once stopped , change into first . 
  sometimes i 'll downshift if i think the lights might change while i 'm decelerating . 
  here in the uk we have supermarket own brands at lower price points , those use deliberately minimal or bland-looking packaging to try to steer those that can afford to spend money to the more expensive-looking packages . 
  i.e. , they can still make money at the low end of the market and the deliberately-crappy packaging helps prevent it eating too much into the money they were already making at the mid - or high price points . 
  the upshot of which is that i , as a uk consumer , see minimalist , simple branding as a sign of lower quality . 
  i 'm not saying that 's a good thing ( typically i love the minimal aesthetic ) , but that 's how i 've been trained as a consumer . 
  and likely why minimalism and simplicity has n't caught on in retail packaging like it has elsewhere . 
  remember the number plate , look it up on the [ dvla website ] ( https://vehicleenquiry.service.gov.uk/ ) and hope it 's untaxed or something . 
  of course , it 's pretty rare they 're actually doing anything wrong , but i have reported one ( bloke in a van nearly killed me trying to squeeze past before a pedestrian island ) who happened to be untaxed . 
  it felt so very good . 
  seriously , better than sex . 
  almost as good as tea . 
  for # 200 i 'd look second hand . 
  ideally you want something by a decent manufacturer ( giant , trek , dawes , specialized , cannondale . 
  here in the uk you 'll likely see a lot of boardman , pinnacle . 
  those are ok ) , and in good condition . 
  try looking at second hand bikes in a bike shop , at least then you know they 'll be in good nick . 
  buying new you need to spend more like # 350-400 to get something that manages to not be , yknow , really crappy . 
  good advice . 
  you can ride basically anything anywhere , so pick something you like . 
  maybe do some basic research ( as more specialised bikes like road bikes and mountain bikes are n't much fun outside of their intended terrain ) . 
  but otherwise , if you know what you want , get that . 
  except cheap front suspension , do n't get that . 
  does n't make much difference on rough terrain , and just makes your bike heavier and shittier and less fun * everywhere * else . 
  as far as i can tell it only exists because people who do n't ride mountain bikes think they suspension looks cool and want it on their going-to-the-shops bike . 
  fuck cheap front suspension ( my first real bike had cheap front suspension ) . 
  but a hybrid is a good default choice for someone who does n't really know what they want , as they 're a good general-purpose bike and can fairly cheaply be tailored to most conditions . 
  i think that 's probably the only chance i have at not being damned to eternity . 
  discs . 
  you 're right , of course . 
  i do yield , even ( especially ? ), 
  if a pedestrian suddenly appears in front of me without looking . 
  but it 's much funnier to do so by clamping down on my rear brake ( instead of the silent front brake ) and watch them flinch in fear for a moment . 
  tbh i 'm kidding . 
  this is completely tongue in cheek . 
  i did have a very noisy rear brake , which i tried not to use because of the noise . 
  the only times it happened were when i was emergency braking ( muscle memory kicks in and clamps on both levers ) , which has lead to a couple of unintended but amusing moments with startled pedestrians . 
  i made this post after i fixed the problem ( you can see in my history i replaced a leaking 785 caliper with an xt one from my bits box ) , and i realised i kinda missed the noisy brake . 
  noted . 
  thanks , 
  ah so * that 's * why people like noisy freewheels !, 
  what the fuck . 
  mine ( well , my neighbour 's , he lets me use it to store my bike ) hit a bit of wood when i was closing it and the cable got tangled . 
  i fiddled with it for ages ( realised the spring was pretty damn tight ) , but ended up wedging it with a screwdriver so i could untangle the cable . 
  you 're saying i coulda died doing that ? 
  [ point-in-time recovery ] ( https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/continuous-archiving.html ) has literally saved my entire company more than once , back before we had proper processes to control database changes . 
  for what it 's worth , for me , clicking/creaking cranks have always turned out to be the a problem with ( or insufficient lubrication in ) the interface between the pedals and the cranks . 
  hey at least people get out of the way , 
  what the fuck . 
  is he eating childrens ' souls to stay like that ? 
  they 're all useless cunts . 
  fucking unreliable overpriced bastards , lobbying the council to ban uber so they can avoid having to up their game . 
  i hope they all go out of business . 
  when they start doing mental stuff like taking deliberately weird routes i fire up a bike ride tracking app to record the route , start videoing and ask what they 're doing .
