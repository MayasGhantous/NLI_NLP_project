  eventually out of frustration i just jammed the hose through without even trying to line anything up , and it popped right out of the hole the other end . 
  first time . 
  your budget will stretch to a road bike , which are way better suited to pure road riding ... 
  go to a few bike shops and look at `` hybrid '' bikes . 
  test ride a few , pick one you like . 
  there 's so much price competition at that end of the market that as long as you stick to major manufacturers ( which is almost guaranteed if you find a decent bike shop ) , there really is n't all that much difference and it 's very difficult to go wrong . 
  your bike shop will most likely have at least a couple of good , reliable hybrids at that price point you can try . 
  the benefits of picking one you like from a small selection , and having a bike shop help you with sizing and choice will greatly outweigh the very minor price advantage you might get from buying one online . 
  for comfort , aside from finding a bike that fits you well , look for ones with big ( but not too knobbly ) tyres . 
  35mm or more , that 's probably the best thing you can do for comfort . 
  other things like maybe changing saddle or grips will become apparent when you ride them for a while . 
  suspension is fairly useless on bikes primarily intended for roads , and suspension at that price point will be pretty shitty , so i would n't bother with it . 
  lastly , you get what you pay for . 
  $ 500 is near the bottom of the range for `` decent bikes '' , much below it you get into bikes with too many compromises to be comfortable or reliable . 
  pick the one you like that you can afford , do n't try to cheap out too much !, 
  that 's shell code , but i 'm slightly proud your first though was perl . 
  i think . 
  i hate scratchy , crisp , noisy sheets , so i 've tried a lot of bedsheets looking ( apparently in vain ) for the perfect ones . 
  john lewis are good if you like crisp cotton percale sheets , but obviously quite pricey . 
  ikea would be my recommendation for decent-but-cheap sheets ( they 're also not too scratchy , which suits me ) . 
  you * can * just bend the links back as a short-medium term fix . 
  i recently did that to my 11s chain which i thought was toast , been working fine since . 
  i used a pliers with a rag to protect the chain , and worked slowly and gently to ease out the bend . 
  i imagine the chain is weaker , and i 've been carrying a chain tool and link in case of trouble , but it 's been going strong for a month or more now . 
  if the cable housing goes into the frame then yes , you should be fine , hydraulic hose is similar in diameter to cable housing ( you 'll have to look up model numbers for specific diameters if you 're concerned ) . 
  i did the same mech disc to hydraulic conversion on my bike , worked fine . 
  somehow the real alpaca looks more cartoonish ... 
  $ 10k to drive a sweet sports car around for a year is n't a * terrible * deal . . 
  ladders in half life are infinitely better than the `` press x to climb '' and uninterruptible scripted animation we * still * suffer through today . 
  the dew drop is * okay * . 
  since it 's been redone it 's lost a bit of character but at least the floors are n't sticky . 
  nothing special , but it 's inoffensive . 
  it 's fucking annoying . 
  literally tonight i tried to plug in an aux cord and realised i could n't without first finding an adaptor . 
  i gave up instead . 
  i carry the lightning plug headphones around but they do n't come with a case ( and do n't fit into the old iphone headphone case ) , and i ca n't plug them into my laptop for , e.g. , teleconferencing . 
  fucking annoying . 
  really really fucking annoying . 
  that was probably less than $ 400 new ... 
  if it 's in great condition and has new tyres as stated , then it 's not an awful price , but certainly not cheap . 
  so your argument is that it was only inferred and not explicitly stated that any of it would go to the nhs , and it 's not # 350m anyway ? 
  [ finish line wet lube ] ( http://www.finishlineusa.com/products/chain-lubricants/wet-lube ) is pretty much all i ever use . 
  i experimented with dry lube , but inevitably end up with a noisy , dry or even rusty chain unless i only cycle on the driest of dry days and clean and relube after every ride . 
  clean chain , degreaser then soap and water , let it dry thoroughly , apply lube heavily , leave as long as possible giving the pedals the occasional spin , and wipe down * thoroughly * before riding . 
  magdalen arms do a lovely lamb roast for minimum 4 people , not quite a traditional sunday roast though . 
  i do n't think anyone really expects that money to go to the nhs , those shouting about it now are just using it to give boris a hard time for repeating this [ provably false ] ( https://m.imgur.com/ycapvrt?r ) statistic . 
  which , to be honest , is boris 's own fault for doing it in the first place . 
  of all my weird interests , i never thought there 'd be any crossover between punk and fonts ... 
  good work man , that 's awesome . 
  love the backstory too . 
  why are cabinets so expensive ? 
  i need a new amp ( the one i have is 20 years old and pretty much knackered ) and i thought a separate amp and cabinet would be way more flexible . 
  but my god the cost !, 
  i was in the barbers the other day . 
  after giving my usual `` 2 side and back and make the top , yknow , shorter but kinda the same thanks mate ( mumble ) '' thing , an american bloke sat down in the seat next to me and gave an eloquent and seemingly well-researched three minute explanation of what he wanted . 
  the barber nodded and got to work . 
  i never knew . 
  i 'm so happy !, 
  i finally fixed the mystery clicking/creaking noises coming from my drivetrain . 
  it 's been driving me * insane * for over a year , and has taken two attempts at stripping and rebuilding everything , four trips to the local bike shop to enlist expert assistance , and a new bottom bracket ( i 'll admit that one was out of sheer desperation ) . 
  problem was , it did n't happen all the time . 
  it 'd take a mile or two of riding before it 'd start , and it rarely happened at all in cold weather ( but in warm weather it got ridiculously loud ) . 
  so the lbs had trouble identifying the problem . 
  i ended up having to go on a long ride to `` get it started '' , and drop it into the shop immediately afterwards . 
  they did at least hear it ( which was nice - i suspect they were beginning to think i was a bit crazy ) , but they could n't work out what it was before it stopped again . 
  in the end it turned out to be the right pedal . 
  there 's a gap between the thread and the end of the shaft , which prevented the grease on the threads from working up . 
  so there was a ( tiny ) dry area where the pedal 's shaft was making direct metal-on-metal contact with the crank . 
  the left one still had a layer of paint ( which seemed to be enough to prevent noise ) , but the right did n't . 
  i only found the problem after systematically working my way through all the moving parts , inspecting them like an obsessed crazy man , and taking it out for test-rides in-between . 
  i know this is a little bit of a pointless post , but i wanted to tell someone who might appreciate the mental anguish i 've been dealing with for the last year !, 
  for the sake of my sanity should something like this happen again , is there a sensible method for identifying these mystery noises ? 
  i 've got some stainless steel threaded rod ( m8 thread , so 8mm ) to cut . 
  i 'm told that a hacksaw wo n't work on stainless steel of that thickness . 
  what is the correct weapon , diyddit ? 
  [ markdown ] ( http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#em ) allows emphasis ( rendered as italics or bold ) to be applied with both \\* and \\ _ . 
  asterisks : \\* foo \\* =  * foo * and \\*\\* foo \\*\\* =  ** foo **, 
  underscores : \\ _ foo \\ _ =  _ foo _ and \\ _ \\ _ foo \\ _ \\ _ =  __ foo __, 
  although i do n't think i 've every seen anyone try to use asterisks and fail , a significant number of people * do * seem to have trouble when they 're trying to write text with underscores , not expecting them to be turned into formatting . 
  this happens a lot in programming-related subreddits , i also see it happen a fair bit when people paste in links without adding link text ( as underscores are pretty common in uris ) . 
  since i suspect the underscore syntax is less popular than the asterisk syntax , it kinda makes sense to return underscores back to being normal characters . 
  i 'm soon to be heading to reading for a stag do . 
  tradition dictates ( and i 'm not one to argue with tradition ) that such an even culminate with a visit to a `` gentleman 's club '' or some other such den of iniquity . 
  google suggests there are a number of places such as this in and around reading , the challenge now is deciding which is appropriate . 
  we 're looking for somewhere that 'll be happy to deal with a group of harmless-but-drunken 30-something idiots that is n't too seedy ( nobody wants to be unfaithful , or catch some horrific disease !, 
  ) , without being ridiculously expensive and ideally not too strict on the dress code . 
  i do know a few people in reading , but alas , it 's not the easiest of questions to ask . 
  so , good people of reading , i turn to you . 
  do you have any recommendations for me ? 
  my bike was stolen at the weekend from botley road . 
  despite being a piece of shit , i 'd put loads of work into it and loved that fucking thing . 
  i desperately want it back ( to the point where i 'd pay for it ) , but i realise that 's probably unlikely . 
  anyone got any ideas where stolen bikes are liable to end up ? 
  long shot , i know !, 
  seriously , los is no problem ( although i 'm admittedly not great at flying nose-in ) , but flying proper no-cheating fpv with this thing seems basically impossible !, 
  am i doing something wrong ? 
  been riding a hybrid with 28mm tyres , looking for something faster , and more comfortable on longer , mostly-road journeys . 
  i 'm thinking thinner tyres and drop bars . 
  road bike or cyclox bike would work fine - but i know nothing about them !, 
  i plan to make the hybrid my winter/commuting bike , so i 'm not massively bothered about places to install racks and mudguards ( though it wo n't hurt ) .
