  i do n't fancy the canti brakes i see on a lot of cyclox bikes ( had them before , found them to be a pain ) , and the bar-end shifters i see on some touringy things seem daft , not really up for those either . 
  discs or calipers and a standard brifter would work for me . 
  not interested in crazy gearing , tried my luck with hub gears , was n't a fan , old fashioned derailer for me . 
  major problem is that i destroy bikes . 
  i would imagine this one would be treated with more respect than the hybrid , but i do still ride them hard and do stupid things with them . 
  whatever i end up with i 'd like it to be as bulletproof as possible !, 
  i do n't mind building one myself from a frame + components if it comes to it ( or at the very least , i 'm not scared of making modifications ) . 
  any suggestions for a lard-proof drop bar frame would be great !, 
  denizens of aylesbury . 
  those of you that are actually paying attention to this subreddit , at least ( and jesus , you 're not filling me with confidence ) . 
  recommend me somewhere decent in town to take my lady friend on a date where we 're probably unlikely to get stabbed . 
  please ? 
  today ( okay not today , about 20 years ago . 
  i wrote this as a comment in another thread , but nobody read it . 
  or it was n't funny , one of the two . 
  so i thought i 'd give it a go here ) . 
  today ( ahem ) i was at a punk rock gig . 
  the damned . 
  but not in the heyday - their first single was released two years before i was born , so this was a reunion tour sometime in the late 90s when i was a young punk scrote , and all the rest of their fans ( save for myself and my idiot friends ) were old punk scrotes . 
  i recommend listening to [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhpdgrg9h1k ) while you read the rest . 
  it 'll help set the scene ( and is a fantastic tune ) . 
  the venue was changed at the last minute to an absolutely stunning club that was built in a modern-but-abandoned church . 
  modern by uk standards i mean , so probably built in the last few decades out of bricks , rather than hewn from stone many hundreds of years ago . 
  still , it had huge stained glass windows , a ridiculously high ceiling and inside were stadium seats going around an empty central dance floor . 
  it was stunning . 
  probably the most impressive gig venue i 've been to ever - and probably the one least in keeping with the band and its fans . 
  but i digress . 
  the clientele were , as you can imagine , quite menacing . 
  it was an all-day event , and there was plenty of booze so spirits were high , shall we say . 
  while everyone was mostly friendly , there were a few fights here and there . 
  being underage , 20 years younger than the average age of the audience , and fucking idiots , my friends and i were doing our best to keep our heads down , avoid getting beaten up , and continue being served alcohol . 
  we were watching one of the support acts , a fight broke out in the pit , and my friend got whacked in the face . 
  he wore glasses usually , but since it does n't seem sensible to strap pieces of glass to your eyes in such a potentially hostile environment , he 'd opted to wear his contacts instead . 
  back in the 90s , contacts were n't what they are now - his were small , solid discs that would * immediately * disappear behind his eye at the slightest provocation . 
  which is obviously what happened here . 
  we retreated to the toilets so he could sort himself out . 
  the toilet , it turned out , was almost as impressive as the rest of the building and was complete with its own almost-floor-to-ceiling window , the middle of which had a stained glass part . 
  alas , for the size of the venue , it was a woefully undersized toilet , consisting of two cubicles , two urinals and two sinks . 
  the rest of the room was totally full of by now rather drunk punks , all desperate to piss . 
  many had already decided that the sinks were fair game , and a few had started pissing on the floor . 
  the rest were ripping things off walls , kicking the bins , throwing things and generally being idiots . 
  my friend braved the stinky mass of people and found himself a mirror near the gap that used to be a hand dryer to repair his stupid broken eyes ( this happened a lot ) . 
  i , being generally quite excited and trying to avoid as much floor-piss as possible , leapt onto the small ( ~ 2 feet high ) bench in front of the window to entertain myself while he sorted himself out . 
  ( btw if at this point you 've run out of damned , try [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gc0och2q_zg ) . ), 
  i glanced over to my right without really thinking that was where the cubicles were and . . 
  locked eyes with the biggest , burliest , hairiest , studded-jacketiest , scary looking biker/punk/meatsack . 
  he was sitting on the throne in the process of crimping off , what i can only imagine from his reddened , sweat-dripping face , was a turd the size of my forearm . 
  i thought , as the realisation dawned that i was about to get the shit beaten out of me by a huge hairy bag of meat with an unwiped bumhole who by now was looking at me with a mixture of discomfort and shock . 
  `` how the fuck am i going to explain why i 'm standing up here looking over the cubicle walls ?! '' . 
  i looked over at the throng of people by the door , and decided i 'd never get out in time if i ran . 
  `` quick !, 
  come up with a reason why you 're up here ! '' . 
  i pleaded with myself to come up with some reason that would explain my actions , while the scary shitting meatbag 's expression slowly changed to anger . 
  `` i 'm at a punk rock gig ! '', 
  i thought . 
  `` in a church !, 
  vandalise something ! '' . 
  fantastic idea . 
  i might be saved . 
  so i thrust my fist out in front of me into . . the stained glass window . 
  and broke it . 
  ... and sliced a perfect gash out of the knuckle on my little finger . 
  y' know when you cut yourself it takes a while for your body to notice and start bleeding ? 
  well it turns out when you cut yourself on the knuckle and look at the wound , before the bleeding kicks in you can see your own tendons . 
  i was n't prepared for this . 
  i remember the panic setting in thinking `` that 's my tendon . 
  i 'm going to get beaten up and my tendon is exposed '' . 
  but fortunately , my body saved me . 
  by making me pass out . 
  i woke up a few seconds later , in a pool of my blood and other people 's piss . 
  my friend , angry poo man , and a number of drunk punk rock types standing over me . 
  i ended up going to hospital where i was given a rough bandage by the triage nurse after waiting a couple of hours , and sent on my way . 
  i went back to the venue and caught the end of the damned 's set , which was amazing . 
  we ran into the angry spiky pooing meatbag later in the evening . 
  he was n't pooing this time . 
  his name turned out to be dave , and he was actually quite nice . 
  he bought us a pint . 
  it was a fantastic gig , i basically bled everywhere all night , and turned up home covered in piss and blood , but otherwise fairly unscathed . 
  it was fun though . 
  you can still just about see the [ scar ] ( https://i.imgur.com/rbi6mht.jpg ) on my knuckle . 
  tl ; dr : watched a man pooing , punched a window as a distraction tactic , cut my hand and woke up covered in blood and piss . 
  got free beer . 
  so , i had a bike stolen several years ago . 
  it 's recently popped up on one of my saved searches on ebay . 
  it was a slightly unusual model , and i put some reasonably distinctive components on it , so i 'm sure it 's mine - but i ca n't prove it . 
  i have a proof of purchase for the bike ( and the non-standard components ) , but no frame number . 
  spoke to the police but they do n't seem particularly willing to assist . 
  what , if anything , can i do ?
