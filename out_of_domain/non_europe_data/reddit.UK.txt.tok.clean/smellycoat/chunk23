  i put them in the bathroom so i have something more interesting than shampoo bottles to read while i 'm taking a shit . 
  the switch from the imperial to metric system happened within the lifetime of many of us brits , so although metric is used pretty much exclusively in engineering , or anything official , many people still use imperial measurements casually . 
  milk is still thought of as being sold in pints and multiples thereof ( even though it strictly is n't ) , and beer is most definitely still sold in pints . 
  as you stated , height and weight are still generally thought of in imperial ( although for `` official '' uses , metric is used ) . 
  road signs still refer to miles , rather than kilometres , although metric measurements are used for most other things . 
  most people are expected to be ( and generally are ) able to understand measurements in both imperial and metric , at least casually . 
  it 's generally accepted that the young will use metric for almost everything ( including height and weight , excluding distance and speed on the roads ) , and older residents will use imperial . 
  i. . do n't have a strong opinion on gun control . 
  but it does seem to me that there 's something to it . 
  in the us , guns are pretty easy to get , and you have rampant gun crime . 
  here in the uk , getting a gun is much harder , and shootings are far less common . 
  seems to me that there 's got to be * some * correlation there . 
  enough , at least to my mind , to warrant * trying * a bit of gun control . . 
  if it does n't work , then fair play , at least you tried it . 
  if it * does * work , way less people randomly die . 
  okay , i 'm no expert , but as i understand it , you can go and purchase a gun of some description with little or no hassle . 
  is that correct ? 
  edit : okay , seem some states have restrictions , but from what i read , in most states anyone over 21 ( 18 in some states ) without a criminal record can buy a gun , if they 're prepared to wait 15 days ( although i understand there are loopholes that can avoid the waiting period ) . 
  that seems reasonably hassle-free to me . 
  edit ( again ) : my point still stands , i think . 
  it 's relatively easy to get guns . 
  `` 22,000 laws at the federal , state and local level '' ( whatever they may be ) do n't seem to be controlling access to guns , 
  ah yeah that 's basically what i discovered with a little bit of googling . 
  but with some actual detail - thanks , 
  you seem to know a bit about this . 
  would it be reasonable to say that , for most people , buying a gun is n't significantly harder than buying ( for instance ) a car ? 
  ah yes , good point . 
  celcius for any temperature , actually . 
  i do n't think i can recall anyone using farenheit here . 
  there 's a lot of knife crime right now , yeah . 
  i do n't think that means we have equivalent violent crime stats ( but with knives instead of guns ) , as the huge increase in stabbings is a recent thing , and gun laws have n't changed significantly here for years . 
  ( it 's more to do with the recent increase in youth crime in general - we 're having a bit of a problem with it at the moment ) . 
  though i 'm certainly willing to admit many of the stabbings would have been shootings if guns were more accessible . 
  i do see where you 're going with that argument ; if everyone else has a gun , i want one too . 
  they have guns * now * , why do i have to wait ? . 
  i can understand that . 
  but the real problem is n't that law-abiding folk * do n't * have easy access to guns - it 's that the criminals * do * ( and often by the same channels ) . 
  the `` give everyone guns '' solution clearly is n't working * that * well , as there 's still a lot of gun crime . 
  and you ca n't make it harder for criminals to get access to guns without restricting access for everyone . 
  as i said above , it seems to work perfectly well in other countries - effective gun control means fewer shootings . 
  okay , i 've mentioned the uk knife crime thing elsewhere . 
  we 're currently experiencing a spate of knife crime ( apparently it 's now `` cool '' to stab people ) , but that 's just a recent trend which our gun control laws predate by many years . 
  ( and i 'm sure there 'd be more gun crime here as well , if guns were easier to get ) . 
  hopefully it 'll change , maybe it wo n't . 
  on the subject of gun control in areas where there 's already significant gun crime - well , how easy is it to drive to a nearby state with more lax laws ? 
  ( honest question , i have no idea , but i 'm assuming it 's not * that * much trouble ) . 
  the case you mention of the city that mandates gun ownership is indeed interesting . 
  i do n't know enough ( or anything ) about it to comment . 
  wikipedia [ suggests ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kennesaw,_georgia#reports_of_resulting_burglary-rate_statistics ) that it 's not all that cut-and-dried ( but there is a ` neutrality ' warning on the page , so i do n't know how much to trust it ) . 
  regarding statistics , well , i did have a quick look , but decided it was way too much effort . 
  if you fancy digging some out , i 'll happily look at them , though , 
  the [ home office crime report ( warning : big-arse pdf link ) ] ( http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs09/hosb1109vol1.pdf ) clearly state * recorded * crime figures . 
  edit : it 's interesting you admit they 're low , though , 
  the bcs document i linked has separate statistics for reported , detected , and convicted crime . 
  so what * i 'm * saying is that you 're * talking bollocks * . 
  that is very interesting indeed , thanks . 
  i think you 're entirely correct , significant cultural influence on gun crime makes a lot of sense . 
  i do n't know enough about politics and culture in saudi arabia to comment , but i 'm perfectly happy to put japan 's wildly different stats down to the myriad cultural differences . 
  i do notice that of all the countries i would consider broadly `` culturally similar '' to the uk ; the us , ireland , canada , australia and new zealand , as well as many european countries - the us ( with it 's comparatively relaxed gun control laws ) has by far the highest murder rates . 
  though i completely take your point and agree that culture may very well have a larger effect on gun crime than gun control does , it * does * seem like those statistics support my assertion that effective gun control leads to less gun crime . 
  although i do admit that i 'm assuming ( based on a quick glance at the relevant wikipedia articles ) that the us 's gun control laws are the most relaxed of the lot . 
  `` asking regular people about what `` crimes they experienced '' '' is only part of the report , and that 's used to generate statistics about unreported crimes ( there 's a couple of chapters about it ) . 
  in addition , there are * also * official statistics for :, 
  * recorded crime - crimes ** reported to the police **, 
  * detection rates - roughly analogous to `` closed cases '', 
  * conviction rates - which you clearly understand already, 
  now , i 'm completely willing to believe that the home office publishes `` convicted crime '' stats while other countries publish `` reported crime '' , leading to artificially low gun crime figures . 
  but not until you find something to back that up that 's more convincing than `` lol bcs '' . 
  edit : are you talking about [ this ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/lawandorder/3222063/gun-crime-60pc-higher-than-official-figures.html ) ? 
  there was some minor drama last year because the home office figures only included incidents where `` guns are fired , used to `` pistol whip '' victims , or brandished as a threat . '' . 
  they do not count other incidents where , for example , an offender happens to be carrying a gun , or someone gets caught trafficking firearms . 
  ( although that does n't seem unreasonable to me ) . 
   i 'll also note that we have a much larger population , which may make a difference . 
  uh . . you subscribe to the [ `` bill o'reilly '' ] ( http://tpmtv.talkingpointsmemo.com/?id=3060320 ) school of mathematics ? 
   we 're also the least socialist of the nations you point out , which may also have something to do with it . 
  ... perhaps this is simply a side effect of the us 's hyper-competitive capitalist ideals . 
  you raise a good point here . 
  i spoke previously about the recent increase in knife crime in the uk - most of this is down youths becoming more and more violent , and adopting practices and behaviour more common to american inner-city gangs . 
  interestingly , it is often claimed that young people here ( particularly in poorer areas ) are turning to violence and crime as a means to acquire material possessions they deem as socially necessary . 
  it 's hard not to draw parallels with us gang culture . 
  \\* yeah that 's probably not what you mean ( at least i hope not !, 
  ) , but it 's just too good an opportunity to pass up , 
  i meant . . generally . 
  i may very well be wrong as this is based almost entirely on anecdotal evidence ( it 's not as if i make a habit of talking to schoolkids \\* ) . 
  though , i do know the current curriculum taught in schools mandate teaching metric measurements for height and weight . 
  it 's interesting that you do n't , mind . 
  is it just you ( something you picked up from your parents , perhaps ? ), 
  or do others of your age use imperial measurements for that stuff too ? 
  \\* not since the court order , at least, 
  ie4 was released in 1997 , and was probably the largest step forward for the engine . 
  ie4 introduced a huge new javascript api , and significant css support . 
  in fact , although it happened with little fanfare , ie4 was the browser that laid the groundwork for `` ajax '' ( even though it was implemented as an external library and not native until ie5 ) . 
  all the implementations that exist today are still ( at least superficially ) similar to that original design . 
  ie5 and 6 were n't as much of a change , and primarily focussed on improving standards compliance . 
  but it was ie4 that effectively wiped out netscape , mainly by virtue of shipping with win98 , and being included in a win95 service pack ( i believe , have n't checked the details ) . 
  i do n't know why you 're being so hostile . 
  the comments you 're responding to are perfectly reasonable ( and make an interesting point , imho ) . 
  it was very common for ns4 to be used throughout companies ( just as it 's still common today for companies to mandate shitty old browsers like ie6 ) , and , at the time , ie4 was a big step forward . 
  although now it 's hard to imagine , there was a time when ie was considered the most advanced browser you could find . 
   us style time and date,
