  imho , yes . 
  somewhere in season 4 . . 
  that 's a lot of datas, 
  records , dude . 
  records . 
  oh , shut the fuck up you whining bastard . 
  the content in / r/atheism is pretty much all `` let 's laugh at creationists ! '', 
  ( as has been discussed in there several times , most of the `` positive '' stuff ends up in / r/politics or / r/science , leaving atheism with all the let 's - mock-the-religious-idiots stuff ) . 
  that 's fine in its own subreddit , but may not be the message they want to send to everyone , and i can completely see why . 
  maybe you should look for ways to improve the content in the subreddit , rather than randomly spamming your outrage in unrelated places .

  that 's some fucked up shit , dude . 
  here , let me show you mine :, 
  in the uk , if i had a minor problem like that , i 'd pop down the doctors . 
  i can usually get an appointment the same day if i call in the morning ( they reserve some time for the purpose ) , otherwise will likely be a week or so ( less in the summer , usually , unless there 's been something on the news about some new random disease  ) . 
  once you get to the doc 's there 's usually a bit of a wait ( it 's better in the mornings - they have n't had enough time to run over schedule ) , but you can usually be in and out inside an hour without a problem . 
  if i get a prescription from the doctor , then i 'll have to pay # 6.50 per item ( regardless of what it is ) . 
  for people on lots of medication , there are `` prepay '' cards that offer significant savings ( you pay around # 30 for a card that provides free prescriptions for 3 months . 
  cheaper if you pay for a year ) . 
  if it 's * really * urgent , you can get a doctor or nurse to visit at any time ( there are 24-hour numbers ) , although they 'll often tell you to bugger off and phone during office hours if it 's for something non-urgent . 
  ( i 've used the service a couple of times . 
  most recently when i hurt my back and got some valium and painkillers delivered at 4am by a sleepy-but-otherwise-friendly nurse ) . 
  no charge for the visit or the drugs . 
  there 's also a ( free ) phone `` nhs direct '' phone line . 
  you call up , describe what you want to talk about to a call centre peon , and they 'll have a doctor or nurse call you back . 
  usually within an hour or so , but longer if you call at an odd time ( it 's 24 hour , but i suspect it 's less well-manned at night , understandably ) . 
  apparently , if you call about something very specific or obscure , they 'll try to find someone qualified to talk to you , although that 'll likely take longer . 
  a lot of the time they 'll only be able to say `` visit the doctor '' , as they ca n't really examine you . 
  but it 's a really useful service if you 're trying to self-diagnose or have some questions that you 're not sure are worth wasting the doc 's time . 
  hospital and accident and emergency ( ie , `` er '' ) visits are the same deal . 
  although unless you have something that requires * immediate * attention , you 'll probably have to wait a couple of hours ( longer if it 's a friday or saturday night and they 're busy patching up drunk people ) . 
  they triage petty quickly , and strictly treat people in order of priority - so if you 're not too bad , you will get stuck there while actually-sick people get seen first . 
  if you turned up to a&e with something really simple ( like a sore throat  ) , they 'll likely tell you to go home and call the doc in the morning . 
  for non-emergency surgery , the delays can be longer , several months in some cases ( and this is probably the biggest negative point i can raise about the nhs ) . 
  although they have been under a lot of pressure over the last few years to reduce the waiting times , so generally speaking you 'll have your op before it becomes a problem . 
  no charge for a&e visits , or surgery , or the drugs you get while you 're there . 
  if they give you a prescription , then you 'll have to pay the same # 6.50 / item . 
  to me , the us system seems rather . . barbaric and cold-hearted . 
  you 're a global cocking * superpower * for fuck 's sake !, 
  how are you not able to provide basic healthcare without bankrupting your citizens ?!, 
  why are you reduced to * crossing your fingers and hoping you do n't get sick * ?!, 
  i know you probably know all this already , and know all about what government healthcare is like . 
  but , you get to hear about it again , simply because it baffles me * so * much that your government ( and , more confusingly , your citizens ) are n't * screaming * for something like it . 
  you 're using 2-character indents ? 
  okay ( well , apart from making you evil ) , so , what happens if you press tab , then space , then delete ? 
  are you left with two spaces or one ? 
  i prefer the term [ foon ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foon ) , 
  ouch , i can see that being really irritating . 
  then i 've never liked things that mess about with what i 'm typing . 
  autocomplete is pure evil , for example . 
  i just about tolerate auto-indenting , but it still annoys me at times ( although * just * less than indenting manually ) .

  well , it 's the most useful intersection of the two . 
  significantly more `` spoon '' , and you ca n't stab things , more `` fork '' and you 'll have trouble eating anything approaching liquid . 
  but i like the term `` foon '' simply because it 's fun to say . 
  grapefruit spoons ? 
  would n't that be a [ spife ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spife ) ? 
  ( or , as that page also suggests , a `` knoon '' ) . 
   95 % of people will say that spork is more fun to say, 
  you 're probably correct , but i still like `` foon '' better . 
  i see . 
  i use tabs anywhere where i 'd need more than one space . 
  that includes alignment . 
  to be honest , i find tabs extremely useful for alignment , as it makes it easy to align even large runs of stuff to the same column . 
  most programmers ( at least in the field i have experience with ) use spaces to indent their code ( either manually or , more likely , have their editor configured so the tab key inserts a number of spaces ) . 
  tabs are considered problematic because systems often disagree on how the tabs should be rendered ( many text editors treat them as 4 characters , older systems [ and , notably , web browsers ] treat them as 8 - which is usually considered too wide for code indents ) . 
  it is n't `` politically incorrect '' at all . 
  it 's kind of a joke , in that respect . 
  but it is something that confuses ( and sometimes ` deeply offends ' ) others . 
  i hear `` ew , tabs ?!, 
  why ?! '', 
  a lot , to the point where i have some scripts to convert everything to spaces if i 'm handing code to others , or working on open source projects . 
  i * know * , right ? 
  it is good for that man . 
  i played for a bit , and got quite into trading , to the point where i set up a trading alt , gave it a small stake , and idly tried to make cash with it . 
  worked quite well , but i got kinda bored . 
  so i did n't use that character much , until i saw an opportunity to corner a small , emerging market . 
  i spent the weekend flying around buying up stock , and monitoring ( and playing ) the market , buying and selling from other players . 
  was quite exciting , and definitely an interesting experience with real-life parallels . 
  ended up making a fair chunk of cash ( not much in the grand scheme , but lots for a noob like me - about 3x my previous wealth ) . 
  eventually , ( after a week or so ) someone with * way * more capital than i sank a load of money into it and effectively bought me out of the market . 
  which is was quite happy with as it was getting hard work to stay on top of everything . 
  hmm , that 's a good point . 
  i recall seeing , in this order :, 
  * ` hey you can upvote everything on the page with this little chunk of js ! ', 
  ( followed by a minor karma love-in ), 
  * [ in / r/atheism ] ` hey someone 's going through the subreddit downvoting submissions and comments ' ( followed by some examples ), 
  * ` hey / r/atheism is n't on the front page anymore ' ( followed by the shit hitting the fan ), 
  did n't put that together until you mentioned it , 
  no i get that . 
  i mean , the downvoting is what kicked this whole saga off . 
  i 'm not trying to draw any conclusions ( apart from maybe `` i 'm a bit unobservant '' ) , just commenting on the fact that i saw all of those things happen in that order . 
  i have to say , although i * despise * `` q '' episodes in any of the treks , the ones in voyager are n't too bad . 
  what in the cunting fuck is that evil-looking device ?
