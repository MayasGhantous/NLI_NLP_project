  sounds a bit like [ aunt sally ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aunt_sally ), 
  that 's excellent . 
  i can only hope the poor dude doing the voiceover is simultaneously wondering where his dreams went and how the fuck he got himself into the position where describing a tool designed to remove a dead deer 's rectum was a good gig . 
  requiring variables to be defined with ` my ` is entirely ** optional ** . 
  the behaviour is switched on by the ` strict ' pragma ( that 's the ` use strict ; ` line you might see at the top of many perl programs ) . 
  you do n't have to use it if you do n't want to , but the simple fact that the perl community almost unanimously agrees that it 's a good thing suggests to me that it 's a useful feature . 
  js also makes a fine language for embedding into pretty much anything to provide user scripting . 
   edit : why did some one down vote me :(, 
  i do n't know , maybe someone feels strongly about the plight of the overpaid clueless hr manager . . 
  please take this upvote and orange envelope as compensation . 
  i do n't own a mac , nor do i know much about managing large numbers of windows boxes . 
  but considerably reduced risk of viruses , plus remote ssh access sounds pretty good to me . 
  they kept adding unnecessary features . 
  i 've seen entire intranet systems built with it , using outlook as an interface . 
  who the fuck needs that kind of functionality in a god damn email server ? 
  is that `` do n't feed the trolls '' ? 
  maybe there 's something to this bible thing . . 
  the fried jam sandwich . 
  not really midnight snack , i suppose , but i love it . 
  make a jam sandwich , butter on the outside of the bread , and fry it up like a grilled cheese . 
  serve with ice cream . 
  trust me , it 's * way * better than it sounds . 
  yeahman i 'm with you there . 
  here 's my favorite , if i have the ingredients :, 
  * port salut cheese ( just break it into lumps ), 
  * couple of thin slices of cheddar, 
  * sliced black olives, 
  * red onion, 
  * bit of pepper ( probably do n't need salt , the prosciutto can be pretty salty already ), 
  needs to be cooked a little more slowly than a normal grilled cheese , though . 
  but totally worth the effort . 
  edit : failing that , of course , any combination of ingredients that includes something resembling bread , butter and cheese will do fine , 
  way to not put really bad ideas into the dude 's head , 
  now with new keyboard controller !, 
  hmm . 
  i tried downloading it with ie6 , it says they 're donating the meals , but the download did n't start . . 
  good skills , ms. 
  i know this is borderline heresy , but i do n't think it needs bacon bits . 
  proscuitto is pretty damn tasty ( and plenty salty enough ) on its own . 
  slow startup is a reasonable objection to moose , there are situations where it 's just not viable , and i can understand ( although disagree with ) places that wo n't install anything that is n't in core . 
  but why is `` lots of dependencies '' a bad thing ? 
  are you manually vetting every bit of external code or something ? 
  `` i like turtles '' . . ? 
  oh that 's way more catchy . 
  when i was younger ( many years ago !, 
  ) , i spent a couple of summers working as a steward at music festivals . 
  i was at one of the more hippyish family-friendly events , standing outside one of the tents . 
  we 'd had to clear everyone out because the chap who was about to perform in there wanted to `` bless the stage '' first . 
  a procedure that apparently took about 10 minutes , but to do it he needed the tent to be empty - if he got disturbed , he 'd start again . 
  so there i was trying to keep people away , while dragging some metal barriers into place around the entrance i was manning ( as a slightly less subtle hint to stay the hell out ) . 
  anyway . 
  there was a hippy-ish-looking family sitting on the grass next to the entrance with a little kid . 
  i spotted him staring intently at me while i dragged barriers around and busted the occasional ageing hippy trying to sneak past my ( admittedly inadequate ) defences , and did n't think much of it . 
  until , after hauling a bit of fence into place , i turned around to see him standing directly in front of me . 
  without missing a beat he asked :, 
  him : `` what are you doing ? '', 
  where did you come from ?!, 
  him : < points at parents , 
  i 'm moving this barrier . '', 
  him : `` why ? '', 
  me : `` to make a fence '', 
  him : `` why ? '', 
  me : `` to stop people going inside the tent '', 
  him : `` why ? '', 
  me : `` because i was told to '', 
  him : `` why ? '', 
  . . at this point i thought i had a pretty good idea how this conversation was going to play out , and not having the patience to deal with a random kid whose new age parents had n't taught him the proper fear and respect for a sweaty , slightly pissed off bloke lugging large pieces of steel around . 
  me : ( wearily ) `` why what , young man ? '', 
  him : `` why were you told to keep people out ? '', 
  damn . 
  he 'd been paying attention . 
  i was unprepared for that . 
  me : `` because the chap who 's playing next asked us to clear the tent '', 
  him : `` why ? '', 
  me : `` because he wants to ` bless the stage ' before he goes on '', 
  him : `` why ? '', 
  me : ( thinking it was worth another go ) `` why what ? '', 
  him : `` why does he want to bless the stage ? '', 
  ( dammit ), 
  me : `` i do n't know . 
  his religion , i suppose '', 
  him : `` why ? '', 
  me : `` why does his religion mean he has to bless the stage ? '', 
  him : `` yeah . '', 
  me : `` that 's a complicated question . 
  i do n't know , religions often make use of ceremonies to strengthen their beliefs '', 
  him : `` why ? '', 
  me : `` why what ? '', 
  him : `` why do religious ceremonies help ? '', 
  me : `` i do n't know , really . 
  i suppose the ceremony helps them feel closer to their god '', 
  him : `` why ? '', 
  me : `` erm , because it 's something they can actively do that they believe their god wants . 
  it makes them feel happier , more content , i suppose '', 
  him : `` why ? '', 
  me : `` why what ? '', 
  him : `` why does religion make people happy ? '', 
  me : `` uh . 
  well . 
  i do n't know .
