  but , in the real world , where most people buy something mid-range , a combi boiler is way less hassle , saves space , energy , and just works !, 
  yeahman you 're bang on . 
  there 's some sativa in there though , pure indica strains ( at least , the ones i 've seen - not an expert ) have leaves that are wider nearer to the stem . 
  on-demand heaters specifically designed for one thing and one thing only ( eg , shower units that heat cold water ) work exactly like that . 
  what we 're talking about is a `` tankless '' water heater or `` combination boiler '' . 
  that is , one heater for the whole house serving showers , taps , and the central heating system . 
  the benefits of this over having smaller on-demand heaters are primarily efficiency and reduced installation cost/complexity . 
  different applications require different temperatures , and given that there 's no feedback from each appliance to the heater ( ie , it does n't know whether you 've turned on the shower or the kitchen tap ) , the most useful thing it can do is produce water at the highest temperature you 're likely to need ( modern ones allow you to set a hot water temperature ) , and allow each individual appliance mix it with cold to achieve the required temperature . 
  that does n't really seem like a `` design problem '' to me . 
  there are several downsides to what you 're suggesting :, 
  * different temperatures : what if two people want different temperature water ? 
  hot water systems are n't like networks , you do n't have a separate set of pipes for each tap . 
  even if the heater was capable of producing water at different temperatures , all it can do is send hot water out into the system - it ca n't send specific stuff to specific taps !, 
  * delays : when controlling temperature by mixing hot and cold water at ( for example ) a tap , you have near-instant feedback . 
  if you 're waiting for the heater to react then you have to wait until all the water in the system ( between the tap and the heater ) empties . 
  this could be several litres , meaning a delay of several seconds every time you adjust the temperature . 
  * complexity : the system , as it stands , is a very simple one . 
  you have a set of hot and a set of cold water pipes running to everywhere you need water . 
  you 're proposing adding an entire control layer to it , comprised of complicated ( and expensive ) networked devices to send signals back to a ( also networked ) water heater . 
  that ai n't gon na be easy to maintain , or be particularly cheap !, 
  * electricity : you 're talking about electrically powered devices ( which are n't really necessary ) at every place in the house where water is used . 
  apart from being potentially dangerous , in many countries ( certainly here in the uk ) , building codes mandate that electrical work near wet areas must be performed by a certified electrician . 
  also it 's worth noting that many heaters are capable of producing hot water even without any electricity . 
  what you 're proposing is a massive over-engineering of a relatively cheap , simple , reliable and effective system that has been in use for many , many years , all for what ? 
  so you can say you 've networked your boiler ? 
  or do you just want temperature displays on all your taps ? 
  there 's . . not much i can say to that . 
  i 'm sorry , dude . 
  edit : except this : fucking well done for telling someone , even if its just us . 
  what the fuck was * that * ? 
  * slayer - reign in blood, 
  ah , thanks for reminding me about that , i just put it on , 
  please take one upvote and completely superfluous comment with my compliments . 
  i ca n't listen to kmfdm any more without technoviking popping into my head . 
  and that 's not as much fun as it might sound . 
  is there any need to bugger about with partitions so much ? 
  just use dd to write the data directly onto the drive , then copy it off and decode it at the other end . 
  for absolute security , use a [ one-time pad ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/one-time_pad ) . 
  with a strong enough key , data encrypted in this manner is completely secure and indistinguishable from random data . 
  but , for this to work , the key needs to be at least as big as your data - you 'll need to find a way to get a potentially very large key to wherever you need to be . 
  this , of course , also means that , given the right key , it could also * decrypt * to anything . 
  for example , if forced to decrypt the data , you could provide a key that will decrypt the file to something completely innocuous . 
  might be a * little * over the top , though .

  daaanny baaaaker !, 
  that should work in ie and other browsers . 
  does n't alter the element , just dumps the password out next to it instead . 
  you risk breaking random event handlers and stuff if you start replacing elements . 
  i may be missing something , but why does that need to be more complicated than :, 
  do you have the file ` foo ` ? 
  box 2 : yes !, 
  here 's its ` md5sum ` , see !, 
  ah that 's a good point . 
  in that case , have the system doing the asking generate some random string and send it with the request . 
  then the system proving it has the file can do something like : ` md5 ( random_string + file_contents ) ` , which can be verified at both ends . 
  if marmite is the * main * ingredient in anything you eat , you 're doing it wrong .

  is it weird that i googled `` xkcd 619 '' , and ( unknowingly ) found my way back to this comments page to click your comment . 
  i do n't really do ben folds , but [ luckiest ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jwx11ambec ) nearly got me a coupla times . 
  how old are you ? 
  when the urge to break contact strikes , what reasoning do you use ?

  yeahman , particularly the keyboard that kicks in near the end . 
  i am also rather partial to [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoswosfytdw ) cover . 
  probably not to everyone 's taste ( ! ), 
  crossfire and sli are a nice idea , but in reality it 's rarely worth the hassle . 
  it makes sense if you 're buying bleeding-edge kit and the pokiest graphics card you can find is n't powerful enough . 
  but driver problems , and the speed with which graphics cards become obsolete means it rarely makes sense as a ` cheap ' option . 
  particularly if you plan to add a second card `` later '' . 
  yes , yes you have . 
  yeah , probably , but do n't forget that your motherboard is fairly permanent , and you 'll probably change the graphics card at least once . 
  but you 're paying for lots of features ( like crossfire ) you 're never likely to need . 
  my advice is to never scrimp on the motherboard , psu or the hdd you 'll have your os installed on . 
  everything else can be easily changed later ( arguably you can change your psu too , but you 'll never think to do it until * after * it pops and takes half your hardware with it  ) . 
  cpu selection is interesting and often depends on the state of the market . 
  at the moment i still think core2s are the best use of your funds , the extra cash you 'd drop on an i7 setup does n't buy you * that * much extra performance . 
  scrimp on :, 
  * ram : but only if prices are high at the moment , as they fluctuate a lot ( i have n't looked recently but i think ram is pretty cheap right now ) . 
  whatever you do start with 2gb at least . 
  * hdd : you do n't need a 2tb drive right now , for example . 
  get a good quality hdd for the system drive ( focus on quality * not * capacity ) . 
  adding a second hdd later is trivial ( and sensible , but it 's an easily-deferrable cost ) . 
  * graphics card : get whichever is best `` bang for buck '' right now . 
  do n't overpay , as whatever you buy will be obsolete quickly . 
  rather than paying , for example , $ 300 for a top-end one now , consider paying $ 150 for a mid-range and $ 150 again later to upgrade to another mid-range - the upgrade will likely be better than the $ 300 card you could buy now , and the mid-range card will be able to play all the current released reasonably well . 
  * cooling . 
  a decent-quality core2 cooler will set you back like $ 20 ( worth spending that money rather than relying on the bundled reference cooler ) . 
  throw in a case fan , maybe . 
  if you want to go crazy with expensive cooling systems , do it afterwards . 
  `` but you do n't want such a system ... '' is about as unsnarky as a snarky comment could possibly be . 
  i 'd say about a 0.3 on the colbert scale . 
  i 'm sure that 's not what he 's doing . 
  he made a comment that 's pretty fucking relevant ( given the usual reddit fare of pun threads and wild tangential discussions ) , which ties in nicely with some current affairs stuff that 's getting a lot of discussion here , and managed to make it vaguely amusing . 
  that 's more or less the perfect reddit comment right there . 
  well . 
  maybe it could do with more narwhal or a lod or something .
