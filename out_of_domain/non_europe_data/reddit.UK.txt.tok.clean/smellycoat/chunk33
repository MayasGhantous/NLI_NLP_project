  at least some unicode randomness . 
  soapier reference , possibly ? 
  a bel-air ? 
  but , i digress . 
  he made a comment . 
  you did n't like it for whatever reason . 
  it 's not as if anyone 's going to read it and think `` all the us redditors must not want govt healthcare '' , so stop your whining . 
  it 's a smoking jacket , i 'll have you know . 
  because it 's * awesome * . 
  it 's the same chords as [ lots of tunes ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1fq1p4mwlc#t=1m ), 
  [ what !, 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgc6yjkocxs ), 
  those * bastards *, 
  you 'll like it even more if you listen up to where it properly kicks in ( about 3 mins in ) . 
  i know that a tune not `` kicking in '' until three minutes in is n't helping my case that fleetwood mac do n't suck , but it 's worth it , 
  recently i have become quite partial to [ quake live ] ( http://www.quakelive.com ) . 
  i 'm terrible at it ( and other fpss like it ) , but somehow when i 'm stoned i acquire the ability to not completely suck . 
  but that [ breaks the internet ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrquwufmr_i ) !, 
  that shit is [ non trivial ] ( http://www.ex-parrot.com/~pdw/mail-rfc822-address.html ) !, 
  edit : not that i 'm condoning any of the daft bugs wp has had over the years , 
   for the most part , the support in #javascript on freenode is at the `` i 'm trying to figure out how to enter raw html in dreamweaver '' kind of level, 
  \\ #javascript on efnet ( irc.efnet.org ) is pretty good . 
  there 's some clued-up chaps in there ( and me ) . 
  but it 's very much a javascript channel , you 'll get a js answer rather than a jquery-or-whatever answer , 
  what i was getting at was that wp having a stupid email regex that does n't allow rare-but-acceptable things like apostrophes is indeed bad . 
  inexcusable , maybe . 
  but not accepting * any * rfc 2822 ( or even 822/3696 ) compliant address is n't really so bad ( in fact it 's often preferable to only accept a subset ) . 
  well , maybe . 
  you know what i mean !, 
  aye , this is kinda what i 'm [ saying ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/9iq5s/i_thought_the_wordpress_bug_that_led_to_the_worm/c0cxo6m ) . 
  validating an address against the rfc is n't all that useful in this context ( eg , ` postmaster ` is compliant , and usually deliverable , but rarely something you * want * ) . 
  a subset of the rfc is more useful . 
  that said , you can go a lot further than `` one ' @ ' and one ' . 
  ' '' , if only to eliminate common typos . 
  i just listened to [ my body is a cage ( arcade fire ) ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyp34v6lmcc ) . 
  80s drums and a fucking church organ - epic !, 
  documents like this ( and the drupal one ) are almost entirely pointless . 
  it 's unlikely to stand up in a court ( they ca n't simply wish fair use rights away ) . 
  at best , it 's their official guidelines for how they 'd * like * their trademarks to be used , written in an overly-legal manner . 
  you want a full list ?
