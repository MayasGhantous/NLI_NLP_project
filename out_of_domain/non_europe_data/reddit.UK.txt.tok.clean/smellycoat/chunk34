  is n't that the first room in portal ? 
  the whatnow ? 
  yeah it 's always baffled me why sun seems to think java should be a `` consumer-friendly '' brand . 
  there is no situation where it 's useful to give the user a splash screen advertising the fact that you wrote your program using java . 
  looks like his writing , though . 
  cosmetic surgery . 
  ( i mean the purely cosmetic kind on otherwise perfectly normal people , not the reconstructing-people 's - faces-after-car-accidents kind ) actually , i very much doubt it 'll be shunned , but i 'd like to think future-us will be a bit wiser than we are . 
  that 's a spicy metaball-a !, 
  tramadol is what they give you when you have a lot of pain , but they do n't want to hand out opiates . 
  i took it for a bit when my back was bad . 
  you can get high on it , but i did n't find it a lot of fun , plus a couple of times it made me feel sick , and ( even at prescribed doses ) it fucked with my bowels . 
  being slightly high for 8 hours but unable to squeeze out a poo is n't much fun . 
  see if you can get some diazepam as well , way more fun , 
  edit : but do n't take it a lot , you 'll get hooked . 
  that ai n't fun . 
  yes you 're bang on about diazapam and other benzodiazepines . 
  the op seems to be talking about using these drugs recreationally , so i was merely recommending it as something that 's got a bit more recreational value than tramadol , that he could likely get given his condition ( i had a similar thing , and managed to blag a few  ) . 
  i 'm totally in agreement regarding their addictive qualities , though . 
  but , fortunately , when prescribing for pain/sleep-related stuff the doc is unlikely to agree to long-term prescriptions . 
  hahaha !, 
  it 's just . . the notion that a mainstream pop/chart band on a major label has any say over what happens to their song . . is amusing . 
  watch it anyway . 
  seriously . 
  it 's * extremely * good . 
  i like [ these ] ( http://www.paperstone.co.uk/images/large/104465.jpg ) . 
  bic disposable automatic pencils . 
  0.7 mm lead ( the 0.5 ones are n't so good ) . 
  i love them . 
  they 're getting harder to find ( they seem to be pushing the 0.5 mm ones instead - cheaper to produce , i imagine ) , but every so often i manage to stumble on somewhere that sells them . 
  my favourite pens are [ papermate flexgrip ] ( http://images.ryman.co.uk/images/large/08202540.jpg ) ( although in blue , not black ) - it writes like an upscale version of the classic bic biro . 
  also [ pilot g-2 ] ( http://www.pilotpen.co.uk/products/pens/blg207.jpg ) are very good . 
  they have gel ink , which i 'm not entirely sold on ( some pens with this type of ink can be scratchy ) , but they 're nice to write with . 
  really ? 
  last time i went hunting for them i tried half a dozen shops - all had the 0.5 mm , but no 0.7 mm . 
  eventually i found a handful of 10-packs hiding at the bottom of a clearance bin ( so now i 've got like 50  ) . 
  hmm , i 've tried proper automatic pencils , but have n't ever found one i like . 
  they 're either too fat , or not comfortable to hold ( i tend to hold pens and pencils very close to the tip , so the long metal tubes for the lead does n't work so well for me ) . 
  0.3 mm lead will be waaaay too thin . 
  0.5 mm is too thin for me , my handwriting is terrible and i tend to draw and write things far too small . 
  the thicker lead helps avoid that a bit . 
  things comment karma does well :, 
  * keeps trolls under their bridges ( or at least forces them to be creative ), 
  * penalises contentless `` lol !, 
  '' , `` first '' and `` me too '' posts . 
  there are actually very few of these on reddit ( if you disagree , go spend some time on a popular forum ), 
  * ensures a decent comment ( although often not the best ) makes its way to the top, 
  things it does badly :, 
  * rewards karma-whore replies to the top post ( often the first comment thread dominates the discussion ), 
  * rewards those who get there first ( mediocre comments with 100 + upvotes , purely because they got in relatively quickly ), 
  * promotes opinions that most already agree with ( which are arguably less useful than controversial or interesting points ), 
  * disproportionately penalises comments that one or more people may not agree with ( a single well-timed downvote is often enough to relegate a comment to the `` bottom of the pile '' , where it 'll be read by significantly fewer people - plus a score of 0 often leads to more downvotes ), 
  in my opinion , the worst thing here is the karma-whoring replies to the popular comments . 
  quite regularly i find a reasonably decent comment at the top , followed by a page of mostly-useless karma-whoring nonsense , followed by a pun thread , then a pile of other comments , some very good , but often neglected . 
  aye i know about that , but thanks man . 
  problem with that is it 's not really putting controversial comments at the top . 
  it 's putting comments that have had both up - and down-votes at the top . 
  which ai n't the same thing , 
  is `` crunk '' good or bad ? 
  batter that shit up , motherfucker !, 
  [ spam fritters !, 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spam_fritter ), 
  that 's kinda cool , but i ca n't see it being actually * useful * . 
  well , there 's [ this ( pdf ) ] ( http://refcards.com/docs/forda/catalyst/catalyst-refcard-a4.pdf ) , but it 's kinda old . 
  it does n't cover chained actions , and probably a coupla other things . 
  ( chained actions are covered nicely [ here ] ( http://search.cpan.org/~mramberg/catalyst-runtime-5.80012/lib/catalyst/dispatchtype/chained.pm ) ) . 
  [ catalyst : : manual : : cookbook ] ( http://search.cpan.org/~hkclark/catalyst-manual-5.8000/lib/catalyst/manual/cookbook.pod ) is absolutely worth a look , as well , as is the rest of [ catalyst : : manual ] ( http://search.cpan.org/~hkclark/catalyst-manual-5.8000/ ) . 
  the [ wiki ] ( http://dev.catalyst.perl.org/wiki/ ) is chock-full of interesting stuff , too . 
  the [ definitive guide ] ( http://www.amazon.com/definitive-guide-catalyst-maintainable-applications/dp/1430223650?&amp;camp=2486&amp;linkcode=wey&amp;tag=enligperlorga-21&amp;creative=8882 ) ( [ uk ] ( http://www.amazon.co.uk/definitive-guide-catalyst-maintainable-applications/dp/1430223650?&amp;camp=2486&amp;linkcode=wey&amp;tag=enligperlorga-21&amp;creative=8882 ) ) ( that 's an [ epo ] ( http://www.enlightenedperl.org/ ) affil link , not mine ) is actually a very good book , with some great examples for newbies and tons of handy snippets for those with more experience . 
  day to day , the only references i use a lot are [ catalyst : : request ] ( http://search.cpan.org/~mramberg/catalyst-runtime-5.80012/lib/catalyst/request.pm ) and [ catalyst : : response ] ( http://search.cpan.org/~mramberg/catalyst-runtime-5.80012/lib/catalyst/response.pm ) . 
  oh , and , lurking in the irc channel ( irc.perl.org , #catalyst ) is very helpful . 
  but , i 'm afraid i do n't know of any other cheat-sheets . 
  i hope that 's helpful anyway , man . 
  spolsky is a complete bellend , and i 'd rarely take his advice . 
  but ( like his new bumchum jeff atwood ) his writing * does * tend to provoke thought on a subject i 'd otherwise ignore . 
  same with everything that gets bought out by some faceless corporate suits . 
  it 'll stay decent for a while ( usually while the founders still work there ) . 
  but will eventually be destroyed , the founders and actually-good staff will slowly leave , competition will spring up , it 'll stagnate . 
  the owners will start hunting around for ways to `` monetise '' , and users will begin to suffer . 
  and that 's just the common case . 
  worst case , they 'll try to `` integrate '' it with other things , and end up with something horribly broken . 
  best they can do is leave the guys that run the thing the hell alone to get on with it , and try not to interfere too much . 
  put off the inevitable destruction-by-committee for as long as possible . 
  ( yes , i 'm aware reddit is now owned by `` faceless corporate suits '' . 
  it 'll happen , it 's just a matter of time ! ), 
  you 're on the right track with organising things into objects . 
  i go a step further and wrap stuff up as a closure , eg :, 
  var myapp = ( function ( ) {, 
  / / some public and private values, 
  var somepublicvar = true ;, 
  var someprivatevar = true ;, 
  / / a prototype, 
  var thing = function ( foo ) {, 
  this.foo = foo, 
  thing.prototype.dostuff = function ( ) { . . }, 
  / / provide public accessors for some stuff, 
  return {, 
  somepublicvar : somepublicvar ,, 
  modifyprivatevar : function ( value ) {, 
  someprivatevar = value, 
  thing : thing,
