  i was leaning on the wall , the panic was rising in my chest . 
  i had no idea what the fuck was going on by this point , only that something was terribly wrong . 
  i knew my parents would be asleep in the next room , so i tried to shout to them . 
  i could n't catch my breath , and could n't speak , let alone shout . 
  i managed a strained grunt , but fell to the floor in the process . 
  i tried to bang on the door , or the floor , or anything i could reach , but my arms were weak . 
  i managed to get the door open a bit and tried to drag myself outside . 
  it was still pitch black and i could n't see a thing . 
  tried to pull myself up to stand , but lost my footing , slipped on the wooden tread at the top of the stairs outside my bedroom . 
  i felt the sickening lump in my stomach as my body fell . 
  i was trying to brace myself for impact , but my limbs were loose and would n't respond . 
  i had no idea what was going on , my body was n't working properly , and i knew in a fraction of a second my head would make contact with the wooden stairs . 
  then i woke up in bed . 
  do n't fret it man , just smoke using whichever method you enjoy most . 
  it 's about getting high , not showing off your lung capacity , 
  the bbc did a great [ programme ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00kfqps ) that covered this . 
  plus it was presented by alice roberts , who 's fucking fit . 
  i have no idea . 
  scared the fucking shit out of me , is all i can tell you . 
  not being able to speak is a recurring theme that happens to me in my dreams frequently , just before i wake up . 
  i can ` engage ' my vocal cords , but i ca n't open my mouth or push air out any faster than normal breathing . 
  horrible , horrible feeling . 
  a good strategy would be to say `` no '' , 
  that actually sounds pretty close . 
  i get the odd lucid dream too ( at least , i think that 's what they are ) . 
  my sleeping patterns are pretty irregular , and weird stuff happens every so often . 
  the most disturbing were huge ` explosion ' sounds ( almost sounds `` digital '' , like an explosion sound effect in a game on an 8bit computer ) coming from inside my head as i was trying to fall asleep , very fucking strange . 
  glad that shit stopped ! . 
  it 's not really a big problem , other than being a little disconcerting at the time . 
  and i 'm not really sure what i can do about it , other than not having stupid sleeping patterns !, 
  apparently i have !, 
  i posted this [ elsewhere ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/9m4p7/whats_the_worst_way_youve_ever_been_woken_up_from/c0dcjov ) . 
   i once woke up with a horrible feeling of foreboding . 
  like the feeling you get when you wake from a nightmare . 
  i tried to switch on the light , it did n't work . 
   i stumbled out of bed to try to switch on the main light switch in the room . 
  it was completely black , i was n't properly awake yet but panicking , so my legs were n't working very well . 
  finally made it to the light switch , fumbled with it ( my fingers were n't cooperating ) and eventually flicked it . 
  it would n't work either . 
   at this point my legs were starting to give way , and my head was spinning . 
  i could n't see where i was and did n't want to fall . 
  i was leaning on the wall , the panic was rising in my chest . 
  i had no idea what the fuck was going on by this point , only that something was terribly wrong . 
  i knew my parents would be asleep in the next room , so i tried to shout to them .

  i had no idea what was going on , my body was n't working properly , and i knew in a fraction of a second my head would make contact with the wooden stairs . 
   then i woke up in bed . 
  i like small fonts . 
  [ profont ] ( http://www.tobiasjung.net/profont/index.html ) is what i use pretty much anywhere a monospace font is called for ( terminals , text editors , etc ) . 
  [ envy code r ] ( http://damieng.com/blog/2008/05/26/envy-code-r-preview-7-coding-font-released ) is also pretty good for larger text . 
  [ inconsolata ] ( http://www.levien.com/type/myfonts/inconsolata.html ) is nice for larger text , too , but i find the underscore is a pixel too high ( and it really bugs me ), 
  boss ? 
  i really do n't have a problem with big women . 
  i do n't have a weird fetish or anything , it 's just more that weight is n't really important when assessing attractiveness . 
  for me , personality is by far the most important thing ( i find girls that are fun to be around instantly more attractive ) . 
  looking back over all the various girls i 've found appealing , some have been skinny , some bigger , some short , some tall . 
  all have been fun . 
  it saddens me that there are so many people out there who are stuck on this ideal skinny body shape . 
  i really hope you find someone who likes you and has the balls to see past your weight . 
  there 's a limit , of course , but `` fat '' does n't mean `` unhealthy '' . 
  there 's plenty of healthy fat people , and plenty of unhealthy skinny people . 
  fuck , why did n't you say ? 
  coke is possibly the worst thing you could do right now . 
  everything will be * great * , for 15 minutes , and then you get to hate the world for the rest of the day . 
  twat . 
  if they 're still around , then it 's a really fucking niche market . 
  i 've encountered a few applets in the last couple of years , but never anything i 've actually * needed * . 
  just because there are some random companies out there relying on them , does n't mean they ai n't dead , 
  hell , i worked with a company the other month that still relied on foxpro . 
  the dos version . 
  so 's your face, 
  is n't that what they 're for ? 
  perl too , if you ` use utf8 ; ` in your source file . 
  you can even do [ this ] ( http://search.cpan.org/~ewilhelm/lambda-v0.0.1/lib/lambda.pm ) :, 
  my $ code = \u03bb { ... } ;, 
  * fuck * no . 
  but that 's just me . 
  in my opinion , one of the primary concerns when developing the * syntax * of your language is to promote best practices as much as possible , and allowing anything other than 7-bit ascii in your source files is probably asking for trouble . 
  it certainly raises the bar for what editors you can use , and allowing unicode function names , etc does n't really help significantly . 
  if a language supports something , people will use it , regardless of whether it 's a good idea or not ( see the huge quantity of god-awful php or perl4-style cgi scripts out there ) . 
  best practices come later . 
  so the more you can promote this from the start , the better . 
  python has bought into philosophy , and i think it 's been successful . 
  certainly all the python i 've worked with has been at least readable . 
  tests give you balls . 
  a good test suite gives you the confidence to :, 
  * add shiny new features without breaking old things, 
  * make big , sweeping changes while maintaining your existing functionality, 
  * refactor that nasty old code into something new and sexy without altering the interface, 
  * forget about that old bug , safe in the knowledge that it 'll be caught if it sneaks back in, 
  * use that swanky new technique you heard about - and be sure you 've done it right, 
  but most importantly , tests give you the balls to go home at 6pm and forget about everything . 
  you know it works because you 've tested the hell out of it .
