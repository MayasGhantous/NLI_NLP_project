  seems to work :, 
  copyright notices do fucking nothing . 
  since the [ berne convention ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/berne_convention_for_the_protection_of_literary_and_artistic_works ) , copyright is automatic . 
  you do n't need a smarmy , obnoxious `` copyright 2009 some arrogant fuckend '' notice at the bottom of every page for it to be protected . 
  they keep remastering beatles albums because people keep buying remastered beatles albums . 
  nowhere in this process does the music actually matter . 
  it barely matters . 
  today , she 's some record company shill . 
  chances are she signed some kind of deal that included doing this . 
  or maybe a deal that allowed the record company to use her name for this kinda stuff . 
  ( or , maybe they 're doing it without her knowledge , it 's not beyond them . . ), 
  i honestly doubt very much she gives two shits about it . 
  although that interview suggests that her record company is screwing her out of cd sale revenue . . 
  tf does n't have `` hidden defects '' , bazillions of people play it every day with no problems . 
  sounds like your virus-ridden obscure-porn-filled computer is the problem here ... 
  fucking stupid hippies . 
  how do they matter ? 
  they certainly do n't matter legally . 
  having the date there is n't proof of anything , so is n't useful for anything . 
  stating something is copyrighted is completely unnecessary - copyright is automatic , regardless of the presence of a notice . 
  the only point i 'll concede is it may be useful for people trying to track down the copyright owner , if it 's not otherwise obvious . 
  my ideal mp3 player would be :, 
  * small, 
  * an interface that consists of a list of artists/albums/playlists / tracks and very little else , maybe some playlist management . 
  * some kind of input device that does n't require repeatedly clicking the same damn button for 10 minutes ( a mousewheel-on-the-side type affair would be fine ), 
  * sd card slot ( small ones are fine ), 
  * decent-sized screen ( at least a dozen lines of text ) , and ideally a backlit black + white - why waste money and battery power on a pointless colour screen that switches off every 3 seconds ? 
  * not require anything other than usb mass storage drivers to put music on it or charge it, 
  * a standard mini-usb socket so when i inevitably ruin the cable i can actually replace it, 
  * a standard 3.5 mm headphone socket, 
  * maybe some means to attach a remote, 
  * * separate * volume control buttons , reusing the next/prev buttons ai n't good enough . 
  ideally on the top ( or wherever the headphone socket is ) so i can change the volume with the thing in my pocket . 
  * a casing that can stand up to a * bit * of abuse without looking like it 's been stored in a paint can shaker, 
  * ridiculously long battery life , and preferably a removable ( screws are okay ) battery i can actually buy somewhere that is n't from hong kong via ebay, 
  * no unnecessary features , no photos , no touchscreen , no video playing ability , no camera , no speaker , no bluetooth , no wifi , no web browser , no calendar , no alarms , no games . 
  * maybe * a clock . 
  have n't found anything like that yet , though . 
  my problem is not that media players have their own volume controls , it 's that web browsers , etc * do n't *, 
  there 's three ( long ! ), 
  dvds worth of kevin smith doing basically this stuff ( `` an evening with kevin smith '' ) . 
  definitely worth tracking down . 
  yeahman i 've learnt this lesson many times over , and will probably have to go through it all again a few times before it really sinks in . 
  onto a book ? 
  absolutely this . 
  building shit yourself is great :d, 
  just got it this morning . 
  i have n't found anything really good yet , but i was slightly disconcerted that `` anal probe '' worked ( i 'd just summoned an `` alien '' , it seemed fitting ) . 
  edit : `` virgin '' is pretty good . 
  spawns what looks like a teenage boy with a gamepad t-shirt . 
   also i do n't have the game with me to test , but when you type in a phrase it does n't recognize , it tries just looking at the last word, 
  yeah , i know . 
  but , shh , you 're spoiling the magic , 
  working fine for me . 
  not that i advise pirating it . 
  i * did * try to buy it ( i promise ! ), 
  but it 's not out for a couple of weeks in the uk . 
  so i spent the money on a flash cart instead . 
  i consider it `` their own stupid fault '' . 
  where the hell did you get the idea that ms do anything `` early and often '' ? 
  and `` why ship a feature nobody is ever going to use '' ?!, 
  shipping new features nobody gives a fuck about ( along with format changes to force you to upgrade just so you can open other people 's stuff ) is pretty much their entire business model !, 
  i was with you right up to this :, 
   good programming is [ ... ] a completely different dimension, 
  it really is n't . 
  good programming is simply knowing when to bust out the big fancy tools and when something simple will do . 
  of course , getting to that point takes several years of experience and a little bit of a talent . 
  but there 's no magic to it . 
  good ones smell like bacon and weed . 
  edit : and ones that read reddit smell like orangered . 
  what massive , massive cunts . 
  you could probably do a fucking good job of it by just finding a geeky-looking programming intern deferring all decisions to them . . 
  in fact , if you did that , you 'd likely be doing a far better job than 80 % of the companies out there . 
  oh man , you 'd be surprised how many programmers are incapable of simple tasks . 
  many years ago i wrote half a dozen tasks , that i 've given to all our candidates as `` homework '' , to send in when they 're done . 
  it 's * absolutely * the best thing we 've done for our hiring practices , and i 've learnt several things :, 
  * most people * ca n't write code *, 
  * claimed work experience on a resume * means nothing *, 
  * looking at 100 lines of someone 's code can tell you a * lot *, 
  * i suck at interviewing, 
  i 've come to the conclusion that it 's virtually impossible to predict who will be good and who wo n't from a resume . 
  it 's extremely hard to do that in an interview ( my predictions are usually way off ) , so you 've got no chance from looking at a carefully-manicured piece of paper . 
  i 've taken to completely ignoring resumes and just sending tests to everyone who applies . 
  that means interviews are much simpler , and i can focus on three things :, 
  * do they understand complicated concepts that ca n't be tested in a 20-line script, 
  * did they actually write the test code themselves ( do they understand what it 's doing and why ), 
  * are they crazy, 
  that last one is more of an issue that you might imagine , but it 's a different story for another day , 
  edit : i ca n't count, 
   i read nearly all the post in that article and i do n't think anyone really figures out why it 's a bad idea to ask programmers to program . 
  because it 's the job . 
  if you were interviewing a magician , you 'd ask them to show you a trick , right ? 
  you 're interviewing a programmer , so asking them to write a program is not only acceptable , it 's verging on incompetence to do otherwise . 
  added to that , it 's * completely * true that most people turning up for programming jobs * ca n't code * . 
  * at all * . 
  and it 's very hard to guess whether they can based on their answers to questions . 
  a simple test like this works wonderfully as a `` stupid-filter '' . 
   why not ask them how they would solve a problem ( bug , defect or enhancement ) that your company just completed . 
  it could be any part of it . 
  debugging , gathering requirements , subversion , coding , algorithm , etc. . .
