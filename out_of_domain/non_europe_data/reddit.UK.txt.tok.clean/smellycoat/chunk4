  that way she 's not in a position that will make her vagina open up as you were experiencing , and ( more importantly ) she can control the depth of penetration . 
  many women love to be laid on their back and fucked hard , but very few will want that until they are very aroused . 
  i do n't know why people still make action movies since die hard , the holy grail has been achieved . 
  the wire . 
  it is , quite simply , the best thing that has ever been on television . 
  every single person i have recommended it to ( those who actually bothered watching it , at least ) has told me how much they love it . 
  the only downside is that it will make all other tv shows look fake and unrealistic in comparison . 
  i have a toy facehugger ( and a headcrab ) . 
  best gift ever , 
  it is kinda slow to get going , and you do need to be in the right mindset and pay attention when you start watching it for it to grab you ( if you 're watching it in the background while doing something else you 'll never get into it ) . . 
  but you should really be hooked after 3-5 eps , if not before . 
  the first series properly kicks off about half way through , but the appeal ( for me , and for most of the people i 've spoken to ) is in the characters , their development and interactions more than the plot . 
  i was happy . 
  the orange box was still a great deal even for tf2 , portal and hl2 : ep2, 
  hehe , upvoted for clay . 
  but i prefer [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ycawhr3oeg ), 
  spaced is incredibly good , highly recommended !, 
  nah it gets good . 
  it 's kinda different , so takes a bit of getting into , but still extremely good . 
  stick with it . 
  my favorites include :, 
  the ** `` ham nicer-than-it-should-be '' ** :, 
  * sliced pickled beetroot, 
  works best on a buttered , toasted , still-warm ( english ) muffin . 
  i suspect a bagel would be good too . 
  the ** `` entire contents of the fridge '' ** sandwich :, 
  ( important that it 's vaguely stacked in this order ), 
  * mayonnaisse, 
  * thinly sliced beef, 
  * sliced ( sweet ) pickled gerkhins, 
  * creamed horseradish, 
  * sliced tomato, 
  * sprinkling of crushed chili, 
  * very thinly sliced red pepper, 
  * sliced olives ( black , ideally ), 
  * sliced ( sweet ) pickled beetroot, 
  * salt and pepper, 
  best served on a nice seeded granary bread . 
  slice it thick , this one needs a lot of structural integrity , 
  the ** `` swanky grilled-cheese '' ** :, 
  * sliced cheddar cheese, 
  * some lumps of random soft cheese ( mild brie is good , i prefer port salut , though ), 
  * slice of proscuito/parma ham/some salty, 
  thin meat ( bacon does n't work as well as you 'd imagine ), 
  * sliced red onion, 
  * sliced olives ( black , ideally , but if your meat is n't very strongly-flavoured , try green olives ), 
  * black pepper ( ideally freshly ground , but whatever ), 
  chuck that lot between some thick slices of white bread , butter on the * outside * , fry it up on a low heat ( it should sizzle , but you do n't want it to burn ) for about 5 mins on each side . 
  make sure the cheese is nicely melted before you eat it . 
  there 's something about the way you constructed that sentance that something in my head decided meant you were referring to disembodied nipples . 
  maybe a bunch of them tied together with string . 
  the alternatives are :, 
  these are useless for writing a code editor , i tried . 
  * browser extensions . 
  this is just going to limit the possible reach of the code . 
  not a bad idea , but it sounds like they 're going to for something that will work anywhere . 
  * contenteditable documents . 
  there 's just too much existing cruft to work around for this to work reliably . 
  i tried , 
  because you 're making hashes ( the things grouped by { } ) , and the order of hashes ca n't be guaranteed . 
  if you gain a thrill specifically from the death of another living thing , then yes , you may very well be a psychopath . 
  that 's actually rather good for a code font . 
  coupla problems : the underscore character is a pixel-or-so too high , at 8pt the lowercase `` s '' , '' + '' and the `` 0 '' characters do n't look great . 
  other than that , not too bad . 
  do n't know if it 's going to make me give up my beloved profont , but i 'll give it a try . 
  nice find , 
  dude , those videos of random circuit bent keyboards are ace . 
  marvellously evil sounds , i approve . 
  ( and you look like a girl ) . 
  i can totally see why she has requested that . 
  if someone did something like that to me i 'd want to kill them slowly and painfully . 
  which is why it just should n't be allowed . 
  hey , i have one of those kicking around doing nothing . 
  absolute pain in the arse to put an os on it though without a network card or optical drive . . 
  i worked in a warehouse for a few years . 
  i was kinda left to get on with it . 
  hard work and lots of hours ( was really a three-person job ) . 
  initially they paid me for the extra hours i had to work to keep everything organised , which was nice . 
  i was proud of my well-run warehouse , they were happy , everything was going smoothly . 
  they kept trying to weasel their way out of paying the overtime , saying they could n't afford it ( which was a blatant lie ) . 
  initially i tried to find other ways to cut down on the overtime i was claiming , cutting out pointless processes , recommending changes , etc ( most of which just got me in trouble ) eventually they stopped paying overtime entirely , by which time i was rather demoralised and looking for work elsewhere . 
  then they started forcing me to work late to do all the pointless stuff they wanted me to do . 
  by this point i really could n't give a fuck about them or their shitty warehouse . 
  every night ( after some fiddling with the stock control database ) i 'd box up a shitload of random interesting-looking stuff , put a random friend 's address on it , and left it for the courier in the morning . 
  went on for about a year . 
  eventually i got bored and quit . 
  i heard from some people who worked there that they hired one , then two , then three people to replace me . 
  so that 's how greedy management drove a happy , productive and loyal employee to steal from them and potentially cost them thousands . 
  my friends and i got a lot of nice stuff out of it though . 
  fuck them , they 'll sure as hell fuck you if they get the chance . 
  yeah , memory is very likely the biggest problem . 
  particularly on a laptop where the drive tends to be slow , and integrated graphics cards often chew up a chunk of it . 
  also , run a vacuum on ff 's several sqlite databases : http://weblog.savanne.be/153-performance-tip-of-the-day, 
  but chucking in more memory is cheap and will definitely give you a nice performance boost . 
  one warning : do n't underestimate the effects of an audience on your ability to , uh , y' know , bust out a stiffy . 
  seriously . 
  me , now . 
  tahoma ( like verdana and georgia ) is a screen font . 
  it has a very large x-height making lowercase characters considerably larger than a normal font . 
  this makes it easier to read on a low resolution device ( such as a monitor ) but lacks the polish of a proper font when displayed at a high resolution ( eg , printed ) .
