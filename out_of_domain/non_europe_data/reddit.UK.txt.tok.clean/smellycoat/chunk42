   that is the crucial part , which over time almost completely overpowers any random factors in the process . 
  that * is * the crucial part , that ensures that the processes of evolution moves a species forward , that forces problems to be solved and obstacles to be overcome . 
  but it is chance that dictates the * direction * of that progress , or , rather , the * method * by which problems are overcome . 
  it provides the `` creative '' force . 
  most of the time , these random mutations are most definitely bad , but occasionally one appears that confers an advantage , and natural selection means those advantageous genes are more likely to be passed on . 
  it 's like shaking flour through a sieve . 
  you know the flour will pass through the sieve , but there 's no way to tell which grain will pass through which hole , that is down to chance . 
   if you randomly select a number between 1 and 50 , a hundred times , is it a `` random chance '' that 42 was one of them ? 
  not the best example ( i know !, 
  this , coming from the guy who just made a flour-and-sieve analogy ! ) . 
  you can calculate the probability of that happening , and test it several times . 
  test it enough ( and in ideal enough conditions ) and you 'll * probably * end up with results that match your numbers . 
  does n't mean chance is n't a factor , because 42 is never guaranteed to appear no matter how many tests you perform . 
  this objection to the word `` random '' when associated with the processes of evolution is an interesting thing . 
  is it a reaction to the intelligent design types who say daft things like `` so we just popped into existence by chance then ? 
  nooooooo !, 
  do n't waste two shells on that !, 
  i get the feeling we might be arguing two sides of the same idea . 
  but anyway . 
  i 'm not saying that this process is necessarily a `` long shot '' ( although i 'm sure there are several evolutionary turns that have been the result of unlikely events or mutations ) . 
  all i 'm saying is that it 's driven entirely by chance . 
  by that i mean , if you rewind evolutionary progress over the last x bajillion years , and let it have a do-over , you have * no idea * what 's going to happen . 
  i 'm not even arguing that life appearing is unlikely . 
  i can not begin to comprehend the scope of this question , so all i * can * with some degree of confidence is ; life appearing * here and now * , and in the form it 's currently in is * extremely * unlikely . 
  but i agree that it 's perfectly possible that the chances of life appearing * anywhere * in the universe may very well be good . 
  have a read of [ this ] ( http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn14094-bacteria-make-major-evolutionary-shift-in-the-lab.html ) , which illustrates what i 'm getting at perfectly . 
  particularly this bit :, 
   [ t ] he experiment stands as proof that evolution does not always lead to the best possible outcome . 
  instead , a chance event can sometimes open evolutionary doors for one population that remain forever closed to other populations with different histories . 
  the * whole * system relies on chance . 
  random mutation multiplied by random chance , all kept in check by natural selection . 
  if you are considering getting a replacement camera , * do not * get the same model , or even a superficially-similar model , otherwise you 're going to find it hard to claim it 's yours . 
  just get whatever you 'd buy if you were buying a camera ( it will be , after all , yours ) . 
  and make sure you take it home with you at the end of each day , and treat it exactly as you would your own personal camera . 
  because that 's what it is . 
  i find that a few minutes in a pint of water is good enough . 
  rinsing more does n't appear to have a noticeable effect . 
  related : if you 're starting with hot water , ( white ) rice takes * exactly * 9 minutes to cook , take it off and drain it regardless of how done it seems , and you 'll have perfectly done rice . 
  except my cock . 
  do n't forget to have a heart attack shortly afterwards !, 
  you seem to be arguing that , with detailed enough measurements , nothing is random . 
  while you might be right about that , i do n't see how it 's a useful argument . 
  and you want me to agree that dna mutation is `` arbitrary '' rather than `` random '' ? 
  is it a helpful distinction ? 
  the chances of us being here , now , in the form we 're in , and having a mostly pointless argument on reddit are * infinitesimally * small . 
  but as i 've discussed with others elsewhere , i 'm happy to agree that the chances of life occurring * somewhere * in this mindbendingly large universe may very well be far higher . 
  how high , i have no clue . 
  but dna mutation is still random , 
  that 's just abusing the people that give up their time to help you , man . 
  listen to them , you might learn something . 
  if you 're asking questions about complicated stuff , and actually know what you 're doing , then it 's down to prison rules . 
  identify the leader , walk up to him , and smack him right in the face ... with a well-reasoned and ( most importantly ) correct analysis of why his suggestions are wrong . 
  only then will you gain their respect . 
  [ forks ] ( http://search.cpan.org/~rybskej/forks-0.33/lib/forks.pm ) seems pretty interesting for anything you might want to use threads for . 
  have n't had a chance to try it properly yet , though . 
  just so we 're clear , you 're arguing that dna mutations should be described as `` arbitrary '' , and not `` random '' ? 
  i still disagree , man . 
  mutations happen randomly . 
  there 's no reason behind them . 
  the only situation where i 'd agree they 're `` arbitrary '' but not `` random '' is if you were trying to argue that `` nothing is random '' . 
  which , if you can take detailed enough measurements , is * probably * true . 
  but also a reasonably useless distinction . 
  dude , i was done with this argument long ago . 
  and you 're still wrong . 
  you really want to get back into this ? 
  is it too much to ask to [ link directly to the damn article ] ( http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2009/oct/07/royal-mail-amazon-postal-strikes ) ? 
  * old-school safety razor ( the kind that takes emo-blades ), 
  * router ( the spinning power-tool kind , not the network kind . 
  though i have a handful of those too ), 
  * 600w hps lamp ... 
  `` spank '' ?!, 
  with a cricket bat ? 
  someone 's gon na break a leg !, 
  absolutely no telling if that 's real or not . 
  but i 'd definitely like to believe it was a justified rant , rather than a typical hollywood prima-donna toy-throwing . 
  meters in html5 ( for those that do n't know ) have :, 
  * value, 
  * min, 
  * max, 
  * high, 
  * low, 
  * optimum, 
  this is a tricky one , as there are n't any native ui widgets that i know that do this ( at least not ones most people will be familiar with , or agree upon ) . 
  so whatever gets chosen is likely to cause problems for a while until they enter the ` collective conciousness ' . 
  another problem that i can see is the lack of styling options . 
  since it 's a single element , if you want to make it look different , chances are you 're going to have to replace it with something else . 
  so it probably needs to be pretty simple , and as lowest-common-denominator as possible , 
  ( does anyone know if we 'll have more css to work with other than background-color , color , and border-color ? ), 
  my initial reaction is that it should look similar to a progress bar ( and the example rendering in the spec is just that ) , but the last three attributes present some problems with that ( how the hell we 're going to show high and low sections , and an optimum marker without being able to specify colours , i do not know ), 
  okay had a little play . 
  but it 's not easy to produce something that :, 
  * will scale down to 1px height and very small width, 
  * does n't use colours that ca n't be controlled via css, 
  * does n't look visually confusing, 
  [ here 's what i cobbled together ] ( http://imgur.com/6i1y0.png ) using all the optional stuff it supports . 
  it 's not great ( and yeah i know the colours are horrible - more for identifying the bits than looking nice  ) , but i could kinda see it working . 
  maybe . 
  big problem i have is that in order to support the `` high '' and `` low '' options , you really have to use an indicator bar rather than a more familiar progress-bar style thing . 
  this reduces the usability somewhat ( as it means the actual * information * is in a 1-2px line . 
  hardly ideal . ) .
