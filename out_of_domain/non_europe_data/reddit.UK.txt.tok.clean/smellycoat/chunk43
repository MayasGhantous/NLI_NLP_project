  i wonder if there 's a case for using the progress bar style for meters without high and low ? 
  i mean , there 's no telling if that surveillance video is real or not ( it is , after all , one unidentifiable bloke getting mugged by two other unidentifiable blokes ) . 
  from the ` rant ' video , it 's pretty clear that he actually got mugged , and assuming that 's what happened , the whole thing seems pretty justified . 
  mine is worn from approximately `` b '' to just past `` m '' . 
  so , from the centre , to the right hand side . 
  and i 'm right handed . 
  having paid attention to my typing for the last couple of sentences , it seems i use my right thumb almost exclusively to press the space bar . 
  yeah , that 's the ideal case for a meter with just a value ( and optionally min/max ) , but i ca n't see a sensible way for it to look similar to that with the high/low/optimal stuff enabled . 
  which means having something that looks significantly different ( eg , using a marker as in my example above , rather than the `` progress bar style '' ) as soon as you add high/low . 
  that means if ( for example ) you have a big list of meters , some with high/low , they 'll look messy . 
  the only alternative is not using the progress-bar style at all ( eg bar-and-marker or something similar ) , so the whole style of the thing does n't change when you enable optional stuff . 
  but that means relegating the important information to a tiny line as in my example above . 
  it actually works a * little * better if you embrace the `` dashboard '' style for the marker ( [ example ] ( http://imgur.com/bff5g.png ) ) , but i do n't like that very much , as introducing something other than perpendicular lines will limit its usefulness at low resolutions , date rather rapidly , and probably polarise the designery types somewhat . 
  dude , i just meant there 's no telling where that surveillance vid came from . 
  there 's no source on gawker or the youtube page that i can see , so it could easily be some random idiot labelling it as that `` for teh lulz '' . 
  and it 's not like that never happens , 
  i got no issues with seth green , and that rant was amusing , but ( given it was about being mugged ) has never seemed particularly unjustified to me . 
  up on blocks . 
  as in `` are you up on blocks this weekend ? '', 
  ( [ this ] ( http://www2.zhome.com:81/zcmnl/pics/jackupcar/all_four_blocks.jpg ) might help ), 
  it 's a * far * better shave , and does n't destroy my skin nearly as much as one of those multi-bladed horrors . 
  but it takes * much * longer to do it well , has a significant learning curve , and there 's more scope for doing yourself damage if you 're not careful . 
  but shaving with a safety razor is ( despite the name ) an extremely manly thing to do . 
  afterwards , you can go chop down trees with your cock , 
  crikey , this argument again ? 
  look , if you can take accurate enough measurements , and are geeky enough to actually bother testing * every single little variable * , i agree that ** nothing ** is random . 
  i get that . 
  i do . 
  i got it when the last dude explained it to me slowly in words-of-one-syllable-or-less . 
  and i still get it now you feel the need to explain it to me again . 
  my point is simply this :, 
  ** it does n't fucking matter **, 
  in the context of random dna mutations ( which is what we were actually talking about here ) , for all intents and purposes , the mutations ** are ** completely , unpredictably random !, 
  so until until it 's actually useful to make that distinction , ( and maybe until ` / dev/random ` is renamed ` / dev/arbitrary ` ) i 'm going to keep saying `` random dna mutations '' . 
  begin your downvoting , pedantic redditors . 
  he 's released a ton of records , most of which are actually pretty good . 
  just because you have n't heard them , does n't mean it did n't happen , 
  he 's got himself a solid fanbase , and he 's one of the few artists of his notoriety who has made an effort to actually engage with his fans , rather than just milking them for everything possible . 
  i do n't listen to the dude 's music much these days , but i 've never lost respect for the man . 
  every time i see her it makes me wonder how the fuck he managed it . 
  i mean , i love the dude 's political mind , but he looks like a fucking gremlin . 
  edit : interesting ; according to the [ json ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/9seph/thanks_reddit_kucinich/c0e7s2v ) , this comment has been upvoted 13 times and downvoted 13 times . 
  have i found the fabled reddit equilibrium comment ? 
  a comment that people care enough about to vote on , but are exactly split on whether to up - or down-vote it . 
  this is a great day for science !, 
  who knows what power i could unleash if this energy is harnessed !, 
  fair play to her . 
  but , i mean , there 's a limit , surely ? 
  double . . stat ? 
  you 're saying she has a gremlin fetish ? 
  i think it 's more likely she 's with him in spite of his garden-gnome like appearance , rather than because of it , 
  i have no questions . 
  and i realise this comment is entirely useless and will get lost at the bottom of the comments thread never to be seen again . 
  but i just wanted to say thanks . 
  so , thanks . 
  you do a great job , 
  if you eat weed , it 's really really hard to control the dosage . 
  smoking it is a * far * better introduction . 
  feedback on the amount you 're taking is almost immediate so it 's much easier to control . 
  it 's definitely worth a try . 
  i have had similar motivation/interest problems to you pretty much all my life , and i find it really helps . 
  the ability to alter the way your brain works , even if only temporarily , can be enough to pull me out of a rut . 
  edit : you probably want to try weed or something before venturing into the world of psychedelics like lsd , 
  nothing else clears your mind and makes you feel so alive . 
  or sometimes , dead . 
  the [ recorded version ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ktsxhxmkja ) of holiday in cambodia is reasonably well produced . 
  for a dead kennedy 's tune , at least . 
  i have a uk ip . 
  this does n't work for shit . 
  i assume they fixed it or something ? 
  alien , by a long way . 
  stormfront ? 
  what the fuck are you doing there ? 
  you might be better off saying `` whatever the ` truthers ' say , it does n't diminish the gravity of what you experienced '' , and then go take your truthing elsewhere . . 
  yeah , but that 's not * nearly * as much fun . 
  holy shit , really ? 
  \\ [ citation needed \\ ], 
  shit . 
  i almost without fail use an explicit ` scalar ( ) ` when i want to evaluate an array ( or a random list-returning-thing ) in scalar context . 
  to omit it can often lead to assignments that `` look wrong '' , which ( for me at least ) is worse than having an unnecessary keyword . 
  this means i write `` baby perl '' ? 
  quite simply , ` my $ bar = @foo ; ` just looks like a possible error , which means i 'm immediately suspicious , and have to work out what ` $ foo ` is being used for to convince myself it 's correct . 
  ` my $ foo_count = @foo ; ` is better , but not always possible . 
  and still makes me slightly nervous . 
  there 's a fan in the base that forces air out through gaps all the way around the ring . 
  this supposedly drags more air along with it . 
  absolutely . 
  but sometimes ( often ? ), 
  what you 're getting out is n't ( just ) a count of the number of elements in an array , and to name it as such may render something else harder to understand . 
  there are also many situations where there is no variable name that can be used to indicate intent . 
  for example :, 
  if ( @ { $ foo -  { things } } = = 3 ) {, 
  and, 
  my $ log_line = ` foos : ' . 
  for me , both of those would benefit from explicit ` scalar ( ) ` s ( i 'm usually happy with ` if ( @foo = = 3 ) ` , though ) . 
  but i can see why you might disagree . 
  ( i actually recall fixing a bug a couple of years back where something along the lines of ` print ` foos : ' . 
  @foo ; ` was changed to ` print ` foos : ' , @foo ; ` by someone . 
  that 's subtle enough for me to be a bit more liberal with the ` scalar ( ) ` s than maybe i should be . ), 
  i 'm with you on explicit variable names , though .
