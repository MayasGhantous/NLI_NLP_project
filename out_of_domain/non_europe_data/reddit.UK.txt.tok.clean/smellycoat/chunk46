  but if i never had to deal with broken-arse dates with missing timezones and shit again , i 'd happily put up with darkness at lunchtime , 
  there comes a point in every man 's life ( when he 's haphazardly stumbled his way through enough lisp ) that the distinctions between code and data start to blur to the point where they become very nearly meaningless . 
  okay , so , it 's # 800 for an extra 4gb straight from apple , right ? 
  [ # 229.99 ( inc vat ) for a compatible 4gb stick ] ( http://www.crucial.com/uk/store/listparts.aspx?model=imac%203.06ghz%20intel%20core%202%20duo%20%2824-inch%20-%20ddr3%29%20mb420ll/a ) at crucial.com . 
  even getting the full 8gigs ( as a 2x4gb kit ) is only # 459.99 . 
  so that 's a hefty markup apple are making there by anyone 's maths . 
  edit :, 
   has anyone actually gone online to another fucking computer site and seen how much 4gb dimms at that rating cost ? 
  well , you sure as fuck did n't . 
  not at all . 
  but not everywhere uses daylight savings time , and everywhere that does does n't necessarily use the same dst boundaries . 
  so without knowing * where * the timestamp was generated ( or in what timezone ) , it 's verging on impossible to determine exactly * when * it 's referring to . 
  even if you can infer the likely local timezone , if the timestamp does n't specify it ( or the offset from utc ) , you * still * have problems if it lies within a dst boundary . 
  and that 's if you can actually work out the date format in the first place . 
  sometimes even * that * is impossible ( eg , what exactly is ` 01/02/03 ` referring to ? 
  heh , when i got up this morning , i had the cnet article about ms 's exploitable ff extension open from last night ( or whatever site it was that was on the reddit front page yesterday ) . . with the blocked extension popup in front of it , 
  good work , mozilla . 
  [ paedophile ] ( http://dictionary.cambridge.org/define.asp?key=57031&amp;dict=cald ), 
   do you agree that atheism automatically precludes any belief in the paranormal ? 
  nope . 
  other way around . 
  i do n't believe in a god because i do n't believe in the `` paranormal '' . 
  and i do n't believe that because , quite simply , i have n't ever seen enough evidence to convince me . 
  we have our fair share of rabid witch-hunter types over here too , 
  i suspect there 's a good chance that a sequel will be terrible . 
  the actors are all quite a bit older now , and the story did n't seem to leave a lot of room for a sequel . 
  but i 'm definitely willing to take the risk . 
  but coincidentally , something nobody ever did again . . 
  fun fact !, 
  [ the feederz ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/feederz ) produced an album with [ sandpaper on the cover ] ( http://blogs.phoenixnewtimes.com/uponsun/feederz_everfeellike.jpg ) so it would `` eventually destroy records placed next to it '' . 
   i agree with your different date formats rant , really is there a reason they 're all different ? 
  well , the three ( numeric ) formats i 've seen used are y/m/d , d/m/y and m/d/y ( there 's all manner of other formats , but they 're often distinguishable ) . 
  d/m/y seems to make sense for humans reading and writing dates , i suppose . 
  the important information is first , so it 's easy to distinguish dates as the first digit ( that 's a total guess , btw ) . 
  y/m/d is good for computers , because it sorts properly ( even if it 's encoded as ascii , and the underlying system does n't know it 's a date ), 
  i just do n't know where m/d/y came from . 
  it 's an evil , evil date format that 's often indistinguishable from d/m/y . 
  i suppose from the american tendency to say `` october 18th '' as opposed to `` 18th of october '' ( which is what we generally say here in the uk ) . 
  experimenting with drugs is probably fine and to be expected for a teenager . 
  but there are some drugs that are very easy to get hooked on , so you should probably talk to her if only to make sure she 's not dabbling with smack , meth , crack etc. 
  put it back , then tell her you found it , and that it 's cool . 
  see if you can find out what and how much she 's taking . 
  open dialogue beats punishment any day . 
  build youself a nice little javascript editing widget thing \\* . 
  something akin to excel 's interface . 
  tab skips to next field , enter to next record . 
  taking away the borders around the text boxes and replacing them with a single line border ( kinda like the difference between a table with and without ` border-collapse : collapse ` ) will help it look less busy , and you can stick field labels at the top of each column , which should save a bit of space . 
  be sure to charge her for the extra js work , though , 
  \\* i suppose you * could * reuse an existing one , but where 's the fun in that ? 
  i 'd pay for one of those right now . 
  my feet are fucking freezing . 
  that 's really quite cool and useful . 
  i was all excited until i got to this :, 
   ... internet explorer 7.0 or later ( unfortunately , only on vista ), 
  i tried to invoke the `` lifetime guarantee '' on my 3-year-old eastpak rucksack ( all the lining came off and it had started splitting along the seams ) . 
  the fuckers would n't have any of it . 
  first they were all `` not without proof of purchase '' ( it 's a lifetime guarantee , who cares when i bought it ? ) . 
  then when i pushed it and sent proof of purchase along with some pics they said that they would n't be held responsible for defective material , only `` manufacturing defects '' ( so the lining coming loose was n't their fault ) . 
  but the pics i sent included two split seams ( which , by the excuses they sent me , would be considered a manufacturing defect ) , they claimed that was `` obvious misuse '' and would n't talk to me any more . 
  for me it kinda is about punishment . 
  not someone 's random blog that has some text ads on it , or sites like reddit that are reasonably ethical about their ads . 
  it 's the big-name big-budget sites that shoehorn in ridiculous quantities of advertising , popups , floating flash things , novelty animated ads , etc. 
  newpaper websites are the worst . 
  i 'm happy to look at the odd advert in exchange for a bit of content . 
  but what do we get ? 
  a page that 's 70 % flashing , blinking , scrolling ads , and `` content '' that equates to three paragraphs of badly-researched text and no pictures . 
  then there 's stuff like hotmail , and whatever they 're calling the im client these days . 
  you 're desperate for me to use your services ( to the point where you wo n't even let me uninstall the damn ad-bannered im client ) , but you do n't want me to block ads ? 
  fuck you . 
  so for them it 's definitely punishment . 
  just a shame that the small sites who actually put in some effort and do n't get too greedy also suffer . 
  ( i do try to support those , though ) . 
  yeah , but the weaselly language they used suggested they 've got some arse-covering legalese somewhere . 
  plus , i must confess , i could n't really be bothered . 
  i have approached both the advertising and trading standards bodies a couple of times , about some things that i considered actually-important , but i really did n't have the patience for this . 
  plus not doing so meant i could send them a pointless-but-cathartic rant , 
  it was used . 
  i go as far to say ` well-used ' . 
  not misused , though . 
  although i suspect that depends on what you define as legitimate use . 
  i , for example , consider `` putting stuff in it and carrying it around most days '' to be perfectly acceptable . 
  they may not . 
  arg you broke my rhyme gland, 
  i was thinking of an excel-style thing , a grid arranged into horizontal rows representing records , with each piece of data organised into columns . 
  tab taking you to the next field ( ie , moves the cursor right ) , and enter taking you to the next row ( ie , down ) . 
  good suggestion man , 
  i 'd suggest that instead of ( or as well as ) the ` add another row ' button , just always maintain at least one blank row underneath the user 's data . 
  add a new one as soon as they move the cursor into it . 
  i love that idea !, 
  i mean , it 's horrible and could n't condone it , but it seems waaay more practical than it should be for such a ridiculous-sounding concept . 
  [ not every animal-based-weapon did so well , though ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anti-tank_dog#deployment_by_the_soviet_union ), 
  ( not that i 've been on a minor wikipedia adventure around your link or anything  ), 
  i used it as a rucksack . 
  i carried some heavy stuff in it from time to time , but nothing that would be considered an extreme amount to put on your back . 
  did i exceed what the manufacturer deems an excessive load ? 
  possibly , i have no idea , they never told me what an excessive load consisted of . 
  but i did use it in a manner that a normal person would consider acceptable for a rucksack . 
  downvotes and upvotes are not weighted the same . 
  it takes 5 downvotes to make a comment disappear for most people . 
  in comparison , 5 upvotes is only a modest amount .
