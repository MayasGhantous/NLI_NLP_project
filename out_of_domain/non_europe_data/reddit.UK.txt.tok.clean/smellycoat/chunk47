  downvote stuff that should n't be there in the first place . 
  upvote stuff you like . 
  it 's pretty simple , 
  so it 's nothing to do with smack-money at all then ? 
  i think html5 is extremely important , simply because i do n't like the idea that a single company 's closed source client is responsible for so much of what is now considered essential browser functionality . 
  in practice i doubt it 'll replace flash entirely ( it may get there eventually , but it 's going to be a long , slow process ) . 
  but i do think it 'll start eating into its niche . 
  i suspect it 'll at least take over as the primary means for displaying video . 
  google seem like they 're keen to move away from ( or at least provide alternatives to ) flash , there 's already an [ experimental html5 interface for youtube ] ( http://www.youtube.com/html5 ) ( try it in chrome ) . 
  i do n't see any reason why canvas would n't eventually be able to replace flash for games and the like . 
  i imagine it 's just a performance problem at the moment . 
  javascript performance seems to be a priority at the moment for browser vendors , so maybe there 'll be a time when it can compete . 
  assuming you had a working ` < video  ` tag , with an api that provides some means to identify how far through the video is , then annotations on videos seem like they 'd be very easy with html/js . 
  youtube will likely switch ( or at least move to an html5 player where possible ) as soon as there 's sufficient support . 
  they 've already been playing with html5 interfaces . 
  because if you click something and start typing , your cursor is right over the text you 're trying to type . 
  i read that as `` i snorted 40 feet of coke '' . 
  i was like , `` respect '' .

   kit kat family block -- australia -- twelve finger family size bar, 
  holy shit !, 
  edit : [ pics ] ( http://videos.mnetcorporation.com/kitkat/images/poster.jpg ) , but unfortunately somewhat disappointing . 
  shame . 
  originally to prevent passwords from being read over your shoulder . 
  but now it 's mostly because nobody wants to be first to show passwords in the clear . 
  ooh you 're a rare one around these parts . 
  i have a question , if i may :, 
  from here , there appears to be an * entire industry * built around giving `` batshit insane right wing dumbasses '' what they want to hear , regardless of accuracy and consequences . 
  i 'm thinking glenn beck , bill o'reilly , etc. 
  i can go and easily find dozens of examples of right wing nutcases pulling borderline incendiary and just downright stupid things out of their arse . 
  that 's fine , i know that stuff exists , and i 'm not trying to blame you for it . 
  my question is this : is there similar for `` batshit insane liberal dumbasses '' ? 
  can you point me to some examples ? 
  so , to be clear , you 're sending affiliate spam to lists you 've bought from people collecting legit signups ? 
  do you consider it spam ? 
  what do you think of the can-spam legislation ? 
  to me it seems pretty toothless . 
  how the hell do you get hold of enough ips to actually deliver mail in significant quantity before the big receivers ( hotmail , yahoo , etc ) blackhole you ? 
  hmm . 
  moore is a massive twat , and certainly rather melodramatic at times , but i do n't recall him ever actually inventing `` facts '' in the same way that the fox news types do . 
  but i 'm no expert on the dude , so i may be wrong . 
  you * do n't * consider what you do to be spam ? 
  the generally-accepted definition of spam is `` unsolicited bulk email '' . 
  do these people know you 're going to send them email ? 
  okay , so , someone signs up for something , fails to uncheck the `` i want other random companies to send me stuff too '' box , and they sell a list of those people to you . 
  that sound about right ? 
  anti-spam types consider `` opt in '' to mean that someone explicitly gave consent to receive email from a particular entity . 
  anything else is considered spam . 
  am i correct in the assumption that these people have n't given ** you ** explicit consent ? 
  so these are people signing up on your own site ? 
  right , so , at no point are they giving you consent to send them email . 
  at best they 're agreeing to allow the site they 're interested in to resell their address . 
  and at worst ( and in my experience , the most likely situation ) , they just did n't realise what they 're agreeing to . 
  how far off does that sound ? 
  come on man . 
  i do n't have a problem with you or what you do , but do n't try to tell me everyone reads and understands often huge and horribly-worded terms and conditions . 
  edit : and even if they did , that does n't change the fact they have n't ever given ** you ** consent . 
  i do have a bit of experience with this stuff ( programmer in the less `` seedy '' end of the market ) . 
  if you diligently read the terms for every form you fill in , then i can tell you this much - you 're the exception ( we did some testing a few years back , about 2 % of people in our [ admittedly limited ] sample even clicked the link to read the terms ) . 
  okay let 's leave the 3rd party signup form itself . 
  these people have never given ** you ** consent to send them email . 
  at best they 've given some vague open-ended consent to receive random email from whoever the company decides to sell their list to . 
  this form of `` consent '' is n't recognised by anyone ( except the marketing types they use it to justify their emails , of course ) . 
  no laws recognise it ( although some make it sort-of legal to sell the lists , the spam legislation does n't really address the concept of consent - which is why i referred to can-spam as `` toothless '' ) . 
  the only real measure is what the anti-spam organisations think , because they 're the ones that actually control whether your ip gets blacklisted or not . 
  and the vast majority would consider what you do to be spam . 
   if someone does n't read it , then they obviously do n't care if they receive my services . 
  if someone does n't read it they have no idea that there 's potential for their personal data to be resold without their knowledge or consent . 
  all they 've done is implicitly agreed to a ( already legally hazy ) `` click-though contract '' . 
   they gave consent to someone else . 
  then that other party can legitimately send them email . 
  you can not , as they have n't ever given you any consent . 
  look i 've said it before , i do n't have a massive issue with what you do , but i do object to labelling it as legitimate . 
  you 're using legal loopholes to send spam . 
  and , judging from what you 've told me about your data collection , it most definitely * is * spam . 
   if no plan is included in a subtest , an implicit done_testing should be there . 
  thus , you can write subtests without specifying a plan but still have a bit of safety . 
  i thought exactly the same thing when i started using subtests ( which are otherwise very cool ) . 
  [ mst is right ] ( http://www.shadowcat.co.uk/blog/matt-s-trout/a-cunning-no_plan/ ) about plans often being more trouble than they 're worth , but subtests actually go some way to making plans more useful and usable , with less scope for accidentally breaking them . 
  but in the general case an implicit done_testing would certainly be very convenient . 
  i 'd definitely use it . 
  in fact it 'd probably be enough to make me use subtests more frequently . 
   i think i know how to implement this and it would make test author 's lives simpler . 
  yay ovid , 
  a virtual server is probably your best bet for catalyst apps . 
  that way you get full control over the system , can set up cpan how you like , and you do n't have to worry about angering anyone by starting up long-running catalyst processes . 
  only downside is that you 're generally rather memory restricted with vpss , and memory restricts the number of server processes you can have running at once - which restricts your throughput . 
  i do n't have many useful suggestions , but i 've heard [ linode ] ( http://www.linode.com ) are good . 
  hey wait what ? 
  `` string comparisons are one of the most cpu expensive operations '' ? 
  compared to adding two integers , maybe . 
  compared to fetching a thumbnail url from wherever such things live , and generating the necessary html to display it . . probably not . 
  you 'd be surprised how often it happens when interviewing programmers . 
  you so know what happened . 
  designer : `` i 'm done , what do you think ? '', 
  is it in the middle ? 
  it looks too far to the right . . '', 
  designer : `` yes , it 's aligned . 
  i used a grid ! '', 
  client : `` please check again , it definitely looks wrong . '',
