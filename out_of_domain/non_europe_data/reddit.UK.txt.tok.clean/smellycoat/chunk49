  edit : and they 're [ still doing it ] ( http://www.robweir.com/blog/2009/05/update-on-odf-spreadsheet.html ) with document formats . 
  i understand why it is how it is , but they do n't * need * to do it . 
  it 's a marketing tool . 
  one of many . 
  if they cared about the inconvenience to other shoppers , then they 'd stop . 
  at the very least , they could make the checkout process easy . 
  the difficulties that are necessary to prevent everyone using coupons do not need to be at the checkout . 
  in fact , for one or two coupons , those difficulties are n't very significant at all - they 're only evident when usig dozens of the things . 
  and the people willing to collect that many are n't going to be scared off by some checkout delays . 
  it just annoys other customers . 
  indeed you are , sir . 
  i agree we should be able to churn out some decent drama . 
  but the wire is something of a one-off , it 's tv drama of a quality that has been rarely been seen since . 
  either side of the pond . 
  that 's because he 's playing the tune for the vocal part , 
  i ( kinda ) did that for computer science course . 
  i got as for all the tests , fs for all the homework , and an a for the final exam and coursework . 
  although it did n't turn out quite as well as your story ; i got accused of cheating and narrowly avoided expulsion . 
  i 'm doing so now , 
  i 'm in the uk and have grown to love [ farnell ] ( http://uk.farnell.com/ ) . 
  they * are * rather overpriced , have a limited selection compared to other places . . 
  but they do next-day delivery for free , which is amazingly useful . 
  i 've places loads of < # 1 orders for odd bits and bobs that i 'm missing , and they have n't let me down yet . 
  although i do think they might be trying to tell me something - my last order ( for a single ir led ) was delivered in a ** huge ** box ( big enough that both of my cats are currently sleeping in it  ), 
  they do serve other countries too , but i do n't know how good they are outside the uk . 
  edit : as i say , they 're expensive , so probably not a good place for a big order . 
  but if your order is for # 0.12 , a 100 % markup is n't really a problem , 
  you need to be embarrassed about how much money you got if you sued macdonalds for having `` coffee that 's too hot '' . 
  you do not need to feel * any * shame whatsoever for suing the * everloving crap * out of the guy that left you a triple amputee !, 
  you need about seven hands to be able to solder electronics successfully , you 're not that bad off there , 
  well , shit . 
  i spent an hour yesterday trying to work out why my exported function 's prototypes were n't being honoured properly in a test script . 
  makes sense now !, 
  okay maybe i picked a shitty example !, 
  you know the kind of frivolous litigation i 'm talking about , though . . 
  in my opinion , it 's `` friendly '' without being cheesy . 
  plus it 's the font the bbc use for their logo and titles ( different weights , though ) so kinda-sorta authentic , 
  edit : failing that , my next suggestion would be [ gotham ] ( http://imgur.com/yzneu.jpg ) . 
  it 's not at * all * authentic , but works pretty well , i think . 
  give a man a fish and he owes you one fish . 
  teach a man to fish and you can collect license fees and a percentage of annual profit for the rest of his life . 
  i once met a guy who was into `` geohashing '' . 
  people plant marijuana seeds in the middle of nowhere , and post coordinates for others to go back and harvest . 
  edit : probably not the * best * idea for your kids though !, 
  was it ? 
  that makes it a less-fun story . 
  i met the dude a coupla years back at a grow shop ( when i got the idea in my head that growing my own was a good plan ) . 
  i love fonts used for industrial or utilitarian purposes . 
  no idea why . 
  i guess because the decision of what to use is * far * more complicated than the typical graphic design typeface decision , and i love the fact that someone cared enough to do it . 
  typefaces used on road signs are a good example . 
  [ transport ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/transport_%28typeface%29 ) , which is used on road signs here in the uk , for instance . 
  [ johnston ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/johnston_%28typeface%29 ) on the london underground , too . 
  again , i do n't really know why , but possibly because they 're both reasonably unique , and impart a little personality on otherwise huge , fragmented , faceless organisations without compromising their utility . 
  i also love to see helvetica ( or i suppose any other well-designed , neutral typeface ) anywhere it 's been used `` by default '' in places that are n't really `` designed '' . 
  invoices , small print on contracts , that kind of thing . 
  i have no idea why , it just makes me happy to see it there . 
  well . 
  sometimes you need a philips screwdriver , a flathead screwdriver , a tiny jeweller 's screwdriver , or some crazy torx-bit thing . 
  and if you need one , none of the others will do . 
  but i still have a favourite screwdriver . 
  i wish the python guys no ill-will at all , but i do find it rather amusing that one of their problems is a lack of convention for tests and documentation , 
  because a ) * some * of the people who like it will likely end up buying it and b ) the dvd/bluray `` gift market '' is huge ( and xmas is coming ) . . 
  how does the move to aws work out money-wise vs your self-hosted setup ? 
  i 've been looking hard at `` cloud '' stuff , but i just ca n't find a way to make it add up . 
  it seems okay for small services that do n't require too much in the way of resources , but ( ironically ) the costs do n't seem to scale well at all to bigger applications . 
  have you managed to make it a cost-effective move ? 
  covered badly . 
  a glass ashtray designed to break into three dull chunks instead of shattering ? 
  use a fucking plastic ashtray !, 
  actually there 's a good reason not to use a knife . 
  it gives a clean cut , which really does affect the final flavour . 
  a roughly-split muffin is far tastier . 
  though i would n't go as far as purchasing an implement specifically designed to do that job and nothing else . 
  if you know your way around usenet binaries , giganews has a free 14 day trial . . 
  they 've got plenty of bandwidth to saturate your connection for 3 days while you leech pretty much anything you fancy ( i recommend some long-running tv shows . 
  [ the wire , if you have n't seen it ! ] ), 
  sorry dude . 
  the paper they 're supposedly `` printed '' on is actually the same two images of paper repeated ( compare the right hand side on a few ) , and the signatures are identical . 
  shame . 
  funny still , though . 
  from what i 've seen , perl6 is most definitely perl . 
  it 's just not perl5 . 
  i experienced a similar thing when i went to the docs and they were checking my sinuses with an endoscope - i could ` see ' the light when he was pointing it up towards my eye . 
  i 'll admit i did n't pay much attention to it at the time , i was more concerned with the rather alarming diameter of the evil-looking contraption that was in the process of raping my nostril ... 
  they 're pretty ugly ( and dangerous - stepping on an upturned plug is not a fun experience ) , but once they 're plugged in they 're nice and solid . 
  and feel a lot more ` permanent ' than some others . . 
  those are really cool man , good work . 
  i really feel like you need something on there that explains where you 're getting those numbers . 
  without that , good science students will be ( rightly ) skeptical , and and anyone who disagrees is going to assume you just pulled those stats out of your arse . 
  but still , good work man , they look nice . 
   i no longer know what to say about this . 
  typically , you 'd say either `` yes '' , or `` no '' , depending on whether or not you have a penis . 
  is there * any * situation where you could n't replace any instance of `` utilize '' with `` use '' ? 
  i too quite like test plans , but mst , as often happens , [ is right ] ( http://www.shadowcat.co.uk/blog/matt-s-trout/a-cunning-no_plan/ ) . 
  specifically about them being hard to cope with in anything but the simplest test . 
  fortunately , [ subtests ] ( http://www.shadowcat.co.uk/blog/matt-s-trout/a-cunning-no_plan/ ) ( which get their own plan ) are a really good way to use them without fixing your entire test script to a rigid structure and introducing problems if two people are working on a test at the same time . 
  my favourite poster ( at least , of those that i actually own ) is a map of london from the [ openstreetmap ] ( http://www.openstreetmap.org ) project . 
  unfortunately , they do n't seem to be selling them any more , but i found [ some pics ] ( http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/talk:merchandise#london_poster_.28oct_2005.29 ) ( [ this one is particularly good ] ( http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/images/d/dc/osm-london-paper-1280x1024.png ) , although i do n't know why it 's white-on-black ) . 
  it 's built up from hundreds of individual gps data-logged paths through the city , so it 's really rather cool to look at in detail .
