  the fuse is there as a failsafe in case some other part of the appliance goes wrong . 
  if the current passing through it becomes greater than its rating , the thin wire inside will melt and break the connection . 
  while replacing the fuse with a non-fused conductor generally just means you 're disabling that failsafe device , the simple fact that the fuse has blown in the past suggests that there may be a safety issue . 
  that is , the fuse may have blown in response to an event that may have otherwise lead to a fire , and by removing it without fixing the underlying cause , you 're putting yourself at unnecessary risk . 
  so my take would be that it 's not safe to run without the fuse there . 
  the spark you 're seeing is likely because the twisted wire you 've used is n't making a perfect connection . 
  this in itself could be a safety hazard , as is the possibility of the picture wire heating up as it may do ( given it 's not really designed as a safe , efficient electrical conductor , rather for hanging pictures ) . 
  fuses like that are pretty cheap and easy to replace if you know your way around ( and own ) a soldering iron or can find someone who does . 
  otherwise your best bet is to probably throw it away , or you could try taking it back to ikea . 
  no it is n't . 
  sorry man . 
  unibody has a black hinge thing between the screen and body , it * does n't * have a power button within the right hand speaker grille ( and as pointed out elsewhere it does n't have latches above the screen ), 
  it 's a nice idea , but i do n't buy it . 
  if your brain was temporarily `` pausing '' to skip over the useless blurry vision , then we would ' t be able to do things like listen to music while reading ( which relies heavily on an accurate perception of time ) . 
  i 've long had the feeling that animals experience time relative to their size . 
  that is , time moves `` faster '' for smaller creatures . 
  this seems to explain not only the shorter lifespan of small things/longer lifespan of big things , but also reaction speeds ( consider a mouse 's reaction speed compared to ours - or even a fly 's ) . 
  you want a `` killer feature '' for linux ? 
  you can fire up a package manager ( the vast majority of distros come with one ) , search for a bit of software and install it immediately . 
  no chance of spyware , no chance of it attempting to completely take over your system , no digging around random slightly-dodgy sites looking for some niche app , hoping it 's not a virus or something evil . 
  no fucking about looking for keygens , or dealing with popups nagging you to buy something . 
  there 's progress to be made , certainly , but it 's completely unfair to say you ca n't do anything with it . 
  in many cases the user experience is actually far better . 
  i 'm not going to address all this bollocks , but some of this shit i just ca n't let go !, 
   * even if someone follows a good tutorial they could configure linux wrong , windows is all setup for you , removing most headaches . 
  bollocks . 
  ubuntu 's installer is almost-entirely click-throughable . 
  i think the only thing it forces you to do is type in a name and password . 
  there 's not even that much to fuck up if you try really hard . 
   * windows is very customizable , but if you are referring to open source , even out of the people who do use linux , they tend to pick a pre-built build , or one that is done automatically for them with limited options . 
  dude , on a vanilla ubuntu install , you can very easily change even very fundamental things like the damn window manager !, 
  you can even pick different filesystems if you want to , or completely change the kernel . 
  you have exactly as much control as you want to have - it all depends how much effort you want to put in . 
  with windows , all you 've got is whatever checkbox options ms deem to give you in a control panel . 
   * ethical ????? 
  i feel good paying for the work of many engineers and scientists ( even if they could substantially lower the price and still continue to make a huge profit ) . 
   * educational ? 
  i think the mac would be a better choice than linux for competing against windows here . 
  well , depends what you 're talking about . 
  do n't forget that pretty much every linux distro comes with a complete toolchain for writing your own software , and usually at least a couple of scripting languages . 
   * strongest platform for software development ? 
  not really , not at all , unless you are only talking about web software , which is still only slightly beating windows . 
  other than that there is a much larger market share towards windows software . 
  see above !, 
  the programming world does n't entirely consist of visual studio !, 
   * security ? 
  think of this scenario : one of the huge reasons windows is preferred as it 's easy to plop in the disk and press a couple of buttons and bam , it 's installed no hassle to the user , and can be done by virtually anyone w. ... 
  anyone can put a ubuntu disk in a machine ( or in fact any one of a number of distros , but ubuntu is probably the most well-known ) , click `` next '' a few times , enter a username and password , and have a working system . 
  no fucking about with serial numbers or `` validation '' . 
  shit just works . 
  come on man , i 'm happy to have a grown-up discussion about this shit , but this is just no-ps3s-are-a-million-times-better-than-xboxes-level uninformed fanboy drivel . 
  download a linux distro and try it . 
  ubuntu is a good candidate , the installer is a live cd so you can try it from the cd without installing it . 
  then come back and we 'll talk , k ? 
  spawn camping is your reward for being better organised than the other team . 
  if you 're * being * spawn camped , then it 's generally pretty easy to fix , as long as every player does n't run directly into it one at a time . 
  it 's really not a problem in tf2 . 
  it 's weird that i consider 256 to be a `` round number '' , right ? 
  how 's your case cooling ? 
  in many cases , graphics card problems are caused by the cooler being surrounded by hot air , rather than the cooler itself being ineffective . 
  often , a better solution is to make your case cooling more effective . 
  a simple test to determine if this will have an effect is to simply run the machine with the side of the case partially removed , to increase the ventilation . 
  what the best options for increasing your case 's cooling effectiveness will entail depends on what you have now and how much ventilation your case provides . 
  but , generally all that 's required is adding an extra exhaust fan , or even cleaning any existing filters .

  same reason i never got around to using xhtml - the browser support just is n't there . 
  sure you can blag it with a chunk of js here and there , but it seems rather foolish to jump through those hoops ( and slow down your pages for most people ) just because you want to use ` < nav  ` instead of ` < ul class = `` nav ''  ` . 
  as soon as browser support is at the point where the * minority * of browsers do n't support it , i 'll be all over html5 . 
  but until then , i 'm sticking to html4 .01 strict . 
  that said , i 'm not saying it 's necessarily a * bad * thing . 
  if * you * want to use it , go ahead !, 
  i * love * the film , but the diva has to be one of the weaker moments .

  my favourite omelette ( of which i 've been eating far too many of recently ) goes like this :, 
  * half a red onion , sliced, 
  * 2-4 mushrooms , sliced, 
  * 1 slice of parma ham/proscuito , torn into smaller bits, 
  fry that lot up in a pan with some butter until the onions are nicely brown ( i like them just on the verge of starting to burn ) . 
  the ham/proscuito does n't need much cooking at all , so throw it in last . 
  then dump on some eggs , stir that shit around a bit until it starts to stick together , put some grated cheese in there too . 
  then wait until it 's cooked but still nicely runny on top . 
  it 's a tasty fucking beast !, 
  i prefer the much simpler :, 
  str = number = = 1 ? 
  `` one '', 
  : number = = 2 ? 
  `` two '', 
  : number = = 3 ? 
  `` three '', 
  : number = = 4 | | rand ( ) = = 42 ? 
  `` four '', 
  : number = = 5 ?
