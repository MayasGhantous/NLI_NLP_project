  i like a plastic 2 pint milk container as they have a big opening , but whatever . 
  let it soak while you do the rest . 
  clean as much as you can before you get anything wet ( if there 's wet mud , let it dry ) . 
  you can get a long way with just a brush . 
  start at the top and work down . 
  you might find you need to start taking stuff apart to get this done ( i usually have to at least take the saddle off ) . 
  once you 've got the worst off , you can use a very slightly damp cloth or possibly a little bit of degreaser to get any stubborn marks off . 
  then you can move onto cleaning the mechanisms . 
  toothbrush tends to work well . 
  you might want to take some stuff apart to get it properly clean . 
  for example , i tool the rear mech off and dismantled the cage so i could clean the jockey wheels . 
  just make sure you clean everything well ( bit of degreaser on a rag works wonders ) , and slap some grease on before you put it back together . 
  in fact you want to grease each and every bolt , screw , and joint while you 're at it . 
  to clean the rear cassette , i cut thin strips of rag and just slotted it between each gear , pulling each end back and forth to rake out all the crap ( i honestly thought the gears on my cassette were supposed to be black until i did that ! ) . 
  pay attention to the brake/gear cables , mine had collected a fair bit of rust and crap inside ( they were much smoother after a good clean ) . 
  usually you can unhook part of the cable and just slide the housing around so you can get at it all with a rag . 
  do n't forget to slap some lube on the cable afterwards , though . 
  as for the chain , let it hang for a bit to let the degrease drain off/evaporate , give it a good wipe down , and chuck it back on . 
  then run the pedals backwards and apply chain oil to the bottom part of the chain ( so it goes onto the inside ) . 
  do n't be shy with it . 
  run through all the gears to spread it around , and then give it a good wipe down . 
  orange flavour effervescent vitamin c tablets , two ibuprofens and a shitload of tea . 
   you may think that a few small stains on a carpet is n't a big deal , but it actually means i have to replace the whole carpet in that room which get 's expensive quickly . 
  no you do n't . 
  the carpet still works as a carpet , and some small stains count as wear and tear . 
  stains happen . 
  you ca n't expect a carpet in a property you 've rented out for a year or more to be exactly as it was when it was new . 
  if * you * decide you * want * to replace the carpet , that 's your call . 
  but ** you ** should be paying for it . 
  nah man , those things are fucking cheap . 
  you can pick up a replacement double socket for < # 3 , and a back box ( if you need it ) for a coupla quid . 
   you can boil a kettle in about half the time you can in the us . 
  tea is serious business . 
  looks like a [ french ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:french-power-socket.jpg ) socket to me . 
  the fuses in british plugs blow very rarely ( i have a ten year old pack of fuses with , i think , two missing ) , and generally only when there 's a fault in the device . 
  though that might be down to [ rcd ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/residual-current_device ) s on the mains circuit in every home . 
  you can buy unswitched sockets here if you want them , they 're actually a little cheaper and very nearly as easily-available as the switched kind . 
  most people go with the switches , though . 
  unswitched sockets are most often used when the socket will be somewhere out of reach and a permanent switch ( like a heavier-duty light switch ) installed somewhere more accessible . 
  i suspect it dates back to when our plugs did n't have a plastic collar on the conductor pins . 
  if you tried * really * hard it was just about possible to touch a conductor while inserting/removing the plug while it was still connected . 
  that 's a god damn handwriting font . 
  could n't even be bothered to bust out a sharpie . 
  ( compare a few of the letters , the `` g '' , [ lowercase ] `` l '' and `` a '' are good ones ) . 
  edit : [ signature font ] ( http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/ephemera/satisfaction/ ), 
  point being , if they * do * blow , they 're saving either your appliance , or * you * . 
  the point is that a small stain does n't affect much . 
  the carpet still acts as a carpet , and you could quite happily rent the place out again without replacing it . 
  you have to expect a certain level of wear and tear , stuff like carpet has a finite lifespan , you can not expect it to be 100 % as it was when it was new when at the end of a tenancy . 
  there 's an argument for charging * some * money to the tenant , but there 's definitely no case for charging for the entire carpet . 
  i 've rented tons of places ( er , over a dozen ) and have had many arguments with stroppy landlords and letting agents over these kinds of things . 
  in fact , the law here in the uk has changed recently , deposits are now paid into a protection scheme ( kinda like escrow ) , any deductions have to be agreed , and third-party arbitration is available to sort out any disagreements . 
  this law was enacted exactly because of stuff like this , and has been a pretty positive step for tenants . 
  happens every day after eastenders ,

  [ never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by stupidity . 
  dear apple ,, 
  you can have it back if you promise not to sack the dude who lost it . 
  that was an accident , not treason against king jobs himself . 
   and the virgin mary was 14 when she got knocked up . 
  invisible cock does n't count !, 
  if you must , you can jump in now and not miss all that much . 
  although they 're coming up to the end of a season now , so i suspect they 'll be moving from filler to storyline eps ( have n't seen the latest two or three yet , but that 's usually what happens  ) . 
  i agree that gizmodo were on the wrong side of this . 
  but , meh , it 's journalism . 
  price you pay for free speech , etc. 
  i have mixed feelings about them publishing the dude 's name , though . 
  on the one hand , it might go some way to help protecting his job ( or give him a bit of publicity should he lose it , which may help him find a new one ) . 
  but i have trouble believing they did it for either of those reasons . 
  if they really * did * feel bad about it , they 'd offer apple the thing back on the condition that they do n't sack the dude . 
  possibly wo n't help that much ( that 's a pretty big fuckup ) , but the majority of the damage to his career had already been done before gizmodo got their hands on it . 
  this is all fun and that , but how the hell can you post this iama without any pics ?!, 
  dell cases piss me off . 
  cheap , rattly , plasticky pieces of shit . 
  their rackmount server cases ( at least for the mid-to-high end jobs ) are fucking nice , though . 
  problem with that is it takes effort to police , requires immediate attention and still leaves the possibility open that some will slip through the net . 
  on the other hand , if you * enable * styling there on a case-by-case basis , the time constraints are more relaxed , and the chances of it being used for exploits are greatly reduced . 
  although it 's possibly more work . 
  i do n't know how popular that stuff is . 
  or maybe you enforce the important parts of the stylesheet by having an inline style tag after the user css , containing any rules you do n't want user stylesheets to be able to alter ( with ` ! important ` in there to be sure it 'll actually override anything set in the user sheet regardless of specificity ) . 
  i suspect a few well-chosen rules would be enough to prevent the majority of the problems . 
  it 'd take a bit of work though , 
  that depends what you need to do to secure things . 
  for example , if you wanted to disallow css positioning inside a particular element , you could enforce something like ` . someelement * { position : static ! important } ` . 
  i suspect that with a bit of work it 'd be possible to lock down a fair number of possible css exploits that way . 
  admittedly , it 's not the most efficient of solutions , and would definitely take more work than simply switching that functionality off . 
  but it is a way in which some functionality could be retained while limiting the risks . 
  another way to deal with it is to allow styling only within particular elements by parsing the stylesheet and prefixing each rule with something to limit their scope . 
  you 'd have to disallow positioning to make that work , but it would certainly be possible to do . 
  in fact that 's exactly the mechanism by which yahoo 's webmail client used to work ( not sure if it still does , though ) . 
  it allowed some css inside emails , but prefixed each selector with an id selector to limit its scope , and disallowed particular rules . 
  it worked for them , and i 'm pretty sure they were n't doing it by hand , 
  hmm , you do n't think those are a bit . . harsh ? 
  what about [ this ] ( http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/graphic-stylin-nf/ ) ? 
  i 'm only really talking about pages that otherwise would have styling disabled entirely , like the compose page . 
  margins do kinda work like positioning , but only really for legitimate uses of positioning . 
  not the kinda stuff you 'd need to be able to fake up login forms or whatever . 
  once you enforce ` display ` , ` visibility ` , ` position ` , fix font sizes for a few important elements and maybe disallow stuff like ` text-indent ` ( possibly negative margins too ) , you 're pretty much stuck with whatever 's on the page already . 
  you ca n't do much to hide it away , and you ca n't easily shift it around to look like other things . 
  all it takes then is a bit of forced styling on the important elements in the page , so you ca n't make them look * significantly * different , and you 've got a reasonably solid system , with only a few edge-cases to worry about .
