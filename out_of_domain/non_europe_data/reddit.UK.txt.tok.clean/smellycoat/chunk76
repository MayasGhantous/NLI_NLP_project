  but anyway , effort , 
  this nearly happened to me a few years back . 
  i was waiting at the lights , and as they changed some arsehole in a van zoomed past and turned left directly in front of me ( in the uk , the roads are the correct way round here  ) . 
  very nearly died horribly that day . 
  but , i have a confession to make . 
  i jump that light nearly every time now . 
  it 's connected to another light for traffic going across , so by keeping an eye on the other light , it 's possible to jump it while both lights are red , and thus ( vaguely ) safely get a head start on the traffic trying to turn left . 
  i know that makes me a bad person . 
  only that one day you might have a collision . 
  chances are pretty slim , i 'll grant you . 
  but they * are * slightly increased by the high potential for day-ruining . 
  contrary to the beliefs of most motorists , bicycles can accelerate quicker than cars ( they just have a lower top speed ) . 
  if you 're in the lane next to cars , then you can end up stuck there as drivers will assume they 'll pull away faster than you so will move in front of you ( or worse , turn into you ) . 
  if you 're in front of the other cars , you 're visible , and you have a chance to get into a proper position in the lane without risking getting squished . 
  if you 're at a junction , there 's also the possibility that someone will want to turn across your lane ( ie , turn left here in the uk , or turn right in the us ) . 
  if they have n't spotted you or are just stupid , there 's a good chance they can turn into you ( particularly larger vehicles ) . 
  in my town , there are green areas at almost every light for cyclists , so there 's space to get in front of the traffic . 
  er , hard to explain , here 's a shoddy ascii-diagram ( ` ### ` is the area for cyclists , cars have to wait behind it ) :, 
  if you feel the need to overtake another cyclist who 's not going considerably slower than you , to assert your manliness or whatever ... 
  do not immediately slow down . 
  yes . 
  but you 're not blocking them , at least not initially , because you 'll be accelerating faster than they are and will have a short head start . 
  it gives you a few seconds to get into a proper lane position , and means every driver has to go around you , rather than starting neck and neck , hidden behind other cars and risking someone turning into your path . 
  by the time the cars catch up , you 're positioned so they can easily see you and go around you . 
  ah , yes , that 's exactly what i was ( cackhandedly ) trying to describe [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/bicycling/comments/btzcx/bicycle_etiquette_what_should_every_rider_know/c0ok3rj ) . 
  thanks for the link , 
  file extensions mean absolutely nothing on the web . 
  the content-type header is what describes the file type . 
  a decent framework will let you set up your uri space however you like , and provide stuff like routing and dispatching . 
  my experience is more like . . one of them is always completely full , and the rest are utterly deserted . 
  and if i do manage to get a slot , my pings are ridiculous . 
  need more european tf2dditors !, 
  i 'm a big dude , and i. . kinda abuse my poor bike . 
  to the point where i 've broken many spokes . 
  my local bike shop would happily replace spokes and true my wheel for # 0 - # 10 each time , depending on how long it was since i broke the last one , how many spokes i 'd ruined and how fucked the wheel was ( usually a function of how much riding i 'd done on it since it broke  ) . 
  when i finally got sick of breaking the damn things , they rebuilt the wheel for me with a nice new hub and tandem spokes for # 30 . 
  it 's indestructible now !, 
  good work there fella !, 
  let us know if you find success , 
  i think you 'll find that many people can hate adobe and flash , yet still be annoyed at apple for fucking adobe over . 
  or to put it another way , just because they 're against apple 's decision to change their t+c s , it does n't mean they 're suddenly adobe supporters . 
  how 's about a bit of inline script to do it . 
  you should n't need to wait on domready to do this :, 
  i can see why you 're pissed off with adobe ( i 'm no fan myself ) . 
  but the arguments you 've put forth there are essentially `` adobe did n't do enough , and they took too long about it '' . 
  however , this situation is about apple * deliberately * taking steps to screw adobe over . 
  my point was simply that i think your question is based the false assumption that everyone who is n't happy about apple 's t+c s change supports adobe . 
  i do n't think that 's the case . 
  many people , if pressed , would likely agree that allowing cross-platform development platforms will lead to lower quality software , and that it 's not necessarily a terrible thing for apple to restrict them . 
  the issue is with the way apple have gone about it - by turning further tightening the chokehold they have on iphone development . 
  i totally agree that adobe have woefully neglected flash on platforms that are n't windows . 
  and i personally do n't disagree with apple not supporting flash on their platforms ( y' know , kinda . 
  on the one hand , flash is horrible . 
  on the other , to do that they have to lock down their platform quite dramatically ) . 
  and apple * did * fuck adobe over . 
  if that was n't their goal , then they would n't have waited until cs5 's vinegar strokes before changing that clause , or at least they could have given adobe a heads up that the crap they 've been working on is n't going to be allowed . 
  i 'm not saying it was necessarily bad , but it was kinda a low blow . 
  besides , we 're not really talking about flash per se here . 
  this ( iirc ) was compiling stuff built in the flash editor down to a binary that 'd work on an iphone . 
  that could be anything from a complete obj-c cross-compiler , to a binary with embedded flash client ( or anything in between ) . 
  ( though , knowing adobe they 'd have likely picked the most irritating solution ) . 
  potentially , but there 's nothing to suggest it was anything more than incompetence . 
  and , well , they 've already proven themselves to be rather proficient at that ... 
  besides . 
  not writing software for a particular platform is n't great . 
  but a ) they got there ( eventually ) and b ) i ca n't see any situation where it 's worse than specifically preventing someone from using software that was written for your platform ( and worse , waiting until the necessary investment had been made to develop it ) . 
  hot digity !, 
  social networking for people with beards !, 
  where do i sign up ? 
  i like in the uk and i 'm  this < close to preordering from gamestop and paying the $ 15 international shipping . . 
  all the bikes i 've had came with [ this ] ( http://www.thegreenbikecompany.co.uk/portals/0/images/fisher%20push%209.16%20alloy%20body%20&amp;%20cage%20pedals%20xtr%202009.jpg ) type of pedal ( i have no idea what these things are called , so you get pics ) . 
  i find them rather small and uncomfortable , not especially grippy , and that they have a tendency to hack big lumps of flesh out of my shins if i 'm not paying attention . 
  i have since replaced them with [ this ] ( http://aebike.com/images/library/catalogs/soc/p350x350m/pd1016.jpg ) style . 
  i find them far more comfortable , ridiculously grippy , and although the studs * are * rather sharp , i do n't shred my legs nearly as much with them . 
  i 've also used [ this ] ( http://www.cyclesuk.com/img/f/465576.jpg ) style , which are basically just a cheap version of the above with the studs moulded in rather than being screwed through . 
  they 're a bit less effective ( and can be a bit slippery in the rain ) , but as the studs are rounded they 're nowhere near as dangerous . 
  a couple of years back , a friend gave me a used pair of [ these ] ( http://www.brianrourke.co.uk/images/dx.jpg ) . 
  they came with two sets of studs at different lengths , the shorter of the two are really very short indeed ( only protruding a millimetre or so ) , but seem to be pretty effective at gripping my shoes , but they 're short enough that they 're very hard to cut yourself with . 
  i believe these are a little expensive , though . 
  there 's always plastic pedals if you 're really having trouble . 
  i 've destroyed all the plastic pedals i 've had ( but then , i 'm a big dude ) . 
  i 've seen [ these ] ( http://www.evanscycles.com/product_image/image/389/4bd/dd0/39086/product_page/wellgo-lu-214-city-comfort-pedal.jpg ) around , but have n't tried them . 
  holy fuck , i ca n't wait for that shit !, 
  they 're not * at all * rubbery , they 're cast out of some alloy or other ( ie , they 're made of metal ) . 
  but the studs and edges are rounded so you 're unlikely to injure yourself on them . 
  if you want plastic pedals , there are loads about , but i 've never used any that did n't deform over time and become uncomfortable . 
  beef . 
  yes i know . 
  the '' :( '' was for the crack , not for the fact that i found it , 
  no it 's very easy to deal with , just follow up '' . . lately i 've been listening to < obscure  and < more obscure  '' with `` what about you ? 
  i 've got wc3 , sc/bw and a wow subscription ( off at the moment , but i played for a good coupla years ) , and still no beta :(, 
  i 'm pinning my hopes on amazon ( or somebody ) doing beta keys on preorders in the uk soon . 
  holy shit , a use for logo !, 
  me too . 
  well , the plain marathons ( the ones that do n't have the blue extra-puncture-protection-layer in them ) , as they 're a bit cheaper , lighter and are what the lbs happened to have in stock , 
  i have n't had a puncture since installing them about three years ago . 
  at least not one that was the tyre 's fault ( i have had one pinch flat , and a cheap tube squeeze itself through a rip in the rim tape onto the sharp end of a spoke , but nothing that the tyre could be blamed for ) . 
  hang about . 
  why does [ this ] ( http://i.haymarket.net.au/utils/imageresizer.ashx?w=450&amp;n=http://backoffice.ajb.com.au//images/news/100-degree-macbook-fujitsu.jpg ) screenshot of the `` fujitsu lifebook sh 760 '' which apparently `` uses the same core i7-620m cpu as the macbook '' say it 's an i5 ? 
  i 've considered it , and very very nearly done it a coupla times .
