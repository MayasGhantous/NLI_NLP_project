  i 've got an urban 400 , and have broken pretty much all of it . 
  including the frame . 
  i often imagine ( what i assume ) my cat 's desires as if spoken by a deep-voiced black man . 
  kinda like [ the bunk ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvw34_gnxu4 ) , but maybe a bit more gangsta . 
  `` mroow '' : `` hey bitch , i 'm hungry . 
  `` meeeorooow '' : `` nigga are you listening to me ? 
  i said i 'm fucking hungry ! '', 
  i 'll admit i 'm concerned that this may be a slippery slope to complete insanity . 
  that was an interesting read !, 
  let me tell you about the last time i got into a fight . 
  it went like this :, 
  * some guy hit me in the face, 
  i agree . 
  and i do n't even think it `` sucks for them '' , as those tricks they used to pull to maximise profits by delaying release dates and convince people to buy the same thing several times are n't really very relevant to legitimately selling an artist 's creative output . 
  so i 'm not sorry they 're no longer able to do that . 
  but i * do * think they 're some of the unspoken reasons they 're going after filesharing as aggressively as they are ( and why they put a lot of effort into inflating lost revenue numbers ) .

  blimey , that 's actually html ( rather than flash , or canvas or something else ) . 
  so , it 's using a small ssd as a persistent cache ? 
  which means each of those tests was performed with the cache primed with the necessary data , and even then it did n't do * that * well . 
  i could see it might be useful for laptops where you want both space and fast boot times but ca n't install both a separate ssd and a big drive . 
  but judging by the numbers for crysis level loading ( ie , it 's slower even than a bog standard 7200rpm drive ) their stated goal of selling it to gamers is probably not entirely sensible . 
  although maybe they meant `` these people have lots of disposable income and a tendency to buy unproven technology '' rather than `` this might actually benefit them '' . 
  i predict this will only be barely faster than a normal hdd in proper benchmarks , and will disappear into obscurity when the next generation of ssds wipes the floor with its numbers . 
  that 's assuming it 's cheap enough to warrant it . 
  a [ 40gb ssd ] ( http://www.storagereview.com/intel_x25v_ssd_review_40gb ) can be had * reasonably * and is probably a much better solution ( yeah i know that 's a ton more cash than an hdd , but this thing will cost more than a normal hdd , and ssds are getting cheaper all the time ) . 
  in some cases ( if whatever you want to centre is a inline or inline-block ) you can set line-height and height to the same value and set text-align : center ;, 
  it 's pretty situational , though , and only works when you have a known height on the container . 
  it 'll ( kinda ) work with an image . . 
  take it apart and clean the filth off the wheel 's sensors ( and rotor , if it has one ) . 
  this is mostly true , and i mostly agree with it , at least hypothetically . 
  a shop owner certainly has the right to refuse to serve anyone for any reason . 
  they 're rather likely to cause themselves some social problems if they choose to serve only white folk , though . 
  hiring and firing is a little different , as there are specific laws to ensure that everyone is treated fairly . 
  an employer still has some wiggle-room within those laws though - up to a certain point they 're free to not hire certain people for whatever reason if they do n't want to ( although they 're likely to cause themselves some trouble if they fire someone purely for being black or continue the practice to extremes ) . 
  personally , i think this works out relatively well . 
  for the most part , the laws that are in place are there only to give a little push to people that have traditionally been discriminated against , which ( if done carefully ) will speed up their integration into society , and help remove some of the social stigmas . 
  so i really have no issue with `` affirmative action '' type laws ( at least in principle ) . 
  if there is any blame to lay , then it 's with the bigoted cunts that made them necessary in the first place , 
  do n't like digg 's ui at all . 
  too much focus on the lowest-common-denominator content , and comments are relegated to second-class content elements with a a rather half-arsed system that 's little better than a blog . 
  consequently , digg 's comments are similar to digg 's links - stuff that appeals to the lowest common denominator , with everything else disappearing into obscurity . 
  reddit , however , does a good job of promoting discussion by making commenting one of the most important parts of the site . 
  even huge , complicated , nested threads are easy ( ish ) to follow . 
  i would n't come here if it was n't for the comments . 
  religion , plus a healthy dose of intolerance and stupidity . 
  it looks legit to me after a little grope around in the source . 
  makes me wonder what you might have been doing with that domain , though ( or possibly who you might have pissed off  ) . 
  well , if the one you 're watching is episode -5 , then episode -4 would indeed be the next one . 
  $ 300 will barely cover the cost of the multiplier/backplanes you 're gon na need , so i hope you 're just talking about the chassis here , otherwise you 've probably got some rethinking to do , 
  if i was doing this shit on the cheap ( i 've thought about it  ) i 'd start with a cheap 1u server , drill out a bunch of holes in the bottom for sata cables , and use a rack shelf underneath it ( with the multipliers mounted directly onto it ) for the drives . 
  it 'll probably need something to hold the drives up , and maybe to hold some fans , but that could be as simple as a sheet of plastic or something with drive-size holes in it in a grid , and some fans strapped to it . 
  properly ghetto , i know , 
  although you 're right , i 'm pretty sure that when she said `` muslim '' , she meant `` brown '' . 
  er , using a usb hard drive that also has a network connection would probably work . 
  they 're not all that cheap for what they do , mind . 
  you could just get yourself [ something that 's actually good at playing hd content ] ( http://www.xtreamer.net/xtreamer/overview.aspx ) . 
  then you could play it directly over a network . 
  or , even better , build yourself something that 'll run [ xbmc ] ( http://www.xbmc.org ) . 
  it 's a * really * good media player . 
  an atom/ion board will do they job ( the xbmc live linux distro thing supports ion 's hardware decoders ) and although more expensive than the xtreamer , they 're not ridiculously priced . 
  i just built myself an htpc around an atom/ion board and xbmc , it 's really fucking nice ( although i 'll admit i went a little overboard  ), 
  she works for the british council , and she just spouted a load of racism/anti-religion crap in public , and could possibly lose her job over it . 
  and you think she picks her words that carefully ? 
  try some [ survivorman ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oi2eu60gk4u ) . 
  les stroud is the fucking man . 
  yeah , probably . 
  a crossover cable is a simple device that should work with the vast majority of network devices . 
  the only caveat is that the ad-hoc ` network ' created between the two machines has no dhcp server on it , so you 'll have to assign a static ip to each machine . 
  which is possible with a computer , but i do n't know about a ` nas ' box . 
  you 'd have to check . 
  honestly , though , for the money you 'd need to spend on the hdd/nas-with-usb thing , you could buy a player like an xtreamer or wdtv that will be able to handle pretty much anything you can throw at it . 
  bnp ! = british council . 
  i suspect , if she saw a muslim , she 'd say :, 
  `` fucking muslims should go home '', 
  and if she saw a sikh , she 'd say :, 
  `` fucking muslims should go home '', 
  flash it first , they 're still pretty new bits of kit and some firmware updates can dramatically improve performance . 
  but apart from that , just treat it as a standard hard drive . 
  all the other tweaking you might want to do can be dealt with once you have an os on there . 
  to type '' @ '' , you have to press shift and the ' 2 ' key ( on a us keyboard ) , which is two keypresses . 
  to type `` at '' you also have to press two keys . 
  why not just type `` at '' ?

  / r/apple * used * to one of the ( very ) few apple related places where both sides of an argument could be discussed sanely without anyone getting lynched for not toeing the party line . 
  unfortunately , it 's kinda descending into fanboyism these days , though . 
  i * kinda * agree with you , but you downvoted the article . 
  vacuum cleaner . 
  compressed air will dislodge any big clumps of dust , and if you have a vacuum cleaner nozzle pressed up against the vents when you do it , it 'll clean it out pretty effectively before it has a chance to settle . 
  although i do n't understand the situation well enough to have an opinion either way , i will say this : nothing kills a ` clandestine ' relationship quicker than acceptance . 
  i 'm just happy to be pooping . 
  getting old , man .
