  no no no . 
  the lubrication that penises produce is called [ pre-ejaculatory fluid ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pre-ejaculate ) ( `` pre-cum '' ) . 
  it 's a clear , rather thick fluid with surprisingly effective lubricant properties . 
  you 've never encountered that ? 
  [ smegma ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/smegma ) is something else entirely . 
  well , there are probably similarities , but it 's very different stuff . 
  it 's yellowy-white , smells a bit nasty , and is much thicker . 
  `` cheesier '' , you might say . 
  the wikipedia page seems a bit unsure about what it actually consists of , but from my limited experience it seems to be dead skin plus skin oil , maybe some sweat , probably a bit of semen or pre-cum and some other unspecified stuff . 
  rigorous scientific testing \\* has established that it 's rarely a problem for an uncircumcised male ( assuming they manage to wash their penis with some regularity ) . 
  \\* rigorous scientific testing may in fact be neither rigorous nor scientific , and limited to a sample size of one subject . 
  i 'll try my mbp laters , though . 
  be interesting to see if plugging this kb into it yields different results . 
  i 'm not sure how accurate that description is , to be honest . 
  well , maybe if it refers to the very very slight layer of ( more or less invisible ) moisture under the foreskin ( which i 've always assumed was just normal skin oils , or maybe sweat ) . 
  the nasty yellowy-white stuff is n't there normally , and i ca n't see it being a very effective lubricant ( it has a consistency very close to that of cheese . 
  sorry if i 've put you off cheese for life  ) . 
  my thought was always that it 's dead skin plus whatever fluid happens to be down there ( skin oil , precum , sweat , etc ) . 
  the only times i 've seen it are when i 've either not washed for a shamefully long time , or angered the skin on my glans somehow . 
  either rather vigorous sex with insufficient foreplay ( okay , drunk sex ) , or in my younger days , overly frequent or , uh , `` experimental '' fappage . 
  my assumption has always been that the relatively small amount of pre-cum produced would n't be sufficient to facilitate comfortable fapping using a hand directly . 
  whereas a foreskin is a much smaller area and can ` contain ' it to some degree . 
  but then i suppose a circumcised male 's glans is going to be somewhat desensitised ( it 'd be fucking uncomfortable walking around with my bellend exposed to the inside of my pants !, 
  to be honest , if the bike in the vid had been locked with a very small lock , then the wheel would have been clamped too close to the fence ( or whatever it was ) to get a saw in there . 
  i see you 've altered some of the code a in your post . 
  it 's still wrong , though . 
  you have no exit condition on that timer loop ( ie , it 'll loop forever ) , and it 's not taking into account how long the rendering will take ( so it 'll go at different speeds depending on the machine , browser and how much work the rendering engine needs to do to reflow the document ) . 
  i think the lesson here is that being able to copy and paste bits of jquery code is n't the same thing as understanding javascript . 
  at least your post is useful for something . 
  i also note you 've sanitised all the comments on your post pointing out your numerous mistakes . 
  bad form , dude . 
  bad form . 
  [ he did ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/web_design/comments/c8cio/jquery_vs_javascript_the_masters_share_their/ ) , 
  that is . . no . . no !, 
  make it go away !, 
  just plug the loose pin arrays into the arduino , lay the shield pcb in place and solder away . 
  should keep everything nicely lined up . 
  a bucket of cold ( ice ? ), 
  water with a piece of stretchy , airtight rubber over the top with a hole in it and a cuff of some description to stick your hand through . 
  if you can get the cuff to be strong enough to hold the weight of the bucket while being reasonably airtight , then assuming there 's not too much air inside , suspending the bucket by the cuff around your wrist will provide negative pressure . 
  do n't know if it 'll be enough negative pressure though , 
  if your internet connection is < 20mbit or so , and you do n't need wireless n , then a wrt54gl is a good choice , with [ dd-wrt ] ( http://www.dd-wrt.org ) on it in place of the stock firmware . 
  i ran one for many years with few issues . 
  i recently upgraded to a d-link dir-615 as it can handle faster connections and has wireless n. dd-wrt supports this too ( although i would n't necessarily recommend this particular model , it 's just what my isp sent me so i thought i 'd try it out ) . 
  i 'd definitely advise going for a separate modem and router , though . 
  i had no end of trouble with the all-in-one things . 
  whatever you pick , i 'd consider using a replacement firmware like dd-wrt , openwrt or tomato . 
  the featuresets are much larger , less buggy , and it gives you a lot more control . 
  also , the ui is a damn sight easier to use than a lot of the manufacturer 's crappy interfaces . 
  agreed , and i prefer tomato . 
  however it seems to have far less hardware support . 
  i had an amstrad cpc 6128 . 
  learned me some basic when i was like 12 . 
  graduated to an amiga 500 some years later , and then an amiga 1200 . 
  it had a hard drive and everything . 
  that shit fucking rocked . 
  spent a lot of time learning blitz basic on it . 
  it was n't until i was about 19 ( or maybe 20 , it was 98 or 2000 ) when i got my first pc . 
  still miss the amiga . 
   who does n't get tired reading in bed ? 
  reading does n't help at all , i 'll end up reading the whole damn book and staying up until 6am if i start reading in bed . 
  the gpl is * not * crap . 
  it 's a license . 
  one of many that programmers can choose from . 
  if they did n't want to impose the restrictions the gpl enforces , then they 'd pick a different license . 
  what you 're essentially saying is that anyone who picks the gpl to license their code is in some way bad . 
  which is a fine way to treat people who have given their time and effort for free so others can benefit from their work .

  i 'll take half a dozen # 5s if you can deliver them by the weekend . 
  what ? 
  * how much ?!, 
  you hear that ? 
  that 's my fucking dick in your ear man , i swear . 
  not much , man . 
  pretty much all you can do is wait . 
  but time does n't make it does n't hurt any less , you just think about it less often . 
  i spotted that horrible crap ages ago ( er , maybe as long as a year or something ) . 
  played with it for a bit , and marvelled at the kind of idiot mind that would think this was a good idea , the desperation of evil fucks that choose to use it , and the horrible cunts who then went on to make a business out of it . 
  then i adblocked the shit out of them , and moved on , 
  edit : oh , also :, 
  javascript : document.body.contenteditable = true ; void ( 0 ) ;, 
  . . makes the content editable . 
  replace some of the text with swearing and insults of your choice , then copy bits of it at will  ( if you have firebug or something , then you can watch your swearing winging it 's way to tynt 's servers  ), 
  cycling in bad weather can be fun , but it gets old very quickly , 
  and preface every statement by banging on about allah for 10 minutes . 
  3 is bordering on underweight ( not quite , but close ) . 
  5 is around size 16 , which is about average . 
  no they wo n't . 
  if you fail to quote user input properly you 're going to have exactly the same problems .
