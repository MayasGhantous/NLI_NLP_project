  being a big dude , i can put a lot of force into the drivetrain , which has caused one or two problems , and because i * can * do that means it took a while to get out of the habit of using too high a gear . 
  changing that helped a lot . 
  $ 500 seems like a decent budget for a bike . 
  i 'd probably save ~ 30 % of that for lard-proofing ( like a rebuilt rear wheel and new pedals ) . 
  this might be a * little * controversial , but i recommend a hybrid over an mtb ( although one closer to the mtb end of the scale than the road bike end ) . 
  the thinner tyres should be fine ( mine are ) , but the extra speed boost it 'll give might help his self-esteem a little . 
  knowing that despite the fact i 'm a fat , unfit fucker i can still keep up with most people helps a lot . 
  an mtb will make that a bit harder . 
  although that looks great , i 'd be inclined to go for something with gears . 
  i destroyed a lot of chains , two chainrings , a cassette , one left crank and two pairs of pedals before i learnt to use my gears properly . 
  without them i suspect i 'd have turned my bike into an entirely useless pile of twisted metal by now , 
  i weigh around the same . 
  although i would n't say no to disc brakes , decent v-brakes are plenty good enough . 
  i agree entirely about the suspension , though . 
  i had to tighten mine up so much that it 's doing entirely nothing . 
  and , yes , another vote for a hybrid . 
  enhance, 
  well , you need a corpus of text to analyse , but otherwise it 's pretty easy . 
  * extract each word, 
  * discard those that are too short, 
  * sort and count up each duplicate, 
  * sort the output numerically, 
  * discard everything except the top 500, 
  quick and dirty unix command which does roughly that :, 
  perl - e ` while ( <  ) { for ( split / / ) { s / [ ^ \\ w - ] + / / g ; print lc , '' \\ n '' if length  = 10 } } ' corpus.txt | sort | uniq - c | sort - gr | head -500, 
  as for where you 'd get a suitable corpus of text , i do n't really know . 
  wikipedia , possibly ? 
  i believe they provide the entire content for you to download somewhere . 
  literature would probably be better , but depends what you actually want . 
  you 'll quickly forget about cycling . 
  it 's a massive , and unhealthy time sink . 
  do n't start man , 
  pretty much , yup . 
  last night i was strangled by arnold schwartzenegger . 
  sweating , mostly . 
  best prevention method ever :, 
  maybe they 're not the most clueful bunch , but they 'll certainly tell you they have an apple machine . 
  repeatedly . 
  without you even asking . 
  that 's * true * , but in practice there 's still only half a dozen or so major players serving large volumes of binaries to lots of users . 
  take a few of those out and although the usenet network will continue to work , it 'll cease to be useful as a mechanism for distributing large files . 
  but i do admit that i * love * it . 
  ssl , plenty of bandwidth to max out my 50mbit connection , and plenty of good indexing sites make it very convenient indeed . 
  hold your breath , 
  ask yourself this : at what point do you consider a foetus to be a `` human '' , or gain whatever quality you believe makes it a moral problem to get rid of it ? 
  if your answer is `` at the moment of conception '' ( as a lot of pro-life people believe ) , then consider what 's actually there at the moment of conception . 
  two cells , little more . 
  if you think that stopping a pregnancy at this point is bad , then do you consider `` morning after '' treatment to be immoral ? 
  ( i wo n't say `` morning after * contraception * '' as that 's a little bit of a confusing word in this context ) . 
  if you * do * consider , `` morning after '' drugs immoral , then why not all forms of contraception ? 
  contraception is just stopping the process a bit earlier . 
  if you * do n't * consider `` morning after '' stuff to be bad , then what 's the difference between that and abortion a short time later ? 
  we 're still talking about an amorphous blob of cells with that ca n't think , feel pain , etc. 
  the body frequently terminates pregnancies at this point still . 
  there 's definitely a point before birth where a foetus becomes a child , and i 'd have concerns with abortion at a certain point . 
  but it 's a matter of degrees . 
  i ca n't see any benefit in drawing the line at the conception stage , as there 's really nothing much there at that point .

  they really need to get on top of this and just promise everyone a free case , before the tech blogs get any more over-excited . 
  [ start here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/favors/comments/b2yfk/request_help_with_my_speech_to_the_judge_who_has/ ) . 
  it looks like it 's not happening for everyone , granted , but there are plenty of reports - enough to show it is indeed a significant problem . 
  they 've already told people to either hold it differently or buy a case . 
  here 's the relevant part of their statement :, 
   if you ever experience this on your phone 4 , avoid gripping it in the lower left corner in a way that covers both sides of the black strip in the metal band , or simply use one of many available cases, 
  which risks looking like an attempt to turn a problem into profits . 
  a freebie case would completely reverse that , shut everyone up , and rapidly turn the story into a positive one ( and it 's not as if those cases can be particularly expensive to manufacture ) .

  except sheep !, 
  they 've got sheep !, 
  i 've experimented with lots of different techniques . 
  my favourite by a long way is the ` foot scrape ' ( ie , dragging the sole of your shoe against the ground for a second to make a noise ) . 
  that seems to be far more successful at getting people to move over * without turning around * . 
  the not turning around thing is important . 
  if people turn , they often do n't get out of the way first . 
  i also feel it 's a little more polite to not interrupt their stroll or conversation too much . 
  i 've tried the `` on your left '' thing ( and had people do it to me ) and i really do n't like it . 
  you have to be pretty close to not have to shout , and it seems to shock people so they turn without getting out of the way ( exactly what i did the first time it happened to me ) . 
  i 've also seen a couple of instances of people moving left to get out of the way , processing the words and then moving right . 
  that ai n't good . 
  if the foot scrape does n't work , then i 'll slow down , get close enough to not have to shout and say `` excuse me please !, 
  they 're hungry ? 
   finger me for a burglary, 
  my , you * are * into some kinky shit !, 
  uh , it 's not an atmega328 ... 
  kinda . 
  it 's actually some other as-yet-unknown ic incorrectly labelled ( probably deliberately ) as an atmega328 . 
   this is not a bad thing for consumers . 
  actually it frequently is . 
  it 's just most of the time ( ie , in a proper market with proper competition ) , `` good for the shareholders '' generally means selling more , which means better products and lower prices . 
  which is generally considered a good thing for consumers . 
  but companies that do stuff that 's `` good for consumers '' * only do so by accident * if those things happen to align with what 's good for their shareholders . 
  isps are kinda different . 
  well , they 're not that different in theory , but in practice what 's happened is they each try to carve out little monopolies rather than all competing with each other in every area . 
  that works out great for their shareholders - many people have a choice of exactly one company , so no matter how shit they are , they 're still going to make money . 
  once they 've got their turf , they do n't really need to do * anything * . 
  maybe crank up their prices a bit . .
