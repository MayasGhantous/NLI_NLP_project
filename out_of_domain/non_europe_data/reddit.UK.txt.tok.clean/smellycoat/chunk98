  that said , places like hn often link specifically to reddit comment pages . 
  i do . 
  i pay ( admittedly through the nose ) for virgin media 's 50mbit cable , and i do get [ pretty close ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ub6fp.png ) to the advertised speed . 
  but that 's cable , which is n't available everywhere , but generally better than adsl for speed ( although it does mean i have to deal with virgin media . .  ) . 
  did you have their cable service ? 
  they resell bt adsl to people that ca n't get cable , which is pretty damn crappy . 
  their cable service is pretty good though . 
  i love the fact that he clearly had a minor imperfection in his bottle after cutting , and tries to hide it with his finger rather than owning up , 
  those are fucking terrible !, 
  the intention is that a degree teaches you the fundamental theories and concepts of computer science that have barely changed since the 70s , and a certificate teaches you a vocational skill necessary to drop into a particular job . 
  the idea being that your degree will give you essential background and skills/knowledge that 'll be useful throughout your career , and certificates give you a particular skill , but need to be updated frequently . 
  unfortunately ( at least in the uk ) many degrees have become `` how to code in java '' vocational courses which teach a shallow and rapidly-outdated skillset . 
  certificates have become a way for companies making very complicated software and hardware to make money in the process of attempting to reduce the tco of their products , by turning training courses into `` education '' . 
  to be honest , for many of the actually-good jobs at clued-up companies , you do n't * need * either . 
  a lot of the very best programmers and engineers out there are entirely self-taught . 
  heavy is a lot more nuanced than it first appears . 
  you 've got to know when to attack and when to fall back ( because you 're a huge , slow target and your minigun takes time to spin up ) , and you can be easily outranged by other classes . 
  doing a good job of it relies on the rest of your team ( or at least a decent medic ) to back you up . 
  tf2 and quakelive are both excellent for allowing the individual lacking the housefly-like reflexes of typical fps players to have a vague chance at not dying with zero kills every 7 seconds . 
  i fucking hate those ketchup-anus bottles . 
  sounds like you 'd make a good pyro . 
  charging in alone is n't the most sensible thing to do as pyro , but , yknow , they 'll be too busy being on fire to worry about how much of a noob move it was , 
  because housefly-like reflexes alone are n't enough to escape my wall of flame/pipe-bomb spam ? 
  i did n't mean pyros are bad , or a `` noob class '' , i love playing pyro !, 
  ( it is , in fact , my most played class , by a long margin ) . 
  i just mean that not staying with the group and the occasional kamikaze charge are actually quite effective with a pyro . 
  the globe works for me , it 's a bit bastard-child-of-at & t-and-ibm , but it does look clear , bold and recognisable . 
  the ` fingerprint ' is n't really coming through ( you need a [ whorl ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fingerprint#classifying_fingerprints ) or something for that , i think , but that 'll be tricky ) , but it kinda works anyway . 
  the font , on the other hand , is * awful * ! \\* almost anything else this side of comic sans would look more professional . 
  you probably want to go with something condensed , as otherwise you 'll end up with a relatively ` long ' logo ( but , to be honest that could work too ) . 
  try a classic clear sans serif like helvetica , univers , frutiger , etc. 
  probably worth checking out the condensed variants . 
  \\* apologies if i 'm being a bit too scathing , i 'm a little drunk . 
  why are people less likely to buy a copy of a book if you have less in stock ? 
  i mean , if you print 10k , and 8k sell , then you print 8k and sell 6.4 k , then does n't that simply mean your books are less popular ? 
  your sales are never reaching the point where inventory is a problem . 
  if your second book happened to be more popular than the first , then surely you 'd sell every copy , and the publisher would be thinking about printing more , or at least ordering more of your next book , right ? 
  be careful what email service you use , many webmail clients will put your ip in the headers , which ( depending on your setup ) makes you potentially traceable . 
  gmail , fyi , does not do this . 
  or you could pass the details to a random redditor to send for you . 
  we love us some drama , 
   some officers see the penalty for the infringement - six points on the licence - as somewhat disproportionate . 
  well , yes , that does seem disproportionate , and much as i 'm like drivers to stay behind that line , i think i agree with police officers who `` do n't notice '' when they do n't . 
  for our american friends , `` points '' are issued for certain traffic offences , if you reach 12 points then you can be disqualified from driving ( ie , banned ) for a period of time . 
  the posterous example is a little silly . 
  if that were implemented in any half-way sane manner , there 's no reason for something like ` if ( platform = = ` blogger ' ) { . . } else { . . } ` to appear anywhere at all . 
  for example , building a general suite of blog-platform-extraction tools and then using per-platform routines ( classes , modules , whatever ) to use those tools to handle each different service and its particular quirks would seem to be a sensible way to go about it . 
  oh look , no special cases !, 
  anyone building that by adding a pile of new conditions all over the place for each new service deserves the endless maintenance pain it 'll cause . 
  i think the `` special case '' mentality is a potentially dangerous one . 
  it 's either required functionality ( and thus must be there and be * as * important as everything else ) , or it is n't . 
  now , if it 's * implemented * as a sneaky ` if ` statement deep inside something else , well , then it 's up to you to decide whether that 's a hacky implementation or not . 
  quite often it 's perfectly acceptable , quite often it 's the first of many on the road to a messy codebase . 
  you 're more likely to buy it if there are more in stock ? 
  do you think a book that sold 8k of a 10k run would have sold 16k if the publisher had printed 20k instead of 10k ? 
  i [ posted ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/ideasfortheadmins/comments/cu6kx/remove_underscores_from_comment_markdown/ ) this before , but nobody seemed to care :(, 
  yes , they 're both conventions , but asterisks are used for emphasis * far * more frequently than underscores . 
  and underscores are used in normal text far more frequently ( at least around these parts ) than asterisks . 
  the arms come off . 
  not easily , but they do . 
  so if the legs do n't flush fit backwards , if the arms are removed then there 's nothing else to identify the front from the back . 
  you 're right , there are a ton of badly-implemented intranet apps out there that are limiting the ability of large organisations to move away from ie6 . 
  however , the solution that seems obvious to me , but nobody seems to use , is leaving ie6 on the system , but installing a different ( non-ie ) primary browser . 
  then normal web access can use something vaguely secure , but ie6 is still available for the ancient intranet . 
  using something like an [ hta ] ( http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms536496%28vs.85%29.aspx ) to provide access to each app via ie6 would help streamline things a little , too . 
  exactly . 
  if this were me , i 'd ask an employee for a refund , get refused . 
  then go find a management type and ask :, 
  * do you have a shrink wrapping machine ? 
  * are your employees allowed to use it ? 
  * is it supervised continually ? 
  then show him what you got in your sc2 box and say `` look i do n't want to make your life difficult , but there 's no way i 'm going to forget about this '' . 
  what 's wrong with ` new ` ? 
  the squeezebox stuff is actually a bit different from general logitech software . 
  the server ( the bit you run on your computer ) is perl , the source is included ( ie , you can alter it if you want to ) , and you can add tons of [ plugins ] ( http://wiki.slimdevices.com/index.php/squeezecenter_plugins ) . 
  the database it stores stuff in is mysql , so you can go look at or tinker with it directly if you want to . 
  the protocols are all documented , so you can produce your own interface to control it ( and there are plenty out there ) , or even swap the server for a different , compatible one . 
  even the [ squeezebox remote ] ( http://reviews.cnet.com/sc/32815168-2-440-remote.gif ) is hackable . 
  it 's a tiny device running linux with a wireless connection to your network . 
  if you switch on an interface option , you can ssh directly to it and get a shell . 
  all the interface code inside the device is implemented in lua , and is hackable right there on the device . 
  you can literally ssh to the device , fire up ` vi ` , make some changes to the interface and go test it immediately . 
  there 's even a full copy of the original code on there so you can reset it quickly . 
  so , yes , i 'll agree that the software is n't quite as good as it could be , but i do love the fact that i can fuck with it . 
  while the fact it 's hackable is * really * cool , if you do n't care about that stuff , i do understand . 
  but , i 've got to say , i never had any problems with it as an audio playing device . 
  got it all set up now , works fine . 
  even my girlfriend likes it . 
  are you talking about the software on the player device itself ? 
  i 've only used the one with the remote control ( which is an entirely different client ) and never had any problems with it , but it 's perfectly possible that the stuff on the boom is bad . 
  if you want to try out the remote without the investment , there 's a software-only version of the remote called [ squeezeplay ] ( http://wiki.slimdevices.com/index.php/squeezeplay ) which is basically an emulator for the code the remote runs ( it 's primarily a development tool , but it works exactly as the remote does ) . 
  y' know , that 's a much better way to pick colours than my usual entirely-at-random-while-pretending-i-have-some-design-ability method . 
  the kerrigan portrait in the collector 's edition art book is pretty blatantly milla jovovich . 
  not that i disapprove of either tricia helfer or milla jovovich , i 'm just saying , 
  the [ last time ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/web_design/comments/c8cio/jquery_vs_javascript_the_masters_share_their/ ) i stumbled across a link to this dude 's website he 'd thrown up some untested and just plain broken bits of js intended to replace jquery animations with `` blazing fast '' plain js . 
  except it did n't even nearly work . 
  this time he 's managed to massively overengineer ` position : fixed ` . 
  good work !, 
  if it 's raid5 , then you will be suffering from degraded performance as the hardware will have to reconstruct data on the fly . 
  which leads to lots of nasty things , like extra load on the drives , heat , reduced performance , etc.
