  i think the best thing here would be to discuss it again when she 's a bit calmer , explain how much you want to see her , but you 'd like to take advantage of this while you can instead of both of you just sitting around all weekend . 
  suggest something extra extra special that you can go out and do when she does come to see you to make up for it instead . 
  there 's nothing wrong with wanting love and a relationship at all , but i think there is a problem with wanting a relationship to be the be all and end all of a perfect life . 
  it 's a * lot * of pressure to hope that another person is going to be your emotional support , or to basically cure you from feeling lonely . 
  you ca n't really use a healthy relationship as some sort of emotional crutch to get you through life , you * have * to be able to do a lot of it yourself . 
  do you have a support network of friends where you are right now to help you feel more settled ? 
  genuine compliments on my clothing or my hair makes me the happiest . 
  not a `` wow you look hot ! '', 
  kind of compliment , more of a `` that shirt looks really nice on you , threesquares '' or `` that haircut/colour really suits you '' kind of phrase . 
  specificity is always appreciated . 
  it 's tough , but you have to let her make her own life 's choices . 
  you want to go to uni and get on in life ? 
  great !, 
  if she does n't want to , that 's fine . 
  if she * does * want to , but does n't put in the effort to make it happen then that is a lesson she has to learn , and she * has * to learn it herself , as frustrating as that may be for you . 
  why exactly do you want to compliment your boss ? 
  would you compliment them on their looks if they were male ? 
  * i know he cheated on his gf , but i know he 's a good guy at heart * really ? 
  despite the cheating ? 
  take off the rose-coloured blinkers . 
  you just want him because he 's already taken and because you missed your chance with him the first time around . 
  if he cheats on one girl , he 'll cheat on you . 
  walk away . 
  went to see iron man 3 by myself just last week - i do it all the time . 
  i do n't actually get why so many people are self conscious about going to the cinema alone ; you 're sitting in the dark , after all . 
  no one actually * cares * who you 're with . 
  i 've only eaten an evening meal by myself once or twice and have never been to a bar alone as i do feel like there 's massive social stigma attached to that one . 
  i 'd hate the feeling of wandering into a noisy bar without being there to meet anyone else . 
  i feel perfectly fine eating lunch alone , though - maybe because it 's in daylight when more people are out and about anyway . 
  you 're sitting in the dark for most of it anyway , so i figure no one actually a ) notices or b ) cares about whether i 'm there by myself or not . 
  sometimes i do miss having someone to dissect it with afterwards , but it 's hardly a compulsory requirement for going to see it in the first place . 
  waiters sit down to talk to you ?? 
  i would be so uncomfortable with that !, 
  bum bag . 
  fanny pack always has me giggling like a little girl . 
  i have [ really short hair ] ( http://i7.photobucket.com/albums/y281/mearimydra/presscrew.jpg ) and i love it . 
  i always get told i look much younger than i actually am ( i 'm 28 , people tend to think i 'm somewhere around 23-ish ) . 
  people tell me how much they like my hair , but i never really get comments on how short i have it other than from other girls who are also thinking of going short . 
  i 've had it above-shoulder length for well over ten years now and it sort of varies how much length i have to it since i get bored pretty quickly , but i much prefer it short right now . 
  i think it suits me best . 
  i think you may have more luck searching under the term of ` sumptuary laws ' , which were the clothing and fashion laws levied across europe from the medieval period onwards . 
  sumptuary laws regulated pretty much everything any person wore , and looked mostly to tell everyone which strata of society could wear which fabrics , which colours and which styles . 
  for instance , only royalty could wear the colour purple and only the upper nobility ( i believe it was dukes and duchesses , though i do n't have my fashion text ) could wear cloth of gold . 
  facial hair was included in this . 
  the rather interesting [ one thousand beards : a history of facial hair ] ( http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7pdn3pnqowmc&amp;lpg=pa27&amp;ots=advlpf61dx&amp;dq=sumptuary%20laws%20beards&amp;pg=pa29#v=onepage&amp;q=sumptuary%20laws%20beards&amp;f=false ) has this to say in particular about the beard laws which might be of interest . 
   in 1447 , during the reign of henry vi , a decree was issued which forbade the wearing of moustaches and required that the upper lip be shaved every two weeks . 
  i could find no historical documents to explain henry 's moustache hatred ; it may have been seen as the mark of the foreigner or linked to his own inferior growth . 
  or perhaps he just felt like issuing a decree involving sharp instruments that day . 
  the same text also suggests that henry viii kept his hair short because he liked the duty shown by king francis i of france 's courtiers in keeping their hair short when the king had to have head surgery following a snow-ball throwing accident . 
  henry then also ordered his court to do the same . 
  portraits of henry viii do always show him with a full beard and short hair , so i would be inclined to agree with this analysis . 
  the same edition suggests the beard tax was enacted late in henry 's reign , despite him having one himself , and thomas more protested this even on the block , saying, 
   `` my beard has not been guilty of treason . 
  it were an injustice to punish it . '', 
  as late as 1542 , members of the english bar were not allowed admission with a beard ( being defined as `` anything over a fortnight 's growth '' ) . 
  by 1553 , lawyers with a beard would have to pay a 12 pence supplement per meal . 
  the anti-beard laws were repealed in 1560 , but the author does n't seem to agree with the second wikipedia statement that elizabeth i re-introduced the legislation again . 
  hope that helps !, 
  from what i can tell , snowball fighting accidents seem to be a thing with francis i. 
  the source mentioned above says that during a snowball fight , a firebrand was thrown instead and landed on his head . 
  apparently it happened as the king and his courtiers were charging the door of a palace in a fun snowball fight , someone inside grabbed a brand out of the hearth and threw it ; it landed on the king 's head and his surgeons had to remove all of his hair , which had `` extreme beauty and luxuriance '' . 
  ouch !, 
  another source [ here ] ( http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8bxnz8kokxuc&amp;pg=pa72&amp;lpg=pa72&amp;dq=king+francis+france+snowball&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=aigywkoaao&amp;sig=lzm72z2cdgozo0dyphtiliaascs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=yowkufl2b87epcuigcac&amp;ved=0ceyq6aewaw#v=onepage&amp;q=king%20francis%20france%20snowball&amp;f=false ) says that during another snowball fight , a linen chest was dropped on one of his courtiers , killing him outright . 
  not the best luck in the world . 
  oh erk , thanks for that . 
  i did wonder as it seemed more jovial than i 'm used to in sources . 
  i 'll do more research and see if i can find some additional reliable sources for the op . 
  you want to break up to avoid hurting your girlfriend because you ca n't see your relationship working out , but you also want to drag it out to have some summer jollies and maybe some sex in the sunshine . 
  can you even see how ridiculous that sounds ? 
  if you want to break up with your girlfriend , * break up with your girlfriend * . 
  stop dilly dallying because you made some fun plans about what to do when it gets hot again . 
  good god , you sound sixteen again , not thirty one years old . 
  you are not helping * anyone * by drawing the inevitable out until the weather changes . 
  nope . 
  she 's the one that got away . 
  keep it that way . 
  for me , footpath is a small narrow alley way going between roads or a small path used on country walks . 
  a pavement is any concreted , raised area for pedestrians running alongside a road . 
  they 're very different things . 
  but you just * made * the decision . 
  you have told us about the decision that you are making and why are you making it . 
  where are the benefits in dragging it out ? 
  i would much rather you broke up with me then coming along all happy clappy to some summer events and then breaking up with me once they were all done . 
  i would be supremely hurt knowing that you had n't actually been into the relationship for several months , especially ( as you said ) she is falling in love with you . 
  also , i 'm a madam thank you very much , and your tone is just as snotty as mine . 
  high horses do n't help anyone when you 're talking about stringing along a friend and a lover for the sake of some summer plans . 
  a cliche ; good underwear . 
  a well-fitting pair of lacy knickers ( french knickers are the best ) and a good , supportive fancy bra makes me feel like i can conquer the world . 
  i always wear good underwear when i go clothes shopping , because if i feel great when i take off my clothes in front of the mirror , i 'll feel really great in the pieces that i want to buy . 
  if you wear your fiance , i 'd probably be very nervous to be around you !, 
  when i wanted to find work experience at pr companies in london i just emailed a lot of them requesting it , much like you would do for any other job . 
  there are a lot of pr and marketing companies in central london to write to , and you basically have to do the legwork yourself to try and fix one up , since as far as i know they do n't advertise work experience opportunities . 
  bear in mind though , london is expensive and i doubt she 'll be paid other than perhaps lunch expenses . 
  i certainly did n't get anything . 
  if she 's 18 and up she should be all right , 16 and up might have more difficulty . 
  anything younger than that is n't going to happen . 
  it might be the `` what if this is as good as it gets ? '', 
  worry . 
  she might be scared that if they cut everything off completely then she 'll never ever find anyone else again , and all of the stress and idiocy is worth having * someone * there , even if that someone is a jerk . 
  i build it up in small ways .
