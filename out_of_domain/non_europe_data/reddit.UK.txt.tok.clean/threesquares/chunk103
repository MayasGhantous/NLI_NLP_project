  liveships comes next , then tawny man . 
  you * can * skip liveships ( i did ) but there 's a reveal in tawny man that becomes much better once you know liveships events . 
  i just keep thinking `` this is only temporary , this will pass . '', 
  and it does !, 
  tomorrow is always another day , and things are never really as bad as they seem . 
  and then i go listen to [ avenue q : for now ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qox0pnqqgoa ) because it 's an adorable song about exactly that . 
  everything is only for now . 
  i always liked dumbledores line about perhaps sorting too early . 
  it 's very true !, 
  when i was on livejournal ( wayyyyyy back when ) there used to be whole sorting communities where you would give lengthy answers to a questionnaire and people would sort you based on that . 
  shame it 's gone the way of myspace and bebo now , really , otherwise i 'd link you over there !, 
  it 's a sign for sure !, 
  i probably spend most of my time going between / r/askuk and / r/fantasy, 
  and / r/tomhiddleston , of course . 
  trudi canavan 's * black magician trilogy * sounds right up your street . 
  it 's about a young street urchin , sonea , and the discovery of her magic powers which she , as a street urchin , probably should n't have . 
  it 's quite fun - not completely overwhelmingly amazing , but a fun ride and i like sonea as a character . 
  i ca n't even remember . 
  it was my dad that got me into fantasy , as he has shelves and shelves of books and i always loved the covers . 
  i remember just staring at the cover of [ tad william 's * dragonbone chair * ] ( http://amandacrossley.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/the-dragonbone-chair.jpg ) for ages and ages when i was really little . 
  the first fantasy i read was probably anne mccaffrey 's * pern * books , but i devoured terry pratchett too , and i know i really enjoyed [ tom holt 's * djinn rummy * ] ( https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/386849.djinn_rummy?from_search=true ) when i picked it up in the library too . 
  i 've just always had fantasy on my shelf , and i suspect my dad read * the hobbit * to me when i was little . 
  i love it !, 
  my name is the female form of my dad 's name ( in french ) . 
  well , it 's either that or my parents say they made it up . 
  oh , good idea . 
  i really liked thymara as a character and she definitely grows and develops . 
  op , it 's not completely from her pov or about her though , just in case that 's not what you 're looking for . 
  bus , overground , dfl are maybe your best options , with a shorter taxi trip to an alternative station ? 
  20 minute drive door to door down some pretty country lanes . 
  it 's lovely and simple . 
  when i was doing an internship in london a couple of summers ago it was a 10 minute walk  45 minute tube journey  10 minute walk . 
  i got through so many books . 
  one , because they do n't exist and two because i 'm a scaredy cat that does n't like anything remotely scary . 
   parrots that insist on mating with their owners, 
  i mean , i know my dog tries to hump my leg occasionally , but uh ... what ? 
  seriously ? 
  man , i love kids , but that ` what did n't you know about pregnancy ' thread in here at the moment has freaked me * out * . 
  child-bearing age has now pushed back at least another five years . 
  look , if you seriously * seriously * ca n't get over this , then just break up with her . 
  it 's only been two weeks , you 're not in it that deep . 
  just tell her it 's not working out for you and go find someone more to your taste . 
  the whole point of a dating is working out whether you 're suited to each other . 
  she 's not suited to you . 
  that 's okay . 
  the fool . 
  open university !, 
  i expect if you have n't finished uni and gained a degree you 'd be eligible for student loans to cover the module costs . 
  the ou is very much about independent working , and learning about how you study rather than pushing one form of study on you . 
  you can mix and match modules if you want to , and it means you can give yourself the training in science , engineering or it that you really want . 
  alternatively , just write to companies and offer yourself up for internships with them , or work experience . 
  it 's all about getting those cv credits behind you , and maybe if a company really likes you , they 'll offer you more paid shifts or even something better . 
  you have to do the legwork for this one , but it can pay off in the end . 
  my family have been taking cottage holidays using [ english country cottages ] ( http://www.english-country-cottages.co.uk/ ) for years and they have always been lovely places to stay . 
  the peak district is my favourite so far , and it 'll give you the peaceful down time you 're looking for . 
  i bought three new bras at the weekend and they were all # 20-25 from debenhams . 
  that 's about average for me . 
  so far , it seems like she 's made the bigger compromise with the location of the wedding , so give her some slack and let her have the party she wants . 
  personally , i think a swing band will appeal to more guests than a rock band too ( think of the grannies ! ) . 
  you could even buy some swing dance lessons for the two of you so you can have some real dances together , or a choreographed first dance together . 
  it 'll make it more fun for you and i expect it will pacify her a bit , too . 
  plus , swing is so fun !, 
  look just how cool [ these guys are ] ( http://youtu.be/axbkzpdorkq ) when they 're dancing , or [ these two doing lindy hop ] ( http://youtu.be/qqwzzofa7fq ) . 
  how cool would it be if you and your new wife whisked out something like that in front of all the family ? 
  [ so hot ] ( http://media1.giphy.com/media/kbgp6uiybohna/giphy.gif ), 
  [ oh stop , please , i 'm blushing . 
  ] ( http://37.media.tumblr.com/bdd12d09cd4f32d2bc59d14a7c63cda9/tumblr_mqeilj9kya1s8nxoao1_250.gif ), 
  it 's always been a toss up between sam vimes and vetinari for me . 
  they 're both so great to read . 
  i do agree that i think the ending was a little formulaic , but i did n't mind too much - he threw in enough twists for me to keep me happy . 
  which was the scene that bothered you ? 
  playing cuffs !, 
  i definitely enjoyed that bit . 
  i hope he fleshes out kest and brasti a bit more in the next book too - they 're very promising and i did really like the dialogue between the three of them , especially in the last part . 
  i do love bernard cornwell 's fight sequences . 
  he never glosses anything over , it 's very raw and real . 
  his * harlequin * series is excellent . 
  yeahhh ... i kept thinking exactly the same thing through the whole scene as well , actually . 
  it was a bit dodgy , and i 'm not sure it served that much purpose either . 
  i 'm quite glad [ at the end of it ] ( #s `` falcio says he doubted he 'd see her again '' ), 
  disowned * now * , but he helped write them in the first place , and then ` conveniently ' forgot that little fact . 
  i oppose them because i want us to stay in europe , and i think it 's good for us to be european instead of being isolationist . 
  also , they have a good track record of their members making complete fools of themselves , and i prefer my politicans to have a * little * bit of decorum when talking to the general public . 
  i 'm english and i love wine . 
  so do most women i know ( my mum , her friends , aunts , my friends , work colleagues ) . 
  it 's just really refreshing , it 's something that you can make last a long time and it 's yummy scrummy . 
  wine spritzers in particular are great . 
  plus , i do n't much like beer because it makes me bloat . 
  see my point about their members making fools of themselves . 
  usually it 's over something racist ; i.e. 
  ; ` bongo bongo land ' or whathisface who got disowned today over all his lovely racist tweets . 
  if farage wants to insist that they 're not a racist party he seriously needs to get his potential mps to shut up and sort themselves out , because all they 're doing right now is stomping hobnail boots all over his delicate little policies . 
  to be fair with [ the women part ] ( #s `` after he saves aline , all falcio does for the next forty eight hours is go from one fight to another . 
  i did kind of agree with her that he was being a total idiot and getting in fights for the sake of it when people could have actually helped them out . 
  she was traumatised enough and just looking for somewhere safe ; i 'd be pissy about seeing more fights too !, 
  plus , falcio told vionella forgothername that she was being a snotty little brat more than she insulted him . 
  and i got the impression that the tailor pretty much stomped over everyone all the time regardless of who they were . '' ), 
  i did like de castell 's treatment of women in general , though . 
  the tailor was great fun . 
  i do n't see you getting downvoted ... ?
