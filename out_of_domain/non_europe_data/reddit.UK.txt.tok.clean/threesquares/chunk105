  honestly , all of these are just doodle-type drawings but it makes the information so much easier to recall . 
  use bright colours , memorable images , rhymes . 
  the sillier the link is to something , the easier it will be for you to remember it - i 'll draw a big steak above some seats , for example , because it 's the rump parliament . 
  make it big and go through it often to refresh your memory . 
  that 's the key - little and often . 
  could . 
  not . 
  care . 
  less . 
  what . 
  men . 
  think . 
  makeup . 
  i wear it for ** me ** and so ** i ** feel good . 
  i do not look good without makeup - i look oily and spotty and tired . 
  makeup helps me look tidy . 
  i could not give a toss what the general man on the street thinks about my face paint , and i am single and looking . 
  uh - i do * generally * - you have cool spaces like askwomen and askhistorians , and the other ask subs like askuk or askeurope are full of nice people . 
  / r/fantasy is full of lovely bookwormy folk too so i always feel comfortable there . 
  other subs can annoy me quite a lot sometimes ; i was * so cross * with / r/relationships the other day for some really awful comments about ` slutty women ' and only being worth dating if your number is low , and i wanted to be righteously angry at loads of comments , but then was just like fuck it , it 's not worth the grief i 'd get back . 
  so sometimes i like reddit and sometimes it drives me nuts in the way that your little brother can be when he just wo n't shut up with the immature jokes . 
  unfortunately i do n't think there really is any way to tell . 
  i went on three good dates with a guy , thought we were doing great , slept with him and he vanished into the aether . 
  really * really * frustrating , and disappointing too . 
  heroin is never attractive to me , drug taking is never attractive to me and prior users are never attractive to me either . 
  so , basically , no . 
  a lesson it 's taken me a long time to learn :, 
  `` when you cut pieces out of the truth to avoid looking like a fool you end up looking like a moron instead . '', 
  -- robin hobb , * assassin 's apprentice *, 
  and one of my tattoos sums me up nicely , i think : dum spiro spero - while i breathe , i hope . 
  technically they should , but a lot of shops do n't accept it because they 're unfamiliar with it , and so do n't feel able to know whether it 's a forgery or not . 
  it drove me nuts when i would come home to essex from terms at my scottish university . 
  it was my birthday a month ago and i turned 29 . 
  i asked for day spa vouchers , booked it in advance and went to a loooooooooooovely spa with my best friend on the day of my birthday ( a friday ) . 
  on the saturday i spent it with the rest of my close friends and we went out to a gorgeous little tea cafe for the afternoon . 
  on the monday i went with my mum to london for the day and we went shopping in harrods and then had afternoon tea at the four seasons hotel . 
  so basically for my birthday i went swank . 
  it was * lovely * . 
  i was 16 . 
  very much the right age for me and at the right time . 
  no regrets at all . 
  welllll i 'm english so my preferred beverage is tea and when i drink coffee it 's generally just the instant stuff . 
  but in most cases it 's a splash of milk and one sugar . 
  i generally really do n't like alcoholic drinks that are too sweet , so i expect that it probably would n't be my cup of tea . 
  i like dry cider or rose wine spritzers more . 
  i 'd be open to trying some if i ever had a chance , though . 
  aw , i think that 's really sweet and i bet she 'd be quite chuffed to get it . 
  i am so . 
  * sick * . 
  of studying . 
  i 've only got a month to go of this academic year , but doing these last two assignments ( due next thursday ) are just taking five times the effort i have to give , and then i have a month of revision before exams in june . 
  i just want to read a book for fun !, 
  i just want to watch a dvd instead of staring at my textbooks . 
  i just want throw a big four-year-old paddy of `` do n't * wan na * '' but i know i have to sit down and do it . 
  i need a holiday . 
  that 's okay !, 
  it 's sort of a ` pleased with [ x ] action ' notion . 
  if someone gave me a gift i really liked i 'd be well chuffed , or if i passed an exam with flying colours i 'd be really chuffed . 
  that kind of pleased . 
  i did an informal survey of tea drinking on facebook once . 
  most of my friends drank anywhere up to 5 cups a day , but myself and a couple of other hardcore tea lovers had around a dozen cups a day . 
  * totally * not a stereotype , at all . 
  i tend to like music with either lots of rhythmic elements in or lots of brass . 
  most of my playlist is romantic-era classical music , film soundtracks or musical theatre songs . 
  good example : [ two steps from hell by nero ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbu4v-qy5ng&amp;feature=share&amp;list=plq-odljkgf8enk63riiwpzv6zsrdqw98j&amp;index=2 ) , the trailer music to the 2012 film anna karenina . 
  a gorgeous repeating percussive line just like train tracks and really sweeping strings and brass . 
  i * love * it . 
  the theme song to the [ avengers assemble ] ( http://youtu.be/y1fijmqv8mc ) film is perfect , too . 
  yup , for all of my school life . 
  primary was navy skirt , black shoes , white button shirt and a navy sweatshirt with the school logo on . 
  sometimes my mum made us wear a navy and yellow striped tie . 
  secondary school was much more casual than the other schools around us , thankfully . 
  the other schools all had to wear blazers and ties , but we had navy skirt/trousers , a light blue button up shirt for the first 3 years then a light blue polo shirt for the last 2 years and a navy sweatshirt with the school logo on . 
  the new headteacher has brought in a blazer and tartan skirt now , which looks far more formal than anything we had to wear . 
  i liked wearing uniform . 
  it meant i did n't have to think about what i was wearing day to day , and i always liked the feeling when i got home and changed out of it . 
  it meant it was the end of school time and the start of leisure time , and i liked that division between the two . 
  i did like people knowing i went to that particular school , too . 
  no , and it 's a word that gets thrown around for any number of actions or partners too , which irritates me immensely . 
  had a hundred partners ? 
  chatted to another guy while her boyfriend was n't there ? 
  god , what a slut . 
  had ten partners ? 
  still a slut . 
  started having sex young ? 
  she 's a slut mate , best steer clear of that one . 
  it 's a word used by guys ( and girls ) who are insecure about the sex that other people are having . 
  it 's aimed at making women uncomfortable with being cool with sex , and because there is no fixed definition ( other than ` promiscuous ' , which in itself seems difficult to define to me ) it means it can be thrown around willy-nilly to anything that people think is a ` bad ' sex habit . 
  so no , being a slut is not a bad thing . 
  ** calling ** someone a slut is . 
  i have a personal theory that maybe men feel more of a need to have a relationship than women do ? 
  i have very few single male friends and plenty of single female ones , personally . 
  maybe it comes down to the whole 'em otional disclosure ' thing where women feel more able to talk more freely about emotions and problems with peers , whereas men do n't seem to have that with their guy friends . 
  that could mean that some men feel like their only emotional outlet about being single is places like reddit ( where you see it more ) , whereas women can talk and get reassured about it privately . 
  i 'm the same . 
  i know my mum is * desperate * for me to find a ` nice man ' , but i 'd rather just do my own thing until the right guy comes along , rather than the first guy who comes along . 
  my friend had her pills fail . 
  i was attracted to them by looks initially and then had fun talking to them/hanging out with them . 
  hah , my dad keeps telling me to ` go have fun ! ', 
  too , but it 's not exactly easy to say to parents `` oh i 've had loads of casual sex already , i 'm bored of it now . '',
