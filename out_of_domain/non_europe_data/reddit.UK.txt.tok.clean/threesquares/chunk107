  oddly enough , working with actors . 
  i used to be an assistant stage manager , and sitting in a rehearsal room watching the performance unfold was one thing i loved . 
  they can be an irritating bunch sometimes , but actors are great fun to be around and can always keep you laughing . 
  oh man , farseer makes me cry but tawny man gets me bawling like a little baby . 
  i ca n't wait for * fools assassin * to get here !, 
  a couple of people i just have location tags , so / u/samtarlylovesmilk is ` londoner ' and / u/sehrah is ` kiwi ' . 
  i also have / u/cirocco as ` dog shower ( corgi ) ' and / u/skeed is ` hiddles ' - i 'm assuming we must have had a conversation at one point about the lovely tom hiddleston !, 
  i also tagged a few aw guys in the ` men of aw picture post ' hahahaha . 
  one is ` amazing shoulder muscles ' and another is ` looks like derren brown ' . 
  and one is ` totally totally gorgeous ' , so clearly i liked his photo a lot . 
  would n't care a bit . 
  i 'm straight and can appreciate a good looking woman , he would be totally free to admire hot men if he likes . 
  i do n't know what it is , he just likes to be up high . 
  we caught him trying to climb on top of the laundry basket once . 
  we also bring him into the office every day where he hides from monday [ mornings ] ( http://imgur.com/7hji7ix ) . 
  if it 's bothering you , * talk to her * . 
  explain what you 've said here , that you 're concerned not for the fact that you 're a strapping guy , but simply about the principle of hitting your partner in the first place . 
  you could look like rambo and it still would n't be okay to use physical force to get your point across . 
  i know you 've already told her once that it was unacceptable , but that was during an argument . 
  now is the time to discuss it maturely now that things have simmered down . 
  it 's okay to bring it up again since it 's clearly something that bothers you . 
  if she is genuinely remorseful about it , understands * why * you 're concerned , and makes a concerted effort not to be physical with you again , then i would say you can move on and let it lie . 
  if she brushes it off with the fact that it did n't hurt you and you 're bigger than her , then reconsider who you are dating and what might potentially happen in future arguments . 
  because ballet flats are light and cute , or maybe the ankle/calf boots i have do n't suit that outfit . 
  also , why not wear cute shoes ? 
  i wish i had little boobs . 
  you get to wear the cutest 20s style stuff !, 
  i dont have much choice . 
  i dont just have boobs , i have bazongas . 
  it 's cleavage or ugly frump for me . 
  we had a lecturer who put her own books on the ` required reading ' list , so it was compulsory to shell out for them . 
  it was a minutely small course too ( only 20 of us each year ) so there was no chance of getting it second hand and cheap either . 
  hah , well they shut down my course two years after i left ( bastards , we were a really great department ) , but it was queen margaret university in edinburgh and i was at the old drama school . 
  i ca n't remember them ever actually checking it was bought , but like i said , it was a * very * small course , my campus was separate from the main campus ( which i never ever went to ) and we were referencing and working from that book for at least the first two years . 
  it was just easier to buy it . 
  my course was vocational too , so it was more of a ` you do it this way ' guide rather than background reference material . 
  samsung galaxy s5 . 
  it 's all shiny and brand new and i loooove it . 
  i have never understood the male preoccupation of ` just brave through it ' . 
  what do you think us ladies do when we meet up with our girl friends ? 
  we * talk * . 
  we give advice . 
  we sympathise . 
  we complain about how much life sucks and our friends help make us feel better . 
  we do n't just pretend everything is okay all the time when we know our friends can give us the sympathy we need . 
  relationships are exactly the same . 
  your girlfriend , i 'm sure , would a ) not want you to suffer alone and b ) would feel awful if she thought everything was okay with you when actually you wanted to throw yourself of a cliff . 
  be honest with her . 
  ask her for advice . 
  she wo n't think any less of you for just being human . 
  my thighs feel realllly heavy , like they 've been doused in concrete , and my abdomen feels all tight , i guess . 
  it 's a really low , dull , persistent ache that just makes me want to grab a hot water bottle . 
  luckily my cup seems to actually help a lot with staving cramps off . 
  i 'm doing an ou degree in history at the moment and love it , and a friend of mine is doing one in programming at the same time . 
  my mum did her masters and a marketing degree through the ou too . 
  yes , they 're very well regarded as it shows you have good time management skills and that you 've committed yourself to something and seen it through . 
  the workload is not easy and you ca n't just skate through the work set . 
  everything i 've heard from employers says that they like ou students when they apply . 
  i 'd say definitely give it a go - i 'm so proud of what i 've achieved with them so far and the uni is very very supportive of its students . 
  ` onwards and upwards ' . 
  i say it all the time . 
  it 's a nice little positive motto no matter what 's going on . 
  like [ this ] ( http://riverisland.scene7.com/is/image/riverisland/649462_main?$crosssellproductpage514$ ) or like [ these ] ( http://riverisland.scene7.com/is/image/riverisland/650496_main?$crosssellproductpage514$ ) ( which are really cute , i want a pair ) or maybe heeled like [ these ] ( http://riverisland.scene7.com/is/image/riverisland/649757_main?$crosssellproductpage514$ ) ( also very desireable thank you please . ), 
  you 're not * wrong * on it ( per say ) , it just does n't make any sense to us . 
  what , exactly , are you proud of ? 
  that someone you never met and who existed a century ago happened to live in a different country and did some things that you think was kind of cool , and * maybe * happened to have a different personality to you ( that americans refer back to all the time ) ? 
  to me , as a brit , that 's sort of like talking about bread all the time because your great great great grandfather owned a bakery . 
  tolkien , fellowship of the ring . 
  * along this they fled . 
  frodo heard sam at his side weeping , and then he found that he himself was weeping as he ran . 
  * doom , doom , doom * the drum-beats rolled behind , mournful now and slow * ; doom !, 
  * they looked back . 
  dark yawned the archway of the gates under the mountain-shadow . 
  faint and far beneath the earth rolled the slow drum-beats : * doom . 
  * a thin black smoke trailed out . 
  nothing else was to be seen ; the dale all around was empty . 
  * doom . 
  * grief at last wholly overcame them , and they wept long : some standing and silent , some cast upon the ground . 
  * doom , doom . 
  * the drum-beats faded . 
  and one of my simple favourites from robin hobb :, 
  * `` beloved , i have missed your company . 
  it 's * kind * of configurable , but not really ? 
  you study a huge span of things , though and you do get choice in what you study . 
  there is one compulsory unit each year and one optional , and you get to choose your ` pathway ' - i 'm doing broad based history for example , and my aunt is doing the heritage pathway so there are slightly different courses . 
  next autumn is introducing a ba in classical studies too , if you like the ancients . 
  so for instance , my first year was aa100 arts past and present , which is a multi discipline compulsory module for all humanities students , not just history . 
  we studied cleopatra , divas ( maria callas , tina turner , some medieval choral works ) , the benin bronzes , victorian seaside holidays , pliny 's roman villa , the development of modern art , poetry , plato ... all sorts . 
  it helps give you an idea of what you enjoy studying and gives you a taster of content on other courses . 
  second year has one compulsory module , a200 exploring history : medieval to modern 1400-1900 and one optional module . 
  a200 is massive and goes from the wars of the roses to the reformation to the wars of the three kingdoms ( english civil war etc ) to slavery to the industrial revolution and empire . 
  i 'm writing my last assessment for it at the moment and it 's a hell of a slog but very good . 
  my optional is a219 exploring the classical world , which is all ancient greece and ancient rome and i * love * it . 
  i 'm tempted to switch to a classics pathway , but i 've already missed my chance to do the 2nd year latin module and i want to go into teaching , so i need to keep my options open . 
  my third year compulsory unit is going to be a307 war , peace , modernity which examines modern warfare from 1918 to the end of the cold war . 
  my optional is * probably * going to be a330 myths in the greek and roman worlds , which will take me back to classics again , but there is also an option of doing a module in scottish history in collaboration with the university of dundee if i wanted . 
  i * might * do that but i have n't made up my mind . 
  from what i also understand , 3rd year is like most unis and gives you more space to do independent study in areas that specifically interest you . 
  sorry , that turned into a bit of an essay !, 
  i hope it helps , though .
