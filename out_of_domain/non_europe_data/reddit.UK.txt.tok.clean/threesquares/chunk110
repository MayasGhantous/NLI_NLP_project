  i love light blues , especially ones in nautical themes . 
  when i lived in scotland i picked up saying ` aye ' and ` wee ' for a while . 
  i had to train myself out of it because , you know , an english girl with a well rounded rp accent saying ` aye ' just sounds stupid . 
  i worked as assistant stage manager for a while and was out on a touring musical production . 
  one of the actors ate coleslaw on stage every night , and one night the coleslaw i gave him was a few days out of date . 
  not green , not smelly , just not same day fresh . 
  i got the * biggest * bollocking for that , but at least i never made the same mistake again . 
  probably labour at this election and the next . 
  i 'm pro-eu , the lib dems are good at borough level but hopeless at national levels and i 'll do anything to get gove kicked out . 
  75 % scottish nationals !, 
  that 's handy , living in essex . 
  ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ am ^ ^ ^ desperate ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ get ^ ^ ^ back ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ edinburgh , ^ ^ ^ though ... 
  i booked an impromptu holiday to montreal once with a few friends . 
  ten days before i was due to go , every single one of them dropped out , and as it was a ten day holiday in a country i had never ever been to before , this was a big deal . 
  i panicked , then booked a hostel that looked fun , in what looked like a cool part of town . 
  it turned out to be the best thing i ever did - i made friends with two other brits in my dorm within the first half hour , we spent the whole ten days hanging out and had a brilliant time . 
  it 's still one of the best holidays i 've ever been on . 
  you never get the same camaraderie in hotels as you do in hostels , i do n't think . 
  sure , the hostel beds are n't quite as comfy and you have to share a bathroom but you 'll meet some absolutely amazing people and get invited all sorts of places . 
  * younger than me, 
  * has children, 
  * rude to service staff, 
  * bad personal odour . 
  please at least smell clean . 
  my dealbreakers vary . 
  i 've gone off someone before because he made it clear we had massively different approaches to money . 
  i 've gone off someone else because his personal taste in interior decoration was just copious amounts of beige . 
  the five above are the no chance every time ones though . 
  i did n't like my brothers so for ages because she was just wayyyyy too clingy . 
  hanging on to my friend/sibling just makes me think you 're desperate and/or codependant . 
  if a friends new so makes any kind of effort to try and join in with the rest of us , i.e. 
  they join in conversation then i expect we 'll all probably get along . 
  none of my friends are cliquey at all , we all like new people . 
  i go with my gut , and whatever instinct is telling me i 'll be happiest doing . 
  as someone who used to work in the distinctly un-financially stable world of theatre , the factor of money has never meant that much to me when deciding between options . 
  i go with what i 'm most drawn to , or alternatively i just do n't go with the option that feels ` off ' . 
  instinct is a powerful thing , use it . 
  oh god , mine was awful . 
  i was either 12 or 13 and in a military band with the scouts . 
  we went on a weekend trip to belgium ( of all places ! ), 
  to do some performances and stayed in a hostel on bunkbeds . 
  i woke up one morning to find my bed * covered * in blood . 
  not just a drip or two , a full on puddle of the red stuff . 
  i totally freaked and spent the next day or so stuffing tissue paper frantically down my knickers until i eventually confessed to a nice lady helper who took pity on me , gave me a pad and helped me with my sheets . 
  i was just mortified . 
  when i got home , my mum sorted me out , gave me a stack of pads and some paracetamol and showed me how to soak all of my rather massacred underwear . 
  [ rnli - royal national lifeboat institution ] ( http://rnli.org/pages/default.aspx ) . 
  i live in a very coastal area and have a few friends who are lifeboat crew . 
  they do amazing work all year round . 
  i would n't do it as i do n't date younger at all , and sometimes i think it 's odd if there 's a particularly large gap . 
  but hey , it 's not my relationship and if the two of them are happy and it 's a healthy partnership then kudos to them . 
  see , the thing is , i know it 's bull , and in every other area ( mediums , psychics , angels , god/s , ghosts , fairies , ouija , etc ) i 'm a complete skeptic . 
  but i still quite like astrology , and i quite like thinking `` oh , i 'm a typical aries '' , or `` oh , he 's a gemini , we 'll probably get along . '', 
  so no , i do n't actually believe in it and no , i do n't think it influences things in my life , and i definitely do n't read daily predictions . 
  it 's just that there 's some part of me that still quite likes the things that it says . 
   she will either become miffed , or modify the plan until the participants become guilted into going . 
  you do n't * have * to accept if you do n't want to go . 
  i know this is your boss , but if you do n't want to go for dinner just repeatedly and politely refuse . 
  take up some invitations , turn down others . 
  if it 's a lunchtime , use your work as an excuse . 
  if it 's an after school thing , say you need to get home to your family . 
  what 's she going to do , fire you for not going out to dinner ? 
  honestly , just stop being a doormat . 
  once one person refuses , other people will feel more confident in refusing too , and eventually she 'll stop being such a pain about it . 
  he verbally abused you . 
  he physically assaulted you . 
  he physically assaulted your animals . 
  he vandalised your property . 
  you were so scared you * locked yourself in a room to protect yourself *, 
  you are * not safe * . 
  it does n't matter whether it was the alcohol or not , or that he 's not like this sober . 
  you are ** not ** safe . 
  do you have family to go to ? 
  friends ? 
  please , please leave him and do n't look back . 
  goals can be anything . 
  they do n't have to be big life changing things , they can just be something you want to do or acquire at some point . 
  i set mine in short term , medium term and long term . 
  so ** short term ** for me ; pass exams , do dog shows , get back to gymnastics classes . 
  ** long term ** is complete teacher training , get a teaching job , visit new zealand , get mortage , get married . 
  you have a great relationship ? 
  amazing !, 
  would you like to get married one day ? 
  that 's a goal . 
  how about travelling ? 
  where would you like to go ? 
  do you want to ... i do n't know , upgrade your car at some point ? 
  live in a nice house ? 
  go to the moon ? 
  be able to hold a conversation with someone in french/mandarin/slovakian ? 
  those are all goals , and if it 's going to take you a while to do them , then use them as long term goals . 
  having wanderlust and enjoying the journey is great , but a journey also has a destination at the end of it , otherwise you 're just aimlessly drifting . 
  find your compass and point yourself at something . 
  anything . 
  travel , language , food , work , relationship . 
  whatever . 
  just give yourself something to do , or you 're never really going to grow . 
  yup . 
  i get along with pretty much everyone and can always find things to chat about with people . 
  i ca n't really think of anyone who i know does n't like me , and i suspect if i * did * know that , i would n't really care .
