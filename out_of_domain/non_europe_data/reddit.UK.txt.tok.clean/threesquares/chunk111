  yes , i guess it matters to me that people like me , but i 'm quite easy going and i do n't think i rub people the wrong way anyway . 
  i like firm handshakes . 
  droopy delicate dead fish handshakes feel ridiculous . 
  you 're not going to break my bones , seriously . 
  just shake , smile , let go . 
  i do n't have trouble finding good men to go on dates with - pretty much every date i 've been out on is with a good guy . 
  i just have n't found the right guy for me . 
  just because a guy is perfect long term relationship material and ticks off all of the criteria you 've listed , does n't mean he 's the right one to be in a long term relationship * with me * . 
  that tricky thing called ` chemistry ' also comes into play . 
  i ca n't force myself to like someone even if he could be the nicest guy in the world . 
  i 've met loads of ` good guys ' . 
  none of them have been * my * good guy so far . 
  i worked on a cruise ship for six months , if that counts ? 
  it was fun , the ports were amazing and i 'd probably go back and do a cruise as pax sometime in the future . 
  i 'd never work on one again though . 
  seriously ? 
  the girlfriend is holding the party . 
  you 're the ex . 
  the fact that you 're as pissed off as you are tells me that the girlfriend probably feels totally justified in not inviting you . 
  you need to back off and give this new relationship some room . 
  honestly , how would you feel if you were the girlfriend , she was the ex who still kept hanging around and she was angling to get to the birthday party you were organising ? 
  you can , and what 's more , you * have * to . 
  you 're complaining about the fact that he 's been sheltered from real life by parents giving him everything - well now , you 're doing exactly the same by not allowing him to fail on his own terms and doing everything for him . 
  he has to make these bad choices , because he has to grow as a person , and you ** have ** to let him . 
   he 's really been sheltered from how shitty the economy has been ( rich parents , funded degree and no debt ), 
  i paraphrased , but i assumed that 's generally what you meant . 
  spicy food . 
  i really * really * dislike spicy heat . 
  oh , and olives . 
  i do n't know what it is , but olives and i just ca n't get along . 
  they 've got such an odd taste to them . 
  my first degree was in theatre production , and i worked freelance as a lighting technician and stage manager for about seven years all in , so i used it pretty well . 
  now my new degree is in history and i 'm aiming to go into secondary school history teaching . 
  in the future i think i 'd like to pick up some latin study and maybe go on to a masters in classical civilisation , but that 's a long way off yet . 
  i hated maths . 
  i was just rubbish at it , and although i scraped a b in my gcses it really was just a scrape . 
  i would like to be better at it , but if i 'm faced with a maths problem that 's more complex than 5x5 i just freeze up and struggle to do any kind of calculation . 
  i think maths tends to be portrayed as more of a subject suited towards sciencey and engineering people , and science and engineering also tends to be seen as a masculine field . 
  it 's rubbish of course - i have girl friends doing high level chemistry , biology and technical sphere academics or employment , but it 's a hard worldview to break . 
  lack of independence . 
  i 'm 29 and living at home to save money while i study for a second degree , and it 's less than a year before i ( hopefully ) leave forever for teacher training , but oh my god i miss just doing my own thing . 
  i 'm craving it . 
  my parents are great and i have no limits or curfews of any kind , but that does n't stop me desperately needing my own space . 
  have a slightly chilly room . 
  i always have my windows open in summer to keep a breeze in . 
  i do n't think i 'm distracting myself from anything by letting air circulate ... 
  the only time i ever say something along those lines is if i help someone out and they say to me `` gosh threesquares , you 're amazing '' to which `` i know ! '', 
  in a self depreciating way usually gets a laugh . 
  but otherwise `` i already know that '' is just being smug when you 're being given a compliment . 
  just say thanks . 
  have you heard of [ center parcs ] ( http://www.centerparcs.co.uk/ ) before ? 
  it 's a self contained holiday village where you stay in villas , no cars are allowed , there 's free swimming for the kids , activities all day long , a fabulous spa for you and the wife , and restaurants to eat out in on site . 
  they do long weekend breaks ( fri-mon ) and weekday breaks ( mon - fri ) and it works out about # 100 a person plus additional costs for eating/activities . 
  i 've been several times with my family and once with a group of friends and they are great fun . 
  prices can be good if you 're savvy about it and it 's very worth the money . 
  if you 're in the south east , elveden is probably your closest one , which is just north of bury st edmunds in suffolk . 
  definitely give it a try !, 
  no problem !, 
  the good thing about center parcs is that you can do as much or as little as you like , and the subtropical swimming paradise is completely free so you can spend as much time in it as you want . 
  even if you spend the whole weekend hanging out together in your villa , playing boardgames and watching the wildlife with occasional swimming you still get a really nice , peaceful holiday out of it . 
  to save a bit more money we usually bring our own dinner like spag bol for the first night , picky bits like quiche and salad for the saturday lunch and some breakfast cereals . 
  that means you 're only paying for saturday dinner , sunday lunch and sunday dinner , and even then you 've got a supermarket on site and restaurants that do relatively inexpensive stuff like burgers , chips and pancakes . 
  hey , i just like it is all . 
  a good alternative to your breathing exercise is tensing each part of your body as hard as possible , going gradually ( feet upwards ) until you 're entirely stiff , then letting the tension go from each area in reverse and unwinding all the way down . 
  it 's very relaxing . 
  although you apply for your pgce in a specific subject ( eg history or english ) , once you 've got it it just means that you 're qualified to teach , not that you 're qualified specifically to teach history . 
  you could apply for english , history or german positions if you want - i expect you 'd have the most luck getting an mfl position , though . 
  also , just to make you aware , though you have to have a pgce to teach in state schools , independent ( private ) schools and free schools can take you on without one if they think you 're a good candidate . 
  www.tes.co.uk is one of the best resources for teaching jobs , so keep an eye on that . 
  it depends what those compromises are , i suppose . 
  i 'm pretty independent and i do n't think there 's much i need to change about myself to manage a relationship . 
  i 'm sure as i 'm 29 and single my parents would disagree , but hey . 
  i 'll always make time in my schedule for a promising relationship , but it depends entirely on what else i 'd need to ` fix ' to be with a particular guy . 
  `` only for now '' - avenue q , or the more literary `` this too , shall pass . '', 
  oh , also i love this line by robin hobb : `` when considering a man 's motives , remember you must not measure his wheat with your bushel . 
  he may not be using the same standard at all . '', 
  it 's very true . 
  not particularly . 
  beauty is subjective after all , and 99 % of the time conventionally attractive women have the same old hang ups as the rest of us ` average ' women - nose could be smaller , hair could be shinier , wish she could lose those few pounds from her hips/thighs/wherever . 
  the only time i 've ever felt out of place around pretty girls is when my public school uni flatmate brought her public school friends to our flat one night and they were ridiculously well spoken , impeccably groomed and * far * more self confident than i ever was . 
  but that said more about my uni insecurities than how pretty they were , and i know full well they took about two hours each morning to do their hair and makeup . 
   i really love this girl , we have a fantastic relationship and are extremely close . 
  well to be honest , it ca n't be * that * fantastic if you spend your free time paranoid and snooping . 
  i do n't care if you were bored , spying on your partner is ** not ** a good way to pass the time . 
  why did n't you just put a film on or go out the house for a while ? 
  what on earth made you decide that a quick twenty minutes of password cracking was a good way to spend your time ? 
  * you * are going to be the one to ruin this ` fantastic ' relationship if you keep spying on your girlfriend . 
  you know what you find when you pry into other peoples things ? 
  bad news and stupid secrets you had no business poking your nose in to . 
  confess to your girlfriend that you hacked into her private messages , tell her to change her passwords and then * leave it alone * . 
  it does n't even matter that she is talking to this guy - at this point she is doing nothing wrong . 
  you 're the one with the problem . 
  you fix it . 
  i would partly assume that the fact he lost out on two potential promotions is affecting his drive towards getting anything better at the moment . 
  it 's great that he followed you to help you out , but i wonder if the fact that his two chances at a higher salary were lost by moving means he 's wondering if it 's even worth the effort going for it a third time . 
  after all , would you move again for your career ? 
  would he lose another good job again ? 
  he should absolutely not have lied to you about applications , but i would also sit down and talk to him about * where * this apathy is coming from . 
  employers clearly like him , so what 's he scared of this time around ? 
  figure that bit out first .
