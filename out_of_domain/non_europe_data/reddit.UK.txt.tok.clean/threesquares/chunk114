  i 've never heard that expression before , but i am a brit and it looks like you 're american . 
  what did you actually say in your comment ? 
  it can make me feel sad and a bit lonely sometimes , definitely . 
  i just keep reminding myself that it tends to be the same old same old ` happy ' lot that keep posting things , though , and not everyone i know is married/pregnant/babied / promoted wildly . 
  sounds like she was just being upfront about it and it took you by surprise . 
  i would assume that if a guy was asking me if i was seeing someone then he would either be interested in me sexually or romantically , and she was setting her boundaries . 
  be surprised if you want , but i think being offended is taking it a bit far . 
  i 'm doing a lot of studying right now and i can only do it to classical music , or to film scores . 
  anything with lyrics distracts me . 
  i normally stick on [ classic fm ] ( http://www.classicfm.com ) and just listen to that while i 'm working . 
  i would like to think so . 
  cheating once is hardly a ` freebie ' that you can just get away with . 
  i think it 's mostly fine , and i have a few friends who have this , but i do think it 's sensible to have some kind of back up skills or education * just in case * the relationship fails . 
  go into it with both eyes open . 
  you always want to make sure you can look after yourself in any scenario . 
  run a small business on the side , do a part time distance learning course , volunteer , whatever - just make sure you 've got something you can keep on your cv as a backup . 
  so just ask him about it . 
  next time he comes over , just say `` look , i 'm getting really mixed messages from you and i 'm confused . 
  what 's going on ? '', 
  i personally think it sounds like he 's changed his mind about you and is flirting , but if you 're certain that he 's not into you , then it 's something that you need to clear up . 
  otherwise you 'll just be dancing around each other for months , and that 's just exhausting . 
  a friend of mine was training at [ east london gymnastics ] ( http://www.eastlondongym.co.uk/about/pricelist ) last week in the run up to an adult beginners competition at basingstoke . 
  apparently it 's got some really nice facilities and a new air track . 
  worth having a look maybe . 
  its ... complicated . 
  really . 
  as in , still massively ongoing problems complicated that mostly boils down to religious conflicts between catholics and protestants . 
  it 's still causing a lot of difficulties that probably are n't going to be resolved any time soon . 
  [ this bbc article about the troubles ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/troubles ) might help to explain in a bit more detail . 
  edit : [ here is another ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/recent/troubles/overview_ni_article_01.shtml ) bbc article about the historical background to the division of ni and roi . 
  why on earth do you think it was voluntary to join a harem ? 
  having mistresses is another thing entirely , and yes , in a lot of cases ( like ... anne boleyn or nell gwynt ) it was for gain of status within a court . 
  if you were favoured by a monarch then you got loads of plus points and so did your family - the boleyns got all sorts of dukedoms and high court positions out of it . 
  but harems ? 
  they were just slaves . 
  zero choice about anything .

  nope . 
  the idea of being able to drive through a red light is quite bizarre . 
  why is it that a sign saying ` stop ' means stop , but a red light means ` stop , except in the cases where you do n't have to stop ' . 
  i do sales and make around # 1000 a month . 
  i 'm a full time student at the same time and get nothing out of that , wah . 
  i 'd expect him to be the better man and ignore the shouter . 
  idiots are always going to be idiots , and the best response is just to ignore them . 
  squaring up to them is just going to end up with someone getting hurt and no one being satisfied by anything . 
  by the way , it 's an incredibly sad , pathetic thing for that man that the only way he could feel ` cool ' was by shouting insults across the street at a girl and a guy he 'd never met before . 
  and from the safety of his car , no less . 
  what a brave , selfless thing to do . 
  the best response is to walk on , stay cool , and laugh at his cowardly little big man act later on . 
  welll ... it might * seem * all right , but long commutes can seriously screw with you , especially when it gets to winter time , and especially when your day has been a long and stressful one . 
  do n't underestimate the power of seeing * some * sunlight during the day . 
  you then get to drive for 90 minutes , and what happens if there 's a traffic jam , or bad weather ? 
  80 miles for me is ( near ) colchester to huntingdon , and i would be really really hesitant about doing that drive every single day . 
  plan out your day . 
  assume it 's 110 minutes for a normal 9-5 day . 
  wake up : 6:30, 
  arrive : 9:00, 
  work, 
  leave : 5:00, 
  arrive home : 6:40, 
  by the time you 've had dinner ( 7:30 ) , you 've got , what , three or four hours before you 're falling into bed . 
  where 's your social life ? 
  time with partner , friends , kids ? 
  if you 're at work until 8pm , you then need to drive until 9:40 pm . 
  are you going to be safe on the road ? 
  if you think you can hack it , by all means tell them that , but personally i would suggest being open to relocating if necessary . 
  it is one of the ` worst ' swearwords and you certainly wo n't hear it outside of 18 certificates , but i would n't say it 's nuclear . 
  it 's definitely not on the same level as jerk or idiot at all . 
  edit : it 's always seemed funny to me that it 's such a drastic word , too - you 've got christopher marlowe using ` cunny ' all the way back in 1593 according to the oed . 
  you would have thought it would have lost a bit of sting by now . 
  i 'm not my dads property to give away . 
  michael buble 's voice makes me melt . 
  and he 's so nice !, 
  [ this video ] ( http://youtu.be/_cw1ulvsl1y ) just makes me lurve him like a little girly girl . 
  honestly , and in the nicest way possible , i do n't think anything about it . 
  so you like guys and girls , good stuff . 
  more power to you . 
  i think it 's really cool that you 've told your friends and you 're okay with being who you are . 
  yes , there are a lot of people who say it does n't exist , or that you 're being ` greedy ' , but who cares ? 
  your love life does n't affect them . 
  you deal with who * you * are , and let them deal with who they are . 
  i would suspect that as many women leave partners for ` better looking ' men ( which is totally subjective , btw ) as men leave their partners for younger , prettier girls . 
  which is also subjective . 
  and i would also suspect that even if a man has the looks of brad pitt in oceans eleven , if he 's a total jerkwad then he 's going to have women leaving him for someone else . 
  i would * also * suspect that these better looking work colleagues you 're talking about have more confidence , and get themselves noticed by other people who might fancy them . 
  maybe the unnoticed ones are too insecure , or not confident enough to join in with the ` cool ' one , so they do n't get picked out as much . 
  her characters are just the most wonderful , intricate creations ever . 
  they become your best friends and stay with you for such a long time after you 've put the book down . 
  i think she 's brilliant . 
  are those * seriously * your answers to those questions ? 
  and i 'm single , but i 'd ask those apart from the ` if i died ' one . 
  why should n't i invite a boyfriend shopping or ask how he knows someone ? 
  sorting out washing . 
  i like putting it in colour piles for the washing machine , and i like sorting out ` mine ' and ` theirs ' when it 's warm out of the tumble dryer . 
  i 'm re-reading the tawny man trilogy at the moment ahead of the new fitz & fool release in august . 
  i did n't re-read way of kings before getting words of radiance , but i did read a summary . 
  so , it varies . 
  i 'm re-reading tawny man at the moment and falling in love with the fool all over again .
