  i 'm actually entered in my first gymnastics competition for about a months time , so i 'm picking up extra sessions and training hard for that , and i love it . 
  swimming is great for joints too as you 're supported by the water rather than applying pressure from the ground . 
  16 and it lasted about a year , maybe a year and a half . 
  he cheated on me with my ( then ) best friend a few times . 
  it 's just been very short term stuff for me since then . 
  do n't worry , i 'm the same and i 'm 28 . 
  it 's only been really short term flings for me since i was 18 . 
  / sadpandafriends, 
  oh it 's just the usual family defence thing springing into action . 
  i can moan all i like about how my mum nags and drives me up the wall , but if anyone else who 's not my brother or dad says anything , they are completely wrong . 
  does he want a social life ? 
  does he want to go out and meet people ? 
  your dad is a grown man , he can do exactly as he likes . 
  maybe he likes being introverted . 
  just because you like going out and having a social life does n't always mean that he does . 
  i 'm not sure how it can be discourteous that she 's been introduced to her husband 's children when she 's also invited you to visit so he can meet you . 
  someone has to meet each other first , after all . 
  either way , it 's none of your business . 
  your mum obviously misses having company and is lucky to have found someone else to love and support her later on in life . 
  would you really rather she played the sad little widow part first ? 
  she ca n't sit around in a family home that used to house five people all by herself for a few more years until you personally decide it 's okay for her to go and be in a relationship again . 
  be happy for her , commiserate with her about how much you miss your father , go meet this new man and then get on with your own marriage and your own life . 
  it must be hard losing your father and then all of a sudden having a new man introduced to your family in such a short space of time . 
  i am sorry about that . 
  the thing is , different people have different grieving periods , and it might be that your mum just wants to pick herself up and get on with her own life , now that your dad is gone . 
  do n't take it out on her or her new husband , but also do n't make yourself feel like you * have * to be new happy clappy families again . 
  it 's okay if it takes you a while to adjust . 
  best of luck . 
  1 ) decided he 's attractive enough to sleep with, 
  2 ) had a good kiss, 
  3 ) found somewhere 3a ) fun or 3b ) comfortable . 
  a multivitamin with iron when i 'm particularly run down ( which happens a lot ) . 
  i have the occasional single iron boost as well to get me going again . 
  totally agree . 
  op , if i want examples of good relationships i do n't go looking up agony aunt letters . 
  in all honesty , i 'll probably look on facebook instead where everyone is happy and every relationship is amazing . 
  ( bleugh ) . 
  it 's the same here . 
  people are far more likely to publicly talk about things going wrong than things going right . 
  exactly this - she 's a girl with her own mind and own decisions . 
  do you trust her to turn the guy down if he tries to ask her out ? 
  then there should be no problem . 
  do you think she 'd accept if he asked her out ? 
  then there is a problem . 
  i 'd be a bit confused but maybe give it one more date . 
  if there was n't a kiss or a move towards one by either of us i 'd let it go . 
  ** best at : ** reading fast !, 
  i basically skim read , which is a good thing and a bad thing . 
  also , i 'm apparently pretty good at creative and academic writing . 
  ** worst at : ** being patient . 
  especially when i 'm hungry . 
  i get irritable and short tempered when i 'm kept hanging around . 
  especially when you 're in a group , the group decides we 're all going to do something and then * never goes anywhere * . 
  i 'm the sort of person who tries to shoo everyone out the door just so we can do something . 
  ** proud of : ** my independence . 
  i 'm happy to go and do lots of things all by myself , including travelling abroad , and i think that 's pretty damn cool . 
  ** ashamed of : ** how i self-sabotage , especially with work . 
  i 'll not always follow up things that could be really amazing because i get so nervous about being told off or turned down . 
  my puppy dog , henry . 
  it 's a goofy picture of him sat on one side of a doorway looking all pathetic in the way that only english setters can do , and it just makes me smile . 
  awwwww !, 
  he 's so cute !, 
  nope , i 'm an english lady . 
  three dates just always seemed sensible in my head - one to be all excited , two to see if there 's actually still chemistry once the nervousness has gone away and three to act on said chemistry if it had n't been done by date two . 
  most definitely !, 
  it 's been about three years out of choice for me , and i 'm starting to see a new guy who makes me want to do the bumpin ' uglies , but it makes me so nervous that i 'm going to just totally forget how to do everything and be bad at it . 
  eeek . 
  i 'm sure that 's not the case ( and practice makes perfect ) , but i 'll be over here worrying about it the same as you . 
  i 'm assuming he has res . 
  the total score is hidden but you still see number of up/downvotes anyway . 
  i would assume at the very least it puts a strain on finances if there 's only one main source of income , unless that main source is a very * good * line of income . 
  does n't matter . 
  she obviously likes it , otherwise she would n't take the job . 
  i used to work in theatre production , and if any industry has unsociable hours theatre is it . 
  i absolutely had my nose to the grindstone for years to get my career off the ground ; zero social time , hardly any money , no reliability of work , major stress most of the time . 
  but the thing is , * i * loved it , and i * wanted * to put in the hours to get somewhere . 
  if someone told me my work would n't get me anywhere , i 'd just straight up ignore them . 
  that 's exactly what she 's doing here ; she 's ignoring you because she obviously wants to get somewhere in her industry and because she does n't want to think she 's putting in all of these hours for nothing . 
  the only thing you can do here is either suck it up and see it through while she works it out , or tell her it 's not working for you and walk away . 
  i doubt very much she 's going to drop the job for you . 
  also , stop with the ` realism ' here . 
  she does n't want to hear that you think fashion is a dead end . 
  she wants you to * support * her . 
  try it . 
  but that 's what you do , unfortunately - you take the next job to move forward and make contacts , then the next one and then the next one . 
  and i 'm sure in her eyes going forward in the job she had trained to do was better than advancing in the one she 'd just taken as a filler . 
  it 's a really hard decision to walk away from something you trained specifically to do , and i found i could only do it when i simply burned out on it . 
  i still love theatre , but i just ca n't work in it any more because i now want stability . 
  but i still worked my arse off for seven years ( including training ) to realise that . 
  give it a chance . 
  you said it yourself she 's only done four days there and she 's testing out how she feels . 
  she might decide the stress is n't worth it , or that fashion definitely is n't for her , you just do n't know . 
  maybe go and buy a good bluetooth system for her car as a present so you can have clearer conversations while she drives home . 
  maybe help her do chores on weekends and go out to coffee with her while you 're there . 
  there are lots of ways you can work around this . 
  it sounds like she 's under a lot of pressure right now - i 'm fairly certain she would appreciate not having more coming from you . 
  i imagine to her it 's very much an `` it 'll be worth it '' scenario - she 's making crappy money now , but she 's doing it in the right industry , so it 's worth it to make the contacts and get noticed by the right people . 
  believe me , i sympathise - the bottom rung of the arts industries is * crap * . 
  but you have to start there to get anywhere . 
  kiss kiss bang bang will always be on my all-time favourites list .
