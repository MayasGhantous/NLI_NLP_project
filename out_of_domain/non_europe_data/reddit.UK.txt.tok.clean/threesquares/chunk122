  it 's very rare for english police to be armed , and i 'm sure you already know about our strict gun laws . 
  personal self defence items like pepper spray or tasers are also not permitted for the public at all . 
  i think what you need to bear in mind is that we see government very differently from us citizens . 
  we * expect * the government to have a major hand in things - the post office ( even though it 's been sold off ) , the nhs , the national rail , and in fact most major problems here are referred back to the government ; i.e. 
  `` well , the government should do something about it . '', 
  there is much more expectation that the major political parties will manage what is going on in the country , and that smaller local governments will bumble along and bungle it up most of the time . 
  that also links in to things like cctv , which i imagine you as an american will file more on the ` intrusive ' side of things than we do , and the whole nsa/gchq revelations , which as a whole went down without that much interest over here . 
  no one was that shocked ( or even that bothered ) that the government is/was spying on personal communications here because , well , they 're the government . 
  so really , if you 're looking for a place where you have the whole american idea of independent self preservation , you 're not going to find it here . 
  our government is probably far more hands on in every day life than yours is . 
  but as for aggressive gun happy policing , you 'll get less of that over here too . 
  it just depends which one is more important to you , i suppose . 
  guardians of the galaxy !, 
  i loooooove comic action adventure and it looks like so much fun !, 
  i 'm not sure . 
  wikipedia says they are employed to deal with service personnel but can assist the civilian police force as well - i know they 've certainly helped out with rowdy nights in colchester where squaddies get involved . 
  the article [ is here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/royal_military_police ) . 
   royal military police personnel are not constables under uk law and do not have any specific police powers over the general public , only whilst dealing with service personnel . 
  however , the rmp can utilise the powers , available to all persons in england and wales , under section 24 ( a ) of the police and criminal evidence act 1984 ; which allows any person to arrest any individual they have reasonable grounds to believe is committing , or has committed , an indictable offence , and that a constable is not available to perform the arrest . 
  [ 5 ] they are allowed to use such force as is reasonable in the circumstance to achieve this . 
   rmp personnel sometimes have powers , conferred by military lands byelaws , to give lawful directions to civilians who are on ministry of defence land affected by such byelaws . 
   a member of the royal military police can arrest any individual in the uk whom he has reasonable grounds to believe to be a serving member of hm armed forces and he has committed a relevant civil or military law offence . 
  if they recommend 2 hours , give it two hours . 
  it 's much better to be sitting around by your gate with 45 minutes to spare than rushing through security panicking . 
  the two hours recommended time is from checking in and does n't include travel from wherever you 're staying . 
  it 's not easy to answer the question about security wait time because it depends on how big the queues are to get through the scanners . 
  someone else will be able to say how busy it normally is at 5pm on weekdays . 
  so , i do n't know how last minute you like to be , but if i was flying i would allow 2 hours ; 15 minutes walk ish from the train station to the terminal and then 1/2 hours to get checked in , go through security , get a cup of tea and then go find my gate . 
  it would be a dealbreaker for me i 'm afraid . 
  i love kissing and i love long , indulgent make out sessions . 
  i would n't be happy with only brief , occasional kissing at all , and i think a perfunctory ` here you go ' kiss is almost worse than nothing at all . 
  but hey , i 'm sure there 's a partner out there for you who is exactly the same . 
  i 'd love a detached georgian house someday ; something like [ this house ] ( http://www.rightmove.co.uk/property-for-sale/property-21757527.html ) in suffolk . 
  i love the geometric dimensions of georgian houses , the light and space of them and the way they always have so much land . 
  also , someday i will live in my own [ edinburgh townhouse ] ( http://www.rightmove.co.uk/property-for-sale/property-46174031.html ) because they are * beautiful * . 
   if she had a choice she 'd have chosen me . 
  well then , she clearly did n't * have * a choice , did she ? 
  her parents said `` you are marrying our choice '' and it looks like that 's what she did . 
  what on earth do you think a bitter facebook message is going to change here ? 
  i suspect she did n't want the marriage either , but felt like she had to do it . 
   she honestly lacks the ability to say no to her parents , her whole life has been controlled by them from the very start . 
  and that would be why . 
   warning though - as someone who lives in a period property - make sure you get double glazing !, 
  hahaha yeah , most definitely !, 
  i lived on a third floor edinburgh tenement while i was at uni , and while it was gorgeous , oh my * god * it was cold in january . 
  i would live under about three duvets at a time !, 
  it can be . 
  for rent in the centre of town you 're generally looking anywhere between # 250 a month at the * very * best ( that 's what my friend pays to live with her boyfriend on the shore in leith ) up to about # 500 / # 600 in certain areas of the new town . 
  you can get somewhere decent for about # 400 a month i reckon , maybe a bit cheaper if you go in as a single room to rent with flatmates rather than living on your own . 
  well , it 's so nice that your boyfriend seems to have decided that it 's after five years that he needs to ` do ' the relationship right . 
  it 's a shame that he 's got off on totally the wrong foot by being an insecure jackass about it . 
  you sleeping with someone else while you were not in a relationship is not an insult on his manhood . 
  you know , even in strong sunlight it would n't put an itty bitty shadow on his ` manhood ' , it 's that insignificant . 
  when you are not in a monogamous relationship with someone , you have the right to have one night stands with whoever you please . 
  he may like the idea of being a mans man with a domestic goddess virgin sweetheart , but this is reality , and the reality is you are 28 years old with a relationship that has never actually worked out . 
  i would suggest to your boyfriend that he really needs to grow up and get over himself , and i would also suggest to you that you know exactly why this arrangement has never worked , and never * will * work . 
  as he grows , he 's going to get * more * stuck in his ways , not less . 
  either he does an abrupt about turn , or i 'd recommend you go looking for a man who does n't mind that a woman can have no strings sex , and does n't expect you to be stuck in the kitchen making his dinner all day . 
  to control my acne . 
  it 's working well so far !, 
  oh god , i know . 
  i do n't know how anyone stands to live in london when they 're paying such stupid amounts for the tiniest , pokiest places . 
  i have zero jealousy for any of my london friends at all . 
  well , i went on a date with a guy a few weeks ago that said he 'd been chronically single . 
  actually , the fact that he admitted that to me on date 1 was a bit off putting - not because i mind dating long term singles , but because he said i was the first * date * he had been on in several years . 
  that was a hell of a pedestal to be put on straight away . 
  so essentially , he was very nice , incredibly intelligent , self sufficient , well travelled ; great on paper . 
  except that when i met him , the total reek of desperation and craving to impress me was exhausting . 
  he tried so hard that almost nothing was easy or natural , and when he kissed me at the end there was sub zero chemistry of any kind . 
  it was a date that could have been lovely , but ended up just being a depressing failure . 
  re-read robin hobb 's ** tawny man ** . 
  still heartbreaking . 
  still totally ca n't - put-down material , especially the second half of fools fate . 
  i just love those books , and i 'm so excited for fools assassin in august !, 
  ** prince of fools ** by mark lawrence . 
  i really enjoyed it !, 
  the last part felt like a norse saga , and though i did n't really like jal very much as a character i did like his story and the development of his friendship with snorri . 
  i 'll definitely be picking up the next in the series . 
  ** the handmaids tale ** by margaret atwood . 
  this is one of those classics that i 've always meant to get around to , and i * finally * read it . 
  it was ... okay . 
  it did n't blow me away . 
  i actually struggled to keep reading for the first third or so , and it was n't until events turned a little more subversive that i really started to enjoy it . 
  i think some of the set ups like the ceremony were a bit too out there and forced , which jarred with the stuff i * could * see happening , like the wall . 
  i 'm glad i 've read it , but that 's about it . 
   it 's just that all i hear is `` i want a perfect , confident guy '' around the net, 
  that 's your problem . 
  internet talk is not real life . 
  switch the computer off , leave the room , go pick up a hobby and * meet * people . 
  women are exactly the same as men when it comes to relationships and we face all of the same problems as you do . 
  we 're not a special , seperate species who can just click our fingers at a guy and have him come to heel . 
  we have to make effort too !, 
   why is it that they can just go and live their life without worrying about relationships because they will get asked out sooner or later and can then take a pick , which will inevitably lead to perfect happiness ? 
  tell my mother that !, 
  i 'm 29 and single with a history of short , unsuccessful relationships and she utterly * despairs * of when i 'm going to get coupled up . 
  i 'm sure she would love it if i could just walk outside , pick a guy and turn on my perfect happiness switch . 
  i have to make the * effort * to meet men - prince charming is not going to turn up on my doorstep tomorrow and sweep me off my feet . 
   why is it they do n't need `` confidence '' , `` dependability '' and so on to find a partner and to get through life ? 
  they just get into relationships and then happy , without all the `` working on one 's self '' beforehand . 
  relationships do n't exist in isolation .
