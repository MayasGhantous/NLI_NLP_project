  you ca n't just get in one and then be happy forever and ever amen . 
  just go have a scroll through the trainwreck dysfunction zone that is / r/relationships to see what i mean . 
  sure , plenty of women are completely insecure and in a steady , happy relationship that helps support them , but personally i want to be the best , most confident , most well rounded person i can be first . 
  op , have you recently been dumped ? 
  the bitterness is just oooooozing out of your post . 
  i would n't dump a guy for being a virgin . 
  i would dump him if he was a virgin and it was all he was focused on , because that 's unattractive . 
  i also would then not jump into a ` studs ' bed because , well , i 'm not attracted to cocky ` studly ' guys . 
  they 're usually idiots . 
  ripping apart insecure people is inconsiderate because it does n't actually * fix * anything . 
  if anything , it makes them even more insecure . 
  men and women should both be encouraged to be more confident in themselves . 
  and you 're right , no women wants a man child , but that 's not our problem as the girlfriend . 
  it 's the guys problem to root out and fix . 
  i also think assigning ` submissive ' and ` dominant ' roles out of a deliberately bdsm relationship is daft . 
  everyone should switch things around and have fun . 
  finally , please do n't visit trp . 
  stick with the sane people . 
  depends how much i like the guy and how well the date has gone . 
  i do n't have any hard and fast rules for what should happen when . 
  i normally like a kiss at the end , and i 've had full makeout sessions at the end of great first dates before , but that 's never a guarantee . 
  sex can wait for date 3-ish , but i 'm not opposed to finishing d1 with a horizontal tango if we * really * like each other . 
   but of course that is the man 's fault for being such a fool as to show nerves about something in front of his girlfriend , thus revealing his essential weakness and insecurity . 
  what ? 
  no , that 's ridiculous . 
  if anything , i wish * more * men would show us that they 're a little more human and insecure !, 
  it 's okay to be nervous about something - it 's not okay to let that rule your life . 
  by the sound of it , your anxiety is totally ruling your life . 
  you need to talk to someone professional , not to random internet forums . 
  your issues are bigger than we can handle , to be perfectly honest . 
  just try and remember that us women are not all total man stomping monsters who want butch hairy alpha males . 
  we 're normal too , just like you . 
  ` hallelujah ' in shrek . 
  perfect choice of song for that scene . 
  high on the crown , stuck down on the sides , parting every which way . 
  i have a long-ish bob so it tends to get all mussed up on top and flat further down . 
  aww puppy !, 
  what breed are they ? 
  it 's great that you do n't care , but * he * cares , and in a relationship it 's just good manners to be considerate of your partners feelings . 
  he 's not asking very much of you . 
  you 're totally apathetic about nude photos . 
  he 's not . 
  to take a different tack on it , you 're only 19 . 
  you might not care * now * that people have nude photos of you on the internet , but in six , seven , eight years you might well feel differently . 
  those photos will always be out there , no matter what , and you ca n't get them back . 
  lots of employers already google their candidates - what if you 're going for something important and these photos get traced back to you ? 
  at least one person already knows that they are of you , after all . 
  i would really really caution you to be considerate about who you 're giving these photos out to and why . 
   normalcy does n't create attraction , does it ? 
  of course it does . 
  next time you go to the supermarket or whatever , have a look at the couples walking past you . 
  all of them . 
  do n't dismiss any of them . 
  90 % of those guys and 90 % of the girls you will see in a couple are totally average , next door joe , every day people . 
  for what it 's worth , i 'm a pretty average girl and i 'd never want to date a ceo rock star . 
  how much * pressure * would that put on me to be super perfect too ?? 
  i just want to date a nice , normal , likes-to-have-fun and hang out kind of guy . 
  nothing special . 
  ordinary suits me ( and most women ) just fine . 
  i do n't reject requests to make someone ` more interested ' . 
  i reject them because i do n't want it or do n't want to do it . 
  if you 've been told no , back off and drop it . 
  pushing for something multiple times is beyond rude . 
  have you read harry potter ? 
  i 'm sure if you love both lord of the rings and hunger games then you 'd love hp . 
  it 's such an absorbing series and very easy to read !, 
  nope !, 
  it 's my favourite body type . 
  buff does n't do it for me at all . 
  no , that 's illegal where i am . 
  it means they are just girls who like drama in their lives by thinking they 're with a ` bad boy ' rather than realising they 're dating an idiot . 
  they 'll grow up soon enough , and in the mean time you can just tell them `` oh well , your loss . '', 
  huge range of options . 
  city business smart means pencil skirts or tailored trousers with a nice top ( which could mean button , loose , fitted , low neck/high neck , embellished , plain , coloured , monochrome ... ) , blazer and heels or flat shoes ( aka ballet flats/pumps ) . 
  i work in an office and a school and i tend to wear a variety of day dresses or trousers with a v-neck or scoop neck top . 
  evening wear is a whole different ball game , but i think / u/sehrah summed it up nicely . 
  we can dress up or dress down anything using shoes and accessories , but a lot of things depend on materials and hemlines . 
  it 's actually quite difficult to boil down what we can or ca n't wear for formal wear , there 's so much choice !, 
  it 's my otp guyzzzzz . 
  i will also always love [ shoebox project ] ( http://shoebox.lomara.org/category/shoebox-pdf-chapters/ ) for how well all of the marauders are written , and i do think it 's the essential marauder-era hp fiction to read . 
  i love well dressed men !, 
  well dressed men who know how to look good and how to style themselves are even better to me . 
  i think the whole ` throw whatever is nearest on if you 're a * real * man ' is total crap , and i would 1000x prefer someone who enjoyed fashion to someone who could n't care less . 
  although , saying that , recognising a nail varnish brand is a * bit * much . 
  even i do n't know that . 
  ** harry potter ** by jk rowling , of course . 
  they 're perfect commute material and the adult version covers are lovely . 
  ** temeraire ** by naomi novik - dragons in the british navy during the napoleonic wars !, 
  short , sweet , fun . 
  grilled halloumi is looooooooooooovely, 
  also goats cheese because it 's soft and mild and fucking amazing . 
  less questions about sex and attraction , more questions about hobbies and work . 
  sex and ` attractive qualities ' has been done to * death * around here . 
  also , more questions about ice cream . 
  because ice cream . 
  ugh , no . 
  the loo is * right there * . 
  also , i do n't want to aim wrong and get it on my foot or something . 
  i 've never heard of moose tracks before , but i 've just googled and their flavours sound amazing !, 
  i 'm not a big texter , but i use my phone to facebook and reddit all the time .
