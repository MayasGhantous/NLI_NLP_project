  3 ) i have n't seen my friends lately . 
  it 's only lately that i 've realised that i must be more of an extrovert , because i am * far * happier when i 've been out socialising than when i 've been hiding indoors . 
  people keep me merry . 
  you 're so cute !, 
  that hairstyle really suits you . 
  that one of you in a suit is * super * fit . 
  you should wear suits more often . 
  awww , i love your smile !, 
  you totally co ordinated your sunglasses to match the cat , did n't you ? 
  it might sound really harsh , but dude , this was only * six weeks * . 
  kids have school holidays longer than that . 
  this was n't love , this was just a really brief infatuation that got all you mixed up with endorphins and sent you a bit doolally for a while . 
  go hang out with some friends , go down the gym , do absolutely anything that will get you thinking about something else for a while . 
  you will get over her , i promise . 
  tom hiddleston [ brought tomato soup to a cold journalist ] ( http://youtu.be/m7r0nybc7x8?t=2m15s ) one time . 
  plus he is a fucking [ amazing dancer ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1ns97_lhi8 ) , is [ passionate about shakespeare ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctevsn4qwv4 ) and loves his characters [ way too damn much ] ( http://youtu.be/cgm1hyf-bam ) . 
  be like tom hiddleston . 
  also , i love that chris pratt is clearly just a [ big kid at heart ] ( http://youtu.be/8xqc2t_trmy?list=plq-odljkgf8fwt-vqrfrginhmzx7bjc8k ) with his space weapons . 
  i think it 's super cute . 
  anything that rhymes would make me reconsider , or ask for hyphenation . 
  kerry berry or terry mcferry would just sound stupid . 
  sure . 
  british guys never seem to make the first move unless at freaking gunpoint , so i do it first constantly . 
  i hate hanging around for anything !, 
  i have n't met many dateable guys irl lately , so most of my ` first moves ' just happen on okc where i invite them out for dinner . 
  right at the beginning . 
  preferably before i 've been out on a date with you , so i know i 'm not wasting my time . 
  oh my gosh , i love chris pratt in [ this press conference ] ( http://youtu.be/fkavax_gqra?list=plq-odljkgf8fwt-vqrfrginhmzx7bjc8k ) where he 's talking about ideas he and james gunn have come up with . 
  `` maybe rocket hears that i do n't like it [ gamora and tony stark hooking up ] , and then rocket * shoots * tony stark in the * face * ?!, 
  minute five !, 
  [ ... ] totally worth it ! '', 
  i like this quote in particular : `` i was living in constant fear of who i 'd meet , what i might have said to them , what i might have done with them , so i 'd stay in my apartment for days and drink alone . 
  i was a recluse at 20 . 
  it was pathetic -- it was n't me . 
  i 'm a fun , polite person , and it turned me into a rude bore . '', 
  no one really knows who i am , after all . 
  sometimes i 've had pretty vicious responses back to opinions i 've given , but i just write them off as idiots who ca n't play nicely with grown ups and move on . 
  i do drink , but not * that * much . 
  maybe one glass of wine every two weeks or something ? 
  if people want to make fun of me for not drinking , that 's their sorry problem . 
  i 'd rather stick to lime and lemonade for a few rounds and then wake up with a clear head in the morning than get drunk on sambuca ( which reeks , by the way ) and spend my sunday feeling like death . 
  just smile nicely at them , do n't be too much of a saint about not drinking and wait for them to grow up a little . 
  `` this is my friend anne vandamme . 
  she -- has some issues . '', 
  i love the video where he [ teaches the cookie monster ] ( http://youtu.be/b_ubvvnwglk ) about patience . 
  it 's the cutest thing ever !, 
  not in the slightest bit bothered . 
  she 's allowed to label herself however she likes . 
  it 's rude to tell someone `` you * have * to be this . '', 
  maybe they 're not x. 
  maybe they 're y. 
  how do you know ? 
  edit : also , on the african-american thing ... i mean , i 'm white and british so i do n't really know about the pressure for black people stateside , but over here you do n't get ` british-caribbean ' or ` gambian-english ' or ` african-british ' or whatever . 
  black people are black , asian people are asian and english/scottish/german / italian people are english/scottish/german / italian . 
  you 're the country and the culture you were brought up in , not a heritage or whatever , and getting mad that she says `` i do n't know where my ancestors came from , but i was brought up american '' seems to be a massive over-reaction to me . 
  my grandad was buried in an eco-friendly coffin ( basically just cardboard , i think ) that decayed with him , and his grave was marked with a tree in a green cemetery . 
  he has a little wooden marker that will eventually fade away , and all that will be left is this tree that will grow and grow . 
  i think it 's a lovely idea . 
  my dad made a birdbox and we put it in there a couple of years ago . 
  the whole cemetery will end up being a new wood for the local community , and i think it 's wonderful . 
  katherine/catherine is particularly strong to me , as it 's the name of several queens - catherine the great of russia , katherine of aragon , katherine howard , katherine parr . 
  elizabeth and victoria are quite good for this too . 
  i used to work backstage in theatres , so i would haul big pieces of set around , or carry heavy lighting kits about all day . 
  i would wear big heavy boots and carry spanners and sharpies on my belt a lot . 
  that 's pretty manly !, 
  i know that on official documents you have to define yourself , but i meant in more of a colloquial conversation context . 
  i 've not heard the british caribbean/british african labels in the same way as americans use it - but i 'll freely admit i could be totally wrong on that count . 
  have you ever watched documentaries by [ brian cox ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dew6x2bhiy8 ) ? 
  he 's quite a famous physicist here in the uk , and he 's * really * watchable . 
  his wonder of the universe series is great !, 
  pretty dead . 
  i go on dates occasionally , but i 'm done with the casual sex thing , and since none of those dates have really worked out into a relationship ... well . 
  it 's been quiet . 
  i do n't mind going celibate for now - i 'd rather wait a bit until i find a cool guy than make myself feel bad with fwbs . 
  i 'm kind of weirdly contradictory about it . 
  i 'm a total sceptic about pretty much everything - i do n't believe in ghosts , gods , mediums , fairies , anything supernatural whatsoever -- but i do think there 's a teeny grain of truth in astrology personality types somewhere . 
  maybe it 's just people born in particular seasons having relative experiences or something . 
  i do n't know what it is , but i do feel like i 'm a typical aries with very particular aries traits . 
  i know i 'm an aries sun with ( i think ) a gemini moon and saggitarius rising or something like that . 
  self bias confirmation or something ? 
  anyway . 
  i think there 's a little something in it , and it 's not like i read my horoscope or anything , but i do like reading sign background information and comparing my friends to it and seeing how they match up . 
  so there 's that . 
  i 'm pretty certain it was [ woodland burials ] ( http://www.woodlandburials.co.uk/index.htm ) that my family went with , because i 'm sure he was buried in wrabness . 
  it 's a beautiful site now , and his tree has grown really well . 
  you can hardly pick it out , but that 's kind of the whole point . 
  being single 's probably an 8/10 for me at the moment . 
  i love my independence and getting to do whatever i want to do when i want to do it , but it 's also always nice to have someone to cuddle in the evenings . 
  sex does n't figure into my judgement . 
  i can take or leave sex ( and right now , i 'm doing a lot of leaving . ), 
  companionship matters far more . 
  to be fair , i do n't think it shows very well on ukip that they happily yoinked their sitting representative out of his clacton seat to put carswell in there instead . 
  sure , carswell won the seat so they got what they wanted , but shafting your own supporters in favour of the more ` known ' face is n't exactly loyalty inspiring . 
  ` poor decisions ' ? 
  what crap . 
  i made good decisions for me at that moment in time based on what i wanted . 
  no guy gets to moralise to me about ` poor decisions ' and get away with it . 
  he can go find himself a blushing virgin if that 's what he wants , but this is 2014 and i 've had sex with multiple partners . 
  he can deal with it or jog on , matey . 
  * loki * by mike vasich ( norse ) was great too .
