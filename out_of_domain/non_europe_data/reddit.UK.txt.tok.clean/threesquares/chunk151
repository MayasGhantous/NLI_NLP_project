  does n't much bother me . 
  i tend to default in thinking most redditors are young and male anyway . 
  i tug at the back of my hair , especially when i 'm stressed or worried . 
  then it 's like * tug tug scratch scratch tug tug * until i make myself stop . 
  also , my sense of humour can be * way * too dry for people i 've only just met . 
  i 'm sure i 've been unintentionally mean loads of times to really nice people , and i never mean it !, 
  i just say it , and it 's always a bit of an ` oh shit , i totally did n't mean that ' moment . 
  hahaha not even a little bit !, 
  i 'm a * rubbish * texter , even with my best friends . 
  you 're lucky to get two messages out of me before i get bored and wander off somewhere else . 
  oooh i had starbucks pumpkin spiced latte for the first ever time last week and it was lovely !, 
  can we have that at our coffee hour ? 
  aw no , even if it 's been said , go and say it from your pov !, 
  every little helps and all that . 
  she 's the most fantastic actress and so no-nonsense too . 
  she 'd be the best person to go to and just talk about * everything * . 
  god i know , right ? 
  how is it she can pull off pretty much every hairstyle in the book and look so sublime ? 
  aww . 
  tell her !, 
  jlaw is * amazing * . 
  i fucking love her and her killer attitude towards basically everything . 
  because apparently so far i have n't been on dates with the right guy . 
  also , how the hell am i supposed to know * why * i 'm single ? 
  because thirty year old men are jackasses ? 
  maybe ? 
  go ask the guys i 've been to dinner with . 
  they 've been the one doing the fade aways . 
  i 'm sorry , but ` gatekeepers ' is the ugliest term i have ever come across . 
  my vagina is not wrought iron . 
  it does not have fucking winged boars mounted on gateposts beside my labia . 
  you do not have to find a password or ring a buzzer to have sex with me . 
  also , sex is not everything i am there for , and ` gaining admittance ' to me is just -- ugh , it 's the most degrading thought . 
  i 'm not some * castle * , i am a * girl * . 
  thank you !, 
  that 's exactly how i feel about it !, 
  it 's like gandalf at the gates of moria or something . 
  i got mass downvoted on / r/relationships a couple of weeks ago by suggesting that someone 's roommate was n't a totally crazy mean girl , but was actually making a reasonable request which i could kind of understand . 
  god , you 'd think i 'd have said she recreationally kicked puppies or something . 
  i swear in my head more than i actually cuss outloud , but i do say naughty things pretty often . 
  same . 
  i swore in front of my part time employer a few weeks ago ( during casual conversation ) and he was visibly shocked at hearing me say ` fuck ' . 
  i love film soundtracks and i 'm not afraid to admit it , so here are some of my favourites :, 
  [ black tears ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbnpkafqc0g ) from guardians of the galaxy , when quill is snatching the infinity stone away from ronan and everything goes purple and it 's * amazing * . 
  i just love the gradual build of the main theme until the trumpets kick in and then it 's just like bwrumm . 
  [ avengers assemble theme song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vgjgxmuhmc ) from avengers assemble . 
  that brass . 
  those violins . 
  that snare . 
  that massive massive sweeping theme going i have superheroes here . 
  [ two steps from hell by nero ] ( http://youtu.be/dbu4v-qy5ng ) from anna karenina ( 2012 ) . 
  slightly cheating , it is the theme used in the trailer rather than the film , but the piano line and the kick of the brass just gives me fuzzy little thrills up and down . 
  you can just * see * the train rushing towards you with the percussion too . 
  [ a knife in the dark ] ( http://youtu.be/ywivs_f2kmo ) , fellowship of the ring . 
  so wonderfully , wonderfully creepy and so evocative of the hobbits running through the dark . 
  fellowship is a wonderful score , but this is my favourite . 
  [ duel of the fates ] ( http://youtu.be/qzvbqbosf5w ) from star wars episode 1 by john williams . 
  ugh , * such * an evocative theme . 
  i know , i know , jar jar binks sucks , but it was all worth it for that lightsabre fight and this music . 
  [ and i will kiss by underworld ] ( http://youtu.be/uoeui59l9s8 ) from the 2012 olympics london opening ceremony . 
  okay , it 's 17 minutes long ( put it on for the background of something ) , but it is just a stunning piece of music , especially from when the theme really kicks in at 1:45 . 
  it 's part of the section titled ` pandemonium ' and this track just sums it up - really thudding drums , a gorgeous deep bass line and a melody that 's just driving forward the entire time with these vocals sweeping in and out . 
  really incredibly stirring music . 
  i love it . 
  aw , i love your love list !, 
  emma watson is fabulous , jlaw is killer , i * wish * i was half as put together as mary berry , and i totally agree on the sue perkins love . 
  she and mel are the most brilliant double act on tv right now . 
  and best friends always get best friend love , of course . 
  [ this is the face henry gives you when he wants to play ] ( http://i.imgur.com/u62wohs.jpg ), 
  [ sometimes he can be professional ] ( http://i.imgur.com/li8sa7d.jpg?1 ) ( that 's me with him too ), 
  [ but mostly he 's just adorable ] ( http://i.imgur.com/4vzksa7.jpg ) . 
  kiss kiss bang bang ( soooo goooood ) or avengers assemble . 
  skirts and dresses just get pulled up , or down if you 're wearing tights with them . 
  playsuits/dungarees get undone and pulled down like trousers . 
  assassins apprentice by robin hobb , because it will suck you into the wonderful world of the farseer trilogy , and then tawny man and you will never let go . 
  god i love her characters , especially the fool . 
  i 'm also reading consider phlebas by iain m banks at the moment and i * love * it . 
  it 's space opera stuff that feels like it should be a movie . 
  there 's so much action and excitement to it !, 
  i 'm having a lot of fun in books right now . 
  ** trained for ** : backstage theatre work, 
  ** working as ** : telecoms sales, 
  ** what traits do you need ** :, 
  * proactiveness, 
  * sense of humour, 
  * enthusiasm ( for the job ), 
  * good with people, 
  for both areas you definitely absolutely need to be proactive - sales to keep making approaches , theatre work to pitch in where work needs to be done . 
  theatre is a funny beast in particular , as people * definitely * notice what you 're doing and how much you 're doing of it , and though no one except lighting designers really takes themselves too seriously , you need to consistently show real devotion to the job and pitch in with absolutely everything . 
  even when you 're grumpy , even when you 're tired and irritable , you * have * to get out there and do the job properly right until the end of the show . 
  you need a really good sense of humour , especially when you 're starting get outs at 10.30 pm , finish hauling heavy lamps around at 2am and then you * still * need to sweep and repaint the stage . 
  getting along with people is vital - not just other techies , but the actors , front of house staff and box office staff too . 
  personally , i think you should keep your mouth shut and take this as a lesson - no matter how clever you think you 've been by cheating , someone * will * know and you * will * be found out . 
  your cousin did the right thing by telling your girlfriend , and she does n't owe you shit for whatever ` favour ' it was that you did her . 
  start learning how to be a good bloke instead of screwing over your girlfriends and whinging that you got found out . 
   if i knew she was going to rat me out like that i would have told my gf mknths ago . 
  so if she * was n't * going to grass you up , you would have let your girlfriend carry on in blissful ignorance ? 
  i 'm not surprised she told on you , in that case . 
  thank you !, 
  he 's an english setter with orange belton colouring , two years old and a totally adorable pain in the neck .
