  well , i was going out with a french guy and a ridiculously hot canadian guy asked me out , but i turned him down because i was already with the french guy , which was a * stupid * idea because the french guy turned out to be a massive massive tool . 
  and then the canadian guy got a girlfriend anyway , so basically , in a nutshell , i lost the game . 
  lord of the rings for sure . 
  fifty shades would send me eye-rolling like you would n't believe . 
  and a particularly gory scene too , which sort of reminded me of kill bill . 
  with the way they filmed it i can see why it ended up an 18 . 
  android all the way for my phone and tablet , though i have an ipod in my car and use itunes for my music library on the pc . 
  i 'm probably a little more relaxed and easy going when i 'm just with girls as opposed to a mix of girls and guys , but i do n't think it 's much of a difference . 
  i went to a day spa yesterday and spent all day wandering around in my swimsuit and a fluffy dressing gown , which was soooo nice . 
  the only thing better was when my best friend , also in a fluffy dressing gown , gave me a hug . 
  it was like being cuddled by sheer fluffiness . 
  yup yup yup . 
  * adore * hair playing and head scratches . 
  it 's dubarry 's that are all the rage around here with the sailing set , but holy crap are they expensive !, 
  i can afford my ariats without making my credit card cry . 
  oh really ?? 
  i got my ariats for # 150 from ingatestone saddlery last year - # 250 is wayyyy out my price range . 
  maybe the windermere line was cheaper for whatever reason ? 
  you know , right now i 'm really on a kick for scarlett johanssen 's black widow , particularly in avengers and captain america 2 . 
  so , uh , spoilers for both of those i guess . 
  on the surface she 's another one of those ` ass-kicking ' cliche superhero ladies wearing tight leather and running around with guns , but if you dig a little deeper there is * so much * there . 
  she 's super smart with computers , speaks multiple languages , and is clearly a really high-ranking representative in shield - like , she 's getting orders and missions direct from fury high . 
  she 's got her love interests ( hawkeye , and the winter soldier in comic lore ) but they do n't * define * her , and half the time she 's beating them up or sorting out their godly mindfucks anyway . 
  she can absolutely hold her own - look at her out in the field on her own at the start of avengers with those russian terrorist guys , or getting sent to deal with bruce banner on her own , or sent to talk to loki on her own , or to deal with alexander pierce * on her own * . 
  she is doing super dangerous things all by herself and no one is even batting an eyelid . 
  she 's a freaking pilot flying shield twinjets all over the place , and then she 's just chilling out with captain america and telling * him * what to do to avoid the bad guys . 
  i also like , by the way , that they gave her realistic moments of total freak outs in avengers and cap 2 which she got up and dealt with . 
  you saw her scared of the hulk in avengers but she still answered the radio call from fury , and you saw her panic when the winter soldier shot her in the shoulder , and i think just those moments of honest i 'm - scared-but-i 'm - going-to-do-it-anyway are really inspiring . 
  especially the avengers one . 
  plus , her hair in cap 2 is * amazing * and i 've decided i 'm going to have mine like that once it 's grown out , and her casual fashion style is super super cool . 
  so basically , black widow is how i want to be . 
  maybe not a martial art super spy assassin , but a woman with authority who knows her own mind , is ridiculously smart and can really truly deal with stuff when it all goes to shit . 
  i really hope they keep her character as cool as she currently is , because right now she 's amazing . 
  i 'd definitely recommend traitor 's blade too . 
  it really makes a difference in the fights when de castell knows what he 's talking about , and it makes them * much * easier to get into and enjoy . 
  biscuits . 
  so many biscuits . 
  loads of earl grey , and watching cheerful/uplifting youtube videos like [ ` hello ' from the book of mormon performed at the tonys ] ( http://youtu.be/zy5k8apszhi ) and [ ` happy ' by pharrell ] ( http://youtu.be/y6sxv-suytm ) . 
  taking a five or ten minute walk normally helps wake me up too . 
  pretty much blu-rays and netflix too , with a dash of bbc iplayer and 4od thrown in . 
  sometimes you just need to get under someone to get over someone else . 
  do n't feel guilty just because you fancy someone new . 
  you know , i still have n't figured out exactly what american biscuits * are * , let alone why you dip them in gravy . 
  they 're sort of like scones , right ? 
  i get anxious and restless . 
  like an all body over itch that just * needs * to be expressed . 
  i get really really wrapped up in whatever i 'm doing for hours at a time , and i 'm normally really thirsty but not hungry at all . 
  i 'll usually skip dinner when i 'm going through a creative burst . 
  she keeps telling you no , and she 's not ready , and you 're * not listening * . 
  you ca n't just steamroller her in to liking you , op , and if you keep telling her `` you 're wrong , you just need to like me instead '' , then in the end she 's going to tell you to back off and leave her alone . 
  we know you like her , * she * knows you like her , but by pushing and pushing then you wo n't see her for dust . 
  leave her alone for a little while before you hang out with her again - maybe a few weeks will help her get past this anniversary thing . 
  i 'd normally say longer , but you 're 16 and things change really fast when you 're a teenager . 
  stop calling her your girlfriend . 
  let her get over this guy , hang out with her in a group instead of one on one and see where things go . 
  my favourite has to be the foot to the chest bit at 1:41 where you see bucky just put his whole body into the kick and go flying backwards onto the car . 
  i love how much you really * felt * the knocks in cap 2 . 
  me too , but there 's quite a few marvel clips around . 
  i sort of suspect once they 're out on dvd they let some of it fly . 
  i 'm assuming by ` college ' you mean university age , right ? 
  over here , college only refers to either a ) the place you go to between 16-18 for a-levels and b ) smaller sub-divisions of particular larger ancient universities like churchill college at cambridge or merton college at oxford . 
  i 'm not sure exactly what to tell you , to be honest !, 
  we do n't do sports like american unis do , and the cambridge/oxford boat race is about the biggest we get for uni sports . 
  we also do n't do sororities/fraternities or any of that , but we probably do a lot more drinking - long weekend afternoons spent in the pub are very normal over here , and i suspect most brits you meet will be able to handle their alcohol far better than most american uni students . 
  that 'll be especially true if you arrive in time for freshers week , which is when all the brand new first year uni students spend a week getting totally bladdered as an introduction to uni life . 
  you wo n't get as much of a truly ` british ' experience in london , as london 's kind of a world of its own , so it depends whether you really want to get into the culture or you 're doing it more for the subject knowledge and city experience . 
  it 'll also be far more expensive to live in than anywhere else , so just bear that in mind . 
  what a shocker that he 's single !, 
  probably an hour , as that 's the time it takes to get to the next nearest towns to me . 
  maybe an hour and a half if they 're really really cool . 
  i 'm going to be absolutely brutally honest here and ask : ** why has this dog not been put down ** ? 
  by your own account he has bitten dozens of people , at least once in a serious manner . 
  he consistently makes attempts to attack children unprovoked . 
  he 's already nearly killed a cat . 
  you believe he has a mental disorder . 
  this is * not * a happy animal . 
  i know your boyfriend loves him . 
  i know he 's his baby . 
  i 've grown up with dogs and i love mine like they 're my kids too . 
  but op , you 've spent * two years * training him . 
  what happens if he gets out of the house and a child is playing nearby ? 
  in all seriousness , what would be the likely outcome - not just physically , but with * legal ramifications * for knowingly having an aggressive animal under your roof ? 
  he 's not just bitten once by accident - he has bitten people * repeatedly * . 
  you say you do n't want to be liable , but you absolutely will be . 
  you are the owners , and the adults in this situation . 
  i think you need to talk to your boyfriend seriously , and ask what is honestly best for muffin . 
  he 's six years old . 
  rr 's live to what , ten ? 
  eleven ? 
  if training is n't working - and it sounds like you 've made a real go at it - then he is not going to change . 
  he is not going to get better . 
  i would honestly being talking to a vet about putting him out of his misery , for everyone 's sake . 
  we know she is going to get her fuck on because she is asking to get her fuck on and because you specifically said :, 
   she says that being able to sleep with people in se asia ** is really important to her ** and kept bringing it up today, 
  this is going to happen , op . 
  it 's not coming out of the blue here . 
  she is asking you if she can sleep with other people so that she can * sleep with other people * whether you say no or not . 
  she knows your boundaries ( yes , but only with me there ) and wants to ignore them and do her own thing . 
  this is n't cool , and you need to wake up to that right fucking now . 
  yeah , that would n't be a big deal .
