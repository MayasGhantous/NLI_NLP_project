  tumblr is whinging about not getting a black widow film right now , but you know what ? 
  they are doing * stonking * work with her character so far , and i am more than happy to keep her as a crucial lynchpin all the way through avengers 2 , avengers 3 , * civil war * , fucking ** infinity gauntlet ** part 1 and 2 ** plus ** getting a captain marvel , jessica jones , and agent carter dealio . 
  and more gamora in guardians 2 !, 
  you rock , marvel . 
  hahahaha , well i do try to live up to the stereotype sometimes !, 
  she 's twenty three years old . 
  she needs to grow up . 
  i do n't think it 's trivial at all - she clearly does n't know how to respond to any kind of situation in an appropriate manner , whether it 's something fun like sex or something sad like your dads death . 
  i would honestly try and sit down with her at a time when you 're both calm and discuss it one more time . 
  do n't try and fight with her , try and * talk * to her . 
  tell her that you find memes funny at the right moment , but a lot of the moments that she brings them up in are n't funny and are n't appropriate , and that something needs to change . 
  i 'd also try and find out exactly why she feels like the only way she can connect to you or others is through memes . 
  hopefully once you figure that crucial little bit of information out , you can start resolving things a little more permanently than just by saying ` stop sending me this crap , please ' . 
  sure . 
  i love watching sporty , sweaty men . 
  i 'd just like for all women sports teams to get the same amount of media coverage as the guys do is all , and not for it to be brushed off as ` well it 's women playing so it 's not as good/interesting/fun / demanding . ', 
  if i went along with it , i 'd probably just kiss him on the cheek or something . 
  i would n't full on make out with him , that would be super embarrassing . 
  well , it 's been announced that she 'll be in aou , but i do n't remember hearing * just * aou . 
  newsrama 's live report from yesterday ( from the faq with feige ) : `` on why no black widow movie ? 
  it 's about bringing new characters to the screen . 
  widow will be like hulk in avengers movie and has a big role in age of ultron . 
  the plans we have for her are very big and in fact lynchpin to that franchise . '', 
  so hopefully ( hopefully ! ), 
  we 'll be seeing lots more of her . 
  but yes , i hope they keep pushing the diversity !, 
  i love what they 've been doing so far . 
  they can , but then they can also be reigned back by the director . 
  a good film/tv show/play comes from all three corners ; the writer , the actor and the director . 
  if one of those things are out , they all suffer . 
  if you isolate yourself ( out of nervousness , anxiety , whatever ) then yes , it can be . 
  if you try to connect with anyone at all , then no . 
  it can be quite a small world , in fact . 
  a ` beautiful ' man has more of a wow factor for me but i think i tend to use them interchangeably . 
  i also think someone i describe as ` beautiful ' tends to have the whole package ; looks , personality , charm , dress sense , all rolled into one . 
  i do n't discuss my sex life with either of my parents , but i 'll talk about pretty much everything else , especially with my mum . 
  i think the main thing that helps is that even from when i was little , my mum would n't ever let the sun set on an argument . 
  no matter what , before we said goodnight she would have apologised or come back to sort out it with me , so i * always * knew that whatever i told her , it would be okay . 
  it encouraged me to be really open with her , because i knew that although she might get annoyed with some stupid decision i 'd made , she would never become irreparably angry with me , and we would always hug and make up . 
  she always checks in with me if i 'm sounding out of sorts ( even when i 'm just tired and i 'm not upset about anything ) , and she 's always just encouraged me to talk about anything that 's bothering me , no matter how little . 
  it just naturally makes me very open with her , and i love that . 
  edit : the apologising thing works both ways for us now . 
  i had an argument with my mum a few weeks ago where both of us stormed off really crossly , but i came back to her an hour later and said `` i 'm sorry i shouted . 
  i was n't angry because of what you were asking , but because of the way you asked it . '', 
  she apologised for being so demanding , i apologised for being so hot headed and said i would do what she was asking for , we hugged and it was all good . 
  i like moments like that . 
   conversely , women start to become less desirable with age because their beauty fades . 
  i do n't know about you op , but i get far more awesome with age . 
  and i get more confident and have a better , more stable outlook on my career , so post-thirty i 'm looking at the full package here . 
  fathers walking brides down the aisle , or even the whole ` asking the father for her hand ' kind of thing . 
  i 'm not a commodity to be bought or sold , and this is n't the 1500s , but it 's also so nice to have your dad or other assorted family member walking beside you on the day . 
  it 's never worked for me . 
  relationships end for a reason , and unless there 's been a large amount of time since the split or someone has drastically changed , i always think it 's just a case of history repeating itself to get back with someone again . 
  i do n't know . 
  let 's go ask [ widow ] ( http://voice21.justyouth.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/35-548x661.jpg ) [ twankey ] ( http://www.inkpellet.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/ip78-rob-forknall-as-widow-twankey.jpg ) shall we ? 
  or maybe an [ ugly ] ( http://nigelthedame.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/c041860.jpg ) [ sister ] ( http://www.paulmorseactor.com/userimages/cinderella%20ghost.jpg ) or two . 
  they seem to like it !, 
  disclaimer : i 'm a brit . 
  we have odd traditions that may or may not annually involve middle aged men dressing up in flouncy dresses and over sized boobs for fun . 
  i like this quote from one of my favourite authors , robin hobb . 
  '' `` when considering a man 's motives , remember you must not measure his wheat with your bushel . 
  he may not be using the same standard at all . '' it just helps me remember that hey , * i * might not like what x is doing , but they might well be enjoying themselves just fine . 
  i had the rest of a green and blacks butterscotch chocolate bar that was tucked away in my desk drawer . 
  i 'm trying to be healthy , but * god * it was good . 
  i do , partly because i like the feel of fuzz-free legs and partly because i get my pins out for exercise , so i like them to be displayable no matter the weather . 
  i 'm single and i 'm so over having casual sex . 
  i 'd rather not have any until i meet a cool guy to have it with on a regularly monogamous basis . 
  it 's been about a year so far , and i 'm really not that bothered . 
  a beauty therapist gave me a hand written product recommendation list the other week , and her handwriting was like a drunk crab . 
   i miss sex but not enough to sleep with someone i am not into . 
  same for me . 
  i like sex for the companionship and comfort , not just for the act or orgasm or whatever . 
  what are you voting for ? 
  i 'm 29 . 
  i used to really fancy artists , actors , musicians - all the starving poor types . 
  now i 've been through work in the arts industry and out the other side , i actively * avoid * men who are primarily artists/actors/musicians , simply because i would like to have a ) a savings pot b ) holidays c ) a life . 
  now i look for guys with stable careers . 
  i would happily date backstage/design guys , but not performance artists . 
  that 's quite a big change for me . 
  no one looks good in neons . 
  even you , hipster fifteen year olds that are skinny as fuck . 
  you still do n't look good dressed like a dayglo stick or a lost jogger . 
  fine . 
  jewel tones ? 
  awesome . 
  yeah okay . 
  go home . 
  it keeps cropping up every year in shops like topshop and new look for some indefinable reason . 
  he 's just a superb actor and inhabits his parts so well . 
  he did the most wonderful [ richard ii ] ( http://youtu.be/axgkbbbxvsa ) for the bbc 's hollow crown series . 
  i 'm hard working . 
  if there 's something i really want , i will sit down and make myself get it . 
  i 'm also cleverer than i give myself credit for , i think . 
  i 'm kind . 
  i like doing little gestures for my friends and family , just because i love them . 
  i 'm a positive , cheerful person , and if i 'm in the grumps it never stays around for long . 
  there 's not much that gets me down !, 
  he was brilliant in the hour , too . 
  i wish they were doing a third series !, 
  no harm in asking - the worst they can say is no .
