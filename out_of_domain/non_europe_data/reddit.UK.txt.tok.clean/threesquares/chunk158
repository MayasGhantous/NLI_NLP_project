  i was a techie for about seven years , including drama school training , and i went between theatre , events , festivals and tv without too much problem . 
  i did cruise ship work too , and most of my techie friends seem to have done that at least once in their career . 
  productions always need good technicians , and even though i 've been away for three years i could probably go back into it if i hit up a few of my old contacts for a season . 
  the money * can * be good if you get the right contract - if i landed an equity ( uk union ) contract when i was doing stage management work i got all sorts of little cash perks , but it was n't so much the case when i did lighting . 
  you end up applying for a dozen new jobs every six months too , which gets * really * dull . 
  theatre 's all about who you know , not what you know and you need to be able to network and be a bit cheeky about asking for work to get yourself in there . 
  events pay more , but oh my * god * they can be dull , especially for techies . 
  they tend to use more simple kit - a few profile lights , some led bits , and they 're easy to do , but do n't underestimate how brain numbing listening to business presentations can be while you 're waiting for your next cue . 
  theatre is more stimulating and far more fun , but the work is less reliable . 
  i never did too many concerts , but i think it 's the same kind of thing as theatre - get onto a tour and you 're good , but out of season you 'll be filling up holes with little bits to pay the rent . 
  you will also be lugging a * lot * of kit around all day long , and the days can be really reeallllly long for a two hour performance which you 'll then be striking out afterwards . 
  in the end i just sort of realised i did n't love it enough to carry on with it , so i quit and went into the family company instead . 
  i do n't regret it at all - i did it while i loved it until i did n't love it any more , and that 's really what you have to do . 
  i do n't mean to sound pessimistic about it all , as it can be fantastic fun , but you do have to be realistic about the pits as well as the perks of the job . 
  [ `` hello '' from the book of mormon ] ( http://youtu.be/zy5k8apszhi ) musical always makes me smile . 
  i really do n't drink that much any more . 
  i 'll have one , mayyyyybe two glasses of wine a week , and even then i usually have them with a meal . 
  * ca n't be a drug user of any kind . 
  not even weed . 
  i do n't like drugs . 
  * must want kids . 
  * no criminal record ( cautions are fine , prison time is n't ), 
  * must be employed . 
  freelance , studenting and between jobs are cool . 
  * be passionate about * something * . 
  i really do n't care what , but any so 's of mine need independent hobbies because i 've got loads of them . 
  the worst sex is boring sex . 
  just lie there while he pumps away , little or minimum effort involved , boring sex . 
  it 's mostly happened with casual encounters for me , and it 's just so incredibly unsatisfying . 
  fine . 
  i go with the scouts motto , be prepared . 
  i notice you also left ` physically abusive ' out of your cons , which is a pretty major one by all accounts . 
  yes , this girl is abusive op , in a multitude of ways , and this is n't a healthy place for you to be . 
  please leave her !, 
  i 've got access to a pretty extensive online academic library at the moment , if you 'd like some help looking for more technical journals ? 
  i love costume research . 
  can you pm me your email address ? 
  i 've found a couple of pdfs and citations that might help you out . 
  something like [ these ones ] ( http://www.office.co.uk/view/product/office_catalog/2,37/1841700078 ) ? 
  or lower cut ? 
  edit : or these [ shoeboots ] ( http://www.office.co.uk/view/product/office_catalog/2,10/1808300000 ) are quite cute !, 
  i do n't tip except in restaurants , and that 's usually 10 % . 
  it 's not really done here . 
  not really . 
  we 're so used to american accents from the media that they 're just another way of speaking . 
  i do * like * american men , but you 're honestly nothing particularly special . 
  yup , i 've met plenty . 
  labradors are generally soppy dolts , but my dog ( an english setter ) has been growled and snapped at by a fair share of the nastier ones . 
  raised middle , probably upper middle class , i reckon ( grammar school education , sailing as a hobby , multiple cars , several holidays abroad , parents in management roles ) . 
  i do n't see myself going up or down particularly - i have no desire to go and live on a council estate , i 'm looking to work in private schools eventually , and i do n't have the requisite messy land rover or dulcet tones of the upper class . 
  i 'd also like to note that here in the uk , class is * not * about money . 
  it 's about so many other things like where you shop , what newspapers you read , what cars you drive , what school you went to , how you talk . 
  you can be dirt poor and still be upper class , and loads of people with shedloads of money are as lower class as they come . 
  [ dogger by shirley hughes ] ( http://www.amazon.co.uk/dogger-shirley-hughes/dp/1862308055 ) . 
  even now , that book can make me cry . 
  the illustrations are just gorgeous , and the story is so so sweet !, 
  i think you might be better off posting this in / r/askhistorians if you want some well sourced answers . 
  for me , modern art is about three things ; colour , shape and emotion . 
  i love [ kandinsky ] ( http://www.ibiblio.org/wm/paint/auth/kandinsky/kandinsky.comp-8.jpg ) for his use of colour , the sharpness of the lines and the shapes he creates . 
  it makes me think of music ( which i believe also inspired him ) . 
  it 's the same with [ matisse ] ( http://www.artfund.org/assets/what-to-see/exhibitions/2014/matisse/050rt_1.jpg ) and how his colours stand out against the lines of his portrait . 
  minimalism really works for me - i like just seeing the lines against each other and the sharpness of the colour against the edges . 
  modern art , for me , is also so much in how it makes you * feel * . 
  sure , sometimes it just makes you angry in an ` how can this be art ?! ', 
  way , but that 's good !, 
  it 's making you question how you see things , how you experience them . 
  can a dark piece of wood against a white floor ever look pretty ? 
  can it be art ? 
  how about if the wood has attractive carvings in ? 
  is it art now ? 
  when did it change from art to not art ? 
  why ? 
  the modern artists broke away from the more traditional schools because they wanted to express how they * felt * , not just how things looked . 
  that 's why it appeals to me , anyway . 
  or kandinsky 's painting again - i look at it and i can just * feel * the music under the surface there . 
  i can see staves and clefs and rests in there . 
  it makes me think of harmonies and volume and melodies , and you just do n't get that in other more ` traditional ' art . 
  of course . 
  i get all tongue-tied and giggly , and fiddle with my hair and feel all stupid about whatever i try and say . 
   but above all please answer the question as asked . 
  uh - unnecessary addendum , what what ? 
  my mum had the exact same problem a few months ago . 
  she was working alongside a passive aggressive mean little woman in her department who full on bullied people to get what she wanted . 
  my mum made several complaints which were n't really listened to by her line manager , until one day this lady went too far ( swearing and shouting across the office ) , and my mum just turned around and said `` i do n't have to deal with this . 
  i quit . '', 
  she walked out , put in a formal complaint against the lady which was upheld by witnesses , and moved back to a different department . 
  she 's * so * much happier now . 
  if betty is putting in complaints to head office , your mum needs to do the same . 
  complain formally about her . 
  make notes about her actions , get witnesses if she can . 
  and in the end , if this lady is making her job hell , then i would honestly tell your mum that she really does n't have to put up with it , and no job is worth coming home crying . 
  well , two of them are gay , one acquaintance is a functioning alcoholic , one i 've dated already , and several are married or in long term relationships . 
  ooooh yes . 
  it 's nice just to stare sometimes ... 
   made her tits more symmetric and slightly larger as well as minimize the ribcage a little to make her more feminine . 
  surely that 's the point ? 
  why is the before picture not ` feminine ' enough ? 
  why the need to squash her ribs in a little bit more ? 
  what does it actually * achieve * ? 
  she 's already a celebrity with a personal trainer , a dietitian , a squad of makeup artists and pitch perfect lighting on her to get that great first picture .
