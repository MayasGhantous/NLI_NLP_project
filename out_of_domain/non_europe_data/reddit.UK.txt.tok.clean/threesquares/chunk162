  we just talk and talk and talk about * everything * from mutual friends to work to boyfriends to family to movies and games and really silly , stupid stuff right through to really deep emotional stuff . 
  we literally talk for hours about anything and everything . 
  i 've never had that with a guy so far , but it happens all the time with my girls . 
   how do you deal with another man 's unfair aggression and hold your head high as a man ? 
  by * walking away * . 
  seriously , be the better man , do n't give in to someone being an aggressive twit and just walk away . 
  fights are never noble - and no , i do n't care if you 're standing up to someone insulting you or your girlfriend or your dead grandmother or your dog . 
  just leave it . 
  i went into a nike store the other week to find a neon coloured jacket for running at night time . 
  mens section ? 
  neon yellow , neon orange , bright things for being seen in . 
  womens section ? 
  black . 
  purple . 
  black with purple highlights . 
  maybe a dull pink . 
  nike , are you on a mission to get us fucking * run over * or something ?!, 
  i was so pissed off . 
  nothings stopping me , and i do have nice long conversations with my guy friends , but the ones i have with girls somehow always get much deeper and more emotionally charged . 
  i suspect it 's partly because i went to an all girls school so i 'm just more used to connecting like that with women over men . 
  i 'm looking forward to finding a relationship where i can prove myself wrong and have endless conversations with a man about anything , but so far it has n't turned up . 
   they ca n't comprehend the idea of going out with no intention but to throw a ball around , barely say a word , and then go home . 
  well - yeah !, 
  that seems really odd to me . 
  i 'll happily go and throw a ball around for a while , but then i 'd like to sit down and have a chat afterwards too . 
  i 'd say rather that right now i 'm not fussed about being in a relationship rather than not wanting to be in one . 
  to put it succintly , i 'm just too busy . 
  i 'm working full time and studying full time , and it 's hard for me to dedicate social nights for my good friends and hobbies , let alone for a fledgling relationship . 
  some things just have to wait . 
  but in all of those situations you gave before , none of those people attacked you , * you * inserted * yourself * into the situation . 
  i 'm not saying do n't intervene in cases where people are getting assaulted , i 'm just asking why in all of those cases you had to resort to physical violence instead of telling them to lay off , or doing something like calling the police ? 
  you know , i got teased in secondary school . 
  i got bullied , and not once did i ever even considered physically fighting them . 
  i ignored them , i told staff and it got sorted . 
  like adults . 
  that trumps physical retaliation for me every single time . 
  it 's an english fairy tale about a poor boy that goes to london with his cat in order to seek his fortune . 
  i suppose i indulge it more than quench it . 
  i always have about three books on the go at once , i have about four different hobbies , two jobs , two degree modules to study at the same time , and i 'm always dashing off to london or cambridge or something to go see friends at short notice . 
  i 'm not a very static person at all !, 
  they cover and uncover you with towels as they go , so it 's never been like `` oooh , they 're massaging my * whole body * '' or anything . 
  actually , i 'm dying to get a back massage sorted out some time soon . 
  i should get on that . 
  i 'm at work now , but i 'll be getting out for a run when i get home . 
  i quite enjoy running at night !, 
  i would tell her that it 's totally cool if she does n't enjoy cooking , but hiding it behind some kind of sexist agenda does n't help anyone , least of all herself . 
  it 's not that * women * are expected to know how to cook , it 's that * adults * are expected to know at least a little in order to feed themselves and their families . 
  for the record , my dad is the primary cook in our house because my mum and i both dislike cooking and mostly resort to toast or jacket potatoes for dinner . 
  so plenty of men * do * cook . 
  you can also find loads of male celebrity chefs ( jamie oliver , paul hollywood , gordon ramsey , nigel slater , the hairy bikers , ainsley harriott , michel roux jr , gregg wallace , heston blumenthal , james martin ... ) to show her . 
  do you mean , ` do i care if he has n't had many partners ? ', 
  no , not particularly . 
  i do n't know about many others in here , but i 'm fine with it . 
  or rather , i * was * . 
  now i want something more meaningful , but i could n't care less if other people go and have flings or one night stands . 
  none of my business . 
  lately my dad has been encouraging me to go out and have more casual relationships , so he 's totally cool with sex and stuff . 
  it 's just a bit awkward to say `` well , dad , i 've had loads of those and i 'm a bit tired of the no strings stuff now . '', 
  a sublime dark brown leather jacket that is cut * so beautifully * at the back and makes me look fucking gorgeous . 
  it cost me # 99 , but even that was reduced from # 185 and as it 's leather it 's going to last me years and years . 
  i 'm completely in love . 
  cake !, 
  ^ ^ and ^ ^ i ^ ^ note ^ ^ biscuits ^ ^ do n't ^ ^ count ^ ^ under ^ ^ cookies . 
  ^ ^ win !, 
  ^ ^ hahaha, 
  getting to see petra in jordan was the most amazing experience , and i 'd love to do it again . 
  cape town was insanely gorgeous as well . 
  they all work fine for me !, 
  god , italian food was so good . 
  i stuffed myself to bits there and in greece . 
  also , italian men are * divine * . 
  one of the dancers on the ship i was working on was dating an italian guy onshore , and everyone was like `` you just wait until you see this guy , he 's like a moviestar '' and i was all `` yeah , yeah , okay , whatever . '', 
  and then , we docked at sorrento for a day and walked off the ship , and at the end of the gangway was this dark haired , svelte guy in pristine tailoring with a necktie and sunglasses and perfect hair , sitting on a vespa going '' * ciao * . '', 
  i just about died . 
  noooooo cookies are all doughy and chunkie and biscuits are all light and thin . 
  they 're totally different . 
  well , apart from hobnobs . 
  do n't take my chocolate covered hobnobs away !, 
  the silly ones where everyone messes around a bit . 
  i think we 've got a brilliant sense of humour in here , i like getting to see it let loose a little . 
  also , the ones where we all drool over hot actors . 
  uk biscuits are all sweet . 
  we have [ custard creams ] ( http://www.glutafin.co.uk/products/large/custardcreams.jpg ) , [ chocolate bourbons ] ( https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3185/2898969369_3aab3cc182.jpg ) , [ party rings ] ( http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01702/bee-29-aug_1702115c.jpg ) , [ chocolate digestives ] ( http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/05/17/article-0-06e65683000005dc-583_468x411.jpg ) and the best ones ever , [ hob nobs ] ( http://media.oregonlive.com/mix_impact/photo/hobnob-cookie-mixjpg-658336fd678fea86.jpg ) . 
  edit : i 've just realised you were replying about american biscuits , but oh well . 
  more excuses to make myself hungry for sweet snacks with pretty pictures . 
  i always go to museums , particularly the imperial war museum and british museum when i 'm in london . 
  i love the national gallery and tate modern , too , and my home town has a particularly good museum inside a norman castle which i always try and visit when i can . 
  i think most of us do appreciate the history and culture of the country , but sometimes it 's a case of ` oh , well , it 's always been there ' , like the roman wall that goes all the way around my town . 
  i used to just sit and hang out on it all the time when i was a teenager , but all the americans i 've shown it to have been completely astounded that there 's a 2000 year old wall just sitting there , getting passed by every day . 
  i * love * whistlejacket . 
  seeing it in real life is just * such * an experience . 
  * qualify as a teacher and get a good placement somewhere, 
  * start a masters , possibly in classics ? 
  * get a mortgage ( hahahahaha fat chance ), 
  * start a family, 
  i would say i like to dress to flatter my boobs rather than have them the focal point . 
  i mean , they 're pretty much the biggest part of me anyway so i ca n't get away from them , but i like it when they look good in whatever i 'm wearing . 
  i do tend towards wearing long accessories that pull the eye downwards though , like scarves or long necklaces to minimize them a bit . 
  well done !, 
  you 're almost there !,
