  be polite , be friendly , dress well . 
  you do n't have to justify yourself to anyone about your marriage , and it 's really none of their business , but you also do n't have to make everything happen so quickly , either . 
  they always pushed the importance of work , and i 've had a job pretty continuously since i was 14/15 . 
  i was never allowed to just hang around doing nothing . 
  i * had * to work , even if it was only a few hours a week in a local chinese takeaway , or doing a paper round . 
  with procrastination ( reddit , tumblr ) , escapism ( fanfic , youtube ) and tea . 
  so much tea . 
  fun song , but ridiculously overplayed until i get completely sick of it . 
  much like most christmas songs , really . 
  i 'm from essex . 
  yes for secondary school because i went to a girls only school and loved it . 
  we had a higher emphasis on stem subjects and were always encouraged to be the best students we could possibly be . 
  it was a relaxed , supportive environment , and i think it did a world of good for me . 
  there was also an all-boys school down the road and two mixed comprehensives next door , so socialising with boys was never an issue . 
  i mean , i do n't think teenagers spending six hours a day only with their own gender is such a big deal anyway - there 's eighteen other hours in the day , and school holidays to mix with boys . 
  it 's not like going to a single sex school means you get put into a glass box for five years or anything . 
  most girls still had boyfriends and guy friends and plenty of hobbies . 
  i definitely did , and i did loads of mixing with the other gender after school and on weekends . 
  i love it . 
  i 've had flings with a couple of french guys before and i always * loved * the way they spoke . 
  do n't try and get rid of your accent !, 
  you 're only 17 . 
  you are going to change so much as a person in the next ten years , you have no idea . 
  please please please put your education first and go to the best place for * you * , not for your relationship . 
  you have no idea where life might send you , and you really do need to be realistic about where you and she might end up within the next five to ten years . 
   i also do n't want to have to choose my college based on our relationship as i know it may not work out and my college choice is a huge decision that i 've been looking forward to my whole life . 
  this is the right attitude to have . 
  you do know what you need to do op , you 're just scared to do it . 
  that 's okay , too . 
  just trust in it !, 
  the programme builds you up slowly and consistently . 
  you 'll be doing 8/10/20 minute runs before you know it !, 
  ** do you feel depressed about not having a relationship ? 
  ** only when i 've been looking at facebook too much . 
  when i do n't compare myself to my friends , i feel plenty better about myself . 
  ** what does it mean for your self worth ? 
  ** i get lots of self worth from my own achievements . 
  i 'm doing well academically , i 've been hitting little hobby achievements like running 20 mins doing c25k the other night , i did well at a dog show the other week ... things like that . 
  ** what do you think of the men who are so upset about it ? 
  do you have any advice for them ? 
  ** there are bigger things in life than whether you have had the title ` boyfriend ' at some point or not . 
  not having a partner is not the be all and end all , and a partner is not going to make your life magically happy and shiny . 
  also , no one cares . 
  seriously , no one gives a toss whether you 've been a relationship before or not . 
  people are honestly not that interested in your life or as invested as you are . 
  think about it : do you honestly * honestly * care that vague acquaintance johnny has never had a girlfriend/boyfriend before ? 
  do you even think about it ? 
  because that 's precisely how much time vague acquaintance johnny thinks about your own relationship status ; i.e. 
  never . 
  it 's strange , is n't it ? 
  i definitely think there 's more pressure on guys to have girlfriends than on girls to have boyfriends . 
  i know far more single women than single guys . 
  nope . 
  pretty sure tom hiddleston is single after all , and he could have his pick of basically the whole world . 
  it sounds a little silly , but natasha romanoff from the mcu . 
  she 's such a cool , strong woman who gets stuff done , but she 's also allowed to be a little bit scared and unsure of herself and her place in the world . 
  she 's incredibly smart , tech savvy , language proficient , a little flirty and very self assured . 
  i love the way scarlett johanssen plays her . 
  also , her haircut in [ captain america : winter soldier ] ( http://www.flicksandbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/scarlett-johansson-black-widow-5.jpg ) is badass and i 'm growing mine out to look the same . 
  dump stuff on the side , stick on tv ( pointless is usually on ) prep dinner for the dog while he 's giving me puppy eyes . 
  feed dog . 
  make a cup of tea . 
  go upstairs and get changed into jeans and hoody . 
  come back down and wash up dog bowl and wipe his face so he does n't drool dog food everywhere . 
  empty dishwasher/washing machine/tumble dryer . 
  if it 's wednesday , do the recycling . 
  dinner follows at some point . 
  god , yes . 
  i love a sharply dressed man . 
  it just does something that makes me go all gooey .

  oh my god that man knows how to dress . 
  [ jeremy renner ] ( http://moviebuzzers.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/jeremy-renner.jpg ), 
  and okay , okay , i know all those guys are celebrities and dressed by stylists , but they all look * good * , and i think the choice of clothes helps so so much to achieve that . 
  how did i forget jgl ??!, 
  the man is [ king of sharp ] ( http://themanhasstyle.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/4157_instagram_the_man_has_style_joseph_gordon-levitt.jpg ) . 
  uh , no . 
  i have no intention of dating sex workers , i 'm afraid . 
  honestly , i do n't know what it is you put in the water , but american guys are all so * tall * !, 
  every american i know towers over me for some reason . 
  you all seem really sporty as well , though the fashion sense could do with some work . 
  i like the smarter european attitudes to dress , generally , and i think our british guys generally are more fashion conscious than americans . 
  i actually really like american ( and canadian ) guys . 
  you 're all friendly and chatty , i like how cheerful americans are and i 'm not so silly as to believe the stereotype that you 're all dumb and uneducated . 
  i 'd actually like to try dating an american at some point , maybe . 
  i 've calmed down a lot more and become much more assertive about what i want . 
  i 'm still driven by my heart but i 'm a lot less flighty and a lot more prepared to put in the work and graft time for what i want . 
  i also take * much * more care of my personal grooming . 
  i dress soooooo much better than i used to as a teenager , and now i love wearing dresses and skirts , which you never would have gone me in when i was 17 . 
  yeah , for sure . 
  i do n't think about the ins and outs of it ( snigger ) but i definitely picture the possibility of it happening . 
  maybe , but generally unlikely . 
  depends how optimistic i 'm feeling that day . 
  if you 're really stuck on warm weather then edinburgh will not be your bag as the wind can make it * very * cold , but it 's an extraordinarily beautiful city , and i think it 's silly to discount it out of hand . 
  the summer days barbequing in the meadows make it all worth the chilly winter ones !,
