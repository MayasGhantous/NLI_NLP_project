  i 'm just trying to apply to a really wide range of places and not getting too set on one location or style , and focusing on that one yes i know i * will * get some day . 
  spend loooooads of time on foreplay , do n't try and rush to the main event , even if you know that that night is the big night , so to say . 
  if she 's relaxed and aroused , you will fit - vaginas are designed for babies to come out of , after all !, 
  take it really slow , and do n't get too hung up on it all . 
  first times are always a bit weird and fumbly . 
  big amazing orgasms can come later . 
  this bit is just all about figuring each other out and what feels good . 
  you 'll be fine . 
  i 'm not massively picky , but i know what i like . 
  completely fine . 
  there will be plenty of soft drinks available like lemonade and coke , and if you go to a chain pub like wetherspoons they will have a kids menu with smaller portions to choose from . 
  as a lady who is 29 , i would never ever ever date an 18 year old guy . 
  i wo n't even date 25 year olds . 
  18 year olds have no idea who they really are , and the fact that she is apparently trying to mould you into who she thinks you should be , and criticising you for not being ` the best ' is very worrying . 
  it says a lot that her exes are porn barons and guys who smash up expensive cars , quite honestly . 
  * she * is the one with the issue here , not you , and she is the burden . 
  get rid of that albatross around your neck , and go be fabulous at fashion week . 
  you can do much better than her . 
   i really was wondering if her thoughts were `` he must not like me '' or rather `` he 's too timid for me . '', 
  if i was her , that would honestly be exactly what i was thinking . 
  four dates in and he wo n't even cuddle , let alone kiss when i 'm clearly inviting it ? 
  must be that he does n't really like me after all . 
  i do get being shy , i do , but you have to give * something * or say something about how nervous you are , otherwise it 's just like trying to date a brick . 
  you did n't try just putting your arm around her or anything ? 
  michael was a * total * tool . 
  stupidest decision 16 year old me ever made . 
  marvel movies !, 
  does anyone want to gush about steve rogers and bucky barnes with me , or how tony stark is actually a really cool guy all wrapped up in being an arse to everyone , or black widow 's history with the winter soldier ? 
  because wow , i * really * want to gush about it with someone , and / r/marvelstudios can only get you so far . 
  you 'd love my home town - we have a roman wall running around it that you could go and sit and have a picnic on if you want , and a norman castle built over roman temple ruins ( burned down by boudicca ) that you can wander around at your leisure . 
  oh , and a restaurant with musket holes in from a siege during the english civil war in 1648 . 
  history in abundance !, 
  [ here you go ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9fzhngdfzo&amp;list=pltgwodbiyvf3xkny6_kdvh5tcoug15yuv ) , all in a neat youtube playlist . 
  right first , i think . 
  now i 'm questioning my coat dressing preferences !, 
  having a quick look , [ this sheet ] ( http://www.bab.org.uk/downloads/3c9_weapons_protocol.pdf ) is the advice given by the british aikido board about transporting live blades to training . 
  if it 's just a one time thing and you have n't actually bought a sword yet , you might be better off containing theatre stage management departments in sheffield and asking if they have any appropriate prop swords in their armoury that you can do promotional shots of . 
  sm folks are very nice , and usually have a big store of props that they 're happy to hire out for a fee . 
  the national theatre in london also has a massive prop warehouse that you could contact if sheffield ca n't help . 
  i 'm guessing yes , yes they would . 
  zingless togetherness forever and ever for lonely guys , amen . 
  as someone who used to do stage management , i suspect regional theatres will have better props stores than universities , or at least will have better contacts to local armourers . 
  when sourcing props , it was always good practice for us to keep books of where we bought or borrowed props from , so they should have a good name or two if they do n't have anything in the armoury already . 
  give a few of them a call . 
  best of luck !, 
  rarely to never . 
  i 'm rubbish at wearing matching socks , let alone matching knickers . 
  seriously , i do n't care . 
  as long as he does n't brag about past conquests or any of that crap , we 're fine . 
  that 's the one !, 
  i 'd say `` when have you ever listened to what i wanted you to do ? '', 
  because i imagine my future offspring will be as bullheaded about what they want , or do n't want , as i am . 
  just the fact that steve flew the plane into the freaking atlantic ocean like a * week * after his best friend died * screams * passionate grief , right ? 
  right ? 
  and technically in winter soldier it 's only been about two years for steve since bucky died , and he 's so * lonely * , and all he wants is his friend , except his friend is trying to kill him and oh my god all the feels . 
  [ this amazing blog ] ( http://hellotailor.blogspot.co.uk/2014/04/captain-america-winter-soldier-tragedy.html ) just sums it up for me . 
  apparently there 's lots of backstory coming up for natasha in aou , which is so exciting !, 
  it 's so good . 
  i 'm in the uk , but i 've been streaming it every week and it 's so fun !, 
  and chris pratt !, 
  how good was he as star-lord ? 
  gotg was just amazing . 
  i got the movie concept art book a few weeks ago , and it 's just gorgeous . 
  all those alien planet sets and costumes and props !, 
  it 's [ this one ] ( http://www.amazon.co.uk/marvels-guardians-galaxy-movie-slipcase/dp/0785185534/ref=sr_1_1?ie=utf8&amp;qid=1422574186&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=art+of+guardians+of+the+galaxy ) , and it 's so worth the money !, 
  it 's all about balance . 
  sure , no one should be martha brady all the time , but people who are in constant sour puss dry moods wind me up something chronic too - just lighten up and crack a joke once in a while , will you ? 
  find a happy midway between unicorn sunshine and wednesday addams . 
  for what it 's worth , one of the senior managers at my part time bar job is * really * dry and no nonsense , and i 've heard ( drunk ) patrons moan at him plenty of times to get a sense of humour and lighten up . 
  so no , i do n't think it 's just women at all . 
  the mcu has made me really really fond of steve rogers/captain america , especially cap 2 . 
  he tries so hard to do the right thing , even when it leaves him all alone . 
  i 'm also a little bit in love with black widow/natasha romanoff , and tony stark , especially rdj tony stark . 
  oh , and peter quill !, 
  technically not a superhero i suppose , but he 's still supercool . 
  cocky as in wry and witty , fine . 
  i 'm british , we like our humour dry . 
  cocky as in arrogant or pedantic , take it somewhere else . 
  this man does not respect you . 
  you break up and ask for space because he has hurt you , so he breaks into your house and reads your diary ? 
  you ask him to leave and he refuses , and then has a fight with you ?!, 
  what the fuck , op . 
  he 's saying all the nice pretty words and sincere apologies , but what are his actions actually * doing * ? 
  he 's not sorry . 
  i imagine he 's pretty happy he got you to talk to him , and sleep with him , actually . 
  i do n't think he 's even the slightest bit apologetic for * breaking into your house and reading your private things * . 
  at 2am !, 
  while you were in the shower !, 
  change your locks . 
  tell a friend . 
  go stay with someone else for a while . 
  cut * all contact * . 
  he is not good for you . 
  in fact , i think he 's pretty goddamn insane , all things considered . 
  `` you 're such a chavvy little knob '' . 
  add in an appropriate geographical insult for extra effect . 
  `` where are you from , milton keynes / slough / skegness / romford ? '', 
  well , he 's back in canada now and i 'm in blighty , so ... yes . 
  he 's got pretty far away . 
  the only thing i could have changed was saying yes when he first asked me out , but i was with someone else .
