  more time spent nurturing his hobby or building a portfolio ? 
  i think he just needs a target to aim for , and you can help him figure it out . 
  once he knows what he 'd like to work towards , then you can say `` i 'll support you to do xyz '' , but right now he needs a framework . 
  hopefully that will help him feel a bit less panicky . 
  ** hardcore history ** by dan carlin - they 're like three hours long , but * super * in depth , researched lecture series about historical events . 
  right now he 's doing a series on the first world war , which is amazing . 
  ** this american life . 
  ** friday night comedy ** from the bbc . 
  the now show is brilliant and so on point . 
  it is all about british news , so some bits might go over your head if you 're international . 
  ** more or less ** , also from the bbc . 
  it 's a statistical analysis of this weeks news headlines . 
  it sounds dull , but honestly it 's really clever and well done . 
  definitely give it a go . 
  no problem at all !, 
  just get him thinking about what he 'd like to do , but also what he feels would be really important in a career . 
  does he want to make a difference for people , or need to be really creative in his work , or really hands-on ? 
  the career title is n't quite so important as much as the things he wants to end up * doing * - or not doing , as it sometimes ends up !, 
  get him thinking about the big picture , but also the short term goals he needs to take in order to get there . 
  i 'm sure once he 's got an aim and taken a few small steps towards it , he 'll feel less frustrated . 
   is devoting all this extra time and putting myself under so much more stress worth it just to get a couple more as ? 
  think of it this way ; now , a-levels and university are the * only * time in your life when you get six weeks holiday to destress from exams and unwind , and these set a foundation for the next five or six years of your life . 
  do n't let future you look back at now and think ` god , i really could have done better if i 'd tried ' . 
  it 's the most disappointing feeling . 
  i went to my great-cousins wedding about ten years ago in ireland . 
  it was a big family do and we all stayed in a hotel , which also had a wedding the night before theirs . 
  all of the first wedding 's guests got totally trashed , had a massive fight and smashed up a couple of mirrors in the corridors . 
  it was a grand old time . 
  i remember hearing that two guys had a punch-up , fell into my grandmothers room , picked themselves up , dusted themselves off , apologised , went outside and closed the door and carried on fighting again !, 
  i distinctly remember coming downstairs the next morning and seeing half a dozen sleeping irish guests draped all over the hotel lobby furniture . 
  we 're pretty sure there were several of them that tagged along to our wedding , too . 
  i have no compliments for , or any attraction to , idiotic men who get themselves mixed up in street fights . 
  it 's the least attractive thing i could possibly think of , and i would do everything possible to avoid blokes who think physical fighting is cool . 
  it 's not . 
  it 's just stupid . 
  my dad 's first cousin . 
  i know there are bases , innings , batters , pitchers , shortstops and homeruns . 
  that 's about it , but i did get to go to a baseball game in anaheim once and had to sing the songs , which was quite fun . 
  for costs , do n't forget to factor in to your budget that you 'll have to buy a license if you want to watch any live tv at all ( i.e. 
  programmes as they are broadcast , and not just netflix . 
  it 's # 145 a year . 
  cars need a valid mot certificate , road tax and insurance before they 're allowed on the road . 
  on monday i 'm going to copenhagen all by myself for five days . 
  it was a # 40 flight each way , so i thought what the hell . 
  i have n't been abroad in four years , and i 've been * dying * to get out of the uk again , so i 'm very excited !, 
  people can say whatever they like on reddit . 
  that 's fine . 
  they 're allowed to post their comments ( in the right places ) with their commentary and opinions . 
  they can also be told to shut the fuck up , that their language is disrespectful and that their opinions are n't welcome . 
  free speech goes both ways , and i think a lot of people forget that . 
  it does n't have to be an either-or situation . 
  cutting down on drinking to lose weight is a great idea , but let yourself have one or two every so often , and relax with some friends . 
  one beer every couple of weeks wo n't sabotage your calorie count . 
  nights out do n't have to be crazy drink-until-you 're - paralytic affairs , but you do n't have to be as sober as a monk to be healthy , either . 
  find a middle line , and some friends that like having a chat in the pub as opposed to massive nights out clubbing , and you 'll be fine . 
  i got one free when i upgraded my mobile phone contract , but i never really use it . 
  i 'm constantly on my phone ( samsung galaxy s5 ) for general reddit browsing , and on my laptop for everything else , and my tablet falls in an odd pit of non-use somewhere in the middle . 
  it 's been sitting on my bedside table with a flat battery for about two months now . 
  i crave big clocks . 
  always have done . 
  just a massive one , vintage style , right there in the kitchen . 
  all my friends would be so impressed , you know ? 
  `` speaking , how can i help ? '', 
  it sounds formal , but it 's what i say all day at work anyway , so it 's just the natural response for me . 
  esfp apparently , which makes sense . 
  likes lots of company , doing something new all the time and has poor long-term planning skills . 
  very apt !, 
  exasperated , mostly . 
  not that i 'm clicking through to it , but posts like that are just so reddit . 
  yes , a couple of times , but it never really works out . 
  if my gut feeling is n't there , then a second or third date never helps inspire anything . 
  not really . 
  it 's too tiring !, 
  i tend to just message one guy at a time until that either progresses or fizzles out . 
  time and distance , but even then there are always some guys who will just stick in your heart in a fond ` aw , if only ' kind of way . 
  you just have to learn to get past it . 
  this is hollywood . 
  according to them , every role ( except the comedy sidekick or homely well - meaning friend ) requires a hot actor to play it . 
  it 's how you get bums on seats . 
  well , i 'm a friendly , open kind of person and get along with pretty much everyone i meet without much difficulty . 
  that feels like a baseline achieved to me . 
  sleep . 
  as much sleep as possible . 
  honestly , the only years i did n't get drastically sick from working the edinburgh fringe ( and one year it gave me bronchitis ! ), 
  were the years that i got regular proper sleep . 
  take a few days off work and go back to bed !, 
  also , regular paracetamol helps you feel less like crappy crap , and as many hot drinks as possible . 
  do n't be offended when i just want to do things by myself . 
  i like going to the cinema by myself , i 'm travelling abroad by myself next week , and i like making my own plans by myself . 
  i will go and do things alone and not invite you . 
  you have to be cool with that to get along with me . 
  surely if the argument follows that there is a gun in a house that has a physically strong violent man and a physically weak woman victim , then the likely outcome will be of the * man * getting the weapon , right ? 
  and then , what ? 
  just throwing it away ? 
  or is the honestly more likely outcome an escalation of violence up to and including shooting ? 
  if we 're at the cinema , nothing . 
  just water . 
  if we 're at home , wine . 
  beer makes me bloaty . 
  i do n't ` deal ' , because i do n't care .
