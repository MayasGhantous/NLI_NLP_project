  they 're green to me , but i can see the argument for blue . 
  yeah , of course . 
  when i teched at the edinburgh fringe , my venue would finish and close at about 3am and i did all sorts of wandering around town afterwards with friends . 
  it 's perfectly fine . 
  super hot , but strangely hotter with unwashed hair and ranger clothes than when he 's all washed and preened as the king . 
  best aragorn is spooky bree aragorn for sure . 
  i like american guys - for some reason , you all seem ridiculously tall , which i like . 
  americans are always really chatty and friendly too , which appeals to me , and you 're generally more direct than british men . 
  i 'd do n't think i 'd universally fancy all american or canadian men just because of your nationality , but i 'd happily try dating one . 
  oooh , muddy wet-haired aragorn * before * the battle of helm 's deep is super hot , too . 
  that shot where he just pushes open the huge double doors with the light behind him ? 
  yummmmmm . 
  magazines , i think !, 
  and wine . 
  i do sales for my dad 's company , so i 'm sure that some new customers have had the occasional ` are they married or related ? ', 
  query after a meeting . 
  it does n't bother me , my dad 's pretty cool . 
  freshly washed , very straight ( i love my ghds ) , dark red and just above shoulder length . 
  i 've got a business meeting this morning so i need to look smart . 
  i 'm growing it out from a short asymmetric style , and my colour is fading a bit , but i like it right now . 
  i 'm aiming to end up with hair like [ scarlett johansson in captain america : winter soldier ] ( http://www.flicksandbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/scarlett-johansson-black-widow-5.jpg ) . 
  just put it in . 
  be confident in your likes and dislikes !, 
  i do drink tea to get me started in the morning , but it 's really more of a routine habit thing rather than a caffeine stimulant thing . 
  a cold glass of water works just as well for waking up . 
  tea is very much a comfort drink for us . 
  frustrating , i imagine . 
  i 'm always running around with a busy schedule and i 'm * rubbish * at texting . 
  it would probably be a very long , very thorough exercise in patience and/or persistence . 
  oh i 've got a schmoozy networking business thing coming up too !, 
  i did a b2b couple of months ago which was a little nervewracking going in , but it was actually really fun . 
  most of the conversations started off with ` what does your business do ' ? 
  or asking about the networking schedule that was in place there . 
  with b2c talk i feel like it tends to be about projects that you know they 've got going on , expansion plans , or about things that you know they 've done personally , like holidays or new pets or whatever . 
  people love talking about the holidays they 've got planned !, 
  half of my b2c schmoozing tends to either be about vacation time or changes they 're making to their businesses . 
  my brother asked his fiancees father for permission , but i 'd hate for that to happen with me . 
  i feel like it 's really outdated , personally - i do n't need my dad 's permission or blessing to go and have a wedding . 
  i would prefer just to make a little announcement to them once i 've got engaged and go from there . 
  i have one co-worker who calls me pel , which i quite like , and i would n't mind more people using it . 
  everyone else just calls me by my normal full name or another diminuitive which i made up with a friend in secondary school . 
  i think she 's a great ambassador for the country , and is working bloody hard at eighty-odd years old . 
  my eighty-five year old nanna can hardly go out to dinner in her wheelchair without being completely knackered , and the queen still holds garden parties , formal banquets and does occasional international functions . 
  she 's worked hard all of her life , and i really admire her for that . 
  charles , on the other hand ... 
  ** work experience ** : i know nothing about this industry/any industry , the way it 's structured or how jobs in here/anywhere work , but i think it might appeal to me . 
  i 'm going to volunteer for a few weeks with this company to find out . 
  everything is paid for out of my own pocket . 
  ** internship ** : i like this career sector and want to work in it full time some day . 
  i 'm going to volunteer for a month/six weeks to work with this company to form networking contacts and get a real feel for the industry . 
  this will help me know whether i really want to work in it or not and what i need to do to get there . 
  i might get travel expenses or lunch paid , if i 'm lucky . 
  ** industrial placement ** : i 'm halfway through a degree with the intention of some day working in this sector . 
  i know the career requirements , and the job ladder structure and have some in-depth knowledge of the subject area that applies to it ( i.e. 
  engineering ) . 
  i 'm going to work with this company for six months on a standard entry-level wage to consolidate my knowledge and gain applicable credits for my cv . 
  they might offer me a job at the end of it , but i know that this has a finite time limit before i go back to my degree . 
  other employers will see this favourably . 
  seriously , an idiot . 
  you need to go on tv to get a makeover in order to work in * sales * ? 
  who * is * this guy ? 
  was he brad pitt/chris evans-style gorgeous himself ? 
  was he also saying this to the men attending the workshop ? 
  op , please do n't listen to him . 
  as a sales person myself , all you need to be good in sales is to be * likeable * , not to be drop dead gorgeous . 
  people buy from people they like , not from people they think are supermodels . 
  i would go back to your usual manager ( you said this was just an interim office , right ? 
  ) , ask to give some feedback on the training day and then mention that this guy made some unprofessional comments that you did n't appreciate , did n't feel were constructive and were n't helpful . 
  this really is the sort of thing that needs to go through official channels , and it 's * really * an unprofessional thing for him to do . 
  it 's true that you need to be smart and presentable in sales , but i think there 's a difference between ` presentable ' and ` you need a follicle transplant ' . 
  clearly this shows that the company is more focused on how their staff * look * than how they * work * , which does n't exactly shine a very nice light on them . 
  there are other companies that are more focused on how their staff interact with their customers , and the ongoing service that they can provide with them rather than how they look on an initial meeting . 
  i would really start polishing your cv and having a look around at the things that other businesses can offer . 
  in the meantime , swing by to / r/makeupaddiction and / r/skincareaddiction - they 'll have some great tips for you on helping your skin out so you can feel more polished for all of your future job interviews and sales presentations . 
  op , look at this rationally . 
  how long have you even been together ? 
  you do n't know if you can stay in the country you 're in at the moment . 
  you ca n't work . 
  you ca n't claim benefits . 
  you do n't have a stable home . 
  you will be entirely reliant on him . 
  it 's not just that you 're going to struggle with cash , you are going to have * nothing * to live on . 
  baby is going to need * so much stuff * that you will need him to provide , and you do n't even know if you 'll get a visa yet !, 
  getting an abortion is entirely up to you , it 's your choice and your body , but you ** need ** to think this through . 
  there 's not really prose that resonates with me as a life metaphor , but there are pieces of prose that i just think are * beautiful * , and stick in my head for a long , long time . 
  i love richard 's trial speech in shakespeare 's richard ii , when he 's being asked by bolingbroke to give up the crown :, 
  * `` on this side my hand , and on that side yours . 
  now is this golden crown like a deep well, 
  that owes two buckets , filling one another ,, 
  the emptier ever dancing in the air ,, 
  the other down , unseen and full of water :, 
  that bucket down and full of tears am i ,, 
  drinking my griefs , whilst you mount up on high . 
  it 's just so powerful - richard the current king is being pushed down to obscurity and eventual death , while his beloved cousin who swore love to him once upon a time is climbing up on his grief to climb the dizzy heights of monarchy , and it 's all because of that crown richard is holding . 
  it 's wonderful imagery . 
  the way ben whishaw does that speech in the hollow crown series is so moving , too . 
  pretty universal , but if i initiate something while i 'm wearing them , it 's okay to respond . 
  for instance , i was on the tube yesterday with my earphones in , and a guy got on with two whippet crossbreeds . 
  the dogs came to sniff me , i made a fuss of them , he asked if i minded , i took out my earphones and we started a conversation from there . 
  i never really get them ?
