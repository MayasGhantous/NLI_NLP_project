  really ? 
  i 'm going to have to massively disagree with you on this . 
  sure , she 's in love with op , but she pushes * every single other person * away . 
  op has said he 's never known his wife to have friends . 
  she badmouths his family . 
  she thinks everyone hates her . 
  she not only decides that she dislikes someone , but she * actively * makes them understand that . 
  she believes everyone who is not op is out to get her , or hurt her . 
  she can apparently only interact diplomatically with people who are sat behind a computer screen . 
  does that really sound like a happy person to you ? 
  i think it sounds like someone who is insecure , afraid and very , very miserable . 
  seriously ? 
  how can you seriously say that someone who is not just introverted but acts like a goddamn porcupine to almost everybody is normal ? 
  she 's already drawing a wedge between herself and ops family and this is only one year in to their marriage !, 
  it 's only going to get worse from here . 
   maybe it will wear off one day, 
  you 've already said that it 's escalated since you married . 
  you 're only one year in . 
  i do n't think things are just going to magically get better , op . 
  do you want children ? 
  what happens if you have kids and she , for whatever reason , decides that she does n't like one of them ? 
   from what i 've heard from her she did n't seem like she tried to stop him as much as she could have , and eventually i feel like she really did n't care about the fact that she was being raped . 
  i. ... just ... what . 
  she * did n't fight back enough * ?!, 
  how much would have been ` acceptable ' to you for you to legitimise your girlfriends forcible rape ?!, 
  what the * fuck * ?!, 
  stop being such a whiny little child and ** take your girlfriend to the police station ** . 
  oh my god . 
  if she 's your wife , is n't the night leading up to the loss of virginity usually the wedding ? 
  that 's normally a pretty special day . 
  i do n't compromise on buying clothes anymore . 
  if i was n't sure on something i bought it anyway , ` just in case ' . 
  now i only buy if i try it on and love it straight away . 
  i also buy more for quality now - pricier and i shop less often but worth it . 
  definitely !, 
  `` i think i like it '' = `` i 'm never going to wear it '' . 
  if you do n't love it , do n't buy it !, 
  and the opposite too , of course . 
  i do n't remember many of my dreams , but the ones i do remember all seem to be like action films . 
  i 'm normally running down corridors from lots of bad guys who are shooting at me . 
  there 's normally someone else with me , and we get involved in some kind of violent shoot-em-out ; lots of blood and bodies and whatnot . 
  i really have no idea why my subconscious makes me think i 'm jason bourne . 
  favourite : pets , books , films and gossiping about other friends . 
  yes , i 'm a fishwife and i enjoy it . 
  least favourite : politics . 
  it always ends up in some kind of argument unless we 're all talking about how much of a plonker nigel farage is . 
  if you 're travelling for three hours and she 's paying you thirty quid then it 's working out as # 10 an hour . 
  sorted . 
  i know a-levels are stressful , but your nanna also is n't going to be around for long . 
  one hour out of your week really is n't that big a deal , and trust me , when she 's gone you 'll be wishing you just took that hour to be a nice grandson . 
  it 's not going to be forever , it 's just going to be for a couple of months . 
  you need a break from study too !, 
  just say yes . 
  it 's not going to kill you , and you 'll make thirty quid from it . 
  it boils down to this : you have changed your views . 
  he has n't . 
  nothing else in your relationship has changed . 
  you have n't married him under false pretenses . 
  he is just as compassionate and as caring as he was yesterday , a year ago or ten years ago . 
  * you * are the one who has decided to change something about yourself . 
  you need to be okay with this , instead of pushing it all off onto him . 
  i do n't lift because the idea of it bores me . 
  if other people enjoy it and get lots out of it , more power to them . 
  it 's the way you 've framed the question that means you 're getting the wrong responses , not people misreading . 
  what people are reading it as is `` i 've become vegan . 
  how do i make my husband become vegan to show that he cares ? '', 
  what you 're actually asking is `` i 've expanded my ethical views and have realised that my husband does n't have compassion for anyone or anything outside of his immediate family . 
  how do i deal with this ? '', 
  i 've done the fade on guys i 've gone on a date or two with , yeah . 
  i 've never suddenly disappeared on someone that i 'm actually in an established relationship with . 
  yes , once . 
  it was a very , very intense environment where you spent all day every day with the same group of people and physically could not avoid them . 
  i went out with one guy but fancied another and he fancied me . 
  he was dating another girl who he had got together with after asking me out . 
  we ended up getting drunk together one night and going back to my room , but i stopped it before it went further than kissing . 
  i know it was the right thing to do , but i wish i had n't . 
  i 'm pretty much brand new to marvel comics , but after seeing frames of the ** matt fraction ** hawkeye comic on tumblr i went straight to marvel unlimited and * devoured * it . 
  so so so good !, 
  you get to learn more about clint 's canon background including the relationship with his brother and abusive father . 
  clint is so self-depreciating and so * normal * , and i love his team-up with kate bishop , although it does detour a bit when she nips off to los angeles for a while . 
  this series also has the amazing issue # 19 where fraction brings in the fact that clint is canonically deaf and uses asl signs in the comic . 
  it 's just so effective - i must have read it about ten times now . 
  i was never really into that part of clint 's storyline until i read # 19 and now i really * really * want them to use it in the mcu . 
  the artwork is really minimalistic and stylish , and it 's so easy to read . 
  if you 're a newbie like me , absolutely give it a go . 
  ianal but i ca n't imagine you could seriously put in a lawsuit for emotional damage after voluntarily cutting off contact a decade ago . 
  i do n't do exercise out of necessity , i do it because i like it . 
  that 's why i do things like gymnastics - it 's really fun , i have a good social network and it puts me in a good mood . 
  dragging myself to the gym and hauling some weights up and down just to eat a slice of cake sounds terrible to me , and i 'd always be finding excuses not to go . 
  i know . 
  it was hyperbole . 
  the point still stands - lifting weights as a form of fitness would bore me and would n't be a good enough incentive for me to go to the gym . 
  none . 
  in the uk you get accepted onto a named degree programme and study your speciality from day 1 . 
  the idea of changing subjects around is really really bizarre to me . 
  to look a little slimmer and to fit my clothes better . 
  i 've definitely put it on in the last couple of years , and i do like my body plenty , but i 'd just like to knock a little bit off . 
  mid-length , almost to my shoulders . 
  i have had it short for a long time ( asymmetric-bob style ) , but i decided to grow it out as a change . 
  i 'd like to get it to collarbone length-ish , i think .
