  seriously ? 
  you even said it yourself :, 
   the act of assigning numbers to attractiveness is frowned upon in aw . 
  i recommend giving this a shot in askmen . 
   what if a stone fell out ? 
  what if i lost it ? 
  what if it was stolen ? 
  oh god , yes . 
  could you imagine that poor girls panic if it slipped off one day ? 
  symbolism for a normal ring is bad enough , and even more so when it 's a family heirloom , but the pressure of losing my theoretical husband 's beloved late girlfriend 's ring would be awful !, 
  i like the humour best . 
  there 's always this lovely dry wit bubbling in the answer threads and a lot of comments make me laugh out loud . 
  not static images , but gifs work very nicely , especially m/m ones . 
  i prefer having the audio there , though . 
  oh tumblr has loads if you go hunting . 
  i 'm not following any nsfw ones right now , but i 'm sure others in here can rec some good ones . 
  i much prefer him with the sunglasses off . 
  the glasses on sort of make me think of harry potter , you know ? 
  and then i totally do n't fancy dan radcliffe so it makes the hotness go away , and then charlie cox ends up back in his ablicious clingy black shirt or sans clingy black shirt which is even * better * and all the hotness comes straight back . 
  godfrey 's cheeky little smile !, 
  and that eyeliner !, 
  i 'm in love . 
  oh my giddy aunt . 
  that fassbender photo ... 
  ugh chris evans . 
  such a perfect man . 
  did you see how drunk he was at the age of ultron premiere though ?? 
  i heard he gets really anxious about public events , and i think he might have had one too many to steady the nerves !, 
  nothing will ever eclipse my love for tom hiddleston . 
  he 's completely adorable in every way . 
  i loved natalie dormer as [ cressida ] ( https://40.media.tumblr.com/c4d799ae214b76009eb516f7d984e8a6/tumblr_ndfhedlosn1s6bxzqo1_500.png ) in the hunger games too . 
  she 's just all around gorgeous . 
  deadpool looks like it 's going to be amazing !, 
  i 'm so excited !, 
  you do what * you * want , and do n't give a single shit about what your ex thinks . 
  delaying a date because you 're worried about what he thinks is just allowing him to keep control of you . 
  he has * no * right to get mad that you are going out to coffee with other men . 
  you are ** single ** and he is the ** ex ** . 
  if you want to go meet this guy , then go and have fun . 
  if you think it 's too soon and you need some space first to be single and get over the ex , then ask the other guy for some time . 
  either way is totally okay . 
  yes , because my skin looks much better with foundation , and i 've been self conscious about my bad skin since i was about thirteen . 
  nostalgia/nostalgic maybe ? 
  i always feel a longing to go back to edinburgh and the fringe , which feels sort of nostalgic to me . 
   and as soon as the characters do it they become less interesting . 
  god yes !, 
  why is that ?? 
  ust is so much hotter than actual sex scenes . 
  i 'd be much happier if half of the fics i read skipped the smut and just kept the lingering looks instead . 
  i think this is half the reason i 'm in love with bucky barnes/winter soldier fics right now . 
  you can not get more traumaed than poor brain-wiped cryo-stored amputee brainwashed assassin bucky . 
  all i want to do is hug him . 
  i think the spoiler tag ( without the full stop ) is this one ? 
  [ spoiler description ] . 
  ( #s `` your spoiler text '' ), 
  creates [ this spoiler tag ] ( #s `` this spoiler tag '' ), 
  i just checked and it works okay in my live preview ? 
  it 's normally the speech marks that i stumble over , though . 
  apple crumble fresh out of the oven and slathered in double cream . 
  oh my god , have you never tried crumble ? 
  it 's the best and [ so easy ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/applecrumble_2971 ) . 
  pour drained fruit and some sugar into a serving dish , mix flour , butter and sugar together until crumbly and spread luxuriously over the top . 
  bake for twenty minutes until it 's all golden brown and bubbly at the edges . 
  serve , with a lovely big jug of double cream to pour over the top . 
  also divine with apricots . 
  i was worried for you for a moment !, 
   crumble is my go-to winter warmer all kinds of cosy dish . 
  i love it so much . 
  i do n't think anything about them . 
  so a guy is single or a virgin or not interested in dating . 
  big deal . 
  it does n't affect my life , so why should i care ? 
  yeah . 
  do n't you have single and double cream ? 
  thicker , i think . 
  i actually found the [ wikipedia cream page ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cream ) ( of course there 's a wikipedia cream page ) and it looks like our single cream is your heavy cream , so - whipped heavy cream , i guess ? 
  it 's still pourable over your dessert . 
  it 's so luxurious !, 
  apricots or peaches swimming in double cream is the most wonderful summer treat . 
  see , i do n't like oaty crumble as much as floury crumble , but floury crumble with almonds and brown sugar mixed in is looooovely . 
  could not care less . 
  my longest dry spell so far was three years . 
  it makes zero difference to me how long someone has gone between getting laid . 
  free for me . 
  i 'm in the uk . 
  i went on a date with a guy who turned out to be in a wheelchair a couple of months ago . 
  i had a great time !, 
  he was funny , smart and really nippy with the chair and it was just another part of him . 
  it did n't bother me at all . 
  the only reason i did n't carry on dating him is because he has a couple of kids and that 's not what i 'm looking for . 
  on the actual date he picked the restaurant , so he knew what ones he could get in and out of , and that was really the only difference . 
  i had a lot of fun op , you should definitely give it a go . 
  my primary ( early 90s ) was just a big concrete playground with some targets painted on the walls , but we had a massive playing field . 
  my secondary was much better ; we had tennis courts , netball courts , a big field and basic athletics areas . 
  the primary 's been massively overhauled now though , and has loads of climbing equipment and play areas for them . 
   now i have this huge boundary to climb and i 'm not sure i 'm ready or willing to do it . 
  there 's your answer . 
  do n't force yourself to have a relationship for the sake of having a relationship when there are fundamental differences between what you want . 
  you 're only 20 . 
  she 's only 19 .
