  having to do all of that and then add on dealing with royal mail on top just does n't appeal to me . 
  they partially used a body double , but most of skinny steve was chris being altered in post production and digitally shrunk down . 
  there are videos about it on youtube , but he really wanted to act as much of steve as he possibly could . 
  it 's really amazing to watch them talk about it . 
  i had a night out in london and invited all of my friends . 
  i only had like eight friends turn up , but they were my very closest ones so it was perfect . 
  i stayed at my best pals and drank one of her bottles of champagne at midnight when i officially turned thirty . 
  mum came into town the next day and we went to see treasure island at the national theatre . 
  best birthday ever . 
  have i had any revelations since then ? 
  nope !, 
  i 'm the same as ever , just one year older and a little bit wiser . 
  i know what i want and i 'm prepared to work as hard as i can to get there , which is the real change that 's come out of my twenties . 
  i really put in the graft now to get to my goals . 
  i 'm in that position now ( two jobs , final month of a new degree ) and a relationship is absolutely not on my radar . 
  i barely have time to see friends or get a good nights sleep , let alone commit to a new boyfriend . 
  it is bottom of my priority list by a * massive * margin . 
  edit : aw , downvotey person , i 'm sorry my requirements of getting sleep trumps looking for a new relationship . 
  it 's very selfish , i know . 
  his flat was too beige . 
  i mean , i was n't * that * interested in him anyway , but it was just the nail in the coffin , really . 
  calling someone a tosser under my breath when they 've been irritating me always makes me feel better about the world . 
  i love bucky 's arc , just because it 's so tragic . 
  he was so cheery when he 's first on screen , then we see some effects of ptsd in him in that final train scene of first avenger , and by the time he gets to winter soldier he 's an almost soulless , traumatised killing machine . 
  his redemption arc is going to be so exciting to see . 
  i also love tony 's character , and we can see from aou that he 's still not over what happened to him with the wormhole and the battle of new york , which is great . 
  he went from an incredibly selfish , self-absorbed playboy to someone who is absolutely desperate to protect everyone around him . 
  these films have really extensive , long-lasting consequences , and i love that . 
   steve might go considerably further than we 're used to seeing him go to ensure his safety -- and be pretty mad about it . 
  i hope so !, 
  i like seeing a morally questionable steve - it 's so much more interesting to watch when a character 's not black and white good or bad . 
  up , but i usually close the cover on it . 
  normally i have fresh toast , buttered the moment it comes out of the toaster and a little sprinkling of jam . 
  my perfect breakfast would be a full english , or a full american with waffles , maple syrup and lots and lots of orange juice . 
  because free the nipple is a us movement and page 3 is from the sun , which is a uk paper ? 
  and because the us and europe have vastly different ideas about when nudity is okay and when it is n't ? 
  like , i get that the internet links us all up into one big cohesive community etc etc , but it 's still perfectly okay for two different countries to run two different campaigns , you know ? 
  it 's always good to have a destination in mind , so that you have something to work towards , but you do n't have to have one single career goal in mind . 
  it can be as vague as `` i 'd like to work in medicine '' or `` i 'd like to work in the arts '' or even `` i 'd like to work with people . '', 
  i 'm thirty and i 've changed my career twice already . 
  your opinions and preferences will change . 
  go with it . 
  it depends what you want !, 
  if you 'd prefer happiness over finances in your job , that 's totally okay and absolutely doable . 
  you just have to know what that might open up for you , or limit you to in the future . 
  * most * people are bad at sex the first time . 
  sex gets better when you know your partner and what they prefer . 
  also , you really do n't want to last thirty minutes or more !, 
  ouch !, 
  as a lady , it 's fifteen minutes ** tops ** otherwise sex gets dry and sore and really , * really * uncomfortable . 
  lots and lots of foreplay , and less of the pumping away . 
  i 'd say it 's okay to have a big blowout once in a while ( i 'm thinking one big shopping spree as a celebration for something huge , or massive holiday away ) , but the best way to live is in * moderation * . 
  being reckless and excessive can be exhilarating , but it always catches up with you . 
  do n't ruin things today for the future you tomorrow . 
  as if !, 
  you 're more financially stable so you can enjoy more of your hobbies , nicer holidays and close friends . 
  the older you get , the more you can do what * you * want . 
  i 'd ** much ** rather be 40 + than 16 again . 
  you might !, 
  you might also decide that you 're asexual or aromantic later down the line , and that 's perfectly okay , too . 
  the networking and social skills part . 
  the working hard to achieve your goals part . 
  the listening to instructions part . 
  the organisation to get all of your work done on time part . 
  the learning to work under authority part . 
  the ability to sometimes sit down and do what you really do n't want to do part . 
  the subject knowledge is n't important , but the skills for getting shit done bit really , really is . 
  * you * might be comfortable with your displays of affection , but he clearly is n't . 
  you should always respect what the other person wants - take this as a lesson for future relationships too . 
  if he dislikes hand holding , kissing and hugging then * respect his boundaries * . 
  find other ways of showing affection that he will appreciate . 
  it 's not all about what you think , or what you believe , and not wanting to kiss someone does n't mean that he 's not liberal minded . 
  it just means that he 's not comfortable . 
  be a good friend . 
  respect what he wants . 
  you can absolutely do what you want and do what makes you happy , but you also have to be aware that sometimes that comes with sacrifices . 
  working in the arts is very fulfilling but often means very unreliable jobs and not much money , for example . 
  it depends entirely on what makes you happy and where you want to be . 
  but no , it 's not that hard to achieve your goals if you 're prepared to put in the graft to get there . 
  big adult secret : we 're all constantly nervous that we 've made the wrong decision about * everything * . 
  that 's life . 
  you just have to learn how to trust your instincts and how to choose something , and also to have faith in your decisions . 
  it 's about confidence , really . 
  become more confident about yourself and you 'll become more comfortable with your choices . 
  i do n't really play video games that often anyway !, 
  i can do a mean mario kart and multi-player goldeneye , if that counts ? 
  oh i 've done this a few times before . 
  i bring a spare change of clothes ( including shoes ) that i 'd leave in my car and change into at the end of the day . 
  for makeup i 'd top up my concealer , foundation , mascara and eyeliner but i would n't bother removing and reapplying it . 
  deodorant is a must . 
  my mum completely changed career fields ( marketing to social work ) just before she turned 50 . 
  she could n't be happier . 
  i 'm retraining as a teacher from this september and i 'm 30 , so i 'll be 31 when i qualify , and i notice that i have worked * so * much harder to get my new degree than i ever did with my first one . 
  my motivation has tripled , and i am much more prepare to put in the graft that employers are looking for . 
  it 's much more acceptable now to switch careers multiple times during our lifetime . 
  you 'll be absolutely fine . 
  1 ) looking tidy and presentable is always important in life . 
  2 ) looking like a greek god is n't important , and attractiveness is subjective , but it 's important to look after your body and keep fit . 
  3 ) people are always going to be negative about other people 's choices . 
  it 's the way of the world .
