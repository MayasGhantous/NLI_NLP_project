  even if you 're tired , this is clearly something that means a lot to her , so i 'd say you really just have to suck it up a bit and sacrifice one weekend of just you-and-her time for you-her-and-family time . 
  it 'll fix point three , hopefully go towards fixing point one and help dispel her notion that all your family time is happy fun silly times and she 's just missing out . 
  the only * real * no no i think we have is money . 
  it 's crass to discuss big amounts of money like the cost of your house or your income or the price of your last holiday . 
  talking about little amounts like finding some bargain clothes on the high street or the price of a pint is absolutely fine , though . 
  i 'm right on the suffolk border so aspalls will always be my favourite , especially their organic , premier cru and mulled cider which is * heaven * on a cold day . 
  i have four on the go right now . 
  that 's pretty typical for me , hahahaha . 
  [ wild swans : three daughters of china ] ( http://www.amazon.co.uk/wild-swans-three-daughters-china/dp/0007463405/ref=sr_1_1?ie=utf8&amp;qid=1372464803&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=wild+swans ) is a biography spanning three generations of women in 20th century china , and i picked it up after listening to an audio book based in 19th century china to learn more . 
  it 's horrifying and fascinating all at once and i really quite love it . 
  i 've actually been meaning to read it for years . 
  [ the queen 's agent : francis walsingham at the court of elizabeth i ] ( http://www.amazon.co.uk/queens-agent-francis-walsingham-elizabeth/dp/057121827x/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=utf8&amp;qid=1372465026&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=francis+walsingham ) is a non-fictional history book about the intelligence and spy circles francis walsingham controlled in the late 1500s at the elizabethan court . 
  i normally have at least one history book on the go at any one time and i really like this one . 
  some factual history books are a real slog but this is n't at all , it 's incredibly immersive . 
  i 'm also working my way through a beautifully illustrated hardcover version of [ the hobbit ] ( http://www.amazon.co.uk/hobbit-j-r-tolkien/dp/0007487282/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=utf8&amp;qid=1372465148&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+hobbit ) right now . 
  and just to switch over to when i 'm tired of history , i downloaded and started [ the dragon keeper : rain wild chronicles book 1 ] ( http://www.amazon.co.uk/dragon-keeper-rain-wild-chronicles/dp/0007342594/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=utf8&amp;qid=1372465310&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+dragon+keeper ) by robin hobb the other day . 
  i love hobb 's * farseer * and * tawny man * trilogies and i 've been meaning to really read her rain wilds chronicles but have n't given them much of a go . 
  hopefully this will impress me just as much as fitz and the fool did . 
  gymnastics . 
  i did it when i was younger and loved it , so now i 'm 28 i figured i 'd try finding a class again . 
  i 'm never going to be * good * , but i absolutely love the sport and everything it involves . 
  i never come out of a gymnastics session feeling bad about myself , and i always want to go back into the gym and keep learning more . 
  also , history . 
  i just figured it out when i wanted to read a non-fictional history book and visit historic houses or a castle just for fun on the weekends . 
  i 'm now doing a second degree in it and aiming to go on and teach it eventually , just to give everyone else the love for history that i feel . 
  it 's never ever boring to me . 
  not a us citizen , but why should n't laws change to benefit minorities and give equal rights across the board ? 
  just because you 're in the majority does n't mean you always get everything your way all the time . 
  37 but i only check on 15 of them very regularly . 
  in the uk we use red for first , blue for second , yellow for third and green for fourth . 
  i believe that 's consistent across all disciplines . 
  apart from occasional roman and civil war battles , we have [ kentwell hall ] ( http://www.kentwell.co.uk/ ) here in suffolk , england , which consistently holds period re-enactments through the year from victorian christmases to world war two days . 
  their most famous event , however , are their great annual recreation days in summer where they have around up to 250 tudor re-enactors , all in appropriate costumes living and working around the kentwell estate for three weeks between june and july each year . 
  each re-creation is set in a different year of the tudor era ( this year is 1559 ) and the actors are very much self-contained tudors , down to learning the right speech patterns , who temporarily do n't ` recognise ' the real world while they are in costume . 
  you can see tudor meals being cooked in the kitchens , candles being dipped , the nobility sitting down to dinner , archery contests , artisans and the general estate being worked as it used to be five hundred years ago . 
  as far as i 'm aware it 's one of the biggest re-enactment events in the country but i 'm happy to be corrected on that . 
  yup !, 
  yay for boob-gap , where you can feel the crumbs but ca n't get the little sods out again . 
  pretty important , i should think . 
  most students when applying can still only offer projected results for their a-levels , so unis take into account the actual grades awarded for gcse ( and as level ) as a base . 
  as brits we just do n't take anyone that seriously and do n't like people who get too ahead of themselves . 
  we like the underdogs in life . 
  for that reason , most people who come into the spotlight for whatever reason ( tv presenters , editors , politicians ) come into * plenty * of dressing downs and mockery . 
  i think for americans this can come across as abhorrence and rudeness a lot of the time , when we 're just making sure no one gets too far above their station . 
  there are only a few who seem to avoid getting too mercilessly mocked - david dimbleby , david attenborough , stephen fry , clare balding . 
  even the queen gets it in the neck more than those ones . 
  piers morgan is just so * smug * that he gets extra helpings of this , and the fact that he swanned off to america and is acting like god 's gift to hollywood because he 's got lots of famous friends does n't help his case . 
  he does still have a weekly column in the mail on sunday magazine , however , so he 's still doing plenty of uk business . 
  so do american comedies . 
  what ones are you thinking of in particular ? 
  i actually find it easiest to go straight from work to my gymnastics sessions , as i 've still got the energy of the day . 
  once i 've sat down in front of the tv i really have to persuade myself to go out again . 
  i think of the skills i want to learn ( back walkover , a tuck half turn jump on the beam ) and how going just one more time will help me manage them . 
  i know i 've lost inches so far and i want to keep that up . 
  it 's just something that i do on that day . 
  tuesday is gymnastics day . 
  friday is gymnastics day . 
  having it as part of a routine helps . 
  it 's fun !, 
  if i go , i 'll have fun , and i know that when i do go , i 'll have fun . 
  if everything else fails , i know full well there will be about a dozen fit guys there doing awesome skills with their shirts off , and i want to go ogle them . 
  trading standards , probably . 
  roast dinner with yorkshire puddings , parsnips , carrots , cauliflower cheese and roast potatoes . 
  that 's sunday right there . 
  apple crumble or apricot crumble . 
  slathered with double cream . 
  omfg . 
  eton mess . 
  my * favourite * summer dessert . 
  a fresh , steaming cup of tea to top it all off . 
  or a glass of pimms , topped with ice and plenty of fruit . 
  oh god no , he 's nowhere in the same league as stephen fry . 
  that 's what i meant , that we mock pretty much everyone except a select few and piers ( deservedly ) gets the worst of it . 
  and they 're all * amazing * . 
  we tend to like spice quite a lot and we 're a country quite big on seafood ( i 'm thinking of gumbo and jambalaya ? 
  ) , so pretty well i should think . 
  the exception is possibly sweet tea , which liptons does occasionally try and sell over here , and grits . 
  i 've never understood exactly what grits * are * to be honest , so i could be wrong on that , but just the name sounds awful . 
  it 's not that you wo n't be * able * to study , but anything less than an a-c in the core subjects will put you at a disadvantage for the universities that will make you an offer . 
  joined in january from the lj community ask me anything where it got mentioned fairly frequently . 
  i did some exploration , liked what i saw and joined . 
  i love how busy reddit is most of all . 
  england - the pub culture . 
  we 're an incredibly sociable bunch really , and i do like that there 's a culture of families taking children to pubs and restaurants to sit down and eat together , or if you want to catch up with someone you just go down the pub for a chat . 
  it 's really nice and laid back . 
  also , the history . 
  we trip over amazing history all the time without even realising it . 
  i have roman walls circling my town , a roman temple , a norman castle , medieval buildings , civil war gunshot marks in buildings and victorian churches all in just a couple of square miles . 
  well i say that even as someone who does n't drink that much . 
  i 'll have maybe one rose wine spritzer the whole night . 
  i still prefer a pub to a cafe as someone to go and meet my friends and have a catch up . 
  i 've teched one of his shows for a month or more before . 
  he 's definitely the latter , plus being an arrogant thankless git thrown into the mix . 
  head on down to southbank to see the udderbelly and london wonderground before the cow heads back up to edinburgh for the fringe . 
  they 've got some great shows going on . 
   people can surprise you if you give them a chance , feelings have to grow and if you expect sparks from the first instant you might be disappointed more often than not . 
  eh , i 'd not always agree with that . 
  there * has * to be sparks or chemistry for me , and i 've never had a single experience yet where feelings have developed over a period of time , whether for potential boyfriends or just from friends going to love interests . 
  i 've given guys a chance of three or four dates on the `` feelings will grow ! '', 
  basis and they just have n't .
