  you 're thinking that women dress to please other people . 
  we do n't . 
  we dress to please ourselves , and what men think is secondary . 
  you knew she smoked when you agreed to go out with her . 
  you ca n't just decide now that you want her to change . 
  you can decide that you do n't want to date a smoker and break up with her , though . 
  we would n't date . 
  i do n't want to go out with anyone who is religious , and a healthy sex life is important to me . 
  we 'd be really incompatible . 
  i 'm sure plenty of other girls would n't mind , though . 
  ladder goat !, 
  i can honestly never stop laughing when i watch that video . 
  tell him `` no , you can not sleep with other girls '' , and if he decides that he 's going to do it anyway , then you dump him . 
  i have one brother who is two years younger than me . 
  we get along pretty well , but we 're completely different people in almost every sense of the world . 
  i really like that idea !, 
  just getting changed sounds so simple , but i 'm not surprised that it works . 
  long , straight bob with a grown out fringe , just hitting my shoulders . 
  it 's the longest it 's been in years and i really love it !, 
  aiming for hair a la [ scarlett johansson in winter soldier ] ( http://www.comicbookbrain.com/_imagery/2014-07-00/scarlett-johansson-black-widow-captain-america.jpg ) eventually . 
  i 'm not far off !, 
  once a month ? 
  i sleep alone . 
  it defines me precisely as much as whether i 've had toast or cornflakes for breakfast that morning . 
  the middle navy one is nicest . 
  you prefer women who are more forward . 
  that 's fair enough . 
  no need to make a big song and dance about it . 
  britney spears `` toxic '' is the definitive last year of sixth form for me . 
  last resort !, 
  god , i used to love that song so much . 
  good times . 
  [ jerusalem ] ( https://youtu.be/041nxaan714 ) and [ rule britannia ] ( https://youtu.be/y2ila3h_u60 ) from last night of the proms . 
  very stirring !, 
  save up plenty of money before you go . 
  buy an oyster card for the tube . 
  london is full of americans and other tourists , you 're not going to stand out in the slightest . 
  have fun !, 
  yes !, 
  the bit where natasha swings off the causeway bridge and then runs underneath it to avoid the winter soldier always feels way too long !, 
  it feels like the bridge is massive for the amount of time we see her sprinting . 
  you know what , i 've seen ws a dozen times and never once though about how sam suddenly has his wings , but that 's a really good point !, 
  nah , you just empty it out when it 's fill , rinse briefly under a tap and then reinsert . 
  you can do a full wash/boil once you 've finished bleeding . 
  i got my moon cup from boots and it 's been great . 
  i love film scores and so many of them have really weighty emotions behind them . 
  my particular favourites are [ rue 's farewell ] ( https://youtu.be/c55ojwjkn8i ) from the hunger games movie - so simple and beautiful - and [ hope ( xavier 's theme ) ] ( https://youtu.be/mh4uuwitmgy ) from x-men : days of future past . 
  so take a holiday to a big city somewhere !, 
  go travel . 
  you 'll find loads of people like you when you stretch your horizons a bit more . 
  you know what , when you have boobs sometimes you physically can not help showing cleavage . 
  it is the way clothes are cut . 
  you said that she was ` spilling out ' when she was leaning forward , so clearly it was appropriate when she was standing upright and not having to lean over desks . 
  tough shit . 
  i am not going to spend my entire life in an office wearing polo necks because i wear g cups . 
  i wear a light infinity scarf for really low cut dresses ( like today ) , but otherwise i will wear cuts of necks that suit my figure ( like v-necks and scoops necks ) , and i just have to put up with it when i do things like lean over desks . 
  it is not my fault that i have g cup boobs . 
  it * is * your fault that you apparently believe that your staring is not the inappropriate part . 
  i assumed you meant that the shirt had a false double lining , not that there was a cut out . 
  was the shirt appropriate when she was standing upright ? 
  if you have boobs , * any * shirt that is appropriate in a standing position immeditely becomes inappropriate when you 're leaning over . 
  you ca n't control where gravity sends them . 
  anyway , that style of top is all over the place at the moment ( i believe it 's called a sweetheart neckline ? ), 
  and i expect she did n't realise , or just did n't care , that leaning over would expose them more . 
  / r/england is pretty dead ( or inhabited by americans ) , / r/askuk is better for travel info . 
  yeah exactly . 
  `` oh , i do n't * mind * her showing boobs , it was quite nice really , but is it appropriate to show boobs ? 
  should she be shopping with boob-showing in mind ? 
  why did she wear that top to show her boobs ( which were quite nice , by the way , she can do that more often ) . 
  should a working adult be doing that ? '', 
  like , mixed messages much ? 
  cure cancer . 
  ending war would n't end the damaging causes of war like extremist religion , territorial disputes or racial/ethnic cleansing . 
  plus , military funding has also given us a huge amount of benefits like pencillin and the internet . 
  i 'd love love love to see just one proper winter soldier photo , but i 'm happy to be surprised by everything else . 
  i always like the creation/discovery montage scenes in films , like when tony stark builds the mark 2 iron man suit in his workshop , or when the team are figuring out their master plan in inception . 
  the bit where eames pushes arthur over in the deck chair is always my favourite . 
  oooh i love that scene !, 
  the ominous music is great , especially when they find toodles muttering about hook in a corner . 
  very creepy !, 
  [ kate middleton ] ( http://www.hellomagazine.com/imagenes/royalty/2014090920882/kate-middleton-pregnant-three-children/0-110-935/kate1--a.jpg ) . 
  how is her hair always so fucking gorgeous ? 
  i * love * mona lisa smile !, 
  such a wonderful film . 
  i always love the bit right before julia roberts is taken into the secret club , too . 
  `` you must swear never to reveal what you see , hear or smell in this room . '', 
  `` smell ?! '', 
  the film peaked a third of the way through ? 
  that 's kind of harsh . 
  i mean , green * is * a suspicious colour . 
  just ask your local panto villain . 
  wow , super harsh . 
  but hey , i guess if you were looking for realism in a comic book film you were bound to be disappointed . 
  that we 're weak . 
  i 'm a pretty strong girl , i like carrying my own boxes/suitcases/heavy thing around , and i like saying `` oh no , i 've got this '' if someone asks to take it from me . 
  ask questions !, 
  if you 're not sure , ask !, 
  you get so much leeway for being the new kid which you do n't get once you 're settled in . 
  i do bar work and i 'm always always happy to give the new staff directions or say `` do you know how to do this ? 
  i 'll show you . '',
