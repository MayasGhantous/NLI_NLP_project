  yes , i 'm raising that concern . 
  that 's something very important that i would like to see . 
  we 've got ant-man on natasha 's cleavage and her bum . 
  now i would like some attractive ` ant-man on male cast ' posters . 
  ant-man on hawkeye 's bicep while at full draw , perhaps . 
  would n't you ? 
  it 's admiration of the human body , after all , which you said you are all for . 
  i thought he was only going to have a small part anyway , as a sort of taster introduction before his big new solo movie ? 
  civil war is packed as it is , i do n't think spidey was ever going to get more than maybe a scene or two . 
  ` ship ' is short for ` relationship ' , and it 's just lots of imaginary scenarios where two characters end up together . 
  it 's normally shown by a forward slash , so tony stark/pepper potts , or it might have the names put together , like pepperony . 
  a large number of ships are gay ones called ` slash ' , like steve rogers/bucky barnes or tony/steve . 
  if you 've got a favourite ship you might call it your otp - one true pairing . 
  ships are big things in fandom , and you 'll get a lot of silly friendly rivalries , like whether natasha should be shipped with bucky , clint or bruce , or whether the best ship is tony/pepper or tony/steve . 
  silly stuff like that . 
  why ? 
  as a woman who has never cheated on anyone in her life , tell me exactly why i should spend an entire relationship ` proving ' myself to you , when * you * are the one with the issues , not me ? 
  how would someone even show you this evidence of proof ? 
  it 's such an arbitrary thing , and it 's a game that no woman is ever going to win , because you flat out say that you do n't trust any of us . 
  i have no idea what that reply was even talking about . 
  if you want to meet musicians , go to more concerts . 
  you specifically said you want to find woman who can prove herself trustworthy , i asked how you can possibly prove that and you 've come back saying `` you do n't need to prove anything , you need to * embody * it . '', 
  because that 's so much clearer , obviously . 
  you 're never going to find what you 're looking for , because the problem here is * you * , not the women you 're dating . 
  and you wonder why you 're single ... 
  i do like that i disagreed with him so he 's resorted to calling me bitchy and underhanded , but a * guy * who he 's arguing with gets a cheery ` brodin be with you ' . 
  but hey !, 
  he 's got a job !, 
  and a car !, 
  and hobbies !, 
  clearly we ladies have no idea what we 're missing out on here . 
  you can book tickets in advance for most major cinemas no matter where you live . 
  you get to pick your seats too . 
  i book online for my local odeon all the time . 
  edit : just read that you do n't want a busy cinema at all . 
  yes , the first saturday night showings of a brand new film like jurassic park is going to be busy no matter where you go . 
  we 're not looking for the ` perfect ' conversation . 
  it 's not one strike and you 're out . 
  if you mess up what you 're trying to say , or stumble , or say the wrong thing , laugh it off !, 
  just try and enjoy the conversation instead of worrying the whole time - if you 're having fun and talking about stuff that you 're passionate about , or asking her about things that she 's passionate about , then you 'll both have a great time . 
  maybe a slightly out there suggestion , but look on youtube for episodes of the show how to look good naked by gok wan . 
  he 's a stylist here in the uk who ran a show for a few years all about teaching women how to dress and what would suit them , but in a really friendly and approachable way . 
  he would take on a woman like you , who felt frumpy , had no idea how to dress but also had no idea where to start , and he would show them step by step what would suit their body shape , what colours to look for or not to look for - everything from the ground up , basically . 
  it may help you to get some starting ideas about the shapes of clothes to look out for in shops , or what might suit you , and from there you can do a little bit of experimenting . 
  center parcs ? 
  not the most rural of course , but the lodges are comfy and you get a lot of wildlife wandering about . 
  i think there 's a more naturey version called forest lodges or something ? 
  my warmest , fluffiest socks . 
  they 're the same style but slightly different colours . 
  i 'm starting teacher training this september , so i 'd like to complete that with a job at the end , ideally in a grammar or independent school . 
  at some point i 'd like to go back to uni and get a masters in classics , so i could teach latin and classics as well as history . 
  i 'd also like to try emigrating eventually and teach in another country - maybe australia , new zealand or canada . 
  somewhere a little bit different for a while . 
  but i 'd also really like a family too , so , it 's all about balance really . 
  it can be really expensive on the weekends , but you can normally bag some better deals to stay during the week . 
  i 'm not exactly sure how writing a scene made you feel ` manly ' . 
  i 've never felt like that when i 've written something , but i * do * feel nervous if i ever show off my writing or have to present anything . 
  that 's got nothing to do with being a man or woman , though . 
  find something really simple and have a go !, 
  there 's a couple of great askreddit threads with people talking about simple but impressive meals actually : [ this one ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/37refg/what_seemingly_impressive_meal_is_actually_really/ ) is the most recent and [ this one ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/1u6kg2/what_are_some_meals_that_are_simple_to_make_but/ ) from a year ago has a few more complex ideas , but they all sound * delicious * . 
  just to add , i 'm really not one for cooking at * all * - i 'm great at cakes but main meals evade me , and i just found a couple of recipes i really liked the sound of in a magazine , threw some stuff together and had a go . 
  this [ thai green curry with asparagus and salmon ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/you/article-3070625/top-crops-thai-style-curry-asparagus-salmon.html ) sounds complex , but it actually involves throwing a bunch of stuff in a wok , then adding water and boiling until it thickens . 
  literally that simple and it was * amazing * . 
  this [ guardian article ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/jun/11/nobel-laureate-sir-tim-hunt-resigns-trouble-with-girls-comments ) has a more thorough description of what happened . 
  it was a stupid comment , we can all agree that , but the even * more * ridiculous thing about it was that he was addressing a women 's lunch at the world conference of science journalists . 
  like , pick your audience , mate . 
  it was inappropriate , he used it as a platform , he represented ucl badly and i 'm not surprised he ended up being fired . 
  if you want unpaid , then just write to the companies that you 're interested in and request an internship . 
  that 's how i set up unpaid pr work when i was thinking of changing careers , and i ended up doing a month at a pretty good company . 
  i 've always tended to feel like the men i know irl * always * have girlfriends or go from one relationship to another very quickly , and i have always kind of felt like women are more okay about singledom . 
  i do know a good few single men who tick along quite nicely without a partner , but i feel like i know more self-sufficient single women . 
  i think maybe it 's linked to the emotional relationships we have with people ? 
  as women , we 've generally got a better emotional support network in friends where we can whinge and moan about everything , whereas men do n't always have that , and find emotional support in relationships . 
  i turned thirty this year and have just finished my second degree through distance learning with the [ open university ] ( http://www.open.ac.uk ) . 
  i 've found this year that i 'm a thousand percent more motivated and worked so much harder , just because it was something i really * wanted * . 
  being a little bit older makes all the difference in getting an education , as far as i 'm concerned . 
  i loved my degree this time around . 
  because i do n't always feel like smiling ? 
  mostly straight with room to be flexible . 
  i 'm a massive fan of aspalls , and their [ harry sparrow cider ] ( http://www.aspall.co.uk/products/cyders/harry-sparrow ) is much lighter than their others , but everything they do is really tasty . 
  i thought it tasted more like something you 'd have in the garden on a hot day . 
  facebook . 
  i 'm happy ( ish ) with my life , but if i sit on there for too long i feel like i 've failed at pretty much everything . 
  i do n't think about it . 
  if a woman does n't feel prepared to have a baby for whatever reason , abortion is absolutely fine by me . 
  i 'm not asexual , so no . 
  that would be the worst case scenario for me . 
  there 's this completely [ heartbreaking portrait of bucky barnes ] ( http://annetheviking.tumblr.com/post/83095108906/trying-to-make-a-move-just-to-stay-in-the-game ) that i love ; the artist titles it `` bucky barnes - after the fall , before the arm - a frazzled brain , trying to hang on to his last few memories before hydra erases them . '', 
  [ star lord by wisesnail ] ( http://society6.com/product/star-lord-tor_print#1=45 ) is amazing . 
  i love this [ tony stark/iron man schematic ] ( http://40.media.tumblr.com/3b656f99778ba14db1f70a970c5d8ca2/tumblr_np0mmufikk1r11yglo1_r1_1280.jpg ) fanart - it 's such a clever idea . 
  oooh and there 's this gorgeous [ hawkeye in the snow ] ( http://41.media.tumblr.com/18b7825bc4a723d5261dbaef1abe0279/tumblr_mnomrhmcwk1rroanco1_1280.jpg ) portrait by http://when-it-rains-it-snows.tumblr.com that is divine . 
  i have to say , i love great fanart . 
  i have a whole lot of [ fanart tagged posts ] ( http://red-room-romanoff.tumblr.com/tagged/fanart ) on tumblr that are great just to scroll through every so often . 
  teenage drinking is more than acceptable here in the uk . 
  my parents encouraged me to try wine with dinner from about age 12 and it 's pretty common for teenagers to try to get served at a pub even if they 're underage . 
  my brother got barred for two weeks from his favourite pub on his 18th birthday because he 'd already been drinking there for two years !, 
  drinking is just a really sociable activity , and i just always liked having a mixer with my friends . 
  i do n't drink very much at all now , maybe one glass of wine or half a cider once a week , but it 's an enjoyable thing to do . 
   then i thought that an unprovoked attack warrants a more than proportional response, 
  it does n't .
