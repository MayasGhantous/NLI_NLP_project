  i think it just varies from person to person . 
  so agree with you . 
  i would * love * for my life to be a disney film where i just happen to bump into a handsome man and we fall sweepingly in love and conquer the world with our passion . 
  one of my best friends has always had this idea of finding her perfect man by being in a library , they bump into each other and spill books , he gets down to help pick them up and gazes deeply into her eyes ... 
  except it 's all about dragging yourself through dating sites ( which are fucking hard work , by the way ) , going on endless dinners to see if you match up , then figuring out on date three that you do n't * actually * like them that much but feel bad about it because they obviously like you , letting them down , going back on the site , trawling through more emails , while all the while seeing if your cute coworker is available to talk to , or that fit guy at your hobby/club is actually available etc etc ad nauseum until you get sick of dating and give yourself over to being a crazy cat/dog/budgie lady instead . 
  ` beautiful and simple ' is the * last * thing that comes to mind . 
  `` when i was with my ex ... '', 
  i 'm british and went to a small drama school that was particularly collaborative with each course . 
  we had a very high f/m ratio ( i think it was something like 1 guy to every 12 women in every course except the actors where they were 50/50 ) and everyone was fine with it . 
  it hardly mattered . 
  my style generally falls under the ` smart casual ' category , i guess . 
  i spend a lot of time in skinny jeans , calf-high boots and layered tops , probably with a gilet thrown over the top and a scarf . 
  i love fitted clothes best and i 'm getting more country-chic as i go . 
  favourite shops : barbour , h&m , monsoon , urban outfitters , zara , warehouse , all saints , tescos , fat face . 
  i actually wish i could be more upper class british country chic . 
  i just admire the way all those girls look so put together , even when they 're just in jodhpurs or leggings , polo shirts and a gilet with their hair thrown up . 
  it 's so stylish and i * envy * it like whoah . 
  funny story : i used to work backstage in theatre , and during one evening performance of one long-running show we had a lady in the front row did exactly that ; whipped out her boob to feed her baby , right in the middle of a big song and dance number . 
  i * know * the actors were trying their best not to stare , since she was about two metres away from them , but that was all they were talking about as soon as they came off stage . 
  i remember the guy who was my first kiss ( at 13 ) and often wonder how he is and what he 's doing . 
  i 've tried to look him up through a mutual friend 's facebook before but not had any luck . 
  wait , i thought the army 48 hour deadline was in egypt , not turkey ? 
  there 's a word for that ; naivety . 
  what makes your ` love ' so different for the ` love ' she has for this boyfriend who she refuses to leave despite repeatedly cheating on him ? 
  you 're obviously not going to walk away from this , so just screw yourself all over and tell the boyfriend . 
  at least he wo n't be in the dark about his so-called loving girlfriend any more . 
   i do n't care whether you were an alcoholic , or a drug addict or whatever else . 
  you will loose my trust after you betray me , not before . 
  look , seriously , i admire your romanticism and rose-tinted spectacles about all of this , but saying that is like saying `` i 'm going to stand on the edge of this blustery cliff with my back to the wind and my eyes closed and everything will be * fine * . '', 
  right up until the point where they push you off , of course . 
  there is no scenario - ** no scenario ** - where any of this ends happily for any of you . 
  you really are sticking your fingers in your ears , closing your eyes and singing incredibly loudly if you think it ends up otherwise . 
  either that , or you are a masochist just waiting for some horrible heartbreak that you * know * is coming . 
  she has * given * you a reason not to trust her - as soon as her boyfriend left the country and was out of sight out of mind , she fell into the bed of the next nearest guy . 
  why should she change anything ? 
  it 's obviously working pretty damn well for her right now . 
  covering letters should be set out formally . 
  they should cover the following , one point to each paragraph :, 
  1 ) why you 're writing, 
  2 ) why you 're writing to * that company * and what interests you about the job . 
  personalise it specifically to them . 
  3 ) what skills you bring to the company and anything interesting you 'd like to expand on further from your cv . 
  4 ) the best time and way to contact you . 
  keep it short , specific and interesting and make sure you address it to a * person * , never a ` to whom it may concern ' . 
  that 's part of the debate . 
  there are oil fields in the north sea that scotland claims would be theirs if they went independent and that would give them enough money from exporting to survive . 
  westminster contests that and are pretty adamant that scotland should n't be going anywhere . 
  unfortunately the pro-union pr party seems to be pretty far behind the pro-independent pr machine . 
  as an english lady who went to uni in scotland , i think it 'll end up being a pretty close run thing . 
  oh my god . 
  can i just say , as someone who wants to become a secondary school teacher in the next five years , i * hate * michael gove . 
  he is an * appalling * minister , and i 'm almost prepared to vote labour in the next election just to get rid of him . 
  the other thing i found odd about american adverts is how they promise you it 'll fix things instantly . 
  like , five minutes later you 'll be cured after taking this wonder drug . 
  british ads are more like `` eh , you 'll get there eventually . '', 
  it 's quite weird . 
  when were you here ? 
  the boris bike scheme means you see a lot more cyclists around , although i 'll freely admit only cambridge or oxford could really match dutch cycling levels . 
  i want them to get in to get rid of gove and osbourne and to start pumping some money into the economy instead of cutting it all out , but i also do n't want them to get in because ed miliband looks like he 's straight out of secondary school , and labour 's insistence on nannying everything drives me nuts . 
  it 's a hard thing to call !, 
   why do you think there is no scenario where this would end well ? 
  let 's play this out . 
  scenario 1 : boyfriend comes home , never finds out about you and her . 
  she stays with him and cuts you out of her life . 
  you end up miserable and ranting to reddit about how much you love her and can never have her . 
  scenario 2 : boyfriend comes home and you carry on with this pseudo second relationship because you 're ` so in love ' . 
  boyfriend finds out ( by the way , he * will * find out ) , goes nuts and dumps her . 
  girl is broken hearted because the boy she 's apparently been in love with for two years now wants nothing to do with her . 
  even if she * does * come running to you , you 've now got yourself a girl full of baggage who 's not over her ex to deal with . 
  also , even if she does come running to you apparently totally totally cool with being dumped , you have a sociopathic emotionless cheater to deal with . 
  scenario 3 : boyfriend comes home , girl confesses everything and he forgives her . 
  they stay together and you lose out . 
  scenario 4 : boyfriend comes home , girl confesses everything and he breaks up with her . 
  refer to end of scenario 2 for the result of that one . 
  wackily unlikely scenario 5 : boyfriend comes home , girl confesses everything and boyfriend offers up open relationship . 
  you have weirdly unhealthy relationship that started on a total misplace of trust and you * still * do n't get her all to yourself . 
  scenario 6 : boyfriend comes home , girl confesses everything and he breaks up with her . 
  she * does n't * come running to your arms because she 's still in love with boyfriend and so you do n't end up with the girl of your dreams . 
  you end up miserable and ranting to reddit about how much you love her and can never have her . 
  like i said . 
  there 's no scenario where this ends well . 
  public breastfeeding is fine by me . 
  there was a lady eating at the pub i work in last weekend who was breastfeeding her baby at the table and but had him covered over by a soft grey cardigan cape . 
  i would rather she had her baby ate where she ate rather than taking him to eat in a bathroom designed for weeing and pooing in . 
   every time i follow advice from outside sources it turns out badly , and he made that clear to me . 
  i could see why he would tell you that - if he does n't want you talking to your friends he certainly wo n't want strangers giving you advice on breaking up with him . 
  that 's the control talking through him , grinding down your confidence by saying you make bad decisions without his input . 
  have some faith in yourself . 
  your gut feelings are * right * . 
  his are * wrong * . 
  you do make good decisions and you can get good advice from other people . 
  so even if scenario 7 * did * happen , you would still want to be with someone who has been professing so much love for the last six months that she is prepared to put her apparently all new all wonderful love on the line - except that actually she totally does n't * actually * love the first boyfriend anymore because reasons , so here we go with the guy who filled in the time when her boyfriend was away . 
  by the way , i 'm not the asshole . 
  you 're technically the asshole for completely forgetting that there is a second guy out there who is in love with the girl you 're in love with . 
  and he got there first . 
  listen . 
  you are * twenty years old * . 
  you are not going to be alone forever and ever and ever amen and this girl is not the only girl in the whole wide world for you . 
  you have only known her ** six months ** . 
  what you * are * going to be if you break it off with this girl is free to find someone who can actually give you her undivided attention and act like an adult without deliberately decieving someone she swears she 's in love with .
