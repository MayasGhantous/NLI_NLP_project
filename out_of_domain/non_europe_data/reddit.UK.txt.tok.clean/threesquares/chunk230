  it 's totally up to you , but if you like that area and it really genuinely interests you as a career , then i would n't jack it in because of other people 's opinions . 
  i did my first degree in theatre production , and it was so vocational and so well connected that i had a full time industry job before i 'd finished my final year . 
  the employment contacts made it all worthwhile , even for an arts degree . 
  people are always going to bash media and arts degrees . 
  they 're seen as the ` easy ' option by people who do n't know what the industry is like , and to be fair , it 's a * very * difficult world to make your way in . 
  i did pretty constant theatre work for six years before i burned out on ridiculous hours and lack of reliable income . 
  i loved it , but it just was n't sustainable for me . 
  if you want this , you really just have to develop a thick skin , put your head down and work as much as you can . 
  use the contacts that the uni gives you , take full advantage of your year in industry and network , network , network . 
  if you want it , you will get it . 
  best of luck . 
  i was at a dog show on saturday and they played the national anthem first thing . 
  everyone just stood , looked a bit awkward and then carried on as usual when it was done . 
  ugh , that sounds pretty awful !, 
  i would take the lead , quite honestly . 
  i like to break away from them , and go back in slowly for a gentle kiss with mouths closed - i hate french kisses , personally . 
  if things get tongue-y again , i 'll just pull back again , keep it really light and keep doing that until they get the hint . 
  practice makes perfect , after all !, 
  2007 kia carens . 
  i like it !, 
  it 's ridiculously comfortable to drive and the cabin is reaaallly light and airy . 
  i can easily do three or four hour trips without any trouble , and it has a surprisingly good turning circle , which is handy for parking . 
  acceleration is maybe a little slow , but i do n't mind , and because it was a kia i could get a used one with a way better mileage than the other fords/vws/peugeots in my price range . 
  honestly , i bought it to transport my english setter back and forth to the office every day and to drive him to shows , and he 's got tonnes of room in the boot to lie down and move around . 
  downsides is that it 's definitely not very good on the mileage , and because it 's korean it has a pedal brake instead of a handbrake , and a weird little lever-release thing underneath the dashboard . 
  the indicators/windscreen washers are also switched around which drives me * nuts * when i 'm borrowing another car for a day as i 'm forever flicking the wipers on when i want to turn left . 
  i can make most styles of dresses look amazing just by virtue of having soft fleshballs to fill them with . 
  also , they 're fun to play with . 
  because ` i 'm in a loveless marriage , we only married for the money/because we had to , i 'll be divorcing them as soon as possible '' is the * oldest * story in the book , and let me tell you , it never works out the way that the mistress/bit on the side wants . 
  op , he is forty six years old . 
  if he was ever going to leave his wife for his lover , he would have done it already . 
  ` my father is a homophobe ' is n't honestly much of a reason to stay married when you 're middle aged , have your own house and your own high independent salary . 
  dollars to donuts , he 's not going to want to be ` insensitive ' to his wife for a long , long time . 
  i have a scar right under my left nipple that looks like it could have been from an implant . 
  i actually had a lump removed when i was sixteen , rather than anything being put in . 
  [ tom hiddleston at wimbledon ] ( http://cache4.asset-cache.net/gc/479915466-tom-hiddleston-attends-day-nine-of-the-gettyimages.jpg?v=1&amp;c=iwsasset&amp;k=2&amp;d=x7wjla88cweo9hktrlanxkk1ffz9vvtj5rp2izcpv73tquuoc4drlzrlxjrmjw77lqnzghp5ow4qub3qhqoflw%3d%3d ) is a good example for me . 
  he just looks * so * suave and cool . 
  tom hiddleston as loki , chris evans as cap , and rdj , as no one can tell anymore where he finishes and tony stark begins . 
  massive kudos to pretty much all of the daredevil cast , too , especially vincent d'onofrio , and i really like scarlett johansson when she gets to act in the quieter moments . 
  camps just are n't a thing where i live , so i signed up to be a camp counsellor with camp america when i was 18 , fully expecting it to be full of bored kids who were forced to go . 
  i could n't believe how much they all loved it and how much they all looked forward to going !, 
  it was such a fun summer , and i got to teach sailing out on a huge lake in pennsylvania and learn to jet-ski , and hang out with all of these international counsellors , which was amazing . 
  my favourite memory was that it was a jewish camp , so of course there was n't any bacon . 
  so bacon just became a * thing * with all of us counsellors - we would talk about how much we wanted some and how much we missed it . 
  one of the other counsellors had her 21st that summer , so a bunch of us took the night off , stayed in a hotel a few miles away and drank * loads * . 
  we all went to this restaurant the next morning for breakfast and asked for a big plate of bacon to satisfy our cravings . 
  honest to god , i have never ever seen such a huge plate of bacon rind put on our table . 
  it was the best thing * ever * . 
  i do n't think this makes you look pathetic in the slightest . 
  i think it makes * him * look pathetic and insecure . 
  he abandoned a stable , secure , long-term relationship for what ? 
  a fling with one of * your friends * who he ca n't even settle down with . 
  i think this makes you seem very brave , and it makes him seem like a little child who ca n't deal with going into the adult world . 
  let yourself grieve and give yourself time to heal . 
  you 'll be okay . 
  to an extent , as the vagina is self cleaning and periods tend to turn up announced , we 're kind of used to a little dash of wetness going on all the time . 
  a bit extra from arousal is more likely to get me worrying about whether auntie flo has arrived and caught me unawares . 
  i 've just finished a degree part-time ( i got my results yesterday and got a 2:1 !, 
  ) , so academic work has taken up most of my time for the last few years . 
  now i 'm more free , i spend it reading , doing dog shows with my english setter , watching films , watching netflix , working part time , seeing friends , going to national trust places . 
  i think about things i 've read , shows i 've seen and what i want in the future . 
  i have loads of close friends and acquaintances who i love , and a really supportive family . 
  my life is very fulfulling , and it 's about to be an even bigger adventure from september when i start teacher training , which i 've achieved all by myself . 
  i fill my life doing all of the things that people usually do , i just do n't have a lot of sex or cuddling alongside it . 
  it works really well for me . 
  see , i always kind of read that scene as natasha * does * know , she 's just needling steve in a weird is-she-why-you 're - still-single kind of way . 
  or even if she does n't know immediately , i think she clicks pretty quickly when steve does n't answer . 
  `` where does the pink panther live ? '', 
  said every single time we passed it on the train . 
  thanks , mum . 
  oh very good :d, 
  very credible . 
  we have primary sources from contemporaries detailing james ' affection for men , in particular the duke of buckingham , george villiers , also known as ` steenie ' , and we also have letters surviving from james himself that were written to villiers . 
  it seems as though james had a couple of court favourites , the other being robert carr , though the oxford dictionary of national biography is a little cautious about pinning down the exact nature of their relationship . 
  quote : `` the exact nature of his personal relationship with james remains difficult to assess . 
  carr enjoyed constant and unique access to the king 's person , day and night , at whitehall and at the hunt . 
  the king , it was reported , would pinch carr 's cheek in public , smooth his clothes , and gaze at him adoringly , even while talking to others . 
  although historians disagree about whether the relationship was sexual the intensity of the king 's love is evident in at least one of his few surviving letters to carr . '', 
  [ odnb link ( login required ) ] ( http://www.oxforddnb.com.libezproxy.open.ac.uk/view/article/4754?docpos=1 ) . 
  for contemporary sources , john oglander ( knighted by james ) wrote '' [ james ] loved young men , his favourites , better than women , loving them beyond the love of men to women . 
  i never yet saw any husband make so much or so great dalliance over his beautiful spouse as i have seen king james make over his favourites , especially the duke of buckingham . '', 
  another source from one bishop geoffrey goodman also comments on how little james ` converses ' ( i.e. 
  ; sleeps with ) his wife anne , and there is a reasonable amount of moral judgement from other contemporaries on james ' actions . 
  fischlin and fortier ( [ royal subjects , essays on the writings of james vi and v ] ( https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-cf_upxm84wc&amp;pg=pa363&amp;lpg=pa363&amp;dq=steenie+love+letters&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=te_wztllqv&amp;sig=xrxew_vhkdc7fcihdtamws7j9hy&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=roujver3d-pw7abnhkzaaw&amp;ved=0cdgq6aewba#v=onepage&amp;q=steenie%20love%20letters&amp;f=false ) , 2002 , p. 349 ) suggest there was an ` unholy trio determined to castigate james and his court on moral grounds whilst offering titillating examples ' . 
  fischlin and fortier also go on to suggest that later victorian writers who wrote about james built on this judgement , particularly when the letters between james and his favourites were first originally published . 
  a google book of the letters can be found [ here ] ( https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=2gntmzafem4c&amp;pg=pa147&amp;lpg=pa147&amp;dq=king+james+letters&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=cfwzsgdkgv&amp;sig=gpmciokzxubprgfqdrm_pxluffq&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=b5sjvywedsg3swgw4reodg&amp;ved=0ceoq6aewbdgk#v=onepage&amp;q=king%20james%20letters&amp;f=false ) and are incredibly affectionate . 
  in december 1623 james writes to villiers '' [ ... ] and that we may make at this christmas a new marriage ever to be kept hereafter : for , god so love me , as i desire only to live in this world for your sake , and that i had rather lived banished in any part of the earth with you than live a sorrowful widow 's life without you . 
  and so god bless you , my dear sweet child and wife , and grant that you may ever be a comfort to your dear dad and husband . '', 
  i think if you 're looking for the usual understand of ` prefer the company of young men [ plural ] ' , as in had acres of lovers , you might be a little disappointed . 
  i would argue that james was at the very least bisexual ( i 'm not certain on the closeness of his full relationship with anne ) , but had his particular favourite courtiers that he would have very intense relationships with ; carr being one and villiers being another . 
  he 's certainly a very interesting monarch to look in to when you get digging through his letters and sources from the time . 
  a four , i guess ? 
  i try not to run my mouth off , and i 'll make a depreciating comment if someone makes a politically incorrect joke or comment , though as that person is usually my dad there 's not a whole lot i can do . 
  i do n't actively * seek * anything though , i just watch what i say . 
  i think that 's a harder question to answer , simply because the nature of the stuart court meant that close access to the king meant power and wealth . 
  things that we as modern readers would see as evidence of attraction , like sharing a bed , was also seen as normal at the time , as / u/vertexoflife points out above . 
  i think it 's harder to draw a line between evidence of their personal attraction , and ` if the king singles you out ' , etc etc. 
  there does seem to be evidence though ( and i 'm saying it tentatively ) that james ' favourites were attracted to men themselves . 
  i 'm also going to say first that i 'll be using a lot of quotes from the oxford dictionary of national biography , which is something you need access to read , but it 's an amazing source of information . 
  the article was written by roger lockyer who appears to be well regarded in peer reviewed articles on the subject of buckingham , so i trust the summary .
