  twice . 
  health problems include hip dysplasia , but good breeders only have litters out of dogs who have been hip scored . 
  we also have a lot of trouble with their ears because of narrow ear canals and most of them need ear drops every now and again . 
  they 're not an easy dog , and are smart but * not * biddable like a lab . 
  they will get themselves in trouble if you do n't keep an eye on them and are all as stubborn as anything . 
  but other than that , i 'd never be without one . 
  they 're wonderful dogs , and gorgeous to boot . 
  i know , right ? 
  there 's an awful lot of interesting fan theories out there , but apparently this one is just non-negotiable ? 
  i do n't get it . 
  mine are all writing . 
  first was at the top of my back , between my the shoulder blades . 
  hurt to get done but healing was fine . 
  second was a word on the inside of each of my wrists . 
  inking was fine and really quick apart from the edge of my wrist bones , healing hurt like anything . 
  third was a couple of words on my ribs . 
  inking was fine but healing was awful and * really * sore . 
  it 's not stayed as intact as my back or wrists either . 
  well , i was out all day in london and then at my best friends very adult and docile birthday drinks this evening , so i guess i was !, 
  it 's been a total nightmare getting back on the trains , though . 
  as long as you are * happy * about having sex with a guy , you 're both using protection and you 're realistic about what you 're going to get out of it , it does n't matter whether the rest of the world thinks it 's wise or not . 
  lots of people lose their virginities through casual sex , and lots lose it through a relationship . 
  there 's no right or wrong way to do it as long as you 're okay with it when you come out the other side . 
  * sort * of ? 
  i feel like i 'd really like to be in a couple and share stuff with someone , and i feel like my parents would like me to have someone on my arm - but at the same time i also feel like dating is * exhausting * and i just want to hang out with my friends and go to bed . 
  i did when i was a teenager , and now i 'm an adult i 'll only date guys who actually have their shit together and are decent human beings . 
  more women in ceo , heavy industry , military and high government roles , and more men in ` caring ' professions like teaching , nursing , family care . 
  equal pay , standard maternity and paternity benefits in every country . 
  white british . 
  it 's not even going to be anything . 
  james gunn has said he just likes to referring to people and places that actually exist in the comics . 
  it 's a geeky little easter egg and that 's about it . 
  talk on the phone once or twice a week , go to visit once every couple of months . 
  we 'll text when either of us sees something funny we want to share . 
  so say he does pass on an $ 800k house to you . 
  what about your siblings ? 
  what do they get ? 
  they certainly do n't get $ 800k worth of assets , no matter * how * much your dad has saved . 
  do n't tell me there 's not going to be arguments about that arrangement , or your siblings will just go ` oh well ! ' . 
  not going to happen . 
  your dad is being sensible , and you 're not actually owed anything in someone 's will . 
  if your grandparents want to will you money , they will will you money . 
  do n't be a child and think that you deserve an entire house . 
  i do n't have an so , but when i was catcalled the other day on a main road ( a guy zoomed by in a car and shouted something about how big it was ... i do n't even know how i 'm supposed to respond to that ) i did n't even tell my housemates . 
  what was the point ? 
  i just steamed about it for a while on the rest of the walk back and then forgot about it . 
  here , have some photos of the [ kitten ] ( http://i.imgur.com/whzcjt2.jpg ) my [ housemates ] ( http://i.imgur.com/0o3rqid.jpg ) [ found ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ra9w8bb.jpg ) and brought home this week . 
  we 're not keeping her ( rented student house ) , and have put up found posters locally to find the real owner ( no luck so far ) but she 's very cute to have around !, 
  so far names have been mooted around as stinky , winnie and cheese-bum because she does the most * horrendous * stinky sloppy poos , but mostly she 's just the kitten . 
  we reckon she 's about four months old and she * loves * her cuddles . 
  who would be screwed up enough to believe that it * did n't * happen ? 
  yes , children get killed in horrible , senseless and cruel ways , is that really so hard to believe ? 
  same . 
  i really do n't feel any touch on them at all . 
  they 're pretty much the least erogenous area of my body . 
  fine . 
  i 'd ask to join in and watch too . 
  you 're doing good , op !, 
  you recognised you had a problem , tried to control that problem , realised that you * could n't * control the problem without help , and now you 're going back to where you can find support . 
  you are doing fine , i promise . 
  it 's baby steps every day . 
  we 're all behind you . 
  i guess i stopped properly partying when i was about 25/26 . 
  i did some time working on a cruise ship which was party , party , party for six months straight , and by the time i got home i was sick and tired of it . 
  i 'm 30 now and i 've not really been out clubbing or binge drinking since . 
  i 'm the oldest . 
  i 'm definitely much more independent than my younger brother . 
  he 's a home boy , is much more sociable and party-party than me , and likes things just so . 
  i like to go off under my own steam and get things done my way . 
  like others have said , i was definitely the academic ` smart ' one too . 
  do n't forget the fact that british kids get to go to the theatre and see professional shows like pantomimes from a very young age . 
  touring theatre shows and west end shows are also generally more accessible to people than i imagine they would be for more geographically sparse countries like america . 
  i really think it 's all about exposure to good home grown acting from a young age . 
  charlie cox , specifically as matt murdock ( with the glasses off ) . 
  hnnngggh . 
  i am * so excited * for david tennant in jessica jones on netflix . 
  he 's going to be a villain and it 's going to be * amazing * . 
  do n't give up , but maybe reassess why you do n't feel like the spark was there . 
  was the conversation just not up to scratch , did you feel like they were n't intelligent/funny enough for you , or maybe there was something you were doing so that neither of you really relaxed ? 
  i 've done a lot of online dating too , and have n't met a one yet , but have met several possibles/would like to try that have n't then worked out for one reason or another . 
  i 've found that with ones that have n't worked out , it 's never just been something about them , it 's also something about me that means that it never really fits . 
  food , i 'm bloody starving . 
  sebastian stan is * beautiful * . 
  i have a massive girly girl crush on him as bucky barnes * and * as tj hammond in political animals . 
  such a stunning man . 
  bear in mind that if you * do * do england-scotland and you opt for the august end of your timetable , it 's the fringe festival all august in edinburgh , which is a ) amazing b ) very , * very * expensive and c ) a nightmare to get accomodation in . 
  you can either fly up , or get the train . 
  short flights stansted - edinburgh on easyjet will be cheaper , but i personally love the train trip , especially once you get past newcastle and the rolling countryside really kicks in . 
  part of the trip is right on the coast and it 's a stunning bit of scenery . 
  no , we 've kept all our dogs entire as we show them , and they generally need to be intact for the show ring . 
  yes , and yes . 
  gymnasts are beautiful . 
  also , how did you forget [ kohei uchimura ? 
  ] ( http://www1.pictures.zimbio.com/gi/kohei+uchimura+olympics+day+1+gymnastics+artistic+g5_s6b6txhsl.jpg ) [ 2 ] ( http://data.whicdn.com/images/36618877/thumb.jpg ) . 
  he 's divine . 
  alternatively , i do think the swiss gymnast [ guilia steingruber ] ( http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/inthegym/images/c/c1/steingruber_giulia_2012_olympics.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20121201153220 ) is [ incredibly pretty ] ( http://static.a-z.ch/__ip/3xgd_qgr1ejk-ie3fpv3gxp7jqg/6c9ebe0d5115e1f26b07b86a3c69013241ccf269/remote.adjust.rotate=0&amp;remote.size.w=640&amp;remote.size.h=480&amp;local.crop.h=366&amp;local.crop.w=640&amp;local.crop.x=0&amp;local.crop.y=20,teaser-detail/giulia-steingruber-ist-die-schweizer-medaillenhoffnung-schlechthin ) . 
  my housemates eating habits . 
  i was more complaining than gossiping i suppose , but i 'll admit i was still talking about her when she was n't around . 
  that was sometime friday night . 
  aw , i love bake off !,
