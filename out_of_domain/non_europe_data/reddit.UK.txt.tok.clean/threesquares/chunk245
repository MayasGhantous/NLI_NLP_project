  mel and sue are the best part , hands down . 
  nope !, 
  i 've heard of them , mostly via american tv shows but i would have no idea how to make one or what they taste like . 
  we 'll roast marshmallows over a campfire , or maybe a banana wrapped in tinfoil , but s'mores are completely foreign to me . 
  * jessica jones * on netflix in exactly a month , * agent carter * series 2 in january , * daredevil * series 2 in april and then * captain america : civil war * in april/may . 
  it 's going to be amazing !, 
  i would double check the dress code with your hosts , as i have a feeling that dressing for english and american weddings , particularly for women , does vary . 
  our will be much more formal - if it 's summer , there are more hats , and she 'll be expected to have quite a formal dress , though not evening gown-y . 
  other than that , i 'm sure it 'll be absolutely fine . 
  i went to a very well to do american wedding once and it really was n't that different at all . 
  a ) your mum will be miserable . 
  as everyone else has said , it is stunningly unfair to just spring a pet on her . 
  b ) it is an even worse idea to give someone a pet who has only been watching cesar fucking milan , and has no actual idea how to raise and train a dog . 
  cesar milan 's methods are cruel and outdated , * especially * for pitbulls who respond best to positive , reward based training . 
  the last thing this world needs is another pitbull puppy who has been ` alpha rolled ' by an irresponsible , inexperienced owner . 
  please do n't do this . 
  i 'm doing postgraduate teacher training right now , so i ca n't tell you for definite if it 's worth it , but my course has a hundred percent employment rate , so i 'm hopeful . 
  i 'm in the uk , do i 'm doing a year 's pgce and hoping to teach secondary history . 
  i love it so far !, 
  there 's loooooads of theory and reading , and it 's a gradual build up of actual teaching time , but my tutor and support staff are all amazing . 
  i definitely made the right choice . 
  oh my god , this is so the night time doppelganger of muffin in a cafe guy . 
  brilliant . 
  i 've bounced back and forth to home since my first degree as i 've retrained and done other jobs . 
  now i 'm two hours away doing teacher training , but i 'd like to eventually end up staying somewhere in east anglia and within a couple of hours of home . 
  i miss my dog too much to go further away !, 
  i always end up asking guys out on okc and tinder . 
  i do n't know if it 's just british men in general , but i am * always * the one who takes the initiative and makes the first move to actually go on a date . 
  it 's infuriating . 
  i 'd care , only because it 's illegal in my country , so i would get out of there sharpish . 
  if we were chatting on a date and it turned out he was a country boy who liked stalking , shooting and clay pigeon stuff then i 'd probably be fine with it . 
  my cousin 's daughter was born in england to two english parents , but they all moved to sweden when she was one . 
  she 's now four and though she took a longer time than usual to start talking , she 's perfectly able to manage in both languages and operates absolutely fine in both her swedish nursery and when she 's back here in england . 
  my grown up cousin , on the other hand , is really struggling to learn the language properly !, 
  children 's brains are so elastic , and it is * so * much easier for them to pick up additional languages than it is for us as adults . 
  give him this opportunity - he 'll never be able to learn russian at any point in his life as quickly as he can do now !, 
  this subreddit and tumblr are the only places where i 've seen people asking for a trailer , and these are places specifically for dedicated fans . 
  there really is n't a big general call for it yet . 
  how do i feel today , is it cold , can i be bothered to pick out a nice top and blazer or is it a fuck-it-i-like-this-hoody-and-it 's - freezing day ? 
  if i bend forward in this dress are all the students i 'm about to face going to get an eyeful , or should i put a scarf with it ? 
  does my hair look better up or down , or is it fighting with me regardless ? 
  these jeans go better with those boots , but i have to walk forty five minutes in them up a hill , are my feet going to regret that ? 
  are these the boots that are comfy or the ones that are trying to massacre my ankles ? 
  basically . 
  i 've got oed access , and it says the following :, 
  of , relating to , or characteristic of spirits or the supernatural ; frightening , eerie .

   1854 * wide west ( san francisco * 16 july 1/5 after threading many dark passages , the guide , having unlocked all sorts of ` spooky ' looking iron doors , . . ushered us before the tomb .

  239 there was somethin' spooky 'n' soopernatural erbout er pertickler weird 'n' unaccountable erfluvium . 
  1929 t. wolfe look homeward , * angel xxvii * . 
  378 do n't start that . . spooky stuff !, 
  it makes my flesh crawl . 
  1948 * time * 1 nov. 90/2 shakespeare 's macbeth is a turbulent melodrama , full of spooky claptrap . 
  1960 r. dahl * kiss , kiss * 187 this . . is really beginning to get interesting -- a trifle spooky , too . 
  running * viii . 
  104 , i had the spooky feeling that i was dressed up in somebody else 's body . 
  1980 g. mitchell * whispering knights * ix . 
  98 ` it 's a spooky-looking place , ' said capella nervously . 
  of a person ( or animal ) : nervous ; easily frightened ; superstitious .

    1926 d. branch * cowboy & his interpreters * 12 there were times when the steer would get spooky and mad . 
  v. 354 i 'm not a spooky person but i sometimes think he was the devil . 
  ( denver posse ) * 51 range cattle . . were too ` spooky ' in those days for man-made bridges . 
  1962 g. macewan * blazing old cattle trail * i. 
  4 attendants knew that the nervous and spooky longhorns were easily alarmed and would stampede at the slightest provocation . 
  1979 * fortune * 26 mar. 
  24/2 even those spooky about coping with italian traffic can easily find the well-marked way to monza , about ten miles northeast of milan . 
  so definitely older than the 1940s , in both contexts . 
  she 's pulling facts out of her arse . 
  okay , so , i was babysitting at my cousin 's house a few weeks ago and his two little sons were watching pixels . 
  i 've not seen the whole film , just the last ten minutes , and there 's this little cgi alien sidekick character that apparently survives the extermination of all of the rest of the cgi alien bad guy characters . 
  the actors turn to each other and one says `` why did [ sidekick ] survive ? '', 
  and the other says `` i guess it 's because he 's our trophy '' * at which point * sidekick alien character suddenly and miraculously transforms into this gorgeous busty blond lady who actor a has apparently pictured as his dream girl all his life , and now has swooning desperately in his arms . 
  what . 
  the . 
  they literally * just * called sidekick a trophy , and now he 's the girl that this deadbeat video game guy just ` won ' . 
  i have no idea if that film was intended to be cleverly disguised satire , but it pissed me the fuck off . 
  that 's why i really liked * captain america : winter soldier * and * mission impossible : rogue nation * . 
  guy and girl save the world , and * part as friends * with a hug and a kiss on the cheek . 
  no ust , no snogging , just a hug and a knowing look of ` we were totally equals in this thing ' . 
  so goddamn refreshing . 
  i can be a snob sometimes and always think i can do something better than someone else . 
  i do n't always like that about myself , but i 'm okay with it . 
  you and me both , mate . 
  not only that , chris evans said he aimed to come to the first day of set as massive as possible , because you ca n't keep up the regime and go back towards your ` normal ' weight through the crazy film shoot hours . 
  i know paparazzi photos of seb stan before and after the civil war shoot show that his shoulders were * really * big and then he 's just shrunk right back since filming wrapped .

  i 've just gone back and watched the end of s2 again , and they * very carefully * frame the shots so you ca n't tell whether it 's there or not , even when she and fitz appear in the pit rubble . 
  definitely something going on with that necklace !, 
  i think it 's * incredibly * interesting that the necklace only appears again when she actually starts a conversation with will for the first time . 
  it 's blatantly obvious when she 's sewing up her leg that she does n't have it on , but the moment they actually start talking , she has it on again . 
  it 's something like ;, 
  ( jemma starts stitches , shots clearly show no necklace ), 
  j : i have more than my fair share of emergency work in the field . 
  you ? 
  w : not very sciencey . 
  j : ( looks at camping gear ) you certainly came here prepared . 
  wish i 'd had time to pack , but my trip was rather ... unexpected .
