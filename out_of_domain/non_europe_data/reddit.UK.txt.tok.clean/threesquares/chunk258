  i 'm fairly sure he was stationed in cyprus for a while too , but he died before i was born . 
  imax for sure . 
  the big chains are odeon , vue and cineworld and they 're all pretty much the same . 
  do n't go to the odeon in leicester square , because it is * stupid * expensive . 
  they should all do student discount . 
  in london , yeah . 
  sounds about right . 
  i think i pay # 12-15 for imax here in norwich . 
  [ diplomacy ] ( http://archiveofourown.org/works/2229993 ) by turtle_paced . 
  general audiences, 
  pairing : none, 
  summary : in the aftermath of the attack on xandar , there 's still the original problem of how a bunch of wanted criminals hand over a potentially universe-ending super-weapon ( that they definitely are n't terrified of ) to the authorities . 
  preferably without going back to jail . 
  as the only one of the team with skills that can unironically be called `` social , '' peter thinks this one might be on him . 
  comments : this is just a brilliant , character-perfect gotg team bonding fic . 
  it 's set in that downtime between all that mess going down with the stone and that shot you see of the stone getting put into storage by the xandarians , and it 's basically the team hanging around , recovering and waiting for the secure facility to be made secure again . 
  the character voices are just so spot on , and it 's a really great understanding of their various dynamics . 
  love it . 
  [ ai n't no party like a vanguard party ] ( http://archiveofourown.org/works/2401172 ) by fahye . 
  summary : steve and natasha have a rousing discussion about truth , honour and patriotism . 
  more or less, 
  comments : i really ca n't say too much without giving anything away , but suffice to say that my bookmark comments are ` oooh , this is so * clever * ' . 
  read this fic . 
  it 's short , it 's simple , it 's mostly one conversation in one room , and i promise that it wo n't disappoint you . 
  yeah , i 'm english too and one kiss on the cheek seems perfectly normal to me for most casual meetings with friends or family . 
  the two or three kisses bit is where it starts getting a little awkward . 
  he seems to be the most sensible one out of your conglomerate of politicians , but i doubt anyone is going to listen to an american tell us how we should deal with europe . 
  personally i think tfa is middling on its own , but it * really * shines in light of winter soldier , agent carter , and the long term set up it made for the mcu . 
  i always like going back and watching it for seb stan 's acting and the interaction between steve , peggy , and the howling commandos . 
  it 's a great longterm payoff film . 
  i like mooncup and have been using it for a few years now . 
  it works great !, 
  favourite : bucky recovery fics are my jam - i especially love anything with him going between bucky/james and the winter soldier . 
  bucky and natasha ( either paired or gen ) red room stuff is always golden , especially because it 's a little bit of a rarepair , so the fic is always good . 
  anything with the team working together in a good fight sequence is also my * favourite * - they 're an avengers team , let 's see some good team fight stuff going on !, 
  i also have a real soft spot for clint climbing on or in stuff , and generally being a real jerk . 
  i 'm not a clint/coulson fan , i like him a la fraction 's run and being a sarcastic loner , but clint/natasha strike team delta stuff is fun . 
  anything actiony works for me !, 
  least favourite : darcy as the fandom bicycle drives me nuts . 
  i 've seen darcy done perfectly in the right hands , but so often you just see her there to be paired up with someone . 
  ca n't stand a/b/o stuff or anything au . 
  why make cool superheroes mortal ?? 
  it does n't make sense to me . 
  as a brit , suspenders for us are garters for yanks ? 
  i think ? 
  so , uh , no thanks . 
  not generally my cup of tea . 
  might look flattering on a shapely leg though !, 
  same for me !, 
  i 'm 30 and have spent the vast majority of my life single . 
  i really like my own company and my friends company and just making all sorts of plans that suit me . 
  if someone comes along that i fit with , brilliant . 
  if not , no skin off my back . 
  i 'm plenty busy enough anyway . 
  just been given the okay by my mentor to run a few lunchtime sessions with a few year 9 to use the school tablets and look at ww1 art !, 
  i 'm excited , i think it 'll be so interesting for them to be able to really look at these amazing paintings in close up detail and get a little bit of extra enthusiasm for the period that normal lessons might not give them . 
  it might just be for a couple of weeks , it might be more . 
  we 'll see where it goes !, 
  it 's * so hard * to cover everything about the wars though , is n't it ? 
  should you really cram loads of broad events into six or eight lessons so they get a big focus , or focus on one really cool aspect of it in detail and miss loads of stuff like the eastern front or battle of the atlantic or blitz out ? 
  it 's really tough !, 
  ah , see , when i taught ww2 at my last placement school ( i 'm pgce ) , i focused massively on battle of britain and dunkirk and never even touched the eastern front , even though i love it !, 
  it is the most confused google image result . 
  in the thread she usually used a cup , but this time she had horrendous cramps that made it far too uncomfortable to insert , and therefore she did n't have a pack of pads to fall back on . 
  i think she 's great !, 
  i hope civil war gives her some more cool stuff to work with , and i trust the russos to help develop such a cool character . 
  i reaaallllly hope they work on her russian , though . 
  uh , whatever virgin media 's medium package is . 
  definitely 50mbps down , and something like 5 up . 
  just finished it and looooooooooooooved it , but holy crap did every fight scene have to be shot in the dark ?? 
  i understand dd only needing low light to work , but it was getting a bit ridiculous by the end . 
  i want to see the super cool fight choreography !, 
  steve rogers/bucky barnes is my big # 1 favourite right now ( they 're so wonderfully tragic !, 
  ) , though i do really like bucky barnes/natasha romanoff too . 
  remus/sirius is another really heartbreaking one . 
  i definitely have a pattern in my fandoms . 
  oh a couple of tumblrs i follow are mad for captive prince !, 
  it totally seems to have sprung out of nowhere and sent everyone insane for this pairing . 
  what 's march madness and what are brackets ? 
  sport-y type stuff ? 
  sebastian stan has already promised waves of tears . 
  i 'm going to be a * mess * by the credits , i 'm sure of it . 
  i have sooooo many steve/bucky recs , especially for long slow burn types of fics and ws recovery fics . 
  hit up / r/marvelfans if you have n't already for their fic rec threads too . 
  [ 4 minute window ] ( http://archiveofourown.org/works/3130037 ) by speranza . 
  this is * heartbreaking * and a fandom staple . 
  it 's post winter soldier with steve and bucky trying to come together again , and it 's * amazing * . 
  [ rich man , poor man , beggar man , thief ] ( http://archiveofourown.org/works/3267479/chapters/7125380 ) by oddityboddity . 
  oddity is very , very , very good at breaking your heart into tiny little pieces , especially when it concerns steve and bucky . 
  also , this is a great ensemble piece with lots of avengers in . 
  [ waiting for the winter ] ( http://archiveofourown.org/works/1658123/chapters/3517796 ) by coldhope . 
  another very , very good post-ws recovery steve/bucky fic . 
  [ four ( or five ) reasons for kidnapping tony stark ] ( http://archiveofourown.org/works/391599/chapters/642784 ) by scifigrl47 is great . 
  actually , pretty much anything by scifi is great - i generally much prefer stucky to stony , but she really makes me like the pairing !, 
  oh you 're missing out !, 
  * first avenger * is definitely a weak film , but * winter soldier * has the best action sequences and fight choreography , and it really questions the idea of authority and surveillance in society . 
  chris evans makes such a great cap , and it 's genuinely a brilliant movie . 
  winter soldier , iron man , avengers assemble and guardians of the galaxy are all my favourites , with ws on the top . 
  the cap/winter soldier highway fight sequence still makes me gasp , and i loved how different guardians was from anything else . 
  omfg that .
