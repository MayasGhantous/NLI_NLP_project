  the fool from robin hobb 's * farseer * series is my other favourite favourite literary character , but he 's actually genderfluid . 
  he 's a very gentle person who , again , is trying to do the best he can in a really difficult world . 
  he also loves fitz * so much * , and it breaks my heart whenever the two of them argue or are pulled apart . 
  to add to the stats you 've already got , it 's very common for families to nip over to the continent for a holiday at some point . 
  we get very cheap air deals to go pretty much anywhere in europe , and you can easily get package holidays to disneyland paris , a resort in portugal or spain , skiing in italy or france , or even a coach trip to a christmas market in germany . 
  it cost me # 40 each way last year to go to denmark . 
  it 's not surprising that so many people have passports when you look at how simple it is for us to move around and cross borders for short , cheap trips away . 
  edit : many schools will also arrange european trips , so most teenagers will get a passport at some point during secondary school . 
  i went to france in yr 7 and to the battlefields in belgium in yr 9 , and the school i 'm working in now does trips to iceland , berlin and belgium - and that 's just the history and geography departments . 
  quick q , how do you set res filters ? 
  i 've just had a browse through the settings console but ca n't find that option . 
  that 's a good point , actually . 
  we legally get given more time to go on holiday and have more options open to us to go abroad . 
  explains why so many brits have passports and so few americans do . 
  it 's crazy is n't it ? 
  i have a friend who went for a night out in germany because it was cheaper than ( or the same price as ) london . 
  easyjet flights each way , party in berlin for the evening . 
  no , i work in stones for body weight , and feet and inches for height . 
  when cooking i do use g and kg , oddly enough . 
  hope you enjoy the holiday !, 
  where are you coming to see ? 
  i 'd recommend the three that you absolutely need to watch are avengers assemble , captain america : winter soldier and age of ultron . 
  that will give you most of the team dynamics and set up for civil war . 
  background ( apologies , i 'm typing this on mobile ) :, 
  ** iron man ** : tony stark is an arrogant prick who likes making weapons and splashing money around . 
  he 's kidnapped and tortured in afghanistan and builds his first iron man suit to escape , losing his prisoner friend yinsen in the process . 
  he turns stark industries from a weapons manufacturer into a company based around clean energy and reveals at a press conference that he is the mysterious iron man seen fighting another giant robot ( his old mentor obadiah stane ) the night before . 
  in a post credits scene nick fury tells him about the avengers . 
  ** captain america ** : steve rogers is skinny , sick and desperate to be a soldier fighting in ww2 . 
  his very best friend bucky is drafted and sent to fight in italy . 
  steve gets recruited into a secret army medical programme and selected to become cap . 
  he also meets peggy carter at this point and has a massive crush on her . 
  after he becomes cap , he finds out bucky and his battalion have all been captured in italy . 
  cap goes to rescue bucky and is helped by howard stark and peggy carter . 
  turns out bucky has been experimented on by arnim zola and ( we know ) he is also given a version of the super soldier serum , designed by the nazi rogue science division , hydra . 
  steve rescues hundreds of soldiers and ends up staying to fight hydra in europe with bucky and steve 's new elite squad , the howling commandos . 
  he becomes close to peggy carter and is given his shield by howard stark . 
  while on one mission , bucky falls from a train in the swiss alps and is presumed kia . 
  steve does one final attack on a hydra base , and is forced to crash a plane in the arctic because of its load of nuclear bombs on board . 
  it ends with steve being found , defrosted and woken up in our century . 
  ** iron man 2 ** : tony is being poisoned by his arc reactor and has daddy issues with his father howard stark . 
  don cheadle replaces terence howard as rhodey , who takes the war machine armour when tony is becoming more unstable . 
  nick fury plants natasha romanoff in stark industries to evaluate tony as a potential avenger . 
  meanwhile tony finds a way to remake and stabilise his arc reactor which involves making peace with his dead dad . 
  he also finds out about natasha and is vastly less than impressed . 
  ** thor : the dark world ** : an alien force gets hold of a mysterious power called the aether . 
  this will be relevant in the infinity war films . 
  thor goes to save the world , along with his unreliable brother loki . 
  there 's a huge battle that wrecks a chunk of south london . 
  thor recaptures the aether , returns to asgard and talks to his father odin to turn down taking the throne of asgard . 
  he then leaves and it turns out loki is alive and disguising himself as odin . 
  this is going to be relevant in thor : ragnarok . 
  ** iron man 3 : ** tony is traumatised from almost dying during avengers assemble and is throwing himself into designing hundreds of iron man suits . 
  his best friend rhodey is also now operating as war machine/iron patriot . 
  a rival company is designing a force called extremis that makes people all powerful whilst also sometimes making them explode . 
  tonys home is attacked , pepper is kidnapped and injected with extremis . 
  tony saves the world , says he ` fixes ' pepper ( but we do n't know if the writers have decided that means removing extremis or making it stable so she 's also a superhero ) , gets his arc reactor removed and destroys all of his suits . 
  he 's still iron man , just less neurotic about it . 
  ** ant-man ** : introduces scott lang , who is ` given ' ( sort of ) a suit that allows him to shrink down while retaining his normal mass and strength . 
  he also gets given a way to communicate with ants so they can work for him . 
  scott was a criminal but becomes a pretty cool wise - cracking superhero who will be joining team cap in civil war . 
  no problem . 
  i think the key thing to know is that tony started out very anti - government ( they tried to requisition his suits in im2 ) but he developed through im1 , im2 , im3 , aa and aou to realise that you need systems and accountability in place to protect people . 
  cap has gone the opposite way - he 's very much a government man in tfa and gets betrayed by authority throughout his films . 
  the events of winter soldier and the characters are in that are really really key to civil war . 
  i ca n't say any more than that without spoiling it for you !, 
  nope . 
  fan casting can be great , but marvel know who they want their characters to be . 
  i have every faith in them , whoever gets the part . 
  babysitting for two boys . 
  they watched their ipads for an hour and then went to bed when i asked them to . 
  now i 'm drinking tea and watching the masters on the bbc . 
  works for me !, 
  gunn has seen civil war . 
  he had a screening a couple of weeks ago and put on fb that he loved it . 
  hawkeye is more of an easter egg than anything else . 
  mjolnir has buried itself in new mexico , waiting for the power of thor to claim it and a shield camp has sprung up around it . 
  a mortal thor gets inside to get mjolnir and hawkeye is called in by coulson to put him down if things get too lairy . 
  he basically watches thor beat up some security guards in the rain for a while and then gets stood down when thor ca n't pull mjolnir and gives up . 
  well , you 're clearly okay with sex * in general * , so can you pinpoint why you do n't want to have sex with her specifically ? 
  are you worried that you might hurt or disappoint her ? 
  it sounds like she 's really keen to share something special with you - is the thought of that maybe a bit too much pressure for you ? 
  i 've become vastly more patient about life in general , and very little gets me really flustered . 
  i 've also become much more organised , which is as much a shock to me as it is to my ever-despairing parents !, 
  okay , wow . 
  well , first of all , you 're bringing all of these massive ` how society feels ' generalisations into your relationship . 
  you need to stop that - this is between you and her , not between you and the rest of the world 's thoughts about virgins . 
  this is a private thing that really boils down to your feelings for each other . 
  secondly , she 's a grown woman . 
  give her some agency in her choices . 
  you 're not taking anything away from her - she is choosing to share something with you . 
  she is an adult . 
  she has every right to decide who she wants to share her body with . 
  you do n't get to remove that choice from her , and you 're only damaging your relationship by with drawing from her in order to ` protect ' her somehow . 
  protect her from what , exactly ? 
  as a woman myself , all i wanted from my first time was someone who cared for me and tried to make it fun . 
  that is all that you need to do . 
  do n't make it a big scary event !, 
  use loads of foreplay to relax you both , take it really slowly and listen to her responses . 
  use protection .
