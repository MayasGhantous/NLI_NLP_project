  murder , but in the best kind of way . 
  book characters , but i love fitz and the fool from robin hobb 's * assassins quest * and * tawny man * trilogy . 
  they 're not really a romantic couple in the usual sense of the word , but hobb just writes the most wonderful love between them . 
  the fool is also fabulously genderfluid and just a brilliantly devised character all round . 
  yes , maybe i am a little bit in love with him myself ... 
  i 'm heterosexual with just a touch of bicuriosity . 
  no , europe is not the cesspit of all evil and not all eastern europeans are desperate to implant themselves on our rainy shores . 
  road tripped with an american friend to her home town , went to san antonio for the alamo and another of her friends in austin , think we went to a museum in downtown dallas . 
  drove around a lot , went to some ihops and targets and hole in the wall burger joints , then jumped states to oklahoma . 
  10/10 would texas again . 
  askreddit , askuk , askwomen , bestof , iama , askhistorians , relationships ( for the lolz ), 
  then some general interest ones : / r/fantasy , / r/gymnastics , / r/bodyweightfitness , / r/asoiaf , / r/skyrim, 
  those are the main ones on my res dashboard anyway . 
  i 'm sure i 'm subscribed to a few more . 
  never be afraid to ask for help . 
  i seem to be all about the reformation at the moment in my reading . 
  picked up [ the late medieval english church ] ( http://www.amazon.co.uk/late-medieval-english-church-vulnerability/dp/0300179979/ref=sr_1_1?ie=utf8&amp;qid=1374234872&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+late+medieval+english+church ) to get some background reading in before my 1400-1900 course starts in october , which is interesting to read alongside [ the queens agent : francis walsingham at the court of elizabeth i ] ( http://www.amazon.co.uk/queens-agent-francis-walsingham-elizabeth/dp/057121827x/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=utf8&amp;qid=1374234989&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=francis+walsingham ) and the various goings on between protestants and catholics less than a hundred years later . 
  both of them try to offer lots of little biographies of minor characters at the time , which are really fascinating . 
  quite honestly , if all you want is bargain basement cheap dog from whatever internet seller has them going , you 're just * asking * for trouble . 
  health problems from not being looked after properly , behaviour problems - if you want cheap , then all you get is cheap , and that is not fair on the dog that you 're buying . 
  if you ca n't afford the right price for a good puppy , can you actually afford the costs for food , grooming and vet bills ? 
  forget the googled sellers - all you 're going to get there are puppy farms . 
  stay away from ` designer dog ' breeders , too . 
  if you do n't want a pedigree ( and a kc registered dog is not a ` moneyspinner ' , thanks ) then do research into the breed you like and go specifically to breed rescues . 
  they 'll have a better idea of where the dogs they 're offering have come from and whether they 'll work well with cats for you . 
  i have a year old dog , and show him , which means i travel the country to go spend a day around several hundred other dogs at least once a month . 
  this is not a hobby i 'll be giving up any time soon . 
  dog allergic men are a total deal breaker for me . 
  same . 
  i have precisely zero desire to shoot a gun . 
  they scare the living crap out of me . 
  do not want . 
  ** do you own a gun ( s ) ? 
  ** no , and i have no desire to . 
  ** have you shot one before ? 
  ** i have vague teenage memories of shooting a bb gun at a target , but i do n't recall ever shooting a real gun with live ammo . 
  ** do you live primarily in the city , suburb , or rural areas ? 
  ** i grew up in the country and went to uni in a city . 
  now back in the country . 
  ** what country are you from ? 
  ** england , southeast to be exact . 
  i would rather be suitably afraid of guns than too nonchalant about them . 
  guns , to me , are not a ` fun ' thing , they are a dangerous thing and i would rather avoid getting complacent about them like i am with cars . 
  guns were designed to kill . 
  cars are not . 
  i 'm 28 and right now i work in sales , though i 'm currently doing long distance learning for a second degree and plan to go into secondary school history teaching . 
  i should hopefully be doing teacher training in the next two to three years . 
  it 's a bit rude to ask how much people earn , is n't it ? 
  rare or medium rare . 
  mmm juicy . 
  nope . 
  it 's not like there 's lashings of blood pouring out of the meat anyway , just a little speck of it . 
  does n't bother me . 
  there will only be international festival shows on in september as the main bulk of them , the fringe , finishes somewhere around the 29th august and then most people leave town . 
  the end of festival fireworks are always worth watching from calton hill with a radio tuned in to hear the national orchestra playing choreographed arrangements from princes street gardens , but they normally happen around the 5th september . 
   what is radio 1 ? 
  as well as tv channels , the bbc runs national radio channels . 
  radio 1 is for the 16-25 age demographic with lots of top 40 stuff , radio 2 is more aimed at 30-60 year olds with some older songs and a bit more talk , radio 3 is classical music , radio 4 is talk , drama and comedy shows ( all really interesting ) , and radio 5 is sport . 
  the daily mail . 
  they 've been running this stupid campaign on their front pages for months now , and daily mail readers are largely pro-conservative . 
  it 's totally ridiculous , but it just shows how influential the media is on politics . 
  to go on holiday . 
  it does n't even need to be on an island in the bahamas - just a week or two off in a nice hotel somewhere would be absolute heaven . 
  yup . 
  mine was relaxed , mutually loving , my choice and reasonably enjoyable . 
  i 've got no issues about it . 
  that 's kind of a massive overgeneralisation . 
  i 'm english and i ca n't do the ` friends to relationship ' jump - i can only be interested in that way in new men who 's a stranger to me but has instant chemistry . 
  plenty of my friends are the same and we have a roaring trade in online dating websites , which is the epitome of the ` you seem interesting etc ' approach . 
  physically i think generally overall i 'm a 7 or 8 . 
  i 'm not classically pretty , but i know that men find me attractive , i 've got a good body ( and awesome boobs ) , i 'm pretty fit weight-wise and i know how to dress quite well . 
  mentally , i think of myself as a 9 or 10 - i 've travelled a shedload ( somewhere around 35 countries so far and multiple american states ) , i 'm smart , driven , nerdy enough to get most culture in-jokes , a good friend and an all round pretty cool gal . 
  i genuinely have no idea how other people rate me - i 've never really thought about it . 
  i walk around in public with a lot of confidence and often get compliments on my hairstyle or what i 'm wearing , so i guess reasonably high ? 
  definitely this series . 
  i love them . 
  the second and third book in that trilogy can get quite dark , definitely [ spoiler description ] ( #s `` thinking mostly of fitz 's time in regal 's dungeon during assassins quest '' ) but i do n't recall any rape scenes, 
  sure . 
  not in a rabid kind of way , but more in an `` oh that 's nice '' kind of way . 
  i 'm interested to see if she has a boy or a girl and to find out what names they 've chosen , and the fact that the primogeniture laws wo n't stand in the way of a future queen , but i 'm not watching live feeds of the hospital doors or anything . 
  it 's quite often taught at drama schools for aspiring actors , so it 's at least taken seriously enough in the performance industries . 
  i 'm single , so i do n't know personally what i would do , but my parents have been married almost thirty years now , and ` check in ' with each other every lunchtime and evening . 
  i think it 's a nice way to keep up with how your so 's day is going . 
  sometimes . 
  i 'm reasonably hopeful that i will get married and do the family thing someday , but yeah , there are days that i just think `` i am never going to meet someone . '', 
  it 's hard when i work by myself a lot of the time and do n't have my main social group in the same town , too . 
  the poet seamus heaney was commissioned in 2004 to create a version of sophocles ' * antigone * , which he called * the burial at thebes * , and is a modern reworking of the play taken from other translations . 
  it 's really very readable and worth getting a hold of the text if you can . 
  as antigone deals with a lot of themes to do with an individual against the state , loyalty to family and repercussions of war it 's quite a popular play to stage at the moment . 
  you might have some luck with local theatres or drama schools staging a production sometime this year perhaps ? 
  i guess it depends where you are - although you 're right that there 's not much in the way of games about ww1 , here in the uk we have a lot of tv revolving around it , especially bbc drama productions . 
  birdsong and downton abbey spring to mind in particular . 
  maybe now it 's coming up to the centenary there will be even more dramas made ? 
  i make sure she 's breathing and see if anyone nearby knows her , then tell a member of staff that she 's passed out and needs help . 
  then i leave her well alone . 
  oh fabulous , thanks for that . 
  * the ark * sounds fascinating !, 
  i 'm 28 and still at home for various reasons ( though i 'm aching to be independent again ) , so it would be quite hypocritical of me to refuse to date you for that reason . 
  other women might well be more picky than me and say it 's a dealbreaker . 
  as a note , i do think you might get more neutral reactions to your circumstances in other countries than america .
