  i would email someone at your former school with copies of his messages and let them know what he 's doing . 
  i know you feel like you probably do n't want to get him into trouble , but these are * his * actions . 
  he messaged you first . 
  he 's brought up the marriage issues . 
  * he * is being inappropriate . 
  informing the school of what he 's doing will stop him doing these sorts of things with other students later down the line . 
   if he is someone that mentors young confused muslim men who feel ashamed about their homosexuality it makes sense that he would have issues with islam, 
  where on earth did you get that from ? 
  op mentions absolutely nothing about her brother being a counsellor or working with gay men in the islamic community . 
  it 's the boyfriend who volunteers around the community , not the brother . 
  it was mostly this line that i referred to about being xenophobic : `` the problem here is my brother is completely against islam , he does not respect muslim people and is part of large upcoming gay conservative section and believes very strongly that they are dangerous to his way of life '' . 
  it just sounds exactly like those daily mail / daily express headlines , you know ? 
  i 'm totally on the brothers side here ( just not with the punching ) . 
  i mean , clearly he was open to getting along with the ex until those comments came up , and that 's great . 
  but him being gay does n't give him the right to tar all muslims with the same brush either . 
  lighting technician for an events company . 
  i think i was on about # 16,000 , which was fine at the time in edinburgh . 
  the job was fine , just quite boring and did n't really get me where i was wanting to go . 
  i moved on to do more freelance work after that . 
  usually fanfic . 
  i like to do a search for what i want to read ( usually marvel steve rogers/bucky barnes non-au gen stuff ) , open about fifteen different fics in different tabs and then slowly work my way through them and bookmark as i go . 
  it takes a while !, 
  oooh i 'm just starting out too !, 
  i was going to make a post about other lady golfers yesterday , so excellent psychic connection work there . 
  my dad is a devoted golfer and he 's teaching me over the summer while i 'm home . 
  he bought me one club to start , a 6 iron , and a golfing glove and we went to the driving range a few times to practice . 
  you do n't need any more specific gear than that . 
  really , i think it 's good to just practice hitting golf balls a few times before you start collecting all the gear . 
  i 'm assuming i 'll need proper shoes at * some * point , but not while i 'm just in the driving range . 
  i 've also booked onto some cheap group lessons at a good local club to get some practice . 
  `` okay , thanks . '', 
  do n't engage . 
  what 's the point when you know she 's giving you bad advice ? 
  just deflect , smile politely and carry on with what you 're doing . 
  sounds like you 're doing great !, 
  reading fatf as a standalone would be rather like jumping into the third or fourth series of a television show , or watching return of the king before watching fellowship and two towers . 
  you 'd get most of the main points , and you 'd get the hang of what 's going on with the storyline , but you would n't * really * feel the emotional impact of what hobb is doing with these characters - and really , the emotional impact is hobb 's forte when it comes to her books . 
  i think if you do n't like her for who she is right at this moment , and you 're more worried about * your * image rather than * her * being teased , then you should n't ask her out . 
  and i 'm sure your girlfriend would think a lot less of * you * if she were to find out that you were running a secret business with a secret second income and spying on other people for a living . 
  you 're not infallible here , op . 
  because it * was n't a relationship * ? 
  it was her chasing him for six months and not getting anywhere . 
  they never dated , kissed or had sex , right ? 
  what part of that says ` relationship ' to you ? 
  also , she does n't have to tell you every tiny little minutiae of her past crushes . 
  it 's not obligatory . 
  / r/okcupid can give you good profile critique advice and posts about how to get the most out of the site . 
  i 'd recommend you go and look there . 
  and from the pov of your girlfriend , i would argue that keeping a whole second spying job is n't even comparable to asking a guy out a few times . 
  also , you only even know this stuff because you * hacked into your girlfriends private conversations * . 
  and her ** bank account ** !, 
  let 's just skim over the fact that you could potentially have committed fraud here !, 
  like , back the fuck up here . 
  * you * are in the wrong , and you 're only justifying it by whinging that you did n't know she has a crush on someone else , and there was a 6 month fling she kept to herself . 
  big fucking deal . 
  * she is allowed to keep secrets * , and ** you ** are not allowed to gain access to other peoples private bank accounts !, 
  i see both steve and bucky as bi , but for different reasons and in different ways . 
  ** bucky ** has always seemed more worldly to me , more aware of what 's going on and who he is . 
  i know in the comics steve referred to him as doing the dirty work while steve was the shining beacon , and i feel like that secret second life was n't just in his work but in his sexuality too . 
  i like fics where bucky has flings with other soldiers during ww2 , and i think after recovering from the soldier he 's learning everything new again without any preference for sexuality . 
  i just feel like he 's more of an open character who 'll fall for either gender , and i like seeing him both with natasha and with steve ( and occasionally clint or tony ), 
  i do n't see pre-serum ** steve ** as bi at all , i see him as straight . 
  i think he was just really closeted from the world and kept really innocent because of his illnesses , so going off with anything other than a pretty girl was * totally * not even on his radar . 
  when peggy comes along , i definitely think steve is head over heels for her . 
  i feel like he loves bucky , but i do n't personally headcanon that they did anything sexual together while they were on commando missions and in the field . 
  i * do * feel like the tour showgirls did teach steve quite a lot , though !, 
  comparitively , i think post-serum modern steve has had time to consider these things and what he wants from the world . 
  in aou he tells tony that the person who went into the ice and the one who came out are very different , and feel like that plays into his love life and sexuality too . 
  i feel like modern-era steve is more likely to act on feelings for bucky , especially when he has nobody else left who he loves like he loves bucky . 
  i hate the term ` demisexual ' , but maybe that 's what steve is . 
  ** natasha ** is mostly straight , but hey , she 's also a spy . 
  she 'll go with whatever the mission needs , and probably enjoy it quite a lot , too . 
  i do love the idea of her flirting with pepper , though . 
  ** clint ** is straight , but i also really like reading scifigrls bucky/clint stuff , mostly because i think he will connect with anyone who understands him well enough . 
  ** loki ** is pan , of course . 
  ** thor ** i 'll also go with pan , only because i do n't think asgardians have the same concept of sexuality as midgardians do !, 
  ** tony ** i feel like is pretty straight , but he 'll flirt with whoever is on his radar and do a damn good job of it . 
  ** sam ** and ** rhodey ** i have no idea on . 
  blame a lack of onscreen development for both of them perhaps ? 
  generally straight , though maybe biromantic for sam . 
  chiwetel is mordo , yep . 
  he was solomon northrup in 12 years a slave and vincent kapoor in the martian , which is where you might know him from ? 
  zoe 's photo is the only one i 'm not so keen on , but holy hell her waist is * tiny * . 
  look at that !, 
  love chris pratt and michael rooker 's portraits . 
  also , how does lupita nyong ' o look so flawless in every single picture you ever see of her ? 
  she 's magic . 
  do n't just look at the photo of them , but what they 're doing to give you clues . 
  are there lots of sporty photos or are they at the pub or off travelling ? 
  are they looking outdoorsy ? 
  is there a pet or possibly family member in the picture to ask about ? 
  one of my tinder photos is me at a dog show , and quite a few of the last few messages i 've had have asked me whether i 'm at crufts ( which is right ! ) . 
  it 's a good way to start a conversation . 
  they all look like they 'd have * really * intense conversations , do n't they ? 
   that little doofy looking pipsqueak is supposed to be flash thompson ? 
  that kid looks like someone flash thompson would stuff in a locker . 
  i 'd never believe that kid as bmoc or star athlete . 
  that 's because it 's just the actor looking doofy and pulling a silly face . 
  i 'm sure once he 's in costume and makeup he 'll look more like a flash . 
  marvel has n't let us down in casting yet , why do you think they 'll screw up the spider-man franchise with poor actors ?
