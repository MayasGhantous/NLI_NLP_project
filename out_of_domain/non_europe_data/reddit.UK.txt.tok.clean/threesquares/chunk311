  these are some of the [ certificates won this year ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wylz5kv.jpg ) including the bath show that gave me our crufts place . 
  ** edit ** a few people have asked for photos of my puppy henry , so [ here 's one in the garden ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fcri6nn.jpg ) and [ here 's another profile view ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bttl4yy.jpg ) . 
  ** edit 2 ** : thanks reddit , it 's been great fun !, 
  it 's 11:30 pm gmt now so i 'm signing off for bed , but if there 's any questions in the morning i 'll make sure i 'll answer them all . 
  for reference , my town is colchester in the uk . 
  it claims inspiration for twinkle twinkle little star , written by jane and ann taylor , humpty dumpty which possibly originates from the story of a cavalier cannon being destroyed from the top of a church during the english civil war , and ole king cole . 
  he could possibly have been one of the coel 's who were lord of colchester somewhere around 300ad . 
  i know that in my favourite period ( tudor and elizabethan england ) there were particular laws passed dictating the fabrics , colours and styles worn by each level of society . 
  i also know that to some extent there were appearance laws for the romans as well ( i.e. 
  only allowed to wear the colour purple depending on your status ) . 
  do these same kind of laws appear in other cultures and historical periods ? 
  specifically , what appearance laws applied to the public domain ( so , not uniform regulations ) and to what extent were they actually enforced ? 
  it 's the perfect time for a good summer ( or winter for aussies ! ), 
  read , so what pages are everyone devouring at the moment ? 
  right now i 'm burning my way through robin hobb 's * rain wild chronicles * , which are fantasy fiction about the adventures of dragons and their keepers up a dangerous river to find a mystical ancestral home . 
  i read her * assassins apprentice * and * tawny man * trilogies a couple of years ago and loved them , but i only just picked up the first rwc book a couple of days ago to try it and now i 'm obsessed . 
  it 's so good !, 
  where ( geographically ) do you live right now , where have you lived in the past and where would you like to end up ? 
  future living plans can be realistic or totally fantasy , up to you . 
  hopefully we 'll get some crossovers of aw habitation !, 
  and what are you reading it on - paper book or e-reader ? 
  ignoring the paperback odyssey that i have to read for uni study , i 'm spending my spare time re-reading assassin 's apprentice , the first in robin hobb 's ` farseer ' trilogy . 
  i adore the fantasy genre . 
  i 'm addicted to my kindle right now . 
  this is actually my second one after my puppy ate my first one a week ago . 
  i still have hundreds of paperbacks and hardback books , but for me the e-reader is currently king . 
  what about you , aw ? 
  i went to music school on the weekends for about four years to learn the flute and play in orchestras , but i 've sadly let it lapse . 
  i keep trying to pick it up again , and i miss playing music but i can never find regular practice time to get up to speed . 
  is anyone else the same ? 
  i went to see the new hunger games yesterday , and it was * all right * , but i was probably thinking too much about the book adaption to really just go with it and enjoy it . 
  saw thor 2 a few days before that and * loved * it . 
  i also now have a rather large girl-crush on tom hiddleston , but hey , who can blame me ? 
  hot actors in movie photos are also totally optional ( and encouraged ), 
  so i 've been coughing almost constantly for basically three weeks straight and i 'm sick to death of it . 
  the gp told me last week it was a viral thing and it 'll clear and take lots of paracetamol blah blah blah , but in the meantime i 'm still hacking away over here . 
  so now i 'm looking to you , aw . 
  what 's your coughs and colds remedy ? 
  do you have a go to failsafe get-rid-of-the-germs concoction to down at the first sign of a sniffle ? 
  help save me and my poorly lungs from winter trials and tribulations !, 
  i know we have quite a few ex or current students in here , so let 's see what the combined educational strength of an aw pub quiz team can offer !, 
  right now i 'm working my way through a history degree with the open university ( so distance learning , basically ) , currently focusing on mainly british and european history from 1400-1900 and also ancient greece and rome . 
  edit : oh my god , honestly aw we rock . 
  what a talented bunch of people we have in here !, 
  i 'm so impressed with all of you !, 
  hi / r/travel !, 
  i 'm lucky enough to be getting a # 500 christmas bonus this year , and as i have n't left the uk in about four years , i 'd quite like to put it towards a short , cheap city break in europe over a weekend in january , but i 'm struggling to filter travel website ideas down to really find the best deal . 
  more details : ideally i 'll be flying out of london stansted as it 's by far the closest one to me . 
  i 've visited the netherlands before and loved it , but i 've always had a draw towards germany and would like to visit . 
  other destinations i 'm open to are italy or france and have visited both before . 
  switzerland is beautiful but far too expensive right now !, 
  i know little to nothing about good german cities - i 've heard hamburg is lovely ? 
  i 'll be travelling on my own and will probably bag a hostel , or maybe a mid budget hotel if it 's only a couple of nights . 
  i 'm studying history and love anything cultural . 
  not fussed about nightlife , i prefer cafe culture and sitting around with a book watching the world go by or finding gorgeous art or history museums to spend afternoons in . 
  any suggestions or ideas just to start narrowing destinations down would be much appreciated !, 
  many thanks . 
  i 'm a lucky sod and have the massive tv on at work to watch all the bbc coverage of the winter olympics , and the canada/usa ice hockey match is so fast !, 
  so far i 've been a bit in love with the mens moguls and all of the crazy ski jump people launching themselves down a massive hill . 
  i 've even been enjoying the curling !, 
  link me some good stuff , guys and gals !, 
  one of my all time favourites :, 
  frisky and mannish doing their [ stoner melody ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnpnnnzaje ) . 
  these two are double act twisted pop geniuses . 
  also , the problem with scottish accents really becomes obvious with [ voice recognition software . 
  ] ( http://youtu.be/ok4-y_xqhbe ), 
  and finally derren brown does some [ fabulous magic with a light bulb ] ( http://youtu.be/hmkswk42jwg?t=1m55s ) . 
  good luck to anyone in here who might be exhibiting or just going along to enjoy the day at the worlds biggest dog show !, 
  it 's so much fun and such a busy day out !, 
  you can watch all the live main arena coverage on their [ youtube channel ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/officialcrufts ) too . 
  we 'll be showing our english setter on sunday , and then doing so much doggy shopping it 's unreal . 
  wish us luck !, 
  ( because page 1 is full up of sodding sex questions . 
  again . ), 
  right now i 'm squeezing in reading brandon sanderson 's new book * words of radiance * , which is the third book in his stormlight archive series . 
  it 's really good !, 
  i have to just read two or three pages at a time in between study time though , which is killing me . 
  i really want to just throw my textbooks out the window and sit down with a good fantasy novel for a while . 
  i always like our little triumph posts !, 
  my little brag is that i just got an assignment back that i was dead certain i would get like 60 % on and i got a * 90 * . 
  holy crap . 
  i 'm not sure what my tutor is smoking lately , but i like it !, 
  just a little detail i was intrigued by , really . 
  as far as i 'm aware , szeth was always referred to , and referred to himself , as szeth-son-son-vallano , but in his last chapter nin called him szeth-son-neturo . 
  might there be a specific reason why szeth referred to his grandfather 's patronage instead of his father ? 
  has he been called szeth-son-neturo before ? 
  i know brandon never does things like this without a reason !, 
  gryffindor all the way baby !, 
  rawr . 
  has anyone read this ? 
  i just finished it this morning ( another one of those ca n't - put-it-down ) books and just loved it . 
  [ here 's the goodreads for it ] ( https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18947303-traitor-s-blade ) . 
  very very locke lamora-ey with some great fight sequences from an author who apparently is an actual fight choreographer , which really shows !, 
  it was only published in march , so i think it could do with a little bit of a word of mouth push . 
  it 's always such a treat to find a good new author on the scene , and i do think this one in particular is very good !, 
  i just feel like whinging about my academic life right now , quite honestly . 
  it 's getting close to my exams , i 've got a shitload of stuff to learn in three weeks about several * totally * different time periods , and i just got one of my final assignments back with the joint lowest mark i 've received all year . 
  plus it counts towards more of my overall final score than any other assignment . 
  which is , you know , great . 
  god i need a holiday .
