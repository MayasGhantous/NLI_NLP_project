  get it off your chest , aw . 
  what 's driving you up the wall this evening ? 
  major , minor , tell us about whatever is grating your goat today . 
  i am in luuuuurve with my gorgeous [ new nude heels ] ( http://i.imgur.com/w3xlyf0 ) that i got on saturday - even better was the 20 % off and student discount that came with them !, 
  also , is n't [ this necklace ] ( http://i.imgur.com/aeoaxrv ) just the cutest thing ever ? 
  i 'm a bit in love with it . 
  for me it 's either got to be the good old [ 99 with a flake ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-bqu7xkuooaw/ubg4mcex6di/aaaaaaaaevk/pjwpa8tssmk/s1600/99-flake-ice-cream-006.jpg ) or ben & jerrys cookie dough . 
  yummmmmmmmmmmmm . 
  i 'll just preface by saying i 'm a massive harry potter fan and think the books are compulsory fantasy reading for anyone , so that 's my take on it . 
  anyway , i 've just been watching videos of the new universal studios hp extension and it got me thinking - are these books now counted as classic reading for anyone interested in fantasy , or ya of any kind ? 
  are they that universal and enduring that future generations will still be reading them and enjoying fantasy work ? 
  are they the narnia of our generation , or even the hobbit of the 90s/2000s ? 
  they 're already on the / r/fantasy list of top novels of all time , so i know we generally like them as a whole . 
  i was also caught out when i recommended hp to someone on / r/fantasy a couple of weeks ago , and their response was `` well , of course - i thought that was a given ! '', 
  after all , it has the classic fantasy elements ; an orphan going from zero to hero , witches , wizards , magic , good vs evil , a quest ( two quests even !, 
  ) , magic languages , dragons , dwarfs , goblins , an ultimate evil villain , a slow gain of fabulous magical powers , and so on and so on . 
  is that enough to make it a classic ? 
  or does it need something more ? 
  does sheer popularity make it a classic ? 
  i 'd be interested to see what everyone else thinks . 
  so many sex questions in here lately !, 
  good grief . 
  let 's mix it up a bit . 
  aw , what do you have on your bookshelf ? 
  currently i 'm re-reading * harry potter and the chamber of secrets * , whilst also doing some heavy factual reading of * postwar * by tony judt before my uni term starts again . 
  i 'm also dipping in and out of * the first ladies of rome : the women behind the caesars * by anneliese freisenbruch , but i 've been doing that for about a year now , so it does n't really count . 
  i did an impromptu two hour trip to see my best friend yesterday afternoon and it was wonderful . 
   we went to a tea room , had big slabs of cake , ate pringles , talked politics and played mariokart . 
  perfect sunday . 
  when was the last time you met up with yours ? 
  i am all about the guardians of the galaxy fic right now , but there 's a distinct lack of it . 
  sad , woe !, 
  i especially crave stuff that has good character voices , but apparently that is * really really hard * for people to write . 
  where is my rogueish star-lord and dry wit gamora , people ? 
  where did they go ? 
  anyway !, 
  so , what are your favourite fanfic recommendations right now ? 
  what have you bookmarked out of love and devotion ? 
  what do you sneak a read of at lunchtime that 's grabbed you by the coat tails ? 
  what should i absolutely , one hundred percent read as soon as i get a chance , and why ? 
  i hate maths . 
  i 'm studying history , but to train as a teacher in the uk you now have to pass english and maths tests . 
  i 'm rubbish at it and it * sucks * . 
  ugh maths . 
  for me , it has to be [ scarlett johanssen ] ( http://innercircle.sunglasshut.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/scarlett-johansson-2014-4.jpg ) , especially as [ black widow ] ( http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11112/111127104/3441461-the_avengers_black_widow-wide.jpg ) . 
  i just think all that [ red hair ] ( http://www.hdwallpapers.in/walls/the_avengers_scarlett_johansson-wide.jpg ) is super hot on her . 
  also , [ zoe saldana ] ( http://www.topnews.in/files/zoe-saldana_4.jpg ) is just about the [ cutest thing ever ] ( http://im02.thewallpapers.org/photo/26833/zoe-saldana-111.jpg ) !, 
  it 's not , tescos . 
  it 's just embarrassing . 
  it sounds silly , but i ca n't wait for the guardians of the galaxy dvd to come out on the 24th !, 
  i love me some star-lord shenanigans . 
  what about you , aw ? 
  bear with me here . 
  i 've had short bobs or overgrown pixie cuts for about twelve years now and i ca n't remember what it 's like to be a longer haired lovely . 
  i think the last time i even had shoulder length hair was back in about 2001 . 
  now i 'm growing it out , it 's to about halfway down my neck now , and there is just hair * everywhere * . 
  i have to pull a knot of it out of the plughole every time i wash my hair just to let the water drain . 
  is this normal ?? 
  my hair 's really really thick so i 'm not surprised that there 's some loss , but this seems a little much !, 
  i just got notification that i had a postgrad university application rejected from one of my three choices today , and i 'm feeling a little down in the dumps . 
  everyone knows misery loves company . 
  anything you 'd like to get off your chest this morning ? 
  i 'm just so proud of myself . 
  it was actually really okay as well - i just kept plugging away , and when the active lady told me to cool down it was almost like ` really ? 
  already ?! ', 
  feels so good to have made it this far . 
  in any sense , whether it 's hotness or coolness or just all-round wow factor . 
  who 's the best ? 
  personally , i love bond , but bourne 's just got more of that cool spy stuff going on , you know ? 
  plus , he does n't go around telling everyone he 's jason bourne all the time . 
  oh , i 'm james bond and i have loads of nasty vicious bad guys chasing me , i 'll just check into a hotel under my * real name * . 
  i even managed a little sprint at the end !, 
  very proud of that !, 
  i was challenged by my cousins and brother last year to enter a 10k run on the 1st of feb , which is * slightly * terrifying , but i 'm hoping if i can get up to a 45 minute run or at least do 7k in the next couple of weeks , then i 'll be okay . 
  i 've got my bridge to 10k app downloaded - wish me luck !, 
  because my university study modules are currently all about the holocaust and the extermination of polish jews which is depressing as fuck . 
  hot celebrities help enormously !, 
  who 's your favourite right now ? 
  tl ; dr : read the letters your frigging insurer sends you . 
  last november i renewed my zurich car insurance policy and 5 years no claims with swinton . 
  while i was with zurich i had two windscreen chip repairs , which as far as i was aware was covered under no claims . 
  my renewal was about # 350-ish . 
  i 've had no other accidents/damage/claims whatsoever . 
  apparently when swinton got the proof of no claims through from zurich , they saw two queried claims on there . 
  they sent me letters , and i fully admit i did n't open them because i thought they were marketing bumpf , like the shedloads that the aa still send me . 
  i take full responsibility for that . 
  i did n't get any phone calls , emails , anything else . 
  in january they cancelled my policy due to ` non-disclosure ' . 
  i phoned them up today , as i had opened a letter that said my direct debit amount had changed and wanted to query it , only to be advised that i 've been driving around without insurance for about two weeks . 
  wtf . 
  to renew was # 560 . 
  phoning around everywhere else is getting me renewal quotes of # 700 !, 
  it was two tiny windscreen chips !, 
  the people at swinton said they did n't think non-disclosure should affect it that much , but clearly it has . 
  i 'm a good driver , i really am , but i 'm now worried sick that my rates are going to be obscene for the next five years , all over two chips . 
  is there anything i can do ? 
  i got a 94 % mark back on a super tough third year history essay today and i 'm over the moon !, 
  i 've never had a mark that high before . 
  also , i booked myself a cheap return flight away to copenhagen ; the first time i 'll have been abroad in about four years . 
  what are you super chuffed about right now , aw ?
