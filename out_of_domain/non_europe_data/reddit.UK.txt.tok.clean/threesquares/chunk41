  it happens all the damn time . 
  i just ignore it . 
  ` beautiful ' is such a generic compliment - what does it actually * mean * ? 
  i 'd be ** far ** more flattered if you told me how nice my top looks , or how pretty my hairstyle is . 
  it 's much more personal than just `` you 're beautiful !, 
  as the nights get darker i switch the colour of the accessories in my room around . 
  i have light cream walls , cream cabinet fronts and cream bed linen but in winter i switch all the other accessories ( curtains , rug , blanket , candle holders , decorative bits ) to purple or red . 
  it helps freshen things up and makes the room feel much warmer again for the cold nights . 
  in the spring they get changed back to white or a really light blue . 
  you know what , i love chocolate fudge cake . 
  adore it . 
  and i thought my favourite ever chocolate fudge cake was one i get all the time from a little local cafe in my village . 
  delicious . 
  and then i went on holiday last week , went to a new cafe and i ordered their chocolate fudge cake . 
  it was , quite honestly , about the best thing i have * ever * tasted , and it threw all of my preconceptions about my favourite out of the window . 
  * you * are the new dimension to his preconception of relationships and women . 
  he gets to do first time kisses with you all over again . 
  he gets to have new conversations and first time sex and first time ' i love you ' with you . 
  just because he 's done it before does n't make all of these things dull and tired . 
  why do you think there are so many people who are serial monogamists out there in the world ? 
  it 's all of those exciting new romance endorphins giving them ` love highs ' . 
  have a little more faith in yourself . 
  i 'm sure he 's giddy with excitement over you - do n't ruin it when you 're just getting started !, 
  same here . 
  mine get in the way no matter what i do , so i just smoosh those suckas down . 
  nope . 
  99 % certain it 's illegal here ( uk ) . 
  no , i only count partners i 've had piv sex with . 
  because they 're my sexual ( i.e. 
  having sex ) partners . 
  it 's a very british and irish thing to buy rounds for the group . 
  not so much in america , i think . 
  i have a close friend who is absolutely gorgeous . 
  she 's completely stunning and a real laugh to boot , so she 's always surrounded by people . 
  yeah i got a bit jealous of her sometimes , who would n't be ? 
  she 's got that classic ` upperclass ' look to her where she just knows what to wear and how to style her hair to look perfect . 
  but i take big comfort in the fact that i am by * far * the better friend . 
  she 's totally unreliable , often flakes out on plans or just does n't call/skype when she says she will . 
  she 's dumped plans with us other friends in favour of boyfriends before and goes completely off-circuit when she has a new man in her life . 
  so i just take her with a pinch of salt , have a good time with her when she 's back around again and talk to my friends who are around and who are reliable . 
  also , i have never , not once , thought of myself as ` the ugly friend ' . 
  because i 'm not . 
  i 've got my own style and look , and she ca n't touch it . 
  do n't put yourself down - just because she 's ` classically pretty ' does n't mean you 're automatically ugly . 
  i 'm sure you 're completely fabulous in your own right . 
  i guess most people would look surprised and ask ` why ? ' . 
  she does an awful lot for an octogenarian , and as she does n't have a voice in government it 's a bit difficult to say you hate the queen in particular . 
  if you said you hated the fact that there 's a royal family that 's a different discussion . 
  also , if you said it * as an american * then most people would just ignore you . 
  american opinions on our royals do n't much matter to us . 
  the ending drove me nuts the first time , but i could see it on the second read-through . 
  [ after all , fitz ] ( #s `` gets all of his memories and emotions back that he 'd forged into girl-on-a-dragon '' ) so he regresses back into the man he was before verity 's quest , which was the man who was in love with molly . 
  and not only was he stunted by galen , he emotionally stunted himself by helping the fool with girl-on-a-dragon . 
  he basically spends the series as a partially forged hermit . 
  that 's not a small thing . 
  fun fact : there 's a village near me called fingringhoe . 
  and for all the american tourists out there : it 's edin - ** bruh ** not edin-boro . 
  i used to fence . 
  if anything , i know how supremely amazing fencer 's thighs and arms are . 
  * totally * not a turn off . 
  does may still count as recently ? 
  because i did an adults gymnastic competition for the first time in my life and i 'm still ridiculously proud about it . 
  * you * might not give two shits about the queen , but i 'd disagree with your sweeping generalisation that nobody does . 
  i do . 
  my family do . 
  a lot of my friends do . 
  quite a few people on this subreddit do . 
  just keep practising !, 
  i absolutely love the sport , but i have to make sure i keep going to training to keep the skills i learn , otherwise my body forgets them pretty quickly . 
  do plenty of post-workout stretching to keep yourself supple , too . 
  and do n't be afraid to try those new tricks all the fifteen year olds are doing !, 
  the fear is a big thing to get over , i find , but it 's totally worth it when you do . 
  they do here ( in the uk ) . 
  i go to two , one about twenty minutes away , the other about forty five minutes away , and they both have hour and a half long adult sessions . 
  they do have coaches around , but you do n't really get coached as such , it 's a lot of ` try this out and see if it works ' more than anything !, 
  have a look for adult gyms or open gyms around you - some are putting on freerunning and parkour nights too , and they 're just as good for going and playing around . 
  i 've just come back from a free running training night myself . 
  :d i think adult gyms are actually getting a lot more popular lately so hopefully there 's some classes started up near you . 
  can i ask where you 're based ? 
  i think the americans definitely struggle to put artistic merit into their routines - sure , they 're difficult , but they 're not particular beautiful . 
  my current favourite is catherine lyon 's [ latest floor routine ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8mrwpvih70 ) for gb . 
  her tumbles need more d score , but as far as artistic merit goes she gets it just right . 
  contemporary dance works so well for her and for gymnastics in general . 
  huh . 
  i 'm from the uk and i goddamn ** love ** the nhs . 
  i would never , ever give it up for a privatised system . 
  buying health insurance is an optional expense gives you extra benefits and slightly speedier service but it 'll never replace the core foundation of nhs support for me . 
  it 's in occasional bulletins on the televised news and reasonably large pieces on the independent and guardian websites . 
  i doubt many people are paying much attention to it other than `` oh , what are those daft americans doing again ? '', 
  edit : it 's part of the phone-in now on radio 2 saying ` what 's going on in america ? ', 
  so there is discussion about it . 
  i doubt it . 
  i could n't date a devoted christian ( not that you find a huge amount of them in my country anyway ) , and sex is a necessary part of a relationship for me . 
  it 's fun , it helps you bond , and it 's a totally natural thing for two people to want to do together . 
  you need to be sexually compatible to have a good marriage , in my opinion , and it does n't make sense to put it off just for the sense of ` morals ' when there 's absolutely nothing that loss of virginity actually changes . 
  they normally end up putting up the full nbc broadcast a few days afterwards . 
  the bbc also have full coverage online from thursday onwards . 
  i 'm in colchester and train at colchester and ipswich , so i 'm not totally au fait with london clubs , but i know that heathrow has a really good reputation . 
  i 've just had a quick look at the british gymnastics site and a google , and it looks like [ east london gymnastics ] ( http://www.eastlondongym.co.uk/about/gymnasticsadult ) is a really nice club that runs adult classes every night . 
  if you 're south of the river [ southwark gymnastics ] ( http://www.southwarkgymnastics.co.uk/#/adults-gymnastics/4548248588 ) has adult sessions three times a week , too .
