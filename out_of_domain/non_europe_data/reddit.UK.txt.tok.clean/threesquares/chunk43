  i just go with a heavy dose of ` sorry , excuse me , so sorry , i think you dropped this ? ', 
  it 's so rude . 
  twice now i 've been on multiple dates with guys and then they 've just stopped texting or getting in touch with no explanation . 
  its fine if you 've gone off me , just bloody tell me so !, 
  maybe its just london men , but it totally puts me off . 
  oh yes . 
  that sounds like an ideal man to me , too . 
  elegant , refined , well-styled , beautiful . 
  sooo right now a typical week kind of works like this for me . 
  i 'm 28 , english , live with my parents and have two paid jobs , one volunteer job and one lot of full time study just started up again for a second degree in history . 
  currently single , though i 'm dating and also currently quite frustrated with men generally . 
  is it just british men who are hopeless at dating ? 
  ** monday ** : up at 7.30 am , breakfast , shower , make a fuss of the dog , take the dog to work . 
  there until 5:00 , drive home ( 20 mins ) , scarf down some dinner and walk henry , then out again at 7:30 for gymnastics class until 9 . 
  home again , a cup of tea on the sofa for half an hour and study reading then bed . 
  ** tuesday ** : up at 6.30 , walk the dog for half an hour then changed , breakfast and out to work . 
  tuesdays are a day i now spend volunteering in the history department of a local secondary school to gain experience for the teacher training i want to do . 
  i observe and assist in a few classes , help out with prep work and generally make myself useful . 
  home usually for about 5 , walk the dog again , dinner and a quiet night with the parents watching great british bake off or something on the tv . 
  ** wednesday ** : same work routine as monday , except this time when the office closes i go and grab myself a microwave meal for dinner because i 'll be staying there until just before 7 , probably using the time to study . 
  then i feed henry and take him down the road to our weekly 45 minute ringcraft class where we learn the ins and outs of dog shows and how to do them properly . 
  it 's a simple class but i love it and there 's loads of gorgeous dogs around for him to socialise with . 
  finish there at 8 , home again for a cup of tea , tv and bed . 
  ** thursday ** : usual work routine . 
  home for 5.30 ish , dinner , feed henry . 
  get changed into gym stuff and then drive 45 minutes into the next county for another gymnastics class if i 'm not too tired from work . 
  home again about 10.30 pm and straight to bed !, 
  ** friday ** : usual work routine . 
  i finish at 4:30 on fridays so i 'm normally home for 5-ish . 
  gulp down a simple dinner , normally pasta or something , then get changed into second job uniform . 
  this one 's at a pub , so i start at 7:00 and normally finish about 12:30 am . 
  if i 'm really lucky it 'll be an early night and home more like 11:00 , but that 's not that often . 
  ** saturday ** : sleep in until 9 or 10am , then drag myself into the shower , get dressed and go down for breakfast . 
  if there 's anything i want to do or buy in town then i 'll drive in , which is about a 20 minute trip and spend the morning doing that . 
  otherwise i 'll sit down and study for most of my saturdays if i 've not arranged anything social . 
  out to the pub again for a shift starting at 7:00 pm , home for 12:30 am and sleep . 
  ** sunday ** : lie in until 9 or 10 . 
  up sloooooowly . 
  sundays are a lazy day for me and i try not to leave the house if i can possibly help it . 
  i 'll do chores like hoovering and cleaning and at some point my parents and i will normally sit down together for a sunday dinner with roast , vegetables and a dessert like apricot crumble or plum charlotte . 
  i 'll do a couple of hours study in the afternoon , or walk henry or go see family . 
  sunday evenings are always quiet ones , and i 'll either sit with dad and watch top gear or sit with mum and watch downton abbey . 
  early night , to start all over again !, 
  one or two weekends a month are quite different because i 'll be out doing a dog show . 
  those days look more like this :, 
  ** dog show eve ** : trim and bath henry so he looks clean again and groomed how he should be . 
  put together show bag of brushes , leads , map , directions , water bottle , picnic lunch , scissors , blankets , dog crate and other paraphanelia . 
  set out show outfit for myself , set alarm . 
  early night . 
  ** dog show day ** : up about 3:30 am/4am sometimes . 
  big cup of tea , breakfast . 
  put henry in the car , get on the road . 
  we aim to be there for about 8am as most start at 9 . 
  find the showground , unpack everything including dog , go find the ring we 're in and either bench him or put him in his crate so he stays tidy . 
  buy catalogue . 
  wait until our class , go enter , get placed ( or not ! ) . 
  normally done by midday but we 'll watch some other classes to see how everyone else is being placed . 
  grab some lunch , re-pack everything up and drive home . 
  home for about 3/4pm i guess , unpack and then spend the rest of the evening doing precisely bugger all . 
  mostly i motivate myself just by doing what i want , i guess !, 
  the pub is more of a chore to go to , especially on friday nights when i would rather go do gymnastics instead but have to go earn extra money . 
  i feel out of touch with friends sometimes , who mostly live in london , and i never have money spare at the end of the month even though i try really hard to budget . 
  being single drives me mad sometimes , though i enjoy the freedom of it , and being so dislocated from my friends is also frustrating . 
  on the plus side i do feel like i 'm working towards what i want , and i do get to do what i want a lot of the time like gymnastics and dog shows . 
  within the next two years i 'd like to be heading towards a teaching qualification , have moved back into my own place and ideally be in a long term relationship . 
  i feel like i 'm at least in a good chance for two out of three !, 
  honestly it really is an instinct thing !, 
  you 'll be fine - practice makes perfect after all !, 
  both of you will probably be moving your mouths rather than just having them open or closed - my proper kisses kind of go open mouth/pursed lips/open mouth/pursed lips ( only more relaxed than that , not like fishy face pursed ! ), 
  restrain yourself from too much tongue , do n't stick it all in there at once , and it 's okay to draw back every so often and just swallow or take a breath if you like . 
  i like to vary the pressure a lot and i 'm quite a tease when i kiss to be honest , but you 'll figure out what style suits you best . 
  i move my hands around , generally - i 'll use the back of my hand to stroke his cheek or run through his hair or drift down his back , or tug him closer to me if i want extra pressure . 
  just go with it - honestly , it 's a hard thing to explain because it is just so instinctual . 
  i hope you have a lot of fun with it , though !, 
  it does n't need to be a movie scene - it just needs to be you and her and something cute like flowers . 
  relax . 
  `` uh ... thanks ? '', 
  really i would have given her a confused look and just kept walking . 
  what a weird thing to say to someone . 
  hair removal cream sorts it nicely for me . 
  i had to try a few varieties because my skin is quite sensitive and nair ends up burning , but boots own brand hair removal cream is a saviour . 
  smear it on , wait five minutes , scrape it off , done !, 
  i always use celsius whatever the season . 
  my parents use farenheit . 
  it 's definitely a generational thing . 
  my friends are bloody awful at replying to calls or text messages . 
  or even answering their phones . 
  all i hear is `` call me , we need to catch up ! '', 
  and then i do and they ** never pick up ** . 
  drives me round the fucking bend . 
  my mum is also the queen of advice . 
  even when you do n't need it , ask for it or require any part of it . 
  she will suggest how you should spend your day . 
  when i should text my friends . 
  * what * i should text my friends . 
  what i should do at work . 
  if i have something to work on , you just * know * mum will be right there to give me all of the advice i could ever possibly need on how it should be done . 
  i love her but oh my ** god ** stop telling me things all the fucking time . 
  arrrghhhhh open mouth eating !, 
  it 's just the most horrible thing in the world !,
