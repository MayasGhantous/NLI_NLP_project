  how everyone else does at homework , in exams , things like that . 
  you need to either meet or surpass the standard of work . 
  once you get into that frame of mind it 's so easy to apply it to other things - everyone else has a boyfriend/engagement/amazing job/new house/baby/cool car/ipad , why do n't i ? 
  i think we need to find a way of drawing that distinction between attaining averages as we 're growing , and then finding what suits each of us when we 're grown . 
  easier said than done !, 
  favourite duo by far !, 
  you tend to see them at country shows and large dog shows , mostly . 
  i do n't normally just see them dawdling around cities or anything . 
  what actually counts as ` good ' tea for you ? 
  i 'm confused if you 're finding darjeeling too strong , but it 's quite a smoky taste which does n't suit everyone . 
  twinings every day blend is probably a little lighter on the palate if that 's what you 're looking for , or some twinings earl grey . 
  i find clipper tea a little too malty for my taste but it 's worth a try . 
   i 've never had earl grey with milk before . 
  would n't it curdle if i added milk because of the citrus ? 
  nope , not at all . 
  i always drink my earl grey with milk . 
  if you 're looking for a true black version , twinings also do a lemon grey and sunshine grey which are designed to be drunk without milk . 
   no one really drinks twinings other than on the odd occasion which is why it 's not abundant . 
  my family and i * always * drink twinings . 
  i much prefer it to any other brand . 
  yeah pg tips only needs like 30 seconds to get a good flavour . 
  other flavours like darjeeling and earl grey need the 2-3 mins brewing time . 
  we bulk buy tea over here - honestly , the stereotype about how much brits drink tea is pretty much fact . 
  do n't be put off by it being cheap , it 's only because the supermarkets buy in so much of it . 
  not just rumour - hobb confirmed it a week or so ago that the first in her new fitz & fool trilogy is going to be released next august . 
  very exciting !, 
  i have a sixteen month old [ english setter called henry ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wm7iemx.jpg ) who is both a complete terror and the light of my life . 
  we show him and have qualified him for next year 's crufts , which is exciting !, 
  the chance of him getting there in one piece is looking a bit fraught at the moment , though - right now he 's developed a bit of a thing about eating kindles ... 
  personally , i do . 
  i have bad skin , have done ever since i was a teenager , and i 'm really very self conscious over it . 
  makeup helps cover up any lingering red spots that my medication has n't caught , helps smooth my skin out and brighten eveything up . 
  i look better with makeup on , simple fact . 
  but i still put makeup on in the morning for * me * , not for any guys walking down the street ,, 
  went on four dates with a lovely guy who i was really really interested in - interested enough to take my profile off of okc . 
  he then did the fade out for no apparent reason and stopped texting me . 
  after a week i did n't much care but would have responded to whatever he might have decided to text . 
  after two weeks i went ` fuck it ' and ca n't be bothered with him any more . 
  his loss . 
  so , for a guy i 'm really really into , two weeks . 
  for someone i 'm not too bothered about , probably a third of that . 
  at the most . 
  if he tried again in the future i would laugh and block his messages . 
  robin hobb 's books can keep you going for quite a long time if you find they agree with you but they all work independently of each other to keep things short too . 
  currently she 's got three trilogies ( farseer , liveship traders and tawny man ) and one quadrilogy ( river wild chronicles ) set in one universe with another one due to be released next august ( the fool 's assassin ) and one more trilogy ( soldier 's son ) set in a different world . 
  i 'd recommend starting with assassins apprentice and going on from there . 
  i also love naomi novik 's * temeraire * series for short , fun , historical fantasy books . 
  napoleonic armies of dragons are a great idea and i tore through them pretty quickly . 
  sounds like you 've got quite a good reading list so far !, 
  oh thanks !, 
  i loved temeraire , so i 'll definitely be looking those up . 
  i ca n't get to many general parties or gatherings to meet people because of the workload i have right now , and the fact that most of my friends who might introduce me to potential single men either live in london , scotland or are actors on tour . 
  so online dating works really well for me . 
  i 've not met a special someone yet but i 've had a few fun dates and a few rejections . 
  it * does * work but it does take a lot of effort to get dates set up , and sometimes i just ca n't be arsed . 
  i 'm not sure if you 've noticed , but women are * far * more judgey than men . 
  if i go out wearing a tight red slinky top with a high neck , men might go `` ooh tight . 
  shows off her boobs a lot . 
  nice . '', 
  women will look at me and go '' * why * is she wearing that neck ? 
  it 's far too high for her . 
  red 's a nice colour . 
  too tight , though . 
  she needs a haircut . 
  i like her shoes . '', 
  of course , that 's all just a one-second mental process , but i know if i walk out the door wearing an outfit that does n't work for me , other women will notice . 
  and they * will * judge me . 
  i never think about whether a man finds me attractive or not . 
  i could n't actually care less whether that man finds me attractive . 
  i ** do ** think about whether that girl over there thinks this barbour jacket makes me look like a scruffy yokel or a cool country chic lady . 
  so i dress for that girl . 
  leg stroking i guess is just an automatic comfort mechanism . 
  edit : i do also love clothes and dress to feel good . 
  because i like fashion . 
  but i 'm constantly thinking about what other girls think of my outfit at the same time . 
  i think that 's a great attitude to have . 
   live it up , travel and go where you can while you 're able !, 
  like you said , if things do n't work out you can always just nip back over the channel . 
  hope things work out for you over here . 
  cambridge and oxford are beautiful cities and you can get to them pretty easily by train . 
  very historic , architecturally lovely and you 're able to wander around the various colleges for a small entrance fee . 
  i get along with my younger brother and i like his company , but we 're not really that close . 
  i can see that he 's a cool guy with his life together but we 're really very different people . 
  he still knows how to wind me up something chronic , too . 
  i have an overactive imagination . 
  psychological horror freaks me the fuck out , and i refuse to watch it because i ca n't stand the thought of dreaming about people stalking me and doing gory things for days on end . 
  i used to work in theatre and film , i know exactly how this stuff is staged , but when i watch a film i do n't think about the camera shots and wardrobe choices and mixture of fake blood that the props team used . 
  i think about how that ghost/stranger/psychopath is dismembering that character and all the screaming . 
  and then i walk out the room and go watch downton abbey instead . 
  some people are just pushy . 
  really , really pushy , and they do n't like taking no for an answer . 
  as women we 're also socially conditioned not to be rude and turn people down . 
  it gets all mixed up into some complicated situations and i absolutely sympathise with just how awkward you end up feeling . 
  however , you do * have * to just stick with your no . 
  not wanting to date is more than fine . 
  turning it down politely is fine . 
  getting rude when they keep asking is ** also fine ** . 
  if you lack tact about saying no , then when they 're getting pushy like that guy did , do n't try and be dignified . 
  do n't try and be graceful . 
  just say `` no thank you , i am not interested . '',
