  oh everything generic , i suppose . 
  work , family , friends , hobbies , books , films , pets . 
  never politics or religion , never anything too ` deep ' , and never exes . 
  ummm it depends . 
  i used to do the ` fade away ' but now i 've decided that 's just rude , so i 'll text them saying `` thanks for a lovely night , would like to see you again as a friend . 
  is that okay ? '', 
  because what does n't work for me might work for someone else . 
  even if i did tell them `` you 're just too bulky for me '' or whatever , and they then went away and lost weight i still would n't be interested . 
  i 'd rejected them , we 're done , i do n't go back for seconds . 
  but another person might find their bulkiness the hottest thing ever . 
  so what was the point in me giving them advice on what did n't work for me when they 're not going to end up with me anyway ? 
  sometimes my advice might just be callous , and i do n't want to say it . 
  i stopped seeing a guy for two reasons ; one was because i did n't like the way he 'd decorated his flat ( so much beige ) , and the other was because he made a stupid noise when we kissed . 
  but what am i actually going to say ? 
  go spend a couple of hundred pounds on repainting your flat that 's your pride and joy , and by the way you make weird smacking noises so i do n't really want to date you anyway ? 
  that 's just mean , and i do n't do that . 
  i just said i 'd rather stay as friends , and good luck with your other future dates . 
  after all , some other lady might see lots-of-beige-flat as a decorating project for the future . 
  just not me . 
  if a guy is going to sit there for months on end frantically trying to work out the one single reason why i broke up with him and being ` crushed ' by that , then we would n't have worked out anyway . 
  when i get dumped , i spend like two days going over our dates , maybe pinpointing where i went wrong , make a small mental note for the future not to do that again and get on with my life . 
  any adult in the dating game should be able to do the same . 
  i 'm used to bringing my dog into work with me and having him around a lot of the time to keep an eye on him , so if i need to leave him at home for whatever reason i start worrying about all of the ways he could potentially have hurt himself while i 'm not there . 
  i know he 's absolutely fine , but it does n't stop me worrying . 
  sales for my dad 's telecoms company : fine . 
  it 's a job , it 's pretty easy and low on stress , it 's massively flexible . 
  i 'm not a sales driven person though , and i 'm on minimum wage . 
  weekend bar job : i like it for the social aspect , and i just do one day a week so i quite enjoy my shifts . 
  all the rest of my bar team are great and i have a good laugh even if the drunks can be irritating . 
  teaching assistant : i do a day a week volunteering in the history department at a local secondary school for teaching experience and love it . 
  it 's so much fun and i really enjoy working with the kids and getting to be creative all the time . 
  it 's really confirming that teaching is what i want to go on and do . 
  my favourite job during the week for sure . 
  probably pretty awful , which is exactly why i did n't tell him that , and why we 're not in contact now . 
  he 's a really lovely guy , i just did n't fancy him , and the flat and kissing noises confirmed it . 
  but that 's * my * feelings about him , not every woman 's opinion . 
  we went on three dates . 
  `` me or the beige '' is the most stupid ultimatum ever to give to a guy who i just did not fancy . 
  there was never going to be a relationship to ` throw away ' because we went on * three * dates . 
  i did n't give him reasons because they were mean reasons to give . 
  `` i 'd rather stay friends '' is really all that ever needs to be said . 
  put plug in bath, 
  run hot water, 
  take bottle of bubble bath . 
  undo the cap . 
  pour approx 1/3 of bubble bath under the running water . 
  swish it about a bit . 
  switch off taps when bath level is appropriate to your luxuriating requirements . 
  climb in bath . 
  win . 
  i tend to put scotland when sending post to my scottish relatives but it does n't actually matter . 
  it 'll still get there , whether you opt for england , scotland , wales , great britain , british isles or united kingdom . 
  i doubt they 'll actually notice which one you put ( unless you say a scottish address is in england , of course ) . 
  the most important piece of information on any envelope is the postcode . 
  i never learnt a single thing about it at school , and as far as i can tell students nowadays do n't learn about it either . 
  to be honest , it does n't actually matter to us at all . 
  we focus more on the last two thousand years generally , and then ww1/ww2/cold war in gcse and a-level studies . 
  eh , it comes and it goes . 
  a good friend of mine announced their engagement this morning ( bleugh ) , another announced it last week , two others have had babies in the last month , and i 'm still 28 and resolutely single . 
  mostly i just try and keep myself busy , and have a quick glance through okcupid or do something else datingly proactive to at least * pretend * like i 'm doing something . 
  i also make myself stay off of facebook for the next twelve hours or so , so that i do n't drown myself in self pity . 
  it 's the absolute worst for rubbing salt into the wound . 
  ** the uk ** : yes , we do drink as much tea as you expect . 
  probably more . 
  also , ** england ** : more than just london . 
  henry viii . 
  we 're still seeing his legacy and the reformation today in the uk , and his whole life is just fascinating . 
  he was ` the most handsome prince in christendom ' when he was younger , brilliant on the tiltyard and at all kinds of sports . 
  plus , of course , his private life is fascinating . 
  he spent the most * enormous * amounts of money on his courts and built beautiful buildings and palaces to live in , some of which we only have the vaguest ideas about . 
  definitely one of my favourites . 
  every six to eight weeks . 
  i have reasonably short hair so need more frequent trims to keep it in shape . 
  plus , going to the hairdressers is one of my favourite things . 
  harry potter and the philosophers stone . 
  definitely a christmas movie . 
  oooh have you got a link ? 
  that sounds so cute !, 
  depends on the conversation , i suppose . 
  i 'm probably upper middle class , but i ca n't see why i 'd be shy about saying it . 
  i did n't this year , for no particular reason other than i just did n't buy one . 
  i want to be a history teacher , so i figure i 'll be thinking and talking about the wars a * lot * in years to come , not just on one day . 
  nine days , 
  [ me in my favourite pirate dress ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vmsqzth.jpg ), 
  my hair 's a bit longer now , but i really like that pic . 
  oooh you are lovely !, 
  why so far away ? 
  aw you 're cute !, 
  you 've got the derren brown laser eyes going on for sure . 
  * hello * shoulders . 
  no need to be brave , you 're lovely !, 
  hello . 
  you 're all kinds of stunning . 
  me too !, 
  it 's got boning in , so it allllways makes my waist look fabulous . 
  he 's an amazing showman . 
  there 's loads of his full shows on youtube , definitely give them a go . 
  svengali is my personal favourite . 
  you know , whoever took that glamour shot - get them to take more . 
  and then send them to me .
