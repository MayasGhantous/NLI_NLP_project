  today is a good day on / r/askwomen . 
  action/adventure movies !, 
  inception is my faaaavourite . 
  that and casino royale . 
  i know right ? 
  i feel fourteen all over again whenever i look at a hiddles picture . 
  or video . 
  or interview . 
  or movie . 
  for the fifth time ... 
  absolutely . 
  just look at lenny kravitz in the hunger games , or johnny depp and his beautiful , beautiful eyeliner . 
  or , visual evidence : [ sam claflin shirtless in catching fire ] ( http://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/finnickcover.jpg ) . 
  at the very least , i 'd say he 's got on powder , blusher , a light eyelid primer/shadow , maybe some mascara and some kind of lip tint as his mouth is quite rosy . 
  ( unf ) . 
  plus an all over spray tan , of course , and groomed eyebrows . 
  and he looks * stunning * . 
  aw , thank you for saying thank you . 
  ( : that 's really nice to hear . 
  hope you stick around !, 
  wow . 
  you are way overthinking this . 
  like , stratospheric level overthinking this . 
  dating is not just about ` passing on your genes ' and ` getting to the top of the game ' ( whatever that means ) , it 's about finding a companion to share things with and to go through life with . 
  you clearly crave all of that , but apparently actually getting what you want is somewhat below you . 
  talk about cutting your nose to spite your face . 
  to be honest , reading your post i do n't even know what you want . 
  do you want a girlfriend ? 
  or do you want to be single ? 
  either one is fine , but if you want a girlfriend you have to put in effort to get one . 
  you sound almost like you just want a girl to turn up on your doorstep , think you 're perfect just as you are and run off into the sunset with you . 
  not going to happen . 
  honestly , you do n't have to go to bars to find ladies to date and use smooth chat up lines to attract people . 
  i 'm a lady , i dislike bars and i will flat out laugh at you if you use a chat up line on me . 
  but i also know that i 'm single , would like a boyfriend and have a somewhat far flung friendship circle , so i date . 
  i go on okcupid , i go on mysinglefriend.com or guardian soulmates or whoever else , to give me the widest chance of finding a nice man . 
  and yes , i make myself look attractive . 
  sometimes i talk to cute random guys . 
  sometimes , heaven forbid , i even go on dates . 
  for * fun * . 
  also , just so you know , confidence is * sexy * . 
  why do you think there are so many photos of tom hiddleston et al. 
  on / r/ladyboners ? 
  because men like him are * confident * . 
  we want to date them . 
  we want to be around them . 
  i * want * to be impressed by a confident , self assured man who knows what he wants out of life and who is also genuine , honest and thoughtful of others . 
  i do n't expect a confident man to be an expert on anything except himself . 
  and yes , you ` fake it until you make it ' not because you 're trying to trick someone else , but because you 're trying to trick * yourself * into that self assurance that is so goddamn sexy . 
  it 's not selfishness when you 're aiming to improve * yourself * . 
  look , dude , just chill out . 
  stop overthinking this . 
  you 're not any more self sacrificing than anyone else by deciding that being confident and trying to go on dates is somehow selfish and awful . 
  you want a girlfriend ? 
  go on dates . 
  you do n't want kids but you still want a partner ? 
  ** go on dates ** . 
  the only person you 're hurting with all of this over the top self introspection is yourself . 
  get over it . 
  who 's that first picture of ? 
  he is ** gorgeous ** . 
  that as trueblood englishmen , we sit around drinking tea all day . 
  totally not true . 
  sometimes we drink coffee . 
  i 've got pale skin , short and naturally very dark hair , and blue/green eyes . 
  red , purples , creams , deep greens and navys suit me best . 
  basically , jewel tones . 
  i wear a lot of cream jumpers lately and seem to wear mostly dark green jackets and coats . 
  my favourite dress is emerald green and in the winter i have a * lot * of red clothes . 
  i tend to accessorise with reds and whites , and gold jewellery suits me best . 
  i used to think silver looked better - actually now i know that gold warms my skin properly and i 'll opt for that or brassy tones in necklaces and earrings . 
  yellow , orange and any shade of grey look awful on me and so do the paler greens and most pastel colours . 
  ** warbreaker ** by brandon sanderson . 
  definitely one of those ` ca n't put it down must spend afternoon reading not working ' books . 
  also , ** alloy of law ** is brilliant and i loved every bit of it . 
  ** loki ** by mike vasich is also dark and thrilling and amazing and i 'm still churning it over in my head now . 
  it 's mythological fantasy , based on the norse myths with loki as the main focal point . 
  i did get it after going to see thor 2 at the cinema and wanting to find out more mythology , and it was just everything i 'd hoped for . 
  see i do get it , it * is * totally a trivial thing , but if your girlfriend has asked you to do it , i suspect it would probably hurt her feelings if you flat out refuse for no other reason than , basically , ' i do n't want to ' . 
  you can change it just to ` being in a relationship ' without tagging her , which would probably satisfy her without giving the information away for you about who exactly you 're seeing . 
  i take the view that you 'd tell people who asked you in person that you were in a relationship , right ? 
  facebook is just an extension of that . 
  sure , the drama involved around it can be petty , but if your girlfriend has actually asked you to do it , i bet it means a lot to her . 
  do n't make this the hill you want to die on - it 's really not worth it . 
  well , i mean you can change the slightly smelly bit pretty easily - i 'm not sure why you would n't want to change that anyway . 
  and the unemployed part might take some work but you can fix that , too . 
  everything else is just horses for courses - it sounds like you 've got a quirky kind of self confidence which is half the battle to meeting romantic partners . 
  can i ask why you think you come across as creepy or approach people in the wrong way ?
