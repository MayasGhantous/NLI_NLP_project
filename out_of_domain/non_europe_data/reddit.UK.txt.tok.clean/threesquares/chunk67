  a short break to get your feelings about sex sounds healthy , but i do feel like you need to do something proactive and tangible about it in the meantime . 
  see a counsellor or a therapist . 
  show your boyfriend you 're actually working through it instead of just sitting on it . 
  i 'm sure he 'd be much more receptive about it in that way . 
  as concerned as you are , it 's really none of your business . 
  they 're both in different countries . 
  to be absolutely honest , you do n't really * know * this girl , you just know the persona that she puts across online . 
  what makes her online relationship more ` real ' that the actual physical one she had at school ? 
  just back off , leave it alone and keep your nose out of it . 
  `` have you taken your pill yet ? '', 
  it goes off at 9.30 am , rings every two minutes and is a total lifesaver . 
  i would be so all over the place with pill-taking if i did n't have it set . 
  i have a couple of friends who i definitely think `` why on earth am i friends with them ? '', 
  one in particular has been pissing me off something chronic lately by ** never ** answering any messages i leave her . 
  pocahontas . 
  ` just around the riverbend ' describes me to a tee . 
  i think you can have any reasons to move anywhere you like , but you also need to be practical about getting there ( visas and whatnot ) , what you 'll do long term , and what the country is actually like . 
  having the opportunity to go to uni over here will definitely give you that . 
  you just need to bear in mind that you might be following after your family history , but you wo n't be living like they did , or probably in any area that they would now recognise . 
  be realistic about what derby ( or the uk as a whole ) can actually offer you and what your day to day living will really be like , and you 'll be fine . 
  * baking . 
  i made some great biscuits the other day and mixed up different flavoured icing for all of them . 
  yum !, 
  * pub quizzes and trivial pursuit . 
  i rock at general knowledge , especially with history questions . 
  * dog showing . 
  it 's an unusual hobby , but i think i 'm pretty good at it . 
  she has n't helped her case by drip feeding you things when you specifically asked her to be truthful from the start . 
  it 's obviously making you unhappy and paranoid , and that 's not fair . 
  she should not have lied , and she should n't continue lying . 
  * however *, 
  it was , i 'm afraid to say , totally unrealistic for you to expect that your first girlfriend would also have been someone who had also never done anything before . 
  most teenagers lose their virginity around age 16 if i remember right ( i 'm in britain , so it might be different elsewhere ) , so by the time she 's 19 it would be more than likely that she 'd had other boyfriends . 
  as you also went into it knowing that she 'd already had a boyfriend , i 'm amazed that you were so shocked that , surprise surprise , she was sexually active . 
  i also do n't get understand your feeling that you 've somehow missed out on a first relationship . 
  ** this ** is your first relationship . 
  this is the special time . 
  just because your expectations ( virgin girlfriend ) does n't match up with reality ( experienced girlfriend ) does n't make your relationship any less unique . 
  doing things with a new partner is always special , no matter whether you 've done it before or not , because the circumstances that you 're doing it under are different . 
  you are not the same man as her ex . 
  she is not the same person as her ex dated . 
  of course it 's special , it 's still the most intimate thing you can do with someone . 
  is ice cream on a hot day any less amazing just because you 've had an ice cream cone before ? 
  is the sex you had this summer any less special than the sex you had last winter ? 
   its gotten to the point where things i want to try ( public sex ) she will not do . 
  she says things like `` i 've done it once and i 'm not risking it again '' . 
  this , by the way , is * completely fair * . 
  she 's tried something , she does n't like it , do n't push it . 
  just because you 've never done something and want to do it does not overrule her comfort level . 
  maybe you 'll get a new girlfriend at some point who wants to try outdoor sex . 
  this is not the one , and that is fine . 
  she does not have to do everything just because you want to do it . 
  ( fwiw , i 'm not a dude . ), 
  yeah ... i think there 's lots of different things going on here . 
  religion , in my view , is going to give you a totally skewed view on relationships and sex in general . 
  other people can give you more input on that , but i do think you need to reassess what views you really hold where sex , virginity and relationships come into it . 
  you clearly went into this relationship with your fingers stuck in your ears , telling yourself she had to be the good virgin girl you thought she was , because that 's what you wanted to hear . 
  as you get older , you 're probably not going to date good virgin christian girls , and you need to be okay with that . 
  the number of partners a woman has had does n't matter , and a conversation before you date about her ` number ' probably wo n't go down well . 
  she 's allowed to say that she does n't want to do something sexual in any tone that she likes . 
  if i do n't want to have sex in public , i 'm not going to start crying about it , i 'm just going to say `` hey bf , i 'm not cool with that . 
  let 's do something else sexy , okay ? '', 
  because it 's not a big deal . 
  it 's something i do n't want to do . 
  like eating brussel sprouts . 
  saying all that , the thing about her just randomly breaking off and telling you and the stuff she and her ex did , and the fact that he could n't finish ? 
  yeah , that 's weird . 
  really weird , and not normal for any relationship , especially one that 's been going on for three years . 
  does she often say stuff like that ? 
  i have a feeling you 're not exactly dating the most stable of girls , and i 'd maybe start having a look again at where this is going . 
  i 'd be majorly pissed off if my partner dropped in something randomly about their ex , especially when i 've whisked them away on a romantic holiday . 
  i 'd take that as a `` he 's just not that into you '' in the nicest kind of way . 
  i doubt he 's playing a game , but maybe just back off for a while and then invite him somewhere else in a few weeks time , maybe if you 're going out with a group of friends . 
  if he does n't want to date right now , then take him at his word . 
  does n't mean you ca n't stay in contact and see what happens in the future , though . 
  yeah , i 've kissed a few female friends before . 
  it 's really not a big deal . 
  i do n't do it now because i 've not met a woman who i fancied lately . 
  eh , depends . 
  today is an average day at the office , so from jumping in the shower to pulling on my boots was about half an hour . 
  that included :, 
  shower , wash hair , apply hair heat protection serum , dry hair ( using two different methods ) , moisturise face , prime face , straighten hair , antiperspirant , get dressed , brush on mineral foundation , make up eyes , move stuff i need from last night 's going out bag to today 's office bag , check socks match , go downstairs . 
  if i 'm doing a full going out glam thing , then there 'll be an extra half hour to an hour added on that for shaving in the shower , more makeup stuff and some accessorising . 
  confession time : i am * so lazy * about my eyebrows . 
  especially now i 've grown in a fringe again so they 're covered up most of the time . 
  i tweeze about once a week now , and even that is only a ` holy shit , have they grown * that much * ?! ', 
  deal . 
  never . 
  i have a couple of friends who do that , but song lyrics mean sod all to me . 
  it 's just another way to be vague and ` deep ' , and i do n't really have time for that . 
  if you 're out doing exercise and enjoying it , more power to you !, 
  i 'm not fussed about who turns up to the classes i go to , and it was always cool to see a guy enjoy pilates or yoga . 
  as long as you 're not creeping , or there solely to stare at women in lycra it 's all good . 
  conformation shows , and we 've qualified our english setter for crufts , which is exciting !, 
  i 've never done obedience or rally , but then again i 've always owned setters who are n't exactly known for doing what you tell them , when you want them to do it . 
   what breeds did you used to work with ? 
  they looked back . 
  dark yawned the archway and of the gates underneath the mountain-shadow . 
  faint and far beneath the earth rolled the slow drum-beats : * doom * . 
  a thin black smoke trailed out .
