  you probably ca n't comprehend it because , to be honest , it sounds like you 've never done it . 
  and that 's fine . 
  but it does n't mean that it 's not possible and that your ex feels the same way about sex . 
  when you masturbate , do you think about your ex * every single time * ? 
  is she the only girl you ever fantasise over , or do you think of other women too ? 
  if you think of other women , and just think of them as sexual people , then there 's your answer . 
  you 're not in love with them , but the appeal of doing sexy things with them is still there . 
  it 's just taking it much , much further . 
  seconding the mistborn recommendation , vin is an awesome female lead . 
  brandon sanderson is an amazing author , too . 
  trudi canavan has written an excellent series called * the black magician trilogy * with a strong female protagonist , sonea . 
  robin hobb is also * amazing * for strong female characters . 
  the * liveship traders * books has some great ones in , and though the * farseer * and * tawny man * trilogies have male leads in fitzchivalry farseer , the women of her world kick some serious arse . 
  she was * lonely * . 
  she told op herself , she was lonely and wanted companionship , and missed their connection . 
  she had been given a big okay sign by her ex to go and sleep with other people . 
  for all she knew , he was doing the same thing . 
  how could she be psychic enough to tell that op would have a hard time actually accepting what they had agreed would be okay to go and do ? 
  she needed company and a warm body ; she went and found it . 
  it 's not a bad judgement . 
  absolutely it 's not the same thing , but it 's * part * of the same thing , and you just gave yourself the answer anyway . 
  to feel better momentarily . 
  that 's all she was doing . 
  she just did it with a whole other person . 
  honestly , i think you making this quest to understand her motivations is n't doing you any favours . 
  you just have to accept that she * did * , it did n't work for her , and that was that . 
  trying to dig into her psyche does n't change anything . 
  beating yourself up about the fact that she could do something you could n't - sleep with someone else - does n't change anything . 
  just let it go , and work on the reasons why you broke up in the first place , not on the things that have happened since . 
  glad you 're liking farseer !, 
  definitely go on and read * liveships * and then * tawny man * after that - the fool is my all time favourite character in any fiction , and it 's all down to * tawny man * . 
  it 's a brilliant series , and i ca n't wait for hobb 's fitz and fool sequel this year tooooo . 
  if you loved mistborn , absolutely pick up the rest of brandon sanderson 's books , because he 's just getting better and better . 
  * alloy of law * is one of the first sequels after * mistborn * and his lead characters , wax and wayne , are hilarious . 
  it 's set more in a wild west kind of world , but that 's sanderson 's intentions . 
  also have a go at his * stormlight * series , but it 's quite a lot more actiony and battle-focused than mistborn is . 
  sanderson 's building what he calls a cosmere , which means a lot of his books are actually all in the same universe and interlinked in certain ways . 
  / r/fantasy will be able to explain it better than i can !, 
  the * lies of locke lamora * is wonderful and really character driven . 
  i also like karen miller 's * innocent mage * series , but it 's a little bit of an easier read . 
  do n't forget * the hobbit * and * lord of the rings * too , of course !, 
  oh , and terry 's pratchett 's * discworld * series !, 
  * guards guards * and * nightwatch * are two of my favourites from all of his books . 
  ummmmmmmmmmmm i think that should keep you going for a while yet , right ? 
  it is * so * rad . 
  also , * tawny man * . 
  also , the fool . 
  also , ** new book this year omfg ** . 
  travel !, 
  do as much travelling as you can while you have the time !, 
  do n't stress if you do n't know what you want to do for the rest of your life - i trained in one thing at age 21 , and now i 'm retraining to do something totally different at 28 . 
  it 's cool . 
  my mum switched careers entirely , from marketing to social work , in her fifties . 
  be adventurous . 
  do n't worry about settling down if you do n't really want to , and do n't let your peers stress you out if you 're not keeping up with the joneses re ; marriage , houses and babies . 
  everyone does everything at their own time . 
  try not to get into debt , but if you do , be sensible and steady about paying it back . 
  relax !, 
  have fun . 
  meet people !, 
  be nice to everyone . 
  network network network . 
  have some early nights sometimes . 
  have stupidly stupidly ridiculous late nights other times . 
  ** say yes to as many invitations as you can , because you 'll never know what awesome people you might meet . 
  if you like deep characters and gritty circumstances , robin hobb 's * farseer * trilogy might well be right up your street . 
  she does n't shy away from putting her characters through the mill sometimes . 
  it 's a male protagonist , but there are lots of really strong female characters involved in the wider world . 
  * lies of locke lamora * is also quite , quite excellent . 
  i 'm 28 , and look 23-ish ? 
  i mean , this is me , for reference , except my hair is a little longer now . 
  i definitely appreciate it when people do n't believe my real age , it 's great !, 
  long may it continue !, 
  not my problem . 
  no one cares if i do or do n't go on dates , why should i care if some other guy does n't go on , or ca n't get dates either ? 
  it 's his issues , he can deal with it , same as me . 
  edit to your edit : do you know why there are a lot of ` no one cares ' answers ? 
  because genuinely * this is not an issue * . 
  you will not get pennies in your charity tin about this . 
  there will be no newspaper inches dedicated to the subject . 
  it is the responsibility of precisely * nobody * to change the world so that some poor doofus gets his end in . 
  really . 
  it 's the unspoken rule of ladyhood - always carry a sock measurer around in your handbag . 
  you never know what vague measurements to discern the size of a man 's tool you may need . 
  if you 're * really * lucky , you can find those new thumb-measuring sticks disgused as lip balm to give you an extra heads-up , too . 
  right now because it 's winter i live in my [ ariat windermere country boots ] ( http://www.bowlandoutdoors.com/outdoor-clothing-store/ariat-windermere-boots-sage.jpg ) because they are amazing and warm and comfy and i love them . 
  and they look fucking awesome with skinny jeans and a woolly jumper . 
  aries . 
  i 'm pretty arian , even though i do n't really believe in astrology , even though i * sort * of do . 
  i do n't know . 
  me and astrology , we 're confused right now . 
  anyway , yes , i 'm a pretty straightforward arian . 
  i 'm impulsive , impatient , adventurous and i 'm really really good at starting things and never finishing them . 
  i went to a party last week an hour away in london where there were 150 people ( ish ) , i only knew one of them , and i made some great new friends in a few hours , one of which might be a potential work lead in the future . 
  which is a pretty aries thing to do , really . 
  yup !, 
  super shirt-button popping powers !, 
  super why-are-all-the-tops-in-shops-high-necks powers !, 
  seriously , no . 
  i get more lewd comments about my boobs than smaller breasted women do .
