  the only categorising i do for men is `` i like to hang out with them '' and `` i do n't like to hang out with them . '', 
  also , have you considered that the ` slight teasing ' you see might just be flirting ? 
  my best friends are n't cookie-cutter nice or anything , we tease each other mercilessly all the time . 
   if she so much as asked me to stop calling her i would . 
  i do n't understand why she does n't . 
  because you are her ** child ** and she does n't want to push you away !, 
  for gods sake , it 's like you 're kicking a puppy and then claiming you do n't understand why the puppy does n't run off . 
  your dad has asked you to stop , is n't that good enough ? 
  you are * not * a nice person . 
  you 're not being sweet , you are being downright cruel . 
  you need therapy , and you needed it yesterday . 
  okay , you 'll need to narrow it down a bit . 
  the uk is n't exactly a universal , generic location . 
  do you prefer city or country ? 
  warmer or cooler ? 
  do you like outdoor activities or would you prefer a going out/entertainment scene ? 
  are you looking to work in any industry in particular , or just to pick up whatever work is going ? 
  how old are you ? 
  is there a university in particular that you 're interested in ? 
  i 'd always recommend edinburgh as somewhere to live as it 's beautiful , has a good arts scene and has good public transport , but it also gets quite cold and damp and does n't quite have the vibrancy you might get in somewhere like manchester . 
  also , i 'd kind of suspect your costs in living here for 3 years would well outweigh any savings you 'd get in student fees ... ? 
  not yet , but i 'm working towards a specialism degree with the intention of going into teacher training next year . 
  i 'm also doing experience work in schools right now , so i 'm invested in education policies , and particularly ones related to history , which is my preferred area . 
  michael gove has not said one thing that i agree with , and his latest comments on ww1 have just been completely inane . 
  yes . 
  it 's pretty much the worst idea in the history of ever , especially when you brought up the idea as a * joke * . 
  you are not romeo and juliet . 
  do not get married , for gods sake . 
  i follow my passions , i guess . 
  my secondary school was very very academic orientated - get all a * in exams , go to oxford or cambridge , study english or science , be something important . 
  and while everyone was doing that , i was having fun with all of the school theatre productions and the lighting and sound . 
  so i went and trained in that for three years while everyone went off to oxbridge because i liked it , and because no one said i could n't . 
  and then i worked in it for four years doing really cool shows because i still liked it . 
  and when i stopped liking it , i quit . 
  now i 'm retraining to be a history teacher , because i love love love history , i like working with teenagers , and i like jobs that have some kind of impact on people . 
  i worked that last bit out by doing a stint at a pr company , which i thought would be fun , and i ended up hating because i realised it made zero difference to anyones life whether a dvd review ended up in the sun newspaper on friday . 
  so yeah . 
  i guess it 's a blend of ` do what you like ' , and ` have a go at things to find out what you do n't like ' . 
  i also think there is such a silly pressure to be something for a job . 
  people do n't get it when you do n't actually know what you want to do - after all , when we 're growing up , is n't it always `` what are you going to be when you 're a grown-up , little billy ? 
  ' , and the kid is * always * expected to have an answer . 
  i figure , if you do n't have an answer , who cares ? 
  as long as you enjoy your job , then it 's all good . 
  and if you do n't enjoy it , it 's not such a wrench to leave and go find something else you like instead . 
  hah , spare time ? 
  as if !, 
  i work four days a week in an office , one day a week in a school and one evening a week in a bar . 
  i 'm studying full time for a second degree , which i fit in on the evenings and weekends . 
  as far as hobbies go , my evenings are made up of dog training , gymnastics , visiting my nanna with dementia , reading my kindle , watching youtube videos , texting friends and shopping where possible . 
  * the photo . 
  is he cute ? 
  is he just posing with his shirt off in a do n't - you-find-me-sexy-way ? 
  ( hint : no ) . 
  is he holding a small child ? 
  ( if so , then scrapped . 
  i do n't want to date a man with kids right now ) . 
  can i actually * see * him in the photo ? 
  still genuinely amazed at how many men just have a profile photo of them in full ski/sports gear with goggles/sunglasses on taken from a distance . 
  * is he older or younger than me ? 
  ( younger gets skipped over ) does he live close or too far away ? 
  does he have a job ? 
  does he have kids ? 
  * has he filled out all of the sections ? 
  if you 're going to play this game you might as well make an effort at it , rather than going half-arsed on the pretext of ` oh , i do n't know what to sayyyy ' . 
  * specifically for okc : do our answers match up on the stuff i care about , i.e. 
  regular drug taker/likes lairy nights out when i do n't ? 
  * is his message to me more than just ` hi ' or ` hi sexy ' , or the classic i got the other night ` how did a nice girl like you end up in a dirty mind like mine ? ', 
  i do n't know , but i 'm turning around and taking the door marked exit right now . 
  if success on all of these points , you get a reply . 
  or not . 
  to be honest , i go through phases of complete apathy towards online dating , so i might see your message , skim your profile and not reply because i simply can not be bothered . 
  do n't take it personally . 
  i do , too . 
  i think we definitely get the better covers here . 
  really ? 
  i 've just looked at the [ american cover ] ( http://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/books/1388184640l/7235533.jpg ) for wok and i much prefer our uk version . 
  so much cleaner !, 
  i guess around 40 % at a stab-in-the-dark kind of number ? 
  i like to know that a man is employed ( or studying , postgrad students is fine with me ) , and how passionate he is about his job/career . 
  i like passion , and i like people to be enthusiastic about either what they 're doing , or what they want to do . 
  money does n't bother me too much as long as it is coming in and it 's stable wages . 
  as long as the guy is enthusiastic , i 'm not hugely fussed about what he does . 
  i might be wary about dating a dustbin man or sewer cleaner or something but i 'd still probably at least try a date if he was cute . 
  the only career that i 'm wary of getting involved with are soldiers . 
  i do n't think i could honestly live the military life . 
  my favourite thing about brandon sanderson 's * mistborn * is the magic system . 
  it 's based around metals and rooted in physics , and it feels so much more real and plausible for it . 
  definitely give it a go . 
  / r/fantasy ( i looooove fantasy fiction and a lot of cool authors pop up to chat on there , like robin hobb and brandon sanderson ), 
  and , of course , / r/tomhiddleston because yum . 
  i present you : [ tom hiddleston as coriolanus in a burlap sack ] ( http://www.theavengersmen.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/tom-hiddleston-coriolanus-04.jpg ) . 
  yup . 
  still hot . 
  crumble !, 
  especially apricot crumble , but apple crumble , or blackcurrant crumble is amazing too . 
  it 's the easiest , yummiest dessert in the world , and just the best thing on chilly winter evenings . 
  ** apricot crumble ** ( serves 3-4 ), 
  ingredients : 200g plain flour , 200g butter , 100g caster sugar , 2x tins sliced apricots , 100g chopped almonds , 50g demerara sugar . 
  pre-heat oven to 180 degrees c. completely drain the tins of sliced apricots and arrange in the bottom of an ovenproof pudding tin . 
  we use a square ceramic dish , but as long as your apricots completely fill the base any size or make is fine .
