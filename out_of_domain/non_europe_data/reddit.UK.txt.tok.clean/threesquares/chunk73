  i 'm currently re-reading ** lord of the rings ** and i 'm on two towers right now . 
  it 'll probably take me through until march to read everything . 
  i 'd like to have a go at ** name of the wind ** . 
  i 've been a bit snobbish about it up until now , but i 'll be a good fantasy reader this year and at least give it a go . 
  summer will bring ** the fool 's assassin ** and i will be all over that , of course , because it is going to be amazing . 
  i 'm also looking forward to ** words of radiance ** , and the start of karen miller 's new series , ** the path to power ** . 
  i loved her innocent mage books , so i 'm keeping my fingers crossed for a great new world . 
  do n't be obtuse . 
  the dwarves and laketown costumes are all absolutely beautiful . 
  i 'm surprised there 's not a nomination for makeup too , but it might all end up coming under taba like lotr did . 
  i thought smaug was stunning too . 
  his reveal was fabulous . 
  surprisingly , first thing in the morning when i get out of bed . 
  my hair normally has some wicked volume going on , my pyjamas are all loose and cute and i feel really comfortable with myself . 
  i always like how i look that early on in the day . 
  well , i doubt your girlfriend is going to get rid of the dog just to appease you - i would never , ever pass on my puppy for a man . 
  is there any particular * reason * you do n't like the dog , or is it just a generic not-my-thing kind of feeling ? 
  because just from this post , i 'd say your choices are either a ) suck it up and deal with it or b ) do n't move in with her . 
  it was so heartbreaking !, 
  hobb gets you so attached to her characters , and she wrote that scene just beautifully . 
  it stays with you for such a long time . 
  as an english lady with a mostly rp ( bbc english ) accent , i like the northern geordie accent , a light edinburgh one , the irish , kiwis , aussies and a couple of american accents . 
  not so fond of south african , and i * did * like french speech patterns until i dated a couple of frenchman and had the rose tinted glasses taken off . 
  she 's just a person . 
  relax . 
  make a small joke out of the fact that you 're nervous , smile and do your job . 
  you 'll get used to being around her , and maybe you 'll even get along enough to have a chat and enjoy things !, 
  ugh no . 
  i do n't like guns at all and have no desire to be around them , no matter whether i 'm in a gun-happy country or not . 
  if i was an american citizen in the states i imagine it would be different as i 'd be more likely to have been brought up around guns . 
  americans and the easy availability of guns scare me . 
  that news item about an ex-cop shooting another guy in a cinema because * he had his mobile on * ? 
  wtf . 
  a few reasons . 
  my brother and i were never given , or allowed to play with toy guns when we were little , and i 've never been to a shooting range or out on a field shoot so they have n't ever been a part of my life in any form . 
  the lack of civilian carry and police carry means i 've also never become complacent towards them . 
  if i see a gun carried openly in public ( and we 're not in a field or whatever ) , there is some * serious serious * shit going down . 
  guns to me = fear . 
  guns are designed and built for violent acts and for death . 
  they were made to shoot humans , and if they are not shooting humans , they are shooting animals . 
  i do n't care that you can have one to practice at a shooting range , you are still shooting at a target - i.e. 
  to kill . 
  you can cushion the language around them and their uses all you like , that is what they boil down to . 
  if everything is overwhelming , and everything is the problem , start with the smallest , easiest problem and go from there . 
  make a list , and break everything down into its components parts . 
  it 's like when your house is a mess and you 're exhausted - sometimes the one thing that gets you started is tidying a drawer . 
  going for a walk was a fabulous plan , do more of that . 
  walks are free , and fresh air and exercise is so , so important !, 
  so for example , my list of problem and main aims right now looks like this : ** become a teacher **, 
  to do this i need to : get a degree / do teacher training, 
  to do this i need : teaching experience / study opportunities, 
  teaching experience - write a letter to local schools ( done ) / volunteer once a week in a school ( currently doing ) / apply for training courses ( which i would write a second to-do list for , just to make sure i did everything i needed for a good application ), 
  big degree things : enrol in open university on course ( done ) / apply for student funding ( done ), 
  little degree things : pass module, 
  to do this i need to : write my current assignment / book time off for exams, 
  to write my assignment i need : study materials / a quiet room / scheduled study time, 
  see how it breaks down ? 
  in the end , all i need is to write a letter and to make sure i had some quiet time to get my head down and do things . 
  all of the little things do add up over time , you just have to do them . 
  it 's exactly the same for you . 
  give yourself little achievable things to do all the time , and use them to work towards your goal . 
  you can get there !, 
  you do n't get to choose your dads girlfriends . 
  it 's great that your mum has met someone nice and you like him , but for one dinner on one night i think you can grin and bear this . 
  it 's not your wedding , it 's just a celebratory dinner to say how nice it is that you 're engaged . 
  if everyone else is bringing their partner , i think it would be churlish to refuse him on the basis that you do n't ` approve ' . 
  to be fair , by the sound of it you 'll probably never have to see her again anyway . 
  height i use feet and inches . 
  if i 'm weighing myself i use stone . 
  if i 'm weighing out ingredients i use grams and kg . 
  i use a weird hybrid mix of imperial and metric , but i think most people do . 
  i buy petrol by the litre , and drive by the mile , buy a pint of milk but pour out 500ml of milk for a recipe . 
  shops sell electronics based on how big the screen is in inches but i 'll measure out a metre of something . 
  it does make sense , somewhere along the line . 
  he 's wonderful in the remake of brideshead revisited , too . 
  not such a good film , but a great performance . 
  and definitely definitely make sure you see him as richard ii in the bbc 's * hollow crown * series !, 
  i tend to think that they 're insecure . 
  why be so proud of being nasty , after all ? 
  sure , i like complaining about things that annoy me as much as the next person , but when you self describe as someone who is antagonistic and abrasive , i have to wonder what 's going on with their self-esteem . 
  it 's not nice being a nasty person . 
  no one likes you . 
  it 's the grown up version of going `` i can do everything by myself !, 
  i do n't need any of you ! '', 
  and that 's just sad . 
  because i get along with pretty much everyone i meet . 
  and that 's awesome . 
  i 'm currently writing an assignment on the wars of the three kingdoms and the english civil war , focusing specifically on propaganda , and it 's really interesting to see the different blatant biases of the news from 1640 . 
  oliver knight 's * `` the grand remonstrance '' * is a great explanation of the parliamentatian bill-that-was-actually-propaganda that helped set off the first war , and gary rivett `` english newsbooks , storytelling and political criticism '' has a really interesting analysis of the * mercurius aulicus * , the weekly royalist newsbook of the 1640s . 
  in particular , i love the fact that it had an ongoing spat with the * mercurius britanicus * , the parliamentarian newsbook until 1646 , especially when you see newspapers of today going at the same thing too . 
  i do n't believe you can specifically see attendance rates on exact days , i.e. 
  before or after inspection , but the ofsted schools data dashboard gives you attendance rates for the year . 
  [ this is one ] ( http://dashboard.ofsted.gov.uk/dash.php?urn=135651 ) for a random secondary school in my area . 
  just as a note , the ` short period of time ' schools are given is no more than a 24 hour notice . 
  schools have to be informed by 1pm of the preceding day if they will have inspectors in the next morning , but most are canny and know when inspectors are in their area . 
  it 's the same as anything - you can read as much as you like about it , but it 's never the same as * doing * it . 
  i also think you can be way overprepared for stuff , and this sounds like exactly that . 
  when you finally do do it , do n't overthink it !, 
  just go with it . 
  if you come out of it thinking `` oh god , i did n't touch her [ wherever ] like everyone said !,
