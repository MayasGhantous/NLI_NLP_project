  she 's hardly stranded in the boonies , you 're in * london * . 
  if you 're not happy , then put on your big boy pants and break up with her . 
  stop dilly dallying because you 're worried about how she might possibly get on with her life without big strong you around . 
  i 'm in the uk so mostly [ the guardian online ] ( http://www.theguardian.com ) but if i 'm bored of their blabbering about gchq i 'll go onto the bbc for a while . 
  if something big is happening , then sky news always seems to publicise the most immediate updates . 
  i do like the ` plucky young protaganist goes to wizard school ' books . 
  i do n't know , i just like the growth cycle of young and inexperienced to mature and powerful , and i like reading about the character learning things and experimenting with powers . 
  harry potter . 
  sonja in the black magician trilogy . 
  vin learning to be mistborn . 
  fitz learning to be an assassin . 
  all of those . 
  i followed a link on tumblr the other day to an 8track listing that someone had made for [ music of the dwarves ] ( http://8tracks.com/cidershark/khazad-music-for-the-dwarves ) and i thought it was excellent . 
  the description is ' a playlist for the race of dwarves . 
  featuring heavy drums , brasses , horns , reedy winds , choral hymns and chants , and the persistent ringing heartbeat of the forge . ', 
  i always think another really stirring fantasy piece has to be holst 's [ jupiter from the planet suite ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oydzb6tzw7m ) . 
  it 's all about setting out on adventure . 
  i physically could n't do my high-impact sport ( gymnastics ) without my sports bra . 
  it would be * miles * too painful . 
  my school used to have a poster advert in our changing rooms with a picture of anna kournikova on , and the slogan `` only the balls should bounce '' . 
  yup , especially where students are concerned . 
  you can buy 1kg packs of fusilli for about a quid from tescos which makes it super economical . 
  most of my student meals were pasta , potato or bread based . 
   it 's not worth it . 
  it is ** always ** worth making yourself feel attractive , no matter whether you 're scarlett johanssen or susan boyle . 
  and who are you to say the op making herself pretty is ` unachievable ' ? 
  i reckon the op is gorgeous and just does n't know how to bring it out . 
  that 's easily fixable . 
  a pessimistic ` do n't ever bother trying ' attitude likes yours will take much longer to change . 
  well probably - a fit and healthy body is always attractive to me . 
  it would n't be a guarantee that i 'd fancy him by any means , but someone who dresses well and lives reasonably healthily would probably ping my radar , yes . 
  i 'd say so , only because there are ties between farseer and liveship which then play on into tawny man . 
  i think hobb herself recommends reading assassins apprentice first too ? 
  not much time for fun reading this month unfortunately , but i did read ** fellowship of the ring ** and i 'm doing a slow trawl through ** two towers ** now . 
  same - i enjoyed blood song well enough , but i was n't exactly captivated by it . 
  i certainly do n't think it 's the next big thing or anything like that . 
  it depends on your so and your relationship . 
  i 'm always going to find other people hot , no matter who i 'm with . 
  other people exist in the world , i 'm not only ever going to get with someone and then only ever have eyes for them for the rest of my life . 
  but some boyfriends will be cool with me pointing out a hot guy or girl and some wo n't . 
  it also depends how it 's phrased and how often it 's brought up . 
  in summary : totally depends . 
  same here . 
  i do n't really have a reason for not liking them , i just ... do n't . 
  quite a lot . 
  i tend to go on gut instinct for a lot of things i do rather than thinking through them rationally . 
  it 's taken me to some interesting places so far in life , but i do wonder if some of the uglier gut feelings are more about fear or nerves putting me off something that could be really fun . 
  i did n't watch the link and i got that it was a joke heavy on the irony . 
  it was a * three line * set up . 
  seriously , if you ca n't wait three lines for a punchline you need to go back to knock-knock school or something . 
  you 're growing and changing as a person . 
  that 's really , really cool , and it 's great that you 're getting so much more confident about yourself . 
  but you ca n't do it if your boyfriend wo n't grow with you . 
  he 'll keep you tied to who you used to be , and you 'll both end up resenting each other . 
  you do know what you need to do , and i get the feeling that you 're scared of cutting that tie , even though you 're straining to get away . 
  you 're like a balloon , right at the end of the string and trying to keep on going while he wants to stay on the ground . 
  there 's nothing wrong with that - you 're just growing up , is all . 
  it happens to everyone . 
  he 's told you what he 'd prefer , which is a clean break . 
  listen to him . 
  it is . 
  irish students also do n't accrue any loans . 
  i 'm an english student who went to a scottish university where lots of irish students also attended . 
  i know of at least one irish girl who worked all the way through her studies and came out of it in profit . 
  as far as subject study goes , imagine the uk education system like a giant triangle , with primary at the bottom and university at the top . 
  up until year 9 ( age 14 ) , subjects are as broad as possible and you study all the sciences , english , at least one modern foreign language and a bunch of the humanities . 
  from year 10 , you just study your 10 chosen gcse subjects . 
  in lower sixth you study your chosen 4 subjects , and then in upper sixth you go down to 3 subjects . 
  in university you 're only doing one specific area for the whole three years . 
   there is also a grammar school system that runs in some parts of the uk that requires you to take an exam at age 11 to gain entrance to a school ( i do n't know much about these schools ) . 
  i went to an all girls grammar school . 
  beyond the entrance exam , there 's really no obvious difference between a grammar and a state school that i 'm aware of . 
  the entrance exam at 11 is called the 11 plus , and it tests you on maths , verbal reasoning and non verbal reasoning . 
  the highest percentage of children who pass are offered entrance to the grammar school , so they basically cream off most of the most intelligent kids in the area . 
  there are no fees to attend . 
  in my school we were very much expected to work to a higher standard than most , there was n't that much ` set ' separation other than in maths and science , and it was compulsory for us to study latin . 
  it was assumed we would all get a * - c on all gcses and a-levels ( if not all straight as ) , and go on to university , preferably oxbridge . 
  i love my body , and i love being a female gendered me . 
  i went to an all-girls school , and i really believe it empowered me to have absolute confidence in everything i do as a woman . 
  i would n't change at all . 
  my dog has qualified to show at [ crufts ] ( http://www.crufts.org.uk/ ) , the largest dog show in the world and we 'll be there on the 9th of march , which is very very exciting !, 
  we 've visited before but never qualified a dog for it , so i ca n't wait !, 
  it 'll be such a long day , but it 'll be so much fun . 
  he 's an almost two year old orange belton english setter called henry , and he 's my ( cheeky ) baby . 
  he looooooves the shows , so i 'm sure he 'll be a perfect star in the ring even if we do n't place anywhere . 
  there 'll be a lot of competition !, 
  it just sounds like he 's nervous about whether you 're aiming for something , or whether you 'll just sit around at home until you 're 35 . 
  he probably just wants to help . 
  be proactive with him - do n't wait for him to get cross at you and fall into arguments all the time , because you 'll just end up fighting constantly . 
  sit down for half an hour with a piece of paper and a pen , and write down all of the areas that you might like to explore for jobs . 
  it can be anything you like , from being a chef , to mechanics to video game designer to astronaut to stay at home dad . 
  whatever . 
  then go back to him and say `` dad , i honestly do n't know what i want to do , but these are what i quite like . 
  maybe you can help me figure out what might suit me ? '', 
  you do n't have to take his advice or follow whatever instructions he might give you , but it will help so much just to * listen * . 
  i bet he really just wants to make sure you 're going somewhere in life . 
  do n't stick your head in the sand , just let him help . 
  where are you coming to see ? 
  busy . 
  my life is so stupidly busy right now i hardly know whether i 'm coming or going .
