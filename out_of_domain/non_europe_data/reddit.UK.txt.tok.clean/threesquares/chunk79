  but it 's sooooo worth it . 
  also , i did an unofficial survey on my facebook a few months ago to find out how much tea my friends drank daily , and most people drank at least three cups . 
  i drink somewhere around twelve a day . 
  yeah . 
  i may have a tea problem . 
  but that 's okay . 
   never put milk in earl grey, 
  lies !, 
  do n't listen , op !, 
  i * always * drink milk with my twinings earl grey . 
  my dad has the fancy non-milk lemon grey stuff , but me and the earl with a bit of milk get along juuuuuust fine . 
  the smokier the better as far as i 'm concerned . 
  always make sure it 's fresh cold water that you put in the kettle to boil !, 
  it 's got more oxygen in and releases the taste of the tea better than reheated water does . 
  pour boiled water straight on your teabag , leave to steep for your preferred time ( 30 seconds for pg tips/tetley etc , 2 minutes for earl grey , lapsang etc ) , remove teabag , add milk , stir , enjoy !, 
  honestly , do n't get ahead of yourself just yet . 
  you only learned about this today , and already you 're jumping ahead to what might happen in three years time !, 
  you do n't even know if you qualify yet , or what the programme in ireland actually offers . 
  do your research , do the sums and then sit down with your boyfriend and * talk * to him about it . 
  start it with `` hey babe , i 've found out that college offers this really cool transfer programme to ireland that i like the sound of . 
  what do you think ? '', 
  who knows , he might actually be open to the idea of applying to come with you and trying some travel out himself .

  i used to live in the ` pink triangle ' of edinburgh when i was at uni , that contained most of the gay bars in the city . 
  the music was good , half the student population of the drama school i was at was gay so i always there with friends , i did n't get hit on half as much by stupid drunk idiots and it was full of gorgeous men . 
  gay bars for nights out are fine by me . 
  one of the more unusual hair fashions that always interested me is the fashion for high foreheads in noble women from around the early 15th century . 
  the quite excellent * evolution of fashion * by hill and bucknell ( if you 're at all interested in period costume , get this gorgeous book ) advises that for ladies of the 1420s , `` the front of the head is shaven to create a high forehead . '', 
  for 1440s costume , the description moves on to `` plucking of the hair to achieve a high forehead , plucking of eyebrows . '', 
  we can see this quite well in petrus christus ' [ ` portrait of a young woman ' ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a1/petrus_christus_-_portrait_of_a_young_girl_-_wga4864.jpg ) which has that distinct high forehead and almost invisible eyebrow line which was fashionable at the time . 
  [ here is another by christus ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e6/petrus_christus_003_detail.jpg ) with that exaggerated high hairline created by plucking of the hair . 
  it really is n't until the 1500s is underway that we start to see portraits with a more natural hairline appear again , but even the heavy gable head dress of the 1530s as worn by [ katherine of aragon ] ( http://www.gogmsite.net/_media/1525ca-katherine-of-aragon-2.jpeg ) artificially hides the hair all over again . 
  well , i 'm english so i ca n't get access to any of those , but i 'll bear it in mind for when i 'm feeling experimental . 
  he 's my ex , therefore not my problem . 
  if i get worked about it , that 's all my issues coming out , not his . 
  tawny man destroyed me in so many ways . 
  the first book was bad enough , and still gets me weepy when i think about those scenes , but the third book wrecked me for days . 
  extraordinary writing . 
   i want to pursue her again but is it worth it ? 
  sure , if you want to spend your whole life breaking up and making up with this girl . 
  you know full well you 're never going to have a stable relationship with her - if you could n't do it the first * four times * , what on earth makes you think this is going to be magical number five ? 
  read through your post again , print out paragraph # 5 and stick it on your wall to look at whenever you 're wavering . 
  you know already that you 're not right for each other and that you never end up working out . 
  you do n't need us to tell you that . 
  assuming you 've had a successful conversation and found lots of common ground to go on , for me it 's as simple as `` hey , this was really fun . 
  maybe we could meet up for a drink/coffee and do it again sometime ? '', 
  if he 's in agreement and we swap numbers , date acquired !, 
  awesome . 
  if not , no big deal . 
  i 've not lost anything by asking . 
  see , i do n't like russian politics at all either , and i massively disagree with that part on pretty much every level , but i 'm watching the games for the athletes and their achievements . 
  i like the little things you see them doing - there was a camera shot of a swedish coach or something wearing rainbow headphones , for example . 
  not particularly . 
  i 've got loads of friends who went to oxford and cambridge . 
  it does n't particularly make them any more impressive than anyone else . 
  henry baby , baby-baby , horrible henry , hopeful henry , hobbit henry ( he keeps angling for second dinner and third breakfast lately ) . 
  the series is called `` the hollow crown '' if that helps !, 
  ben whishaw plays richard ii , and jeremy irons is henry iv . 
  it 's very , very good . 
  it depends where i 'm going , as i 'm british and we 've got a common afternoon pub culture . 
  if it is a few hours down the pub with friends it 's normally very very informal dress ( jeans and a jumper or something ) with lots and lots of gossiping over something like vodka lemonade and lime , a white wine spritzer or maybe a pint of cider . 
  if there 's a snooker table we might play a game , but it 'll probably be all talk and it 's unlikely we 'll talk to , or be approached by , anyone else outside our friendship group . 
  if it 's a night out at a bar , it 'll be much dressier , and i 'll make an effort with heels and a cute dress or something . 
  we 'll probably be there until midnight or 1am , it will be loud and crowded and if the music 's cheesy enough we might dance . 
  i suspect i 'd get approached or have very unclassy flirtations take place by a couple of guys and spot a couple more eyeing myself or my friends up . 
  bars are a lot more uncomfortable venues for me than pubs now , and i do n't do nights out at them very much at all . 
  i 'm doing a day a week work experience at a secondary school this year ahead of applying for teacher training . 
  on tuesday , i learned that even though i 'm just a part time volunteer , the kids still see me as ` miss ' , and if i tell them off then they * will * listen to me and do as i say . 
  it was very empowering !, 
  also , i learned that some people are just straight up drama queens , and there is sod all you can do about it . 
  i just assume that i am , because i have plenty of days that i feel like i look really good , and i dress as well as i possibly can to enhance that . 
  realistically i 'm probably average and i 'm never going to be kate moss , but i do n't care . 
  i do n't ask people whether i 'm pretty , i just look in the mirror , tell myself that i am and walk out the door . 
  let 's see here ... 
  prettyribbons, 
  loves, 
  viperion ( first a/w guy i thought of hahahah ), 
  by my notebook calculations , you guys get 65 % !, 
  wooo quantification !, 
  in avengers assemble we saw thor supercharge iron man with a lightening bolt during their forest fight , so when tony 's all floppy and pretty much dead from wormhole , i figured thor would supercharge him back to business . 
  nope . 
  we just got a hulk shout . 
  i 'm assuming it 'll be something they 'll use in age of ultron , maybe ? 
  tom hiddleston . 
  he 's * always * worthwhile . 
  i mean , [ just look at that ] ( http://www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/hiddles31.jpg ) . 
  i hate that idea that a ` real woman ' is this or that . 
  what , are we in ` who framed roger rabbit ' with cartoon people everywhere or something ? 
  women * are * what women * are * . 
  being overweight does n't make you any less ` real ' . 
  being underweight does n't mean you 're somehow faking your gender . 
  ask if them if they really believe blondes have more fun , too . 
  they are mean , spiteful girls who are making themselves feel better by making you feel worse . 
  who needs enemies when you 've got friends like that ? 
  you deserve so much more . 
  length , maybe . 
  i know boxers more as boy shorts , which can either be a [ casual style ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-eugo-kf8edc/uh9riinueoi/aaaaaaabov8/jej2zswstys/s1600/white-cotton-boy-short-untitled_00977.jpg ) or [ french knicker style ] ( http://images.esellerpro.com/2762/i/271/1/l1-1.jpg ) .
