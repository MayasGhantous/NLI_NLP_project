  better to expand on your jobs , what you 're doing at uni and what you want to do in the future . 
  your favourite books/tv/games list is way too long . 
  pick four out of each section , especially the games list . 
  it 's far too unwieldy . 
   ** on a typical friday night i am **, 
  hanging out with friends , working , or apparently browsing okcupid because my one true love could still be out there guys . 
  this sounds a ) dull and b ) desperate . 
  have a look at the sidebar for the do 's and do n'ts for this section because it really needs mixing up . 
  make it more like your ideal friday night , not like ones where you 're scraping the barrel for girls to date . 
   ** the most private thing i 'm willing to admit **, 
  that i have nothing private willing to admit . 
  i 'm an open book , and i do n't keep secrets ( about me . 
  if you ask me to keep a secret i will , of course ) . 
  if something embarrassing happens to me , or if i feel a certain way , i 'll let you know . 
  holding things in may lead you to feelings of insecurity and cause anger outbursts . 
  nobody likes those . 
  that ... completely misses the point of this section . 
  you said you 're a funny guy earlier , so make this funny !, 
  make it a silly confession about something daft , not about developing anger issues . 
  mine is about conducting epic pieces of music when i 'm driving my car , for instance . 
  it does n't have to be about actually disclosing terribly private facts about yourself . 
   i 'm a pretty nice guy , and would like to meet someone special . 
  `` special '' , whatever that term really means . 
  we 're all special in one way or another . 
  i just felt like that sounded good , so deal with it . 
  again , that 's such a bizarre note to end on . 
  deal with it ? 
  really ? 
  that 's how you want girls to think of you ? 
  hey thanks !, 
  the walking the dog sentence was quite unwieldy , i had n't noticed that . 
  i think the beans on toast thing is a cultural reference so i 'll leave that as it is , but i 've changed the other suggestions . 
  much appreciated !, 
  i do agree with you on the photo note , though - it 's nice to know the fourth one is better than i thought . 
  i 'll swop the fourth and the third around so the group photo is lower down and crop it in a bit . 
  ( : glad you like it all !, 
  hey thanks !, 
  i 'm actually genuinely surprised by the chorus who like my fourth photo . 
  i still like how the first one shows more of my face but i 've moved the grass one up the ladder instead . 
  thanks !, 
  i still think the first one shows my face a bit better but i 've made the grass one the second photo instead . 
  ( : good to know people think it 's a good shot though !, 
  i 'll bear it in mind for when i feel like changing things around again . 
  hey thanks !, 
  and i do have six things on my six things list - i 'm not sure what you missed out , 
  it does n't scream douchebag , but it does sound like someone who generally likes to complain , which also does n't sound like a fun date !, 
  i think really you just need to aim for a lighter , funnier note and talk more about where you 're working and what you 're hoping to end up doing . 
  and shorten your games section !, 
  living in edinburgh and drinking the water was like sweet manna from heaven . 
  now i just get gristly ugly limescaley stuff . 
  think of it this way as well - women are not going to want to date you if they think you 'll be embarrassed about saying where you met . 
  it would make me feel like some kind of dirty little secret ; `` oh her ? 
  whoop de doo , people use the internet to meet other people . 
  big deal . 
  why does it matter if other people you know see you use okc ? 
  they know you 're single , do n't they ? 
  online dating is n't some weird big secret for odd people anymore , it 's where about 50 % of single people find relationships now . 
  also yes , you 're missing out on a huge number of messages . 
  i will never ever message someone without a photo , because i do n't want to date someone who 's so obviously crippled by embarrassment either about how they look or what they 're doing on okc . 
  if you 're going to do online dating then actually do it . 
  do n't do it halfway and then get all shy about it . 
  that 's not attractive . 
  you * have * available girls wanting to talk to you and flirt with you . 
  you 're just turning them down because you do n't think they 're pretty enough . 
  there 's standards and then there 's just plain being picky . 
  do you actually have conversations with these girls who show interest in you ? 
  how much time do you take to actually get to know the basics about them at all ? 
  maybe you should try it next time and see where it gets you . 
  also about the whole people not keeping you in the loop thing - how often are you inviting them out ? 
  or are you just waiting for them to invite you along all the time ? 
  nope . 
  too simple . 
  your profile basically reads as follows :, 
  i 'm pretty much a good guy . 
  i do stuff . 
  stuff is good . 
  i 'm tall . 
  music . 
  i like music . 
  i like films . 
  here 's a list . 
  i do n't like capitals . 
  i do stuff . 
  message me . 
  talking seriously now though , you 've gone from simple into ` so brief i do n't know what to message you about . ', 
  you need to trim the music and films back a bit and expand the other sections more . 
   ** what i 'm doing with my life **, 
  living it , day by day . 
  no , but what are you actually doing with your life ? 
  you do mention a job earlier , but if you had n't of said that i would just assume you were a lazy bum sitting around all day , and that 's not attractive . 
  are you at college too ? 
  what do you want to do in the future ? 
  if you do n't want to talk about work , what do you do on the weekends instead ? 
   ** the first things people usually notice about me **, 
  height for sure, 
  okay , so - make something of this . 
  have you ever walked into a door frame ? 
  do little old ladies ask you to hand them stuff from high shelves ? 
  do your friends call you lurch ? 
  just ` being tall ' is too brief .
