  also , you 're not lying to her if you have other plans on thursday with this other girl , because you are genuinely busy . 
  just because it 's another date does n't make you any more or less available . 
   also , the place where she wants to go see the movie just so happens to be a place where a girl i was dating for a bit who found someone else works . 
  so if you see her , smile politely and carry on . 
  if your date asks , just say `` oh , just someone i went on a date with ages ago . '', 
  no big deal . 
  it means that he 's holding out no contact , basically . 
  you just got your hopes up and i 'm sorry that they got knocked down , but this is how it 's going to be now . 
  it also does n't mean that he would n't have thought about you at all on the day , but he 's doing the right thing and letting you both separate from each other . 
  yes to farseer absolutely , followed by the tawny man trilogy . 
  the liveships series comes between the two and goes back to third person , but farseer and tm are both first person the whole way through .

  it 's the essential guide for names in the industry and information on how the uk theatre scene works . 
  [ the stage ] ( http://www.thestage.co.uk/ ) is the uk performing arts paper , so keep an eye on that too . 
  tea !, 
  i fill every british stereotype and spend most of my day drinking tea . 
  tetleys , earl grey , darjeeling , lapsang - i go through it all . 
  healthier than coke , tastier than plain water . 
  i had n't !, 
  that 's why i love shore so much , he 's so clever at weaving all of these themes together and linking everything in subtle little ways . 
  nah , scouse accents tend to have a rise at the end of their words which thorins does n't . 
  he 's much slower and more gravelly than a scouser would be . 
  i 'd definitely be more inclined to say yorkshire if you do n't want to settle for ` generic northern ' . 
  i 'm probably one of the more outspoken lets-do-this people in my group , but i 'm not a person who actually gets stuff done . 
  that 's my friend l , who is the organiser of everything . 
  i just tend to say `` oh this would be fun to do '' , and then if we do something else i go with it anyway . 
  well , a few things first . 
  when is the wedding ? 
  winter or summer ? 
  what shape are you ? 
  flat chested/skinny/bigger boobed ? 
  different shapes suit different dresses . 
  if you 're quite androgynous , i 'd say look at the sort of things [ tilda swinton ] ( http://www.thefashionspot.com/images/tfs2010/2013/march/tilda-swinton-chanel-2013-cruise-collection-front-row-versailles-france-may-2012.jpg ) wears , as she 's very boyish and prefers [ suit trousers and shirts ] ( http://www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/wenn20385090.jpg ) . 
  you need to have quite a tall boyish figure to pull her style off , though . 
  if not , maybe a [ maxi dress ] ( http://picture-cdn.wheretoget.it/toem2g-l-610x610-dress-prom-dress-evening-dress-chiffon-maxi-dress-sheer-dress-halter-neck-navy.jpg ) would help stay in your comfort zone . 
  it gives you that covered up feeling of trousers and shirts while still being dressy and loose and very wedding appropriate . 
  it would also mean that you could stay in flat shoes . 
  basic rules :, 
  * do n't wear white to a wedding , even if it 's a really really cute dress . 
  that 's the brides colour . 
  * the necklines you can wear depend on your boobs . 
  the smaller your chest , the higher a neck will suit you . 
  bigger boobs suit more scooped or v-necks , otherwise you 'll look top heavy . 
  the maxi dress i linked suits smaller chests , for example . 
  * if you 're self conscious about showing boobs , you can always layer a cardigan or blazer on top to still be dressy . 
  * if you 're really really stuck , treat yourself to a personal shopper session !, 
  they can help you figure out what will suit you . 
  * watch some gok wan !, 
  he 's all about helping women who are stuck figure out what to wear , and i 'm sure channel 4 have loads of old episodes on youtube . 
  i do n't want to date men with children right now , no matter how good or bad their relationship is with the mother . 
  i hardly have the time to look after myself , let alone try and make a relationship work with kids involved . 
  as i 'm 28 i know this is starting to affect my dating pool , but that 's fine . 
  if you tell me you have a kid , i 'll apologise ( nicely ) and say that this relationship is n't for me . 
  yes , but uk universities do n't work that way . 
  we specialise in particular subjects like english , medicine and law , so there 's no point us recommending a particular city if that uni is n't very good at the subjects you like . 
  you ca n't just apply to do a general programme , you have to apply for a course . 
  so what would you like to study ? 
  honestly , if you do n't give us the information we 're asking for we really ca n't help you narrow it down . 
  there 's no point us throwing out the names of random cities if your university does n't have a connection to them or the department for your subject is n't very good . 
  when i was in my early twenties i used to look for it maybe a couple of times a year . 
  now i 'm heading towards thirty i do n't look for it at all . 
  now i only want sex if it 's in the circumstances of a possible or actual relationship . 
  nah , normally it 's been a couple of little things for me that have added up to a no . 
  i remember did go on one date with a guy who was quite nice , but the way we saw money was just totally different . 
  he saw a promotion on the restaurant table to win a thousand pounds by filling out a survey and said `` pfftt , a grand ? 
  that 's not even a real prize ! '', 
  for me , who 's never been out of her overdraft and never really had more than a couple of hundred pounds spare at any one time , i was just very taken aback . 
  i thought i could n't honestly date him if we did n't see eye to eye on basic things like that . 
  my entire country works on self-deprecating humour and the basis of never taking yourself too seriously . 
  it 's fine , just as long as you do n't spend your whole life on the verge of verbally punishing yourself . 
  just practice . 
  go to a supermarket or something and wander round looking at things and other people . 
  if your eyes meet , smile , then look away . 
  public places like supermarkets or malls mean you 'll see a variety of people and it 's unlikely that you 'll ever meet them again , so there 's less pressure on what they might think . 
  i naturally smile at most people , i do n't pick and choose , and it 's always nice to see happy people out and about . 
  chocolate . 
  honestly , i eat far too much chocolate and i know it , but it 's very easy to convince myself into buying those reduced price chocolate cake bars , or chocolate covered biscuits for a pound . 
  i do n't smoke , i do n't drink , i do n't do weed , but i eat an * awful * lot of chocolate . 
  i have no idea when most of my friends birthdays are until facebook tells me to write them a little message . 
  if they want to have a party , then they need to do the organisation . 
  why * should * your friend reschedule ? 
  he dibbed the date first and you had n't invited him to anything else . 
  you sound surprised that he somehow has n't come crawling back with an offer to change the date , and now you 're getting all cranky about it with the `` well i 'll have my party on the * same day * and then everyone will come to * mine * and we 'll have ** so much more fun ** ! '', 
  attitude . 
  if you want all of your friends to come , have your party on the earlier night so everyone is fresher from a working week and get them all to buy you a drink at midnight . 
  next year , get your night out set up earlier , and for gods sake , stop being so petty . 
  you 're twenty five , not fifteen . 
  says who ? 
  should it only be the pretty people having sex ? 
  should it only be the pretty people having sex with * each other * ? 
  why does attractiveness even matter when it 's the nerves and brain inside your body that are creating those great feelings ? 
  if two eighty year olds are deeply in love with one another , why should n't they share their bodies with each other ? 
  what 's the cut off point between two people that says `` okay , you were fine to have sex with each other when you were both twenty , but now you 're both past pension age , it 's a bit dodgy , do n't you think ? '', 
  saggy skin and excess curves or lack of curves do n't mean anything . 
  being conventionally beautiful does n't give you an innate upgrade to better sex . 
  angelina jolie is not having better sex than anyone else in this subreddit . 
  the only difference is that she can afford a humongous bed , and that she 's in love with the person she 's sleeping with . 
  you 're not . 
  i agree with everyone else on here - i think you need to find a different fwb who sees you more than just ' a wet hole ' , because you are ** so ** much more than that . 
  oooh , happy video time !,
