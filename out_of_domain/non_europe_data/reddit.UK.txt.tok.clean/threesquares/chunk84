  i think that attitude comes more with age , though - when you 're a teenager or even in your early twenties , being part of the crowd is * much * more important than it is when you start heading towards your crotechety thirties or forties . 
  i 'm not far off thirty , and my tendency to dress to other peoples expectations ( other than in a work environment , of course ) has dropped wayyyy off the radar . 
  now i dress just for me . 
   what i was saying is , how bad must feel to think `` this super cute article cloth is not the problem , the problem is me '' . 
  see , i honestly do n't think like that because it 's not my body that 's the problem . 
  there 's nothing wrong with me , and i have never been so desperately in love with a top that i 've felt upset because i do n't suit it and therefore should n't buy it . 
  there 's nothing stopping me buying it , anyway - no fashion alarms at the door , no neon sign when i get to the till to tell me not to buy or wear that style . 
  put it this way , i 've felt annoyed that a shop does n't stock a range that fits my body type , or caters their clothes too large in the back and too small in the boobs . 
  i 've never felt annoyed , or felt upset that my body does n't cater to that shop . 
  if i do n't suit their ranges ( i 'm looking at you , topshop and zara ) , then i go and spend my money elsewhere . 
  capitalism at work , baby . 
  well , i 'm a girl and that 's how i feel in that situation . 
  unaffected . 
  to my british tastebuds , americans seem * obsessed * with cinnamon . 
  cinnamon everything . 
  i do n't get it . 
  that and pumpkin . 
  i 've become more willing to put myself out there . 
  in the last year alone i 've entered ( and been placed in ) at least a dozen dog shows and an adult gymnastics competition , sorted myself out placement work in a local school , arranged further education and the funds for it and half a dozen other things . 
  i 'm more okay with taking risks and asking the right questions so i can go and achieve things , and i 'm not afraid of nerve-wracking situations . 
  if i could go and put on a leotard and do leaps on a beam in front of a bunch of total strangers in a place that i 've never been to before and actually get * placed * for it while i 'm in my mid-twenties , i can do bloody well anything . 
  yeah , i really think the best thing for you here would be to leave her be and let her decide at your own pace what she wants to do . 
  not only has she told you that she does n't want anything exclusive , but she 's * showing * you that she does n't want anything exclusive either . 
  you ca n't get anything more out of this . 
  move on . 
  i 'm a walking stereotype . 
  i go straight for the chocolate . 
  my freestanding handstands are getting longer - somewhere around ten seconds now !, 
  endless handstand-forward roll handstand-forward rolls in the gym are absolutely paying off . 
  i also helped another gymnastics newbie find her proper handstand form on friday , which was a really good feeling . 
  vaginas are self-cleaning , clever little things . 
  that 's what results from the vagina giving itself a bit of a wash out . 
  every woman gets it , and it varies depending on whereabouts in her cycle she is . 
  ovulation makes it springier , for example . 
  bodies are clever !, 
  also , stop inspecting your girlfriends knickers . 
  that 's creepy . 
  just had mine !, 
  i had half a ham and salad bap ( the rest i gave to the dog ) , a big braeburn apple , a pack of quavers and a little chocolate cake bar thing . 
  now it 's my favourite part of the day ; time for tea . 
  granny smiths are my favourite , but my local co-op just does big bags of eight of them and i 'll never go through that many apples in a week !, 
  so i chomp my way through yummy braeburns instead . 
  name , age , does he have kids ? 
  i 'm happy to go into it pretty blind but i 'll need to know those things at least . 
  actually , it was arrogant and do you know why ? 
  because seriously , when would that man ever have gone up to another man , laughed at him and said `` i thought shirts were supposed to be white ! '', 
  never . 
  so what , in all seriousness , makes it more acceptable to tell a woman ( that he does n't even know ) that her lipstick should be a different colour ? 
  i think it 'll be a close call , but no , i do n't think it will pass . 
  my hair is longer now but i still really love that photo . 
  you are so cute !, 
  i lurve your hair and glasses . 
  totally adorable . 
  big fat ** lose ** . 
  i 'm getting awful tired of my ( g ) irls lately and i 'd like to drop down to a d or even a c. 
  i do dog shows !, 
  actually we 've qualified for crufts which is next weekend so i 'll be in the ring with my english setter , henry , seeing if we can get a rosette . 
  tired . 
  i 'm starting to get frustrated with having to study all the time instead of having the evenings after work and weekends free for my own things . 
  i mean - i love my course and my tutors are so helpful , but endless essays ( roughly one a month , if not one every two weeks ) is * really * starting to grind me down now . 
  i 'm looking forward to june where i can just read for my own pleasure again . 
  sometimes ? 
  try * all * the time . 
  `` how does your so feel when you do [ x ] ? '', 
  you know , i really do n't know , seeing as i 've been single for about a decade . 
  why do n't i go ask my dog instead ? 
   i really do n't think it 's that hard to avoid using gendered slurs . 
  absolutely it 's not , though i 've had comments removed once or twice when i used `` bitch '' without even thinking about what i was writing , like the time i said i 'd be gossiping in a mean way about a badly behaved friend . 
  but you know what i did ? 
  i pulled up my big girl pants , * changed the word * and * messaged the mods * . 
  comment reinstated , mental note made , go and make a cup of tea . 
  job done . 
  it 's truly amazing to see the amount of people who do n't seem able to manage that . 
  i 've got tickets with a friend to see the totally totally fabulous [ derren brown ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-n8cr0lzre ) live tomorrow night and i 'm ** so ** excited . 
  i 've seen him live twice before and he 's just a brilliant showman . 
  it 's going to be so good !, 
  aw yay dog show people !, 
  what 's your breed ? 
  and thank you - it 'll be a loooong day , but it 's going to be loads of fun too . 
  if you want to do the ` go everywhere ' bit without necessarily the local culture immersion bit , look at cruise ship work . 
  you get to travel the world and see and experience so many different countries ( admittedly very briefly ) and get paid for it . 
  i saw around 30 countries in my six month contract with an american line , and although it was hard work it was perfect for the go everywhere traveller in me . 
  from fellowship of the ring . 
  gets me every time . 
   they looked back . 
  dark yawned the archway and of the gates underneath the mountain-shadow . 
  faint and far beneath the earth rolled the slow drum-beats : * doom * . 
  a thin black smoke trailed out . 
  nothing else was to be seen ; the dale all around was empty . 
  * doom . 
  * grief at last wholly overcame them , and they wept long : some standing and silent , some cast upon the ground . 
  * doom , doom . 
  * the drum-beats faded . 
  [ these two ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcnwx0m7pdg ) , donna noble and martha jones from doctor who . 
  i love them both , especially donna . 
  `` donna noble has left the library . 
  donna noble has been saved . '', 
  sooo creepy !, 
  me too !, 
  so she had a crush , so what ?
