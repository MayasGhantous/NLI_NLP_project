  mine 's just a distant fleeting memory from way back in august ... 
  cuddles with my puppy dog . 
  he 's so soft and has the cutest ears , and climbs into your lap for cuddles even though he 's a whacking great english setter and stopped being the right size for my lap a year and a half ago . 
  also , a chunky slice of yummy chocolate fudge cake * always * puts the world to rights again . 
  pinafore dress always sounds adorable . 
  jumper always sounds warm and snuggly . 
  i love the idea of gilets too . 
  it 's not just a bodywarmer , it 's a * gilet * . 
  massive lack of surprise . 
  i always figure since we 've seen government agencies hack into anything and everything in action films for the last decade a la jason bourne , mission impossible and bond , that any reveal of what is * actually * going on lost its shock value ages ago . 
  ... when * is n't * us politics totally whackadoo though ? 
  i read some of the links my american friends post to fb and on here , and it 's just like you * really * did/said/enacted / filibusterwhatevered that ? 
   once i 'm 22 , my youth is truly over forever . 
  oh please . 
  from a 28 almost 29 year old , 22 year olds are still such babyfaces . 
  it 's brilliant that you 're coming out of your shell and owning up to who you really are , but the idea of mourning this ` lost youth ' period is asinine . 
  look forward , not back . 
  this is n't your ` final shot ' in anything . 
  it 's just another weekend . 
  go to the beach , have fun , take the pressure of yourself and relax !, 
  you 'll be fine . 
  [ pharrell `` happy '' ] ( http://youtu.be/y6sxv-suytm ) . 
  it 's so happy !, 
  [ oren lavie `` her morning elegance '' ] ( http://youtu.be/2_hxuhshhmy ) . 
  i just love this song , and i love the video . 
  for some reason , it 's such a morning song , too . 
  it does n't really suit listening to in the evening , just first thing with a hot cup of tea . 
  if you love eileen , you 'll love [ this take off of it ] ( http://youtu.be/inakbl9so10 ) . 
  it 's a duo called frisky and mannish , and they are just brilliant at twisting songs around . 
  i 'm the same and have always had wrist problems which leaves them achey after i do gymnastics . 
  a friend of mine recommended [ tiger paws ] ( http://www.tigerpawwristsupports.com/ ) for wrist supports and they are really , * really * good . 
  they help stop you overextending your wrists , and mine ache so much less now . 
  well , firstly , it 's not correct to say ` women settle ' because i 'm a woman and i certainly do n't settle for anyone or anything . 
  i go into the relationships that are right for me and make me happy . 
  the vast majority of my friends do , too . 
  now why your friend does n't want to go out with you , ( which is really the question you 're asking here ) , is something that i ca n't answer because i do n't know her . 
  maybe she 's insecure and does n't ` feel ' like she deserves a good man . 
  maybe she just does n't fancy you . 
  maybe you 're actually not ` everything she really wants ' ( presumptuous much , by the way ? ) . 
  maybe she 's insecure about being single , and would rather just be in a relationship even if it 's clearly the wrong one . 
  maybe she just wants good sex and she has really , really good sex with this other guy . 
  who knows ? 
  henry [ sits at our breakfast table ] ( http://i.imgur.com/8piynhe ) when he 's feeling cheeky . 
  he 's also the best damn glove hunter you 've ever met . 
  he is * obsessed * with gloves . 
  if my dad is out in the garden going between the garage and shed , henry will go between the two of them and come out constantly with gloves that we did n't even know were * in * there . 
  i 've got no idea how he does it . 
   if someone is really trying to help and care about you when you do n't care about yourself , why would you really want to distance yourself from a positive influence that you seemingly want ? 
  insecurity , pure and simple . 
  i saw your post before you changed it , and if your friend has been abused in relationships before , then the guys she 's dated has probably made her think that she 's not * worth * it . 
  that she 's awful , terrible , undeserving of love , that the only person who loves her and will ever actually appreciate her is that boyfriend . 
  i expect she 's possibly a frightened , insecure person who does n't want to ` ruin ' you with what she thinks she is actually like , so she goes with the next option and clings to what she already has . 
  just a bit panicky - got a 1500 word essay on the roman republic due in tomorrow and i 've done 500 so far . 
  leaving it * slightly * to the last minute ... 
  honestly , you can wish and wish and say `` if only ... '' as much as you like , but if women turn you down because of their issues , then they are * their issues * to work on . 
  you can not fix someone and date them to ` bring out their potential ' . 
  you just have to say `` okay , i 'm here for you '' and let it go . 
  * she * needs to fix this , and she can only do it when she wants to do that . 
  reddit is my essay kryptonite for sure . 
  it does n't help that my module has a really helpful student group who are all asking lots of good questions about the assignment on facebook too !, 
  erk , thanks . 
  i hope so too !, 
  confused . 
  why are they looking at my calves ? 
  what makes my calves * that nice * that they are worth complimenting ? 
  what even * makes * nice calves ? 
  why are they looking at them again ? 
  and why did they choose that bit in particular to compliment me on ? 
  hair , sure , but calves ... ? 
  i eat far too much sugar and chocolate . 
  i still eat other healthy foods and exercise , i just can never say no to chocolate . 
  my eyesight is pretty shoddy , though i do n't always need glasses to see . 
  my back and shoulders constantly , constantly ache , but my immune system is pretty good . 
  i do n't get ill very often at all , and if i do it 's something that fully knocks me out for a day or two and then i just get up and carry on again . 
  river island , next , fat face , joules , barbour , hobbs . 
  i prefer the classic english-country-outdoors kind of style . 
  * likes/loves reading, 
  * active ( in any form , does n't matter whether he swims , runs , plays football , drives cars a lot , whatever . ), 
  * kind, 
  * has a goal in mind of some sort and works towards that, 
  * adventurous . 
  i want to do loads more travelling , so i 'd like someone who wants to go and explore with me . 
  * likes dogs and will not mind a future house full of dogs . 
  * gets along well with my family . 
  well , i would love two or three dogs ( at the most ) at some point , but i like a larger breed , so it would probably feel like a house full . 
  i 've had a few dates with ` nice guys ' but it did n't work out for the same reason as most of these things do n't , we just did n't have chemistry . 
  thinking about it though , i do n't want a ` nice guy ' who will bend over backwards for me , or do anything for me . 
  i do n't have best friends who jump at the drop of my hat or do anything i ask . 
  my parents certainly do n't . 
  why should my boyfriend be that type of person ? 
  mutual give and take seems a far better option to me than a gooey lovey doormat . 
  my friend s is the biggest sweetheart i 've ever met . 
  he 's a true english gentleman - he even wears deerstalkers - and i know at heart he 's just a big soft romantic country boy even though he pretends to be this whizzing sociable city man . 
  my other girl friend e and i always tease him that all he wants is a little welsh country farm with a handsome husband and some sheep . 
  he 'll help you out with anything , always calls me ` sausage ' or ` darling ' and is generally just the cutest thing ever . 
  i love him to bits . 
  yup . 
  i actually went to a music school every saturday for ... four years , i think ? 
  i had lessons in aural music , music theory , a half hour private flute lesson , and played flute and/or piccolo in a wind band and full orchestra up until i was 16 or 17 . 
  loved it , and i actually feel bad for not putting the time aside now to carry on practicing .
