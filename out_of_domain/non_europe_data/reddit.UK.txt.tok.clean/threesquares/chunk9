   ** on a typical friday night i am **, 
  hanging out at hinge or with friends . 
  what 's hinge ? 
  what are you doing with your friends ? 
  what 's the best friday night you 've had with them ? 
  simple is n't cutting it here , i 've got precisely zero things to message you about . 
   ** you should message me if **, 
  you like what you read . 
  dull . 
  dull dull dull . 
  why should a girl message you and not the other ten thousand guys on okc ? 
  what 's so special about you other than you 're tall and you like music ? 
  give me a hook here , please . 
  photos-wise , your profile photo is way too dark . 
  i can hardly see you !, 
  your fourth photo is so much nicer . 
  you should actually be having an easy time of it on here because you 're a good looking guy , but you 've coasted through your profile . 
  also :, 
  * which is bigger ? 
  the earth, 
  really ? 
  * really * ? 
  if you want to marry her ( and she wants to marry you ) , you might well be spending the next seventy years in each others company . 
  let her go to the uni she wants to go to and stop sulking because she made her own independent choice like an adult . 
  look , seriously , you are sounding * incredibly * entitled about the whole thing . 
  yes she should have given you more warning , but at the same time it was incredibly short sighted of you to have apparently prepared your entire life at uni around her being there . 
  she is allowed to change her mind . 
  you should have made a back up plan . 
  stop guilt tripping her about this ridiculous ` betrayal ' malarky , stop playing the woe-is-me card and grow up . 
  and what part of ` commitment ' is n't she upholding , exactly ? 
  commitment does not mean ` dropping everything to do what my so wants without question ' . 
  i 'm 28 and i do n't personally like to date guys less than a year younger than me . 
  it 's very much the little-brother factor as well - my brother is 2 years younger and it would just be too weird to date anyone his age or less . 
  i like to date up to about ten years older , though . 
  i want a rural , country home , preferably a georgian build house ( i love those square proportions and high ceilings ) filled with family and dogs . 
  and books . 
  lots of books . 
  i 'd love a living room with a wood burning fireplace or a wood burning stove . 
  we just have a gas fire at the moment and it 's not the same . 
  my favourite houses have lots of light streaming in and are quite open plan - i love the feeling of space and hate being closed in . 
  different pills affect different women differently . 
  basically : you wo n't know until she 's on them !, 
  i 'm lucky - google my brand of pill and you get all sorts of horror stories about blood clots and extra hair and weight gain and miserable mood swings . 
  i have had none of these . 
  the only mood changes i notice is when i stack my pills ( i.e. 
  take multiple packs back to back ) for more than two months . 
  then i need a hormone break and i 'm back to normal . 
  but if your gf has problems , then go back to the doctors and try another brand . 
  there are loads out there !, 
  we 've always had dogs ( specifically english setters ) but the one i had the best bond with was one called beema who unfortunately passed away a couple of years ago . 
  he was a gorgeous softie who was just all about love and attention and i adored him . 
  now we have henry , who is a very different dog to beema , but at the same time he somehow feels more ` mine ' . 
  i have four best friends . 
  ( lucky me ! ), 
  the first is two years younger than me , and i met her at school when we were 15 . 
  we live in different cities now and only see each other every couple of months but i know she 's always there for me . 
  the second two are also both female who i met at university and who were on a course than ran alongside mine at our ( very small ) uni campus . 
  one i was randomly assigned to live with for my first year , and the other lived just across the way from us . 
  she was so shy !, 
  we gradually helped her come out of her shell but it did pretty much take the whole year for her to really open up to us properly and the three of us all lived together ( plus another guy friend ) for the next two years . 
  i 'd still love to live with both of them again if i got a chance . 
  the last one is american ( i 'm english ) , and i met her through livejournal on a harry potter community . 
  we just started talking pretty much every day and have n't really stopped !, 
  i 'm saving up to go back out to the states and see her again , but it 's going to be about a thousand pounds to do it properly and those kind of funds are sadly sparse for me nowadays . 
  i 'll get there soon enough !, 
  here 's a tip - sometimes things look like they should work . 
  you 're pretty , they 're pretty , you do lots of the same stuff , they tick all the boxes . 
  great , right ? 
  except you try dating them , and it 's not great because you just do n't click . 
  and * thats okay * . 
  you ca n't * make * a relationship work . 
  tell this girl ` thanks but no thanks ' and go enjoy being single for a while . 
  why would you want to date someone who is so easily prepared to cheat on their current partner ? 
  also , why on earth did you decide to kiss her , fully knowing she 's not available ? 
  why did you accept the invitation to stay in her room ? 
  i suspect you guessed exactly what was going to come from that and went with it anyway . 
  you 're both being ridiculous . 
  tell yourself all the platitudes you like about how she 's not really in to her boyfriend and how he does n't treat her well to ease your guilty conscious , but she is * not available * . 
  she told you herself she wished she could date both of you ; i.e. 
  she is not going to break up with him . 
  you know exactly what to do , and you 're asking us about it to make yourself feel better , because you do n't actually want to do it . 
  here 's my advice : walk away . 
  leave her well alone until she 's single . 
  grow up . 
  very true !, 
  op , just stay away . 
  full stop . 
  it is kind of bad right now , but it 's not without redemption . 
  looking at it from an objective angle , he 's not only cheating on his current girlfriend and lying about his sexuality , but you 're also his current dirty little secret to make himself feel better . 
  you 're worth so much more than that . 
  if he does everything he says within the timeframe he says ( but maybe allow a week extra for last minute nerves ) then i 'd say give it a shot . 
  if he keeps stringing you along after a fortnight saying `` i will come out / i will break up with her , i swear . '', 
  then walk away . 
  you need to date someone who is going to be committed to * you * and absolutely open about dating you , not someone who 's going to hide you away just so he can have his cake and eat it . 
  best of luck . 
  if there were in some box somewhere , it 's hardly like she was keeping them tucked away in a memento box to swoon over during rainy nights . 
  she probably does n't even remember she has them . 
  i imagine that even though she can see the pros and cons of moving the trips , she probably feels like as soon as she suggested she would have to change dates you were * straight * on the phone to your friend about the trip . 
  she probably feels a bit like you were just waiting for an excuse to go on the vegas trip instead of seeing her . 
  can you see how that would upset her ?
