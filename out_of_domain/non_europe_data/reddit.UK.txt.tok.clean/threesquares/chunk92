  give me your details and we 'll sort it out . '', 
  i got six years work from that in one of the best venues on the edinburgh fringe , and i could probably still call them up there this summer and go back there if i wanted . 
  i got the war horse work because i said i would work for free on a church concert , and a friend of the organiser at the church was the production manager on war horse so he offered me a few days work as a thank you . 
  almost got tech swing on that one actually but i had to turn it down because i already had work booked somewhere else . 
  the friend of mine who works on coronation st had put a little note out on facebook the other day asking for keen costume assistants for a few days work . 
  another guy was asking if anyone knew a keen sound guy to pick up some tour work last week . 
  someone else was looking today for techs to work at their fringe venue this summer and asking for names . 
  anyway , the moral of that really is just to always say yes to potential work , even if it seems crappy and low key because you never know who might be working on it and what else they do too . 
  my only other bit of advice is to work in the job while you love it until you do n't love it any more . 
  it 's something that you have to be passionate about , because it really does suck the life out of you sometimes . 
  best of luck !, 
  it 's funny , i know so many people who kind of just fall into the job but then do so well at it and go do it for years on end . 
  and you 're right , i just love calling shows . 
  i never really got to do it properly , but just sitting on the book in rehearsals with the actors was so much fun . 
  there 's just something magical about an empty stage right before a show , is n't there ? 
  also just to add , i do n't know what the job market is like in the us , but over here permanent jobs as a tech in theatres are few and far between . 
  my life was all about freelancing for several years and i was constantly shuttling between jobs . 
  i know of ... ten people with permanent work ? 
  three of those are in the admin and organisational side . 
  one is a technical manager , four are technicians . 
  get very intimate with your cv ( resume ? ), 
  if you want to be a tech . 
  you 'll be seeing a lot of it . 
  no problem !, 
  good luck with everything !, 
  yeah , that was what happened to me . 
  i loved it and still do , but i just totally burnt out on the stupid hours , lack of stability and lack of money . 
  i needed holidays and weekends !, 
  i 'd happily lend a hand doing a get in/get out or a rig every now and again but i would n't go back to it full time . 
  you have to do it while you have the energy and the love . 
  so she slept with someone else . 
  big deal . 
  she 's twenty five years old , and since she was 21 she 's been with one guy . 
  you 're only fussing over this because you know more about her last relationship than you did with your last girlfriend , so you 're personifying him as an actual person rather than just ` an ex ' . 
  he 's got an actual face and a name , but that does n't make him any more important than you . 
  in short , she does n't want to sleep with him anymore . 
  he 's not in the picture . 
  you are . 
  if you find yourself thinking about him , redirect your thoughts back to your new girl instead . 
  you either have to get over it or go and find someone else instead . 
  i would shove past them and carry on walking , then go and hide in a shop to make sure they were n't following me . 
  ugh my bag has so much crap in it , it 's unreal . 
  off the top of my head , right now it has in it :, 
  * purse with debit/credit cards , loyalty cards , driving license and a little bit of cash in . 
  * keys, 
  * tide timetable ( the road to get to my village floods frequently ), 
  * study textbooks and some associated paperwork, 
  * shitloads of receipts, 
  * payslips, 
  * 3d cinema glasses ( just in case ), 
  * spare car keys, 
  * pens/highlighters, 
  * kindle, 
  * glasses, 
  * microfibre cloth for glasses, 
  * hand cream, 
  * bottle and carton of juice, 
  * tissues, 
  * spare dog lead, 
  * deodorant, 
  * small amount of cash, 
  * oyster card, 
  * lip balm/lipstick, 
  * pill packet, 
  * earphones, 
  * starbucks loyalty card . 
  i 'm amazed my shoulder does n't fall off sometimes . 
  i walked straight into a job as a lighting technician for a scottish events company . 
  i was there for about a year and it was fun but not life-defining by any means , though it was in the right industry . 
  the wage was just above the minimum required to live in edinburgh , it was full time work with some overtime involved . 
  liked it , did n't love it , mostly went freelance after i left . 
  open ones . 
  i generally like to ask stuff related to hobbies or entertainment stuff . 
  are you reading any good books at the moment/did you see ____ on the telly last night/any holiday plans for the year/hasn ' t it been warm lately ? 
  i 've only ever shaved my bikini line , never waxed . 
  i did use to wax my eyebrows , but stopped that a couple of years ago when i was on a medication that made my skin really sensitive , and one waxing left me with minor burns all round my eyebrows . 
  definitely not worth the few weeks of shaped brows . 
  i pluck and thread eyebrows now , use a hair removal cream on my top lip and shave everywhere else . 
  i 'll stick a couple in there if i 'm heading out for a night or on a date , but otherwise there 's not much point for me . 
  most of my company these days is in the shape of my loving , but ultimately rather romantically useless puppy dog . 
  / r/tomhiddleston . 
  obviously . 
  not concerned either way . 
  fb is handy and comes up with some interesting stuff sometimes but if they do n't have one for whatever reason it 's no skin off of my back . 
  a relaxed dinner party with good friends , fun conversation and loads of bottles of wine out . 
  i love a good summer garden party too , with cute dresses , relaxed music , cupcakes , barbeques and jugs of pimms sat out . 
  well i 'm english so his accent is ordinary to me . 
  he 's just so handsome , an * incredibly * talented actor and he seems so sweet . 
  he brought a journalist hot tomato soup at a cold premiere . 
  he did an advert with the * cookie monster * . 
  he took over comic-con as loki !, 
  i mean , seriously . 
  the guy has everything . 
  hmmm . 
  i do n't know .

  no , hate them .
