  ummm let 's see . 
  having a quick look at my emails , i initially wrote to the agency who hired me on in 2007 , so my memory is a bit rusty . 
  the visa process for me was reasonably straightforward as the agency did most of the legwork . 
  i did have to have medical tests ( including blood tests ) completed and spent a day at the american embassy in london waiting in a lot of queues to get approval done . 
  it looks like the agency were talking to me in feb 08 about my medical being approved , and i joined the ship in late august , so it was about a six months wait all in all . 
  the line paid for my flight there and back , but i did pay the agency commission for hiring me so it was n't all expense free . 
  i was paid in cash onboard but most people redirected at least some of their pay into accounts . 
  it looks like my cover letter was quite short and brisk - as i went in as a theatre technician i really just gave detailed of the uni course i 'd just finished , the areas i 'd worked in and the rough number of productions i had experience on . 
  i 'd probably recommend refocusing your cover letter and cv on customer service jobs - like i said , it 's a big floating hotel , so you need to think about how you 'd apply to work at a hilton or marriott . 
  i had friends who were concierge , travel desk , bartenders , beauty therapists , casino workers , dance/entertainment hosts , youth workers ... all sorts of things . 
  make your application customer focused , not business focused . 
  they want people who can face guests all day every day for six months at a time without a break and still do it all with a smile . 
  and i do n't mind answering questions at all . 
   ask anything , it 's always fun to talk about life onboard . 
  it 's very different to anything else you 'll ever get to do , that 's for sure !, 
  i went through an agency who specifically hired on for entertainment crew , so see if you can do that too . 
  ships always need broadcast techs so i think you 're in for a good chance , but they are looking for practical ability , so emphasise that . 
  basically , they want someone who can walk onboard , do a two week handover with the guy before them and then operate everything themselves efficiently for the next six months . 
  a year at a news station sounds great , and keep getting in that practical experience in the meantime . 
  it looks like it was a bit over two weeks between me sending my cv to the agency and them inviting me for interview , and it was just under a year after that before i joined the ship . 
  edit : i was also offered a job with royal caribbean after my regent contract , and it looks like i emailed them in february 09 and heard back in may 09 about an interview , so it does vary . 
  just keep plugging away !, 
  probably !, 
  all the lines need kitchen staff . 
  like i said , massive floating hotel with several hundred guests on . 
  there are at least two restaurants onboard even on the smallest lines and then all the crew need to be fed too . 
  for sure hipsters exist - just hit up shoreditch ( well . . maybe five years ago ) , hackey , dalston or peckham in london . 
  they 're all over the sodding place . 
  well . 
  i 'm not sure about peckham , but i * hear * it 's the new dalston , so it must be the right place for hipsters to descend . 
  play a game with my dog . 
  just having a game of tug or throwing a ball for him while he runs around like a loony always cheers me up . 
  there is nothing more cute than [ english setter puppies ] ( http://www.webmastergrade.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/animal-group-03.jpg ) . 
  the [ flippy floppy ears ] ( http://images3.champdogs.net/orig/l13101p3.jpg ) get me every time . 
  awwwwww !, 
  still soooo cute , but [ not as cute as us !,

  me too !, 
  i 'm so excited to get it in my hands !, 
  wow . 
  as a lady , i 'd generally describe your style as ` texas ' . 
  you just need the ten gallon hat and you 're done . 
  i think you 'll find things are a bit more muted over here , generally . 
  try shops like topman , or maybe things like urban outfitters and uniqlo might be more to your taste . 
  mostepanovafan is a great gymnastics youtube user with some videos that i think would really help with what you 're looking for .

  there 's loads more linked in the side bar , but hopefully those will get you started . 
  well , what 's changed ? 
  you 're saying he 's got experience so clearly he 's worked before - what 's going on to make him so apathetic towards it now ? 
  could he possibly be depressed ? 
  sitting around playing games all day and not helping in the house at all sounds like he could be . 
  and yes - if the person i loved was refusing to help pull their weight in the relationship , was n't working and was n't doing anything domestic either i would leave them . 
  i would want to be a * partner * , not a skivvy . 
  towels . 
  my dog loves towels . 
  he 'll always pinch a tea towel from the side to give us as a ` gift ' when we come home and must have destroyed at least four now . 
  give him a towel and he 's happy for days . 
  kiss kiss bang bang . 
  it 's a * brilliant * film with such slick humour , but it never really crops up in conversations at all . 
  that kind of surprises me as it 's very much downey jr playing a prototype tony stark without the money or gadgets . 
  love layer cake so damn much . 
  it 's a great film . 
  i turned 29 on friday !, 
  on my actual birthday i went for a spa day with my best friend which included lunch , express facials , time in the pool/steam room/sauna , reading , snoozing , gossipping and generally having the most relaxing day ever . 
  on saturday i spent it all with a group of close friends at a great teahouse then went back to one of their houses , had gin and tonics and played board games with them all evening . 
  today i 've just been to london with my mum for a morning shopping in harrods and an afternoon tea at the four seasons hotel which was * swank * . 
  it 's been the best birthday i can remember for years . 
  my dad quite often makes uncomfortable jokes , so i think he 'd be super cool when i brought the guy over but might be quite reserved about who i picked in private . 
  i suspect he 'd probably take a while to really truly relax about it . 
  my mum might be a bit surprised at first but gets along well with everyone so would n't be bothered as long as i was happy . 
  edit : outside our nationality would be totally fine . 
  no issues at all . 
  i 'm not interested in guys with shirtless pictures . 
  i assume they 're far too cocky for my tastes . 
  not really . 
  there are always women who enjoy flings and one night stands . 
  you might as well say ` is it safe to say men as a whole are looking for superficial hookups ? ' . 
  you ca n't blanket approach these things . 
  really ? 
  you would blanket all men , living or dead , as solely interested in sex and not in romance or monogamy ? 
  well , okay then , if you insist ... 
  we find uniforms very normal . 
  you moved here , you adjust . 
  once your children reach sixth form then they probably wo n't be required to wear uniform , but up until then you 'll just have to get used to it . 
  take the option with the job , accommodation and income and while you 're there look at the option that does n't have any of those . 
  edinburgh is an amazing * amazing * city and you can find a flat really easily through gumtree and probably pick up a hostel job pretty quickly too , but it 's silly to throw away a guaranteed base while you find your feet . 
  you can probably get a return for # 40 on easyjet between edinburgh and stansted if you book it far enough it advance . 
  i went to uni in edinburgh and would get cheap flights to go back home to essex all the time . 
  it 's never going to work . 
  we 're just not bothered enough about it .
