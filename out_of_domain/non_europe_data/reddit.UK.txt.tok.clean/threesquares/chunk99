  if there is only one person that 's ever right for you , then realistically what are the chances that that person turns out to live within your geographical area at the same time and ( roughly ) same age as you ? 
  for me , i 'm not looking for a ` soulmate ' , i 'm looking for the most compatible person that exists for me . 
  there are probably a hundred of them out there in my country right now , i just have n't found them yet . 
  on the same line , ideas of the best person for you are great , but do n't be rigid about it . 
  what if your soulmate hates camping ? 
  or spontaneity ? 
  or likes trash tv , but they are one hundred percent compatible with you in every other way ? 
  personally i also kind of find this line a bit odd :, 
   you understand how rare this is and how lucky we both are to have each other in our lives . 
  is it rare ? 
  really ? 
  finding someone you 're in love with ? 
  people fall in love and marry other people every day . 
  you finding a great partner and being compatible is n't rare at all - in fact , i 'd say it 's pretty common . 
  you 're just having a great time with it , is all . 
  i 'd love to see a scene with jaime lannister and hoid . 
  it would be like jamie trying to swat a particularly irritating , particularly * correct * kind of fly . 
  i 'll freely admit it , i do n't reply to a lot of things . 
  much of the time i do n't reply to some of my best friends . 
  it 's not to be mean , and it 's not for any reason at all . 
  mostly it 's just because i 'll look at my phone , see the text and go `` oh , i 'll answer that later . '', 
  and i honestly * mean * to ( or sometimes i do n't , it depends on who it is ) and then i never actually do . 
  sometimes that 's because i do n't have the time or inclination to answer straight away , sometimes because i just do n't know the right way to answer . 
  and then i forget to answer it , or even that the friend texted me in the first place . 
  i had a spa day for my birthday a week or so ago , and came out of the day feeling like wibbly wobbly girlie jelly . 
  i was so relaxed . 
  it was * wonderful * . 
  if it 's one of my friends and we 're making plans then by all means send me an `` oi , so what are we doing ? '', 
  text . 
  i do it all the time to my friends who do n't answer and some friends will text me whenever about something else and drop in a little comment about how i 'm rubbish at texting . 
  which i am , i admit it !, 
  if it 's a date , then maybe leave it until a few days before you 're due to meet and then send something quite light to ask if they still wanted to come along to whatever you had planned . 
  do n't pester them about it , though . 
  benefit 's lemon aid . 
  it 's an eyelid primer and it 's * fabulous * . 
  i use it every single day and one pot lasts me at least a year , probably more . 
  it acts as a base for your eyeshadow/eyeliner to go on , and i 'll use a dab of it as undereye concealer as well for those late night shadows . 
  basically it 's wonderful , and i hope benefit never ever stop making it because if they do i will buy out the rest of their supply to last me until i die . 
  go buy it !, 
  you are for such a treat with liveship traders and tawny man . 
  tm has to be my all time favourite series - so heartbreaking and so , so wonderful . 
  cambridge is a short train ride away and is gorgeous . 
  you can wander around the colleges and see some of the most beautiful architecture in the country . 
  oxford is another good option . 
  bath is also insanely beautiful with stunning countryside to take long walks around in . 
  i would also recommend edinburgh , but it 'll be a little late to get cheap flights or train tickets up there now . 
  history , specifically english history covering the tudors , elizabethans and georgians , and roman history . 
  i could talk about history all day long , i love it !, 
  also , dog showing . 
  it 's my favourite hobby and i love getting to spend the day surrounded by gorgeous dogs while also getting to spend loads of time with mine . 
  heavenly . 
  * heavenly * . 
  my absolute favourite spas ever ever ever are the [ world of spa aqua sana ] ( http://youtu.be/fq73kliwkqg ) in center parcs . 
  they have twelve different spa rooms you can wander around , including steam rooms , saunas , salt baths , meditation rooms and water bed areas where you can just lie down and read a book or magazine . 
  i adore them and always come out of them afterwards feeling sooooo good . 
  i adore massages , and honestly a massage done properly is * so * relaxing . 
  an hour sometimes does n't feel like enough !, 
  maybe have a look and see if there are any 2 for 1 deals going so you can bring your friend or your mum ? 
  you might feel a little odd going by yourself but going with someone else is always fun . 
  robin hobb , of course . 
  i always really really enjoy karen miller 's characters and loved her innocent mage , awakened mage and blighted mage series . 
  madeline miller 's * song of achilles * is ** wonderful ** too , and i think it can slip in there under the fantasy mark as it 's all about the greek myths of achilles and patroclus . 
  just gorgeous writing . 
  you 've got to have a [ stark industries ] ( http://i.ebayimg.com/t/stark-industries-iron-man-avengers-fun-mug-/00/s/mtiwmfgxnjaw/z/x1caamxqtt9rsgyw/$t2ec16d,!yge9s7hkkzbbrsgywmr,q~~60_35.jpg ) mug . 
  what a bizarre thing to do . 
  it 's an english fair , but one of the most interesting fairs that you might find documentation for are the frost fairs that took place on the thames , particularly one in 1684 . 
  there have been a few occasions up until the early 1800s where the winter temperatures in london dipped low enough to freeze the thames , allowing the enterprising citizens of london to set up frost fairs on the frozen river with tents , markets , sledging , archery and all kinds of activites going on . 
  my particular favourite woodprint is [ this one ] ( http://inflightmovie.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/frostfair1220x1509.gif ) of the 1684 frost fair with a description attached , which lists off all kinds of things that londoners could do on the ice . 
  it lasted around two months or so ( december 1683 to february 1684 ) so there was quite a lot set up there . 
  you can also find that image listed as great britain 's wonder ; or ; london 's admiration in the [ british museum collection ] ( http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectid=1525079&amp;partid=1 ) and [ this blog ] ( http://mercuriuspoliticus.wordpress.com/2008/12/28/the-1683-4-frost-fair/ ) has a listing of alternative images with their source links back to the british museum collection , which is handy . 
  from the great britain 's wonder image i quite like the poem lines `` there may you also this hard frosty winter / see on the rocky ice a working-printer , / who hopes by his own art to reap some gain / which he perchance think he may obtain . 
  / here is also a lottery and a musick too / yea , a cheating , drunken , leud and * debauch 'd crew * . 
  / hot codlins , pancakes , duck , goose and sack / rabbit , capon , hen , turkey and a wooden jack . '', 
  you 've also got listed various pubs set up on the ice including `` the flying piss-pot '' , the `` whip and egg-shell '' and `` the broom '' , bull and bear baiting , football , sledging , horse riding , roasted ox , fox hunts , skipping ( dancing o ' th ' ropes ) , puppet plays and all sorts of shopping . 
  other woodprints show people playing nine-pins , a boat being drawn across the ice by horses , stilt walking and of course all kinds of ice skating . 
  alternatively , i quite like [ this petulant , poignant little note ] ( http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/72554000/jpg/_72554537_notice.jpg ) from 1814 : where you , j frost , have by force and violence taken possession of the river thames i hearby give you notice to quit immediately . 
  you 've given your opinion , other people have given their opinion . 
  she 's listened to all of them . 
  now you need to back off and leave her to it , because it 's her hair , not yours . 
  you do n't get to decide how she looks . 
  you just need two things ; motivation to get where you want ( the nice sixth form ) and a revision method that works for you that helps make learning things easy . 
  revision does n't mean just writing things out endlessly - try drawing silly cartoons of what you 're learning or make up poems or mnemonics or songs about them to help you remember and sing them to yourself . 
  record things to cd and listen back to them when you 're doing chores or generally pottering about . 
  the more bizarre and fun your method of learning is , the more likely you are to remember it . 
  derren brown in particular has great memory methods for learning lots of information . 
  keep your goal in mind - put a picture of the sixth form or your ideal university up in your room and remind yourself that those are what you 're aiming for . 
  it 's short term graft for long term goals . 
  you 'll thank yourself in sixth months time for putting your head down now and just getting it done . 
  by the way , i do know where you 're coming from - i 'm 29 and currently doing a whole new degree with exams in june . 
  it means i have a years worth of revision to do all through may . 
  it 's not easy , but i slog through it because it 's something that i * want * to achieve . 
  you just have to keep your aims in mind . 
  i 'm 29 . 
  i have like ... one teeny tiny wrinkle under one of my eyes and that 's about it . 
  i 've lucked out so far , and i do wonder if it 's partially down to the acne i had for years . 
  either way , i do n't smoke or tan ( i try and stay in the shade ) , rarely drink alcohol , and always cleanse and moisturise . 
  i 'm trying to up my water intake , too . 
  seems to be working so far !, 
  agreed . 
  the only good marmite is still-in-the-jar marmite , preferably stuffed at the back of the cupboard .
