  you 're a terrible person . 
  germany , the uk and france put together have less people than the us - they also give more . 
   when ** northerns ** say ` the south ' they hardly think of lands end , dover or the isle of white , it 's always london people think of . 
   minimum wage laws are still bad, 
  why should society subsidise large business payrolls ? 
  if tesco is paying less than a living wage then its workers are more reliant on the state for assistance . 
  you do n't just get to wave your hands and say ` government is bad ' . 
  i do n't see how you can claim that wage regulation is coercive any more than property rights are coercive , or road building programs are coercive , or contract law is coercive . 
  if you want to make the argument that any collective action is immoral then that 's one thing but i fear your definition of coercive action/non coercive action is arbitrary - as in mine . 
  we are , therefore only arguing about the degree of coercion we find appropriate . 
  then you must agree that property rights , a form of government assistance , are coercive ? 
  yeah - that 's exactly the point . 
  property rights are a infringement , but a useful infringement . 
  now , i 've got no problem with property rights and it does n't seem you do either . 
  my argument is - we both agree that property rights are ok , so we must therefore both agree that in some circumstances personal liberties are morally infringe-able . 
  that means you ca n't meanfully make any moral argument against state assistance since you seem quite happy to base our entire economic model around it . 
  we 're left , then , with an argument about the policy benefits or drawbacks of the minimum wage - the realm of statistics and evidence and not philosophical tropes . 
   we built for you . 
  you did n't do shit , son . 
  you can force the update if you want . 
  clear the data on an app called `` google services framework '' and try the update again . 
  ** edit : you probably should n't do this . 
  no , sorry - what i meant is ** you ** did n't do anything . 
  there 's no ` we ' here . 
  you are not responsible for your forefathers success or failure . 
  it 'd be like claiming `` we '' [ took over england ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/norman_conquest_of_england ), 
  what exactly does it break - i did it and i 'm not having any problems ? 
  you < < person : : girlfriend.new ( : blonde , you.birthday.year - 5 . years ) if self.understood _ by ? 
  ( you ), 
  the lack of a ` this ' in ruby makes this a bit clumsy . 
  the sound of sonic drowning will get you up http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yw5jkahgme, 
  thanks , jet stream !, 
  love and kisses , europe . 
  there was an update - this does n't happen any more . 
  they added a setting to longpress the right button to bring up a menu . 
  fuck those things and the bits of rubber which will be lost just before a long train journey . 
  because there 's a finite amount of money ? 
  and what an excellent job you 're doing . 
  but a stem job creates something , surely ? 
  research is a real thing , medical help is a real thing . 
  middle management , not so much . 
  depends how you look at it . 
  these large , tax avoiding , companies gain plenty of benefits from a civilization they 're trying their best not to pay for . 
  and this is why we ca n't have nice things . 
  the us pop is 313.9 while the uk 's is 63.23 million . 
  even with the larger us population the murder rate per 100,000 people is still way higher . 
  1.2 in the uk vs 4.7 in the us . 
  i do n't see why that 's worth noting - as if they 've got anything to do with each other . 
  yes, 
  source : from dagenham, 
  to be fair , for a long time , ie was better than netscape . 
  oh , give it a rest . 
  his constituency are clearly fine with him . 
  he only costs you # 0.0011066 a year . 
  do you live in his constituency ? 
   people hating on ie are the web devs, 
  so , people who professionally develop for the web almost universally dislike a particular web browser . 
  yep , better ignore them - what do they know . 
  the reason , i reckon , is three fold . 
  netflix deploys it 's own local caching servers available for any isp to use . 
  basically , it brings the netflix content closer to the person who 's going to be using it , meaning the video has both a shorter distance to travel and is less dependent on the already congested main internet backbone . 
  secondly , youtube has a _ lot _ more content . 
  large web applications like youtube and netflix will keep things in a fast cache . 
  the thing about fast caches is that they tend to be limited in size . 
  it does n't make sense to keep low traffic video in a limited size cache when there are higher traffic videos that could be served from there so those videos will be placed on slower , but much higher capacity , hardware - like a hdd . 
  eli5 : you ca n't play with all your toys at once , so some of them get put in the attic while the onces you use all the time will be in your toybox ( or , indeeed , all over the floor ), 
  netflix has less video in total and on average each video has more views than a youtube video - so it 's able to keep more relevent content in a cache at any given time . 
  lastly , i 'd suspect that netflix being a video streaming service is very sensitive to video speed issues . 
  google less so because they 've got other stuff to be pumping money into . 
  what a load of crap, 
  drastically up the minimum wage . 
  every worker that tesco only pays # 6.31 an hour is subsidised by the treasury . 
  think i 'd rather than than economic collapse . 
  all whippets , coal miners and gravy, 
  i love that this supposedly less oppressive map still uses that dreadful projection that makes greenland look like it 's the size of africa . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gall%e2%80%93peters_projection is much more reasonable . 
  do n't let the door hit you on the way out, 
  ukip are the english tea party, 
  reality has a well known liberal bias . 
  eventually , you do . 
  i 'm not that bringing $ 5 a day jobs to the uk is particularly good for anyone . 
  i do n't see why you 'd want chinese jobs here . 
  i think you overstate the premium of ` made in britain ' . 
  you 'd have to match the chinese on price with is n't possible without either a massive wage drop or a massive increase in the price of shipping . 
  set up guard and rspec and start writing some tests . 
  too costly ? 
  too prone to massive malfunctions ? 
  too 80 's ? 
  unless you actually use it for work . 
  i once tried developing on ubuntu . 
  never again . 
  that 's fine , but we deploy to linux servers of various types - osx is the closest we can get to that on the desktop without clawing our eyes out . 
  do n't get me wrong , linux is amazing but just not on my laptop . 
  hike the minimum wage and get rid of working tax credits . 
  i should n't be subsiding tesco 's pay roll and we could use the money to build schools , hospitals and other useful things . 
  i 'd recommend having a read through his book . 
  the jokes take to page quite well . 
  do n't read it on a kindle - he 's gone out of his way to make that difficult . 
  you 've got to be kidding . 
  ukip , ukip , ukip and the torygraph .
