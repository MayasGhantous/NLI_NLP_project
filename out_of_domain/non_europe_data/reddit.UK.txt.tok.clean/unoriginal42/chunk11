  i do n't know how much of this can be attributed to a ` left wing/anti-conservative agenda ' ( whatever that means ) . 
  the tories are in power and so much of the political commentary will be criticism of their policies and politics - as is always the case when a party is in power . 
  yes , you 're quite right . 
  rail privatization has been a massive success . 
  so brave, 
  what a load of dross . 
  there was never a community here to begin with - from what i remember this was a dead subreddit . 
  but , it was a pub before then ? 
  the only thing more insufferable than the constant ukip posting is the right wing persecution complex that comes with it . 
  turns out you ca n't say romanians are naturally criminal and avoid downvotes . 
  shocker . 
  they 'll do fuck all , be obstructionist and we 'll , ironically , have less say in european law that does affect us . 
  your right wing persecution complex is showing, 
  maybe they should fuck off back to where they came from then, 
  i 'd like to join labour , thank you . 
   ( unless you live in the middle of a city ) . 
  at which point you double the housing cost, 
  this is some pandering bullshit, 
   labour 's leftist agenda . 
  pull the other one . 
  there goes the nhs, 
  apart from being a bit of a bigot - what 's your problem with this ? 
  drink and be merry . 
  first year does n't really count - get that 40 % then enjoy yourself . 
  you 'll want to check . 
  i went to sussex and my final grade was from the second two years with the first being a binary  40pc thing . 
  you 'll be in for a nasty surprises if you slack too hard but i would seriously suggest enjoying your first year as much as you can . 
  oh , give it a rest - there 's 300 million of you . 
  i had the same thing . 
  got a new unit for unrelated insurance reasons and it 's been fine . 
  did you get yours just after it came out ? 
  woosh, 
  and that 's exactly why we ca n't have nice things . 
  people moan and cry about how personality politics is replacing policy politics - but then proceed to make fun of the guy for looking like he might have read a book . 
  so much effort with so little result . 
  in what way is gay marriage like polygamy ? 
  as is straight marriage . 
  surely you 're not trying to imply that gay marriage is something unnatural or taboo ? 
  the uniforms would be fabulous . 
  uh , more / r/uk ( ip ) politics, 
  meh , the appeal is the hardware as much as the software . 
  who the hell wants to walk around with a dell laptop ? 
   do you truly believe it 's right that 36 % of people can vote in a union half of them vote to strike and the whole school system is stopped costing everyone else is fair ? 
  i do n't understand this . 
  people join a union , that union chooses to strike , they strike . 
  workers are free to ignore the strike and free to leave the union if they choose to . 
  it 's nothing to do with anyone that is n't a member of the union . 
  in the eu elections every vote counts - it 's proportionally dished out . 
  your right wing persecution complex is showing . 
  yeah , why do n't they move to that readily available cheap housing ? 
  i 'm sure they wont have to spend a couple of hundred pounds of moving expenses ? 
  they should just stop being poor . 
  so there is n't a cronic lack of affordable housing ? 
  who is editing  2mb files ? 
   reddit tends to be overwhelmingly left-leaning, 
  yeah , i 'll give you that . 
  this subreddit though ? 
  i think you 're assuming that there 's people waiting in smaller houses wishing those people in the larger ones would just leave . 
  i do n't think that 's the case . 
  yeah , i suppose . 
  i very rarely end up looking at them beyond a tail - f, 
  different strokes . 
  with ed miliband 's comments and the lib-dem tweet i think it 's now a ukpolitics issue . 
  neither side is in the right here - which is something i think this article correctly captures . 
  well , you 've got a downvote button if you do n't like it . 
  itt : temporarily embarrassed millionaires . 
  and not one of them has a hope in hell of getting elected . 
  why is this here ? 
  i 'd be more excited if there was a proper atm in the north laine, 
  i 'm on the cusp of buying a r9 290 - should i wait ? 
  their rise in the polls is irrelevant . 
  they 'll never get any more seats than ** nowhere ** because most of the electorate could n't care less about ** europe ** , they care about issues that actually effect them like ** the environment ** and the economy . 
  the electorate does n't care about where their ** workers ** comes from as long as it 's there and potentially cheaper and the only way of making ** workers ** cheaper is adopting ** a liberal immigration policy ** , which ** ukip ** oppose . 
  ** ukip ** are even more insane ideologues than ** the greens ** are with even less reasonable policies . 
  i accept the poll . 
  what i would say , however , is that with ukip sitting at what , 12 % , percent they 're hardly a national force either . 
  and yet the media , and this sub is absolutely chocked full of ukip stories . 
  i also take issue with the idea that the greens are only about green issues . 
  they 've got a economic policies that the left wishes labour had the balls the adopt . 
  every day . 
  this is so boring . 
   it 'd be nice to see more people concerned about their freedoms . 
  what a silly thing to say . 
  the libertarian view of freedom is in no way universal . 
  right , so what you should have said is :, 
  `` why do n't people care about my specific and narrow definition of freedom '', 
  if your world view is so simplistic as to be able to define something like this then , well , good for you i suppose . 
  this is almost a textbook case of why direct democracy is a terrible idea . 
  yeah , it 's amazing what constant media exposure will do . 
  you do n't have to be poor to vote ukip . 
  you do have to be ( a little bit ) racist . 
  where are you getting these numbers from ? 
  8 million poor - sure . 
  8 million poor ukip sympathisers - pull the other one . 
  i mean , we 're talking about a party here that supports a flat tax . 
  self styled libertarians who propose a voucher system for the nhs . 
  even if i granted you that ukip are the party of the poor i 'm not sure why you think it shields them or their supporters from criticism . 
  it 's the press . 
  if you want to know my ukip has so much support it 's because for the last year they 've been mentioned at every opertunity and given endless free publicity by every national newspaper . 
  it 's much easier to run headlines like `` send foreign benefit cheats home '' and sell papers than `` realign energy mix and reduce carbon output '',
