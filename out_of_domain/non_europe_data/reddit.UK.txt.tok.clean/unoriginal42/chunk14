  ** political earthquake **, 
  they should test their voters first, 
  proof that facebook is for old people, 
   only black people can represent the interests of black people . 
  no one is saying that - stop trying so hard to be offended . 
  black voters have the lowest voter registration among ethnic groups . 
  i do n't see how anyone could be against sorting that out . 
  kippers are n't bad people , but i would n't want to live next door to one . 
  to quote :, 
   i was asked if a group of romanian men moved in next to you , would you be concerned ? 
  and if you lived in london , i think you would be . 
  labour did this almost 20 years ago ... 
  personally , i 've found gta5 to be more cpu bound than most games . 
  i 'd upgrade that first, 
  or more people tuned in to see a angry little englander lash out , again . 
  that 's a very easy thing to say when you 're young . 
  when will someone represent the interests of well of white people ? 
  `` if you 're a conservative when you 're young , you have no heart . 
  if you 're not a conservative when you 're older , you have no brain '' - or so the widely quoted saying goes . 
  better let the professor know . 
  projectmayhem666 did a whole extra year of study after a degree and he 's calling him out . 
  well , that 's so obvious as not to warrant mentioning , surely ? 
  most scientist are wrong most of the time , it 's how the science happens . 
   most muslims have pretty repugnant views, 
  coming from a fucking kipper . 
  this subreddit is amazing . 
  well , save a playlist offline then ? 
  if you 're a programmer and you need a unix tool chain then they 're a godsend . 
  nothing like a bit of right wing blood lust, 
  so edgey, 
  oh , that must mean all bengali 's are the same then ? 
  i disagree with him on a load of things . 
  that 's fine . 
  what i ca n't stand is the perpetual victim complex and tendency to see big conspiracies in everything . 
  if he really believe what he writes here then he 's got to cut this sort of shit out :, 
   it is almost as bad as new labour 's secret decision to transform the country with migrants . 
  for someone who just wants to have a political discussion he 's very quick to claim his opponents are malicious . 
  ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2384272/peter-hitchens-dont-blame-immigrants--arent-ones-wrecking-britain.html ), 
  let 's not pretend it 's a black and white issue . 
  the gamergate people should n't have sent rape threats . 
  the ` journalists ' should n't have been so dodgy . 
  i 'm not saying gamergate people are rapist misogynists , i 'm also not saying there are n't good game journalists . 
  everyone is covered in shit in the shitfight . 
   jettison the marxist element, 
  just how right wing do you have to be to consider the sdp marxist ? 
  i 've managed to get up to 3.6 - but the motherboard is n't the best and it 's unstable at anything higher . 
  where is the bottleneck for gaming atm . 
  where would something like a 980 be bottlenecked , if at all ? 
  i think i had +0.1 set on the mobo , so about 1.3 - different tools reported different voltages which i found a bit concerning . 
  i 've got a 280x and i had similar drops in gta as you , it sounds like . 
  yeah - when i do a rebuild i 'd like to have it last for a good long while so i can upgrade the gpu half way through as i did this time . 
  thanks , i 'll give it another pop . 
  as i up the voltage when is the point that it becomes dangerous ? 
  or will it refuse to boot if over volted ? 
   there 's no way way he 's getting re-elected, 
  two cards do n't need to be the same for them to be crossfired, 
  i say we hunt , and then brutally rip apart with dogs , all small animals . 
  for employment , you know ? 
  torment an animal for sport or become a criminal ? 
  is that really the choice faced in the countryside ? 
  bloody socialists , not giving people houses on the backs of the taxpayer . 
  wait , what ? 
  knows about guinness, 
  this is low effort even for order order, 
  you should know that they 're prioritised behind o2 users . 
  i was on giffgaff for a while and i 'd have full signal and dreadful speeds - and that was in london . 
  what exactly are these companies supposed to compete on ? 
  is it any surprise they 're engaging in this bullshit when there 's no difference between a british gas electron and a scottish power one ? 
  well , considering we 're pretty much wrong about everything else i think we can safely ignore the 56 %, 
  that 's the thing . 
  if the client agrees to take a haircut on what they want you can get 95 % of the site on a quarter of the budget . 
  at that point you 're describing a malfunctioning client . 
  there is a certain point where it 's a better use of everyone 's time to tell them they 're being silly . 
  if your company is n't willing to do that , quit . 
  there are lots of programming jobs . 
   micro $ oft . 
  slashdot in 2005 called ... 
  social liberalism ! = socially liberal, 
  generally : public urination , cruelty to ~ ~ geese ~ ~ ** foxes ** , striking , arrogance , more striking , inefficient farming , ~ ~ anglophobe ~ ~ ** francophobe ** politicians , rude people , ruder gypsies , a capital city that should be called the city of daylight robbery , one final round of strikes , and rioting . 
   the electorate has rejected a move back to the old left wing ( ed milliband ), 
  oh come on . 
  what the fuck are you on about ? 
  for most students the nus is a discount card and several failed student fees protests . 
  the number of active members , your leftist boogiemen , is tiny . 
  because we do n't have infinite resources . 
  looks like my i7 920 will have to cling on for another year, 
  there 's a finite limit on both human and natural resources - no amount of efficiency will get you past that . 
  no , you can state that for certain . 
  there is not an infinite amount of accessible energy on the planet . 
  if there 's some way of increasing resources a million times or making us a million times more efficient then fine - you 've kicked the can down the road . 
  you 're still infinitely far from having an infinite growth potential, 
  do you know what the best ebay slot in replacement would be ? 
   uk ca n't kick the darkies out fast enough . 
  what a fucking ignorant thing to say . 
  i 'm sorry we 're not constantly chanting usa , usa , usa !, 
  it must be hard for you . 
  who has said either of these things ? 
  this story is specifically about the us and ireland . 
  is it a surprise people are talking about the us prison system ? 
  the fact is , on this issue - and what this link is about - is the fact that the us is an outlier here .
