  you can make claims about whatever perceived downside another county has but that 's not what we 're talking about . 
  i 'm certainly no fan of ukip , but that 's not what they want to do . 
  they want to leave the eu and and they 're happy to sir up anti-immigration feelings to do it . 
  at no point have they said they `` want to end immigration to the uk deport the immigrants that they currently have '' . 
  i suspect you just do n't know what your 're talking about . 
   and you toss fact around alot . 
  where are your facts from , exactly ? 
  what do you want ? 
  is it not clear and obvious the us is in a minority worldwide and an extreme minority amongst western democracies . 
  this is just nonsense . 
  every time there 's mention of something bad in the us there 's the same old circle jerk about how reddit is picking on the us . 
  this is what the story is about , this is why it was brought up in the comments . 
  to then come to comments and complain that the us is being unfairly mentioned , ** in a story about the us ** is childish . 
  you need to learn to separate criticism of your country from criticism of yourself . 
  no country is always in the right, 
  1952 really . 
   i bet ukip voters are foaming at the mouth . 
  is there ever a time they 're not ? 
  that sure showed me, 
  reality being this subredit ? 
   availability of powerful hardware that lasts, 
  i 'm still running a i7 920 - first available in 2008 . 
  it 's not great ( and should be replaced soon ) but it 's still fine for most every game . 
  has there ever been a time where hardware that old is still reasonable in a game released last week ? 
  good luck getting the tube running again with a bunch of temps, 
  when will white men get the break they deserve ? 
  yeah , the oil price certainly affects it . 
  oil 's obviously used to make loads of other stuff aswell, 
  the conservative party are now a threat to your livestock , the livestock of your family and the livestock of this country . 
   like the doctors strike against more hours and less pay , like the tube drivers want to protect their original contract , the cab drivers understandably want to protect their business . 
  they 're welcome to strike , but i do n't think they should be welcome to change the law to protect their outdated skill . 
  i do n't think there 's an equivalence here between cab drivers and doctors . 
  computers are going to replacing more and more jobs . 
  at some point we 're going to have to give up on the idea of people working for a living - there just wo n't be the work to do . 
  dock workers , cashiers , cab drivers are all on the way out . 
  i suspect we 'll see no real action until computerisation starts to hit middle class doctors and lawyers . 
  annoying if true - but you hear this kind of shit about the eu all the time . 
  bendy banana ? 
  gunpoint is super fun, 
  and then did nothing about it, 
  i trust would wont be heading to the hospital for any treatment next time you 're sick . 
  better to rid others of the burden , yeah ? 
   bit more of a political echo chamber, 
  amazing . 
  we 've just had an election . 
  the farage fans and eased up too . 
  give it 4 years and you 'll see more active ~ ~ participation ~ ~ internet arguing . 
  things that affect people ** good **, 
  things that affect you ** bad **, 
  just add the game as a ` non steam game ' in the library menu . 
  works fine, 
  yes , i was using fusion for the genesis that way . 
  set your emulator to use keyboard/mouse and then map the steam controller to use those keyboard buttons . 
  i hope it 's added to the bill separately, 
  are you streaming to the steam link ? 
  when i posted this i was streaming to a macbook but when i got the streamlink performance was much much better . 
  suspect the codec it streams in differs by client . 
  as soon as self driving cars become viable manual cars should be banned . 
  jeremy clarkson can fuck off and there 's nothing witty about dave 's banter . 
  pal is actually higher res , lower framerate . 
   anti-british politics, 
  oh come on . 
  did we import this horseshit from the us ? 
  i 'll just leave this here, 
  ah , that does look better . 
  would something like a 280x fit in a micro atx case ? 
  super , i 'll go with this then :,

  thank you . 
  swings both ways does n't it ? 
  just hang around here long enough and read comments that mention ` leftists ', 
  it really does sound like the web in 2001 . 
  i use this to switch between my usb headset and my amp : https://code.google.com/p/audioswitch/, 
  have a look at your driver settings and see if you can get the front socket headphone out to present as a different device to the port at the back ( if both use 3.5 mm ), 
  edit : this might help http://computerstepbystep.com/windows_audio_endpoint_builder_service.html, 
   clickbait , pandering to their reader demographic , etc. 
  yes , no other newspaper would do that ... 
  clinton is centre right and trump is bordering on fascist . 
  i do n't see how its even a choice . 
  there 's next to nothing left wing about clinton , at best she 's a neo-liberal . 
   hrc is still very far on the authoritarian side of the authoritarian-libertarian scale . 
  this is what i do n't get . 
  if you 're concerned about an authoritarian clinton why would you vote for a guy who wants to kill americans on american soil without due process and has proposed having a government database of muslims ? 
  that makes no sense . 
  happened to me too . 
  did a factory reset a week or so ago and it stopped . 
  nearly all comedy is biased to the left to be fair . 
  here 's and interesting article about that http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2013/04/where-are-all-right-wing-stand-ups, 
  do you have a list of columnists that called the election correctly ?
