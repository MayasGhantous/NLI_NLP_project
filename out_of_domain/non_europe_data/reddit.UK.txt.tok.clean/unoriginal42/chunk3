  eggs , beacon , beans , sausage all in half a french loaf . 
  the day the earth stood still . 
  woah . 
  last year i had that . 
  what fun . 
  woke up with the feeling that something had dried on my legs . 
  looked down , it was last nights absinthe - which i 'd thrown up all over my bed while i was supposedly sleeping . 
  would you like me to point it out to you ? 
  i 'd suggest dell . 
  they 've got somewhat of an iffy reputation but this is my second dell laptop and the quality has really stepped up . 
  just upgraded to the new i7 studio xps 16 '' and it 's build quality is amazing . 
  if you 're looking for something cheaper i 'd go for the vostro business line - since i upgraded i gave my vostro 1500 to my brother . 
  the thing is built like a ( ugly ) tank and has survived ( the specs , alas , have n't ) 2\u00a01/2 years of being thrown around at uni . 
  just thought i 'd mention - if you 're doing it the lazy way and using itunes on a laptop with a single audio out : use mediamonkey . 
  it 's got auto-fading that has some pretty good defaults - so while it wont sound great , it wo n't sound like itunes . 
  lmnop was a letter for the longest time . 
  it 's a great library management program . 
  it 's got a feature that analyses every song and shows you the duplicates . 
  the free version is . 
  i know it does flac , not sure about al. 
  something by the mountain goats . 
  most people hate it . 
  fuck those people . 
  on the right hand side , click on the ` files to edit ' node . 
  it 's the bottom option . 
  it 'll then ask you if you want to analyze them . 
  you do .

  no way to actually choose what music you want , but leave it on overnight and come back to a playlist of songs you might like . 
  oh and [ bee mp3 ] ( http://beemp3.com/ ) is great for getting that occasional song that pops into your head . 
  `` rec '' - spanish zombie film .

  i also love the art brut line : `` i wanted rock and roll , i got a science museum '', 
  the kinks . 
  late , i know . 
  an awlful lot of the mountain goats stuff is incredibly smart/romantic . 
  one song , not especially smart or romantic gets me every time . 
  downtown soul :, 
   there was a new song on the air . 
   i saw you coming across the square . 
   and a white bird broke the dark korean sky, 
   as the rest of my life went by, 
   i had your warm hand on my face . 
   i took your index finger in between my teeth ,, 
   and i held it gently in place . 
   it was resting lightly on my tongue in there . 
   i saw you shaking in the cold korean air . 
   [ and ] there but for the grace of the lord of song, 
   i would be this very second and i 'm coming right along . 
   you had your cardigan on . 
   i looked toward the sky and the white bird was gone . 
   i remember your eyelids . 
   i remember your body now . 
  it 's all about the cardigan . 
  have a ipod classic now , i hate it . 
  my 30gb zen vision : m was amazing , until i stepped through the screen when hungover . 
  `` blink 182 were the best band in the last 40 years '', 
  hello starling is also very good . 
  the wave pictures, 
  cats .

  would you be with someone who had a drink every day if you did n't drink ? 
  the forrest gump soundtrack is a fucking education .

  the first day in the year when it 's warm enough to go outside without a coat . 
  it 's the only time i 'm happy with england . 
  this : http://www.wefeelfine.org/, 
  got two pioneer 100w speakers and my trusty jvc amp , both older than i am , hooked up to my laptop . 
  old audio gear lasts for ever and is really , really , cheap - the whole lot cost me maybe # 70 and sounds so much better than the 2.1 logitech pc speaker crap pc world would have you buy .

  emailed my mp , still got no idea what he plans to do . 
   thank you for your e-mail . 
  i will certainly take all of the points you raise into consideration when voting on the individual clauses and amendments of the bill . 
  i will certainly want to hear what ministers have to say in response to the various points made in the campaign on this bill , and know that it is of importance to many people working in the digital economy here in brighton . 
   yours sincerely ,,
