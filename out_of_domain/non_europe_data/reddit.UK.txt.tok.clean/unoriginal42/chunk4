  in the 2nd year of my degree we had to write a web browser , from the ground up , in java . 
  it bends over backwards to fix broken html , but no css or javascript support makes it , predictably , useless . 
  it loaded reddit , [ kind of ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fdnh2.png ) . 
  down load the zip , unzip , double click the jar file . 
  if that does n't work :, 
   java - jar filename.jar, 
  edit : i make no promises that it 'll actually run, 
  msnbc [ just covered it . 
  `` i think i am going to vote lib dem in the election . '', 
  ... 54 translations later we get :, 
  `` i think the idea effectively . '', 
  i 've got the wrist communicator sound from power ranger for my texts . 
  if i 'm right in assuming reddit runs on some sort of nosql setup - cassandra , mongodb or some such then it 's probably to be expected . 
  because a nosql database is n't relational , it 's probably not a simple matter of performing a search for comments with your user id . 
  i 've got a feeling that reddit actually stores each submission as a ` document ' or whatever it 's called in their db of choice - then each comment on that submission in a object in that document . 
  so you end up with a collection of tree structures with the submission as the root and all comments and comments on comments being branches and leaf nodes . 
  doing things like that makes loading the frontpage , or the comments for a submission , really easy since that just falls out of the data structure . 
  finding all the comments for a particular user is harder since they have to effectively go through all the submissions . 
  i 'm sure there 's some cleaver map-reducing and caching going on . 
  big computer systems are all about trade offs . 
  also , i do n't know anything about reddit - so this post has all be conjecture , bullshit and hand-waving . 
  ** tldr ; ** nosql lets them makes the front page fast at the cost of user pages . 
  nosql is n't really a thing - it 's just the name for things that are not sql based . 
  mongo and couch db let you treat what would be rows in a relational database as objects ( ish ) - serialized in json or whatever format they feel like . 
  so you could have it so each document is a rich object with a tree like structure or as a simple key value store . 
  i 'm certainly no db admin , but i would think that doing a site like reddit relationally would be a right pain - lots and lots of joins . 
  i ca n't stand that attitude . 
  nosql is n't new and it is n't easy to get right . 
  for two long , relational has been the only way - as a group , we web developers have to realize that there is indeed more than one way to store user data and each way has it 's strong points and it 's weak points .

  i 'd like to second the vote for netbeans . 
  we use a mix of ubuntu and osx in the office - while i personally prefer windows for my non nerd activities you 'll find it much easier to get on in the ruby world with a nix . 
  edit : that 's not to say windows/ruby is a pain , it 's just a tad more hassle to install gems which require a c compiler ( although that 's getting better with the [ dev kit ] ( http://github.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller/wiki/development-kit ), 
  that 's what i tried a few weeks back . 
  i , for whatever reason , got really string cravings after i got home from work - i felt like i could n't relax without a smoke .

  13,000 last.fm plays too much . 
  i ca n't , therefore , let a chance go by to introduce someone to my [ mountain goat introductory mixtape ] ( http://14lines.com/mixtapes/sevenlittledolls/ ), 
  it would seem i 'm up to 16,000 . 
  my runner up is they might be giants with 6,055 then the silver jews with 4,292 . 
  sometimes i wonder if i have [ too much ] ( http://www.last.fm/user/unoriginal42 ) time on my hands . 
  [ here ] ( http://14lines.com/mixtapes/seven_little_dolls_playlist.htm ) is the playlist for this mix , with album/recording name . 
  that account is coming up to 5 years old - the they might be giants listening spree was a couple of years ago . 
  i do n't think they 're just quirky - but i do see why someone would think that .

  i used to dev on windows - netbeans was pretty nice .

  back at uni one of our projects was to build a browser in java . 
  you can take a peak at the source for the parser [ here ] ( http://code.google.com/p/browsermonkey/source/browse/trunk/%20browsermonkey/programming%20team/scratch/browsermonkey/src/browsermonkey/document/parser.java ) . 
  it 's not the best implementation , but we found it to be pretty solid . 
  it spends quite a lot of time trying to correct nesting errors and the like . 
  everything went better than expected .
