  do n't get me wrong , ubuntu and dell are great . 
  i dare say we 've got a few servers running just that combination . 
  for day to day usage , however - gnome is ugly , working sound is a gamble , battery usage depends on drivers which may or may not exist . 
  also , i 've owned a few dell laptops in the past and they 've been good for a while - but they do n't age well . 
  i 'd rather have a consumer os with unix than a unix os with gnome/kde/whatever . 
  one more , with blurry !, 
  this could be less readable , but i 'm not sure how . 
  your post is bad and you should feel bad . 
  where 's this assumption that wanting to get married is a sign of maturity coming from ? 
   so the immaturity is in being afraid to make it `` official , '' not realizing that it wo n't change a thing in his life . 
  i would say the immaturity here is on the part of the op . 
  if they 're happy and everything is otherwise great then indeed what is the point in getting married if , as you say , it does n't change a thing . 
  well , there 's not much else to notice . 
  brighton , obviously .

  it looked outdated from the very beginning . 
  i 'm fairly certain they mostly share the same tape . 
   web application firewalls, 
  i pay the equivalent 5 large domino 's pizzas a month and get schools , rubbish collection , social services , police , street lighting , trading standards , planning and the fire service . 
  sounds pretty good to me . 
  no , they 're partly funded by central government . 
  take a look , for example : http://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/downloads/bhcc/finance/budget_2012/budget_book_2012-13_v.4.pdf, 
  because then it 's no longer independent of viewing figures . 
  if the bbc started to make significant amounts from foreign subscriptions then it 'd have become a commercial network - and we know they tend to be shit . 
  i think the difference is : the commercial activities of the bbc are , at the moment , very much after the fact . 
  old episodes of top gear , dr.who and merchandise . 
  if there was the ability to subscribe to the bbc outside of the license fee then there would be increased pressure to americanize the bbc 's output and tailor the schedule accordingly . 
  that 's what i think the argument for keeping bbc worldwide at arms length is , anyway . 
  give the original blackberry storm a go . 
  so , 3 then ?

  if you do n't like the mountain goats , i 'm not sure i can really trust you . 
   what about insurance , healthcare and benefits for the workers , taxes , what about the changing economic factors affecting the business , and also you make it seem like the workers there are unable to ever get a better share which is totally false, 
  workers healthcare ( which is mandated i assume ? ), 
  and taxes to pay for things like roads and a water supply is socialism in action . 
  it 's weak and ineffectual but it 's a start . 
  dollar value is not value . 
  there are professions and practices which affect society in both a good and a bad ways . 
  we come together as a government to try and fix the ways in which market value does n't reflect our values . 
  you can earn a lot of money being a fraudsters and the market does not accurately reflect the value of that work - so we try to address it by making laws to increase the cost the business . 
  all value systems are entirely arbitrary . 
  we live in a word and a society where , quite rightly , we make moral judgments about situations . 
  the market does not and can not reflect those moral judgments so we need to step in . 
  i 'm a rails developer so i 'm perhaps biased . 
  if this really is ` the next facebook ' then build it in whatever is quickest - do n't worry about scaling or maintainability . 
  by the time you know if the idea 's gon na take off you should be in a position to hire some actual developers to build it right . 
  this article , or one very much like it , gets upvoted once a week . 
  it 's a good idea to know about the technology you 're using . 
  who knew ? 
  there 's a bunch of people here saying ` oh , it 's because british tv is better ' . 
  do n't be a muppet . 
  six feet under , the wire , breaking bad , mad men , house , dexter , the west wing . 
  american tv is clearly not bad . 
  here 's a [ mountain goat introductory mix ] ( http://14lines.com/mixtapes/sevenlittledolls/ ) i made , a long time ago . 
  must try harder . 
  in 2011 there were 551 homicides in the uk , and 16799 in the us during 2009 . 
  so yeah , you 're full of shit . 
  there 's 60 million people in the uk , and about 300 million in the us - that does n't account for the massive difference . 
  homicide is a better measure when comparing internationally because, 
  1 ) death is a bad outcome of crime, 
  2 ) violent crime is counted differently depending on the country - to quote wikipedia :, 
   the reported us violent crime rate includes only aggravated assault , whereas the canadian violent crime rate includes all categories of assault , including the much-more-numerous assault level 1 ( i.e. , assault not using a weapon and not resulting in serious bodily harm ) . 
  [ 32 ] [ 33 ] a government study concluded that direct comparison of the 2 countries ' violent crime totals or rates was `` inappropriate '' . 
  you 're wrong . 
  have a look at the guardian source, 
   551 homicides ( includes murder , manslaughter and infanticide ) were ** reported ** in 2011/12 , a considerable drop on the previous year 's total of 638 . 
  homicides are now down to around half of the figure for 2001/2 . 
  also , my source was a guardian article while your source was a blog called ` extrano 's alley , a gun blog ' which provides no sources . 
  i mean , yeah - i trust a newspaper with 12 million readers a month over some gun nuts ' blog . 
  so , you pull some numbers out of the air and use them to make a unsubstantiated claim without sources . 
  once confronted with numbers that disagree with you you attack the validity of those numbers . 
  you then claim that a reputable , widely read newspaper staffed by actual journalists is a less reliable source of facts about our world than a blog written by a ` long time gun crank and pro-gun advocate ' who goes by the name of ` stranger ' . 
   gun control has amazing success in britain all right , that 's why their violent crime rates are higher than ours , and often far more violent due to higher rates of stabbings and beatings . 
  people are more likely to use a bat or knife than a gun , when it 's the option . 
  there 's your claim and there is n't your source . 
  violent crime is n't comparable . 
  and fair enough , i 'm willing to believe that the homicide rate is n't much better for comparisons sake . 
  at best , then , your original claim is unprovable . 
  if you 're going into this trying to find an optimal solution you 're gon na have a bad time . 
  you 're likely to get a optimal-ish solution - that is to say you 'll find yourself on a local peak . 
  you 'll never really have a ` generate random solution ' method in use , apart from seeding the first generation . 
  each generation after the first will be made up of some combinations of the fittest of the last generation and a bit of mutation . 
  if the process of checking the viability of a solution has the same cost , or is basically the same as , the fitness function then you may as well just let it run - since non valid solutions will have a low fitness anyway and not be picked for the next generation . 
  there 's no need to have the same length for each member of the population , but you absolutely need to know what it means to breed two members - and if that 's something you ca n't reasonably encode then it 's game over .
