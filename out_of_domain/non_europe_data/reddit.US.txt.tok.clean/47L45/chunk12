  i hear the part that 's similar but it 's not it . 
  dude , all of your shit is amazing . 
  just liked your soundcloud . 
  adding all your shit to a playlist . 
  god damn . 
  to all those wondering about columbia ,, 
  it no longer exists . 
  it * used * to exist . 
  it * did * exist . 
  [ my own theory . 
  please critique it/find flaws ], 
  the tears opened during the whole game we 're opened to colombia , yes , but at a time in the universe when it * did * exist . 
  tears open to any universe at any time . 
  the tears we were experienced were opened to a universe when the comstock paradox * used * to exist . 
  elizabeth herself says that the comstock she killed in the first bas was the last one , `` the one that got away . '', 
  with all the comstocks dead , the paradox does n't exist * anymore * , which means colombia is no more . 
  elizabeth and the lutece twins are still able to exist outside of this since they are not ( now ) bound to a certain universe . 
  rosalind also states in bas 2 that they 're immortal and her brother was having thoughts about fixing himself to become part of his own timeline , to help support that they are n't tied to a single universe while they 're in their `` immortal form . '', 
  for reference , i 've modified [ this original timeline ] ( http://i.imgur.com/zgniew0.png ) made when infinite was first completed to look like [ this one , the modified one . 
  i hope this helps any confusion . 
  help me pick some flaws out of this if you can . 
  i 'm just as curious as you guys . 
  every universe was erased , but not * entirely * . 
  colombia no longer exists from a * given point in time * . 
  i made [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ynbqwzl.png ) to try and clear things up . 
  typo in the title god dammit . 
  my take as to * how * ... 
  im not reading this, 
  i think / u/oppositeimage is stating that op has $ 1,519 dollars on his person ( in-game ) . 
  that 's a lot of on-hand money . 
  he 's saying he uses it at the club . 
  so when did january and february come into play ? 
  this is chill as fuck, 
  this is chill as fuck . 
  love it . 
  can you send me a link of where to purchase it ? 
  thanks !, 
  do n't do infinite first , please . 
  do b1 , then infinite if you want to skip . 
  something to zone out to . 
  i thought this was supposed to happen tomorrow ? 
  what would you call this kind of music ? 
  i have navi-x installed . 
  that 's fine . 
  it 's the settings.dat file that i need and it 's only created when you run navi-x for the first time , which i ca n't do . 
  duuuude !, 
  keep the beard !, 
  you look cool as fuck .

  the best place to find what you 're looking for is most likely going to be found [ here , the rapture storyline , ] ( http://bioshock.wikia.com/wiki/rapture_storyline ) or in this [ colombia storyline . 
  ] ( http://bioshock.wikia.com/wiki/columbia_storyline ), 
  if you 're looking for connections between the two like you asked or just have any questions at all , i 'd be more than willing to answer any/all of them . 
  just made me spit my cereal out . 
  that made my night . 
  why was n't rivington selected ? 
  i watch a fair amount of games but i really do n't know the whole story and popularity of each caster . 
  i always knew phreak was liked but why not rivengton ? 
  why would n't he be picked ? 
  damn . 
  he 's my favorite caster . 
  thanks for the info . 
  i always thought he was the best ... 
  fuck , this is tight, 
  you look fucking cool as fuck to chill with . 
  oi m8 , ye head lok like a ball, 
  with gray in your facial hair , upper 30 's . 
  without the gray , low 30 's . 
  without it , mid/upper 20 's . 
  not bad looking at all . 
  i love your jawline !, 
  i personally think your hair back looks pretty . 
  just me tho . 
  yeah , pretty good idea actually . 
  yes , i feel the exact way and here 's how i solved it . 
  after you get done doing all the shit on taris , start turning dark . 
  on taris , it seemed to me that all options were weighed against my morals . 
  if you wanted to be dark , you had to kill that old man , threaten the medic , kill those innocent people in the underworld of taris , etc. 
  after i left taris and got to dantooine ( forgot how to spell it ) , i started doing all the bad shit at the academy . 
  slowly .
