  i was never a dick to my crew mates and never got ls for choosing so . 
  i always killed random people cause i did n't like their attitude because unfortunately , [ i am the high king of the sith . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/skyrim/comments/1nfq8p/unfortunately_i_am_the_high_king_of_skyrim/ ) i just beat the game for the first time in my life half an hour ago and wondered if reddit had a sub for it . 
  stupid question , hahaha . 
  anyways , just wait till after taris to be dark . 
  i can say with all of my random-person-on-the-internet honesty that i never take the dark path in games but i really wanted to mix it up on a game i have n't played since i was in 5th grade . 
  lol, 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcfasdwcwsm video for reference, 
  did anyone else 's game crash right before they went to get their first pokemon ? 
  after sitting angrily for 10 minutes , i went back to the game to see if it happened again . 
  it did n't . 
  i just beat the first gym leader . 
  i think i 'm okay now . 
  the hell is going on in this thread, 
  how did you level your seadra ? 
  was it a level or do you need a dragon scale ? 
  not sure how many care , but this is a much better video of the first announcer . 
  it 's from the perspective of the team that ran it back , auburn . 
  a true poet . 
  enjoy the gold . 
  made me tear up . 
  ohshit , is it ? 
  `` gas the kikes '' had me laughing pretty hard, 
  is ... is that an emoji ? 
  wtf, 
  not sure if this thread is still alive , and do n't take what i 'm about to say as definitive , bur i 've been following tyler the creator on instagram for over a year now and when he put put up his first pictures on his first account ( he got locked out of it ) , he would put pictures like this up in a similar fashion . 
  i assumed he started it . 
  idk if the meanings behind doing it are all the same as it seems to mean different things to different people , but as for the the origin , i ** think ** tyler started it . 
  i hate to be a critic for sucha good work of art but that 's not how their wings look :(, 
  sweet . 
  is it a mini-story add-on where the main point is to hunt or kill a big monster ? 
  i have done zero research on them . 
  thanks !, 
  definitely gon na look into buying them then . 
  game of thrones, 
  is ... is that in emoji ? 
  wtf, 
  you should move them around . 
  what the hell happened ? 
  captain satan *, 
  came here to say this . 
  fuck that . 
  i did n't say it was broken , and it 's not just me . 
  a user in the thread with a ** gtx titan ** was having fps drops down under 10fps . 
  i have n't seen a fix yet and for me , these stutters are beyond irritating . 
  that did n't help . 
  hahahhaha i got a good laugh outta this . 
  ahh , no problem . 
  its mine and it has my name in it :|, 
  i saw an orange envelope next to my name and was like , * `` an answer ! '' * . 
  disappointment . 
  :( hahahaha, 
  do n't downvote this guy . 
  just asked a question . 
  man , you need to read the article . 
  go to a pawn shop . 
  when you get there , go to the shop and at the top , you should be able to sell items you 've found via car glove boxes and stuff . 
  what is this song called ?!, 
  found it thanks to shazam . 
  i want gold too, 
  swag, 
  man , i do n't know details . 
  i 'm just hyped about the movie and trying to give people a heads up . 
  i * think * that they 're reposting a comment from the / r/til thread . 
  i 'm guessing some euphoric / r/circlejerk user thinks that just because of the way op ended the til , that it 's related to / r/circlejerk , not true , and must be taken down or some shit . 
  they 're mocking that comment . 
  i have n't seen it , but i 'm guessing . 
  awww i liked them ... 
  [ show spoiler question ] ( #s `` my friend told me about this and how oberyn used poison . 
  it did n't show he used poison in the shower as far as i could tell . 
  did they show it on the show ? '' ), 
  thanks !, 
  what the fuck that gives me tingles down my neck . 
  can you explain how to find it ? 
  i ca n't find this `` data_win64 '' file :(, 
  hey guys , so i 've had this in my phone for months now and it 's the most played song in my music app . 
  i love it . 
  it 's my favorite song of all time since the lyrics really get to me . 
  i apologize for the genre tag , i 'm not really big into many genre 's and i honestly do n't know what to classify this as . 
  i really love it and just wanted to share it . 
  fuck i already bought it on steam, 
  this is kickass !, 
  took me 30 seconds to read the word `` online '' . 
  jesus , why the fuck is the n upside down ? 
  you made me spit out my late night cereal asshole . 
  i have n't laughed at `` rustled my jimmies '' so hard before . 
  enjoy the gold . 
  looks like a painting . 
  damn son , that 's awesome . 
  i planned on watching it next week . 
  did you just spoil it ? 
  please get back to us when you finished the second one !, 
  this is all i ever look forward to when it 's patch notes day . 
  really good but anatomically , those spikes would be detrimental to movement . 
  most of his weight is in the front which means he 's going to be putting his weight + more when he 's running . 
  as a spike , it will easily slide right into the ground and be very easy to trip over and/or slow down . 
  but that is n't real life , that 's some kickass artwork and a badass motherfucker . 
  steam or non steam ? 
  the lutece 's . 
  top kek .
