  so is there a way to restore my hard drive to factory condition ? 
  title says it all . 
  i 've never felt more stress watching a sport game in so long . 
  from the beginning please . 
  examples for first part, 
  [ oceanisize - music for a nurse ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3-5916esi4 ), 
  [ clint mansell - requiem for a dream ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsgmedirwjc ), 
  [ edvard grieg - hall of the mountain king ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqxsya6s90y ), 
  [ woodkid - iron ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vskb0kdacjs ), 
  examples for second part, 
  [ gary jules - mad world ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hw93cv6m-ju ), 
  [ death note - solitude ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oap0w0-amdu ), 
  [ bon iver - flume ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luqrlstucn0 ), 
  thanks !, 
  sick and tired of people saying its not but i 'm not very argumentative . 
  can you guys help me out ? 
  the title says it all . 
  i know its new . 
  i 'm positive it is . 
  at least fairly new . 
  i think the guy may be black . 
  not entirely sure . 
  but yeah , its a pretty steady song , not too fast but a little faster than a 4/4 tempo , i 'd say . 
  please and thank you !, 
  to all those wondering about columbia ,, 
  it * no longer * exists . 
  it * used * to exist . 
  it * did * exist . 
  [ my own theory . 
  please critique it/find flaws ], 
  the tears opened during the whole game we 're opened to colombia , yes , but at a time in the universe when it * did * exist . 
  tears open to any universe at any time . 
  the tears we experienced were opened to a universe when the comstock paradox * used to exist * . 
  elizabeth herself says that the comstock she killed in the first bas was the last one , `` the one that got away . '', 
  with all the comstocks dead , the paradox does n't exist * anymore * , which means colombia is no more . 
  elizabeth and the lutece twins are still able to exist outside of this since they are not ( now ) bound to a certain universe . 
  for reference , i 've modified [ this original timeline ] ( http://i.imgur.com/zgniew0.png ) made when infinite was first completed to look like [ this one , the modified one ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ynbqwzl.png ), 
  i hope this helps any confusion . 
  help me pick some flaws out of this if you can . 
  i 'm just as curious as you guys . 
  so i recently downloaded xmbc and downloaded navi-x . 
  unfortunately , i 'm having the hang up problem when i try to open it for the first times in the addon section . 
  since i ca n't technically load/open it , it does n't create a settings.dat file . 
  that file is what i need . 
  i tried following this video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjzobxin324 and at 2:19 when he clicks done after typing in `` whufclee '' , instead of just continuing like he does , i 'm greeted with a message saying there is no connection to the link i just provided . 
  i checked my spelling more than 5 times . 
  all i need is that settings.dat file . 
  do any of you know how to fix it or where i can find the settings.dat file ? 
  thank you .

  none of my friends play this game and it 's kinda not as fun to me when there 's no one to talk to in a chaotic battlefield . 
  should i join or a clan or something ? 
  do people talk a lot with you guys ? 
  recently , i 've been lucid dreaming very frequently and every time i 'm in the middle of it , i blink ( literally ) and when i open my eyes from the blink , i 'm looking at my room fully awake . 
  do you have tricks to stay dreaming or is it random ? 
  like the valentine day massacre and the son of crawmerax , etc. 
  gtx 670 with an i7 , 8gb of ram . 
  ca n't do it . 
  it was good on high . 
  every 4 seconds . 
  alright , well ... let 's go to medium settings . 
  every 4 seconds . 
  well , what the fuck . 
  i guess i can play it on low , it 's all about the gameplay anyways . 
  every 4 seconds . 
  i ca n't take it . 
  i 'm off to play other games until this is fixed . 
  voice chat . 
  some guy was talking to me and i tried pressing every button to do keyboard chat but there was none . 
  this guy kept talking and i wanted to talk back . 
  are there options or something ? 
  edit : pc , and i was in free roam . 
  i 'm running my main , a siren lvl 72 op1 , and it 's very difficult with the bee . 
  it 's easy to kill enemies , but it 's very difficult to stay alive . 
  i always see people with these crazy ass guns that kill people pretty quickly no matter what they have and i think that kind of ruins the fun . 
  i have great guns but i 'm put down too quickly in most cases . 
  should i get rid of the bee for a heftier shield ? 
  it 's a level 67 bee . 
  edit : netflix description - a japanese death cult is ordered to aid in the spiritual destruction of china . 
  their method : abduct their enemies ' children and train them as killers . 
  so i 've been waiting for ups to drop off an air soft gun i ordered and hopped on netflix to pass the time . 
  i wanted something totally random and rarely use netflix . 
  little did i know there was a foreign film section and the thumbnail of two buff japanese dudes looking to kick some ass caught my attention .
