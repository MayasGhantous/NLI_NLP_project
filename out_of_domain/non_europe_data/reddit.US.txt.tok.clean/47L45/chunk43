  level 149 and using a profaned great sword btw . 
  i have n't encountered anyone who 's used estus flasks until this afternoon . 
  two different people . 
  i know there 's no set rules for this but i thought that anything went except estus flasks . 
  i do n't give a shit if you heal yourself with miracles , that 's my fault for not punishing you but estus flasks are a different story . 
  this is n't invading , this is just 1 on 1 combat where * some * ounce of courtesy is , atleast i thought , used . 
  i killed the first one but the second guy beat me because i ran out of flasks from healing after previous fights and did n't bother to fill them back up . 
  not that it matters , not like you lose anything , i do n't even use my embers . 
  just heated rn , sorry, 
  i bought an a/c unit for my room but it says to not use a surge protector or extension cable . 
  it really wants me to use an outlet but the outlet for my room is not by my window . 
  i do n't know what else i could do besides use a really long surge protector that i have . 
  any advice or help ? 
  i 'm using a general electric ael06lv . 
  i want to make spinning text , but when i click the corner in pan/crop to rotate it , the text rotates around the center of the video and not around its own center . 
  i ca n't find a single video or forum to my problem . 
  i 've found videos of people rotating just like me in pan/crop but there 's works how i want it , mine is still not how i want it but i do n't know what setting to change . 
  also , track motion is giving me the same problem . 
  [ removed ], 
  i use them to pump out seweage , that 's why they are n't connected but uhm ... they just stopped working . 
  not sure why . 
  also , sorry for the dual monitor image . 
  i really do n't have a single clue about what 's going on . 
  ctrl-f ` ing the page and searching for summary , tldr , tl ; dr , and eli5 do n't bring anything up . 
  after some digging , it looks like taylor swift was mentioned in a lyric by kanye but ... she was in on it ? 
  she 's upset by it but she let him say it ? 
  i 'm poland . 
  every time i fight that 18.9 k army , i am usually down 1-3k soldiers . 
  whatever , no biggie . 
  but when the battle comes , it 's always on krakow ( i 'd rather defend obvi ) . 
  they *** always *** have a -1 for crossing a river and a -1 for something else ( ca n't remember . ), 
  i 've reloaded this save so many times ( new to the game ) and each time is the same . 
  i could roll a 7 with a 2 in shock or something like that , and they could roll a fucking 4 and still ruin my fucking day . 
  i 'll drop by 400-700 and they 'll drop by the 200 's . 
  is army size the reason i 'm losing ? 
  even with a combined force , we are *** still *** losing this fucking fight . 
  why is the austrian army so strong ??? 
  2nd edit : thanks for the help guys , it was deffff the military score . 
  still pretty behind . 
  fun game though . 
  unless maybe a 5 or 6 man group . 
  none of my friends , and i assume most people , do n't use group voice chat when partied up . 
  i assume most people use discord , skype , vent , or some other 3rd party voice chat system . 
  until competitive came out , we had no use of the in-game voice chat at all . 
  now it 's * extremely * helpful for obvious reasons . 
  unfortunately when you 're in a group and you get in a game , default setting is group chat . 
  that 's a terrible idea for competitive . 
  whatever , i 'll change it , all is good . 
  nahhhhhh , the setting does n't save which has led myself and friends to be yelling in confusion at teammates only to realize it 's just us that can hear each other . 
  sure , we 'll get use to changing it every game but ... could the setting just be saved ? 
  maybe add a default voice chat option ? 
  forgive me if there already is one but i could n't find it in the obvious places . 
  lost the first one and won the second one thanks to voice chat . 
  if there was n't voice chat , my team in the second game would have lost . 
  i. . . idk , it 's just stupid . 
  i thought mei and junkrat were the bane of my existence . 
  i thought the sniper bullet hitboxes were more than ridiculous . 
  but no . 
  defense on sudden death is the most bullshit thing i 've ever experienced in any ranked online video game . 
  you have less of a chance of winning . 
  sure the argument is `` it 's doable . '', 
  i agree . 
  i 've done it before with a good team . 
  but you do n't always have a good team . 
  the defenders are * supposed * to have a disadvantage . 
  they have to cross half the fucking planet just to get to the first point . 
  but that 's fair because the attackers then have a further walk the more they push the payload . 
  * except the game fucking ends when you lose the first point . 
  the defensive team has the odds stacked against them at the beginning . 
  the game should not end at the beginning . 
  fuck however long it takes to hold them off . 
  if we can stop them from winning the game as defense by holding them between the first and second or even third checkpoint , then we deserve the win . 
  ** tl ; dr attackers should not win the match in sudden death by simply getting the first point . 
  most of the time , it 's easy . 
  wait , it may be higher . 
  i 'm playing as poland . 
  did n't find any threads through the search function and was really curious . 
  i keep having withdrawals ( haha ) by watching trailers and thinking back to when wod launched . 
  played for two months before i stopped playing . 
  besides raid content , anything major new ? 
  so i 've been through two updates . 
  both times , both * god damn times * , all of my settings are wiped . 
  all my tags given to other users , my subreddit filters , my default settings , and even my subreddit shortcuts . 
  would like to stop getting updates , is there a setting for that ? 
  i have a 52 % winrate , started this season 54 , got to 57 , am now 48 . 
  [ removed ], 
  i asked this to tipofmytongue a whiilleeee ago and no responses were it . 
  i 'm hoping you guys can help me out as i remember it faintly . 
  i woke up when in the night when was around 11 ( ? ), 
  which was 2006 . 
  fell asleep to adult swim and woke up to this preview . 
  it starts out with a boy who 's in highschool/college and starts seeing men in black suits watching him from various places . 
  he see 's two if them outside of his school and he books it . 
  soon it seems that the population of the town/city dwindles and the next thing i remember is an apocalyptic matrix-type scene where humans are being slaughtered/hunted/and bred by robots . 
  the scene was tinted red or green , i think , and it was really , really gory . 
  i think in the end it was the dudes imagination but i just ca n't remember . 
  was hoping i could get some help from you guys . 
  also , this was n't a show as far as i remember . 
  i woke up , watched what was on and it started . 
  it was over quickly which made me think it was a preview but i 'm not positive .
