  like the title says , i 'm on my first game and i 'm playing as poland . 
  i 've conquered a huge amount of area but i can no longer make states as i 've hit the max number . 
  i do n't really wan na keep playing if that 's all i can conquer but i assumed that you 'd have to have client states to keep going ? 
  if that 's the case , any tips/strats with client states ? 
  is reading the wiki enough ? 
  need help finding a meme . 
  it 's just a stupid fucking stick figure dude looking at a computer or off into nothing with his mouth just * slightly * open . 
  i ca n't think of the name of it but i thought about it like 10 minutes ago and just started dying laughing thinking about this guy . 
  i 've googled :, 
  meme face with mouth slightly open, 
  meme face satisfied, 
  autistic satisfied meme face, 
  satisfied meme face with mouth slightly open, 
  rage face mouth open satisfied, 
  stick figure satisfied with mouth slightly open, 
  i ca n't find it . 
  i need it so i can draw it on the white board on my house . 
  i 've looked all through the / top of this subreddit but ca n't find it . 
  google did n't help either . 
  the comic is set during varricks wedding . 
  korra and asami are trying to have a good moment together like they did in the episode but tenzin is kind of ruining the moment . 
  varrick thinks of a plan to get tenzin away from the two and that 's when , in the episode , tenzin runs looking for varrik because he hears varrick is about to do something crazy with one of the hummingbird suits . 
  any help at all would be really appreciated !, 
  it was my favorite comic i 've seen of the show and i ca n't find it : /, 
  about to get off work and listening to music right now , specifically nujabes . 
  his music always makes me think of old memories with friends and how much i miss what used to be . 
  any of you been on a thinking binge ? 
  this is one song by his that 's been remixed that i love to put on repeat . 
  i 'm specifically talking about the `` ordeal '' he had to go through when at the blackfriars station to get the key for the angel islington . 
  i truly do n't understand the ending to his ordeal but thought i had a good idea of it up until the * very * end . 
  my theory :, 
  the three of them ( hunter , door , richard ) each had to go through a trial to get the key . 
  hunter , being a fighter , proved herself in battle . 
  door , being quick-witted and smart , solved the riddle given to her . 
  but richard ? 
  richard 's trial was his sanity . 
  he lived a boring life , no real purpose . 
  he had no purpose until he was put into london below . 
  up until this point , he still , *** still *** , does n't believe some of the shit he 's seeing . 
  all he wants to do is leave and go back to his world . 
  what 's he to go back to ? 
  his boring life ? 
  while in the station , he 's constantly told that he 's talking to himself and that he 's been imagining the whole thing . 
  * that 's what he 's been saying to himself the whole time * . 
  his conscious is telling him to give up . 
  there 's nothing to go back to and he does n't belong in london below . 
  signs across the tracks start telling him to kill himself and he suddenly has the opportunity to do it but does n't . 
  he let 's the train pass and see 's the bodies of those who have died in the trial of the ordeal littering the inside of the train . 
  he slowly starts to wonder who he even is anymore . 
  here 's where i 'm confused . 
  why does he get on the train ? 
  what exactly does the train symbolize ? 
  getting on the train let him leave the ordeal but ... 
  i 'm just not understanding the metaphor/meaning . 
  after he awakes he says to himself , `` by my crooked teeth , who am i ? '', 
  i just do n't understand what it meant for him to get on . 
  any help would be appreciated . 
  not sure if my analysis of that part of the book is wrong either , that 's just my interpretation . 
  10/10 book so far , loving it . 
  [ removed ], 
  i 'm able to see it and use it in all my other clips but the clip i 'm using has a velocity set to 0 % and that 's the one that 's not working . 
  my goal is to freeze frame and zoom in . 
  is there an easier way to do that than set the speed to 0 % ?
