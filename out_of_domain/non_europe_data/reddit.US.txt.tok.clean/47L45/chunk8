  as informative , appreciative , and kickass as your comment is , i do n't think a 5 year old could understand that ... 
  i 've heard this anime was pretty good , but i refuse to watch any more after cowboy bebop . 
  is it really that fucking good ? 
  same . 
  i 'm glad joel took ellie away , but i wish the ending was n't so `` realistic . '', 
  i did n't like the lying or the coldness . 
  i know it may sound fucking stupid , but i was wanting a good father-daughter moment . 
  but hey , what happened is what really would have happened so regardless , i fucking loved it . 
  yeah man , listen . 
  honestly , listen . 
  exactly what apeman92 said . 
  do n't . 
  i 've had 5 games impact my life . 
  i 'm turning 19 in october , to give you a reference . 
  my dad said he 'd let me get a tattoo when i turn 16 . 
  i 'm almost 19 , and i have n't gotten any yet . 
  i have a list of what i want , but i want to know if they 'll still mean something to me in the years to come . 
  well anyway , on that list , i * wanted * a tribute to halo and gears of war . 
  i 've played each game since their making . 
  gears when i was young , halo when i was even younger , obviously . 
  both games had such profound impacts on my life . 
  all the stories , all the feelings , all the thoughts , all the changes in my own morals and ethics ; so much change . 
  i write this to you now saying that i no longer want them as tattoos . 
  do n't get me wrong , each game has made me cry once and tear up at other times , but man , even months later , i was still in the moment . 
  the only games i would currently like a tattoo of are bioshock and wow . 
  both games have impacted me like no other . 
  i 'm still waiting on both though . 
  i want to know if i 'm still in the moment . 
  please , if you get anything out of this , ** pleaseeeee ** just wait . 
  you 're in the moment . 
  i 'm not saying do n't get one , because it would be ** totally bad ass ** , i 'm just saying to wait . 
  give it some time . 
  i do n't want you regretting it , internet stranger . 
  man , same thoughts . 
  i was waiting for my fucking heart to melt at the end . 
  unfortunately disappointed . 
  i do n't know what i 'm looking at . 
  i 'm starting my freshman year in august and i 've selected that degree . 
  can you give me a `` general knowledge '' about your math classes , what you do in your major-oriented classes , and what you plan to do with the degree ? 
  man , i was seconds , seconds away from giving you gold . 
  after the edit , you over did it . 
  : / i 'd give you gold , but [ this ] ( http://imgur.com/0hsytas ) is what deserves gold . 
  sorry dude . 
  edit : i laughed my fucking ass off . 
  you really deserved it ... 
  i 'll definitely give that a look .

  thanks . 
  i was n't sure if that weekly was worth it . 
  i 'll start on it right now . 
  thanks !, 
  a lot of that helped extremely .

  thanks for the links !, 
  i never really thought about gems that much . 
  i 'll head straight to the ah .

  its been dead for like , 2 months . 
  i dont have a question but just want to say how much of a badass you are . 
  i bought a darkhorse frisbee about 2 weeks ago and i just love it . 
  my friends and i pretty much use your name like an adjective , hahhaha . 
  keep being a badass forever man , haha . 
  damn . 
  this is fucking tear jerking . 
  man , i do n't feel * right * anymore on this sub since i 'm 18 . 
  i saw the picture and told myself i would be disappointed if i did n't see something like your comment in the comments . 
  i would also like to be on the tinfoil-finding crusade . 
  found it . 
  see the `` alcan '' on the right ? 
  it 's in a blue box . 
  that 's actrually tinfoil . 
  it goes from 50 to 100 . 
  this is kickass . 
  i have n't laughed so hard at something over the internet in weeks . 
  please , please is there any more of these ? 
  i noticed , hahahah . 
  what the fuck is on her head ? 
  i too like bonfire by childish gambino . 
  dude , i do n't know who you are but i ca n't thank you enough for sharing this song . 
  i 've had this song on repeat since you 've posted it and i even downloaded it on my phone . 
  i can not thank you enough . 
  wait , there actually is a spoiler ? 
  am i missing something ? 
  can i buy this ? 
  i do n't see a link to buy it . 
  unless it 's just a sole poster ... : /, 
  you 're lying , that 's high hrrothgar . 
  man , i remember reading that before i even registered an account . 
  i ca n't believe it made it this far . 
  if this gets really big , i 'm gon na feel like such a fucking hipster douchebag when i tell people i 've known about rome sweet rome before it got huge . 
  thanks for making such a kickass story .
