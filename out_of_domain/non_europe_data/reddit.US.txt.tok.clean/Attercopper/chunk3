  i 'm already struggling with my life , i do n't know how to deal with this , fucking hell , fuck fuck fuck . 
  thank you . 
  hugs are the best . 
  that seems to be the best/only course of action , so i 'll do that . 
  for me it 's $ 100 for an er visit , about $ 250 - $ 500 for a hospital admission , and then i pay 20 % coinsurance for every service rendered , out of pocket max being $ 6600 . 
  each night at the hospital , a bed is like $ 200 - $ 300 . 
  i ca n't afford that , especially for 10 days . 
  the neurologist appointment i made is n't going to be cheap either but i think it will be cheaper . 
  i think i will see if someone at the university can help me . 
  thank you for your kind thoughts . 
  perfect for / r/shoulders !, 
  flow , flower , and journey . 
  nonviolent , fun , beautiful . 
  / u/trollabot attercopper, 
  your financial aid . 
  it 's gone . 
  i 'm so sorry for your loss . 
  nevermo here . 
  do mormons believe the book of mormon is `` more correct '' ( whatever that means ) than the bible ? 
  san fernando , pacoima , panorama city, 
  i used to take seriously the idea that women are people , but then anita sarkeesian started criticizing video games , so now i 'm for forced births and sexual harassment . 
  equality !, 
  ( / s obviously ), 
  i went to legislative branch today . 
  i did a politics . 
  `` feminist hero '' ? 
  i think you made a typo , you obviously meant to write [ `` reactionary tool of the patriarchy '' ] ( http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/camille-paglia-takes-taylor-swift-845827 ) :, 
   women need to study the immensely productive dynamic of male bonding in history . 
  with their results-oriented teamwork , men largely have escaped the sexual jealousy , emotionalism and spiteful turf wars that sometimes dog women . 
  also see the awful straw feminist position she states in your own title . 
  i do n't , i always make sure to think of england, 
  you 're not trans . 
  methane , perhaps ? 
  what ? 
  [ in the 1990 census , german ancestry was # 1 by a large margin ... ] ( http://www.census.gov/prod/cen1990/cqc/cqc14.pdf ), 
  hmm , that 's * single * ancestry though . 
  the numbers make more sense if you look at [ the totals from everyone who reported an ancestry ] ( http://www.census.gov/population/censusdata/pc80-s1-10/tab02.pdf ) . 
  my uneducated guess is that americans with english ancestry tend to be wealthier and more concentrated in the northeast and utah . 
  and 47.5 % of people reporting english ancestry give that as their sole ancestry versus only 36.5 % for those with german ancestry , seems they 've been spreading their blood and seed around , as is their habit, 
   single ancestry means 100 % genetic integrity , whereas multiple ancestries can mean any value less than that, 
  stop that , * we 're * supposed to be the nutters about ancestry !, 
  i think the dodgers might be a tad more popular ... 
  like with all ideologies , you have your followers of the one true faith , your heretics , and your heathens . 
  if you 're not with us , you 're against us , if you 're not as revolutionary as us , you 're a poisonous reformist tool of the bourgeoisie seeking to subvert true class consciousness , etc. 
  it 's a tale as old as time, 
  you go girl . 
  you are an unstoppable whirlwind with a heart of rainbows and a soul of unquenchable fire and metaphors that actually make sense . 
  you can do this !, 
  it 's called whiskey . 
  you can be a registered independent in california , you just choose `` no party preference '' . 
  that 's what independent means , someone who chooses not to affiliate with a political party . 
  iirc the bubble for the aip used to just state `` american independent '' while `` decline to state '' was another option in the same group . 
  the registration process was changed so that `` no party preference '' is under one heading all by itself , while parties are listed under another heading . 
  ucsb 's softball team is hosting long beach state on the 24th @ 1pm . 
  thank you sweden i love you viva la tre kroner, 
   `` what the fuck ?! '', 
  `` why are you throwing shit at us ?! '', 
  are they like , intellectually challenged or something ? 
  or have they just never been called out on their shit their * entire lives * ? 
  rule of cool !, 
  10/10 would totally listen to the cure with you for hours on end, 
  you first , gender !, 
  quit reifying trannies !, 
  i met my current boyfriend at a friend 's birthday party at a bar . 
  i started talking to him and when i found out he liked dancing i made sure that we did . 
  we went to get some food together , talked some more , and as we were leaving to go our separate ways i let him know i was trans . 
  he digested it for a minute then told me he hoped he could see me again , and so i did !, 
  i 've found that being sociable and meeting new people through your current friends works well . 
  you are the cutest thing ever . 
  you go girl !, 
  maybe try meeting other people at the shelter ? 
  when i first started hrt i was super sensitive about being validated and seen like any other girl . 
  i imagine the trans girl in the story just went through the difficult process of accepting who she is and coming out to others and is now taking the tremendously anxiety inducing steps of being herself to the world . 
  so i can see why she was upset . 
  but she was absolutely wrong to lash out at you and put you down like that . 
  anyone , anywhere has the right to say no during sex to anything . 
  i do n't think you did anything wrong at all , and they should have respected your right to say no * especially * since you told them in advance !, 
  maybe after time has passed and she 's more comfortable in her own skin she 'll realize that the emotions she was feeling were triggered by her own insecurity and were not the result of any harm by you . 
  i was never in the situation she was in , but i did get inappropriately upset at times because i was paranoid about what some interactions i had with people meant about what they thought about me , and that felt very threatening . 
  but now 4 years later i feel secure in who i am and a bit embarassed about how on edge i was about certain things . 
  i do n't think there 's much you could or should do , except just be okay with yourself and know you did nothing wrong , and whatever she 's going through she 'll have to work out on her own . 
  if only iraq had said `` radical islam '' more baghdad would be perfectly safe , amirite ?!? 
  he 's got a point . 
  protests are n't supposed to be disruptive , as [ everyone from atlanta knows ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/martin_luther_king,_jr . 
  how did you get an it job with no degree ? 
  thanks for sharing your experience !, 
  reddit could have stricter rules about racist content . 
  i do n't know what the value is in allowing places like / r/t _ d to continue to function as a gathering point for vile sewage drinking filth . 
  plenty of discussion forums function very well and allow for heated and intense argument without having to allow this kind of anticulture . 
  i do n't get what freedom of speech has to do with it . 
  reddit is not the government , it has no obligation to serve as a platform for racism . 
  if reddit kicked them all off the site the fools would still have plenty of places to gather and spout bile , like stormfront or 8chan . 
  it is not vitally important to the health of our democracy that they have their own subreddit . 
  i was born and raised in los angeles . 
  i know all about american cultural norms . 
  i also know that trolls , flamebaiters , racists , and other disruptive assholes have been banhammered since the dawn of computing . 
  if you are accurately conveying / u/spez 's reasoning i have to say it 's a really shitty and flimsy argument . 
  what exactly is so great about not drawing a line in the sand at racism ? 
  how does that improve reddit in any way ? 
  yeah .
