  the students at the sit in have had many chances to talk to power , including on the very day of the sit in and they were not able to form coherent policy criticisms or even an explanation of what they wanted the uc to do !, 
  ro is very upset , and i feel bad for her , but just pouring out raw anger at people who ca n't do anything to bring about the justice she wants is not only futile it 's completely counterproductive . 
  i do n't know where this tuition demand came from or how it can be justified . 
  and ro is free to apply for a transfer to another uc , she just does n't want to do the paperwork . 
  i second this !, 
  is there a website keeping track of all this awful stuff coming out of the trump administration ? 
  the bombshells just drop so dizzyingly fast and furious i ca n't keep up . 
  absolutely gorgeous !,

  i 'm going to wager that you 're just dumb . 
  does that mean he rakes in 32k a month in income ? 
  i want to know how depressed i should feel about this information . 
  * sobbing intensifies *, 
  what about the giant impact idea ? 
  has that been dismissed ? 
  we are a group of ucsb students ( undergrad and grad ) who rent a house in goleta near hollister and fairview . 
  one of us is leaving at the end of february , so we are looking for someone to replace him from march 1 to the end of the lease in june . 
  the house is in a quiet location and has a large kitchen , living room and yard . 
  the house is a 3 bedroom / 2 bath , and you will have 3 male and 3 female housemates . 
  our personalities run the gamut from quiet and dedicated to outgoing and social , and we are easy to get along with . 
  there are 2 possible rooms you could be in . 
  one is a double , you would pay $ 535 and share the room with a male ucsb transfer student . 
  the other ( the larger master bedroom ) is a triple , you would pay $ 453 and the share the room with a female ucsb senior undergrad and a male ucsb grad student . 
  there is no deposit for either room . 
  if you are interested pm me with a room preference , some info about yourself , and times you are available to come by the place to check it out and meet with us . 
  thank you !, 
  i see in the sidebar that there should n't be any diagnosing here so i wo n't list symptoms , but my biological mother has ms so i 'm more familiar with it than i 'd like to be . 
  this started a few weeks ago and between multiple visits to student health and the internet i 've slowly dragged myself into admitting that this probably an attack . 
  i have a neurology referral and i called a center here in santa barbara but they said neither doctor could see me before july . 
  yeah , i 'll be able to stay alive until then ... but this is so stressful to deal with , affecting my life so much , and the uncertainty of not being sure / not having a diagnosis is n't helping . 
  should i keep calling neurologist offices until i find one who can see me soon ? 
  should i go to an urgent care center or the er ? 
  i am poor ( and not just in the college-student-poor kind of way ) so the $ 50 & $ 100 co-pays are hard to swallow , especially if they just tell me to go see a neurologist . 
  am i overreacting ? 
  is this something where i just need to grit my teeth and take it until my appointment ? 
  temazepam is letting me actually fall asleep so thankfully i can do that . 
  but this is really testing my mental health . 
  so the red star cell in el dorado has an alliance with some of the sainthood . 
  one of our cellies made a shield incorporating both the sainthood lantern and the red star red star , but she took some flak on facebook for this . 
  ( religious symbolism !!! 1111 !! 1 ! ), 
  my understanding is that the crimson cross is an in-game canon alliance between the red star and sainthood , but i do n't know how to find out any more information about this . 
  i assume there is info in some of the published novels but which one ? 
  ^ * ^ not ^ that ^ i ^ would ^ read ^ them ^ because ^ i ^ hate ^ ^ hate ^ ^ ^ hate ^ the ^ writing ^ style ^ that ^ seems ^ to ^ dominate ^ dr, 
  the series touches on trans people a few times in very different ways , and i 'm not sure what to make of it . 
  i liked what the second episode did with the theme , but i just watched the seventh episode and it turned me off . 
  thoughts ? 
  a few things have been on my mind since i watched the last episode . 
  scattered pieces that i think may fit together , somehow . 
  in the final scene before the credits , the roadhouse disappears around audrey and we see that she is in a pure white room , wearing white clothing and staring into her own reflection in a vanity mirror . 
  i believe this clues us into a few things :, 
  ** audrey 's current status **, 
  she is not in a mental institution . 
  i 've been in a few ( unfortunately ) and not only would they not be as sterile and pure white as the space audrey was in , * there is no way a psychiatric hospital would allow a vanity mirror anywhere near a patient * . 
  one of the frustrating things about being in a psych ward is not being able to really see your own appearance - there are n't any mirrors allowed , for safety reasons . 
  a mirror like the one we saw audrey using could be easily broken and the sharp glass used as a weapon by a patient to harm themselves or others . 
  i think this definitively rules it out . 
  so where is audrey ? 
  i do n't know , but she could possibly still be in a coma . 
  earlier in the episode , in the first scene we see in the hospital with coop in a coma , the very first lines of dialogue are these :, 
  bushnell : `` i just heard what you been telling me . 
  he 's in a coma , but his vital signs are good , strong . '', 
  janey-e : `` yeah . 
  but when people go into a coma they can stay there for years . '', 
  bushnell : `` oh dougie 's not going to do that . '', 
  sonny jim : `` mom , does the coma have something to do with electricity ? '', 
  janey-e : `` no , honey . '', 
  bushnell : `` well in this case it did . '', 
  i do n't think this is throwaway dialogue at all . 
  here we are being told that comas can last for years , that they can have strong and healthy vital signs , and that the coma has something to do with electricity . 
  cooper 's coma has an obvious connection - he stuck a fork in the power outlet . 
  but i think the connection with audrey is made firmer by the familiar crackle/buzz of electricity that is played over audrey 's panic in the white room . 
  ** laura & the color white **, 
  2 ) white seems to be rare in the color palette of twin peaks . 
  it 's jarring to see the camera cut from the smoky , dark roadhouse to an extremely bright white room . 
  in the original series and fwwm though , bright white light is used when certain lodge spirits make an appearance - notably the giant and bob . 
  in fire walk with me , two angels dressed in all white clothing appear near the end of the film . 
  one appears in the railcar before laura palmer and ronette polanski as bob/leland is assaulting laura . 
  the angel appears close to ronette and is witnessed by both of them . 
  after the angel disappears , ronette finds her binds undone and is able to escape with the help of mike . 
  the second angel appears after laura 's death . 
  we find laura sitting in the red room , cooper standing next to her with his arm on her shoulder . 
  laura looks incredibly sad . 
  then a bright light shines on her face and a winged angel appears before her , again clad in all white . 
  laura takes in the vision before her . 
  cooper gives a little smile . 
  the angel reaches out to laura . 
  tears start running down laura 's face , and she starts smiling and laughing . 
  she is overjoyed , almost euphoric . 
  in any case it is clearly the happiest we have ever seen laura . 
  we continue to see shots of laura and the angel , and then the screen fades to ** white ** . 
  laura 's face appears amidst the white light , a choir starts singing , and the credits roll . 
  the first time we see laura palmer in the return is in part 2 . cooper is sitting in the red room when mike introduces him to laura . 
  she is wearing the outfit and jewelry we saw her wear in the end of fwwm ( and in the original series iirc ) . 
  `` i am dead , yet i live '' laura says . 
  but she is moving backwards and talking backwards of course , like in the original series . 
  * like a spirit * .
