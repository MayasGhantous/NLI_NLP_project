  i think it 's just a consequence of a larger userbase . 
   `` you know were not going to have sex right . '', 
  but he kept pushing it . 
  i repeated the no sex thing several times . 
  he pushed me onto my back and after saying no one more time , i just gave up . 
  yes . 
  you did not give explicit consent , so this by definition is rape . 
  do n't blame yourself . 
  the guy forced sex on you after you said no , it 's his fault entirely . 
  every man is a high school boy once . 
  this . 
  the only thing i could add to this : when it is said `` smell good '' , this does * not * mean use `` perfume '' . 
  most of that stuff is dreadfully strong , even in minute amounts . 
  deodorant and shampoo - that 's it . 
  also , confidence . 
  the soviet union does n't exist anymore . 
  a little apathy toward cultural norms of `` attractive '' , is itself attractive . 
  because for so long the ussr was so secretive that the average person did n't know much about it . 
  the news reports from back then that i 've read make it sound like internal strife rather than a total collapse . 
  by the time people finally digested the whole `` fuck , it 's actually ** gone ** ... '' thing , it was a bit old to be news . 
  seconded . 
  sadly , no . 
  when you start making your own rockets , i 'd suggest glancing over the soyuz design the russians have . 
  i 've made a kerbalized version that 's a joy to fly . 
  press `` g '' to deploy . 
  * columbia, 
  if i may digress , is your username derived from darth zannah ? 
  now shoot . 
  upvoted for land before time reference . 
  it is an offshoot of oblivion . 
  so long as the elves shall look like latex , it will be worse . 
  have you considered loading the mod in the cs and looking for any attached scripts on the staff ? 
  can i have a link to the mod ? 
  i 'll have a look at it . 
  look , korolev , seeing how well [ your moon rocket ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/n1_%28rocket%29 ) worked , i 'd pipe down and fall back in line . 
  seconded . 
  keep : auriel 's bow , saviour 's hide , boots of the apostle , and hircine 's ring . 
  sell : everything else . 
  i then steal them back to decorate with or give to julan . 
  get some form of silver or better weapon asap . 
  try looking [ here ] ( http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=10506.msg158979#msg158979 ) . 
  probably to rain down vengeful death on any who dare oppose him . 
  i know that the heat shields of mercury spacecraft ( and maybe others ) were coated in a substance that slowly vaporized during the heat of re-entry . 
  when this substance vaporized , it took some of the heat it absorbed with it , thus helping cool the spacecraft . 
  i agree entirely . 
  i 'm just saying that that 's probably the reason . 
  fascinating character . 
  her final showdown with bane was epic . 
  just curious , how will they be made forward-compatible with 0.15 ? 
  * ample, 
  actually , i hated the ending to that . 
  i like endings where the protagonist goes `` home '' , lives happily ever after , etc. 
  call me soft , but it 's true . 
  ender 's game , while a * fantastic * story , had and ending that just would not settle with me . 
  [ it is n't if you do n't want it to be ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/qghyy/canonicity_of_lore/ ) . 
  try [ millenaire ] ( http://millenaire.org/ ) . 
  best npc mod ever . 
  all chunks are 16x16 . 
  telvanni tower in the skies of hell . 
  wip . 
  yes . 
  quite a bit , due to all of the space . 
  i almost never do , but when i do , it 's blunt and to the point . 
  if i 'm wrong , i 'll admit it and back off , but if i have the advantage , i will ruthlessly exploit every bit of it i can . 
  formerly , they could n't , because the area was outside of the chunk . 
  now , with the increased height limit , stuff spawns there a ton . 
  just wait for a bit . 
  it was 128 , now it 's 256 . 
  yeah , we understand you . 
  outlander . 
  seed ? 
  well , all slaves are by definition n'wahs . 
  how do you `` dock '' ? 
  i know how to get close . 
  just wanted the clarification you gave . 
  this is true . 
  it also gives you more credibility when you * are * right . 
  you 're getting there , just keep at it !, 
  out of curiosity , why 0.14 + ? 
  [ done in 0.13.2 ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/kerbalspaceprogram/comments/putxh/i_made_it_to_the_mun_all_stock_thanks_for_the/ ), 
  we demand kitty . 
  i know the feeling . 
  finished what ? 
  longtime thief , nerevarine on the side . 
  thank you , op , for this long awaited delivery . 
  azura is the cattiest bitch out of all of the princes . 
  unrelated , but if your username has a story behind it , i want to hear it . 
  i 'm glad you were able to pull through that . 
  whole new level of respect . 
  source ? 
  out of curiosity , is it possible to give the flairs as an option to people who have completed the challenge so we do n't have to worry about resetting it ? 
  seed ? 
  are you suggesting i need an excuse ? 
  eastern ... quarter , tops . 
  yes , but once seen , ** it can not be unseen ** . 
  umm ... no . 
  i find it very hard to be sexually attracted to someone unless i know them well . 
  nords love talos because he was a nord who conquered all of tamriel , founded the empire , and became a god . 
  in other , the ultimate nordic badass . 
  at some point , will openmw be compatible with existing morrowind mods ?
