  i plan to keep it up at least to hoi if i can , but i 'm not rushing it ; i need to make it interesting without burning myself out !, 
  do you have a link ? 
  i ca n't seem to find it anywhere . 
  definitely going to condense the majority of that out next time ; you 're right about it coming to nothing . 
  thanks for the feedback . 
  first time getting to face a b-17 in a good few weeks . 
  this one was either unusually obliging or oblivious , and let me put in dead ahead and just below . 
  had both left engines on fire before the gunners even started shooting , and escaped without a scratch !, 
  definitely one of phil ochs ' [ funnier songs ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u52oz-54vyw ) . 
  real shame his depression got him ; he was a brilliant songwriter . 
  the two side by side like that remind me of the arms of the cromwellian protectorate . 
  if you get up to german jets , the arado 234 c-3 . 
  2x20mm mg151 in the nose , and , because it is itself a bomber , it gets a bomber spawn . 
  point yourself at the enemy bomber spawn , line up directly ahead , and pump their engines full of shells , [ like so ] ( http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/248088103748220606/fbdfc13ba859d8f794cad8d0db3c9129d6969db6/ ) . 
  yes . 
  some states have laws punishing faithless electors for that reason , though if i recall , their constitutionality has yet to be tested . 
  that 's awesome !, 
  wish i could see interesting things like that , but around here , just football banners if anything . 
  looks so much like an il-28 . 
  i 've also re-enabled the first one , so everything should be visible now . 
  not sure why the filter 's going trigger happy on you . 
  i 've had no trouble managing bv238s with a p-39 / 63 . 
  if it took three * hunters * to take them out , that 's entirely on the hunter pilots . 
  yeah , i agree that bombers and the entire way they work in the game needs to be re-worked . 
  my point with that comment is that there 's a specific method to kill most bombers that works with some consistency ( pound a wing/engines ) , so they 're not unstoppable ( usually ) . 
  welcome to the service of our glorious lord !, 
  all hail !, 
  feel free to post screenshots or ask questions over at / r/arado if you 'd like . 
  our lord 's temple is n't the busiest place , but we 'd welcome the company . 
  sounds like your mum made some top-quality dad jokes . 
  the basement of loving . 
  no , that 's rule 0 . 
  really nice aar . 
  keep it up !, 
  hulking fabricants , but those are sotha sil 's constructs , not natural creatures . 
  / r/patches765, 
   the people who wrote the amendment actually were n't thinking about immigrants at all . 
  that 's actually [ completely wrong ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/citizenship_clause#senate_debate ) . 
  an excerpt from [ one debate ] ( http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collid=llcg&amp;filename=070/llcg070.db&amp;recnum=603 ) :, 
  `` mr. cowan : `` i will ask whether it will not have the effect of naturalizing the children of chinese and gypsies born in this country ? '', 
  mr. trumbull : `` undoubtedly . '', 
  mr. trumbull : `` i understand that under the naturalization laws the children who are born here of parents who have not been naturalized are citizens . 
  this is the law , as i understand it , at the present time . 
  is not the child born in this country of german parents a citizen ? 
  i am afraid we have got very few citizens in some of the counties of good old pennsylvania if the children born of german parents are not citizens . '', 
  mr. cowan : `` the honorable senator assumes that which is not the fact . 
  the children of german parents are citizens ; but germans are not chinese ; germans are not australians , nor hottentots , nor anything of the kind . 
  that is the fallacy of his argument . '', 
  mr. trumbull : `` if the senator from pennsylvania will show me in the law any distinction made between the children of german parents and the children of asiatic parents , i may be able to appreciate the point which he makes ; but the law makes no such distinction ; and the child of an asiatic is just as much of a citizen as the child of a european . '' '', 
  there is now !, 
  pm me if you want to help or do css ; i 'll be fleshing this out more after work . 
  / u/finlandaar is correct : anyone can give answers , but you have to be able to back them up . 
  can second haven given a few myself . 
  rule 5 : playing as the uk in my `` fuck the us however humanly possible '' game , i sphered hawaii decades ago . 
  they 've now westernized , and are already throwing everything they 've got into the desolate russian front . 
  mod is hpm . 
  yeah , my bad . 
  i threw all my gold and men into balkanizing the daylights out of the usa . 
  [ it worked , ] ( http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/96095019439207395/e8643dd787de6dd4acf55e977a9631d5c89baeaf/ ) but it did let germany take the # 1 spot . 
  they added it as a wargoal when i called them into a war with the us . 
  intentional . 
  to the two people who reported this : please send a modmail when you do so , or i have no idea what the reports are about . 
  as it is , this does n't violate any rules , and is staying up . 
  fair enough . 
  i 've added the tag , which should hopefully make everyone happy . 
  what puzzles me here is that it seems to specifically be the usa . 
  hell , * syria * had no issue sending 50k men to japan ( i mean , they got stomped , but they got there ) . 
  men have xy sex chromosomes , women have xx . 
  replace shaun 's y chromosome with an x = woman . 
  i read this in the voice of dr. borous from old world blues , and it sounded magnificent . 
  interestingly , construction is probably the single most metrication-resistant industry in the us . 
  tools marked in metric are a little more available than they used to be ( often to work on imported cars ) , but they 're still very much the small minority . 
  a lot of it is just habit . 
  even after spending a little bit of time working with it in my shop and welding classes , thinking in , say , 8ths/16ths/32s of inches is automatic . 
  mods ? 
  give me about an hour , and i 'll take some more and update the workshop entry . 
  i 've been meaning to since september , so i should probably get around to it ... 
  workshop page was updated with seven more images of the island . 
  texas here : your temperatures in december are actually very close to ours . 
  it 's going to be 44 degrees f ^ ^ reedom today ( ~ 9 degrees c ^ ^ ommie ) , and that 's very unusual . 
  the high this weekend is 69 , which is warmer than dunedin , where my brother is ( though yes , i 'm aware dunedin is on the southern end of nz ) . 
  and because we 're total wimps for the cold , we 're still freezing our asses off . 
  nice to know . 
  i may very possibly be in your gorgeous country toward the end of summer , so i 'm very interested to compare !, 
  wow , thank you !, 
  i 'll have to spend some time checking this out . 
  pretty sure the question is about the paris commune of 1871 ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/paris_commune ) , not the city of paris , which is a department and commune of france ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/communes_of_france ), 
  now that is a gorgeous plane . 
  wow , that 's definitely one of the colorize bot 's better jobs . 
  the us probably wins . 
  you may be misunderstanding the relationship between the commonwealth realms and the uk , assuming you were wondering what the implications would be for us-uk relations . 
  the commonwealth realms are totally independent , and share no legal link with the united kingdom , rather , with the monarch . 
  in canada , for example , elizabeth ii is not queen by virtue of being the british monarch ; she holds the legally separate position of `` queen of canada '' . 
  it is also possible , and has happened , that the monarch can be `` at war '' with themselves as ruler of nations on opposite sides ( indo-pakistani war of 1947 , and indeed , during the grenada invasion ) . 
  now , if the uk vocally condemns it , it would certainly strain relations , but the condemnation would come from the uk as a third party , and not due to any sense of the us meddling in anything that could be described as british internal affairs . 
  i guess it would still count if ryukyu * is * the world . 
  or what 's left of it . 
  eh , the libertarians do have at least one former governor , and have managed to at the very least maintain universal or near-universal ballot access . 
  i may not like them , but they do know what they 're doing . 
  probably would fall under magic .
