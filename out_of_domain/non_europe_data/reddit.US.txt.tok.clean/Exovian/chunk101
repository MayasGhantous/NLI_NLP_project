  someone 's got to be that guy . 
  thank you for your service . 
  so for anyone wondering , this was actually a thing . 
  / u/dota2 _ souperman covered some of the economic aspects of the problem , but there are also social barriers to this . 
  i 'll first get out of the way that i do n't think these are as much of a driving force as the economic problems , but they 're worth considering :, 
  a lot of rural or small-town areas are insular as * hell . 
  * if you 're not in the old boy 's club , you 're going to have a much harder time integrating with the existing community . 
  do n't go to a local church ? 
  the right social events ? 
  the right * funerals * ( not even kidding , this can be a thing ) ? 
  and god help you if you ( or your spouse ) are n't white . 
  this is n't even far out in the sticks , towns with 10,000 + people have this problem . 
  it 's very hard to change a place when that place actively clings to attitudes and cultures that make you feel unwelcome . 
  full disclosure , much of that statement is based on my own experience visiting family who still live in just such a place , and is as such anecdotal . 
  but my experience has been fairly bleak . 
  it 's very hard to care about , or want to invest in , a place where even toeing the line perfectly only gets you as far as being the token big-city liberal that gets talked about like a zoo exhibit for holidays , and the one cousin who really cared about her education became a pariah when she was caught dating a black man . 
  these parts of america have to want to move forward , and some just do n't . 
  rule 2 : `` keep it historical . 
  questions should be set in the past , so no current events , * and they should not require magic * or time-travel to occur . 
  offer context if you can . '', 
  ... wow . 
  by the looks of it , they did * nothing * right building that plane , to such a comical extent that it 's kind of impressive . 
  certainly !, 
  we were assaulting an [ illithid ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/illithid ) settlement in the middle of a desert . 
  the dm has made some changes to some of the races in his campaign , and one change is that the illithids have a diminutive sub-race that they keep as slaves . 
  we sent the rogue in to snatch one so that we could learn more about the compound before we attacked . 
  at some point , another player and i were joking about how we should just lead the slaves in a glorious people 's revolution to overthrow the illithids , and then remembered that if we really wanted to , * we could actually do that . 
  * so we did , and the one we snatched became our contact with the rest of the slaves . 
  before we moved on , i decided to write a basic set of laws to help the newly freed slaves govern themselves . 
  [ this constitution , ] ( https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lig6q_gdrfcmi_8c-dbyl34juqtyf_eovwcepxfnly4/edit?usp=sharing ) and this banner , were the result . 
  `` lheind\u00f4l\u00faans '' is what i decided to rename the former slave race ; it roughly means `` free minds '' in sindarin . 
  gives off a bit of a redoran vibe , yes . 
  get some plaster and a bit of paint and it 's definitely there . 
  have to do better than that to perforate the great lord . 
  284 on steam ... and that 's a small fraction of what i 've put onto my disc copies . 
  probably  3,000 all told . 
  i do n't think weapons and training were the problem , so much as the fact that germans were sick and tired of the war . 
  if werwolf had the means to carry out attacks , my guess is that you 'd simply see the german populace turn on them . 
  love the aar by the way . 
  thanks for doing it !, 
  year was 1855 . 
  as i said in my edit , it was literally only my holding silesia that stopped them . 
  glue can actually be incredibly effective when used to hold wood together . 
   well , if china attacks the uk to take hong kong , that is an attack on a nato member . 
   the parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them * in europe or north america * shall be considered an attack against them all, 
   for the purpose of article 5 , an armed attack on one or more of the parties is deemed to include an armed attack : on the territory of any of the parties in europe or north america , on the algerian departments of france [ 2 ] , on the territory of or on the islands under the jurisdiction of any of the parties in the north atlantic area north of the tropic of cancer ; on the forces , vessels , or aircraft of any of the parties , when in or over these territories or any other area in europe in which occupation forces of any of the parties were stationed on the date when the treaty entered into force or the mediterranean sea or the north atlantic area north of the tropic of cancer . 
  if you 're willing to type it up , i 'm not opposed to a long answer . 
  thank you very much ; that was the best i 've read on this so far . 
   ms foster also posted a picture on facebook of a guinea pig wearing heart-shaped glasses , with the caption `` ca n't see all the haters when i got my love glasses on '' . 
  ... damn . 
  she suddenly a fan of our president-elect , or has she always been this nutty ? 
  no , texas . 
  it 's not exactly a huge story , but since i make a point of following international news as best i can , it came up , plus one of our national services ran a story on it . 
   [ ... ] having built cities since 2013 when we started the development it felt really good to see them burn . 
  never change , / u/co _ martsu . 
  not quite right . 
  germany was unified in 1871 , toward the end of the franco-prussian war , over 45 years before wwi . 
  * diamond joe, 
  i 'm down . 
  it 's not really a choice . 
  bush is president regardless of what clinton says . 
  if clinton tries to forcefully prevent bush from taking office , he 's taken into custody by the secret service . 
   the silver legion of america , commonly known as the silver shirts , was an underground american ** fascist organization ** founded by william dudley pelley that was headquartered in asheville , north carolina [ 1 ] and announced publicly on january 30 , 1933 . 
  should n't be , no . 
  [ nope .

  welcome back after yet another too-long break . 
  massive credit to / u/cargoshortssensei for her aar shaming me into getting my butt in gear . 
  enjoy !, 
  no , the president of the senate is the vice president . 
  makes them a tributary , after which they pay you 40 % of their income every month . 
  bit of a shameless plug , but i 'm doing a [ norse aar ] ( https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/index.php?threads/children-of-odin-a-norse-grand-campaign.975517/ ) right now , if you 'd like to take a look at it for ideas . 
  ok , thank you . 
  by your flair , will you be leading a socialist/communist faction when the server moves out of testing ? 
  because i 'd be down for joining that . 
  i 've not yet found one label that accurately represents me views , and i 'm not in a hurry , as some of my experiences irl lead me to think that focusing too much on labels can spawn a self-destructive degree of ideological purism . 
  if i had to pick , i 'd say a three-way mix of social democracy , democratic socialism , and guild socialism . 
  bit of a gardener/farmer . 
  hiddenore 's being a bit odd : unlike the description on the website , i 've only seen ore generate as isolated blocks , not veins . 
  also , it seems to activate any time a nearby block is changed . 
  for instance , i placed a mushroom in by base , and when i broke it , the stone it was on turned to gold ore . 
  i 'm not sure how exactly things work , but i could see that being fairly exploitable . 
  no , enough of us are perfectly aware of what the difference is . 
  so that 's what happened ... 
  they ca n't . 
  judicial review determines if something violates the constitution . 
  the constitution can not violate itself . 
  you do n't need to place blocks to exploit this . 
  it works perfectly fine on natural blocks as well . 
  ooh , you are correct . 
  did n't think about that , for some reason . 
  i 'll have to keep that in mind , this stuff is great . 
  do you mind giving us an idea of roughly what you do pricing like ? 
  pretty big fan of mango mussolini myself . 
  they really need to figure out how to have east and west german jets on different sides of battles before they do that . 
   i 'm willing to compromise with moderate socialism , but none of that ancap shit, 
  welcome aboard !, 
  i see / u/bolledeboll has already told you how to get on the discord , so i think that 's about all there is to say for now . 
  as has been said , that 's 80 % of all cases that are appealed to the supreme court ( a very small percentage of cases ) and that are actually taken up by the sc ( reducing the number further ) . 
  80 % is on the upper end of normal , but it 's not exactly crazy .
