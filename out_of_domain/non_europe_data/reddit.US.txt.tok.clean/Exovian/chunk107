  weekly challenges : every saturday , at the same time the tech help thread is posted , and new weekly challenge and activity activity will be posted . 
  the activity will vary on a bi-weekly basis to avoid putting too much strain on the mods . 
  as soon as flair is implemented ( yes , this is planned ) , custom flair will be awarded for completing challenges . 
  the rules for the challenges are :, 
  * unless stated otherwise , only content from the base game , two expansions , and official bethesda mods can be used to complete the challenge . 
  other plugins may be installed , just not used in the challenge . 
  * proof of completion must be submitted as either images or videos . 
  simply saying `` i did it '' is not enough . 
  * anyone who admits to having cheated in a challenge will have `` i < 3 cliff racers '' or cliff racer flair appended to their name for a period of one week . 
  up for re-consideration should the users desire . 
  as per the [ new rules ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/morrowind/comments/11s1pj/new_tech_help_rules_and_weekly_challenges/ ) , all tech help is to be discussed in this thread . 
  pm me with any questions , and thank you for your cooperation . 
  [ rules . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/morrowind/comments/11s1pj/new_tech_help_rules_and_weekly_challenges/ ), 
  this week 's challenge is deceptively simple : acquire the hat of a [ gondolier ] ( http://www.uesp.net/wiki/file:mw-npc-talsi_uvayn.jpg ) in vivec city . 
  there is , however , a catch : you can not kill the gondolier . 
  to complete the challenge :, 
  * you must have the hat . 
  * the gondolier must be alive and peaceful toward you . 
  * you can not have a bounty ( losing it via the thieves guild is acceptable ) . 
  * you must post at least one picture showing you wearing the hat , and the hatless gondolier . 
  this can be either on this page or the main page . 
  good luck , and pm me with and new challenge ideas !, 
  this next challenge takes us to the frozen isle of solstheim . 
  to complete this challenge , you must collect at least one sample of heartwood from the local spriggans . 
  you might think that for something so easy , there 's bound to be a catch , and you 'd be right . 
  spriggans stop dropping heartwood after level 3 , which makes obtaining it very difficult . 
  to maintain the spirit of the challenge , blatant abuse of the alchemy or magic system is forbidden . 
  `` abuse '' will be determined case by case if there is a question , but if you use your head you should be fine . 
  proof for this challenge should consist of a screenshot showing a dead spriggan , the heartwood , and your character menu with your level ( which may be no higher than 3 ) visible . 
  as we all know , during the battle of red mountain , the dwemer attempted to ascend to godhood by binding their entire race into the numidium . 
  it has been suggested that this failed due to the absence of yagrum bagarn , who was in an `` outer realm '' at the time . 
  a [ brief discussion ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/129i90/the_dwemers_fate_as_an_echo_of_anu/c6tcbvf ) with / u/lilrhys raised the question of the dwarven spectres and their role in the failure of this endeavor . 
  also relevant is the fact that yagrum mentioned some strong disagreements between the tonal architects over the viability of kagrenac 's plans . 
  [ conjecture ] ( / g `` the dwarven spectres are remnants of dwemer that chose to sabotage the ascension by pulling themselves out at the last minute , dooming the remaining dwemer to be bound into the brass skin of numidium rather than completing their ascension into godhood . '' ), 
  another , but less dramatic possibility , is that kagrenac simply did n't include the ghosts in the calling to ascension . 
  this left dwemer souls outside of the process , thus failing to ascend as a race . 
  to be clear , i live in a safe , upscale neighborhood . 
  what gives ? 
  as inspired by occupytamriel 's [ fork-beard must die !, 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/morrowind/comments/1214nf/forkbeard_must_die_or_my_journey_from_seyda_neen/ ) mission , our newest challenge features fewer restrictions , but far more walking . 
  your objective is to create a new character and visit every council member for every great house . 
  as per noumenon72 's criticism , you 're inviting all of them to a party . 
  this does not include divayth fyr , as he is not a councilor , nor baladas demnevanni , as he is not a councilor at the beginning of the game . 
  edit : or dagoth ur , because i ca n't reasonably expect that of most of us . 
  rules :, 
  * no fast travel . 
  this means striders , guild guides , boats , intervention , and recall . 
  * you may use the 87 gold you get upon release in whatever way you see fit . 
  weapons , armor , etc. 
  all other income must come from the sale of the fish scales and racer plumes that you will invariably pick up . 
  * you may level up during the mission , but you may not engage in any quests until you are done . 
  * you may not steal anything . 
  proof will consist of screenshots next to each one . 
  for the curious , i used whirlwind sprint to glitch into the entrance of the tower of mzark . 
  [ 5 seconds into the trailer ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osroquwahnq&feature=player_detailpage#t=5s ) , on the side of an imperial-looking building , are banners featuring a design looking very much like the scarabs on [ house dagoth 's flag ] ( http://www.uesp.net/wiki/file:housedagoth_flag.png ) . 
  is there any way this makes sense , and that the dagoths have returned ? 
  starting this week , the challenges will be held very two weeks rather than every week . 
  after this past week 's challenge , it 's clear i need to put more time into designing them than i have been , as well as give people more time to finish them . 
  i also hope to implement flair for those who complete them , and soon after , a selection of flair for everyone else . 
  to compensate for the reduction in challenges , two other activities will be introduced , each once per month , occupying the weeks between challenges . 
  these are photo missions and mod challenges . 
  a brief explanation of each :, 
  a photo mission will be a criteria for a picture or set of pictures , which you will then set out to get . 
  for example , `` create a photo gallery of lower-class life in st. delyn canton '' . 
  mods may be used in the game the pictures are taken in , but mod content may not be used to fulfill the criteria for the challenge . 
  a mod challenge is similar , but instead of a picture criteria , one is given for a mod instead . 
  for example , `` provide a backstory quest to arlowe and the banhammer '' . 
  these wo n't be overly hard , and are designed to get new or prospective modders involved with the community . 
  the deadline for both of these will be one month , until the next challenge of that type is issued . 
  this week , we have a photo mission : capture an image of a dunmer fortress . 
  it can be at any time of day , for any angle , at any fortress . 
  try to make it as interesting as possible , preferably invoking a desired emotion in a viewer . 
  the last note regards the tech help threads . 
  they 've been working very well , this is just a reminder to read them and contribute . 
  this weeks challenge involves collecting the many [ cursed items ] ( http://www.uesp.net/wiki/morrowind:cursed_items ) found throughout vvardenfell . 
  to complete the challenge , gather one of every type of cursed item in the game , 13 total . 
  bonus if you open the two cursed chests as well . 
  in other news , / r/kerbalspaceprogram moderator / u/pandaeldiablo has been helping me understand the workings of flair , so expect that soon !, 
  * wake , sharmat , *, 
  * pride-born blight . 
  * to your brass hearth *,
