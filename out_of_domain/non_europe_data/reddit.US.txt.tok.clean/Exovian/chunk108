  * in azura 's coast ( 13 , 5 ) , you can find the corpse of an npc named arlowe . 
  on the corpse is the banhammer . 
  his fate perhaps demonstrates the danger of being too liberal with the use of this tool ... *, 
  this week 's challenge is to make a small quest mod , which should explain the history of the banhammer , and explain the fate of it 's owner , arlowe . 
  rules are :, 
  - the entry must include a download link to the mod . 
  - any adult content must be marked as such on the submission . 
  - the mod can only be dependent on morrowind , it 's expansions , and official bethesda mods . 
  i encourage any of you who have never made a mod to get involved in this . 
  modding has contributed greatly to the longevity of morrowind , and it is my hope that these challenges may introduce some of you to the modding scene . 
  tutorials for those new to the cs can be found [ here ] ( http://www.morrowind-oblivion.com/morrowind_cs_tutorials.php ) . 
  my appologies for this week 's challenge being so late ; i took an unexpected trip to the deadlands of oblivion to visit relatives . 
  as i have said before , i am working on implementing flair for / r/morrowind . 
  morrowind is a large and varied game , and i think any flair should represent that variety . 
  [ here ] ( http://imgur.com/a/bi3ia ) is some faction flair i made a few months ago , to show the what i can do . 
  i 'd like some input as to what else , if anything , should be added ( i know there was some interest in adding creature flair , and things from the expansions ) , and about the current proposals . 
  you can submit your own ideas , but 60x35 pixels is preferred . 
  currently , the only real rules in place regard tech help , and the related threads . 
  as a recap , the rules state that all tech help goes in the weekly thread , to avoid cluttering the main page . 
  now , this has met with varying degrees of success , and the number of resolved issues has declined somewhat . 
  i 've also been lax about implementation , and there are some tech help threads on the main page right now . 
  my questions for you are :, 
  are you happy with the rules ? 
  should mod issues also be covered by the tech help threads ? 
  what is the best way to improve it ? 
  the other thing i have to mention is this : while i like having the tech help threads , they need to be doing their job . 
  that means that even if we are n't having issues , we need to occasionally peruse the thread to help those that are . 
  if that ca n't happen , then we need another solution . 
  this is the journey of exovian through the land of morrowind . 
  this started as a way to kill time during school , but i plan to work on it for a while yet . 
  enjoy . 
  i suppose it begins on the ship . 
  it was a prison ship , a native build pressed into imperial service , which was a practice dating back to katariah . 
  i wonder what the old empress would think , seeing the practice applied to her own people . 
  political history aside , this bilgewater-laden tub did n't handle storms well and the journey around black marsh was as unpleasant as any i 've had since . 
  eventually though , you just leaned to sleep through them . 
  never soundly , though . 
  could n't sleep for an hour with one dream or another . 
  the last day out at sea was stormy , as usual . 
  i dreamed as usual . 
  but by y' ffre , it was a strange one . 
  it started with the same nightmare i 'd had ever since learning i was being deported to the ashpit the natives call morrowind . 
  dusty wastes , red blight , the usual . 
  then everything got very strange , and a reverberating female voice began to speak . 
  * `` they have taken you from the imperial city 's prisons '' *, 
  yes , they had . 
  a stocky woman in scaled armor and a curved sword had dragged me out of it , to be precise . 
  * `` first by carriage , and now by boat '' *, 
  and a damn bumpy ride it was , too . 
  * `` to the east , to morrowind . 
  that 's the idea . 
  * `` fear not , for i am watching . 
  you have been chosen . 
  now , the only thing i 've ever been chosen for was to hold the getaway horse outside red diamond jewelry , and the only time i 've been watched was after i got arrested for it . 
  so you 'll understand if this dream , in addition to calling my sanity into question , did not exactly fill me with comfort . 
  `` wake up . 
  we 're here . 
  why are you shaking ? 
  are you ok ? '', 
  i suppose being woken up by the dunmer came as something of a relief . 
  he was grey-skinned and bare chested . 
  if i saw him now , i 'd instantly mark him as native . 
  he wore gold ear-rings in a fashionable style , and his voice bore the trace of years of ash and hackle-lo smoke . 
  `` wake up . 
  stand up . '', 
  he said . 
  `` there you go . 
  you were dreaming .
