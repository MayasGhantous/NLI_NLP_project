  what 's your name ? '', 
  was it that obvious ? 
  at any rate , the dark elf was waiting for his response . 
  `` exovian '' i replied . 
  the mer nodded . 
  `` well , not even last night 's storm could wake you . 
  i heard them say we 've reached morrowind . 
  i 'm sure they 'll let us go . '', 
  as he spoke , the sound of bootsteps began echoing through the creaking hull . 
  `` quiet , '' he hissed . 
  `` here comes the guard . '', 
  the guard was a short man , well-muscled with brown hair and looking as though he 'd handled the night nearly as poorly as i. 
  nonetheless , a reluctant authority hardened his features , and he said to me in a tone that invited no argument : `` this is where you get off . 
  come with me . '', 
  as he led me out of the hold , i took a moment to take one last look around the ship . 
  the tables were still out from last night . 
  breakfast had not been served , but already some sailors were quietly gnawing on their rations . 
  as we climbed the steps to the upper level , the swaying of the ship became more pronounced , and in the dim light of the hold this made moving somewhat difficult . 
  at last , we reached the hatch leading to the deck . 
  the imperial stood next to the steps and motioned for me to continue . 
  `` get yourself up on deck , and let 's keep this as civil as possible . '', 
  fine by me , imperial . 
  there was no hesitation as i reached for that hatch . 
  i had no idea what was on the other side and frankly , i did n't care . 
  it was a new country , a new chance , and hopefully , freedom . 
  this week is something entirely different ; we 're going to be taking morrowind into another art form , specifically user flair . 
  as i 've said before , i 've been planning the introduction of flair for some time . 
  however , with school , volunteer work , and the holidays soon to come , i have not been able to devote enough time to the task . 
  [ here ] ( http://imgur.com/a/bi3ia#0 ) are flairs i 've made before . 
  this week , anyone can submit an image , no more than 60x35px , as potential flair . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/morrowind/comments/13rns3/flair_discussion/ ) is the flair discussion from 2 weeks ago , with several ideas for flair . 
  replacement mage flair , preferably in the style of the others , would also be good , as would flair for the expansions . 
  on the other hand , anything goes for submissions , with the caveat that all images from the game must be from vanilla morrowind . 
  at the end of the week , i 'll post a vote for what flair to include . 
  this is the journey of exovian through the land of morrowind . 
  this started as a way to kill time during school , but i plan to work on it for a while yet . 
  enjoy . 
  i suppose it begins on the ship . 
  it was a prison ship , a native build pressed into imperial service , which was a practice dating back to katariah . 
  i wonder what the old empress would think , seeing the practice applied to her own people . 
  political history aside , this bilgewater-laden tub did n't handle storms well and the journey around black marsh was as unpleasant as any i 've had since . 
  eventually though , you just leaned to sleep through them . 
  never soundly , though . 
  could n't sleep for an hour with one dream or another . 
  the last day out at sea was stormy , as usual . 
  i dreamed as usual . 
  but by y' ffre , it was a strange one . 
  it started with the same nightmare i 'd had ever since learning i was being deported to the ashpit the natives call morrowind . 
  dusty wastes , red blight , the usual . 
  then everything got very strange , and a reverberating female voice began to speak . 
  * `` they have taken you from the imperial city 's prisons '' *, 
  yes , they had . 
  a stocky woman in scaled armor and a curved sword had dragged me out of it , to be precise . 
  * `` first by carriage , and now by boat '' *, 
  and a damn bumpy ride it was , too . 
  * `` to the east , to morrowind . 
  that 's the idea . 
  * `` fear not , for i am watching . 
  you have been chosen . 
  now , the only thing i 've ever been chosen for was to hold the getaway horse outside red diamond jewelry , and the only time i 've been watched was after i got arrested for it . 
  so you 'll understand if this dream , in addition to calling my sanity into question , did not exactly fill me with comfort . 
  `` wake up . 
  we 're here . 
  why are you shaking ? 
  are you ok ? '', 
  i suppose being woken up by the dunmer came as something of a relief . 
  he was grey-skinned and bare chested . 
  if i saw him now , i 'd instantly mark him as native . 
  he wore gold ear-rings in a fashionable style , and his voice bore the trace of years of ash and hackle-lo smoke . 
  `` wake up . 
  stand up . '', 
  he said . 
  `` there you go . 
  you were dreaming . 
  what 's your name ? '', 
  was it that obvious ? 
  at any rate , the dark elf was waiting for his response . 
  `` exovian '' i replied . 
  the mer nodded . 
  `` well , not even last night 's storm could wake you . 
  i heard them say we 've reached morrowind . 
  i 'm sure they 'll let us go . '', 
  as he spoke , the sound of bootsteps began echoing through the creaking hull .

  very simple , really .
