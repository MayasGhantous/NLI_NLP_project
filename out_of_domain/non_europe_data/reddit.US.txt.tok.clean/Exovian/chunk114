  i must have found jasmine 's suggestion an agreeable one indeed , because i slept like a drunken imga until the following morning . 
  [ part 8 here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtamriel/comments/1eals0/morrowind_fanfic_from_the_shadow_of_the_dragon/ ) . 
  as the morning dawned outside , the sounds of dragonflies and countess insects and perhaps amphibians could be heard coming from beyond the door to the cave . 
  it was a pleasant enough sound to listen to , and i spent the first few minutes of morning curled up in the sacks and taking in the noises . 
  a few feet over , jasmine yawned and began to stretch . 
  hastily , i felt for one of the torches the bandits had left and lit it in the remains of the fire . 
  it cast a respectable amount of light , more than enough to wake up to . 
  jasmine finally rose from the makeshift bed she had made for herself . 
  a good night 's sleep had done wonders for her , and she seemed much more composed now than she had the previous night . 
  as the torchlight played with her features , it occurred to me that she was strikingly pretty . 
  handsome , even , if the word were applied to a female . 
  turning away , i gathered my weapons and put on most of my armor . 
  i left the helmet off , as there was no need for it now , and it did constrict my vision a good bit . 
  i looked again around the cave . 
  now that the bandits were gone , i debated doing what i had come for and looting the, 
  cavern . 
  i could certainly profit from it , but it was in my interest to get to balmora quickly . 
  on the other hand , a little delay might convince the empire to find someone else to do their dirty work . 
  these thoughts still in my mind , i went back into the cave to find whatever of value i could . 
  disappointingly , the primary focus of the bandits seemed to be the trafficking of moon sugar and skooma , which was worthless to me . 
  even if i had no objection to its trade , i had nowhere to sell it . 
  however , some of the cave did yield a decent amount of money . 
  there were a few low-grade soul gems , which would be worth a little once i got to balmora . 
  the other goods in the cave were less tempting , mostly just rations and more drugs . 
  as i looked around , i noticed several entrances to chambers farther back in the caves . 
  i climbed down carefully , and walked into the opening . 
  the tunnel soon turned right , and i found myself looking at a very odd scene . 
  there was a patch of luminescent fungi , with the remains of a skeleton scattered in it . 
  also present was a pauldron of some kind of leather and several gold coins . 
  i walked over and began picking up the coins . 
  i left the armor , as it was quite inferior to my own , but as i picked up the coins , i saw a glint coming from behind a fern . 
  pushing it back , i saw a rather ordinary looking ring . 
  slipping it on , i sensed a slight tinge of magic , and felt a little bit faster and more confident . 
  not a huge advantage , but enough to be worth keeping . 
  the cave yielded little else , so i returned to the entrance . 
  jasmine was waiting , and as i approached , the beckoned to me . 
  `` exovian , '' she asked , `` would you mind taking me back to my house ? 
  i could make it myself , but without my usual equipment , i 'd prefer company on the way back to town . '', 
  `` certainly , '' i said . 
  `` where is your house ? '', 
  `` it 's on the edge of town , on the northwest side . 
  just across a little inlet from fargoth 's house . '', 
  `` that 's fairly close . 
  let 's get going . '', 
  we walked up the spiral path leading to the entrance , and pushed our way into the light . 
  the sun had risen a little above the horizon , and the insects were beginning to calm down . 
  we made our way around the pond and , blinking back the glare of the sun , found our way back to the path leading to town . 
  sorry this one 's late , folks !, 
  i have a great map going , small brook , main fort dug underground around a volcano , etc. 
  the problem is that i have almost no iron , apart from a small bit of hematite on a mountaintop . 
  should i import some ? 
  additionally , what are the best replacements in weapon and armor production ? 
  we 're back !, 
  i 've been taking a bit of a break , but it 's time to start posting again . 
  for any of you who have n't read the previous installments , here are links to them , something i intend to provide every 10th installment :,

  jasmine and i made our way back into town , and walked across the north end of seyda neen to her house . 
  it was a simple one-story building like most other houses in the town . 
  when we came to the house , she took a key from under a plant near the door and unlocked the house . 
  she paused for a moment , then turned to me . 
  `` come inside . 
  i want to talk to you about something . '', 
  following her , i walked inside the house . 
  she gestured to a seat in an unusually well-funished living room and disappeared . 
  a few minutes later , she walked out dressed in a set of leather armor . 
  she sat down and looked at me . 
  after a moment , she composed herself and began to speak . 
  `` lately i 've been getting bored around here , helping elone , at the tradehouse , map out the smugglers caves . 
  i want to explore more of vvardenfell , maybe even the telvanni areas in the east , someday . 
  if you 'll let me travel with you , i 'd get to do that . 
  and you might even find i can be a good person to have along . '', 
  `` who are the telvanni ? '' i asked . 
  `` they 're reclusive wizard lords . 
  very protective of themselves , and not incredibly welcoming of the empire . 
  rumors has it they even grow towers out of the local fungi . '', 
  that was too bad , i thought . 
  if they were a bit friendlier , they could have provided a place to go to escape the eyes of the empire . 
  as for jasmine 's offer of company , i saw no reason she could n't come . 
  i could use the companionship , and an extra pair of hands would be helpful . 
  on the other hand , i barely knew her . 
  she would bear close watching , though she had risked her life to save mine . 
  i could only hope we would get along when we adventured on our own . 
  then again , if it worked out , i could see some time together being nice ... 
  `` very well . 
  we can travel together . 
  before we go too far , i have some business to attend to in the town of balmora . 
  after that is taken care of , we can travel farther . '', 
  jasmine considered this for a moment , then nodded . 
  it 's late enough in the morning that we should take the strider if we want to arrive before dark . 
  are you ready to go ? '', 
  `` i am . 
  if you have everything you need , let 's go . '',
