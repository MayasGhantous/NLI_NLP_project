  the two of us got up and walked to the door . 
  she held it open for us , and we walked up the hill to the strider . 
  a dunmer woman was standing next to the beast . 
  as we walked closer , she looked up at us . 
  `` two people ? 
  where would you like to go ? '' she asked . 
  `` balmora , '' i replied . 
  `` two people , balmora ... let 's make it a round forty septims . 
  finally getting off on an adventure , jasmine ? '', 
  jasmine laughed . 
  `` almost . 
  we 're going to balmora so my friend here can finish some business . '', 
  the woman nodded approvingly . 
  `` well , best get moving . 
  ever ridden a strider before , bosmer ? '' she asked me . 
  `` no , '' i said . 
  `` no matter . 
  climb in , i 'll show you how . '', 
  i walked up a makeshift plank ramp into the hollow on the strider 's back . 
  i sat in the back of the hollow , where a small protrusion of the shell remained above my head . 
  jasmine climbed in and sat next to me , looking much more used to this than i. 
  as soon as she settled in , the caravaner boarded the strider , picking up the ramp after her and propping it against the side of the hollow . 
  she stood in the front of the hollow , and began pulling on fibers that seemed to come out of the back of the bug 's head . 
  the huge strider began to move at what at first seemed like a rather alarming pace . 
  looking at it 's huge size , it was easy to assume that the creature would be quite slow . 
  instead , the strider moved at least three times as fast as a walking person . 
  as the strider waded into the water outside of seyda neen , the caravaner looked back at us . 
  `` we 'll be in balmora in about three hours . 
  in the meantime , sit back and enjoy the view . '', 
  sorry i 'm late with this one . 
  [ part 10 here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtamriel/comments/1fyoma/from_the_shadow_of_the_dragon_part_10/ ), 
  the strider waded around the south side of seyda neen , and proceeded to plod west along in the shallow water near the shore . 
  from time to time , the beast would lower its two shorter limbs ( or perhaps they were mandibles ? ), 
  into the water , which it then let drip over its back . 
  it made pleasant cooing sounds whenever it did this , all the while resolutely trudging along the shoreline . 
  to our right we could see into the swamps , dark caverns in the trees , from which occasionally poured clouds of insects that beat a hasty retreat as soon as they felt the salt breeze . 
  we were close enough that overhanging branches kept the worst of the sun off . 
  far from being the alien method of travel implied by captain gravius , the ride was actually quite comfortable , far more so than a cart ride in cyrodiil . 
  the strider was extremely well balanced , and if you ignored the trees moving by at a running pace and the slight sway in the bug 's gait , it was entirely possible to forget that you were moving at all . 
  even the view from the strider got repetitive after a time , however . 
  i 've never been one to nap during the day , so i looked for something to occupy my attention . 
  i looked over at jasmine , and found her leaned up against the shell of the beast , asleep . 
  with no conversation coming from that corner , i stood up , letting my feet adjust to the swaying , and walked the two steps to take me next to the caravaner . 
  she looked sideways at me , seemingly surprised i had risen . 
  `` enjoying the ride , bosmer ? '', 
  `` yes , i am . 
  this animal is amazingly comfortable to ride . '', 
  she glanced at me again , this time with a slight look of approval in her eyes . 
  `` you ride it well , too . 
  most outlanders get nervous and tensed the whole trip . 
  you 're the first since jasmine i 've had who finds it pleasant . 
  is there something you wanted to ask me ? '', 
  i looked at her hands , manipulating the stands coming out of the beast . 
  `` there was . 
  the strider obviously follows your instructions , but i see no reins or other tack . 
  how do you control it ? '', 
  a rather proprietary looking smile came to her face , as is common when a professional explains their trade . 
  she nodded at the strands in her hand . 
  `` with these . 
  they 're muscle strands that connect to the strider 's brain . 
  when a strider is young , the shell covering this area is carved away , and the muscles attached to it are shaped into these strands . 
  from there , it 's trained to respond to signals from them , probably like a horse responds to a rein . '', 
  jasmine 's voice cut through the silence left by that statement . 
  `` it is a little , odd , i know . 
  i was n't too hungry for a while after i heard . 
  but , it does work , and they do n't seem to mind it much . '', 
  i turned to look at her . 
  `` you 're awake ? '', 
  `` i woke up . 
  i think we 're about to turn up the odai . '', 
  she was right . 
  in sight was the mouth of a small river . 
  within a minute , the strider turned left and began wading through the current . 
  as we traveled , the trees slowly faded and a smell i would become very well acquainted with reached my nose . 
  ash . 
  the terrain on either side of the river was a dull grey , the light volcanic dust held piled around large boulders and seemingly tied down in places by scraggly , spiked roots that protruded from the surface . 
  the caravaner heard my intake of breath and forestalled the question . 
  `` this is a small foyada , or `` fire river '' . 
  when red mountain at the center of the island erupts , the lava flows like water down these channels . 
  over time , if forms canyons like those on the banks . 
  the spiked plants are trama roots , used as a food or to make tea by us natives . '', 
  with that , i closed my mouth and sat back down . 
  the view soon changed once again , and the narrow banks of the river were covered in a light silvery green grass . 
  huge mushrooms , some three stories high , grew from the ground along with some dull green trees . 
  the caravaner informed us that we were half an hour from balmora . 
  at that , i closed my eyes . 
  as i slowly drifted to sleep , i was perfectly content to let the strider 's legs eat away at the remaining distance between me and an uncertain future . 
  [ part 11 here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtamriel/comments/1g6k8h/from_the_shadow_of_the_dragon_part_11/ ) . 
  a few minutes later , jasmine shook me awake . 
  `` we 're almost there , '' she said . 
  as she spoke the strider passed between a point where the high hills on either side of the bank came almost to the water 's edge , and the river bent . 
  as soon as we came around the bend , our view was clear and balmora was laid out before us . 
  balmora lay in the valley formed by the two hills , with walls on either end meeting them . 
  the whole town seemed to be made of square buildings coated in a dull tan plaster . 
  they had flat roofs with low walls on the sides . 
  in good weather , the inhabitants could use them as gardens or balconies . 
  the river cut through the middle of the town , dividing it into a richer looking west side and a poorer east . 
  at the strider port , jasmine and i disembarked and bid farewell to the caravaner . 
  after taking the stairs to ground level , i had a short moment of panic as i realized i had no idea where to go . 
  i took hold of my mind and thought furiously .
