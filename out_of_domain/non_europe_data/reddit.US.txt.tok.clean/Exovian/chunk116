  the captain had called the cornerclub the `` south wall '' , and to ask for directions from the owner . 
  well , with a name like that , it was reasonable to assume that it lay along the southern wall of the city . 
  that was where the strider port , and i , were . 
  he had also said that it was a rough establishment , which led me to assume i would need to cross the river to the east , poorer , side . 
  poverty and disreputable bars were inseparable the world over , it seemed . 
  it was a short walk to the river . 
  a bridge , made of the same material as the other buildings in town , spanned the river . 
  we crossed it quickly , and found ourselves in luck . 
  barely a block into the houses and shacks which made up the east side was a building smelling strongly of alcohol and sporting a banner which read `` south wall cornerclub '' in both imperial and dunmeri script . 
  the door was slightly ajar , and we pushed our way into the building . 
  the air inside mixed with the smoke from a dozen pipes to produce an almost unbreathable concoction . 
  managing to keep a straight face , i approached a relatively sober patron , a pale nord woman . 
  `` excuse me , do you know where i could find the owner ? '' i asked , as politely as i could manage . 
  the woman turned to regard me . 
  `` old bacola closcius ? 
  you 'll find him upstairs . '', 
  sighing with relief , i located a set of stairs near the door and climbed up . 
  trailed by wisps of smoke , i came to a small room with a door on the side and lanterns providing illumination . 
  in the corner was a middle-aged imperial man . 
  his outfit suggested a level of wealth slightly beyond that of the average patron . 
  `` excuse me , '' i said , growing to rather resent those three syllables , `` are you bacola closicus ? '', 
  `` i am '' he replied . 
  `` can i help you ? '', 
  `` yes . 
  i was told to ask you where to find a man named caius cosades . '', 
  when you leave this building , turn right until you hit the first road going north . 
  follow it all the way . 
  the house at the end of the street is his . '', 
  `` thank you '' i said . 
  then , a thought struck me . 
  `` while i 'm asking , do you know where a bookstore is in town ? '', 
  he looked thoughtfully for a moment . 
  `` go to the west side of town , and look for the fighter 's guild . 
  across the road should be one . '', 
  `` my thanks . 
  i 'll take my leave , then . '', 
  with that , i fairly ran out of the building , gulping in lungfuls of clean air . 
  jasmine caught up with me soon after , and together we walked up the street . 
  [ part 12 here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtamriel/comments/1hvd9s/from_the_shadow_of_the_dragon_part_12/ ) . 
  it is strange how a one story building in broad daylight can * loom * so ominously . 
  caius 's house , while not large by any standard , had a strong presence in the street , perhaps by virtue of its position facing down it . 
  it 's small windows , made of greenish resin-like material common in this town , offered no hint as to what was inside . 
  carefully , i walked to the house , gesturing for jasmine to stay outside . 
  i have no idea why i tried to be as quiet as possible , but i did , perhaps out of nervousness . 
  taking a last look around the sleepy street , i knocked on the door . 
  immediately , a gruff , yet quite clear , voice answered . 
  `` cosades speaking . 
  come in . '', 
  i inched the door open , and slowly slid inside . 
  the house consisted of one sparsely decorated room , with a bed , desk , and several chairs and benches . 
  there were a few shelves on the walls , and one contained a set of history books , the official published four volume brief history of the empire series . 
  the desk had a large number of letters and communications , which along with the books were marked with the stylized dragon akatosh , the empire 's universal symbol , just like the gold coins i carried in my pocket . 
  out of that same pocket , i pulled out the package . 
  caius was a well built , muscular man , especially apparent given that he had opened the door shirtless , wearing nothing but a set of pants . 
  his balding head was slightly dirty and dishevelled . 
  the fact that he seemed so confident , so unconcerned about an armed stranger in his house in this state , did nothing to calm me down . 
  `` sellus gravius told me to give you this package '' i told him . 
  he took the package from me . 
  slicing open the package with a dagger , he took the package out and began to decode it . 
  several minutes passed , with me leaning against the doorway , looking at the ceiling , the floor , anything to keep me distracted . 
  i noticed a small water pipe hastily shoved under the bed , evidence that caius partook in skooma at least somewhat regularly . 
  finally , this strange man looked up . 
  `` well , '' he said , `` it says here you 're to follow my orders and assist me with some work i 've been doing . 
  are you ready for orders ? '', 
  at those words , my knees and legs immediately decided that they were no longer on speaking terms with each other , and i barely caught myself against the door . 
  this was not at all how i wanted things . 
  i did not want to answer to the empire , much less this shirtless , part time addict . 
  i wanted freedom , i wanted my own life , and to be as far away from the underbelly of this bureaucratic beast as i could be . 
  `` no , '' i managed , reaching for the door . 
  `` i am most certainly not ! '', 
  caius looked at his dagger , then at me , apparently changing his mind . 
  `` come back when you are . '', 
  at that , i swung the door open and darted back out into the sunlight .

  the bookstore provided a wonderful , if temporary , refuge . 
  the dunmer shopkeeper looked out from behind her desk , whistling to herself . 
  light filtered through the resin windows and combined with the smell of the old paper to create absolute bliss . 
  i was in no mood to enjoy it . 
  i needed to flee . 
  i needed to find places and people where the empire could n't reach . 
  i had no idea how well connected caius was , or how much power he had , and i had no intention of finding out . 
  `` can i help you , sera ? '' the shopkeeper asked , using the standard term of respect among natives . 
  she looked at me curiously . 
  dorisa darvel had been quite friendly when i entered , and more than happy to let me browse her selection . 
  she might have some answers . 
  `` i was wondering , do you have any books about the great house telvanni ? '' i asked . 
  `` i have something that might help . 
  the affairs of wizards , written by an imperial who found employment with them . 
  if you seek the same , you may find it useful . '', 
  i eagerly took the book , and began flipping through it . 
  the first paragraph lept out at me :, 
  `` outsiders learning of the rabid isolationist and outlander-hating temperament of house telvanni wizards often assume it would be impossible to obtain positions in service to house telvanni . 
  nothing could be further from the truth . '', 
  the book went on to explain that the telvanni often hired outsiders , both for services and skills and to reduce their reliance on mercenaries from other houses . 
  the best way to find employment was to visit their council house in the city of sadrith mora , far in the east . 
  this was exactly what i needed . 
  a place to escape the empire , find my feet in this land , and maybe even make some friends along the way . 
  for the first time since i had first been thrown in the imperial city prisons months ago , there was finally a solid path to lead me to freedom . 
  i walked to the counter with a huge smile on my face .
