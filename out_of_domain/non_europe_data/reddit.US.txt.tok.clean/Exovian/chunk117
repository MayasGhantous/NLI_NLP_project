  i thanked the shopkeeper , and paid her for the book . 
  i turned to jasmine , who was smiling uncertainly at me . 
  it occurred to me again just how attractive she was . 
  `` where to now ? '' she asked . 
  `` we 're going east , to sadrith mora '' i told her . 
  `` i think it 's time to meet the telvanni . '', 
  i just launched two small manned rockets , with a one-person capsule , rtg , a thrust-vectoring engine , and each with a large or small asas . 
  the asas functionality did little to keep the rocket pointed in one direction . 
  on launch , the rocket veered off-course before correcting , and the whole time , the heading slowly drifted lower toward the horizon . 
  on planes , however , the new asas features ( at least on the 1.25 m version ) work exactly as stated .

  for this mission , i used a very small plane , creatively named `` flyer 1 '' . 
  takeoff speed was roughly 90m/s due to the angle of the plane , though i usually flew around 60 . 
  i landed on the island airfield , planted a flag , and returned safely to ksc . 
  handling is mostly excellent on the vertical axis , though the lack of major horizontal control surfaces means that a yaw changes the direction of flight and not the orientation of the plane itself ( the plane will happily slide diagonally in the air ) . 
  while this caused some trouble landing , the low speed kept it manageable .

  this mission launched an extremely simple satellite , venturer 1 , into a fairly eccentric ( 71 x 140 km ) orbit around kerbin . 
  the rocket consisted of two stages and 13 parts , with the satellite itself having three parts . 
  the upper stage was fitted with reverse-facing sepratrons , allowing for a deorbit to prevent orbital clutter .

  to be perfectly clear , i 'm talking about the one you can loot from the star map room , before fighting uthar and/or yuthura . 
  for some reason or another , that particular saber ca n't be modified at the workbench . 
  is there a mod to change that ? 
  if not , how feasible would it be to go into the data files and do it myself ? 
  hello !, 
  i 'm something of a returning player . 
  i have n't played this game in over 1.5 years , mostly playing morrowind in that time , but i 've decided to come back and try to mod away most of the gripes i had . 
  i have the goty edition , and have plenty of experience installing mods , mostly on morrowind , but some here . 
  the types of mods i 'd like :, 
  any `` essential '' mods . 
  i know of the unofficial patches , but not many others . 
  something to make all locks capable of being picked . 
  i hated so many being arbitrarily assigned a necessary key . 
  i 'll break my game if i want , beth . 
  something to remove the level scaling system and make enemies more static . 
  also , something to fix the broken leveling system . 
  i hating leveling up as a thief and running from minotaur lords * all the time . 
  lore friendly content additions . 
  something in the shivering isles would be nice , particularly something that expanded the court of madness and your role in it . 
  also things in other planes of oblivion and nirn itself . 
  anything else you think might fit . 
  i 'm sorry if it 's a long list , but i hope you all will be able to help .

  the circumnavigator flew very well with jeb at the controls . 
  most cruising was done at 23-25 km , and at around 1500 m/s . 
  i did push the plane to 26 km , and 1750 + m/s for short periods of time , however , this is not recommended ( however fun ) . 
  the craft also handled remarkably well , remaining aloft and controllable at under 50 m/s if needed . 
  this helped a lot while landing on the far side . 
  fuel was not an issue , and in fact , the aircraft landed having only touched the last third of its fuel during final approach to the runway . 
  if at any point the program needs a long distance exploration or small transport aircraft , modifying the circumnavigator for such missions would possibly be a viable option .

  obviously , short term , a lot of people ( most of use ) are boned . 
  what are some possible silver linings ? 
  by shaking up the world financial system , could any good result ?

  ludbart , neildous , and dunton piloted the macbas i on a munar orbit mission to scout potential landing sites . 
  on the way , they also released a mini-satellite with a gravity sensor and an accelerometer before descending to under 10,000 meters to make observations . 
  the areas surveyed ran the gamut from craters to mountains and plains . 
  later , i made a gamble on the remaining fuel reserves and did a plane-change to put the craft into a polar orbit and made similar observations of terrain around the polar regions , which gets very , very interesting . 
  not easy at all , but perhaps worthwhile . 
  anyway , i hope this is useful to anyone planning missions . 
  a note : two easter eggs were found , but are linked separately in image descriptions , so anyone wishing to avoid them can look at this album ( but not the links ! ), 
  without fear .

  this sprung out of a conversation between / u / / dartman5000 and myself , and it was decided to open it up here for you to weigh in on . 
  so far , many players have opted to keep their ships `` where they fall '' or land , etc , upon completion of the flight . 
  while i understand the need for mementos , this has resulted in `` 3 craft currently landed at ksc , all within physics range of both the pad and runway ( including one plane on the side of the runway itself ) . 
  that 's 72 parts plus a kerbal just eating processor power during launch , not to mention all the remnants in orbits or landed , cluttering the map view . '', 
  as i understand it , the idea behind leaving ships behind was to allow players to see the mark they leave on the save , and in principle , that 's fine . 
  however , i think it 's becoming a problem . 
  that said , here are some alternative ideas :, 
  limit any leftover vessels/parts to that which is absolutely needed ( stations , satellites , bases , etc. ), 
  personally , i think that 's a bit too strict . 
  allow any flight that does not leave a permanent mark to plant a flag upon completion . 
  this means that a mission to add a module for a station , for instance , should not leave debris or derelict hardware , as it has a station module up . 
  on the other hand , a crew transfer mission , having no visible permanent effect , gets to plant a flag upon landing . 
  any manned flight gets a flag planting when landed . 
  * in both cases , any remaining hardware would be recovered via mission control , in space or not . 
  probes designed to escape into solar orbit , like the current eve and duna probes , would be completely exempt , as being permanent is by their design . 
  thoughts ? 
  have your own ideas ? 
  ** day started : ** day 134, 
  ongoing . 
  the flight was fairly straightforward ; i waited a bit for an eve alignment , and then launched the probe on it 's way . 
  no complications to note . 
  eva 1 is a small probe with all 6 data gathering parts and 2 transmitters , landed by parachute . 
  the launch vehicle was a simple r-7 style cluster ( you can find it in the subassembly listing if you want ) and two booster stages . 
  the third stage was entirely unneeded , and was dropped once in the eve soi . 
  ** note to the mods : ** the . zip file contains two folders , `` rsp-m16 '' and `` rsp-m16 - test '' . 
  the `` test '' is a copy of the base save file that i converted to career mode and edited in science to unlock all of the parts . 
  the advantage of this is that when someone collects data from a science part , they can actually look at results ( `` the goo has frozen solid '' vs `` you do n't feel like you 're learning anything '' ) . 
  i think this change would make that aspect far more interesting , even in what is basically a sandbox .
