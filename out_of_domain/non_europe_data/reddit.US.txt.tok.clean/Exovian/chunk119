  that said , the common teaching in the us today ( at least the i 've gone through ) is that there was no way the us would take the atack lying down , that we had to respond and crush the japanese empire . 
  if the japanese wanted something different to come out of it , what was it and what made them think it would happen ? 
  the first launch sent a 16 part , 7 kerbal capacity habitation module up to the station . 
  the launch went well , with all excess parts sent falling back to kerbin . 
  the module has lights to aid incoming transport craft . 
  it will be noted that all reaction wheels outside the core module have been disabled , including those on the resident return vehicle . 
  this is to prevent the station from becoming lko 's biggest bounce house . 
  a crew was sent up to the station , containing donner kerman , thought dead on minmus !, 
  he 's positively thrilled to be back up in space . 
  the ship , a stripped-down version of the macbas that sent the mun survey team up , is docked to the forward port of the hab module . 
  the next raft of flights should probably include a much larger set of panels , though our current set may last for a while . 
  all future pilots should remember to limit reaction wheel use .

  this consisted of 3 launches : a `` core '' base module , a crew , and a science module . 
  i found a marvelous landing site in a spectacular crater . 
  most of the mission details can be seen in the album . 
  now , on to the the issues , and a note to future pilots :, 
  the crew needs a return vehicle , seeing as i crashed the ship that brought them there . 
  a power module would be nice , but there is 4000 + power , a solar panel , and 2 rtgs as it is . 
  pilots : turn off power to the rear wheels of the base parts while driving . 
  this makes them much less likely to flip .

  as most of you will know , aureals ( golden saints ) and mazken ( dark seducers ) are the guards and enforcers of sheogorath 's shivering isles . 
  like the land itself , they are markedly divided in appearance and temperament , and bear a deep-seated hatred of one another . 
  looking closely , however , the division is not so clear or total , and may even suggest a common origin . 
  the easiest feature to note is in the armor each race wears . 
  [ each ] ( http://www.uesp.net/wiki/file:si-npc-female_golden_saint.jpg ) [ set ] ( http://www.uesp.net/wiki/file:si-npc-dark_seducer_summon.jpg ) possesses an amulet , which is purple for the aureals and gold for the mazken . 
  the officer classes also have decorations on their helmets ( [ here ] ( http://www.uesp.net/wiki/file:si-npc-golden_saint_wilderness_guards.jpg ) and [ here ] ( http://www.uesp.net/wiki/file:si-npc-dark_seducer_royal_guard.jpg ) ) in the same colors . 
  also of note is the armor type itself . 
  aureals , the guards of mania ( often thought of as more wild and uninhibited ) are clad in heavier armor than the mazken , guards of dementia , who wear light armor in spite of their seemingly more oppressive surroundings . 
  ( going into a slight tangent here , this would make an interesting observation about amber and madness armor , as `` purer '' and less balanced expressions of their `` side '' , but that goes beyond the scope of this discussion . ), 
  their behavior matches this , with the aureals being somewhat more rigid and elitist than the mazken . 
  the end result of this is that we can see that neither the aureals or mazken are not in any way `` perfect '' projections of mania or dementia , and indeed , seem to go to some length to maintain a sort of balance within their respective races , just as is found in the isles as a whole . 
  veering firmly into the realm of conjecture , i would propose that these two races are not , in fact , two races at all , but instead a single species of daedra that was divided upon entering the servitude of sheogorath . 
  they continue to maintain a sort of internal balance , even as they are now very divided . 
  thoughts ? 
  if it matters , the plane i was flying was a bf 109 e-1 . 
  i just got to rank 5 in the german air force , and i am loving this plane . 
  anyway , i got into a turnfight with an american , and wound up horribly mauled and limping back to base after a friend chased off my attacker . 
  i was barely able to exercise any sort of control , as one wing was black and the rest of the plane was in the red . 
  managed to level out going into the runway , and the landing gear wo n't descend . 
  i belly flopped onto the runway , ripped off a wing , bent the prop blades , the works . 
  my opponent was credited with a kill , i was listed as crashing was presented with the message that i would leave the plane in x seconds . 
  i held `` j '' for a second until i saw that it was also showing that i would be repaired and rearmed in a little over a minute . 
  after i released the `` j '' key , the bail countdown stopped and i sat on the runway in my unambiguously totaled fighter . 
  just as it said , i soon spawned on the runway again , fully repaired and rearmed . 
  i had no backup planes , nothing at all that should have let me get back up after crashing . 
  any idea what happened ? 
  ** start date ** : year 12 , day 204, 
  ** end date : ** ongoing, 
  after a * highly * persistent crew was forced from the core at wrench-point , said core , consisting of a mk1-2 pod , 4 standard ports , and 1 each jr. and sr. ports , as well as 3 small solar arrays , was sent on it 's way to minmus , and placed in a roughly equatorial 10km circular orbit . 
  the 3rd stage of the booster was deorbited 2.5 km from the minmus base , currently manned by neildous kerman . 
  neildous flew over to inspect the crash site , finding an rtg that survived the fall , before returning to base . 
  at this point , i took some liberties with the mission plan , and when the station came back around , neildous took off on his jetpack to catch it . 
  in less than 40 minutes , he was safely inside , refueled his jetpack , tested the lights , and ate up some snacks . 
  he was able to deorbit before the station passed over the base again , and landed neatly back on top of the base . 
  ** instructions for future pilots : **, 
  on the front port of the core is a small probe body with fuel and an engine . 
  that probe is currently providing control for the station . 
  when a crew is sent up , decouple and deorbit it . 
  since it is a low orbit , periodically make sure it does n't intersect the ground . 
  i ca n't imagine that it will , but be safe . 
  please avoid adding reaction wheels for the time being . 
  ** observations and suggestions : **, 
  - it is possible to get to and from low minmus orbit via jetpack , which may save us the trouble of bringing a lander on future missions . 
  orbiting and getting an intercept does take more fuel than getting down , however , so i recommend that small rescue craft be added to aid kerbals stranded in an undesirable orbit . 
  all future pilots should prioritize orbiting over getting to the station . 
  - because of this ability , docking a small ion powered orbital bike would let us deploy kerbals anywhere on minmus 's surface . 
  looking into this would be nice . 
  - the above observations can apply to other , similarly small bodies .

  this was a very interesting mission , in that it was both my first flight to the duna system and my first crewed interplanetary landing ever . 
  thanks rsp !, 
  ( jaw-dropping apparatus for wasteland adventure ) is a 4-wheeled , two-story base , designed for four kerbals . 
  it technically has room for seven plus five seats on the outside . 
  it also has a docking port facing up from the right side that a skycrane can deliver science parts to in the future . 
  managed to claw it 's way into kerbin orbit , though it does not take well to atmospheric flight at all . 
  everything was going great , the duna intercept was planned ... and then i realized that i had forgotten to load the other three crew members . 
  donner , dunton , and kenhat raced into space and managed to intercept j.a.w.a. 
  on their initial arc up , which led to a mad burn to match velocities before the three latecomers fell back to kerbin . 
  at this point , the j.a.w.a. 
  was fast approaching the departure node for duna , so i had to race the kerbals onto external seats and let them hang on for dear life while the burn took place . 
  that went well , however , the j.a.w.a. 
  only had enough fuel to land via a direct aerocapture and braking . 
  fortunately , i got lucky and came in over some lowlands . 
  the nervas provided enough thrust to make the chute opening very gentle . 
  however , i had to drop the engines to land , and fell fast enough to pop 3 wheels on impact . 
  nothing else was broken . 
  wheels were fixed , flag was raised ... and dunton accelerated too fast in a jetpack and took out three of the eight xl solar arrays . 
  fortunately , the base still draws plenty of power and has three huge batteries , so all is well . 
  note : i have disabled power on the back wheels , because , like every back wheelset in ksp , they think they 're too cool for front wheels and flip the base when powered . 
  only use them to get up a hill if you must . 
  steering on the base is not great , and is nonexistent at over 5m/s .

  so , i 'm on the yacht with visas and mira to fetch my main character . 
  everything is going fine , until i try to open the door to the audience chamber .
