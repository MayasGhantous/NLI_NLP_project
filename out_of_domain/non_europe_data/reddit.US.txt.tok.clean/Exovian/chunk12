  mind if i use this in a mod ? 
  will do . 
  it may be a while though , due to finals . 
  i * almost * regret stealing your hide . 
  almost . 
  it 's an awkward moment . 
  nice . 
  thank * you * for the update !, 
  relevant username ? 
  funny , i do n't recall * that * in the inferno ... 
  so griefers get immersed in boiling blood and fire ? 
  i 'm cool with that . 
  sanitation . 
  ** when did you get into tes ? 
  got morrowind from a friend of my brothers . 
  got it for pc shortly after to play the expansions and mod . 
  ** when did you get into the lore of tes ? 
  the lore was morrowind 's big hook for me, 
  what was your first tes game ? 
  morrowind . 
  ** which tes games have you played ? 
  ** which tes game/s caused you to become interested in the lore ? 
  ** morrowind , to a lesser degree skyrim . 
  ** what is your favorite race ? 
  ** bosmer , my go-to character for ** morrowind ** . 
  this . 
  you . 
  i like you . 
  what itches said . 
  i 'll try this tomorrow ; thanks . 
  probably because the higher gravity leaves less room for error . 
  nice lander you have there . 
  any pics of the launch vehicle ? 
  i 'll bet your dad had fun giving him the news . 
  `` i heard them say we 've reached morrowind . 
  i 'm sure they 'll let us go . '', 
  still sends chills down my spine . 
  more pretty : morrowind . 
  even without mods , it beats oblivion . 
  i know . 
  it 's ridiculous being able to land on * rcs * . 
  yes . 
  [ i beat you to it !,

  i have this exact problem . 
  reinstalling the sky mod did n't help , so i do n't know . 
  at any rate , thanks for the answer , and sorry about the downvotes . 
  it 's saying i do n't have access . 
  there was a game online a while back called starfighter : disputed galaxy . 
  i was making an alien character , and wanted an alien name , so i started with the prefix `` exo - '' . 
  i also wanted the name to flow smoothly , so i ended it with `` ian '' . 
  `` v '' was the best sounding consonant in the middle , and here i am . 
  now , i use this name everywhere . 
  `` call of magic '' - jeremy soule . 
  morrowind theme tune , and i 'm flooded with wonder every time i hear it . 
  til 1 metric fuckton = 123.52 metric tonnes, 
  awesome . 
  not something i did , but was done by an acquaintance of mine :, 
  his sister was going out with this incredibly rude guy who would take every possible chance to be a jerk . 
  my friend waited until he left his car unattended one day and slipped a ping-pong ball into his gas tank . 
  after several miles of driving , the ball go sucked into the fuel pump , stopping the engine . 
  with the engine stopped , it floated out again . 
  well , this was a long time ago . 
  cars may have been different back then . 
  this story is far from modern . 
  old car . 
  making the d20 face 1 before rolling greatly increases the chance of rolling  15 . 
  two things :, 
  you do n't need our permission . 
  while this is a nice concept , the new sub would not get the exposure that r/morrowind does , making it harder to get help . 
  lucky bastard . 
  get [ this ] ( http://planetelderscrolls.gamespy.com/view.php?view=mods.detail&amp;id=5730 ) . 
  it helps a lot . 
  edit : i have one made up , but mediafire 's having issues . 
  give it a bit .

  happy to help !, 
  well , think . 
  suppose i was insanely pro-obama . 
  by assassinating members of the supreme court , i would allow him to appoint their successors , thus extending his judicial legacy . 
  this will be the game i give my grandkids , i just know it . 
   stable [ ... ] md-80 . 
  you just broke reality . 
  i suppose you know of / r/teslore then ? 
  probably by retexturing ice ... 
  blue, 
  pickaxe, 
  who ? 
  memory sticks, 
  rpg, 
  yellow, 
  never watched either, 
  see above, 
  we , the jury , find the accused guilty of having way too much time . 
  nice job !, 
  fixed . 
  also try a cloak of elvenkind . 
  those things are * nice * . 
  you eat moon sugar , or use it as a flavoring .
