  at that point , i get a ctd . 
  i have tslrcm and m4-78 installed . 
  it 's been a great year with you all !, 
  i thought we could use this thread as a general discussion of the year , and how it went for morrowind and the community . 
  what were the best new mods / mod releases ? 
  any of you have personal projects you want to talk about ? 
  this was actually a fairly simple mission . 
  i slightly edited the stock rover and skycrane to have a parachute , rtg , and two seats , one on each end . 
  the trip to duna was uneventful save for a perfect alignment of the orbital planes , and the fact that i had perhaps 3 times the fuel i needed in the nuclear stage . 
  from that intercept , i brought the rover directly down close to the base . 
  unfortunately , the rover landed on its side , and was only righted after flying a kerbal into it repeatedly triggered a physics bug ( captured , later to be returned to arthropodologists on kerbin ) to send the rover spiraling up to land on its end , from which it was easily righted .

  interesting mission , much harder than i anticipated . 
  a huge booster was used to launch the transfer stage , which itself had two poodle engines to finish the orbital burn . 
  then the ~ ~ hellish waiting ~ ~ fun started . 
  between escaping kerbin , course corrections , and moho insertion , i spent 30-45 minutes nervously glancing at the fuel gauge as the four nervas slowly ate up the fuel in the drop tanks and then the center stage . 
  as overbuilt as the transfer stage looks , it actually barely caught itself in moho 's soi . 
  polar orbit was then established . 
  fairly quickly , i decided to land at moho 's north pole , near one of the curiously massive holes . 
  unfortunately , to slow down in time , i had to jettison the lander 's side tanks , which prevented major relocation . 
  eventually , i nudged the lander to the very edge of the northern pit .

  i played warband with the diplomacy mod , and i really liked the changes it made , especially being able to marry claimants . 
  i know it got folded into floris , which many people say is good . 
  what other changes does floris make and how do you feel it compares ? 
  well , this was a nutty mission . 
  the launch vehicle seemed to live in some twilight zone of crazy acceleration , to the point where it felt so good as to be almost wrong . 
  that stopped when the launch stages were decoupled , and nervas went back to being their same old slow selves . 
  the refueling port that i did n't wind up using was jettisoned , and off to jool we went . 
  i lined up a direct laythe intercept early , wiggling the orbit to an equatorial path within 25km of the surface while still inside the orbit of duna ( not to toot my own horn , but i 'm getting inordinately proud of my intercepts ) . 
  several months later , and after further refining the trajectory to pass with 17km of the surface , the boys flew past laythe like screaming , plasma-coated banshees to a very nice orbit . 
  first order of business was to separate the components of the vessel : the pol probes were decoupled to be sent off when the orbits aligned , and a small external science module ( used as ballast to balance the lander ) was powered up , read , and discarded after science had been retrieved . 
  at this point , the lander was released and the crew flew over . 
  it was targeted for a landing near the old chimera probe . 
  after landing , the flag was raised , samples were taken , and a walk was made 3.7 kilometers to chimera . 
  liftoff was a simple affair , with the landing legs being jettisoned after the craft was airborne . 
  the lander itself is an ssto with a rapier engine , capable of equatorial orbit from either kerbin or laythe , but with very tight fuel margins , even in its current minimalist design . 
  after the crew was back to the main ship , the pol probes were sent on their merry way . 
  after elliptical orbit around pol was established , the satellite was released , and the lander landed . 
  science was done , transmitted , etc. 
  following this , a kerbin return burn was completed . 
  from here on out it was fairly standard : fly back toward the sun , strap in , hit kerbin 's atmosphere at 10 + km/s , pop chutes . 
  all crew returned safely .

  by that , i mean places where you have weapons confiscated , mostly casinos and the fort . 
  all you do is repeatedly mash the inventory key during the loading screen to the area . 
  if you do it correctly , your spamming will bring up your inventory before the dialogue opens to confiscate your weapons . 
  simply drop any weapons you want ( maybe ammo as well ) and then close the pip-boy . 
  you will go through the dialogue as usual , and can then pick up the weapons you dropped . 
  ** mission start : ** year 26 day 273, 
  ** ongoing **, 
  this mission had 3 launches : the main fuel pod + crew quarters ( cobbled together after lanlan paid a hefty bribe to have the word `` finesse '' temporarily struck from the dictionary ) , the transfer pod that would take it to laythe , and the trip up for the second crew member , shepner . 
  all launches went fine * and the `` brotoro '' was assembled in orbit , and after a transfer window opened , was sent lethargically coasting towards jool . 
  on the way , the booster had to draw some of the station 's fuel , though not too much . 
  it still is over 2/3 full . 
  a very low swing around jool sent the craft to a comparatively slow direct laythe capture . 
  orbit was circularized at 60km ; however , it is not perfectly equatorial , but it should be close enough for nearly anything . 
  the station has 1 sr. port , 2 jr. ports , and 3 standard ports . 
  it also has lights that illuminate the side of the station , so that a ship approaching any of the ports should have a lit surface to reference . 
  given the possibility of expansions and its already substantial crew capacity of 5 , it could well be used as a command center for future colonies . 
  [ save ] ( https://www.mediafire.com/?18juq8eb22lldrj ), 
  * as a note , the brotoro was named after the poster of [ this ] ( http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/27552-long-term-laythe-mission-%28pic-heavy%29-***-with-part-26-*** ) forum tale about another set of laythe missions . 
  you should really go read it . 
  first off , thank you all who tuned in to the livestream . 
  i 'm sorry technical reasons meant i had to cut it short ; i wish i could make it more often . 
  this mission was not one of my better ones . 
  the spacecraft consisted of a capsule and hitchhiker , 3 crew , and 4 robotic aircraft capable of deorbiting and dropping markers at interesting place . 
  all of this was sent off by a large nuclear booster stage . 
  this arrangement worked very well . 
  i did force a course correction rather later than i should have ( in the laythe soi itself ) , and this probably caused the fuel shortage later on . 
  once the main ship was in more or less polar orbit , the drones were sent one by one to various areas of laythe . 
  i tried to get a variety of areas , generally looking for flat locations suitable for both bases and runways , when the colony is developed . 
  see the album for plenty of imagery . 
  the drones themselves had many serious problems , that had not shown themselves while testing on kerbin . 
  the spacing of the control surfaces meant that in 4 flights , there were * 14 * flat spins or instances of total control loss . 
  craft with the markers still in place could not be flown higher than about 6km without the extra mass below the wings becoming too much for the controls to compensate for . 
  most seriously , having a different number of markers on each wing would result in the craft having enough drag to fly diagonally . 
  range , however , was great . 
  then , there is the issue with the crew : i do n't think they have enough fuel to get back or plane-shift to the brotoro . 
  rescue will come with the colony itself in m69 . 
  while the flights were less than half of what had been planned , they still provided some useful data and observations :, 
  * laythe is far less forgiving than kerbin with regards to aircraft stability . 
  perfect alignment of com and col on the vertical and horizontal axes . 
  * aerobraking is going to be very imprecise . 
  larger bases or towns should be on large , flat areas , and either have plenty of fuel to correct the descent , or be deployed outright by aircraft to allow precise placement . 
  * we will need a lot of jet fuel to sustain a colony . 
  for safety , each base should probably have its own tanker . 
  the docking mechanism and height of tankers , at least , should probably be decided on by m72 . 
  * we should probably have several transport aircraft , ideally including a seaplane , should someone land in the drink or away from the base . 
  all in all , not the best 15th mission i could have hoped for , but 16 is a nicer number anyway .

  i am working on getting a map of laythe with location names and probe locations up soon . 
  ** start date : ** year 28 , day 363, 
  sorry about the lateness , turns out weekday missions are a bad idea ^ tm for me . 
  lleswer was launched toward jool with one of the boosters designed for the drone mission . 
  it turns out that more fuel than that should be taken . 
  the first attempt at landing resulted in a vertical plunge through laythe 's atmosphere at ~ 8km/s . 
  the last ~ 1000m/s were shed in a technology-dirt interface performed in a manner unanticipated by the design team .
