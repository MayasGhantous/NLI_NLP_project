  [ save ] ( http://www.mediafire.com/download/ukkf3vfkukka16d/rsp-m99-100%283%29.zip ), 
  i 've made plenty of wooden bins , and set the stone stockpile to have 60 max bins . 
  there 's one bin in the pile , plenty of stone lying around , and the dwarves wo n't move it into bins . 
  just that . 
  it means my character can only socialize autonomously , and i ca n't click on bigfoot to invite him over . 
  he usually starts outside when i show up , then immediately goes in and does n't come out . 
  i do n't want to have feudal dukes , because of the government type penalty . 
  will the vassal republics act as normal with trade posts/patricians ? 
  bit late today , my apologies . 
  long story short , i 'm playing an ironman game starting as svi\u00fejod and trying to make a great pagan empire , eventually reforming and giving a kingdom to all of the pagan religions ( though with my norse power base obviously remaining a majority ) . 
  hellenic is obviously impossible , but it seems the demon spawn chain spawns 3 witches of the generic pagan religion . 
  my plan was to assassinate the demon child after they spawn and get them into my court , then giving them land . 
  on the other hand , if the ai ca n't get the event , i 'll need to start as catholic and go through a bunch of conversion messiness , which is doable . 
  i just bought the game + the first 3 main dlc . 
  everything installed fine , but anytime i try to bring up the game , it crashes and says `` europa universalis iv has stopped working '' . 
  i 've already tried validating the game cache , and i 've checked my documents folder , as some have said to delete the settings file from there . 
  no settings file ever existed there , and no other files exist in the euiv folder aside from the dlc_signature and the logs and standalone folders . 
  i 'm going for my usual ironman playthrough as sigurdr , going from svi\u00fejod -  reform faith -  form kingdom of fylkirate . 
  i 'd like to be able to make the empire of the fylkirate instead of scandinavia , but i need to gather 8000 prestige . 
  ideas ? 
  requirements : non-germanic male courtier , free counties . 
  simply give out a country to a non-germanic courtier , grant independence , declare county conquest war . 
  then give out the county again , rinse , and repeat . 
  well , i goofed for posting last week . 
  whoops ... 
  late again ...

  i realize that this is probably a fairly complex question , but this seems like the best sub to pigeonhole it into . 
  at any rate , does that statement have any merit ? 
  at varying points in time ( say , 50 , 100 , 200 years ago ) what would be the experiences in the east and west moving to a different country ( or area with a different ethnic or linguistic makeup , if that 's more helpful ) ? 
  how would the native populations of different areas react ?

  given that this sub is n't enforcing 20-year rules , i 'll add : are there _ currently _ noticeable differences in how people from different parts of the world react after immigrating to a new country , or how different nations react to immigrants ? 
  my knowledge of the subject is a bit fuzzy , but to be specific , i 'm mainly curious about the time of the [ byzantine iconoclasms ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/byzantine_iconoclasm ) . 
  did muslims see ties between the rules against depictions of their prophet and iconoclast beliefs ? 
  just that . 
  if any show up here , send us a modmail as well as reporting . 
  it makes it much faster for us . 
  playing germanic , trying to get the slavs to reform . 
  i know if a vassal king reforms it , they get the high priest as a vassal . 
  wiki says `` the other pagan faiths have a duke-level religious leader who becomes a vassal of the reforming ruler '' . 
  if i 'm the liege of the reformer , mean they 're my vassal ? 
  the cdu sees the offer as an opportunity to win the votes of the heimatvertriebene ( those germans who had been displaced after wwii ) as well as a chance to reduce soviet power in europe by removing their ice-free port on the baltic coast . 
  yes , i know it 's uptiered to hell , but i got this game to fly it , and fly it i will . 
  however screwy the mm is , what 's the best way to get kills in it ? 
  to achieve this , drag along the screen while holding the left mouse button with the jetback enabled . 
  this can rotate the kerbal into an upside down position . 
  as long as the helmet strikes the ground first , they walk away just fine . 
  i have not tested on water yet . 
  i was watching a subtitled episode of * die deutschen * on youtube , and on an expanded map of europe , austria was labeled `` kaisertum \u00d6sterreich '' , which i have only seen translated as `` austrian empire '' , when all other empires i can find have had the word translated as `` kaiserreich '' . 
  i know `` reich '' is `` realm '' in english , thus words like `` k\u00f6nigreich '' and `` kaiserreich '' ( realms of kings/emperors ) . 
  and with '' \u00d6sterreich '' being , as far as i can tell , `` eastern realm '' , i can see how `` kaiserreich \u00d6sterreich '' would be a bit redundant . 
  but what the heck does `` kaisertum '' mean ? 
  the only time i 've seen the '' - tum '' aside from this is in `` f\u00fcrstentum '' ( principality ) and `` herzogtum '' ( duchy ) . 
  edit : to be clear , i 'm asking about the specific meanings of kaisertum vs kaiserreich , not the history behind their adoptions . 
  and more than 6-7 is rare . 
  the business is rank 10 , with positive reviews . 
  it 's a venue , with four poker tables which usually suck up all the customers , 2 pool tables , a hot tub , and arcade machines . 
  the price is average , so it sells itself , but i have no idea how to get more people to show up . 
  ok , i have my business up and running , rank 10 , plenty of visitors , etc. 
  if i supervise it for a full 24 hour period , it brings in ~ \u00a7 35,000 . 
  i hired a manager to run that place , left , checked in , etc. 
  first day out , it brings in under 1000 . 
  anyone know why ? 
  also , [ tech help thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/morrowind/comments/33vsav/426_52_tech_help_thread/ ) , as it 's currently not stickied . 
  first off , i 'm deeply sorry to all of you who 've been modmailing us about quality lately ; we dropped the ball pretty hard . 
  for those of you who have n't ... 
  lately , / r/morrowind has become cluttered with low-effort posts , memes , stl-style shitposting , and at least one post that bordered on brigading from / r/truestl . 
  we 've messaged their moderators , and [ we are on the same page ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/truestl/comments/33vh9x/mod_post_psa_truestl_is_leaking_again_reminder_to/ ) . 
  we will be removing posts that do not show some effort or relevance to the sub , and be drafting a far more readable set of rules in the coming days . 
  additionally , while we 've not so far had a huge problem , i will take this opportunity to point out that brigading is a violation of reddit 's rules , and will be met with ~ ~ ebony maces ~ ~ bans ( and if it 's from / r/truestl , action there too ) . 
  we have nothing against truestl , and are happy that folks keep enjoying themselves , but that type of content belongs over there , just like our content belongs here . 
  if you report a post to us , please send us a modmail ; those get checked a lot faster . 
  likewise , if you feel a post has been unfairly removed , tell us . 
  this is by necessity going to be fairly subjective , and we 're happy to talk to you about it . 
  finally , thank you to all of you still coming and participating here . 
  we 're nothing without you . 
  i mainly play german aircraft in rb . 
  i already spaded and got a skin for the 262 , so i do n't really need a grinding aircraft for germany , and for my other main country , the ussr , i have the p-63 a-10 premium event plane . 
  should i just buy a year of premium , or go for more premium aircraft in other nations ? 
  i 'm playing as the norse , germanic empire of the fylkirate , and given 300 years , have managed to expand rather easily across most of europe and north africa . 
  problem is , so have my vassals , and even my vassals ' vassals . 
  i like having my subdivisions nice and neat , and having some frisian jarl holding a quarter of egypt , for example , is driving my nuts . 
  what 's the best way to go `` ordnung muss sein ! '', 
  on this mess and get everything back to it 's proper borders ? 
  i suppose 1000 years is a lot to ask about , so let 's say 1600 and onwards ( yes , i know this includes the peace of westphalia , which is a big deal ) . 
  [ this map ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/peace_of_westphalia#/media/file:europe_map_1648.png ) sort of illustrates what 's confusing to me . 
  there 's the hre , the boundaries of which seem to be separate from the national borders at times . 
  some spanish territories are in , some out , ditto for the crown of bohemia . 
  - what do those borders mean ? 
  what did it mean to be a part of the hre ? 
  - how was the hre governed and divided , and did the parts even consider themselves united ? 
  were they ? 
  - if i 'm in the spanish netherlands , on that map , for instance , who is `` in charge '' , the leader of spain , or the emperor ? 
  pretty much that . 
  i 've looked it up , and found [ some ] ( http://lyrics.wikia.com/liederjan:o_k%c3%b6nig_von_preu%c3%9fen ) [ results ] ( http://www.liederseiten.de/lied.php?i=33&s=1 ) , but there are numerous inconsistencies among them . 
  admittedly , my grasp of german is terrible , so i may have missed something .
