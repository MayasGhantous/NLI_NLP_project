  skooma is a liquid and is either drunk or smoked in a [ skooma pipe ] ( http://images.wikia.com/elderscrolls/images/c/ce/skoomapipe_mw.png ) . 
  did something illegal . 
  in japan . 
  call of magic ( aka nerevar rising ), 
  walking out of red mountain , with the hulk of akulakhan crumbling into ruin behind me , breathing clean air over a newly free vvardenfell . 
  morrowind , how i love you . 
  / r/morrowind, 
  come play with us . 
  forever and ever and _ ever _ . 
  any idea of a sacred east eta ? 
  best of luck !, 
  we ... try to forget about that . 
  as far as i know , the problem with attacking ghasts is that the mob ca n't path to it to deliver damage ( because the ghasts fly ) . 
  i want these pictures . 
  not necessarily . 
  ebony in real life is dark wood , not so in tes . 
  no reason red mountain could n't spit malachite . 
  same . 
  joining the knights now . 
  i 'm thinking of trying daggerfall this summer . 
  how would you describe it ? 
  any tips ? 
  ... whatever works for you ... just do n't get anywhere near my ahnassi . 
  not in my save file !, 
  where exactly should the line be drawn between advice that is okay to ask for here , and that which should be sought from a professional ( i.e. 
  that we should report ) ? 
  thanks for clarifying !, 
  rather than a mod , i enchant a ring with drain intelligence 100 points for 1 second . 
  it resets your magicka completely . 
  i use it with my atronach birthsign character , and call it `` ring of womb-balm '' . 
  first of all , * great * mod idea . 
  as for what should have dialogue : daedroth , golden saints , winged twilights , and scamps should have dialogue . 
  in fairness , he is pretty tall . 
  morrowind . 
  insecure souls who feel that by downvoting the question , they can deny needing to know the answer . 
  it 's my understanding that daedra * hate * being bound to anything , so i do n't think it would matter . 
  you wash your mouth out with soap . 
  it does not . 
  it 's worth it though . 
  this kills the penis . 
  any chance you can get us the seed ? 
  may i have your babies ? 
  um ... there is no recall on target spell ... 
  [ welcome to r/nocontext !, 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/nocontext/comments/uqxp9/the_blood_lubricated_the_copulation/ ), 
  do n't know where else to report this :, 
  whenever i attempt to go into the vaults in port telvannis , under the parliament of bugs , the game shoots up errors stating that it ca n't find a mesh or movement file for the vermai , which cause it to crash . 
  fresh install , this is the only place i have encountered this problem . 
  is that what the unopenable door below the fane of the ancestors is for ? 
  master thief is saddened by this ... 
  yeah , it 's the challenge that 's the best part . 
  half the fun of sneaking into the presence of the sacred and the profane is basking in the glory of * `` because i can '' * . 
  after all these years , still the biggest thrill in the game . 
  can we have a piece of debris do the crash to avoid killing our kerbals ? 
  any project that you enjoy working on and have a vision for is worth continuing . 
  yeah , they really fucked indoril armor . 
  hard . 
  you can also extract the music from the game files . 
  the ship was built for this . 
  use structural fuselages for floats , a raised jet for power , and wheels to roll . 
  drive off the runway into the sea , and the sun just happened to be coming up . 
  morrowind instead of skyrim . 
  more than just add a quest here and there , but stays true to the lore : tamriel rebuilt . 
  lord fyr ? 
  nice to see you outside of / r/morrowind !, 
  = hugs =, 
  actually not a bad question ... 
  * you 're, 
  and ctds . 
  morrowind . 
  hundreds of hours and i 'm still being surprised . 
  meticulously crafted world , great modding tools and community . 
  and the atmosphere . 
  gods , the atmosphere ... 
  doing it . 
  you 're going god 's work , right there . 
  because reverse psychology . 
  story time . 
  story time . 
  right now . 
  commenting to pester you in 6 months . 
  okay , 42 months . 
  this calls for an iama, 
  all the towers * that we know about * are on tamriel . 
  seeing as people so rarely visit the other continents , it is entirely possible that other towers exist . 
  i have a similar routine at lvl 1 ... 
  no , you do n't absolutely need [ wraithguard ] ( / spoiler ) . 
  it * can * be replaced with tons and tons of health potions . 
  actually , if you `` kill '' the heart via another method ( like a fortify alchemy loop to give yourself 1000 's of strength ) , you can not use the tools and the game will not run the script ending the main quest . 
  great !, 
  are under 21 's welcome ? 
  if so , i 'll be there . 
  the minecraft soundtrack is actually very fitting ... 
  may you walk on warm sands ... 
  op must deliver ... 
  you 're ... absolutely right . 
  you ... you made me downvote mojang . 
  [ you monster ... ] ( http://imagemacros.wordpress.com/2009/09/07/you-make-bunny-cry/ ), 
  road trip ... 
  i believe the idea is to look for a group of ~ 100 people milling about awkwardly trying to make conversation .
