  correct me if i 'm wrong . 
   not the brightest star in the firmament, 
  do n't mind if i borrow this ... 
  if it helps , i 'll be wearing a green cloak , 
  i actually find it more attractive when girls do n't , but above all , i respect the right to make the choice for yourself . 
  the reddit alien wielding sunder and keening from tes iii : morrowind . 
  sixth house caves , particularly mamaea and ilunibi . 
  i still avoid red lighting like the plague . 
  irrelevant , but how did you get the raichu by your name ? 
  actually , it 's perfectly comfortable . 
  i 'm not exactly sure why , but it is . 
  op , i must urge you to consider [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/ve3xt/urgent_creative_minds_of_reddit_what_can_i_do/c53rwi2 ) plan instead . 
  there could be some very real , legal profit in it for you . 
  the flaming 151 . 
  whole story . 
  ok . first of all , it 's julan , not jular . 
  second of all , good choice of mods , these are the best you will find . 
  for constance : just take away all equipment she has that is n't her best , this will force her to use her better stuff . 
  for a better bow , [ how does daedric sound ? ] ( http://www.uesp.net/wiki/morrowind:vassir-didanat_ebony_mine ) . 
  at the moment , i ca n't answer your question about archer mechanics . 
  however , i can explain constance 's inability to take punishment . 
  whatever you put on her , she is a bosmer archer . 
  she will not have as much health as other characters , ever , because that 's not who she is . 
  as for julan , i would advise light armor and long blades . 
  he 'll be faster , and full glass is a lot easier to find than full daedric . 
  it 's also almost as good as ebony , and about a fifth the weight . 
  edit : just like to say that i do have experience with both of these mods . 
  pm me if you have any more questions . 
  yeah . 
  well , there are always mods ...

  hey !, 
  you scrawny kid there !, 
  get off my lawn !, 
  not really save me , but once i lost my stuffed cat at my high school . 
  this cop let me , a 16-year old boy , spend hours pouring over security footage trying to find him . 
  he kept checking in until i found him . 
  great man . 
  i 'm going with no . 
  i 'll just throw this in : i can create flair and help with an faq / `` wiki '' if that type of thing is desired . 
  yeah , `` creation kit '' is skyrim . 
  `` construction set '' is morrowind . 
  the wbc is the westboro baptist church . 
  not actually part of any baptist organizations , though . 
  they are very conservative , with particular hatred of homosexuals and maintain that obama is the antichrist . 
  they believe that god is punishing america for tolerating homosexuality , and stage protests outside military funerals with signs like `` god hates fags '' or `` thank god for dead soldiers '' . 
  [ their website . 
  i applaud you , sir . 
  you should make a mod for this . 
  doing god 's work right there . 
  i 'm ... not alone ? 
  i have never been entirely supportive of military policy , but what the wb `` c '' does is inhumanly terrible . 
  thank you so much for what you do . 
  no , this is n't an ash storm . 
  it 's a blight storm , the red ash storm type that only occurs withing the ghostfence . 
  it happened in ald ` ruhn due to my teleporting there from red mountain .

  seems the better idea would be to shoot the customer . 
  i like your father-in-law . 
  amen . 
  no , i 'm with you . 
  if it looks like someone might own it , someone probably owns it . 
  ring stats are the same as normal stats . 
  came here for this . 
  most op , awesome `` quest '' in the game . 
  is this all the time , or only when you look at it at certain angles ?

  if he does n't like it , what he gets out of it is worse than nothing . 
  and yes , the are a rather bigoted organization at times . 
  yes . 
  i 'll make it clearer . 
  link to the monkeytruth ? 
  just imagine pissing sand . 
  wow !, 
  good to see you learned , though . 
  i hope your financial situation has improved since then . 
  yeah . 
  as a matter of fact , it was watching this series that inspired the question . 
  nice find , though . 
  good to know , and thank you for your informed comment , 
  oh yes . 
  i know how this goes ... , 
  i love that show . 
  thanks so much !, 
  relevant username ? 
  i 'm not superstitions at all ... until i play dungeons and dragons . 
  then i become a crazed , dice-worshiping maniac . 
  examples :, 
  - always use the green , sparkly 20-sided dice . 
  always . 
  - placing the dice with 1 facing up will prevent said 1 on the roll . 
  - die with dots are luckier than those with numbers . 
  just to name a few .
