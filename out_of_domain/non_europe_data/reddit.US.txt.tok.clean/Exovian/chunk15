  i know . 
  it was just too good an opportunity to pass up . 
  look , if you are worried about that , definitely get morrowind . 
  much less of a memory hog . 
  they 're in the pre-release . 
  they actually closed school due to `` driving hazards '' for that down here in texas . 
  it 's true !, 
   your score was : 100 %, 
  * yes . 
  i think the test was biased toward morrowind fans ; it was rather easy . 
  seeing blue skies over red mountain after the defeat of dagoth ur . 
  god , i love morrowind . 
  everyone needs to read that story . 
  read encyclopedias . 
  hell , just read . 
  a lot . 
  browse wikipedia . 
  just do things that get information into your brain on a daily basis . 
  i could whip something up . 
  edit : it 'll be up tomorrow afternoon . 
  we seem to get this posted every few months . 
  ca n't exactly say i mind , either . 
  seconding the use of minima . 
  it 's my theory that these were made by villagers looking for emerald . 
  therefore , they skipped diamond . 
  no problem . 
  i 'm pretty sure it 's just a script to change the weather , so i could just add that during character creation . 
  anything aside from no ashstorms you wanted ? 
  a fair bit of the us . 
  yes . 
  yes it is . 
  duly noted . 
  actually , poking around , here 's a link to nerevar say nerevar : http://planetelderscrolls.gamespy.com/view.php?view=mods.detail&amp;id=3061, 
  i tested in the snapshot , it works there . 
  [ yes . 
  maybe the sonic screwdriver could be implemented as an amulet ? 
  we need to do this . 
  how does one do this , exactly ? 
  is this steam , or disc version ? 
  hmm ... that 's not my area of expertise , so i 'll have to let someone who knows more about that help you , i 'm afraid . 
  why ? 
  my humor detector is off today . 
   it 's fun to do this on pvp servers and ~ ~ take out ~ ~ bury an entire, 
  base . 
  ftfy, 
  discs . 
  steam is just another layer of stuff to go through . 
  as for mods : [ here 's a guide ] ( http://planetelderscrolls.gamespy.com/view.php?view=tutorials.detail&amp;id=53 ) . 
  also , the [ morrowind mod manager ] ( http://morrowind.nexusmods.com/mods/26260/ ) may suit your needs . 
  i would assume so . 
  i personally have n't used either , but i 've heard they are similar . 
  i am having the same problem , same part . 
  youtube it with minima . 
  you called . 
  hats off to you . 
  permanent summon glitch . 
  so fun . 
  addictions ... obsession with emeralds . 
  i intentionally whole dren plantation . 
  possibly , if as per lord fyr 's theory , corprus was a `` blessing '' , not a disease , then the fall of the dagoths would have rendered it unspreadable . 
  no , think about an enemy casting a spell on you : the effect stays after they die . 
  partially why they 're so annoying ... but just think of corprus like a spell/blessing : it can no longer be `` cast '' , but it remains in those it was given to . 
  tamriel rebuilt is totally worth it . 
  also , julan ashlander companion . 
  my great grandfather served in the imperial german army until 1913 , met the kaiser , and worked as a gardener for both the prince of bavaria and rudolf diesel . 
  in 1913 , he came to the united states and worked on a ranch . 
  he later taught horticulture at the texas school for the deaf . 
  use it . 
  i always use glass arrows from [ sirollus saccus ] ( http://www.uesp.net/wiki/morrowind:sirollus_saccus ) . 
  only at low skill levels , later on a daedric bow is much , much better . 
  describe adom to me . 
  it looks interesting . 
  thank you !, 
  it 's called a screen , oddly enough . 
  [ here 's a picture . 
  ] ( http://www.windowscreen.biz/upload/photo/e27074d201ad626df03b8872d458adf4.jpg ), 
  this is not , in fact , a silverfish , rather , it is a type of centipede known as scutigera coleoptrata . 
  [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:lepisma_saccharina_1a.jpg ) is a silverfish . 
  i feel obligated to point out that sideways stairs would be identical to normal stairs ... 
  food that is not stacked . 
  [ first orbit ] ( http://www.firstorbit.org/watch-the-film ) . 
  fucking beautiful . 
  interesting , but not exactly what i want . 
  i think i 'll just make my own . 
  thanks for the link , though . 
  i want a mod to make default armors , but this does n't have the variety i want . 
  the download link is also broken . 
  the way i was thinking : have what the player can make governed by the armorer skill . 
  have the amount of required stuff equal to what bols indalen requires in tribunal . 
  bonemold armor would use bone meal and resin/shalk resin . 
  netch leather ... is obvious . 
  daedric uses ebony and a daedra heart for each piece . 
  ebony and glass ... use ebony and glass . 
  dreugh would use dreugh wax . 
  i think chitin will use kwama cuttle and resin . 
  indoril will be the same , but with a signifigant gold cost ( for the gold decorations ) . 
  i 'm not sure about iron/steel based stuff yet . 
  additionally , the mod will add books explaining how to make the different types of armor . 
  depending on the type , these might be easy to find , or in the case of stronger armors , much harder .
