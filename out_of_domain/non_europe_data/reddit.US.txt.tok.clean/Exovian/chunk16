  this should prevent characters fresh off the boat pounding out indoril armor . 
  i 'm thinking about implementing this as a gui available at forges , which checks for materials and skill level before allowing you to craft . 
  you will also have to get permission from the owner to use the forge . 
  +15 to marksman . 
  girls ' periods . 
  i 'm a guy , but those things seem so hellish . 
  well , a full set of armor , for by the standard i set , would require ~ 135 units of the materials ( +8 daedra hearts for daedric stuff ) . 
  so while it is easier to get the stuff , you have to get a lot . 
  also , you have to have a certain skill level to craft certain armors , which for things like glass , ebony , or daedric would be very high . 
  as for items , it 's possible , but meshes and models are something i have zero experience with . 
  the game came with a lot , so i could use some of them . 
  i am unsure of the feasibility of adding new items to creatures , but it could be done . 
  ca n't tell if joking or not . 
  males do experience hormonal fluctuation analogous to periods , but they are far less severe . 
  therefore , i would remove them from females .

  for future reference , most americans will simply refer to a bannister as a railing . 
  many of us also know what `` bannister '' means , so do n't worry too much , 
  that punctuation ... 
  whatever happened to pigmen ? 
  you could edit the scale value in the crewtank 's part.config to be .33 instead of 1 .

  not a mod , but a workaround : on the third line of a ship 's . craft file , it says `` type = vab '' . 
  change it to `` type = sph '' .

  i wonder if it 's possible to go from minmus to the mun without a spaceship , only pack rcs ... 
  you read my mind . 
  let 's do it !, 
  oh , you 'll come back . 
  once morrowind gets in your veins , it wo n't come out easily . 
  you may be gone for a while , years even , but you 'll be back . 
  as to what you should do ? 
  hard to say . 
  there are over 400 quests in the base game alone , each one containing it 's own treasured memory . 
  beyond that , there 's the world itself : the netch lazily drifting through the ascandian isles , the tangible power in the halls of vivec 's high fane , the ghostly halls of daedric and dwemer ruins ... 
  yeah , you 'll be back . 
  we all will . 
  i got off minmus and to the mun , i just did n't have the fuel to land . 
  your last point is debatable .

  the ring is entirely independent of actually having lycanthropy . 
  you could use the ring just fine if you had never once been a werewolf .

  i think that with the exception of the yokudan tower , it 's up to speculation . 
  i personally think that there are towers on other continents , and that those continents have as much mythical significance as tamriel , but that 's just my ideas . 
  if you want , i can give you the . craft file to a small plane i made that 's fairly easy to fly , just to get used to things . 
  off-topic , but what is that flair from ? 
  yeah , you should be fine . 
  thanks !, 
  if you assume that the games are scaled the same way , vivec is the most populous city we have data for , with about 330 unique npcs . 
  second is the imperial city , with 194 , followed by mournhold with a little under 125 . 
  nether brick is very dark red . 
  netherrack varies from dark to blood red to salmon colored pink . 
  i am aware of the distinction between mournhold and almalexia . 
  however , we have no data for the wider city , so i gave only what information i could . 
  be as that may , assassin 's creed with magic would be pretty awesome . 
  planets are on rails . 
  i will return with results . 
  i understand , but without some reference , i 'm hesitant to make those extrapolations . 
  you make a good point though ; where is your reference to almalexia being bigger than vivec though ? 
  that said , [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/morrowind/comments/t4vfi/hey_divayth_fyr_can_i_ask_you_a_question/c4jkfe8 ) was incredibly good . 
  if we could get some people to start on a morrowind conversion , i 'd totally be up for helping . 
  i would think they kept any history re-writing to a minimum , so that does make sense . 
  thank you . 
  yeah , but setting it in vivec city or similar would be awesome . 
  bill , hold my beer !, 
  let me know how it goes !,
