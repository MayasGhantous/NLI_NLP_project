  compassion . 
  oh , and a nice cloak/robe . 
  that * always * helps . 
  so , how does it fly ? 
  that series is just a little bit of it . 
  read any book you come across . 
  they 're rather good reads . 
  also , uesp . 
  no need . 
  just a cloak is fine . 
  hats seem a bit gaudy . 
  go into a 8km equatorial orbit and look on the ground around you . 
  it 'll be small . 
  it is a normal entity . 
  i checked the cs , and the reason it ca n't move is because it has no movement animations assigned . 
  oh , we do n't now ? 
  no , i have a decent connection and can normally download stuff without issue , and it took * forever * . 
  i 'd hardly call it a disaster , though . 
  merely an inconvenience solved by waiting ~ 12 hours . 
  as a supposedly rather intelligent male , i can confirm this . 
  liking morrowind helps . 
  a lot . 
  i know . 
  had the poster above me not removed his/her post , that would be clear . 
  please shoot me a pm while en route . 
  i 'd like to join you . 
  yes , it 's rather disappointing , to be honest . 
  no , there were tons in morrowind that had nothing to do with a daedric invasion . 
  do want . 
  badly . 
  someone who might disagree with us . 
  perish the thought . 
  not everyone has one . 
  i agree . 
  red year was a cop out . 
  well , in a way it is , in a way it is n't . 
  it * is * a logical result of vivec 's demand for the love of his people at the end of the thirty-third sermon , but in a way , it also seems like a way for bethesda to avoid revisiting the setting of one of the most popular es games , just by turning the whole area into a wasteland . 
  not a major mod , but it adds nice functionality to a preexisting game element , which is always good . 
  the thief companion constance and julan ashlander companion are , especially in julan 's case , the best companion mods i have ever seen . 
  they are found on other sections of the site . 
  try julan ashlander companion . 
  it gives the main quest a whole new spin , without actually touching the original quest and remaining totally lore-friendly . 
  it 's also an all-around great companion mod . 
  it should take awhile , though . 
  snow can stick around ... 
  yes , that is it . 
  although the prevailing theory is that kagrenac bound the dwemer into the brass skin of numidium , which is the cause of their disappearance . 
  how did you lose your head ? 
  indeed . 
  also has fewest potential repercussions for you . 
  it 's very cool . 
  also , `` a thief companion constance '' is a great mod to go with it . 
  * private thoughts of an armiger redeemed *, 
  * guarded by rival order in the city of the sharmat 's foe . 
  * follow in his footsteps , cursed incarnate *, 
  * find your redemption at the rape-king 's hands . 
  edit : this is actually a hint to get you started . 
  he tried so hard to do what he thought was right ... 
  if anything , i think the destruction of what made them vanish would enable them to come back . 
  nothing powers the heart . 
  the heart is a source of great power itself , possibly greater than an elder scroll . 
  indoril architecture is what the city of mournhold is made of . 
  trying to drive the empire from morrowind and destroy the tribunal ( who betrayed him and nerevar ) . 
  sadly , his methods involved blight storms and turning innocents into corprus beasts , so ... 
  you fast-travel . 
  it is , in fact , impossible not to , as the game randomly generates terrain for eternity ... 
  yes , you do need to play morrowind . 
  make sure to get the goty edition , it is totally worth it . 
  also , / r/morrowind, 
  yeah , you need to start off with at least 1 combat skill at 45-50 , if you want it to be tolerable . 
  let me guess : mushrooms for ajira ? 
  that 's a simple one , if you know what to look for . 
  poke around seyda neen for a bit . 
  more important than quests is character build . 
  i 'd start with a redguard with long blade as a major skill to make things simple to begin with . 
  uesp can also give some advice , and / r/morrowind is always happy to help new players . 
  morrowind , with skyrim graphics/physics . 
  magic and combat can remain mostly the same . 
  good for you . 
  i 've honestly never forgiven the brotherhood for tribunal . 
  this is suitable . 
  very suitable . 
  you are correct . 
  explain the flamethrower . 
  as a 16 year old male working in a daycare , i will be using condoms until my dying day . 
  you tucked that last in so casually ... 
  what was it ? 
  thanks . 
  ( not that i 'll be doing this or anything ), 
  yes . 
  awesome that you were able to quit . 
  [ per request ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/casualiama/comments/zxg3u/iama_guy_who_found_the_dwemer_puzzle_box_in_his/ ) . 
  * very satisfied . 
  i also was curious due to it 's similarity to a jedi holocron . 
  * positively . 
  it inspired me to see if there was a morrowind reddit , which led to , well , / r/morrowind . 
  * about a week , right after the shock of finding it wore off . 
  this caps it . 
  * i would . 
  it would fit nicely with the display housing my morrowind collector 's edition .
