  as someone who has played nothing but a bosmer archer since morrowind , i ca n't help too much . 
  i have heard that being a dunmer spellsword is cool , so you might give that some thought . 
  if this works for commanded targets , you have made my day !, 
  if not , you 've still made my day . 
  this . 
  i ca n't comment on alchemy ; i never use it . 
  my advice is to grind mysticism ( the master trainer is in the west wing of the gateway inn in sadrith mora ) and get both intervention spells and mark & recall . 
  thanks for the nostalgia . 
  nice . 
  i like it !, 
  a tad bit formal looking for my tastes , but i like the way you used the leaf blocks and water together . 
  very creative ; i 've not seen anything like it before . 
  levitation is available like any other spell/potion effect . 
  `` levitate '' belongs to the school of alteration and lets you fly . 
  it is absolutely essential for getting around telvanni towers and for some quests . 
  levitation was removed in oblivion and skyrim to make it easier for the devs to railroad us through dungeons . 
  oh yeah , combat at early levels is a bitch . 
  find a trainer or ~ ~ grind cliff racers ~ ~ you 'll always be grinding cliff racers . 
  patience is key . 
  this . 
  always do this , it is not looked down upon at all . 
  i put them as minor skills if at all . 
  because they level so fast , you get fewer stat increases when you level up . 
  that would be awesome !, 
  thanks for trying .

  building in the top center is the villa . 
  i hope these help . 
  ( edits : location clarifications ), 
  that would accomplish the desired effect . 
  the only difference is that it is technically a different instance of the object - but it works , nonetheless . 
  thanks !, 
  indeed it does . 
  ( soap box mode = 1 ), 
  ahem . 
  bosmer do not annoy everyone . 
  i personally find the ability to take out my enemies from a half-kilometer away quite useful . 
  also , beast tongue is quite handy if you want a [ certain ] ( http://www.uesp.net/wiki/morrowind:mudcrab_merchant ) mudcrab to follow you around . 
  ( soap box mode = 0 ), 
  that said , most of what the gentleman above said is 100 % correct . 
  go in fast with the dagger , fang of haynekhtnamet is awesome . 
  [ this quest ] ( http://www.uesp.net/wiki/morrowind:vassir-didanat_ebony_mine ) can get you an endgame level weapon fast ; get the bow and have some fun . 
  if you have the coin - er , cash - the expansions are well worth it . 
  i would strongly suggest that you get them . 
  no problem , happy to help . 
  at ald daedroth ? 
  the soldiers at the base i 'm turning the ministry of truth into will love that . 
  i think i 'll just use placeatpc commands though , because getting a commanded creature to levitate is a pain . 
  edit : just made a mod that makes lustidrike actually give you a flask of sujamma . 
  that scamp 's really hauling his weight now !, 
  do n't get an overflow loot bag set on you . 
  the only people i left alive are the woman outside who lets you break in and most of the prisoners ( i killed an annoying nord rapist ) . 
  i have lustidrike set up by the fire in the room with the prison cells , surrounded by dancers i hired with `` a lord 's men '' mod . 
  the little guy seems to be enjoying himself . 
  there 's almost certainly a ~ ~ app ~ ~ mod for that . 
  this . 
  those two sites will save your ass more than anything else . 
  this game is one of the best ever made ; by far the pinnacle of rpg gaming . 
  you do n't need to join the mage 's guild to use the guild guides . 
  you can try to find it cheap on amazon or ebay . 
  if you 're looking for a cracked download , you wo n't find many of us willing to help with that . 
  go to [ hlaalo manor ] ( http://www.uesp.net/wiki/morrowind:balmora_homes#hlaalo_manor ) in balmora . 
  1st floor , right by the stairs , is the dead body of ralen hlaalo . 
  the body will never disappear and can hold an infinite amount . 
  infinite storage within 30 seconds walking distance of a stilt strider !, 
  as a bonus , you can do a [ side quest ] ( http://www.uesp.net/wiki/morrowind:the_death_of_ralen_hlaalo ) to find the murderer !, 
  ( see the `` notes '' section on how to start the quest if not in house hlaalu ), 
  me and another guy in robotics class took a piece and each jumped on one end . 
  that popped the sucker . 
  * command humanoid, 
  [ it means that the dark brotherhood will soon pay you a recruiting visit ] ( / spoiler ), 
  yes you do . 
  at the moment , i run no enhancers , although i 'd like to know what you 're running , any framerate boosts are nice . 
  thank you very much !, 
  might i suggest sticking with flin from now on ? 
  oh man , count me in . 
  * ( pulls out crate . 
  ) * two dozen vials !, 
  who wants 'em ? 
  will do !, 
  that reminds me : do you think that bethesda will put it up as a free download when it turns 10 like they did for arena and daggerfall ? 
  that would be cool . 
  you have a couple of options :, 
  - use the the `` togglecollision '' command to see if it glitched through the floor . 
  - level up your security skill . 
  - use the command `` player -  additem `` key_arenim '' 1 '' to give yourself the key . 
  all commands should not include the quotes . 
  dae immediately think `` that 's padme 's hyperdrive from episode 1 '' ? 
  this may sound strange , but what i do when something like this happens is go to the high fane in vivec and pray at every shrine in the room .
