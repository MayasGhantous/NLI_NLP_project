  it totally does . 
  he has legs , he 's just so damn bloated that they 're useless . 
  yes . 
  one of our two major political parties has run on a platform that opposes unions for over 100 years . 
  it 's bullshit . 
  seconded . 
  i 've always been quite fond of him . 
  nice old guy , if a bit cranky . 
  illuminated order is very good , with no glaring lore breaks . 
  i agree . 
  so the new challenge is to land on clouds ? 
  brb , off to jool . 
  erm ... `` falmer '' literally means `` snow elf '' . 
  just in aldmeris . 
  [ here . 
  ] ( http://www.uesp.net/wiki/lore:ehlnofex_languages#common_words ), 
  `` snow folk '' wold be technically correct , but '' - mer '' exclusively refers to elves . 
  did you try walking ? 
  that usually makes them stand up . 
  so i 'm an assassin . 
  ~ 16-year old with a great interest in the soviet space program . 
  go on ... 
  i think when there 's a call and * nothing * happens , they send someone . 
  because that 's often enough a real emergency . 
  that or a troll cat . 
  wow . 
  looks almost like mournhold . 
  i think the pride of getting somewhere is what makes this game what it is . 
  yes , it can be a bit of a circlejerk sometimes , but if that pride involves tipped landers , then let folks submit tipped landers . 
  i see no issue with it . 
  `` this sub reddit is not a replacement for local emergency services , legal consultation , ** medical consultation ** , missing persons inquiries , charity drives , or homework help . 
  these types of posts will be removed . '', 
  - sincerely , the sidebar . 
  those two aspects * do * add things to the game . 
  take skyrim , for example . 
  say i really do n't like maven black-briar . 
  i want to put an arrow through her face and rid riften of her forever . 
  i ca n't , because she 's `` essential '' , even though in this playthrough i 'll never deal with her . 
  that 's a pain in the ass . 
  as for dropping or selling quest items : if i want to say `` fuck the quest , this looks nice and should be on my mantlepiece/this sucks , let 's get rid of it '' , i think i should be able to do that . 
  to be honest , i 'm getting vaguely uncomfortable with how often the physical elder scrolls are starting to appear in the games . 
  then get morrowind 's music . 
  seriously . 
  doing holy work there , friend . 
  link please ? 
  same , i want to know . 
  incorrect . 
  the zimmerman note was sent in 1917 , during wwi , more than a decade before the third reich existed . 
  additionally , mexico , after determining the possibility of such an action , dismissed it entirely . 
  = internet hug =, 
  most importantly : did she say yes ? 
  [ here 's ] ( http://imgur.com/yrsan ) a design that 's great for getting to orbit . 
  feel free to copy and mess around . 
  note that the center engine is a gimballing engine . 
  i smile and say thank you to everyone working in the service or retail industry , always making sure to tell them to have a nice day . 
  the smile i get in return just makes my day . 
  first ten minutes or so of [ first orbit ] ( http://www.firstorbit.org/watch-the-film ) . 
  it 's truly amazing . 
  well , for starters we have something called `` the republican party '' , which tends to get in the way ... 
  i 'd like them to do exactly what they used to do . 
  unique and very needed . 
  mad at its finest ... 
  4 , 3 of which are in skyrim . 
  because bad game design . 
  * winged menace, 
  yeah , i 'd say it should be easy enough . 
  it can be intimidating , but with a rational , level head , a 10-year old can bake a loaf before his parents wake up , with minimal practice beforehand . 
  source : do n't ask . 
  well , if they 're at all like real bulls , then the horns do n't grow until the minotaur becomes more mature . 
  it 's kid was killed by the nerevarine in bloodmoon . 
  dropped a severed nord leg to use as a blunt weapon , too ... 
  going to have to contradict this . 
  ksp is a sandbox game ; if you want to automate part of it to save you the tedium , fine . 
  i 'm not saying it does n't make things easier , but if it helps people enjoy the game , it 's hardly for ` losers '' . 
  dammit , i just got this song out of my head after watching `` space race '' . 
  edit : that line of the song was based on the v2 , which was not an orbital rocket . 
  why do we have to orbit first ? 
  `` rocket man '' by elton john . 
  looks like the walkway by the front door of the lighthouse at seyda neen , looking almost exactly dead west , with a bit of a tilt to the south . 
  but just a little bit . 
  very well . 
  a few years ago , i had depression and was being pulled out of 4th grade to be homeschooled after getting in trouble for catapulting mushrooms at a rival group of kids . 
  i wanted to make something simple and good , so i pulled up [ this ] ( http://pbskids.org/buster/recipes/ny_manhattan_rec.html ) challah bread recipe and started making it at around 4:30 in the morning . 
  a few hours later , when my parents woke up , they found me sitting in front of the oven waiting for the bread to finish . 
  i 'd even cleaned up the kitchen . 
  it remains the best loaf of bread i 've ever eaten . 
  thanks !, 
  therapy fixed the problems , and the bread was very good . 
  enjoy !, 
  i assume the biome is extreme hills ? 
  this is rapidly becoming a distinct possibility . 
  maybe i 'll take a break and finish the full-scale model of vivec city in minecraft first . 
  nice to have you on board . 
  i think those are rejected spawn points made during world creation . 
  not in ksp . 
  in ksp , all a space station is is a ship that you leave in orbit . 
  nothing more , nothing less . 
  huh . 
  in old versions , it was rejected sometimes . 
  i was not aware of this change .
