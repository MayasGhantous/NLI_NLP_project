  while the majority of us are on pc , i can see that you guys need to be in on it too ; you 're no less valuable to the community . 
  `` nerevar rising '' - theme track to * morrowind * . 
  if you find a good mod you feel should be submitted , post it !, 
  it 'd be a nice break from mgso stuff . 
  perhaps . 
  in a few days i 'm going to try to get some things going , and this may well be on the list . 
  they are nowhere near as bad as cliff racers . 
  not even close . 
  as a daycare worker , this describes * every * toddler . 
  it would reply on upvotes , though i could put a link on the top of the page . 
  well , if they do it right , dwemer ruins do look much different between the games . 
  those graphics ... 
  [ the modders have your back . 
  ] ( http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/119724-skywind-mod-jams-morrowind-into-skyrim ), 
  then make a mod . 
  be the modder you want to see . 
  this has crossed my mind . 
  the plan is not to ban tech help at all . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/morrowind/comments/11lj1j/what_do_you_think_about_about_weekly_tech_help/ ) is one plan we have to actually improve the quality of tech help on the sub while still taking up less space on the page . 
  if you have any concerns about this idea , i 'd like to hear it ; constructive criticism is helpful . 
  i 've noticed . 
  as it is , i 'm making it a priority to improve the tech help if anything . 
  i believe it would be possible to graft some of the dermis from your scalp to your chin , thus giving you and artificial beard that stays on and grows by itself . 
  needless to say , do n't try this at home . 
  this . 
  this is good . 
  try [ hlaalo manor ] ( http://www.uesp.net/wiki/morrowind:balmora_homes#hlaalo_manor ) . 
  infinite storage with easy access to services , guilds , and transport . 
  you could also clear out and move into the ministry of truth , but it 's not nearly as accessible . 
  great view , though . 
  has this cousin changed since this , or did he go right back and act tough about it as soon as he got out ? 
  double post . 
  the cliff racer thing may be modified as time goes by . 
  at any rate , flair must be implemented first . 
  i believe the balloons are the ludodyne mod . 
  * users can pm me challenge suggestions . 
  * perhaps . 
  however , we have some users who are still on xbox , so those times will be limited . 
  * tech advice should go in the threads , though unless it becomes an issue i do n't plan to do much with it . 
  an idea for mod suggestions is in the works , but it probably wo n't make it this week . 
  visit the ashlands sometime . 
  or molag amur . 
  the same island with the same features ? 
  this will be considered . 
  thank * you * . 
  just doing our jobs . 
  it is . 
  but it 's very hard to get without murder . 
  shame it 's not enchanted . 
  please repost this question in the tech help thread , and read the new rules at the top of the main page . 
  i use auriel 's bow because it 's 8 pounds lighter . 
  i prefer disks , but that 's just my two cents . 
  pes is dying , so use nexus or great house fliggerty when possible . 
  julan ashlander companion is a great mod , much better than standard companion fare if you get into it . 
  thanks !, 
  i 'll let the bounty thing slide this once , as your character looks so damn stylish in that hat ... 
  where has this seed been all my life ? 
  hate to sound crazy , but what 's the dark grey pore-looking block in front of the windows ? 
  you are not alone . 
  you can , but it 's noticeably inferior to the pc version . 
  after my character accidentally went through vivec in an indoril helm , rooftops became the only real way to get around , so speak for yourself . 
  on behalf of all of your future students , i 'm sorry . 
  you have an awesome looking dog . 
  so that makes it 0-2 for the cliff racers , then ? 
  in all seriousness , what are your thoughts on variations of the fork-beard thing being used in future weekly challenges ? 
  i 'd love to hear those ideas ; it 's nice to have some other input . 
  template ? 
  i know this reference ... 
  i reddit too much . 
  perhaps . 
  that said , the tech help thread has as much a role making help easy to find as it does clearing the front page . 
  welcome to texas ... 
  to be fair , tricking someone into touching your penis should be criminal in some way . 
  it would be awesome if mobs with pumpkin heads did n't despawn . 
  = internet hug =, 
  no , if you start too high up ( ~ 2km ) it just explodes . 
  i think so . 
  no reason to slap rules on if it 's not a problem . 
  only major flaw in your plan is that there is no settlement at bal isra until the later portion of the redoran questline . 
  this thread has been marked as spam due to all technical help questions being referred to the weekly tech help thread linked at the top of the page . 
  if you have any questions , pm me . 
  i think if you activate the parachute before dropping the load , it will activate in the atmosphere if you are zoomed in to that piece of debris . 
  you misnamed caldera as pelagiad . 
  other than that , great run !, 
  no solid rules , but spoiler tags would be appreciated . 
  inns in the telvanni district :,

  do i get to be proud that as a 16-year old high school student , i can , in fact , reliably describe the locations of syria and iran ? 
  also an american who likes soccer . 
  i play defender best , though . 
  because native dunmer can hear your non-native accent , and react accordingly . 
  no , any tool , even fists , give you small mushrooms . 
  tell your nephew good job . 
  just a project to get your feet wet , the `` joseph '' pod from the demo , crew capacity 1 , but with iva view and a hatch . 
  you are n't . 
  indoril armor is gilden chitin . 
  i do n't know what that is , but it 's no gilded chitin . 
  this looks fantastic !, 
  in a very general sense , how is progress going on this/other areas ?
