  ohh mage falling from the sky !, 
  ohh cool scrolls !, 
  let 's try !, 
  wheeeeeeeee-splat . 
  peak oil . 
  third paragraph of the post , last sentence . 
  open it in the cs , and try manually assigning the mesh to the sword . 
  any images will be vanilla . 
  mgso is an overhaul . 
  it brings the graphics up to date , spectacularly so , though some of us prefer vanilla . 
  it is resource intensive . 
  it 's fine . 
  we were all new one time . 
  i do n't know , you 'll have to try . 
  there are also settings that you can alter for lower impact . 
  [ linky ] ( http://www.ornitocopter.net/ ) . 
  i just memorized the lines . 
  i think . 
  the last spin off , / r/moddingmorrowind , went absolutely abysmally . 
  there 's simply no way to get enough of the userbase to check another sub . 
  i like grey with hazard tape ^ tm ... 
  i used to have a great looking ceramic one . 
  sadly , i stained it with powdered rocket fuel at age 6 . 
  dad was not amused . 
  [ the rear guard ] ( http://www.uesp.net/wiki/morrowind:the_rear_guard ) is my personal favorite . 
  ok , it looks like race flair is a popular choice . 
  i 'll try to have candidates up within 24 hours . 
  yeah . 
  i wanted to make gunpowder from a hobby rocket motor , so i figured to best way would be to strip the casing and grind it up . 
  i would like a minecon cape . 
  in my defense , it did work . 
  classmate and i figured out how to do that . 
  you need a partner . 
  lay it on the floor , and each jump on one end . 
  very satisfying . 
  you really do . 
  `` artomix '' is still awesome . 
  soon ^ tm, 
  tattoos , austin ... yeah , that fits . 
  link to forum leak ? 
  not in-laws , grandparents . 
  not that old . 
  yet . 
  thanks for providing the link , i 'm sure a lot of people can use that . 
  dres ? 
  ~ ~ do we get the other great houses too ? ~ ~, 
  i may need to stop playing morrowind . 
  man , that 'd be awesome . 
  masser is literally a retextured mars , so ... make duna red/pink ? 
  actually , i think reman launched expeditions to the moons . 
  ask / r/teslore more about that if you want . 
  they 've been going 10 years , and keep getting more members . 
  skyrim for the nords : [ 100 ] ( http://www.proprofs.com/quiz-school/quizreport.php?title=skyrim-for-the-nords&amp;sid=29178260 ) !, 
  let 's get [ meta ] physical : [ 100 ] ( http://www.proprofs.com/quiz-school/quizreport.php?title=lets-get-metaphysical&amp;sid=29178395 ) !, 
  and obscure lore : [ 90 ] ( http://www.proprofs.com/quiz-school/quizreport.php?title=obscure-lore_1&amp;sid=29178652 ) !, 
  well , his fang being a sweet dagger does n't hurt . 
  well , word from some of the tr guys is that it 's going better than ever . 
  so , hope . 
  tr should be installed * after * mgso . 
  that may help . 
  maybe i 'm wrong ; it 's happened before . 
  after having looked at your tr errors , it looks like a problem i used to have . 
  what version of tr : sacred east is it ? 
  on the plus side , i got my girlfriend into morrowind . 
  exovian . 
  i guess it does n't save the certificate . 
  this is called good parenting . 
  as a day care worker , do n't dress them the same . 
  it makes our lives hell . 
  i assume this goes for teachers too . 
  crash and burn . 
  a lot . 
  dwemer . 
  posting for update . 
  you and kurt are the two reasons i bought this game . 
  thank you . 
  not well . 
  you really need to sink some more time in to fully explore it . 
  eh , as far as i can tell , the general opinion here is that skyrim is just a slow climb back up from oblivion . 
  another for atronach mages : drain intelligence 100 points on self for 1 second . 
  it recalculates your magicka , thus totally regenerating it . 
  a bit cheat-y , but fun . 
  mcp has an option to fix it . 
  i 'm just some kid from texas , but somehow i am aware of the existence of perth . 
  to be fair , the game does leave the option of visiting and never doing those quests . 
  lore is vague enough to include that possibility . 
  i think it 's a good game . 
  if i were to rate it on it 's own merits , it 'd be just below skyrim , which is just below morrowind . 
  they 're all awesome games . 
  later this evening , i 'll look into this . 
  yes . 
  escape velocity from the solar system from earth is 42.1 km/s . 
  the earth 's velocity around the sun is 29.78 km/s . 
  it would be easier to cancel earth 's velocity and plummet into the sun than to escape the system . 
  my girlfriend immediately comes to mind . 
  then i realize it 's entirely explainable : she 's brilliant and gorgeous . 
  i 'm male , but i have relatively long hair . 
  it 's ok for the neck , but it does not do shit for ears . 
  you should really just stay inside after ut games . 
  marquis_andras is correct .
