  alternatively , we could get propellers . 
  you may be right . 
  or course , if we 're going with practicality , even sending our trash close to the sun would incinerate it , so really , either way works . 
  if it was shot in the opposite direction of the travel of the earth , the perihelion would be lower that that of the earth . 
  the closer its speed away from the earth got to the earth 's speed around the sun , the lower the perihelion gets . 
  when they equal , it falls straight into the sun . 
  divayth was n't actually on the council . 
  right . 
  constant effect drain magicka shackles . 
  check your skill , and your fatigue - that makes a huge difference . 
  there is a value in the savefile , `` bads '' , that is always '' = true '' for jeb , and only jeb . 
  ass . 
  welll ... there goes the weekend . 
  mgso does good . 
  not a clue . 
  well , we 'd have less quality , that 's for sure . 
  7zip is a good tool , and can work with most filetypes . 
  err ... the gray cowl * is * nocturnal 's . 
  i assume you finished the intro sequence ? 
  one thing a neighbor of mine did is write a short book about her life , with a lot of interesting stories in it . 
  after she passed , it 's a very nice thing to have . 
  on the plus side , xenon is small , and you can add a few to multiply the range . 
  ok . [ here ] ( http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/1/17166/1695171-morrowind_super.jpg ) 's an image of the ui . 
  by default , i believe this is opening via right-clicking . 
  let 's go over each menu one by one . 
  at top left is a widow displaying your stats , name , skills , and faction affiliation and level . 
  not much more to see there . 
  top right is the map . 
  local and world view are available . 
  bottom left widow is your inventory . 
  the blue bar shows how much weight you 're carrying . 
  to equip something , drag and drop it on to the image of your character . 
  bottom right window is your list of spells , magical items , and powers . 
  click to equip , `` r '' to ready , and click to cast . 
  below the inventory menu is a small display showing health , magicka , and fatigue , as well as your equipped weapon and magic item . 
  at the very bottom right of the screen is the minimap . 
  `` j '' accesses the quest journal . 
  i think morrowind code patch does it . 
  the code patch is a third party mod , so yes . 
  well , humans have friggin * babies * ... 
  if you put multiple command pods on , do all of them start with kerbals in them ? 
  please post to the tech help thread . 
  please post to the tech help thread . 
  that was levitation . 
  the screeching vanguard of the hordes of hell . 
  as a fellow star wars nut , thanks for saving me the rant . 
  that would be cool to build in minecraft . 
  i 'm working on vivec city , at the moment . 
  all . 
  the nice part is that the basic structure can just be copied , so if i do that first , it makes it much easier . 
  this thing have interplanetary range ? 
  kerbal space program and morrowind . 
  you be quiet . 
  in my opinion , beth needs to stop pandering to microsoft . 
  it makes the industry look weak , and maybe someone having some nerve publishing their game would set a better example . 
  so ... where have you been since dawnguard came out ? 
  your scrutiny is appreciated . 
  the edits have been made . 
  this looks like a quarren to me . 
  the discrimination . 
  the casual acceptance of the horrific ( 10 years old ? 
  better fuck her ! ) . 
  basically , the minority who use the anonymity of the internet to go as low as is possible . 
  for some applications , hydrogen . 
  party baloons can use that just fine . 
  good - caring for a pet, 
  bad - smoking, 
  this looks like a dungeon from daggerfall . 
  i will . 
  but morrowind is where all of this started , and these are the people i want to show it to first . 
  what is the name of the line of ships i made in kerbal space program to reach the mun for the first time ? 
  i did get that feeling myself concerning azura 's dream , at least . 
  i do plan on making it less literal as time goes on , the only question being how far to go . 
  just going to say that that stuff is awesome . 
  the triple point is simply a point in temperature and pressure at which all three states can exists simultaneously . 
  as to your second question , unsure . 
  i 'm starting to think we should make/find a good tutorial for people to link to ... 
  yeah . 
  my `` art of morrowind '' book has a depiction of vivec 's birthday . 
  makes sense . 
  my own opinion is that the intro scene is both iconic enough to warrant inclusion and dynamic enough to avoid feeling feeling static . 
  it also serves as a good method of introducing the character and his personality and thought process . 
  it 's also true that simply telling to game as a story would be incredibly shallow . 
  feel free to join us at / r/morrowind . 
  from [ varieties of daedra ] ( http://www.uesp.net/wiki/lore:varieties_of_daedra ) :, 
  `` divayth fyr told me that he , by choice , trafficked only with two daedra powers -- mehrunes dagon and azura . 
  azura , he said , knew and understood all things , and declined to speak of these things , or only spoke in riddles . 
  mehrunes dagon , on the other hand , out of pride , fixity of purpose , and a predictable lack of subtlety in thought , knew nothing and understood nothing , and was inclined to speak freely and without falsehood . '', 
  i laughed at this . 
  i 'll say something about that : you 're a human being . 
  no matter what illness you have , you deserve honesty in a relationship . 
  it 's possible that his/her relationship with you could n't have worked . 
  it happens . 
  but if that 's the case , your partner owes it to you to end things honestly * before * moving on . 
  cheating like that is wrong , and you certainly did n't `` deserve '' it . 
  you `` deserve '' someone better . 
  that was awesome . 
  how close is other land ? 
  and large biomes ?
