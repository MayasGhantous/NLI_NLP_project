  seriously , give credit . 
  ah , the old days ... try putting decouplers under the engine . 
  be nice to see . 
  hopefully some people learned some things whether they finished or not ; that was the real point behind mod challenges to begin with . 
  might i ask : what kinds of talents are needed to push to project forward , and how does one sign up ? 
  to be clear , is `` mwscript '' what the scripts in the cs are ? 
  well , i guess there goes my weekend . 
  wow ... 
  i need to update my graphics card ... 
  ... ok . you have just won the internet . 
  we 're going home , folks . 
  really , it was a beth retcon to explain why it was n't included in * oblivion * . 
  lore wise ... not a clue . 
  go to yagrum . 
  ... i may have to say `` no '' for this one . 
  yeah . 
  tor is your friend . 
  i 'm actually on a project to map it right now . 
  it 's big . 
  or , you know , take it to a smith . 
  asshole . 
  worship the all-maker . 
  [ start here ] ( http://www.uesp.net/wiki/lore:aevar_stone-singer ) . 
  other than that , you really have to play through the main quest of bloodmoon , which i highly recommend . 
  this is amazing !, 
  so his point is automatically correct . 
  / r/morrowind, 
  out of curiosity , how much is the team going to draw on tes v : * skyrim * for the mod , if at all ? 
  it was n't , most likely . 
  message the mods about this , the bot is n't always right . 
  moderator - bot is a bot . 
  i found the post browsing moderator-bot 's history . 
  that 's the sundered heart that you have an image of . 
  not until later . 
  [ source ] ( http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/sundered_heart ) . 
  i 'm going to say that dremora armor was probably a gameplay decision to avoid the pc having daedric stuff at low level more than it was an accurate representation . 
  ... that 's damn good . 
  oh * that * error . 
  try reinstalling , guess . 
  source for that last ? 
  if you can find a source for this , that would be great . 
  `` gnisis '' has always had two short - i 's ( think `` nit '' ) to me . 
  how did you get the fire in water ? 
  as a proud owner of the collector 's edition , i can confirm that those figurines are amazing . 
  from the [ wiki ] ( http://kspwiki.nexisonline.net/wiki/kerbol ) :, 
  `` the current ` surface ' of kerbol is an invisible , and likely , featureless plateau approximately 4500-4700 km above the nominal radius . 
  there is no known way to land on it , as the kraken makes all maneuvering difficult , and the gravity reduces the twr of all engines below 1 . 
  one can attempt to place edited parts on the surface , but they bounce erratically at a few hundred to a few thousand m/s if they do not explode . '', 
  not mine , but http://tes.ag.ru/mw/articles/img/ce_figurine.jpg, 
  i 've been thinking about casting lead replicas , but i have a feeling beth might have something to say about that . 
  the three orange suits are in the pod , and the tanks are full . 
  this is the propulsion system , designed to get the rest of it to dres . 
  ginsweater cove ? 
  i can get behind this . 
  so the idea is the the fire then melts the ice , which does not itself cause a block update , so the water never checks to flow into the fire ? 
  i 'm kind of a fan of glitch buildings , so this should be quite fun !, 
  geofley cove , then ? 
  yeah , let 's go with that ; you did it already . 
  paging nova ... 
  yeah , it 's us . 
  thing is , the law must be more complicated than that . 
  otherwise , i could just copy morrowind and give away that , and i 'm rather certain that 's * not * legal . 
  diamond [ macuahuitl ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/macuahuitl ) ? 
  this is what rcs is for ... 
  if , on entirely independent merits , i wanted to pursue a meaningful relationship with them , then yes . 
  not at all . 
  some us us like the new graphics , others like me are just fine with the old stuff . 
  i 'm with you . 
  crying does n't show immaturity . 
  if it shows anything , it can show that you 're mature enough to care . 
  ... sponges ? 
  you just made my day . 
  thank you for that !, 
  just graphics , pretty much . 
  relevant username ? 
  edit : for those of you who apparently do n't get it , kilgore trout is a character in * slaughterhouse 5 * who writes very disturbing , surreal books , often read by the protagonist . 
  i 'm not that old , but i work with kids on a daily basis . 
  the thought of that happening to any of them ... 
  well , til . 
  thank you . 
  games being the primary source for lore , would not the `` s '' being universally said in-game make * that * canon ? 
  * . craft, 
  if you equip a follower with a weapon with a long duration poison enchantment , it continues even after they enter their protective state , and can kill them . 
  [ sirollus saccus ] ( http://www.uesp.net/wiki/morrowind:sirollus_saccus ) has restocking glass arrows . 
  also , arrows do follow gravity to some extent in morrowind , aim accordingly . 
  also , the skyrim pic was in sovngarde . 
  on the 9th day of christmas my kerbal gave to me : 9 sepratrons , 8 ion engines , 7 frames per second , 6 space stations , five docked space ships , 4 duna landers , 3 heavy lifters , 2 srbs , and a payload in an ssto . 
  on the 12th day of christmas , my kerbal gave to me : 12 munar arches , 11 icbms , 10 solar panels , 9 sepratrons , 8 ion engines , 7 frames per second , 6 space stations , five docked space ships , 4 duna landers , 3 heavy lifters , 2 srbs , and a payload in an ssto !, 
  you know we love you , right ? 
  if anything other than `` boz-murr '' ever appeared in-game , i 'd accept that . 
  but every person , no matter how educated or not they are , that says the name says `` boz-murr '' . 
  and to me , an old mk post does n't override that . 
  make of that what you will . 
  early on , especially , they are hell . 
  see , back in morrowind , a low weapon skill actually meant you had a good chance of not hitting your opponent . 
  totally !, 
  yeah , pretty much . 
  thing is , in morrowind , until your waepon skills were in the 40 's and up , you had a better than even chance of missing , regardless of stamina . 
  so , you spam attacks for 10 levels . 
  and yet the glitch around which so much of nature is built .
