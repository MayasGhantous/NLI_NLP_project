  they manipulate it , play in it , and explore new parts of the dream . 
  i propose that they inherently have chim , that is , they are aware that they are toying with , and are part of , a dream . 
  finally , we come to mortals . 
  they are the other people in a dream , like the npcs in a game . 
  some , like talos or the tribunal , discover or are made aware that they are part of a dream , and rather than zero-summing , accept this and gain the ability to manipulate the dream , much like the et ` ada . 
  discussing this theory with r/teslore . 
  interesting . 
  and a very interesting read at that . 
  thank you !, 
  i can confirm that it does . 
  tink of it as a mage casting a spell . 
  anyone can twirl their arms of swing a staff , but without an understanding of the spell , it can not be cast . 
  conversely , you can understand a spell all you want , but unless you twirl your arms or swing a staff , you ca n't cast the spell either . 
  * think, 
  glad i could help .

  thanks for the info on bloatspores . 
  and yes , concept art is fine . 
  thank you very much !,

  thank you !, 
  that helps . 
  the morrowind feeling does n't wear off . 
  use mcedit to see if it makes a void hole anywhere ... 
  `` this saint jiub fellow '' is on the starting boat in morrowind . 
  [ the rear guard ] ( http://www.uesp.net/wiki/morrowind:the_rear_guard ) . 
  best book in the game , as far as i 'm concerned . 
  because nostalgia ... 
  damn ... 
  nice job . 
  oblivion was out when i first played ( at ~ age 15 ) . 
  i had plenty of games that most would consider `` better '' , but morrowind is still the best . 
  not nostalgia , it 's just awesome . 
  helseth 's ring . 
  go to the `` morrowind '' folder ( where morrowind installed to ) and find the folder called `` date files '' . 
  put everything that came with the mod in there . 
  then start the game , click `` data files '' on the launcher , and check the mods you want . 
  [ imperial legion badge ] ( http://planetelderscrolls.gamespy.com/view.php?view=mods.detail&amp;id=461 ) , if you ever want to do the legion questline . 
  all right , thanks for the help . 
  i know i fucked up the morag tong quests themselves , i just wanted to make sure no miscellaneous quests were also messed up . 
  also , sweatpantswarrior gave a fantastic description of the morag tong quests . 
  nice job . 
  both . 
  additionally , if you do n't already , get both expansions . 
  they are fantastic . 
  try going to the corprusarium after whacking the heart of lorkhan . 
  corprus is alive and well . 
  because bethesda tried to `` appeal to a wider market '' ( `` wider market '' = casual gamers with no patience or appreciation of depth ) . 
  edit : dutch_wilkerson is right , should be casual , not console . 
  you finished the 427 quests in morrowind ? 
  the 39 in tribunal ? 
  the 58 in bloodmoon ? 
  * all 524 quests ?!, 
  get some mods and go at it again . 
  no , you 're not . 
  i play with no enhancers at all , and i love it . 
  do n't know why you 're getting downvotes , this is completely true . 
  uesp, 
  generally free , anyone can download source code and edit as they wish . 
  i 'm thinking 1 each for the 3 guilds , the 3 houses , the morag tong , the imperial cult , the legion , and the temple . 
  possibly some skaal or mournhold stuff to go with the expansions . 
  find some pics and run them by darkonion . 
  exactly what dimensions should the images be ? 
  that 's it all right . 
  while small , they are no smaller than bosmer . 
  i poked around , 50x30 pixels seems to be a good average size . 
  this . 
  to be totally sure , rent/find a bed and sleep in it . 
  happy cake day !, 
  auriel 's bow + glass arrow = problem solved . 
  new flair for all the mods ? 
  and thank you for doing so !, 
  my `` mun runner iii '' just made munar orbit using the more traditional method , but as soon as i figure out how to use the navball , i 'm trying your method . 
  what mods ? 
  press `` m '' . 
  i thought about this , but if i only used the symbol , many users would not recognize some of them . 
  likewise , not all npcs are highly recognizable ; the combination maximizes recognition . 
  also , it made the images fit the standard flair shape better . 
  now that 's some food for thought , at least for the houses . 
  what about the other factions ? 
  i do . 
  i think one of morrowind 's greatest strengths was the number of factions and playstyles , and that we should try to include as many as is reasonable in the flair . 
  thank you !, 
  let 's see , sanguine appears as an average size dremora , and being the prince of revelry , probably has a sizable package . 
  mehrunes dagon is huge , and is * obviously * trying to compensate for something . 
  i therefore propose that a daedric prince 's dick size is inversely proportional to the size of the daedric prince . 
  play morrowind . 
  you meet three ( though all are in disguise , and you find out about it after the fact ) . 
  redoran . 
  definitely redoran .
