  [ taking your time , i see .

  i kid about that , may the best outlander win !, 
  very nice idea . 
  you have inspired something , give me a while . 
  a change from the old days . 
  back in morrowind , if a quest told you to find a book , find a library or a bookseller and start hunting . 
  gorgeous . 
  i never noticed that in other pictures as much . 
  i thought nova made these solid . 
  put a stone pressure plate over stone , wood over wood . 
  not perfect , but decent . 
  it also has some fantastic mountains and national parks . 
  planning on making any updates to iron out things ? 
  removed . 
  tech help thread has been recommended and linked ; use it . 
  actually , some areas have internet monitored by , and for use by , government officials . 
  i agree . 
  i wish the area below the temple was done though !, 
  difficulty ? 
  or on the computer ? 
  both on par with the base game . 
  it 's a project to recreate mainland morrowind . 
  it 's released in parts , and part 3 is out now . 
  pick it up [ here ] ( http://morrowind.nexusmods.com/mods/42145/ ) ; this download includes all work completed so far , and roughly doubles the game size . 
  i just use this one , always . 
  at least it can be pronounced . 
  reminds me of my days in the slime protection agency . 
  hell of a learning cliff , but worth it . 
  keyboard controls and the ability to pause for most things mean it should be doable . 
  [ getting started within 45 minutes ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fouti1atw2y&amp;list=plec6ed120eba3d26f&amp;index=1 ) is a good tutorial . 
  have no shame about getting the lazy newb pack recommended , you will need it . 
  yes . 
  german teacher showed us this first week of class . 
  i actually appreciate it much more now . 
  daggerxl is looking pretty good . 
  ca n't wait until their beta comes out . 
  back up now . 
  well , my brother and i ( both quite young at the time ) wanted to name the dog hindenburg . 
  mom and dad said no , so we compromised and named him `` zeppelin '' . 
  looking good !, 
  hlaalo manor . 
  always . 
  maybe polygon count . 
  boosting the station to an orbit of  150 km helps , as does not facing the planet while looking at it . 
  when the thought of her not being there hurt . 
  this requires that north korea get it across the ocean undetected . 
  i do n't think they ( reliably ) have that kind of capability . 
  no , missed , but i can see how it would be an easy mistake . 
  i 'm not doubting that they have the equipment . 
  i 'm doubting that this equipment is running reliably enough , crewed with skilled enough personnel , to run such a distance . 
  i just have my little story of everyone using similar gold coins , and beth just simplified it into one model . 
  just going to jump in and say i like the map . 
  it 's appropriate . 
  exactly . 
  more stages . 
  it 's roughly based off an old design , the deimos ii , seen [ here ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-v3aryj8ie8&amp;feature=youtu.be ) . 
  tunnel about y = 120 . 
  solid , so nothing gets you . 
  to clarify , to return , the ship can or can not be orbiting within 10 km ? 
  i am a bit like that , but that 's because i go to a crappy school , would like to not spend my time with classmates out drinking , and am only able to visit my girlfriend on saturdays . 
  if you have a desktop , maybe let him use that a little to check stuff . 
  four hours is nothing to whine about , though , and if he gives shit for it , i see no issue with removing it . 
  i swear , rockomax has nova as a paid sponsor . 
  reddit randomizes things a bit to foil bots . 
  but , the download was much faster than normal . 
  you can . 
  it 's just not as epic as it should be . 
  you play kotor ? 
  it 's really good , and you can probably pick it up cheap . 
  i assume that province cyrodiil is also compatible ( planned ) ? 
  yes !, 
  it was on the highest . 
  i am suspecting that it may be a shader issue with the effect itself . 
  why is that ? 
  genuinely curious here . 
  make them realistic . 
  ksp ships go much slower than irl ships . 
  2 km/s for low orbit re-entry as opposed to over 7 , for instance . 
  try turning the effect setting to the lowest , so it does n't try to render . 
  sure , missing feature , but at least things wo n't be pink . 
  or it just sucked to begin with . 
  which part of texas ? 
  there is actually a lot of variety here . 
  also we 're awesome . 
  but yes , all of those points are good . 
  i will be surprised if these do n't come soon . 
  they really are the next logical step in planetary exploration . 
  vivec , from tes iii : morrowind . 
  bribe guy at the top . 
  `` we pay 50 instead of 100 , but that 50 goes straight to your pocket . '', 
  `` we also wo n't release all this incriminating information we have about you '' probably also factors in . 
  patcher is discontinued until it works .

  the editor ids may be more helpful :, 
  flin : * potion_cyro_whiskey_01 * . 
  additionally , from in-game dialogue , `` imported cyrodiilic whiskey is called flin . 
  this stimulating beverage is imported and expensive , but has none of the unpleasant side effects of other intoxicating beverages . 
  a sharp boost in strength and willpower is what most people experience . '',
