  [ wikipedia suggests ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/whisky ) that the variety of possible components is too wide to make an accurate guess . 
  beyond that , nothing . 
  greef : * potion_comberry_brandy_01 * . 
  dialogue : `` the native comberry brandy is locally called greef . 
  greef is a strong stimulant , but like all intoxicants , it tends to impair physical coordination . 
  that is , it makes you feel real strong , but makes you clumsy . '', 
  now , i 'm no expert , but we may be looking at some sort of comberry brandy here . 
  matze : * potion_local_brew_01 * . 
  not so helpful . 
  but : `` mazte is a local beer brewed from fermented saltrice . 
  cheap , plentiful , and invigorating , this beverage is very popular , despite its dulling effect of wit and judgement . 
  for the price , folks are willing to feel dumb and weak-willed , so long as they feel really strong . '', 
  there you go . 
  shein : * potion_comberry_wine_01 * . 
  `` the native comberry wine is locally called shein . 
  shein is a strong stimulant , but using it results in impaired judgement . 
  you may gain a lot of endurance , but you wo n't be very smart . '', 
  comberry wine , then . 
  sujamma : * potion_local_liquor_01 * . 
  dialogue is similarly unhelpful : `` the local dunmer liquor , sujamma , is extremely potent , and indulgence results in elevated spirits and diminished mental faculties . 
  the local dunmer liquor , sujamma , is extremely potent , and indulgence results in elevated spirits and diminished mental faculties . 
  has a kick like a guar -- very strong , and just as stupid . '', 
  well , hopefully 3/5 is ok . 
  happy to help !, 
  edit : for the curious , vintage brandy has the id * p_vintagecomberrybrandy1 * , so it seems comberry is a popular choice among dunmer brewers . 
  eh , it 's fine . 
  the kind words mean more than the karma !, 
  it often does , but it would be nice for the wikia to state that . 
  patched . 
  give the modders a bit . 
  more probably japanese , though some russian areas are possible . 
  tech help thread is for this . 
  repost there if cml33 was not able to solve your problem . 
  removed . 
  maybe i will look in to setting up a list of livestreams on a wiki page or something . 
  ideas . 
  i do love that munbase .

  i always take a stack of dirt for such possibilities . 
  you should . 
  good movie . 
  fair . 
  cheap morrowind . 
  no reason at all , other than your last point . 
  in fact , in all cases , it is simpler and easier to just have glowstone , a jack-o-lantern , or torches than it is to do things like this . 
  but some people enjoy the challenge , and they can do some cool stuff !, 
  no , if you 're more than 2km from something it is n't loaded . 
  a kerbal on eva is its own entity . 
  i 'm a high school kid , use no math , and with practice have managed an interplanetary trip and docking . 
  you 'll do fine !, 
  certainly !, 
  one , do try to start small . 
  back when i started , there was a lot of competition to see who could make the smallest rocket do a given thing ( orbit , mun ) . 
  passing fad , maybe , but these types of things are a good way to explore the limits of the parts , your piloting , etc. 
  i recommend trying to get to orbit without asas at least once . 
  painful , but that practice will come in handy guiding a ship onto the mun . 
  in case it helps , the best time to start the gravity turn ( where you turn away from vertical to start gaining horizontal velocity for orbit ) between 10 and 13 km up . 
  second , there are a lot of tutorials out there to help . 
  you may have heard scott manley mentioned . 
  that 's because he makes awesome stuff , and has an awesome voice , to boot . 
  for mun transfers , start the burn as the mun is coming up over the horizon . 
  that 's what i learned , and it 's worked like a charm . 
  for interplanetary : http://ksp.olex.biz/ is your friend . 
  hope this helps !, 
   ~ ~ american ~ ~ school kids do just as obnoxious , rude and disrespectful things . 
  i actually have a few of these things ( add , dysgraphia ) and i must say i agree with your point . 
  i did n't improve because i screwed around , swallowed a pill , and magically got better . 
  i improved because we did some research , took a _ few _ meds for a short period of time , worked hard , and mom and dad were not afraid to say `` it 's your responsibility to do this . 
  not ours , not your teachers ' . '', 
  the issues are there , but be intelligent and honest in addressing them . 
  play version 3.5 , not 4 . 
  please . 
  it is supposed to be in the comments , to be voted on . 
  seconding starfire 's . 
  should n't it be simple to make a mod fixing this rather glaring issue ? 
  skinned thalmor ... we need to get a modder on this . 
  there might be with the mwse . 
  but morrowind 's code comes with no method to support markers like this . 
  you did n't have pigmen . 
  a pick enchanted with `` silk touch '' mines a block itself instead of giving it 's drop . 
  so , lapis/diamond/redstone / emerald/coal ore block instead of lapis , diamond , etc. 
  you tested this ? 
  does it work on the mainland ? 
  well , i 'm an uber peon who mooches off his brother 's ps3 . 
  so it should work . 
  zombie pigmen are , but plain pigmen are not . 
  the skin is in the files , and they 're what villagers were originally intended to be . 
  i hope those dancing ordinators are n't permanent . 
  more seriously , i hope you know how happy this makes me feel for you all . 
  i remember back in 2009-10 thinking the project was dead after telvannis barely had any quests . 
  here we are , 3 years later , and everything 's going full steam ahead toward another decade of the best , most dedicating work toward any game , commercial team or modders , that i think any of us have ever seen . 
  this is going to put necrom and port telvannis in the shade , and that 's no mean feat . 
  thank you all very much . 
  the later . 
  this ensures better compatibility with other mods affecting mournhold ; additionally , the size does not exactly match up . 
  this may also be the only way to do the levitation ban that mournhold is slightly infamous for . 
  wow , that is one old map .
