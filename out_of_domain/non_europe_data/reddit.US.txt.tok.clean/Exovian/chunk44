  nice one , though !, 
  we all do . 
  yay !, 
  it 's out !, 
  it 's out !, 
  ahem , i mean , that 's awesome !, 
  and province cyrodiil , and shotn , and ... 
  and that . 
  not really . 
  it 's an option , but without satisfaction for me . 
  arena was the whole continent . 
  daggerfall was southern high rock and northern hammerfell , and was much more detailed . 
  additionally , / r/morrowind . 
  kind of defeats the point of hardcore . 
  what are the lander legs for ? 
  nice !, 
  i should try this on my next design . 
  i 'm going to be one of the people who says `` i do n't like it '' about the new style . 
  a lot of subs have been doing it , and really , it 's not that good . 
  aside from default ? 
  i guess my main complaint is the fact that everything is boxed off and sterile looking . 
  love having more progress seen !, 
  this is looking good !, 
  ingun is not essential , and after promises to keep , neither is sibbi . 
  doing [ this quest ] ( http://www.uesp.net/wiki/skyrim:the_lover%27s_requital ) before purging sibbi is another way to get back at him . 
  [ vald 's debt ] ( http://www.uesp.net/wiki/skyrim:vald%27s_debt ) is at least a way to get someone out from under maven 's thumb . 
  [ bringing ingredients to ingun ] ( http://www.uesp.net/wiki/skyrim:few_and_far_between ) prior to killing her may make her a viable target for the ebony blade , if that 's of interest to you . 
  [ black-briar manor ] ( http://www.uesp.net/wiki/skyrim:black-briar_manor ) and [ black briar lodge ] ( http://www.uesp.net/wiki/skyrim:black-briar_lodge ) are available for your thieving pleasure . 
  hope that helps !, 
  you do n't use the console , you mean , or do n't intentionally cause them . 
  glitches can happen to anyone . 
  yes . 
  dwarven spectres are actually fairly common in morrowind 's dwemer ruins . 
  that would be nice , if someone wanted to spend the time to code it and make it optional and less intrusive . 
  are there any plans for cascabel hall from [ this book ] ( http://www.uesp.net/wiki/morrowind:the_rear_guard ) ? 
  that sounds like a fun place to take over . 
  i 've always wondered if you 're going to do that since i read that story ( my favorite in-game book in the series ) . 
  is menegur 's son still in charge ? 
  and how do you guys plan to do dwemer ruins , especially blackreach , if at all ? 
  i may just do that . 
  i like to see part of that cockiness as being a sort of defense mechanism against the world around . 
  he 's starting to get a tinge of claustrophobia in the cavern of imperial intrigue , and his response seems to be to defiantly rationalize it away . 
  as for trouble , wait and see !, 
  i doubt i 'll try it . 
  a huge part of things for me is the ability to cheat if desired , find ways to do things you are n't supposed to , and most importantly , mod , things that ( understandably ) wo n't be in an mmo . 
  that type of game just is n't for me . 
   cheating ? 
  ; o. i think you mean ` outwitting the system ' . 
  of course . 
  thanks exactly what i meant ; i have no idea what i was talking about . 
  thanks for that !, 
  and boats . 
  better performance , patches , mods , console use when needed/wanted . 
  i prefer physical disks , but that 's because i dislike steam in general . 
  driving off a cliff will get you that on gilly . 
  tf2 is n't my cup of tea . 
  and i simply dislike third parties involved in something that should be only me and the game i payed money for . 
  i find it intrusive , really . 
  i simply find it intrusive . 
  yes . 
  i have played oblivion , skyrim , and am partway through arena , it has the best atmosphere and world , some of the better mechanics , and is a much better game , than the others . 
  hell , i do n't remember . 
  it or kotor . 
  my little brother got an old xbox and some games off a friend . 
  morrowind was one of them . 
  before long , i was hooked and got the pc goty edition . 
  i play with some frequency . 
  school gets in the way , but i get a fair bit of time . 
  absolutely . 
  bosmer archer/thief , always !, 
  it means a lot of things . 
  it 's my go-to inspiring music . 
  i used the soundtrack as repeating background music at my last birthday party . 
  i love it , and would never spoil it by using it in an alarm clock . 
  it changed the way i look at games , certainly , in that it made them all look worse by comparison . 
  most do n't hold my attention . 
  it also got me into the modding scene , which has been amazing . 
  it had an incomparable depth ( except for dwarf fortress , but that is a * much * different kind of depth ) , and i look for that in games now . 
  it is my favorite game of it 's type . 
  there are others that are also amazing , but different enough to be incomparable . 
  did it ever get continued ? 
  it seemed to drop off the face of the earth suddenly . 
  pain in the arse indeed ... 
  mainly to scout the planet . 
  i have a dres base under construction in kerbin orbit , and i wanted to send something to scout the terrain . 
  the challenge is appealing , and not many people seem to visit it . 
  also , dres is the name of one of the great houses in tes iii : morrowind 's background lore , so that 's cool , too . 
  while we do like the art posted here , please link directly to the artist 's page for it , not an imgur mirror . 
  agreed , i would take steam over limited activations any day . 
  nope !, 
  crew is for return missions and bases . 
  i too do this . 
  can be weak against a khergit army , but placing them on a hill helps . 
  and loot . 
  i love that place . 
  in my current character , the `` holiness '' makes it more appealing !, 
  honestly , i found stealing from many of necrom 's museums to be too easy . 
  to be fair , it is real . 
  yes , certainly . 
  but there are plenty of cases where it is real , and help , via meds or therapy , does make things better .
