  really ? 
  as an american , i never knew that `` tara '' could ever be pronounced `` terra '' . 
  starfire 's npc addition is like mca except it fits with the game . 
  necessities of morrowind . 
  `` this mod adds to the game the need to eat , drink and sleep for your character . 
  your character will also be able to cook various dishes and prepare drinks using various tools and activators , and to rent rooms in the inns for more than a day . '', 
  not my cup of tea , and i 've never run it , but i hear it 's well made , detailed , and quite popular . 
  it does . 
  the curse is n't actually implemented . 
  you . 
  turn this into a creepypasta , now . 
  ever drop by / r/morrowind ? 
  5 ... euros ... lucky & % & * @ . 
  i shelled out $ 250 for that . 
  mysticism . 
  the travel spells are simply invaluable . 
  i collect the soul of every different creature enemy i can . 
  how well does it do turns and hills ? 
  give our thanks to everyone working on this . 
  we really appreciate the time you all put in . 
  yes , i can . 
  he just sends you on the goldenglow job as normal . 
  just goldenglow , as normal . 
  damn , it 's a shame to have you leave . 
  hope you 'll visit once in a while ; we love having you hear , posts or not . 
  maybe i 'll finish up giving you that custom white fur helm flair when i get back from school ... 
  godspeed , you magnificent n'wah . 
  it 's coming . 
  i 'm thinking about the jasmine and julan companion mods making an appearance at some point , and am thinking about how and when to put them in . 
  part 1 [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/kerbalspaceprogram/comments/10n61b/journey_to_duna_a_ksp_cinematic/ ) , i think . 
  a lot was , a lot was n't , though . 
  between the bitter coast , ascadian isles , grazelands , and parts of azura 's coast and the west gash , you had a lot of color . 
  and the wastes were mainly ash grey , not brown . 
  except some sources indicate that the thalmor are a minority party ruling through oppression and purges , not a majority . 
  pretty sure striders were based on [ fleas ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:flea_scanning_electron_micrograph_false_color.jpg ) , but nice find !, 
  that said , the telvanni also accepted all races into their ranks . 
  can confirm , this is the same . 
  hey , whenever i go to the forums , i get this message :, 
  `` the forums/spaceport server is now under maintenance . 
  we are aware of recent problems where both sites were loading slow or not available at all . 
  this problem has been solved . 
  we want to apologize for all the inconveniences this could have caused , and the sites are slowly being restored from backups . 
  the team is commited to work as hard as we can , and the sites will be back as soon as possible . 
  thank you for your understanding . '', 
  needless to say , this is greatly hampering my ability to recreate my account . 
  thanks for this !, 
  you will . 
  you will . 
  that exploit can be used to join hlaalu and either redoran or telvanni . 
  did you install the plugin files in the correct folder as well as the parts ? 
  the tech help thread is for this . 
  deleted . 
  i collect the soul of every unique enemy i can . 
  what pack are those two boosters closest to the plane ? 
  maybe . 
  a main obstacle is finding time and ideas . 
  possible to use rover wheels to move down there ? 
  edit : testing !, 
  tech help thread for this one . 
  rules , folks . 
  nothing like it . 
  i know that quest . 
  i 'm currently working on this . 
  bigger and more detailed , and an absolute pain in the ass . 
  . crafts ? 
  i plan to . 
  real life ( tm ) is currently making a hell of a show , so it may be a while . 
  the project is looking amazing . 
  the possibilities are amazing . 
  maybe soon . 
  downloading . 
  i may well draw some inspiration for a mod of my own here . 
  does n't preclude being genderless . 
  ok , just took a look around ; i love it !, 
  only criticism is that it seems _ too _ cluttered . 
  weapons and expensive books lying around is a tad odd . 
  that said , item placement is well done , and i noticed no obvious errors . 
  some sort of quest to get it would be nice , but that 's just a minor gripe . 
  looking forward to the cave expansion !, 
  [ the rear guard ] ( http://www.uesp.net/wiki/morrowind:the_rear_guard ) . 
  all time favorite . 
  [ not what `` firemoth '' makes me think of . 
  ] ( http://www.uesp.net/wiki/morrowind:fort_firemoth ), 
  it 's not . 
  it 's awesome , but different . 
  tech help thread for this . 
  post there , and we 'll do our best . 
  if you 'd like , i 've been working on getting into that very area . 
  i 'd love to try to put together something for you . 
  so creatures are fine ? 
  modders , we have high expectations of you . 
  regarding slavery , it was legal in morrowind because a special term in the armistice exempted morrowind from imperial law in that regard , as well as in a few others . 
  morrowind had an unusual degree of home rule . 
  too short , too thick . 
  mask seems too big . 
  i 'm not an expert , but i do know that in part because of it 's age , the base code is not very well optimized , so it will be much slower than a modern game with equivalent graphics . 
  that 's not a bad idea ... after this week , when exams are over , i 'll give this a shot . 
  what exactly is incomplete about that ? 
  tech help thread for this , please . 
  really hope they make a pack with the old parts .
