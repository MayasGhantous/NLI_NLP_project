  do as darkonion asks , and we 'll all be very grateful .

  far as i can tell , it 's just called `` dagoth ur '' . 
  they 're called the same thing in arena , too . 
  it usually is allowed . 
  but at some point , a teacher has to make a call between peering under desks and grabbing phones all class and teaching the people who are willing to listen . 
  nice idea !, 
  sucks if you do n't have a cell phone to turn in , though . 
  fair enough . 
  house-building , for me . 
  i 'd love to see the limits and possibilities of that system . 
  probably not a huge thing , but a nice thing , either way . 
  thus challenge . 
  challenge in that you have to land without an orbit . 
  at some point , you will argue . 
  it may be over something big , or something trivial . 
  either way , approach it with the purpose of getting over a problem together , not winning . 
  the point is n't to win , it 's to heal . 
  found out why . 
  `` i do n't want to talk about it . '', 
  is the first and only entry in the greeting 0 section of his dialogue entries . 
  it has no conditions . 
  no piece of dialogue will ever get called before this . 
  down here in the us , some parents seem to view it as a sport . 
  a lot of it probably * is * your gpa and degree . 
  horses and some sort of giant beetle as well . 
  god , that was an awful dbq . 
  [ all the tutorials you need ] ( http://tamriel-rebuilt.org/?p=modding_data/tutorials ) . 
  scroll down to `` dragonsong 's tutorials '' for an amazing interior creation guide , `` making your first room '' . 
  below these , scott fisher 's tutorials include one on npcs you may find useful . 
  or the just mark the mountains , and no one cares to define it further than that . 
  did you install the plugin as well as the part ? 
  tech help thread for this . 
  3/4 threads in there have responses . 
  i would n't say no one looks at it . 
  to anyone having this or similar graphics issue : go to the settings option from the main menu , and locate a slider that says something like `` aerodynamic effects '' . 
  turn it all the way down . 
  this removes re-entry flames and mach effects , but keeps everything from glitching up like this . 
  in mk 's description of the battle of ald ` ruhn , in the oblivion crisis :, 
  `` the armies of oblivion destroy ald ' ruhn , ancestral home of house redoran , even though ancient rituals were used to awaken the dread emperor crab and the whole city literally rose up to fight the invaders . 
  with their warrior house decimated , the dunmer of vvardenfell fall back as daedra move towards a siege of ghost gate . 
  prayers to vivec and the nerevarine go unanswered . '', 
  now unless the emperor crab is the whole city , it implies that the other buildings also rose up , which they could only do if they had once been alive themselves . 
  it 's about 1/3 of the city , in the game , and barring any other sources , i 'm inclined to believe that it either scales with everything , or there 's even more surrounding urban area . 
  it 's huge , really huge , but not * that * huge . 
  because the one we have , / r/moddingmorrowind , is basically dead . 
  it 's a case of a small enough community being spread too thin .

  there 's a wiki for things exactly like this . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.uesp.net/wiki/tribunal:speak_to_the_people ) is probably the page you should look at . 
  i had an idea a while ago when something like this came up . 
  make a mod set in vivec city , in the year one 1e 2920 . 
  factions , quests , etc , but all in that time period in the one city . 
  could be a part of the process . 
  military hard-liners were seen as some of his biggest internal threats , and it 's been thought that the last round of hostility was an attempt to get them behind his regime . 
  if this latest news is true , it 's a signal that the relationship has changed and kim is firmly in charge . 
  you 've pressed the '' ~ '' key ? 
  huh . 
  might see if the controls have it mapped to something else , but i 'm stumped . 
  * airplane , not airship . 
  wait ... 
  i can see , * maybe , * it causing a satellite to go dead . 
  maybe . 
  but how the heck could it cause a satellite to point retrograde , fire its probably nonexistent thrusters , and reenter ? 
  who would believe this ? 
  to assemble a 21-kerbal base in orbit , take it to dres , and assemble it in a manner resembling vivec from tes iii : morrowind . 
  yeah , but now 's bob 's stuck . 
  at times , it 's the only way to reasonably get it . 
  game released 15 years ago without a huge fanbase ? 
  i simply do n't have 300 bucks to throw at a third party on ebay . 
  alternatively , i may not like the business practices of a company , but i may like the product . 
  currently , all that 's left is to launch some connecting modules ( small tanks with docking ports on the ends ) . 
  that said , some modules seem to be experiencing bugs with fuel flow , so we 'll see how it goes at dres . 
  i do n't think japan , at least , will get involved militarily . 
  no one has really forgiven japan for the last war they were in , nor have the japanese done a good job at apologizing . 
  any japanese military action would rile up the korean people , on both sides , against them and the us . 
  this is not what anyone wants to see happen . 
  the was the old order . 
  when luke reformed it , he allowed love , marriage , kids , etc. 
  [ levels of canon . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/star_wars_expanded_universe#official_levels_of_canon ) the novels are c-canon . 
  still canon , as long as nothing overrides them later . 
  i doubt it . 
  eu is a big part of what draws some people in , and there 's no money in overturning such a huge part of it . 
  my guess is that they will expand on a lot of stuff , but minimally disrupt the old . 
  around 8 months ago , i was walking back home from a part-time job , going back to pick up my backpack before i went to my high school . 
  walking right past the driveway , an older man in a thin white robe and skullcap with a simple walking stick and a little blue booklet was walking down the street . 
  if i had to guess , i 'd say he was middle-eastern or indian , perhaps . 
  at first i thought he was just some nut , so i kept my head down and walked a little faster . 
  as i passed him , he reached out and tapped me on the shoulder . 
  he held out his booklet , and inside is written the name and address of a city housing assistance program on the highway behind our neighborhood . 
  it 's not uncommon for people to wander into the neighborhood trying to look for it , as it 's right behind the houses across a dense creekbed , but the place is only accessible from the highway access road with no signs nearby to point at it ( do n't ask me why ) . 
  i point at the place , and start to explain how to get there , but the man tugs on my arm and points at himself . 
  `` no ... english . 
  no english . '', 
  at this point , i 'm already going to be late for the bus , and i know the man will never find it without some help . 
  this is also late summer in texas , and if you know what that means , you just ca n't leave someone like that .
