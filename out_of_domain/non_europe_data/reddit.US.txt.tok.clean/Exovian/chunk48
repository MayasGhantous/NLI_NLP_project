  openmw 's chugging along through development fairly well , i might add , as are tr and several other huge mod projects . 
  there has been real progress toward an api , but until that happens , all the problems you listed are still there , yes . 
  placing items is the basis for everything else !, 
  in addition to my abilities , here 's a much more refined version of a concept i floated the last time this idea came around :, 
  total conversion of , and limited to , vivec city . 
  the mod is set in the year 1e 2920 , the closing year of the four score war and the first era itself . 
  imperial influence is almost unknown , and the stress of 80 years of war is beginning to show . 
  most native factions would be in the mod , as described below :, 
  ** the tribunal temple **, 
  the temple has long been the golden fist protecting morrowind , but the stress of was is creeping its way into the higher ranks , with thoughts of a negotiated end to the war facing fierce persecution . 
  even the ranks of the ordinators are not immune . 
  the recent arrest of a high ranking priest by soldiers of the orders of war and inquisition has sparked outrage from the order of the watch , which views this as an usurpation of their duties . 
  without strong leadership from an increasingly withdrawn archcannon , these internal disputes may soon spill onto the streets ... 
  ** great house telvanni **, 
  long the most recalcitrant of the great houses , telvanni has risen to lead what little dissent has slipped passed the eyes and ears of the ordinators . 
  recently , the conflict has stumbled into the open . 
  after a telvanni agent was imprisoned for making contact with a group of imperial smugglers , the remaining ordinators in the telvanni canton were expelled at spell-point , with the area now patrolled by telvanni mercenaries . 
  the situation is deteriorating rapidly , and it seems only a matter of time until the whole canton is placed under siege . 
  to make matters even more precarious , the profits to be gained in such a lawless environment has attracted the attention of a jealous house hlaalu . 
  ** great house hlaalu **, 
  house hlaalu has gained more than anyone from the trade associated with the war , and can be the only group truly said to have prospered . 
  however , the wiser among hlaalu 's leaders know that this can not last . 
  war has drained morrowind , and many hlaalu have turned to smuggling banned imperial goods in source of new profits . 
  however , the dominance of the black market has drawn the attention of the temple , along with some elements within the house itself , who wish to use the war to wear down hlaalu 's rivals , and carve out a bigger piece of the shrinking scrib pie . 
  ** great house redoran **, 
  house redoran has stood devoutly by the temple for all 80 years of the war , and has paid dearly for it in glass , ebony , gold , and blood . 
  a generation of young mer has been all but lost . 
  the buoyant armigers have been mobilized as guards and police in vivec , but are spread dangerously thin rooting out smugglers , vampires , and daedra worshipers in the sewers , as well as a rampant criminal element that has taken over the lower levels of the foreign quarter , aided and abetted by hlaalu agents . 
  that 's what i have thought out so far . 
  as you can see , the idea is not to introduce a new concept to the games , but to breathe life into a particularly interesting time in history , as well as do justice to the city of vivec and the relationships between the houses , both of which were slightly underwhelming in their original appearances in tes iii . 
  other players should definitely include the morag tong , and possibly the bal molagmer and a hidden clan of vampires . 
  i wonder if this will make it easier to set up hamachi servers . 
  are you running on an administrator account ? 
  this would indeed get my attention . 
  yeah , if your `` heat of the moment '' response is to strip search a bunch of grade 10 kids , you should not be teaching . 
  emma has made some great mods over the years . 
  her constance mod for morrowind is one i still use . 
  no marriage does n't mean no meaningful relationship . 
  that will be the reaction to seeing the judge . 
  i assure you , tr will give us much more than twice as much morrowind . 
  we have a thread , conveniently called the `` tech help thread '' for things exactly like this . 
  please use it . 
  theft . 
  some of the earlier mages guild quests are easy . 
  the cave right next to seyda neen is good , as are some of the others nearby . 
  thanks for posting all of these !, 
  oh , no one will remember by next week . 
  but , 15 is plenty old to be held accountable . 
  this is really good !, 
  he retired . 
  we remember his posts very fondly , though . 
  i do n't think they decay at all . 
  `` cyrodil '' being a member of the race and `` cyrodiil '' being the province ? 
  * sole , not soul , in your first sentence . 
  at least in texas , maybe the whole us , it applies to all school . 
  for instance , a school can consent to you being interviewed by the police at school without parental permission . 
  any plans to add vietnamese ? 
  tech help thread for this . 
  it 's possible that he deliberately does not reveal himself to mortals . 
  the reactions of the princes can be fairly predictable , which would be good in his idea of order . 
  mortals , especially heroes , are not . 
  revealing himself might endanger the order he tries to create . 
  * `` quiet , here comes the guard . 
  best intro sequence to any game i 've ever played . 
  the greatest flaw of oblivion 's was that it put you , immediately , into the main quest . 
  skyrim 's at least gave you a ( mostly ) blank slate . 
  morrowind threw you out the door with some vague directions and some cash , slapped on its shades , and sped off into the sunrise . 
  best places to explore are the bases of people banned for hacking . 
  fun stuff . 
  i can tell you that you install tribunal , then bloodmoon . 
  beyond that , i do not know . 
  we have the tech help thread . 
  in the future , use it . 
  opening the console , clicking on her , and typing `` stopcombat player '' might help . 
  maybe berthing mechanisms ? 
  require a kerbal on eva to fully attach , after which it is as strong as an attachment node ? 
  a ) tech help thread for this . 
  b ) giving us the specs may help . 
  the road circling imperial city is called red ring road . 
  the battle was fought there . 
  [ see all the land here over to the right ? 
  ] ( http://morrowind.nexusmods.com/images/2141265-1339112501.jpg ), 
  that 's tr . 
  by far the best expansion to morrowind , arguably better than tribunal or bloodmoon . 
  it works just fine . 
  some tr meshes will be lower res than the ones the overhaul replaces , but other than that , it 's no issue . 
  you can miss because your hits and damage are actually based on skill levels , rather like older pen-and-paper rpgs . 
  this does tend to make lower levels rather unforgiving , especially if you wander in to the wrong area . 
  changing this would require more than is easily done in a mod , and attempts to change it have been met with mixed results . 
  mind telling us what the seed for that * is * ? 
  please ? 
  ah , my mistake . 
  here 's a typed version for folks who want to paste it in :, 
  sounds like a good server . 
  is there a way to join ? 
  yeah , i pronounced `` pel-lay-gee-ad '', 
  we 're here if you need to talk to folks . 
  keep going !, 
  scores are hidden for one hour . 
  i also like julan .
