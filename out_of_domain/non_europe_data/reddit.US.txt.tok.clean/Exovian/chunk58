  now to get morrowind on it . 
  exovian, 
  skills :, 
  * getting things to orbit, 
  * docking/orbital construction, 
  * [ precise landings ] ( http://i.imgur.com/cnjmisx.png ) on bodies without an atmosphere, 
  * i 've made it to dres , and have the skills to go to other bodies , but most of my flights have focused on mun colonies lately . 
  edit : i also just got a very nice new gaming laptop , so i can try to run missions involving large part counts if needed . 
  in the third paragraph , i think you meant `` garnered '' , not '' [ garnished ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/garnish_%28food%29 ) '' a force of roughly five hundred men . 
  though , es lore being what it is , i can see garnishing happening too . 
  it 's a royal pain sometimes , yes . 
  you know , if you can get some money saved , i bet you could go back to school if a career in physics interests you . 
  i am comfortable with missions one or two . 
  i believe i have commented on this image before , but that is a * fine * ship design . 
  ... this would actually be a fascinating study . 
  how intelligent could you go ? 
  if you go far enough , when does this stop becoming ethical to continue ? 
  they did . 
  so , so many . 
  the [ satyricon ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/satyricon ) is a good place to start . 
  here are [ two ] ( http://www.youswear.com/index.asp?language=latin#.ujbli3_pwwi ) [ other ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/latin_profanity ) places to look . 
  another that i do n't see mentioned : `` gladius '' , the word for sword , was also a slang term for penis . 
  put caesar in a whole new light , i tell you ... 
  openmw is first and foremost a reimplementation of morrowind with a better engine under the hood and enhanced modding capabilities . 
  a combat mod could be made , but that 's not the primary goal . 
  you 're right , but america has something of a history of doing exactly that , [ especially with the japanese ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/japanese_american_internment ) . 
  for us uninformed , what does a `` no authority '' letter say/mean ? 
  thank you !, 
  thanks !, 
  i worked at a daycare last fall ( 16 at the time ) . 
  it was part time , come in , help watch the kids and play games with them . 
  i loved it . 
  sure , they were a pain sometimes , but that 's to be expected . 
  watched my language , never a problem there , ran into a few of the parents , they were fine . 
  never alone with the kids , being a part-time guy and all that . 
  all in all , a great experience and easy money . 
  you know why i did n't go back ? 
  a few of the girls , maybe 4-5 years old , whenever they did n't get what they wanted , would sometimes threaten me with `` i 'll tell mommy you touched me ! '', 
  fuck that . 
  i may love the job , love the people , but one kid convincing one parent would have crippled the career i 'm aiming for , and maybe a lot more . 
  it 's just not worth it . 
  the really horrible part is that i do n't think anyone did . 
  kids are n't stupid - they pick up on biases around them . 
  parents tell kids to say something if a stranger touches them , and it seems it 's usually males who are used as examples . 
  they know people will take them seriously , and so they try it as leverage . 
  they do n't quite comprehend what it means to level that accusation . 
  or , in some cases , they do and do n't care . 
  somehow , that fact that they were russian makes this ten times better . 
  i assume you know that pompeii was destroyed by the eruption of mount vesuvius . 
  when vesuvius erupted , 4-6 meters of ash and pumice buried the town . 
  that plus the enormous heat killed anyone who did n't escape . 
  overnight , the town ceased to exist and was slowly forgotten . 
  being buried in ash shielded the artifacts from air and moisture . 
  these two factors allowed for the preservation . 
  your videos provoke interesting emotions in me . 
  the way little green men and their struggles seem almost as real as our own ... maybe because they are our own , in a way . 
  it was almost like watching * first orbit * when that was made . 
  speaking of * first orbit * , some of your voices in the video sounds like gagarin and korolev talking during that flight . 
  do you know if the mod uses any garbled russian voices ? 
  it almost certainly will , unless wend send something to catch it and fuck up . 
  no , it was ash . 
  the eruption was truly massive . 
  it was a [ plinian erruption ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/plinian_eruption ) ( so named after a witness to this event , actually ) . 
  [ this wikipedia article ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eruption_of_mount_vesuvius_in_79 ) goes into more detail , but here 's a selected description :, 
   '' [ ... ] spewing molten rock and pulverized pumice at the rate of 1.5 million tons per second , ultimately releasing a hundred thousand times the thermal energy released by the hiroshima bombing . '', 
  always one . 
  possibly ; the mods are the people to ask . 
  mgso , modify as desired . 
  bodies ? 
  better bodies is all i know . 
  i have yet to see a hi-res face mod that i like . 
  it 's different with different people . 
  some people ca n't control themselves well , just as i 'm sure some gay guys ca n't . 
  on the other hand , plenty of straight people have wonderful friendships with people of the opposite sex and have no issue keeping it purely friendship . 
  first for this week . 
  second overall , which is how i prefer to list them . 
  wow !, 
  this is the first head mod i 've liked the look of for any race !, 
  nice find . 
  i 've looked at some of his . 
  i 'm thinking about it , but i may just keep everything as it is if nothing is incredibly close , partly because i know some characters by face . 
  do yourself a favor and get bloodmoon . 
  mind posting the . craft ? 
  i have a huge orbital construction project that could greatly benefit from this . 
  noted , and thank you . 
  not necessarily . 
  i try not to bring it up unless asked or if that information is needed to someone planning an event involving food . 
   if there was a way to rapidly cool it from all sides at the same time, 
  space is cold ( at least on the night side of earth . 
  float it in an airlock , open the door ... ? 
  edit : yes , [ it is possible ] ( http://wikipedia.org/wiki/heat_transfer#radiation ) for heat to escape in a vacuum . 
  not , it does not need to be absorbed , though it is one way . 
  [ thermal radiation ] ( http://wikipedia.org/wiki/heat_transfer#radiation ) is the means by which heat dissipates in a vacuum . 
  examples would be the infrared light given off by a warm material , or the glow on a sufficiently hot surface ( molten metal , for instance ) . 
  i can see how that would be the case . 
  honestly , i would love to see this kind of experiment performed ; it could be very interesting . 
  possibly . 
  on the hand , it could have applications with other materials that would be worth exploring . 
  i can see it being worth it if you can come up with a simple enough method . 
  for a serious answer , it looks like something you could put on the inside of a module for experiments , rather like a kerbal version of an [ international standard payload rack ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ispr ) .
