  it 's good when servers have a well-developed nether hub . 
  jobasha is one of my favorite minor characters . 
  i make a point never to rob his store ( high honor given my characters ) and to try to visit whenever i 'm in town . 
  he 's one very cool cat . 
  excellent flight !, 
  that also reminds me : i have been working on some seaplanes , which i could provide as crew-recovery vehicles . 
  thanks !, 
  it was actually based on the [ rutan voyager ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rutan_voyager ) . 
  this s ` wit haunted my nightmares for years . 
  great character . 
  i would n't say real life makes for bad movies . 
  plenty of real space events would make for an excellent movie , more so than many contrived plots . 
  that said , the point of * gravity * was a dramatization , and by all accounts it went very well .

  * i should add that this was modified from art found [ here ] ( http://www.geocities.com/spunk1111/transp.htm#train ) . 
  that 's what i 'm hoping for . 
  i really hope we do n't come out of this having learned nothing , no matter what happens . 
  here 's another , perhaps simpler , method :, 
  suppose pilot a launches a ship to duna . 
  for the sake of simplicity , the duna soi arrival time will be assumed to be in 30 days . 
  one pilot a 's ship is safely on it 's way , the save is uploaded back here , with the uploader stating the time until the ship reaches the duna soi . 
  from here , the save is passed on as normal . 
  pilot b , for instance , may run a moon mission , or a crew transfer , whatever . 
  he/she then uploads the save , again with the time left until pilot a 's ship arrives in the duna system . 
  when it is determined that there is not enough time to run another mission in the time available ( 1 day until arrival , for instance ) , the save is passed back to pilot a or a backup , if pilot a is for any reason unavailable . 
  pilot a then brings the craft down , and work proceeds as normal from then on .

  hmm ? 
  hmmmm ? 
  fuck , i just ruined star wars . 
  actually , that particular fact was not due to a technical problem , rather , it was because of the weight constrains of the n-1 rocket , itself caused by a rivalry between sergei korolyov ( chief designer ) and valentin glushko ( rocket manufacturer ) that prevented larger engines from being made . 
  the planned flight would actually involve two people , one staying in the lok in lunar orbit , and one landing in the lk . 
  the eva transfer actually made a lot of sense in that scenario . 
  serious question : at what point does something like that warrant international intervention ? 
  my money 's on vu . 
  what was his opinion on the russian segment of the station ? 
  how `` divided '' is the station and it 's crew between nationalities ? 
  ere a mod sweeps in , i direct you to rule 2 ( on the sidebar ) : `` no memes , image macros , * or posts not related to ksp * . '', 
  the sidebar has a link to a weekly misc thread for other subjects , and it seems you 've already posted this to / r/space , so i guess that covers it . 
  thanks for the praise , ot . 
  my own comments :, 
  - yes , morrowind is 11 now . 
  i do n't see that that makes a huge difference , the people who want to be here are here , others are not . 
  so it goes . 
  - yeah , life happens . 
  i can run tech help threads and be available , but starting college takes time . 
  classes are there , bike rides to them are there , and i need a break after it 's done . 
  i can not see and do everything . 
  i 'm not worried about the userbase fluctuating , as i said earlier . 
  i just want those who do come here to be welcome and find like-minded fans . 
  with that in mind , here 's a list of things you , as users , can do to help :, 
  * read the rules before posting . 
  i consistently remove multiple tech requests per week , redirecting the owners to the tech help thread . 
  i will , for my part , try to make the rules more simple and accessible . 
  remind posters that that is where their requests go . 
  * going off that , check the weekly thread once in a while . 
  could be you know someones problem and can help . 
  people like you make it happen . 
  * send us modmail if you report something . 
  i sometimes just forget to check the mod queue . 
  * if you have an idea that you would like done , say so . 
  also , be willing to implement it . 
  i ca n't promote everyone with a good idea , but it would be great if the community could implement good ideas . 
  well , there is the issue of the sticky being taken up with tech help . 
  why not both ? 
  yes , the system is messed up , that is apparent . 
  but the bishop chose to abuse it . 
  it 's nutty to realize that there will almost certainly be a time in my life that no living person has ever walked on the moon . 
  you got to see that launch ? 
  you lucky s ` wit . 
  well , it ca n't go to space . 
  it 's basically a biplane with `` floats '' made of girders . 
  i have n't tested the range , but if you land halfway close to ksc ( within ... 100km ? 
  maybe more ? 
  ) , it should be fine . 
  to pilot it , eva a kerbal from the attached lander-can and put him in the middle seat . 
  landing is hard . 
  descend towards the water at a very shallow angle going less that 35m/s . 
  the plane produces tons of lift , so this can take a while . 
  i recommend gliding the last 5km or so to the target . 
  just bring it in nice and easy so nothing breaks . 
  for takeoff , gun the engine to get enough speed in the water . 
  as you gain speed , the front will want to nosedive into the water . 
  lightly pull up to avoid that . 
  when you hit 20 + m/s , pull up more until you 're in the air . 
  do n't hit the engine . 
  if you can squeeze one into the lander-can , it can hold 5 kerbals + pilot . 
  [ . craft file ] ( http://www.mediafire.com/?b7opo7s0uwd583u ), 
  it is . 
  biplanes can get really fun . 
  i 'd like to include this one in the save , just so anyone who wants can go recover their own flight crew . 
  you just earned yourself a subscriber . 
  very nice !,
