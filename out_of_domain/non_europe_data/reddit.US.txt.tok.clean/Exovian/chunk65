  yeah , they 're pretty fucking nuts . 
  use the command `` tfh '' and then mouse over items . 
   remember the spy plane that got shot down in 2001 over china that sparked a diplomatic row ? 
  well , you 're right , i do n't . 
  [ is this what you 're talking about ? 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hainan_island_incident ), 
  i 'll take 38 . 
  the circumnavigator from mission 4 should be easily modified to work very well . 
  where should the landings be performed ? 
  oh , and can we try to avoid 4-5 day turnover , this time around ? 
  should be `` getting stuck in * daggerfall 's * opening level does n't count ... '' imperial prisons were easy . 
  privateer 's hold ? 
  nightmare . 
  oh , and the answer is morrowind . 
  nice mission !, 
  i 'm sure donner is grinning ( is he still in the station ? ), 
  ksp in the background ? 
  bit off topic , but it would be really cool if you actually could have a family with a villager . 
  then select for certain traits when you marry off the kids ... 
  good . 
  use the tech help thread . 
  it 's the big green sticky on top of the main page . 
   japan does n't have the infrastructure to put anything into space . 
  [ actually , they do ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/h-ii_transfer_vehicle ) . 
  very nice !, 
  i love the ssto design as well . 
  i just got 100 + crossbowmen . 
  obviously higher tier rhodoks were the best , but once they have crossbows , they kick ass . 
  i hope these work well . 
  it will be nice when the server i play on updates . 
  where has this been all my life ? 
  thanks !, 
  not in all of texas . 
  i know in austin , at least , the school district itself forbids it ( a possibility mentioned in the article ) . 
  on the seventh day of evening star dronos llervu `` gave '' to me ... seven glass armor pieces ,, 
  six daedra hearts ,, 
  five skooma pipes, 
  three scrolls of icarian flight, 
  two bloody scamps, 
  and a cliff racer in a mushroom tree !, 
  loving the lp so far !, 
  mind saying where you saw that ? 
  please go to the tech help thread , this is exactly what it is for . 
  this seems to be it . 
  you certainly * can * set up a base there , just like you can anywhere else . 
  assuming the 48 hours limits start within 24 hours or so , 42 will definitely fall on a weekend for me , so i can take that . 
  my major incoming assignments are due tomorrow and friday . 
  ideally , i 'd do the mission saturday , though sunday can work too . 
  craft is the lok from bobcat 's soviet pack . 
  wow , i was totally brain-dead when i looked up the sovereignty transfer date . 
  thanks for the links , and keep up the good work . 
  was expecting a fish . 
  i really like it !, 
  i love making structures totally out of trees and mushrooms , but this is a cool mix !, 
  can you give an example of virginians adopting some african practices ? 
  thank you !, 
  it 's interesting how i see some of these myself , actually ... 
  perfect timing too , actually . 
  unless the save is bad for some reason , i 'll go ahead and use this . 
  fargoth is a wood elf from morrowind , not skyrim . 
  he became somewhat infamous for coming off as way too friendly , compounded with the fact that he lives in the tiny town you start in . 
  ok , lost soul corrected !, 
  friend of mine used to use them a lot staying with us ( 4 years or so ago ) . 
  they 're nice if you ca n't read a map worth a damn and carry change . 
  to this day , if `` town lake food mart '' shows up on caller id ... 
  imperial silver is not a recognized uniform . 
  see here for further information : http://www.uesp.net/wiki/morrowind:imperial_armor#armor, 
  / u/tapioca _ sunrise has put together an excellent summary of events [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1sdvyp/one_million_people_chanting_in_unison_todays/cdwx0tk ) , for those who want it . 
  all hail our modding overlords , indeed . 
  are we allowed to land periodically during the flight ? 
  my guess is that they kept 10 % because that was the amount cuba actually had the ability to pay . 
  russia does n't lose any more money , and instead of squeezing a stone , some real trade happens . 
  i hope we do get some . 
  not out of eve 's gravity well , sure , but enough to take off and fly around a bit . 
  each map includes the previous versions , so map 3 version ... 1.5 ? 
  i think , is the one you want . 
  maps 4 , 5 , and 6 are not yet out and will not be for some time . 
  i 've been at a few places where that is , mostly schools . 
  apparently , a magic menu is giving way to much power to the students/users . 
  principle of least privilege taken to an absurd degree . 
  i should clarify :, 
  rocket packs with enough power to overcome the gravity of kerbin and eve . 
  you can . 
  sounds like him , yes . 
  i do n't know why , but i really want a recall on target spell ability from openmw . 
  also , this looks amazing !, 
  especially the snow . 
  thank you for marking this as non-survival !, 
  loved that movie . 
  nice mission !, 
  one question : does that tank have a sr. port on the back , or do we need to send up another one ? 
  there 's a story to be told here . 
  my high school just located the particularly adept kids ( magnet school , so there were always a few ) and let them handle a lot of the tech ( with some supervision ) . 
  it worked rather well , actually . 
  very nice , keep it up !, 
  ok , this is stretching `` tech help '' . 
  i suggest looking [ here ] ( http://www.uesp.net/wiki/morrowind:attributes ) to see how various attributes and skills interact with each other . 
  why are they releasing the date ? 
  i thought there was a very clear policy against that . 
  that works , i guess .
