  be interesting to get started with cryptocurrency . 
  if possible , [ wrangel island ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wrangel_island ) , a small-ish island north of siberia , thought to be the last place mammoths survived . 
  [ here ] ( http://images.nationmaster.com/images/motw/commonwealth/wrangel_island_82.jpg ) is the best topographic map i could find , but better ones may be out there . 
  edit : bonus if you can include tiny herald island , just to the east . 
  i have to say , it looks way too black . 
  like lorkhan chain-smoked brimstone . 
  forgive my ignorance , but how did you get v-1s ? 
  do they appear on a map , or is this a custom server ? 
  please do not lower yourself to ad hominem attacks on other users . 
  while i get that you were trying to make a joke , it did go a hair too far . 
  i have to wonder if offering no words at all actually makes it worse . 
  especialy with young kids , shutting down and pretending nothing happened seems like a great way to burn it into their minds . 
  hell , i 've never owned a gun in my life , and i know that . 
  it 's the top thing that got drilled into my head every one of the few times i 've been around firearms . 
  `` respect this , treat it as if it is always loaded , and never play around with it . '', 
  very interesting survey . 
  one of the main things that made many of the sentences `` unnatural '' is the placement of the words `` finally '' or , less often , `` please '' . 
  for example , `` she finally got a job '' sounds much more natural than `` she got a job finally '' . 
  `` please '' is very odd in a questions about ability , such as `` are you able to stop smoking please ? '' . 
  `` would you please stop smoking ? '', 
  or `` are you able to stop smoking ? '', 
  sound much better . 
  also , `` well '' is drastically overused . 
  in something like `` do you come here often well ? 
  '' , the `` well '' makes no sense in the sentence . 
  the rest of the sentence is absolutely fine . 
  wonderful !, 
  yes , duna aerobraking is a pita . 
  any reason you did n't use nukes for the transfer stages ? 
  and it worked !, 
  much fun , just watched the first one !, 
  it 's nice to see a new player having fun ... and screwing up ... anyway , in case you do n't know : you can right-click to zoom in on your targeting reticule . 
  makes aiming easier at times . 
  yes !, 
  hold `` c '' while looking around . 
  it took me a while to get that one myself . 
  hope you enjoy the game !, 
  yes , the same problem has been happening to me , much more often since the latest patch . 
  do n't know what the issue is , but it works just fine on my win8 64 bit . 
  dagoth ur : `` you are bold . 
  i honor your independence . 
  you are one to teach the gods their limits . 
  i hope the bards will praise the glory of your death in song . '', 
  nice to see the fbi actually doing it 's damn job . 
  from what the article said , it sounds like these scumbags really deserve that 42 + year sentence . 
  [ rendezvous with roche ] ( http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/33693-scenario-rendezvous-with-roche ) , anyone ? 
  i swear , this happens nearly every time someone mentions this game outside of / r/morrowind, 
  a really interesting book for you would be `` two sides of the moon '' by david scott and alexei leonov . 
  scott landed on the moon on apollo 15 , and leonov was the first person to perform a spacewalk . 
  texas here . 
  the schools in my town shut down due to ice ... that started building up right as people started taking kids to school . 
  what is the `` white slavery '' that shows up in the hays code ? 
  why did it deserve special mention ? 
  oh , i know . 
  i simply found a sniper rifle slightly more suitable for my business . 
  you can , possibly . 
  i do n't know about the fort , which is where i used this myself . 
  next week , a german jet , perhaps ? 
  it would be nice to see some opinions on the 262 . 
  funny , my sneaky thieves always wind up like that with alteration , mysticism , and conjuration ( for levitate , intervention/recall , ans command ) . 
  magic is so fun . 
  maybe an altitude handicap . 
  as it is , most bomber complaints ( yer-2s excluded ) are that they do n't carry enough bombs , relative to history . 
  taking 69 , as per our previous messages . 
  also nabbing 66 , unless someone has a truly burning passion to take it . 
  so , to be clear , putting a stock on a handgun makes it a `` short-barreled rifle '' ? 
  ok . might want to make it clear that the drones are to be flown around , not just dropped down . 
  you 'd think `` drone '' would indicate this , but it ca n't hurt to be safe . 
  do you mean rsp save files ? 
  the files are labeled rmp . 
  jill ? 
  who ? 
  all of your game actions do n't need to be canon . 
  they simply ca n't be . 
  to an extreme example : just because i * can * exterminate every living thing on vvardenfell , pile every silver fork in the game along with the province 's skooma supply on the steps of vivec 's palace , and dance naked on top , does n't mean beth can account for the murder of an entirely island by whatever drug-addict nudist the player happens to be in the following games , and make any sense at all . 
  though , to be fair , stranger things have happened . 
  who is ? 
  forgive my ignorance , but the only reference was in the five hundred mighty companions or thereabouts of ysgramor the returned , which did n't seem to say much . 
  well , that 's just bonkers , even coming from the view of someone who typically is for gun control . 
  wow !, 
  my probe got used as a demo !, 
  that page is looking really awesome . 
  good luck , do n't forget the mission flag . 
  for some reason , you now have the brotoro listed in eve orbit , and the eve station is gone completely . 
  also , if you go too fast , that will also do it . 
  though , it does have to be really fast . 
  i know some would be really nice on laythe if the colony gets going . 
  we 'll need some long range transports to carry kerbals to and from an equatorial site , for instance , if we ever want to do crew transfers . 
  otherwise , the equator is the only reliably reachable place . 
  as another note , i think crew transfers and rotations should be a larger chunk of the missions . 
  it seems kind of odd to plop the guys down on duna or laythe and say `` have fun for the rest of eternity ! '', 
  get some manpower for the research bases , and discourage escape at the same time ? 
  i had similar problems with the j.a.w.a. 
  mission . 
  it launched successfully once . 
  that once is the one shown in the mission album . 
  you mean / r/kerbalspaceprogram ? 
  i did , but i must have posted it at the perfect time for it to get buried . 
  oh , and the next monster in the pipeline might be something special for laythe , once a colony gets up . 
  all those evangelists from here are weird cults to a lot of us , too .
