  i think the edge of your vision gets tinged black . 
  sure , the mythic dawn may have been restricted to tamriel . 
  but i find it improbable the a daedric prince would only have a following on one continent . 
  what 's to say there 's not a tsaesci cult parallel to the mythic dawn ? 
  no kidding ... 
  none save the the last . 
  they only needed to have the general plan of conquering mundus ( and these are the tsaesci ) and to do it at the same time , which dagon could easily arrange . 
  start a thread . 
  that 's it 's own worthwhile conversation to have . 
  have you slept lately ? 
  also , have your skills actually leveled up ? 
  if you have the coin , you can pay trainers to help you . 
  also , bear in mind that this is a much slower paced game than the later two . 
  we do n't hate them . 
  in short , people who play the game , ignore the lore , and crowd the subreddit with inane drivel . 
  you do need more houses . 
  villagers will mate until the number of adult villagers reaches 1/3 the number of houses . 
  any remaining children will grow up resulting in a total population somewhat higher that that . 
  i 'm not saying skyrim lacks lore - far from it . 
  i 'm just saying that the subreddit fails to reflect that . 
  the fact that testificates do not know when to * stop breeding ... *, 
  well , it 's proving difficult right now . 
  i 'll try to include one when i release the full album . 
  i 'm glad someone else thinks so . 
  hop on over to [ r/morrowind ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/morrowind/ ) sometime . 
  [ world download ] ( http://www.mediafire.com/?ao98lfohc081f3f ) , for those who want it . 
  edit : the to do list :, 
  - build seaside port area , probably primarily out of birchwood , complete with a statue of rana guarding the harbor . 
  - build companion base on top of nether bedrock ( using a convenient glitch from the prereleases ) and a blaze farm . 
  - build functioning mob/iron golem grinder a ways ofshore . 
  - build snowy pine-based area , also offshore to avoid killing the snow golems . 
  you 're right , of course . 
  however , texture like [ these ] ( http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/0/4881/896281-telvanni_super.jpg ) are hard to get in minecraft . 
  i had to make a choice between poorly attempted imitation of color and proper imitation of construction materials and styles . 
  i chose the later . 
  favorite build : bosmer thief . 
  ( major skills : sneak , security , light armor , marksman , short blade ; minor skills : speechcraft , mercantile , mysticism , athletics , and acrobatics ) . 
  generally , i role play an inveterate kleptomaniac with a thing for emeralds . 
  i decorate my house with emeralds * everywhere * . 
  i 'm also the ultimate nice-guy to the poor , and an ardent abolitionist . 
  in a way , it would be cooler to make it 16x16 . 
  besides , the testificates lag my rig enough as it is . 
  what 's hard to get past is n't the textures , it 's the fact telvanni buildings have organic curves , and minecraft ... does n't . 
  [ mineconics ] ( http://www.mineconics.net/ ) helps a lot with that . 
  first of all , if you have n't already , get the goty edition . 
  it 's worth every penny , and many mods require it . 
  first off , [ julan , ashlander companion ] ( http://lovkullen.net/emma/kateri.htm ) . 
  this it , hands down , the best companion mod i have ever seen . 
  if i could choose one mod to play the game with , it would be this . 
  requires goty . 
  second , [ tamriel rebuilt ] ( http://www.tamriel-rebuilt.org/ ) . 
  it aims to make the mainland as bethesda would have had they done so . 
  they have only done the telvannis region so far , but it is spectacular . 
  if you run a computer that is very low-end at all , stay away too many graphics enhancers . 
  it tried installing morrowind graphics and sound overhaul recently on rather low settings , and it halved my framerate . 
  no joke . 
  finally , always backup your morrowind folder . 
  i can not stress this enough . 
  morrowind 's engine is run on `` locust-powered occultestry '' , at least according to [ learfz ] ( http://www.reddit.com/user/learfz ) , and it crashes over the * strangest * of issues . 
  yeah , that whole door-to-door salesman thing really is n't working for him . 
  sleep paralysis happens every time you sleep ; many people awaken during it with no dreams at all . 
  do n't worry about it . 
  really ? 
  i may have uploaded the wrong one . 
  edit : yes , i did !, 
  let me rectify that ... 
  edit2 : ** fixed **, 
  15 , love classical music . 
  can you provide examples ? 
  huh . 
  i 've never heard of such a thing . 
  he 's also a moderator . 
  tread lightly , 
  at this point , i do n't think it mattered to the empire what weapon the emperor used , only that it wound up inside an aldmeri corpse . 
  t-16 , you heathen !, 
  that 's ... 
  actually a really good idea . 
  you have yourself a fine point there . 
  as it says in the title , wip . 
  or , you can play morrowind , and get both . 
  touch\u00e9 . 
  i think it would be hard to remake daggerfall with changing some core parts of the game , due to how much was randomly generated . 
  but , if you could remake morrowind with today 's tech , you have , hands down , the second best rpg of all time . 
  d&d  morrowind remake  = morrowind . 
  literal . 
  . craft , please ? 
  actually , the first part does , it 's the second that 's incomplete . 
  thank you !, 
  recovering skyrim fans ... got ta love 'em . 
  rape = / = joke material . 
  that 's cool . 
  sometime , i want to see or make a korolev 's cross in ksp . 
  last question is rather impossible for those of us that do n't follow sports . 
  showed my girlfriend [ sermon 14 ] ( http://www.uesp.net/wiki/morrowind:36_lessons_of_vivec,_sermon_14 ) the other day . 
  interesting reaction . 
  let 's take a look at that rocket you got there . 
  first off , you need a parachute on top of that capsule . 
  you 'll have to trust me on this , but come landing , those things are kind of important . 
  also consider adding a decoupler beneath the capsule to make life easier for the ` chute . 
  secondly , no asas ?
