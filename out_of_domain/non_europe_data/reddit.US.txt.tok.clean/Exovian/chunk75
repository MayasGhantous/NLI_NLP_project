  it drained 1 . 
  hits also drained less , but it could be your mods . 
   i 'm not sure what this subreddit 's rules are to linking to them . 
  the rule is that doing so is banned . 
  `` crusader kings ii : the republic '' is dlc for crusader kings ii , not it 's own game . 
  might want to change the references . 
  morrowind , easily . 
  no idea how many hours , but it 's probably something insane . 
  i would prefer so , but i 'm hardly going to jump down the rabbit hole of trying to censor common knowledge . 
  i 'd certainly say not to recommend someone do that . 
  because they cost more . 
  financially , at least , nasa gets a decent deal on soyuz . 
  potential for abuse . 
  you can have `` informed consent '' that is still unethical and coerced , and putting financial motive on a relatively dangerous and permanent operation is a recipe for disaster . 
  you ask how this differs from blood : blood is replenished . 
  your bone marrow constantly makes more . 
  with organs , for the most part , if it 's gone , it 's gone . 
  probably not . 
  awareness = / = safety . 
  take drunk driving , drug use , or even forced prostitution in many cases . 
  people do things they know are unsafe or unethical if the perceived gain ( money , sex , fun , etc ) is enough . 
  money is a very powerful motivator , especially to people in poverty . 
  no matter how aware people are of dangers , the greatest pressure to do something like this will always be on those least able to cope with the consequences . 
  it 's a very interesting question and discussion , but i do n't think it can work . 
  i 'd disagree . 
  both mean the same thing , but `` when it was up '' is a * tad * less asinine . 
  it also avoids directly saying that you did anything , which leaves pouty-face mcexclient to stew in their own culpability ( whether they recognize it or not ) . 
  i would like a mod focusing on the towns/culture of the pigmen , not add anything more . 
  but the idea is very cool . 
  great video !, 
  always nice to see a new one from you . 
  also , what happened to the brd sabre ? 
  it 's not so unreasonable . 
  while in north korea , any money you pay for accommodations , food , souvenirs , etc , most likely ends up in the hands the regime . 
  that government will also inevitably use this as an excuse to show international prestige . 
  if you are opposed to their treatment of citizens , which i think most of us are , refusing to give your money , time , and presence is an entirely reasonable choice to make . 
  the second to last page , with the 1-9 scale , was unclear in some cases . 
  `` how responsible '' the defendant is can be interpreted several ways . 
  as , i believe , is kateri , who made the julan mod for morrowind . 
  amazing mod , too . 
  make a backup . 
  it can mess stuff up or cause your game to slow down . 
  it 's also a pain to remove if it does . 
  could be a bosmer . 
  i 'm disappointed with the battle , honestly . 
  this would be a great chance to introduce some formations and proper strategy instead a sea of melees . 
  hahaha ha ha ha ... 
  damn it . 
  i think a lot of it is the requirements , mentally , of the job . 
  an old shop teacher of mine , who decided to stop pursuing that career , explained that to be effective , you have to be able to ignore that fact that you have a human being laying in front of you , and just treat the whole thing as a machine that needs to be fixed . 
  it 's understandable that , well , assholes have an easier time letting go of empathy . 
  this teacher of mine was an amazing guy , but just was n't cut out for it . 
  i think so , yes . 
  he could have , academically . 
  he did n't think he could handle tuning himself out like he would need to . 
  vivec , in tes iii : morrowind [ `` that is very sad . 
  i presume almalexia killed sotha sil . 
  i thought she might harm me . 
  and i presume she tried to kill you , nerevarine . 
  it is all very sad . 
  but death comes to all mortals -- and we are all mortal now . 
  in time , death will come to me , nerevarine -- perhaps even at your hands . 
  it is futile to deny one 's fate . 
  but , nonetheless , i 'm afraid i find it all very , very sad that it should end this way , something that began in such glory and noble promise . 
  '' ] ( / spoiler ), 
  personally , i prefer first-person in all but vehicle simulations . 
  i 'll use third person to look at myself or around corners , but not having it is n't a huge deal . 
  switching is , of course , ideal . 
  having only third person is a fairly big turn off . 
  no , we ca n't , without asking the person who posted this on / r/minecraft . 
  seeds are randomly made by the minecraft program itself , and there are trillions of possible seeds . 
  i 'd even argue that the problem is n't with the technology , it 's the use . 
  high tier bf 109s definitely fit . 
  if you can avoid the worst of the gunner fire , 3 competently-aimed cannons will make a mess of things . 
  i think op is talking about citizenship , not visas . 
  got one !, 
  there would not have been one . 
  the watergate scandal was so named because the break-ins occured at the [ watergate complex ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/watergate_complex ) . 
  other '' - gate '' sandals were given this name to allude to the watergate scandal .

  here are two old questions that touch on it , and although they do n't address your point about the game 's aristocratic background , you may find them useful :, 
  [ why was chess so popular during the cold war and why has it fallen to the wayside ? 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/1snhea/why_was_chess_so_popular_during_the_cold_war_and/ ), 
  [ why do former ussr countries love chess so much ? 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/1ay1nd/why_do_former_ussr_countries_love_chess_so_much/ ), 
  yes , but turnfights rarely go well . 
  stick to a balance ; it 's tricky at first . 
  going for a 109 k-4 right now . 
  this is far too true ... 
  $ 0 , and i hate to say it , but until germany 's t4/5 get their act together , it 's staying that way . 
  oh , if only my german was better ... 
  seriously , this is great of you . 
  i hope someone can use this . 
  mgso may have the poly count of oblivion , but the result is far , far better than oblivion ever was . 
  well , if it gets the pictures and gets back , it works , however homemade it is . 
  whether it does work remains to be seen . 
  it stands between me and the jets . 
  the mossad was n't allowed . 
  they have a strong history of not giving a damn about niceties like that .
