  sure , you can fly without it , but unless you 're the star-marked child of sal_vager or something , it 's really helpful on your first few flights . 
  now let 's check out the engines and tanks . 
  to start with , you do n't need six rcs tanks on a rocket that size . 
  one will do , two if you really want to be safe . 
  next , you 're putting too much faith in the srbs . 
  sure they pack a punch , but they have no throttle and burn out fast . 
  combine that with the fact that you only have one fuel tank per engine , and my best guess is that you wo n't get past 45,000 m with this design . 
  i hope this has helped , and best of luck to you !, 
  ** edit : ** i built a replica of the rocket based on the picture of the wreck . 
  it flew , but at 3,000 meters up , three of the nine srbs overheated and exploded , which destroyed the other six . 
  at 13,000 meters , the rocket became completely uncontrollable and continued on a ballistic trajectory until 17,000 meters , when the fuel ran out . 
  the later . 
  i 'm ... scared to click this link . 
  awesome . 
  now do it stock . 
  no ... you need oblivion for morroblivion , which is something else entirely . 
  thank you , denizen of the reddit . 
  yes . 
  be warned , it can significantly lower framerate depending on your rig . 
  morrowind , remade in oblivion 's engine , played in oblivion .

  the hell are you doing giving steve ? 
  a rounded nose ? 
  heresy , i say !, 
  i have watched the first few episodes , and i can confirm this is indeed a fantastic production . 
  should probably be side-barred ; it is really helpful as an exploration of the lore , both morrowind related and otherwise . 
  same here . 
  lobsters . 
  no , i live nowhere near . 
  i just had one nightmare about being chased by a 20-foot lobster and being surround by a school of hammerhead sharks that were circling like vultures . 
  now , i find them kind of cute , but for years , they terrified me . 
  i 'm also vegetarian , so i have no clue what they taste like . 
  would you mind telling me what happened to numidium ? 
  i know i brought a copy of it crashing down around my head in morrowind , but i 'm pretty sure that 's unrelated . 
  what mods ? 
  it went `` poof '' in a flash of golden light , whatever that means . 
  might want to rethink your altitude now , bud . 
  think 5-3 m/s . 
   looks modded, 
  ftfy, 
  yes, 
  do want . 
  eternal champion - nord male warrior named talin . 
  this is basically stated in the intro . 
  breton , to better infiltrate the area , female , because uriel septim , and agent because ... `` agent '' . 
  nerevarine - dunmer sorcerer , male , simply to make the more awkward conversations with crassius canon , and sorcerer to be a badass with morrowind 's magic system . 
  also , i like to think he achieved chim , because vivec certainly left plenty of clues . 
  hero of kvatch and dovahkiin - no clue . 
  we have cannons , just not premade . 
  we need this in-game . 
  unless you 're sethbling . 
  thoughts : someone get kirkbride on this asap . 
   but i 'm not a good flier anyway , 
  you 're too modest . 
  what i do : wait until kerbin is right above you in the sky , take off , get a trajectory that will take you far enough from the mun to be in kerbin 's soi , then retro burn . 
  who ? 
  i have read your explanation of love , and it is a * fantastic * piece . 
  what i mean are things like `` vehkship '' , `` digitals '' , and `` c0da '' . 
  it also might provide some clues as to what vivec 's been up to since the trial . 
  also , why is vivec sometimes written as vehk ? 
  is it just a contraction , or more significant ? 
  source ? 
  1st person was better anyway . 
  i see your argument and raise you [ this ] ( http://www.uesp.net/wiki/morrowind:glass ) . 
  their plumes have a magical property allowing them to stay aloft at all times . 
  not even once . 
  to be fair , some bugs are nice . 
  permanent daedra army , anyone ? 
  this . 
  just this . 
  coc `` balmora , south wall cornerclub '', 
  morrowind . 
  go make it . 
  . craft ? 
  my grass is green again !, 
  i do it around 8-10 , but my build is optimized for solsthiem , in a way . 
  my build is a sneaky bosmer archer , so i get my sneak and marksman skills up early . 
  solsthiem 's wide open landscape allows me to nail enemies with my bow at long distance , giving me plenty of time to drop them before they get close . 
  the only downside is that i do n't do so well once caves and barrows come in . 
  agreed . 
  being able to launch without atmosphere and in low gravity would help tremendously . 
  . craft ? 
  julan ashlander companion . 
  best companion mod out there . 
  another issue with the map : if that much of nirn was ocean , the climate would be much more moist , especially in the ashlands of morrowind . 
  needs more nature paintings . 
  * cyrodiil * used to be a jungle . 
  i liked the snow worlds . 
  i wish they made that an option . 
  i know how you feel . 
  just recently , i convinced my girlfriend to buy the game , and she loves it . 
  just today , i started a new character . 
  i can practically feel seyda neen 's mud underfoot and the cold weight of the storeroom key in hand as i walk out of the census office . 
  fargoth is an old friend and [ the wraith 's wedding dowry ] ( http://www.uesp.net/wiki/morrowind:the_wraith%27s_wedding_dowry ) is like a favorite bedtime story . 
  each muddy footstep is a welcome home . 
  need to call you out there : the steel crossbow was made by the imperial legion .

   gay, 
  find a better insult . 
  i second this .
