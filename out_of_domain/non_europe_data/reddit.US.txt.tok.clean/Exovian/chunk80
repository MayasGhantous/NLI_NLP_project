  that 's not a good comparison . 
  soyuz has gone through * many * variations over the years . 
  is there a place that has the plans for this hosted or for sale ? 
  it would be incredibly cool to build something like that . 
  thank you very much !, 
  i should be able to stumble through enough of the german . 
  oh , i remember trying that . 
  nice to see this . 
  and you . 
  i seem to have missed your recent posts . 
  do you have a whackjob-sized tanker to fill that up ? 
  you should totally make a whackjob-tanker . 
  for ... reasons . 
  thank you very much !, 
  seconding this , definitely . 
  they say they do n't , both to look tough at home and to avoid giving terrorist legitimacy . 
  in messy reality , they do all the time , precisely so that things like this can happen . 
  most proposals i 've seen for centifuge-type ships are for much , much larger ships . 
  i would n't think so , given that in the end , you 're still playing minecraft , and ( technically ) selling the use of assets created by mojang . 
  no idea , but you made it to the right thread . 
  * bane, 
  what mod for the propellers ? 
  pickelhaube count ? 
  this entirely ignores the worst facet of the system : planes that are overtiered , such as the 262 , are mostly played by people that want to play that plane enough to make it work , even if they get stomped . 
  this results in planes that are only piloted by much more skilled pilots getting tier far higher than they would if the br was actually based on performance . 
  flair the post , or we ca n't upvote . 
  i actually used the ea support live chat thingy to finally get an account working two weeks ago . 
  if you can find the codes , it might be worth a shot . 
  i get the feeling they 've really stopped caring about the game . 
  i have galactic adventures , you 're right , it 's not worth it without a working connection . 
  in fact , i 'd argue that it may not be worth it * with * one , as getting enough quality adventures to level up is a royal pain in the ass . 
  it may be worth noting that the hammer and sickle appear in a very similar fashion in the [ austrian coat of arms ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coat_of_arms_of_austria ) , with connotations having nothing to do with communism . 
  because i keep doing other things first . 
  hey !, 
  how should we indicate if a word that comes to us is in a different language ? 
  for instance one is a german word that means something entirely difference in english , but the german meaning is the only one that springs to mind . 
  i think the coat of arms is too busy to put on a flag , but standing alone it 's one of the best i 've ever seen . 
  ok , fair amount of guessing here . 
  a lot of that is going to be development costs . 
  storing hydrogen in large quantities can be tricky . 
  also , large-scale distribution infrastructure may not exist . 
  once those issues are hammered out , price per station will go drastically down . 
  have to say , i really prefer the old texture . 
  probably does n't help that '' \u0421\u0443\u043a\u0430 '' is the only russian a good portion of the playerbase knows . 
  brush . 
  squads are always matched based on the highest br plane in the squad . 
  have you tried clicking `` play '' again ? 
  my oblivion steam install starts the launcher twice , but it works fine . 
  which is the single cutest word in the german language . 
  easily my favorite . 
  `` lily , how could you ?! '', 
  how are you going to obtain the patriarchy and papacy titles yourself ? 
  that information would be useful for ... reasons . 
  ok , thanks !, 
  that 's actually really neat looking ; the muted colors work really well together . 
  i 'll definitely be following this series ; it 's just great !, 
  do you anticipate any problems trying to take king-level titles , like the papacy and patriarchy ? 
  that is deliciously evil . 
  love it !, 
  long story short , my current emperor 's grandfather captured a rather young byzantine princess on a raid . 
  he then made her a concubine , set her aside , and married her to his oldest son . 
  she produced a son that inherited her weak claim , which was then pressed during a regency . 
  tech help thread for this . 
  i am totally in for this . 
  how does the teaming work ? 
  i 'm up , once we figure out how teams are chosen . 
  count me in , if possible . 
  tech help thread for this . 
  mostly stuff over on / r/reddit _ space_program . 
  mostly i 'm good at orbital construction and precise dockings/landings like [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/cnjmisx.png ) . 
  i 've landed [ this rover/base ] ( http://imgur.com/a/1hmsu#106 ) on duna and made a [ crewed interplanetary ion-drive craft ] ( http://imgur.com/a/yiy3k#2kxjvvh ) . 
  i 've also done some other things , [ searching on the rsp reddit ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit_space_program/search?q=author%3aexovian&amp;restrict_sr=on ) should give a fair sample , but i 'm up for just about anything . 
  oh boy , now to learn how to use teamspeak . 
  which server are we going to ? 
  and , how do we connect ? 
  given that i was the fourth to join , i guess i 'll need to do this . 
  are you going to be posting the tryouts , or sending via pm ? 
  that begs an interesting question : if i command a mages guild guide to follow me into red mountain , wait for the spell to wear off , then command the heart and use the guide , will it follow me to the guild house that i go to ? 
  thanks for this !, 
  ok , let me know about whatever you come up with . 
  witch on a broom . 
  usually on at least one wing . 
  stupid question time : are you sure your test flights are set to realistic battles difficulty ? 
  universal . 
  minengescho\u00df rounds are amazing !, 
  answering both : default ammunition has an equal number of minengescho\u00df and tracer rounds , universal has more minengescho\u00df . 
  i use 30mm pods . 
  my idea with the plane is that overwhelming firepower is it 's main strength , so i 'm playing to that as much as i can . 
  name of the last one was greatergermania , i believe . 
  you can change both the nose and wing canons to 20s via upgrades . 
  actually , the me-262 is higher . 
  it has * 4 * 30mm cannons . 
  indeed . 
  join the club !, 
  you do n't . 
  to use a rather niche example , i use it to follow small game developers who otherwise have little media exposure . 
  sure , i * can * engage with them , but it 's just as good for being a fly on the wall . 
  germany was my first nation , still the main one i play . 
  i 'd argue that starting with germany may be better long-term , as it forces you to do better . 
  holy hell , that 's good .
