  i 've had the same bug before . 
  i always make a save right before getting to kerbin 's soi now . 
  flair the post so we can upvote . 
  i like that idea . 
  here 's a mix of it with one of mine . 
  `` after accepting bribes to have the next cup relocated to moho , the ksp has decided to send kifa on a one way trip to hard vacuum . '', 
  basically , your idea with living quarters in the base . 
  no need to actually send it to moho . 
  the `` plot '' involved the kifa being imprisoned in a space trophy * for * wanting to host it at moho . 
  it 's a reference to the real drama going on about 2022 being held in qatar . 
  thanks !, 
  i 'm quite used to have old version saves not work , alphas being that . 
  i do n't think it 's officially dead , but i 'm not holding out hope for much more . 
  him and his wife . 
  last i played was a few months ago ; no updates since then . 
  it 's not a bad game , or even unstable , but it is incomplete and i do n't see the pace of things changing at all . 
  there is a thread stickied at the top of the page , labeled `` tech help thread '' . 
  please put this question there . 
  well then * now * what do i do ? 
  trying this now . 
  steal their parents ' credit cards . 
  it 's really not hard . 
  hide on the little islands . 
  worked so far . 
  i love it !, 
  go ahead and send it . 
  i love it !, 
  post this over on / r/kerbalspaceprogram !, 
  ah , the old climb on a wall and shoot everyone routine . 
  i have a lot of fond memories clearing out those filthy slavers . 
  `` stopcombat player '' is another useful command . 
  technically , yes . 
  however , i tried this some years back with a friend 's xbox 360 , and the game was unplayably dark , and the gamma settings just washed everything out . 
  your mileage may vary , but i recommend the pc version . 
  if you happen to have it , the soviet p-63 a-10 given out in an event a while back is great . 
  a south korean soldier killing north koreans at a border post would n't exactly be the north starting it . 
  it looks like they 're trying to do something i really wish they had done a long time ago : forget about making axis nations competitive at high tier 5 , and compensate by giving them some prototypes and paper planes from the late ww2 / early postwar era . 
  which one is that ? 
  i 'm with you , i like fargoth . 
  get off the boat , and he 's nice and gives you great prices with arrille . 
  might want to provide a different picture link ; it 's `` forbidden '' to me . 
  that one works perfectly !, 
  i 'm guessing either porn , or looking at personal e-mail/documents . 
  probably porn , though . 
  she 's made a lot of other good songs as well ; it 's a bit of a shame the 99 luftballons is the only really well known one . 
  [ irgendwie , irgendwo , irgendwann ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3yaovkni38 ) - [ translation ] ( http://lyricstranslate.com/en/irgendwie-irgendwo-irgendwann-anyhow-anywhere-anytime.html#songtranslation ), 
  [ liebe ist ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lohcpzkeqmu ) - this one has subtitles . 
  fixed mooshrooms needing * what * instead of mycelium ? 
  thank you for that !, 
  my german is quite rusty ... 
  [ here ] ( http://german.about.com/library/blmus_nena99luftbe.htm ) is a serviceable english translation of the original german . 
  [ here ] ( http://german.about.com/library/blmus_nena99redb.htm ) is the english version of the song . 
  your best bet might be to simply get a disc set - that 's how i play . 
  it should be fairly simple to move your save files from your steam folder to a disc install . 
  that i know of , steam is the only legal download site . 
  you might try putting steam into offline mode , and that might let you play it while you move . 
  compare the oblivion province mods to tr . 
  the quality is really incomparable . 
  thanks for taking the time to respond to these questions . 
  any idea what tree the do-335 is going to be in ? 
  i 'd disagree that it 's not playable . 
  it is dated , but to me still very enjoyable to play . 
  possibly , but i 'm kind of doubting it . 
  they have more 109s coming in , and the line is already pretty dense . 
  working my way up to it now !, 
  ~ ~ anschlu\u00df eyes ban in place for planetballs , or no ? ~ ~, 
  ok , sorry about that . 
  [ exovian , with julan and shani , outside khuul . 
  none are quite complete , but the answer is careful exploration and shameless kleptomania . 
  your best bet , if you 're not on ironman , is to load as another catholic character , set up an antipope , declare war on the pope , and load as your current character to then press her claim . 
  well , setting up an antipope would start another claim war , which triggers a different condition . 
  that may work . 
  it may also be that women ca n't inherit ; i do n't know . 
  what does the sand do ? 
  hlaalo manor , balmora . 
  pre-dead body in it , that never disappears . 
  bodies can hold an infinite amount of stuff . 
  you will need to pick a lock to get in . 
  the dead guy 's maid is in a second-story bedroom , but she never leaves there and the door is closed by default . 
  she 's no problem to keep . 
  well , your recent community participation has left a fantastic impression on me , so stay strong and keep being awesome !, 
  [ look here ] ( http://mw.modhistory.com/search?searcht=pocket+pals ) . 
  are you sure there were no mods involved ? 
  the sunken shrine of boethiah is probably the only thing approaching that description . 
  by testing it first on the germans . 
  try closing an re-launching the launcher .

  i actually am wrapping this one up . 
  aerobraking guzzy is ... interesting . 
  it still beats the * hell * out of the glass armor in the other games . 
  video was re-uploaded [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poetrlxkhfs ) . 
  one idea that does n't seem to be mentioned as much : our `` technology '' is dependent on massive industrialization and large-scale mobilization of a workforce , which has driven infrastructure and public works . 
  nirn 's primary technology is magic , usually driven by highly advanced wizards . 
  at risk of generalizing , wizards tend to be the opposite .
