  set it out as high as you can get it . 
  the guns are all in the nose , trying to make them converge is a waste . 
  give the d-5 a try , best t2 dogfighter i know of . 
  no , they did n't . 
  the lack of airbrakes does suck , but if you can keep it under 400km/h , it still kicks ass . 
  [ julan ashlander companion ] ( http://forums.bethsoft.com/topic/1487274-relz-julan-ashlander-companion-20-thread-3/ ) . 
  absolutely the best companion mod ever made for morrowind . 
  this is a finely crafted hype train . 
  all craftsdevship is of the highest quality . 
  it is decorated with hype and encircled with bands of hype . 
  it is made from hype . 
  this object is adorned with hanging rings of hype and menaces with spikes of hype . 
  on the item is an image of ksp 0.25 in hype . 
  if you 're in a temperate or colder area , just wait for it to freeze into ice during winter . 
  otherwise , you can channel it from the side , which will permit water to pass . 
  regarding what muffinmanifest said , it 's ok to be bad at this ; we all started out that way . 
  wow . 
  that 's a new one . 
  command & conquer : red alert 3 - uprising, 
  my saturday night was spent getting my character ready for the dead money expansion for fallout : new vegas , mostly by leveling up the science skill . 
  * vivec, 
  how is that ? 
  because it 's still incredibly fun to me . 
  as long as that 's true , i 'll keep playing . 
  probably reinstall . 
  however , if you go to the save folder and copy your save files , you can copy them into the new install just fine . 
  for the future , i recommend making a copy of the stock morrowind folder and keeping it zipped up as a backup . 
  as far as i know , it was invented for fallout . 
  in-game , the world before the great war is the `` old world '' . 
  nice list , but i would suggest [ starfire 's npc additions ] ( http://mw.modhistory.com/download-90-13583 ) instead of morrowind comes alive . 
  it blends in far better with base-game npcs and is nicer on the system , too . 
  depends on what you want . 
  pagans ( or at least norse ) are really fun , and i like the earlier start date . 
  soa did n't impress me as much . 
  ca n't sticky , as we are limited to one , which is taken by the weekly tech help thread . 
  well , you can play as norse , capture a hre princess , take as concubine , and produce an heir with a claim , and take it that way . 
  you might want to look at two previous and similar questions :, 
  [ were there known instances of ` breeding ' slaves for certain traits/purposes during north american slavery ? 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/17tybt/were_there_known_instances_of_breeding_slaves_for/ ), 
  [ did slave breeding farms exist ? 
  and if they did n't exist then why not ? 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/1738vq/did_slave_breeding_farms_exist_and_if_they_didnt/ ), 
  participation was indeed it . 
  plus , it 's harder than you think to make a weekly contentment to set things like that up . 
  nice , maybe more people fly them out now . 
   unless you 're going to roleplay, 
  it 's literally in the genre name ... 
  which many people do . 
  plus , in a game like morrowind , there are so many options that most are going to be used by a minority of players . 
  and morrowind * was * made ( 12 ) years ago . 
  at that point , you 're almost certainly running up against the limits of the game engine . 
  definitely going for whatever can get me the fastest norse reformation . 
  it would be great for my pagan revival campaign to be able to play as the empire of the fylkirate . 
  in the `` later '' parts of the game , if/when the player gathers a large number of people , stable base/s , are there any plans to have government-type options available , like appointing a character to do the micromanaging of a distant base , or have `` vassal '' settlements that pay taxes to you if they like or fear you enough ? 
  with regards to the player party , will they ever get more personality and individualism , or is it planned for them to continually be blank slates/pack mules ? 
  and finally , will we be able to make slaves of captured enemies ? 
  thanks !, 
  thanks for the answer !, 
  i really love the way you 're developing this , both in the direction and thought put into it . 
  done . 
  ca n't be on all the time , but feel free to pm questions . 
  dang it , you beat me to the crosspost !, 
  you can have your marshall research military tech in your capital and your spymaster steal tech from somewhere else ; i usually go for constantinople . 
  i love the sounds you all have made and put together . 
  thanks for posting the video here !, 
  what 's the mod for the clouds ? 
  thanks !, 
  that 's usually what i do in mine on ruhr . 
  surprises the americans every time . 
  i 'd be open to it . 
  better place for that is on the bethesda morrowind modding forum . 
  alternating between warthunder , crusader kings , and reddit , and lost track of time . 
  ca n't say i mind , but i need sleep . 
  so , thanks op ? 
  exovian, 
  central time ( utc-06 :00 ) actually utc-05 :00 now because of dst . 
  yep , exiting november 2 . 
  utc 23:30 - 05:00 , nearly any day . 
  sweden ( duchy of svi\u00fejod ) , magyars ( sorry , do n't know the kingdom that they start in ) , or lithuania . 
  the fylkirate . 
  starting as sigurdr of svi\u00fejod , i conquered sjaelland via subjugation , which also got me naumadal , as they had taken it before . 
  then i did a rapid series of county conquests throughout finland and estonia , as it was a race against time to get enough moral authority before the karlings started converting leaders , which would have left wresting control of the last two holy sites from a suddenly-reunified francia as the only way to reform . 
  i did all of this without forming sweden , so i could have the fylkirate as my primary title , which meant that i was well over the vassal limit . 
  as soon as i hit 50 % moral authority , i reformed , switched my primary title to the fylkirate , and formed the titular kingdom . 
  [ picture of the kingdom ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ekfgntl.jpg ), 
  when you become a republic , do you automatically get a titular duchy title if you 're only a county ? 
  well , that is the idea behind a holy war : your faithless land is an affront to god , and in the name of god , i will bring it under christian * rule . 
  so , if they convert , your religion now owns the land , and your objective is fulfilled . 
  * ( insert chosen religion here ), 
  yes , several religions have missing holy sites . 
  i love some parts of the update , but i have to wonder how it got out of testing . 
  yes . 
  no , it 's available in the earlier start date added by charlemagne . 
  the bf-109 g-2 is my favorite fighter in all of warthunder . 
  go ahead and bring the gunpods , they do n't hurt much at all , and 3x20mm is devastating . 
  generally , the only decal i put on is the witch decal on the wing , sometimes on both . 
  i love them !, 
  thanks for the new desktop !, 
  for a stock solution , make a rover that has one big engine facing forward to burn the tank , and another facing backwards to counter the thrust . 
  blast the tank away .
