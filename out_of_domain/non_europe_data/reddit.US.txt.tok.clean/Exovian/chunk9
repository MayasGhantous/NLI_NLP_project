  * make up your damn mind . 
  i. . . really want to see this done , actually . 
  you do n't like it , do n't read it . 
  a person can do what they want with their own twitter . 
  it 's not their fault if you get obsessed with it . 
  how do you do this ? 
  seed ? 
  what am i looking at ? 
  damn ... 
  s/he loves the reddit alien on their parachute so much that they abort their flights just to see it . 
  i 've tried , but the only difference that makes is on larger craft during launch . 
  kudos to your gf . 
   i would think [ ... ], 
  well there 's your issue . 
  there is always a relevant calvin and hobbes . 
  not in this sense . 
  `` sanctuary '' is a spell effect that reduces your chance of getting hit . 
  100 % sanctuary means he ca n't get hit . 
  armor with 100 % sanctuary means he enchanted his armor with that effect . 
  be an archer . 
  tons of invisibility potions . 
  stupid n'wahs . 
  peanut butter and jelly . 
  thank you , so much , for this . 
  i have been a vegetarian since age 7 , but have always struggled to articulate my reasoning . 
  this says it beautifully . 
  interesting survey , although you should take into account the fact that redditors * tend * to be rather liberal about these things, 
  mind telling us what the photo rating is supposed to indicate ? 
  read '' [ all animals are equal ] ( http://www.animal-rights-library.com/texts-m/singer02.htm ) '' , also by singer . 
  put in that light , infanticide is unethical in the extreme . 
  i do n't think they mean land on kerbol , just get close . 
  but yes , it would be very hard . 
  here 's my approval . 
  that makes sense . 
  thank you for the quick response . 
  is there anything petroleum jelly ca n't do ? 
  what heresy is this , you n'wah ? 
  seriously , though , nice picture . 
  any plans for living pigmen ? 
  sleep paralysis exists to prevent just this type of thing from happening . 
  it is interesting . 
  i would actually be * excited * were it not , you know ... north korea . 
  mom and i were driving back from academy two years ago in december , having just bought a load of thick socks . 
  when we stopped at a light , there was a homeless man sitting with his sign . 
  i gave him two pairs of socks , and the way he smiled , you would have thought he won the fucking lottery or something . 
   just today , i started a new character . 
  i can practically feel seyda neen 's mud underfoot and the cold weight of the storeroom key in hand as i walk out of the census office . 
  fargoth is an old friend and the wraith 's wedding dowry is like a favorite bedtime story . 
   each muddy footstep is a welcome home . 
  me , five days ago . 
  not only * can * you restart , you * must * restart . 
  i 'm doing this now as well . 
  i can confirm that it is difficult , but at the end * you are god * . 
  torching the dren plantation is my rite of passage for every character . 
  then reclaim that glory !, 
  with sunder and keening giving voice to your liberation , rend to shreds the heart of the trickster and free morrowind from the yoke of voryn dagoth ** forever ** !, 
  i pretend that my character is on a journey to achieve chim . 
  singer 's argument in this case is that animals deserve consideration and rights as sentient beings . 
  in several cases he equates babies with animals . 
  as one universal right is that to not get killed , it follows that infanticide is wrong . 
  first , find all 36 sermons ( which vivec basically wrote for the express purpose of helping the nerevarine achieve chim ) , which , as prince-of-plots said , is a * bitch * . 
  then , do all the main quests of both expansions and the base game . 
  along the way , he 'll come across things like [ this ] ( http://www.uesp.net/wiki/morrowind:redoran_or_telvanni_and_hlaalu ) , [ this ] ( http://www.uesp.net/wiki/morrowind:m%27aiq_the_liar ) , or [ this ] ( http://www.uesp.net/wiki/morrowind:mudcrab_merchant ) , and realize `` something 's not right here ... '', 
  after all of this has transpired , and i have had time to think it over , read the sermons , etc , i achieve [ chim ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/np26d/merry_chimmas_rteslore/ ) . 
  that link is a fantastic description of chim , brought to use courtesy of prince-of-plots . 
  that 's the one . 
  your survey seems to leave no options for those of us who view men and women as inherently equal . 
  no matter which options are chosen , one always comes out ahead . 
  i know you have stated that this is to avoid people using that as a cop-out , but there are those of us that view men and women as the same on a base level . 
   all ages, 
   above the age of 18 . 
  please include that last in the title next time . 
  i like your use of that term . 
  i was almost hoping for a success just to get this charade over with . 
  we 're always learning . 
  the n-word . 
  should be obvious . 
  you may have a valid point in some areas , but i would n't say it 's because of the age . 
  i 'm a 15 year old hs student and ( i hope ) i 'm not immature or entitled .
