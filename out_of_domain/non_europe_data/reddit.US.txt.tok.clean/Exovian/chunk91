  your english is damn near flawless . 
  i had no idea you were n't native until the last sentence . 
  til is n't peer reviewed . 
  cities : skylines - what simcity should have been . 
  coming out march 10th , very reasonable price . 
  check the subreddit for more . 
  the tan crew tube is from mks/oks , i think . 
  has n't ever failed for me yet . 
  i can see if failing if you land in a high enough place that the drag does n't slow you down enough . 
  mine was kerbin orbital station . 
  anyone at the office have any dietary restrictions if we wanted to get around to shipping cookies ? 
  we needed something for the kerbals to plant on their travels . 
  the flag is an adaptation of the logo on the / r/reddit _ space_program header , with text removed . 
  it shows every planet and moon in the game ( plus one now-removed easter egg ) . 
  it 's happened . 
  second this , i 'd like to see what folks think . 
  you will come back down . 
  eventually . 
  man , i * really * wish an early build of the game survived to poke at . 
  those are letters , just like a , b , c , and d are to us . 
  basically : miss = unmarried woman , mrs. = married woman . 
  ms. can be used for either and was popularized to avoid the inherent sexism in describing women based on their marital status . 
  now , it 's * usually * considered polite to use only ms. unless you 're certain the woman in question prefers one of the alternatives . 
  that 's a german plane . 
  no guar wars ? 
  i 'm disappointed , / r/morrowind . 
  dagoth ur , vivec , almalexia , etc , are actually classed as creatures by the game , not npcs ( because they really ca n't be represented by any of the 10 races well ) . 
  a result of this is that they have no disposition meter . 
  he is indeed a creature . 
  most pads will have some variation of a [ flame trench ] ( http://www.enjoyspace.com/uploads/editorial_cases/2011/soyouz/els-launchpad.jpg ) . 
  this directs most of the hot gasses away from the pad and the rocket . 
  you could get the daedric letters ayem , seht , and vehk ( almsivi ) . 
  true , but the p-63 ( and -39 ) were used vastly more by the soviets than the americans . 
  hey , he was already dead ... 
  well , if you hollow him out , he ends up the same way . 
  rip european climate . 
  well , i figured the \u00d6sterreich translation was one of the way-too-literal things , but i found it interesting . 
  i really just want to know the technical difference in the words , out of interest . 
  i do n't think the term `` kaisertum '' was adopted in response to the deutsches reich , mostly because the austrian empire was proclaimed way back in 1804 , before the holy roman empire broke up , by francis ii , who was himself holy roman emperor . 
  do you think it would then be accurate to compare kaisertum to the english word `` presidency '' ? 
  obviously referring to an emperor and not a president , but meaning the office or institution of the ruler , and not the physical territory ? 
  can you give an example of how you would like us to do things like this ? 
  not entirely sure what we want to do about this . 
  i 'm up for having it flank the `` reddit '' sigils along with dagoth snoo . 
  let me hit up the other mods . 
  also , you can periodically make copies of your save file and move them to another place . 
  then , if you fuck up , delete your save and move the backup back . 
  i 'm not having any issues . 
  well , to me , morrowind 's was the best questline in the game . 
  massive lore depth is fun . 
  [ picture ] ( http://www.imperial-library.info/content/fall-aldruhn ), 
  that 's definitely not the issue . 
  do we get to start begging you to post here again ? 
  i loved your posts . 
  even if you do fewer , it would be really nice . 
  that definitely seems to have worked . 
  thank you !, 
  edit : yeah , it worked really well . 
  a good reason indeed . 
  good luck !, 
  \u00df is not beta . 
  \u03b2 is beta . 
  \u00df is `` eszett '' , and sounds like an `` s '' when in a word . 
  no , there are no royal families in india anymore . 
  sorry about the grainy quality ; this was taken on a phone right after this guy scared the heck out of me , so i was n't going to get any closer . 
  dad estimated it to be around 7-8 feet . 
  the body was a decent bit thicker that a 12oz soda can ( all we had to compare it to ) . 
  you may be right on the size , i can hardly tell myself . 
  thanks for the id !, 
  thank you !, 
  glad you posted again !, 
  do it !, 
  do you plan to share the save at some point ? 
  you 're basically right . 
  there are plenty of other costs , but the current systems throw away the rocket in the launch . 
  re-using them will save a * ton * of money . 
  i 've had that courtier pop up , but i 've never had them do anything about taking over . 
  ... you going to link anything ? 
  [ this fan work ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1uhcve/report_of_imperial_intelligence_on_the_vigil_of/ ) from / r/teslore suggests one strategy for doing so . 
  we 're you there when it was lower ? 
  it clubbed everything . 
  i might argue that it should n't even be in the game due to having no place . 
  you have to unlock the 163 . 
  i damn sure did n't waste much time flying it . 
  that 's entirely true , and i 've had great matches . 
  it 's just not a plane i have the patience for . 
  too much red , if anything . 
  did n't know vivec was a khajiit . 
  edit : see / u/stinkoman _ 20x6 's reply to this . 
  `` the lord is my shepherd , i lack nothing .

  through the darkest valley ,, 
  i will fear no evil ,,
