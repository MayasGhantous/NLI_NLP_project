  they comfort me . 
  you prepare a table before me, 
  in the presence of my enemies . 
  you anoint my head with oil ;, 
  my cup overflows . 
  surely your goodness and love will follow me, 
  all the days of my life ,, 
  and i will dwell in the house of the lord, 
  forever . '', 
  nice catch , thanks !, 
  do bill , jeb , and bob still have orange iva suits ? 
  porkjet 's second picture almost looks like they do n't . 
  feb 29 , 2012 . 
  not quite , but kind of cool that i got it on feb 29 . 
  still , in the first 10,000 buyers , so that 's neat .

  my favorite lore-bit i 've read here . 
  that does nothing to stop one from just leaving one in and then climbing . 
  shitty tes lore, 
  any idea what [ this one ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ixlyaoa.jpg ) is ? 
  it wo n't be the first time . 
  if i recall , either the .25 or .90 update thread got so many upvotes so quickly that reddit flagged it as spam . 
  wow . 
  50 upvotes/minute for 40 minutes and gold . 
  yeah , and as someone trying to learn the language , it 's a pain in the neck ... 
  hell , i 've taken it as a norse pagan . 
  my idea : get a free temple in your demense , and an adult heir . 
  give heir the fylkirate , convert to catholic , proclaim antipope , win , then have your heir inherit . 
  is this an unmodded game ? 
  yeah , this trailer is definitely fallout in style . 
  it would be fantastic to go with [ this idea ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/kerbalspaceprogram/comments/33hr84/mod_idea_kerbal_salvage_program/ ) that was floated about a week ago . 
  fuck yeah , traffic !, 
  i went ahead and bought a year of the wonderfully-discounted premium time . 
  should have the mig-15 pretty quick , too ... 
  ... you do realize that in the us , a coalition , at least in the political sense , simply is n't something that happens ? 
  it is . 
  and you are right that things could change . 
  as far as an actual regime change in the us , i doubt it will happen in the foreseeable future . 
  the circumstances that have brought about such things in germany , for instance , have n't happened here to nearly the same degree . 
  there 's been one major attempt at revolt , 150 years ago , and it was beaten . 
  also , in addition to logistical issues , it 's nowhere * close * to being bad enough to get millions of people to die for . 
  that leaves peaceful constitutional change , and the biggest change that ( in my mind ) needs to be made , is drastic reform of the role of political parties and the abolition of our current voting system that you touched on . 
  there 's no will for that among most people , plus it would require bodies currently controlled by the two parties here to propose it . 
  barring revolt or reform , all that 's left is leaving , which is really almost as `` american '' as anything . 
  my great grandfather came here in early 1914 because he was sick of living under a kaiser . 
  he came here , integrated , made illegal alcohol during prohibition , and started a successful business . 
  really , a model american . 
  if other countries better match our idea of what we want from a government , it makes sense for us to go and try to do well there . 
  if i may wax poetic for a moment , `` einigkeit und recht und freiheit '' fairly well sums up what we 're taught a government should provide , and right now , germany ( and europe ) seem to be doing a better job of it . 
  you 're right , it definitely would . 
  maybe i 'm too pessimistic , but trying to change the us now really does seem hopeless , especially from within . 
  the only thing i can see helping is actually people leaving and being successful elsewhere . 
  i think having someone 's friend or relative do something like that would do more than anything to convince people that reform is n't a damn communist plot to destroy our values ( yes , too many people actually would believe that ) . 
  honestly , i 'm not sure what the best solution is , and i probably do n't do my best thinking at 3:40 in the morning . 
  i guess the main point of my thoughts is that helping europe lead by example will be the most effective way to change america , if it can be done . 
  and , as well , there 's the more selfish aspect of it : i 'm 18 . 
  i still do n't have my own life figured out , much less my country 's future . 
  if i can get my german up to scratch ( or the language of wherever i decided to go ) , qualify for a visa , and make my adult life in a place that has a government system that i can respect ( slightly ) more , social services that are worth the taxes to support them , and a way for me to earn my keep ? 
  yeah , i 'd go the first chance i got . 
  before i go to bed and forget , thank you for the discussion ; it was rather interesting !, 
  wait until you see the rp boost . 
  it 's not nothing . 
   without the blue flame thingies around it, 
  fuck that , keep the flames ... 
  i probably will have to revoke a fair bit . 
  i 'm really thinking about deliberately triggering successive independence revolts , and using them to imprison all of my kings . 
  then revoke everything , and grant it all anew , it it 's proper place . 
  no , i do n't . 
  i still have medium ca and feudal administration . 
   yes . 
  governments will be moddable . 
  and when moddable i do mean that it is possible to add new ones , script historical governments and change the behavior of them . 
  i may have missed some effects but most of them should now be visible in the government script , such as free_retract_vassalage for muslims , and the allows_matrilineal_marriage for republics . 
  in this script it is also possible to mod the holding types which are allowed for the specific government , the color for the government mapmode and potential/allow triggers . 
  i know it will never be perfect . 
  ca n't help that . 
  i would like to step in and de-fuck it a bit , though . 
  well , your devil-spawn thing ca n't work , as that event only happens to players , and only if they 're of certain religions , pagan not included . 
  you would have to have a demon-child kid yourself and make them an antipope . 
  problem is , they would probably still keep murdering your heirs . 
  not / u/acremanhug , but how about , say , [ berlin ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_berlin ) ? 
  i 'm not surprised ; it 's almost an accident i 've heard of it at all . 
  [ this song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmzf9odyaxq ) got linked on an / r/askhistorians thread , and i loved it . 
  turns out the artist had `` o k\u00f6nig von preu\u00dfen '' as well .

  what mod are the cars from ? 
  how do i reduce the quantity of clouds made by astronomer 's visual pack ? 
  right now , my kerbin is totally covered . 
  well , i 'll take it . 
  no , i 'm not . 
  windows . 
  one other thing to note : if you damage a wing in one attack , focus on the same wing the next go around . 
  bomber are terrible at dealing with asymmetrical damage . 
  well , it would `` work '' given an utterly obscene amount of time . 
  mind explaining how that would do it ? 
  from the way the mod seems to work , it only has its saved components show up in the main save after they 're `` landed '' or recovered , which is hardly useful for something you want to be able to visit . 
  yeah , the issue with the whole thing is that as soon as physics go on rails , the base would just fall with gravity . 
  what mod is that for the ksc additions ? 
  matter of fact , i did .
