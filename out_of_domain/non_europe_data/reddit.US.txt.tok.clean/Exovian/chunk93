  fixed . 
  wow . 
  ca n't say i 've seen an eszett in place of an apostrophe . 
  just did that . 
  damn , the kikka sucks ... 
  there 's a lot of really neat stuff that 's come out of the russian morrowind community . 
  damn shame about the language barrier . 
  i 'll have to take your word for it ; i 'm nowhere close to unlocking it . 
  the ammo load seems really limiting , though . 
  ok , first off , texas is really damn big . 
  some parts are desert , some are not . 
  houston is n't in the desert part . 
  second , yes , this was really unusual , as in , once every several decades unusual . 
  we probably set some records . 
  you have a link to those conversions ? 
  [ magz on the yak jets ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht3bzohhuv8 ), 
  basically , they suck . 
  the nsfw tag here has been reused as a spoiler tag for easter eggs . 
  daedric or equivalent bow . 
  looks like there 's a link at the bottom of op of the [ bethesda forum thread ] ( http://forums.bethsoft.com/topic/1487274-relz-julan-ashlander-companion-20-thread-3/ ) . 
  one things i 'd like to point out : you 'll get a few people recommending morrowind comes alive for more random npcs , but i found [ starfire 's npc additions ] ( http://mw.modhistory.com/download-90-13583 ) much better for that , with far fewer hostile spawns , and lore-friendly names for everyone . 
  one idea i 've thought would be cool is to instead vastly shrink the scale of the game , to something like a zoomed-in city map . 
  maybe do some magic with the calendar to have it use hours instead of days . 
  more like `` thank fuck !, 
  '' , i think . 
  it does , assuming the county culture is irish . 
  i 'm not sure there 's much you can do ; even unmodded , morrowind does not handle alt-tabbing well . 
  i 've read in a few places that the adoption was a move to convince archduke karl ludwig to give him one of his sons as an heir , lest everything pass from the habsburg family . 
  removed . 
  / r/truestl is that way , [ this has been discussed ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/morrowind/comments/33vu82/reminder_rtruestls_over_there_also_tech_help/ ) . 
  well , hong kong * is * part of china . 
  and , while the situation with taiwan is [ rather complicated ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/political_status_of_taiwan ) , both do claim to be china . 
  how are you defining `` destroyed '' ? 
  they ca n't exactly fill it in . 
  oh , it was impacted , though less so . 
  pretty much . 
  a small portion of the town , the strip , avoided being hit by nukes . 
  it was still abandoned for close to 200 years , before mr. house gathered 3 tribes to run the 3 now open casinos and turn it into a tourist hub . 
  correct . 
  well , for a lot of people , there 's trauma from killing someone in combat . 
  perhaps more commonly , they 've had friends killed in a similar manner . 
  basically , you 're asking `` that 's so cool . 
  did you get to kill anyone ? '', 
  yes . 
  the only titles that prevent conversion are religious head titles . 
  pretty sure the way physics are set up makes that almost impossible . 
  i 've seen too much of this subreddit to rule it out . 
  ^ yes , ^ that ^ is ^ a ^ challenge . 
  that video 's always made me imagine a ksp/fallout crossover . 
  am i alone in actually liking this flag ? 
  i think it 's a nicely done mix , and actually looked pretty good in the canton of norway 's flag . 
  [ the battle on the ice ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_on_the_ice ) . 
  that 's what the reference to the livonian order was about . 
  i do n't know . 
  general rule here is that we do n't provide support for pirated installs here , so i removed the post . 
  if you are willing to get a legal copy , you 're in luck : morrowind goty ( meaning it has both expansions , which you 'll need for a lot of mods ) is 50 % off on steam for the next day or so : http://store.steampowered.com/app/22320/, 
  plus , i know mods work for that . 
  plus , he 's wearing indoril armor from that point forward . 
  the stripes are too dominant , i think . 
  looks like an elongated cross between bremen and ohio . 
  harder to coordinate searches across international borders . 
  also , if there was the possibility that they could receive the death penalty , canada ca n't extradite them , though i 'm not sure that 's relevant here . 
  it looks really nice . 
  can we give the british ensigns a pass ? 
  they 're pretty good . 
  that 's why you raid them first . 
  if you ca n't hit at level 30 , you fucked up somewhere . 
  badly . 
  adopting feudalism should have no impact on raiding . 
  did you have any mercenaries in that group of soldiers ? 
  no , it 's 4.3 like the one in the tree . 
  hey , at least they 're spamming something good . 
  * russian federation, 
  it 's not the first jet i unlocked ( 3rd ) , but it is the first one that i found tolerable to fly . 
  it is actually a good starter jet . 
  i ca n't say anything about the other countries , as i 've only unlocked jets in the german tree ( almost there with the soviets now , though ) . 
  first was the me-163 , which is bad for all the reasons you said and then some : low fuel , guns have terrible properties for top-tier jet combat , actually really easy to break wings , etc. 
  nest was the he-162 , which i got right before it was nerfed , so that did n't go well , though i 've heard it 's been fixed . 
  i like the ho for a few reasons . 
  first , under a certain speed , 520 stock , 550 fully upgraded , i think , you can pull some amazing turns , even out-turning bearcats . 
  they 're decent energy fighters , and the cannons are fantastic , especially with belt unlocks . 
  that is neither a narwhal nor a swallow . 
  ~ ~ now we just need one for vvardenfell . ~ ~, 
  [ nevermind , here we go . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/citiesskylines/comments/2z42et/i_made_a_map_of_vvardenfell_from_morrowind_enjoy/ ), 
  oh , they had a ton of german help . 
  not as high-profile as von braun , but the r-series of rockets started with clones of the v-2 , just like our program , as well as scientists they captured . 
  if i recall , it 's basically a blown-up version of what the small decoupler used to look like . 
  [ his deviantart page ] ( http://lelek1980.deviantart.com/ ), 
  please try to link to the artist 's page next time . 
  it 's good to give them recognition and views . 
  honestly , i do n't think they would be `` turned over '' . 
  if the european states continued to recognize the roc , they would have reached an agreement to continue holding them until the roc was in a position to defend them ( practically indefinitely ) . 
  in fact , portugal was under no treaty obligations to return macau , and the roc ca n't force the issue . 
  as it stood , the defense of the islands would be a huge military liability to the roc , and the prc could have easily taken them if they were turned over . 
  might be helpful to op as well , but does anyone know of a mod that adds much larger structural panels ? 
  i ca n't answer most of this ( acc student ) , but i do live in one of the college houses co-ops !, 
  either pm me or just post here , and i can answer any questions you have about it . 
  ok , thoughts :, 
  aesthetically , it 's great .
