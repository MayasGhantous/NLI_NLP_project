  british and brazilian invaders arrive as theocracies for some reason . 
  [ looks like you 're right . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2r7qqk5e7fu ), 
  recall/intervention on target , if that counts . 
  i 'll go ahead and suggest the do-335 for next week . 
  the latter . 
  cast it at an npc , and they teleport . 
  to answer your first question , at no point did the wall enter western territory . 
  as shown in [ this map ] ( https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:ddr_verwaltungsbezirke.svg ) , west berlin was actually smack in the middle of east germany , due do the allies having separate partitions for berlin and the rest of germany . 
  the wall was usually set back a few meters into eastern territory , so the western allies could do nothing about it . 
  it did hurt them economically , massively so , in fact . 
  [ this section of the article on the wall ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/berlin_wall#erection_of_the_inner_german_border ) , specifically the `` brain drain '' part , explains it , but in short , ~ 20 % of east germany 's population fled to the west , and those who left were disproportionately well-educated and skilled individuals . 
  throughout the cold war , the eastern bloc imposed strict restrictions on travel , sometimes even within individual countries . 
  if you could take a foreign vacation at all , it would be to countries with similar regimes . 
  going to western europe was simply not possible . 
  really looking forward to this aar !, 
  i just got into vic2 recently , and good aars like this are what did it . 
  can you elaborate on what makes republics more fun in eu4 ? 
  tl : dr for anyone who does n't want to go digging through / u/mac _ question 's link : one of the rockets in the picture is a mock-up . 
  another excellent entry !, 
  what are your thoughts on incorporating various colonies as states ? 
  are you going to rush it , or does it seem out of character ? 
  welcome to children of odin !, 
  i 'm going to be starting off as jarl sigurdr ring of svi\u00fejod . 
  the goals for the crusader kings 2 portion of this campaign are , in order : the reformation of the germanic religion , the formation of the empire of the fylkirate , and the reformation of all the other pagan faiths . 
  i may also save some zoroastrians to allow them to restore persia , ditto for jews/israel . 
  either way , by the time we 're done , christianity and islam should be wiped from the face of the known world . 
  this is the first long-term aar i 've done , and i hope to be able to continue this all the way to stellaris . 
  if you have any suggestions for improvements , i 'd love to hear them . 
  thank you , and enjoy !, 
  there is not one in morrowind . 
  i 'll try to deliver . 
  i freely admit the starting part is very formulaic , but that should ease up after reforming and taking care of some early threats to the plans . 
  there are some fairly wild ideas in the works once i make sure none of the pagan faiths are on the brink of extinction . 
  i 'm well aware . 
  / u/ecleptomania described the process to create an empire . 
  thanks for posting this , it completely skipped my mind !, 
  the e-mail address works . 
  . su , the domain for the soviet union , has actually been kept up due to pressure from the russian government . 
  for those who do n't get it : \u0420 . \u0423 . \u0411\u0438\u0430\u0441 & \u0421 . \u0414\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0442\u0441 transliterates letter for letter into r. u. 
  bias and s. dokumints . 
  i live in a student co-op in a very liberal city , so as you can imagine , the number of sanders supporters is rather high . 
  i 've seen none of the stereotypical `` bernie bros '' that people keep going on about . 
  most of us are entirely aware that we 're going to be voting for clinton in the general , simply because she beats the * hell * out of any republican candidate , trump especially , though being in a red state , it 's unlikely it will matter in the end . 
  ... you know what , the rule 34 on this is entirely your responsibility . 
  you got yourself into this , you monster . 
  that 's basically exactly what it is . 
  it can work incredibly well ; for instance , the student housing co-op that i live in has been around for over 50 years , and we 've managed to not only keep it going over several generations of inhabitants , but become very stable and successful . 
  we still own and run the house my father lived in back in the 70 's . 
  which was driven primarily by missile technology . 
  he actually went through [ some effort ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wernher_von_braun#surrender_to_the_americans ) to surrender to the us . 
  it 's what yuri gagarin said upon the liftoff of vostok 1 . 
  welcome to part 2 of children of odin !, 
  part 1 may be found here : http://imgur.com/a/1ogvx, 
  this installment was originally going to be the life of rangarr lo\u00f0brok , but it became far too big , so it 's being split up . 
  as before , we 're currently working toward reformation , and ensuring the immediate survival of the pagan faiths . 
  the zunists make this considerably more difficult than pre-charlemange , as true to form , they 're getting converted by islamic powers . 
  in addition , we waste some time screwing around the mediterranean . 
  i 'm still open to suggestions on how to make this more interesting , and i 'm aware this episode was mostly scrambling around trying to get the basics in order . 
  i 'm sorry i did n't see this until now !, 
  basically , you have to set up a ruler of that religion to fulfill the required conditions . 
  they can be vassals . 
  i 've only seen rulers king-rank and above do it , though i do n't think that 's needed for the ai . 
  not sure . 
  i can revoke lithuania itself , and it says the rest of my vassals wo n't care because it 's romuva . 
  i just ca n't retract anyone from it . 
   primarily because it is my only aar i have done so far . 
  you know , in addition to being awesome . 
  only one i 've done ( an just started ) is children of odin . 
  i figured out a plan , then started playing and took screenshots . 
  i think of captions as i play . 
  part 3 , in which we say goodbye to the south , become very involved in lithuanian politics , and finish the story of ragnarr . 
  i 'm always looking for ways to make these stories more engaging . 
  do you want them longer ( difficult ) , shorter , or with more/less descriptions and details ? 
  tell me !, 
  it 's the direct vassals that i want to retract . 
  none of them show up on the menu . 
   english argentina, 
  the restriction only affects the capital of the republic . 
  loving this so far . 
  nice work on this entry , and i ca n't wait to hear more about the modding involved . 
  think i 'll go for this when i take the fylkirate to space : http://kaisersly.github.io/stellaris_race_maker/?version=1&amp;ethoses=9,15&amp;government=1&amp;traits=7, 
  it would take a lot to accomplish that , and i 'm not sure how it could play out . 
  given how soon the west plunged into division and heresy after leo ix severed ties with the true church , it seems unlikely for the roman power structure to remain in place for long . 
  i think the best chance he could get would be a suitably weak `` holy roman emperor '' to come along , and try to use him to unite the secular princes and prop up the roman sect in return for political gain . 
  that might salvage enough of their respect to prevent the slide into anarchy that in otl occurred in the 1100s . 
  best case scenario for the romans : larger `` catholic '' minorities in southern iberia , and perhaps unified basque and occitan states holding the pyrenees . 
  the british isles might not have fallen to the outbreak of the pelagian heresy . 
  maybe , just * maybe * they could have out competed orthodoxy in scandinavia and iceland , but i doubt it . 
  welcome back !, 
  this entry 's a little shorter than usual , but it was either end it there or go on far too long . 
  in this chapter , the first of the remaining pagan religions , romuva , is reformed !, 
  meanwhile , fylkir bj\u00f6rn meets with his go\u00f0i to discuss their future in the empire ... 
  yes . 
  suomensuko , tengri , slavic , zunist , and west african . 
  it 's going to take a while . 
  i ca n't ( ca n't hand kingdoms to vassal priests ) . 
  i may wind up doing it with a console command anyway , though , for flavor 's sake . 
  part of it . 
  also , as stated in the title , this is going to be a grand campaign ( ck2 -  hopefully stellaris ) .
