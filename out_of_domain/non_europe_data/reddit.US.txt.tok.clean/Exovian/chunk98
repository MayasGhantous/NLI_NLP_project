  by the end of the ck2 portion , i 'll probably be just about the most powerful nation in the world . 
  to avoid the later sections becoming boring , i 'm going to deliberately be setting up other nations and religions in order to make the world interesting . 
  i also plan to roleplay some syncretism between the norse and romuva , especially in the eu4/vic2 segments . 
  / u/daisotocronal described the process . 
  i do n't actually hold the empire of scandinavia at all . 
  nope , a while ago paradox really nerfed the ability to create big theocracies for some reason . 
  you are correct . 
  no campaigning and his name was first on the ballot . 
  how ? 
  i wonder if the save could be converted to vic2 nwo mod . 
  perhaps an unreasonable hope . 
  you 've made the best aar i 've ever read , and this was an excellent conclusion . 
  regent - someone who runs things for an incapable ruler . 
  reagent - a substance or mixture for use in chemical reactions . 
  can you elaborate as to why they would want this ? 
  today , we expand across the sea , stabilize lithuania , and make a very hard decision ... 
  this segment was longer that the past ones . 
  700 years is a long time , and i have 4 games to play through after this one , so i 'm going to try this format of longer installments so we actually get through this at some point . 
  yep !, 
  picked him up in [ part 2 ] ( http://imgur.com/a/q9nf3 ) . 
  i 'm trying to save the pagan religions , and they get wiped out if they stay in persia . 
  vic2 : 137, 
  m&b warband : no idea , not on steam . 
  a lot . 
  i 'd play that . 
  western europe in this case = not ex-communist . 
  i 'll miss that username . 
  it was nice coming across you flying out the c-3 and kicking ass . 
  the uk has never been in the eurozone ; it still uses the pound . 
  this post was caught by the spam filter . 
  i 've re-allowed it ; not sure why it got removed . 
  i took some inspiration from cuba and puerto rico . 
  the blue stripe is intended to represent the colorado river , as well as break up the red and provide a place for the lone star , which i tried in both white and gold . 
  i also tried it in both 1:2 and 2:3 ratio . 
  in game . 
  each tribe has a banner ; i took the symbols and made them to the best of my abilities with steel rods and an acetylene torch . 
  banners : [ ahemmusa ] ( http://www.uesp.net/wiki/file:mw-banner-ahemmusa_tribal_flag.png ) [ erabenimsun ] ( http://www.uesp.net/wiki/file:mw-banner-erabenimsun_tribal_flag.png ) [ urshilaku ] ( http://www.uesp.net/wiki/file:mw-banner-urshilaku_tribal_flag.png ) [ zainab ] ( http://www.uesp.net/wiki/file:mw-banner-zainab_tribal_flag.png ), 
  thank you very much !, 
  it 's worth picking up on sale . 
  this particular playthrough relies on charlemange as well , though . 
  it almost certainly is . 
  glad to see the name back !, 
  that 's a shame . 
  thanks for the response !, 
  ... it 's pretty awesome , yeah . 
  i 'd be glad to have the flairs looked over . 
  they were my first big project when i became a moderator , and they could definitely have been done better . 
  personally , i do n't think it would be dangerous for them to realize that ; it should be understood . 
  1 ) 20 , formerly a student studying history/politics , as well as taking german classes , then went to community college to study welding for a year . 
  now taking an off year to figure out what i want , just got my lifeguard certification !, 
  2 ) ranger 's apprentice/brotherband series by john flanagan ( bit young-adult-y , but fun ) . 
  any star wars novel . 
  two sides of the moon : our story of the cold war space race by alexei leonov ( cosmonaut , first person to perform a spacewalk ) and david scott ( apollo 15 commander ) . 
  i love space stuff , so the martian was fantastic . 
  3 ) varied . 
  folk/protest music ( pete seeger , woody guthrie , billy bragg , phil ochs ) . 
  old german songs , like * [ die gedanken sind frei ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hym3kghuuic ) * , * [ schwabenkreig ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmzf9odyaxq ) * , and [ o k\u00f6nig von preu\u00dfen ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3d0r-pkajy ) are some of my favorites . 
  nena and silbermond ( german rock group ) are also good . 
  speaking of rock , joan jett 's been growing on me . 
  the most recent artist i 've started listening to is ladyhawke , a singer from new zealand . 
  4 ) not sure ; i do n't watch many . 
  * apollo 13 * is an old favorite . 
  the star wars original trilogy is great . 
  beyond that , i just ca n't say . 
  connection to morrowind : it was the first real rpg i ever played , back when my brother and i got an old xbox and a bunch of games from a friend of his . 
  i got hooked , got the pc version , started modding , and have been here ever since . 
  how did you make the circle ? 
  i have trouble doing it . 
  / r/askhistorians would be the correct place for this , but yours is such an edge question i 'm not sure they 'd have a specific answer . 
  that 's a little odd , this would definitely be more their area . 
  i 'll go ahead and give you my thoughts on the question :, 
  the expeditions that actually `` discovered '' the new world were either small scale settling/fishing outside of strong governments ( vikings ) or organized and supported by european powers , which clears up the position of the people involved . 
  there 's really not a useful precedent for a private commoner discovering a continent . 
  i think your best bet for a helpful answer would be to ask about any policies countries had in place at that time , or developed after the fact , to deal with land claimed or discovered by their citizens . 
  it may have been a factor later in the age of exploration , but it 's also possible that history simply happened in a way that your question does n't have a solid answer at all . 
  can you take the county of venice and usurp it ? 
  what map is this ? 
  you 're well on your way to selling another hoi game to me . 
  looking forward to the next installment , as always !, 
  i was one of them . 
  i have n't gotten a chance to play it , as i 'm currently hung up on the ck2 portion of a grand campaign . 
  you and / u/kaiservonikapoc have been great inspiration for that as well . 
  paderborn ( in braunschweig ) was probably the site of the saxon [ irminsul ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/irminsul ) destroyed by charlemagne . 
  zeeland is more of a stretch . 
  it was the center of worship for [ nehalennia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nehalennia ) , a possibly germanic or celtic goddess , around 200 bc - 300 ad . 
  the other reasoning for it , as well as paderborn , is gameplay purposes . 
  if all the holy sites were in scandinavia , reforming germanic paganism would be trivially easy . 
  this way , you have a base of 3 , which a reasonably experienced player can work with , and as you reclaim farther and farther historical reaches of the religion , you get progressively more ma and holy sites . 
  vic 2 is great . 
  / u/icelandbestland already gave you the important parts . 
  all expansions are basically needed . 
  the only thing i can say is keep the wiki handy and research problems as they happen ; that worked best for me . 
  even today , the falklands have a total population of under 3000 . 
  argentina deployed more than 4 times that number of soldiers to the islands during the war , so they certainly had the ability to pacify it . 
  add to that the limited equipment , and the fact that a minority of islanders would participate in active resistance , and it 's unlikely it could have worked . 
  i miss this series . 
  hope you come back to it , it 's fantastic . 
  wonderful finish !, 
  well , given lbj , it * is * somewhat reasonable ... 
  welcome back !,
