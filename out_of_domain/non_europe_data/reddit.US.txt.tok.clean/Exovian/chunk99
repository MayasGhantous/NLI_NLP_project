  i 've been on a bit of a break ( i 'm employed now ! ), 
  so i 'll be getting back into this . 
  as always , if there 's anything i can do or change to make this more engaging , tell me !, 
  in this chapter , we face the last obstacles between the slavs and reformation . 
  three down , four to go !, 
  that 's one of the goals , yes . 
  this is a grand campaign , meaning i intend to use converters to play this game all the way through hearts of iron , so i 'm using the ck2 portion to reform all the pagan faiths , wipe out christianity and islam , to the extent possible , and set up as interesting a world as possible for the conversion to eu4 . 
  i 'm going to spin of most of the world as independent realms to avoid being ludicrously op in the later games , though i 'm keeping lithuania as a vassal theocracy held by the romuva high priest , and i plan to roleplay some syncretism between romuva and germanic paganism as time goes on . 
  it 's the same in the us . 
  not sure . 
  i 'm leaning towards setting the jews up with israel , just for the variety . 
  persia has afghanistan ( zunist homeland ) in it , so i 'm not sure about it , but maybe . 
  they would certainly help with making an interesting world for the conversions . 
  what japanese stuff is this ? 
  i 've heard nothing about it . 
  hawaii . 
  it was the very first nation i tried to play vic2 as , before i decided to learn the game as new zealand . 
  it went ... poorly , but i 'd love to see someone else try it .

  honestly , i think the proposals all look fairly bad , though i may just be a sucker for the british ensigns . 
  the mk108 guns on the 163 are just bad , practice or not . 
  sure , the minengescho\u00df shells wreck whatever they hit , but the muzzle velocity is awful . 
  love the new flair !, 
  also , would n't '' \u2c09\u2c02\u2c00\u2c0a\u2c0e\u2c11 '' ( ivaylo ) make more sense than `` bardovka '' as the first word , given that `` bardovka '' apparently already means something like lettuce or radish in bulgarian ? 
  as it is , it would seem to basically say `` lettuce , by the grace of god , king of the cabbages '' . 
  no , because you 'd delete half the information for each character . 
  at best , you 'd get a bunch of nonsense . 
  yes , i have . 
  it works for a lot of places , and i 've tried it for jan mayen . 
  but it lacks a lot of detail in that area , and produces a bad map . 
  the ones i 've found in the workshop have similar issues . 
  [ still there ] ( http://mwmap.uesp.net/ ), 
  what 's that ? 
  it 's worth it . 
  yes . 
  i one time had a 3 boat stack stagger into uppland with ~ 1200 gold . 
  you 're reading it wrong . 
  conclave is needed to use late feudal or imperial administration to unlock it . 
  by the looks of it , you need to a ) not have full council authority , and b ) not have any elective succession , which apparently tanistry counts as . 
  oh , right . 
  are you perhaps failing the need for no vassal to have a negative opinion of you ? 
  i hesitate to actually call it a redesign , as so little was changed . 
  the red was altered to match the shade of red on the [ coat of arms ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arms_of_canada#/media/file:coat_of_arms_of_canada.svg ) , and the gold veins on the leaves were added , as seen on both the arms and the [ royal standard ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/royal_standards_of_canada#sovereign.27s_standard ) . 
  personally , i think the small changes look rather nice . 
  canada 's flag always seemed a little bland , but at the same time , nearly impossible to improve upon , so i 'm quite happy with how this turned out . 
  the maple leaf is an overlay in flagmaker , which i used to make this . 
  the veins i drew myself . 
  [ slightly altered ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mn78kpi.png ), 
  your post got flagged by the spam filter . 
  not sure why , but i fixed it . 
  the water pipe thing could actually have real gameplay effects ( for example , ruptured water/heating pipes could be a major drain on resources until they get sealed ) . 
  here are some better pictures :, 
  also , video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmod2jwdtus, 
  you must be new here . 
  faithful as always , commander . 
  praise the lord !, 
  i 'm quite fond of [ brutality ] ( http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/11657/ ? ) . 
  might be worth looking into . 
  looks fantastic !, 
  what mods did you use for it ? 
  i believe the orange tank was supposed to detach from the cockpit and float free from the cargo back . 
  instead , the port was place backwards , and ... undocked the cockpit . 
  meet them , but not do their quests . 
  well , it does take longer . 
  personally , i like that to a limited extent , because it gets you to experience more encounters and locations , instead of fast-traveling everywhere by level 30 . 
  if you want to try a survival playthrough , there are a few mods i recommend :, 
  [ journey ] ( http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/12685/ ? ), 
  allows you to travel between settlements that are connected by supply lines , as well as to the home or destination of any one of your provisioners you come across in the wastes . 
  sensible , and gives a real reason to set up settlements . 
  [ survival options ] ( http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/14650/ ? ), 
  - useful because some of the survival restrictions are harsh to the point of not making sense ( to me , at least ) . 
  also , sometimes you just need the console to escape the world geometry . 
  [ give me that bottle ] ( http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/13193/ ? ), 
  gives you the bottles/cans whenever you drink a beverage ; they no longer vanish into the ether , and can be filled with water to drink . 
  should have been in the game to begin with . 
  i have a backlog of entries now , so hopefully i 'll be able to get the next two out in fairly short order . 
  today 's mostly a slow entry , with the exception of a great holy war at the end . 
  unfortunately , i was so busy trying to beat the catholic holy orders that i forgot to take many screenshots . 
  soon , though , we 'll embark on our greatest expansion yet !,
