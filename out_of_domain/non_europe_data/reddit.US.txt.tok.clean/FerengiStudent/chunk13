  you are the bug !, 
  there is simply no content or gear in this game that requires anything above a t5 ship with some easy to get mission gear . 
  if you feel compelled to complete spec point trees , that is on you for being a completionist , not cryptic/pwe for making a grindy game . 
  grindy games are games that require you to hit x to do x. 
  what in this game requires you to have a fully specced toon ? 
  nothing . 
  i am seeing a lot of whining from people who obviously have no idea what an actual grindy game looks like . 
  it would be nice if you all could stop acting entitled to what was an obvious oversight in how the doff mission rewards were laid out . 
  look at eve . 
  eve has over 10 years , in real time , of skill training missions . 
  why do n't you go over to / r/eve and say you are entitled to those quickly as well ? 
  i 'm sure they would get a good laugh . 
  that server sometime in the mid 1990 's was wedged into the back of a closet and left on . 
  it was n't even a proper server , it was a vaio sony consumer case with a 3 gb drive . 
  it was like a pixar story , except not . 
  in a sane court he would 've gotten maybe , maybe 20k bail . 
  people during the riots here yesterday in portland , got around 5-10k bail . 
  english is the second most spoken language in most of those countries . 
  it is not just that . 
  democracy requires pluralism , libertarianism is an absolutist ideology , it is that simple . 
  child sex slavery out of those countries is at an all time high , thanks haliburton !, 
  the problem goes way back to when the cia backed the baath coup in iraq in the 1960 's . 
  they thought pan-arabism mixed with a little stalinism would do just great in the middle east . 
  he was trying to write the contraction would 've . 
  it is a spelling error not a grammar error though . 
  would 've and even would n't 've are legit contractions . 
  no , it is just a spelling mistake . 
  he was trying to write a contraction . 
  no , that is not how spelling errors work . 
  no it is not . 
  it is a very common misspelling of two homonyms . 
  would 've and `` would of '' are virtually identical in spoken english . 
  people that whine about people misspelling would 've like to do so because it is a common mistake and they get to feel intellectually superior without actually being so . 
  it is one of the most commonly misspelled contractions in the english language . 
  i do n't need to argue anything , it is common knowledge for anyone who has ever graded a paper . 
  maybe you should n't comment on reddit in respects to grammar , then neither one of us would have had to waste our time . 
  because the spelling error may not be grammatically correct but that was not the intention of the writer . 
  it is a problem that would 've / could 've / should 've are homonyms of `` would/could/should '' - of , not that the writer thought that `` of '' being a preposition was replacing `` have '' which is a verb . 
  homonyms ca n't be mispelt ? 
  i do n't even know how to respond to something that requires one to merely obtain a jr. . high school completion certificate . 
  if it is 8kish in dps you can fly a rainbow boat laying mines . 
  the people that do n't want the cameras are the politicians who use the police as a tool to enforce unfair and unpopular laws like drug prohibition . 
  a car is way more valuable than a human life . 
  we had an all ages venue down the street that got closed down because of the under age prostitution and drugs . 
  no booze though . 
  i find that headphones work better in small houses as the acoustics have a lot of echoing problems . 
  i 'm no audio engineer , probably . 
  boxing match . 
  it was a strange beast none of us will likely see again . 
  zillow.com there are tons . 
  i 've never met a texan with an iq above room temperature . 
  texans are n't real americans , throw them out . 
  like another poster said , i wish i could unread it . 
  there used to be but they have all closed down one by one because of the massive homeless population . 
  people forget there used to be like 10 late night diners downtown . 
  the roxy is simply the last one . 
  i do n't know what `` worth buying '' means to you but my coworker just got a 2 bedroom condo on 90th and powell with a lot less down than you are talking about . 
  these are the realtors i used to sell some property last year , [ they ] ( http://www.yelp.com/biz/pdx-green-team-portland-2 ) were awesome . 
  it took 4 years of me logging in daily to eve to get the ship i wanted . 
  i do n't understand what people want from sto . 
  [ lizard people !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kewg_qsddee ), 
  we have [ oregon alligator lizards ] ( http://www.californiaherps.com/noncal/northwest/nwlizards/pages/e.m.scincicauda.html ) in our backyard . 
  they have been there for at least 10 years . 
  we put a little dish of water out for them during the summer and they come out to it and look at us through the patio door . 
  you can get a toon to 60 in less than 100 hours of casual gameplay time . 
  what do you guys want ? 
  a button that just gives you a fully-kitted out toon ? 
  i disagree , there are absolutely 3-d printed sculptures that have aesthetic value that can be considered on par with any hand-carved sculpture . 
  it would be like saying only the best books can be written by hand , printing presses will never produce a great book . 
  lifetime sub from beta . 
  i play about a dozen different mmos that i now have to schedule throughout the year so i can get through content . 
  i work from home so i play about 5-6 hours a day on average while i wait for new projects to come in . 
  sto is so much easier for me to get gear/xp on than the other games i play that i can literally level a toon , kit them out , and move on to the next one in the same time it takes me to get one piece of gear in another game . 
  swtor is like that , where the end game raiding takes me 3-4 months to kit out . 
  i guess i 'm coming from the perspective of a hardcore mmo player . 
  i 'm the sort of person who has done 12 hour raiding clears in eq , seriously look at eq 's raid progression guide it is [ 20 some odd levels ] ( http://everquest.allakhazam.com/wiki/eq:raid_progression_guide ) . 
  it is almost impossible to skip more than a single level in progression in eq , and you are not ever guaranteed a drop . 
  sto allows anyone to get anything . 
  even with just two hours a day , you can make 1000 's of zen a month . 
  even wow is harder leveling than sto , and has a much harsher gearing curve . 
  cryptic was told in beta that they should 've made the leveling and gearing curve harder , and add some form of high level raiding . 
  they did not listen . 
  now they have everyone at 50-60 with nothing to do but make gold mk xiv gear to max/min toons that do n't even have content that demands that high level of gear . 
  in most other mmos it is impossible to advance without obtaining a set of very specific gear . 
  sto allows almost endless variety at end game . 
  i admire that , it is by far the most casual game i play still . 
  sure you can shoot for 30-40k dps but all that does is make already easy content go by faster . 
  you can do this for a lot of recipes that use baking powder if you make whipped or even [ creamed butter ] ( http://www.craftsy.com/blog/2013/09/how-to-cream-butter/ ) . 
  i prefer yeasty sourdough biscuits myself . 
  i only use baking powder for recipes that are sweet like cake brownies or cookies . 
  just mix yoghurt to milk at a 4:1 ratio . 
  that is the most similar substitute for buttermilk i 've used when baking . 
  all states should have voting by mail , it has almost completely eliminated republicans disproportionately winning in states like oregon and washington . 
  oregon had over 70 % voter turnout in 2014 , [ texas had 28.5 % ] ( http://blogs.dallasobserver.com/unfairpark/2014/11/texas_had_the_worst_voter_turnout_in_the_country_tuesday_the_rain_in_dallas_didnt_help.php ) . 
  games workshop is trying to get a wh40k movie made . 
  that 'll be interesting . 
  yep , this is the time of year until about september where i do n't drive downtown unless i am shopping . 
  the worst is usually towards the end of june when the college kids are released into the wild . 
  is seattle a third world country ?
