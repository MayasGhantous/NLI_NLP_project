  their claims to being socially liberal are unfounded if they are not willing to uphold civil rights , which can only exist through the coercion of a government that upholds them . 
  [ `` the parent should not have a legal obligation to feed , clothe , or educate his children , since such obligations would entail positive acts coerced upon the parent and depriving the parent of his rights . 
  ... the parent ** should ** have the legal right not to feed the child , i.e. , to allow it to die .

  so , handwaving . 
  i 'm done . 
  coercion against those who would deprive others of civil rights is somehow worse than depriving people of civil rights ? 
  sorry , if a libertarian can claim that natural rights are worthy of protection of force e.g. 
  physical property and that civil rights are not worthy of the same protections , they are absolutely not socially liberal on the issues of rights . 
  so , ending slavery is equally worse than slavery ? 
  you are being wildly incoherent . 
  i am not building strawmen , i 'm demonstrating libertarians incoherence when it comes to rights . 
  how can property rights be protected with force in a libertarian society but not the right to not be discriminated against in buying property ? 
  civil rights have no tangible aspect ? 
  so being naked and hungry in the streets is what ? 
  it is not a moral issue to let one 's child to die of starvation ? 
  lol . 
  so again , what part of civil rights is not tangible to you ? 
  is it because it is not happening to you ? 
  being able to buy a loaf of bread without being discriminated against and refused service is absolutely a civil right . 
  so , again . 
  how is owning a piece of bread more tangible than buying a piece of bread ? 
  a libertarian state will ostensibly protect a sandwich shop 's owners right to refuse service to women , but will not protect a woman from being able to buy a sandwich . 
  that simply is not a socially liberal position . 
  where is it legal not to feed your children ? 
  because having people starving to death because no one in town is `` forced '' to feed them by taking their money is not a liberal position . 
  it is a libertarian position and it is incoherent . 
  so , in libertarian land . 
  what if no one will feed , clothe , or house you even if you have money ? 
  do you have the right to use force against those people then to steal a loaf of bread ? 
  because libertarianism is an absolutist ideology . 
  there is zero nuance or pragmatism . 
  murray rothbard , one of the 20th century 's leading libertarian philosophers said that one does not even have an obligation to feed one 's own children . 
  do you agree with that or not ? 
  do you believe in public sidewalks but not public healthcare ? 
  why ? 
  so your personal agenda comes out . 
  please tell me the context wherein abandoning a child to starve to death makes sense . 
  take a tablespoon of oil and mix it with the pasta before pouring on the sauce . 
  i really do n't care what a la carte libertarians think about anything . 
  believing in public roads/sidewalks/schools and not believing in public healthcare/housing/food benefits is incoherent . 
  do you , or do you not believe in public sidewalks ? 
  i 'm about to go through customs , i 've been waiting at the border for half an hour , i am trying to actually work . 
  i 'm also on my 8th whiskey soda . 
  you libertarians have made it difficult for me since usenet was a thing -- nntp ; and your ideology is monstrous as it seems all of you are either autistic or devoid of extrospection . 
  can i ask you a personal question ? 
  have you ever been homeless ? 
  do you have children ? 
  all i know is this , beaverton 's largest park is nike 's running forest park thing , it is private and it is untaxed . 
  from what i 've heard nike will tazer anyone running that loop and shanghai them to indonesia . 
   i believe that public sidewalks exist . 
  i also believe they would exist in an almost identical way even if they were not required by law . 
  as someone that consults for urban planning and civil engineering projects around the world , i ca n't stop laughing . 
  thanks . 
  dude , there is massive lack of foresight in building out sidewalks -- even when they increase economic activity -- [ in almost every fucking place on the planet ] ( https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=lack%20of%20sidewalks&amp;btng=search&amp;as_sdt=800000000001&amp;as_sdtp=on ) . 
  from inner ring suburbs in the forest hills of brighton to the rolling desert plains in the middle of fucking kenya . 
  there might be two dozen metro areas on the planet which factored in walkability , sidewalk coverage , and other active transportation from the get go . 
  everywhere else is playing catch up after a 20th century where humans built cities around cars , not people . 
  the delusion that the free market fairy will build out sidewalks and the reality that he wo n't is why the firm i work for has been around for over 100 years . 
  thanks to people like you , i 'm gainfully employed . 
  um , if i insist nike is making shoes out of dead indonesian children 's buttocks they should not be able to sue me ? 
  medicare is [ vastly more efficient than private healthcare ] ( http://healthaffairs.org/blog/2011/09/20/medicare-is-more-efficient-than-private-insurance/ ) even when accounting for fraud . 
  if we replaced our entire healthcare system with medicare today we could save trillions per year . 
  people might not know this , [ the south refused to make high school compulsory till well into the 20th century ] ( http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/a0112617.html ) . 
  if you want to know why so many folks in the south are just plain uneducated , it is because they 've had on average one less generation of ancestors that were required to go to high school . 
  hell , if you look at a [ literacy map for adults in the united states today ] ( http://i.imgur.com/yqkmpxf.jpg ) , you can still see the effect . 
  take out the esl immigrants of new york and california and the south has about double the amount of illiterate adults than anywhere else in the country . 
  yes , because the act of designing cities for human beings is usually about human health . 
  be it sanitation , seismic retrofits , or sidewalks . 
  crazy is it not ? 
  it is almost like human beings strive to make cities liveable for them like some sort of giant ants . 
  the largest structures on the planet are built for human habitation . 
  why would anyone trust them to be built well because of a motivation for profit after we have literally 10k years of examples why that does not work . 
  there are literally zero examples of private road construction , let alone private sidewalk construction , that have turned out well in the long run . 
  the only reason i even know of rothbard is because his writings on `` free market roads '' is used as a common example of non-engineers affecting policy and fucking shit up . 
  maybe i am being hard on you because i was once your age , and i once thought much of the same things . 
  in the real world , in the big crazy mess of a planet we got going on here , the free market absolutely has its place , but it sure as hell is not in long term city planning . 
  see this is the problem , individuals are fickle and stupid , they seek novelty every single generation to differentiate themselves from the past . 
  you can see this in the fashions they choose , the technologies they create , and the culture they are remembered for when they pass . 
  which is a key concept , death . 
  designing cities requires thinking about the past , present , and future of not just the physical geographic area filled with transportation corridors , regulations/bylaws , and zoning , but the institutions that manage them over the long term . 
  individuals die , institutions go on . 
  all long term change must be codified institutionally . 
  so we have two choices , private or public , when we choose institutions that build out and manage our infrastructure . 
  cities , imho , being the highest manifestation of human culture deserve democratic institutions that can guard and guide the projects that make where folks live a little bit better from generation to generation . 
  you can build company towns , some of them are even pretty well-laid out ; but the impetus long term will always , always gravitate back to democratic institutions . 
  that is an undeniable fact of humanity . 
  that is because when a political party is on the wrong side of history their policies become increasingly reactionary . 
  if they get in power the only way to maintain their policies is through exerting authoritarian control over the masses . 
  you can see this in shades from stalin 's halt to lenin 's economic liberalization to reagan 's round up the darkies drug wars . 
  stalin was trying to enact a centralized planned economy when by every metric was showing it was failing , he doubled and tripled down . 
  millions starved to death . 
  reagan came into power when states and cities were starting to treat drugs as a healthcare problem . 
  one of the main driving goals in reagan eliminating mental healthcare programs was that they were treating drug addiction . 
  the republicans in the 80 's were so ideologically opposed to drug users -- who they successfully portrayed as monsters preying on children -- that during the height of the aids epidemic they shut down 100 's of needle exchange programs across the country . 
  we are dealing with reactionary authoritarians . 
  they must be prevented from seizing power at every opportunity . 
  lest they actually attempt to enact their policies tempered not by reason or understanding but out of fear , rage , and hatred . 
  these people are dangerous , they will not compromise their ideology for anything . 
  which would be utterly insane .
