  you lived in brooklyn before the 1990 's iow ? 
  that 's the great part . 
  deflation paired with austerity is guaranteed to make people less likely to be able to sell their homes . 
  yeah , i got some of that . 
  look , mr. fuck you i got mine , 0.5 % tax is too high, 
  lol , if you think anyone would move for a 0.5 % tax , you have no idea how stock markets work . 
  ibm ca n't just get up and start trading on another exchange . 
  it would be a massive clusterfuck . 
  it has n't , this thread has been invaded by at least 10 people i have marked libertarian manchild . 
  wtf are you talking about ? 
  arizona has n't had a college in the top 100 ranking since the 1990 's . 
  arizona state jumped from 140 to 129 last year , woo, 
  at least with feudalism you could farm the land . 
  if you learn how to wrap a burrito in wax than foil , you can crockpot anything that is not too wet and throw it in there . 
  what we need is to have a talent show for a progressive female prophet and write a new book for these folks . 
  cheapest is going to be dry legumes in a slow cooker . 
  you can make a vegetarian chili w / black beans for about .50 cents a serving . 
  until people start demanding / r/basicincome and 3-d printed housing for everyone the rich are going to get even richer and less responsible than feudal lords . 
  there is simply no way forward without a revolutionary change in governance , technology , and economics at this point . 
  the rich can delay the inevitable by buying elections and hiring private security but they ca n't stop it . 
  they were told in the fucking 1970 's when the abortion issue ended up in the supreme court that the two major ways to stop abortion were sex education and free contraception . 
  like climate denialism , they have absolutely refused to even acknowledge the research . 
  authoritarian personalities like gop voters are exactly the sort of folks who have been on the wrong side of history since forever . 
  i 'd like to see a donation page for this . 
  why would i need to ? 
  i have 32 gigs of ram . 
  the question is : can we afford not to ? 
  a pilot program in an area the boffins think best might be a good start to a longer discussion society needs to have . 
  these sort of economic experiments should be happening in every major post industrial society . 
  i mean , it is likely the 21st century is going to be dealing with not just the federalization of europe but perhaps even asia , africa etc. 
  all leading to the 22nd century which by all measures will be dealing with questions of worldwide representative politics , constitutions , and human rights . 
  it is not leaders in the 21st century we need , it is movements . 
  movements backed by principles of shared humanity . 
  i do n't need history , i have 32 gigs . 
  i 'd like to live to see a worldwide convention on at least human rights , with elected delegates in every nation . 
  just to see how far we stand from each other .

  well , we ca n't continue the way we were in the 20th century , so what would you suggest ? 
  easier to just catch any outside cat and take it to a kill shelter imho .

  the nomenclature i used was manchildren ; so , either keep up with the discussion or leave . 
  dc always fucks up movie properties . 
  you have no idea what you are talking about . 
  an exchange ca n't reroute listings , that would break so , so many national and international regulations . 
  ibm pays to be listed on the nyse . 
  if it wanted to be listed on nasdaq it could as well , but there are fees involved in that . 
  so do you just want to go away ? 
  meh , every single person i have know that has come out of one of those bible colleges has become atheist by 30 . 
  so , i guess it is good at making atheists at least .

  america has some of the lowest taxes in the post industrial world unless you are making over 250k a year in a few rarefied states . 
  i 'm relatively well off but i do n't make that kind of scratch , congratulations . 
  [ the infamous lse rules . 
  ] ( http://www.londonstockexchange.com/traders-and-brokers/rules-regulations/rules-regulations.htm ), 
  they sure as hell can list on the lse but that would expose them them to eu and uk regulations . 
  `` a premium listing is only available to equity shares issued by trading companies and closed and open-ended investment entities . 
  issuers with a premium listing are required to meet the uk 's super-equivalent rules which are higher than the eu minimum requirements . 
  a premium listing means the company is expected to meet the uk 's highest standards of regulation and corporate governance -- and as a consequence may enjoy a lower cost of capital through greater transparency and through building investor confidence '', 
  so again , i am just going to mark you libertarian and stop replying to you . 
  cootchie coo i am forcing you to pay taxes . 
  i always thought nz and / r/cascadia would get along . 
  similar people . 
  fuck that , that boat has sailed . 
  two schools in arizona are in the top 10 for high schools and both are private schools with over 20k a year in tuition . 
  so , is that what we want ? 
  the best for the rich , and fuck everyone else ? 
  i ca n't find a public high school in arizona in the top 500 can someone help me ? 
  well , changing fptp might require a revolution at this point . 
  show me , how accounting rules in the eu/uk/usa are all the same . 
  i 'll wait here . 
  has n't happened yet , did you just google that ? 
  obesity kills the penis , so at least she wo n't have to feel that . 
  international cross listings have roughly the same regulatory environments and accounting rules ?

  dude if 0.5 % tax per trade would `` fuck up your plan to retire '' you are either the smartest day trader who has ever lived or full of it . 
  it has been a shit show since the republicans went nutso in the 1990 's . 
  george lucas offered to build out a film school for asu and was turned down because `` reasons '' . 
  [ shock is a helluva thing . 
  no , but they are a definitely a lower form of sapience .

  i mostly use mendeley for academic research . 
  the opposite of progressives are regressives as people are finding out . 
  give mendley a chance , [ the groups ] ( https://www.mendeley.com/groups/ ) alone are worth it . 
  what ? 
  asu is doing mediocre at best . 
  it has two top-tier research programs , and both are just endpoints for nasa funding . 
  also where are you getting 20-30 % from , that is something i 've never heard and i work at a university . 
  tell me when your randomized urban areas are easy to route light rail through and we 'll talk . 
  um , average cost for tuition for state schools has been around 12k a year . 
  asu is middle of the pack . 
  it is n't bad , it just is n't that great . 
  it also has higher costs than about 1/2 of public universities . 
  it could do a lot better , i 'm not being negative , i 'm being realistic . 
  idaho has nuclear engineering , it has the idaho national labs , that is where we test out new nuclear reactor designs .
