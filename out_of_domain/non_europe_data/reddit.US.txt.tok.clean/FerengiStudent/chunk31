  you know all that undeveloped land near the btc , that was set aside for high-density apartments 20 years ago . 
  right now there is no way for 200k people to move into portland without making blobs of low-income housing far away from the light rail system . 
  we sure as hell ca n't build anymore freeways into the city from the west side without leasing a tunneling machine , and the east side is way too expensive to mow down for more lanes . 
  max blue/red lines with upgrades can handle maybe 1.2 x the capacity they are pushing at peak hours now , which is as low as 6 minute intervals now , they might be able to squeeze it down to 4-5 minutes outside city center , maybe . 
  which means adding more cars may be the only solution , and that means longer delays for road traffic . 
  it is not about individuals , it is about social inequality . 
  the problem is that metros that do n't plan for this will eventually push their working middle class past the suburbs to the exburbs like what is happening in the bay area right now . 
  half of the counties surrounding san francisco are approaching a median house price of 800-900k , that means you have to make 120k a year to afford to qualify for even the worst rates for a mortgage atm . 
  in 10 years the median house price is likely to be over a million . 
  once the working middle class is in the exburbs , the suburbs will start filling out with upper middle class next . 
  what is happening in the bay area right now is that they are looking at having to build out bart way past the bay area just to bring in workers . 
  imagine building max all the way to forest grove or springdale or oregon city . 
  we are talking 10 's of billions of dollars . 
  the solution is simple : build affordable high density affordable housing in the existing max corridors . 
  we just need a metro and city government with the balls to do it . 
  it is not poverty specifically , it is social inequality , and your reply is racist as shit . 
   then another explanation can be found in culture and genetics as causes of unproductive mindsets , where criminality and poverty are symptoms of the base inability to maintain society . 
  you are a bigot and should feel bad . 
  that is why i asked the question . 
  my wife 's family lives in arcata , ca and i was down there for a [ 7.2 and the aftershocks were 4 . x ] ( http://earthquaketrack.com/quakes/2005-06-15-02-50-54-utc-7-2-16 ) . 
  it really changed my view of the planet . 
  i live in the pacific nw and even the short rolling ones are fucking terrifying . 
  i could not imagine a 9.0 close to surface in a populated area . 
  even the deep ones where stuff starts moving out of the corner of your eye and the the ground blurs a bit , and then slowly subsides are mindfucks . 
  [ 5.2 was the biggest , happened in 1990 in hereford . 
  ] ( http://earthquaketrack.com/quakes/1990-04-02-13-46-31-utc-5-2-18 ), 
  it is not total crap but once they start slashing benefits and implementing other austerity measures the small effects will snowball . 
  for instance , if you raise tuition costs by 20 % , you will still fill the seats in the university , but all of the sudden those seats decreasingly will be going to the lower economic quintiles of families , and they will increasingly go to international students from the upper economic classes . 
  what happens overtime with measures to reign in spending on social services is that you create generations of folks who have less economic mobility than their parents . 
  they might or might not even be able to stay in the same socioeconomic class , as they are more far more likely to find themselves falling into poverty as having children or owning a house or even a car becomes impossible with high rents and a non-liveable wage . 
  pacific nw had one of the largest active kkk memberships in the country in the mid 20th century , even while it was declining in other parts . 
  rural poverty studies on white-majority communities utterly disagree with your bigotry . 
  appalachia and the deep south only have a lower crime rate when population density and cost of living is not accounted for . 
  which is what the talking points you are mindlessly spouting come from . 
  if you make 20k a year in bumfuck kentucky you can afford a house , but if you make 20k a year in an urban metro like chicago you can only live in the most crime-ridden neighborhoods . 
  so crime becomes concentrated , and therefore the rates are exacerbated . 
  irish-americans and italian-americans in the 19th century had the same or greater rates of criminality as modern african-americans . 
  the following are not nations known for their large african-american populations , if you are unawares . 
  they all have the same exact demographic problem that african-americans have in the united states , that is urban metro areas dominated by concentrated pockets of poverty and crime .

  i live in portland , oregon now and the [ cascadia subduction zone is due for a 9.0 + quake ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1700_cascadia_earthquake ) anytime now . 
  we just had our annual [ earthquake prep weekend challenge ] ( http://www.opb.org/radio/programs/thinkoutloud/segment/earthquake-preparedness-whats-in-your-kit/ ) this may 15-17th where the local npr -- think bbc radio -- asked people in the portland area to live off part of their earthquake supplies . 
  they encourage you to go meet your neighbors to talk about it as well . 
  me and the wife set up camp with a neighbor family on our own initiative -- some of our supplies had already expired , and our neighbor 's son is a burgeoning chef at the local cordon bleu , so for the first night/day we ate : instant brown rice w / curried smoked salmon for dinner ; followed up by , dehydrated-sweet potato flatbreads with laughing cow shelf stable cheese and herbs for breakfast ; then we supplemented our diets with the two apple trees when we got back from work , and used the dozens of vegetables in our back garden to make a pick your own salad for dinner . 
  shit be serious , lots of people blow it off , but after going through that 7.2 , i have a new respect for what this planet is capable of dishing out . 
  not happening fast enough in the bay area , why would you think portland will be any different ?

  sf is at [ 400-500 a month ] ( http://www.thebolditalic.com/articles/4664-sf-and-oakland-top-the-worst-cities-for-parking ) for parking pre-paid per month now .

  do both . 
  do n't forget implementing a poll tax by forcing people to pay for identification . 
  a birth certificate , new ss card , and id with travel expenses can cost 100 's of dollars . 
  let 's just entertain the possibility that israel will continue expanding until there is no land they do n't want that the palestinians currently have . 
  because that is exactly what south africa did . 
  sure as fuck would . 
  it would mean the us could push for harder social reforms for any military aid with the unsaid threat that the cia could just drop some more documents out of the blue from another `` yemeni '' hacker group . 
  that is what happens when you have intelligence leaks , more follow , and some of them are n't from the same group . 
  it is underhanded geopolitics but it is realpolitik , and sa knows this . 
  [ military of the european union ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/military_of_the_european_union ) is largely a defensive force . 
  without nato 's big brother the usa it would have almost no geopolitical heft , as its blue water fleet is less than half the size of the americans alone . 
  also there are massive redundancies within the eu 's militaries that will not be ironed out until there is a central european military command . 
  modern wars are fought largely by specialists , not infantry . 
  also if you combine canada , usa , and mexico -- which operate under [ nafta ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/north_american_free_trade_agreement ) , you get an economic zone larger than the eu . 
  that is the current state of how the usa with cheap oil/mineral resources from canada , and cheap agricultural/manufacturing labor from mexico is able to outspend the world in defense spending . 
  let 's not make this a pissing contest between two unions with similar values , what we should collectively be concentrating on is the military and territorial expansion of china into the asian and african spheres . 
  china investing in africa and asia , with both military handouts and infrastructure in exchange for vast mineral and agricultural resources is going to be the 21st century 's major geopolitical counter to both us and eu hegemony . 
  china is n't turning democratic anytime soon , and the state capitalism and totalitarianism-lite that it practices may be a far more insidious ideology to uproot than the ussr 's failure first at international communism after wwi , and then at satellite communism after wwii . 
  after the bolsheviks overthrew the mensheviks during the russian civil war or october revolution , they stopped being the russian soviet federative socialist republic and became the union of soviet socialist republics , during a brief time after wwi when the soldiers came back there was a fervor to unite all the proletariat , which quickly fell to the wayside when confronted with the massive task of dealing with the socioeconomic problems that russia faced alone . 
  so international communism fell out of favor for state socialism , which at first allowed slight regional variances in how socialism was implemented to occur , like in the largely muslim held - stans . 
  stalinism took hold , and all of the sudden no deviances in policy were allowed . 
  they were held in tight check with sovietization -- read : russification -- of the satellite states which was a major component of how the ussr dealt with domestic unrest by shuffling people around by the 10 's of millions to lose their regional identities , and then cemented in place by repressive police state totalitarianism . 
  this is not a recipe for stable human societies , as we all saw in the spectacular 1991 collapse of the ussr . 
  however , state capitalism as in china allows the party elite to benefit economically disproportionately while at the same time raising standards of living for most , in exchange for denying rights to all under the guise of stability they claim is incompatible with western-style liberty and human rights . 
  that sort of system is an easy sell to underdeveloped country 's leaders and even people who are willing to give up national sovereignty and human liberty to receive china 's aid . 
  the people may not realize how intractable reforming such a system will be in the future . 
  this wo n't happen till robotic labor is substantially cheaper , and they have not yet unionized .
