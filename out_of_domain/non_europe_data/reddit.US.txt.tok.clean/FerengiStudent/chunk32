  i 'd love to see them go back and add level 60 + content to all the old storylines to keep them fresh . 
  iran is not even close to shaping anything at the scale of the world bank and nato , both solidly entrenched americentric/eurocentric institutions . 
  the us/eu hegemony in shaping geopolitics and economics -- read : free trade agreements -- is almost a singular entity [ when it comes to foreign investment ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_fdi_abroad ) , and it outstrips all other countries combined by quite a few orders of magnitude . 
  now look at [ foreign investment received ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_received_fdi ) . 
  notice how russia and iran have fallen off the charts since 2007 to 2013 ? 
  no one wants to invest in bumbling kleptocratic or theocratic regimes with failing infrastructure anymore . 
  russia is getting about as much foreign investment as mexico , which is having a conflict with drug cartels that rivals some civil wars ; but because it is part of nafta guess what ? 
  money keeps pouring in . 
  this will not last forever , china will rise , and when it does we will need to provide a united front . 
  because while neoliberal policies might be shitty , they are n't quite as bad as the alternative . 
  chance at asylum in the west if they are homosexual . 
  darpa is already trying to get two steps ahead with an avengeresque [ flying drone carrier scheme ] ( http://www.livescience.com/49057-military-flying-aircraft-carriers-drones.html ) and the x-47b drone is already carrier-capable for us nuclear carriers . 
  [ a fighter/mothership ] ( http://www.psfk.com/2015/02/6th-generation-fighter-darpa-pentagon-navy.html ) is being talked about as well , it will be a 6th gen fighter that can launch its own drones . 
  also drones that can assemble together to save fuel and then break apart to do their own thing on a mission , and then assemble back together again . 
  remember your cannibalism etiquette , [ dogs are a man 's best friend , so women first ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bdxqhi9qdw ) . 
  i am hoping that with robotic chefs and 3-d printed food i will be able to eat a beef steak marbled with duck fat shaped like spongebob squarepants by the time i have kids . 
  uk does the navy and the continentals do the groundwork , sounds fair . 
  [ farting is healthy .

  17 an hour is what i made during my internship in college . 
  borg summer beachball sphere confirmed . 
  will i be able to play sto when i retire in 40 years in the orbital old folks home ? 
  i drink with carnies when they are in town over the winter and most of them are above average people . 
  the shitty ones get ostracized on the road , like literally left behind . 
  they used to have shows about the brightest minds in our country like astronauts and scientists , but people do n't like watching shows like that , it makes them feel dumb . 
  so television studios find knuckle-dragging bigots and point cameras at them so people will watch to feel better about themselves . 
  happens in civil engineering as well where a person who works as a city engineer is let go for whatever reasons is found to the only person who is qualified to be an engineer in a small city . 
  flood the market with poisoned rhino horn and kill the consumers causing this . 
  [ here it is . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tposvmn3_l4 ), 
  now unto marijuana . 
  yep , they are buying in cash as well , so no normal person can actually compete with them . 
  in some metros institutional owners of residential properties has increased 200-300 % since we bailed the banks out . 
  wtf did the government think they were going to do with that money ? 
  they knew the game was rigged because they helped rigged it . 
  it would be as if the dealer in a monopoly game ran out of money , asked for money from the other players or he would stop playing the game , so the other players begrudgingly give him some , and then he proceeds to buy up all the property on the board while refusing to give out loans to the other players who run out of money . 
  when the tea party mania reached fever pitch in 2012 they won a lot of city and county elections all over the us . 
  they have universally been complete fuckwits when it comes to governance and maintaining infrastructure . 
  tories are about the same . 
  a firm we often partner with in the south is rebuilding a bridge because the city elected an all tea party city council that refused to budget for flood control because they were in a drought , which is the most important time to prepare for floods as dry ground does not absorb for shit . 
  come spring , a week of heavy rain partially exposes both the abutments on either end of the bridge along with the rest of the foundation . 
  no one had cleaned out the culverts since obama had been elected . 
  they keep driving on it , and then the substructure starts failing . 
  finally someone has sense to call the state . 
  state comes out and shuts bridge down . 
  town freaks out that they will have to drive 5 miles further up to cross now . 
  cost of maintaining flood control prevention : 100k or so a year to keep 2 people on payroll . 
  cost for their new bridge 3 million , with the added bonus that this has a very good chance of raising the insurance rates for the town in the future . 
  why ? 
  because through inaction on their part they made the area they govern into a high risk flood zone . 
  it takes decades to build out good flood control and only a few years of ignoring it to make it all but useless .

  [ it was called jake , and it gave you all sorts of neurological problems . 
  ] ( http://www.ibiblio.org/moonshine/drink/jake.html ), 
  think of it this way . 
  hasidic jewish people want to live in their own little protected enclaves so there is really only one way to accomplish that and that is to control who gets to live , work , and go to school near you . 
  this will be a function of who owns the most local real estate . 
  so what happens is a group of hasidic seed families will go into an area and buy some residential properties not just to live in , but for the future hasidic community at large . 
  they will attract young families with free or low rent , and then expect them once they become financially secure to begin contributing back . 
  they have taken over entire towns this way . 
  it is less than 1 % . 
  i 'm a moral person because i believe in x religion , denomination . 
  he got away with this because he was the only dentist in the area to treat kids who qualifier for chip . 
  there is a long history of people preying upon poor children , they are the least likely to complain , and if they do , they are hushed up on the cheap . 
  dollars to doughnuts they find some parents were paid off during his reign of terror for a few thousand bucks or so . 
  they get bad press but it tends to evaporate quickly . 
  they are n't bought like that typically . 
  what happens is street gangs exploit teenage runaways . 
  [ you mean like in myanmar ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddmwn7sr7qe ) where the local buddhist majority burns down muslim houses and businesses , and kills muslims in the streets . 
  it is way more sophisticated . 
  there are tons of ways to find johns who want to fuck a 15 year old . 
  [ escorts websites ] ( https://encrypted.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=craigslist%20for%20sex%20workers#hl=en&amp;q=escorts+website ) , dating websites , services like tindr etc. 
  people in louisiana blame obama for hurricane katrina even though he was only a us senator at the time . 
  we need a maximum wage , or we are going to see a day when the top .001 % have 99 % of the wealth . 
  the ai in this game is less sophisticated than some rpg games on the ps vita . 
  the voice acting tricks you into thinking the npcs are smarter than they are , they are as dumb and predictable as a box of rocks . 
  hate to say it but back in the day that meant getting into a team bus . 
  which is n't that unaffordable . 
  a charter bus is only about a 1000 bucks a day or the team could scrape its pennies together and buy one with about a 5-6k payment a month , buses are about 300k each . 
  4-5 days each way ? 
  lol , no , no . 
  they sleep on the bus , and it never stops moving except for gas and food once a day . 
  it can be done in 40 hours . 
  as a pe who works in urban planning i 'd like you to know that some of us think of you as just entitled glorified day laborers , i do n't . 
  i know the certifications are hard to get , and maintaining recerts is a bitch . 
  i 'm studying for my leed ap neighborhood development cert right now . 
  you should look into some of the [ gbci-approved stuff for nccer ] ( http://www.nccer.org/weatherization-2012 ) . 
  if you can do leed cert stuff , there is a whole new international green building bonanza out there at the moment . 
  that being said , you need to understand that your us vs them attitude is unproductive . 
  just because some of us urban planning progressives sit in air conditioning all day revising prints , plans , and models to ever changing specs does n't mean we are n't working just because we are n't sweating . 
  sports teams did that throughout the 20th century . 
  are you saying they were tougher and more resilient than our teams of today ? 
  i do n't often work in the field , and i 'm not a bad engineer . 
  the problem with a lot of foreman is they do n't want to fight for safe working conditions and fresh pes have a tendency to develop an out-sized ego until they inevitably fuck something up . 
  good engineers need to fail , it brings them down to reality . 
  unfortunately that often involves people getting hurt . 
  our firm does , and we also push for measure-twice philosophy so that idiots who ca n't use common sense but can read code and stay within the lines do n't fuck up too bad . 
  almost all safety problems that i 've seen from studies and personally are when someone wants to go cowboy . 
  either by not following the regs , prints , and specs or by making them up from memory on the spot .
