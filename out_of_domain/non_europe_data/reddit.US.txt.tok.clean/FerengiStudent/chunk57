  you do n't believe in democracy . 
  so in the marketplace of ideas how is libertarianism doing ? 
  poorly . 
  continue deluding yourself about how you think society should function , and we will just keep our functioning society working without you .

  i did not misinterpret anything . 
  libertarianism to be coherent , for one , must abolish all public property . 
  it is not an ideological buffet . 
  words mean things , and conceptually natural rights are incompatible with any democratic process by which they can be changed . 
  they are considered unimpeachable . 
  that entails no public services , property , or institutions of any kind that require taxation . 
  anything else is nonsensical given the nature of natural rights . 
  china will replicate them momentarily . 
  you are obviously not well read on the very political philosophy you claim to champion . 
  i would strongly suggest your wish to remain silence to me be extended indefinitely , or at least until you can rectify your profound ignorance and not waste others ' time . 
  good day . 
  most emotional and intellectual development for children happens with their peers . 
  parents play an ever diminishing role past the toddler stage . 
  good , the more data the better . 
  soon a two year college education will be afforded to all oregonians as they graduate high school . 
  it would be a shame to have those students be taught by an army of adjuncts while the administrations enrich themselves upon the fat of our tax dollars . 
  [ we have the technology !, 
  i think it killed more than his five . 
  yeppers , i work with plenty of degreed folks who are out and proud bigots . 
  they are like a retarded hive mind . 
  there are still plenty of ass in chair or on feet jobs though . 
  remove the illegal settlers . 
  they did in the very , very recent past . 
  oregon is a radioactive wasteland as in the original fallout . 
  fuck brokers for single properties . 
  to rent a house in portland should n't be too hard if you are within 20 % of market . 
  market for a 3 bedroom in the ne looks to be 1500-1800ish at the moment . 
  that would be cool if the column supported a huge structure they just have n't built yet .

  yeah , we really need adult helmet laws imho . 
  is this with their current electricity usage or projected ? 
  they do n't help much with concussions even if they are properly fitted and worn , they help mostly with catastrophic brain injuries . 
  are nc allowed access to sharp objects ? 
  one thing we 've noticed -- we 've been renting out two properties in washington county since the 2000 's and one in the se since the 1990 's -- is that the house in wash co. with the raised 10x20 vegetable garden rents above market rate . 
  it took us two weekends to build out , but admittedly it was two civil engineers and an architect using child labor . 
  sweet , sweet child labor . 
  i use pyrex pie pans for something like this . 
  oil the pans , mix eggs with herbs and pour in .

  it allows you to do 4 at once . 
  no , i 'm not a manchild , why do you ask ? 
  retarded biker logic for 200 alex. 
  that is why some states have good samaritan laws addressing this . 
  so edgy . 
  i do n't know why are you being downvoted . 
  either we pay a living wage that puts the onus on business owners or the taxpayers have to pay for social programs . 
  i do n't like paying taxes so someone else can make a larger profit . 
  get a large marker board . 
  it helps to stand and pace in front of it when doing problems . 
  i 'm not your bro , dude . 
  except without a min wage we had things like women being paid a 1/10th of a man 's salary . 
  i guess conservatives do believe women are lesser though , so that makes sense . 
  it is one of the reasons americans pay so much less for groceries at the cash register , most workers are part time making min + . 
  which means we pay for many of these workers to get food stamps . 
  many of whom ca n't even afford to shop at the stores they work at . 
  yeah , aca is [ a fucking mess for low wage workers ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/dandiamond/2015/01/13/obamacares-impact-companies-cut-hours-for-part-time-workers/ ) but that is just bad legislation . 
  the min wage in every single metro area in the united states is below the poverty line , inarguably this hurts the economy far , far more than creating a living wage allowing the domestic consumer good sector -- [ which has been flat or contracting for 8 years ] ( http://biz.yahoo.com/p/3conameu.html ) -- to recoup the ground loss since the 2007 economic debacle . 
  that would allow the lower income folks to get their heads above water , their collective credit rises , and then they can start planning out a middle income existance . 
  right now we have people working 60 hours a week in two part time jobs and still qualifying for social programs . 
  automation of the entire fabrication , packaging , and sales of products may be on the horizon ; however , that only means our living wage must very likely take into account the vast amounts of productivity increases that will be made possible with this new kind of economy . 
  one where evermore of not just labor but creative tasks as well is offloaded to machine intelligences . 
  do we pay the ais , or keep them as slaves, 
  they use churches as a social/business club . 
  go into one if you have n't in awhile . 
  you will find at least one obnoxious person going around trying to sell you something , be it a condo or some juice from a pyramid scheme . 
  you will also find they have `` christian-owned '' businesses that hire unemployed people within the church at the drop of a hat . 
  most christians for instance know if they move to a new city just to go from church to church till you find a job . 
  this is gathered from living near one for a long time growing up . 
  on mondays the new workers would wait out behind the church before i went to school and then after awhile a company van or a pickup truck and sometimes a car would pick them up . 
  one of the reasons conservatives do n't appreciate the social safety net the state provides is that christianity was designed or at least propagated itself as a charitable organization for those of the faith , as it spread it began institutionalizing regimes ecclesiastically with kings chosen by god , armies dedicated to defend it , and priests who could forgive even mortal sins . 
  that nonsense is mostly gone , so we are left with christianity increasingly as a charitable organization social/business club . 
  the evangelicals are dying out .

  they expanded settlements killing 100 's in the process .

  they went from top 2 in datacenters to 5th 6th now . 
  that is why some states have good samaritan laws .
