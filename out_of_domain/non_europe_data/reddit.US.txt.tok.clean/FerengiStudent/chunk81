  meh , i saw people pushing cars that were stuck in the snow out here in the se . 
  prosecution is the bread and butter of the executive branch , what are you talking about ? 
  man , shit is going to get weird if they put an artificial womb on these things . 
  lots of kids with whacky hair colors and superpowers . 
  [ here are some stats . 
  ] ( http://www.statista.com/statistics/250091/coffee-drinking-consumers-in-the-us-by-age-group-2010/ ), 
  it reflects my experience as well . 
  i drink more coffee in my 40 's than i did in my 20 's . 
  m2a1 is flying tank piloted by japanese teenagers , is secret . 
  should we really have a sub like libertarian on here ? 
  it has some awful and toxic comments . 
  japanese mackerel in a can is good , if you use it in the recipes it calls for . 
  the us does n't really need more low-skilled people in construction anywhere . 
  what we need are high-skilled people repairing infrastructure we already have . 
  maybe free two years of trade school or community college would be better . 
  most of the unemployed are hs graduates or less . 
  for the wage it is . 
  that is less than 2 dollars an hour for their work . 
  that is fucking insane . 
  for many people it will cost more in public transportation costs than the food stamps are worth . 
  chemical castration works for some and can be implanted so they ca n't mess with the dosages . 
  this is 2016 not 1916 . 
  ever built a bridge ? 
  that is why it is n't used for everyone , and it is vastly cheaper than prison . 
  yeah , i 'm a civil engineer i see it all the time . 
  do you think you can just pull people off the streets and they become electricians ? 
   the division of labor of construction encompasses a diverse range of skilled and manual labor . 
  among the most common construction trades are those of carpenter , electrician , heavy equipment operator , ironworker , laborer , mason , plasterer , plumber , pipefitter , sheet metal worker , steel fixer ( also known as a `` rodbuster '' ) , and welder . 
  i do n't even know how to respond except by definition , i 've worked alongside this industry for two decades . 
  you have to . 
  that is the only way to make sausages . 
  so you have an anecdote to support your claim , how quaint . 
  cheapest hot calories you can buy . 
  just japanese . 
  yeah , the taste was underwhelming . 
  it was like a mild fruity coca cola . 
  dude , how stoned are you, 
  pretty sure most countries with sane gun regulations have less successful murder of spouses/children by sad manchildren . 
  i grew up in eastern oregon . 
  ranchers ; btw , are the 1 % of any rural community . 
  while taking federal dollars from the rest of us they campaign against local taxes . 
  one of the major problems in oregon is that portland 's taxes support like 70 % of the state but they only get about 50 % of what they put in . 
  the rural counties keep slashing their taxes so city folks pick up the slack . 
  these rural communities bitch and complain that they ca n't afford more taxes/regulations/min wage increases -- blah , blah , blah -- but if they had fucking raised taxes decades ago to sustainable levels and attracted some industries besides forestry/ranching they would be in a much better place . 
  we ca n't keep propping up these low tax rural counties in the us . 
  they need to pay their own way or be absorbed by counties that can . 
  civil rights are not negotiable . 
  india lifts more people out of poverty each year than the entire continent of africa . 
  50 years ago it was worse . 
  you are the one who made the claim that all money given to india 's government is ineffective . 
  i do n't think you understand , economic freedom is n't something that can be objectively measured . 
  it just makes the game harder to understand for the people voting . 
  the op is garbage , there are better things to do . 
  i really wish there was a rating system for users . 
  people upvote the same shrill nonsense every time the same topic comes up without even reading the fucking article . 
  i am getting sick of reddit 's commenting flaws . 
  he comes from a family of evangelical con artists . 
  he is the product of his toxic environment . 
  i 'm glad the robots will be tripping their balls off while butchering us . 
  still does n't excuse arming an apartheid state . 
  i remember when people were still defending south africa . 
  you do n't have a pan ? 
  pans can toast bread . 
  oh man , reagan himself vetoed the [ anti-apartheid act ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/comprehensive_anti-apartheid_act ) , but congress overrid him . 
  he loathed enforcing it , and there are pictures of him glad handing south african politicians and laughing while brutally suppressed insurrections were erupting in s africa a year before the fall of apartheid there . 
  not the best moment in american history . 
  [ republicans and apartheid . 
  ] ( http://mic.com/articles/52029/the-surprising-republican-civil-war-that-erupted-over-nelson-mandela-and-apartheid#.9qqs9hgmy ), 
   in 2009 , a comprehensive 18-month independent academic study was completed for the human sciences research council of south africa for the south african department of foreign affairs on the legal status of israel 's occupation of east jerusalem , the west bank and gaza strip . 
  [ 62 ] the specific questions examined in the study were whether israeli policies are consistent with colonialism and apartheid , as these practices and regimes are spelled out in relevant international legal instruments . 
  the second question , regarding apartheid , was the major focus of the study . 
  authors and analysts contributing to the study included jurists , academics and international lawyers from israel , the occupied palestinian territories , south africa , england , ireland and the united states . 
  the team considered whether human rights law can be applied to cases of belligerent occupation , the legal context in israel and the occupied palestinian territories and related international law and comparative practices . 
  the question of apartheid was examined through a dual approach : reference to international law and comparison to policies and practices by the apartheid regime in south africa . 
  initially released as a report , the report was later edited and published in 2012 ( by pluto press ) as beyond occupation : apartheid , colonialism and international law in the occupied palestinian territories . 
  that is a nuance most people do not seem to understand about authoritarianism ; it is always about the followers , not the leader . 
  the leader is interchangeable to a large degree . 
  citation ? 
  international legal and academic consensus is that israel is practicing apartheid . 
  i think of it is as beer miso . 
  i wish us americans could start making it out of craft beers . 
  [ hipster trap . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psxcl70rr3q ), 
  i remember it as [ cold war fear-mongering over the anc being communist terrorists ] ( http://www.salon.com/2011/02/05/ronald_reagan_apartheid_south_africa/ ) combined with regressive sentiments against american domestic issues involving race . 
  right wing radio at the time were parroting the talking points of the south african regime , and often lamented that the us could not institute such policies because of liberals in the us . 
  it was a weird time . 
  mitch mcconnell was a freshman senator from kentucky and was [ instrumental in rallying the gop to override reagan 's veto ] ( http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/12/10/how-mitch-mcconnell-defied-ronald-reagan-on-apartheid.html ) .

  well if only a small percentage of new yorkers are growing in wealth while everyone else is struggling i 'm pretty sure we can agree that something must be done . 
  consumers drive every economy , when we have millennials postponing buying houses , having children , and other major life decisions what will happen going forward ? 
  it is hard to link to all the drama , it is spread out across all recent postings in the sub . 
  should i post a text write up ? 
  alright . 
   `` i 'm not trying to make myself out to be a profile in courage here , but i thought the president was simply wrong , '' mcconnell said .

  mail is not like the internet . 
  if you do some shady shit and use the usps , you are going to eventually have a very bad time . 
  well , the epa never was given the authority to do it right when we were dealing with this lead paint shit the first go around in the 1970 's . 
  entire cities made themselves exempt . 
  nj exempted older construction from lead paint rules 30-40 years ago .
