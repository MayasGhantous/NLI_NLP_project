   all of my this . 
  you should try posting around / r/cringe , they 'd get a kick out of you . 
  if he 's 18 is n't he legally old enough to make an account and reap his own karma now ? 
  about a week ago it was ~ 40 people online all the time . 
  now as i kill more and more people , less and less come on . 
  weird how it works . 
  i 'm sure the 1st of march will start a small resurgence again once everyone has another life to lose . 
  seriously sick of everyone and their grandma using x-ray and then complaining when they get banned . 
  so dumb . 
  looks fun , do you take fall damage while in boats ? 
  like if i were to land on the ground instead of water would i die ? 
  i commend you on performing seppuku after having led all of us to our deaths . 
  try having 3 of your roommates screaming their heads of and yelping at 4 in the morning every time they make a goal or even a decent pass . 
  i 'm telling you man , live on the surface !, 
  brighten your world up !, 
  all of the heads we collected are treated with respect and showcased accordingly . 
  i put that sign there before everyone knew i was a total tool . 
  sorry man , times of war . 
  in-game name ? 
  zlegal is n't our friend . 
  where did you go man !, 
  actually apache , you got his name * right * , and i want to know how . 
  ltor gets excited in combat, 
  comment and subscribe for more terrible minecraft play !, 
  people like you are the reason there 's so much misunderstanding and rumors . 
  not even there and taking the word of someone who was proven to have lied about events like this taking place . 
  though i guess history really is written by whose left . 
   would ** not ** you ** not ** be broke , if you had ** not ** covered their bar tabs ? 
  ah , the old triple negative . 
  this is a brilliant idea, 
  stupid thing is he probably clicked that link regardless of nsfw tag . 
  i have a theory that only 1 out of every 10 complaints of a lacking nsfw tag actually come from someone while they are at work and could jeopardize their job by looking at an image like that . 
   implicit, 
  yes . 
  only if you cite it in mla format . 
  hello, 
  thanks a lot for this !, 
  maybe co-ed . 
  perhaps that will help . . or make it worse haha, 
  i do n't think the drug he was talking about was jerking off, 
  everyones completely different so your mileage may vary , but after 4 or 5 unsuccesful attempts of `` weaning off '' and smoking less/less , i was only able to succesfully kick the habit by dropping it cold turkey , and stopped even with about 14 cigarettes left in my pack . 
  one of my greatest achievements , and it can be yours too . 
  do n't do it unless you badly want to change , if you do n't then just keep smoking . 
  to give you an idea , i cheated one time about a week in and felt guilty and like shit the whole week after , you should want it enough that cheating feels bad . 
  that was the one time i did . 
  on the other side , feels great !, 
  good luck man !, 
  thanks man great insight . 
  really i just feel like i 've run out of time . 
  i feel like good places for affordable prices are already filling up so if i do n't take what i find now i might not get anything , and with the deadline for on-campus housing only a week away for me i need to make a decision quick and stick with it . 
  how does one half-starve ? 
  i think ducklings will be with their mother nearly 100 % of the time until they are ready to go forth on their own as adults . 
  source : tom & jerry, 
  yep , this is terrifying to me . 
  i 'd bet money she 's thankful for that looking back, 
  someone always has to die, 
  evil, 
  they didnt fucking show it, 
  see : rule 2 . 
  where the fuck do you live ? 
   the last time [ i cried ] was the movie up, 
   i 've just been conditioned way too well . 
  lol . 
   there will never be a time when fat is desirable . 
  quoted so that in 50 years i can come back and see if this still stands . 
  have no idea why you are being downvoted , do people not believe this is a real thing or something ? 
  i have hyp * er * thyroidism , so gaining weight is tremendously difficult for me . 
  congrats on the 40 pound loss by the way !, 
   * peer, 
  what am i quite wrong about ? 
  i just said i was quoting you to see if social norms still prefer skinny women . 
  you have no way to prove with certainty that it will , there are many many traditions and tactics that women ( and men ) use to make themselves more appealing that are already unhealthy today , why do you think that we will all of a sudden just * click * and realize it is n't worth the cost ? 
  just look at all of the women that starve themselves to fit the model of what they think men will think is attractive . 
  cultures vary widely around the world , many parts of china still show great respect to women the older the get , and the heavier they get . 
  quite the opposite of american culture . 
  kids , you know how you are just now starting to see some homework assignments that are getting tougher and tougher ? 
  well , i 'm more than a decade older than you , and i 'm still riding that trend . 
  i am a college student . 
  ama, 
  yeah he could have also not said anything at all . 
  who are you to police how other people choose to express good wishes ? 
  ignore and you 'll score, 
  is this oc ? 
  or did you just find the perfect place to use that ? 
  op will surely get it now !, 
  yep , was wondering if he made the picture though, 
  the entire spongebob picture, 
  yeah it sounds * dank !, 
  huh , what is this in reference to ? 
  just asking because i was listening to aerials by system of a down and the chorus played while i read your comment ; perfection . 
  please , i must see the source for what this is referencing !!!, 
  i know that i saw it , but i do n't fucking remember for the life of me where and what it looks like . 
  ** i beg you !, 
  that is actually a * blonde, 
  can one of you possibly tl ; dr this entire conversation ? 
  it seems like an interesting trolling to read through but it 's so * long * !, 
  might wonna censor the 3rd picture, 
  yardbird died !, 
  he was one of my favorites . 
   there i learned that stomping the floor is a way to get someone 's attention across the room .
