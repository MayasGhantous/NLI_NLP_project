  i was looking at local banks , but i figured that would cause issue when paying employees located elsewhere in the country ? 
  my business is based online and we do n't have a local office , so if i am issuing payments from a bank that only exists locally are there any issues that you can foresee happening ? 
  ( genuine question ), 
  of course , i mean i 'm not sure of the exact statistics but personally i 've seen videos of thousands of people having sex but only one video where a guy basejumped into a pool party . 
  not sure if you 're kidding . . 
  because most people in any country with an airport can speak english, 
  what does it say ? 
  even if people are ignorant to the history of any specific stereotype , it should be clear by now that making fun of white people = okay , and making fun of black people = not okay , regardless if there is a genuine historical basis or not . 
  there does n't need to be a million `` that 's not fair i 'm white and ____ '' memes . 
  i 'm wondering this too . . 
  race is only a factor when it 's convenient for non-whites i know, 
  unless you look over 16 in my experience, 
  edit : i explicitly said `` in my experience '' , so you can take your downvotes and go fuck yourself , reddit . 
  no , this is reddit . 
  i 've had no issue buying alcohol for the last 3 or so years and i 'm still not 21 . 
  ymmv i suppose . 
  seriously !, 
  i 've probably seen it happen like a dozen times now !, 
  are those three girls ? 
  enjoy these next few years dude . . 
  nice to see you again , my freshman philosophy teacher !, 
  people actually use google hangouts ? 
  who * are * you ? 
  just so everyone knows , this lmfao20times account appears to be an alt of the op who posts on every thread some generic supportive comment to make these videos seem good . 
  look at his past posts . 
  i would n't doubt that he is also upvoting himself with this account so i have reported it . 
  do n't you think it 's silly to have a degree in something that is still only a theory ? 
  surprised feminists let this one slip by . 
  leave, 
  destinylfg.com is a better alternative, 
  sorry i was just making a dumb joke about the layman would have a totally different definition of the word `` theory '' compared to someone in the area you work . 
  but your field confuses the fuck out of me for totally different reasons regardless . 
  that 's what he 's alluding to , and also the fact that western media made it sound far * worse * than it really was to maintain it 's 24/7 broadcast of fear and panic . 
  have you since moved to a new area ? 
  the guys who invented that templar `` cheese strat '' released a few strategy guides on each boss if anyone is interested :, 
  - [ opening the entrance ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uy_mdt8tmpc&amp;list=uuglcutwflwf2_sa9gzornsq ), 
  - [ templar foolproof victory ( ignore oracles ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yacjpjql8fg&amp;list=uuglcutwflwf2_sa9gzornsq ), 
  - [ atheon ( both points of view , inside/outside portal ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iptwqao6moq&amp;list=uuglcutwflwf2_sa9gzornsq ), 
  they 're definitely in my top 5 . 
  brb . . 
  actually i know the same people as him so thats 2 to 1 so we win !, 
  are you ? 
  ooh i like this argument, 
  that 's a big pig . . 
  . . not that i clicked it or anything, 
   sexually abusing animals, 
  give me a break , imo if an animal can not pass the mirror test it does n't deserve any rights . 
  i dont understand whats going on at all but i kind of want to hit send, 
  i think this might be the grossest thing i 've ever seen for some reason . 
  is that her ? 
  why do canadian 's celebrate thanksgiving ? 
  eh , pretend legal is pretty much legal at this point unless you 're a total idiot with it . 
  phil fish ? 
  you can just whitelist them on adblock, 
  is india really considered third world ? 
  i think so too . 
  hong kong has been to the moon ? 
  * 1 person with ebola *, 
   `` this is so overblown , can everyone just relax ? '', 
  * 2 people with ebola *, 
   now i am actually a little bit concerned . 
  are you a cartoon ? 
  just so people know it is a federal law that an emergency room can not refuse to triage/treat you based on financial information or insurance status . 
  do n't want europeans or even uninformed americans freaking out that hospitals are going to just kick out ebola patients based on insurance , or that the patients wo n't seek help in the first place . 
  the one man was triaged in the er and sent home because they did n't think it was ebola , i 'm sure now that this hospital has been raked over the coals in the media others will be more cautious . 
  i mean if you have ebola you 're pretty much going to the er regardless , you are n't going to call your doctor and schedule in appointment for a couple weeks down the road . 
  you 're breaking the circlejerk . 
   i think both male and female agree that if they were suddenly the opposite gender they would be a slut . 
  that does n't even make sense . 
  i 'm pretty sure the guys saying this are people who would already be having sex all the time with different people given the opportunity , while the women ( assuming they 're in the top 70 % for looks ) could already be doing that , and would probably find that when changed to a male that opportunity is gone or at least diminished . 
   having to prosecute cases for crimes without witnesses ? 
  pretty sure that 's already almost all homicide cases . 
  an uncountable amount of money spent each year telling them they should buy more . 
  i did n't think about that, 
  because it 's only bad when a male teacher fucks a female student , got it . 
  any trick on how i can update / get the pro version of alien blue ? 
  my appstore does n't show an update pending for the app and unfortunately when i search for it i ca n't seem to find it , only hundreds of similar apps . 
  as someone who wandered in from / r/all could you explain it to me ? 
  i 'm pretty sure she is your ex bro, 
  that 's hilarious, 
  thanks !, 
  thanks for the advice , i 'll look into us bank i had n't really researched them before . 
  out of curiosity what bank * do * you use ? 
  um because there 's 0 proof that a chest spawns here ? 
  i could hop on destiny right now and record me walking to one of the hundreds of empty spaces in the raid claiming i saw a chest spawn once and then ask people to figure out how to get it to spawn . 
  i mean both the xbox one and ps4 have recording capabilities , including recording things that happened in the past , it 's absolutely preposterous that 6 people would find a chest for the first time in the world and there would n't even be a single clip as proof . 
  you just have to have found a channel that does a good job before they started removing the threads . 
  i think these guys do a good job , no shitty commentary/voiceover asking for subs , straight and to the point :, 
  - [ last week ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5nox898gku ), 
  - [ this week ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcr9ggr-lwq ), 
  bro that looks shopped as fuck are you kidding me ? 
  hey man you 're right , i mean the last guy posted a text post with an imgur link to a picture of him/his group standing on the chest , but i 'm sure this guy just thought putting in a screenshot at the end of a youtube video was the most efficient way to show him getting it . 
  never mind the fact that if it was real he wouldv ' e had to record a clip to get the screenshot in the first place , but i guess he thought a clip of him not getting the chest while walking over to it was more important . 
  have fun searching for it man i 'm sure it 's just sitting there waiting for you !, 
   reddit loves to massively exaggerate the cost of text books . 
  i 'm not sure what makes you the authority on book prices but going to college does n't make you a special snowflake i 'm pretty sure that 's a giant percentage of reddit 's users . 
  last year i had an economics book that was over $ 300 . 
  this is hilarious . 
  i was about to suggest this as well , there a lot of great resources online and especially on youtube for learning how to beat the vault of glass . 
  i know one of the channels i 'm subbed to just released their [ vault of glass hard mode guide here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=831kdtqn32o&amp;list=plqewimtzn6ymrxm27hwi-frtnoa1_dpn3 ) , but i 'm pretty sure they already did videos of the normal mode as well for people that want to go back and look for that stuff .
