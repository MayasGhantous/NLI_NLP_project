  hey i like your name , and gerard butler !, 
  til, 
  til, 
  ` some guy ' ? 
  this dude is for sure still in high school . 
  midnight release tonight babyyyy , tell your mom to get the massage oil !, 
  that 's not true i 'm an engineer and i ne -, 
  they work for the nsa . 
  just what i 'd expect from someone who posts in / r/hailcorporate and / r/girlsmirin, 
  yes . 
   [ do n't like it , do n't watch it . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/roosterteeth/comments/2izpwz/miles_on_the_podcast/cl7007k?context=3 ), 
  obviously he should 've made it about him walking in on them !, 
  the story would not have been nearly as funny if he had walked out on them like my estranged father . 
  seriously though voting machines are not at all running complex software , they 're basically counting machines . 
  anyone who went through a series of [ java programming tutorials ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrypn2cpay8 ) could design a rudimentary ` voting machine ' on their laptop/computer . 
  obviously any security/network checks/etc . 
  would be much more difficult to implement but i feel like most of these features were implemented after the possible fraudulent election took place . 
  i 'm sorry but wanting voting machines to be run on java instead of vb shows such a lack of understanding of each of the languages , and this is coming from someone who teaches java as a part time job . 
  vb is a fine language for the task . 
  seriously , there 's absolutely nothing wrong with using vb for this type of software . 
  clever, 
  yeah what the fuck are people saying , there 's more than one working solution without crossing lines or houses . 
  / r/niggers has been banned sitewide . 
  trust me , plenty of schools advertise teaching positions on craigslist in the us and elsewhere . 
  source : found teaching job on craigslist, 
  this guy gets it, 
  well , he 'll never lose it . 
  maybe i will , just want to see if it does alright in this sub first, 
  charizard was only 5 ' 8 '' and 200 pounds ? 
  or a clitiologist . 
  try again, 
  you 're missing the point . 
  i 'm pretty sure you ca n't willingly change someone 's sexuality , have n't we learned that from all the * pray the gay away * camps and the horror stories their attendees tell ? 
  christ . 
  this is the funniest thing i 've ever read on this site . 
  if i did n't [ spitefully buy gold for some annoying idiot ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/2klqx9/theres_something_fishy_about_this_costume/clmuzwk?context=1 ) a few days ago , you would have it now . 
  do you have paypal ? 
  hows the safe lookin , doc ? 
   all the nazis were n't evil , they were people who thought they were doing the right thing . 
  you :, 
   it 's also important to remember that everything we consider evil was done by people who thought they were doing something good . 
  you 're such a free thinker . 
  i think you 're interpreting my language the way you want to, 
   [ sexual orientation ] is an issue that needs to be ` fixed ', 
  again , this is exactly what people were saying for centuries about homosexuals and many other sexual traits . 
  you should . 
  i was going to link you the place i tagged him from , but [ he deleted his post . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/2iy335/til_pornhub_planted_15473_trees_in_honor_of_their/cl6kic7 ), 
  great , thanks !, 
  you read the youtube comments ? 
  wow , i did n't know you had a computer in the kitchen . 
  i saw you linked that originally and i still do n't understand . 
  i 'm sorry but there 's 0 chance the dude does n't notice all the pets in the house and his roommate on the stairs 7 feet away at 0:11 seconds in . 
  this one does n't . 
  so i really ca n't play with all of the skulls ? 
  between bandana , pinata and grunt funeral i 'll only be able to choose one ? 
  it 's nice to have some sort of validation from this documentary that yes , most people would agree that halo reach / 4 really let the series down . 
  i see people a lot of times , on this sub especially , talking about how halo 4 is the best of the series , and i just sit back and wonder who really believes that , that they must have clearly not played h1/h2 . 
  it 's not that i do n't * want * people to enjoy and play the games they like , reach/4 included , it 's that i want people to be aware of what the series used to be so that maybe they would be in support of 343 bringing it back to bungie 's roots a bit . 
  thanks !, 
  ** doodlebob : the movie **, 
  i 'm gon na need an illustration . 
  sorry i 'm new to this website but when i click the link all i see is a picture of a duck man or something ? 
  oh well i guess it 's not important , thank you for trying to help me . 
  i 've noticed a few verses from lose yourself by eminem . 
  that 's hilarious . 
  had no idea the emblem ` scene ' was a thing until one of the channels i sub to put out a tutorial on how to make the reddit alien . 
  edit : [ here 's the video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeyriviaro4&amp;list=plqewimtzn6ykhz1lxwhg8jfk4khtklrob&amp;index=5 ) for those curious, 
  are you trying to say call of duty fans are immature ? 
  go fuck yourself idiot ^ get ^ ^ ^ raped, 
  this sub is a fucking cult . 
  that was unnecessary force . 
  he got hit with a purse and slowly turned around and decided to assault her , he could have instead left to another train car and called the police . 
  i 'll bet money he 's going to jail .

  i 'll bet money he 's going to jail . 
  but you see people in the video doing it . . 
  you need to make a good faith effort to avoid confrontation , not do some dramatic slow turn towards a girl before slapping her . 
  okay dude . 
  he said it !, 
  mad spicious . 
  he said it two more times !, 
  there 's a minimum age for this site , you know . 
  i can count every famous athlete i know of on my hands : magic johnson , kobe bryant , shaquille o'neal ( sp ? 
  i think eli manning is an athlete , and that soccer player that looks like the actor who i do n't know . 
  get with the times , man !, 
  edit : there was a hey arnold episode with a famous baseball player named mickey , i think he might be real . 
  ** sorry i do n't follow the nfl . . but i mean . . surely the rule is more complex than that ? 
  could n't i just purposely toss the ball to the opposing team when i 'm about to be tackled or intercepted or slam dunked on home plate ? 
  considering the lowest pitch sounded like a 15 year old , i think dayoneupdate has a point . 
  pls 343 . . 
  i wish they just made it so you could n't be in voice chat parties at all when playing matchmaking , kinda like how cod does for search . 
  hearing the enemy talking was such a game of mental warfare , or misleading them on purpose when you knew they could hear you . 
  i would n't say that one was the best , i 'm partial to [ this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwmuawpnjuy ) and another i ca n't seem to remember the name of . 
  does that mean he 's right ? 
  of course there 's * some * overlap , but overall reddit has a very strong anti-religion vibe . 
  i mean / r/atheism was a ** default subscription ** for new users for years until recently being removed . 
  shadowbanned .
