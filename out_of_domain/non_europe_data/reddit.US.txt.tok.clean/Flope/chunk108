  that sounds awesome !, 
  i wish they had included more movable objects but i bet people are going to make great use of the garage door . 
  i also just [ posted a guide on how to spawn/despawn objects ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/2m87zh/as_requested_how_to_spawndespawn_objects_with/ ) if you 're interested . 
   yeah , but thats been happening since ~ ~ h4 ~ ~ halo 3 . 
  ftfy, 
  death by marijuana actually sounds kind of horrific . 
  thanks !, 
  watching now , do n't suppose you could give a quick summary of what happened in the first 30 minutes of the xpac as well ? 
  it was 4am when i finally got on and was too tired to pay attention . 
  ** first ~ 30 minute spoilers : **, 
  basically what i understand is some mage teleported us to the portal , and then we marauded through . 
  below the entrance on the other side was gul ` dan and i did something that he either did or did n't like ( not sure if he 's a bad guy ) then we ran into the first zone and i was leading like a group of 30 random npc 's on a charge around the zone doing things . 
  along the way we met a few important orcs who i do n't remember . 
  do i have it pretty much right ? 
  anything important i should know more about from that summary ? 
  i 've watched the first 15 minutes of the video so far but he obviously ca n't comment on these events exactly since it was released before the xpac . 
  thanks !, 
  these are the things i need to know man !, 
  would you mind just in a couple sentences summarizing what the first 15 or so quests i did in draenor were all about ? 
  it seemed somewhat important but i ca n't tell what is and is n't important in a lore that goes back more than a decade, 
  that 's terrific , thank you !, 
  i 've just finished lighting my sacrificial candles and now await xur 's blessings sitting on my floor surrounded by xur effigies . 
  99 % of the bounces from og halo 2 do n't work anymore , fyi, 
  [ here is a video showing his location / loot ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl2yumuttri&amp;list=plqewimtzn6ym-fb5tg3-g9hqdw0mbmlng&amp;index=1 ), 
  uh . . because ascension is fucking dope ? 
   i hope the forge community for the canvas maps really picks up, 
  it absolutely will , scripting adds a whole new layer of customization and [ people are already making introductory tutorials for it .

  \\ #notallhumans, 
  could you explain how ? 
  i 've even tried completely blank maps , plopping a hill marker down , a generic objective zone down , and a koth zone and marked them all as koth_hill and still none appear in a koth custom game . 
  over 1200 people thought the video was a 10/10 . . yup , this is / r/roosterteeth . 
  i started at around position 4500 i think , and it 's slowly ticking down . 
  i hope you 're right on that hour estimate but i 'm not at all confident , i 'm wondering if i 'll even be able to play before falling asleep and retrying tomorrow . 
  ** game over **, 
  play again ? 
  ( y/n ), 
   i spent a solid 2 minutes considering your comment and decided i agree, 
  the reddit scientific method . 
  . . what ? 
  there 's no fail about it , these gametypes are broken in it . 
  343 fails at forge . 
   these types of things are written to elicit fear int he part of the population that uses ignorance as a shield . 
  the founding fathers of this country would be appalled . 
  i do n't know it 's reading a little too euphoric for my taste . 
  does this game even show your overall k/d anywhere ? 
  i have n't found it . 
  shit that 's true . . 
  oh shit did n't even realize it was him , i 've seen his draw my life but not much else . 
  dude seems real nice and genuine but i 'm concerned being that weight for so long is going to lead to some real health issues if he does n't turn it around quick . 
  not even trying to be rude , just worried . 
  this guy gets it , there really does n't need to be so much taboo about it , we should all become prostitutes !, 
  hey man i 'm in total support , think you misunderstood my post buddy !, 
   it does n't give me consistent results . 
  what results are you receiving ? 
  i 've actually not yet experimented with detonating explosives via scripting . 
  yeah and now you 're in the fucking comments for said post , did you expect us to all be talking about climate change in here ? 
  idiot . 
  holy fuck , whats the source ? 
  no way its really the same guy ? 
  god damn i 'm not sure which of those people are worse at halo but the second one was labelled `` professional gameplay '' which was pretty funny . 
  so basically , everything bungie did was good and everything 343 did sucked . 
  i 'm on board with that . 
  thanks !, 
  the koala has two left hands, 
  ctrl + f ` yog ' and did n't find anything , who am i supposed to be searching for ? 
  sorry i do n't watch their stuff, 
  that sucks dude , have some gold !, 
  no no * i * do n't want to pay for it i just think he should have some . 
  was n't this like a kids show ? 
  what 's the point of having garrison resources anyways ? 
  i just got to nagrand and feel like i always have too many , i 'm sitting on ~ 1500 right now and have only ever spent like 10 here or 15 there to send my guys on missions . 
  what am i doing wrong ? 
  why did grommash not drink the demon juice from gul ` dan this time around ? 
  do the followers continue to level up when working in a profession building ? 
  better than most of their stuff imo, 
  your account is 3 years old . . 
  are n't they pretty much the same size ? 
  absolutely untrue . 
  you 're either too old to be getting yelled at by your parents for someone cussing or too young to have made a reddit account 3 years ago . 
  did they reset the ranks yet or is all of this still for nothing ? 
   did you hear about that police chase today ? 
  totally thought this was the setup for a joke . . 
  perfectly stated . 
  do n't worry they 're resetting ranks anyways . 
  lol is this a joke ?
