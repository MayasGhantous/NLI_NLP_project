  this would be the best possible reimbursement , but i very very much doubt they will do this as it will cost them * a lot * of money . 
  i mean compare the cost of producing new maps for free to say , extending the halo 5 beta which was already free in the first place . 
  i do n't know , i 'm not very hopeful . 
  that 'd be pretty legit actually . 
  if he 's anything like my mom he wo n't `` get the point '' of it and probably be bored quickly . 
  i 'd recommend something that instead has a clear and attainable goal so he feels like he 's accomplishing something each time he plays , but to each their own . 
   i do n't know why you are getting downvoted . 
  this is true . 
  you should never have to pay money to test a game in an alpha or beta state . 
  because a lot of people find dayz to be a really fun game actually , even in it 's current state . 
  in fact ** as of this post there are more people live streaming dayz on twitch than call of duty advanced warfare , halo mcc , destiny , far cry 4 or grand theft auto v ** , despite the fact that they are all massive aaa titles that just recently released . 
  the point of the op that people should be upset about is the practice that is becoming far too common of artificially raising a price just to call it a sale when it is lowered back down again , there is no need to be upset that the game is in an `` alpha '' state right now . 
  and the notion that he is getting downvoted is preposterous anyways since he is the top post of the thread . 
  insinuating the child support enforcement system works lel, 
  sorry but , what does sil mean ? 
  it 's not even the right meme . 
  thanks !, 
  troll account made today , everyone just move along . 
  okay so , i honestly have no clue what 's going on in ferguson right now because to be honest i do n't tend to get enthralled over sensationalized news stories from across the country ( i 'm surprised this much of reddit does ) , but . . 
  i heard that the black dude like broke into the car the cop was in first , is that not right ? 
  and if that * is * what happened , why would the cop not have the legal right to defend himself by any means ? 
  edit : every comment replying to me attempting to fill me in has negative karma , i 'm not sure how i 'm supposed to take that , does that mean they 're wrong or just that reddit does n't agree . . oh well i guess i 'll just go on with my life since everyone will forget any of this happened in like a month regardless . 
  double twist : no you do n't . 
  yours was n't so great . 
  just one memories ? 
  that 's literally what he just said, 
  i think asking `` why '' it 's bad is a little ridiculous , there 's no way any person could truly be comfortable being constantly watched and photographed and videod every time they go out in public . 
  but that being said i do agree with you , the money is worth it and apparently he thinks so as well seeing as he is still starring in films ( one this month i think ) , it 's not like he could n't take his millions and retire if he wanted . 
  robin williams has been famous for a long time , i wonder what he 's been up to recently . 
   chick looks russian/ukrainian . 
  wait that 's not jennifer lawrence ? 
  reminds me of [ this captcha comic ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ulxvwkq.png ) someone on / b / made .

  this made me laugh . 
  some of the replies in this thread are just idiotic . 
  except 0 people read it that way and in nearly 100 % of situations the oxford comma is completely unnecessary with even the smallest amount of context . 
  ** that .

  hey man maybe she wo n't , you do n't * know * her . 
  that 's the joke in the image . 
  she says , referring to dead people , `` at least they tried '' . 
  meaning every dead person has * failed * in her eyes , failed to live forever perhaps . 
  i 'm curious , what region are you in ? 
  do n't mind them , these kids have absolutely no ability to see the world from another point of view than their own . 
  i 'm not religious personally , but the comments in this thread are such an embarrassment , it 's the kind of thing i hope they stumble upon in a few years and think , `` wow what an ignorant twat i used to be . '', 
  at least we can hope . 
  little of column a , little of column b , i 'll do what i can to save your sinking ship . 
  you know everyone is saying to watch it but honestly for something as epic as star wars i really think it 's worth waiting a day to see it in crisp hd the first time around . 
  i actually started watching the video op linked until i realized half way through the disney intro that it was just a shitty cam recorded version , not worth it . 
  wait a second . . are you saying that the extent of our space exploration law is a `` dibs '' system ? 
  you sound like my grandma who thinks obama is trying to poison the food supply with chemtrails and put those who are unable to work into fema camps .

  paging / r/hailcorporate, 
  wait you actually slipped into a coma from drinking ? 
  could we get more details on that , how long were you out ? 
  you did n't hear ? 
  have you considered you might just have a fucked up family and that religion itself is n't fucked up ? 
   i have actually graduated college and you clearly have not, 
  he 's at the pvp vendor area . 
  i 'll post a comprehensive list here for the op to edit it in . 
  [ here is a video showing where he is and what all of the gear looks like equipped .

  ** here is the inventory ** -, 
  exotic weapon - plan c, 
  hunter armour - crest of alpha lupi, 
  warlock armour - voidfang vestements, 
  titan armour - the armermentarium, 
  exotic engram - gauntlens, 
  thanks / u/deathstrokecph, 
  as an audio pleb who just uses iphone earphones for everything on my computer , will i even tell the difference with something like this ? 
  i mean , surely the quality ca n't get better than what youtube or whatever can play in the first place , so is that thin margin between what any headphones could play and what these could play from what 's available really noticeable ? 
  legitimately thought i was in / r/hearthstone until you mentioned dps charts in like the 6th paragraph . 
  what are the odds the only item i wanted to look at has a broken link lol . 
  it 's the ram, 
  if i have just a middle of the road sound card will it still make a difference , or do i need an expensive sound system to really appreciate an increase in quality ?

  so . . she 's not wearing a shirt ? 
  he added them . 
   i believe you 're exaggerating a bit as well with your reductio ad absurdu -, 
  i fully expect them to disable or heavily moderate the comments , so this is n't really necessary . 
  who cares ? 
  just do n't read it , i do n't . 
  but if someone is spending their free time writing some erotic novella as a hobby and for no money , why should we get to decide they ca n't do that ? 
  that 's what i was thinking as well . 
  wait so , as a 20 year old dude , you are n't supposed to shake a baby ? 
  like ever ?
