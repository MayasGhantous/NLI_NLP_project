  i think i 'm missing something , but i 'll worry about it if/when i plan on having a kid .

  it 's all tomatos man . 
  [ nope !,

  [ here you go !, 
  you should go back and listen to ones he 's in , always stoked to see when he 's in a new one . 
  hope they end up hiring op instead of remaking it themselves , or at least provide some kind of compensation . 
  thanks but i think i 'll be the judge of that myself . 
  at my current rate i should be there in approximately 7 years . 
  i ca n't possibly imagine you would , but do you have a source that atheists ca n't hold office in the us ? 
  i mean , i 'm not a professional jokemaker or anything . . 
  wow that 's super interesting . 
  to be fair these are the states i 'd expect to have such legacy laws , and i highly doubt in 2014 any legislation will truly prevent someone from taking office for being an atheist . 
  texas made me laugh , it was * so close * to having it right :, 
   `` no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office , or public trust , in this state ; nor shall any one be excluded from holding office on account of his religious sentiments , provided he acknowledge the existence of a supreme being . '', 
  is it worth $ 400 ? 
  what makes it different from say , the nexus ? 
  to be honest i 'm going to use it for reddit , youtube and hearthstone ( when that comes to android next month !, 
  ) , i do n't give a fuck about photos really . 
  oh i 'll probably use netflix on it occasionally as well . 
  think i 'd like it ? 
  i 've never had a tablet before but have been borrowing my mom 's ipad mini for a couple weeks and fell in love with the idea of my own tablet . 
  more, 
   physically it does n't affect the animal much at all . 
  i find that incredibly hard to believe . 
  what would the physical effects be if you performed the operations on a human being ?

   tend to be sterile, 
  i 'm pretty sure they are always sterile , for the same reason mules are . 
  edit : the wording on wikipedia just says * most * mules are sterile , so maybe i do n't know shit . 
  think about the millions of dollars that could 've been saved if they had instead just installed a traffic light at the 4 way intersection . 
  aw , did you have to put the letters back on the correct hooks ? 
  / r/tall would appreciate this, 
  this kind of thinking is retarded but i 'm hoping it 's just because you 're young . 
  canines are routinely eaten all around the world , do you think these people would also have no moral objections to eating a person ? 
  do you ever think about the cows , chickens and other livestock ( maybe thanksgiving turkey ! ), 
  that was born , caged and then slaughtered for your food ? 
  but you take issue when some idiot abandons his dog outside ? 
  glad to see someone else is pointing it out as well . 
  these people have no moral objections to consuming the meat/animal products of cows , chickens and thanksgiving turkey but when some idiot abandons his dog outside suddenly it 's a crime against humanity . 
  they 're * both * terrible things . 
   less race bias than the bible belt, 
  having lived in both , i 'd say that heavily depends on what race you are . 
  exactly , did n't they also put the boston bombers on the cover of an issue ?

  i 'm not sure you meant for that to come off the way it did , but it made me laugh . 
  as someone who has lived in sd for years , i had no idea ha hung around anywhere around here . 
  i always pictured them in less urban areas . 
  exactly , did n't they also put the boston bombers on the cover of an issue ? 
  as another poster touched on , it 's a somewhat complicated situation . 
  i was born in hawaii and remember my brother would get regularly beaten up in the public school system for being white , or a [ `` haole '' ] ( http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=haole ) as they call them . 
  the point of my post was to say you obviously wo n't face much discrimination in the bible belt for being white ( as well as some other ethnicities ) , at least relative to hawaii . 
  thanks !, 
  i 'll keep an eye out . 
  unfortunately it looks like the nexus 9 is like $ 100 more , so i 'll have to think about it i suppose , tough decisions !, 
  when i did my first build about 8 months ago i started with 8.1 but ended up immediately uninstalling and going with 7 because the drivers for both my wifi card and parts of my mobo were n't compatible with the new os ( i even confirmed this by calling each of the manufacturers ) . 
  do you ever run into issues with software , games or hardware you use being unable to run on 8.1 due to lack of support or drivers , or do you think that that phase has mostly passed as 8.1 has been around a bit longer now ? 
  i still own a copy of 8.1 , do you think it 's worth upgrading to if my main purpose is gaming/recording ? 
  interesting , so as i said iirc my psu is `` bronze certified '' or something similar , is that like , the lowest possible rating or is there something lower ? 
  is something that is bronze certified capable of damaging the other hardware as you said could be possible with cheap units ? 
  as for the wattage i was a bit concerned about that as since i originally did the power calculations for my needs when purchasing the psu i 've since upgraded the gpu and added a couple hdd 's , do you think that would cause an issue or only really sli gpu 's ? 
  is there free software that i could download to see if my energy consumption is all kosher ? 
  i disagree with what others are saying . 
  i think if you have the capability to record high quality video then adding voice is n't a necessity , especially if the only point of added voice is just to do what most people in this sub do and overexaggerate reactions or make lame jokes throughout the vid . 
  take a look at the channel stats of the people giving you feedback and take that into consideration when making your decision . 
  now keep in mind there is some merit in the idea that you will reach a smaller audience without commentary but really it 's just more of a `` niche '' , it 's totally possible to see bigger numbers of views within this specific audience than say directly compete with the thousands of other channels doing `` let 's play '' style format where both the audience and competition are bigger . 
  but yeah if you are unable to record proper video ( and i 'm talking at least 1080p 60fps now that youtube shows it ) then you are going to have a * very * hard time without your voice to carry you . 
  as for connecting with your audience it will be a lot more difficult as you do n't want to bombard viewers with constant text on the screen , most of the viewers of videos without commentary could not care less about audience engagement in my experience , and are generally only watching to see the actual game being played . 
  if this is the case in your situation as well , i 'd recommend being active in the comments if you wish to engage people and asking what games/levels they 'd like to see next . 
  just my two cents , good luck !, 
  you may also like / r/thissubexists and / r/thissubreallyexists, 
   odd how that is considered `` making sense '' . 
  not really that odd when you consider the context at all . 
  yes , and if you 're taking the entirety of the bible at face value unless explicitly told not to , you really are n't understanding it at all . 
   dude why the hell are iggy azalea and ariana grande popular . . 
  is this how i know i 'm old ? 
  who the fuck are these people ? 
   85 is the most you expect to live ? 
  do you take issue with that ? 
  [ the country with the highest life expectancy in the world is still age 85 .

  excuse my ignorance , but is this person a legitimate cross-dresser or is it part of a bit , or is it a woman ? 
  i 've been meaning to pick up an e-cig for a while , but just want the bare minimum nicotine in each cartridge , for some reason i ca n't see on their site what the nicotine content is of each of their cartridges . 
  what are the expected duties of an ` office manager ' ? 
  thanks !, 
  i assume he got the shit beaten out of him for tattling . 
  he probably means shit like [ this ] ( http://youtu.be/jk0i8joonsg?t=4m17s ) and [ this ] ( http://youtu.be/jk0i8joonsg?t=2m58s ) ( both from the same cutscene ) . 
  i agree , i mean cortana was always a quick thinking battle-buddy that helped you progress through levels and understand the story , and 343 i think was really hamfisted in the way that every cutscene has to make you unlearn the fact that she 's just an ai , and make you really care about her ( and even sexualize her ) so that maybe you 'll be sad when she dies at the end . 
  poor story telling and does n't fit the overall halo narrative in my opinion , but to each their own . 
  did n't some dude in there say he was going to repost it and say it was an opal ? 
  i thought that 's what this was . . 
  wait so [ all of this is fake ?

  so this is a thing then . 
  i do n't know why but this is probably the funniest video i 've seen all month , and i already knew 360 no scoping was a thing .
