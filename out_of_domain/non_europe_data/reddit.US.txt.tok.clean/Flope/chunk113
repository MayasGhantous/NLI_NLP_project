   if the driver sees the sticks they 'll try to go around ... to where the cop is . 
  yeah no fucking thanks i 'd rather hit the spikes and get 10 years for evading arrest than 25 to life for killing a cop . 
  what country are you from that 80kph is the highest speed limit ? 
  i hope it 's not very big . 
  i guess my followup question would be , why would the weather channel spend the money to produce anti-poaching propaganda if none exists in the first place ? 
  do you think they are being directly paid for spreading the message , and if so by who ? 
  i do n't understand who benefits . 
  even if animal rights activists funneled tens of thousands of dollars into producing a video about a fake animal rights issue , what do they stand to gain ? 
  i find in sf it 's fairly easy to find any drug but it does n't tend to interfere with my life , is it really that different right in sj ? 
  if weed was legal . . why would there be ads for medical evaluations to get a prescription . . ? 
  edit : since i 'm posting on a comment with negative karma and no one will ever see this , then i 'd like to offer a word to my secret santa in case they are reading this . 
  i do n't smoke , despite being from san francisco , so i could do without any weed paraphernalia . 
  psychedelics however do fascinate me .

  ca n't say 100 % tuition but i got no financial assistance from friends or family and attended a 4 year university in san francisco . 
  ~ 70 % covered by scholarships and grants , the rest is loans .

  having lived in southern and northern california , ` cali ' is definitely used most in the sd area . 
  i taught elementary-middle schoolers and had a couple 9 year old students who identified as transgendered . 
  seemed a little young to make that kind of assessment but what do i know , it was san francisco after all . 
  note : i have no issue with anyone having any or no sexual orientation , but i do have to wonder at 9 years of age if it was really the kid 's discovering themselves or being persuaded on how to identify , as both of these kids had homosexual parents ( which i 'm fine with ) . 
  who knows . 
   we are enabling a generation of `` i do n't know what this word is , but i swear i am it '' children who are 10 years old and think they are special snowflakes with some awesome sexual adaptation .

  when they test for an allergy to say orange juice they are n't injecting straight oj into her , she could possible be allergic to whatever chemicals are used to contain and preserve the various allergens . 
  thanks !, 
  wait so if i bought a drone and attached a gopro , made a video and monetized on youtube , is that illegal ?

  oh no . . it really should have ended at 16 minutes . . 
   halo2 hitscan meant that if you 're reticle is red , all 3 br bullets will hit, 
  this ca n't be correct , i very often will only hit people with 1 or 2 br bullets of a burst even at close range with a red reticle if i 'm swinging my aim to the left or right , heck i just went in a custom game and confirmed it 's possible . 
  i said the same thing lol, 
  is this what i think it is, 
   i live in japan, 
  hey so as a westerner who would like to visit some day , i 'm learning japanese !, 
  between hiragana , katakana and kanji , which do you think is the most important to learn as a tourist walking around reading street signs and billboards ? 
  i 'm already able to identify and pronounce each hiragana character , and am working on katakana ( they 're usually somewhat similar ) , but in your op you said you only use either if the word in kanji is n't known ? 
  that 's a bummer kanji is like a totally different confusing thing to me, 
  as someone who had skin issues for years , i was willing to give anything a try if there was any hope it would help . 
  next time you run out of toothpaste why not just buy a brand without fluoride , what do you have to lose ? 
  if there 's no difference go back to your brand afterwards . 
  there 's thousands of `` cures '' posted all over the web to try and take advantage of people willing to spend money so be careful when buying products aimed at you specifically , the answer may really be just an adjustment you can make in your day to day such as switching pillowcases nightly , switching up the cleanser or toothpaste , etc. 
  for me i found cutting out dairy helped immensely ( and i tell people this to help them even if it means some armchair dermatologist will call it out as ` psuedoscience ' ) . 
  good luck !, 
   i 've got a story . 
  i was bored one night and my roommate suggested i do shrooms . 
  i was by my self , life sucked and i said fuck it . 
  ... became a new person . 
  more confident . 
  able to talk to girls and more . 
  made great friends and have been on a better ride since . 
  wow what a success story !,

  great , thanks !, 
  so far i 've been going through a course called human japanese , ever heard of it/have any thoughts ? 
  as for kanji , that 's where each character represents an entire word , correct ? 
  is there any rhyme or reason to when i could expect to see katakana used instead of kanji ? 
  `` gas stations and convenience stores always use katakana , but public transit like trains and buses use kanji '' or is it totally a toss up and everyone in japan is expected to know all 3 ? 
  awesome , thanks for all the advice !, 
  thanks !,

  i 'm the op so obviously biased but i agree with the sentiment that adding to the overall discussion and expanding the boundaries of what is possible in the raid is great !,
