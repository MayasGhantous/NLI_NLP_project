  hey so if anyone wants to get up there [ here is an easy method for doing it ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdceb5tnqnu ), 
  looks fine to me , i think everyone is just hopping on the bandwagon since kripp called it ugly in one of his videos . 
  i feel bad for the artist if he 's reading all this negative criticism because it really is an average looking card , not `` makes my eyes bleed '' quality at all imo . 
  hey not sure if you found another offer but i 've got a 500gb hdd , could overnight ship tomorrow . 
  is ryan 's footage at 20:40 and 21:00 out of order ? 
  how does he get full food/health in 6 seconds without anything to eat other than 2 mushrooms ? 
  i 'd say paramount , fox and warner bros could all disappear tomorrow and not have even 1 % of the impact that google would create if it were to disappear . 
  these are companies who primarily create media and entertainment vs the company that accounts for ~ 60 % of all internet traffic . 
  as far as i 'm concerned the aforementioned three are along for the ride and their biggest asset is their name , as it 's immediately recognizeable and well known . 
  sony and disney however are giants who actually are more closely involved in the same nuanced industries as google , which makes this very interesting . 
  for example , disney owns maker studios , i.e. 
  a giant percentage ( relatively speaking ) of the large popular channels on youtube ( including the pewds ) , so it 's interesting to see them directly confront google like this . 
  whoever comes out on top , people need to realize that it is still a corporation ( s ) who will win and which exists primarily to generate money , not look out for the welfare of the public . 
  though in this case , i think my interests align more closely with google 's , so good luck to them . 
  is that really true ? 
  do you have a source ? 
  if paramount/universal stop producing movies , other people will fill the void . 
  new businesses and studios would open up to fill the gap left behind by the receding corporations . 
  alternatively , every minute there are 100 hours of video uploaded to youtube . 
  each day their content id system ( which apparently is n't good enough for anti piracy ) combs through * 400 years * of video . 
  something like that does n't just bounce back in a day . 
  he means * real * europe . 
  there 's a reason aircraft have transponders , and that reason is when you 're going ~ 650mph ( just commercial flight speed , military could be much faster ) in one direction it 's hard to see another object flying 650mph from a different direction and understand fast enough that about a mile in front of you there is a point where your paths will intersect . 
  look up any interviews of pilots who have survived air collisions , it 's always something along the lines of `` everything was clear , not a cloud in the sky , and we could see for miles ahead of us , then out of the corner of my eye i saw a black spec in the distance , and the next second we were spiraling towards the earth . '', 
  it 's a nice bridge , mint condition and for a small fee it could all be yours . 
  thanks , i feel like some people did n't know that i knew he would know what i know he means , and that they would think that i did n't know what he knows and wanted others to know that he knows what i mean . 
  christ i 'm really dissappointed in abc news 24 right now , they are really drumming up a lot of unnecessary drama . 
  this poor employee there being asked hypothetical questions like , `` could you imagine if you had gone to work today ? 
  that could be you right now . . '' not helping anyone or providing any information on the situation , just sparking more fear . 
  shame on them . 
  / r/hailcorporate, 
  why does it look like he has no eyes, 
  only the * cool * ones . 
  makes sense now , thanks !, 
  actually the enrage timer does n't start until you exit the door , so this does n't detract any time from the overall fight . 
  i definitely recommend this for any raid attempting to down him , regardless if you 've done it fine before , there 's no reason not to make it a simpler fight . 
  agreed i 'd say the most difficult part is coordinating crota 's shields going down with the swordbearer getting ready to attack , but removing the relic management from the fight just seems to make everything else a lot more laid back and manageable , definitely no reason * not * to do it imo . 
  ` tis the season , let others share in our glitchmas !, 
  if it makes you feel better , someone must have told you how to do it and they were likely told by someone else who may have seen this video . 
  that 's awesome . 
  i know what the people want . 
  though maybe not since this post has been inexplicably downvoted by like 10 + people . 
  sorry for helping , guys !, 
  on behalf of all americans , you do n't fucking represent all of us . 
  [ i 've already got you tagged as a dummy .

  how young are you ? 
  source ? 
  thanks !, 
  was it ever even announced for the amazon app store ? 
  she should just shop at a nice family oriented store like target . 
  of course it 's in sf . . 
  do drugs , be gay and make a tech startup .

  is there any way to tell why/when i marked you as a ` friend ' ? 
  i 've only done that a small handful of times in the years i 've been on reddit . 
  what 's really unique or weird about you ? 
  you did n't really miss anything except a recent joel podcast which was pretty funny , if you find joel funny . 
  well the sentence right before that one spoke to the fact that it 's nearly impossible to get real statistics out of cuba due to government sanitization . 
  definitely see this dude running in 2016 , he 's a good public speaker . 
  obama ? 
  oh i see how it is , could n't possibly be that maybe * i * bought * you * gold !, 
   a few years ago, 
  * feels old *, 
  what does that last one mean ? 
  he 's suggesting that due to the fact that apple products usually feature hardware/features that are already outdated upon release , it 's ironic for someone who supports that practice ( by buying these products ) to make fun of the idea of older technology being used today . 
  not that i necessarily agree with him . 
  then how will i know if i 'm getting a good price for my comcast mega hd ? 
  that 's ^ not ^ how ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ law ^ ^ ^ ^ works, 
  i totally thought he was talking about the camera flash . . 
  oh my god that was totally it !, 
  where are my snacks i 've been starving !, 
  ha alright , one day when i see madmar14 on the cover of time magazine you best believe i 'm reminding you of your snack offer . 
  fantastic , thanks !, 
  i know you 're joking , but that seriously puts a whole new almost-plausible crazy twist on his last words . 
  do n't feed the trolls . 
  racists are dumb because they stereotype an entire group of people by tying them to a negative idea . 
  fascinating , and thanks for the list of sources !, 
  people like you are the reason they still exist . 
  area codes in the us , [ here 's how they break down in california .

  fuck i was about to write this , anyways i 'm with you . 
  just the one . 
  [ here you go ] ( https://www.bulletproofexec.com/dr-robert-rowen-treating-ebola-ozone-therapy-168/ ) , and [ here ] ( http://www.newsmaxhealth.com/health-news/ozone-therapy-ebola-howard/2014/09/26/id/597160/ ), 
  that does n't even make sense . 
  i recommend * silent spring * by rachel carson ; i had to write a 10 page paper on the book a few years back . 
  that 's what he just said , he 's asking why . 
  i think he 's curious why some people would have a higher caloric expenditure than others with a similar level of activity . 
  if you are worried or concerned your mother might be overpaying or being scammed by purchasing ` organic ' food only , then do some research into the start of the organic food craze and learn what * actually * matters when choosing two different producers of the same food . 
  you will find that while ( unfortunately ) the term `` organic '' has been co-opted by corporations as a way to push food under the guise of ` naturalness ' , there are in fact many added chemicals , untested genetic modification practices and unsafe pesticides that are added to many foods , but do not necessarily fall along the line of organic vs non-organic . 
  of course if you just wanted an article to shove in your mom 's face to prove she 's wrong , then go fuck yourself and treat your mother right . 
  but what about certain medical conditions or treatments that may be the cause or greatly exacerbate weight loss/gain , are you at all familiar with what is happening on a chemical level in these instances ? 
  genuinely curious . 
  not bad . 
  but there * are * exceptions , why ? 
  absolutely fascinating , thanks !, 
  we 've spent all of our r&d on improving skyboxes . 
  unfortunately tor is no longer ( and perhaps never ) secure , so if this new method is truly anonymous , that is a quality it would not share with the tor network . 
  edit : the downvotes make me chuckle , are people upset to learn that all the weird shit they thought they were safe doing online is actually completely able to be monitored by the fbi , or did people just not google before downvoting ?
