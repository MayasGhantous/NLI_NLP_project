  fuck if you had a plane ticket from the us i 'd join you in a heartbeat , have fun !, 
   the cancellation of the movie is directly affecting us , while the cia torture reports are not . 
  okay lol, 
  is this in sf ? 
  i think i know that girl, 
  just saw this movie for the first time , i wonder how many times reddit has referenced it and my reflexes were n't fast enough to catch it . 
  but ca n't you only be a rematcher if you already signed up for the regular secret santa exchange ? 
  the resolution, 
  as if this was n't already my number one fear . 
  i voted gary johnson last election , iirc he actually got the 3rd most votes ( behind romney & obama ) which surprised me , around 1.3 million . 
  i see another poster below has already posted a bit about the libertarian party , which i generally find i align myself with more closely than repub/demo . 
  there is no official comic-con just so you know . 
  what is the primary claim that these people make ? 
  did these events never happen at all , were they simply faked similar to the moon landing idea ? 
  if so do they think it was in order to defame the nazi party or to empower jewish people ? 
  fascinating , really . 
  i do n't really like the presumptuous nature of some of this script , or how authoritative the narrator speaks at certain parts . 
  the footage is incredible though , but i must admit i do n't understand how some shots have sound and others do n't , was the sound edited in late or were some of the scenes recorded with equipment capable of capturing audio while others were n't ? 
  i imagined it was something like this , thanks for the info op !, 
  yep destiny has got the strongest aim assist i 've ever felt in a game of it 's kind , it 's pretty crazy but i think it allows them to get away with some of these crazy big machine guns they have and stuff like fusion rifles . 
  yes the damage difference is big in even a couple of levels , but really it came down to the skill/strategy of the group , especially in this part of the raid as killing enemies is n't even the main challenge . 
  interesting , thanks for the info !, 
  i think everyone is bored of destiny at this point . 
  how do you get away with monetizing videos other people recorded for your funny moments series , do you seek each person 's individual permission or is it fair use ? 
  read this , [ refreshed my front page . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/2puapu/alfred_hitchcocks_memory_of_the_camps_very_nsfw/ ), 
  does n't feel like it where i live . 
  number 2 was n't an `` oversight '' as many people seem to think , but an intentional design choice in order to keep people coming back and playing each week . 
  number 8 and 9 are also anti-investment as they allow players to reach their goals faster , the opposite of what blactivision wants . 
  the rest i agree with but it seems most would require somewhat significant technical investment considering how long ago the game released . 
  do n't hold your breath . 
  read up on qualitative vs quantitative data and get back to me , dear . 
  i do n't get it that does n't answer my question . 
  i 'm employed , and at a company that pays me enough to not be stuck in some shithole like west cobb in a shit city . 
  good day . 
  i have to admit i did n't play much halo 4 , but i 've put a countless amount of hours into all the other halo games , and destiny 's aim assist blows them out of the water . 
  interesting , thanks !, 
  oh sorry , i was specifically talking about another series he produces which seems to feature clips from many different people , i believe i clarified that in my post . 
  represent !, 
  has there been an update ? 
  i 've never been lucky my entire life , i 've been saving it all for this moment . . 
  i 'd give a million people one dollar . 
  wow i ca n't believe that worked , my paypal has never been so full !, 
  stop talking . 
  unfortunately the sun has cancer . 
  that was terrific, 
  forgot for a second that women are n't people . 
   its all scripted . 
   but if you can get past that and just enjoy the premise, 
  it 's just like wrestling !, 
  there 's no answer , unless you 're a guy . 
  * jingle bells !, 
  * mermaid man smells !, 
  * barnacle boy laid an egg !, 
  * the invisible boatmobile lost a wheel , *, 
  * and the bad guy got awaaaay !, 
  how do you check ? 
  we 'll just have a separate mars intranet most likely , with connections to data on earth made less frequently . 
  who is the artist ? 
  is there a reason the ` solution ' button is grayed out ? 
   the catch is to have this low fee a person would need to be handling their bitcoins themselves , and would be 100 % liable to losing them all with no recourse if they fuck up their it security just once . 
  that 's the same as regular money . . unless your entire net worth stuffed under your mattress . 
  the post seems to corroborate what antinode _ is saying , look at the comments op made for halo 1 , halo 2 and halo 3 and compare those to halo 4 and halo 2 : anniversary . 
  are you serious because i 've been holding it up to my ear for the last 20 or so minutes and have only heard one thing that kind of sounded like a whoosh ? 
  the guy in the teal shirt 's left hand confuses me a bit when he bends down . 
  but the bear is fucking fantastic , definitely my favorite along with the one in the middle . 
  great work !, 
  oh no you 're right , i meant to agree with the guy who said halo 1 - 3 did n't change accuracy due to scoping , but thanks for writing it out on my account c :, 
  i do n't think you get what that sub is . 
  it 's not , he brought it up like ~ 12 podcasts ago , i 'm not sure which one unfortunately . 
  `` good , uhhh , for you sir . '', 
  fuck the oside police . 
  holy shit that explains why british people have bad teeth , that just kind of blew my mind . 
  obviously . 
  i had this problem with my first prison and ended up just starting over , let me know if/how you fix it , good luck !, 
  thank god , i had closed the tab on accident then came back and it was removed . 
  `` will yo umar ryme ? 
  the fuck is that supposed to mean ? '', 
  that 's not his son . 
  science confirmed . 
  it 's not worth the bounty , such a pain in the ass,
