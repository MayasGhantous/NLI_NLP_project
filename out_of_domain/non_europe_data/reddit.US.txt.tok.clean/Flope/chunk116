  at least you 're consistent . 
  or maybe you 're both hideous and give lots of compliments ?? 
  there are many options , stay optimistic !, 
  i 'm six and a half feet tall and yeah bmi is really completely inaccurate if you are above or below the average range for height . 
  my bmi puts me in the upper bounds of normal weight just as you , when i am very clearly underweight for my height ( taller than you and weigh less ) . 
  am i missing something ? 
  the link is to a video of a bunch of dudes playing the wolf among us for like 25 minutes ?

  this is the top comment every fucking time . 
  crazy idea : how about you do n't fucking work at walmart ? 
  i pronounce it exactly how it 's spelled every time and it annoys the fuck out of me when i realize it 's a completely different word . 
   being a homosexual is no more dangerous than being a heterosexual . 
  you 're far more likely to contract hiv , which can turn into aids .

  it 's possible before and during the fight . 
  i 've done it during the fight , you just jump around the horn . 
  probably not , but it seems to be the only way to reach the gatekeepers if that is your goal . 
  could n't wait 3 more years . . 
   no use condemning north korea or sanctioning them . 
  why do n't you educate yourself on world affairs before getting angry about something that is n't even the case . 
  nothing should be done , though i fear that will not be the case . 
  i predict western intervention , disclosed or otherwise , within the next 2 years . 
   as daughter to one of the richest family in korea, 
  it 's my buddy 's , i 'll be sure to pass along the compliment !, 
  i bet i will .

  jordan is definitely one of my favorite people to see appear in stuff , he does n't get enough screen time and i probably would n't have watched this ( not a huge fan of the show ) if it were n't for him . 
  just seems more relaxed and genuine than the super amped up over the top attitudes of the other cast . 
   i think they 'd be more appalled at the devolution of the english language . 
  every generation has their own slang , i 'm sure they would n't be too bothered by it .

  weird , i guess it must be a regional thing . 
  i assume the price we have up here is equal to whatever the price you guys have online is . 
  you ca n't afford it . 
   i was a stupid kid once too , but there was no facebook or twitter or the likes . 
  also you were n't a movie star so likely no one would give a shit regardless . 
  double check your math . 
  likely accrues karma on accounts then sells them for astroturfing purposes . 
  so yes , could be getting paid . 
   people with poor credit probably ca n't afford to put four new tires on a car and detail it, 
  lol, 
  kind of funny to see someone giving smoking advice warning about cancer lol . 
  how could there be a source for that ? 
  in what way can you measure the amount of unreported crimes ? 
  would n't the lower conviction rates in western countries imply that there are more false rape accusations ?

  one of the moderators was the owner of quickmeme.com , so when users submitted a meme made on that site there were provisions setup to automatically upvote those images and downvote ones made from competing sites . 
  when it came out there was a huge backlash and / r/adviceanimals banned quickmeme.com links in order to retain the influence of being a default sub today . 
  reddit in general is awry with astro turfing from companies because the way the voting system and communities are setup makes it one of the most effective ways to to advertise and promote product placement , since people wrongly assume that every upvote is genuine , so with every point on a post is `` one other person who agrees this is good '' . 
  you can see the macy 's post with the farmers that was the # 1 post on all of reddit just today or yesterday . 
  taco bell and mcdonalds both ran campaigns of astro turfed posts about a year ago , with posts featuring each rising to the front page almost every day for a week . 
  olive garden also does a lot of viral marketing through reddit . 
  even in slightly smaller subs you have corruption , such as the fact that one of the moderators in / r/halo runs his own youtube channel and uploaded a video showing all of the new halo game cutscenes . 
  other members who did the same and posted links had theirs removed , and now due to a link to the video appearing in a stickied thread for a while it is the # 1 search result on youtube for the cutscenes , with almost 2 million views . 
  ** tl ; dr : ** always be skeptical . 
  if you see something that does n't quite seem right , think about that . 
  it 's too bad this post is so buried likely no one will read it . 
  if people are interested [ i posted a little bit up the page about some reddit-specific examples of astro turfing by companies on this site .

  have you tried killing a cockroach ? 
  `` we 'll just kill all those and then try communicating with this furry thing over here to see if there are any intelligent beings . '', 
  why would mice be attracted to antifreeze , does it smell good or something ? 
  there was an article in the news recently about a girl who fell down a well and was trapped , and so someone went in to save her but became trapped as well , so someone went in to save them and became , trapped . 
  i think altogether like 4 people died .

   sometimes i think maybe the kindest thing we could do would be to torch the rainforests and everything in it , just to end the dreadful cycle of suffering once and for all . 
  this is how evil villains are born . 
  probably like 30 % less than a pile of beef the same weight i imagine . 
  why not let the reptiles do it ? 
   gandhi might have something to say about that . 
  i really did n't think i 'd ever have to tell someone this but . . ghandi already died . 
  he died a while ago , i 'm sorry . 
  huh . 
  so i mean , does it actually taste good ? 
  no but that 's a pretty bizarre one as well . 
  hm , i wonder if it 'd be any good mixed with like some jaeger or something , maybe clear rum . 
   i 'm the youngest and i have like 20 nephews and nieces, 
  hmm ... 
  can confirm , went to high school with two disney princesses,
