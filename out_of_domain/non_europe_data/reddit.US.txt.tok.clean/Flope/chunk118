  i 'm upvoting with all my might , that will show them !, 
  how do you know that ? 
  plenty of airliners go over the same path every single day , you do n't have even the slightest suspicion that shooting a specific one down out of thousands might have been due to a specific passenger on board ? 
  you think a russian rocket just happened to be in the neighborhood when the plane was there ? 
   he 's full of shit , the uk and france combined would ** outmatch ** russia, 
  this is literally the funniest shit i have read all day . 
  \\  mfw the uk & france combined have ~ 360,000 reserve millitary personnel, 
  \\  mfw russia has 2.5 million, 
  \\  mfw the uk & france combined have ~ 900 tanks, 
  \\  mfw russia has 15,500, 
  \\  mfw the uk & france combined have ~ 450 attack planes, 
  \\  mfw russia has 1,289, 
  \\  mfw the uk & france combined have 116 [ mlrs vehicles ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/m270_multiple_launch_rocket_system ), 
  \\  mfw russia has ** 3,781 **,

   if russia , china , iran , and north korea wanted to go for europe they would almost certainly win, 
  north korea would add nothing to the table , but it 's ridiculous to say they would almost certainly win , they would obviously roll over europe in one of the most decisive international engagements to date . 
  it would not even be a battle , it would be a massacre . 
  you can see my response [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/2s0ci0/flight_mh17_was_downed_by_the_53rd_russian_air/cnl9p10 ) to the poster above that believed france + uk could defeat a russian military . 
  europeans in general seem to far overestimate their country 's military power , mostly because it has been gimped due to the us insisting on providing military strength to these nations so that they would n't have to . 
  it 's a win-win , these countries save trillions of dollars from not needing to maintain a huge military , and the us remains the most powerful military in the world by ensuring it 's allies do n't have to . 
  if push comes to shove and one of the us ' allies fall out of favor , they wo n't be an issue to be taken care of . 
  if it comes out that the us is spying on politicians from allied countries across the eu , no one has the fortitude to demand action against it . 
  oh , your question seemed kind of rhetorical and mean spirited anyways so i figured i 'd take a stab in the dark . 
  were you looking for a specific number from `` how much should they have been paid exactly ? '', 
  that seems kind of ridiculous . 
  nothing is ` randomly shot down ' by a superpower , there must have been a reason . 
   both could out produce russia . 
  a reasonable assertion , until you consider the fact that the uk is the eu 's # 1 oil supplier , but still relies on importing over ** 1 million barrels a day ** from other countries , one main contributor being russia . 
  france does not even produce 1/3 of it 's domestic energy needs and also imports from russia . 
  even without oil the idea of out-producing another nation is not necessarily as closely tied to gdp as you think , even in a vacuum russia alone has a manpower of nearly 70 million to france 's 28.8 million . 
  no one is doubting that france + uk would be a giant and formidable military power , but the notion that they would `` outmatch russia '' all things considered is ridiculous to put it bluntly . 
   take a look at american numbers , would you argue russian forces are stronger than theirs ? 
  the us is far ahead of russia in most aspects of numbered military resources . 
   numbers mean nothing in 21st century warfare . 
  i 'm going to assume you realize how ridiculous that sounds . 
   iraq is a case in point right there . 
  in less than 3 weeks after declaring war , us forces had control of baghdad , the nation 's capitol . 
  it was a perfectly executed * shock and awe * strategy played by coalition forces . 
  the decision to remain in iraq due to the idea that the us could somehow exterminate al qaeda 's influence within the nation was a massive intelligence failure and a logistical nightmare , but that 's not really relevant to the idea that france and the uk would just bowl over russia with their military . 
  i think eve is a fantastic game . 
  as for the tag , [ i have a serious problem . 
   i suspect many americans do n't fully grasp the disparity in the possibility of ukraine being invaded by russia and the possibility of a country like the uk or germany being invaded . 
  no one is suggesting russia could successfully invade the uk and france , that would be a nightmare just geographically speaking . 
  * you are the one * who is saying that the two of them `` would outmatch russia '' , which no matter how you want to spin the numbers is such an outlandish idea that i was n't sure if it was sarcasm at first . 
  thanks for proving that you truly believe this , tagged . 
  also , i 'm taking my upvote * back !, 
  did you reply to the right comment ? 
  if anything what you 're suggesting more closely aligns itself to what i 'm saying than the person i replied to . 
  obligatory / r/thesefuckingaccounts, 
  [ here is gallowboob 's post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/thesefuckingaccounts/comments/2s1kve/ugallowboob_over_26_link_submissions_in_the_last/ ), 
  thank you for not just saying * whoosh * , i tag people that do and whenever i come across them on this site i try and make their a day a little worse . 
   he had a gremlin type dude pop into view and peel away the corner of his periphery revealing a different reality . 
  the gremlin thing kept saying `` this is the real world '' when he showed him what was behind the peeled away reality , then would put it back and say `` this is the fake world . '', 
  freaked my friend the fuck out . 
  this is why we ca n't have nice realities . 
  you 've brought this upon yourself . 
  the camera was moving and there was a camera flash . . was this some kind of anti-drug demonstration ? 
  windows do n't usually break with that little force . 
  thanks !, 
   italy alone has more aircraft carriers than russia . 
  let 's be real , you know anyone who skims through these posts will not understand the numbers we 're talking about here . 
  so you would agree with my assessment it seems . 
  hey thanks , so i have a really noob question here and i 'm kind of embarrassed to ask but , where exactly would this setting be located ? 
  is it in the bios , control panel , etc ? 
  the link only compares france and russia yes , but you 'll see that all of the numbers provided in my post correctly correspond to france + uk . 
  i agree that the eu ( russia is part of europe ) is of course not defenseless , the countries that make it up wield a terrific amount of power . 
  but i maintain that if france + uk went to war against russia , with no allies on either side , you would be a fool to bet on the french/brits . 
  usb suspension was enabled , turned it off and now my phone correctly being detected !, 
  hooray !, 
  for some reason the ipad is being detected when plugged in but still showing ` not charging ' on it 's screen , probably something incorrectly configured with the ipad itself . 
  what an odd setting to be enabled by default , thank you so much for the help !, 
   also russia is n't a superpower anyways . 
  i 'm done having this conversation . 
  so long as we agree then i guess . 
   my house got destroyed by a tornado last year ( illinois ) . 
  we did n't even go downstairs, 
  are ... are you dead ? 
  they likely sell the accounts to companies for astroturfing , it 's a bigger business than most people would guess . 
   i dont see why a spammer would want a high karma account though ? 
  there are provisions in place to prevent low karma ( or new ) accounts from posting and submitting links as frequently as accounts with higher karma . 
   i 've never seen any spam come from this type of account , and obviously commercial posts would get downvoted no matter who posted them ... 
  they 're used for astroturfing , so it 's not like all of a sudden they will start submitting links to www.mcdonalds.com / telling people to buy mcnuggets , but instead a submission will show up on / r/pics like `` so this is a thing ... '' with a picture of some new hidden mcd 's menu item or some shit . 
  companies do it all the time ( successfully ) on reddit and these posts routinely hit the front page , macy 's and olive garden both have posts from the last week actually , so when people say they 've `` never seen any spam '' , what it really means is they have n't noticed . 
  the ^ more ^ ^ you ^ ^ ^ know, 
  itt : everyone nation should operate the way ( i think ) mine does . 
  i actually heard about this guy on the news , apparently he 's serving two life sentences with possibility of death row for the purse robbery . 
  you 're right , any criminal in their right mind would have gone for the 6 ' 8 '' black body builder carrying a handbag . 
  thank you so much !, 
  yeah i 'm saying in my hypothetical story the black man is strong ; so racist . 
  if you make up a story about a white girl who likes frappuccinos and instagram , i might just be triggered . 
  you 'll soon be the first doctor to have a million karma . 
  i can say i was there . . a faceless voice in the crowd . 
  fcking every time i come here to post a link i 've been beaten . 
  probably too long to fit in the title, 
  we 're gon na [ have a problem ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/adviceanimals/comments/2s0e4a/i_audibly_cringed/cnlbaun ) if we keep redditing in the same areas . 
  should n't you be going to sleep ? 
  he 's also making up to $ 42,000 a year just from these stupid youtube videos , op is a dummy . 
  you just have to get in there early enough .
