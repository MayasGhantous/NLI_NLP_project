  redditor 's feelings about a post are almost completely at the whim of the first 5 top comments they see , so if all of the top comments are saying `` wow i hope one day i 'll be as strong as this woman , you tell your mom to keep up the great work ! '', 
  then someone who comes in and says `` post it to facebook this is sob story pos '' is seen as a troll looking for attention and downvoted . 
  also , as always , [ it 's all about the phrasing .

  statistically i think you 'll get your wish . 
  who in london is most popular ? 
   on the planet ? 
  do n't you mean in america ? 
  what are you implying . . 
  i 'm ron burgundy ? 
  hm , out of all those i 've only heard of ricky gervais here in the us . 
  who do you think would be the most popular english speaking comic in the world right now ? 
  for me it usually goes :, 
  *** game begins ***, 
  `` sorry about that . '', 
  `` sorry about that . '', 
  `` sorry about that . '', 
  `` sorry about that . '', 
  *** game ends ***, 
  `` hello . '', 
  `` hello . '', 
  `` hello . '', 
  well he 's got 1600 upvotes and no one will read your comment or mine , so he probably feels fine . 
   how is causing your passenger to urinate themselves a selling point ? 
  because they 're targeting people who think the bike will make them look aggressive or intimidating , or at least stand out which is probably harder to do in china . 
  in this case the ad is specifically saying that people who own the bike are `` brave '' , implying they can control such a beast . 
  also anything that vibrates . . 
  hopefully the next time it 's reposted it will correctly identify it as a chinese ad . 
  what a piece of shit no-info article . 
   recommend not pre-ordering games that do n't have actual gameplay footage out before release, 
  oh like the master chief collection !, 
  yeah they even held a tournament on twitch before release , good thing i followed your advice and bought it !, 
  haha i have you tagged as `` yep '' . 
  did n't get it until i read your username . 
  i love past me . 
  yes .

  i went to the link and read a couple responses down and [ stumbled upon myself from the past !, 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/iama/comments/1ujvrg/jerry_seinfeld_here_i_will_give_you_an_answer/cejfziy?context=4 ) just chilling there with a few karma , i do n't even remember posting a reply in this ama , how exhilarating . 
  did you do it ? 
  great writeup , thanks !, 
  i 'm leaning towards final stand or dragon 's teeth from what i 've seen of the videos . 
  do you know where i can buy the expansions individually ? 
  when i hit ` buy ' on ea 's site it only offers me the premium edition . 
  thanks for the links !, 
  perhaps , but people are arguing what the ` correct ' pronunciation is when we already know , regardless if we think it was `` dumb '' or not . 
  how about sc ** u ** ba ? 
  the u stands for underwater , but we do n't pronounce the word with a soft u , we say scuba with a strong u because that 's the way the person who invented it said it was pronounced . 
  yes he did / s, 
  seriously . 
  i hate to sound like a douche , but if your parents all of a sudden ca n't afford to give you a free ride through college , that 's not an `` i should drop out '' level of `` financial struggles '' . 
  itt : republicans are bad and democrats are good . 
  oh right i 'm on reddit . 
  you can inherit certain types of debt in the us , just not student loan debt .

   halo being ass now does n't mean xbox in general has to . 
  why would someone buy an xbox if not for halo ? 
  yeah i was surprised when i equipped it , the little thumbnail for it is all brown weirdly enough . 
  thanks , glad you enjoyed it !,

  yeah the way i look at it is , this sparrow * could have been * a lot cooler , but as it is , it is still my favorite looking one so far . 
  indeed it does , my only wish is that it were a little bit faster . 
  i 'm sure a god would n't see it that way any more than i consider crushing my playdough figurines as xenocide when i 'm done playing . 
  his response always rubbed me the wrong way here . 
  like yeah , we get it , it 's kind of `` low brow '' to prefer well done steak in the culinary world , but that does n't mean you should just shit all over the idea of people preferring it , i mean you 're a god damn restaurant owner . 
  i mean if someone wanted chicken tenders would he just throw a chicken in the fireplace then put it on a dish , with it 's blackened feathers still on it ? 
  `` well honestly if you do n't prepare a chicken like x , y and z , it loses all the taste anyways , so what do you care ? '', 
  give me a break dude , watch the video and tell me you honestly ca n't tell the difference between the steak shown and a proper well-done steak . 
  i 'm not talking about the taste , because i was n't there , i 'm talking about what it looks like . 
  wait . . 
  i do n't understand . 
  it sounds like you 're saying i should do it because it 's insecure ? 
  am i being whooshed or something ? 
  ama request ? 
  in what way are they less open about it if some dude named / u/use _ the_dick is rattling off a list of every country involved ? 
  wtf over half ?? 
  i do n't understand how this works . . so if i make $ 1,000,000 one year , and i spend half of it on expenses , i 'll actually end up with less money than i had at the start of the year ? 
  is n't it kind of weird that we 're using 40 year old missiles ? 
  i mean imagine all of the technology that has been invented in the last 40 years . . the internet , touch screens , mobile phones , snapchat . 
  you 're telling me there 's nothing that could be improved upon in these missiles in the last half of a century ? 
  does that mean disneyland spreads nationalism ? 
  we here in the us have streamlined this process by not bothering to implement these types of programs in the first place so that we can give a [ bigger slice of the pie for guns and stuff !, 
  ] ( http://blogs.lclark.edu/hart-landsberg/files/2014/07/discretionary-spending.jpg ) in 2013 the us alone accounted for more than 1/3 of the total amount of money spent by every country 's military combined . 
  hooray !, 
  do n't be ridiculous , even if the majority of reddit was in favor of something it 's not like [ we would upvote the same thing to the front page every day of every week for a month ] ( http://www.reddit.com/search?q=vaccine&amp;sort=top&amp;t=week ) . 
  could you explain which part you believe is deceiving ? 
  it 's literally a pie chart of the 2013 discretionary budget , i do n't think i 've ever heard of a pie chart being called deceptive .
