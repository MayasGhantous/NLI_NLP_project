   present yourself in a confident way , being comfortable in your own skin, 
   consider , also , what kind of person it makes you to expect to be ` checked out ' - arrogant ? 
  entitled ? 
  would you mind explaining how one can achieve being comfortable and confident about his looks but not arrogant or entitled by expecting other people to share the same sentiment ? 
  california lingo for anyone curious :, 
  a ` dub ' is a `` 20 sack '' . 
  meaning a sack ( ziploc bag ) of weed worth $ 20 . 
  depending on who you buy from and the quality of the bud ( marijuana ) that is usually 1.5 - 2.5 grams . 
  as far as the amount usually purchased at a time , usually people will pitch together money to buy a larger sack and therefore get a better deal , think small-scale wholesale . 
  though if just one person is buying , a dub ( see above ) is a very common quanitity ( for average smokers ) . 
  source : lived in socal and smoked weed daily for 4 years . 
  since quit . 
  they do n't even * it * ? 
   a safe * bet * is anything under 200mg is n't bad , 200-300mg is risky, 
  to anyone thinking of trying mdma for the first time , do some research first as even small amounts could be potentially dangerous to certain users with various limitations ( i.e.

  there 's a version out there where it is a bunch of girls on all hands/knees on a beach eating eachother out . 
  someone reply to this post if you have it,

  nice try !, 
  not falling for this one !, 
  i would judge the fuck out of someone if what i use bing for popped up on their profile . 
  they 've probably got bigger fish to fry than some dumbass buying drugs online . 
  if anything my greatest fear would be that they would go after the seller , the buyer not so much . 
  yeah , i thought it was more prevalent and that more people would get the joke . 
  that shit has flooded my facebook . 
  perhaps i should wait a few days and repost this when everyone is familiar with it haha, 
  `` why the fuck is this dumbass carrying about 7 ender chests ? '',
