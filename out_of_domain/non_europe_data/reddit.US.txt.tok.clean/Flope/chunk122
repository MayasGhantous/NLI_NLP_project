  whenever i check the source of a comment and see someone tried to return to the next line but did n't i like to spread the info . 
  thanks for this comment , i thought the same thing . 
  the site exists but i 'm pretty sure they were bought out . 
  rip, 
   as a doctor , this look like, 
  a big factor as well is that she was `` covered in quilts '' . 
  that would significantly dampen the blow and spread the energy over a larger area than if it had just directly connected with her hip bone . 
  i 'll do $ 3.50, 
  there 's a garbage collection joke in there somewhere . 
  edit : thanks !, 
  `` yes , you 're buying the palmolive . 
  now get the fuck out of here . '', 
  yes he was ; but at the same time the movie is called signs due to strange patterns appearing in the crop circles . 
  typical alien stuff . 
   i can type 55 words a minute, 
  you misunderstood what he is saying . 
  all of the people who donated to bernie could also have donated the same or a greater amount to hillary , it just wo n't show because hillary 's smallest donation on the list is twice as large as bernie 's largest donation .

  thanks for the advice !, 
  i 've been hitting the oside pier and been doing alright . 
  as you said most people are out of sight by 10pm but i 've managed to find a few people each night i 've gone so far . 
  thanks again for the info , i 'll look into those other places !, 
  from big bad china no less . 
  perfect . 
  damn this just makes me miss halo-bungie . 
  :( i feel like with destiny they are n't even trying with the videos they make ; very little to no behind the scenes looks ever . 
  [ non mobile article ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/joint_light_tactical_vehicle ), 
  i was there too !, 
  are you in the video ? 
  definitely a relevant username, 
  i noticed this as well ; it will be interesting to see whether or not it 's some kind of permanent retooling . 
  story time ? 
  but still against federal law . 
  her shoes are pink though . 
  sorry that happened to you , and just so you know it 's * fiancee . 
  and at least 65 other people . 
  there goes 20 minutes ; interesting . 
  i guess i just do n't see how black and pink `` match '' ; must be a guy thing or i 'm fashionably blind . 
  ** fiance ** implies a male . 
  ** fiancee ** implies a female . 
  the ^ more ^ ^ you ^ ^ ^ know !, 
  actually peacocks are one of a few prime examples of `` evolutionary hindrance '' . 
  it 's where a certain trait has been selected for ( usually sexually ) which actually hinders the animal 's ability to perform other tasks necessary for survival such as hunting/eating . 
  [ here is another famous example you may have seen/heard of before . 
  ] ( http://scienceblogs.com/tetrapodzoology/wp-content/blogs.dir/471/files/2012/04/i-d544bc4fe9379b586394104cbb8d5113-gothemburg-babirusa-skull-oblique-mar-2010.jpg ) what you are seeing there is the cause of death for the animal ; slow and painful . 
  but just like the peacocks , these subspecies of boars have evolved by the females preferring the males with the biggest horns . 
  in the case of the peacock , maintaining such a large and elaborate display requires a tremendous amount of energy that could be better used for other functions such as , say , running from predators . 
  not to mention the display hinders maneuverability and also makes it impossible to hide from animals which would attack it . 
  thank you , i 'll be here all night !,

  never thought i 'd see a crossover comment for my 2 favorite shows . 
  for the sake of the free internet i really wish people would stop advocating for ad blockers . 
  i mean the dude has sunk at least $ 10k so far into this ad campaign ; so yeah i 'd guess it 's working . 
  you watched it all ? 
  could i get a tldr ? 
  ` if ( tedx = = ted ), 
  return false ; `, 
  ` else, 
  return true ; `, 
  because it is essentially stealing from the content creators whose work you are viewing . 
  over the past couple years it has begun to have an impact on sites that offer free online content who have begun searching for other ways to monetize ( such as natural advertising , ad reads , sponsorships , etc. ), 
  and may in the future cause any online content to be put behind a paywall . 
  these are instructions for a soup . . 
   new netherlands, 
  that 's us !, 
  sheesh , that thing was a disaster . 
   i wonder why i 've been unsuccessfully trying to quit for the last year . 
  as someone who quit after being a pack-a-day for a few years ; do n't put the responsibility of you smoking on someone/something else , it will only make it harder for you to recognize that you can in fact quit whenever you want .

  from elsewhere in the thread : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sexual_selection_in_human_evolution, 
  [ strangely relevant after 10 years . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/t4hlmqxacl0?t=5m4s ) ( start at 5 minutes ), 
  ah yes , quite . 
  i 've always had low blood pressure ; is it worth me trying to raise it or should i just be happy where i 'm at ? 
  like evolution and gravity . 
  i was n't arguing anything . 
  this is just like the kids who think they 're cool for saying jesus never existed when really they come off as total idiots who know nothing of the topic . 
  i would just hang up the phone . . 
  [ hooray this video is relevant again 6 months later !,

  my buddy and i have been waiting for double team forever so we played a bit of that last night . 
  think we 're only at like 9 or 10 so far but i imagine we 'll hit 20 within a couple more days . 
  what 's this from ? 
   if you have a kinect . 
  which was sold with every console . 
   on pc it 's one . 
  which one is that ? 
  yeah but only fairly recently did that start , i think it 's fair to say the lion 's share of xbox owners have a kinect . 
  whether or not it is kinnected is another issue . 
  ( i could n't resist ), 
  now what, 
  now what, 
  now what, 
  thanks !, 
  guys . 
  you 're forgetting that the most important thing we 're put on this planet to do is sex . 
  everything we do comes out of millions of years of our ancestors becomes smarter , more efficient fuckers . 
  now you may say , `` what about maslow 's hierarchy of needs ? 
  i thought first comes breathing , then eating , and sex falls somewhere down in the self actualization phase . '',
