  pretty sure it 's regional . 
  the correct usage is $ x.xx , but other currencies like yen go after the amount afaik .

  i was sick and out of work for a while so i practiced it until i could get all 196 . 
  pretty much my most useless ` skill ' except when people wonna play trivial pursuit or something . 
  such a good fucking episode in a great show . 
  wow that ray guy does n't mix well with the others at all .

  america is a big place , sidewalks look different across the country . 
   and `` n '' brings up r/nsfw _ gif, 
  what , how is that possible ? 
  awesome , thanks !, 
  so it totally makes sense to you that typing n would auto complete to www.reddit.com/r/nsfw ? 
  / r/shittypersonalfinance, 
  * was * a thing , with a specific lottery . 
  dude 's got bank to run that ad so many times . 
  he staked the raise . 
  why would anyone take this deal ? 
  you just like to see someone suffer ? 
   also , how is he going to get dial up nowadays ? 
  my grandma could hook him up . 
  what game is it ? 
  and is that actual dialogue ? 
  hey could you explain something to me ? 
  sometimes i write questions to myself about things that do n't make sense in the universe and keep them stored in my phone , and you seem like the * perfect * person to ask about this one . 
  alright so let me know if i 'm making some elementary mistake here , but follow my logic :, 
  - any number that ends in 6 , when multiplied by 6 , will produce a result that ends in 6 . 
  ( e.g. 
  - any number that ends in 5 , when multiplied by 5 , will produce a result that ends in 5 . 
  ( e.g. 
  - this occurrence is ** only true for the numbers 5 and 6 ** . 
  ( e.g. 
  - why is this the case ? 
  what unique property ties 5 and 6 together ? 
  after pondering it sometimes when falling asleep or in the shower , i feel i 've simplified it down to the fact that 5 and 6 are the only numbers that when squared end in their own digit ; but i guess that answer does n't fully satisfy me especially in the context of `` beauty forming naturally in math '' . 
  i mean i can understand if it was * just * 5 that this was true for , as it 's the mid point of our base 10 system , but for the life of me i do n't understand why 6 would share any kind of unique property with 5 . 
  yes i understand that this post probably makes me look like an absolute weirdo but idgaf , it 's not even the weirdest or most benign observation i have written in my phone . 
  ** edit : ** i 'm loving the replies this is getting , thanks for the number talk everyone !, 
  he was looking at the screen i 'm pretty sure . 
  thanks !, 
  holy shit this is something i 'd totally write in my phone had i found it myself , how does anyone ever notice something like this ? 
  i feel like you would n't need to put a tracker on someone arrested for loitering . 
  you mean there 's more than one ? 
  daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaamn, 
  i 'd be thrilled for either one of them or both to become moderators , i have n't been contacted by anyone offering to help moderate but perhaps i 'll shoot them a message ; did n't know their reddit names thanks !, 
  i think in most cases the stuff that gets dropped or forgotten are rules like , `` you ca n't give away your money to help the world '' and the stuff that gets remembered and passed down are things like , `` do unto others are you 'd like done unto you . '', 
  so in that context i think it 's fine . 
  a lot of parents just use religion as a teaching tool to help children understand right/wrong and to inspire them to be a good person . 
  i 'm not saying a large amount of people do n't use it negatively , but i believe a lot of religious folks are ` doing it right ' as it were . 
  * reasons . 
  seems like you 'll need to back your own claim up . 
  please , tell me more about this lethal dosage of lsd seeing as there has only ever been one death * suspected * of being caused by lsd when an individual injected ~ 15,000 times the average dose intravenously . 
  i 'm inclined to believe you , i2tall4abike . 
  my condolences . 
  damn dude i can barely walk in a straight line, 
  the chinese seem very enamored by the idea of order and rigidity ; i wonder if it 's due to their large population .

  cold, 
  second one for sure looks the best ; that 's a lot better than i could do . 
  i was more referring to the fact that he called him a ` guy ' instead of a kid , maybe it 's just a regional thing but it seemed odd to me . 
  `` are you street like will smith ? '',

  asking for a friend . . 
  interesting . 
  so what happens when i kill someone ? 
  do i just get xp , or do i get all their loot/ship ? 
  do they lose anything/everything ? 
  and if i get a bounty on me , what exactly does that mean , is it a 100 % death sentence ? 
  thanks for the help , looks like a cool game !, 
   the duration of bounty was 50 days , 12 hours , 00 minutes, 
  is that real world time ? 
  like i could n't go back to that system for 2 months !, 
  i do n't want to seem insensitive , but i honestly ca n't imagine someone having this fear . 
  i mean the entire earth is pretty huge , are people afraid of that ?
