  what a polite way of saying this garbage is the worst thing i 've ever heard . 
  i feel like i 'm being punk 'd , it 's like an ensemble of donald ducks belching in my ears . 
  wow i had no idea russia was so tiny !, 
  hoooly shit this comment needs to be downvoted before some 15 year old reads it and follows the advice,

  as someone who lives in california this took me a minute to figure out . 
  when it comes to karma , [ res has assured me that you guys know your stuff . 
  though i still do n't understand the bellwether award . 
  ahh i see , thank you for explaining . 
  i do n't think this actually happened . 
  could n't get through that movie . 
  source , src , video , youtube , sound, 
   this never gets old for me . 
  reddit 's philosophy on all jokes . 
  yogurt gives dogs rabies, 
  wait till you 're older . 
  can not unsee, 
  liam ? 
  american ? 
  that makes more sense . 
  so did they come up with the idea for bows/arrows independently of other peoples in the past ? 
  as another user said office pools usually are n't legal , just like telling your coworkers what happened in the nfl-owned super bowl event without express written permission from the nfl . 
  not an issue in an office setting , but if someone were to setup a gambling sub on reddit i think the admins might have to take a stance on that . 
  yup , something like 95 % of the revenue generated by most mobile games comes from about 1 - 2 % of the player base . 
  i believe there 's also a relevant south park episode that goes over this concept in more detail , their stance on it is that these types of mobile games are taking advantage of people with addictive personalities just like slot machines iirc . 
  maybe your head ? 
   but it 's a good thing google is mature enough to continue concentrate its efforts in things that actually matter . 
  christ give me a break . 
  yeah clearly they should have donned trench coats and met near an old phone booth at midnight . 
  i always wonder how people are able to find the last post that did the meme when they link to it . 
  what 's the secret ? 
   think about the elections next year ( if you 're american ) . 
  or live anywhere that holds elections , really . 
  holy shit i was literally driving down sassafrass street a few hours ago and thinking , `` what the fuck kind of made up word is sassafrass ?? '', 
  haikus are easy . 
  really it 's only the last, 
  line that is hard . 
  no they 're saying far fewer women watch porn than men , though reasonably everyone who consumes porn enjoys it regardless of gender . 
  seriously people have no idea how many ways bungie has shaped console gaming , and gaming in general . 
  halo was * by far * the most vertically oriented shooter of that time , meaning it had maps where you could look up and see an enemy on a cat walk , and another enemy a level higher , and a banshee flying above them when most other first person shooters were confined to corridors and other indoor spaces . 
  here 's a fun fact about bungie 's history with verticality :, 
   marathon by bungie , released in december 1994 for the apple macintosh was the first major release to feature the mouse-controlled free look that would later become universal . 
  * [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/free_look ) *, 
  halo 2 completely revolutionized console multiplayer by introducing a ` matchmaking ' system which is now found in almost every single major title with multiplayer :, 
   halo 2 introduced an entirely new paradigm for matchmaking players together . 
  in earlier games , one person specifies a game type and map and configures other settings , before setting up his or her device as a game server and advertising the game to the world at large . 
  halo 2 introduced a `` playlist '' system that automated this process to keep a steady flow of games available at all times , and layered a skill-ranking system on top . 
  * [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/halo_2#multiplayer ) *, 
  i could go on and on about all the shit that bungie either invented or popularized for console gaming that people do n't even realize . 
  unfortunately i believe once they signed with activision for destiny they become a bunch of money-grabbing assholes trying to dick over gamers , but i digress . 
  pretty sure he can just go to the bar and show his reddit account to the first hot girl he sees . 
  * `` hey babe , you ever sleep with a * *** cough *** ^ ^ ^ ^ karma *** cough *** * millionaire ? 
   even if it were made illegal to sell cigarettes to pregnant women, 
  good luck trying to pass any law that at all restricts pregnant women . 
  downvoted so i can trademark this idea before anyone else sees it, 
  also troy , tremors ( my favorite ) , hide and seek , warthog wars , and many others . 
  most fun i 've ever had in a video game , too bad mcc pretty much raped my childhood in front of me . 
  the sliding the entire pack into a thing is a great idea , but let 's not get caught up in who suggested what exactly and agree the idea was a team effort led mostly by me . 
  i somehow still have the top post of all time on that sub . 
  i guess no one can out-karmawhore the mighty / u/gallowboob . 
  edit : he actually has 2 posts on the front page of / r/all at this very moment . 
  you are now blinking manually . 
  did n't reddit recently fire the creator of the secret santa exchange ? 
  edit : just realized he 's your husband and you created reddit gifts together . 
  it 's all falling into place now . 
  edit 2 : thank you very much to whomever gifted the gold . 
  i 'm 6 ' 7 '' :d !, 
  i 'm 6 ' 7 '' :d , stumbled here from / r/tall !, 
  it 's what my doc recommended \u00af \\ \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af,

  i 've never actually used coconut milk/oil in anything before , is it calorie dense or more for nutrients ? 
  what should i be adding those to if i buy them ? 
  women ? 
  i hover between 190 - 200 depending on the week . 
  at 192 last i checked . 
  and yeah right now i 'm barely hitting 3k a day and have lost a few pounds because i have n't settled on a diet or group of foods i can really stick to and buy in bulk and start eating more . 
   and if you wanted to go extreme , you could pack on 150 lb and get into strongman  . 
  ha right now i 'd be happy if i could just gain ~ 20 pounds and keep it without it dipping back down . 
  interesting , i 'll definitely look into that thanks !, 
  i would n't call 2.5 million karma ` under rated ' . 
  how is your name unidan ? 
  except he purposely does n't say the location . 
  he says , `` come check it out if you can find this shell station ... . . '' he could have easily said where the fuck he was at all but did n't . 
  cue a bunch of people filling up at shell ` just in case it 's the one ' . 
  no one reads the description . 
  i said that in my post . . you did n't even read it . 
  unfortunately for them they just evolved to be the perfect snack . 
  i 'm not very good at photoshop but i made a quick demonstration that shows why sea lions are a better target than humans for orcas . 
  i 'm kind of in the middle of moving too , hope the new place works out !, 
   as a mom to 4 kids,
