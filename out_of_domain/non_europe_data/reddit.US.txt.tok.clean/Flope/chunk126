  i do , and you 're right . 
   make sure you wipe down the machines after getting them all sweaty when you look like a new person to the gym .

  never been to the gym .

   i have never been anywhere even remotely close to this drunk because i would get sick 19 drinks before i could reach this level of drunk . 
  no you 're not . 
  think about the average redditor , it 's not really a ` niche ' . 
   was n't working past 10 on a school night ... 
  never heard of this , where do you live ? 
  or am i being who ^ o ^ ^ o ^ ^ ^ o ^ ^ ^ shed ?

   sauce, 
   source, 
  i appreciated this . 
  well everyone does , so you 're not * really * mistaken . 
  i did just say that . 
  i got every one wrong !, 
  thank you robot , now leave us please . 
  you 're a legit stalker, 
  take out that ac-130 with your tactical knife !, 
  they probably just eat it wherever it falls and then walk back and say , `` yeah sorry it got away \u00af \\ \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af '',

  i wonder if this is taught at all in european schools or if it was such a non-event in their country 's history that it gets brushed over . 
  i know in the us at my school we only spent like half of a class period going over the marshall plan , even though it was such an important action to take after the war . 
  the `` it pays to speak english '' chart . 
  meet me out back with $ 50 . 
  so there are `` black hat '' hackers who are paid by companies to test for vulnerabilities ? 
  that sounds pretty white hat , i thought black hat generally inferred illegal activity . 
  that does n't even make any sense , a comment would n't appear in the ` top past month ' of a subreddit . 
  that 's not true . 
  you 're off the hook this time , now go coach a little league game . 
  that is absolutely preposterous , but i stand corrected . 
  thank you for the source , even if the direct link is a stackexchange explanation . 
  everyone at my college says ` the bart ' . 
  according to this thread , your mileage may vary . 
  i 've been a pizza delivery driver too , where tipping makes absolutely no fucking sense . 
  what is ` exceptional ' delivery service ? 
  like , `` uh thanks for not eating the food on your way over here . '', 
  yeah the tips were nice , ~ $ 5 - $ 10 per delivery in my area . 
  troll account move on, 
  it 's nice in theory but at most restaurants in my experience you 'll be fired if your tips do n't make at least minimum wage . 
  the restaurant does n't want to eat that cost to help you get there , so all it takes is an unlucky string of fuckwads who think they 're changing the world by refusing to tip and you could be under for that week and in deep shit . 
  i think he 's saying the fact that it * used to be * lower means it makes sense for older folks who grew up tipping less to not suddenly change their habits 60 + years into their life . 
  cost of living got higher faster than the avg price of a meal ? 
  as someone who has worked in the service industry and has many friends who do as well , it 's no secret that you make more by providing better service to your customers * usually * . 
  so this idea that tipping has no effect on quality of service is nonsense unless the person working is literally not motivated by money in any way . 
  you worded it a bit strongly but your underlying point does have merit . 
  i wish travelers from abroad understood that not leaving a tip out of `` principle '' is in essence stealing part of your meal . 
  you are n't changing the service industry that way , you 're just a thief . 
  you 're too cheap to pay the expected cost of your meal and expecting someone else to carry the tab , whether it be the restaurant or otherwise . 
  not to mention the fact that american portion sizes per $ are ridiculously larger than overseas , so people should really have no problem paying what in their mind is `` extra '' . 
  of course if you legitimately did n't know about tipping before coming to the us that 's understandable and you should n't feel horrible about it . 
  sounds like you should get better friends/colleagues or grow a pair . 
  i have no qualms leaving a shitty tip for shitty service , regardless of who i 'm with . 
  sfsu, 
  sf state , not many spoiled kids here i 'd guess haha, 
  depends on your definition of ` fair ' and it 's no surprise that minimum wage , and by extension tipping , is a strongly contested topic among party lines in the us . 
  do you believe everyone should be treated equally and be paid the same , or do you believe those who go above and beyond should be rewarded and those who dgaf should make less ? 
  there 's no right answer , but there are tens of millions of people on both sides . 
  we do kind of do that where i 'm at . 
  i mean we ca n't shift the priority of orders , but if we know that a house usually tips well we 'll drive faster or throw in some extra parm/pepper packets and help them get the best coupon for their order . 
  yeah again do n't feel bad about being new to the system , i was more talking about people who fully understand how tipping works but will leave a 0 % tip out of principle . 
  and yeah just leave the cash on the table in 99 % of cases . 
  because tipping is the norm people are n't too worried about people stealing the money if that 's what you mean . 
  i imagine it might be different in another country where tipping is rare and some passerby sees like $ 10 lying on a table and thinks someone lost it . 
  i deliver in a very affluent area , but in my experience the people with the lower-end or rundown houses tipped better than the new mansion estates . 
  i think it 's because they could identify with a blue collar worker more . 
  i 'm sure its different when the entire area is near poverty level though . 
  a $ 5 delivery fee is ridiculous . 
  at my place it 's $ 1.75 which goes directly to the driver for gas , and then you can tip on top of that . 
  i just deliver for a high-end pizzeria , not a chain . 
  a medium specialty pizza will probably come to like $ 16 after tax , but most people order at least a couple mediums so my average ticket is $ 35 or so . 
  i 'd think most non-community colleges are, 
  i like how you had this saved ready to pull out , knowing this broad 's deafening shrieks would become relevant . 
  illegal in certain states including california , where boeing is based . 
  tomato potato . 
  but really i guess it 's tough to definitively say where they are based but they were founded in washington , are headquartered in chicago and do most of their r&d / manufacturing in southern california . 
  the perks of living in the same country as blizzard hq . 
  but how will blizzard know there 's an issue without 40 threads ? 
  is this card worth crafting ? 
  i 'm down too !, 
  dude would n't it be funny if we stepped on the chicken 's heads to kill them though ? 
  like just for goofs ? 
  damn only 2 posts and we 're into crazytown . 
  it 's fine i eat enough meat for the 2 of us . 
  that a growing percentage of consumers would like the animals to be treated relatively humanely prior to death . 
  if say 90 % of americans in a few years are buying the ` free range happy chicken ' branded eggs , companies like mcdicks would presumably infer that any fuck up such as the one in this thread will have larger backlash and possible consequences due to public outcry , and will try to ensure that does n't happen . 
  k brb dying,
