  hooray !, 
  i 've never had a donation in my name before . 
  proof requested !, 
  but think of the * fun * . 
  i swear the invention of the ' / s ' tag has obliterated people 's ability to detect sarcasm . 
  would n't a hiring manager who receives 3 identical resumes with different names be a little suspicious ? 
  where is it ? 
  it must be so subtle i ca n't see it !, 
  there 's no way you live in the us right ? 
  ca n't imagine not getting that checked out by like the 3rd picture . 
  thanks but i 'd rather die than be in complete darkness underwater with a great white shark . 
   sadly it seems the only joy he had in life was masturbating which he reportedly did incessantly . 
  damn this story has horribly depressed me . 
  do you have any uplifting anecdotes , doc ? 
  pretty sure he means ` once you are at an age where you are planning on getting pregnant in the next couple years ' . 
  wow suddenly i feel a lot better about not being able to afford medical insurance . 
  if i get horribly sick i 'll just go to church !, 
  here 's the thing . . 
  i run him in dragon priest and he seems to do well . 
  i mean i 'm playing ramp druid right now , basically the same thing plus some mana burst cards / legendaries . 
  ah , back when i was good at the game . . 
  mvp . 
  since the post is 4 months old , have you made any updates / do you still run the deck ? 
  what 's it 's current win rate like ? 
  you 're forgetting that the most important thing we 're put on this planet to do is sex . 
  everything we do comes out of millions of years of our ancestors becomes smarter , more efficient fuckers . 
  now you may say , `` what about maslow 's hierarchy of needs ? 
  i thought first comes breathing , then eating , and sex falls somewhere down in the self actualization phase . '', 
  well sorry maslow , but the one cave man who focused all of his energy on breathing and eating , and never fucked anything , fell off the gene pool with no affect on modern man . 
  i do n't care if you 're starving to death with your head caught in a dryer bag , if you can fuck , you should do it . 
  now , you may be thinking , `` forget millions of years of evolution , i am sentient !, 
  i have been given a brain with which i can find deeper meaning and serve a greater purpose , something even better than sex ! '', 
  to that i say fine , you want to take a stance that is that self important to you species and yourself ? 
  then lets do just that . 
  we 're gon na need a yard stick though . 
  because human endeavor is based on many factors such as glory , honor , bravery , and altruism . 
  i think our yard stick should simply be the number of other human lives you touch . 
  well even the greatest celebrity , poet , inventor , or politician has an influence that is limited to the collective human memory . 
  but , if you fuck just a handful of time in your life , you have the potential to not just affect , but literally create 268,435,456 over the next 800 years ( assuming an average of 2 children per person with an average childbearing age of 30 , which i think is generous ) . 
  so , the next time you think you 're better than sex , think again . 
  we 're all just here to fuck . 
  i think you may be overcooking your toast . 
  amazing . 
   walmart just had to spend like 2 million lol, 
  i 'm afraid this could be the nail in the coffin for little walmart . 
  watching the gif after reading this was enjoyable . 
  that . . is kevin spacey . 
  stop posting this . 
  it just confused me reading it twice with like 30 other comments in between , i thought i was having a stroke . 
  i would 've never read it if it were n't for your comment ; thank you . 
  his inflection when telling morty he was * toootally * the same . 
  wait people stream rick and morty ? 
  where ? 
   the writing behind them in that scene is the same writing on the building in the town . 
  i 'm sorry could you explain what you mean here ? 
  you were right of course that they did show the scene , but i 'm not sure i understand how you predicted it . 
  i 've seen both those shows but ca n't recall when the word was used . . care to refresh my memory ? 
  ah yes , the art of medicine . 
   helps to cut down on doctor shopping, 
  how ? 
  and why would it even be an issue in the first place ? 
  i mean you should obviously tell the kid what you did so he does n't think the deer just ran away or died . 
   by being able to track how many controlled substances the patient has been prescribed , which doctors are prescribing them , how often , etc. . . we are able to prevent drug abuse by just applying a little common sense . 
  do you mean to say that a pharmacy has the power to refuse to fill a script even if a doctor ordered it ? 
  i did n't know that . 
  i thought , pending payment issues / being out of stock , a pharmacy had to fill all legitimate scripts . 
  not sure if insinuating a sex toy , or homosexuality . . 
  yes . 
  as a straight guy , that 's pretty disgusting . 
  i mean who really cares though ? 
  if a girl says to me , `` wow i love how the head of your dick looks . . '' i 'm not going to interrupt her and say , `` umm excuse me i think you mean the *** glans *** of my *** penis *** ?!, 
  christ we 're done here , do n't call me until you can accurately name all the parts of my genitalia . '', 
  like is it a big deal if people refer to the whole of female genitals as a vagina , even if it 's technically incorrect ? 
  you want me to rewatch an entire season of breaking bad to hear a character say ` fuck ' one time ? 
  surely someone could at least narrow down which episode number it was . . 
  hm someone 's downvoting my posts for some reason . 
  anyways til , thanks for taking the time to explain that . 
  i guess people just feel differently about it , and i 'm not trying to be disrespectful towards women 's bodies or whatever , but it just registers as such a non-issue to me that it 's weird to see so many people get fired up about it ( not you necessarily but others in this thread and elsewhere ) . 
  i 'd put it right alongside people who say , `` you know technically the triceratops was n't a dinosaur due to the era it lived in '' and `` a ` theory ' is n't just an idea it 's something that has been tested and never proven false '' . 
  i agree that it 's an important distinction within their respective fields , like i 'd be concerned if my gynecologist referred to my vulva as a vagina , but outside of that it seems like as long as people know what you * mean * it does n't really matter . 
  i ca n't believe i just typed all that out . 
  i should probably go outside for a bit . 
  the testicle : penis scenario made me lol though , i 'm not sure how i 'd react if a girl said that while we were getting intimate haha . 
   okay i 'm going to try the 7 completely different suggestions listed in this thread to see what works, 
   it worked thx, 
  * last updated 6 years ago . 
  ah , i spent the last two weeks studying the intro and it appears you are correct . 
  thanks !, 
  roadrunner and coyote ? 
  if you truly believe that is the worst outcome i 'm not surprised you get into a lot of arguments . 
  edit : relevant username i suppose . 
   it would be akin to believing that all republicans are bible thumping tea partiers . 
  welcome to reddit !, 
  where religious = republican = bad !, 
  just send me all of your ideas and i 'll make sure he sees them . 
  am i the only one here who thought this was for the passengers to press , not the driver ? 
   i know i 'm a wee bit sexist for saying this . . a middle aged white bitch on her phone talking to her girlfriend about wine tastings and shoes or some shit . 
  that escalated quickly . 
  this one made me lol, 
   christopher lee was saruman in lord of the rings and count dooku in the star wars prequels,
