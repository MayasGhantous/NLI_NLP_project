  also paging / u/tofurocks in case he knows, 
  i do n't get it, 
  oh so it actually is a simpsons joke , i 've never seen the show . 
  thanks !, 
  got it , thank you !, 
  got it , thank you !, 
  at first i figured homer simpson but after reading a couple comments yes i did actually think homer the old author haha . 
  i 'm not sure what you 're saying , but i 've actually never watched the simpsons . 
  i do n't have a tv sub unfortunately , i 'm sure if i did i may have caught an episode or two by now haha, 
  how fucking nervous must that translator feel . 
  one wrong vowel and you might accidentally say `` order the nukes '' instead of `` order the coffee '' . 
  8th grade, 
   for the rest of my entire life , i will never forget this image . 
  it feels strong now but you probably wo n't remember any of this in just a few months or so . 
  tragedies are constantly coming and going . 
   my dad subbed in for her one day when she could n't make it . 
  it was the only game we won the entire season . 
  i bet dad never let her live that down . 
  if you actually read it that way there might be something wrong with you, 
  wow that 's super impressive . 
  [ here you go ] ( http://www.gifbeam.com/uploads/5/0/4/6/50461919/6890242_orig.gif ) , that 'll be $ 3 please, 
  so what was the point in correcting the day then ? 
  [ that 's one of my highest upvoted comments !, 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/iama/comments/1c8w4u/iama_18_year_old_male_who_lost_his_penis_to/c9e8i66?context=3 ) not sure what it 's from though . 
  actually the typical amount is $ 1 / 1000 nowadays depending on how many of your viewers are using adblock . 
  considering a large amount of these views may have come from reddit , they could be missing a huge chunk of revenue . 
  source : youtube for a living, 
  yes , typically around 35 % depending on the terms you 've agreed to when activating monetization for your account . 
  if you 're signed with an mcn ( multi channel network ) , which more and more people are these days , they will also take a cut of your remaining profits , sometimes as high as 50 % . 
   the baby boner thing is a little odd though . 
  i could have gone through life without the knowledge that my parents needed to deal with baby boners when raising me . 
  what 's the channel ? 
  i think you replied to the wrong person , between all my channels i 'm making enough for rent + food though i still have a part time gig for other expenses . 
  i 'd definitely not recommend quitting your day job if you 're only bringing in 2 bucks a month though haha , 
  [ fancy this ] ( http://raidleader.tv/partner.html ), 
  it 's not , and it 's getting lower with more and more people blocking ads . 
  if you can , send me a contact request on skype so we can chat there , it 's faster than messaging via reddit . 
  thanks !, 
  i 'm not even going to click that article because the laws in the us are so unbelievably strict , but that 's good for germany . 
  i really believe this sort of thing should be treated less criminally as long as they had no part in actually producing the content . 
  i think those that produce that type of content should get incredibly long sentences to deter others from doing it , but i ca n't help but feel bad for people who are into it and have to worry about ending up in prison for decades just because of their sexual orientation , it 's not like they chose to like it any more than someone who is gay chose to like the same gender . 
   no one should have to serve any time for growing a plant . 
  what about opium or plants that are used to make cocaine/mushrooms/other drugs ? 
  i 'm not sure why someone downvoted you but this is pretty much my core belief as well , and i think the science would back this up . 
   sadly it 's probably not going to happen any time soon . 
  there 's too much of a stigma, 
  see : every top level comment in this thread, 
  i also thought / u/slim _ calhoun smoked a j there in 2010 . 
  did n't he just get promoted to the head of animation or something similar ? 
  i originally read it as ` my little poon ' . 
  weird that someone else pointed out those letters too . 
   not sure why anyone would be surprised about hitler sending his condolences . 
  you know why , stop acting like an idiot . 
  this is pretty funny, 
  the circlejerk is growing strong in this thread . 
  you both sound ridiculous . 
  i was also a `` self-imposed vegetarian '' for a few years of early childhood . 
  not sure if i was as young as 2 but i may have been . 
  my mother could not get me to try a hamburger for the life of her , so one day while giving my friend and i a ride to the house she surreptitiously pulled us into a drive through for 5 guys knowing my friend would of course be excited about getting a burger . 
  so , wanting to fit in i got one too . 
  i still did n't admit they were good , but 2 decades later and i 'm a huge carnivore . 
  other things my mom made me try against my wishes : ice cream , xbox . 
  i like the girl who said monsters , that 's a unique answer i wonder what she meant . 
  shhhhh ^ you 're ^ embarrassing ^ us, 
   if you do n't want it to be a `` circlejerk '' ( it 's not ) , then here 's your chance to break it with your awesome , intelligent comment factually demonstrating how we 're all wrong . 
  i 'll take my downvotes , the lack of self awareness on reddit is actually really funny . 
  have you ever told someone to `` suck a dick '' ? 
  yes ? 
  okay , have you ever told someone to `` lick a pussy '' ? 
  well there ya go . 
  where are you from ? 
  it 's very common in the us , not sure about abroad . 
   reddit does n't know that though . 
  reddit is 20 and grew up in a suburb . 
  both reddit 's parents worked in insurance . 
  not all of us have it as good as you do . 
  california here as well . 
  weird . 
  oh you 're from the bay area , that may be it . 
  i 'm in socal , though i 've moved all up and down the east coast and it 's common there as well . 
  nice save by jeremy at 18:21, 
  um , pretty sure they 're imagining it 's someone else 's mom , not their own . 
  but what do i know . 
  what about the dog ? 
  it 's how the brits speak . 
  is the phone any good ? 
  i 'm using an iphone 4 right now, 
  are you familiar with the nexus 6 ? 
  considering buying the 32gb version , upgrading from my iphone 4 . 
  do you think 199.99 is a decent price ? 
  from what i can see it 's only 1/4 the storage though , what makes the 5x better than the 6 ? 
  is it newer ? 
  sounds more like a documentary, 
  reddit hugged the link, 
  you set it up with ice . 
  you bring a cooler with icecubes and just throw a couple in each cup , the ice melts overnight and voila you 've created more work than what was required to set it up . 
  i would pick up water cups for $ 15/hour . 
  people are acting like this prank is vicious on the poor janitor , i 'd much rather spend my day cleaning up a prank than scrubbing middle schooler piss off the urinals . 
  internet, 
   pretty bullshit that condoms larger than 59mm are banned in the us ...
