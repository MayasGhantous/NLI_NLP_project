  there 's online retailers , check out theyfit , you send in your exact measurements . 
  sorry you 're being downvoted , you 're right though it is annoying . 
  though i already had a possible latex allergy so that limits the ` fun ' condoms in it 's own ways . 
  weird that you were downvoted , but yes it is saul 's henchman . 
  he 's a very funny comedian as well and produces his own podcast . 
  wish i saw this comment before googling it, 
  still too complicated . 
  which would be why they do n't recognize it as a genocide . 
  it worked perfectly thank you !, 
  kenm is kind of similar to anonymous in that anyone can post a funny comment online under the pseudonym kenm , it 's not necessarily just one guy , there would be no way to police that . 
  is n't barbara 's husband the guy from that short as well ? 
  think about how absolutely retarded everyone in that town is , and imagine having to be in charge of all of those idiots since the outbreak . 
  she is a terrible mother . 
  a terrible , pretty hot mom . 
  i actually think it makes interactions within the group a lot more interesting when he 's there , because he 's the only one who offers an actual dividing opinion on things . 
  it 's a breathe of fresh air . 
  though i must admit carol might soon fill that niche by going much , much too far in the other direction as a murderous psychopath . 
  thanks , we 're both in open play but now that we 're at the same station we ca n't physically see each other . 
  are we instanced ? 
  we 're literally right on top of each other supposedly but ca n't see one another :(,

  thanks !, 
  gosh that would ruin my whole weekend . 
  it 's ridiculous and it 's ruining breakfast for me . 
  til stitches, 
  brb becoming vet, 
   just wait until the rich and privileged can design super intelligent/beautiful offspring . 
  implying that 's not what already happens . 
  rich and priveleged people tend to have more objectively attractive spouses . 
  children born to rich families can afford better healthcare ( including skincare for acne , braces for teeth , eye surgery for glasses , etc. ), 
  to make them more attractive than children born in poor families , and can also afford the luxury of going to good schools to make them more ` intelligent ' . 
  the first picture looked pretty awesome , but the second one made me dislike it . 
  it would be awesome if this neighborhood was etched into the side of a mountain , not a manmade hill in a little rounded rectangle . 
  also has one of the most dope starting locations for a civ on planet earth . 
  water on two sides with access to the ocean , a large landmass , and great natural resources . 
  . . you really think they 'll throw you in prison for years for being an american ? 
  but the filter is how i know it 's war stuff !, 
  it was brutal , i 'd kill myself after a performance that bad too . 
  it 's not meant to add something extra , it 's meant to get non-podcast watchers to watch the podcast . 
  solid snag on that reddit username, 
  i mean given the context of west vs east media , pretty similar . 
  you 're conflating talent with skill . 
   it would , i think , be first time in history that someone would do a pun in polish , because we have so few homophones that we barely have the concept of pun . 
  and they wasted it . 
  i would be pretty upset too . 
  this is pretty much the depth of my spanish as well . 
  math is cool . 
  if we 're using ` the most extreme ' as our metric i 'm pretty sure the waterbear wins every category . 
  woah i have n't seen you in 9 months !, 
  i know that because the last time i saw you i tagged you as `` delusional '' , [ right here .

   `` if they can just reverse our vote , what 's the point ? '', 
  i kind of feel the same way honestly . 
  i voted for marriage equality , but when the majority of californians did n't and then the court just overturned it i thought that was kind of horseshit . 
  why even put it on the ballot in the first place then ? 
   i do n't even know what you are objecting to . 
  probably something that would make you sound insane though . 
  fair . 
  so there 's no point . 
  most redditors are american as well . 
   i 've never met or seen a non white trump supporter . 
  trump is the leading candidate for 1 of our 2 political parties . 
  the fact that you have n't met a supporter of his who is non-white does n't mean they do n't exist , it means you do n't get out much . 
  do you know / u/12 _ inch_richard 's girlfriend ? 
   it makes perfect sense regardless of how it 's worded . 
  this doesnt make sense, 
  im tired downvote me, 
  reddit is a fickle beast \u00af \\ \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af, 
  that always happens to me . 
  `` hey the rt podcast will be live in an hour , i 'm gon na make some food and watch it ! '',

  bro i do n't know it 's been 2 weeks what the hay, 
  hey you could have gotten pregnant and had a child [ since the last time i saw you .

  how 's it hanging ? 
   when all else fails use your mouth . 
  this is usually just plan a for me . 
  i wish . 
  i would quit my job and drop out of school . 
  in reality sub count has nothing to do with income , only views matter . 
  views are what matters . 
  it 's technically possible for a channel with 2.5 m subscribers to make $ 0/month . 
  what about eminem 's spanish account ? 
  make sure to get your consent forms signed, 
  i think this must be it . 
  having family ties high up in the nippon building would pretty much guarantee the resistance would cut contact with jules . 
  how do you effectively moderate 25 subs at a time ? 
   it would be getting to play with a 28 card deck most games . 
  not quite . 
  burnie always seemed really down to earth to me until his recent black friday rant , where he went on about how `` some people value their time so little , like they wait in line for a few hours to save $ 100 . . they basically are saying their time has 0 value . '', 
  that was a fucked up way of teaching me to write my name on my papers , mrs. rennick . 
  what part of reddit should i avoid ? 
  thanks anon . 
  also umbrellas . 
  that 's what we 're gon na do ?
