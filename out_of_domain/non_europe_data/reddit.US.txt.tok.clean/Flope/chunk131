  are you happy though ? 
  women . 
  i , like many others , purchased infinifactory during the recent steam sale and immediately fell in love with the game . 
  typically the first place i look for some community and likeminded players of any game is on reddit , so i was kind of bummed to see how inactive the subreddit was relative to the game 's popularity . 
  it 's still using a default skin , no css changes and one moderator who has n't posted anywhere on reddit in almost half a year . 
  i 'm looking forward to sprucing the place up and hopefully making it a more attractive destination for infinifactory fans . 
  locking this thread so that we can keep all comments constructive , [ see the new stickied thread here for more information and to ama if you 'd like !,

   you can understand how it looks a little weird for your first post here to be announcing your ownership of the sub . 
  not necessarily . 
  thats what the cows said . . 
   your son/daughter/sister / brother/father/mother, 
  i 'm not from the south so this person does n't exist in my family . 
  my reddit is stuck in spanish pls ayuda, 
  til the origin of polonium, 
  nice find !, 
  i agree from an objective point of view this might be unfair , but at the same time i 'm very interested to see if this new `` mechanic '' can create significantly more efficient designs in other levels . 
  definitely the most / r/oddlysatisfying video i 've seen in a while . 
  especially liked the camera angle starting at 1:14 . 
  just the way allah intended . 
  for anyone else who read this comment and thought there 'd be other hillariously dumb stuff in his post history , you 're right . 
  here 's one of the first :, 
   then there 's people like me : i just like telling people how dumb they are . 
  it gets the anger out . 
  i could n't give a shit if anyone actually reads it or even sees it . 
  it 's for me , not them . 
  hell when i get banned from a subreddit here i just post my rant on my facebook , instead . 
  i do n't care if it 's seen , that is n't the point . 
  so shadow banning me is the effective way to go . 
  gets me out of everyone 's hair and lets me keep getting the anger out . 
  everyone wins . 
  like you said , if i decided i cared enough about a legit ban i 'd just make a new account . 
  done it like six times before already . 
  hell i deleted one of my accounts just because someone claimed i would n't really . 
  then came back 10 seconds later on an account with a nearly identical name and did this gag where i acted like i was someone completely different and the names were coincidence . 
  he did n't buy it , but it made me laugh . 
  excuse my ignorance but at that age are n't boys and girls of similar strength ? 
  i was under the impression the gap in physical strength was n't significantly meaningful until puberty . 
  dude what lol, 
  thanks for the feedback !, 
   category :, 
  pets & animals, 
  fair . 
  shamoo needs to eat too !, 
  probably to escape from the great white shark swimming 20 feet behind him . 
  at least that 'd be my first thought if i was surfing . 
  similar situation here ; just got ta go the best you can man !, 
  likewise i 'm appreciating the feedback , just keep me posted !, 
  i 'll be honest , this was unexpected . 
  * science . 
  i get a pewdie vibe from this, 
  you 're forgetting that the most important thing we 're put on this planet to do is sex . 
  everything we do comes out of millions of years of our ancestors becomes smarter , more efficient fuckers . 
  now you may say , `` what about maslow 's hierarchy of needs ? 
  i thought first comes breathing , then eating , and sex falls somewhere down in the self actualization phase . '', 
  well sorry maslow , but the one cave man who focused all of his energy on breathing and eating , and never fucked anything , fell off the gene pool with no affect on modern man . 
  i do n't care if you 're starving to death with your head caught in a dryer bag , if you can fuck , you should do it . 
  now , you may be thinking , `` forget millions of years of evolution , i am sentient !, 
  i have been given a brain with which i can find deeper meaning and serve a greater purpose , something even better than sex ! '', 
  to that i say fine , you want to take a stance that is that self important to you species and yourself ? 
  then lets do just that . 
  we 're gon na need a yard stick though . 
  because human endeavor is based on many factors such as glory , honor , bravery , and altruism . 
  i think our yard stick should simply be the number of other human lives you touch . 
  well even the greatest celebrity , poet , inventor , or politician has an influence that is limited to the collective human memory . 
  but , if you fuck just a handful of time in your life , you have the potential to not just affect , but literally create 268,435,456 over the next 800 years ( assuming an average of 2 children per person with an average childbearing age of 30 , which i think is generous ) . 
  so , the next time you think you 're better than sex , think again . 
  we 're all just here to fuck . 
  would you mind linking me to the thread ? 
  how do people discover this . . 
  that would be le reddit armie . 
  ah yes , we actually already have these threads listed in the sidebar !, 
  i 'm not sure it 's worth permanently pinning a thread to the top of the sub for it but maybe i 'll ask krispykrem and see what he thinks . 
  chess . 
  it 's really not that bad compared to [ what they do to our landmarks . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e5/north_face_south_tower_after_plane_strike_9-11.jpg ), 
  i do n't think it can be considered `` leaking '' anymore now that it 's a default subreddit . 
  omg i bet that made your friend feel undesirable . 
  go on , tell me about her low self confidence . . 
  i got this . 
  pretty please ? 
  i laid my heart on the line and you said three things . 
  it 's all gravy on my side of the tracks jack . 
  [ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ source ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypms/comments/1sxxcd/we_only_dated_for_a_month_and_broke_up_over_a/ ), 
  it 's your 2nd top submission of all time . 
  figured it would be boobs or something funny ; it was something funny . 
  i 'm stealing that jack in the tracks line . 
  how are you coming to that conclusion ? 
  edit : you guys are right , this comment definitely deserved to be downvoted . 
   the guy formulated opinions before seeing the movie, 
  where in the article does he say that ? 
  wow that explains why i 've been making so little from it , til thanks . 
  wow that took an unexpected turn haha . 
  welp we all go for the wrong people sometimes , best of luck with your future romantic endeavors !, 
  do better drugs, 
  giant strawberries obviously,
