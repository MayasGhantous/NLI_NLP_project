  no complaints yet !, 
  holy shit that 's exactly the same as my work . 
  are you in socal by chance ? 
  seriously did n't expect to see cp on reddit . 
  he 's not saying they were 40 minutes late . . 
   we were checking out deliveries showing a time of 40 + minutes since order . 
  except there 's no / r/offasatvchannel subreddit with 2 million subscribers that has to constantly reaffirm amongst themselves that the one unifying quality they share is not a `` religion '' . 
  * just sayin . 
  `` did you know ` the los angeles angels ' translates to ` the the angels angels ' ? '', 
  carlin ? 
   i 'm ignoring the haters, 
  where ? 
  do you not see a difference between / r/atheism and / r/trees ? 
  do i really need to explain to you how they differ ? 
  / r/trees subscribers enjoy smoking weed . 
  what do people here enjoy doing , being atheist ? 
   because the reviewer clearly formed his opinion before the film starts . 
  . . again , how are you coming to that conclusion ? 
  i do n't see that . 
   i 'm 6 ' 2 '' and she was 4 ' 11 '', 
  preferred position ? 
  asking for a friend . . 
   a sign at a church i passed by said `` free snow '', 
  unearthing memories from christian middle school . . 
  pretty sure god sends them out to all the churches whenever he thinks of a good one . 
  appreciate the thorough response thanks !, 
   given burnie'a stance on the whole topic , it 's pretty obvious the founders do n't like the practice and wo n't be doing it themselves any time soon . 
  can you explain why you think this ? 
  he can help everyone make videos if he trademarks japan ^ ^ ^ tm, 
   disserves, 
  * eye twitch *, 
  better question : why are n't companies hiring only women if they can get away with paying them less than men ? 
  no they just have a lot of anxiety about their place in the universe and stuff . 
  according to the footer it was created using godaddy 's website builder . 
  this just reminded me of my reality that i have like a $ 500 speeding ticket i need to take care of . . 
  even on reddit i ca n't escape my life . 
  well i mean , yeah , it 's a going to be a huge cash cow . 
  imagine knowing what you know about porn now back when the internet was first starting , would n't you get involved ? 
  this is an opportunity for people to play their cards right and become unimaginably rich . 
  do you mean trying to win ? 
  because geoff won . 
  or do you mean trying to be funny ? 
  because jeremy was the most concerned about getting the most likes . . 
  the latter , allegedly . 
  the cop who wrote the citation is who quoted me on the cost but i have a feeling he does n't actually know , my court date is in a couple months so i still have time to look up the local laws ( socal ) and see if i can get it thrown out somehow . 
  first time getting a ticket ever . 
  i 'll be honest , your first comment ( that 's at -110 ) seemed like you were being a bit overly sensitive . 
  but all of the people responding to your comments truly make me embarrassed to have shown this website to my friends and family . 
  yeah the fees are ridiculously complex which does n't help . 
  i 've managed to do some light googling in my spare time and have found a few possible glimpses of hope . 
  one being that i can contact the local country clerk 's records and see the latest speed zone test for the area of road i was pulled over on . 
  if it has n't been tested in the last 5 years the ticket is ineligible ( assuming a judge upholds the letter of the law ) . 
  also i 've got some vague results that say there may be a maximum fine/penalty for first time offenders , which i am , so hopefully that would cap any repercussions . 
  do you have any experience fighting tickets ? 
  there 's one speeding ticket firm that charges like $ 150 for an 80 % win rate , but i wish i could find out which cases they win/lose so i know what my chances are ahead of time based on my specific case . 
  i just got it a few days ago , so no warrants out for me yet !, 
   in all fairness . 
  many ** `` conservatives '' are just working class people who have been manipulated ** through fear and a desire to ally themselves with a strong team . 
  they 're not evil people , ** they 're just confused and scared like children on the playground ** who stand by and watch the bully pick on the little kid . 
  maybe if they do n't call attention to themselves , they wo n't be the bully 's next target . 
  some of them will actually cozy up to the bully in order to feel safe . 
  i 'm not making excuses for them . 
  it 's shitty behavior , but i do understand it . 
  i ca n't believe the kind of shit that gets upvoted in this sub sometimes . . 
   girls do porn, 
  i guess entering the porn industry does n't take much in the way of writing skills . 
  where can i watch this, 
  if it reassures you , you would be the reason to `` go grab some milk '' when you were a child . 
  it makes no fucking sense to bounce just as soon as your kid is going through college because you 're so close to finally hopefully getting some payback from the leech like some nice christmas presents when they get a good paying job . 
  he seemed pretty calm . 
   in my experience larger women do n't draw attention to the fact that they are large or wear things that imply they are lazy . 
  i do n't know . . 
  there 's this girl on met through tinder who is admittedly overweight and her snapchat stories are always like `` breakfast of champions ! '', 
  showing twinkies and cupcakes , etc. 
   you can already make a party of 4 grave robbers and set shovels in provisioning screen for free money, 
  no you ca n't . 
  / r/sandersforpresident in a nutshell, 
   proceed to give his father a pair of tongs for the bbq every year for the next 20 years . 
  made me lol, 
  yeah smoking is out , hormone juice is in . 
  i too think they are ~ 14 - 16 . 
  i was honestly very surprised to open the comments and see people talking about how ` hot ' they are . 
  though as another poster said it could be a case of not noticing how young kids are when you 're closer to their age . 
  it 's easier for someone out of college to look at any of his female friends and say , `` yeah they look absolutely nothing like the girls in this picture . '', 
  5 points and gold . 
  you 've really struck a chord with some older dude who rates the hotness of 14 year olds . 
  running by them real quick from left to right i 'd guess 15 , 18 , 18 , 16 , 13 , 17 , 48 , 16 , 18 , 16 , 16 . 
  christie really won the debate overall in my opinion . 
  partially because he got lucky and was able to speak first when the world found out rubio is a robot who glitches and repeats the same sentence 5-6 times . 
  like which ones ? 
  both of those are obviously exaggerations but a lot people do agree with the merit of the underlying messages . 
  wow how neutral of you . 
   i guarantee you that country gets it 's ass sanctioned off in the un . 
  uh yeah , except the fact that the countries who are able to produce space weapons all have unilateral veto power for any un sanctions , which is the only reason the un still even exists . 
  have you tried / r/spacedicks ? 
  i actually think it 's fine in this scenario that the kid got tripped , but due to the absolutely ridiculous responses you 're getting i 've gone ahead and upvoted all your comments in this thread . 
  good day . 
  they are n't navy seals then . 
  god the world is so pc these days . 
  everyone is kenm .
