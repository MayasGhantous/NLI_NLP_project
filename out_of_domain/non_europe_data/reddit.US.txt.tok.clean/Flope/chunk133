   half the shit that makes the front page is probably set up and made to look real . 
  if something could hypothetically be faked , it probably is . 
  you 're not going to see real authentic moments , because they will be overshadowed by `` perfect '' fabricated moments . 
  you should treat everything you see on social media like a reality tv show . . 
  / r/sandersforpresident in a nutshell . 
  for real these comments made me remember how young reddit 's main demographic is when so many people are getting upset about girls snapchatting multiple guys . 
  let 's all just come together and be friends ^ ^ ^ for ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ karma, 
  is n't that what just happened to jared ? 
  or was that another guy . . some girl lied about her age . 
  i do n't keep up with the tabloids . 
  barbara looked like she was about to pass out haha, 
  just goes to show attractiveness can get you into any career field regardless of skill or talent . 
  wow i 've never seen some / r/hoverhand for 5 minutes straight , good job burnie !, 
  classic switzerland is just looking [ neutral as fuck . 
  actually if just half of sanders ' big policies are put into action our economy will be just like greece 's as well !, 
  tomorrow will be jeb 's supporter . 
  i feel like this type of low effort posting should stay in / r/sandersforpresident . . 
  unlike our lord & savior bernie ^ ^ ^ tm, 
  what ? 
  then what do you believe ? 
  i did n't know people debated whether or not clinton was using superpacs to fund her campaign . . 
  no no no , if someone does n't have the same political leaning as me then they deserve to die . 
  that 's like , reddit 101 . 
   she is all for citizen 's united . 
  whether she acts like it publicly or not . 
  citizens united originally became a thing in the media because they were creating a 90 minute `` documentary '' attack ad against hillary clinton . . she was openly against it before it even really started . 
  i 'm not sure where people are getting the info that she supports it . 
  this is one of the many reasons i believe they should not have live audiences at these debates . 
  at the very least they should ensure that cheering/booing does n't get picked up by the mics , but i guess that would mean less ratings . 
  it 's pretty much like a laugh track , so the viewers at home know who they 're supposed to like and when they 're supposed to boo . 
  yeah seriously , ca n't believe how rude some of these comments are . 
  i think honestly a lot has to do with the fact that the average age of members of this sub skews younger , so there are a lot of people still in that , `` i have to put others down to look cool '' age range . 
  loved ken 's constant `` me too . 
  '' 's every time someone claimed to be liberal . 
  i was surprised at how professional geoff was being , seemed to actually be taking the recording somewhat seriously , while still having fun . 
  you really use the word * really * a lot ; 4 times in the first 45 seconds . 
  just figured i 'd point it out in case you were n't aware of it . 
  anyways , great series i 'm enjoying it a lot so far , keep up the great work !, 
  damn reddit is bitter . 
  leaked script from next podcast, 
  * `` speaking of twitter , something happened after last week 's podcast that made me so god damn angry . 
  * `` after last week 's podcast ? 
  * `` yeah . 
  * `` okay , go on . 
  * `` wait wait a second . 
  let me see if i can guess . 
  last week 's podcast . . you were talking about the city of austin . . and you were talking about your dog being sick . 
  i would bet that you got a bunch of responses from people telling you why your dog is sick . 
  * `` yes !, 
  * `` i knew it !, 
  * `` oh my god man , the amount of fucking people , amateur veterenarians , on the internet , who think from one story they can diagnose the issues of an animal they 've never seen . 
  like , yeah , i never thought to go to the vet before , thanks a lot dude , i owe you one . 
  * `` haha yeah , gets under your skin a little does n't it ? 
  * `` it fucking , yeah , it got more than just under my skin . 
  * `` what does that mean ? 
  this week 's podcast produced by / u/flope, 
  it used to be a website . 
  lookin at you , sanders . 
   4 days ago, 
  just checking in to make sure everyone here is doing fine . 
   the man talking about forced registration . 
  i 've heard that from somebody 's mouth recently ... 
  [ not from trump 's . 
  ] ( http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2015/nov/24/donald-trumps-comments-database-american-muslims/ ), 
   i think they 're addressing trump and his supporters . 
  as they should . 
  educate yourself . 
  you 're only using 3 holes ? 
  i 'll downvote you too and we 'll both sit here at 0 !, 
  okay . 
  just watched the whole thing , that was great thanks for sharing !, 
  you listen to ots without watching it ? 
  huh , i never thought about doing that . 
  do you feel like you 're missing something by not seeing the visuals ?

  huh , i never thought about doing that . 
  do you feel like you 're missing something by not seeing the visuals ? 
  well that 's just out of respect , for not running my mouth , and talking about something that i knew nothing about . 
   the whole `` suck it up be a man '' thing negatively affects both genders . 
  excuse my ignorance but how exactly does this specifically negatively affect women ? 
  source ? 
  where did he say that ? 
   him endorsing the scam drug company, 
  those were members of the black lives matter movement , not trump supporters . 
  excuse me ? 
  this joke has been around for at least 30 years , probably much longer . 
  it seems like she does n't give any sources either , it 's just a lady talking . 
  i watched the 5 minutes so maybe the sources are at the end of the segment but i 'm off to work for now , will check when i get back thanks !, 
  wow this article is so incredibly biased it 's unreal . 
  but the source works for carson 's involvement i suppose , thanks for linking !, 
  this made me sad . 
  who the fuck is this again ? 
  how many 4-letter combinations did you have to try before you got your username ? 
  which ? 
  what 's that ? 
  my theory is he was in some horrific fire accident and looks like prince zuko from avatar except he also lost his legs and only has 1 arm . 
  oh right . 
  ( _ =-) . = = =o - ~ ~ a ~ y ~ y ~ ~ - lmao -, 
  this sub skews pretty young ; you 're basically telling a group of middle schoolers not to use the word ` gay ' . 
  it 's an uphill battle .
