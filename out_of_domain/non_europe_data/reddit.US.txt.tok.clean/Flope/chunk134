  i remember when / u/toskaa explained this post . 
  what he said has always stuck with me . 
  he says `` i + + '' two times when the second one should say `` j + + '' . 
  it 's a relatively simple mistake to make and op feels like it should n't weigh on whether or not he was considered for the position , but he believes it did . 
  is there one that can help me remember the parts of a girl 's vagina based on my knowledge of neurochemistry ? 
  she can be pretty cold at first but will warm up to you over time . 
  eventually you 'll find her hot . 
  i hope you 're talking about your face . 
  seriously do people expect that winning bulls get a free college scholarship and are able to live out the rest of their lives in the streets of barcelona ? 
  i 'm just going to upvote this in the hopes that it is n't calling her a slut or something . 
   i thought it was a joke about getting married and then a divorce due to spending too much time on the xbox ( the exact reason my sister broke up with her last boyfriend ) . 
  wait . . is n't this just supporting the ` joke ' ? 
  that women do n't like their boyfriends/husbands spending time playing video games ? 
  no juander people are upset . 
  this is so cool !, 
  i like this one the most . 
  this guy is going to be partying hard in server purgatory for years to come . 
  lol what a way to go out, 
  what will they do for their 100th anniversary !,

  can speeding get you eliminated from the race ? 
  i was wondering that when kurt was telling brody he could n't turn right at that intersection ; like what if he just did it anyways ? 
  did n't get it until this comment, 
   as someone who spends half his time in socal , i 'm ** hella ** hyped . 
  apparently not the better half . 
  do n't worry guys i [ got my best man on the job !,

  just poppin ' in to say you 're gon na have to reply to a lot of other redditors who do n't understand what you mean , but you 're correct . 
  fight the good fight , man . 
  ** slut : ** ( noun ) a woman who has many casual sexual partners . 
  does n't seem negative unless you personally believe a woman having casual sex is a bad thing . 
  like just about any word , it depends on the context it 's used in . 
  it 's not about `` the english language being wrong . '', 
  i guarantee you the girls i hung out with in college just a couple years back would not take it as an insult . 
  they self-identified that way . 
  it 's at 25:50 of this vod : https://www.twitch.tv/playhearthstone/v/61958673, 
  it surrounds the board in a purple mist basically , for the duration of it 's spellcasting . 
  + / u/user _ simulator / u/flope, 
  small world , they called me faggot . 
   i just come here for the banter , complaining and highlight videos . 
  i 'd expect nothing less from someone who used to be a reporter on us politics . 
  was marijuana the first illegal drug you took in your life ? 
  doing what backwards ? 
  they want you to feel bad when he 's eliminated next week is my guess . 
  could be . . 
  like full of lice ? 
  i wondered that too haha, 
  it would appear that thus far they 've only been arguing with each other when they 're alone , which would explain why the other racers seem shocked by how she 's being portrayed in the show . 
  thought it was a cool clip regardless . 
  you mean youtube red ? 
  maybe they just read reddit too much, 
  yet every day there are at least 5 front page posts promoting bernie sanders and reddit does n't seem to mind . 
  there were so many adjectives in that sentence i think my brain just exploded . 
  compare how many black people are employed at reddit to how many fat people are . 
  what the fuck is this stormfront that everyone is talking about ? 
  sounds like a star wars game, 
  why does it seem like everyone has heard of it but me ? 
  is it a popular site ? 
  if i 'm lucky . 
  i 'll share the downvotes with you man , not sure what the deal is with some people . 
  95 % of the `` chinese '' restaurants in the us are n't serving traditional chinese food though . 
  [ you 'd think the same thing looking at gallowboob .

  maybe i should start funding per video instead of per month . . 
  sad to see google removed the wadsworth functionality from their linking .

  holy shit you were n't kidding !, 
  last time i saw that sub it only had like 1,000 subscribers . 
  \\  everybody on this site, 
  i do n't think so . 
   `` it 's tough being a gay dude pretending to be a girl . '', 
  [ if this was actually a dude i would n't even care . 
  this comment confuses me . 
  you mean yoggy-dogg world , right ? 
   it 's been exploited to win at online poker [ 1 ] . 
  thanks for the good read !, 
  me neither, 
   i was in there because i got drunk and stupid , like cops called and guns drawn stupid . 
  go on . . 
   send me a print !? 
  buy it from him, 
  * posted on facebook *, 
  thanks for teaching me a new word !, 
  too late you 're colorblind . 
  so the question becomes ... which is your favorite burrito stand ? 
  i can think of a couple that are open after last call . . 
  i 'm an american who refers to my time in college as being ` in university ' while on reddit since i 've learned that that 's how most of the world refers to it and i do n't want other redditors thinking i went to a community school . 
  but in real life i obviously just say college because otherwise people would look at me funny . 
  i 'm a social chameleon , if you will . 
  you 're in the uk , right ? 
   also tipping bar staff is a thing ? 
  that 's probably the most commonly tipped position in the us . 
  people tip bartenders well and in return usually expect fast service ahead of other patrons who do n't tip or tip low . 
   if you work a job where you get tipped you make less than minimum wage ... 
  you actually make quite a lot of money . 
  your employer does n't pay all of it , but you almost always end up earning at least 2x - 3x minimum wage depending on where you work . 
  did n't expect to see a rooster teeth reference in here . 
  fatigue refers to a player running out of cards in their deck .
