  [ this is ryan 's twitch channel , right ? 
  ] ( https://www.twitch.tv/sortamaliciousgaming/profile ), 
  [ this is jack 's twitch channel , right ? 
  ] ( https://www.twitch.tv/jackpattillo/profile ), 
  neither of them show any broadcasts from monday , so would you mind referring me to the channel that * did * broadcast on monday ? 
  i have , i can see how it could appeal to adults as well as kids . 
  thank you !, 
  what if you did n't give your phone app access to your telephone ? 
  woah, 
  that 's what i thought as well , except maybe closer to ~ 15 % in my area . 
  why are people in this thread acting like literally every person who * can * get the shot actually should/does ? 
  inb4 herd immunity against the seasonal flu ( lol ), 
   the fact that he and hillary have a following just shows how retarded this nation is . 
  i 'm continually surprised at how long the sanders circlejerk has survived on this site . 
  i ca n't imagine how much money his campaign must have spent to get that started . 
   i just stare at them *** like i am some sociopath ***, 
  how do i put this . . 
  how old are you ? 
  i feel like this ca n't be true unless you 're retired or do n't work or go to school .

   humor is used as a coping mechanism . 
  pretty sure op is coping with anything right now except how to spend all his delicious karma .

  how did you convince your so to get tested ? 
  this is what i found , i 'm not sure if it 's the full thing, 
  hold jump and forward, 
  i 'd probably just write it off and fall asleep . 
  dying in my sleep is already my # 1 way to go . 
  til, 
  i use it as a misdirect when a girl has a very obvious anagram in her name . 
  in this case myra -  mary . 
  so they usually respond with `` yes '' to which i say , `` did you know your name is an anagram for rmya ? '', 
  or something similarly dumb and get a laugh . 
  75 % of the time it works every time . 
  you 've both killed it .

  `` i was shocked at how cool the u.s. coast guard web site was . 
  it had all the up-to-date information . 
  it was awesome . '', 
  edit : holy shit this is a really great article , did n't realize it was 6 pages long . 
  never heard of them before . 
  well now i have to watch it, 
  timestamp ? 
  are you gary ? 
  here 's the thing . . 
  hate this mentality . 
  having worked in a restaurant ( a pizzeria in fact ) , it 's really irresponsible to lie to customers about what food they 're eating . 
  just because they do n't have celiac disease does n't mean they ca n't be allergic to wheat/gluten , or be sharing it with a friend who has celiac etc. 
  there are better ways to `` stick it to the customer '' than purposefully serving them food with an ingredient they wanted removed . 
  as someone posted below , [ wheat is one of the 8 most common food allergies ] ( http://www.fda.gov/food/resourcesforyou/consumers/ucm079311.htm ) . 
  just my 2 cents . 
  i just linked to the fda . . 
  i think they would know more than either of us . 
  sure you may not have an allergy * to gluten * specifically , but you can be allergic to wheat , barley , rye and other products that basically leave you with a gluten allergy for all intents and purposes . 
  and that 's completely separate from celiac . 
  that must be why they love gay dudes so much . 
  not flope , just to be clear . 
  post history checks out, 
  based on post history , [ male ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/4at8xz/girls_whats_the_strangest_thing_youve_masturbated/d13npra ), 
  seems like the essence of / r/nofap, 
  do n't think you know what that word means . 
  [ this happened ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/1gvpb9/how_do_you_save_gif_to_camera_roll/caos5gg ), 
  what standards exactly ? 
  pretty sure the nyt has never served an ad containing malware in the history of their website . 
  lol no i was trying to figure out how to save an image on my phone and came across your 2 year old post,

  do the benefits of the card outweigh a 2k/year fee ? 
  if not , why have the card ? 
  for parties pbr is definitely top 3 cheap beers for games . 
  i 'd prefer mgd though .

   i have not looked at spoilers, 
   i have been following this film and the arg linked to it intently from the day the trailer dropped . 
  unsettling , creepy , terrifying, 
  i do n't understand the significance of the shave tbh, 
   he was kidnapping adult women rather than kids, 
  i think i still do n't understand the timeline exactly . 
  like , did n't the aliens actually attack right as he was ramming into her car and took her downstairs ? 
  when did he have the time to kidnap/kill this other girl if emmet went into the shelter right as he was closing the door ? 
  yup woke up my roommate in oceanside, 
  yup , first shake i was like , `` was that an earthquake ? '', 
  then like 3 seconds later it happened again . 
  `` yup . '', 
  \\ - oceanside, 
  people know what you meant , but in case you 're curious :, 
  * in the fridge * if the door is open and your looking in it for something . 
  * at the fridge * if you 're standing by it . 
  the most common/correct phrase in english would just be `` i was in the kitchen '' , most people do n't designate their location in a house by what objects they 're by but rather what room they 're in .
