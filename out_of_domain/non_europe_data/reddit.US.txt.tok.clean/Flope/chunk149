  and when i say we have no rules i really mean that . 
  be as rude , crude , and cruel as you want , we prefer to let nature run, 
  it 's course . 
  piss off enough people and eventually your uppins will come . 
  wheather you hunt players , raid chests , or earn your ore the old fashion way the choice is yours .

  so i was really happy with my classes as i somehow managed the perfect schedule while satisfying all of the pre-requisittes and requirements i planned to this semester , and then i get an e-mail informing me that my class has been moved to a different time due to room availability . 
  my question is , is it unrealistic for me to get from the second floor of the hss building to the third floor of the hum building in 10 minutes ? 
  and if so is it really a huge deal ? 
  i 've heard that i can be kicked for being late to class and also heard that professors do n't care so i 'm not sure which to believe . 
  ( both classes have ~ 25-30 students btw ), 
  thanks guys !, 
  bonus question : this alcohol safety/sexual assault prevention course , i have all semester to complete it right ? 
  or am i supposed to finish it before the year starts . 
  it was the first day of a new class and so the instructor thought it would be fun if we played a little icebreaker game . 
  so we were each supposed to take a piece of paper and ( anonymously ) write something personal about ourselves on it before folding it into a paper airplane and throwing it randomly across the room . 
  everyone would then scramble around and pick up an airplane and read what had been written so that we could get a better idea of some of the people we were classmates with without actually denoting and singling out a single person . 
  well , about 7 or so planes in it 's my turn to read what i picked up . 
  `` i am very shy , but am working on it '' , i read . 
  the instructor then addresses the class and says `` ahh i thought this one might come up . 
  there is no reason for anyone to feel shy here , i 'm sure by the end of the semester most of you will become friends through this class . 
  and luckily for you there are n't a lot of presentations in this class so you have nothing to fear . '', 
  cue the guy sitting a couple seats to my left who is pointing directly across the circle at a redhead girl whose looking at her feet and declares , `` hey i saw you fold that plane i can tell by the wings , you are n't shy !, 
  why would you write that ? '', 
  the poor girl 's face completely flushed and there was an awkward silence as everyone thought the only logical next step from that statement would be to wait for her to respond , which she did n't . 
  what terribly awkward social situations have you been a part of ? 
  hey all , so after following the latest video ( 22 ) and creating my grass icon for my sprite sheet , something seemed a bit off . 
  the edges were blank white and only half the tile was green . 
  i thought maybe it was because i was using photoshop and his method involved paintnet , so i downloaded that software and am still having the same issue . 
  i then decided to test it , so just saved my sprite sheet as the grid . 
  what i get in my game is a bunch of rectangles , it looks like the normal grid has been squished horizontally . 
  here are the three instances that i believe affect this , can anyone tell me if any of my math is off ? 
  thanks,

  ** [ update : picture ] **, 
  my roommate and i both failed our ds 110 class this past semester ( stupid freshmen ) but now i 'm wondering if i can take a course with a math 109 requirement . 
  the way i see it , my high score on the elm test is what originally allowed me to skip math 109 and go straight to 110 , but on the prerequisites i think they want me to have completed either 109 or 110 , which i have n't since i failed 110 . 
  what should i do in this case ? 
  the course i 'm trying to register for is intro to computer programming . 
  bonus question : how would i go about switching my major ? 
  thanks in advance , stereotypical freshman, 
  first heard it under related videos of ai n't no rest for the wicked on youtube and now can not find or think of the name and it 's driving me crazy . 
  i feel like there 's some lyric along the lines of , `` and they didnt know it was you all along '' and `` while they stand in line '', 
  know this is n't much to go off of , but maybe someone knows . 
  hello everyone , i guess i will start with my own introduction . 
  my name is bryan and i 've been programming as a hobby for the past ~ 3 or so years . 
  i first started learning with microsoft 's xna game studio back in 2009 which taught me a foundation of c # , though i primarily worked as an artist at the time . 
  i collaborated with a programmer and we created a simple game similar to the card game memory called `` match-it '' which was never fully released , though i 'm sure some digging could find it on the xna forums . 
  since then i 've taught myself a moderate understanding of javascript , having completed all of the courses available at www.codeacademy.com and made smaller projects for myself for fun . 
  i then got interested in making video games , so i spent a few months dabbling in java and created a small tile-based top-down rpg base just to have something that i 've created and could run around in . 
  since then i have gotten reinvigorated at the prospect of working in c # , renewed my xna membership and created a couple small private demos in that such as tower defenses etc. 
  and have since started learning unity3d , which thankfully combines all of my knowledge of 3d game spaces , c # and javascript into one . 
  javascript : advanced, 
  c # / xna / unity3d : advanced, 
  java : knowledgeable, 
  i am currently pursuing a degree in computer science in san francisco , so i would n't be available to work full-time ( unless obviously there is an offer i simply ca n't refuse . 
  a guy can dream ) but i am willing to work part time for compensation , or on smaller and simpler projects for free as a hobby with maybe an artist or another unity3d programmer . 
  i was inspired by some of the good charity work that certain users have been doing around the server ( see : western rail , noobgard ) and decided to make something myself . 
  i hope that people who use it find it useful , it required me to try and reroute the lava around certain parts of the track ( very difficult in the nether ; ended up breaking my prot iv pants swimming in it ) and took a lot of digging and effort with setting up the nether portals . 
  ** common courtesy usage : **, 
  - this first one is pretty obvious , but please do not grief the track . 
  it is there for everyone , including you , to use if/when you see fit . 
  this server is definitely pvp oriented , but it 's not helpful to anyone to wreck something that makes all of our lives more convenient . 
  - as it is a very long track , it is likely people might accidentally dig into it when exploring the nether . 
  please note that it is imperative that the track remain covered at all times , otherwise pigmen will enter the tunnels and hit minecarts or you might be shot by a ghast on the outside . 
  ** please replace any walls you break **, 
  - * edit : * i 've added chests on either end . 
  i will put a few minecarts in each so feel free to take them and use them to use the rail . 
  ** please put the minecart in the chest on the other end so that other people can use it later , thanks !, 
  ** going above and beyond : **, 
  - if you use the npt and find it useful , a great way to help would be by depositing some materials such as gold , iron or redstone into a chest at either end of the rail so that i can continue building it and possibly make different stations . 
  - on that note , if any of you are so inclined , please feel free to add other rail systems that start or end at the same portals so that patrons have other options . 
  it would also be helpful if you put a sign up stating the destination near the rail . 
  [ here are a couple pictures of me building it / using it . 
  * note : the coordinates will not be posted until i feel that the rail is in finished condition , this is just a post to enlighten people that may stumble upon ( which has already happened ) and an effort to make sure that when people do find it they realize it is a public service and leave it in good condition . 
  thank you , flope, 
  so i 'm a freshman , class of 2016 , and this year i right now i 'm living in the village on-campus . 
  it 's nice , but its real expensive and i do n't like having ra 's constantly knocking on our doors , fire drills , oversensitive smoke alarm systems , and megaphones in my room . 
  i do n't really want to go to park merced because i feel like it is just as bad in the sense that you are still being watched by the university . 
  and , i like to drink , maybe have some friends over as well . 
  in the first week of my first semester had the police called to our door by our ra 3 times . 
  i 'm trying to get away from that . 
  my questions are these :, 
  would anyone who has experience living both in the village and off-campus share some of the pros and cons of making the switch ? 
  i imagine finding a little townhouse not far from campus and splitting rent with 3 to 4 people would be cheaper than the $ 1,500 a month premium i 'm paying at the village . 
  thanks in advance !, 
  edit : also !, 
  are there any good ways to network and find a house available for cheap in the area other than craigslist ? 
  the chorus is a gun cocking , then firing i think 4 times before cocking again . 
  i swear the words after it are , `` better run better run '' * bang bang bang bang *, 
  but i swear it 's not pumped up kicks by foster the people, 
  i have been changing various stuff in my code for hours racking my brain for what could be the issue but i am still unable to grasp the finer points of networking . 
  i 've successfully used photon in the past to make a multiplayer racing test , but now in a snake game i am making i 'm getting a bunch of errors with photonserializeview and would love if someone could just hop in skype with me for a few minutes to help me out . 
  i would be forever thankful . 
  skype name is bcurran19 and i will be sure to post any updates or results back in this thread . 
  i liked you so much more than anyone else on this server . 
  my name is bryan and i have years of experience with various languages such as css , html , java , javascript and c # and some editors such as xna . 
  recently i 've grown fond of unity , and i 've created a few demos on my own for fun to learn the ropes of the editor . 
  nothing huge , just multiplayer snake and a simple fps and the like . 
  reply here or add me at bcurran19 on skype if you 're experienced with unity or want experience with it , or if you 're just a knowledgeable programmer looking for someone to bounce ideas off of .
