  best ,, 
  bryan, 
  hello everyone , i guess i will start with my own introduction . 
  my name is bryan and i 've been programming as a hobby for the past ~ 4 or so years . 
  i first started learning with microsoft 's xna game studio back in 2009 which taught me a foundation of c # , though i primarily worked as an artist at the time . 
  i collaborated with a programmer and we created a simple game similar to the card game memory called `` match-it '' which was never fully released , though i 'm sure some digging could find it on the xna forums . 
  since then i 've taught myself a moderate understanding of javascript , having completed all of the courses available at www.codeacademy.com and made smaller projects for myself for fun . 
  i then got re-interested in making video games , so i spent a few months dabbling in java and created a small tile-based top-down rpg base just to have something that i 've created and could run around in . 
  since then i have gotten reinvigorated at the prospect of working in c # , renewed my xna membership and created a couple small private demos in that such as tower defenses etc. 
  and have also been creating simple games in unity3d over the past year in my spare time , which thankfully combines all of my knowledge of 3d game spaces , c # and javascript into one . 
  c # / xna / unity3d : advanced, 
  javascript : advanced, 
  java : knowledgeable, 
  * edit : figured i 'd also add : *, 
  photoshop : proficient ( 7 + years experience ), 
  we are just now starting production on an ambitious new project that i think will fill a void in the market if done properly and with enough passion . 
  do n't want to give away too much in here but would be happy to share some key features of the design doc with those who inquire . 
  some main things :, 
  - ** open world **, 
  - ** pvp is always enabled ( protect yourself !, 
  - ** exploration and customization driven **, 
  i myself am one of the lead programmers and the lead designer on this project . 
  we are searching for people who can fit the following roles :, 
  - ** 1 - 2 programmers with shown experience in networking or multiplayer games ( all work is done in c # ) **, 
  - ** character artists / 3d modelers / environment artists ( all dependent on relevant experience , amount varies ) **, 
  - ** 1 sound engineer - samples needed , looking for someone comfortable experimenting in a medieval setting ( think weapon clashes , arrows , trees etc ) **, 
  we look forward to speaking with all who are interested , we primarily communicate via skype and are thus far all located in north america ( for time zone purposes ) but are open to our friends from around the world !, 
  we hope that upon completion of this game to continue to work with each other on future projects , and are in the midst of registering as an llc indie developer . 
  you can reach me by ** pm ` ing me here ** , adding me on ** skype at bcurran19 ** or if you want to be less personal and more public , please feel free to ** comment below ** . 
  thanks for your time !, 
  i 've been lurking in this subreddit for a long time now and from what i can tell there is somewhat of a divide in this subreddit about c++ , with a chunk of people saying it 's too difficult to learn off the bat and another chunk saying that it 's the standard for gamedev so do n't waste your time elsewhere . 
  i just want to skip this conversation and state that i 've already been using java , javascript and c # for years now and am fairly well versed in them . 
  that being said , i 've noticed the past few weeks while trying to teach myself c++ that there is an astonishing * lack * of tutorials geared towards c++ gamedev , unlike the other languages listed above . 
  i honestly do n't even know where to start !, 
  i have microsoft visual studio 12 and have been told that i should n't try to `` reinvent the wheel '' and should instead get used to using some 3rd party library like sfml which i 'm now trying . 
  couple questions :, 
  - if one of the reasons i decided to pick up c++ in the first place was to work with a more basic , or closer to the os language , i feel like i am undoing the whole point by using 3rd party libraries since then i need to include a bunch of nonsense that i did n't even write in anything i distribute , if it 's even legal to distribute with it !, 
  is this just par for the course ? 
  - what are some communities , youtube channels , etc. 
  that are geared towards c++ ** game development ** , the * very * little amount of tutorials i 've found thus far have been mostly dealing with console applications . 
  are there even communities like this that exist ? 
  how do people learn this language in the first place ? 
  sorry for blabbering on , i would really appreciate any tips or advice on this venture , thanks !,

  ^ ( to be fair , i did play the original bioshock demo on xbl and i thought it was alright , i liked the atmosphere of the ship wreck and remember being amazed at the water . ), 
  [ here is the video ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrypn2cpay8&feature=share&list=uuglcutwflwf2_sa9gzornsq ), 
  i 've wanted to do programming tutorials for a while since i love helping new programmers learn and solve problems . 
  i currently tutor computer science students at my university and would love the opportunity to reach out to younger and broader audiences online . 
  one thing i am particularly concerned about is the quality of my microphone , it is obviously less than optimal . 
  i do n't have access to a better quality one at the moment and am wondering if it comes off as a deal breaker to you guys ? 
  do you think i 'm wasting my time continuing with this setup or is it bearable and worth it ? 
  i can understand what i 'm saying when re-watching it but i 'm not sure if that 's just because it 's me talking . 
  another question i had was about the speed of the video , did i go too fast/too slow and at what parts ? 
  not necessarily talking about content i may have glanced over/missed , but instead the time between steps of things i am doing . 
  i noticed i apologized a couple times for going quickly , but re-watching it does n't look like i was actually going that fast . 
  what do you guys think ? 
  thanks for your feedback , and happy programming !, 
  bryan, 
  for myself i chose to kill trevor . 
  i did it thinking there was a 99 % chance that the game would not let me do it , as i could n't imagine r * would actually let me kill 1 of the 3 playable characters , boy was i wrong . 
  on the bright side frankie and mike are now sittin comfy with ~ $ 50 million each due to getting trevor 's cut on the last heist . 
  my question is : what do you guys do for fun now that the main story is over ? 
  obviously there are still random events and what not , but i guess i 'll just need to save up and buy some nice property and cars now ? 
  how the fuck am i supposed to make money when robbing the security trucks only gives ~ $ 6-8k and there 's no more assassination missions ? 
  [ serious ** game ending spoilers ** right here  ], 
  [ so i killed trevor . 
  r * gave me the option and i figured they would have never presented the player with a mission where 2 out of 3 options completely fucked you over for the rest of the game , meaning it 's impossible to 100 % the game or do any of the character-specific missions tied to that character or even buy property ( in this case the airfield ) that that character used to own . 
  when choosing it at first i figured there was no way it would * actually * even let me kill him , and that something would happen or a common threat would appear and we would hug it out . 
  but i did kill him , so then i figured , `` well shit i 'm sure r * will at least give some kind of reward for sacrificing one third of the games playability '' . 
  nope . 
  this has been my life for the past week , just ran out of parachuting missions on franklin and now i have no missions on either playable character and am only 76 % through completion . 
  with all of the tips and r * shoving this genius atm idea down our throats you would think that killing someone would allow you to loot more than $ 100 at a time . . really disappointed if this does n't increase . 
  that 's like , not even an efficient way to get money if someone were afk and you spawnkilled them repeatedly when simple robberies give $ 1500 - $ 2000 and many jobs/missions give much more than that for the same amount of time . 
  so much for player looting . 
  got any great ideas that you are surprised year after year are n't being produced by game developers ? 
  i 'm going to be out of state when this gets delivered and need to try and figure out how to get this package held at the delivery office or forwarded . 
  thanks for any info !, 
  just had the idea when watching futurama . 
  it reminds me of how today there are more liberal parties that are more willing to make sacrifices to help underpriveledged folks get a leg up , and more conservative parties that have a bootstrap-bill mentality . 
  do you think these parties would extrapolate further with the parties somewhat staying similar , or maybe everyone would adopt a `` humans first '' mentality , or have no discrimination at all . 
  the idea is simple , i originally put out a [ ** complete beginner programming ** ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrypn2cpay8 ) video as episode 1 where i covered declaring/setting/printing strings , and just yesterday uploaded a [ follow-up episode ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hw_sk4mdvuk ) where we make a guess the number game . 
  my plan is to gradually increase the difficulty of each `` game '' made and to cover the key concepts to making each one work . 
  for guess the number it was a while loop , and i will probably be making a text-based tic tac toe for episode 3 which will focus on nested for loops . 
  anyways i was wondering what you guys thought of the idea or the videos in particular , any feedback / critique / suggestions would be much appreciated .
