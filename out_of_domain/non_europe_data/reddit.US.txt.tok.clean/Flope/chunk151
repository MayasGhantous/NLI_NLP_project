  honestly it almost feels like it was just a slight mistake that these two values were already accidentally switched from the start . 
  it makes no sense , biologically or from a gameplay perspective , to have a generic item that can just heal anyone to full while also having another item that takes a lot of time/prep ( blood testing , finding a matching type ) that only does 20 % as much healing . 
  finding out your own blood type and trying to find/coordinate donors from within your friends or people you come upon is a fun and interesting part of the game , it seems dumb that all of that can only amount to an item that does 1/5 as much as a generic item found in buildings that everyone can pick up and use . 
  what do you guys think ? 
  i logged in to play today and it was the middle of night so i logged out and switched to a server that had some more people and was day time , when i spawned i was on the beach with no items . 
  my character got wiped . 
  i had a fully pristine/best attachment m4 as well as everything else i would 've needed to survive a long time and i 'm really bummed that i feel like this death was undeserved . 
  i do n't really want to play until this issue is fixed and hope it gets addressed soon , it feels like gta online all over again . 
  this is bullshit, 
  i won early december , like the 6th or so i think, 
  i 've written a bit about this series and why i 'm making it below if you are interested , but if you would just like to jump into the action here is the list of current videos in the series :, 
  - [ episode 1 : setting up and printing out ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrypn2cpay8 ), 
  - [ episode 2 : guess the number ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hw_sk4mdvuk ), 
  - [ episode 2.5 : arrays and for loops ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lveuqvbvoh4&feature=c4-overview&list=uuglcutwflwf2_sa9gzornsq ), 
  - [ episode 3 : tic tac toe ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r51bilat_hg ), 
  - [ episode 4 : methods in detail ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leyaadldy1e ), 
  - [ episode 5 : classes in detail ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfu4qawqnbw ), 
  ** goal **, 
  i wanted to make videos that were targeted at people with no prior programming experience but who were interested and wanted to learn a language , specifically those who might want to make video games later . 
  ** methods **, 
  i formatted this series very particularly in order to make it as enjoyable for people as possible . 
  since my target audience is new programmers i spent the first video covering how to setup the ide and how to print to the console . 
  something that 's very important for me is to show actual utility and how programming , even with minimal knowledge , can be applied to make functioning programs . 
  this is why right off the bat in episode 2 and 3 we make two simple `` games '' : guess the number and tic tac toe . 
  ** where i am now **, 
  after tic tac toe the next project i want to create with people is a large multi-class game with a graphical component . 
  this project is much more complex than what we have done so far so i am spending a few episodes getting people up to speed with some of the core ideas that will be critical to the development of this project such as methods , classes etc. 
  ** community ( the why ) **, 
  over the past couple years i have been fairly active in programming subreddits and try to help out and answer questions when i can . 
  this eventually led to some people posting or pm ` ing me asking me to make a video series to help newcomers which is the reason i 'm making this . 
  since the only `` promotion '' i 'm doing for this series is posting to reddit and a rather large percentage of viewers are redditors , i really value what comments , criticism and constructive feedback reddit can provide me so that i can continue to improve the format , so please feel free to post below or pm with suggestions . 
  thanks for everyone 's support and i hope you enjoy this series !,
