  since the only `` promotion '' i 'm doing for this series is posting to reddit and a rather large percentage of viewers are redditors , i really value what comments , criticism and constructive feedback reddit can provide me so that i can continue to improve the format , so please feel free to post below or pm with suggestions . 
  thanks for everyone 's support and i hope you enjoy this series !, 
  bryan, 
  i do n't see any possible way to benefit from numbers such as this and it just seems like money down the drain . 
  this was an ad on the front page , i also have one currently going on a specific subreddit and will update with the results of that when it finishes . 
  i guess i 'm asking , has anyone actually been really satisfied with the traffic for the amount they paid in this self-serve platform ? 
  i 've completed all of the halo games . 
  a long time ago i read a few of the books like the first strike and the flood something , but i was only like 10 and do n't remember any of it so i 'd definitely be willing to read those again if they are the best . 
  what book is your favorite and do you think it would be a good fit for someone just starting to read the halo series ? 
  i think i should mention right off the bat that i do n't have any * paid * industry experience , which is why i am looking for a junior programming position where i can continue to learn and grow as a coder . 
  feel free to skip my life story and head to the summary if you 're strapped for time and do n't want to hear the inspiring narrative of a young american man . 
  ** history : **, 
  i 'm a driven self-taught developer who has been learning various facets of game programming for just under a decade now , with my first kind of foray into game development coming from modding the xbox title halo 2 . 
  after that i first began learning ** html ** and ** css ** , along with ** javascript ** . 
  i was an early adopter of ** xna game studio ** back in 2010 , which i used to learn ** c # ** and then expanded upon that learning with about a year of ** unity 3d ** experimentation . 
  however right now i would say the language i 'm most comfortable in is ** java ** , where i consistently have 3-4 mini projects always open and in development that i just use to teach myself new things and find more efficient ways to do what i already know . 
  i 've actually recently started creating a [ beginner 's lwjgl programming series ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwp-xw0kylc&list=uuglcutwflwf2_sa9gzornsq&feature=c4-overview ) on youtube to make a little cash , as well as a general [ intro to java series ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?annotation_id=annotation_139550739&feature=iv&src_vid=hw_sk4mdvuk&v=jrypn2cpay8 ) .

  thanks for your time . 
  i 've recently posted to / r/gamedevclassifieds looking for work as a programmer and have received a few responses via e-mail but am a little hesitant to start working on something without legal assurance that i will be paid for my work . 
  without meeting in person and signing the papers , and also considering that my employers may just be an indie group of people and not a licensed llc or company , how are they to be held liable for work compensation ? 
  ^ edit : [ ^ ( here 's a link to my gamedevclassified 's post because why not shamelessly self-promote ) ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedevclassifieds/comments/1y1szv/programmer_located_in_san_francisco_looking_for/ ), 
  my friend has it and i ca n't join his party or games since we have different os versions , really infuriating . 
  i think i should mention right off the bat that i do n't have any * paid * industry experience , which is why i am looking for a junior programming position where i can continue to learn and grow as a coder .

  thanks for your time . 
  i live in ups and can hear them at least 1 - 2 times every week , is someone just fucking with them or is there actually like a microwave fire multiple times per week ? 
  fire engine just went past my house again , and i feel like if someone is just pulling it for fun it 's going to turn into a cry wolf scenario . 
  so yeah i got the thing back in 2008 , a time when i actually had money to spend and was also dumb enough to just buy a pre-built thing from dell . 
  i 've since been using a laptop while in university , but am now making youtube gaming videos for some extra cash ( and ramen ) and need to know what is necessary to get this old thing up to speed with today 's games . 
  i was originally just going to buy a whole new rig but am broke as hell and figured * something * must be reusable , at least the case/power supply/monitor . 
  it 's got a hdd already , small and should probably be upgraded but with my budget i 'm just focused on being able to run/record games in high settings as cheaply as possible . 
  i think it 's got ** 4gb ram ** , which probably needs to be updated , and my buddy is selling me his ** xfx radeon hd 6950 2gb ** for a graphics card . 
  advice , suggestions ? 
  i 'm all ears , and thanks for the help !, 
  edit : budget is as cheap as possible to achieve good results ( college budget ) , but i could probably manage to put ** $ 600 ** into the project . 
  sorry for potato quality . 
  i 'm trying to run games like bf4 on high settings and record , so given this deal above would it be cheaper to get this or to build my own ? 
  he built this one for ~ 1k supposedly , do n't know him too well . 
  so i 've got a budget of ~ ** $ 600 ** , and my buddy said that he 'll sell me his * xfx radeon hd 6950 2gb * for $ 85 . 
  i received a [ reply in my last thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/212918/build_help_looking_to_upgrade_my_gaming_desktop_6/cg8xs2m ) that said that [ msi radeon r9 ] ( http://pcpartpicker.com/part/msi-video-card-r9270gaming2g ) is significantly better and only about twice the price . 
  i 'm wondering what is the better deal here ? 
  the higher price would obviously cut into my budget more . 
  anyone got ideas for a build ? 
  ** i already have a monitor / keyboard / power supply ( hopefully right voltage ) / case ( dell xps 630 ) ** . 
  i 'm trying to reach a point where i can run modern games on high settings / record , does n't necessarily need to be bf4 on ultra but enough for it to look nice and get stable fps while recording , hopefully that 's possible within the budget . 
  any help would be much appreciated , thanks . 
  feel free to skip over the paragraphs below if you 're strapped for time , [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9wcwizhwx8&feature=youtu.be ) is a quick example of my voice , i 'm recording using a blue yeti microphone and audacity noise removal . 
  there is a slight background noise in the video only because i had to convert the original file to a video to upload it to youtube , the original has no noise and is what you would get . 
  hey all , i 've been involved with indie game dev for a while , and in fact produce a couple of youtube tutorial series for beginner java programmers ( [ intro series ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrypn2cpay8 ) , [ game series ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwp-xw0kylc ) ) . 
  i 've been [ told by a couple people that i should consider doing some kind of voice acting ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktytnqhvlww ) since i have a relatively deep voice , and can pull a mean radio announcer impression , so i figured why not !, 
  i looked up online how much professional voice talent usually makes and was shocked at how expensive it usually is , so i figured since the gamedev community has been so helpful to me maybe i could help them make their projects by offering some voice work for free if it 's minimal ( 15 or less lines - i just want to be credited ) or a relatively very inexpensive price negotiable depending on how much has to be done . 
  let me know what you guys think or if you want some other samples . 
  interested parties should e-mail me at : bryan@crosscoastgaming.com,

  any sales would be great , i 've actually already got a 750w power supply in my old pre-assembled dell desktop that i was planning on using but the way dell assembled it and drilled the screws in i ca n't get the fucking thing out . 
  works great , was just using it when up until i took the plunge a couple days ago and upgraded to a $ 500 + card . 
  excellent condition , just asking for $ 75 shipped or best offer . 
  feel free to leave a comment or pm me with any inquiries . 
  instead of paypal or maybe for a discount on the paypal price i 'd also be interested in any games before their street release date . 
  destiny , mcc , gta v for pc , etc. 
  figured i 'd throw that out there for anyone in the industry or with friends in the industry . 
  i do n't history good . 
  i ca n't believe 4 ** years ** later and civ 5 is still $ 30 to digitally download , as well as it 's expansion packs which have come out 1 and 2 years ago . 
  i remember when gods and kings first came out a couple years ago i decided to wait for the price to come down a bit since i 'm kind of broke , and now 2 years later it is still the exact same price . 
  ridiculous . 
  join up , we are going to be doing raiding when vault of glass unlocks in a week but for the first week we 're just exploring around , leveling and doing pvp . 
  if you are leveling without a clan you are missing out on grimoire cards and rewards . 
  - the way you join a clan on xbox is to join the group linked above then click `` set as xbox clan '' near the top . 
  [ here is a link to the video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awqqwtaikga ) , the mobs you need to kill only spawn in specific areas and if you are just trying to grind out the bounties as fast as possible it 's possible this one could tie you up like it did for my friend and i. 
  enjoy . 
  found this out way too late . 
  i 'm getting kind of confused here , it 's frustrating that the stats seem so interchangeable but is there a general answer to which i should strive for in pvp and why ? 
  i was going for attack since launch but recently heard that only affects enemies higher/lower level than you are . 
  i 've seen a lot of threads with people asking questions about what strange coins are , how to get them and what they use them for . 
  i decided to put up a video real quick to show where to find the guy and answer some common questions i read on this sub and elsewhere , let me know if this was helpful or not .
