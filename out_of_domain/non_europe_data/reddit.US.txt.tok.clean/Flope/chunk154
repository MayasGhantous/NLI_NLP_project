  once you have all of your fireteam members in a position , the boss fight, 
  itself becomes very straight forward . 
  simple follow your role and keep, 
  wittling down the walker 's health until he finally collapses . 
  there, 
  are no tricks or special events here other than maintaining member safety, 
  and watching for incoming missiles . 
  after one leg has been damaged enough, 
  the boss will fall temporarily and expose his neck for extra damage . 
  try, 
  to keep firing on legs that have not yet been broken for maximum damage . 
  hey so i saw [ someone post on here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/destinythegame/comments/2gfn8q/new_way_to_get_into_the_glass_area_on_venus_being/ ) that they glitched into the vault of glass by putting their speeder bike against the wall but they could n't record it , so i figured i would since it took me a while to figure out exactly what he meant and how he did it . 
  [ here is a quick video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_wul1oafpw&feature=youtu.be ) of me getting to the spot and walking around the vault , ca n't wait for tomorrow !, 
  credit : drpsyc, 
  my clan is going for one of the first clears and this 5am start time is a challenge more brutal than any nonsense they are going to throw at us within the vault . 
  guess i got ta break the news to my clanmates , it 's gon na be a looong night . 
  [ here is our clan ] ( http://www.bungie.net/en/clan/detail/177458 ) to join . 
  we are looking for 2 more members to join us for the launch of destiny 's first raid and attempt the world first boss clear . 
  we are meeting 15 minutes prior to it 's release to establish the fireteam and buy consumable and meet up . 
  add ** urstuck ** on xbl and message me saying you will be available tonight . 
  higher levels will be given priority , as well as people able to communicate on their mic clearly at that time . 
  hey guys we had a rough time finding our way through this cavern but eventually made it through . 
  this path seems to be the easiest way since we 've done it 6 times without problem . 
  hey guys so [ my clan ] ( http://www.bungie.net/en/clan/detail/177458 ) and i decided to try and clear the vault as soon as it opened at 5am est. 
  being among the first ones in the darkness we ran into a lot of stupid mistakes and wasted a lot of time figuring stuff out that other people should n't have to . 
  we 've made series of guides for each section of the vault of glass , let us know if these helped you or perhaps another strat you 've found successful . 
  - [ opening the front door ] ( http://youtu.be/uy_mdt8tmpc ), 
  - [ the templar phase 1 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbr1mxtlpam ), 
  - [ the templar phase 2 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yacjpjql8fg ) ( revolutionary method ),

  - final boss phase 2 : defeating atheon [ ( in progress ) ] ( http://i.imgur.com/8axnul7.jpg ), 
  hey guys my clan downed atheon a couple days ago and we decided to put out a guide of exactly how we did it so that other fireteams could have the same success . 
  i 've noticed a surprising lack of anything similar other than a couple text-only guides but if you 're like me there 's nothing as easy as seeing the real thing . 
  [ here is a link to the video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iptwqao6moq&list=plqewimtzn6ynlupobekzbbnxesyxbmijg&index=7 ) , let me know in the comments if this helped you or if you had a different strategy that you found successful . 
  i watched america : the story of us and thought it was really fantastic and have been searching for something to scratch the itch of another similar type of series . 
  sorry if this is the wrong sub , but you lot seemed like the best people to ask . 
  hey guys my clan and i decided to postpone our raiding in order to clear the new queen 's wrath event . 
  it was a little confusing at first so i made a quick video showing exactly what you need to know so that you can jump into the action as fast as possible . 
  ** [ here is a link to the full video guide ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hydfp_rt92c&feature=youtu.be ) **, 
  here is a rough transcript , but the video really makes it more clear :, 
  * this is a quick guide to the queen 's wrath event in destiny . 
  so the queen 's wrath event is the first time there is a special event available during the weekday instead of the weekend . 
  this event introduces a brand new faction that you can find in the tower . 
  first you want to go towards the back past the crucible match and you 'll see the back of the tower is open with a quartermaster in the back . 
  * this quartermaster sells gear and items based on your reputational level with the queen 's favor . 
  in order to raise your reputation with the queen 's favor you need to complete specially marked bounties , these bounties are available at the same bountymaster as regular bounties . 
  although the rewards initially look tame , only offering xp and reputation , the true reward is a mission which is automatically accepted by the player upon turning in a bounty . 
  * these missions reward legendary and exotic loot after completion , and are a fast way to earn high level gear . 
  so make sure to get your reputation as high as possible with the new faction before time runs out . 
  * until next time . 
  i 'm having a hard time reconciling the concept of infinity with the idea of complete improbability . 
  according to ( one of the many ) multiverse theory , there should exist an ** infinite ** amount of alternate universes , thus there must be one for every conceivable outcome to have taken place since `` the beginning '' . 
  following this reasoning there must be one where i chose to wear blue socks today instead of white , one where i chose to eat baked beans instead of broccoli with dinner , etc. 
  but is it also believed that there are universes with impossible outcomes ? 
  is there a universe that has been completely parallel up to ours for all of time up until right now when suddenly the earth turns into an umbrella , or my left arm begins speaking to me with an australian accent ? 
  how can every outcome exist when so many outcomes are impossible within our conceivability ? 
  edit : was n't sure what to tag this under ( math maybe ? ), 
  so i put physics , let me know if i should change it . 
  fuck apple , feed the iworm !, 
  so there is this new `` flying '' glitch in the tower that pretty much lets you glide to anywhere in the front part of the tower . 
  i wanted to make a [ ** video guide on how to do it ** ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3ajbo-zzx0&feature=youtu.be ) because i want to see all of the insane places people are going to be able to get to now . 
  in case you ca n't or do n't want to watch a video , it 's kind of hard to explain but basically when you spawn in the tower you go up to the left up that staircase and then turn right and you 'll see a chest on the ground against the wall . 
  hop on the chest then hop up to your right twice to the higher chests , then turn around and you should be able to jump onto this long blue railing . 
  from there if you sprint forward and continuously hit the jump button you can aim and steer your way all around the map from the height of the ceiling , just watch out for the kill barriers !, 
  please post here if you find any cool new spots and how to do them so i can try !, 
  hey guys so i know some of you are at work/school etc. 
  and ca n't log on at the moment or simply have no idea what the iron banner is , where the vendor is and what he 's selling and how to unlock rewards so my buddy and i jumped in and make a quick guide on the basics . 
  [ here is the full video guide ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fooirbolnjw&index=24&list=plqewimtzn6yl23kntpnanipsioy0qra8y ), 
  let me know if we missed anything important , i 've also compiled a list below of what he 's currently selling for each class ( you can see what it all looks like in the video ) , and will update it each day with his new loot . 
  good luck guys !,
