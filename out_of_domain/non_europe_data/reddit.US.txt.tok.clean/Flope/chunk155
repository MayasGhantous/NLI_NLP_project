  edit : [ here 's a video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7yhetgajls&list=plqewimtzn6ykaa_hqago9y1vngivewbxn&index=4 ) going over some of the new cards revealed so far if anyone 's interested , i think it 's interesting . 
  thanks, 
  fun times . 
  guess i 'm glad they 're resetting ranks at whatever point in the future . 
  hey guys so i 'm a huge forge fan and h2 anniversary opened up a whole new level of customization with their scripting options . 
  after experimenting for hours i made an easy to follow video guide on the basics for total beginners to scripting . 
  here 's the link : http://youtu.be/wpavtpizozq, 
  let me know what you think . 
  ** update : ** wow thanks everyone for the support !, 
  i got a lot of requests asking for a video explaining spawning/despawning using the ` spawning ' channel of objects : [ here you go !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgeqvynwawm&index=2&list=plqewimtzn6yklo0eomore-kopu-l2ktoc ), 
  hey guys so a lot of people seemed to really enjoy [ my last post ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/2m5o14/the_complete_beginners_guide_to_h2a_forge/ ) and i got a lot of requests to make a followup video showing how to get objects to spawn/despawn using the ` spawning ' channel attribute in forge . 
  [ so , i did just that !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgeqvynwawm&list=plqewimtzn6yklo0eomore-kopu-l2ktoc&index=2 ) ^ ( < - video link ), 
  let me know what you guys think and again feel free to ask questions / suggest any future guides that you think might be helpful to people . 
  i know the basics of the lore so far ( been playing wow since bc ) , but i did n't really get too into the story of cata or mop despite playing at max level for a while . 
  is there a good video or read somewhere that could quickly explain what i need to know ? 
  i 'm maybe 30 minutes into the new xpac and see all these names popping up on orcs that i already do n't remember and feel it will be important . 
  thanks !, 
  ** king of the hill : **, 
  when the game starts there will be no hill , and one will not spawn for the entirety of the game . 
  ** race : **, 
  though checkpoint * scoring * works , they do not respawn the player at the checkpoints , even when flagged as spawn points manually . 
  there is currently no way to spawn a player at the correct portion of the race they died on , even using workarounds . 
  kinda sucks that with mm broken i just wanted to make some fun maps for customs , only to find out they did n't spend any time on that part of the game either . 
  not complaining just wanted to make sure i 'm not doing something incorrectly on my end that i need to fix . 
  i play on a very high pop server called sargeras , and it 's gotten to the point where today the first thing i did when i woke up this morning was login just so that i could play for an hour or so before going to bed tonight . 
  here 's a screenshot of me right now , after waiting ~ 7 hours so far : http://i.imgur.com/cainnv5.jpg, 
  if so , would you mind detailing your exact steps ? 
  i 've heard it 's impossible . 
  huge fan of forge and ca n't wait to see what people make with these !,

  343 previously releases a statement that said after searching for 4 - 5 minutes with no results you will not find a match after that , and to back out and restart your search . 
  i was just searching for ~ 20 minutes while redditing and it eventually plopped me into a lobby . 
  might be helpful to those still looking for games . 
  i was wondering why [ ccg ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7icic25qgi ) had n't put out a video but figured they were just running late . 
  happy turkey day guys, 
  i recently did my first build about 8 months ago and it 's going well so far , i needed a rig that could play new games near the highest settings and still be able to record as i make a living on youtube , and thanks to the nvidia card i got shadowplay is making that possible . 
  now i should say ( in case it is n't already obvious ) i know almost nothing about building a pc , and recently with all the black friday sales going on i 've heard a lot of people commenting about some of the psu 's saying `` yeah a good psu is by far the most important part of a rig '' , is this true ? 
  i think the one i got was like bronze certified or something , is there any way to tell without opening up the pc and checking ? 
  would upgrading to a better rated psu with more w improve performance , and could it somehow damage anything if the amount of power being produced far exceeds how much my system needs ? 
  thanks for all the help guys !, 
  seems like quite a significant oversight , let 's hope this kind of thing is resolved under hawtre 's rule . 
  hey guys we 're looking for 3 more xbox one raiders who are looking to chase world first with us tonight . 
  a few of our original crew ca n't make it , you may know us from our mediocre youtube raid guides if you are 18 + , do n't mind your voice ending up on our youtube , and can play starting at 4am est to at least noon please message me and together we can shoot for , and most likely fall short , of world first . 
  leave your gt here and i 'll shoot you a party invite when we 're forming , or feel free to add me on xbl : urstuck and send a message saying you found me on reddit . 
  only level 30s obviously and we will be giving priority to people with higher upgrades, 
  here they are separated by encounter :, 
  - [ here is the first weight of darkness gauntlet ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsrcxmqw06e&list=plqewimtzn6ymtnztfbt-bto-dqtl1ou-y&index=1 ),

  - crota encounter ( in progress ), 
  hey so my buddies and i were exploring around trying to find a cheese spot and stumbled upon a way to get on top of the mountain and pretty much get anywhere in the entire raid . 
  [ here 's a video showing how ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdceb5tnqnu&index=4&list=plqewimtzn6ymtnztfbt-bto-dqtl1ou-y ), 
  let me know what you think and post a comment here if you find any easter eggs or chests !, 
  [ did n't even realize i was recording voice , thought you guys might enjoy it . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfdnxqbyeec&list=plqewimtzn6yl23kntpnanipsioy0qra8y&index=1 ), 
  hey thought you guys might find this helpful , apparently it 's possible to remove the debuff that prevents players from regenerating health throughout the crota fight , meaning there 's no need to even pick up and manage the chalice anymore . 
  just tried it and made it way easier to down the boss , [ here 's a link on how to do it . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oy1rhuday9a ), 
  edit to clear up some misconceptions :, 
  - this does not make beating the enrage harder , timer does n't start until you exit the room . 
  - this is doable with a 100 % success rate if you time it correctly , not finnicky . 
  - this allows every member of your fireteam to constantly regen health throughout the fight , including the sword holder . 
  i 've been stuck at 0 % loading for 30 minutes now , tried multiple levels with the same result . 
  it 's weird since i 've done a couple levels already and had no issue , did a recent patch break it ? 
  anyone else have this problem or advice on fixing it ? 
  i 've already tried restarting the game a couple times . 
  thanks . 
  if i have to i 'll go in individually and remove each one out of the 90 minute recording , but even so i do n't know exactly how i would do it . 
  simply lowering the amplification at these points makes it sound unnatural , as does cutting off the tops entirely . 
  sorry i 'm not quite an audio engineer i just make some stuff for youtube . 
  thanks !, 
  i built the machine about a year ago and it 's been doing fine , i do n't recall the usb ports having any issues originally but admittedly i do n't use them that often . 
  it 's at the point now where plugging in my iphone wo n't even register as a device being plugged in and will randomly start/stop charging the device if i leave it in for a few hours , same with my ipad ( different cable ) and any usb flash drives i try putting in the front wo n't work . 
  i 've upgraded a couple parts since buying it , so is it possible that the psu ca n't provide power to all of the parts ? 
  are the front usb 's usually the first to go in this case ? 
  otherwise , what could be causing the issue ? 
  thanks !, 
  what do you guys feel like has the most value ? 
  i originally was n't going to spend any extra money on the game but unfortunately it 's gotten to the point where only 1 or 2 servers have no dlc maps and are close enough to me to have low ping . 
  i usually enjoy playing large 64 player games of conquest or rush if that helps at all . 
  thanks !, 
  got extra lucky today since the sparrow was all i wanted . 
  [ i uploaded a quick video ] ( http://youtu.be/a7kkniti4t0?list=plpmdugqab6tph_ftn60gwc0nqfag0vt25 ) showing off both for those who have n't gotten to see them in-game yet , pretty cool !, 
  though i 'm not sure about using the shader in pvp since it seems to be more noticeable in the dark . 
  what do you guys think ? 
  just ran hard mode a couple times and people in my group seemed to think that the knights spawned a couple lamps earlier than they usually do in the abyss . 
  can anyone else confirm/deny ? 
  i 've lost the will to live on . . 
  i just want to access/send e-mails from my gmail account using my @mydomain.com email address ... 
  i set it up like that 4 months ago on a different account and the tech support agent did it all for me . . now they do n't seem to have any clue what to do . 
  also i 'm not the owner of the youtube channel if that matters . 
  thanks !,
