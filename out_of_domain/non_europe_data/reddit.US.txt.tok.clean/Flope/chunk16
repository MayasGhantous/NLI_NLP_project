  deep . 
  so i need to either be facing directly up or down for this to work . 
  itt : go to a doctor there is n't much time !, 
  electrophysiologist told me they can happen for any or no reason . 
  ( i know , i hate the ambiguity as well and he ended up getting a little unnerved because i kept pressing him for answers he clearly did n't have ), 
  he also said that excessive alcohol intake will almost always increase the frequency of events the next morning , which seems to be true for me . 
  source : in college, 
  wait that 's true , i wonder if there were any other births in that section before it was renationalized ? 
  great for birds maybe . 
  but i ca n't think of any that can swim anywhere near as well as today 's humans . 
  i like where this subreddit is going . 
  [ ice soap ? 
  thanks qkme_transcriber !, 
  another quickmeme transcribed !, 
  shhh shutup shutup, 
  ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ am, 
  spoiler : he is n't, 
  i know the feeling : c, 
  op i know you are probably joking but that 's a dog . 
  woah dude . 
  i 'm afraid divorce is the only option . 
  can i stay with you for the summer ? 
  sweet !, 
  now i just need to find a job over there so i can make the rent . 
  wait is this true ? 
  close enough . 
  `` need beer for money . 
   speedtest site is too slow for fiber so they have their own dedicated fiber one, 
   downvote for captain obvious, 
  this is fucking incredible . 
  dick pic warning ^, 
  holy fuck you know joe and zander op ? 
  i like the meta cringe , op . 
  more important than reddit ? 
  irs hangs a sign on their window stating , `` greetings anonymous , we have your findings in the amount of $ 85,000 , please come inside and collect . '', 
  okay , so swim and a couple buddies watched this for the first time coming down from some lsd . 
  it was really good . 
  the graphics are n't aaa , but it really made me appreciate a film beyond the production quality , if you just look past some of the goofy cgi and let yourself suspend disbelief it is a great film imo . 
  why did you choose to not upload the images to imgur ? 
  it 's making it impossible for me to load them on your site , possibly due to traffic from this thread . 
  i 'm sure others are having the same issues as me but have n't bothered commenting , i look forward to seeing it !, 
  wow the graphics are great !, 
  i love the little lizard-alligators . 
  i like the name . 
  oh you motherfucker so now it 's my responsibility to keep him alive ? 
  okay i see your angle here . 
  in all honesty i was so completely thrown off by the last scene i had simultaneously the biggest grin and most heart-wrenching frown on my face . 
  well done . 
  after 19 years i literally created an account and logged in to upt0ke this !, 
  lel my good day sir 100 uptoke ducks and geraffes . 
   ** all ** women are animals, 
  ftfy, 
  can you get me a job in america !? 
  i would be ^ so happy . 
  jesus can i just be on reddit for a day without seeing this link 4 times ? 
  most of these just seem to be people hindering intentional suicides . 
  hardly heroic imo . 
  wow , this made me laugh harder than anything ever has on reddit . 
  are you kidding me ? 
   not to say women do n't help , but in this selection of clips very few do . 
  everyone should react like the people taking appropriate action in these videos . 
  i also did that yesterday , except i 'm not a custodian i just have a terrible room mate . 
  what fucking snobs do you work with where they would all stand around a pile of papers on the floor and be like . . 
  `` well . . 
  i 'm not picking this shit up , i guess i 'll call the custodian . '', 
  wait ... * me * ? 
  is that really you ? 
  what is the common sense that i clearly am missing ? 
  ^ ^ i 'm ^ ^ serious, 
  i do n't think you understood . 
  he is not saying that girls in a fwb relationship are sluts , but rather that sluts are easier to initiate a no strings attached relationship with . 
  fuck i 'm so jealous . 
  i was so looking forward to staying by myself somewhere over the summer , but i was n't able to find a job so i 'm going to have to stay with family between semesters . 
  no one wants to hire someone with no previous experience . 
   i think he is trying to imply talking about it openly will somehow get back to his daughter and embarrass her . 
  that 's what i thought it was , thanks !,

  at least he is n't walking around pretending to only have unenchanted iron armor anymore . 
  i really like skittle5 ' solution in the hcsmp forums :, 
   a thought that i had a while ago would be making it so if you are combat tagged and throw a pearl , it increases the length of your combat tag . 
  essentially how it would work is ; if you 're combat tagged and use a pearl , the damage counts as a hit in pvp and resets the combat timer back up to 60 seconds . 
  i 'm dead from pvp as well this month . 
  perhaps next month if we are both online we can be buddies . 
  what 's your in-game name ? 
  lax , ** flope & co. ** invites you to base with real players instead of benbrez .

  i posted the co-ords to strudall 's base , does n't take a genius to find that . 
  thanks for the shoutout !, 
  haha, 
  looks like you 've killed 13 people this month , two of which since you just posted this comment . 
  i only killed one person this month while i was being ambushed . 
   do n't trust flope . 
  seems legit !, 
  what did i lie about , nerd ?
