  in the sidebar is a link to / r/gameassets , 
  all android apps are compiled in java . 
  so that 's something . 
  why are people hating on microsoft for this it does n't even make sense . 
  it takes balls to take the approach that microsoft is right now . 
  they are n't hiding anything , they are n't slyly contorting words and whispering under applause like how sony announced you need to pay for multiplayer on the ps4 . 
  the xbox one is an always connected device . 
  they 've said it needs to be that way for the options they want to allow developers with persistent worlds . 
  if you do n't have internet access , why the fuck would you buy one ? 
  edit : that being said i 'll still be getting a ps4 this generation instead , because fuck always connected . 
  but that 's just my opinion . 
  the nsa must have been doing a great job until recently . 
  / r/hungergames, 
  suspicious username . 
  ... is this some kind of joke ? 
  how come everyone 's sentences end right when they start talking about how they want to do something ? 
  imo we should just plant c4 underne, 
  yeah the one thing i would want to do to my would-be rapist is get him arrested and evicted when he knows where my family and i live . 
  theon ? 
  god i fucking hate naggers . 
  why did you feel the need to say he was masturbating ? 
  what does that mean ? 
  til, 
  where did this come from ? 
  i 've never had good experiences with slants , i say fuck em . 
  i still think that 's a bit different than looking down and seeing a needle in your vein filled with lsd and saying , `` yup , this is definitely a good idea . '', 
  well here 's the thing , did you upvote this post ? 
  i did . 
  and it seems both of us already knew the til . 
   i just upvoted so other people could see . 
  thank you !, 
  i was concerned . 
  what ? 
  are you cheating on me ? 
  front page of / r/gaming and only three comments !?!? 
  i 'm not missing this gravy train !, 
  - microsoft is bad and works for the nsa !, 
  - sony is so funny and cool hahah, 
  - wow , a camera ? 
  - glorious pc master race chek1ng in !!, 
  - clearly the best option : [ steam , board games , cards , nintendo ], 
  - has everybody already forgotten . . [ relatively recent announcement that everyone still remembers but instinctively upvotes because they feel they are in the minority who do . ], 
  - woah microsoft really did a. . . ^ ^ puts ^ ^ on ^ ^ glasses ** 180 !!, 
  ** i think that should cover this thread . 
  apparently it 's tori black, 
  ... and ? 
  unstuck has read and agrees to these rules . 
  what 's his job got to do with it ? 
  looks more like broccoli juice . 
  well how would he know if the cheese is good without rubbing his balls on it first ? 
  the cat ? 
   do n't listen to anyone who 's trying to tell you shit about c++, 
   you have made the right choice with c++ , it is currently the language to make computer games . 
  the wife said `` for '' though not the guy who actually drank the potion . 
  schoooooools out , for , ** summer !, 
  such a good movie . 
  * back in the dugout *, 
  `` did you guys see that !? 
  i hit that ball so hard i practically killed that kid ! '', 
  i promise you nothing you program will compile in 100 years . 
  look i do n't know shit about shit . 
  i 'm a self-taught programmer who over the past decade has worked with javascript , java , c # , python and c++ . 
  you undoubtedly have a wider breadth of experience and knowledge , i just found it silly to say that any language will be around in 100 years time that we use today considering the incredible advancements in technology just in the past 3-4 years and the fact that c++ has n't even been around half as long as you claim it will be viable in the unforeseen future . 
  and since we 're talking about c++ , i just recently started teaching myself it and am rather discouraged by the lack of online resources for beginners relative to the help available online for other languages like java etc. 
  do you know of any good places ? 
  i got the c++ primer book as i heard that 's pretty good , but i must admit it 's rather slow moving for someone with experience in other environments and does n't really cover the kind of stuff that i plan on mainly using c++ for which would be gui applications and games . 
  best ,, 
  bryan, 
  this also happened to me but the installer window still loaded upon clicking `` ok '' on the error . 
  windows 7 64 bit os . 
  not motivated to go post about it in a forum board , my apologies . 
  and congrats on the release !, 
  hey thanks for the help !, 
  if you ever are in the mood for some good will i 'd love if i could find someone to just talk with me in skype for like 5 minutes to help me setup my first application , i feel like from there i 'll probably be a lot better off and more comfortable working with it . 
  also i think c++ primer is basically a shortened and summarized version of the c++ programming language , though i could be mistaken . 
  it is written by an associate of that author though . 
  edit : correct me if i 'm wrong , but is n't compiling c++ code into javascript inherently limiting the potential or scope of the original script ? 
  i do n't understand at all how something like that would work , or what it 's purpose would serve . 
  i guess if you wanted to develop something for the web using c++ ? 
  do n't be ridiculous . 
  would n't it be simpler if every woman in the world just drew an arrow ? 
  seems like you have something to prove . 
  was germany selling arms to england or something ? 
  edit : thanks for clearing that up , pals !, 
  * god, 
  * you are both stupid *, 
  * arguing over nonsense *, 
  * and my name is flope so i 'm not bound to your stupid rules . 
  yes it is, 
  you can do it !, 
  yeah the after-meal cigarette is probably only topped by the after-sex cigarette . 
  though it could be a close tie to the commute to work/school cigarette , even though that one probably is n't normally as satisfying as the quick lunch break smoke . 
  source : quit 14 months ago . 
  anyone reading this , do n't start . 
  must . . have . . more . . 
  ** activism : better than bing **, 
  it 's some stupid new feature that i assume happens when someone deletes their comment . 
  he just posted a gif of some guy stuck upside down in a float in a pool . 
  perfect . 
  man i have n't banged some pot in ages .
