  hey do you know what season/episode this is from ? 
  thanks, 
   `` you know , this way i get more presents '', 
  ftfy, 
  grownups did start a rumor about this . 
  edit : read the comments, 
  if he tells anyone about this mannequin story he wo n't have to worry about it . 
  a better idea would be to fill it with water with a hint of vinegar , she 'll never want soda again . 
  hahaha this is the best one, 
  yes but how old * was * he ? 
  ^ ( ^ this is ^ incredible ive ^ been putting ^ arrows in ^ front of ^ every word ), 
  everyone is different so unfortunately anyone that says , `` i tried x and y and lo and behold all i had to do was z ! '', 
  can only speak for their personal success , but things that help one person might make matters worse for another . 
  the only way to know unfortunately is try them out yourself and see what happens . 
  here 's some basic advice that i think everyone could follow though :, 
  - if you are trying a new `` regimen '' or skin care system , do n't immediately call it quits after day 1 , 2 , 3 or 4 if your skin appears worse ( unless of course it is a serious allergic reaction ) . 
  sometimes things really do work by getting worse before they get better . 
  - a good diet will work wonders for you , even if it is n't the cause of your acne . 
  - keep careful track of what products or medicine have what effect on you over the months or years or however long it takes you to overcome it , but know that eventually one of the systems will work , or you will grow out of it . 
  nothing lasts forever , not even the scarring . 
  good luck !, 
  go on . . 
   other orifices of interest, 
  go on . . 
  i could reach the coast going east , north and west . 
  taco taco !, 
  over here !, 
  the one week i leave the city : c, 
  i 'm with you on this one , it seems like strictly by definition if i find something attractive it would mean i 'm attracted to it . 
  there was a nudity ban ? 
  last i heard you could legally be completely naked in sf as long as it was nonsexual . 
  did some googling and found [ this ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/huff-wires/20130129/us-nudity-ban/?utm_hp_ref=homepage&amp;ir=homepage ) . 
  apparently a few months back a judge ruled that sf * could * ban nudity if they pleased but from what i understand they have n't done it yet . 
  then again they could have and i just did n't hear about it , but if this really was in dolores park then i 'm sure the legality would n't prevent them from expressing themselves there . 
  you have to appreciate the artistic effort . 
  the first 5 minutes is more of an appeal to other sociopaths who get off on watching someone cleverly lie to unsuspecting victims . 
  i enjoyed it . 
  i do n't think he was trying to be rude , i agree with him . 
  and as a tip if you are that disgusted by the last link i would n't begin posts with `` as a 14 year old girl , '' . 
  just trying to save you from creepy pm 's . 
  did you have a spotter that actually managed to catch the whole weight in that fraction of a second ? 
  ticket price * attendees + merchandise, 
  where is everyone watching all these fucking videos ? 
  yeah seriously i was so worried they were just going to say , '' too slow ! '', 
  seems reasonable . 
  then how do you know you 're attractive ? 
  hm , it must be a nice feeling to have complete strangers objectively label you as attractive . 
  i bet that would bring a huge confidence boost . 
  how , * advantageous * , if you will . 
  so then do you think maybe you 're ugly and people online were lying to spare your feelings ? 
  people working at the convention cener, 
  also i believe the name guardian hales from the halo 2 invisible entity that would kill you when you did something game-breaky, 
  who are you ? 
   ** peterman82 **, 
   what if op is a girl, 
  depends on the fish, 
  although my original comment was made in jest , i 'm sure there are some very intelligent creatures under the sea other than mammals , especially when compared to turtles which themselves are n't exceptionally smart . 
  for instance , and i know this may be a bit of a unique case , but cephalopods ( a type of sea creature without a neck that includes the cuttlefish ) have been named * honorary vertebrates * by the european union in order to protect them with the same rights we allow mammals such as dolphins and whales , since these creatures ( especially types of squid ) appear to have intelligence far beyond what we thought possible for most animals . 
  i literally read the first option and clicked the link , saw naked females in the shower , went back to check what the other option was , and then saw it . 
  damn that is one nice rack , where 'd you get it ? 
  i like your comment !, 
  people want a more reliable source than stratostar.net, 
  edit : also if you read the article it states that life was found in earth 's upper atmosphere , not other planets . 
  i love big pitchers , i have a brita filter myself . 
  pretty sure that 's the longterm plan . 
  -1500 karma in 8 days , i 've seen better . 
  wow i never thought of that , what 's getting filtered out then ? 
  i feel like cleaning vodka with charcoal is going to be chemically a little uneasy ( source : i know nothing about chemistry ) , will i still be able to purify water with it later without it tasting like vodka ? 
  sorry i meant * long long * term . 
  like probably after empires have risen / fallen a few more times if the human race is still alive , when i 'm sure the human race 's best bet for space expansion wo n't be nasa or anything government-funded . 
  haha , i think we may have the same nemesis, 
  i supposedly pronounce `` water '' as `` wooder '' . 
  this was pointed out repeatedly by all of my friends in high school and i always thought they were fucking with me because when i would repeat it back to them i said it normally , but they insisted i was changing it . 
  since then every time i say water to a new person it 's the same response , `` did you just say wooder ? '' . 
  i guess i only say it when i 'm not even thinking about it and i 've tried to catch myself saying it nonchalantly while being recorded but to no avail . 
  i know exactly how you feel , so many times i 've been chilling with my buddies at a local speakeasy when the subject of online gaming comes up . 
  they think that just because i 'm a white guy that means i ca n't really have a level 90 frost mage . 
  ** edit : ** woah what 's up with the downvotes ? 
  wow i love that song but had no idea that was who he was talking about , i 'm still not sure . 
  you know what 's worse ? 
  i 'm still not sure even * now * . 
  what if he 's right though ? 
  no harv and for the last time i ai n't your ma !, 
  link ? 
   how you wrote your height in your flair, 
  whenever i 'm at a party or something and someone comes up and asks how tall i am i say , `` 5 foot 18 '' . 
  they 're usually inebriated and it 's fun to watch their face instantly become serious and confused as they sit and try and convert it for 20 seconds haha, 
  hey you 're from sf too ? 
  maybe we 'll cross paths one day , i 'll be the guy you see across the crowd at eye level . 
  came here to say this . 
  one life to live and but one upvote to give , my good sir . 
  thankyou kind sir , all of my upboas !, 
  edit : accidentally a letter , ** but im keeping it xd **, 
  read up on fraud as a legal offense , it 's more complicated than simply lying or even selling things that are untrue . 
  i actually just wrote my essay a few hours ago . 
  he 's doing well from what i hear . 
  cpt falcon was was one of my 2 favorite ( w / star fox ) in melee . 
  i really liked ganondorf and played him a bit but he just moved too god damn slow for me and i was impatient . 
  what language ? 
  what fucking high school do you go to ?
