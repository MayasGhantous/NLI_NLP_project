  in my experience the issue has been the exact opposite . 
  kids pretending to be experts on subjects relevant in the news when they do n't know shit, 
  could n't have said it better myself . 
  what breed of dog is generally eaten ? 
  hopefully not sounding too ignorant , i have no clue . 
  is it specifically bred just for eating and are pet dogs also popular where you live ? 
  just do what we do in america then , do n't pay attention to politics . 
  it 's not anymore ? 
  i 'm also 6 ' 8 '' and fear pursuing any kind of relationship with women who are n't tall for this very reason . 
  theres a subreddit for / r/gainit ? 
  hang out with different people, 
  for women , and to a degree . 
  you sound like a great babysitter . 
  my mom called my doctor and said to him `` what 's the most accurate measurement for weighing ? '', 
  the doctor said `` an underwater weighing test '', 
  and just like that , my mom said `` yes . 
  when can my son and my daughter can take it ? '', 
  and the doc, 
  said `` today at 2pm . '', 
  so , i did n't bother taking a shower and so did my sister too , so i had to get into a special swimming, 
  suit ( tight pants ... ugh ) . 
  my sister said `` can i pull my hair down to a ponytail ? '', 
  the doctor said `` no . '', 
  so my sister with her long blonde hair went underwater with 8 seconds and had she must enjoyed it . . but i did n't . 
  his dad ? 
  no , this is ben . 
  op are you still here ? 
  post pic !, 
  yeah i know what you mean , i just found that there were 1 or 2 people in particular for me at least that would always say stuff like that even when i said it was n't funny or clever , and have since enjoyed their absence from my company . 
  on another note , if you have n't already , join / r/tall and find likeheighted folks who bitch about relevant shit like shower heads . 
  well that 's comforting to know not all women are afraid of dating someone much taller , i 'm just nervous kissing in public/hugging and all that would require me to bend over awkwardly , you did n't have any issues with that ? 
  dead men tell no tales . 
  if trayvon had survived i 'm sure this case would have gone very differently . 
  i always thought manslaughter was just `` accidental murder '' . 
  is there a charge for that ? 
  or is it binary murder or not murder ? 
  for instance if i was driving through a blizzard in the dark one night and out of nowhere someone leaped in front of my car and i ran them over - killing them , i thought that would be manslaughter . 
  then again this definition is probably something i just assumed since i was a kid , have n't really needed to know the difference since then . 
  well i would cry too if that was the first sound i heard holy shit what were they thinking . 
  what an annoying god damn sound to be the first ever . 
  at least you do n't remember any of that , right ? 
  well you do n't want to feel that weird swabby texture in your cheek do you ? 
  damn this guy is pretty racist . 
  i 'm not sure how comments claiming otherwise are getting so far upvoted , and even gold . 
  hive mentality i suppose . 
  but you would be hard pressed to convince me that he had to refer to black people as , `` buck dancing shoe-shining ** monkeys ** '' in order to get his point across . 
  and since it 's relevant , i 'm white . 
  we ca n't afford him . 
  american , i presume ? 
  ironically if you had the money for the dlc you would n't even need to get it anymore . 
  he literally answers every question i have if he works hard enough to find the answer . 
   ** acetaminoflope ^ ^ tm : **, 
   ... use ( s ) :, 
   ... . ( 1 ) : this medication provides temporary neurological buffers to prevent the user from sustaining damage to serotonin and/or dopamine receptors and their respected synapses that would otherwise cause addiction . 
  i would just take that every day and then i could do real drugs . 
  good guy fellow athlete : knows his peer is fucked for testing positive , puts hints that maybe * he * was the reason . 
  look closely . 
  there 's no picture . . 
  just under korean i imagine . 
  fuck what episode is this from again ? 
  tip of my tongue, 
  this is a dumb question , but what does pw stand for ? 
  also did she find the job through a mutual friend or online or something ? 
  and if you do n't mind me asking , how is the wage ? 
  12 in the morning took me a second to understand , i do n't think i 've ever heard it called that . 
  why not just , midnight ? 
  or at least 12am, 
  well you definitely need * some * , it is n't free . 
  and it would help a whole bunch obviously if you had at least an average amount . 
  and would definitely put you at an advantage from most if you had even more . 
  so i guess i disagree . 
  are you sure ? 
  i thought that was the ectoplasm one which i thought was a different episode . 
  thanks !, 
  you need money to do well in high school , and literally there is a fee to send applications to schools . 
  i remember i recently went through all of this financial nonsense . 
   being original , being consistent, 
  wow i vaguely remember this , do you know what the name of this specific game was or where a link to that scene is ? 
  is that possible in humans ? 
  gravity and marmalade . 
  thanks !, 
  wish i could find the full episode somewhere, 
  she seemed like she was having fun with it , get over yourself r/cringe . 
  now if a girl is just really comfortable in front of the camera and not worried about being judged for being zany it 's cringeworthy ? 
  please . 
  i do have to admit her grammar was a little annoying to me , but that 's just a minor complaint that i have with many people . 
  i do n't think they would go to a dangerous penitentiary at 14 years old . 
  what 's earthlings about , and what is your favorite of the 3 documentaries ? 
  because a large majority of industrialized modern populations eat pigs . 
  we 're conditioned not to `` feel '' for the animals we think are tasty . 
  even though i spent a lot of time at my grandfather 's ranch growing up and thought cows were cute : c, 
  edit : also bacon tastes too fucking good i 'm sorry . 
  to the point where if dogs or cats made bacon i would n't be opposed to having them prepared for me either , i 'm sorry it 's the one food where i feel like that , idk what it is about it . 
  thanks !, 
  what am i bragging about ? 
  it was more of a sad confession , not really a `` neener neener neeeeeener , i like bacon ! '', 
   few people enjoy food more than i do, 
  source ? 
  i see two trees . 
  especially when you introduce two of your friends to eachother that have n't previously met and begin playing , nothing bonds new people like fucking over their mutual friend !,
