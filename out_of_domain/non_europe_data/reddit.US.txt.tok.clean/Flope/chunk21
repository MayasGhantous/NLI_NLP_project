  ^ ^ motherfuckers, 
  `` hahaha you were being serious ? 
  i 'm not doing that , just skip me this round . 
  bitch where is the game supposed to progress if you already on the first turn refuse to cover your nipples in peanut butter and let duncan lick it off !, 
  is this a good movie ? 
  and that 's usually how truth or dare ends . 
  can i be your buddy 's buddy too ? 
  not the kids ? 
  this is the best attitude i think i 've ever seen in my entire life . 
  maybe you 're just broken ? 
  my birthday today as well !, 
  july 17th 4 lyfe !, 
  happy bday !, 
  seriously i 'm 6 ' 7 '' theres no fuckin way i 'd be able to do this . 
  that works too !, 
  hey that book looks like just what i 've been looking for , thanks !, 
  ca n't believe that did n't come up when i was googling around . 
  the reason i 'm a little discouraged on heavy console tutorials is because i bought * c++ primer * which was recommended to me , read the first few chapter in full when i just started skimming through the rest of the book looking at the example programs and i already knew how every one of them worked all the way up to the end of the book . 
  i know there 's no way i can do 0.1 % of what 's possible with c++ i just need resources that go deeper than what i found in that book . 
  thanks again for the link !, 
  what about as far as distribution goes ? 
  if i devote say a year of my life to making a game in c++ using sfml or sdl am i wasting my time ? 
  does including libraries like that also come with a bunch of junk that i probably wo n't use that slows down/makes the game a larger size than it needs to be ? 
  and on that note , are there any video games that are/were making money being sold publicly that used premade libraries like this ? 
  for some reason i have the notion in my head that every game i 've ever played must have been written from scratch , but then it 's like , how basic do you go ? 
  like obviously starcraft was n't written in binary or assembly , but did they write their own c++ libraries ? 
  thanks for the help !, 
   before you start any game development , i suggest you pick up a book on c++, 
  yeah as i posted above [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1ijf7j/what_are_some_good_resources_to_learn_c_for_game/cb52ah2 ) i bought * c++ primer * and skimmed through the examples only to be disappointed at the simplicity of all of the console apps he was showing . 
  perhaps i should reread certain parts and get a closer look . 
   also keep in mind that plenty of commercial games use sdl . 
  see this list : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_games_using_sdl, 
  thanks for this !, 
  as i said in that same post above i 'm very confused at the idea of importing someone else 's library in commercial games , as in how often it happens , if it 's still legal and * efficient * to do it , the idea seems really foreign to me . 
  i 'm glad to see some games are made with libraries like this , especially newer ones that are currently selling like * faster than light * !, 
  thanks !, 
  well . . 
  i mean . . would n't we be the ultimate eco terrorists ? 
  how can this be proven ? 
  i guess it completely slipped my mind that unreal used c++ , would you recommend using that to make games or have you had any experience with it ? 
  i actually have a lot of experience with unity but ultimately decided to stop using it due to lame built in features like the default start screen of applications and forcing people to download a unity plugin when playing on the web , is udk similar ? 
  thanks !, 
  i just feel like , what am i supposed to make in c++ if i 'm not making games or using any libraries ? 
  just console stuff , right ? 
  everything above console includes some type of 3rd party library , correct ? 
  so how many things can i really experiment with and learn when just working 1 line at a time ? 
  also :, 
   learn c++, 
  any specific books or resources you would recommend ? 
  thanks for your detailed reply !, 
  well everything i 've written in java and c # has some graphical aspect to it . 
  that being said , it seems like i ca n't do anything with graphics using c++ out of the box and i need to get a library to do it for me . 
  it just kind of feels like i 'll never really be able to learn c++ , but instead end up learning sfml , sdl , etc. 
  is this normal ? 
   i would recommend you try to learn c++ as a language before trying to apply it to games . 
  the language itself is difficult enough . 
  to that end , you need a good book , like c++ primer 5th ed, 
  thanks a lot for your reply , i will definitely be checking out those links !, 
  it just so happens that i already purchased c++ primer and have skimmed through the examples and rewrote them in a new ways to see how they worked and what not , and a few users have recommended i revisit the book more in depth and skim less so i 'll do that . 
  as far as `` learning c++ as a language '' i just get the feeling that i 'll never really get to do that since everything i end up making will require some kind of library . 
  like even displaying graphics in a window requires a library , correct ? 
  so i feel like instead of learning c++ i 'm going to end up learning qt , sfml , sdl etc. 
  is this a bad thing ? 
  thanks for your help !, 
  thanks for the link , i 'll check it out !, 
  i 'm not sure why you 're being downvoted , thanks for the help !, 
  i guess some users here disagree with c++ by savitch or lynda.com !, 
  ah okay , i was actually going to say as a counterpoint that monkeys and i thought a good amount of other animals had same-gender ( therefore nonproductive ) intercourse , but perhaps it was just bonobos . 
  that 's a good idea !, 
  thanks a bunch for all of your replies , i appreciate it !, 
  for what it 's worth your original use of sketch seemed a lot more in line with the way everyone i 've talked to use it than his definition , must be a regional thing ( california ) . 
  step 2 . 
  receive a * [ x ] maybe * check . 
  step 3 . 
  repeat step 1 . 
  thanks a bunch for the help , man !, 
  well what happened after he put your hand there ? 
  did you move it away immediately ? 
  did you just stand up and change the subject ? 
  both of those send off vibes of `` woah what are you thinking bro ? '', 
  whether it was intentional or not . 
  i know you 're kind of shy so just say :, 
   `` god this bed is so comfy but it would be better if there was a great big heap of * man * in here ! '', 
  ^ trust ^ me . 
  yeah but what are you going to do when he says, 
   `` hahaha '', 
  man i feel like the more i ask questions the more this larger event unfolds . 
  in case it was n't clear , me and my buddies do n't up and put our hands under eachother 's shirts and on our dicks . 
  that would indicate something more intimate than friendship , to put it bluntly , which i think you can appreciate . 
  now , i 'm not going to say that this is a 100 % sign that he wants to date and be a couple , but i 'd say it 's a 98 % sign that he was horny at the time and wouldv ' e been down to get it in if you made it obvious you were too . 
  not necessarily sure/saying that 's what you want , but those are my percentage estimates of the limited knowledge of the situation . 
  at the least i 'd say that means he does n't think you 're ugly , good job !, 
   * yawn * `` hey knittedowl i 'm actually getting kind of uncomfortable here on the floor i think i 'm gon na hop in bed now . 
   you get on the floor . 
  ^ ( i 'm having way too much fun with this whole imaginary scenario ), 
  11 this fall . 
  haha i just thought it 'd be funny since you were afraid of awkward moments if it seemed like he was about to crawl into bed with you only to ask you to swap spots and sit on the ground while he stays on the bed . 
  this is the kind of dumb thing that makes me chuckle at 5am . 
  i 'm going to sleep , good luck !, 
  i knew there was something i was n't getting , thanks !,
