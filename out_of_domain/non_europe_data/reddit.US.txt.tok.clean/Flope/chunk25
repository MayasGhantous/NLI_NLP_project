  this is sad . 
  how much did that case cost ? 
  everyone in this comment thread should read city of thieves !, 
  what ? 
  i do n't understand are you trying to troll me ? 
  did you even read my post ?? 
   i love conspiracy theories , but you guys have got to be kidding me . 
  what conspiracy theory ? 
   how much money do you think families would be willing to pay for a cure for grandma 's cancer ? 
  how about your newlywed husband ? 
  your child ? 
  who says the cure would be free ? 
  chemo is far from it . 
  so you agree with me ? 
  i have a hard time believing all of these posts . 
  i 've never seen someone go and call someone fat to their face at a gym , ever . 
  i 've been trying to find some people to play with as well . 
  i 'm not a veteran and i do n't have the latest dlc , but i might get it soon . 
  add flope on steam if you ever wonna find a match together or something . 
  itt : comics are taken seriously and people ca n't take a joke . 
  well to be fair that part was quoted from an above poster , i really only included it because i think the outlying sentences before/after it have an important sentiment , being that the industry is driven by monetary gain ( obviously ) , and that a corporation has a responsibility to its constituents to make as much profit as possible , regardless of the cost . 
  we already have public records of private parties and governments alike running for the patent on a cure for aids / hiv , so what makes cancer different ? 
  i suppose so , i think it might just be the context of this subreddit that is giving it a bad rap . 
  the comic was made in 2012 and do n't think it was intended to `` tease people into stopping pron usage '' . 
  hey gentlemen i 'm a computer science student at sfsu looking for a job in the games industry . 
  hire me . 
  ^ ^ please, 
  great !, 
  just give me a few moments to pack my thing !, 
  pro tip : do n't assault someone . 
  oh my god if we ever met we could have * things * !, 
  welp . 
  that happened . 
   all i hear is a child wailing unable to understand why he ca n't have the cake and eat it too . 
  good start , i can see this will be an enlightening discussion . 
   they are in a business for fuck 's sake, 
  that 's what i 'm saying , so . . we agree ? 
   so , as much as i 'd hate to be charged what i , along with many , would perceive to be an outrageous amount , i 'd very much prefer to have that than nothing at all . 
  where did i make this ultimatum ? 
  honestly i 'm beginning to think i 'm just being trolled by a bunch of kids who did n't even read my post or dirtydirtdirt 's in the first place . 
  when i first looked at his post above it had an up/down ratio of nearly 1:4 , i 'm glad to see that it 's since evened out more after people got over the initial thrill of having vaguely similar ideas about the pharmaceutical industry . 
  i guess it is just hard to have civillized discussions in a place where everyone is able to see the `` popular '' opinion before even reading the post . 
  wow , what a weird concept . 
  the whole idea of a party is to go out and meet new people haha, 
  this is my party trick . 
  i 'm a real spectacle . 
  . . that 's what i just said ? 
  i thought all of your posts were great , bigboss !, 
  and i agree with their sentiment , even if lb specifically was n't looking for advice . 
  i think that it 's great that you are being that forward , just make sure that when you are n't interested you try not to hurt their feelings . 
  i can just imagine some poor bloke coming up to you and starting a conversation only to be met with , `` not interested , no thanks ! '' . 
  i 'd be peeved , though i 'm sure you handle it much better than that . 
  this is the best explanation i 've heard so far and it 's so incredibly obvious i ca n't believe i had n't thought of it before . 
  `` fuck you ! '', 
  i do n't think he was saying your story is fake , i think he was saying your boyfriends story was fake . 
  `` hm , well was she giving any subtle hints while your penis was in her mouth ? 
  i 'd say just be open and upfront and ask if there was anything sexual about it or if she just wants to stay friends . '', 
   men realise they could never be `` just friends '' with an ** attractive ** female coed, 
  unattractive women can be buddies . 
  you should write for cosmo !, 
  * how to know if your man is leaving you !, 
  does he glance more than once at another female !, 
  more on pg . 
  6 ' 7 '' here . 
  i have to admit if a girl wanted to date me and she was taller , i 'd be a little suspicious . 
  i agree , you should pretend to be someone who you are n't , op !, 
   working out an average amount and eating an average amount of food and still being slightly overweight, 
  is it not obvious to you that if you want to * lose * weight you need to be working out * more * than average and eating * less * food than average ? 
  unless you have some contributing disease/illness , metabolism only accounts for about a 3-5 % difference from expected body weight . 
   underdeveloped self-esteem . 
  it usually shows, 
  i think you 're my favorite person from now until i fall asleep and forget everything i saw on reddit for the last 4 hours . 
  actually i 'd be down to try it if you 're in the san francisco area, 
  iron , check !, 
  i am , or you do n't have an accurate measurement of their caloric intake / expenditure, 
  cancer . 
  we have a different definition for a bubbler in california, 
  i do n't get how this would work , like if you 're just walking around town with her and you notice a bench or steps or appropriately high item do you/your gf go out of the way to use it as a hug/kiss initiator ? 
  do you ever hug/kiss without the use of that kind of thing ? 
  i feel like i 'm nervous about getting an average-short height gf because i 'd always have to awkwardly double over to hug/kiss , is this the case in your experience ? 
  nailed it . 
  no one should have to watch xhamster . . 
  there 's a scene that you can only film ** once ** . 
  it 's a reference to [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkgf5pabzyg ) video . 
   i think i 'm fucking retarded now , but i dunno . 
  that might just because i 'm drunk right now , and because i 've had at least 8 standards units of alcohol per day since then . 
  i really look at my school work and shit that i had done before i smoked a fucking shitload of weed and it seemed like i was way smarter back then . 
  i just looked at this math assignment that consisted of logical proofs that basically confirmed that i used to be really smart ( even the teach thought so ) , and now i look at it and it 's just fucking gibberish . 
  i ca n't believe i used to be able to do that, 
  i had the same experience haha , quit about 1 year ago . 
  when i look at some of the shit i was able to write for school 2-4 years ago it blows my mind . 
  haha thats pretty nifty !, 
  well he just picked up a dog in one , is n't that an errand ? 
  drink plenty of water !, 
  history is written by the winners , so hitler is 100 % evil .

  thanks !, 
  how big is your dad ?
