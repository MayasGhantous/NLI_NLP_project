  ouch, 
  pretty sure everyone does , my point exactly . 
   comics are taken seriously, 
  op thread, 
   ** and ** people ca n't take a joke, 
  this comment thread, 
   i would n't say at all that it can be entirely objective, 
  that 's what i was implying . 
   thanks for making it clearer, 
  to you , but not to everyone . 
  it 's not a plea that i 'm coppin ', 
   i 've had a few male friends be like , '' hey , i 'm horny , wan na have sex ? '', 
   jesus christ , you 've had `` friends '' say that to you ?? 
  i hope they are no longer your friends, 
  what am i missing ? 
  she has more than a couple guys openly admit they want to have sex with her , and that 's not a confidence boost ? 
  for those of us who are n't fabio , i think he means it 's specific to the person but there 's only one way to find out, 
   [ get ] a pack of cowboy killers . 
  smoke the entire pack, 
  do n't actually do this op , unless you are already addicted or have smoked in the past without getting hooked . 
  the union is a great documentary !, 
  i really enjoyed it , though i do n't smoke, 
  and i 've never seen a case of cancer caused only by ~ ~ standing next to the microwave ~ ~ being hit by an atomic bomb or talking on a cell phone , but does that mean that either of those are not increasing your risk of getting cancer ? 
  that 's like having sex before discovering masturbation . 
  i hope you find it !, 
  seriously why do n't they just let them roam around the zoo ? 
  so if everyone hated him , who were all of these military generals and strategists who aided him ? 
  all of the lead scientists who communicated with him and helped him with experiments ? 
  heads of concentration camps ? 
  most importantly his constituents who voted him into power in the first place ? 
  clearly he had support and did n't sneak his way into something he did n't deserve . 
  had he achieved victory in wwii , germany would be left very predominantly occupied by the aryan race , who would hail his great victory over the enemies who attempted to invade their democracy . 
  the genetic makeup of the average german citizen would be considerably healthier and more attractive than other countries due to mass amounts of sickly/crippled being killed . 
  germany would have expanded it 's territory * considerably * , making it a larger and more prosperous nation and one without threat of any militaristic enemies . 
  but because he lost , his forces were defeated , allied opinion of him became world opinion of him , and you would be surprised how many people do n't even know that he was elected in the first place ( non germans that is ) . 
  the ideology in my experience has been that he is an evil man who tricked his way into committing genocide for the fuck of it . 
  just . . one . . more . . 
   `` i kinda wan na be with this other chick , but i 'm settling for you cause i thought you 'd be easier '', 
  i ca n't believe anyone would actually say this i guess . 
  it seems like one of these posts where people say someone walked up and called them fat when they were at the gym and made fun of them , i feel like the situation is exaggerated a bit . 
  then again maybe i just have n't come across anyone so dense . 
  yes , / r/everything, 
  that 's how i feel as well !, 
  i recently got the game in the steam summer sale and am just now playing my first match where i 've found him , * i 'm keeping my eye on you , ghandi !, 
  if you ever wonna try multiplayer add flope on steam . 
   and regardless of what he could have won , he did n't . 
  and here there are no points for trying . 
  especially considering the consequences of failure . 
  thank you !, 
  so history always favors the winners . 
  i knew we would agree haha , 
   i would stop girls, 
  guys want compliments too !, 
  fixed, 
  i 'd say mid 2000s, 
  should i watch this show ? 
  i know it 's over and that it ended anticlimactically , but is it worth watching ? 
   breaking bad is really a category in itself . 
  finished watching the fourth season a few days ago . 
  you have to watch the first half of season 5 before the last 6 episodes begin to air in like 2 weeks !, 
  do you think that in the end google depends on the nsa , and knows it ? 
  we 've seen google publicly ask to be `` allowed '' to reveal more specific government data requests after the nsa scandal came to light , similar to how i might * ask * the government to make pizzas cheaper if i opened my own pizzaria , in both instances we are asking something that we really know wo n't actually happen but that will appease our customers/users . 
  i 'm not sure how high up the chain of command you are , but i 'd be absolutely shocked if there were n't hands being shaken between the nsa and a corporate giant data-mining company like google . 
  my other question to you then , would be , * which public company do you think is the biggest culprit of working together with the nsa ? 
  * i obviously do n't expect you to say g since you work there , but what are your opinions of facebook , microsoft , etc. 
  in this regard ? 
  thanks for doing this ama and congrats on your award !, 
  ** bonus easy question : ** i 've actually applied to intern at google and will be again next summer . 
  what do employees at google think of the movie the internship ? 
   as to the movie , i did n't see it but has taken a large amount of abuse internally on company email lists . 
  i do n't think the average google employee was impressed by it and i think it 's very far away from the reality of working at google . 
  that 's exactly the vibe i got from the commercials haha . 
  well thanks for answering my questions and congratulations again on the award , whether it was given by the nsa or not . 
  also i 'd be careful about doing ama 's when working at google due to their intense nda , though i 'm sure you know more about this than i do . 
  best of luck moving forward and keep making good things !, 
  oh and one last thing , i 'm attending sfsu as a comp sci major and am wondering if there is anything in particular you know of that i could do to increase my chances of being taken on as an intern ? 
  now i want to watch that movie again, 
  damn that 's actually really impressive . 
  i 've met someone who believes it . 
  or , perhaps they do n't `` believe '' it since they know better , but they 're mentality is , `` hey what do i lose by just not keeping it on while i sleep ? 
  better safe than sorry ! '', 
  why dont you nerds add eachother and flope on steam and we can play sometime . 
  that ones more sad though : c, 
  and i did watch it after writing that , pretty good . 
  that sounds terrifying or hilarious, 
  google sf . 
  personally i would n't seek a girlfriend that posts ads for sex on craigslist . 
  well whose fault is that ? 
  lowest i 've seen is about $ 27 for a fifth . 
  san francisco, 
  edit : i like the username too, 
  the geraffe you idiot, 
   ca n't believe it was n't the first three dozen comments . 
  seriously how tragic , thank god you were there to post it !, 
  what would reddit be if i did n't see the same 7 posts in every thread on the front page ? 
  * step 1 : have vagina , do n't be hideous, 
  damn you had to search pretty far back for that haha , alright fair enough . 
  i guess i should be flattered that i have n't said anything gayer in the last ~ 4 months, 
  dat inflation . 
  and here i was thinking i 'd resub on my account and subscriptions were still only 10 mill,
