  ** ah , the ol' reddit switchamagofuckyourself !, 
  edit : nvm did n't realize how old you were, 
  i found it helpful , 
  / r/tall beckons you, 
  6 ' 6 '' here . 
  do you play minigolf lel ? 
  6 ' 6 '' here . 
  i definitely would n't mind if some girl came up to me and said , `` wow , you 're so tall !, 
  * smiles * '' . 
  except most of the time it 's more like , `` oh shit you 're tall , why are you so tall ? 
  * looks scared * '', 
  i 've never had a good reaction to that , but i say it every time i go in for a cut somewhere . 
  usually along the lines of , `` i do n't really care , it 's other people that need to look at it not me , just imagine you 're walking down the street with me and do n't give me something that would make you embarrassed to be seen with me . '', 
  this is followed by a million questions and uncertainties until they basically trick me into just telling them wtf to do , which i ca n't really blame them because i 'm sure some asshole has said the same thing and then flipped out if he did n't like the result . 
  our economies are so intertwined that if one of us vanished tomorrow the other one would be just as fucked . 
  though at this state of globalization it 's likely the disappearance of prc or the us would affect every industrial nation to an extremely significant degree . 
  man what a whirlwind . 
  first posted the comment and had +10 , then checked the first reply and it was like -9 , checked a bit later and was almost even and now i 'm at -5 again . 
  it 's almost like my comment experienced each part of the world waking up and how they 're culture/how they were brought up affects my karma . 
  edit : and yes i would never date someone who slept around with internet strangers unless i was in love with her . 
  / r/cringe would go crazy over that video, 
  in this moment , i am euphoric . 
  ^ ( and no , you would be retarded . 
  nothing against e , just saying if you were rolling balls at work at starbucks or some shit people would literally think you were retarded ), 
  same reason i assume . 
  i was told this as well when doing my driving course just a few years ago . 
  either 9/3 or 8/4 . 
  i still just drive with one 12 and one out the window , but i 'll probably die that way . 
  different strokes . 
   that dancing troll village got decimated in the cataclysm, 
  holy shit after reading his post missing it and then this i actually feel kind of sad . 
   ** personally i ** would n't seek a girlfriend that posts ads for sex, 
  * i * never did that , which is why * i * was saying that * i * would be uncomfortable doing that . 
  excuse my opinion . 
  and there are other ways to find out if someone is advertising sex online than to be one of the solicitors . 
  connecticut here , can confirm . 
  seems the taste in men runs genetically . 
  do you ever think when you 're fucking a guy , `` you know , my mom would also probably like to fuck this guy '', 
  how do you make your text bigger ? 
  ** oh i had no idea **, 
  ^ ^ ^ like ^ ^ ^ ^ this, 
   adaptionism is pseudo science at best, 
  if you 're going to refute it , you should probably learn the word, 
  i think it 's a sexual outsider joke pertaining to gonewild, 
  source ? 
  that sounds interesting, 
  this subreddit is so awkward . 
  you can tell that half of the people on it are joking like , `` haha my dicks so big it hits the toilet rim '' and then the other half are like , `` yeah i know , it sucks '' . 
  neither half knows the other exists . 
  psychologists do not provide therapy , [ they evaluate , diagnose , and treat a patient ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/psychologist ) , its a therapist who provides therapy . 
  ** edit : ** my humor is bad and i should feel bad , and go to sleep, 
  it becomes a lot more difficult to prove beyond reasonable doubt that someone was trying to kill someone else when they are still alive . 
  lol, 
  it 's no longer available on netflix !, 
   out of his element, 
  * bum bum tsh !, 
  in what way ? 
  just so you know , cystic acne is almost always a result of testosterone levels . 
  try googling around for the link between acne and testosterone transitioning into -  dht . 
  you may just have regular pimples and not cystic acne , but you should know which kind you have if you do n't already since they are treated completely differently . 
   godwin 's law is just that all arguments end up with a comparison with hitler . 
  it does n't say that it necessarily invalidates the argument of the side that brings it up . 
  who said it did ? 
  there was another story on reddit a bit back about someone who got sight for the first time and ended up becoming depressed and committing suicide not much later . 
  i remember one of the chief complaints being that everything looked so disgusting , that he could n't stand watching people eat because they were just shoving more and more stuff into an abyss of nothingness . 
  source ? 
  sounds interesting and i do n't know shit about genies other than aladdin / fairly odd parents . 
  stop it, 
  cant find it, 
   honestly , it 's difficult to like a 5 year old and 3 year old brother, 
  hey guys !, 
  thanks !, 
  probably bread with a hole cut out of the middle and replaced with a fried egg . 
  it 's fucking delicious and my grammy calls them elephant ears . 
  you have n't met my wife, 
  give me a break, 
   better math grades, 
  i had the complete opposite effect , i found at my peak usage i was doing my worst in school , math particularly . 
  congratulations on 3.5 years , that 's great !, 
  and here i like to pat myself on the back for quitting cigarettes haha . 
  curious ,, 
   lsd , mdma..2-cb and [ shrooms ], 
  which one , assuming no dependency/physical issues , do you think was the most enriching experience ? 
  haha i actually thought about that after i posted it . 
  shit now i want to eat a kit-kat . 
  really , that 's the ** wrongest ** description ? 
  it sounds exactly the fucking same except placed differently , same ingredients . 
  if you poured your milk in the bowl before the cereal i would n't say that is the ** wrongest ** description of how to make fuckin cereal , nerd . 
   fried eggs are n't even involved in the process, 
  how can you seriously say this ? 
  it 's the exact same god damn thing !, 
  are you trying to convince me that your eggy bread is just fried bread with a fresh uncooked egg slopped ontop ? 
  probably not . 
  is the egg not as liquidy , out of it 's shell and have a white/yellow consistency ? 
  that 's a * fried * egg . 
  i wonder why 2, 
  ^ ^ ^ fuck ^ ^ ^ ^ you . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ flope ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ is ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ nifty, 
  what other primates ? 
  i ca n't do this anymore .
