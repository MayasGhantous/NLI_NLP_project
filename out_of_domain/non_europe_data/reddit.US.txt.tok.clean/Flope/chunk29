  it 's us . 
  theres like 6 submissions . 
  is it a good movie ? 
  should i watch it ? 
  they actually zoomed in quite far and still had a crystal clear image , while simultaneously shitting on other people doing the same thing . 
  go back to bed, 
  how do you do it ? 
  i 'm about to be on the 405 so i 'll keep you posted, 
  west coast is best coast, 
  lol .

  shutup, 
  that must have been tough for you . 
  every damn thread, 
  what a happysadhappysad ending . 
  ** what 's going on in here ? 
  dtksh2r , you 're ugly !, 
  *** hehehehehe ***,

  ask her out , it does n't work out . 
  i just moved to sf about a year ago , and i 've never heard of there being a stereotype about people in the bay area being more intelligent than average . 
  in fact i have no idea how this could have even started unless maybe people confuse the tech industry of silicon valley with the rest of the surrounding area . 
  i think i 'm missing something, 
  how can you tell if someone on reddit is from the military ? 
  ** they 'll tell you !, 
  * bum bum tsh !, 
  i like how this is a global phenomenon and not subject to one country 's culture . 
  . . the coat industry ? 
  i actually do n't know . 
  i wonder what happened to this little guy . 
  ** shutup shutup shutup shutup !!, 
  this makes me sad . 
   still does n't stop a depressingly large number of people insisting on animals being things we can treat however badly we want to .

  $ 80 he never threw it . 
  if that 's true that that was fast thinking of him to eat it , do you know where i can find a source ? 
   my friend cried and i sat awkwardly eating my eggos until my mom came to get me . 
  i miss sleepovers sometimes . 
  what are the odds i 'm about to try this right now , what happened ? 
  now let me whisper sweet nothings into your ear , boo . 
  short answer : yes , because smoke of any kind is harmful to the lungs . 
  however introducing new methods of production / ingredients to make a capsulable substance may also diminish positive influence . 
   getting jobs is a no brainer . 
  sometimes you got ta accept less that what you would consider ideal . 
  unfortunately this does n't work for everyone , in fact i 'm sure it does n't work for a large amount of people in the us at the moment . 
  i can say from personal experience that though i would be willing to take `` shitty jobs '' what has been my experience so far is that they are not willing to take me . 
  this is because due to the economic downturn so many people have lost their jobs/careers that when i apply to be a fry cook/receptionist/maid / petco employee/pizza delivery/sandwich maker ( all of which i have ) i am directly competing with people twice my age with much more employment experience . 
  edit : though this could very well just be a regional problem , i 'm in northern california , and where you live you may well be spot on that people just do n't want to `` lower their standards '' to do that kind of work . 
  haha , i literally think you are the funniest redditor i 've ever met . 
  i think walt had n't made up his mind about whether or not to confront hank until after he arrived and spoke to him . 
  he was obviously considering it , since he brought the tracking device , but you can tell he when he was speaking to hank he was phishing around trying to decide if it would be better to just tell him now or play it softly depending on how hank was acting . 
  how could they possibly know ? 
  as someone else who loves bb and was underwhelmed with got ( i still watched all of it ) , what shows do you think compare to bb and are enjoyable ? 
  wow i really hate the `` c '' in specials . 
  just thought i should say that , maybe i have ocd . 
  how did you find this opportunity , out of curiosity ? 
  i 'm not usually lucky but i have high hopes that i can be an extra next season !, 
  thanks !, 
  i 've been meaning for a while to start the sopranos , but i always wonder if knowing the ending of the last episode will ruin the series for me . 
  i 've heard good things about the wire and will probably start that tonight !, 
  it was actually leaked that people in high positions of authority * against * the occupy movement ( think city chiefs of police / fbi ) had been major proponents of portraying their movement as `` lazy , disorganized and unable to succeed '' in order to dissuade further support . 
  they also had plans of assassination of it 's leaders if this did n't work . 
  [ one of many sources ] ( http://beforeitsnews.com/power-elite/2013/06/released-fbi-documents-reveal-plans-to-assassinate-occupy-wall-street-leaders-with-snipers-2442536.html ), 
  shutup, 
  yeah but i read the one for next episode and it 's actually specific as to what happens in a sense . 
  no that minor spoiler is exactly what i 'm talking about , it 's vague enough to not give anything away but specific enough that it seems like they 've actually got real information on what 's coming out , which is weird . 
  sounds like just a difference of opinion , not really any demerit on his personal character . 
  it 's not like he 's some extremist prophet , when he stated his idea that the chinese need to be controlled he was applauded by business leaders and other distinguished guests ( most chinese ) . 
  ** what !? 
  i just ate your buddy, 
  lots and lots of drinking , trust me . 
  i like how you quoted all of his answers * except * one . 
   the marriage benefits her because it 's what she wants since i 'd only do it to please my so . 
  he 's saying he himself does n't have the dream of being married , but would do it for the sake of his so . 
  that being said , he would like her to take his last name if marriage is something really important to her . 
  i also do n't see it as sexist , because it 's just his preference . 
  he is n't forcing anyone to do anything , just simply stating that if they get what they want ( marriage ) then he should be able to get something that is important to him as well . 
  have you tried wearing an eye patch ? 
  that 's enough for the traveller 's tundra mammoth !, 
  this is why i reddit . 
  i thought it was pretty good . 
  it 's almost like tv does n't show drugs the way they are . 
  see : the episode where devito takes lsd and sees a leprechaun in the toilet . 
  ah , * self entitled drug enthusiast * , i 've been looking everywhere for you !, 
  if you did n't know , people have different names/terms for drugs / drug use everywhere , mostly regionally influenced . 
  wait ... is this for real ?
