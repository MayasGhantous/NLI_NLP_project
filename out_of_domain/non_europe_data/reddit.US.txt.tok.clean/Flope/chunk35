  how much money do you get from those as opposed to the 6-8k from the random event ? 
  aw this kind of bums me out , i used to like my non-lethal shots in gta iv where if some pedestrian was an asshole you could shoot them in the knee and watch them hobble away without ending their virtual life . 
  i 'm nervous with those that i 'll end up exploding the whole vehicle , is this not a possibility ? 
  cool thanks !, 
  shit i got it from microsoft , also been out for delivery since 6am and is now 3pm . 
  i 'm worried we may have the same fate . 
  what horseshit, 
  did you get it yet ? 
  i 'm in the same boat , still no delivery, 
  did you get it yet ? 
  mine has been out for delivery in my city for over 10 hours now, 
  well shit it seems like everyone did fine by keeping everyone alive , i feel a bit cheated that i 'm literally missing a third of my playability for an extra 2-3 mill . 
  wtf !, 
  haha rockstar should really balance the rewards better , or make franklin die for deathwish . 
  so wait you restarted the whole game ? 
  or what, 
  i figured that obviously if anyone tried to take the easy way out and kill neither character then something worse would happen , or i figured r * would n't * actually * let me kill one of the main guys , like i would get there and something would happen and we would hug it out haha, 
  but i do recommend playing the mission where you kill trevor , sad stuff pretty well made, 
  this was actually something that happened to one of the more vocal members of the occupy movement . 
  they requested any info on them from the fbi and got back a letter saying nothing . 
  about a month later went to court to request again any info from the fbi and finds out that they did n't lie , but beginning immediately after the initial request they gathered a bunch of info about her : where she lives/works , relationships , car info , family member info etc, 
  so you 're 10 now !, 
  i see everyone always uses the airfield in sandy shores but is it possible to save a jet in the hangar down at the airport ? 
  i 've purchased the hangar but for some reason when i park my jet in it it does n't save or even give the dialogue about saving vehicles . 
  i beat the game that ca n't be it . 
  : / oh well i 'll figure it out, 
  haha you do n't get it you fucking dweeb , 420 is something only us marijuana inhalers understand , it 's a lifestyle , friend !, 
  edit : at a [ 7 ], 
  edit 2 : * [ 7-11 ], 
  i for some reason am unable to save my fighter jet in my hangar at the airport . 
  no matter where i try to park it or how many times i re-land and enter the hangar no dialogue shows up and it never saves . 
  same thing happened to me , you 'd think with the crazy budget of this game r * could have pretended to care a bit more about being ready server-side for the release . 
  i mean it 's almost a week later now and still having lots of issues the majority of the time . 
  no , but i do now . 
  saved,

  i mean it is 3 in the morning . . but did anyone else think this thumbnail was a camel at first ? 
  mmm tuna . 
  thanks , i just saw an opportunity and took it . 
  what do you mean ? 
  obviously he can or he would n't post the picture in the first place . 
  how do i go about attending one of these events ? 
  i 've been a fan of ted for a while now . 
  this is really great , though i ca n't help but feel if i were a mentally challenged person that some of the language used by the reporter would come off as offensive . 
  also the segue :, 
  `` though the real heavy lifting happened years earlier by his parents . . '', 
  pretty much discrediting his hard work and instead making it like his success was only the product of his parent 's diligence raising him . 
  i do n't know , maybe i 'm just being picky . 
  very admirable dude all the same !, 
  looks like one of your top posts is steering the conversation towards women in rape culture and away from men in the comments of an article about a 19 year old man who was raped by 4 women . 
  hypocrisy much ? 
  [ here is the post for those interested ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1bw9i5/19yr_old_man_raped_by_4_women_in_toronto/c9aq3gs?context=3 ), 
  christ i will never understand hollywood hairstyles , rj and aaron paul look like they 're trying to be cartoon characters , marie ( real name ? ), 
  as well . 
  well the legal system and most white collar job cultures are vastly skewed towards the benefit of women compared to most countries where the opposite is true . 
  not saying that 's a bad thing in general , but if you are looking for a downside to being a `` man in the united states '' , that 's about as close as it gets . 
  i liked it, 
  out of every story in this thread , this is the one you say is doubtful ? 
  holy shit i was about type `` this sounds a lot like lsd '' before i read the last sentence haha . 
  if you are being for real i have had this * exact * feeling of control over my current atmosphere when tripping before , i wonder how common it is . 
  you should probably do some research before telling people this , in numerous studies where subjects took lsd there was a common complaint of a `` strong metallic taste on the palate '', 
  ask your friends who have had good experiences with it where they got theirs from . 
  it 's right on the wikipedia page , as well as written in the reports of guess who , albert hofmann himself . 
  here is one instance where he mentions the metallic taste :, 
  i imagine this exact comment will be screenshotted , enlarged and hanging in the d.a.r.e. 
  corporate headquarters with a description reading : '' ** it worked ** '', 
   though i have had some `` traumatic '' experiences , those ended up being my favourite experiences . 
  they always taught me something about myself, 
  this is how i feel , though i feel like personally mushrooms is better ( worse ? ), 
  for this than lsd . 
  i should have listened . 
  just be very careful and make sure you follow along with a clear tutorial with pictures the first few times , it is possible that an invasive fungus or bacteria could grow in them which is poisonous or at the very least not what you want to be growing . 
  cold, 
  tell him to send it to 760\u00a0567\u00a04018 as well, 
  that sounds awesome , can i kill them ? 
  i do n't want to ruin anything personally but maybe . 
  in this example , the parallell is as follows :, 
  - a girl wants a guy who is tall , even though she is short . 
  - a guy wants a girl with less past partners , even though he has had many . 
  i 'm not the op or commenter above , but i think he makes a good point . 
  holy shit ama ?? 
  thanks i 'll try this !, 
  hm , that 's pretty astute . 
  how could that possibly fit in your nose without you inhaling and choking on it ? 
  have you given any blowjobs recently ? 
  there are people starving to death in america you middle to upper class fuck . 
  the us has a death by malnutrition rate higher than 52 other countries . 
   the leader of the ordeal got expelled , put on the sex offender 's list , and his football scholarship taken away . 
  / r/justiceporn right there, 
  more money and fatal blood clots !, 
  * tune in next time for more fun facts ^ tm *, 
  i agree with u , that is definitely a good possibility . 
   when i did come i did n't even know it happened, 
  `` no babe you totally came i swear ! '', 
  know of anywhere i could just stream it ? 
  edit : downvoted really ? 
  but not him ?
