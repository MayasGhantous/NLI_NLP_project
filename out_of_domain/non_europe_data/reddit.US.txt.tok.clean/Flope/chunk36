  are you some kind of elitist pirate ? 
  thanks !, 
  darn those giggling quarterbacks, 
  props to that random woman, 
  he was on his way to ask her out but when she suddenly sprayed herself in the face as a desperate attempt to excuse herself to the bathroom he knew she was n't interested so he went home and cried that his long time crush did n't feel the same way about him . 
  ^ ^ happy ^ ^ now ? 
  `` heh , totally got you guys . . ^ ^ ^ :( '', 
  i went to montessori preschool and they made me eat grass and put a shit ton of soap in my mouth to gargle with since i said a bad word . 
  my mother never believed me at the time but now when i bring it up decades later she feels so bad that she did n't do something , mostly sue the school so we could be rich . 
  seeing as geoff knows everyone has questions about him not being on the podcast and really wants him back on and still does n't talk about it , it would n't be unreasonable to assume that prior to the interview that was one of the things geoff requested to not be asked about . 
  hi feel nauseous i 'm flope !, 
  pft !, 
  just the type of thing a * shaper * would say !, 
  holy shit , that was actually really hard to read . 
  smart man . 
  never know when they could strike . 
  how to rape ? 
  why is that, 
  how could he possibly coordinate a class full of students with different schedules so that none of them had a test ?? 
  or are you talking about like high school, 
  me three !, 
  how do you figure, 
  yeah since op is fortunate enough to go to a school that does n't charge money per paper printed like mine does . 
  any idea how much it would cost to rent one of these for the day ? 
  is it comparable to renting like a jet ski for a few hours or is it super expensive ? 
   adventure time is not for children, 
  haha there goes your argument , you are no better than these 30 year old creeps who sit at home watching my little pony . 
  on the actual wikipedia page it says it 's target audience is children ages 9 - 14 . 
  like , it 's cool that you like that show even if you 're older , but its definitely not cool to make fun of people who enjoy another childrens show if that is the case . 
  you are trying to be like an elitist of weirdos, 
  how is there any advantage at all if everyone starts with the same weapon ? 
  hey !, 
  what are these little guys called ? 
  i always find a few in my ears the morning after sleeping on my back . 
  my newfoundland would always chase squirrels when i lived near a lake . 
  we would always let him and just watch and smile as this 200 pound behemoth of a dog tried to slowly run after a squirrel 7 times its speed . 
  then one day he actually caught one on a beach , it made the screaming noises and people all over the beach were horrified haha, 
  wow i think i like this one better than the original haha, 
  do n't tell me what to do . 
   dying is pretty rare once you get full dia enchanted, 
  do n't worry i think i might play next month so that should n't be an issue for you . 
  looks pretty solid but that 's just an e3 demo , the actual game i 'm sure will not look as good . 
  not to be a debbie downer or anything , but comparing actual consumer gameplay to an e3 demo is apples and oranges . 
  what movie is it, 
  holy shit !, 
  what are the odds i see my two roommates on reddit ? 
  my exact thought process as well . 
  edit : lol 13 downvotes, 
  oh shit so thats where my tank is ? 
  exactly , he was literally caught `` red handed '' with the blood print on the tank . 
  the cops show up and first thought is this is definitely heisenberg , and he was the one and only person who could make blue meth . 
  jesse will never resurface and anyone else that knew how to make it is now dead . 
  or a girl, 
  til, 
  does anyone know how to do the actual hunting minigame ? 
  good idea , did the first sentence , do n't think i should use it on the whole post though, 
  well i mean , it kind of is , is n't it ? 
  if i put you in a room with 2 doors and told you to choose , and you chose one and got murdered i would n't say it was your shitty choice that led to your demise, 
  seriously , like i would be okay with it if at least there was some kind of reward but all you get is half of trevor 's cut on each character . 
  they should unlock missions or at the very least would it have been so hard for them to just allow you to do trevor 's missions on one of your remaining characters ? 
  definitely way out of line and i 'm a bit disappointed they would even offer an option for such a terrible consequence without a reward . 
  i think deep down you actually can see the other side of the coin , but in the spirit of internet arguing . . 
  why should the player be held responsible for knowing that 2/3 options would be fucking awful ? 
  you do n't think there is some responsibility on the developer for making sure there are n't options that permanently cripple the game experience for the player ? 
  i thought it was a pretty arbitrary choice that would n't actually lead to the death of a main character , and even if it did would have to have some kind of incentive for making such a huge sacrifice , that does n't seem unreasonable . 
  that train is black , idiot, 
  is this gta v ? 
  the 5 second sequence where you are on your way to the airport , die , spawn at the hospital and steal the first vehicle . . 
  this is like 90 % of my time in gta v, 
  wow at least 8 people still think this is funny, 
  everyone commenting agrees with me but i have no upvotes and 4 downvotes , guess no one else will see this haha, 
  you 're not getting it : c, 
  i wish this was the case but sadly no , when i was killed with $ 10k in cash i only lost $ 100 . 
  hm , i was killed in free roam with $ 20k cash and lost $ 100 , multiple times . 
  so , what part is n't true ? 
  and where can i see these facts you have ? 
  add urstuck on xbox, 
  i hate this post . 
  it 's actually a really old picture , someone just photoshopped the gta online thing on it, 
  mine took about 48 hours to update , but i have an issue with it if anyone else knows anything ,, 
  for some reason there is a white box behind the emblem , almost like the entire canvas has a white background even though the actual emblem i made is circular , anyone know how to get rid of this ? 
  i 've just opened the editor and made sure that there is no actual box layer in the background , i 'll be really disappointed if this is unfixable,

  urstuck on xbl, 
  i do n't know why but this made me laugh, 
  well yeah i 'm pretty sure if i went up to an attractive girl and just said , `` hey you 're sexy , lets go back to my place and fuck '' i would get arrested or maced . 
  brb moving, 
  wait i do n't get it , so she said she loved you and then what happened after that the next day ?? 
  how do you like , undo that and not end up hooking up ? 
  * every * thread . 
   edit : jeezuz stop upvoting this it was n't that funny . 
  you 're right , but i just hate when people say `` what '' and appreciate the sentiment when people do what you just did . 
  sorry i did n't know you were on reddit . 
   female friend started rubbing her jeans , comments on how soft they are . 
  she tells me to feel how soft they are and i touch the [ thigh ] of her jeans and leave it at that . 
  holy fuck this totally happened to me and i blocked it out of my memory until this very moment . 
  i 'd be shocked if anyone else had my id in their wallet,
