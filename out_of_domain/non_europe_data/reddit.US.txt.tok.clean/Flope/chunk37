  where ? 
  wow has the white man not found this spot yet ? 
  it 's gorgeous !, 
  same . 
  level 30 . 
  rip : c, 
  yeah mine is showing level 26 when i was 30 , but i am still definitely down for that, 
  hey how do muggers work , never heard of them until this post but i saw there is an achievement for killing someone who mugs you . 
  is it like something you get from lester like an ability ? 
  from what you say it sounds kind of like you send them out like dogs in call of duty , how does it all work ? 
  thanks , and my avatar also died too young today at 30 . 
  rip, 
  that straw joke , dear lord, 
  sweet !, 
  how much money do you usually get from it ? 
  more than $ 1000 i hope ? 
  and how aggressive is the mugger , like what is stopping the target from just shooting the mugger in the face ? 
  damn , i do n't know if even i could find someone to adopt me within 7 days . 
  do n't mention it . 
  source ? 
  youre being creepy, 
  you could be gay , or a woman, 
  okay since no one seems to be asking the obvious question here ,, 
  how do you act towards someone who is extremely creepy and you wish would never talk to you ? 
  the same way ? 
  that 's a lot of mind reading to force on the dude, 
  i have to admit when i checked my inbox and saw such a lengthy reply i was a bit nervous since most longer replies i get on reddit are someone chewing me out haha . 
  thanks for taking the time to more clearly explain what you mean , that makes more sense . 
  first image : yeah , go usa !!, 
  second image : oh . . oh right . . india . 
  why not just live in a hospital ? 
  holy fuck i would ** never ** tell anyone i had that . 
  '' * hehe i do n't believe you let me see it !, 
  * '' *** flash ***, 
  now some broad has the most powerful device on the planet and i 'm none the wiser . 
  i think john mulaney said this, 
  well me and a buddy had just discovered that the helicopters with the hook attached to the bottom had spawned online , and we must have been relatively some of the first people to notice since our shenanigans earned us tons of frantic messages and people screaming over voice chat asking us how we got one of them . 
  anyways this one time i was just cruising around in that chopper looking for a motorcycle to pick up and put onto a skyscraper so i could jump off , when i see some guy below me on the freeway fly by at like 150 miles an hour , and then like 8 cop cars right behind him . 
  i realize now is my chance to help atone for the countless number of innocent players i had nonchalantly slaughtered . 
  i take a sharp left seeing that he is about to enter a roundabout and try to head him off . 
  i descend as fast as possible with what i think will be the best precision my little human brain can manage but miss his hood , and instead pick up a police van that was right behind him . 
  i turn around police van still in tow and see him entering a straightaway with two cop cars right on his tail . 
  just then the heavens opened up and my irish ancestors decided to bestow upon me all of the good luck that had been robbed of me for the last 20 years , and as i threw the police van forward from about 80 feet in the air , i knew i had hit my mark . 
  it slams into the road between the two pursuing officers and explodes , destroying all 3 police vehicles but miraculously the fleeing player was just out of range and was n't harmed . 
  he then slows down i assume because he saw the spike trip ahead , and i drop down and pick him up like peter pan picks up tinkerbell and fly off into the sunset . 
  i gently drop him off at a safe location where no police could possibly reach him , and i fly away because deep down i know , someone else needs me . . 
  i like to think he 's still sitting in his car on top of that skyscraper , wondering why the fuck some random chopper pilot decided to plop him there when he was having fun evading the police . 
  level 50 and yes that is the only way to lose more than $ 100 cash to another player . 
  incorrect , the only way to lose more than $ 100 cash to another player is being mugged , which is a level 50 ability . 
  hm , anyone else a little put off on how these all seem to targeting males and none of them offer advice specifically to women ? 
  damn , not really cringe more like a friendship-ending burn, 
  i dont get it, 
  lapologist here and this is correct . 
  should probably put that in spoiler tags, 
  edit : 10 downvotes for trying not to ruin the ending of the series for someone else , fuck me right ? 
  it surprisingly is a pretty common occurrence on reddit where someone does n't know the answer to this . 
  1 sack , 2 balls, 
  because it still gets upvoted , thats the only way you ever see it . 
  no matter how hard you try and tilt the camera there is no hiding that you need to work on your 3d, 
  is it dead ? 
  i would, 
  wait is it down due to government shutdown ? 
  if so that 's fucked, 
  ** shhhh shutup shutup shutup you 're discouraging them **, 
  i 'm sorry but now that i know you have ptsd your username really cracks me up . 
  this looks like a slide straight out of one of my power point presentations from middle school, 
  that 's why no one asked you , white cis scum . 
  latter , but i 'm naturally unfunny, 
  what about the people who made hundreds of millions from buying piswaser stock together on / r/gtamarket ? 
  but they did cause it to rise , right ? 
  she suffers from low blood pressure , it 's a serious issue and her family ca n't afford the proper medications . 
  i know some of these letters . 
  i love jager . 
  anyone who complains about the taste of it clearly has n't had any other hard liquor before . 
  it tastes like a mix of 60 % cough medicine / 40 % black licorice . 
  not something you would probably want to taste when you 're just eating breakfast , but that 's because it 's ** fucking alcohol ** . 
  seriously do people who complain about the taste of jager never drink vodka or rum ? 
  that shit literally burns your throat and tastes like poison . 
   you 're trying to tell me it tastes great, 
  you did n't even read my post . 
  do n't mention it, 
  teaching, 
  am i missing a reference ? 
  do n't worry i 'm sure rockstar will see this post and you 'll be taken care of . 
  the ragdoll physics are very taxing on the machine and i imagine online they did n't want 16 people diving all over the place as it would cause a lot of lag . 
  bro are we even playing the same game ? 
   i do n't think you understand how computer resources work . 
  my only issue with this story is how did you know they never lock their door ? 
  tastes like blue , only cleaner !, 
  there there, 
  hey so i know this is 16 hours old and you and most likely everyone else will never see this , but i just watched hercules last night for the first time since i learned how to say words and this iama was just random enough that i felt obligated to post it . 
  to anyone who found this by going through my post history , you could be doing literally anything else and it would be a better use of your time . 
  were it so easy . 
  you should consider * reposting with pictures of the setup or a video . 
  my feeble mind ca n't fully imagine where all the cars should be placed . 
  at what point do you think this gene would have evolved though ? 
  surely 3000 years ago it was n't advantageous to the family in any way to have a homosexual sibling . 
  okay so i just spent the last 10 minutes reading up on it and i have to say i really do n't get it . 
  but i do n't get it in a way that makes me feel like my brain is broken and i am beyond hope , because honestly the fact that at least 3 out of 5 people will either be friends or strangers to me seems completely fucking obvious . 
  like what other possible thing would people think would happen ?
