  i 'm usually pretty reserved i wonder what she said that made me so mad . 
  i like your name , clever . 
  also how did op find these messages , snooping through his phone ? 
  ouch , that kind of invalidates a lot of what he said if he had sent it thinking she would never see it . 
  holy fucking shit, 
  ^ ^ we ^ ^ accept ^ ^ you, 
   these doomsayers just did n't take notice when myspace was replaced or hotmail or yahoo search or when some of the older livestreaming sites were replaced by the current crop, 
  except the most popular services in the `` current crop '' of e-mail , search , and video streaming sites are all owned by google . 
  gmail , google , youtube, 
   the videos are always extremely short ( 8:00 ), 
  are you used to like director 's cut lord of the rings porn ? 
  you ^ can ^ ^ do ^ ^ ^ it, 
  yeah but is the other girl a helicopter pilot ? 
  oh i totally interpreted it as he got someone pregnant and was proud of himself for having made her orgasm , only to find out she did n't . 
   there may be instances that they are , but it 's never a 100 % thing . 
  is n't that what he said ? 
   a 100 + pack-year history of smoking, 
  did anyone else read this and think this guy was the oldest smoker to have ever lived ? 
  congratulations , as an ex-smoker myself i think this had to do with what ^ was saying about the mental addiction being much harder to ignore than the physical addiction . 
  the hardest part for me was just driving down the road or standing outside or going for a walk and thinking , `` well what do i do with my hands ?? '', 
  this is great man , super fun concept !, 
  a couple quick suggestions is that in some cases the two purple enemies are * very * close together , making your timing have to be pretty much perfect to be able to shoot the monkey through without dying , seems a bit difficult for the beginning of the first level . 
  also i wish it was a bit easier to tell which end of the barrel the monkey is going to shoot from , i know you 're thinking `` what is this guy serious there 's a giant arrow on the thing ! '', 
  but since the image for the barrel is congruent on both sides and the white arrow is on a very light background , a more clear indicator of some sort would be nice , especially once you get to later levels and i assume you 'll have to make a lot of decisions quickly . 
  keep up the good work !, 
  $ 16 jager shots . 
  did n't notice, 
  not bad for 15 , better than most of the shit i see in college . 
  well ? 
  i 'm in this boat as well . 
  yep , you could even just maybe make the bottom of the barrel have a thicker black line or do something to distinguish top from bottom without having to alter the actual arrow at all . 
  but this is just off the top of my head i 'm sure if/whatever you end up doing will be great , i look forward to seeing this game in the future !, 
  since everyone in the world seems to get this reference but me , what is it ? 
  did you ask them anything by chance or was it just like , `` hey could i get a photo ? '' . 
  i 've never met them but burnie seems like he 'd be a chill dude, 
  ama request : whoever won that shit, 
  i 'm watching that movie right now and this scene just played seconds before going to reddit . . someone is fucking with me . 
  ^ ( * shifty eyes * ), 
  seriously . 
  `` natural '', 
  i 've noticed that achievement hunter and rooster teeth as well have a really bad habit of running something into the ground when the audience finds it funny . 
  it 's nice that they obviously pay attention to audience feedback and try to give them more of what they like , but every joke or video style that stood out and was well received has been beaten to death by repeats . 
  a good example would be the first far cry video montage joel did with jack , really funny and unexpected , and since everyone loved it they 've since made 3-4 videos that are exactly the same . 
  just like what you 're saying about ryan being crazy and i still cringe every time someone says , `` hey ray , say lleets play '' . 
  ^ but ^ whatever, 
  christ , every time something funny and original is made you can expect a repeat the next week . 
  ^ ( * bitches and moans * ), 
  edit : scene with matt was solid though, 
  man this place is so beautiful i feel like i have to visit before i die , but if i lived there i think i might go crazy , it just seems so small and remote , even hawaii seemed too remote for me and this is next level . 
  what does indigo mean ? 
   no plus/minus , meaning if you get a 90 you get a 4.0 but if you get an 89.9 you end up with a 3.0 on your record, 
  that sucks , i failed a calculus class last year because i never showed up , so i totally deserved it , but i did all of the work and ended the semester with a 69 % , professor would n't bump me up to a 70 % so i had to repeat the class . 
   from what i 've seen china does n't really believe cheating is wrong culturally . 
  it 's almost like people achieved something by getting around the rules . 
  fun fact !, 
  many moons ago in imperial china there was something parents would send their smartest child to go take called the `` imperial exam '' . 
  it was notoriously difficult and students would literally spend years studying for it , and their parents ( who were usually poor farmers ) would spend the bulk of their income on tutors , etc. 
  to help prepare their kid . 
  because if the child passed then they were given high offices in the government and would be able to take in more money than the rest of their family combined . 
  anyways , since there was so much riding on these exams and most families could only afford to send their children once , naturally there was much cheating , [ here is some underwear that one person wore while taking the exam covered in notes ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/imperial_examination_cheating_material.jpg ) . 
  this post is pretty far down and i do n't know if anyone will see it , but ^ the ^ ^ more ^ ^ you ^ ^ ^ know, 
  damn time for me to go hunting for some native san francisco bison . 
  perhaps strictly geographically speaking , but i could just get a taxi to the airport and fly to the mainland super quickly , the picture above would require me to catch a couple boats to get to the mainland shore and then find an airport big enough to fly me the fuck outta there, 
  a dog !, 
  * googles dr. karl *, 
  * finds out he 's australian *, 
  * proceeds to read every question and answer in this ama in an australian accent *, 
  this was a well-written and informative post , but i believe that perhaps the misunderstanding came from the fact that ragey may live in the usa , so therefore `` we '' would mean other americans to him , and not australians . 
  * disappears in a cloud of ~ ~ smoke ~ ~ dust *, 
  ^ ( please do n't be from the us ), 
  hundreds of redditors now disappointed they ca n't eat like shit and lose 40 lbs, 
  what episode is this, 
  this could be my chance !, 
  yeah that was cool, 
  ah reddit , wishing rape on people as revenge . 
  nothing you could 've done deserved being shot at , but if you 're living with the person you 're cheating on you should probably expect some crazy shit to go down when they find out , especially if they 're female . 
  i got it, 
  translation ? 
   i 've also gone on vacations and cruises with friends, 
   pretty much every summer , winter , and spring break , i either visit a friend , have a friend visit me , or take a trip with a friend, 
   i 'm in college, 
  i wish i was rich . 
  my dad was alive for this , looks like it was before color pictures though, 
  they all more or less describe me except halloween , which would just be a straight line pretty much . 
  maybe a slight downward curve because getting drunk and hooking up with scantily-clad women still is n't as fun as being a six year old dinosaur and trick or treating . 
  pretty sure it 's a girl, 
  jesus where were you when i had to write a toast for my communications class ? 
  ** do n't put the freaking punchline in the freaking title **, 
  are you really a housewife ? 
  are you in california ? 
  except the number would be scaled even higher actually since women are probably more likely to be on reddit while on their period than say , going to the movies or for a jog, 
  hm , where about are you from ? 
  do you have any proof beyond anecdotal evidence ? 
  edit : i guess 5 people thus far have found my question offensive or something , i 'm truthfully asking and am not trying to subversively hurt someone 's feelings or something , but if anyone is open to a logical discussion on this topic i 've since expanded on my original question in a reply below . 
  just to be clear , i 'm not a professional ` quote maker ' . 
  i 'm just an atheist teenager who greatly values his intelligence and scientific fact over any silly fiction book written 3,500 years ago . 
  this being said , i am open to any and all criticism . 
  ` in this moment , i am euphoric . 
  not because of any phony god 's blessing . 
  but because , i am enlightened by my intelligence . ',
