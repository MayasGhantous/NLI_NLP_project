  i promise i will choose better music for the footage of your demise by my stone sword . 
  damn . . 
  what does that even mean ? 
  you think there is a 51 % chance of there being no higher power ? 
  ^ ( get me a tailor i ca n't afford it ), 
  where did anyone say that was football ? 
   direct experience with mmo or equivalent client/server topologies as used in online games, 
  i meet everything but that as i 'm sure many others here do as well . 
  that 's going to be eliminating a lot of applicants , but i 'm sure you probably know that . 
  really ? 
  it was n't, 
   masters degree in computer science , engineering , or other relevant technical discipline preferred, 
  are we all retarded ? 
  haha this feeling is so weird , sometimes i would be driving into the school parking lot and when getting out of my car think , `` the last thing i remember is me starting my car , i hope i did n't kill anyone on my way here . . '', 
  * bill burr *, 
  lol i 'm not so sure about that . 
  i 'm in my second year of university and nearly every female friend on facebook has some `` model '' photos with some bullshit watermark near the corner . 
  the only difference is they paid the photographer not the other way around . 
  ^ ^ tactful, 
  i do n't think this really is a hifw post , but rules are rules . 
  speaking of which , what about this post on the front of / r/funny right now that literally has `` how i feel when '' in the title ? 
  no problem , one day i will hit the front page . 
   fyi : many governments are rumored to be able to guess a trillion passphrases a second . 
  but for bruteforcing tor and pgp , that 's not enough, 
  i think this may be a bit off , but thanks for the links !, 
  as someone who was only 8 years old at the time , could anyone explain why they were originally so sure that it was the japanese ? 
  were tensions high with them at that time due to other events ? 
  or was it simply because they were the only ones to successfully attack the us homeland, 
  if you look around the edges , op literally went to a site like quickmeme and found this already-made one , screenshotted / cropped it and posted it here . 
  holy shit me neither !, 
  is your name bryan ? 
  ^ ^ where ^ ^ is ^ ^ he ? 
  ^ ^ ^ edit : ^ ^ ^ thanks ^ ^ ^ j0be !, 
  as someone who lives in san francisco : maybe if we all just pretend the crazy people do n't exist they 'll disappear . 
  holy shit good job on that domain, 
  hooray !, 
  i totally thought it meant `` i did n't see that coming '', 
  it 's one of our main exports . 
   not advised to look at if you 're eating . 
  you should know redditor 's immediately stop reading and click whenever blue text shows up . 
  and i should have read your warning , i 'm eating a beef pot pie . 
   i have legs like a linebacker, 
  wow, 
   because i was a linebacker, 
   source : 6 ' 6 '' at 195lbs .

  what do you do for t-shirts ? 
  holy fuck . . ** two dans !? 
  this comment reminded me how much i ducking hate my phone 's autocorrect . 
  why does it look like part of his right arm is falling off ? 
  or like there is a long rod poking out of the skin ? 
  i 've reviewed it and i 'm sorry but without physically mailing in the evidence there is no way i can know for sure if what you claim is true . 
  on the bright side it 's only 4 more days until the reset !, 
  but that comment is elsewhere , it seems like the srs comment relates to black people seeing magic , which is quoted from an aziz ansari stand up special, 
  why 30 ? 
  why 30 ? 
  that 's just the way it is ? 
  thank you, 
  thankyou , this is better than everyone saying , `` it just is '', 
   i 'm brown, 
  what happened ? 
  no matter what country you enter you can be charged with rape if you have sex with someone under the age of consent from where you come from . 
  edit : hm , downvotes . 
  sorry to rain on your parade you fucking weirdos, 
  they 're hardly distinguishable, 
  we 're talking about redditors here, 
  worst bathroom to be hungover in ever . 
  is it that unbelievable ?

   #secretkeeper #onlyweknow #theydontsuspectanything, 
  i thought it was wat ? 
  til, 
  what ? 
  the arrow should be pointing the other way, 
  well what about anthony weiner ? 
  he gets off by showing girls his cock , but the whole nation thought that was hilarious after it mysteriously `` leaked '' and his reputation was destroyed . 
  money and power ? 
  people still download porn ? 
  that is some dirty water, 
   full of sediment, 
   not `` dirty '', 
  lol alright, 
  damn i just got rid of all mine i wish i had seen this post first , probably the best deal on here .
