  most people just have one, 
  why are you so tall ? 
  do you play basketball !, 
  as someone who is just now downloading bf4 ( at a blistering 100 kb / s , see you guys in a few days ! ), 
  what is the difference between the two modes then if the scoring is the same ? 
  what movie is this ? 
  edit : thanks everyone , it 's dumb and dumber, 
  can confirm ; am swanland resident . 
  `` all press is good press '', 
  cool , thanks !, 
  real excited to start playing but this download has literally been going for 13 hours so far and is just over half-done , any suggestions on easy ways to increase the speed ? 
  it 's not like my internet is shitty it must be an origin issue . 
  : c this unfortunately does n't seem far fetched . 
  how would that make it better ? 
  if you think it 's right for ea to charge full retail price for a game twice in order for you to get the content . 
  do you think when n8wolf said `` filthy screen shotter . '', 
  he was implying that it was wrong since the other person knew about it ? 
  source ? 
  thank you , i knew the smoke must obviously be photoshop but i could n't for the life of me figure out how they got the cat to make that suction face , idk why a vacuum did n't cross my mind . 
  we do ? 
  i would 100 % miss my connecting flight . 
  i 'm going to let you know before some 12 year old comes in and says , '' * whoooosh huehuehue * '' that you missed the joke , read the op again it really is quite clever . 
  ^ ^ ^ edit : ^ ^ ^ spelling, 
  this will most likely never be seen but i really appreciate the reddit admins letting us know when there is expected downtime even when it 's as short as 5 minutes . 
  it 's such a refreshing sense of respect for community that you do n't really find on any other major online service like blizzard or xbox live where their service will go down without warning or not work properly for hours at a time , and costs money . 
   rumor is that this jesus_haxmaster could cast [ resurrect ] on others also . 
  i actually never heard about that , unless you 're talking about the bug which also made players server transfer to the [ heaven or hell ] realm after having [ resurrect ] casted on them . 
  i learn more about this game every day . 
  wow, 
  this is the cat equivalent of girls on facebook who blur everything around them and add filters to seem prettier . 
  when i saw that the top was labelled with letters instead of numbers [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyaygli1qd0 ) song immediately started playing in my head . 
  i 'm afraid to say that it influenced my answer heavily . 
  seriously , if i were this guy i would have never published my identity .

  ^ ^ ^ * negatively, 
  i appreciate what you are trying to do . 
  i 'm curious : if a man was drunk driving and hit/killed your wife would you kill him if it were allowed ? 
  and same situation but if the man was sober and simply glanced away from the road for a second . 
  oh you motherfucker, 
  because you should n't help out a girl who is drunk and afraid at a party in the hopes that she 'll suck your dick afterwards . 
  do n't wish that upon anyone . . 
  the league , on netflix . 
  ^ watch ^ it, 
  wow very atypical for sony to put a big musically-timed `` sony '' ad right in the beginning of their trailer , very interesting my guess is it must be because of the current console war that they want to get their brand name out through every medium possible . 
  is n't / r/funny a default sub ? 
  edit : oh fuck its my cakeday i need something to post, 
  . . but . . but they swim !, 
  ^ ^ im ^ ^ ^ retarded, 
  anyone who does n't say halo 2 , did n't play halo 2 in it 's prime . 
  nothing [ has ] beat that community [ since ] . 
  ^ ( edit : because there may have been something great before halo 2 ), 
  i think you may be right . 
  a zombie with one sock rolled up to the knee and the other scrunched down to the ankle . 
  i agree with everything but the ending was pretty bad imo . 
  i think everyone just really wants to like it, 
  what do they do ? 
  you should probably knock, 
  incest causing children with birth defects has been debunked . 
  you are n't going to win since the auctions are at least 20k above that now and expected to be double your current balance tomorrow . 
  i 'm sorry i ca n't change that , but what i can do is help you recoup the value of your points before it 's too late and you 're stuck with 30k useless points . 
  if interested pm me or add me on skype at bcurran19, 
  how many are you at ? 
  . . i 'll take those first two off your hands . 
  can you please tell me what this is from ? 
  it 's driving me crazy because i feel like i 've read or heard it before , is it the map description ? 
  well for one the site prohibits members under age 14 . 
  edit : guess it 's under 13 , cutting it close !, 
  wait how do i setup filters like that ? 
  can i be notified whenever someone on reddit posts `` rock '' for example ? 
  edit : you guys : c, 
  this actually makes sense, 
  damn seeing big sprawling cities like this always make me think . 
  this city had a population of 9.82 million people ( back in 2005 ) , so there are millions of people in this picture who will never know or hear of you , each dealing with some task at the very moment it was taken . 
  i wonder statistically how many people within the bounds of this picture are currently giving birth , getting mugged , interviewing for a job or playing starcraft 2 . 
  i 've definitely got to agree with scott on this one . 
  i also do n't play/watch baseball , but the umpire is positioned specifically to ensure rules are followed regarding where the batter is standing / that the ball is pitched within the legal zone etc. 
  he could n't very well do that standing off to the side . 
  are you talking about jon stewart or the videos he is criticizing ? 
  both are on american networks , so no , not all programs are terrible . 
  i 'm glad there are other redditors who can test the things i am too lazy to so i know if it works or not . 
  not that i 'll ever try it , but at least now i can sleep knowing this works . 
  unfortunately not . 
  well i 'm pretty sure most people understand a major plot point in a movie called * the titanic * but people still choose to watch it . 
  ^ san ^ francisco ^ ^ represent ^ ^ ^ im ^ ^ ^ so ^ ^ ^ cold, 
   about as smart as trying to make a modern military shooter as a aaa dev . 
  unless you bring something truly mind-blowing to the table you 're not going to get far, 
  [ lol ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/halo_4#sales ) , [ what ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/call_of_duty:_black_ops_ii#sales_and_revenue ), 
  am i getting whooshed right now ? 
  personally i wish `` hardcore '' games were more popular . 
  when i say hardcore i mean elements like dropping/losing all of your items upon dying in an rpg , or maybe only getting 1 life in a mmo shooter before being penalized , or losing your ship upon dying in a space sim . 
  that is what makes minecraft so addicting to me is that it seems no other game is really embracing this idea of actually being able to * lose * progress when you fuck up like hardcore deathban servers are doing ( [ plug for the reddit hardcore server ] ( http://reddit.com/r/hardcoresmp ) ) . 
  yeah zombies seem so overused right now but i ca n't think of what other enemy can fill such a niche ? 
  i mean i guess aliens but you ca n't really make a game like minecraft or dead rising with aliens . 
  looks more like paul walker . 
  yeah an open-world zombie title would be cool , i hope the new day-z is good . 
  that must be it . 
  oh , he said it would be dumb to make one as a aaa developer , maybe it was a typo .
