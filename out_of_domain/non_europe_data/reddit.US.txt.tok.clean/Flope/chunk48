  people are * notorious * for trolling , telling lies , and pretending to be someone they 're not on reddit and other similar forums . 
  reddit ( in general ) is infested with people who are attempting to manipulate the opinions of others and advance a particular point of view/world view . 
  and what 's worse , on reddit people have a * powerful incentive to tell people what they want to hear * in the form of karma and upvotes . 
  i do n't know, 
  wait . . really ? 
  til, 
  cool username, 
   the mean streets of providence, 
  i lol 'd, 
  this is hilarious , and what a relief that it is n't because you 're horribly ugly !, 
  `` bear with me '' takes on a totally different meaning in this thread and i was terribly confused, 
  `` hook up '' . 
  i think most younger people do but it seems to fly right past older generations , at least in my family . 
  whenever i had friends over in high school my mom would usually come in and say something like , `` i 'm so glad you boys had a chance to hook up tonight . '', 
  she just used it to mean hang out . 
  hardly . 
  i 'm happy for you but idk why you would call it the `` final '' wave . 
  myself and two other people i know who won have n't received our e-mails yet . 
   you think they 'd wan na finish it off , right ? 
  i wish , hopefully i do n't have to wait the same timespan that passed between the previous shipment and this one . 
  right now this link has 2 upvotes and 1 downvote . 
  i wonder if everyone downvoted it how many people would never see it as a result . 
   if i circle around a lamppost when i 'm walking down the street , sometimes i 'll have to go all the way back a few blocks later and circle around the opposite direction , to ` balance ' it . 
  almost like there 's an infinitely long thread attached to me that gets tangled up on things . 
  ever feel or know anyone who has discomfort with `` breaking the chain '' as this girl i know calls it ? 
  where you are with a group of people and say there is a lamppost or other obstruction in the path you are walking , and some people walk past on one side and others go on the other side ? 
  she would literally force the smaller group of people to walk back and go around the same way the majority did . 
  a lot of people got really fed up with it , including myself , now i feel kind of bad . 
  i think you 're joking , but 84 really is a solid number . 
  could just be because 4 is my favorite though . 
  4 is great . 
  four . 
  haha i 'm sorry but this is hilarious, 
  as someone with no idea or knowledge about any of this stuff , i 'm curious : within a group of people who all have some degree or type of ocd , is there a pretty standardized idea of `` man this sucks but i 'm sure glad i do n't have x type of ocd '' or `` why is there a person with x ocd in here , it 's hardly an issue ? '', 
  i imagine hoarding would probably be one that people who do n't have it are glad they do n't , but perhaps those people are then glad they do n't have an issue with cleanliness .

  edit : wrong person but yeah i 'm with ya , hopefully they come this week . 
  december 5th, 
  the thing is the store is literally employing people and paying them to do this . 
  * barf *, 
  that makes sense , thanks for the insight !, 
  sounds like being there was an interesting experience , hope it was helpful . 
  i 'm curious what crime you committed while on lsd . 
  was it more akin to being nude in public or eating someone 's face ? 
  ahh i 'm not sure why i did n't think of that, 
  whoops , was familiar with the event but did n't know what article i had first read about it . 
  if you do some searching on reddit or google you can see different language used in each one , unfortunately i must delete my first post as my already minuscule karma reserves are starting to dive . 
  ** lets ask / u/unidan !!, 
  honestly i 'd be alright with constant surveillance like we have now if the data gathered was freely available to everybody instead of like 100 creeps . 
  ** thanks **, 
  the one under the button ? 
  every time you post a picture i am disappointed by the lack of waldo . 
  it is usually harder to convince people that the same is true with lsd , even though there has only ever been one reported human overdose in history , and it was in 1975 when a man [ reportedly injected over 300,000 micrograms intravenously ( the average hit of lsd is only 100 micrograms , so this is over 3,000 times the dose ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lysergic_acid_diethylamide#dosage ) , even then the reports were inconclusive that lsd was the cause of death . 
  edit : i know we 're the child comments of a hidden comment so these will probably never be seen , but you should probably change the `` overdose due to smoking '' to more specifically mention marijuana . 
  it feels like / r/atheism is leaking . . 
  this is probably it due to the sign saying to approach from the front only as op said . 
  piggy backing off of this , what do you think about * pacific rim * ? 
  what is this referencing ? 
  how did you go from a few guys working on your garage to 55 people and a `` multi million dollar '' budget ? 
  were you paying these millions out of pocket ? 
  i 'm worried about you , man . 
  wow this is awesome and super generous , good on you !, 
  where is waldo ? 
  as a biologist i think he would disagree with that . 
  also in case it was n't obvious to anyone reading that , the last caption was added by a different artist . 
  haha yeah the first one showed up and circled around / b / for a while before the new one with the added bottom popped up on the same board . 
  i do n't think it 's trying to spread apathy but instead getting people riled up at the idea of their votes not counting . 
  subtle . 
  to be honest it does n't really matter where they are coming from , nearly everything i see in that subreddit is patronizing or intentionally offensive to people who follow a certain religion , catholicism and christianity especially . 
  i 've never before encountered such a large and concentrated group of people so intent on making fun of or converting people from alternate ideas to their own . 
  even if they come from an area where these religions are n't as popular does n't mean they should n't have any manners or respect . 
  ** we did it / r/atheism !!, 
  not really . 
  he would n't know it though since the atheist probably had to hide the fact that he did n't believe in god lest he be mercilessly persecuted by the religious zealots . 
  strangely reminiscent of the holocaust . 
  you know i never actually tried breathing with my mouth while it was closed before . 
  it was interesting . . 
  is this from the celebrity ghost hunters one ? 
  wow his last link did worse than mine, 
  [ life is a struggle man , i hope you make it through ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1qmjsa/saw_this_is_indianapolis_made_my_day/cdecokh?context=3 ), 
  eh not really . 
  then it just becomes a matter of , `` unfortunately many cyber terrorists have been registering domains and servers to host questionable material , so we are now temporarily * blocking any domain registration services for the safety of this country . '', 
  is isp 's blocking websites a regular thing where you live ? 
  and apparently from the bay area . 
  howdy neighbor !, 
  it 's cold outside, 
  is this why hippos have beards ? 
  how the hell did you convince anyone that it was n't suicide ?? 
  `` i tripped and fell on the trigger '' ? 
  that sucks but if you do n't mind me asking , really how did it happen ? 
  i am now wrong and jealous . 
  edit : is * hella * a common word over there ? 
  ** god damn it reddit if mcdonalds fry cooks do n't make a doctor 's wage i do n't want to live in this country !, 
  is that the new golden iphone case ? 
  looks sweet, 
  fuck you, 
   some species sleep unihemispherically, 
  is this what happens with fish like certain sharks , that are said to `` never sleep '' or `` never stop swimming '' or something similar ? 
  do they just keep the part of their brain that makes them swim turned on always ? 
  edit : also just want to say i 've been reading your responses and they 're super interesting , but it 's crazy how specific a niche like sleeping oriented comp neuroscience specializing in circadian rhythms is .
