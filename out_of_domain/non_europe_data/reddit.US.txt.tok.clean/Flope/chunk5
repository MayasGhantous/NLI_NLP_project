  i 'm either in class , at home ( village ) , at a party or walking between one of those three places . 
  however i do have a nice ~ 20 minute break between classes on tuesday/thursday that i always spend at the cafe in front of the humanities building . 
  ( i get their bacon/egg/cheese sandwich every tth ), 
  it 's really expensive , but the best place to live on-campus . 
  the only thing that rivals it are the towers at centennial square , but i 've heard from friends who have lived in both that the village is much better . 
  if you have any specific questions about it let me know , i know finding videos online of the rooms can be hard since i was trying to find them ~ 3 months ago . 
  hey !, 
  i saw you about 4-5 months ago at an open house event my school was doing . 
  i really wanted to say hi but you were with your family so i also did n't want to bug you , so i just awkwardly stood about 20 feet away with my friends . 
  as a tall guy myself i do n't know how you skate so well . 
  the boards are so tiny and so far down there !, 
  holy fuck that was depressing , felt like i was going to be sick halfway through . 
  from slowmo guys on youtube, 
  are you like a depression novelty account ? 
  total him !, 
  til you can tell how nice people are by looking at their mugshots . 
  huh , it actually took me surprisingly less time than i thought it would to get there from rooster teeth . 
  same, 
  8 mile, 
  til dominant = domestic violence, 
  i am also that 1 player . 
  ama, 
  whenever i play theres ~ 8-15 players on . 
  will probably increase once the month resets , no ? 
  there 's no way you could have gotten that last one , ticf . 
  hmmmmmmmmmmm . 
  i am intrigued . 
  tell me sir , by which master were you trained ? 
  did n't this exact image literally hit the front page *** yesterday *** ? 
  [ obligatory ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/thelastairbender/comments/vrxmd/whenever_i_get_criticized_for_stating_why_i/ ), 
  . . but sex is a ** man 's ** responsibility !, 
  i agree !, 
  everything he drew was a million times better than what i drew during the same test at home . 
  props . 
  because it was too hard to hold he switched !, 
  i read through this thinking this guy reacted pretty similarly to how i did during my first lsd experience , when i tried drawing . 
  especially during the first few pictures his quotes are very similar to my own . 
  that 's what he just said . 
  give / r/mildlyinteresting a shot , i 've been subbed for a while and everything that reaches my front page is ... well you know, 
  i love how eloquently everyone spoke back then . 
  the subject was very well mannered throughout and described everything perfectly . 
  my sentiments exactly . 
  how do they know this was n't just a suicide attempt . . and successful ? 
  *** ** all my rage !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!, 
  showed more comments specifically to find this comment , and downvoted appropriately . 
  this stupid fad will die out if i have to kill it myself !, 
  shut up . 
  oh wow how do you know ricky ? 
  if you 're pretty , tell him !, 
  please tell me there is a subreddit where i can find things like this, 
  oh my god , this hurts to think about . 
  imagine sticking with something for 54 months to just abort it . 
  * shudder *, 
  * what a tweest !, 
  i do n't see anything wrong with putting a picture you took of yourself on facebook . 
  * there i said it !, 
  * out of nowhere i 'm hearing all these people talking down on `` selfies '' , just hearing the word makes me cringe , so stupid . 
  i 'm kind of tired of seeing the same old duckface photos over and over , but honestly the other day i know a girl who posted a picture of her halloween costume and was chastised for taking a selfie . 
  yeah i go to college up here in sf and it 's cloudy nearly 100 % of the time on my campus . 
  rain is not uncommon either , the irony is that the person being referenced by op is probably a tourist herself . 
  thanks but that did n't fix it i had tried that previously . 
  all that does is make me unable to move the screen around , but the tiles are still rendered in the same distorted way .

  food . 
  oh my god that was it !, 
  thankyou so much !, 
  hey thanks again for the help . 
  since you seem knowledgeable on java , i was wondering if you knew of any other good tutorials for making games beginner levelish other than thecherno ? 
  im going to keep following his series , but his episodes are becoming less and less progressive with barely any changes it seems like , especially the latest ( 24 ) , so im trying to keep busy with other tutorials but i cant seem to find any good ones . 
  im trying to decide if i want to take java as a class at my college next semester . 
  thanks !, 
  being from california , i decided to go and do some research on traffic fatalities per state and prove your notions of californian drivers wrong . 
  turns out we have the most traffic fatalities per year , by a lot . 
  that was crazy !, 
  why in the world was the guy filming in the first place though ? 
  seems odd, 
  still seems a bit ridiculous . 
  i doubt anyone would really need something like that unless they regularly try to find some seriously hard-to-find porn . 
  why is n't he sitting in the back ? 
  great tutorial , easy to follow . 
  though i wish there was a more noticeable difference when running my program at the end of each episode . 
  this is awesome !, 
  haha, 
  i thought the art was fantastic during the trip as well, 
  that was the joke , ** you got it !, 
  someone at the cia just got fired . 
  you 'd probably have to ask rachael and eldon rosen , they have the last one from what i hear . 
  flope ( shamoo , qru ) has read and agree to these rules . 
  i ca n't even keep my closet this organized . 
  did n't notice . 
  many abrahamic religions believe that one of god 's most precious gifts to mankind was the gift of `` free will '' . 
  i do n't think anyone believes that god is up there playing toy soldiers in countries such as syria , it would be up to the people/his followers to decide their fate . 
  i think the boy ? 
  not sure . 
  what curse did you place upon this comment ? 
  as a br ** y ** an , i appreciate it . 
  you probably feel about me the way i feel about anyone named bryant . 
  i was hoping this post was linking to this, 
  i was in your same shoes until i got the 10 day trial , just bought a month a couple days ago when it ended . 
  for me , the best addition : battle pets !,
