  i do n't kos people for wearing certain clothes and i get along just fine . 
  i can take care of my stuff , i rather be responsible for my own mp3 player than putting it along with hundreds of thousands of other people 's mp3 players in the hands of a single entity that could lose them all at once . 
  just playing devil 's advocate here , but there are pros and cons to every system . 
  our current technology is just not at the point where you can ever be ** 100 % ** guaranteed lifetime ownership of something you purchased unless you have a physical copy of it in your hands .

   the writing is of solid quality, 
  i 'm not the guy you 're replying to , but do you have any examples of this ? 
  like what determines if a children 's show has solid writing or not ? 
  would you say spongebob ( your example ) had good writing , and do you think that was better or worse than this show ? 
  damn this account is just over 2 years old , is n't that like right when this . . eh , fad ?

  * - broke computer science student *,

  i , too keep an unused youtube tab open next to all of my reddit tabs .

  goodbye to the next 20 minutes of my life . 
  from what i hear you 'll be spending a lot of your time in the army playing video games .

  halo 1 was just a couple months after 9/11 .

  counter videogame-insurgency ? 
  this is hilarious to me . 
  i imagine a redditor dawning a full trench coat and shielding his galaxy tablet from the dim glare of the light behind the bar with his fedora as he browses quickmeme . 
  why else would you go to a bar ? 
  jennifer aniston is hot .

  dear lord if this is considered a * big * patch this game will be in alpha for years, 
  what 's the difference between a bambi and a deer ? 
  a bambi , in this instance , is a metaphorical representation cast upon a player that is thought to be new , innocent or naive , much like the famous disney doe from which the name is derived from ; where deer is the actual biological name of the species of animal that the nickname is based off of . 
  ^ ^ i ^ ^ love ^ ^ ^ jokes, 
  i dun get it, 
  that is a fish, 
  seems just like dayz, 
   there is literally no final goal in the game . 
  you can maybe get more gear , or build a house to store more gear , or ... well , that 's it . 
  everything you do is just a way to make sure you can kill other people . 
  it 's like the slowest deathmatch game ever . 
   ** it does n't really have much in common to dayz , though . 
  am i getting whooshed or are you retarded ? 
  i get it, 
  ^ ^ i ^ ^ love ^ ^ you, 
  oh my god !!, 
  til i know nothing of what furniture costs . 
  you said they were expensive so i imagined them topping out at about $ 400 - $ 650 at most . 
  the embody is over $ 1,100 !, 
  that would piss me off so much . 
  i would be flying a helicopter in bf4 or about snipe someone probably right before it locks up . 
  damn you beat me to it . 
  i ca n't believe people upvoted this to the front page . 
  dude from the most recent picture on your blog you look like 18 years old .

  that 's how eminem rhymes it, 
  i used to live there and i was about to say i 'm pretty sure tahoe is much much larger than this . 
  edit : [ yep , just checked google maps , that seems about right . 
  came to the comments to make fun of some idiot on youtube who felt it necessary to point out that it 's fake , as if it was n't clear enough . 
  top 3 comments in this thread . . 
  i like the spreadsheet !, 
  edit : this is actually a helpful way to see about what i can expect per dollar/gold spent on packs,

   lol time to play spot the middle schooler, 
  i think i won ? 
  this is the best video i 've seen all day, 
  `` walk sternly but carry a small twig . '', 
  as someone who has never watched the simpsons ( i 'm serious ) but has been meaning to , is there 1 or 2 episodes that stick out to you as really funny that someone who may not be familiar with all of the characters would still find enjoyable ? 
  also where do people even watch this stuff , fox ? 
  ha that was pretty good , wish it ended differently though,
