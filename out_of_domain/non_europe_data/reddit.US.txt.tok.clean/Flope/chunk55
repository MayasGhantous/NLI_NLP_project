  i ca n't view vimeo videos , anyone have a yt mirror ? 
  sorry for the long response , it 's 7:30 am and i 've been up all night so i kind of blabbered . 
  do n't feel like you have to read it i 'm just thinking out loud . 
  tldr : i very much appreciate your specific feedback and i agree with you that some things have been glazed over that should/will be addressed in detail soon . 
  thank you for the specific feedback , i agree that there are definitely a lot of things that i have n't gone into detail about while still implementing those things in our programs at the same time which could be jarring for people . 
  i 've recognized the frustration that this may cause myself which is why i 've decided to make a few videos which specifically are focused on one key topic , such as the latest episode 4 which is devoted entirely to methods . 
  i rewatch my videos all the time to find things i 'd like to improve on and i agree that some of the stuff we 've been doing deserves to be explained further in-depth . 
  however , i do not regret creating the first three episodes the way i did since i think they accomplished what i set out to , which is to show people that it * is * possible to make a functional program that * does * something with very little programming knowledge . 
  i wanted to expose people to some of the key components of any program or game such as variables , printing to the console , loops and if statements and imagined that those tools alone would allow people to create a lot of cool things on their own time in between videos . 
  moving forward into more complex programs * will * require a more detailed explanation of things that we have taken for granted thus far though such as public/private/static , methods , classes ( next video ) etc. 
  which is why starting with 4 i 'm going to cover some of these in their own video . 
  [ cross coast gaming ] ( http://youtube.com/crosscoastgaming ) is currently developing a beginner java series starting with episode 1 [ here ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrypn2cpay8 ) . 
  i 'm not sure how much experience you have so you may find the pacing to be slow in the beginning , but episode 2 teaches a guess the number game and episode 3 shows how to make tic tac toe . 
  i 've known the creator of these tutorials since before birth so i can vouch for their quality . 
  happy learning !,

  yeah i do n't get it either, 
  . . but that did n't end up happening , it still is running on arma 2 / arma 3 engines, 
   how zombies react to it, 
  music players . 
  does this mean if we can gather enough bundles of sticks and rolls of duct tape we can eventually assemble our own space ships ? 
  good for who ? 
  okay i 'll bite . 
  where is the meteor ? 
  get back to work, 
  they were both in their late 40s, 
  how * you * doin ? 
  what do you say we get out of this thread m ` lady ? 
  * tips 3 fedoras *, 
  mostly interested in the dude masturbating ontop of cars in san diego, 
  you could n't figure out that the reason they were covered in blankets was to keep them warm ? 
  i 'll ask him tonight and get back to you . 
  jesus 7 years . 
  there 's times where i get so annoyed and borderline furious that hundreds of upvotes appear on the same stupid jokes every single thread every day i usually need to log off for a while and consider not coming back ; and i 've just passed 2 years . 
  i ca n't imagine how brutal it must be to know the punchline of all of reddit 's jokes for 7 years . 
  ` an hero ' does mean commit suicide on 4chan . 
  i just downvoted up_n_atom because i think anyone who says ` whoosh ' is a fucking faggot . 
  ^ ( that does n't make me feel better . ), 
  i have been called a hot chick once actually though i fear it is because my friend was very drunk and we were in high school at the time . 
  sweet thanks for the info !, 
  so this is definitely fake , right ? 
  do n't mention it, 
  things do n't always go according to plan but i appreciate your support !, 
  edit : just realized this was [ you ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/1vw9ue/not_your_average_aww_but_bats_being_treated_for/cexgiol ) , i was very confused for a moment . 
  oh my god ahahahaha dude you should have not replied to this post in addition to the java thing i made , i was so fucking confused why someone would write that it would 've driven me mad . 
  wow this seems helpful, 
   i mean , we spy on our own people but we do n't put them in prison for protesting ... yet . 
  uhh , pretty sure any kind of physical action during an organized anti-government event could be construed as assaulting or threatening an officer of the law , which carries a hefty sentence . 
  so why not just protest peacefully and sit on the ground and do nothing ? 
  [ this is why ] ( http://technologos.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/lieutenant-john-pike-walks-up-and-down-the-line-spraying-students-in-the-face.jpg ), 
  i 'll let it slide just this once . 
   or when creating classes , do the same thing . 
  do n't say `` lets call this class xyz and give it attributes of 1 , 8 , 9 and blah blah blah . '', 
  instead , do something like `` lets call this class a closet and give it attributes of shirts = 8 , ties = 9 , socks = 34 , jackets = 1 . '', 
  i think you 'll really like the latest episode on classes i just did , very similar !, 
  thanks for the suggestion as well !, 
  out of curiosity , was this after or during his presidency ? 
  i imagine it must be after, 
  i do n't know about stage fright , he delivered a hell of a speech to the nation and world when declaring war on iraq . 
  i like it, 
  as usual , i read the title , thought `` no shit '' , then read the subreddit name and grinned like a retard . 
  looking really nice , love the art style and the mechanic of switching gravity . 
  one thing i 'm curious about though is how you are preventing the player from just flying around the level by switching gravity ? 
  or is that to be allowed, 
  / r/forwardsfromgrandma, 
  ahh , now i get it , i totally missed that the first time around . 
  thanks for explaining and i ca n't wait to see more updates !, 
   that 's some serious shit, 
  i think i probably sympathize more with the civilians who are standing against a fully-armored police force . 
  holy shit is there a relevant reddit thread somewhere and is this from ukraine ? 
  thanks for the encouragement !, 
  yeah i was using my laptop 's built in microphone for the first couple videos and came to the same conclusion you did so ended up purchasing a blue yeti . 
  good idea about the program as well !, 
  did n't work haha, 
  edit : now it appears it did . 
  good idea i 'll xpost to there , though i get afraid of submitting to default subreddits . 
  thanks for the advice , yeah i noticed this as well haha . 
  if you look forward a couple videos you 'll see i increase the font by almost double , unless you 're saying that is too small as well . 
  ha thank you for the compliment , i must admit i was actually a bit afraid of submitting to a main sub , but so far it seems to be doing alright even though the post is in it 's infancy . 
  you and me are going to be good friends , pal . 
  i was actually considering redoing the first 2 since they were recorded before i bought my new blue yeti microphone . 
  excellent advice !, 
  the only thing that worries me is that say a month from now i redo episode 1 , people will see the new version has like 4 views and not want to watch it . 
  hope you like it , feel free to pm me here or leave a comment on the video with any feedback/suggestions/questions . 
  someone else answered but yes it is java . 
  cool hope you like it !, 
  sounds good hope you enjoy !, 
  technically i am too if you count japan and china as asian countries . 
  ** boom ** ^ ^ roasted, 
  the text gets bigger and the sound quality better !, 
  thanks for the support !, 
  i ca n't believe people are still referencing this . 
  edit : in a good way, 
  you know some of the first actual `` programming '' experience i have is from learning javascript on codeacademy , though that was years ago and they 've revamped their curriculum quite a few times . 
  i can not recommend that site highly enough , it 's great !, 
  as far as your question , java and javascript being related is just a misnomer , the phrase i like the best to describe it is :, 
  * `` java is to javascript as a car is to cardboard '' *,
