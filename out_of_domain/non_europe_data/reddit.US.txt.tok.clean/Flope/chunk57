  just looked through the top 30 , this place is pretty cool !, 
  not to be `` that guy '' but i see unidan posts some links in there from time to time as well . 
  someone does n't like their job . 
  this is genius . . 
  how is bait car legal ? 
  is it real ? 
  i feel like that 's not true, 
  i think both posts are equally as bad and you are being disingenuous with your analysis . 
  oh so that 's jennifer lawrence , that 's the girl everyone on reddit is obsessed with ? 
  i feel like using your username does n't usually lend itself so nicely to the conversation . 
  i 'm pretty sure you will attract some negative attention for wearing these in high school unless it 's incredibly waspy and in an affluent neighborhood , but that does n't mean you should n't follow your dreams just be prepared !, 
  am i missing something ? 
  i have no idea what it must be like to live with autism , and i mean this respectfully and sincerely :, 
  i think you 're very fortunate that you were born when you were considering the advent of the internet . 
  i ( and it appears everyone else here ) would have never in a million years guessed there was anything different about you and anyone else here , except that maybe you are better at explaining things than most people here . 
  entire businesses are run completely online now and it 's possible to make some money just by blogging or doing other small activities on the internet , have you ever considered doing something like that ? 
  i mean if you are feeling upset or disappointed that you are n't able to bring in any income , it looks like someone gave you gold on your comment above which is proof right there that there is money in your writing . 
   the dating pool is ridiculously shallow and made worse by the fact that openly advertising your sexuality is n't socially appropriate . 
  as a straight man living in san francisco , i assure you this is not the case everywhere . 
  holy fuck detroit is 82 % black ? 
  i 'm just halfway through college and am already seeing new babies every year on facebook , the amount seems to be growing exponentially . 
  i agree * in theory * , but i would absolutely under no circumstances want the us government bureaucracy to dictate whether or not my wife and i could conceive a child . 
  . . we did n't . 
  that 's why everyone cares now, 
  i was going to say the same thing , especially considering the comments are / r/trees related which is probably the first thing these advertising accounts would do to gain rapport * with the community . 
  edit : lays did not in fact build a stock of plays , dances , or pieces that a company or a performer knows or is prepared to perform . 
  convenience is the only concern in the us, 
  do you still use them ? 
  these are old , i thought something new had come out . 
  it 's essentially a less popular / r/funny except riddled with comments saying `` ahh guess i 'll see you in hell cuz i laughed !, 
  it would only hurt more, 
  tagged as ` wife who licks lamps '', 
  [ here you are ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/1wli9c/whats_the_biggest_secret_youre_willing_to_admit/cf3dq93 ), 
  i think the large bulk of redditor 's are in their 20s-30s if i 'm not mistaken , and no i do n't think he was trolling i think he just realized what he did was irresponsible without having had to kill someone to realize it . 
  boom !, 
  just got this stupid fucking chromoji extension 8 minutes ago thinking i 'd never use it . 
  boom !, 
  banana . 
  i kind of dislike how every time someone wants to express religious tolerance they feel like they have to preface it with , `` i 'm an atheist '' . 
  you just completely undermined yourself . 
  did you ever find your fiance 's poodle ? 
   it 's not that big a deal . 
  post was great except for this last bit . 
  it clearly * is * a big deal to op which is why he 's made a personal vow not to partake in it ; just because it is n't a big deal to you does n't mean everyone else feels that way . 
  4 grams of weed will last me a week, 
  that period confused the hell out of me . 
  would n't that be anyone using recreationally ? 
  by definition ? 
   the median reddit user is male ( 59 % ) , 25 -- 34 years of age, 
  - [ * source * ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/reddit#demographics ), 
  pfft yeah what does google know about data afterall . 
  i think it would have to be free . 
   i guess that method works for anyone with a dick . 
  why you got ta discriminate bro, 
  because it 's retarded . 
  no one is going to read this and think , `` holy shit why have i been masturbating all this time when i could have just been having sex !? '', 
  i 'm almost certain this is n't a joke . 
   it 's just sex * with a sock *, 
  ftfy, 
  speak for yourself . 
  like a sock ? 
  clever, 
  did you ? 
  was it worth it ? 
  it defiantly has , among others . 
  but for all intensive purposes people seem to mostly know what their saying on the internet . 
  basically a very satisfying rain-induced orgasm for the mushroom . 
  oh come on . 
  i 'll paypal you $ 1.37 if you can identify the people in this post . 
  nice timing , i actually just uploaded a video about 10 minutes ago haha . 
  i 've split up into two series , this new one focusing on the long-term development of a single game while i continue the other one on single topics each episode such as classes , methods , lists , etc. 
  and will make references with annotations whenever we cover one of those topics in the new game dev series .

  ** o.o **, 
  i came here to say this , it seemed like there was no game audio at all , it was awful . 
  as someone over 6 ' 5 '' , i ca n't live in a porsche . 
  i ca n't even drive in a porsche . 
  dat username, 
  i 'm not sure this is the right sub for this not that it really matters . 
  but this kind of title and event seems pretty average and not at all weird . 
  out of curiosity how long do each of these bowls typically last ? 
  i 've been finding that mine recently have been about 5-10 minutes of small / suboptimal amounts of smoke followed by ~ 30 minutes of good smoking followed by ~ 10 minutes of dying/dead smoke . 
  when i empty the bowl later all of the shisha is charred black but none is stuck to the foil , which is good since i think it means i 'm not packing it too high and searing it to the holes in the foil . 
  but i know i used to have longer-lasting bowls before i took a break and am wondering what could be wrong , unless this time window is average ? 
  thanks for the tutorial !, 
  argument makes no sense, 
  til it 's a real place . 
  why did n't you have sex with him ? 
  ** i 'm always too late . 
  i do n't think this is what the op was referencing . 
  there are scholarships that you are specifically excluded from if you are n't say black or hispanic , but no such equivalent exists for white students . 
  ** o.o **, 
  just using 2 full coco naras placed on opposite ends of the bowl . 
  every ~ 5 minutes might shift them a bit or ash them and put them back . 
  and i only ever do 1 round because . . idk the bowl is dead by that time and i imagined it was due to all the shisha being blackened / `` used '' but now that you ask me that i suppose it could conceivably just be that the coals were dying . 
  idk what does a completely and fully utilized bowl of shisha end up looking like ? 
  edit : not using tangiers, 
  oh i 'm sorry i 'm not actually using tangiers . 
  usually just al fakher , starbuzz or this one other kind of washed tobacco .
