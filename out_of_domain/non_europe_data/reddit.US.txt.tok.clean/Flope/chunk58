  the smoke shop near my place does n't sell tangiers . 
  damn !, 
  that is a crazy time difference compared to what i 'm getting . 
  and i just recently purchased an $ 80 hookah following the suggestion from someone in this sub , a km something . 
  anyways what do you think is the biggest contributing factor to this huge time difference ? 
  is it the shisha , since i 'm not using tangiers ? 
  if so what is a good second choice since the shop near me does n't carry it . 
  other than that i have 2 bowls i switch between since i 'm not sure which is better , they 're both very shallow but one is a wide standard bowl and the other is a vortex but can hold very little shisha without overflowing . 
  thanks for your help !, 
  so you think the shisha is the main contributing factor to my less-than-steller bowls ? 
  i 'm trying to pack it lightly since i read not to like push it down and condense it since you want airflow , and i 'm making sure none is higher than the rim of the bowl so it does n't get stuck to the foil . 
  do you know of any cheap online vendors for tangiers ? 
  wait . . so if it takes that long to deplete and i take a supplement of it every day does that mean i 'm od ` ing ? 
  so if i were to list my game there do you offer usd payments to publishers ? 
  like would it be possible for you to pay publishers with the exact altcoin -  usd value at the time of payment and keep the altcoin yourself ? 
  read it in math class , something about a chess board . 
  dayz has prepared me for this . 
  i thought you meant you wrote the wiki page , i would 've believed that . 
  it 's because he cheated . 
  he spends the first half of the story talking about going through grad school and working as a parking attendant , neither of which occur in a monopoly game . 
  it seems unreal that all of these complex almost-social ideas are possible with such a tiny brain .

  as it should be . 
  1 day old , welcome to reddit, 
  daaaamn . 
  this must be embarrassing for ru , i 'm really hoping they pull off a kickass opening ceremony tomorrow !, 
  though idk how i 'm going to watch it since i wo n't be available until after it 's already aired . 
  you think that 's bad ? 
  8am where i 'm at .

  i believe he is saying that many claim due to the fact that vaporizers allow the user to inhale * vapor * instead of * smoke * , that many people believe the undesired physiological effects are moot . 
  what op here is stating is that the * smoke * is not responsible for 100 % of the negative effects , and therefore the substances that * are * responsible for them are also found in * vapor * . 
  my intended use of the word was : `` of little or no practical value or meaning '' , which is the second definition found [ here ] ( http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/moot ) . 
  in this sense little or no value = = ` does n't really matter ' . 
  so when i said above people believed the adverse effects to be moot , i meant they believed they were not substantially harmful enough to warrant the same negative connotation that smoke does . 
   that 's because you 're a girl, 
  uhh . . 
  i 'm no doctor but i 'm * pretty * sure girls do n't poop . 
  do n't sweat it man 3am is only like 40 minutes away !, 
  we can swap times !, 
  i 'm offering a prime 8am friday morning viewing time . 
  wake up and start the weekend with a fresh cup of joe and the olympic 's opening ceremony . 
  enjoy watching famous athletes train their entire lives just to freeze their balls off while you recline with your morning paper .

  yeah i know , but that 's the official `` reason '' they gave for it . 
  i think it 's pretty lame to be honest . 
  there are subs like / r/picturesofdeadkids and / r/sexwithdogs and much worse and the admins always say they do n't want to get involved . 
  kind of whack to see them get all politically correct about specific subs . 
  edit : wrong sub, 
  hm , it reads like a very `` we 're trusting you . . please do n't fuck this up . . '' kind of vibe to it . 
  is it non-paid ? 
  because that would explain it . 
   spirited away, 
  as someone whose never really watched anime ( sorry if thats not really the correct term ) , is this movie any good ? 
  i recently saw 17 centimeters a second or whatever it 's called and i thought that was alright , though horrifically sad . 
  and i saw another real famous animated movie about nature vs mankind deforesting which was pretty dope , * princess mononoke . 
  edit *, 
  ah yes thanks for checking , i did n't really want to check myself but i had gotten that sub mixed up with / r/sexwithdogs . 
   princess mononoke, 
  i think that 's the one i saw ,, 
   i saw another real famous animated movie about nature vs mankind deforesting which was pretty dope . 
  i guess i 'll have to give this spirited away one a try . 
  i recognize the masked character and have seen him/her/it around a lot . 
   most people think princess mononoke is his best, 
  i think that 's the one i saw ,, 
   i saw another real famous animated movie about nature vs mankind deforesting which was pretty dope . 
  i guess i 'll have to give spirited away a shot !, 
  thanks for the suggestion !, 
  well should be something cool to put on the resume and a unique experience . 
  have fun !, 
  what are you a girl ? 
  i knew it . 
  anyone have a mirror ?

  is it still peter north ?

  everything you mentioned is completely within the realm of possibility using a laptop and some java . 
  i 'm not vouching for the op in his story , and all of the other commenters in that thread are obviously pushing the envelope for what is possible in those circumstances , but op specifically says things like `` think '' with quotes around it , i do n't think he is claiming that each of these quake ai 's have the equivalent of a human brain but instead is providing an analogy for non-computer science individuals to more easily understand . 
  and this rt life clearly shows it 's not lindsay . 
   less fans and thus less acceptance,
