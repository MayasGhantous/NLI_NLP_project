  ** hey everybody !, 
  check this guy out !, 
  dudes a total brony !, 
  what do you mean ? 
  what do you mean ? 
  i think you just wanted an excuse to say those things without being judged , you nigger chink faggot . 
  see : michael richards, 
  . . what 's going on here . . 
  was n't that a futurama episode ? 
  no , but it 's for the best . 
   it drives them crazy , but i see no reason why we could n't `` evolve '' to be able to handle that without any emotional issues . 
  well it 's very simple , really . 
  for the trait to propogate throughout the species these people would need to be more sexually successful than an average human . 
  and , going on a limb here , i 'd wager that crazy people * are n't * producing more offspring than average . 
  in addition to that , i do n't believe that having more of this information available to us carries any implicit competitive advantage . 
  if anything you 're looking at it the wrong way , our brains have evolved over millions of years to * block out * a bunch of useless information so that we could be more efficient and actually * focus * , it seems counterproductive and unlikely for it swing the other way , but hey in a few million years if i 'm wrong comment on this post . 
  how the fuck do people like this even get caught ? 
  not only could they afford to buy out the entire local police force , but even if there was a raid this guy 's house was chock fucking full of automatic weapons , did he not have anyone around that could kill the fucking investigators ? 
  for shame , i wonder where he slipped up . 
   capital punishment, 
  just so you know , ** capital punishment ** means the ** death penalty ** . 
  it is the capital , or `` highest degree '' of punishment you can hand out . 
  ** corporal punishment ** is physical consequence , punishment done to the ** corpus ** , or body . 
   a viable punishment for assault and battery, 
  is it really assault in this case ? 
  it seems like it could just be battery . 
  not for dell . 
  but the guy did n't even know it was coming , how is that a threat ? 
  i think it 's just anecdotal or implied . 
  it kind of sounds like everything worked out to be honest . 
  edit : i thought my comment was fairly innocuous , sorry for anyone i 've offended . 
  i hope op knows the downvotes your comment is getting probably are n't from people who think she is unattractive , but people who have misplaced anger over complimenting a woman on her physical beauty . 
  for anyone else wondering , op has wracked up a [ bill of about $ 1,500,000 ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/iama/comments/1xy0lb/4_years_34_surgeries_later_ama_nsfwgore_album/cffnxc9 ) . 
  will you be my lawyer ? 
  morally speaking , op said the driver slid on the ice which caused loss of control of the vehicle before it slammed into her . 
  without further info you can decide for yourself . 
  financially speaking , the responsible party 's auto insurance provider paid about $ 350,000 towards her $ 1,500,000 bill . 
  this is great , ca n't believe i 've never seen it before, 
  hm , something about this seems oddly . . unsatisfying . 
  oval office, 
  yeah i agree and disagree , there are pluses and minuses but i 'm saying that the system in place , along with the hard work and determination of the people involved produced an incredible result . 
  a lot of these expensive operations and procedures are n't available in many other countries and within such a short timeframe . 
  i do n't think i said that though . 
  and here i thought my comment was relatively innocuous !, 
  my condolences for whatever bad history you or your close ones have had with healthcare but i assure i personally am not responsible . 
  why do n't you just get up from the computer and take a breather and then rejoin us when you feel up to it . 
  yeah it seems in this case a lot of the systems in place were fighting against her . 
  luckily with the diligence of those around her the end result i think is incredible . 
  i think given the original injury the outcome must 've been incredibly lucky i agree , though i would n't say successful amputee-related operations are `` rare '' , especially in a country like the us . 
  when i commented it was at 21 upvotes , 18 downvotes . 
  it seems the tides have strengthened in your favor . 
  yeah that sucks , but what other alternative is there ? 
  in a money-driven society like the one we have in the us , someone has to pay for the operations to be done . 
  it 's either up to the respective parties ( the driver and the person getting the treatments ) , or millions of people who had never heard of either of those people . 
  the money has got to come from somewhere . 
  edit : though i should note that the prices are drastically inflated , which is shown by the fact that the hospital was willing to reduce the bill by 90 % , but this usually does n't interfere too much with the normal treatment process unless the patient is uninsured , which was the case unfortunately . 
  yeah i agree the system in the us at the moment is pretty bad , but i think that people are far exaggerating it 's poor quality relative to other developed nations , it 's something that seems to be specific to reddit . 
  i 've been in a similar position to where you are now ; i hope you have good luck moving forward . 
   reddit democracy , it works ( unless you have an unpopular opinion ) . 
  seriously i made the terrible mistake of posting just above here in a comment section about healthcare , i refreshed the page with 8 replies and have been playing catchup trying to fix my mistake haha . 
  do you want to talk about your outburst earlier ? 
  it might make you feel better . 
  i think going into a discussion about who should have voted for who in the best interest of american healthcare is just going to be embarrassing for both of us , but for funsies i 'll bite . 
  i 've only voted in one federal election , 2012 . 
  which presidential candidate should i have voted for in order to prevent `` the widespread problem '' that my attitude has caused ? 
  oh yeah , it 's quite unfortunate that op was uninsured at the time , a lot of that could have been prevented . 
   surgeons should n't have to donate their time to get their patients the help they need in the us . 
  it really depends on how you look at it . 
  i mean yes , i 'll agree the healthcare system is fucked in the us , but not much moreso than other nations that are competitive in the medical field . 
  when you bring up the surgeon from op 's story `` donating his time '' what does that really equate to ? 
  some very light googling shows that surgeons in the us on average make ~ $ 250,000 - $ 450,000 annually , with some making as much as ~ $ 640,000 . 
  compare this to surgeons in say the united kingdom which reportedly are averaging just around the $ 100,000 mark , with many earning much lower . 
  the surgeon in op 's story may be taking a pay cut in order to satisfy his moral obligations but is still operating at a substantial gain from what he would be earning in another country performing the same procedure , and in return is expected to produce remarkable results for his work . 
  i 'm saying that in this case the results of surgery that op saw were incredible given the circumstances ( and what little info we know ) and that i do n't think the success of the procedures is completely unrelated to the elevated costs of care . 
  not to mention op 's situation was severely exacerbated by the fact that she was completely uninsured when injured , which clearly is n't always the case . 
  i 'm on mobile so hopefully this all makes sense , what do you think ? 
   you should n't be downvoted so thoroughly, 
  thanks i 'm inclined to agree , but it appears i 've struck a nerve with some people . 
   the system that let 's down 9/10 people in op 's situation, 
  i do n't think that 's the case though , i think that in the us specifically there is a remarkably high success rate for amputee-related surgeries . 
  that 's not an alternative though , that 's one of the two examples i put in my post . 
  an alternative would be something like a society that relied on direct trade instead of a financial system built around something like the dollar . 
  seriously i ca n't tell if everyone is being sarcastic , mchale was absolutely terrible on the vgas . 
  i ca n't blame him entirely because whoever was in charge of finding a host really fucked up big time , mchale was n't even familiar with the industry he was hosting awards for , altogether a terrible production . 
  fair enough . 
  yeah it 's quite the predicament we 're in . 
  i 'm by no means qualified to speak on the nation 's healthcare system but in my opinion it all comes down to the shady tactics being used by hospitals and health insurance companies alike to boost costs . 
  in fact a similar issue can be seen with universities in the united states . 
  if you look at the history of tuition costs they have been steadily rising by an outrageous margin over the past several decades . 
  this is only possible due to the substantial amount of financial aid that the government is now offering students to attend school . 
  schools know that if the average student is eligible for x thousand dollars of student loans than they can charge y tuition , and in return x and y are on a never-ending upward trend . 
  this makes school tuition increasingly out of reach for those who are ineligible for student loans ( or to draw a parallel , ineligible for health insurance ) effectively forcing people to go through this broken `` band aid '' system ( student loans / insurance companies ) as you put it to acquire results . 
  fun stuff . 
  / r/forwardsfromgrandma, 
   nurses and doctors are paid very well in europe, 
  i 'm not familiar with all of europe but i do have some info on the uk if that 's any indicator . 
  not that this really undermines the main point about us healthcare but from what i 've read online the median annual pay for surgeons in the uk is ~ $ 100,000 , with many making much less than that . 
  in the us surgeons are making an average of $ 250,000 - $ 450,000 , with some meaking ~ $ 640,000 per year . 
  so if the uk is any indicator for other countries in europe or with similar healthcare systems , no the surgeons are not paid on par with us surgeons . 
  i would n't be surprised if they decided to never show them making that or behind the wall , since during it 's unveiling there were a lot of comments in the video about how the audience found ryan 's redstone prowess `` cringeworthy '' or that he was n't good and was doing it inefficiently .
