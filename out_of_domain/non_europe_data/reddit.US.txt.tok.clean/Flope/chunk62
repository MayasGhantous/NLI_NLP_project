   michael barely screamed, 
  thank the lord, 
   not smoking another cigarette for over a day and a half . 
  would 've been a good time to quit !, 
   it 's better than doing hard drugs though . 
  it 's from the dictator, 
  which part do you not understand ? 
  maybe i can explain it to you . 
  english dictionaries also offer more than one definition , it 's just these complaining fuckers are picking the one that suits their argument . 
  [ ** miracle : ** an extremely outstanding or unusual event , thing , or accomplishment . 
  ] ( http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/miracle ), 
  it 's almost like words can have more than one meaning . 
  would you feel bad if op was telling the truth though ? 
  for all intensive purposes i can still understand what you 're trying to say though . 
  this is a great tip for all you teenagers out there !, 
  ^ ^ ^ dont ^ ^ ^ actually ^ ^ ^ do ^ ^ ^ that, 
  yeah that 's pretty wiggity whack , but i have n't read all of these super long posts . 
  whats this from ? 
   where do you think the word ` miracle ' came from , genius ? 
   if we 're defining it to mean any extremely unlikely event, 
  implying `` we 're '' defining it and not [ websters dictionary ] ( http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/miracle ) . 
   then holy shit , miracles happen every day all over the place ,, 
  well yeah , 7 * billion * people all living their own life with their own loved ones and experiences , i 'm sure a lot of things that are rare to * you * lose quite a bit of mystique when spread across 7 billion people 's lives . 
  maybe you dropped your glass and then caught it in mid air before it spilled , that 's pretty cool and not common , but that does n't mean at least 200 million other people did n't also do that today . 
   which kinda cheapens the word , does n't it ? 
  again i 'm not sure how to explain this . 
  most words carry the weight or rarity of something happening within one 's own life . 
  even if you feel it `` cheapens '' the word it 's not like you and i are in the committee deciding which words mean what . 
   and for the record , i typed ` miracle definition ' into google and that was the one definition that popped up . 
  not exactly cherry-picking . 
  fair . 
  i think you 're defiantly missing the point . 
  what sub money ? 
  i do n't understand the issue , it seems like there is nothing in the way of that valley but they ca n't seem to move through it . 
  taking into account thousands of conflicting commands it still looks like they 're running into an invisible wall at that point . 
  watching the stream now and i 'm starting to have my doubts . 
  dennis got off easy . 
  dude this shit is sweet i didnt know this was a sport . 
  if this is womens quarter finals where are the men at , also quarter finals ? 
  hooray gulini !, 
  ha where the fuck did she come from , chick in 3rd mustve wiped out and cbc did n't show it, 
  ah i see , thanks !, 
  ** noooooooooooooooo **, 
  can you link me to their stream ? 
  i 've been watching canada and i 'd be interested to see which one i enjoy more, 
  i fail to see how the ideas are exclusive . 
  still seems too close . 
  also a serious question , what do you mean how could something like that happen ? 
  i did n't watch the video but the gif you linked is a skier landing a solid backflip , what 's the issue ? 
  would n't that fast and furious guy be more relevant ? 
  as someone else who ca n't * art * , i feel your pain . 
  are your daughters single ? 
  do they like guys who paint waves on closet doors ? 
  a true reddit love story in the making . 
  this does n't make any sense to me , could you explain it further ? 
  i think you 've mixed up your rights and lefts somewhere through your comment and it 's really fucking with my brain . 
  what was this made in ? 
  someone said you need xna but this looks written in c++ in msvs , did you use sfml or another library ? 
  [ oh please , when has time warner cable ever made a terrible merger ? 
  ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/11/business/media/11merger.html?pagewanted=all ), 
  makes sense , thanks for the input !, 
  i 'm surprised there 's no easy standard for online contracts yet , someone should get on that , i 'll take 0.01 % of the profits for coming up with the idea so i can retire early . 
  hooray i did n't miss it !, 
   an smooth, 
  they dont know more than we do, 
  oh god for anyone watching cbc . . that kid, 
  hahaha i just saw the camera get zipped up from inside the bag , that ca n't be good news, 
   in sales last year, 
  lol, 
  how do you think it checks to make sure the sound matches the one stored ? 
  lol @ the guy wearing sunglasses, 
  cancelled, 
  very slow . 
  so be into that kinda thing, 
  you really think he 's the best actor on the show ? 
  dear lord, 
  i sent an e-mail to a rep at young-america . com explaining the situation and gave them my info , they were able to verify which auction i won and said it was being processed . 
  not sure if it made a difference on the eta though . 
  edit - when did you win ? 
  google `` slick deals every2minutes '', 
  they have a long thread thats been going since the contest started , in there you will find an e-mail address of a rep from young-america . 
  that 's all i know . 
  we really should have a committee to watch out for stuff like this , good job reddit . 
  no problem , what 's the number you called i never saw a phone number . 
  i 'm doing okay so far, 
  out of curiosity , what do you think people are misunderstanding about this ? 
  i think you 're reaching a bit here . 
  that 's great !, 
  so every employed female just needs to encact the `` buddy system '' !, 
  whenever they want a promotion or raise , just ask your designated buddy to talk to your boss for you !, 
  they won, 
  ohhhh shit, 
  no sound on cbc ? 
  source ? 
  if that were truly the case , then take solace in the fact that it will probably be greatly improved within just 4-5 years , but i remain unconvinced that this is an issue so widespread that it accounts for any statistical representation in a `` wage gap '' . 
  you 're living my dream , what did it taste like ? 
  nope , strictly anecdotal, 
  incorrect, 
  thats all reddit is , does it really need a subreddit ? 
  as someone who has been very low income , fast food is most definitely cheap and i have no clue what people are thinking when they talk about it like an expensive `` luxury '' when you 're low income .
