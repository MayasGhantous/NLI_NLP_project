  oh my god . . source ? 
  why ? 
  his point was retarded . 
  you ca n't link a sexual fetish to a person 's character traits or ideologies . 
   `` what 's her name ? '', 
  `` fuck meat , cum dump , dirty skank . 
  take your pick . '', 
   they 'd fit right in at trp . 
  i 'm not subbed to / r/theredpill but i decided to look at it since people are saying it 's so bad . 
  i see absolutely nothing even comparing to an exchange like this on here , it 's good to know reddit has chosen unbased hyperbole yet again . 
  who calls them buttons ? 
  are you my grandma ? 
  obviously students . 
  fortunately no , this is just a bit of reddit hyperbole mixed with the anti-american healthcare circlejerk . 
  however it would be quite expensive if all three of the following were true :, 
  - he was uninsured ( rare for college students ), 
  - he called an ambulance ( expensive ), 
  - he needed medical services beyond just diagnostics , like a procedure ( probably not necessary for not feeling full after eating ), 
  thank the lord , i do n't want taxmoney going to stupid shits who think they 're dying because they could handle an 8th taco . 
  well i mean , truancy is illegal so i could see his line of reasoning that the police would be able to help in that situation . 
  i mean if they were to really enforce the law would they just stand at the guy 's front door and continually write him citations for his child not going to school until she finally gets in the car ? 
  what could the father really do if his daughter absolutely 100 % refused to leave her room and the door was locked ? 
  break down the door , grab her by the wrist and drag her out of the house ? 
  she 'd get taken away by cps, 
  that really changes the whole meaning of that call . 
  ... do n't you think if she was calling a raccoon a bear it would then logically follow that she also had not seen a bear before ? 
  no no no ** no ** . 
  not good point , * you * were right , why the fuck would she think a raccoon in her front yard was a bear if she had ever seen * either * animal ? 
  stand your ground , especially given your expertise thereisbearcum . 
  so what happens after these calls , i was under the impression you could be fined for an inappropriate use of emergency services , do you like write down the information of these people when they call and then send them citations ? 
  it is if you 're not in america . 
  dude must have some stellar insurance . 
  are you an owl ? 
   some people actually think arriving in an ambulance will get them attention faster in the er . 
  it most certainly does . 
  glad you got the joke :p, 
  weird sub for this but funny picture . 
  not sure if genuine or not , but i 'd hope if a group of people had the courage to start that others would join . 
   warning me that using dildos would stretch out my vagina, 
  is n't this accurate , though ? 
  right , and from what i understand things are a lot looser down there after giving birth , correct ? 
  completely ridiculous reasoning . 
  i do n't understand . 
  if you arrive via ambulance you skip the waiting room and are put into an actual room immediately upon arrival , how can you think that is n't faster ? 
  is it fun ? 
  should i try it ? 
  i 'm ron burgundy ? 
  my high school principal 's name was mr. gooch . 
  i take it they do n't generally bite people ? 
  ** top comment on youtube , good jahb !, 
  so like , would a kangaroo be able to beat the shit out of an adult human ? 
  like the thing looks ripped and i bet it 's kick is a fucking nightmare , but something still tells me my giant brain and opposable thumbs could somehow beat this thing . 
   crooked , and i had braces but then i became homeless when i was young so they removed them far too early, 
  are you me ? 
  your easy viewing does n't work with res , so it 's not so easy unfortunately . 
  that sounds terrifying . 
  i kind of wish i grew up somewhere where giant spiders were an average annoyance though , maybe i would n't be such a pussy now as an adult when little 1/2 inch spiders skitter around my room . 
  i do n't see any citations either . 
  edit : downvotes ? 
  sounds like it could be an arrhythmia , you should be looked at . 
  i think i understand, 
  haha, 
  i was reading these comments saying , `` these idiots think it 's a bat ? 
  it 's obviously a puppy . '', 
  ^ ^ im ^ ^ ^ retarded, 
  where 's that ? 
  i thought it was funny, 
  then it 's even worse than i thought . 
  at first it glance i assumed it may have been something as benign as premature ventricular contractions , however skipped beats may eventually lead to something more sinister or become indicative of a predisposition for supraventricular tachycardia . 
  god how could i have missed this !, 
  it was right after they peacefully granted the us independence . 
  clearly someone who has never been to china . 
  you have no idea what the fuck you are talking about , maybe i would n't be able to message you on google + , a social network invented in america , but how about you fucking sign up for sina weibo and message me . 
  good luck , mate . 
  it 's almost like different countries will sometimes use their own products , go to their own websites and be different . 
  the chinese are n't pining over their inability to access twitter when they have access to ozone , renren or any of their other social networking sites . 
  * facepalm *, 
  are you a fucking cartoon character ? 
  if they 've done it in the past with success they 'll do it in the future and they 're doing it right now . 
  if you are actually interested you should do some more research on the subject , it 's pretty interesting . 
  it 's a little more involved than china `` threatening the us '' simply because they do n't like what 's going on , that would be retarded and there are more factors at play . 
  yeah last i heard they were barely profitable . 
  edit : though with all of these conan ads on / r/funny lately who knows . 
  families that stay together , get bombed together . 
  oh well yeah if you 're in a country with uch it will undoubtedly be cheaper than in the us . 
  that boat story is crazy though , even crazier they were able to reattach it !, 
  just had a flashback to my last philosophy class . 
  real interesting line of thought there , well written too . 
  i think if anything we 've culturally progressed to the point that we can objectively say there is no sexual `` norm '' . 
  since that 's the case than homosexuality and vitro fertilisation ca n't be viewed as exceptions but rather as alternative routes to the satisfaction of biological desires such as sexual urges or raising offspring . 
  op is technically correct , though i do enjoy how narrow of a margin it is . 
   websites like twitter are actually illegal . 
  no , as i 've just said they are n't actually . 
  * twitter * may be inaccessible without a vpn , but there are numerous websites * like * twitter . 
  which should make you ask , why is twitter truly inaccessible ? 
  ` out of the triplets we saved , one of which died in 2011 , only 2 are still under our care . ', 
  it 's combined with another sentence saying something about how the other animals they own are all ` rescued ' . 
  if you think that 's a racist joke i think you 've misunderstood . 
   if they 've done it in the past ** with success **, 
   germans orchestrated the mass killing of jews in the past,
