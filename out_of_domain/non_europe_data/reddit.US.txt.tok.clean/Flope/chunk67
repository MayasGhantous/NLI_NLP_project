  it 's a lot more gray than that and simply justifying some nation 's actions as such a simple , `` oh north korea is just retarded '' and the like is ridiculous . 
  interpolate !, 
  intolerable !, 
  ^ intense . 
  why do you say that ? 
  thanks !, 
  could n't easily search the page on my phone , i 'll take my 17 downvotes like a man . 
  there may be some exceptions to the rule , but i do n't think your view on the mongols is necessarily how history was written as much as it is a dumb trope like how on tv fathers are lazy and stupid while women are annoying and stressed . 
  * very * light research , like just a cursory google search , will reveal many of the mongol 's great achievements . 
  iirc under genghis kahn they were the first to create a rigid military training `` boot camp '' system , the first to use paper currency and the first to create a federal mail service , among other great feats . 
  wow that 's interesting , thanks for the link !, 
  one of the top posts on / r/changemyview is someone who says the confederate flag is the equivalent of waving the nazi emblem . 
  if you try to post anywhere on reddit that you are a supporter of what the confederate states stood for , you 're gon na have a bad time . 
  they 're regarded as slaving brutes and that 's all . 
   people generally view them as hostile invaders, 
  in this specific case it 's unique since the mongols were quite proud of their military strength and made no attempts to hide their power . 
  they were far far * far * ahead of anyone else in the world at that time and it was n't something that goes unnoticed . 
  who is making it up ? 
  are you saying the south now a hundred years later is making it up to save face ? 
  and i do n't believe the idea of fighting for slavery and state 's rights are at all mutually exclusive in this case . 
  for me it 's just sweat i think , and it ends up looking disgusting . 
  as well as my keyboard , no idea how to clean it properly because i do n't want clorox or whatever to seep under the mousewheel or the keyboard keys . 
  that must be why writers hate photographers . 
  ** nope ca n't read unless its size 64 impact font sorry **, 
   seriously , who watches this video and says ** i need to comment about how many likes or dislikes it has **, 
  ftfy, 
  not sure if serious . 
  maybe i just go to a shitty university with low standards , but my programming i did in high school put me years ahead of my peers . 
   listen to old people, 
  nice try !, 
  are you my autocorrect ? 
  last question makes no sense, 
  i really do n't think that 's what it is . 
  i feel like i would know if my hand was coated in semen when using the computer . 
  i disagree, 
   if you think age of consent laws are about biology, 
  i think he 's explicitly saying that they are n't . 
  this is the shittiest comment i 've ever read on this site for multiple reasons . 
   source : i was 15 once . 
  ama ? 
  got any resources on how to easily/cheaply set this kind of thing up and not just get gross liquid at the end ? 
  do i need a permit ? 
  title was definitely misleading and a let-down when you finished reading it . 
  if you came up to me this morning and said , `` hey bryan you know if you post leeroy jenkins on reddit you will get 2,000 upvotes in under 4 hours '' i would have called you crazy . 
  you ** ' ** r ** e ** commenting on an internet forum in a thread about a world of warcraft video, 
  fuck the haters, 
  having calculus be a pre-req for beginner-intermediate level computer science classes is the most retarded thing and i never understood it . 
  oh wow i usually use that word correctly too , thanks for letting me know !, 
  your a real hero, 
   when we 've been in foreplay mode for 30 seconds and he 's already preparing for piv . 
  i know you 're ready , but i still have to get the juices flowing over here , guy !, 
  serious question from someone in college . 
  maybe i 've been selfish , but if i 'm at like a house party or something and a girl takes me to a bedroom to do the deed , probably a one night stand , should i really be spending 10 - 20 minutes with just foreplay ? 
  i mean at some point women have got to understand that i do n't really want to spend all night * preparing * to do something, 
  edit : why is askwomen so intolerant of questions ? 
  yeah but given the specific circumstances i mean what ever happened to the idea of a `` quickie '' ? 
  is it unreasonable to suggest that spending that long serenading someone when any minute someone could be knocking on the door to come in is kind of ridiculous ? 
   a woman , one night stand or not , is still a person , and not `` something '' to be done . 
  i mean i obviously meant that the `` sex '' was the thing not the woman lol . 
  i just find it hard to believe if someone is dragging me through a crowded hallway full of people into a bedroom and we could be interrupted any minute that they 'd be expecting a big amount of prep time . 
  but to each their own i guess . 
   does that mean you do n't believe someone should initiate sex in that environment if they need twenty minutes of foreplay ? 
  that 's how i feel personally yeah . 
  in an environment where you can be easily interrupted at any minute and then the show is over , i rather just skip the whole event than get all hot and bothered for no finish . 
  if someone is * really * unable to do the deed within a relatively short amount of time then it might be more appropriate for them to find a different setting to approach people for it in or to invite someone back to their place . 
   why are you shooting for okay sex , flope ? 
  i 've got a reputation to uphold, 
  i do n't think you 're quite understand what i 'm saying , but i did n't mean to upset you . 
  to each their own . 
  that 's a good point, 
  for context the guy they shot was a bandit who killed someone not long before this gif : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h5xt6w6rqw, 
  like another user said reddit enhancement suite is great , but if you do n't have that just get adblock , i actually was n't even aware gifycat had ads , sorry !, 
  thanks for your input , that makes sense, 
  it was a noble attempt, 
  eatsmeat is stupid cis scum , probably a white male that fucking devil, 
  if it makes you feel better the poster above is likely mistaken . 
  it is much easier for the word ` bights ' to come about from spelling * blights * incorrectly , not * bites * . 
  ** tl ; dr : blights not bites **, 
  incorrect i believe, 
  well in a lot of places it is n't actually illegal for women to be completely topless . 
  in fact the city i live in both men and women can be completely nude in public as long as there is no `` sexual intention '' . 
  one of many definitions, 
  i can see there is no winning with you , maybe it 's that time of the month or something but i concede . 
  you are right and i am wrong . 
  oh so i need to bring my own gun , that answers my question . 
  thanks !, 
  and good luck with being fertile !, 
  i 'm not sure how everyone does it but i 'm subscribed to the guys who made [ this video ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h5xt6w6rqw ) which i got the gif from . 
  pretty sure they are just both recording their screen while they play and then they edit it together later . 
  '' * to my dearest sirs , i am flope from the internet , perhaps you have heard of me . . * '', 
  ** to kickstarter !!, 
  haha , solid timing, 
  `` i mean i guess i would n't throw it out if i got one . . '', 
  [ reminded me of this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0f9b_o3ubk ), 
  well , i 'm pretty sure the us has a huge interest in russia not annexing another country . 
  this is interesting, 
   there are exceptions, 
  like wut, 
  i 'm living on the west coast as well , in probably the # 1 area to be targeted based on condensed population , infrastructure and military presence , but to be honest if we go to * actual * war with russia it does n't really matter where you are , the world is fucked . 
  hundreds of millions of deaths at the hands of ~ 100 nuclear payload operators on either side .
