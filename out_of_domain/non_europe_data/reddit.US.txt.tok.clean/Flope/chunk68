  reddit : `` oh my gosh you guys someone needs to send troops into ukraine people are dying !! '', 
  * russia sends troops to ukraine *, 
  reddit : `` oh my god russia is attacking !!!! '', 
  it was due to military allies backing out and not vowing to defend and aid the us , nothing to do with the people 's opinion on the matter . 
   the sole purpose of un is to prevent the superpowers from getting into a world-annihilating open war by providing a diplomatic channel for making deals & compromises ( read : screwing lesser countries ), 
   no , it 's done a great job of letting the 5 big powers bully the smaller ones . 
   58 % or something of crimea is ethnically russian , but not all ethnic russians want to be a part of russia, 
  likewise , i 'm sure a large amount of people who are not ethnically russian wish to be a part of russia, 
  us interests . 
  whether it be oil , alliances with the new power of a destabilized region , etc. 
   the us is not a world police . 
  are you living under a rock ? 
  not getting to be ` murican, 
  `` most americans do n't keep up on politics or really understand what presidential candidates stand for '', 
  i think [ the whole episode ] ( http://www.southparkstudios.com/full-episodes/s15e14-the-poor-kid ) is pretty funny as long as you are n't generally opposed to south park 's humor , you should check it out sometime . 
  yeah i 'm right in san francisco , i remember back not too long ago when everyone was worrying about how liberal estimates for north korea 's inter-continental missiles put them just in range of the bay . 
  now we 're worrying about russia haha . 
  i 'm by no means a political analyst or military expert , but i 'd say the chance of massive nuclear payloads is extremely low as it theoretically guarantees the `` mutually assured destruction '' of both nations . 
  i say theoretically because it has never happened before , and it is n't completely outside the realm of possibility that after one nation nukes another , the receiving nation may just wish to take their lumps and try and settle the conflict without returning nuclear warfare , which would 100 % change the earth as we know it , for all nations . 
  personally i do n't think the us will do anything to risk a war with russia , nuclear or otherwise , over something as insignificant to the american public as ukraine ( sorry ! ) . 
  most americans could not point to ukraine on a map , i guarantee none of our military is sitting on the edge of their seats excited about the prospect of going to war against russia in the honor of some small war-torn region . 
  unfortunately what this means is if the us * does n't * react we are basically saying to russia , `` hey man we are afraid of standing against you so you pretty much have free reign to do what you want over there , we will stay in our corner do n't bother us . '', 
  interesting stuff . 
  neither of those are the correct spelling . 
  / r/mildlyinteresting, 
  did you see this on facebook ? 
  can confirm , ambien is much fun . 
  took some at a new year 's party few years back . 
  fell off a wall and sprained by ankle , did n't realize until the next day . 
  yeah i think they said it was `` flope '' . 
  what did they win ? 
  i assume that is some sort of intangible congratulatory gesture and not an actual thumb that they could sell ? 
  ever since i saw olympus has fallen where the anti-air turrets spring up from underground i 've wondered what kind of tech we actually have to protect the homeland from stuff like ground invasion , air invasion , inter-continental missiles , etc. 
  i can imagine where i live some type of mortar anti-air defense springing up along the coast since this area had huge aa defenses back in wwii and cold war . 
  yeah with the guy whose like liam neeson, 
  edit : gerard butler !, 
  diana tom, 
  how long ago was that if you do n't mind me asking ? 
  as someone who went through a course of it and had a couple close friends do it as well , it is made abundantly clear to you that it is a * last resort * by every derm i 've seen . 
  not sure how they handled it when/where you got it but for my friends and i you had mandatory monthly blood tests , and they would withhold medication until the results were in , women have mandatory monthly pregnancy tests as that is really the biggest fear is birth defects while on it , or suicide . 
  but yeah i agree , it worked for me and my friends fine . 
  that 's sad, 
  oh yeah i had n't even considered hawaii , just the mainland . 
  i 'm not sure san diego would be a better target tactically than sf . 
  san francisco is the second most densely populated city in the us , civilian casualties would be enormous which would cripple morale and not to mention the devastation that could be wreaked on the tech industry . 
  you 've got google , apple , reddit ( oh no !, 
  ) , twitter and a bunch of other important corporate giants within like a 15 mile radius . 
  pendleton i imagine would be a different kind of target , less long-term economic and social damage but more short-term military advantage due to all the snazzy shit we got stored away there . 
  just my two pennies . 
  got pretty lucky with that dude sticking his dumb face out through all those trees , solid headshot, 
  `` that jesse , could never quite spell 420 correctly . . '', 
  how many death gifs do you think you 've seen on this site over 7 years ? 
   if he 's not using a condom , it is less likely for her to get pregnant if you stop it before he comes inside her . 
  source ? 
  that 's stupid because the businessman went in the morning , the night watchman works at night, 
  not necessarily true, 
  that is ** the ** last place i would want to be during a zombie oubreak . 
   i know a paraplegic guy that lives in the middle of bumfuck nowhere that makes some damn good apple pie moonshine . 
  most southern thing i 've ever heard . 
  so i just happen to live in the area . . is that lumberjack dude selling ? 
  i was thinking while watching the scene that i would never eat a snake ( you know when the apocalypse happens ) because i 'd probably end up ingesting like fucking rattle snake venom and that is how i would die . 
  if i just cut off like the top 20 % of the snake does that mean there 's no venom in the rest of it 's body ? 
  interesting , thanks !, 
  that 's kind of creepy . 
  would n't that imply that when sleeping it is n't only able to listen for the phrase `` xbox on '' but actually recognizes it 's name `` xbox '' followed by the word `` on '' ? 
  this ca n't possibly be from the xbox dvr , how did you get the quality so crisp ? 
  are you using a capture card ? 
  did you use a capture card for this ? 
  quality looks too good for game dvr, 
  i doubt it, 
  yeah , i got it thanks . 
  i 'm saying i do n't think many people find the taste of ballsack pleasant regardless of sexuality . 
  lol did you just downvote me ? 
  go fuck yourself guy, 
  fuck this makes me certain that no one should do an ama if they do n't hold beliefs that a large majority of redditors do . 
  this whole thing is n't even about asking the guy questions people are just posting snarky jokes and trying to be funny and putting the guy down , it 's embarrassing . 
  all of the top replies are saying `` worst ama ever '' and `` op answered 0-1 questions '' and hidden below them are * actual * questions with * actual * answers . 
  disappointed , reddit . 
  i 've been meaning to read that . 
  recommend it ? 
  wow people are reacting pretty extremely to this .

  hey guy what happened to the podcast ? 
  i had a good 2 -3 more minutes of time to devote and y' all just had to get hit by lightning or something . 
  where do you work ? 
  she 's kinda hot . 
  i think that 's what he 's saying, 
  i do n't want this to come off the wrong way , but am i the only one who was actually surprised at how small that is after hearing it 's one of the largest ratios ? 
  i mean that only looks marginally bigger than the dick on some humans . 
   this bat could be a baby dick in its species . 
  ** #truth **, 
  honestly i 'd say a much larger determining factor on life ` success ' is the wealth of the family you are born into , not your sex or race . 
  this is obviously different than say 50 -  years ago . 
  very well written , from what i 've read so far . 
  i 've saved it so i can finish reading when i have more time . 
  pretty sure peripherals = mouse , keyboard , monitor etc. 
  / r/popping, 
  was that really necessary ? 
  jealous of your job ; if you do n't mind me asking how did you get involved in the industry ? 
  did you get a cs degree first ?
