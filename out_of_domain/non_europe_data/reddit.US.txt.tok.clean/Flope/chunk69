   oh you very much can disagree on an opinion . 
  i disagree . 
  i hate all of these fucking qualifiers like `` i 'm even an * atheist * and the guy is still pretty neat !, 
  can you believe it ! '', 
  as if the norm for atheists is just to hate any religious figure . 
  thank you !, 
  i 'm in ca and do n't have it yet either . 
  i 've already tried completely unplugging the system and plugging it back in but to no avail . 
  yeah mobile is definitely going to be big for a while , i 'm real good with java but ca n't for the life of me figure out libgdx which is supposed to make it runnable on android . 
  oh well just need to keep learning i suppose , thanks for the advice !, 
  holy shit they 're really that expensive ? 
  it 's because one of you does n't have the newest update , i had the same issue with my buddy . 
  still no update . 
  this is n't true , just so people are aware . 
  the update simple has n't been available for certain people yet, 
  that 's crazy !, 
  apparently also if you find out he is n't . 
  yeah it is . 
  as someone who has switched majors twice now , maybe i 'll see you there !, 
  backpack , band-aid ... 
   most people know about it though so i dunno . 
  i really do n't think so . 
  maybe most americans on reddit . 
  ha i do the same thing . 
  funny watching drunk people try and do the math, 
  there goes gravity !, 
  the term rape should probably take precedence though . 
  if a white guy raped a black woman you would n't call it `` interracial sex '' . 
  like i said , maybe on reddit it is , but where else would this be widely known ? 
  it 's not like americans are inundated with british media , and and that media is constantly using the word ` arse ' . 
  anyone else find it a little off-putting when they make a big deal about how `` we 'll know when they have a sponsor '' and product placements are `` disingenous '' when they just made [ a car commercial disguised as a short a few months back ?

  edit : this is in the video description : * the new 2014 scion tc is featured in this short . 
  check out the 2014 scion tc now at : http://www.scion.com/cars/tc/ vehicle shown with optional equipment . 
   ha , no . 
  i 'm sorry but could you elaborate ? 
  i 'm not sure what exactly you are disagreeing with . 
  so i see , i just did that thanks for the heads up !, 
  yep that 's another clear example . 
  which i mean this kind of stuff is fine and even if i did n't think it was fine i mean who the fuck am i ? 
  but it is kind of lame for them to clearly speak to the audience on a podcast denouncing the kind of stuff they themselves do . 
  what are you a fairly odd parent, 
  i think if you listened to the most recent episode of the patch and the language they used to denounce this kind of thing you would find it extremely hypocritical and condescending to the audience , it comes off like they think they 've fooled us with this car commercial , coca cola sponsorship in another short and other examples . 
  care to elaborate ? 
  what specifically do you think i am incorrect about ? 
  i 'm not sure how that ties into extrapolating data , but i think if you listen to the language they use when describing their sponsors in this episode of the patch it should be clear that they are denouncing this exact type of sponsorship . 
  anyways i 'm not like attacking rt , i mean if they want to make some cash from sponsors have at it , it 's obviously how they fund their shorts , but it 's kind of weird to state that they do n't like that kind of thing when talking on their podcast . 
  yeah i definitely understand that this must be how they fund their shorts , and i 'm just some random douche on the internet i 'm not trying to like attack rt over their philosophy on sponsorship , but i think given the specific language they used on this podcast talking about how they do n't like/approve of that kind of financial advertising seems kind of almost like they think they 've pulled some great trick with some of these shorts , specifically the car commercial and coke sponsorship . 
  i guess that 's just a difference of opinion then . 
  for me it really felt * just * like a commercial and that they were using their celebrity to sell a product , which again is totally their right . 
  but the very first 15 seconds of the short is different wide-angle shots of this sleek new car and then chris coming out and mentioning it by name . 
  when he moves in the entire sequence of all his stuff in it is an obvious ploy to show `` wow !, 
  look how much space this car has ! '' . 
  i could n't get over it , but i guess if other people do n't see a problem then i 'm just some cynical asshat . 
  that guy above you is infringing !, 
  nah , who wants to stop walking and stare at a billboard covered in a bunch of stats ? 
  it 's better to have hard punch-in-the-face messages so that even if people just glance at it for a second they know , `` okay , shit food = shit health , got it '' as they continue about their day . 
  do you feel the same way about anti-smoking ads ? 
   the guys are generally going to be way-testosteroned-up . 
  that is going to make them potentially more violent . 
  this is going to increase the risk those women would take in having sex with these men . 
  that 's just a fact , really . 
  pretty sure i 've read somewhere that the link between testosterone and violent behavior is just a myth . 
  no source because i 'm lazy , though if you care enough to try and dispute my claim i 'll go dig one up . 
   6 ) the reason most soldiers are discouraged from sex with someone other than their so is because soldiers are expected to behave professionally and responsibly at all times . 
  i do n't see how having sex outside of a long-term relationship is unprofessional , but i suppose i 'm just being a stickler . 
  this makes 0 sense to me . 
  so if you see two identical toys on the shelf and one is pink and one is say blue/red . 
  how is your daughter not getting the choice someone 's son is getting by choosing if they rather get the pink or blue/red toy ? 
  is the blue/red version shaped in a way that female hands ca n't grasp it ? 
  edit : a lot of people are saying children do n't get to pick their own toys and adult 's preconceptions about gendered ideals is what the issue is . 
  do n't ^ feed ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ trolls, 
   there is absolutely no reliable evidence that testosterone causes ``' roid rage '' or any type of violent , aggressive or uncontrollable behavior . 
  no violence , aggression or unpredictable behavior has been seen in studies where men were administered testosterone , even at extremely high doses . 
  in fact , the opposite appears to be true ; many men with low t describe being more irritable , or having a short fuse , and this often improves with normalization of testosterone levels . 
  source is negligible so not worth mentioning , though i thought given what you just said it was interesting to see that this viewpoint also exists out there on the web . 
  google ` testosterone violence myth ' , it was an article on www.askmen.com - well written but did n't provide any scholarly sources from what i saw .

   you may get a better response if you post a portfolio of completed games that clearly demonstrate how you contributed to the project . 
  you 're telling me !, 
   throwing in keywords and telling us how knowledgeable you are with programming does n't mean a lot unless you already have the paid industry experience . 
  thanks !, 
  with any luck i 'll have some of that industry experience i 've been hearing all about once some great studio head or recruiter gazes upon my gorgeous post . 
  have n't heard of digipen , but what are you really trying to say here . . 
  sweet i had way more evidence than i had previously thought . 
  i was totally underselling myself there . 
  well there goes that . 
  makes sense , as i said in the post i do n't really have any completed games i could show , though i think the blogging / published papers idea is swell . 
  thanks for the hot tips . 
  i know this is n't an ama but i have a question for you : what is your go-to signal for when there is immediate danger ? 
  like say i 'm talking to you and and not looking where i 'm walking and there is a cliff in front of me , what kind of motions would you make to be like `` bryan stop oh my god ! '', 
  it 's probably her mothers or someone close to her i would bet, 
   because of how slow it is communicating with other people who do n't use sign language , it gets bothersome sometimes . 
  i feel like i would always sign rude/mean things right at people when i got mad and they would never know . 
  that would be very satisfying for me .
