  thanks to anyone who can help , and for those who happen upon this thread in the future i will post here and update with what i 've learned/the solution . 
  well fuck me , i read the posting guidelines to look for that , did n't see the rules further down . 
  wish there was a way to edit my title . 
  but since you 've replied , do you know of any good resources that could help me with this ? 
  thanks !, 
  incompetence, 
  they do n't think it be like it is but it do, 
  just admit it bro, 
  why are you even in this thread ? 
  huge spoiler ? 
  who are ` the hunters ' ? 
   writing was above-average, 
  well , i mean is n't talking about stuff that 's in the comics the point of the comic spoiler tag ? 
   i love the comics , but i 'm still in the `` if daryl dies , we riot '' camp . 
  he pretty much said daryl dies in the comics , how is that a prediction and not a spoiler ? 
  make a comment with negative karma . 
  guaranteed . 
  totally got david and james cameron mixed up there . 
  \\ #til, 
  edit : can confirm, 
  watched the first 10 minutes of this movie and it put me to sleep , never went back . 
  but apparently everyone loves it . 
  everyone is saying that she 's having sex with another woman on stage for other 's amusement to get money and that 's what makes it sad . . 
  i mean . . 
  i ca n't imagine she would be doing it for a reason other than money . 
  i thought the image was of her daughter at first . 
   i imagine the comment op being the awkward, 
  can not possibly continue this sentence . . 
  unless you get a retina display , what does mac do to target graphic designers ? 
  the industry standard software is adobe products which are available on pc as well . 
  okay but so what ? 
  if i told people i lived at \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 and am a \u2588 \u2588 year old \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 what does that do ? 
  unless there are people who are already trying to murder me i do n't understand why people would be fearful of being identified online . 
  i 've always wondered this . 
  edit : feel free to read below for additional info . 
  hm , i 'll have to look into that after i finish reading * house of leaves * . 
  thanks for the suggestion !, 
  pe is definitely not $ 2.95 anywhere . 
  unless op is just ordering a soda and a fortune cookie . 
  yeah but , maybe i 'm just being dumb . 
  if i have n't offended anyone on reddit then why would connecting flope -  \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 make anyone want to torment the owners of that house as opposed to the people one door over or in another country ? 
  hmm . . 
  i 'm still not sold on the whole idea but i suppose the effort it takes to play it safe is fairly low regardless . 
  what part is gross ? 
  same , it 's like `` bitch i was just trying to see what you guys were doing ! '', 
  i totally agree with your sentiment and i think you 're right , but just to make sure i was being clear earlier :, 
  i do n't know if the locking door analogy really works . 
  in that scenario someone is looking to rob a place and is just as likely to choose any house on the street as mine , it 's completely random . 
  from what i gather people who worry about being identified online would be worried if somehow the burglar heard that the owner of one of the houses on the street was named ` mike ' , and based on that information decided to burglarize * his * house . 
  i 'm just not seeing a connection between * being identified -  being victimized * unless you specifically were already at risk of being victimized for something . 
  but i digress , i agree it is easier to just keep the personal info on the dl . 
  damn those are some fine ass bitches . 
  i actually ca n't believe a dog would enjoy the taste of a human tongue . 
  thanks for the response , i 'm in the process of purchasing a textbook that should help longterm, 
  whaaat where ? 
  everywhere i 've been that has always cost $ 7 - $ 9, 
   i believe the team ended up giving the girl a complimentary ball as well . 
  the rich get richer . 
  ** most recent youtube comment : **, 
   that whore needs to be raped, 
  yup , classic youtube . 
  it 's not her fault that someone else took the ball from her . 
  so what is a ` hipster ' ? 
  hahahaha, 
   circumsion is something i am glad my parents put me through . 
  why ? 
  i do n't agree with all the hate reddit gives to mras but this was pretty funny, 
  back to / r/4chan with you !, 
  about twice that amount die each year due to peanut allergies , which is surely a shittier reason to die . 
  fucking california taking my money !, 
  first time checking out this sub , never been a big fan of tb but i do n't understand why everyone enjoys getting treated like shit and still supports/upvotes all his stuff ? 
  it 's like people here are trapped in an abusive relationship . 
  edit : what i think it might be is that every single person thinks to themselves , `` oh yeah the community sucks , but * not me * . '', 
  pretty sure that 's not the way he sees it . 
  yeah the area i live has the highest minimum wage in the country , so everything is more expensive . 
  which would be fine if i was fucking employed haha . 
  i do n't think one is better than the other to be honest . 
  i 'm pretty sure the parents would feel just as bad if not worse if they made their kid a pb&j sandwich that killed him than if they just did what most people do and some nurse in a hospital performed a circumcision . 
  edit : but to each their own, 
  are you sure ? 
  why would they give a ball to the person who was too slow to even get the first one ? 
   that 's the joke, 
   the joke, 
   joke, 
  hmm . . skeptical . 
  do you have firsthand experience with this ? 
  terrifying, 
  guess this is one of those ` no child left behind scenarios ' . 
  i was just on hcsmp a couple days ago and two of my idiot friends died within 30 seconds . 
  what have you been playing lately, 
  edit : dude we made our reddit accounts 1 day apart !, 
  it 's your only option . 
  duuude . . this hamburger tastes like ... beef and bread . . 
  different product , but solid review, 
  op i just took antibiotics for some kind of infection and i still feel sick . 
  am i pretty much doomed ? 
  been sick for like 30 days now and finished a z-pack a few days ago . 
  i feel like at this point i 've gone through the medical science gambit and it 's just my time to go . 
  fuck yes we are , why ca n't i download it yet ahhh, 
   it 's a half assed console port .
