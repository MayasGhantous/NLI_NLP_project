   such a creature would be `` born '' by a diploid cell dividing into two haploid cells , and would `` mate '' by two haploid cells fusing into a diploid cells . 
  but . . then how do they grow in population ? 
  if you have cells a and b. 
  they then split into a1 , a2 , b1 and b2 . 
  say a1/b1 combine to form c and a2/b2 combine to form d. 
  you started with two organisms ( a and b ) and ended with two organisms ( c and d ) . 
   children with asthma and immunodeficiencies are at high risk, 
  what about everyone else ? 
   treatment of polio often requires long-term rehabilitation , including occupational therapy , physical therapy , braces , corrective shoes and , in some cases , orthopedic surgery . 
  no cure , you are correct . 
  what 's the incidence rate of polio in say the us ? 
  were you vaccinated for it ? 
  i 'd love for you to share your expertise on the matter . 
  this conversation seemed to suddenly become very emotionally charged ; i 'm sorry for any deaths or medical misfortune you or your loved ones have experienced from preventable diseases , but at this point given what we know about vaccines and the diseases they prevent i do n't think it 's possible to sell me on mandatory vaccinations or criminal prosecution . 
  exactly , personally i 'm quite surprised given reddit 's seemingly anti-government nature ( in light of the overarching power of the nsa ) that they would be in favor of such orwellian practices such as the forced injection of government-mandated substances into their children in the face of losing custody or imprisonment if they fail to comply . 
  it almost seems too crazy to be real that so many people are in favor of that , but hey apparently i 'm the odd one out . 
  i know jobs called lsd one of the most important decisions in his life , but from some cursory googling i could n't find any link between sagan and acid , only marijuana . 
  how will you get the diseases from them if you 've been vaccinated ? 
  right but even though you took the risk of getting vaccinated it did n't end up helping you at all in the end . 
  my point being there 's no absolute answer and that each person should weigh the + / - for themselves . 
  okay . . so then there 's no point in getting vaccinated then is there ? 
  okay , but * most * people probably do n't have issues with asthma , immunodeficiency , etc. 
  so with your line of thought what is the point in them getting vaccinated if , as you say , they `` do n't give a fuck about everyone else '' ? 
  right , so treatments and vaccines are both < 100 % effective , therefore it comes down to a personal assessment on weighing the risk/benefit of inaction in * attempting * to prevent an ailment that you may end up getting regardless . 
  but in the spirit of this specific comment chain ( sorry i 'm trying to respond to a lot of angry posters here from my op ) , i can see what you mean regarding viral infections and i suppose my original comment would make more sense when applied to diseases that are currently vaccinated against and also treatable with high success . 
   therefore presents absolutely no risk to humans in small doses . 
  could you elaborate on that ? 
  i know there are documented incidences of individuals exhibiting negative reactions to routine vaccines , myself included , so surely there must be some effect on the human body other than simply the intended immunization . 
  well smallpox is gone , it 's out of human hands at this point regardless of vaccinations . 
  i 'm just here playing devil 's advocate , i find reddit 's overly zealous attitude towards vaccinations kind of weird . 
  unfortunately this wo n't see the light of day since you 're using the meme wrong , op . 
  the unpopular opinion puffin is for * popular * opinions that are widely held on reddit but may not be politically correct to say . 
  in other words the hivemind will never allow someone who disagrees with them to see the front page , but it was a noble attempt . 
  you 're right so far , too bad really . 
  ** blasted !!, 
   immigration laws, 
  * emmigration in this case . 
  ^ the ^ ^ more ^ ^ ^ you ^ ^ ^ ^ know, 
  surprised no one else replied . 
  the us would be fucked , to put it bluntly . 
  the other country would be * temporarily * fucked , but the absolutely * enourmous * boom in taxable goods being purchased in the country ( read : pretty much any transaction depending on the country ) would create a rise in gdp so tremendous it would without a doubt become the richest country in the world , given the size of 90 % of the us population . 
  for the 10 % that remained in the us they would likely see taxes increase severely ( think  700 % ) and even then depending on who left , the infrastructure workers , public servants , corporations would all be stalled . 
  basically everything would be fucked , but like other posters mentioned the us would never allow that amount of people to leave , even if they had to forcefully keep them here . 
  i 'm unconvinced that one poses a greater threat than the other to be honest . 
  but difference of opinion i suppose . 
  interesting . 
  i was also under the impression that smallpox was eradicated completely from the planet , so why would people still be getting vaccinations for it ? 
   not in the same ballpark as london , paris , hong kong , tokyo , chicago , nyc , la , etc. 
  ^ ^ i 'll ^ ^ just ^ ^ be ^ ^ over ^ ^ here ^ ^ in ^ ^ my ^ ^ etc. 
  ^ ^ classification . 
  * ^ - san ^ francisco *, 
  ... does n't it ? 
  so . . do these streets not see the sun except for 2 days out of the year ? 
  that black bitch is n't too bad, 
  ** oh my god **, 
  we know that no vaccination can guarantee you will not become infected with what you are vaccinating against regardless of whether or not you get ` immunized ' ( cdc ) . 
  we know that some people react poorly to vaccinations , causing illness or in some cases death ( who ) . 
  we have vaccines for diseases that have been completely erradicated already or ailments that have highly effective treatments regardless . 
  these are things we `` know '' , as much as a reasonable person could be expected to believe something without physically seeing the results themselves . 
  this information is not significant enough for people to avoid vaccines entirely , losing out on the benefits they can provide for an individual/society , but it is definitely not something that should be government mandated and injected into children at the discretion of the people who create the vaccines . 
  what do you think ? 
  i guess i should have been more clear , i think if chicago and la are considered ` top tier ' , then sf would be as well . 
  i worded my post poorly . 
  how is that shocking ? 
  they probably got a lot of inspiration from your post, 
  dat resolution, 
  what ? 
  when have they said that ? 
  how does ray ` know what he 's talking about ' and the others do n't ? 
  how spiteful, 
  wait why is this against the rules ? 
  surely it must only be when the tags are irrelevant ? 
  if i upload a gta v video and include stuff like , `` gta '' `` gta online '' `` gta tricks '' in the description , that 's against the tos ? 
  anyone got a source ? 
  i 'm pretty sure youtube tos views the tag system very similarly to the description in this regard , so be careful not to put spam in there either . 
  ** youtube tos : community guidelines - tags : **, 
   everyone hates spam . 
  do n't create ** misleading ** descriptions , tags , titles or thumbnails in order to increase views . 
  it 's not okay to post large amounts of * untargeted , unwanted or repetitive * content , including comments and private messages . 
  from how i 'm interpreting this it seems like i might be in the clear , though i agree it 's best to be overly caution if one of the possible consequences is channel deletion . 
  i have the same problem !, 
  do you ever notice a dark spot on your sheets when you wake up that kind of smells like urine ? 
  edit : im just joking guys . 
  california , ma'am . 
  i would n't join one of the big networks like machinima or something but i 've been approached by a couple youtubers ( through this sub actually ) to collaborate on some stuff which i accepted and was pretty fun !, 
  felt kind of like working for a network except we were partners in the project , did n't have to sign any contract and both our channels grew from it !, 
   help you get higher ad prices, 
  any idea how that works ? 
  how are you able to negotiate which ads are displayed on your videos ? 
  oh wow , those sound like they might be good . 
  canada has all the fun . 
  +1 for avoiding domestic violence , -1 for recommending a breakup over how tight he turns lids . 
  oops i guess i should put it in there . 
  it 's hard to say , i mean if there was some kind of sweet spot where the ratio of low price : quality was the best that 'd be great , but i could probably scrape together ~ $ 600 . 
  hey you may or may not have heard , but you only got one side of audio, 
  ha that would make my year , those sound unbelievably tasty . 
  well my mother always told me not to give my address to strangers on the internet . . 
  . . but she did n't say anything about chips , so yeah i 'll pm you right now !, 
  well , they said in the video that it took them ~ 3 hours to build . . and ryan said he started feeling sick during the patch on wednesday . . so yes i think they did . 
  is it that outlandish to assume that ?
