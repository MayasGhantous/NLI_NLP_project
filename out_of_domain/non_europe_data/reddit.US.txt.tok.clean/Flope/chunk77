  well played, 
  perhaps we 're getting different search results , i only checked the first 5 links [ here ] ( https://www.google.com/#q=illegal+grow+vegetables+home&amp;safe=off ) and they seem to all be talking about people who were threatened if they did n't remove the veggies from in front of their house and a woman who went to court to fight a 93 day jail sentence for the same offense . 
  i did n't bother checking link 4 because the site seems kinda wonky . 
  pretty sure this is illegal bro . 
   very specific areas, 
   like africa, 
  that does n't make sense , if there was n't racism than surely the numbers would be about the same ? 
  he 's in the refrigerator !, 
  sorry buddy, 
  helpful, 
  [ meese is a correct interpretation of the plural form of moose . 
  ] ( http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/moose ), 
  i do n't even . . 
  this idea seems so obvious to me that i feel like it does n't even need to be stated , which is why i suspect i 'm misunderstanding it . 
  i mean , if we have 2 people , then we are guaranteed at least 1 pair of mutual acquaintances or mutual strangers . 
  is this theory just a mathematical proof or is it actually attempting to define how humans interact with others ? 
  i mean if i go to the movies with my group of 5 friends , there will not be 3 mutual strangers . 
  unless it is only used to describe unplanned/random scenarios , in which case if you chose 6 random people from earth it is astronomically likely that you will not have 3 mutual acquaintances . 
  also is that last part about aliens meant to say that they are vastly superior to us if they know r ( 5,5 ) so we should try to appease them , left we be destroyed ; but if they do n't know r ( 6,6 ) they 're idiots and we could destroy them ? 
  to be fair the teacher probably thought it was an innocuous ` love ' note , kids that age send awkward notes all the time . 
  i wo n't be overclocking , since i do n't know what that is and i use my computer for a lot of stupid shit that might interfere with that . 
  my buddy whose selling the card supposedly manages high fps in games like bf4 , do you know of a cheap alternative that would be much better ? 
  thanks for the help, 
   do you have your old hardrive ? 
  yeah i 've got the whole dell xps still , it 's just 6 years old is all . 
  ~ 6 hours away from the closest one i believe , they do n't deliver ? 
  i do n't need windows , 1920 x 1080 , no . 
  it 's only 4gb though , do n't you think i 'd need an upgrade to run the games i want ? 
  from what it looks like inside it 's 4 1gb strips . 
  yep that 's the desktop , may have swapped a few parts when ordering since dell lets you do that . 
  thanks for the help !, 
  awesome thanks for the help !, 
  do you think something like this will be able to run stuff on high-ish settings and record ? 
  couple more quick questions :, 
  - there 's a cpu currently on sale for half the price [ here ] ( http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/searchtools/item-details.asp?edpno=8526345&amp;sku=gnt-101773986 ) , is the one you listed a lot better and worth the extra money you think ? 
  - the ram in my pc is just 4 x 1gb sticks ( less than the laptop i use ) , is n't that kind of small for running games ? 
  and if so do you have any recommendations on what would be compatible with this new motherboard , or how do i check what 's compatible ? 
  - also i 've never ` built ' a pc before , do i need like tools ( screwdriver , thermal paste , etc. ) ? 
  thanks !, 
  is canada part of the uk ? 
   $ 200,000 in debt to my parents, 
  be thankful it is n't to the federal government at least . 
  bad light make tires go * pop * !, 
  it 's pretty much like being the president of the us or the head of the nsa . 
   edit : it 's a moo point anyway, 
  * moot , but for all intensive purposes i understood you irregardless . 
  i do n't get it . . what 's wrong ? 
  ur a dumb guy, 
  holy shit that 's a lot of laugh track, 
  ** uuuuuuuuuughhhhhhh **, 
  haha i like your flair, 
  e-mail me the details : bryan@crosscoastgaming.com, 
  edit : include some info about the game/team as well, 
  that 's probably a good idea , 
  lax means los angeles international ( airport ) . 
  is public nudity illegal there ? 
  no you 're definitely right , he said it on a podcast . 
  i 'm just saying his reasoning would n't really make sense if he used lax as an example , which i ca n't recall if he did or not . 
  oh thank god , seeing this in this subreddit scared me , i thought the kid died or something . 
  not sure if your name would be more sad with or without a comma . 
  skank . 
  i bet he clocked her as soon as the video ended . 
  that 's incredibly good, 
  more specifically ? 
  who are either of them ? 
  not really, 
  most controversial comment on reddit . 
  *** yaaaaoooowwww !!, 
  if i 'm not mistaken , the same is true for people . 
  wow . 
  how closeminded, 
  fat unemployed women tattoo butterflies ( sp ? ), 
  above their anus . 
  typically in places like new jersey most often done by people born ~ 1985 - 1992, 
  that 's pretty nifty with the foot, 
  just read that , definitely a soothing story . 
  four words for you :, 
  there 's a watermark on it, 
  when my grandkids are memeing it up with their * actually not terribly uninformatively redundant albino koala fish kyle * i 'll look them in the eyes and say i was there when memes first started putting shadows on the text . 
   more than true, 
  i 'm intrigued . 
  ** impossible . 
  she consumes more calories than she burns , no other explanation . 
  \\ - all of the reddit fitness scientists, 
  word . 
  i 'll take your word for it . 
  i do n't think that is a matter of contention , what i was referring to was the mantra so often repeated that if someone is overweight it 's due to them not counting calories or not exercising ; in fact people who claim to have disabilities or diseases that prevent them from reaching ideal weight are routinely criticized , and often made fun of around reddit . 
  the rabbit nose kind of breaks the illusion, 
  dont dead . 
  open inside . 
  there are conditions which make it impossible to achieve a normal weight , do you disagree with this ? 
  even conditions which only * hinder * fitness progress may put a person in a situation where losing weight means making decisions detrimental to their health ( i.e. 
  starvation ) and will end up losing more important stuff than fat . 
  jesus i hope for your sake you never find yourself in a position where you ca n't attain normal weight , it would rock your world . 
  also thanks for the downvotes , sweet discussion . 
  okay , so how is someone with [ aids ] ( http://abcnews.go.com/images/entertainment/ht_jared_leto_terry_richardson_thg_121129_vblog.jpg ) , [ marfan syndrome ] ( http://fe867b.medialib.glogster.com/media/27/278cdb5cb50dbbbbfca9626c902a4e49b38bd4841a54858119cb698fc117aeb5/marfan-syndrome-2-jpg.jpg ) or both expected to achieve a normal weight without further sacrificing their health ? 
  do n't recommend any rap songs . 
  any advice on how to break out of one or help someone else break out of a loop ? 
  i wrote an incredibly long 4 paragraphs , submitted it and realized it was way too long haha . 
  but tldr i would n't * recommend * using psychedelics as a way to face your fears since the general idea seems to be that people with mental instabilities or traumatic experiences that they have n't come to terms with should avoid psychedelics .
