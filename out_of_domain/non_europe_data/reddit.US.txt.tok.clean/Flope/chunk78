  that being said , i 've had bad trips before , like ones where i knew for sure i was moments from dying , and though it was obviously horrifically terrifying at the time , i still look back at it as a peculiar and interesting experience , no lasting fear of the ordeal . 
  kind of like going to a haunted house on halloween , terrifying while it 's happening but you went voluntarily and you can look back and smile . 
  ( obviously this is not always the case , do some extensive research before proceeding with psychedelics - and do n't do fly agaric ), 
  edit : just to repeat , i * do not advocate * the use of psychedelics by those who with serious underlying mental issues or conditions . 
  if you must , do extensive research online , or ask someone you know who has experience .

  hm , this is interesting . 
  thanks for sharing .

  / r/drunkoragirl, 
  does that actually work for bad trips ? 
  my buddy said you need antipsychotics not antianxiety meds, 
  the who now ? 
  that show any good ? 
   never take antipsychotics if you do n't need them . 
  how come ? 
  edit : and back when i used to trip i 'd always keep some xanax with me just in case me or my friends needed one , we never did . 
  good idea though ? 
  also * skins *,

  feel free to take a look at the comment chain my comment spawned for more info . 
  there 's no reasoning with the vengeful hivemind , i 'm afraid .

  oh great !,

  would n't it just smell like a vagina ? 
  never seen it , should i watch it ? 
  that all sounds like it would smell absolutely awful . . 
  areas 1 - 50 ? 
  what about the holocaust ? 
  yup , living in san francisco right now , no way i could afford to stay here over the summer . 
  as someone currently in sf , be aware that although you might be getting paid a lot , the cost of living is also significantly higher here , [ having the highest rent in the country ] ( http://www.sfexaminer.com/sanfrancisco/new-numbers-show-san-francisco-has-nations-highest-rents/content?oid=2626465 ) . 
  why did n't your biological family just adopt you ? 
  what a great write up thanks for that . 
  i 've had some experience with lsd and this totally reminded me of my own trips haha . 
  i definitely would not be down for a grocery store , but i bet walking out into the sunshine was incredible . 
  as for you and your buddy trying to sleep like an hour into your trip , what was the plan there ? 
  i know for me personally i 've never been able to sleep the night after dropping cid, 
  something i 've learned :, 
  `` if you take psychedelics and do n't expect to completely trip , you 're gon na have a bad time . '', 
  who would ever use this as a bench ? 
  `` why are you so tall ? '', 
  `` how did you get so tall ? '', 
  `` same . '', 
  or if you 've ever seen any porn . 
   about 4 out of every 5 ** adults ** here are cut . 
   those number are completely off . 
  83 % of men where circumcised in 1965 and now it is 54 % not 77 % . 
  in many areas the majority of all newborns are left intact . 
  what part would you cut exactly ? 
  seriously , i 've never been to one before but from what i 've heard i get the impression that i would be a superstar for just being generally social and having a somewhat normal appearance , surely they ca n't be that bad . 
  dangerous to who ? 
   but it does bug me that the show puts women on display far more often than men . 
  i 'm okay with a show with a ton of sex and nudity , but i wish they 'd cool it on the female nudity or up the male nudity . 
  do you personally want to see more penis/balls in the show ? 
  my understanding is that among women the majority would prefer less nudity overall , and among men the majority would prefer more female nudity , so in order for them to pander to the audience for ratings you end up with a product that heavily favors female nudity to male nudity . 
   while it can be very sexist , there is also a lot of strength in some of the female characters . 
  danaerys , for example , is anything but weak ( imo ) . 
  how do you feel about danaerys falling in love with her rapist/forced husband ? 
  is that ` sexist ' or ` misogynistic ' or is it fine ? 
  interesting , i guess i 'm just not a part of any subs that generally organize meetups . 
  i 'm in san francisco so i 'm sure there must be tons around me . 
  ** let 's stick to questions about rampart please **, 
  interesting , i guess i was just curious because i feel like the chief complaint of ` sexism ' in got relates to danaerys falling in love with her rapist , which can obviously send the wrong message to younger viewers of both sexes . 
  other than that i do n't really find anything about the show to be questionable , given the time period/culture the characters are living in . 
  interesting , i have n't read the books . 
  that sounds a lot different . 
  www.fearus.org has additional info , but i 'm not quite sure how to interpret it .
