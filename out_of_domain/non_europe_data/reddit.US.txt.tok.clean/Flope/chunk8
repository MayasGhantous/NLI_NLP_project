  saying that is n't an analogy is like saying blue is n't a color !, 
  ( now ? ), 
  `` alright so first i 'm going to take off the umbilical cord . '', 
  that 's good , i could n't handle the extra calories after eating an entire placenta . 
  would it have been too difficult for you to add in your post which rule i had broken ? 
  i 've just skimmed the new rules on the right , and read the entirety of the post explaining the new changes and my stupid brain still ca n't figure it out . 
  much love , cornelius blouwrankle flope ii, 
  for some reason i spent a long time looking at everything in the picture except the board to see how many contextual clues were available for me to psychoanalyze your life . 
  intriguing . 
  what do you mean by `` malicious '' ? 
  surely a link with a jpg or gif extension could n't deliver harmful software or anything else , right ? 
  do you simply mean linking to a nsfw image , and if so why is tumblr worse than imgur ? 
  thanks, 
  as someone in college with a double major in theatre and political science , would you recommend me becoming a movie star or the next governor of california ? 
  `` alright now hold this fish in your mouth and smile or i wo n't return you to your family . '', 
  and with this , hundreds of redditor 's with yogapants-wearing classmates were charged with sexual assault , after firmly slapping the ass of who they believed to be r0xxer . 
  jesus i thought i was going crazy until you said you 've posted this before . 
  i kept thinking , i know a story like this should n't seem so strikingly familiar . . 
  yo this game is pretty slick . 
  i really like the fluidity of the player movement , dodging the sentry in the first level was fun too i managed to not be seen on my first attempt . 
  i agree with quentinp i felt like i had to lean forward to see the screen , maybe include a fullscreen option ? 
  also something just popped in my head , would be kinda neat on darker levels if the sentries had flashlights , so you could really see them looking around for you and what not , just a thought . 
  good job so far and good luck !, 
  this was pretty fun !, 
  surprisingly hard as well . 
  i actually ended up giving up on stage 2 after about my 25th attempt haha , much more difficult than i had anticipated . 
  i really like the background with all of the people running around , added an extra cool zombie panic * esque * element to it that was awesome . 
  i also really liked the way the game begins , i think that 's perfect , i would not have expected the title to be so perfectly fitting with the objective haha . 
  the one thing that threw me off was the player texture seemed a little bland , was n't sure if it was a placeholder or not but it kind of had that feel controlling a solid #ffffff . 
  insensitiveguy . 
  do you have any other symptoms ? 
  lyme disease can manifest in many ways , many of which are only recently being recognized including chronic psychological disturbances . 
  look into it , though it is hard to find reliable information on it online without some digging , also if you plan on seeing a doctor for it you will have much better luck finding one on the east coast . 
  search for the little things in life that make you happy , or , less miserable , and try to make those a focal point while avoiding or minimizing the things that are worse . 
  if things progress you can always call anonymously 24/7 to 1-800-suicide just to have an open discussion . 
  huh , did you guys get a ____ long well ? 
  my current college roommate does shit that pisses me off and is disgusting , but at least he showers ~ every day ( even if he throws up in it and does n't tell me ) .

  holy shit man for the longest time i was staring at this photo wondering how this guy recognized you from such a seemingly obscure video , then i went to the comments and found out the guy on the left is famous , whatever .

  i 've always wanted to visit around those areas , but i am afraid that as a 6 ' 5 '' inch man i will just scare away all of my little asian friends . 
  well at least that happened . 
  interesting . 
  i just end up calling all of the body parts to counsel and decide who gets left out of the blanket and who gets left under to try and balance the overall temperature or my entire being . 
  thanks for this !, 
  where did he say he spent his days surfing ? 
  and i think some of that post is a bit tongue-in-cheek . 
  do you happen to have any advice or knowledge about what i should do if i were to be bitten by a venomous snake in the wild ? 
  edit : just wanted to say too , cool ama , real unique . 
  i 'm not sure why some redditors are acting like cocksuckers and being rude , but maybe it 's because school is n't in for the day yet . 
  i clearly would n't suggest or condone someone intentionally injecting venom into their veins , but it 's not my choice to make and you probably have much more knowledge than me on the subject , if nothing else experience . 
  this could potentially be one of those things that is just an average part of life in ~ 100 years . 
  shhhhhh !, 
  do n't bring in more competition !, 
  this gif has already been retired . 
  / r/retiredgif, 
  so overplayed . 
  seriously this . 
  is tagging people now just an excuse to post the next time you see them , `` hurr why do i have you tagged as this ? 
  * hinges * , * oranges * peach pear ** plum ** * syringes * , yeah here i ** come ** i 'm * inches * , away from you dear fear ** none ** , hip-hop is in a state of 91 ** 1 **, 
  love this track too . 
  `` enough dirt on you to murder you , this is what the fuck i * do * ! '', 
  insane . 
  dying of old age sounds terrible to me . 
  i think imhtpsnvsbl is speaking on a basis of instinct and evolutionary traits . 
  every living thing has certain fears intrinsically and instinctively impressed on their brain in order for them to avoid circumstances that would be harmful to them and limit the gene pool , logic would have it that the most fearful circumstance is certain death . 
  i 'm not saying this with certainty , but in accordance with what i just said i would assume that had he shot you in the chest and you laid there bleeding out over ~ 5 minutes , you would probably regret your decision . 
  is scarlet fat ? 
  i 'm mostly doing 3d games at the moment , do you have a website or any samples by chance ? 
  i messaged you, 
  messaged, 
  it 's more like * dirtonyou * and * murderyou * , 
  just because i did n't throwup does n't mean i was n't drunk . 
  amateurs . 
  oh my god yes , what was it . 
  there was also one that put all the top links on reddit into ms word, 
  sounds good !,

  long commute . 
  this is the first thing i downloaded on my new phone . 
  broke my phone . 
  got another one today . 
  downloaded it again . 
  two broken phones . 
  would give more but it broke my phones . 
  happy birthday dude . 
  nice try steve jo -, 
  wait . . 
  thanks, 
  well , i finally convinced my friend to play on this server after weeks of talking him into it , and got him to join due to the february update . 
  he 's my only friend who plays minecraft so i was stoked when i got him to play on this server . 
  we made boats and were trying to swim out to sea to find an island to make our home . 
  i got bored of swimming so playfully shot an arrow at his boat without thinking .
