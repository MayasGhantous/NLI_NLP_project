  inception is still pretty much the exact same . 
  well if you ever change your mind pm me . 
  why would you need a throwaway for this ? 
  is it just the worry of std 's ? 
  tagged as '20 year old dude ' , no stalking necessary . 
  i imagine it would be far too addicting . 
  honestly i 'd be so embarrassed i would call the whole thing off and go for a walk . 
  ca n't getting shit into your blood kill you ? 
  honestly if you 're a male you 're kind of fucked if any of the 3 happen to you . 
  how is it not super obvious to the girl ? 
  well i imagine you would be no matter what , but i 'm curious what you think washing will do, 
  what 's it taste like ? 
  only one way to find out !, 
  how * you * doin ? 
  you are misinterpreting the kinsey scale . 
  okay so then what the fuck do you need a tank for ? 
  you know every video with ads makes the creator money , so i 'm not sure how you choose which users need it ? 
  i mean unless you 're only blocking like vevo and shit, 
  yeah , it 's almost like he 's making some kind of . . show . . 
  do you have the same complaints about spongebob ? 
  pretty sure that 's what he 's talking about . 
  not i , try finding a way to contact mtn dew or doritos , or whoever handles their promotional offers . 
  i think the company is called something like young america , or promotion america or some shit . 
  good luck !, 
  are you familiar with laws regarding the internet ? 
  like online fair use , copyright ? 
  what about delegating contracts ? 
  i do n't have a job for you but i 'd pay ~ $ 10 for you to answer some questions on skype maybe . 
  are you living under a rock ? 
  it only says 10 % of * american * males were rated a * 5 or 6 * for at least * one 3 year period * during their life . 
  really does n't seem too unbelievable . 
  of course all 3 are negative occurrences , i should have been more clear and said that society would likely be on the woman 's side of all 3 of those events regardless if she was the attacker or defender . 
  i hope you 're the girl in my digital communications class . 
  ** mr. dinklage **, 
  if you could be any animal what would you be ? 
  who is the best looking actress on got ? 
   essentially , they think that industrial and rural workers have only themselves to blame for not having enough wealth/education to work a white-collar job, 
  hm , where have i seen this mentality before ? 
  i always hate these , `` was it me or her ? '', 
  posts on this subreddit because we obviously are seeing one side of the situation explained . 
  no one is going to write , `` so i was beating the fuck out of my wife the other day and she said she wanted a divorce , did i do something wrong or is she just crazy ? '', 
  not saying you did this op , the title just seemed familiar . 
  this is great but how expensive are these things ? 
  i mean if i 'm just now creating my first game , i 've got essentially 0 income from business , so is it feasible for me to be able to afford a lawyer and accountant this early ? 
  yup , seems pretty weird to me . 
  especially when you 're trained to the point of op where you just automatically start pissing every time you shower . 
  that 20 year old in the swimsuit is pretty hot . 
  that 's what she did, 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ dontyoufuckingwhooshmefaggot, 
  . . she told them ? 
  do n't flies live like , 3 days ? 
  could n't i just wait for the maggots to grow up and leave my rotting arm to become functioning members of fly society ? 
  wait , so if you just do n't fuck with a bot fly larva in your arm it will eventually sort itself out and fly away ? 
  / r/glitchinthematrix, 
  yeah , what he said does n't contradict any of this . 
  * heart surgeons are more likely to be men than women . 
  i should have been explicit , but courts are a part of society . 
  so court cases would , and do , favor women in all 3 of the above scenarios . 
  check your privilege . 
  which is why you should n't be selling alphaware to customers . 
  no , halo single player was good . 
  i think he saying specifically call of duty has n't had a decent campaign since ~ 5 iterations ago , and battlefield was never focused on campaign . 
  just watch that whole episode , it 's called * the gang buys a boat * , available on netflix and i 'm sure anywhere else online . 
  nice job utilizing the default textures , really good outcome, 
  yeah these look fantastic but i 'm not trying to live in the only cities to have been hit with nuclear bombs thank you very much . 
  i 'll take my residual radiation with my mcdonalds like a normal american . 
  you do n't know that , someone has the f1 license . 
  link ? 
  because they have the face of their leader on a poster , really ? 
  do n't you think [ shit like this ] ( http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1267650/thumbs/o-lincoln-memorial-facebook.jpg ) is infinitely more foreboding and frightening ? 
  edit : pretty interesting discussion guys , i do n't mind the downvotes . 
  / u/robby5566 provided some [ interesting insight ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/wtf/comments/22uqzq/the_headquarters_of_benito_mussolini_and_the/cgqnyyt ) regarding some of the design choices of the mussolini piece . 
  wow i had n't seen the source before , that 's much funnier than i imagined haha, 
  maybe because you 're familiar with who he is and you 're ` on his side ' . 
  i 'm pretty sure if this picture was circulating around north korea they would be fucking terrified of us , or at least give off the same reaction that we have to the op . 
  uh , probably because his parody is the fact that he alone is responsible for raising the bar for every person on earth . 
  i can understand why he would be less receptive if he was portrayed as a gay man trapped in the closet , a woman with a bomb in her pussy or a pop star who shoots her own brains out . 
  i suppose the major factor , the way i see it anyways , would be the current party vs past leader depiction . 
  but i still feel if today you were to show someone both of the pictures who had no clue about the history of either , they would both represent the leaders of fearfully strong empires or powers . 
  yeah i 'm actually surprised by the amount of downvotes , but it 's no matter . 
  at least the comment has spawned a bit of discussion below it , and yeah i agree the context of one of the depicted people still being alive makes a difference , but without context both seem to be showing the fearfully powerful empire leaders of another country . 
  check out my edit , apparently some of these stylistic choices were par for the course during that time . 
  yup , it 's scary some of the comments here pointing out things that would make an empire ` obviously evil ' that the us and others have in common . 
  below i made a pretty contested comment comparing the op to the lincoln statue in dc , 50/50 on that one . 
  nice , i got ` baitcar ' and my buddy has ` cashcab ' . 
  so if we ever need to film a reality tv show . . 
  apparently some of the stylistic choices may have been influenced by other common art practices of the time , i just learned . 
  for instance what do you think of [ this comment ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/wtf/comments/22uqzq/the_headquarters_of_benito_mussolini_and_the/cgqnyyt ) ? 
  i like the comparison he made to the obama picture . 
  same here . 
  oh great another armchair physician on reddit . 
  i 'll have yuo know it hapens all the tiem2 myan ifelfyne, 
  do you mean like , right before you stand up ? 
  or in general to work out the abdominals more ? 
  did he hear you hit the ground or something ? 
   the change in head is greater, 
  this is some solid science , seeing as your blood pressure can only move at the speed of push . 
  perfect . 
  6 ' 9 '' according to wikipedia, 
  people who want vaccines to be mandatory are fucking retarded .
