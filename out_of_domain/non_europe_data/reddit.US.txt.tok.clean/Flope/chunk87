   we dont need to travel faster than light , thats impossible . 
  we need to figure out a way to warp space so we can take shortcuts across the universe, 
  lol . 
  funniest thing i 've read today . 
  let 's just rent them and take them back to the us before our time is up !, 
  they can sit next to these dvd 's i never returned to blockbuster . 
   business that rely on gmail and google docs that ca n't get access to them for a week will overrun the white house and capitol building like zombies . 
  unfortunately no , other companies would be stepping over themselves to quickly fill the gap that google left behind , and pulling such a stunt , though i agree is for the best to get people to be proactive , can have absolutely terrible long-term effects on the companies that participate . 
  you 're making it seem like it 's hypocritical for him to support corporations that fight for the same public interest as he does , what 's wrong with that ? 
  are you saying it would only be okay to favor one company over the other due to their products ? 
  why have n't i heard of this before ? 
  i 'm honestly becoming more and more enamored by 4chan as the internet heads deeper into real identification , using full names , etc. 
  4chan is the largest community i know of that makes a real effort to keep all of it 's users as anonymous as possible , which is a ` sight for sore eyes ' if you will . 
  i 'd be really sad if 4chan went away . 
  :( it 's the largest community i know of that makes a concerted effort to keep it 's users as anonymous as possible ; everyone else seems to be going the other way . 
  businesses wo n't use software that is only marginally better when it will go offline suddenly to support some cause , that 's ridiculous . 
  it 's not about google losing the lion 's share of the market overnight , but it 's another con to consider when using their products as opposed to a competitor who does n't shut their servers down . 
  how could they tell ? 
  i 'm more or less in the industry but dress in the same wardrobe i had in high school . 
  i mean i guess if i were walking out of twitter holding a cup of coffee they would know . 
  upvoted just because the backlash whenever you talk shit about apple products is hilarious , regardless if people like/dislike ` apple ' as a company . 
  fair enough haha , though i have n't had too many encounters with the sfpd . 
   we should grab a coors lite sometime . 
  true patriot, 
   what 's hilarious is that you do n't realize every western country spies just as much as the us ... 
  you realize we 're talking about an article that specifically mentions the us , right ? 
  this is why idiots get elected . 
  they deliver an eloquent 5 minute speech that asks complex questions and answers none of them , and everyone starts fawning over them for their great intellect . 
  [ of course .

  i just jizzed, 
  make more videos . 
  it 's deliciously normal sounding though , you could have a promising career as a totally normal sounding guy . 
   woman here , so not as creepy ?? 
  [ guess my compliments are creepy . 
  they should use proactive, 
  thought it was dustin hoffman, 
  jake gyllenhaal, 
  til people are different . 
  ironically all of the top comments are complaining about the comments , so yes i agree , your comment is definitely shitty . 
  where do you think the joke came from ? 
  or the title of the post ? 
   all of the sudden, 
  all of the sudden . 
  all of them . 
  i 'm sorry but . . really ? 
  you 're subscribed to a subreddit and in a discussion thread about two people from ** achievement hunter ** . 
   we 're part of the commonwealth, 
  perhaps that 's why . 
  none of them are typically used by americans . 
  candy ? 
  that 's what she just said ? 
  kerily . 
  maybe you are n't cut out for this . 
  i can see why , i 'd probably try something similar if someone tried to take away my theoretical child . 
  if you are being serious , kerily is obviously a boy 's name so i just said that so that maybe they would understand the op 's assumed gender . 
  north americans, 
  no haha . 
  all chocolate is candy , but not all candy is chocolate . 
  just as all dogs are animals , but not all animals are dogs . 
  candy refers to any sweet , usually sugary treat generally with low nutritional value that is usually marketed towards kids . 
  lol . 
   there are two types of [ people ] : those who ** x ** , and then there are liars . 
  i always hate when this saying is applied , because it 's always used in a situation where there are legitimately a large group of people who fall into the other group . 
  reddit 's favorite way to use this from what i 've seen is about peeing in the shower . 
   it makes it seem like there 's a black hole at the center of her ass, 
  i mean . . 
  i would keep my children as far away from this audience as possible , burnie 's got the right idea . 
  that 's really fucking ignorant . 
   you should instantly know or not know, 
  try again . 
  lol, 
  i always thought catheters were just for the urethra . 
  but you 're the only one calling this guy a creep , so what 's the issue ? 
  not offended , but did chuckle . 
  damn people really like to throw that word around a lot , i guess you could just be trolling but if not it 's pretty sad . 
  i really hate how much shit people online give to kids about their voices being high , like we all sounded like that once it 's not a conscious decision they 're making . 
  it just seems really immature for older people to make kids feel bad about something they have no control over . 
   almost wish i could mute but then i 'd get kicked for not listening . 
  that sounds like the worst game ever . 
  it 's weird how you could be offended when you do n't receive a gift but then not send one yourself . 
  humans are dumb sometimes . 
  that 's so strange , like if i were to commit suicide , i mean , why would i want people to find me naked ? 
  i 'd definitely make sure i was wearing my sunday best . 
  those growing up in poverty are already intellectually disadvantaged when compared to children raised in affluent communities and households . 
  the effect of socioeconomic status and the communities that certain groups of people create have a huge effect on intelligence that is already seen as relatively ` normal ' . 
  as in , no on is surprised when the son of a lawyer and doctor grows up to be successful in a high paying job , and no one is surprised when an inner city youth raised by a single parent ends up in jail at some point . 
  allowing medically induced enhancements to intelligence would not be providing a benefit that is n't already there , it would simply be accepting it out loud and increasing the already existing gap between social classes . 
  lol alright then . 
  i think you should reassess yourself sometime , but i 'm just some idiot on reddit . 
  one of the best days of my life was grad night 2012 at disneyland where me and a few buddies did lsd and ran around and explored . 
  that being said i had done psychedelics multiple times before so it was n't my first experience . 
  if you 've never done a psychedelic , lsd is definitely the one to start with imo ( your results may vary ) , but i would suggest sticking close by your friend just to have someone to talk to if you get confused or to keep your thinking positive . 
  also if the other people tripping want to do something you do n't feel comfortable doing , i.e. 
  go on a big roller coaster , do n't give into pressure and just say you 'll wait for them . 
  this goes for your buddies too if they have n't done a psychedelic , do n't do stuff you are n't comfortable with and you 'll be fine . 
   hes pretty good looking which definitely helps . 
  i do n't want to come off as a douche , because i 'm certainly nothing special , but if you consider that good looking i think most of reddit should do fine . 
   if only more christians in the us would abide by this principle . 
  or people in general .
