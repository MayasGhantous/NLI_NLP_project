  turned out we had no spare boats on us . 
  and there was no land in sight in any direction . 
  i drowned trying to swim down and build a boat underwater . 
  now i 'm unable to play with my friend . 
  name : flope, 
  yep , already donated sorry . 
  friend was getting impatient with me and i found some extra money leftover in my paypal . 
  thankyou though , this is a cool thing you 're doing !, 
  maybe if you do it next month i will actually be in a terrible need for a soul like you !, 
  damn , why do these kids have to ruin the good name of cyrax . 
  i was a little more than a pack a day smoker and quit cold turkey . 
  you really have to do it for yourself , not for your disapproving friends / so . 
  quitting smoking was the best thing i 've done in/for my life . 
  i look at it as one of my greatest accomplishments as well , because i did it by myself . 
  i was successful on my 4th or 5th quitting `` attempt '' . 
  previously i had reasoned that i would just buy one pack and make it last as long as possible . 
  then it hit me , and i got serious . 
  i had maybe 16 left in the pack and just threw it away and never looked back . 
  tl ; dr if i can do it you can too !, 
  okay , but 100 years ago you would have been laughed out of town if you claimed animals had `` feelings '' and were in any way equal to us . 
  so what happens in 100 years when we discover that plants have feelings too ? 
  in fact , many studies have already proved that the environment and `` mood '' a plant is raised in will affect it 's growth rate ( i.e. 
  yelling at a plant constantly will make it wither faster ; playing soft music will make it grow faster ) , so why do they not get the same respect as animals ? 
  when are we going to reach a point where we realize everything that has `` energy '' , which is the only reason we are eating in the first place : to gain energy and nutrients from food , is a living thing just like we are . 
  and at that point i think we either accept the fact that we are the top of the food-chain and stop feeling guilty about it , or starve to death trying to eat rocks . 
  does any of this make sense or am i crazy ?

  still less work than feeding a cat 3 times a day and getting woken up at 4 am every morning for `` breakfast '' . 
  i did after reading both of you . 
  i figured someone must have made it by now . 
  on that note , where do you get 38 '' length jeans that still have smaller waste sizes like 32 '' ? 
  . . why are we funding broccoli research ? 
  thanks for the tip !,

  i would love to see what happens to them if i was hiding behind a bush throwing pop rocks . 
  i feel like every time one exploded their pupils would dilate and their heart rate would increase by ~ 20 % . 
  would be an interesting study nonetheless , to see if competitive athletes trained to begin at the sound of a certain sound replicate signs of increased adrenaline when the sound is heard in everyday life .

  my roommate . 
  more like dave troll . 
  ah yeah , the old `` dress like a soldier to buy beer '' technique . 
  how many people are you working with ? 
  how long have you been in production of this game and are you guys `` based '' anywhere particularly ? 
  why is this news ? 
  of course the paper is getting sued , are you joking ? 
  how do you write an article about an organization titled : `` what lies behind the facade '' and not expect recourse ? 
  i think people these days think that just because what they 're doing aligns with their personal moral beliefs that they are immune to any kind of backlash .
