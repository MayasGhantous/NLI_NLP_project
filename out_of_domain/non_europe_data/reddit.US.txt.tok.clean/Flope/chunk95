  well he should n't be starting shit anyways, 
  because that 's hundreds of dollars vs. potentially millions, 
   what are you so dumb ? 
  is english your first language ? 
  yeah i do n't know . 
  i totally get the merits behind keeping all of your information private and i accept that i 'm in the far minority of reddit who just does n't see the point . 
  if you argue with someone you never know how they will respond , regardless if it is outside of a gas station or in an ask reddit thread . 
  some people are fucking nuts , but the vast majority are sane individuals . 
  if someone specifically and really badly wanted to hurt * you * ( the general you ) , it would be pretty hard to stop them regardless if you are in person or online . 
  oh well yeah , you 'd have to get your buddy to do it as well though since they 'll probably dust for prints . 
  and although your fingerprints are expected to be found on the register you work at they probably should n't be all over the bottom of the compartments the cash lay in which is usually filled with bills . 
  all part of my plan . 
  shit what 's this from it 's escaping me, 
   yeah his normal/awesome distinction made it clear . 
  pretty sure it 's a girl . 
  edit : woah this comment had +20 at one point and is now at -6 . 
  must be a regional thing ? 
  as much as a post on reddit can matter , sure . 
  i think when speaking of a nuclear war that could potentially end 90 % + of human life , people consider it killing all life on the planet , which seems fair . 
   the federation of american scientists estimates that russia possesses 4,650 active nuclear warheads, 
  your link says a higher number :,

  it 's because you are n't tall , but it 's fucking annoying and always surprises me how people did n't learn in 2nd grade not to comment on people 's appearances who they do n't know . 
  / r/tall sent me . 
  is your name tomcruise smith ? 
  yeah i hear you . 
  i 'm 6 ' 6 '' myself and every time i meet someone new or am at a party i get the same stupid questions . 
  - wow you 're tall !, 
  - how 'd you get so tall ? 
  - do you play basketball ? 
  - come stand next to x so we can see how tall you are . 
  it 's fun every time . 
  right ? 
  a whole new dimension now, 
  thanks , edited . 
  just make sure you reupload foxfire because that 's who has her emails , and always have it on a usb stick in case you travel but want to bring your contacts . 
  i took a summer japanese intro course once when i lived in hawaii , i 'm not sure but i think this is a rough translation :,

  sorry i 'm not terribly familiar with the map , but i do program video games for a living , somewhat . 
  if you were able to shoot through the walls but unable to see them it is likely that you briefly lost connection to the server ( this happens more often than people would think ) at the exact moment that either a ) the map started and the building initialized or b ) the state ( destruction ) of the building changed , disallowing your local machine to interpret the building 's location and other attributes . 
  if you were unable to see it * and * unable to shoot through it then the most likely scenario is your local machine was unable to load the asset when the game initialized , or when the building state changed . 
  cool clip either way , was this xbox or pc ? 
  do you record a lot of clips ? 
  no problemuru .

  i do n't speak for everyone , but i really do n't feel like * pursuing * you is something that i require to begin a relationship . 
  i feel like that is mostly for the girl 's benefit so she can feel wanted and sought after , but in my own personal experience i 've usually taken any sign of disinterest as genuine disinterest and moved to the next one . 
  if a girl is interested in me or not opposed to my interest in her than she should be obvious about it , in a respectable way . 
  i 'm pretty sure anorexia is a quality defining someone 's dietary habits or an eating disorder , that 's like saying someone who is 300 pounds is severely mcdonalds . 
  could i see an example of your art ? 
  every photo of my coeds, 
  yup that 'll work !, 
   i 'm all for `` down with the corporations ! '', 
  and such ... 
  but i am not going to be picky about the economic model that enables humanity to colonize other planets . 
  good , we could use people like you as scv 's when we begin colonizing . 
   in the usa everyone seems happy to put the balance of power in the hands of employers , despite there already being a natural imbalance of power in their favour . 
  that 's not really it at all . 
  it 's just a different culture and it 's kind of ignorant to generalize the attitudes of 300 + million people . 
  there 's a strong feeling among many americans that working hard can be fulfilling and lead to a succesful life financially and other ways . 
  obviously no one wants to willfully hand over ` power to their employer ' but there is a sentiment that some of the benefits you are listing just come off as a lazy workforce . 
  the work of americans is n't going unrewarded either , considering not only is the usd worth more in the global market than the nzd but we also make more of it ( ~ $ 51,000 in us to ~ $ 45,000 in nz annual median income ) . 
  she may have had some kind of medical condition but yeah i agree that weight is definitely not normal . 
   i go to work , do my 40 hours, 
  here i was thinking you actually had some kind of sweet work week , but since you clearly know nothing of the us laws you are saying enrich the employer i 'll be the first to enlighten you that 40 hours is the maximum standard work week in the us , and here 's a little fun comparison for you :, 
  ** new zealand : **, 
   when an employee works more than their normal hours then they need to be paid for the overtime that they do . 
  there are , however , no legal requirements to pay overtime above the normal rate of pay after working a certain number of hours in a day or a week . 
  whether overtime rates will be paid is a matter for negotiation between an employer and an employee . 
   the fair labor standards act ( flsa ) requires overtime pay ( pdf ) to be at least one and one-half times an employee 's regular rate of pay after 40 hours of work in a workweek . 
  some states have overtime laws . 
  in cases where an employee is subject to both the state and federal overtime laws , the employee is entitled to overtime according to the higher standard ( i.e. , the standard that will provide the higher overtime pay ) . 
  but by all means feel free to keep circlejerking about how bad it is in the us and how we 're enriching our employers when your country has a gdp per capita more than 25 % lower than the us and no overtime laws . 
  but at least you 'll have your exotic birds i guess or whatever it is you bring to the global table . 
  fair enough , does price parity show nz economically superior in some way ? 
  legitimate question i 'm headed to sleep do n't feel like researching more of this stuff , international economics is usually kind of a bore to me . 
  edit : fuck me right ? 
  woah that 's awesome !, 
  i like the blue flowers the best , their petals look like little hands that are flipping me off or giving me a thumbs up . 
  sounds like you do n't know much about it if you think everyone will have the exact same experience you did . 
   what is life about to you people ? 
  making sure all these little island countries can have a populace full of healthy , happy human beings in exchange for allowing us to build military installations on them and giving us power to arrest it 's citizens if they hurt our industry . 
  as someone who got in trouble for ` looking guilty ' for shit i did n't do , i 'd say the connection that he a decade later committed a crime is pretty weak and would think twice before assuming a kid did something . 
   343i is doing a great job . 
  they copy pasted bungie 's flagship product and made it shiny , then went on to make the worst halo game , and are now re-releasing the games bungie made on a larger scale because the only product they made on their own sucked and sold less than a third of halo 3 's numbers despite the market being bigger . 
  ** edit : ** gosh i was so sure of myself but these downvotes have really made me realize what fucking artisans are employed over at 343 , ca n't wait for halo duty ops advanced 5 !, 
   get off of reddit you fucking loser, 
   im drunk as shit and its almost 5 am and your fucking comment really pissed me off, 
  you replied to the wrong comment , idiot .
