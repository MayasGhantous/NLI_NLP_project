   just lurked for a minute on some men 's right 's boards . 
  they 're still basically saying that her version of feminism is still too woman-focused . 
  in inviting men to be allies , they feel she 's only inviting them to help further women 's rights and not men 's rights also . 
  can you provide a source for any of this ? 
  this is why there are n't more women ceos , their reservations or emotional readings will get in the way of a preposterously good deal . 
  in sf you are free to be 100 % nude , and it does n't need to be part of an art exhibit . 
  great place . 
  but then we could n't see the art , bro !, 
  careers a lot of times ? 
   if you 're offended by a word you 're a fucking pussy and you need to grow up . 
  i 'm sorry to say the username `` whiteman '' does n't lend you much authority on the topic . 
  edit : figures the comment that gets piled on with the most downvotes is in a sub with so many bandwaggoning fags , and that immediately after upvoting the guy above 250 times saying you 're a pussy if you get offended by words , so many people seem to be butthurt by my response . 
  gj you guys , keep fighting the power . 
  no , not the 1 % . 
  the majority of parents . 
  it 's meant to protect children , not you . 
  i realize . 
  that 's literally the fucking post bro, 
  the unrealistic way that sex and violence is presented on tv you goof . 
  get out of here, 
  wow i 've never thought of it that way, 
  i apply this same logic to mental retardation . 
  obviously . 
  figures a mod of one of the defaults is such a crowd-following idiot . 
  have you considered inventing one ? 
  not op , but the ps3 is a video game console and the camino del muerte is a dangerous road used for travelling . 
  since when is brie in mad men ? 
   then to a meal plan of around 6,000 calories a day, 
  as someone without an eating disorder but who is still trying to gain weight , any hot tips on food that can quickly help reach that 6k a day mark ? 
  dae isis are inhuman monsters ? 
  great , thanks !, 
  not if you are asian or innuit . 
  you just need to accept 1 random bounty and complete it , then when you turn it in you will get a mission based on the completed bounty . 
  ah figures i stopped after the second season . 
  there 's also a [ video guide ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hydfp_rt92c&amp;feature=youtu.be ) showing some of the possible rewards as well as how to quickly progress through the bounties . 
  the idiots are the people wasting water to sprinkler their backyard during a terrible drought . 
  fellow ca here, 
  looks like they own the building next to it too which appears to be some kind of mcjail . 
  damn this is some rockstar level realism . 
  ** hahahahahahahahaha **, 
  i and thousands of other people are completely unable to see ships in the game . 
  so yeah , you could say i 'm pretty fucking underwhelmed . 
  are you speaking of [ the streisand effect ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/streisand_effect ) ? 
  she can smell their cum, 
  i 'm glad to see feminist progression has allowed the possibility of both genders now committing the atrocity of government-condoned murder . 
  then you 're probably like him . 
  wow what an original suggestion , upvoted so bungie can see this , they probably never thought to include it !, 
  if they really did stack then having all 3 would give a 33 % bonus , not 30 % . 
  just fyi, 
  edit : see math below simpletons, 
  each week you can get loot once per boss on each difficulty setting . 
  `` i 'm this many ! '', 
  * holds up spork *, 
  i never seem to find foreigners on destiny . 
  legally ? 
  sorry dude i think you 're alone , no one on this subreddit seems interested in any type of global chat . 
  freak . 
  check out destinylfg . net or . com or [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kny7d-hyiys ) where people are meeting up in the comments . 
  it was the `` zoom '' functionality in halo 2 , think it makes more sense than lt. 
  there 's a lot of video explanations [ like this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hydfp_rt92c ) floating around if that helps , good luck !, 
  if you want to do player vs player matches ( like deathmatch , territories , etc. ), 
  then when you are in orbit looking at the planets just select the two crossed swords emblem near the right side of your screen . 
  after you choose a playlist it will put you in a populated game of that type and at the end of each match you have a chance to get the same rewards you would from playing campaign or strikes . 
  unfortunately that 's not how math works . 
  the chest right at the entrance to the raid is only once per week as there is no hard mode setting for the opening encounter , i 'm not sure about the other 3 chests inside . 
  reddit is a fickle beast . 
  ^ ^ do ^ ^ it, 
  but do n't get your hopes up , askscience never answers any of my questions : c, 
  you squeaky jinx . 
  i 'm completely correct . 
  people are downvoting me because they do n't understand , i 'm just providing information . 
  each item gives a 10 % bonus to your characters current amount of reputation they receive . 
  normal : 100 %, 
  1 item : 100 % + ( 100 * .1 ) = 110 %, 
  2 items : 110 % + ( 110 * .1 ) = 121 %, 
  3 items : 121 % + ( 121 * .1 ) = 133 %, 
  it 's multiplicative , confirmed below . 
   for example , you need the crucible rewards to be rng . 
  if the top performers were simply given the best rewards , they would simply out pace everyone too much, 
  i think there are so many solutions they could implement that would be better than the 100 % randomness that is currently in place , as it offers literally 0 reward for even playing the match instead of sitting afk . 
  one possible implementation could be that the top 1 - 3 players of each match ( depending on how many total players ) were guaranteed * something * . 
  just make it so they have a 100 % chance to get a piece of loot , and let the rng take away from there . 
  they can also keep every other player all the way to last place at the same spot they are now , with a * chance * to get loot after every match regardless of performance , but this would still reward active players for participating . 
  that 's fine . 
  reward bad - average players the same , but provide some kind of tangible benefit to those who excel . 
  anyone who is playing pvp and not already using an auto or fusion rifle clearly does n't understand the game so i would n't worry about them joining the fotm . 
  for sure dude , well after my next match i 'll look down from first place and remember the moral high ground you have due to using a less optimal weapon class . 
  what , how could they not know ? 
  it would take like 4 minutes to buy one of those emblems and test it , i do n't trust this at all . 
   plus this sub ca n't even decide on what it dislikes . 
  first , loot is too hard to get ( which is complete bullshit anyway ) . 
  then loot is too easy to get ( `` now everyone has the suros regime instead of just my special ass '' ) . 
  it 's almost like there 's more than one person that posts on this subreddit . 
  yeah i read the whole thing waiting for the `` crackpot theory '' part . 
  this is just the truth of what happened , and what is standard among competitors as well . 
  last i heard they were supplying the red coats during the revolutionary war . 
   blah blah blah excuses excuses excuses, 
  kind of quick to write off one of the most intelligent and successful regime leaders in recent history . 
  history is written by the winners, 
  tl ; dr : hitler underestimated the ussr and overestimated italy .
