  repairs on later ones are money pits . 
  it takes more to take in people then houseing ... like food and places to poop that wont get clogged up from long term use ... 
  wholesale destroying of the planet is what organisms do . 
  animals do it , but in such a way other things use their waste . 
  humans just happened to be good enough and plentiful enough to make non useful waste in large enough quantities to wreak havoc . 
  i want to know as well . 
  im currently getting my certs . 
  well im kinda bluffing , im in my first semester of community college . 
  i should be getting my a + in january , and im going to switch my major from network engineering to security . 
  the security degree program was just introduced last week . 
  ( the same exact classes and certs , and then some . 
  plus a fancier degree name ), 
  the base concepts and some of the technology behind it to make someone who thinks computers are magic boxes understand and comprehend what a social network is and how to use the user interface of facebook . 
  price , performance , everything . 
  however the ps4 has some good exclusives . 
  ( infamous : second son is best ! ), 
  not bad actually . 
  i get 60/25 here in nj , but we also have 2 providers in the area . 
  if you use used parts certainly you can . 
  even new it is only slightly more expensive . 
  but after you factor in a few of the extra costs with consoles it evens out . 
  people have systems that cost that much because you can upgrade parts of it over time and it does n't seem as much . 
  my first pc cost 350 bucks , and ive upgraded it a lot when i had the cash , but i would still be happy with the performance of my old parts if i had to . 
  my budget build would be able to play fallout 4 most likely , and it played gta v on high settings with 40 fps, 
  old rig : fx6300 ( still have it ) , gtx 480 , 8x1 gb of ddr3 ram , some old 200 gb hard drive . 
  well if you buy used parts then it is cheaper ,

  and you can get a case from any old pc . 
  monitor , free - $ 10 at thrift stores . 
  headphones , the same ones you use for your phone . 
  or just use your tv . 
  keyboard , 4 dollars at a thrift store and mouse is about 2 or 3 . 
  pc gaming is not for everyone , but it is n't expensive . 
  and if you do n't want to play any of the games that require a nice pc , then do n't get one . 
  since water came from the sky in winter . 
  yea , he was 14 . have you meet most 14 year olds ? 
  i once took a battery and a speaker to school ( at 13 so a little younger ) and i kept touching the terminals back and forth to watch the diaphram move with the reveresed polarity . 
  everyone who sat near me thought i was a genuious and it was kinda sad . 
  it is still september , so the kids in their freshman year are basiclly 8th graders . 
  pentium 4 's can really surprise you , especially the 3.2 ghz models . 
  we ran out last year mid winter , and my road in hamilton ( next to trenton ) is always salted like 3 times during a storm . 
  most of eggs you see in the store are the perfect of the perfect . 
  all the ones that look fucked up like that are used in other things , like powedered egg or cartoned egg , or in prepackaged food products like breads and such . 
  you see , i do n't care about what i did . 
  it was dumb , but the point was people of that age are just starting to figure out the basics so if he could take off the case and hot glue the guts to a cool newer case it shows he is leagues ahead of his peers . 
  he is not a marvel , but he is starting to get the right idea . 
  the people setting them up are not the ones drinking it ... 
  if they all turn a profit then why not ? 
  most people do n't have access to that , parents who care about their child having access to that , or they are so babied that they ca n't touch tools ... 
  my cat just died today of old age ... the feels :(, 
  this happened to me with my cat , except where when he decided to die and when he died was 4 days apart . 
  he spent the last days being pet by all of us . 
  he passed finally 3 hours ago . 
  i guess it was legal , but everyone thought it was n't and if anyone started to practice it then it would have been noticed and stopped sooner . 
   when a crt tries to display higher resolutions it does have an input lag , so when the technology switched to 16:9 standard , lcd became the better option . 
  crt 's are still used in fighting games because 4:3 v 16:9 is n't as important as input lag . 
  wot . . thats not how that works ... 
  the new jersey dmv does n't check anything but the check engine light anymore . 
  you are assuming that fuel for the planes would be avalible in real quanities, 
  we used to have some of the toughest regulations in the country , then the governor cut all of them like 3 years ago . 
  well i just turned 18 so i did n't vote for christie , but i hope the next one is better . 
  is it a nice place  ( i live in hamilton , next to trenton so we get to see christie mess up only a few miles away yay ! ), 
  and about the gas thing . 
  it 's kinda nice having other people pump it for you , plus it gives a bunch of minimum wage jobs that would n't be there otherwise . 
  a fast core 2 duo can still hold its own , and might fit the motherboard ( same socket , but they are not all compadable check ) . 
  a e8500 is still speedy and only 10 bucks . 
  match that with a gtx 460 for around 40 bucks and you are rocking something not bad . 
  still a nice card . 
  by little brother is rocking one with a e8400 . 
  my fx-6300 is amazing for what i paid for it , but the single threaded performace is awful . 
  does n't matter much however because of my 45-60 fps in gta v on ultra and really cool temps even overclocked to 4.3 ghz, 
  just activate before doing any updates then update and upgrade to legit windows 10, 
  when was this ? 
  those gas prices are outragous . 
  i sometimes lag out on minecraft due to it all being done on core 03 . 
  i have seen this too . 
  hamilton and trenton cops are the nicest ever , as long as you are not shooting someone they will let you off with a warning . 
  bordentown and princton cops are assholes . 
  but it 's not ... it 's the 775 socket so it is smaller . 
  well thats what people really are . 
  with some crunchy bits and anger . 
  pro-country and the ideals that the country was founded on and try to uphold . 
  better economy = less total fuel used = better for long term . 
  if you cant patent it then why would a company put out the money to develop a drug ? 
  out of the kindness of their hearts ? 
  but having that guaranteed return would lead to drug companies making loads of drugs that do n't have a spot in the market . 
  imagine 37 diffrent drugs that all do the same job , some if which worse then current ones , just to have new lines of products to get that guaranteed return on it . 
  exactly , thats why red glare has a flat display in lonesome road . 
  edit : wait why the downvotes . . ? 
  red glare , the newly developed missile launcher , has a flat display that would only be able to exist with the transistor . 
  which would make sense . 
  new military technology always gets to use new technologies . 
  food production does n't have the same capital requirements , neither do children , or air for that matter . 
  to do basic things , more advanced stuff . . it 's not harder , just different .
