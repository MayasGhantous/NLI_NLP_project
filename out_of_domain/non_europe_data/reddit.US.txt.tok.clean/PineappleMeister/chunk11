  can we still have individual threads for games like last time ( ps4 event ) ? 
  some games will probably be announce tomorrow should have their own threads . 
  did n't you read ? 
  they are removing all post from the event . 
  i 'm asking that games be exempted and be allow to be posted . 
  cool , i will send all the people who post this type of threads in / r/tech there when i remove their post . 
  the circular vent wo n't be on the side . 
  in the blur image it look like was standing vertically that would block the vent . 
  that was a good game . 
  this is a very miss manage subreddit which is why there 's so little participation . 
  there are we have almost 2 times the subscribers / r/orioles has but if you look at their [ game threads ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/orioles/search?q=game+thread&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on ) they are almost all 400 + comments . 
  looks like the nes . 
  is the tv thing only with comcast ? 
  true seeing again the similarities are fewer than i thought . 
  remove , this has nothing to do with the ps4 . 
  yes you can posted as a comment on the thread . 
  remove , this has nothing to do with the ps4 . 
  there should be a bot making all the game threads like many of the other subs but i doubt that will change anytime soon from the look of things here . 
  [ the greatest . 
  remove , this has nothing to do with the ps4 . 
  no it has n't . 
  in the settings check if you have it so that it hides every link you upvote . 
  not with css , but you can probably use a bot for that . 
  that 's possible ? 
  how would you assign a flair automatically with css ? 
  ahh that i knew i thought you were talking about flairs but still thanks . 
  no one know anything yet , you are going to have to wait . 
  any answer ms has put out , some one else on the company say the opposite . 
  it is less than a month to e3 so patience, 
  remove , this has nothing to do with the ps4 . 
  well not sure how relevant that would be , none of those business make their profits predominantly on used games . 
  do n't think they release the numbers for used games sales but gamestop 's market share of new game sales is just below 50 %, 
   the company has grabbed market share of 47.7 % for new ps3 and xbox 360 software . 
  edit : make  market, 
  it was phil harrison ( vice president microsoft corporate ) that gave that answer so i would n't call that a rumor , but he did tried to clarify it , but that clarification had to ~ ~ then ~ ~ be `` clarify '' . 
  it was an unfair play !, 
  here is my shitty cut out if you want to use it , it 's even worse because imgur is converting it into a jpg ( guessing is a size issue ) but i do n't want open ps again so this is best i can do . 
  [ i submitted the same thing but got downvote ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/photoshopbattles/comments/1f2i2x/baseball_players_after_a_walkoff_insidethepark/ ) < there is a high res image / and shitty cut out if you wan to use it . 
  anyways here is my submission and have an upvote . 
  to be honest i expected a reddit name like that to be nsfw . 
  nice !, 
  would love to get wiki controls running on some of the reddits i mod / r/nasa / r/youtube / r/awesome . 
  i need it mostly for flairs so you can take your time setting it up and thank you , the bot is wonderful !, 
  not exactly they make the most profits ( they have a higher profits margin ) from it but not the most of its money , sony financial holdings only accounts for ~ 14 % of the companies revenue . 
   mr. loeb 's prescriptions for sony are shortsighted , merely milking the company 's profit-making content business for good money to throw after the bad . 
  i agree with this and so does sony it seems but i wager he just wants quick gains for himself instead of the long term benefit of the company . 
  `` yes '' but the point is that to think that sony is life insurances company would be wrong , and the title suggest that . 
   i think the title and the article both made the point that sony needs to do some serious reworking if they want to keep their electronics business relevant and on the path to making money again . 
  oh do n't get me wrong i agree with this . 
   the article also was in favor or splitting the company into three businesses in order to accomplish that . 
  i just disagree with this , i 'm think they would be better off making profits on their electronic division by leveraging all the divisions instead just focusing on selling life insurance just because it 's profitable . 
  thank you !, 
  ahh thanks , did n't even notice it . 
  i think that 's from when you are using a free trial ... 
  there is one in the long island city which is in the nyc . 
  not with css , you can use a bot or you can require links to have nsfw in the title . 
  now that i see this i wish i had n't used ps for new / r/nasa alien, 
  [ the old one is a . ai file though ] ( https://i.minus.com/ibepgwaxfaku2i.png ), 
  [ but the new one a is ps file ] ( https://i.minus.com/ibuuxmiq4g5spf.png ), 
  this is the biggest image i can get from it and it does n't look that good because i did n't think i would ever use it on this sizes or anywhere near it 's size . 
  edit : ... 
   any chance someone in the subreddit could recreate a vector version of it ? 
  not sure but i can ask but i feel it will be unlikely since we are a small sub , but i will make a thread later today . 
  when will submission to this be over ? 
  dude , i love you !, 
  thank you so much . 
  will send it to the admin right way . 
  try / r/colorization, 
  oh btw i send you an email with the vector [ diamond ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/1fcq5k/moderators_submit_your_subreddits_snoo_to_be/ca9w50j ) made but now i remenber i did n't include my username or the files directly . 
  i just realized that it would have been easier to message you from reddit ... hope it was ~ ~ that ~ ~ ok ?

  [ also this is the same whale ( i think ) , from a different angle . 
  comes from the same source . 
  ] ( https://secure.flickr.com/photos/markandrupa/5588183452/in/photostream/ ), 
  because i was having problems with flicker ( it crash and was slow ) . 
  thanks , though the only things that have been posted so far has been spam lots of spam , need to get it on the sidebar of a bigger sub to get traffic here : /, 
  #header {, 
  background : transparent url ( ) no-repeat center ;, 
  position : relative ;, 
  what did you expect ? 
  try this but i do n't know what you want so blind guess here . 
  a [ href $ = `` http://www.link.com '' ] {, 
  background-repeat : no-repeat ;, 
  display : inline-block ;, 
  position : relative ;, 
  top :120 px ; / * whatever the top is * /, 
  you can used something like this will need modification though . 
  you need to add the link to the sidebar also , forgot that . 
  edit : second comment is better than my , use that . 
  ~ ~ should only work on the like between the '' '' but i could be wrong . ~ ~ i miss read your comment but yea you need . side to specify where you want the link to turn into an image .

  you know reporting a mod post wo n't get the post remove ... 
  either you link to wrong article or you are reading that wrong . 
  also that article is from february here is the latest news .

  no , we did n't consider it , '' said yoshida .
