  it makes sense for people to have internet connections to play online games , but for offline games there are many countries that we saw \\ [ that \\ ] do not really have robust internet . '' ] ( http://www.gamespot.com/news/sony-rules-out-always-online-for-ps4-report-6408071 ), 
  also how is it in line with what ms is doing ? 
  sony is in no way requiring you to have internet , and all drm in games has always been a publisher 's decision ( ei ea only passes , ubisoft drm thing ) , that 's the thing being left to publishers as state in your article is `` sony 's game studios chief , shuhei yoshida , told reporters that any requirement for users to register a game online in order to play it would be left to game publishers '', 
  now all of this could change but as of now your comment is false . 
  no , g4 is dead and spike will only be doing the ms and the ea conferences . 
  after the e3 , there may be changes made to it to make it look more like the ps4 os/style , ( at the very least many things that are broken now like the upvotes which i hate , will be fix ) we may take suggestions on what people want the sub to look like around the when we do the changes . 
  also if you could look at our traffic stats you would see this is not the sub newcomers visit first ( compare to other ps subs ) , but i agree that it should be more welcoming and be a center of playstation on reddit .

  in the thread we will make sure to post all possible online streaming options . 
  but it sucks that it wo n't be on tv i always had g4 on when e3 was happening . 
  i actually created the css on / r/awesome , anyways i can help you with it tomorrow , but i 'm on a tablet so ca n't help you now . 
  the other way around . 
  also have you try getting control of / r/fiat ? 
  you would probably get more user that way , like / r/toyota , / r/bmw or other subreddits base of car brands, 
  send a message to / r/fiat ( [ just click here to send the message but first read the sidebar of redditrequest ] ( http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2ffiat ) ), 
  if no one replys , go to / r/redditrequest and follow the the sidebar rules , it takes about 10 days to see if you get it or not . 
  sure why not ~ ~ request ~ ~ invite send .

  it is not being broadcasted on tv . 
  but it will probably be on youtube like the ps4 event in february .

  they could still do that people seem to forget that tgs and gamescom are still coming later this year . 
  agree , it looks like these `` journalist '' manufacturing a controversy , when tretton ( sp ) said in the conference that the ps4 will maintain the same policy of the ps3 . 
  to paraphrase, 
  `` the ps4 will not have any new restrictions ... we believe in the model people embrace today with ps3 '', 
  this is why i hate all of tech `` journalism '',

  yes but you still need to resubmit it . 
  it will most likely support more than 1 person , the reason the girl was n't on the audio chat was because she was using the phone app hence why she was n't talking . 
  the article has been update , making the title misleading . 
  actually sony got playstation 3 certification in china , the banned on consoles is most likely ending . 
  developers can release their games with xbla/psn only and they would n't need deal with second hand sales . 
  agree , i do n't see ms letting gears go to the ps , i do n't know if ms owns the ip since epic is not a first party studio but if they do n't i bet ms sends them bags full of money just to keep it exclusive and will most likely continue to do so in the future . 
  still unless gears stops selling consoles , ms will continue to drop comically large bags of money at epics offices that it will remain a exclusive . 
  maybe this is real , but i still think it is fake until like toasterp said we see more than just this image . 
  google fiber customer ? 
  yes , i am going to get it but unless i can remove the kinect ( since that has always been my main problem with it ) i am still going to wait for a price drop . 
  gorilla glass is just a brand for toughened glass it is not necessarily better than other toughened glass . 
  although i would n't pay anywhere near $ 1,500 for a any phone let alone a z. 
   # 1 glass manufacturer in the world, 
  source ? 
   every fiber company and installation ( from fios to google fiber ) uses corning fiber . 
  i doubt that . 
   corning is significantly better at making glass than anywhere in the world . 
   they know their shit and they dominate the industry in quality . 
  gorilla glass is from the 1950/60s , the patents are mostly expire by now . 
  most toughened glass is build same ( not that they are manufacture the same but they probably all aluminosilicate glass like corning gg . ), 
  i 'm not saying gorilla glass is bad ( because is not ) but it 's mostly a brand name , and afaik there is nothing specifically special about it . 
  why link to blog spam instead of the source ? 
  anyways it does looks similar to the other leaks pics and if the specs are real the this will be a very nice phone . 
  http://www.phonearena.com/news/is-this-the-sony-i1-honami_id44622#3 -, 
  i do n't think sony manufactures the 808 pureview sensors , ( i could be wrong but i remember them trash talking it when it was announced ) , so why would they be using that sensor ? 
  anyways this is supposedly a pic of, 
  http://www.phonearena.com/news/is-this-the-sony-i1-honami_id44622#3 -, 
   the camera is nothing more than marketing . 
  marketing for something unannounced , that we do n't even know if it is real , what ? 
  anyways everything is just rumor/leaks at the moment . 
  but here from a different leak , this is a size comparison and if all the leaks are to be believe the sensor it is supposedly 1/1 .6 '' exmor rs stacked sensor . 
  first sinofsky got booted after the windows 8 debacle ( oh and j allard ) , now mattrick ? 
  ms is running out execs that i know the names of ... 
  that would be interesting but did n't he leave because ms unwillingness to make any product does n't run windows ? 
  if i remember he left after the courier was canceled in favor of a windows tablet ( windows 8 ) , i 'm not sure that culture has change within ms , although sinofsky is out , they still have the mentality that windows should be on everything . 
  but would be really great for ms if they he does come back to the company . 
  left  leave, 
  here this is basically what you need . 
  this goes in the sidebar change all of the google links to your link . 
  [ sample ] ( http://www.google.com ), 
  you also need something like this to move the sidebar down and make a space for it, 
  . side { margin-top : 60px ; }, 
  and this is what code for the button you need to adjust the it to work in you sub . 
  . side . md a [ href = `` http://www.google.com '' ] {, 
  color : #fff ;, 
  background : blue ;, 
  position : absolute ;, 
  top : 120px ; / * change this to fit your sub * /, 
  z-index : 9999 ;, 
  . side . md a [ href = `` http://www.google.com '' ] : hover { background : red ; }, 
  the problem with that is that the sidebar moves when you try to make a search but that button wo n't move with sidebar . 
  you can hide the searchexpando and add margin-top to the title box creating a space between the submit button and the title and place it . 
  the sibar wo n't move without the searchexpando but i do n't recommend it . 
  it is best if you move the submit button to the top of the search as well if you want them to be together . 
  the creator of the xbox , left the company after ms cancel his courier tablet project ( although he has said the cancellation was unrelated with him leaving ) . 
  btw you are shadowbanned , you may want to send a message to the admins via / r/reddit . com, 
  what did you prefer from the old look ? 
  because it 's not that different to what we used to have . 
  ohh maybe you are confusing this sub with [ / r/ps4 ? 
  this one here . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wf0nmeo.png ) yea that one got pulled and since it was not getting use and i didnt want to wasted all time spent on it so i incorporated many of the changes from that to this sub . 
  edited for clarity, 
  [ source video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paauuj8qt_g ), 
  you ca n't use that font , i told you last time you post ( in fairness i did n't explain it , just gave you the code ) that the best way to do it is to use images , go to photoshop/gimp etc , and make an image for each individual menu tabs . 
  you can then make it into a sprite image , ( but that 's is not necessary you can use them all individually ) . 
  as i said before if you get the images i 'm willing to do the rest of the work for you . 
  i have always found it interesting that this is the only industry that consumers feel that they have the right to profit from someone else 's intellectual properties . 
  they caught one . 
  hah cano was n't boo that much this time at least ... 
  this year fuck this year,
