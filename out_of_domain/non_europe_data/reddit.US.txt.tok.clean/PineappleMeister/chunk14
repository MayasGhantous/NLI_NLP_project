  what an asshole . 
  `` got away '' ... what a load of bs . 
  heheheheheheehehheheehehehehehehehehehe, 
  think cc will be back next inning ? 
  oh shit i thought it was the 9th inning . 
  this feels like it has been a long game . 
  everyone calm down !!!!, 
  ohwait it is just me . . 
  edit : woot woot, 
  we have one on the sidebar of / r/ps4 ( not sure but it may be outdated , and will definitely be outdated by tomorrow 's conference . ), 
  the os/ui !, 
  andrew house is from scea , this press conference is from scee . 
  i think you can watch it on ps home . 
  twitch !, 
  well that sucks for the blue jays . 
  wait what happen ? 
  did kuruda give up 3 homers ? 
  ( i was n't paying attention ), 
  do n't use url shorteners your comment will get stuck in the spam filter . 
  please edit your comment . 
  yea . . no that 's never happening over something like this , playstation business is too important for rs , to sue sony over some soundtracks/game audio being leak . 
  where would one get a case like that black one ? 
  w/o having to go to war to get one preferably . 
  woot but cano where you running to !, 
  overbay is batting ... , who do we have in the bench ? 
  edit : knew it . 
  edit : hell yea !, 
  it apparently has a big battery and a big camera on top but it is also thin . 
  the zl was considerably fatter to accommodate for being smaller with a smaller bezel than the z. 
  damn it . 
  is that ichiro 's first error ? 
  also hughes is terrible . 
  edit : when and look , it is his second for 2013 . 
  ahh astroturf should be banned from baseball . 
  owners being cheap . 
  although i heard the blue jays are going to replace it next year . 
  ( i think ), 
   with ps + the ps3 will automatically download any updates for the system and games , so i assume the ps4 will do the same . 
  you wo n't need ps + for automatic updates on the ps4 . 
  wtf !!!!!!, 
  edit : ~ ~ in the replay it looked like stewart close his eyes before the ball got there ... ~ ~, 
  looks like this is a normal reaction . 
  they do ? 
  i have n't notice . 
  i have seen them blink if the batter swings , but this is the first time i have pay close attention . 
  can someone tell me why companies ca n't disallow , others from profiting from the use of their intellectual properties ? 
  do n't tell me it is because the youtubers are `` advertising '' the game because nintendo or square enix never ask youtubers to advertise it . 
  and do n't tell me that the commentary makes it an fair to use , because that is bs . 
  remember mystery science theater 3000 ? 
  they had to license the movies they did commentary on and go try to rebroadcast the superbowl with your own commentary , lets see if their lawyers will take those arguments as valid . 
  no has yet to give me a valid argument for why the gaming community feels it 's so special that it does n't need follow ip laws . 
  reading some of the comments on past threads and the rants from `` pro '' streamers , saying that they would boycott nintendo and se , it 's like saying the ca n't do it . 
   whether you want to hear it or not , they are advertising the game, 
  i agree to a certain extent and with certain types of games but imo giving the full story of a story driven game it is n't advertising infact i would argue it does the opposite of what advertising is supposed to do . 
   no , se did n't ask them to ... and they can , legally , tell them they ca n't do it if they want , but it 's not a very good idea . 
  my point is why is it a bad idea ? 
  no other industry needs youtubers to sell their media for them . 
  and if when they send a cease and desist you do n't have a hundred of rabid fanboys calling for a boycott of the company . 
  also they are cream corn points out they are not stopping people from doing the videos they are just saying they ~ ~ can ~ ~ ** ca n't ** make money from it . 
  i thought davis face looked weird but looks like he is just chewing something . 
  nobody does , no one :|, 
  damn !, 
  soriano is amazing right now !, 
  cc better not blow it again . 
  ahh do n't take him out let cano bat first !, 
  hehe, 
  please take out cc . 
  edit : woot . 
  edit3 : woot . 
  doubt they will move jeter to the back of the line up . 
  damn so close . 
  we should pinch hit for jeter . 
  i fear he is hitting into a dp . 
  edit : good he was productive . 
  i 'm done with this game . 
  wow that looks terrible . 
  hoping it is fake because it looks like a they `` miniaturize '' ( still looks giant ) a gs4 and put it on a band . 
  the [ pebble ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dh66ucx.jpg ) and [ the sony thing ] ( http://i.imgur.com/kw7jqmu.jpg ) ( forgot what is it call ) look much better . 
  edit : remember that samsung phone watch thing http://i.imgur.com/1lwvmy4.jpg that looks better than this . 
  edit2 : the [ source ] ( http://venturebeat.com/2013/09/01/this-is-samsungs-galaxy-gear-smartwatch-a-blocky-health-tracker-with-a-camera/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=feed%3a+venturebeat+%28venturebeat%29 ) in the engadget blogspam it has much better pictures , op should had submitted that . 
  why do people always post the blog spam instead of the original source , there 2 blogspam post about this on the front page one from engadget and this one . 
  [ go to the source which is the same for both articles it is a much better piece ] ( http://venturebeat.com/2013/09/01/this-is-samsungs-galaxy-gear-smartwatch-a-blocky-health-tracker-with-a-camera/ ) . 
  apart from that i said in the other post i hope it is fake because it looks like a they `` miniaturize '' still looks big a gs4 and put it on a band . 
  the [ pebble ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dh66ucx.jpg ) and [ the sony thing ] ( http://i.imgur.com/kw7jqmu.jpg ) ( forgot what is it call ) look better also that [ samsung phone watch concept ] ( http://i.imgur.com/1lwvmy4.jpg ) looks better than this . 
  i expect this to hit 120-150 by black friday / christmas although i dislike this model i would pick it up for that price . 
  wow , i 'm feeling bad for the white sox . 
  oh shit it 's the 4th , i did n't notice ... 
  damn it , did n't see the play !, 
  and they now show the wrong replay , fuck . 
  nope , it the magnetic charging/dock cable . 
  also the lens thing is using wireless as it also compatible with other android phones and the iphone . 
  here are more pics on how the lens will be mounted . 
   the quality of discussion does not really matter , though , if there is no place to discuss things other than news , and the quantity of self-posts here on / r/games has significantly declined over the last year . 
  on august 2nd , 2012 there were 10 self-post discussions on / r/games in the top 25 , today there is one, 
  this year is a console launch year , i do n't it is comparable . 
  there going to be more news and more people wanting to know about the news . 
  but i welcome some of the ideas there . 
  this reminds me of the bloatware in windows laptops , `` thankfully '' some for windows manufacturers you could pay like $ 50 for a business/clean version . 
  i 'm hope this does n't become the norm or at least they should offer a clean version ( maybe like a google play edition ), 
  apart from the nu\u00f1ez play this has all been on kuroda .
