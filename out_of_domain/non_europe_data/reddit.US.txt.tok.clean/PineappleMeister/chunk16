  we do n't disallow people posting their videos , that has never been a rule . 
  that 's why we approve youtube videos as long as they are on youtube . 
  it 's in the sidebar that you can post videos . 
  but i will see if people want videos remove . 
  i 'm just saying that has never been a rule , as the post says . 
  we always allow videos it 's even on his screenshot . 
  see the sidebar . 
   this subreddit is for discussion around youtube features , bugs , channels , personalities , ** videos ** , and trends . 
  it would be a lot easier for us mods to not allow videos, 
  wait we put in joba ... wtf have we given up ? 
  ... you, 
  in all fairness he probably ended his career too . 
  anyone have a link to the original video ? 
  that is one of those rehosting channels and the quality of the video is atrocious . 
  as for the game did n't know it was co-op ( is it local ? ), 
  gameplay looks weird ( i think it maybe the camera ) thought although as far as i know it 's not coming anytime soon so hopefully they `` fixed '' that . 
  that 's just a pic that i had around , as i said in the post , you guys are going to pick the image . 
  well that 's the season . 
  agree , also it is good that they are sticking to what makes steam and valve great but if i do n't have an incentive to buy not sure why i would consider this , guessing it is not for me and for a casual player that does n't build their own setup . 
   i 'm pretty happy with my pc gaming setup , do i have to buy a new piece of hardware now ? 
  everything that we 've been doing on steam for the last 10 years will continue to move forward . 
   and will also update to display if a user types your subreddit name into the subreddit selection box on any submit page around the site , not just from inside your subreddit itself . 
  this part is awesome , thank you !, 
  woot came on at t-1min , thanks op . 
  to make it even worse it was actually 9 ** perfect ** innings that pedro pitched . 
  shit wish i had gotten popcorn . 
  gravity looks good . 
  shit i was on that other thread w/o realizing this was the episode thread . 
  what were you expecting it to be like ? 
  i really like it so far . 
  pedro 's english is a lot better than i thought . 
  this is a good game , go texas go !, 
  why do they keep showing the ss i was n't paying close attention but look a couple of times at the tv and they were showing him , did he have an error ? 
  ah i must have miss it , thanks . 
  [ source . 
  incase you wanted it , like me . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2shkyq5ycu ), 
  the pitch trax thing is either broken or the ump is calling strikes on balls way off the plate . 
  wow that 's how you break it . 
  why did they choose the reliever that lost the game last time is that their ( stl ) best reliever ? 
  well that 's a good reason . 
  oak is going to waste this chance . 
  hehehe, 
  i 'm rooting for the pirates but this does n't look good :(, 
  shit call, 
   they do wear red ... 
  i think you are confusing the - ism . 
  whelp it seems like i ca n't pick a winning team , first the pirates and now the a 's ... but honestly i thought it was a bad decision to start gray , they should had started colon and bring in gray as a reliever if needed . 
  looks they wo n't pitch to hanley ramirez this whole game . 
  oh shit it 's 1am , i did n't even notice it was so late here , i 'm also out after this inning . 
  well , i have the shitties luck picking teams this post season . 
  picked the pirates to win it all , were doing great before i started following them but nope . 
  after that picked the a 's to win it all but again nope . 
  then i said , well i want a dodgers vs redsox world series . 
  both team have not won a game since i chose them ... 
  hehehe , i 'm still holding hope for a dodgers vs redsox world series but if it does n't happen ... 
  i kinda like the cardinals . 
  lets go cardinals [ * ] ( http://dodgers.reddit.com `` let me test this . 
  '' ) , i 'm hoping it 's a good game . 
  woot , let 's go cardinals !, 
  the cardinals are doing great !, 
  lets keep this going . 
  lets go cardinals . 
  it was a good game , but the cardinals had some terrible plays but did n't matter since they did n't score . 
  i for one will continue to root for the cardinals . 
  this makes me want a killzone movie . 
  hell i would take a low budget original psn series if it looked like that . 
  yea , kinda like netflix original series . 
  verlander looks great . 
  tigers should win this game . 
  [ my plan ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/1odfoi/game_chat_1013_alcs_game_2_tigers_red_sox_800_pm/ccr6may?context=3 ) , [ it 's ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/1ofui1/game_chat_1014_nlcs_game_3_cardinals_dodgers_800/ccrrtl5?context=3 ) , [ working !,

  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/yeawm.png `` this post will probably get like 10 downvotes '' ), 
  why ? 
  it 's still early but still lets go cardinals . 
  come on cardinals !, 
  get it together . 
  puig and kershaw are having a terrible game . 
  i wo n't say they are having a terrible game but that wacha is pitching a great game . 
  ( in all fairness their best player has crack rib ... ), 
  whelp , there goes my dodgers vs redsox ws . 
  context ? 
  speaking of ads i think have either adblock or ghostery configure wrong . 
  i keep getting the same subreddits ads sometimes i get an outside ( regular ) ad but almost never i 'm probably blocking those ... 
  hahahaha , that was hilarious . 
  this case aside since i do n't know all the details . 
  do you guys really believe that companies have no right to block people from making profits from videos of their games ? 
  cause that 's what lots of highly upvoted comments here are saying ( and the video insinuates ) . 
  also lots of you going on about changing the copyright laws and stuff , but what would you put in the new law ? 
  do these new laws make lets play legal without any consent from the ip owner ? 
  and if so do these same laws apply to other media ? 
  movies , live sports event ? 
  many of you sound very naive and somehow feel that videogames are somehow special and ip owner should not have say in how their work is used . 
  i know that 's why i said * this * case aside . 
  but lots of the comments here are about copyright , the most upvote comments are almost all about copyright and youtube and one about sega and lets play videos . 
  any think we will find out what kill the kid in this episode , i think it is probably cholera or desenteria, 
  if i were them i would stay lock in my cell every night seem stupid not to . 
  wat just amputate the head . 
  wtf carol !!, 
  zombie pirates coming 2014,
