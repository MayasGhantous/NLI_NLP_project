  yep , deimorz got it working like this . 
  the comment area should n't be change imo it should stayed the default version . 
  fonts just looked weird . 
  the letter-spacing you have allover the place makes things hard to read . 
  the linkflairs are in a weird place and where much better before . 
  honestly i think what you had looked good , i would have change very few things and this is coming for someone that changes almost all the subs i mod by a lot ( / r/playstation , / r/nasa , / r/awesome ), 
  ms manufactures 360s in brazil wo n't surprise me they do the same with the xbox one . 
  * fonts are much better, 
  * still think letter-spacing makes thing hard to read . 
  * linkflairs still are in a bad place . 
  * not sure why you need this in . side , are you using it as margin ? 
  if so i think it would look better as white . 
  again these are just my opinion but the only thing i truly dislike the background of the comments can you keep the original color ? 
  or use the colors res uses ? 
  the current gray is too dark . 
  so much for good umpires ... 
  good call overturning a bad call , i take back my criticizing of the umps . 
  what is happening ?!!, 
  it will just probably update the drm version , doubt is has anything to do with a ` register ' , even regular br players need updates and those who do n't update ca n't play new movies . 
  the same thing as in the ps3 ? 
  i believe there is an option to deactivate ps3s via the web , account.sonyentertainmentnetwork.com ( long ass url , sony needs to buy a new domain ) . 
  i have never had the need to try it but the option to deactivate is there i just checked . 
  when i click on one of my individual ps3 consoles there is deactivate button on that page , i have never click on it . 
  so you are saying i ca n't just deactivate 1 of the consoles from the console page ? 
  not sure if this refers to custom * user created * themes , which the ps3 supports or all themes . 
  i would guess they would still have paid ones via the psn but not downloaded ones from the browser like you can currently do . 
  ortiz is playing first ? 
  this i much watch , i ca n't remember the last time i saw that . 
  bf4 is ea . 
  well peavy is not making it to the next inning . 
  wow what just happen , these announcers suck . 
  wow this is a terrible broadcast , shit is happening in the game and they are doing interviews ... 
  holy shit this is a blog spam of blog spam , you need to click 3 links to the to the original source . 
  does n't look like they are pitching to ortiz . 
  i 'm surprised peavy is still in the game . 
  why does everyone think it is something to do with ms/xbox ? , it could be about nintendo going under ( doubt it ) or someone in the industry passing away ( possible ) , hell it could be that asshole sony investor convince the board to sell the ps brand ( very much doubt it ) . 
  these are exaggerations but it could be anything , none of them hint about it being something to do with the xbox . 
  ca n't say i watch sox games much ... 
  i went with a more literal interpretation , but you could be right . 
  ahhh i want to know what it , someone should just say whatever it is ( but i guess they ca n't ) . 
  i do n't think they should leave martinez in for ortiz . 
  ohh wait it pedroia who is batting ... 
  hehe yea just laziness i knew it was quicker to spell iw and ea than iw and dice , sorry for the confusion . . 
  i know as i said those were exaggerations at the time i posted most comments were saying that it was something to do with ms/xbox / i made some exaggerated examples to illustrated my point that there was no evidence that it was about ms , which turn out to be correct . 
  wtf ... 
  i 'm always surprised how many people do n't get that the first amendment applies only to the government . 
  big papi looks tired in that shot . 
  why would you even put that up if it not about the weekend thing ? 
  most people will assume it is about that , it just makes them looked bad . 
  i doubt ortiz will be seeing any more pitches in a tied game ( if cardinals are smart ), 
  lets take bets pitch to papi or walk ? 
  and they decided to pitch to him, 
   over the next 10 days we will be refunding any and all money spent in the alpha . 
  if you have a question about your refund , please contact help.ea.com . 
  pretty cool . 
  was the alpha so bad that they had to cancel the whole as they said in the post ? 
  seems like the new ps4 os has very basic functionality ( probably to meet the launch deadline ) , however i hope they will update and add some of the stuff in the future , hopefully mp3 playback will be available soon . 
  ( actually i would prefer a spotify but app either one would be welcome ), 
  also here, 
   will ps4 support custom dynamic themes , as currently available on the ps3 system ? 
    no , ps4 will not support dynamic themes ** as they currently exist ** on the ps3 system . 
  does that mean we will get new ps4 specific themes ? 
  congrats , red sox ... 
  what 's with ortiz halmet ? 
  lol, 
  let go off the mic lady . . 
   i wanted to point out that , to me , the new digg.com website has been very successful at highlighting the thought-provoking articles that i would typically look for on truereddit . 
  because it is curated by a group of editors , nothing that hits their front page is because the users want it to be on the front page , this is fundamentally different than a reddit . 
   the front page of digg will also be editorially driven instead of entirely based on a digg score algorithm . 
  i got excited to see an all aluminium corvette but then i saw that ... imo that car is only worth what ever the rolling chassis is worth , i doubt he will find anyone to buy it for the way it looks . 
   we 're also happy to tell you about ** the first raft ** of xperia products that we 'll make android 4.4 kit, 
  it says `` the first raft '' so maybe there is a second raft ? 
  i 'm do n't buy the whole not wanting a non-korean game to be # 1 , i do n't think closing a fan art forum will have much of an effect on the game . 
  i think they are just trying to censor it in order to `` protect the children '' . 
  i did n't know sk was so backwards regarding the internet/games specially since they have some if not the best speeds of any nation . 
  had google it but you apparently need use your ssn to even use lots of korean sites or play games and porn is illegal ( yes you can go to prison for it ) ... 
   many south korean websites require the submission of a valid resident registration number in order for users to register an account . 
  this practice ties each registered account to a unique online identity , rather than allowing anonymous registration . 
  because only a few large websites allow alternate means of identification , such as an alien registration number or passport number , foreigners are unable to use many south korean websites . 
  also, 
   pornographic websites , books , writings , films , magazines , photographs or other materials of a pornographic nature are illegal in south korea , with laws strictly enforced . 
  possession of pornographic objects will result in a fine or a two-year prison sentence . 
  since 2009 , all pornographic websites are blocked by the south korean government . 
  do n't post personal information , it 's literally one of the few sitewide rules please follow it . 
  not always flower and a few other ps3 games that are coming to the ps4 have cross-buy so if you owned the vita or ps3 version on psn you get the ps4 one for free . 
  the examiner should not be allow to be submitted imo , it 's basically a blogger/wordpress blog anyone can write an `` article '' for that site . 
  also the forbes `` contributors '' thing is the same . 
   this has been in the terms and condition for a long time , it 's not enforced . 
   the same thing was said for ps3 games in the ps3 terms and condition .
