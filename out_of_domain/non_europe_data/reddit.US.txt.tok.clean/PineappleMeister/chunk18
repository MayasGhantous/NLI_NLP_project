   man people are seriously starving for any bad playstation news . 
  well and for xbox looking at that ryse post . 
   edit :, 
   here 's a link to the ps3 terms and condition with the same wording :, 
   [ link ] ( http://m.au.playstation.com/legal/detail/item223672/australia-playstation\u00ae3-software-usage-terms/ ), 
   and here 's a link from the 2009 version with the same wording :, 
   [ link ] ( https://web.archive.org/web/20091128093421/http://uk.playstation.com/legal/detail/item223670/uk-playstation\u00ae3-software-usage-terms/ ), 
   and here 's a link to the 2007 version with the same exact wording :, 
   [ link ] ( http://web.playstation.sk/terms/softwareusage.html ), 
   and i 'm sure if you check the other consoles tos 's you will find the same wordings from the 360 to the ps2 times . 
  stolen from / r/games . 
  they had this for the ps3 for a while , i used to get all my digital games that way ( i did n't buy many digital games at the time ) but one day it was gone not sure why . 
  so this is a very welcome addition . 
  it is just regular amazon for the most part but now there is a `` digital code '' option for playstation games and if you go to amazons games section there a psn digital code category . 
  yep , i thought i saw a the psn store built in the preview video . 
  so yea i was disappointed about that but at least it is fast and responsive ( at least for me ) which i was worried would n't be the case . 
  it works the same way as the ps3 . 
  it at the end of this page . 
  probably wo n't be that long nd has 2 teams now , and the uncharted team ( or amy hennig 's team ) has n't released anything since uncharted 3 ( 2011 ) .

   at the very least , sony has admitted it . 
  i 've read that the estimated production cost of a ps4 is about $ 380 but those numbers are often obscured by other sources of income . 
  source ? 
  are you talking about the quote from the cfo that said, 
   `` unlike ps3 , we are not planning a major loss to be incurred with the launch of ps4 '' cfo masaru kato on the company 's earnings call .

  which a some of tech publications took as sony making money on ps4 sold which is not what that means . 
  afaik sony has never admitted to making money on sold ps4s . 
  oh and estimated cost of thing are bs which do n't take into account many things like shipping , r&d , etc. 
   [ unlike the ps3 , sony is n't expecting to lose money on the playstation 4 - the verge .

  you probably read something like this which is wrong .

  why does n't it make sense ? 
  there were underwater zombies in the wwz book they ca n't drown . 
  `` iphone by yahoo '', 
  the bans are real but op is wrong . 
   [ microsoft has confirmed to the verge that it is handing out temporary xbox live bans for select gamers found to be using `` excessive '' foul language in content created with upload studio .

   when howard really needs to be professional he has shown that he can do it and 9/11 was a fine example of this . 
  are you joking ? 
  his broadcast that day is one of the most xenophobic bigoted things i have ever heard . 
  this is not professional in anyway . 
  removed : rule # 5 check / r/pcgamingtechsupport or / r/techsupport . 
   no discussions yet . 
  start one, 
  what does this do ? 
  what happens if i start one ? 
  edit looks like it just makes a reddit post . 
  i guess i should have expected that ... 
  rule # 6 : no questions about buying or building computers , including part questions , those go in / r/buildapc, 
  nice zero day account , guessing you are the same person who posted it to / r/ps4 . 
  anyways there no proof yet that any of this is real , and that twitter screenshot can be fake very easily http://i.imgur.com/rjncddu.png . 
  mods should tag this or remove it . 
  i have multiple accounts and one of them is a japanese account , i have n't been banned or anything , but you ca n't buy anything in the japanese store without a japanese cc # ( i think anyways ) i only dl demos from it . 
  did you only read the first paragraph ? 
  he says things are unfinished but the things he mentioned are not essential to the game ( gps longer , track maker , new sounds ) after the first paragraph the review is very positive he goes on how many tracks its has and how good it looks ( also how bad some models it look ) , that it supports many different wheels etc etc. 
  rule # 6 : no questions about buying or building computers , including part questions , those go in / r/buildapc, 
  it was made for gt6 mercedes decide to do a real life version of it , there is a real life gt6 corvette concept too . 
  would depend on your age ( or interest in cars ) , the audi incident happen in the 80s , and audi has become a very different company in the past decade . 
  the toyota case happen only a couple of years ago . 
   so let 's get this straight , now youtube content creators have no viable form of feedback ( horrible top comment system ) , will soon need to wait days for review before they can monetize ( which they have no reason to make videos they do n't monetize because it 's their job ) , and now can barely even have any content related to their medium whatsoever in their videos . 
  they do not own the copyrights to those games and are not entitled to monetize it without the consent of the copyright owner . 
  some comments are saying that the copyright notices are coming from other youtuber not the copyright holders which in that case it should be fixed , however , if it 's coming from the copyright owner , it 's their shit they can do that if you are using a game w/o their consent . 
  gamers are seriously the most entitle people of any industry . 
  no one says i wonder if i can monetize a rebroadcast of the superbowl but with my commentary , that should be ok right ? 
  right ? 
  no it would not and even suggesting it would get you laugh at . 
  but games are somehow different [ ? 
  ] ( #h `` i wonder how many downvotes this one will get , thinking -20 . yay alt hover text '' ), 
  in linear story driven games the story always stays the same like movies and sports . 
  also how can it be transformative because people play games differently ? 
  the simple fact is that everything that happens in a game , happens because a developer code the game to allow that to happen , there is no `` free will '' in games everything is predetermining by the code . 
  rule # 6 : no questions about buying or building computers , including part questions , those go in / r/buildapc, 
  that rule was temporary , for the launch week/s . 
  removed : rule # 5 check / r/pcgamingtechsupport or / r/techsupport . 
  thought you were making a joke , but apparently that 's a thing ... 
  i 'm not sure if i should be impress or not , but i think that 's awesome . 
  here is a link if anyone else when looking for the car thread . 
  how do you feel about the touch things in the controller and are they better than analog sticks ? 
  also now that you have used it , would you have paid money for the steambox ? 
  yea it has started looks like it will only be liveblog . 
  you are it , all other duplicate will be remove . 
  did n't they just made the biggest contract of the off season ? 
  you think they gave so much money to cano to not try and fill those seats ? 
  no this is not true , sony financial division which includes sony bank and sony life ( life insurance company ) only account for 13 % of revenue . 
  ( consumer electronics account for something like 45 % for example ) . 
  because of the way life insurance works they do/did make most of their profits from it ( at least they did ) at one point but i do n't know the recent numbers . 
  man so much misinformation came from those articles that said `` sony is a life insurance company etc '' that were popular a couple months back . 
  should be fixed now . 
  sorry about that . 
   second of all gddr5 is ** not physical ram ** it is video ram and is connected to the video card not the ram sticks and no way the ps4 has 8gbs of gddr5 .
