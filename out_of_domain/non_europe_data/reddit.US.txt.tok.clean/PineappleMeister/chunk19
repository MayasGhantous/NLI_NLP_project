  what ? 
  ... you do realize that gddr5 are just memory chips right ? 
  it has nothing to do with out preforming something else . 
  it 's even on that wiki link you just posted ... did you not read that before posting it ? 
  do n't personally attack other users . 
  [ subreddit rules ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/ps4/wiki/subreddit/rules ), 
  looks like not even the / r/gaming mods believe it is him they removed both of his post ... , hehehe . 
  / u/gabenewellbellevue i will approve your post in / r/pcgaming ^ ^ ^ even ^ ^ ^ if ^ ^ ^ it ^ ^ ^ breaks ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ rules ... 
  that has always been the case , not sure why people still complain . 
  i doubt anyone here would pay the amount of money that it would take for them to get away from the cable model and still make the same amount of money they do today . 
  best thing to do is to tell a friend that has cable and that you will pay for hbo and have them make you a cable user id . 
  do n't know but to give you an idea they get money per cable subscriber plus what they get when you order the channel . 
  given that there about 100 million cable subscriber in the us , that 's a lot of money that cable companies would n't pay them if they offer an \u00e0 la carte option . 
  remove this part `` thewire06-20 '' from that link , so i can approve your comment . 
  that is an affiliate link which is against the rules to post . 
   we need to change the text on our submission button, 
  you do that in the subreddit settings . 
   also if it is possible to add the square side on the right , instead of the standard triangular arrow side . 
  . morelink . nub { display : none ; }, 
  you can get them for ~ ~ 2 bucks ~ ~ 1.54 each on dx and it has free shipping . 
  i have bought from that site before , the stuff arrive fine . 
  you can use paypal ( i did ) so there is little risk . 
  yankees , 8 years , 200 million . 
  i was shock to learn a couple of months back that porn is actually illegal in sk . 
  your code . 
  border-color : # 357ae8 ! important ;, 
  background : none # 5ba2fd ! important ;, 
  background-image : linear-gradient ( # 5ba2fd , # 4b8adb ) ! important ;, 
  color : #fff ;, 
  font-weight : normal ;, 
  letter-spacing : 0 ;, 
  this is what you have for the text and link buttons , to change the color you need to remove the gradient ( unless you want a gradient , then just add another one there ) where it says background-image . 
  to change the color ( after removing the gradient ) , change this color code # 5ba2fd where it says background : none # 5ba2fd to the color you want . 
  by going to / r/usaolympics/about / stylesheet you can see the code but i used chromes inspect tool thing , and no i 'm not a bot . 
  yes , it is possible to do that . 
  you can just add flairs tor certain people via the moderation tool section of your subreddit . 
  if you want to customize those flairs then you need css, 
  nothing ? 
  if you want to add a flair just go to the flair edit section of your moderation tools and add the name . 
  if you want to used an sprite image , read this . 
  you need to edit the margin not padding , your margin-top for . side is 200px . 
  think of it this way :, 
  margin = outside, 
   cons, 
   relatively small display, 
  just came to post about that . 
  finished the very positive review but then they list the whole reason this phone was even made as con ... 
  i just do n't get this , it 's literally call small . 
  gopro with a potato filter ? 
  you can use : nth-child and : nth-of-type for this . 
  something like this would change the second table row . 
  . side table tr : nth-child ( 2 ) { color : red ; }, 
   correct me if i 'm wrong , but if this is local emulation what prevents you from popping in your ps3 blu-rays and having it emulate ? 
  or are they changing things in the code regardless so `` technically '' its `` different '' and hence more money out of our pockets ? 
  because it 's only supports ps1/ps2 ? 
  i very much doubt they will be able emulate the ps3 anytime soon . 
  also this article does n't say anything about pricing structure . 
  this sounds like it 's different from psnow ( afawk that is only for streaming ) , this could postetically be for any ps1/2 psn game i would be very disappointed if they did n't carry over . 
  now i see i still mod / r/dinoballs ... 
  i should really go there and demod myself ... 
  i think that was a straight to video movie ( already release i think ) i saw the trailer it looked like shit , very different from the r&c movie and this . 
  i can see this thing selling lots of units . 
  they will put it on the front page of amazon , why do you think they sell loads of kindle fire tablets that thing is their front page almost daily . 
  also depending on the price this maybe a good alternative to a roku/apple tv i can see many people picking one up just for that . 
  that 's not the same , ouya does n't say amazon in the front of it , product awareness + brand awareness is what sell products in big numbers . 
  to all those who get in , checkout / r/playstationnow . 
  after looking at the \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 of the page i found that lambeosaurus is actually \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 and they trying \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 , this post is clear \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 / r\\/dino \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 \u2588 . 
  i 'm not sure what samsung would do with those patents , i mean google has n't gotten any benefit from them in their court case and almost all of the valuable motorola patents are frand patents so it 's not like they are getting in on some exclusive thing . 
  although , this is good for us are consumers but i do n't see how it benefits samsung ( patents aside ) . 
  they currently have the upper hand on android , for many regular consumers an android phone is a samsung phone why would samsung start pushing google services now ? 
  when they are at the top ? 
  maybe i 'm just cynical , and i hope it 's true but i just do n't see why they would do it . 
  rule # 6 : no questions about buying or building computers , including part questions , those go in / r/buildapc, 
  gates leaving is bigger news than the new ceo imo . 
  hope this is not true i will cancel my membership if it is . 
  afaik the beta is free , i doubt they are going to have games they think people will pay to play . 
  although it would be very disappointing and a terrible move by sony if this was it . 
  this happens more often than you think , ( just google `` company '' abandons trademark ) there still is a grace period of a couple months and they only need to pay a very small fine to get it renew . 
   at microsoft , nadella worked as the senior vice president of r&d for the online services division and vice president of the microsoft business division . 
  hopefully with choosing someone internally from the company they wo n't have a hp l\u00e9o apotheker type situation . 
  tried to spin-off/sell the personal computer division and make hp a business services company \u00e0 la ibm . 
  that plus a couple of other terrible moves made hp lose almost 50 % of it 's market value in less than a year ( i think he was there 10 months before he being fired ) . 
  ninja-edit : looks like other people have already answered your question . 
  that 's what i said , by `` hp l\u00e9o apotheker '' i do n't mean that he was internal to hp , but referring to what he did when he was at hp . 
   i 'm not sure what amazon is thinking here . 
  they are rumor to be releasing a sub 299 android base console , i 'm guessing they want games ? 
  but i 'm still surprise since i did n't expect that they would have `` console '' quality games like playstation and xbox . 
  that 's happening because you are changing the font size to 15px . 
  many ways to make it aligned , a quick one is to just add this . 
  . sidecontentbox a.helplink { margin-top : 0px ; }, 
  that 's beacuse of res . 
  . res-keynav-activeelement ,, 
  . commentarea . res-keynav-activeelement . md ,, 
  . commentarea . res-keynav-activeelement . entry . noncollapsed {, 
  background-color : transparent ! important ; }, 
  think this is it but i 'm not sure do you know what os/browser he is using ? 
  #sr - header-area {, 
  position : absolute ;, 
  background-color : white ;, 
  text-transform : none ! important ;,
