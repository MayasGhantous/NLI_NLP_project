  oh god that 's sick . . [ so here is another one . 
  r/pimpmyreddit and r/shamelessplug, 
  no they are not [ microsoft was founded on april 4 , 1975 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/microsoft ) and [ apple on april 1 , 1976 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/apple_inc . ), 
   every time you hook up your ps3 to a tv with a different resolution ,, 
  no it 's only when the new tv does n't support the resolution you had it set in the old one , that you got to reset it . 
  for example :, 
  old tv supports 1080p and you set the ps3 to 1080p , but new tv only supports 720p or anything lower than 1080p , than the tv ca n't display the image because it does n't support it , however , if the old tv and ps3 were set to 720p and you hook it up to a tv supports 1080p than you do n't have to reset it . 
  same thing happens in pcs when you set your resolution to something the monitor does n't support it will go blank . 
  i will make this the guide line in [ r/box ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/box ) . 
  this is from [ autoblog ] ( http://www.autoblog.com/2011/07/28/stephen-colbert-mocks-nissans-call-for-unique-wave-for-leaf-dri/ ) , why did you block out the names ( they are only usernames btw ) ? 
  have n't dealt with a podcast but you can use [ this plugin ] ( http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/podcasting/ ) , seems to do what you want . 
  also the code you want is this, 
  < a href = `` http://example.com/my-podcast.mp3 ''  my podcast < / a , 
  from [ codex ] ( http://codex.wordpress.org/podcasting ), 
  post your results , it may be good to know if i ever i have to deal with a podcast . 
  i think i should put this reddit in r/pimpmyreddit and r/shamelessplug, 
  ok , but first 2 things what browser are you using ? 
  and second the front page button is the name not where it says reddit ( the picture ) , but were it says nasa , reply to me and if it is still a problem i will change it . 
  yea , i have n't been able to fix it for ie , i will put up a post next week regarding the design and have people vote on it to see if it stays or goes . 
   special called `` pint-sized preachers '' premiering wednesday at 10 p.m. on the national geographic channel . 
  he is getting a national geographic special , i wonder what it is about ? 
  brainwashing maybe ? 
  btw do n't click the view all comments button on that site ... 
  so general patton is the big guns ? 
  i guess we need to bring out the [ swords ] ( http://www.altfg.com/stars/photo-actors-t/toshiro-mifune-seven-samurai-akira-kurosawa.jpg ) . 
  i think they bought palm mostly for its ip and not for making ~ ~ wedos ~ ~ webos devices . 
  had my initial ** s ** in one of my alt accounts just got the same message , i need to come up with another pseudonym for this account . 
  no , best buy is the store with the most units ( 250k ) they started selling then this morning ( just got one a or so minute a ago ) so i do n't think hp pull then out of the shells . 
  [ bestbuy link ] ( http://www.bestbuy.com/site/hp+-+touchpad+tablet+with+16gb+memory+-+black/2842056.p?id=1218358284065&amp;skuid=2842056 ), 
  not bad , it looks like the background of a retro game . 
  [ the shit i waste my time on ... ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xy6c8.png ), 
  go to the official ps blog . 
  that where they make the announcements before the updates . 
  that 's why you need [ reddit enhancement suite ] ( http://reddit.honestbleeps.com ) gives you in comment image viewing . 
  no more opening a tab for a picture . 
  dude you look fucking bad ass in the those pics .

  yea that what gets me they went through all the trouble but to only give 50 % of the money , me thinks they are not that charitable, 
  drunk ... . 
  if you want to advertise a subreddit use these two reddits , r/pimpmyreddit and r/shamelessplug . 
  thank you . 
   what would be the best way for me to go about this ? 
  self post like this one are the best way that way you can edit it anytime . 
  if you have another subjection you can tell me and i will see what i can do . 
  you most be using ie , i been trying to fix it for people who are using ie but the best solution at the moment is to turn off the css in your preferences . 
   aviation and aeronautics links . 
  those links are welcome any time, 
  this was a mistake last night i was including the link to the r/spaceflight reddit in the sidebar , pasted the name in the title form while i was fixing the order of the links and forgot to change it . 
  done, 
  i added you thanks for helping me out . 
  [ or * donated * the money . 
  do n't think it 's that good of a charity to begin with , they only giving 50 % of the final sale price . 
  i have wonder what 's going to happen when the ps4 comes out ? 
  do we move to r/ps4 and grow that reddit ? 
  or do we stay here and post about the ps4 here ? . 
   or make the award not mean as much ? 
  definitely ~ ~ made the award not mean as much ~ ~ proof our subs greatness :d , on a side note they got my name wrong ... 
  [ hahaha someone is really angry that we got the award ] ( http://i.imgur.com/sqap5.png `` people take the internet too seriously '' ) , so when do we do [ r/nasa ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/nasa ), 
  this is/was happening to me , i just delete everything and and running nightly no problems so far . 
  [ you can export all your bookmarks from the `` import and backup '' section as a html file which you can than import to your new install so you dont lose it .

  hey jaxspider i did n't need that apology about the name , now i feel bad ... anyhow , thank you for featuring us . 
  that has always been one of my favorite cars , where was this ? 
  if you do n't mind me asking . 
  really ? 
  that thread get repeated when ever there is nazi reference , and it ~ ~ all ~ ~ always get * s * upvoted for some fucking reason , even thought it 's the sames shit over and over again . 
  _ edit _ : spelling, 
  edit2 : looks like reddit change the syntax , ca n't get bold to work ... 
  i guess koreans are not so silly by being afraid of fan dead . 
  here you go i made you a mod of a ** real ** reddit ... [ box ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/box/ ), 
  i guess this is like kim jong-il 's son version of [ kim jong-il looking at things ] ( http://kimjongillookingatthings.tumblr.com/ ), 
  kim jong-nam is the eldest son this is the youngest one i think . 
  are all the post the same person ? 
  what ? 
  i 'm talking about reddit , not the social norms of elsewhere . 
  i know some words are not socially acceptable that 's why i quoted carlin 's seven dirty words . 
  but this has never been a problem on reddit before . 
  [ actually it is sts-134 , endeavour 's final launch . 
  ] ( http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/image_feature_1945.html ), 
  i knew the it reminded me of something while reading that , looks very similar to the [ boeing x-37b ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ee/boeing_x-37b_inside_payload_fairing_before_launch.jpg ) ,, 
  me too , you should join us at [ / r/box .

  [ looks like it 's a bombardier q400 to me but i 'm not sure .

  do you feel [ r/box ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/box ) is a good representation of box ? 
  and if so would you contribute picture of box ? . 
  i have always found [ the fist photo of mars surface ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ae/mars_viking_12a001.png ) to be really awesome , also [ mars.jpl.nasa.gov / ] ( http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/ ) is a great site for all the nasa mars mission and many other things , and [ the three-year journey video of the rover opportunity ] ( http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/videogallery/index.html?media_id=114782241 ) is really cool to see all the places its been . 
  edit : formatting, 
  [ here ] ( http://www.theesa.com/facts/index.asp ), 
  earth . 
  that 's a copy pasted legal shit that even the admins have said it does n't apply to the way reddit works , websites just used the same/similar agreement to make it easier on them if they are face with legal problems . 
  edit : [ here the admins comment ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/theoryofreddit/comments/ksug7/just_a_thought_about_reddits_user_agreement/c2mzoib ),
