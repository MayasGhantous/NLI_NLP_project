  remove this 2 things from there, 
  position : absolute ;, 
  and remove from this, 
  #header {, 
  background : url ( % % top % % ) repeat-x ;, 
  remove this, 
  you may also want to remove this if you want to have the tabs line up like in the default stylesheet . 
  something like this and it should fixed it . 
  #header {, 
  background : url ( % % top % % ) repeat-x bottom ;, 
  write it like this then . 
  #header {, 
  background : url ( % % top % % ) repeat-x ;, 
  background-position : bottom ;, 
  for the reddit image you can do something like this . 
  #header - img {, 
  position : absolute ;, 
  top : 25px ; / edit this, 
  for the sub name it 's something like this . 
  #header - bottom-left . pagename a {, 
  position : absolute ;, 
  top : 10px ; / edit this, 
  left : 50px ; / edit this, 
  edit the number to what ever you like ( i just guess those . ), 
  i like this [ titanic ii ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vetafnj2tpq ) better . 
  man that was so good , i mean it was good enough that if it was a movie i would have paid to see it . 
  seriously people should be watching this show . 
  with the announcement of the new ceo at microsoft , it was also announce that you will spend more time at ms , will you focus more on the consumer side of ms ? 
  where it seems that they are not doing as well as the business side of it ( even thought you had a another great earnings report ) . 
  also heard that satya nadella was your choice for ceo what was your reason for making him your choice ,, 
  it is that ( afaik anyways ) , you need to remove overflow : hidden ; from there and added it to . link , but you will have other problems with the sidebar if you do , since the sidebar is bigger the the default . 
  . sitetable.nestedlisting  . comment , . res . sitetable.nestedlisting  . comment {, 
  border : 0 ! important ;, 
  margin-bottom : 0px ! important ;, 
  remove what i said in the other comment but also remove the line that says width :100 % ; from here ( note there are 2 parts with the same code on the stylesheet , one for res nightmode ) this may work but i 'm not sure ... sorry i ca n't be more of more help, 
  but by that logic if the may sale number are bad and they do n't announce something he would be wrong would n't he ? 
  that 's true , although since it coming to the 360 and pc it may not be as big . 
   though tlou is finished ( read : no sequels , no more dlc -- naughty dog 's calling it one and done ) , the lessons learned in the process are far reaching . 
  `` we have to check in with ourselves as developers and figure out what are we after here , '' straley told us . 
  i mostly posted this article because of this part of the end looks like there will be no more tlou games . 
  threatening user with posting their personal information will get you banned .

   because nokia is a ms subsidiary now . 
  i do n't think it 's been finalize yet , this device would have been killed if it had . 
  ( although if the wp and android apps rumor is to be believe they may actually keep it ), 
  rule # 5 check / r/pcgamingtechsupport or / r/techsupport . 
  do you see ms selling a phone that 's not is wp ? 
  i do n't , unless they have given up on wp as it would split their ecosystem or as i said they do the android app thing that 's been rumor .

   htc one ... gold, 
  that one came out after apple 's gold iphone , i remember people taking shots at samsung and htc when that happen . 
   the first gold sgs4 was sold two days before the iphone 5s came out ( let alone a gold ip5s ) . 
  sold ... 
  here, 
  fta, 
   two weeks after apple 's september 10th reveal of a champagne-colored iphone , samsung is launching its own golden phone in the shape of a new gold edition galaxy s4 . 
  but it was sold 2 day before iphone i guess lol . 
  everyone was making fun of samsung because everyone knew months in advance that the iphone was coming in gold and samsung just happen to have a gold ? 
  do n't tell me that was n't because of the iphone . 
  they are doing a mercedes grand turismo vision speedboat , no joke ... 
  i wonder if the boat will be playable in gt6 ? ... 
  do we know if this will be a z2 ? 
  i see this more as a z1 for verizon . 
  specially with all the red in that teaser . 
  rule # 6 : no questions about buying or building computers , including part questions , those go in / r/buildapc,

  have always dislike this image , it ignores that the complexity and cost of development has risen while the price of games have stay the `` same '' price , [ hell it 's actually lower due to inflation ] ( http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl?cost1=50&amp;year1=1990&amp;year2=2014 ) . 
  and yet people want more but do n't want to pay more for it . 
  we know what games cost to make in 1999 and what they do now , it not my opinion . 
  unity it 's not comparable i 'm talking about aaa games , but you are right in the sense that the cost of making independent games it 's a lot lower today and easier . 
  thanks , fixed . 
  it did n't get hack , i think he is talking about the thing last month ( ? ), 
  where a site got hack and user who were using the same password as their yahoo password got their email hack . 
  also yahoo has 2 step authentication which people should be using anyways . 
  i have adblock off on this site and i hardly ever get ads that are not ads for other subreddits , so i had no problem turning it off .

  this was a spam post . 
  you need to remove that affiliate tag from you link , if you want your comment approve . 
  it is what modding is , for the most part and we will not add anyone unless we know they can do the basics . 
  i used black because that was the main color we had before but if more people one a dark red as the hover color , i will change it . 
  thank for the feedback . 
  yea i agree on the red and greed ( i think the sidebar is the only place we had green although ) and that there is lot of red in the sidebar . 
  changed it some , is it better now ? 
  another comment pointed out that there was a lot of red in the sidebar so i change it back to black .
