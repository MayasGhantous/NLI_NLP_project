  but took it down to 2 , is it better now ? 
  what do you feel is busy and clutter about it ? 
  not counting logos , there were 2 but still now there should only be one font . 
  can you post a screenshot ? 
  since i 'm not seeing all the other fonts you are mentioning . 
  this is a warning , fallow the rules in the future . 
  do not : personally attack other users . 
  thank you ! , i like it but can you remove the headphones and add the ~ ~ looks ~ ~ ear back , i want to see if that looks better ? 
  cool , thank you . 
  would n't the admins need to know the password for that ? 
  and if they do does n't that mean the passwords are not encrypted ?

  i wonder what the case diameter is , looks like it 's over 60mm . 
  either way that is the best looking smartwatch , i have seen . 
  edit : wander  wonder . 
  it was a contributor to forbes which pretty much a glorify blogger that anyone can write . 
  i saw one of the one that were posted ( not the forbes one ) but it was just blogspam i removed it . 
  vr headset was announce what 's to be disappointed about ? 
  mcd 's delivers here in nyc too , and probably in other states/cities in the us . 
  i only run mse and this i hope it does n't become annoying with this update . 
  also, 
   we will continue to honor existing lifetime licenses , meaning any users that already have a lifetime license for 1 . x will continue to have a lifetime license for 2.0 . 
  are pro licenses are lifetime ? 
  i bought a cd from newegg , ( only used the key since i do n't have a drive , anymore ... ) i 'm hoping that 's my lifetime licenses . 
  cool , also you have a really great product .

  what in the world would facebook of all companies do with oculus ? 
  ( i thought this post was an early april fools post ) that said, 
   oculus already has big plans here that wo n't be changing and we hope to accelerate . 
  the rift is highly anticipated by the gaming community , and there 's a lot of interest from developers in building for this platform . 
  they have been very hands off with instagram ( hell there is n't even a sign in with facebook button ) so i believe this , i just do n't get why they bought it . 
   i can not imagine how facebook is n't going to at least derail the focus of this from gaming . 
  i 'm sorry but this is just a stupid statement , the only viable market for vr right now is gaming , yes it can be use for other forms of entertainment but those are even more unproven than vr gaming . 
  maybe it 's because i do n't use facebook that i do n't hate them like most of reddit seems to , so i 'm very neutral to this news . 
  i do n't understand why facebook wants to enter this market but unless key people start leaving oculus in the next couple months , i 'm still going to be very excited for the oculus rift . 
  i 'm not saying that it will not be use for other things but for now , i do n't believe that their they are `` no longer focused on gaming '' . 
  well only time will tell if one of us is wrong . 
  #header . tabmenu li a : hover { do your thing }, 
  because you are using images you need to use images on as your hover . 
  you want to replicate the buttons on this subreddit , or your images ? 
  for this subreddit it should be this . 
  ( you can look at the code / r/csshelp/about / stylesheet ), 
  margin : 0 ;, 
  background : none ;, 
  display : inline-block ;, 
  background : #bbb ;, 
  color : #fff ;, 
  color : # 666, 
  #header . tabmenu . selected a {, 
  color : # 222 ;, 
  to replicate something like in your images maybe this , i only spend like 5 min on this so it may not look right . 
  . tabmenu li.selected a {, 
  background-color : transparent ;, 
  border : none ;, 
  border-bottom : none ;, 
  background-color : #ffffff ;, 
  color : # 000 ;, 
  background : black ;, 
  i have not tested any of this so it may not work . 
  text-indent : 100 % ; / * removes the text title * /, 
  display : block ;, 
  background : your image ;, 
  background-repeat : no-repeat ; / * you also need this , forgot to add it * /, 
  position : absolute ;, 
  top : 00px ; / * were you want your image * /, 
  left : 00px ; / * were you want your image * /, 
  here , i made comments to it so you know what to do . 
  np , also you should change the . redditname a to that ^ , that way it does n't effect your sidebar . 
  i forgot about that because i always hide the sidebar redditname . 
  oh cool i did n't know that i have always used redditname , i just remove the sidebar now since it looks cleaner that way ( imo anyways ) , but thank you ,

  [ sony has a magnetic charging cable thingy on their phones ] ( http://youtu.be/ia-80ainvri?t=1m40s ) . 
  so i do n't think apple would sue . 
  that patent seems to citing a sony patent maybe that why they have n't sue them ? 
  do n't know why they allow sony to have that connector ( also google 's patents page has become a lot better since i last used it ), 
  maybe the plane disintegrated in air and the paper was blown away and landed where op found it .

  nova needs to clam down he is a very good pitcher but man he looks nerves every time he pitches .

  i would be ok with that !,
