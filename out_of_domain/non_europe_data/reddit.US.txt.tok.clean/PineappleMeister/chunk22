  what happen ? 
  i was not watching . 
  fw . . that was deep double . 
  too bad their pitching is horrible . 
  i do n't know , i mean he could put the ball in the same place 4 times , lol . 
  yep , kazification https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cqmhmcro9i, 
  btw it 's hirai ... 
  kaz is the ceo of sony , before sony announce the playstation 4 , kaz was like [ we will let microsoft make first move ] ( http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/01/21/ps4-sony-will-let-microsoft-make-first-move ) . 
  a couple weeks after that interview , sony announce they will hold a press conference in nyc then [ neogaf when crazy ] ( http://i.minus.com/i59yxnisznxb7.gif ) and well that 's how it 's started ... sort of . 
  [ people are down voting you but there are high level people at ms that want to get out of the consumer space , and want ms to become a ibm type company . 
  ] ( http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2014/02/05/investors-want-microsofts-new-ceo-to-kill-xbox-bing-and-surface/ ) although i personally think that that would be a bad idea . 
  i think i will wait a while before i get a android tv device , i have chromecast which is great and for the price i love it but it 's been a long time since i last used it , i have too many things that do the same thing but better . 
  and with google tv being such a failure that i fear the same will happen to this . 
  anyways cautiously excited . 
  here , https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=homazckm3jo, 
   do n't buy their product . 
  do n't support them . 
  force them to take new routes . 
  i , for one , am done dealing with half-finished products like battlefield 4 , call of duty : ghosts , and let 's remember how bad assassin 's creed 3 's glitches were . 
  game breaking in all three of these series ' . 
  this is never going to work , not once has a games boycotts work and if it did worked publisher will just use it as `` evidence '' that they should n't release a pc version of the game . 
   playstation, 
   * - four exclusive missions, 
   * - add . 
  60 minutes of gameplay, 
  also these are not pre-order bonuses though you get it even if you do n't pre-order . 
   . pagename a { display : none ; }, 
  on the mean time can you remove this from your stylesheet , i just want a link to the subreddit front page . 
  . side { margin-top : 50px ; }, 
  easiest way to align them it to add margin top to the sidebar and content area but it may not work for you . 
  you need to remove : before from this part, 
  #header : before {, 
  and you will need to remove or change other things . 
  like, 
  #sr - header-area {, 
  position : relative ; < remove this, 
  color : # 413a28 ;, 
  background-color : # 333 ;, 
  border-bottom : none ;, 
  opacity : 0.4 ;, 
  and, 
  #header - bottom-left {, 
  position : relative ;, 
  top : -117 px ; / * change this to something like 20px * /, 
  i only looked at you sub for a couple of minutes so there ; s probably a better way for you to do this but this should work . 
  that is not css , it 's an image , use something like photoshop , illustrator , or gimp . 
  that looked playable : /, 
  seem like a catch to me , is this first bad over turn ? 
  all on phelps now , lets see what happens . 
  should we ? 
  hehe , i had almost forgotten about joba , i wonder if he has pitch this year for his new team ? 
  content : '' ;, 
  . submit.submit-link . morelink a : hover : before {, 
  content : `` link test '' ;, 
  . submit.submit-text . morelink a : hover : before {, 
  content : `` text test '' ;, 
  something like this should work . 
  this makes puts it on one line, 
  . users-online { display : inline-block ; }, 
  the overlapping is because you have a negative margin here, 
  . fancy-toggle-button . active , . resshortcutside , . resdashboardtoggle , . resfiltertoggle , a.bluebutton , div.bluebutton {, 
  display : inline-block ! important ;, 
  margin : 5px -6 px 10px 0 ! important ; / * make the negative # positive * /, 
  height : auto!important ;, 
  outline : none ;, 
  border-color : #e 3e3e3 ! important ;, 
  border-radius : 0 ! important ;, 
  btw making it positive will change the way it looks for res users . 
  not sure what you mean ? 
  that 's what 's on your stylesheet . 
  i guess technically you do n't need it , but i did n't write any of that so yea ... 
  i do n't know how it will look if you remove it but you can try and see what happens . 
  you can add margin left to it . 
  display : inline-block ;, 
  this is a warning . 
  do not : personally attack other users . 
  i saw it when it was on the gsaauction site , anyone would won the auction had to scrap it and could n't keep it :(, 
  what are the announcer talking about ? 
  something 26 23 only thing i got ... 
  `` kinda '' ... 
  we have no luck what so ever ... 
  i do n't think we should risk putting solarte in and having him be put in the dl . 
   [ it manifested itself in 5.2.0 because we now have a way to prevent purple box from going away if user hovers over it , but the issue seemed to be there for a while in chrome . 
  ] ( https://getsatisfaction.com/ghostery/topics/ghostery_5_2_0_breaking_js_settimeout_in_chrome_34_0_1847_116_ubuntu_64_bit ), 
  yea that 's it , it has to do with the ghostery pop up , disabling that fixes the problem . 
  took me too long to find the solution :(, 
  yea also read that on the ghostery site too . 
  i was about to disable the res because how unusable res had become ( i thought it was a problem with res , other people are/were probably thinking the same ) , but after i read it was a ghostery problem , i found it had to do with pop up thing i just disable that and res is working perfectly now with ghostery . 
  just tune in , cc is looking good . 
  i was actually going remove that post when it was posted but it 's not against the rules so i left it , and just down vote it usually that 's enough and those post get downvote but not today : /, 
  it 's new so i wo n't retroactively remove it . 
  i expected that post to be down voted but was n't : /, 
  become it 's allow on / r/pics / r/vintage etc that i add it . 
  like the tech support rule i think there are better suited subreddits to post it . 
  that said i could make the rules clearer so that if someone post an informative nostalgic self post that that be allow . 
  ohh i expect lots of banned psn ids due to this , lol, 
  when a post get 's down vote pass a certain point it remove by reddit itself we have no control over that . 
  edit : to be clear i 'm talking about the your account settings . 
  it 's in your reddit preferences , there is a setting which hides low voted post . 
  that is what i 'm talking about .
