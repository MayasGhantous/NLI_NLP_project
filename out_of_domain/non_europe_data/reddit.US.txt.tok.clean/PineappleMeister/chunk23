  check out / r/mlbtheshow we having an online franchise for the sub . 
  what we are trying to improve is the quality of the content , i believe that images lowers the quality of the content in the reddit , the best example of this is / r/gaming vs / r/games . 
  sadly your post are an exception not the rule , if images are allow as the community grows the effects of very easy to consume post will dominate the front page because people will upvote multiple images faster than it takes the average person to read one article . 
  :( sorry i thought they had a couple left . 
  rule # 6 : no questions about buying or building computers , including part questions , those go in / r/buildapc, 
  removed rule 4 , contextless screenshots and not directly related to pc gaming . 
  this sub is for high quality news articles about technology . 
  i guess you made a mistake but the google front page is not that . 
  do n't use link shorteners . 
  approve but use / r/psnfriends in the future .

   for large events , we could have a single megathread for the event , having inside most of the relevant news and happenings of the event posted as unlisted links . 
  sound like a great idea , we will look into it . 
  what event would you want a mega thread for ? 
  wwdc ? 
  we will most likely remove duplicates , unless the articles brings something new and informative about the topic . 
  also agree . 
  i think we should consider this . 
  wtf ... ... ... . 
  stupid rule should be change , everyone used it all the fucking time , redsox being losers . 
  to fair or unfair . 
  it looked like on the reply , that he did n't have it on the first inning . 
  yea ... 
  i do agree on that ... but not sure where he could have put it where it would n't show , the uniforms are white it would get notice more than on him . 
  japans has a sun on it 's flag, 
  solarte sort of sounds like the sun, 
  tanaka is power by solarte,

  i do n't get messages if you just say my name , that 's a reddit gold future , the only reason i found this is because i was checking is am was working correctly . 
  also , the admin which are the reddit employees said you could n't post this i ca n't condone thing that the admins do not allow . 
  if you need to speak to them about this use this http://www.reddit.com/contact/, 
  why would they be suing for ? 
  ms was not the first to release a controller with asymmetrical analogue sticks or use abyx and the controllers do n't even look alike . 
  probably a bad choice of words on my part but they banned you for self-promoting/spamming did n't they ? 
  you are not allow to do , they are going to banned you again if you continue to post these . 
  i can not allow something the admins feel is against the rules of reddit , if the banned was unwarranted the they would have unbanned your old account when you asked . 
  watermarks also count as spamming , you can ask them if you do n't believe me , ( i also did n't know this until recently so i do n't blame you for not knowing ) . 
  so , no these post are not allow here . 
  rule # 6 : no questions about buying or building computers , including part questions , those go in / r/buildapc, 
  thank you , 
  well no , hardware is very specific to well physical hardware . 
  it would not cover say x companies os or later in electronic standard or format . . etc. 
  hardware has a very narrow definition unlike tech . 
  eww , the solarte flair reminds me of gotsey ... ... 
  hahaha , i did n't mean to but there are probably better image that could have been use . 
  like this ,, 
  of this photoshop i did of the walk off inside the park https://i.imgur.com/alfbzlv.jpg,
