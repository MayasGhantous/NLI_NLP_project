  it maybe a mistake . 
   / r/technews [ 5 ] is advertised as their sister site , yet it has just one moderator and is largely deserted . 
  who knows what this moderator is doing ? 
  it 's a small sub there is really not a need for more moderators ( at the moment ) , automoderator public there for a while , nothing else i can do . 
  edit : added to it . 
  that has not been remove , i do n't know wtf you are talking about . 
  maybe you should check your account settings and see if you have it to hide on upvote . 
  he is not talking about his post but / u/colin-govtechmag post , that is still on the front page that has not been removed . 
  nope , not him . 
  i know who did it trying to find out why it was done . 
  it has been fixed now btw i probably should have eddited that in to my comment, 
  it 's on the front page at the bottom ( number 21 as of this comment ) , sing-out and see if you have hidden it or check / u/prototypexx/hidden /, 
  honestly that 's awesome , as someone knows nothing of nascar ( i came from / r/all ) what are the chances of it winning ? 
  thanks , what 's the day of the race ? 
  ( google tells me the may 17 ? ), 
  where will it be broadcast ? 
  thanks i will make sure to check this sub then .

  man i spend too much * time making this work on a subreddit / r/timebomb before i remember that i could n't actually do a proper countdown with only css ... 
  will this actually do anything ? 
  i have always felt that protest are never successful unless the party you are trying to reach is inconvenience by the protests and i doubt people at the fcc are using reddit . 
  so you guys are going to partner with voip service and use ip geolocations to match visitors with their member of congress 's phone number and have a one click call your congressmen and tell them about net neutrality button all over reddit and then have a computer that turn us all into super geniuses with the power of james bond ? 
  joking aside i will participate in anything guys decide . 
  : o , that is certainly the best option imo . 
  was `` thedaywefightback '' not successful ( i mean successful in number of calls not changing policy ) , do you guys have data ( lol considering the cause ) on how many people call from reddit specifically ? 
  unless that number was really low i do n't see why this is not your number one option ( well maybe it was very expensive ? ) . 
  short of protesting in front of the fcc headquarters ( or congress ) i think this is the best thing you can do .

  his wife loves extra inning ... this is a cheating joke right ?

  i just realized that i should have been asleep like an hour ago ... 
  tomorrow will not be fun , so soriano please steal home next inning !, 
  well i guess that 's goodnight folks , it was a fun game .
