  solarte has 2 errors this game the hell is happening !, 
  looks like they recorded it as a hit , but that was an error imo . 
  the bot mark it as er , but looks like it was fixed . 
  i was talking about the first error ( with pujols ) , the second was scored as an error to solarte , i think it was his error he should n't had thrown the ball if no one was there it made the runner mode up to scoring position . 
  damn !, 
  digital zoom is horrible though .

  / r/ps4/wiki / subreddit/rules, 
  come on ellsburry !, 
  goodnight . 
  what happen ? 
  i did n't see anything . 
  fuck yea !, 
  we should have walked him ... fuck ... 
  i kinda expect uncharted to be early 2015 not summer to be honest . 
  also i 'm very interested in a new god of war , but i hope it 's not a direct sequel but a different mythos . 
  yea but the article says summer i just do n't see it coming out at that time . 
  and fall 2015 is a long time from now , i do n't want to wait that long :(, 
  rule # 6 : no questions about buying or building computers , including part questions , those go in / r/buildapc, 
   we do n't have confirmed information on the build materials that lg is using for the g3 , but it appears that the phone is made out of plastic that 's imitating brushed metal . 
  why would they do that ? , it will look like a cheap knock off in person . 
  the plastic on the nexus 5 looks good imo so why not use that ? 
  this thing is going to look horrible after a few months of use when the imitation metal starts wearing off . 
   what timezone are you located in & when are you active on reddit that you would be able to dedicate to modding ? 
  i 'm in the eastern standard time zone . 
  i 'm active at varying times since i 'm usually on my pc or phone . 
   what is your general moderation philosophy ? 
  should there be solid & strict rules in place , or should moderators just remove things that break reddit.com site rules [ 1 ] and let the upvotes decide everything ? 
  is it in between those two somewhere ? 
  please explain your position in as much detail as possible . 
  i believe all subs should have rules to keep it the low effort content ( memes etc ) from taking over the front page . 
   why do you want to mod / r/space [ 2 ] ? 
  i 'm the head mod over at / r/nasa , i have always been very interested in everything relate space . 
   which rule would you change about / r/space [ 3 ] if you could and why ? 
  nothing ? 
  for the most of the time i been subscribe to / r/space the sidebar was mostly empty . 
   do you have any mod experience ? 
  ( not necessary , but if you have experience say so and in which subreddit or subreddits ), 
  yea , i took over / r/nasa a couple of years ago after it was abandon , with the help of couple of mods there made it what it is now . 
  i also mod / r/pcgaming / r/awesome / r/ps4 ( and others but smaller subreddits ), 
  i do n't think it 's that bad ( and it does n't look unorganized to me ) , but i also think that on android it will look bad because of all the different icons shapes . 
  ios looks cluttered but at least all the icons are uniform . 
  i removed it , it fall under the blogspam rules , also we ca n't stickied a link . 
  so i will add it to the sidebar .

  consider this a warning . 
  do not : personally attack other users . 
  you can correct anyone you like just do n't attack them by calling them names etc. 
  who was he traded for ? 
  no idea . 
  op must done it ( maybe by mistake ) , wo n't un-nsfw because maybe he wants to edit something nsfw in later ... 
  you can have the text on the sidebar and animate from there , i did this in / r/timebomb, 
  do n't implode do n't implode do n't implode !!!, 
  you probably should n't set it up as i did i was trying to get working as fast as i could and i did n't care about the usability . 
  but as you can see text can be animated .

  it a table with links basically . 
  ^ guessing that means you do n't want it nsfw ? 
  fixed it for you . 
  nope , nsfw here means that it is nsfw you can delete your post if you do n't want people posting on it . 
  only thing i would ask is not to change the way comments look for res users ( at least not make the change as substantial as it is ) , it 's the only reason i do n't use a particular subreddit stylesheet but it 's not really a problem if you do n't want to do it . 
  also maybe keep the arrows in comments the same width as the default , the current ones waste too much space imo . 
  welp , are we still calling cc our ace ... 
  i honestly will never understand what a balk is . 
  edit : i also do n't know how to spell it ... 
  great ... ... ... 
  yep, 
  nope , css ca n't tell time . 
  i did / r/timebomb that 's the best i could do . 
  not on reddit , the admins [ did n't add any additional off-site references ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/cssnews/comments/24anzb/css_change_the_filter_has_been_rewritten/ch5n8b6 ), 
  do n't use link shorteners . 
  i hope gardner steals because i 'm feeling a double play coming . 
  i wish they let betances bat . 
  it 's the only thing aluminum the band around the phone ? 
  cause that back does n't look like metal , i thought it was going to be something like the htc m8 when i read the title . 
  but wait there already going to be an update to the s5 ? 
  did n't it came out on first week april or something ? 
  that is just over a month ago , i know some people who will be real pissed if they announce this so soon . 
  you use to be able to go to the sony press site and download high quality videos/screenshots etc but they change the login/password that was out there . 
  almost all of the mods have been remove . 
  / r/gameofthrones/about / moderators, 
  nope do n't think so the css is still active .
