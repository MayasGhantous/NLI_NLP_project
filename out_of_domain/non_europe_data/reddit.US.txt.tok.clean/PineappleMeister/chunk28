  both sony and ms started selling codes in amazon in 2009 but [ ms stop in 2010 ] ( http://blog.seattlepi.com/microsoft/2010/08/23/amazon-stops-selling-xbox-live-arcade-game-codes/ ) and [ sony 2011 ] ( http://www.ign.com/articles/2011/10/21/amazon-no-longer-selling-psn-content ) . 
  due to the times it was most likely a contract dispute between ms/sony and amazon . 
  [ sony started again last year ] ( http://blog.us.playstation.com/2013/11/12/psn-digital-content-now-available-on-amazon-com/ ) , so i 'm guessing ms can probably start selling again on amazon in they wanted to . 
  ... what ... 
  i do n't want to watch this anymore . 
  lol, 
  blazing saddles . 
  yes , you should watch it . 
  hopefully we can give kurada some runs in this game . 
  oh i remember for all their good hitters the jays pitching sucks . 
  you guys think kuroda is coming out for the 7 ? 
  what was ironic about the mudkip guys that the announcers were talking about ? 
  someone should edit this video with the world cup domestic violence ad that was on here a couple of days ago . 
  ` do not post using vague titles . `, 
  posts without at least a substantial part of their question ( or topic ) in the title will be removed . 
  rule of thumb : if your question can fit in the title , then it should be in the title . 
  [ you can find examples of titles not to use here . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/ps4/wiki/subreddit/rules/examples#wiki_vague_titles ), 
  ca n't do that just resubmit it . 
  and the licence plate is i8tokyo iirc . 
  lols same place as ortiz . 
  well we fuck that up quickly ... 
  also i think we should unintentionally intentionally walk ortiz , he may hit in to a double play but i prefer if he did n't bat . 
  another walk wtf ... 
  lol at mudkip, 
  cano hit a pretty nice homer today , so do n't remind me he is no longer a yankee :(, 
  the fat guy is making me hungry . 
  [ do n't worry guys i just gotten footage of what happens in the 9th from an alternative universe where we just won this game . 
  ] ( http://gfycat.com/querulousashamedhoopoe `` a 240 million dollar alternative universe lol '' ) ... . 
  oh i forgot that we had a game today , but at least it 's with the rays we are going to wi ... * looks at the score * ... 
  ichiro and gardner our 2 best players doing it all !, 
  i 'm watching that game right now so it probably wont happen . 
  betances is pitching now so fuck the redsox game . 
  i know reddit has a hard on for elon musk and he ca n't do no wrong but paypal has been doing this since the beginning hell look at this forum from 2001 ( before the ebay acquisition ) where they complaining about the account being frozen . 
  [ people complaining about paypal freezing account in 2001 ] ( http://www.ecommercebytes.com/forums/vbulletin/showthread.php?150-what-can-i-do-with-paypal-when-they-freeze-my-account ), 
  lol, 
  what happen to ellsbury ? 
  had to google the name and https://i.imgur.com/hgiopph.png ... 
  the reddit toolbar is optional thing in settings and it 's off by default . 
  ( hell i doubt any body uses that ) it is ghostery that making the page look like that . 
  if you block the doubleclick ad in it , it breaks the page . 
  ghostery even warns you about it if you click its icon . 
  ... . you need help . 
  does n't say it was peds could be weed for all we know . 
  removed . 
  do not : personally attack other users . 
  of topic but what what browser are you using ( is it chrome ? ), 
  and can you take a screen shot of the font page if you do n't mind . 
  i want to find out by the sidebar is like that on your browser . 
  wtf are the yankees wearing a red hat ? 
  i just tune in and thought the twins were pitching because the damn red hats , so i was rooting for that error or ( whatever happen in the of ) , only to realize that i was rooting for the twins ... . 
  i do n't see why they would do it , the ips are not all that great . 
  only thing i can see that 's worth it is cry engine and that sony does something like giving licences to publish a game on playstation for free . 
  but yea i doubt anything comes of this . 
  the rumor is that ryse sequel is cancel . 
  also that game does n't look like it sold all that well anyways i do n't sony cares about ms having it as an exclusive . 
  but i do take your point about crysis that could be worth it if it 's cheap enough . 
  well that was a terrible game . 
  he is , he tried to make a post about this on / r/ps4 with another account . 
  url shortener, 
  removed . 
  this is your warning . 
  do not : personally attack other users . 
  i think the pitcher block santana , wish they had a better replay though . 
  edit : looks like i was watching the game a couple mins delay because on my dvr lol ;, 
  lol this is horrible i feel bad for the indians . 
  it 's already an official game i think . 
  removed . 
  do not : personally attack other users . 
  ok cool . 
  more phone should have a better front facing camera . 
  but i doubt i would buy a phone just because it has a nice front facing camera . 
  dual sim are cool though . 
  all their control leaks have been done with the wall street journal not some random blogger . 
  in reality you can get that part mail from the factory in china , like all other part leaks . 
  hell you could get the xbox one shell on alibaba months before the console was release . 
  judging by the url the autoguide might have change the title . 
  i feel like that would cause the biggest drama of the summer ... and i would love to see that . 
  oh fuck , this year ~ ~ suck ~ ~ sucks . 
  [ oh and this dude on the yankee subreddit called it and but got downvote ... ] ( http://redd.it/2a7g3l ), 
  who do you think will be gone by the deadline ? 
  i 'm not sure they would trade gardner but i think betances is a real possibility especially for a team looking for a closer . 
  nice , thank you . 
  where did he say that ? 
  during the game ? 
  ( i have no audio ), 
  sort of ... 
  please use spoiler tags . 
  see the sidebar . 
  thank you . 
  oh and you can add bullets before the tags like this .
