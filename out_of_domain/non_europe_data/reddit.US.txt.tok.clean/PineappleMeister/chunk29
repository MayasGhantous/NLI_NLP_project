  i can only speak about how i moderate and the subs i mod . 
  but here, 
  ** 1 ) ** spam , problem with this is that at least in the video game subreddits i mod , there are thousands of alices , and specially now that it 's is very easy to record your games . 
  if all those user only submit links to their videos it would just clutter the front page with people trying to get subscribers . 
  ** 2 ) ** spam , hell this is just plain advertising who care if he is popular . 
  and if they are frequently upvoted and generate large and meaningful discussions then somebody who is not bob and it 's just a regular reddit user would submit it . 
  ** 3 ) ** one of the worse type of spams , we had problem similar to this on / r/ps4 where brand new users where submitting particular youtube channels , we had to use automoderator to ban the channel because banning the users was useless . 
  ** 4 ) ** & ** 5 ) ** have never have to deal with this , so do n't know .

  year 1814 - nsfw, 
  nope . 
  always weird, 
  monopoly , the trick is to have a monopoly . 
  even if the title says spoilers you have to use spoiler tags , not doing so will get you banned . 
  is n't that the promoted tab ? 
  well it does fixed the problem on / r/nasa for ff however if i do that in chrome it now has the promoted tab showing up now . 
  but i did end up fixing it by just changing the wiki permissions in setting from disable to mod editing , i 'm now thinking that on ff when that 's disable it hides the wiki tab making the li # 8 the res view image tab instead of the promoted tab . 
  so it was not a problem with the css ... , but thank you for your comment . 
  removed ,, 
  * using vague titles . 
  posts without the gist of a question ( not just the general topic ) in the title will be removed . 
  / r/ps4/wiki / subreddit/rules, 
   revenue from pcgames was also higher in 2013, 
  source ? 
  the only thing i could find was a forbes * contributor * ( which is as good as bloggers blog ) which has vgchartz as one of it 's sources ... 
  also this you ca n't take 2013 as a normal year as it was the end of the life cycle of the old consoles and they usually have a very negative skew . 
  the first and last year of the consoles cycle are very skewed data points and should not be counted as the norm . 
  i do n't mind adding more stuff the sidebar . 
  however i have never seen monthly community driven stuff like what you are asking work , usually the first couple months are fine but after that it falls apart . 
   popular games of the month, 
  i do n't see how useful that would be , if the steam popular list/rank thing is anything to go by they will usually be the same games every month . 
  we have a `` what have you been playing '' monthly thread which i think is a better option . 
  we also have a wiki page for popular games http://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/wiki/games, 
  it 's community maintained wiki page , if any else wants to be added as an editor you can message me . 
   peripherals ( mice , keyboards , headphones eetc ) since it 's not technically computer parts . 
  this subreddit is about the games , not parts or peripherals . 
  peripherals still fall under rule 6,

  hopefully this mean i can register my old username on twitch , since i 'm pretty sure i used it on justin.tv ages ago and no longer have the email or password for it . 
  what was an email ?
