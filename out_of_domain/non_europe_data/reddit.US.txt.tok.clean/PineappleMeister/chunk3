  now we have to wait like 30min to have confirmation if it was a success . 
  edit : us official saying it failed . 
  edit : if you want to watch a successful launch head over to [ / r/nasa ] ( / r/nasa ) and look at the launch schedule chart on the sidebar / shamelessplug, 
  sorry ... but we could probably get a lunch schedule from one the nasa employees we have there . 
  yea , i been a bit lazy in the past month have n't updated it but will soon , hit the more link and you get the latest schedule directly form nasa . 
  i need to update it , it has n't been update in a about 2 or 3 months problems is that fucking table fucking annoying to make , because of how reddit handles tables , we also have to change the info with get form the nasa page into a table friendly version of it like charging the `` baikonur cosmodrome , kazakhstan '' to `` tyuratam '' and linking to the wiki page . 
  tables for example :, 
   some | header | labels, 
   left-justified | center-justified | right-justified, 
   a | b | c, 
   d | e | f, 
  which is produced this :, 
  some | header | labels, 
  left-justified | center-justified | right-justified, 
  a | b | c, 
  d | e | f, 
  [ relevant ] ( / r/box ), 
  not sure if i should remove this or not , considering the origins ... 
  what site is that ? 
  edit : [ found it ] ( http://i.imgur.com/6riiq.png ) , [ / r/nasa ] ( / r/nasa ) is 20 heh . 
  not the same by a long shot , spacex is benefiting from many of the advancements nasa made with the saturn v and the apollo program that why it cost so much less . 
  nope , mods have little power but admins can . 
   analog  digital, 
  cant tell if reference to the vaio logo or coincidence . 
  removed it as spam look at his submissions , all the same website . 
  although i completely disagree with the poster , that reddit is call / r/politicaldiscussion you are going to have people with different opinions and looking over the thread the majority of the people posting agree with with op . 
  i do n't want this sub to turn into a circlejerk , so people with different option should be allow to express them without post like this . 
  we may have to add another new rule . 
  wow , i just remember i 'm a moderator of dinoballs ... 
  the ps2 and ps3 can play all ps1 games . 
  as for the memory card i ca n't remember but i think you can use a regular memory car . 
  [ all version of the ps3 can play physical ps1 disks , it is just some game dont work on it but they can all can play ps1 game ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_playstation_3_backward_compatible_playstation_2_and_playstation_games ), 
  no problem easy mistake to make . 
  why ca n't we delete mod mail ? 
  it could be a power left to only the top mod , or something all the mod would have to do to actually work . 
  but yea i could see how it could be easily abuse . 
  also can i request / r/camera , and can you check if / r/photos has actives mods their sub is set to private . 
  if not can i also get control of it . 
  thank you in advance . 
  oh btw the mods in / r/camera has delete his account . 
  man i would love if it was much later , 2:30 am here ... 
  thank you !, 
  ha , nice username  i 'm always looking for mods if you want to help . 
  the username is wrong on / r/camera so you gave the reddit to someone else lol , ( pineapplemeister not pineapplemaster hahah ), 
  remove sample with the sub you want . 
  is ok i thought is was funny , thank you !, 
  it look like you did n't upload the logo in the settings page so it still showing the default one . 
  ~ ~ was ~ ~ what so bad about it ? 
  ( have n't seen it yet ), 
  thank you !, 
  and now has been release !, 
  that no one wants to buy a $ 600 console ( experience ) and to be able to make it bc they would have to put the cell inside the ps4 like they did on the original ps3 that had the ps2 chip ( emotion engine ) which would make it more expensive ( at least i hope that why they are thinking ), 
  you should see the ps4 one that one is worse specially the `` industrial source '' rendering , it has a glass/transparent back on the console and the controller also has a transparent bridge thing on it ... oh and apparently sony is superstitious about calling the next playstation the ps4 because 4 in japanese is shi or something and that means death so that 's bad luck . 
  of course ignoring the fact that sony markets the ps3 with the english pronunciation and spelling of 3 [ ( sample ) ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=hvlvfpkhclc#t=11s ) so they will most likely do the same in the future . 
  blogspam removed . 
  [ here is one . 
  ] ( http://www.shopgoodwill.com/auctions/vintage-kodak-camera-duaflex-ii-kodet-lens-11956872.html ), 
  yes that 's ... oh hahaha ... thanks, 
  she actually did/does , it 's just that it has had many shitty restoration done to it that it has faded , also someone throw acid on it and being stolen a couple of times has n't been good for the conditions of the painting . 
  from that screenshot it looks like a purse ... can you link to the video ? 
  oops most have miss those two within all the delete accounts also looks like they have 7 mods not 6 oh well . 
  anyways cool bot . 
  expatshield is nice free vpn ( although i have only used it to watch top gear on the bbc iplayer ) , also you may try tor but i think it is block in china . 
  if you do n't want free vpn you can pay for your own here is [ list of vpn providers ] ( http://torrentfreak.com/which-vpn-providers-really-take-anonymity-seriously-111007/ ), 
  you can use automoderator . 
  it does what you are asking . 
  well i would argue that the xbox suck compare to the ps2 , and it took ms a billion dollars and the 360 to be able to make a good console . 
  so i could see the same happening with the steam box . 
  people / r/usenet are going to freak out about rule # 1 after this post hits the front page . 
  just sold a nametag for 50 cents , and i just posted it . 
  now i wondering if maybe i made it too cheap ... this could get addicting, 
  is a shitty title but that 's the article title . 
  as long as they are marketable ( there is a tag at the bottom that says , `` not tradable , not marketable '' ) , i have 26 items i ca n't sell :( but i 'm not sure if there is a delay between first getting an item and listing it . 
   128gb is still a bit far , because it would mean it 's going to be samsung 's chips , and i bet that samsung wants to use that in their own products first instead of giving it away . 
  why does it mean it will be a samsung chip ? 
  toshiba also has a 128gb chip . 
  i guess that make sense . 
  however , sony will be using a `` japan display '' display which is a join venture between sony , hitachi , and toshiba . 
  so using a toshiba chip is just as likely . 
  anyway , can i have a link to that article it sounds like an interesting read . 
  do n't thinks so , the company form last april , and will start mass production next years ( 2013 ) which match the time lime of the next xperia phones . 
  [ here is is an example of the display ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ygswt9wfck ) . 
  as you can see if the video it uses sony whitemagic technology that sony has use on some xperia phones , but those phones came out before the japan display was form so i dont think they were made by them . 
  i have remove it , as is duplicate . 
  also i think the actor was like 30 when the movie was made . 
  which makes it funnier to me . 
  edit : now with a lamp . 
  if i remember correctly you can still own a sword either made before 1958 or a new one as long as it was made in the traditional way , however , they are expensive . 
  you have to be a little more specific than that ... 
  also you can do it online from the sony entertainment site . 
  why are you hosting it on imgur ? 
  that should be on your server . 
   there was very good evidence that the questions were fixed, 
  source ? 
   korea international circuit, 
  i expected more hate for this track after all the comments on the race threads about how terrible it was . 
   as long as it 's still plastic i am happy . 
  why ? 
  has n't that ways been the biggest complain about corvettes ? 
  your account has been shadowban , i have approve your comment but you need to talk to the admin to fix it .
