   can i play my playstation through my pc with zero delay whilst streaming the gameplay on twitch ? 
  this is basically your question and would have been fine , your title should include as much as it needs to be able to understand what your post is about . 
  for what ever it 's worth i do n't think it is possible to play your ps4 from a pc you can however stream from the pc using a capture device . 
  the reviews on the amazon page are pathetic bunch of one stars because they do n't support a particular phone . 
  those people should be banned from writing reviews . 
  you are right that there are also lots of those but i 'm talking about all the other about not supporting a particular device , like these,

  no they did n't they said it was a console debut . 
  they did say grim fandango was an exclusive but both sony and ms call `` console exclusives '' exclusives for some reason .

  had a perfect game before this inning . 
  they will probably take him out after this inning since betances is warming up, 
  now that you said this he will give a homer to the first batter ,, 
  is it 1-1 or 1-2 ? 
  it 's just for fun , although some people take it seriously and downvote comments . 
  the first base ump sucks . 
  has he ever gone more the 2 inning since becoming a reliever ? 
  3 innings ? 
  i 'm not sure i like this . 
  oh i remember now we do n't trust anyone on our bullpen which is why 3 innings happen .
