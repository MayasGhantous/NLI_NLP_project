  google did the same thing . 
  you ca n't blame companies for a countries shitty laws . 
  2 am , i was planning to sleep early for once today guess that 's not going to happen . 
  last year the conference it self was in japanese ( even andrew house was speaking japanese ) but there were a couple english translators on the official stream , one of them was really horrible though . 
  where is this show filmed ? 
  it 's takes place here in nyc but i 'm having a hard time placing lots of the locations . 
  there was a leak that said it was coming to sprint . 
  and yea they really look good , i love the cooper version ( but if i had a choice i would probably pick the white one ) , ca n't say i care for that smartband thing . 
  it 's the organization , more tickets are sold if they keep up the appearance of a graceful final season at his regular position . 
  yea i hate that jeter bats second and that plays short when he should n't be but i do n't think it you can blame it all on jeter 's `` selfishness '' . 
  post that in the sticky . 
  did that just happened ?

  what a waste if we lose . 
  no because i want the yankees to win . 
  this is talking about market capitalization ( market cap ) apples market cap is ~ 580 billion ( googles is in the 300s ) . 
  what you link to is talking about value of the brands i honestly do n't even know how they get prices ( seems kinda made up to me but what do i know ), 
   so if i am reading this wrong let me know . 
  and if not , let me know how to invest in their prices dropping during their ipo, 
  you should n't short a stock you know nothing about , or it will end in disaster . 
  in nyc we send our trash to new jersey , unless we decide that we need more land than we just dump it in the river . 
  tag as rumor for now , can anyone provide a link collaborating this ? 
  i removed the since after searching i seen similar post on other sites . 
  hello ? 
  is it me you 're looking for ? 
  but let me start by saying ... oh shit it 's 3 am , night . 
  why does n't she turn off the thing that 's blocking the internet or what ever ? 
  i really getting tired of that whole subplot and somehow it 's more unbelievable than the vampires . 
  hahahahah the master just looks funny that is a terrible character design . 
  i feel like nothing happen in this episode .

  god dammit . 
  walks walks walks !, 
  i 'm pretty sure ichiro is going to break it . 
  i did n't say it would be this inning but he will . 
  edit : i just saw what inning this is ... ... ... 
  you sure it is n't one where he has to pay $ 1 million per hit . 
  what 's the link to the pizza again ? 
  woot woot no pizza !, 
  no pizza !, 
  lol kay thinks we can hit . 
  just saw a highlight during the yankees game . 
  was it blood that was on his face ? 
  i could n't see all that well . 
  edit chase headley just got hit in the face . 
  wtf ... 
  holy shit !, 
   sony was the first to redefine the compact flagships concept with its xperia z1 compact , setting a pretty high bar for both the competition and the potential successor . 
  the company 's short release cycle , on the other hand , is doing the z3 compact no favors . 
  was n't the last compact release a year ago ? 
  there was no z2 compact as far as i 'm aware . 
  i 'm a bit dissapointed by the camera and i do n't know why sony does n't have best phone camera on the market , hell they make the best hardware so my guess it 's all in the software , like lots of sony stuff the hardware is amazing but the software ...

  this is all joe west fault . 
  i feel like if we have the blue jays bats and our pitching , we would be in first place today . 
  what a fucking year ... . 
  walk off error lol, 
  lind = secret yankee !, 
  lol, 
  blue jays pitching is horrible ( might not be true but every time i see their score they are always losing by a lot ) , i would be more concern if he was n't hitting well . 
  i think they should give there mvp to stanton , if pedro 2000 did n't get it , not sure any pitcher can . 
  ( although i think kershaw is winning it . ), 
  oh i know , i may have phrase that badly i should i have said that i 'm not sure any pitcher * should * win it , since i just do n't think pitchers should win the mvp , it should ( imo anyways ) be for position players . 
  are giving up a grand slam ... nope, 
  the shows writers have to go out of their way to write him doing stupid shit since the main character is so horrible that if they do n't he will become the shows favorite . 
  i think i might quit watching this show , the main character is just too unlikable the only characters i like are vasily , the old man , and gus and they get the least amount of screen time . 
  everyone else is just annoying also these episodes are just feel like 90 % filler content .

  well apparently it 's a z3 variant that 's coming to verizon , xperia z3v . 
  although i hate carrier variants that may be how they have it on other carriers . 
  why does google keep having these weird requirements ? 
  i do n't think ms , apple , amazon , psn , steam or any other digital distribution stores have this , so people who keep defending google by saying this is because of the the eu law why is no one else fallowing that law ? 
  next year is going to be strange we really do n't have any other superstar type player in our team , everyone left feels like they are easily replaceable . 
  ( except maybe tanaka ), 
  i do n't think we are signing him again but i would be pleasantly surprise if we did . 
  oh shit i forgot about arod and i actually like him ... 
  oh good !!, 
  i did n't want jeters last at bat to be a double play . 
  that sound crazy enough that if someone mention it to ortiz , he might actually do it . 
  he likes to complain about everything what 's one more thing anyways . 
  i did n't think i would sad to see jeter go but : , 
  the fuck robertson . 
  sorry robertson , thank you for this !, 
  #the real hero d.robertson !!!, 
  hanley , would be a good choice imo since we could * probably * get him cheaply since he 's been injure a couple of times this year , teams might not want to take a risk on him . 
  ah no more nonopizza this year ( just checked ), 
  well it 's a meaningless game , best save those pitches for the year . 
  * looks at / r/baseball/new * i feel sorry for the mods this reddit . 
  we close submission on / r/ps4 during big events to prevent just that , although that 's not possible for this sub . 
  well i guess i will root for a laa vs lad world series . 
  damn , i knew i should have started ^ ^ ^ karma whoring .
