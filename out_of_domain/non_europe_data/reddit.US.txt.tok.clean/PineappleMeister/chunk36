  no red scooter | second meeting , red scooter 's casio here . 
  privacy is privacy and all those torrents they are downloading and seeding contain medical records , ss # of sony entertainment employees , that no matter how you feel about sony you ca n't justify involving innocent employees . 
  hbo is changing the way they do hbo go , this is most likely reason for the delay . 
  they are partnering mlb advanced media , same company who sony partner with for ps vue . 
  and hbo 's chief technology officer , ( basically the head of hbogo development . 
  also co-founder of xbox at ms. ... ) , just left the company and they shutting hbo 's internal development team responsible for the current apps and site . 
  the ny theater doing the premier just cancel it ... 
  do n't get me wrong i do n't think a premiers are anything important ( specially since it already premier in california ) but theaters are still pulling the movie . 
   did sony reveal its next smartphone in leaked bond-movie product pitch ? 
  i would think that if it was leak then they did n't reveal it ... 
  it looks great , but for sony my biggest concern are how they will implement lollipop and us availability . 
  removed . 
  do not : personally attack other users . 
  the press conference is still going on and there is already a story ... 
  they also deny the south korea bank cyberattacks from last year ... so this is not really surprising, 
   sony 's current plan for `` the interview '' is to release the controversial comedy for free on crackle , the streaming service it owns , ** sources said ** sunday . 
  this should be tag as rumor and knowing the nypost this is probably fake . 
   sources said sunday . 
  ... this ~ ~ is ~ ~ title is very misleading and a rumor . 
  some times support will ask you to say obvious things regarding prices and shit , to make you say it on record . 
  that way you ca n't say that you did n't know etc. 
  ahh so that account that posted a couple of times in / r/ps4 is real ? 
  i think i sent him a message but he never reply :(, 
  i just wanted to have give him a `` verified flair '' in / r/ps4,

  with all the theaters having back out there are very few place it will be playing at . 
   '' [ it appeared unlikely that big chains like regal or amc would come on board but that sony was likely to patch together distribution for the film in 200 to 300 smaller theaters .
