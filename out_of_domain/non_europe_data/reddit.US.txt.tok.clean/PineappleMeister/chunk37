  very few place are showing it , biggest chains wont carry it .

   '' [ it appeared unlikely that big chains like regal or amc would come on board but that sony was likely to patch together distribution for the film in 200 to 300 smaller theaters .

  you read sony did n't want to make money lol , nope . 
  they did let theaters get out of their contractual obligations to show it if they did n't want to but it would be bad pr if they did n't .

  this is against the reddit site wide rules , do not post it again . 
  if the first thread had not included a state/city , i would left that one up instead of making one but from how / r/ps4/new looked like i think people saw that thread and started to making their own ones with their states/cities in the title . 
  i actually did n't remove yours , i think that 's was the only one i left out of about 40 threads i removed . 
  no problem . 
  edit : lol i thought this was a pm since i had turn off inbox replies, 
  i will stickied it a little later , problem with sticking a post too early is that people stop voting on it and if they do n't vote on a post , most people who are not on the front page of this subreddit will not see it . 
  soon \u2122 but probably before the the last guardian is out . 
   sony people monitoring @askplaystation twitter account is reading this sub, 
  source ? 
  post this in the sticky , unless it 's new news , all psn status post go in the stickied .

   can add-ons ever see huge adoption in the gaming industry ? 
  yes , the zapper and the rock band etc guitars were hugely successful , it all about having one game that people want to play . 
  it 's why the move and kinect fail ( inb4 someone quotes that they have sold tens of millions ) is because of a lack of a compelling game . 
   datsun 240z convertible, 
  was that an aftermarket conversion ? 
  correct me if i 'm wrong but there was never a factory 240z convertible , is n't it also unibody ? 
  chopping the roof off would fuck up the cars integrity . 
  edit : i think i cause him to delete his account ... it was a nice username too :(, 
   full list of games for the curious ( sourced from here - disappointing that this was n't advertised with the launch blog post ) :, 
  probably because that link you posted has n't been update in like a month . 
  i 'm intrigue but somewhat concern . 
  the matrix already did shot for shots remakes of scenes from the ghost in the shell movie . 
  so i doubt this movie will have the same `` impact '' of doing it again , and a lot of the what makes ghost in the shell great are the great visuals . 
  edit : metrix  matrix . 
  did you click ops link ? 
  cause there many games there that are not in the list posted above by elfreemano . 
  that is clearly outdated , also not sure how bioshock infinite , uncharted , god of war , batman etc can be consider meh . 
  it 's not , down vote and report that crap . 
   it was supposed to begin in january, 
  where are you did you see that ?

  removed . 
  do not : personally attack other users . 
  they are ** nearly ** identical ( which is all shot for shot means in this context ) , yes they are a homage , as wachowskis have said . 
  but anyways that 's not really the point of my comment , what i 'm saying is that this movie ( johansson 's one ) would not be able to do a shot for shot remake of those scenes and get the same impact , ( at least it will not have the same impact for me ) as when the matrix came out .

  this is a warning .

  it would most likely violate copyright laws , so doubt they would be able to do that . 
  op when did you order yours ? 
  i 'm making this the `` megathread '' so we can keep reposts down to a minimum . 
  hope you do n't mind op , but if you do i make undo this . 
  try using paypal ? 
  or you can also get any game on psn from amazon btw . 
  nowhere in that article ( which is the same as [ this reuters piece ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/01/12/sony-ceo-idusl3n0um09h20150112 ) ) does it say that they are ready to pull the plug on these divisions . 
  it is highly misleading , but your comment is also wrong . 
  sony did n't say that , a citigroup analyst did . 
  you are thinking of / r/tech , although i remove duplicate of the same story and things that are only tangibly relate to tech ( like that cop link ) , there are still going to be some net neutrality , and comcast . 
  are you really quoting john mcafee ? 
  that dude is crazy and has no credibility whatsoever . 
  he also sold his company more than a decade ago , i do n't see how he is relevant to anything . 
   we 've learned the last bits of their counter-intuitive anti-ddos security measures have been apparently ironed out , as fans who previously saw their accounts get ip-blocked are now able to log in and play the game ( thanks , neogaf ) . 
  it 's worth noting that ip-unblocking began as early as last november . 
   the game was locked off to foreign players due to a nasty ddos attack on the game , last june . 
  fta , i do n't see how those two things are related , looks like this ip block is a fairly new thing they added to prevent ddosing . 
   seller refurbished, 
  not new , and not even official refurbished . 
  may have bought it if it was new . 
  no url shorteners . 
  [ you forgot to add http : / / ] ( http://massively.joystiq.com/2015/01/12/planetside-2-players-planning-world-record-attempt-for-jan-24 ), 
  looks promising ... hopefully it 's not some remote play type thing that was rumor a while back ( although the rumor was with windows phone i think ) . 
  i thought this was a once a year thing ?
