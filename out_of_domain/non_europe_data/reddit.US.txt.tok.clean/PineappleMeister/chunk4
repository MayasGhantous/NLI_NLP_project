  comment above your has one but [ here ] ( http://www.joystiq.com/2005/11/08/playstation-3-wont-play-used-games/ ) . 
  [ nothing will happen , unlike ms in the 90s , good has been ~ ~ bribing ~ ~ lobbying our politicians so they do n't get sue and it worked .

  are n't there only 4 nex photo cameras ? 
  nex-f3 which is cheap one , nex-5r mid-range , and nex-6 and nex-7 as the high end ones ? 
  ( i think there is one ff video camera too ), 
  this is from today ( like from an 1 hour ago ) at nvidia ces conference ... just saw the link ... 
  i was reading the verge liveblog where they link [ to this ] ( http://live.theverge.com/live-from-nvidia-ces-2013/ ) ... this is the one that i meant to post oops http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/6/3844870/nvidia-grid-servers-cloud-gaming, 
  edit : delete it as old news , anyway i ca n't believe i read the whole post and did n't see the date . 
  also damn the verge for linking to this in the liveblog for today 's ces conference, 
  now this from today i look at the date this time ... 
  no it doesnt ,, 
  fta :, 
   it also is the first quad-core processor with cortex a15 cores on-board , and offers compatibility with lte networks through an optional chip ... 
   ... announced alongside the tegra 4 was the i500 soft modem , which is essentially a reprogrammable baseband solution that is capable of utilizing a wide variety of networks . 
  the chip , which is an optional addendum to the tegra 4 platform to enable lte support , is able to process 1.2 trillion operations per second and is 40 percent the size of a conventional baseband chip . 
  \\ ^ engaget article, 
  the verge says the same thing , there is no integrated lte , emphasis on ** integrated **, 
  edit : formatting . 
   we 've had a 20 + percent decline in pc sales -- it 's like `` holy cow that 's not what the new generation of the operating system is supposed to do . '', 
  is he blaming that on the release of windows 8 ? 
  i feel like this is weird statement due to the way that can be interpreted . 
  damn things are going bad for the 787 just last week the faa launched a full-scale review of the plane , after another emergency landing . 
  the mazda 6 is beautiful . 
  is n't the web based store suppose to be coming this month ? 
  so i would n't be surprise it was relate . 
  you can cancel auto renew from the sony entertainment network site . 
  link ? 
  nice , just purchased my ps + game , it 's very smooth , and the video player is actually really nice , but they still need to improve a few things imo the `` style '' needs polishing and sonyentertainmentnetwork.com they could find a smaller domain ? 
  i mean sen.com looks to be a blog why not give them a nice check for the domain , hell sen.sony.com would be so much better than now . 
  also a community section and profile page where i could see my trophy would be nice . 
  edit : than  them, 
   also , fun fact - the architects secretly snuck a massive cross into the design of the hotel . 
  i very much doubt that that is a cross and not just coincidence . 
  that horizontal line thing that makes that look like a t is a viewing deck , and the vertical line is suppose be a mast as the building is suppose to look like a sail iirc . 
  edit : also looking a wiki it says that the architect is agnostic . 
  got my vertical and horizontal lines wrong ... 
  [ super slims ps3 also is easy to swap the hdd . 
  ] ( http://www.gamespot.com/features/how-to-change-the-new-super-slim-ps3-hard-drive-6396942/ ), 
  which tablet do you have ? 
  sony 's interface is very close to stock . 
  man , i 'm exited !!, 
  ca n't wait to get one ,, 
  * checks bank account *, 
  maybe i can wait , hopefully i get a few months before i can buy it ... 
  [ anyways here is screen shot i stole from the verge may it be this ? 
  man , cutouts suck . 
  great , and it does n't conflict with the css of any of my subs . 
  although i like it better on top of the search but i had already move it with css so it 's no big deal . 
   pentile display . 
  oh god why ? 
  i hope like it says in the article that it wont matter but i heard people say that you could n't see it on sgs3 but it is noticeable and there is a clear difference between pentile and non-pentile screen even at 720p . 
  i guess i will just have to wait and see , definitely i will have to see it in person if i decide to buy it . 
  it wo n't be the people who are here that you have to worry about asking that question . 
  nope only 2 ps3 models have software emulation the special edition mgs4 ps3 and the [ 80gb model ] ( http://us.playstation.com/support/compatiblestatus/index.htm ) it didnt even work as well as the early models and it was never remove from those models . 
  would you ever go back a run ms ? 
  same here , when i was reading the first 3 books i could read many chapters in one seating . 
  now after starting the 4 book my i find myself stopping every other chapter , i just really do n't care about many of the chapters . 
  i see the post it shows both of your comments , they were not remove by the filter or any other mod . 
  maybe that reddit is action up , but i cant do nothing about that . 
  reddit is action weird i try to hit context on this post from messages and it 's like it does n't exits it looks like i can still reply form messages though . 
  something is up with reddit . 
  no , this is not a pm . 
  and yes reddit is action weird , could be do to the bill gates ama something reddit breaks when an ama gets too popular . 
  funny enough i ca n't see this post on the comment thread haha, 
  / r/crypto is bigger, 
  mods were asleep and no one report it but it 's remove now . 
  i going to have to fix this on my subreddits , as it is only showing the submit text button , although i 'm not sure i want 2 bottoms , the only people i have seen confuse the buttons have been spammers who submit a text post instead of a link . 
  but my subs are small maybe it is a problem on the bigger reddits . 
  thanks you , although if possible i thinking of going with the 2 buttons but instead of being one on top of the other . 
  i thinking of making them smaller having something like this | text | | link | side by side in the same position , as i correctly have the one bottom . 
  but any changes will have to wait until late tonight or tomorrow when i get time to do it . 
  thank you !, 
  will test it later and change it accordingly if it does n't work . 
  thank you , i got it the way i want it now . 
  only had to change your code a little . 
  this what i end up doing . 
  . sidebox.submit.submit-link { right : auto ; }, 
  / r/awesome go there if you want to see how it looks . 
  again thank you . 
   xbox 360 , playstation 3 , and `` future-generation technology '' -- a not-so-subtle nod to the xbox 720 and playstation 4 . 
  is coming for this gen as well , so no need to get a new console for it . 
  although the one in the new console will probably be the best version of the game . 
  you should combine this with the [ rocket launch ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/photoshopbattles/comments/18nd9j/battle_53_bikini_atoll_via_last_weeks_winner/c8gcq5u ) one . 
  * edited for clarity *, 
  maybe that ** ' ** s made from discarded parts ? 
  i remember that an [ iphone 5 clone was release before the real thing was announce . 
  ] ( http://news.cnet.com/8301-17852_3-57506127-71/iphone-5-clone-maker-to-sue-apple-over-um-iphone-5-patent/ ) but then again that does n't look that similar . 
  nice , that 's perfect . 
   4.7-inch 1080p, 
  wow , htc seems to always ha ** ve ** the best displays , i wonder where they source them . 
  would n't be the first time , they make the camera for the iphone but the cameras on their phones are not as good . 
   can i submit any information about this event in a different thread /, 
  what about game announcements ? 
  i think games trailers etc should have a their own thread , but whatever lets this be a good show . 
  i do n't think that 's an asos spoiler unless i 'm remembering the book wrong .

   shuhei yoshida : so if we say that for ps4 you do n't have to wait for anything to play , and you can use many different devices to play and communicate with other people , ** and you can instantly try many of the games on the store , is n't it unique ? 
  emphasis on ** and ** , the unique part he is talking about is the instant play thing with gaikai there is nothing like that on the pc ( except maybe for onlive but did n't they die last year ?
