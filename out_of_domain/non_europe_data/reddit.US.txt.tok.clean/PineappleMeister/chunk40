  i almost forgot we did n't resign kuroda , but i thought nova was coming back this year ? 
   [ amc and wetv are included in all of the playstation vue packages ] ( http://blog.us.playstation.com/2015/03/27/amc-networks-join-playstation-vue/#sf8251990 ), 
  it 's in the lowest price plan too . 
  why ? 
  i do n't see how that makes sense . 
  really , what 's block ? 
  i played around with it a bit when it launched and i looked up a bunch of prime time shows and they were all there . 
  are you talking about sports ? 
  i did n't check that but sports have blackout rules and even regular cable services . 
  but still i do n't see amc doing that , sony and amc have a good relationship since sony made breaking bad and now better call saul, 
  well idk then , would be nice if we had a list what 's block , tried googling it but could n't find anything other than a wall street journal piece that say a small number of shows were block but does n't say what or how much is small . 
  lol this photo is my all time top post from like a year ago . 
  it had the exact same title , oh this is first time one of my post has been reposted by a repost bot , yey . 
  this is the [ source . 
  ] ( https://secure.flickr.com/photos/markandrupa/5587591737/sizes/o/in/photostream/ ), 
  also [ different angle ] ( https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5094/5588183452_8da778a0df_b.jpg ) . 
  i would actually buy a mail box that tells me if i have mail ( more importantly a package ) waiting for me w/o me having to check it . 
  i just remember i have ups my choice that does just that ... 
  lol . 
  abp rule for an april fools joke ... 
  also it does n't actually link anywhere . 
  links are disable . 
  the links are just reference for the css . 
  oh i do n't mind , i just thought it would be easier to turn of the stylesheet until tomorrow ( even i had to do it for other april fool jokes today ... ) . 
  abp rules seems a little over killed to me . 
  took down `` the game '' . 
  you can now remove the abp rule if you want . 
  sub will be running normally for now , so i removed this and other `` the game '' post . 
  back to normal rules . 
   sony is acquiring important parts of onlive , and their plans do n't include a continuation of the game service in its current form . 
  your service should continue uninterrupted until april 30 , 2015 . 
  no further subscription fees will be charged , and you can continue to play all of your games until that date . 
  wow , what a sad end for that company but it was of their own making ( well that horrible ceo making ) i remember before sony bought gaikai it was rumor that they made an offer to onlive but they did n't take it . 
  later after the purchase of gaikai , there was news that onlive was looking for close to 2 billion dollars . 
  semi related note , it 's pretty shit that you ca n't no longer search for old joystiq articles . 
  edit : found a source not what i was looking for whatever works . 
  [ `` people started to leave , and they were n't replaced : around december 2011 the company instituted a hiring freeze . 
  with over 200 staffers , unused servers and an expensive office in the heart of downtown palo alto , the company was feeling the crunch , and it did n't look like perlman was interested in saving the firm . 
  he 'd allegedly turned down offers from sony , dell , and adobe in the past . 
  i had hope a-rod was batting in a ~ ~ lower ~ ~ higher spot in the line up . 
  oh i meant to type higher ... 
  lol a-rod has no luck , dickey starts having problems , they make a pitching change before he is up , now the same . 
   big thanks to / u/flyingcloud11 [ 1 ] for implementing the css, 
  you see here . 
  looks great , if i do say so myself . 
  this looks oddly familiar lol . 
  nice job on the sub btw . 
  lol it 's this game going to turn into a pitching duel cause that 's not what i expected . 
  edit : never mind . 
  so it 's settled a-rod bats 3rd from now on . 
   it was made ( likely ) in anticipation of the rebranding before it was known that it was just going to be spotify . 
  yep , you guess right and also so that it would n't be made private . 
  ( if anyone wants to mod it just message me i will add you as mod ) . 
  i personally think / r/spotifymygame is doing a great job already , so the sub might not be needed . 
  sell it , i was watching one on ebay for a while and like 1 day after onlive die it was bought by someone . 
  the golden sombrero is striking out four times . 
  who has done that ? 
  exatly what i was thinking , like cano 's bunt [ double from a couple of years ago . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzth29d337a ), 
  i never understood why we sign beltran ( hoping he proves me wrong this inning ), 
  oh fuck i just remembered they had to take out a-rod so he no longer batting next inning . 
  it does that , when am deletes a headset post it posts a comment telling users about the wiki and other useful subreddits . 
  how many innings did rogers pitched yesterday ? 
  iirc he had like 40 pitches . 
  edit : looks like he went 2.1 , i never like when relievers do back to back days after a game like yesterday . 
  god damn it . 
  even if we tie it we have no one to pitch after this inning or can we use a starter ? 
  who 's rested enough ? 
  damn !, 
  we can do this !, 
  those knuckle balls do n't look all that knuckle bally to me . 
  they do n't move like dickey . 
  oh god , wat u doing . 
  damn that was close but that last frame show he was out . 
  rogers should not still pitching . 
  40 pitches yesterday and now the same today ? 
  i do n't think it 's the same ( from what i remenber other saying about reliving and starting ) but i get your point . 
  between yesterday and today he has basically pitched a full game ~ ~ almost ~ ~ more than 100 pitches . 
  lol i just remember that there was an ad for a news broadcast that was coming after the game , i wonder how they feel . 
  he hit a double in the 11 got pinch run for . 
  [ that black leather one looks somewhat pretty , ] ( https://i.imgur.com/hiohrgy.png ) ca n't say the same for the other leather ones . 
  the plastic ones are very nice looking though . 
  but are we sure this is the g4 and not some other phone . 
  the specs there are not what i expected . 
  basic specification | |, 
  frequency | 2g ( gsm/edge ) 3g ( hspa +42 mbps / hspa +21 mbps ) lte ( svlte , csfb , ca , volte rcs , mimo ), 
  cpu | qualcomm \u00ae snapdragon \u2122 up to 2.5 ghz / quad-core processor, 
  os | android 4.4.2 kitkat ( the specs page say it 's kitkat but the screenshots are lollipop ), 
  battery | 3,000 mah / replaceable / wireless charging, 
  display | 5.5 '' size ( inch ) quad hd ( 2560 x 1440 ), 
  internal | 2gb ram / 16gb emmc or 3gb ram / 32gb emmc, 
  external | micro sd : 128gb ( up to 2tb ), 
  although i never trust press shots for phone cameras , the camera app itself looks very nice . 
  at first i just saw this line and the battery . 
  and thought those were the specs it was n't after i edited my comment and made the table above that i saw that one of the options . 
  but i wanted a bigger battery ( but i always want a bigger battery ) . 
  since it 's a 5.5 qhd screen i think it could have had a bigger battery , i 'm interested in seeing what battery life it gets . 
  why is arod all away up on the six spot ? 
  is n't this the same line up as opening day ? 
  damn we batted around .
