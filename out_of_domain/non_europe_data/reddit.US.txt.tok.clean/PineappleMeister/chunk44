  there was one last inning . 
  we are winning by 4 do we really need to sent in betances ? 
  it feels like we are using him in every game . 
  actually it looked like drew was taking his sweet as time to get home . 
  so the lets use anything as an excuse ~ ~ to drink ~ ~ for upvotes party ? 
  is this happening in this season ? 
  : / i hope it does n't end in the same cliff hanger as the book . 
  you are not shadowbanned on / r/pcgaming . 
  ( hell you made a post just a couple of weeks ago that had upvotes and replies ) i do n't think we banned anyone for posting gg related post . 
  it 's early i think you guys are panicking too much regarding cc , the game is still in the first inning . 
  lol i thought colome was a good pitcher ? 
  he is giant . 
  cc is 300 + i think , they mention it on today 's broadcast . 
  i want that the ellie and riley and the god of war one . 
  but damn they are $ 50 and $ 40 respectively , so $ 90 + tax and getting them frame , in a nice gallery frame , will probably set me back $ 40 each . 
  so it would cost me in total about ~ $ 170 ... kinda too much and i also need to find a place to put them . 
  that said i may actually order that last of us one , i will give it until the end of the week . 
  lets see if i convince myself to get it . 
  my predictions, 
  * they will scrap the driveclub ps + , the full driveclub game will the first aaa ps4 game on ps + . 
  * project morpheus gets official name . 
  * playstation league . 
  * ps vita gets something . 
  * trailers for 4 aaa exclusives . 
  ( naughty dog , santa monica , bend studio , sucker punch ), 
  * playstation mobile replacement . 
  ( probably not since they did n't say anything at gdc ), 
  * 30 minutes of useless corporate shit . 
  ( sales , synergy , one sony and etc ), 
   no it wo n't . 
  even if they do that ( as they should ) , that would only make it the 2nd aaa ps4 game on ps + . 
  well it 's a prediction so we have to wait and see , 
  i 'm guessing you mean injustice being the first ? 
  i was n't really counting that since it was a remastered . 
  but yea i guess that 's the first . 
  see yankees , that 's how you hit with players on base , take note and do the samething next time . 
  nice !, 
  well had no one else is to make us one . 
  if you want to give give it a shot we would greatly appreciated . 
  i do n't think we can use copyrighted characters in the ad , but thank you for the effort . 
  i may be the only car enthusiast that likes that lexus . 
  yea could be tune down a little but i stilllike it . 
  that said i do n't think i would ever buy a crossovers so yea . 
  to anyone interested in the service , you should also subscribe to / r/playstationnow , we could kinda use more people ,

  the recent gm recall was worse in comparison . 
  but i 'm guessing there has n't been more deaths because the defect happens in places with humid climates from what i read . 
  just tuned in , what did i miss with betances ? 
  what was he saying ? 
  removed . 
  this is a warning .

  completely agree , it 's bad enough that it made me turn off the beta . 
  pretty useless update imo , but apparently it 's easier on the eyes,
