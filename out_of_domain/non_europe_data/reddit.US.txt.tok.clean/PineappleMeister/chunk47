  green light !, 
  god damn , it 's headley the gidp . 
  no hitter , at 132 pitches holy shit . 
  are n't they better defensibly thought ? 
  and he is not that much better offensively . 
  damn ball is flying today . 
  why is a-rod not in the line up ? 
  cause of day game ? 
  lol i totally forgot about the new search page , i still use the old one . 
  i will fix it when i get back to a pc . 
  youtube anyone ? 
  i 'm on a phone , sadly it does n't . 
  they do n't work on a phone . 
  i will probably use the radio if nothing else . 
  was thinking of s.w.a.t. 
  when i read the sinopsis . 
  looks very good imo . 
  now that i know i wo n't be getting the note , i need a new phone to upgrade to this is definitely in the running . 
  just want to see sony 's thing and the new iphone is . 
  you can do that pretty easily with ifttt.com and rss feed . 
  however , i do n't think everything posted in those blogs are worthy of a post . 
  edit : but yea this sub is pretty dead , this is the 3rd post in the front page and i just notice it was posted 3 days ago . 
  holy shit anyone have video of medic preforming cpr ? 
  looks like you are right , the youtube stream allows reviewing and it looks like it may have been another fan . 
  did n't give that one to dellin thought , shitty ump . 
  will stop watching for a week is otaku kid from wwz dies, 
  god damn these leads are fucking unlikable . 
  no exceptions !, 
  and where is the food ? 
  come on amc it 's the little things that make or break a story . 
  damn those are some ugly babies, 
  porcello has 9 strike outs ? 
  the fuck ? 
  i was 100 % sure they were going to overturn . 
  i would be really pissed if that happen to us . 
  front camera, 
  sony came out strong today , can wait to see what google does with the nexus . 
  i agreed 100 % it 's one thing to have a megathread about one thing , say one for sony , one for moto etc. 
  having one thread for 50 different things is lazy and does n't allow for discussion . 
  i do n't think that 's a problem , what can you really expect today that 's not ifa relate ? 
  you have threads that are over a day old on the first page of the front page . 
  what you did just made the front page stale , also you have thread up about rumors for thing that were announce today but the announcement threads are removed that 's just illogical . 
  damn murphy !, 
  so not only did we have to use betances but now miller ? ... . 
  the hell happen to warren ? 
  sorry dd , but that shit better be an error . 
  so now that 's a hit and no error , fucking fuck and here i was having a pleasant day watching a great game , now i 'm pissed . 
  ca n't , already drunk too much . 
  [ i want a a-rod strong , bracelet . 
  prince fielder ? 
  compromises !, 
  i never watch late shows but if it 's like this i can see myself turning into it . 
  or at least dvring it . 
  any live streams that work on mobile ? 
  drew has to make that catch but headley throw was garbage . 
  holy shit is correct , did n't expect something like that . 
  it was , i 'm looking forward to watching the full interview , i wonder how long they take to put it up . 
  hopefully it 's early , but cbs has been horrible with that in the past from my experience . 
  yes , it said full interview available on the site . 
  well what a short game , we had ... 
  i still think kay is pretty bad . 
  but i do prefer him to these guys , we are probably just more use to him . 
  :( the yankee bot is not doing previews videos today ? 
  homers , homers , homers , homers ... . . 
  i did n't know i was watching the home run derby . 
  defense !, 
  ! frsqefasdgf, 
  first pitch was a 99 fast ball . 
  if when it was 4/4 , we were going to win , we would have had to score at least 1 anyways . 
  so ... lets do that . 
  aahh this game is making me want to buy a ticket and go the game . 
  if we score do we leave betances in and save miller for the next game or would that be too much ? 
  oh shit it 's bird !, 
  you can also just steal the bots table .

  btw you can delete the 0 of the inning that have n't been play and they will show up as empty spots , it helps with legibility . 
  itt : no one click the article . 
   in a draft presentation from early 2006 bittorrent flanks other buying opportunities such as tivo and netflix . 
  i was pretty close to dropping the show after the first 2 episodes . 
  but this one is what i have been wanting since this was announced . 
  total collapse of civilization is what i want . 
  read the world war z book , iirc the japanese kid is in a higher rise and has to climb down, 
  hope this lead dude dies , no half measures . 
  the fuck was that ells ? 
  oh it hit the catwalk fuck !, 
  so tied game , most likely . 
  edit : ok and fuck ells . 
  i posted when i thought it was a homer . 
  see my ninja edit . 
  i fucking hate when girardi does that , i know he probably has a good reason for doing it in his binder but for fuck sake it 's only one more out . 
  miguel sano , i think it was . 
  do n't worry guys he just wanted to lower that 500 avg that loney has against him . 
  meh put arod on first i think he will be play fine . 
  that said , only reason i do n't want him on the field is cause we do n't have anymore off days . 
  arod was one of the best defenders in the league , i think he would play well enough . 
  i would be more concern about his range than his glove . 
  i do n't expect him to be a golden glover , i just expect his bat to be worth more than a mediocre defense at first .
