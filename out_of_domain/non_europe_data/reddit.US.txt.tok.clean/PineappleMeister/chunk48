  save a gidp via luck ... 
  was release more than 2 years ago for the ps3 , gt7 will be on the ps4, 
  this is a story about it i think , shows 3 brothers who have fully form breast . 
  nsfw video , https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ublv_q0u00, 
  edit : reading about it looks like it may not be the same thing . 
  2 seconds at 1000fps is like 2 minutes in real time play back . 
  [ sony release a laptop ] ( http://i.imgur.com/tg3nb78.jpg ) like this back in 2011/10 , it had an external radeon gpu , connected via a usb light peak cable , ( light peak was thunderbolt before it became thunderbolt and use display port ) , i wanted one but that thing was super expensive from what i remember . 
  hey anyone have anything that works on mobile ? 
  looks like it 's broken for me as well , i will look into it when i get home . 
  should be working now , ... for the most part . 
  the animation looks weird for some reason now . 
   they have already said that they will never allow psn id changes, 
  no they do n't last time i heard then say anything on the subject they said the corporate `` we are looking into it '' response they always give . 
  beautiful !, 
  i need a gif of that last pitch !, 
  now !, 
  did n't pedro martinez say that the mets forcing him to pitch injured or something like that ? 
  source ? 
  anyone know if the youtube link will be available today ? 
  how many ball have there been already this inning ? 
  who do we have in the pen ? 
  `` back door '' shit was 3 feet outside . 
  well that was a game ... 
  i kinda expected the monopoly man ( actual name rich uncle pennybags ... ) to be the yankees one . 
  with the exception of lbp3 , they are also all ~ $ 19.99 on amazon when you buy them directly from them . 
  [ however , they are all temporally out of stock , ] ( http://i.imgur.com/oyyoa3k.png ) you can still buy them but you will have to wait for them to ship . 
  wow that was dirty . 
  are the announcers really saying that that look like a regular slide ? 
  why did n't they let colon continue to pitch ? 
  i 'm still unfamiliar with the review rules but i thought infield plays were not reviewable ? 
  puig is a bench player ? 
  what happen to him ? 
  if that run counts that would be one of the worse things i have seen in baseball . 
  if a post season game is decide by that i will honestly say i will be very disappointed , do n't care if the rule was correct . 
  lol at people complaining about the fans , you bet your ass that if that was your team in this game and that happen , the same thing would happen . 
  come on andrus ... 
  they do n't sell beer in grocery stores in canada ? 
  wow i thought that was a civilized country . 
  i feel that those call have been fine but whatever . 
  does cueto pitch next game ? 
  which will probably get them an antitrust suit if they continue , or maybe not . 
  after ms , every big tech company spends millions lobbying which ms was n't doing when they got sued . 
  damn , those calls ... . 
  volquez ca n't really paint the lines considering the ball call he got . 
  jays ca n't trust their pen with a 5 run lead ? 
  damn , even i have to admit that bautista is amazing baseball to watch . 
  what 's with all the delete comments , removing them does n't really help . 
  mods should just message the admins to get the glitch fixed . 
  yes lets click `` none of these '' . 
  - said no one ever . 
  i do n't believe it . 
  as it would be such a shitty thing to do , that i doubt the royals have not told him . 
  imo he needs to know he needs to know even if it cause them the game . 
  100 pitches , will they leave cueto in for the last 2 ? 
  since i 'm hoping the mets see someone else , although considering the royals pen , i 'm not sure that a good think ... 
  huh , cueto is very good when he is good . 
  also knowingly sold aids tainted drugs . 
  the fuck mets , the hell are you doing !, 
  ned would leave him in . 
  lol , libre office . 
  came in expecting piccolo and gohan ...

  i subbed for gif recipes but the first post that came to ~ ~ by ~ ~ my frontpage was a meme ... 
   this is the third preloaded spyware scandal to hit lenovo this year : first it was caught installing superfish , which grossly compromised user security by installing a man-in-the-middle certificate into the operating system ; then it got caught loading immortal , self-reinstalling crapware into part of the bios reserved for custom drivers . 
  that said i personally do n't have a problem buying this power bank ( in fact i really want one ) or moto stuff since it 's a separate division/subsidiary . 
  seriously ?
