  i personally hate them i like solid style earbuds . 
  i was not really a fan of the book , specially the deus ex machina ending [ ready player one spoiler ] ( #s `` somehow finding the only 1up in the game by playing ms. pac-man '' ) , i did end up finishing it so it was n't all bad and i 'm looking forward to the movie . 
  but talking about books with vr elements , i liked snow crash more , although i have always consider that a parody , even thought i have been told by some people that it 's not . 
  does he still have plantar fasciitis ? 
  ( can that even be cure anyways ? ), 
  do you have pictures of the quality of the prints ?

  how did cc looked during sprint training ? 
  kinda sad that it looks like he put on more weight . 
  i felt he just needed to build muscle instead of gaining weight . 
  if he did n't feel right pitching when he was skinny . 
  colon pitched a great game better than all our starters so far , and the mets could n't even score 1 run ... 
  extracurricular activity ? 
  anyone at the game ? 
  from the blue jays thread . 
   [ im in the crowd . 
  at least two fights just happened . 
  1 in the 100 level 3rd baseline . 
  not sure exactly where the other was .
