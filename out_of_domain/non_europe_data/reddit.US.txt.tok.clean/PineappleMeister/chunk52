  oh ok , thanks . 
  not a good sign is a understatement . 
  this is going to be horrible , if the vision of the new owner and the people running the company differs . 
  if/when key personal start jumping ship , i think users should do the same .

   when asked whether apple 's customary 30 percent take of all app store purchases is a factor in negotiations , bezos said that `` private business decisions should stay private . '', 
  nah i kinda side with amazon on this cause why should they get 30 % just for allowing purchases on the app . 
  their decision not to support chromecast that one is bullshit . 
  if they do n't want to allow competing services that 's fine imo , what i do n't like it is allowing them only if they get a cut of the all purchases on the app which unlike a regular app on the appstore it does n't cost apple anything since they are not hosting/or processing any of the purchases as they would go through amazon . 
  just sent him a message to get him to verify his account , ~ ~ but as of right now . 
  no i ca n't verify he is from stardock . ~ ~,
