  i like it , maybe it will get a us release that 's not a year away . 
  cause right now apple fucked my plans to get an iphone this time if the leaks without a headphone jack are true . 
  so all that 's left for me are the next nexus and hoping this becomes an option too .

  so it really wo n't have the headphone jack ? 
  :( guess that leaves me with no choice but new nexus and i really wanted to go back to iphone this cycle . 
  or maybe i will get a 6s depending on the price . 
  then so be it , but i think if enough people do n't buy it they will revert back to the jack like they did with that no button ipod shuffle .

  came here to ask the same thing ... 
  like the one to terabithia we die a little inside . 
  got it throw right down the middle apparently, 
  i would put a starter if this was the show, 
  `` no one asked for this '' i could n't have put it better and i really wanted an iphone this year . 
  the only thing i found interesting about the pro is the back usb , i will most likely get it sometime in the future since i have psvr preordered and it will be better with the pro . 
  as of right now i do n't care for it . 
  exactly i 'm looking at the 6s depending on what happens with the pixel .
