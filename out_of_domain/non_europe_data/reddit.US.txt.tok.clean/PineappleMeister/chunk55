  i honestly do n't get pineda 6 so in 3 innings , how is it that it 's either strike outs or earn runs for him ? 
  sad cause he has the potential to be one of the best pitcher in the game . 
  probably cause i started watching ... 
  seriously we have a 5 run lead wtf are you going to the bullpen for ? 
  and yours was a better link too , since it 's directly from cpsc . 
   galaxy note7 owners should contact or visit the retail outlet where they purchased their device . 
  if you bought your note7 from samsung.com , you should contact us at 1-800-samsung and we can help you . 
  if you have any questions or concerns , contact us directly at 1-800-samsung . 
  what if you bought from a third party ? 
  ( craigslist , ebay , etc ) there does n't ' seem to be way to exchange those . 
   ** is it okay for me to continue using my note7 ? 
    because your safety is our utmost concern , we ask you to power down your galaxy note7 and exchange it now . 
  we strongly encourage you to take advantage of the u.s. note7 product exchange program in which we are offering note7 customers the opportunity to exchange their device for a galaxy s7 , a galaxy s7 edge or a new note7 ( pending cpsc approval ) . 
  if the car community are anything to go by with their willingness to ignore even more dangerous recalls i going to assume lots of people not actually fallowing this advice . 
  edit : i did n't buy the phone as some of the replies are assuming , a co-worker did he call samsung when the recall first started they told him to go to his carrier or place he bought it from . 
  he went to the carrier and they wo n't take it because it was not purchase through them . 
  and he got it from craigslist or some thing so he ca n't return it to where he bought it from . 
  last thing he told me he was trying to get in touch with the person who sold it to him . 
  lol ... 
  takes out pineda after 2 shitty ground balls but leaves cessa to turn the game into a home run derby . 
  he was looking good that game . 
  we need to test if he will actually give us more than 4-5 innings .

  if these stories keep happening this is going to become a mandatory recall soon , and iirc that means it will become illegal to sell the phones even privately unless they are clear by cpsc . 
  i do n't see it on the recalls page . 
   cpsc and samsung are working cooperatively to formally announce an official recall of the devices , as soon as possible . 
  cpsc is working quickly to determine whether a replacement galaxy note7 is an acceptable remedy for samsung or their phone carriers to provide to consumers . 
  looks like they still have n't made an announcement . 
  i feel bad for judge at this point , i ca n't imagine what he must be feeling . 
  he ca n't seem to get anything right at the moment . 
  last time i was looking for cheap tickets the difference between those seats and better seats was negligible . 
  eh just bring sev in let him pitch the rest of the game . 
  i thought samsung said that the bad batteries where from their own battery division ? 
  and it 's the reason why note 7 ** sold ** ( not made ) in china have been fine since they are using a chinese supplier . 
  my bad it was n't samsung directly that said it was samsung sdi . 
   samsung electronics is expected to switch to china 's atl as its main supplier of batteries for its galaxy note 7 , with its samsung sdi affiliate being widely blamed for faulty batteries in the smartphone that have prompted a damaging recall . 
   analysts estimate samsung had relied on sdi for nearly 70 per cent of the note 7 batteries , before cases of the phone catching fire during or after charging emerged , resulting in a global recall . 
  atl , a key apple supplier , is likely to provide the majority of note 7 batteries for the time being , while the company works out the exact cause of the fault . 
  i almost forgot that the original story was in the ny post ... 
  which is not known for their jurnalistic integrity to say the least ... 
  3 for 4 is still a great night for castro . 
  non need to remove it to do any of that . 
  dp dp dp dp dp, 
  betances may be wild and unpredictable at times and does n't know how to short throw for shit but there 's no other reliever in our team that i would want more in now than him . 
  walk him !, 
  ok betances what are you doing ... . 
  well dellin lost his job,

  is starlin castro out for the year ? 
  i going to be honest i thought hanley was going to be a bust and panda would be a fine , and look how it turn out . 
  keep it civil . 
  why is it so empty today ? 
  lol why would you pitch even after that long mound discussion . 
   it will probably be a lexus and then some string of nonsensical letters followed by an f in the us . 
  seems unlikely considering lexus already has a new sporty 2 seater coming out with the lexus lc500, 
  who the fuck took the kryptonite out it 's lead box ?
