  samsung sdi 's battery , were thought to be the cause in the originals but they stop using them in the replacements notes , these are supposedly atl and are also having problems from the looks of it . 
  so this might be ortiz last at bat , a double of the monster would be a fitting last at bat imo . 
  would you be willing to sell one like that and if so for like how much, 
  like how the title just says `` uploaded to social media '' , could n't you have said twitter or some shit . 
  pretty sure it 's a federal crime to bring a gun on a plane also . 
  the people i feel bad about are 7 edge + owner , i bet who ever is responsible for checking this wo n't be able to tell the difference between the two . 
  oh right i got the name confuse with the 6 edge + . 
  but yea yours is the one i 'm talking about .
