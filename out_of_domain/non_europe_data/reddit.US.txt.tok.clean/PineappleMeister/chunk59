   world 's first desktop holographic display . 
  it draws objects in air with light . 
  from the ks page , this video however from 4 years ago ( and in there it says the tech use is from 2006 ) shows the same principal being use . 
  another one, 
   we have invented how to control air within a box shaped section of space to precisely modify the ri within specific regions to refract and reflect a laser beam . 
  this modification raises the `` albedo '' which is defined as the proportion of the incident light that is reflected by a surface , as well as the refractive properties at the boundary between the modified and unmodified air . 
  therefore by simultaneously controlling the aim of the laser and the position of a modified air column ,, 
  they put a fan in a box , giving them more control of the air that the image is display on , the tech that produces the image is the same . 
  this one posted by another user has a closer set up to ops look at the end schematics . 
  if they are just doing projection onto fog that would be incredibly misleading to the point of being false advertising and illegal . 
  as that tech is very old . 
  but the whole thing is very vague , there is a youtube video were he is doing an interview and doing all he can to try not to answer how it works . 
  damn i actually want that 67 chrysler imperial too bad i live in an apartment .

   imagine how much more active our community would be if we all converged into / r/playstation, 
  and you would n't be about to find anything due to the volume of post . 
  i like it that 's there are multiple specialize subs i sub only to the system and games i own . 
  i own every playstation system except a vita and have no plans to get one so i wo n't sub to their subreddit . 
  i do n't care much for trophies but lots of people do so i wo n't sub to / r/trophies . 
  there are valid reason for specialize subs to exists they make the general ones better imo . 
  every time i go to vote i always think we need to bring back the debate about [ seceding ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/partition_and_secession_in_new_york ) from upstate , maybe next time , 
  i ca n't believe it 's this close honestly if i did n't have to work tomorrow i would be drinking ... hard ... , damn this would be so much fun drunk :(, 
  what channel ? 
  maybe you need to drink more ... it solves all problems one way or another , 
  yea , but it 's up to albany i doubt they will ever allow it , there 's too much money involve even if the politics are total opposites . 
  gary johnson sends his regards . 
  if trump wins let 's bet on impeachment date !, 
  4/2018 for $ 100 . 
  \u00af \\ \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) \\ _ / \u00af at this point everything sucks . 
  should n't be this close . 
  how the fuck is pennsylvanian in play ?
