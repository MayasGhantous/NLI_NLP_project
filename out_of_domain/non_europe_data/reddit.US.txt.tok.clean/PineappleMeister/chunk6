  [ random guy on twitter works for ign ] ( http://www.ign.com/wikis/ign/greg_miller ) and he was covering today 's conference . 
  but here same random guy . 
  pretty sure the gif is of girl with kingdom hearts keyblade here nsfw http://i.imgur.com/yspurdw.gif, 
  was it this ? 
  nsfw the connection to gaming is the keyblade from kingdom hearts . 
   mayor bloomberg said it was too expensive and impractical to put up simple safety railings in nyc subways ... 
  but spent $ 12 million on gun control advertisements . 
  factually they do n't give a shit if a few people a year get crushed under trains . 
  ** of his money ** , you make it sound like he is spending city money . 
  so this is not your pic ? 
  if it is your school go out there and get us a better pic !, 
  we demand it . 
  [ all books ] ( #b `` i 'm going to assume he is a reader due to his choice in character '' ), 
  this is a no piracy sub , please do n't link or comment on how to hack a system for purpose of piracy . 
  yes , most high end ( android ) phones and some mid range phones come with mhl so you only need a micro usb-to-hdmi , and you have video out . 
  not talking about you but about the comments i had to remove . 
  neogaf has made some of the best gif , this are 2 of my favorite from the ps4 announcement thread, 
  [ alternative reality white house ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xhztef5.jpg ), 
   lots of really high price estimates in this thread, 
  because those are the real ones , the one you link to is a `` knockoff '' or replica what ever you want to call it . 
  the darth vader one is pretty nice . 
  also those planes would look nice on a canvas . 
  read this thread you will find it there wo n't link to it because you should find it , and it is a really good thread that you should read , people still post even today . 
  fyi you can ctrl + f, 
  they also introduce this 4k media player and 4k distribution service , so if you can pay for one these i think you would buy both . 
  well they did also unveil a 50 and 30 inch 4k oled monitor , but i think it was under one of the non consumer brand so it will probably wo n't be this `` cheap '' . 
  [ `` fixed '' the damn eyes ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fs8hrtq.jpg `` made it worse !! '', 
  ) lets play spot the difference !, 
  those are dangerous best you get one of [ these ] ( http://i.imgur.com/u1q162b.jpg ),

  try this, 
  coincidentally enough i learned today that mitsubishi is building japan 's first domestically made jet fighter , maybe they will call it the zero and ~ ~ than ~ ~ then we can have a wwii reunion . 
  hehehe you commented while i was changing the image because i notice the ball so you [ saw ] ( http://i.imgur.com/va0qicq.jpg ) . 
  ahh i missed this thread but oh well here . 
  i put [ this image ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xwggvbl.png ) on the sub as a `` splash '' page when you clicked it would take you inside the reddit , but i got this message in like a minute after it went up . 
   by not putting up bullshit splashscreens . 
  do n't pander for money . 
  the way you mods run this subreddit is disgusting . 
  i only put the donation button there that that people would click the image and go inside the reddit , but i still remove the button had [ this up ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vaolghg.png ) after that . 
  yes it is supports cross-buy , here is the [ official blog ] ( http://guacamelee.com/?p=369 ) where it says it supports it . 
  the sen store is not that great so lots of thing that should be obvious are not done or done incorrectly . 
  most companies will fire you for that , remember the guy that posted about his new google before google announce his position even existed then he got fire , and he was so excited about his new job too . 
  . nsfw-stamp acronym { color : #ac 3939 ; }, 
  nsfw tag, 
   birth certificate, 
  long form ? 
  delete this, 
  and add this, 
  . morelink . nub { display : none ; }, 
  you mean like / r/minecraft ` background ' ? 
  edit : look at this post, 
  [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/csshelp/comments/1av8uc/is_it_possible_to_have_the_header_change_every/c913e5g ), 
  wow , that was beautiful !, 
  i can help with most of that , i mod a few subs ( some examples / r/nasa / r/youtube , / r/awesome ) and willing to do the same however only one of the mod looks to be very active . 
  ` yes ' you can add and it gives you that effect, 
  text-shadow : 1px 1px 1px black!important ;, 
  unrelated but it you add overflow : hidden ; in the . link section , oh and remove overflow : hidden from . link . entry section your links will look better ( imo anyways . ), 
  first i going to watch thus far hopefully it is a good one . 
  although i do n't know wtf has happen so far . 
  is that fog ? 
  or smog ? 
  damn it !, 
  shit that looks bad ... 
  i just remember that i really hate commercials . 
  my cable is out :( not getting any signals . 
  edit looks like its only nbc ... 
  thank you !, 
  thanks . 
  #link - desc : after , #text - desc : after {, 
  display : block ;, 
  color : red ;, 
  content : `` text here '', 
  are you talking about this ? 
  #title - field.roundfield : after {, 
  display : block ;, 
  color : red ;, 
  content : `` text here '', 
  this should get you that . 
  cano !, 
  spam , sorry about that , he has been ban . 
  are you talking about the part that says freebies :-) ? 
  that 's the title you can change that in the subreddit settings it 's the first thing there . 
  i guess but if you consider this was a popular movie and amazon 's answer to netflix new original series , you would think that ~ ~ the ~ ~ they would have given it a better budget than a syfy series . 
  / r/buildapc, 
  i think it posting there would be better . 
  the / r/resissues is part of res itself you ca n't do that with reddit css ( afaik anyways ) , there is a way to ` pre-filed ' text however it not like what you are asking . 
  as for the big editor not sure what you want but try this . 
  . res . resbigeditorpop.bluebutton {, 
  background : #fff ;, 
  color : # 000 ;, 
  i do n't think it will work for what you are asking what it does is replace the original submit link to something like thing, 
  as you can see ( if you click it ) it basically adds what it in text here ( the % 20 is a space ) on the the text box ( or title ) . 
  oh sorry , i copy the wrong code ... but now it is fix . 
  people keep repeating this on reddit but i have yet to see any evidence of it and when ask the response is usually that they still have n't release versus or kingdom hearts but anyhow source ? 
  i going to assume that by name-bar , you mean pagename if so try this . 
  you need to remove or change the width top etc to fit your reddit .
