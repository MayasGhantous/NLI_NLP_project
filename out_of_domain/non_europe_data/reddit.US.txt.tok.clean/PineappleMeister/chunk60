  had 2 stocks i bought at 13 , sold one when it hit 22 . 
  kept the other one should just kept both of them . 
  still happy i ca n't even imagine how it would be if i had your gains .

  [ apparently the co-founder used to post , ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/robinhood/comments/3lbz40/psa_never_place_orders_at_market_price_with/cv51k1h/ ) he 's been mia for a year though . 
  but i agree with you op . 
  damn ... and i felt bad about my small investment . 
  yea , i should have gotten out when it hit 115 , and i would have made a even 100 bucks . 
  no trust me im different . . right ... although peak was like 120 it was climbing when i saw it at 115 and i had already sold one when it hit $ 20 something , so i hesitate . 
  but i dont care much i had already made back my money went i sold 1 of my shares ( had 2 ) still mad about it, 
  my plan is 4 lines with 10gb for $ 120 , if this a worthy upgrade ? 
  so that 's means i can add another line but my price stays the same ( except for taxes ? ), 
  taxi and truck drivers are fucked . 
  ( in like a 10 years , more or less . ), 
  i added the 1 line thru the site but it 's not showing up ? 
  the simcard order that i order is coming but not lines has been added to my tmobile page . 
  does it show up anywhere ? 
  i order it yesterday and nothing .

  what 's with the giant wii ? 
  and it was or have people forgotten the 90s ? 
  actually pundits were right , if if apple had kept going the way it was it would have been dead , it was only after steve jobs came back and change the way it was heading that it was save . 
  who 's going to save them this time ? 
  last i check jobs was still dead .

  this is not true anymore . 
  ~ ~ all ~ ~ most of those headphone sound better then the current earpods and all i have read say that the airpods say that they sound about the same as them . 
  that 's why people think it 's over price , i 'm one of the people who likes solid ear phones ( no silicone buds ) but if it turns out to be the same quilify i 'm not paying that kinda price . 
  also the whole changing devices quickly is not a new thing ( well i guess it is for ios now that i think about it ) i had a pair of sony h.ear in headphones which had the same thing using an nfc chip and worked great on android . 
  also the sound quality of them was amazing probably best wireless headphone i ever owned . 
  and i lost them and they are much bigger then these that the only other concern i have with the airpods . 
   sound quality is n't very important to most people - that 's why the most common earbuds are the earpods . 
  no , they are the most comment headphones because they are free . 
  i think people who will pay 150 for these expect better sound quality than 20 bucks earpods .
