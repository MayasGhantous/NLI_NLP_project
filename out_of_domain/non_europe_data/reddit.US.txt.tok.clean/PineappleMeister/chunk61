   amazon has been making records profits for how long, 
  they have n't actually , they maybe made record revenue but not profits as they invest lots of money in other things such as their web services business , which is paying off really well but also failures like the firephone . 
  their lack of profits for a long time was wall street 's biggest criticising of jeff bezos, 
  i never said otherwise , i was just correcting op who said they were making records profits , when that 's simply not true . 
  millions of people are already doing that without pokemon , looking at text , facebook , etc. 
  why ? 
  you guys think is worth it to buy more and have a multiple of 8 , and maybe as soon as the split happens . 
  or just bail now .

  yea , the clothes on the right look so modern . 
  it would need to be release in the us to be nominated . 
  well replied to the wrong comments . 
  anyways the academy only nominates films release in the us , except for foreign language award but i do n't think they nominate animated films to that award . 
  2001 was a long time ago , i doubt those numbers hold , mexico economy has been growing at one of the faster rates in the americas .
