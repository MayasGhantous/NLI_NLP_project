  goku is an idiot though , also it 's going to take a while before he gets there . 
   that having been said , i have no clue why `` ascended '' is n't in there . 
  it 's one of our older filters and probably due for review anyway . 
  pretty much , that rules is old enough that ascended was n't a widely used phrase . 
  i also remember having to remove some words because of how many false positives there were .

  btw you will need win 10 , if you are planning on playing xbox one games , lots ( all i think ? ), 
  that have been released on pc have been win 10 only . 
  pc is worthwhile . 
  it is illegal to buy stolen property , even if you did n't know . 
  no , the state only has to prove that * you should have known * , this is not the same as knowing that you are buying stolen property . 
  this can be things like not having a receipt or the item being too cheap , or in the back of a van etc. 
  so you could have not known you are buying stolen goods but if the state proves that a `` reasonable person '' would have known you are then breaking the law . 
  i will just copy my other comment but the burden is on the state to prove it was stolen , if you say you did n't know it was stolen .
