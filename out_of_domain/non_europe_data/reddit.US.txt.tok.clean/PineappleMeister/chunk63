  because it would increase operating cost , and probably the cost of the products . 
  some of these bill require manufactures to provide parts/tools/manuals for sell to consumers so that they can make their own repairs . 
  there are also fears of liability , are the manufacture liable is your repaired device burns your house down ? 
  that 's basically what we have now . 
  but that 's one of the things companies are saying these laws would change . 
  i 'm not particularly against these laws but here are many of them and some of them have real concerns , until all these points are iron out , it 's hard for me to be for or against them .

  i under estimate how much i used the head phone jack , this is honestly the best experience i have with a phone , but i 'm probably getting pixel when it comes out .

  i just kinda fucked up that sentences . 
  no fine print , there is a damn warning that pop up the middle of the screen ca n't really be missed . 
  something looks off about the costumes , they look like they are cosplaying . 
  vue is a better option , but more competition is always a good thing .

  balk lol . 
  i just tune in and there is a no hitter in progress ... 
  you ca n't never underestimate how much pitching affects the game . 
  edit : and defense lol, 
  is leyland the only one that wanted to manage ? 
  i mean he was already retired , right ? 
  lol did they just cut off the other game for this one on the mlb network . 
  nah to be honest i was kinda worry they would wait for the other one to be over . 
  why does the dr have home field advantage ? 
  does n't look like it lol . 
  i was trying to make a joke about the crowd but yea ... 
  did it rain today in mami ? 
  where the fuck is the replay ?? 
  i do n't mean challenge but just replay the play so we can see it better , i think they were doing that last usa game . 
  and updated , this one went like 7 innings without updates to the score . 
  i really do n't think it 's a big deal , let them play for what ever country they want imo . 
  i have seen some complaint about machado not playing for the us but if we go by citizenship only , the whole dr starting line up probably are naturalized citizens i know cano , beltre , bautista and cruz are . 
  no they did n't , he was out .

  dr really needs pujols at first . 
  how big does the lead have to be for the mercy rule to be called ? 
  i would go to a mets game for the first time in many many years for that . 
   i will now be in the bronx july 22, 
  ... doing what ? 
  i think it maybe a better idea to go to queens ...

  according to his attorney he has paid , so far this is just he said , she said . 
  also keep in mind this is the new york post , they are not know to for the journalistic integrity to says the least . 
  but if this is true shame on him dude has more than enough to pay for child support . 
  this better be something , as i am going skip the dr vs pr game cause this is much more important to me . 
  but this better not disappoint . 
  link ? 
  i have n't read anything about that in the nyt, 
  wow the move from miami changed the crowd a lot , looks kinda empty all the dr games have had lots more people, 
  that 's one is misleading cause it hit his wrist before he got it . 
  damn , another reason this should have been played in maimi . 
  this games sound so ... 
  i do n't know ` deflate ' ( ? ), 
  compere to the other games ( even the japan games sounded better ) . 
  i think it would have been much better for the wbc is the atmosphere was the same in this round . 
  i 'm hopping team us fans show up though . 
  was that same asshole . 
  any one getting mic feedback from the tv, 
  i got to say , this was not a good book / i did n't consider it horrible but i interested to see how they would write a interesting script out of it . 
  [ ` they better do something about the deus ex machina ending , cause i mean seriously a 1up smh ] ( #spoiler `` you r/awesome '' ), 
  it 's march , we do n't know what they would do . 
  you guys seem to be expecting that they would pay at peak form . 
  what a cry baby . 
  `` gracious '' i do n't think he know what that means .
