  it 's hard to actually see anything with the comouflage on , but it kinda looks like it 's keeping a lot of the ft-1 style .

  [ it 's obviously this guy . 
  to clarify the glitch was found and fixed during the development of mlb the show 17 . 
  lol just commenting to make the thread bigger . 
  vizio i think makes a 4k display that has non of that . 
  not even a tv tunner, 
  thank you , that satisfy what i wanted to know and i 'm not dropping it . 
  though i have stop reading books for things like this before , i like this book series enough not to . 
  that said i doubt i will be rereading them . 
  exactly , if it 's subtle enough you can attribute it to the catchers skill but this are so obvious that i put all the blame on a terrible ump . 
  you are both correct ( kinda of ) . 
  it was a borderline strike but a very high percentage of mlb ump do n't call it strike there . 
   althea , for me , was an unfortunate character . 
  i could n't stand her from the get go , but she was getting better toward the end . 
  i though she was one of the more tolerable pov in the earlier chapters , when compare to malta and keffria , those two have had the biggest growth throughout the series . 
  i honestly almost drop the book cause of malta 's pov chapters , now they are some of the best . 
  althea in contrast has n't had that much growth . 
  i still hate wintrow though . 
  his character seems to be trap in the same cycle of character development and regress . 
  well i guess i will have to finish to get a complete picture of things . 
  i wo n't say it ruined it for me ( at least not completely ) , i still like the series but it went from a series i would have reread , like asoiaf . 
  to one that i will finish but wo n't read again . 
  yea just got pass that part as you said it was a very uncomfortable read , it 's dampening my enjoyment of the book . 
  but i 'm almost done and i ca n't say i 'm not excited to find out how it all ends . 
  the problem with his last quote was that it read too much like things said when latin players were first being integrated . 
  but i 'm glad he was able to clarify what he meant but i do n't mind that people were affronted by it , it shows how much baseball has changed and in my opinion for the better . 
  i 'm kinda surprise by that question above since i always thought that was one of his more famous paintings .

  can you explain a little more ? 
  he is not ? 
  cause it 's been heavily hinted at since the farseer trilogy , and after liveship traders , i thought it was pretty much confirm . 
  interesting since so far from what i read i am or was pretty sure he was a woman . 
  i will be surprised if it turns outs he was man along . 
  although i guess he could identify as a woman and be a man ( but that does n't explain some stuff has happen so far ) or he maybe a hermaphrodite . 
  only thing i can tell now is that this probably wo n't be resolved in the next book either .

  i did before starting tawny man . 
   i think it is natural based on our culture , society , or what-have-you to try to say he is this or that , but when fitz presses the subject at one point , fool actually mocks him :, 
  i 'm not basing my opinion that he is a woman on culture but in the authors writing . 
  in liveships , we see [ liveships spoilers ] ( #s `` amber teach althea how to dress like a man '' ) , after how in assassin 's quest , [ assassin 's quest ] ( #s `` starling had accuse the fool of being a woman '' ) , i took this as the authors affirmation that the fool had been a woman . 
  in tawny man trilogy [ tawny man trilogy ] ( #s `` when jek shows up again , treats lord golden as a woman . 
  also when they fitz ask the fool if he was in love with him and they had the fight the fool says something along the lines `` you think i was saving my self for you '' , '' ) i do n't think i have ever read anything like that from anyone other than female characters . 
  there a couple of passing remarks that fitzs make were the fool takes a womanly tone when he is distress [ tawny man trilogy ] ( #s `` when fitz was dying for example . 
  another thing is when the fool shows fitz the tattoo he notes that the fool was facing the wall with his arm across , his chest . '', 
  ) now this is all circumstantial but i took it as the author saying that the fool was a woman and fitz was just not noticing it . 
  considering all the different opinions in this thread it look like this is not a solved matter , and could probably remain so even if the series ends . 
  it looks like a knockoff lexus badge . 
   however , yes , fitz can be incredibly obtuse at times throughout the whole series , i definitely wo n't disagree with you there . 
  yea , i just finish the golden fool , i honestly do n't care about buying the next one . 
  fitz annoys me too much , i do n't feel like he has grown as a character since the last trilogy . 
  he makes so many stupid decisions in this trilogy as you said he is incredibly obtuse . 
  i mean he also was in the farseer trilogy but i excuse it because he was a kid in that . 
  i 'm going to have to find another book in the meantime , maybe i after awhile i get the desire to continue . 
  then again i said the same thing about god emperor of dune and it 's been years since i stop reading that . 
  as far as i know mobile does n't have a sidebar , i 'm currently using the official mobile app i do n't thing i have ever seen a sidebar while using it ` l. 
  i do n't like the shape of it , it looks off for some reason . 
  but everything else looks amazing .

  that 's disappointing , would you mind recommending anything else ? 
  i really do n't have a preference on what to read which is kinda making it hard to narrow down another book . 
  you know i just notice i have never put all i read in a list or anything . 
  let me try to make a list of at least some of the fantasy and scify titles . 
  that i can remember anyways , i still have all the digital ones but some of the physical ones i have sold/gave away . 
  title | author | comment, 
  asoiaf | george r. r. martin | still my favorite fantasy series . 
  kafka on the shore | haruki murakami | one of my favorite books of all time , it has fantasy elements to it .
