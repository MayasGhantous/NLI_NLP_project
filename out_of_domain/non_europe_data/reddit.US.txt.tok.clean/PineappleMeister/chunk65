  but idk if it 's a fantasy book . 
  the stormlight archive | brandon sanderson | i really liked it , the best of all of sandersons work . 
  but his works imo always has a `` safe '' feel to it . 
  wax and wayne series | brandon sanderson | it was good , better than mistborn , which was just ok imo . 
  kingkiller chronicles | patrick rothfuss | liked the first book , the second was not as good it was only ok imo . 
  dune , dune messiah , children of dune | frank herbert | loved them but they kept getting weirder and weirder that i never got around to read god emperor . 
  the farseer trilogy | robin hobb | loved it, 
  liveship traders trilogy | robin hobb | kinda weird i started not really liking it but as it went on i started to really like it , but the last half of the third book ruin it for me . 
  tawny man trilogy | robin hobb | series i was just reading i read the first 2 books but could n't continue fitz ( main character ) annoyed me too much . 
  the dark tower | stephen king | i read only the first 3 books , i really like them . 
  i do n't remember why i never continue , might go back to it after the movie comes out . 
  the forever war | joe haldeman | very good . 
  old man 's war | john scalzi | very good . 
  there are more but i going to go bed now . 
  tables, 
  you can create a table by organizing pipes ( | ) , hyphens ( - ) and text within a particular syntax . 
  for example , inputting this :, 
   column a | column b | column c, 
   a1 | b1 | c1, 
   a2 | b2 | c2, 
  thanks i will look into it , i do n't mind rape scene if they are not graphic like the one in the other book i mention above . 
  welp , not a nice way to start the year . 
  if i had put the name of the series in the second spoiler warning anyone who read the first spoiler would pretty much be spoiled about the second . 
  idk what to tell you , reading the first spoiler in context there is only one thing that can be assume the second is about and having the title visible there would be the same as reading the spoiler itself . 
  and i added it because if someone knows what the second spoiler is about they will most likely know what i 'm talking about when i say i do n't want to read anything like that . 
  ultimately the only reason you or anyone should should have read the second spoiler is if they do n't mind spoilers , i do n't really know what else anyone could have expected from something title `` major spoiler for another book series . '', 
  he owns the right iirc from a different post . 
  not really a ripoff when he is allow to use it however he wants . 
  i still ca n't believe they let encarnaci\u00f3n leave, 
  had to come back to the thread just to upvote you . 
  ^ you ^ should n't ^ have ^ edited ^ the ^ comment . 
  you should market as a spoiler . 
  not sure if this is a good thing or a bad thing . 
  but at least it 's interesting .

  so is rothschild consider a good pitching coach ? 
  the fuck happen to the steamable video controllers this shit is useless now . 
  i going to approved this even though it 's not technically related to pc gaming , as this could be the biggest threat to pc gaming as a whole . 
  i wander how sev is feeling right now . 
  lol did n't go for two pitches down the middle but does at one on the moon . 
  you do n't think something that could have negative effect on the world biggest pc gaming market will be not also be bad for the rest of the world ? 
  1 . you are completely right , however i made en exception for this one . 
  nothing to do with american exceptionalism just simple economics . 
  we are the biggest market for pc gaming and rely heavily the internet ( even physical games are just steam keys here , not all but many ) . 
  add data caps , fast lanes and a cable tv like pricing models for websites and you will see the pc in the us shrink very fast . 
  and although pc gaming world wide will survive without a healthy us market it will not be the same as companies would be more reluctant to support pc specially at a aaa budget . 
  my last 2 answers work for this , no other countries gaming market has as much influence on the market as whole as we do and their net neutrality rules are not under attack . 
  no , many people here do not follow news or politics subreddits ( there are comments on this very threads saying as much ) they will not be aware unless someone make them so . 
  i like how they still boo ells like we would n't cheer if they took that contract from us .

  i wonder if castro got a ring last year from the cubs , i mean was n't he there more than half of the season seem like he should get one but like a a little smaller than a regular one like with half of the diamonds missing .
