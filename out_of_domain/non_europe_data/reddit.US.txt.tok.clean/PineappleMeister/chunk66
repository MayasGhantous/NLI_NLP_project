  what the fuck , i want to watch the at bat keep that shit audio only, 
  i hate him but only until i have to listen to a different announcer than i remember i like him . 
  that looks painful, 
  well there goes the perfect game , hicks looked like a fool . 
  yea looks pretty clear in the replay that he had no idea where the ball was , dude was slowing down until he saw it . 
  oh god , why do we need video for this ? 
   dude has been a bit wild ,, 
  1er , 1bb , 8so, 
  honest question i went to take a shower and miss half his innings . 
  `` up in the zone '', 
  i honestly been wanting to see him hit since he was first call up . 
  pedro martinez had a [ perfect game he lost in the 10 ] ( http://www.baseball-almanac.com/boxscore/06031995.shtml ), 
  romine pls get a hit , i want to see gary, 
  ### i trust the binder !!!, 
  wehlp, 
  ### nasty, 
  ... it look to me like a strike . 
  damn , i feel bad for severino . 
  yea but he is old now . 
  ouch there is no padding in that concrete . 
  love you west lol lol, 
  i 'm going to regret staying up tomorrow morning or i guess later today . 
  wow almost 10k , oh god i need to be up in 4 hours, 
  wo n't make it to 10k, 
  unless we start shit posting, 
  comments in sections, 
  doing my part for 10k, 
  well at least judge only play 9 innings, 
  so hi is good for tomorrow, 
  10k i 'm proud of proud of you guys http://m.imgur.com/5b9jzkx?r, 
  i lovw how the game thread had over 10k comments but not even 150 upvotes . 
  anyways i 'm going to hate myself in a couple of hours . 
  this defence !, 
  ca n't the ump eject someone that they feel is a safety hazard ? 
  why did they sent gary , dude is catcher :|, 
  wow pilar, 
  i got to say this was beautiful . 
  you think he is going to close today ? 
  not pretty but it was a good game for tanaka . 
  cause escalators are dangerous more than most people realize . 
  so if it 's faulty best it 's cordoned off than have it turn into a meat grinder . 
  god damn it trump made me miss gary homer . 
  has carter done anything significant since that pinch hit homer ? 
  you are watching espn ? 
  that must suck, 
  who is in the back seat ? 
  wait who sent the message ? 
  does n't look like him ... but then again almost none of them do . 
  yes should have an option where you can listen to their announcers even if it is an espn game . 
  ok the fuck is happening today ? 
  not only sev had horrible start but now tanaka ? 
  im listing to music fuck that noise . 
  just random songs on my apple music library was just listening to kanye welcome to heartbreak and just change to leonard cohen hallelujah ... 
  agree , this could be the biggest story in years the fact that there is no post in the main news subreddit is astonishing . 
  keep it civil .

  ok ca n't watch right now but why was sev taken out with only 5 innings ? 
  pitch count or something else ? 
  what a bitch . 
  same here , honestly did n't think before `` upgrading '' it . 
  eh none i fucked up and upgraded to the new profile shit and was testing it out , does this show up in / r/new ? 
  ahh i should have really paid attention before `` upgrading '' i regret this ... 
  oh god judge almost has a golden sombrero . 
  judge had a golden sombrero yesterday , looks like gary might get one today . 
  did anyone get a notification from at bat app saying the game was tied ? 
  as soon as you guys started talking about how pitchers pitch better with romine than gary , they shit the bed . 
  you got to give the gary v romine break down cause that 's what we do now !, 
  can anyone give me the bullpen stats of gary and romine ? 
  top mod of the other one is crazy . 
  that one is also easier to find probably why it has more subs . 
  the whole put your best reliever in the 9th should be a thing of the past . 
  bring betances when we most need him i think . 
  and we should stop using saves as a basing to pay pitchers . 
  was n't buying the whole tanaka/sanchez shit , but looking at that line ... 
  tanaka on the hook for the lost ? 
  how did n't his runner get thrown out at home ? 
  why was carter or romine even allow to bat . 
  for who ? 
  in the 9th we will have the top of our lineup . 
  welp bullpen is garbage with romine  :(,

  did n't the redsox use it to win their world series ? 
  it looked like castro was going to get it after the bounce anyways but damn it if it did n't look sweet . 
  what ? 
  where you hear that ? 
  did he get let go from fox ? 
  oh shit they are going to johan him, 
  he was n't moving his mouth probably was n't calling . 
  unless he is also a ventriloquist, 
  judge is a rookie . 
  betances is probably the most overuse pitcher in the last 2 seasons so i hope they do n't do that again or he wo n't make it the whole year .
