  bundy killed 30 people . 
  got hold in contempt for walking out . 
  only 1 er too . 
  that must suck . 
  the fuck is happening with the infield ? 
  i know it 's not refsnyder fault that they were save but he did n't catch any of those , i thought he was a good defender . 
  i admit i have not . 
  if you freeze frame the last shot it looked out . 
  but idk if that was enough . 
  google photos is compressed . 
  if you want to upload the original file then it 's no longer unlimited .

  i wonder if someone went postal or if it was something else . 
  that looks horrible it looks cluttered as shit . 
  i just wish they would allow me to place the buttons wherever i want . 
  edit apparently you can edit the placement ? 
  is this a leak or was this actually announced ? 
  ca n't find anything going to tag it as rumor for now . 
  can you imagine if he comes back and somehow lead the sox to another world series championship . 
  i wonder how long it would take for him to be elected mayor of boston or someshit . 
  can we send tanaka to pedro ? 
  seems like he worked wonders with severino, 
  you know i 'm somewhat disappointed that i do n't see / u/constant _ gardner11 with some depressing stat about tanaka after this start . 
  does the blue timer bar stay there even when your are in an app ?

  what was that at the end ? 
  cano got a double doing that , god i miss cano . 
  does n't he only sit if it 's a day game ? 
  tomorrow is a night game i think . 
  it only updates once a month ... 
  ck does but creditors still take 30 days report changes to the credit bureaus . 
  so it unlikely that you will get more than 1 change a month , not saying it ca n't happen but i doubt it 's common . 
  i just remember he is not playing ... where the fuck are we putting him when he comes back . 
  the 20 million backup ... 
  this is boring ... at least konami 's bad conferences made me laugh . 
  you know this is all i wanted from uncharted for that longest time . 
  i spent countless hours in their co-op modes but i always wanted to play the whole game in co-op . 
  if this game get out of hands early we can take sav out and have him start for that tanaka outing we are skipping . 
  i wonder if something like that has ever happen . 
  does mlb post videos when it 's a fox game ? 
  sounded nothing like him , . . 
  what ?? 
  2 run single and rbi double lol, 
  so is ells the only bad contract we will still have next year ? 
  lol in how many at bats is that ? 
  double ? 
  i would have guess error since both of them could have gotten it, 
  walk to ~ ~ castro ~ ~ , grand salami by gary . 
  bet place !, 
  last inning for gary ? 
  did he forget the gary 2 rbis ? 
  bitch should have counted it !!!!!, 
  looks like gardner is out .
