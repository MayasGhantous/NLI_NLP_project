  `` 42 games featured today . 
  including 22 exclusive to xbone '', 
  i wonder if they are not doing the xbox everyone thing they had and have a version of the games on pc . 
  cars games have always been easier at getting 60fps than other type of games . 
  the original xbox one forza was 1080p 60fps . 
  even though lots of games could n't do that . 
  you know i miss like the first half hour and i thought they were saying xbox one s not x. ... .

  wow that `` exclusive '' sound is so misleading when you read the text on the screen . 
  love the style of the dragon ball game , reminds me of guilty gear, 
  nice, 
  that `` exclusive '' sound is the most misleading thing i have ever seen on any e3 , when you read the text on the screen . 
  ### yells exclusive, 
  ^ ^ not ^ ^ really ^ ^ no , ^ ^ is ^ ^ time ^ ^ exclusive ^ ^ on ^ ^ consoles ^ ^ but ^ ^ probably ^ ^ out ^ ^ on ^ ^ pc ^ ^ at ^ ^ the ^ ^ same ^ ^ time . 
  one or two said xbox console exclusive , i think those are only coming to the console . 
  well what works for me , i will play them on pc . 
  they need a big conference closer . 
  that 's pretty nice /, 
  $ 499 damn and it does n't even have giant enemy crab . 
  ah ok i went by the liveblog text . 
  no , in like 12 minutes . 
  fixed, 
  ~ ~ either ~ ~ my youtube stream is shit ~ ~ or their conference is skipping randomly . ~ ~, 
  yea my tv youtube app just crash . 
  thought it was until i remember that 's not bethesda game . 
  e3 has been very underwhelming so far ... well as a pc gamer i liked ms conference because i can play all their games without owning their console . 
  i forgot this was even on today . 
  horrible time too , i wonder who their audience is by having it on a monday during work hours . 
  europe has a good hour though . 
  . . the screen is 1080p what would be the point of that ? 
  having more power is would be welcome as i have the og ps4 but there is the pro to consider . 
  i fucking hope not , shit is too soon for that . 
  i want a bigger leap in power than what i console made today would have . 
  anyone going the ps experience at the amc lincoln square 13 , in nyc ? 
  if you pm how many people it looks like there are there . 
  oh yea i forgot about that , this is the reason i keep my psvr unplug when not using it , yea i agree it 's annoying .
