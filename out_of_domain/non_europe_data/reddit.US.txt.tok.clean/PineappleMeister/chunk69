  play link ? 
  that interesting . 
  party games are always welcome . 
  not to play videos games but to drink and play party games they do . 
  lol that was a brief shot of the porsche 911 gt2 rs that was announced yesterday on the ms presser . 
  i was talking about the one at the [ beginning that was in night ] ( http://i.imgur.com/pbxnhhw.png ) but yea could still be the gt3, 
  some fuck up the audio mixing . 
  audio is good on the youtube app, 
  scalebound , 
  it 's full of journalist psx is full of fanboys . 
  psvr is looking good !, 
  the presentation is beautiful, 
  i ca n't believe so many people are complaining that they did n't have any dev talk about the games on stage , like why ? 
  that 's always better for a post show or something where they actually have time to talk about what they want to talk about . 
  all e3 pressers should be presented like this trailer after trailer . 
  that said i was kinda expecting a sucker punch game at least . 
  every time gary sits it makes me sad that he is a catcher, 
  ca n't believe they actually pitched to him with first open, 
  sure why not i leave it up for a day or till automods schedule threads get posted . 
  they need cy young out there every game . 
  remember a couple of games ago when you guys were mad a castro for not going when espada was windmilling ? 
  yea that 's why , cause he is horrible, 
  i do n't think he touched home ... ... ... 
  does n't matter anyone anyways lol . 
  they all hit his ball hard , he got lucky with pujols that castro was there but this was ~ ~ a ~ ~ bound to happen . 
  yea they keep hitting him hard . 
  and welp it 's 1 am i 'm out . 
  omg i do n't think i have ever heard worse announcing than what cnn is doing right now .

  holy shit that 's kamui kobayashi i used to love watching him on f1 . 
  imo he was most exciting driver there , even though it meant he crashed a lot ... 
  he is pitching around sanchez , didi needs to do something here or it will keep happening . 
  i doubt joe did that gary just saw a chance and took it, 
  i been saying this would be my last inning for like the last 2 hours and i have to be up at 6 ... ... ... ... 
  so does a six day rest actually make pitchers pitch worse than regular rest ? 
  i keep seeing it mention a lot but do the number confirmed that ?
