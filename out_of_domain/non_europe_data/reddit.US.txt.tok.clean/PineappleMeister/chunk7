  yep . 
  post the code you are using , i do n't know if you are making a mistake or not, 
  great . 
  ahh sorry fix, 
  . side . titlebox . redditname a {, 
  background : url here ;, 
  background-repeat : no-repeat ;, 
  display : block ;, 
  position : absolute ;, 
   the western half of square does fairly well . 
  ** it is ** their japanese half which bleeds money . 
  i guess it was a disappointment because it had to compensate for that . 
  still silly either way . 
  your comment, 
  your source, 
   the biggest money drainers involved restructuring which saw 3 billion yen lost overall with the closure of a us division contributing 1 billion yen of that loss . 
  another 3.5 billion yen was lost from `` loss on disposal of content '' which was explained as a mixture of all the work they 've scrapped and the restructuring their current business model . 
  the second paragraph disproves your comment but here lets break it down more, 
   a 2 billion yen loss in this regard will come from japan, 
   a 1.5 billion yen loss will come from europe and north america, 
  but you said that `` the western half of square does fairly well . '', 
  ... lost half a billion less than japan , i would n't consider that `` doing fairly well '' . 
  edit : formatting, 
  that happen because you remove this from the pagename a code . 
  position : absolute ;, 
  #header - img-a ,, 
  display : inline ;, 
  position : absolute ;, 
  float : left ; }, 
  position : relative ;, 
  top :100 % ;, 
  why do n't you keep thing contain into one place redditname a being one and so on that was causing your problems . 
  mod me if you want i will fix it than demod myself . 
  to do very well would be to make money , they are not his comment makes sound like they ( western side ) are making money but the japanese side is the only one that 's not . 
  when in fact both of them are loosing money . 
   so yes reading their own numbers the western side does very well comparatively, 
  to be able to make this statement you would need to know what percentage of their business is from japan compare to us/eu as i do n't know , i cant know ** if ** it is actually doing very well comparatively . 
  sorry it took so long i was getting a bunch of errors/reddit is overloaded messages , check it out tell if you want me to change anything i did or something else i would going to change the submit button to match the rest of the reddit but i did n't know if you want that so i did n't do it . 
  remove me from the mod list if everything is ok . 
   would it be possible to move the tabs over just a little bit more so that the header-image , pagename and tabs are all in a line ? 
  you mean move it to the left ? 
   i 'm not sure what you mean about the submit button . 
  do you mean re-positioning it ? 
  no i mean changing the color and stuff , for example some of my reddits / r/awesome / r/youtube although they do n't have to be side by side . 
  check it now . 
  i made a mistake with the sidebar image i do n't have time to fix just right now but i will do it a little ( about 2 hours ) later . 
  if that 's ok ? 
  i demod myself after that is done . 
  turn it off on your res settings ? 
  offtopic whats with this sub and using the weirdest image hosting places . 
  background-repeat : repeat ;, 
  / * text color * /, 
  . morelink a { color : # 000 ; }, 
  here ? 
  this guy is hilarious !, 
  haha , reminds me of that [ agent 47 comic \\ ( maybe \\ ) nsfw ] ( http://i.imgur.com/voqw1be.jpg ), 
  add this after . morelink so it should look like this in all, 
  same with the other one , or if you want the button to change when you hover you just use the stand alone , and it will change to what 's in this code . 
  background-repeat : repeat ;, 
  kuroda is pissed . 
  tight lower back i think they said . 
  pretty sure iamducky would help you but are you talking about the subscribe buttons ? 
  if so , it is where it says, 
  on the stylesheet . 
  / * = = = subscribe/side buttons = = = * /, 
  not with css , you can either use a bot or have the user applied their own flairs . 
  . sidebox.submit {, 
  position : absolute ;, 
  . sidebox.submit.submit-link { right : auto ; }, 
  . side . submit-text { right : 10px ; }, 
  . submit . morelink {, 
  background : #f 63454 ;, 
  display : block ;, 
  color : #fff ;, 
  font-weight : normal ;, 
  text-transform : capitalize ;, 
  . submit . morelink : hover { background : # 7bb850 ; }, 
  / * kills the community button/nub/spacer * /, 
  . sidebox.create . morelink { display : none ; }, 
  . sidebox.submit . spacer a , . sidebox.create . spacer a { display : none ; }, 
  . morelink . nub , . morelink . nub : hover { display : none }, 
  if you are going to use the submit button , this is a better ( update ) version of them ( just change the colors ) , works better with the new custom labels . 
  i originally made the one iamducky is using for / r/awesome but when reddit added the custom labels it broke ( it look like the text does in / r/reds now ) so i change it to the one above . 
  also now it has less useless code . 
  shit woke up just now . 
  at least i can watch the final 4 laps . 
  woot we got 5 !, 
  i think i going to have to make a new rule about this too many time this has been posted . 
  anyone have a video ? 
  i thought that the red viper was n't going to be on the show ? 
  shit call !, 
  do n't we have someone other ben francisco ? 
  this is from today ? 
  that 's because of res here use this, 
  . res . res-keynav-activeelement ,, 
  . res . commentarea . res-keynav-activeelement . md ,, 
  . res . commentarea . res-keynav-activeelement . entry . noncollapsed {, 
  background-color : transparent ! important ;,
