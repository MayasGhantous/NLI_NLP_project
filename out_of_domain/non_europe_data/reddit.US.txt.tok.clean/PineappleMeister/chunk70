  ficking hell i missed betances inning and come back to this shit, 
  your fault . 
  99mph second pitch homer :(, 
  the fuck was that ? 
  that should have been caught and the last ball should have not been a double , the fuck is happening today . 
  if we hit weak shit like that you bet they would be outs . 
  see what fuck is up with the fielding today ? 
  fielding has been so horrendous today angels have been hitting shitty grounders all night but somehow we ca n't make the play . 
  should have walk him since pujols ca n't fucking walk, 
  hehehehe, 
  i notice that too on yesterday thread . 
  welp , but i ca n't really expect betances to be perfect every time he goes out there . 
  lol you think judge is worth 30 wins or something ? 
  i know this sub is hype as fuck for him , but he is not the only good player we have didi , castro , sanchez , holliday , hicks . 
  have been very good so far this season . 
  i want to see german as a starter we have an opening with cc on the dl , hopefully that happens . 
  3 errors what about the didi one ? 
  they left that as a hit ? 
  lol the dad just said let 's go ... 
  there are more people in this thread thinking this is the end of the world than people who think it 's fine . 
  and sanchez should be made to block balls . 
  betances to learn a pick off move . 
  2 bad plays from didi 's , 2 from sanchez , and judge let a very weak hit ball go by him that turn into a double but i think that 's more because of where he was playing . 
  and lot 's of weak shit somehow making it to the outfield .

  damn i 'll take it but that was a strike, 
  gary 's average keeps quietly rising . 
  wish he would worked more on defense i know this is his first full year so i do n't expect him to be a golden glove catcher but we almost lost there because of the pass ball . 
  keep it civil . 
  just tuned in , i was hoping gary would dh today . 
  the whole homer in a rookie season screws player that came up late in the year , but that still counts as their rookie season . 
  gary only played 53 games last season but that was his rookie season i doubt he is the only one . 
  i know all i 'm trying to say that gary only played 53 games last year . 
  but he no longer qualifies for the list . 
  i know i just think it 's a shitty record because of it . 
  it 's not like he was good before now we are just hoping he would do better . 
  i was hoping gardner and gary would at least get 1 at bat . 
  i doubt it but i would 100 % upgrade if it does , i convinced myself that i could get use to not having it but nope it 's such an inconvenience that when i upgrade it 's going to need to have a headphone jack . 
  are all the bases tag with the date for every game ? 
  or is it just cause this is old timers day ? 
  tyler making a bad play worse , that should have been caught we seriously need a good first baseman, 
  he should have caught the ball . 
  i need a gary to hit a grand salami today . 
  is yes lagging for any else ? 
  that was nice tag though so i ca n't blame espada too much but then i remember a hall of fame players is on third ... 
  most of our base running is fine it 's when we get to third that it becomes a problem . 
  that might actually work *, 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^ know ^ ^ ^ ^ shit . 
  cause he is the ceo of all of sony , if you want to hear him talk you can listen to the earnings call . 
  quick question to anyone who has the nes one are the controllers full size or are they smaller than the original ones . 
  thank , now lets just hope they make enough to meet demand . 
  not 1 fastball yet . 
  so an error counts as an ab right ? . 
  so why does sanchez have an ab ? 
  where were you going headley ?!!, 
  shows how much attention i paid to our minor league teams because i thought he was already there . 
  has gary caught monty this season ? 
  a lot ? 
  severino is still the better pitcher imo . 
  ^ ^ and ^ ^ ^ tanaka ^ ^ ^ is ^ ^ ^ ^ still ^ ^ ^ ^ our ^ ^ ^ ^ ace . 
  when is trout expected to come back ? 
  something about walks in a rookie season , another shit stat muddle by the fact that a lot of rookies come up with half of the year done and but have the minimum at bats to have their rookie season be a short season . 
  lol i wanted to reply to another comment asking about what kay said , idk how i reply to myself lol, 
  who got fat ? 
  oh god austin that ball was in china ... 
  ~ ~ oh god we really need a first baseman . ~ ~, 
  disregard me lol, 
  most hits today have been weak shit though . 
  they going to walk him, 
  speeeddddddd, 
  is gary talking to espada ? 
  he was just move to the 4th spot before that he was 2 , 6 and 5 i think . 
  i like how they cut from clippard to binder every few minutes lol, 
  oh fuck and is melky, 
  joe the walking tumor should quit,

  mild derailment in ~ ~ harlem ~ ~ clippard but somehow made it out . 
  yes has been horrible for me for the last 2 weeks is or so . 
  cause he is not a good defender or at least not as good as chase . 
  oh it 's just with some of the users here it 's hard to tell lol, 
  damn melky is only 32 ... 
  what ? 
  he is a rookie is making league minimum . 
  yall watch castro pull a hammy running hard to first and want our catcher to run full speed on a ball that looked like a line out . 
  met 's pitcher baby ? 
  have n't there been a bunch of stories about their horrible injury management and playing player while ignore ? 
  defence what you doing defence !!!!, 
  watch melky put on in the seats now :(,
