  he was n't wrong , it was n't until they drop the price significantly that it started to gain traction . 
  to be fair they all have had more than half a season to prove themselves . 
  i love judge but he is still just a rookie . 
  about to start !!!, 
  lol it 's almost 11 ... 
  i really should go to bed i have slept a combined 15 hours this week . 
  fuck hustle , be lazy . 
  fuck all you , fuck me . 
  this is fucking sad . 
  how much difference a day makes , last night we had an amazing debut and today we have tragic one :(, 
  i hate you bot . 
  edit welp :( i did n't mean for it to be deleted bring kitty back . 
  i going to set up a new charity for baseball call the be lazy for baseball and play all 162 games fund . 
  refs needs to be dfa . 
  i 'm sorry but the kid has gotten so many chances i hope he finds success but i do n't want it to be here . 
  surgery ? 
  tonight ? 
  this is serious as him life threatening ? 
  damn that was nice throw . 
  honestly i want german to start at least 1 game over cessa . 
  has cessa made it out of the 5th this year yet ? 
  that 's a name i have n't heard in a long time . 
  alexander go home you ruining the groove, 
  unreasonable as it is i hate that gary has to sit like every other game ( i know ) . 
  how did pi\u00f1eda looked ? 
  i could n't watch the game but that line is interesting 6 inning with only 2 er ? 
  but also only 3 so ? 
  nice to know it was a good start . 
  and yea just saw that highlight , still do n't know why he tag the bag but it looked funny lol . 
  are there rules against triple digit numbers ?

  yea i expected that , did n't joe watch his last half inning all his hit balls were at the wall or over . . 
  come on judge do history, 
  i been blaming him since last year . 
  we need a new pitching coach and betances needs to be put in low leverage situations till he gets sorted or trade ( i hope they do n't though ) . 
  also please dfa carter again a rare good throw to first from betances and he makes an error ... 
  i 'm talking putting him in the 6 or 7 inning when/if we have a lead like that , instead of the 8 . or in the 8 or 9 if the lead is bigger . 
   only good part was when leaving the stadium the yankees sucks chant was followed by `` zero world series '' from the yankee fans . 
  you should look up the height of olympic runners , bolt is like 6,6, 
  and he is also like 100 times faster than judge , point is height gives you a huge advantage when running . 
  are you trying to bad mouth judge ? 
  ( jk ) but our players do that too , i do n't see what 's the big deal . 
  wtf is with yes lately the fucking lag in the channel unwatchable at times, 
  had to change the channel when betances came in ( did n't want a heart attack lol ) how did he looked ? 
  judge and gary have the same line lol, 
  i do n't get why that padding is n't thicker , i mean i sure the yanks have enough money to strap a bunch of memory foam mattress back there . 
  lol , someone should make a version of the xfl for the mlb where the walls are full of spikes , and the balls are on fire . 
  i feel even though betances has struggle lately he has been better than chapman this season .

  lol idk if it 's just me but it sound like he has a dominican accent, 
  doubt that 's unpopular . 
  you would keep ells ? 
  i doubt anyone would take that contact but he would be the first one i would trade away . 
  i want to get a new pitching coach before trading pitchers . 
  i know , i just saying his spanish accent sounds like a dominican accent . 
  eh we would be doing the same thing . 
  is that betances in the pen ? 
  [ tanaka is nightman ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v784aiytg8 ) . 
  key is reading this sub, 
  i want gary to win but i do n't want judge to lose . 
  the #dilemma, 
  so no one is going to call him on hitting before the ball lands ? 
  oh shit , prime day starts in a few minutes ... let 's see if they do n't have too much garbage . 
  omg !, 
  injured he is not playing . 
  rothschild , is horrible he is ai n't doing shit !, 
  ^ ^ ^ watch ^ ^ ^ someone ^ ^ ^ pull ^ ^ ^ some ^ ^ ^ stats ^ ^ ^ saying ^ ^ ^ he ^ ^ ^ is ^ ^ ^ one ^ ^ ^ of ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ best ^ ^ ^ in ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ league . 
  [ i have n't karma whore enough to make up for the time i spend doing this so , here it is again stanton losing to the kraken . 
  machado could have gotten that . 
  my boy !, 
  still my fav yankee ;(, 
  with the way he is pitching lately , doubt it would be 1-2-3, 
  nothing he is paid league minimum . 
  that still is happy face , happy face , what you want is  :, 
  been karma whoring with it since the derby, 
  randy levine idea of a closer . 
  i feel like he has been better , and even with how bad he has been lately and he is not ~ 20 million . 
  looks like johnnie walker was making a flute . 
  he should be out : /, 
  although i do n't mind the pace of play when watching on tv it really does n't inspire me to go see the games live . 
  to be fair the new yankee stadium does that by itself . 
  nice at bat but i wanted, 
  a little more for this, 
  offtopic : but what 's the limit on concurrent streams with nbo now , is it the same as go ?
