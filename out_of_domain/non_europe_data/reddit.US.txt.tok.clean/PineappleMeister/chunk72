  so if we get todd frazier is he playing first or third . 
  watch him give up andujar and mateo . 
  3 very hard hit balls in a row , welp . 
   that 2nd baseman, 
  ... get out !, 
  who are we going to put there ? 
  is n't hicks still in the dl, 
  he got lucky in some of those though but i think we should still put in today . 
  you know that would be cool but joe would never do that, 
  nolan batmans , iron man 1 , i do n't remember but i do n't think civil war had a big cgi explosion in the end . 
  but those are the only ones i can think off . 
  castro on the 10-day dl , we should n't have activate him it was clear that he was n't ready . 
  that place is too fucking big . 
  he slow . 
  22million pinch runner . 
  it just says praise the binder, 
  good , for what though ? 
  oh well it is what it is . 
  yuge pickoff . 
  how did sevy get those 2 runs, 
  how did severino que those 2 runs ? 
  any videos of what happen to judge at the end ? 
  people are saying judge lost a tooth ? 
  wow that 's super misleading , the title is fake news !, 
  hopefully the rain delay last long enough for the sun to go down . 
  wait that was an immaculate inning right ? 
  if google does this they will make one of their biggest mistake ever imo because although i plan to keep my iphone 7 for at lest another year as it is the best phone i have own . 
  i need a headphone jack on my next phone and the pixels was one the the few android phones that i would have considered . 
  why repeat what i wrote ? 
  read where i said it was my opinion , and it 's my personal opinion that this will be one of their biggest mistake . 
  but he might have hit the ones before , he was batting ~ 300 over his last few games . 
  gardner is the only player i have hope of doing something this game  and i as typed that he has a hit , 
  plz judge , i even bought your jersey over sanchez !, 
  it was a borderline but a robot ump would have call it . 
  home run threads always look exactly the same . 
  literally , it 's the same damn copypastas . 
  you could at least try making some original comments . 
  as someone who convinced my self it was no big deal . 
  i can safely say i was so fucking wrong . 
  my next phone needs to have a headphone jack . 
  maybe it 's just me but i feel that kay has is out for gary . 
  anyone up ?
