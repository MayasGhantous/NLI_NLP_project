  have we use betances yet ? 
  no way betances is ready . 
  what does the japanese text judge has in his arm say ? 
  holy fuck that looked horrible , looks like he over standed his stride to make it to the bag but slipped . 
  i know i 'm in the minority but i do n't like it when players run too hard to first on a ground outs , i mean they should run to first in case they make it but sliding and running super hard like this when you have like ~ 99 % chance of being out should be not be done . 
  sanderson style would do this series a disservice . 
  a hit ? 
  wtf, 
  so we need to sent our pitchers to pedro and our hitters to a-rod , got it !, 
  good inning , 3 straight games means we ca n't use him tomorrow :(, 
  chapman is struggling more than betances ever was .

  same here , even came into comments to see if some would point out where he was ... . . 
  to meme or not to meme on / r/baseball , that is the question . 
  that 's over 2 seasons . 
  sites/app are down at least for me since i sign up . 
  i wonder if joe is going to shit on judge like he did on to gary when he was struggling . 
  \u266b we negotiate the terms of surrender, 
  i see george washington smile \u266b, 
  ... * scratch record *, 
  ... wrong reference . 
  ### 80 million ----- fuckkk randy levine, 
  no we have n't he has n't been consistent all year . 
  how the fuck is romeine batting ? 
  we have no one in the bench ? 
  well nothing suspicious about it , the ff car was inspired by the [ maybach exelero ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/maybach_exelero ) if you look at the original ff vesus trailer is practically the same car , they did make some changes by the time ff15 came out . 
  this looks more like the [ mercedes-benz amg vision gran turismo ] ( http://www.gran-turismo.com/us/vgt/mercedes-benz/ ) concept that mercedes for the gran turismo games . 
  come on judge . 
  do your thing, 
  any video of gary and joe in the dugout ?

  oh lol , will fixed in a sec . 
  added your first suggestion , but link fonts that we are using are the default reddit fonts ( unless i mess something up lol ) and i do n't really change them . 
  it 's like 95 % res nightmode compatible ( a couple of things need fixing ) i think that 's better than making a dark theme since i 'm not sure how many people would use it . 
  should be fixed now . 
  oh i actually change them to the default reddit color cause i thought maybe you would like it better . 
  i will change them back . 
  lol ca n't believe they have a rule that just says the yankees suck how childish .

  at bat lying to cheer me up . 
  your post has been removed . 
  all suggestions for games , features , etc. 
  must be accompanied by a way to get your idea into the hands of those who can make it happen . 
  a http://share.blog.us.playstation.com link either as the post or in the body of the self-post . 
  an official twitter account or email address of the dev/publisher/company for folks to contact ( ideally with a catchy hashtag ) . 
  petitions are not allowed . 
  yea since it 's kinda useless , it was also hidden in the old stylesheet i think, 
  / r/playstation, 
  would still be missing the psx, 
  anyone sign up for the moviepass thing ? 
  are you able to use e-tickets ? 
  shit is useless for me . 
  nah but just got an email they said it 's coming , but it also said that if you have eticket theaters close , you can use those till the card gets here . 
  i was wondering if we had any e-tickets theaters here . 
  i just started watching so he is probably loosing it . 
  lol as soon as i put the game on he losses the perfect game . 
  well fuck ... 
  is the game on yes today ? 
  hopefully tony pe\u00f1a, 
  this looks like a entertaining game and i ca n't watch it :(, 
  sooo who can we expect to be suspended ? 
  only on reddit , everyone i know loves this season . 
   looks like they copied mercedes style, 
  that 's where it 's from , i was wondering why it look so familiar . 
  if / r/baseball was in charge he would have , and it would have been preceded by a shame walk . 
  shame !, 
  i hope judge has a good game cause that 's one shitty nickname . 
  didi or castro walk off ? 
  gary would have made the play at home . 
  when is gary expected to serve his suspension ? 
  oh fuck if this is going to be the strike zone i ai n't fucking watching . 
  what happen to the game thread . 
  talking about the self post updates , lineups and shit, 
  should have have a sap like function where instead of spanish i hear their broadcast . 
  oneil please shut up when he has 2 outs , both times he has been talking about how sevy has been cruising and should be out the inning fast . 
  of course it is , you never heard the curse of the paulie ? 
  they even made a movie where paulie talks too much . 
  how does that have anything to do with this statement ? 
  the part where he is in the autonomous car looks like a very distant future even the actor they use in that part is like 30 years older . 
  / r/baseball will be / r/baseball . 
  anyone know if they ship to the us ? 
  cause that 's much better than our shitty gears site . 
  no way to tell until it 's release but here are a few videos of journalist/bloggers using it at ifa, 
  too bad it was n't price !, 
  so are the astros the team to beat now ?
