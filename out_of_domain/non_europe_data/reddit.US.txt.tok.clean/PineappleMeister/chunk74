  am i the one that 's never impress with single season rookie records ? 
  do n't most rookies come up after the all star game for their rookie season ? 
  these records are more impressive when they are in the x amount of games, 
  anyone else hearing an iphone on tv, 
  if they play well they do as they would probably be starting everyday and only need 130 at bats for that to be their rookie season . 
  according to their site you will be able to order a 3d printed model of the object you scanned , if you want to further step up your game . 
  it 's been 3 fucking inning why you all acting like it 's the end of the game ? 
  cc should n't have said that , if i were in another team i will definitely try to bunt . 
  it would be a great way to get in his head and throw him off his game . 
  world series game downs by 1 getting , with a no-hitter . 
  they better use every fucking thing they got to win or that manager should be fire and resurrected steinbrenner so he can have a talk with the players . 
  have judge and sanchez gone back to back yet ? 
  13 pitches i say let him closed, 
  sanchez august should have taken off the pressure of judge if that was the problem . 
  so let 's not seat betances for too long again, 
  you were right, 
  looks like they do . 
  i been having this same problem since yesterday , can you check if it 's the same as op .

  oh i see , but it looks like you posted in the wrong thread cause those are not part of ops article . 
  ah the one i link to are wireless earbuds i guess they are not fully wireless like those but they are wireless . 
  i feel the announcers are giving devers a hard time on that play . 
  i was impress that he actually stop it . 
  why ? 
  romaine should not have been suspended and the yankees ca n't force him not to appeal, 
  garner had that if ells was n't so close, 
  was about to post the same thing, 
  damn didi that 's a shitty tag, 
  no , nintendo is cool do n't soiled that name . 
  show the replay . 
  come on judge they giving you a new pitcher . 
  that 's not a hit . 
  `` it 's not in the dirt '', 
  replay shows you lie !, 
  all catchers that can hit in the al will . 
  judge !, 
  finally !!!, 
  lol espn paid someone for that graphic i bet they were salty as fuck they have n't been able to use it . 
  they really not going to mention that `` ball '' that was in the middle of the strike zone . 
  if that pitch was call against us i would be livid . 
  sooo these windows ... are we talking double pane or xp ? 
  damn . 
  but that was a nice swing, 
  oh fuck he he is bouncing balls . 
   we were all exhausted and ** walking ** to the subway to take back to where our hotel was ... was on a ** tour **, 
  hopefully you learned not to walk like a tourist hugging the damn sidewalk while we have to get to places . 
  hope montgy goes at least 6 , than we can just go roberson , betances and chapman and if anyone them get in trouble green can come in . 
  montgy last few games have been bad :(, 
  lol at severino , he was like why you did n't do that in my game . 
  i ca n't remember who said but apparently you know if it 's intentional if the catcher comes up looking like he is setting up to block the batter from charging the pitcher . 
  lol chad green, 
  montgy :(, 
  idk about the quality since i have lost by both of the ones i had , but my first lightning earpods had that some problem you are describing .
