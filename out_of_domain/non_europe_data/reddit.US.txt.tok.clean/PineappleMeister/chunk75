  how the hell are our pitchers so bipolar that they lose the strike zone every time they seat for like a day ? 
  good thing he is chasing cause those 2 strikes have been balls . 
  what 's this bull shit , fight was great but this was n't a tie .

  oh i was wondering were sano was , that injury sounds painful, 
  i do n't think garcia will be a yankee for too long . 
  i just do n't trust him . 
  it 's was pretty fucking obvious this was going to happen after cc 's rant . 
  no , they are trying to win so they will exploit their opponent weakness if the yankees were in the other side i would hope they would do the same . 
  i do n't think statcast is a reliable as the mlb makes it out to be . 
   why ? 
  they calculate trajectory with launch angle and launch speed . 
  it 's probably very close to spot on . 
  it 's physics . 
  is that really all they do ? 
  would n't that be super inaccurate it 's not like they are hitting on a vacuum with all variables being perfect . 
  next year we need a new pitching coach . 
  34 homers smh . 
   because they still have n't sold all of the original lfas, 
   literally you can buy a brand new , 0 owner lfa if you wanted to right now . 
  and that car stopped being made in 2012 . 
  people keep saying this after some blog post that a few years ago . 
  but these these cars were bought by the dealership 's owners were not register/driven . 
  there are dealer who have `` unsold '' ford gts from 2005 as well . 
   nearly all of them were purchased by the owners of the dealerships in 2012 . 
  their mileage ranged from 20 to almost 1,500 on the clock . 
  they are n't driven much , except perhaps for special occasions and by technicians to make sure they still run . 
  otherwise , most serve as display centerpieces for the dealerships . 
   many of the lfas were n't outright for sale ( they certainly are n't listed anywhere ) -- it was up to the owner 's discretion , dealers told us . 
  maybe if they found a `` qualified buyer , '' said one dealer . 
  another told me someone offered the owner $ 850,000 for the car and was turned down .

  yea , those white plates are japanese, 
   does hyundai have that kind of cash ? 
  no , very few companies have that much cash on hand , the original story says it 's a merger , it 's most likely a stock swap . 
   does chrysler have any significant value outside of ram and jeep ? 
  do n't get me wrong , i love the hellcats , demons , and the great v8s , but those are n't enough to keep chrysler in the black . 
  well fiat-chrysler also own alfa romeo , fiat , lancia , and maserati . 
  box, 
  after 2 years without a mod i was able to get it . 
  i feel this subreddit has n't been as active as it should be , especially in the past few weeks . 
  i hope we can all make this reddit better and more active . 
  on a side note , a week ago i became the mod of [ ** r/spaceship ** ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/spaceships ) , so check it out you have anything related to spaceships you want to post . 
  edit : the design is just a test for now . 
  almost all my music is in flac , i have uploaded some of it to google music but i still have a big part that have n't , because i have n't found if there is a storage limit for it apart from the 20,000 songs & maximum 250mb per individual song . 
  has anyone hit a limit yet ?

  ### liftoff success !, 
   reddit name, 
  / r/nasa, 
   number of subscribers, 
   sponsored headlines examples, 
   links to potential 300x250 ads , or ideas for a 300x250 ad, 
  ( in no particular order ), 
  or anything you want , we really do n't know what to do for the ad ... 
   similar reddits that exist, 
  * [ / r/space ] ( / r/space ), 
  * [ / r/aerospace ] ( / r/aerospace ), 
   why we should promote you, 
  * many people ( and redditors ) admire nasa 's goals and achievements , and our subreddit gives them a place to share and discuss same . 
  * nasa and nasa 's projects are a sometimes contentious subject and having a separate subreddit for them keeps the debates within a nasa oriented zone . 
  * a lot of redditors actually work at or with nasa ( like one another_user_name of the our mods ) , and are able to provide both connections and information for people interested in nasa , it 's projects , people and sister organizations . 
  already , turbinator has been providing information about what goes on in the iss . 
  * nasa 's mission includes education , outreach and the proliferation of nasa developed ideas and technologies . 
  reddit has proven a good place for these goals in other fields and thus fits well with the nasa mission .
