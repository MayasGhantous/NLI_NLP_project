  about 10 days ago [ we had this thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/nasa/comments/1m5gb8/what_do_you_want_to_see_in_this_subreddit/ ), 
  this is a continuation of that thread ( you can also ask for changes in this thread ) here are some of the things you guys wanted . 
  * ** tags . 
  some ( pics , videos , self , ) of the tags will be put on automatically but other ones have to be done either by us mods or the submitter . 
  you can either the tag of their own post . 
  * ** pic of the week/month on the sidebar **, 
  we will have a thread either every week or month , where you guys get to submit images in the comments and the most upvoted picture ( downvotes will not count ) will be pick to be on the sidebar of a month or week ( have n't decide ) . 
  the css is back ( slightly modify ) , some things still need fixing . 
  * ** upvotes/downvotes **, 
  the upvotes/downvotes still working on those , if someone want to make some we use that are also colorblind friendly it would be gladly appreciated . 
  as of now we will use the regular reddits ones .

  * multiple hardware . 
  ( you will be able to choose hardware that makes sense for you . ), 
  * valve will release the first one , a prototype . 
  * there will be a hardware beta that you can participate in if you are eligible . 
  * coming 2014 ( from different manufacturers from the sound of it ) . 
  probably the most relevant part to most people here is this question . 
   i 'm pretty happy with my pc gaming setup , do i have to buy a new piece of hardware now ? 
  everything that we 've been doing on steam for the last 10 years will continue to move forward .
