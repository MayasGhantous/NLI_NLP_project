  hello everyone ,, 
  over the last several hours we have been getting an influx of new users . 
  so i would like to just cover a few things . 
  we do n't have a banned word list so please do n't do this, 
  all the rules are on the sidebar , i changed them today because i added the old ones when i was added as mod since there were no rules , but i thought we needed something more specific to this subreddit and clearer . 
  1 . and any rule change will be added to the sidebar . 
  anyways , enjoy the sub . 
  so as you may have notice this subreddit is currently trending . 
  so i would like to take a moment to go over a few things . 
  this subreddit has very strict content rules . 
  ** only article and news are allow here . 
  1 . videos pictures memes etc are all remove using automoderator it will leave a comment when your post is remove . 
  1 . to submit a post your account needs to be at least 1 week old or have 10 ** comment ** karma . 
  also you may want to subscribe to / r/tech there we have a very good group of moderators and have less limitations on submissions . 
  the subreddit is / r/pcgaming so i have it working fine on [ the front page ] ( https://i.imgur.com/igfk32z.png ) however because on the comments it goes [ under the comment area ] ( https://i.imgur.com/ygq7pqs.png ) i made it hover the opposite of the links [ like this but as you can see the html title blocks it ... ] ( https://i.imgur.com/6xgrz6k.png ), 
  the code, 
  / ************ userflairs ************ /, 
  . flair {, 
  background : transparent url ( % % pcflairs % % ) no-repeat -9999 px ;, 
  position : relative ;, 
  text-decoration : none ;, 
  . flair : hover : after {, 
  background : #c 50202 ;, 
  background : rgba ( 197 , 2 , 2 , 1 ) ;, 
  color : #fff ;, 
  display : block ;, 
  left : 0 % ;, 
  position : absolute ;, 
  z-index : 9999 ;, 
  . flair : hover : before {, 
  border-color : rgba ( 197 , 2 , 2 , 1 ) transparent ;, 
  content : '' '' ;, 
  display : block ;, 
  left : 15 % ;, 
  position : absolute ;, 
  z-index : 9999 ;, 
  / * this i did to get working the way it is on the comments * /, 
  . comment . flair : hover : after {, 
  . comment . flair : hover : before {, 
  / ************ end of userflairs ************ /, 
  also is there anyways to make the hover not appear if the user does n't add any text to the flair ? 
  right now it [ comes up like this ] ( https://i.imgur.com/ips8zpw.png ), 
  e3 starts in just about 2 weeks . 
  so what do you guys want to see at this years e3 ? 
  also we now have steam & origin flair options for you to use . 
  ( edit : lol looks like i forgot to turn on user edit , you can now put your steam id on there is you want . ), 
  and we have and irc channel ( no one goes there but ) do any of you want to help run it ?
