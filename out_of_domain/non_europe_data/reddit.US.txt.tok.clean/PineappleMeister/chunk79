  ### other sale threads, 
  * to be updated, 
  note : amazon sales require a billing address in the united states . 
  the prices and discounts listed here may be inaccurate for some games for the first ~ 10 minutes of a new daily/flash/community choice sale because steam does not always update them instantly . 
  ** please be patient while they update , and avoid making comments about the `` terrible discount for xxxx game '' until all prices have fully updated . 
  however , if there is still an incorrect price in these tables after all games have fully updated to their actual discount , please let me know via pm .

  we will be removing all other summer sale threads that are cluttering the / r/pcgaming/new section ( unless there is big news that deserve it 's own thread ), 
  so i implemented a new tabmenu on / r/nasa , works fine on chrome with and w/o res . 
  and it what 's weird is that works on my test sub / r/toy on ff with and w/o res . 
  some screenshots, 
  [ / r/toy firefox with res ] ( https://i.imgur.com/h62taet.png ) working fine . 
  [ / r/nasa chrome with res ] ( https://i.imgur.com/ddkqkyv.png ) working fine . 
  [ / r/nasa firefox with res ] ( https://i.imgur.com/nqzovte.png ) not working . 
  as far as i can tell it 's like this, 
  browser | subreddit | res | no res, 
  chrome | / r/nasa | works | works, 
  chrome | / r/toy | works | works, 
  ff | / r/nasa | does n't work | works, 
  ff | / r/toy | works | works, 
  edit : solved probably !, 
  i literally just had to removed close to 30 evolve alpha key giveaway/request threads ... 
  post giveaways here , other threads about this are not allow . 
  we are going to be adjusting rule # 4 , the old rule was this, 
  old, 
   rule # 4 : no image macros , contextless screenshots , pictures of gaming collections , pictures of your gaming rigs or parts . 
  pictures of text , gaming collections , or pictures of your gaming rigs or parts go in our pc gaming rig picture ** [ monthly megathread . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/search?q=rig pictures + megathread & restrict_sr = on ) **, 
  new, 
   rule # 4 : no memes , all image posts must be in a self post with proper context , if it 's a pictures of your gaming rigs or parts those go in our megathread only . 
  all direct image links will be remove . 
  pictures of gaming rigs , and parts go in our ** [ pc gaming rig picture monthly megathread . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/search?q=rig pictures + megathread & restrict_sr = on ) **, 
  so why are we doing this ? 
  for 2 reasons , first we currently remove about 90 % of all direct image post for not having context , as per our old rule . 
  and because as this sub grows low effort post will tend to dominate the front page as it does in all big subreddits , we feel this new rule will help prevent that ( or at least try to ) . 
  you can also use this thread for general feedback regarding the subreddit , if you have any suggestions , or things you want change/fix post about it here .
