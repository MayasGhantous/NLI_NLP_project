  ~ ~ this should work for both comments and the front page . 
  also made the blue a little smaller ~ ~, 
  ~ ~ edit : opps miss read your comment , now it will should only work on comments . ~ ~, 
   and it does n't change anything when not using res . 
  it working for me w/o res on your reddit . 
  try reloading your page . 
  i made a ninja edit ( you may have miss it ) the code above should only work on the comments page . 
  try this would be better i look at the res code ( i think anyways ) and here this is what they use .

  yea i miss read the post ... 2 time ... : , 
  you can try a `` pre-made '' theme / u/iamducky has a list you can use, 
  ca n't be done with css , but you can use a bot . 
  automod can do it iirc . 
  or anywhere above ~ 86 street apparently . 
  tables do n't go in the stylesheet they go in the description box on your subreddit settings, 
  some | header | labels, 
  left-justified | center-justified | right-justified, 
  a | b | c, 
  d | e | f, 
   some | header | labels, 
   left-justified | center-justified | right-justified, 
   a | b | c, 
   d | e | f, 
  remove the  . 
  you ca n't use if/else conditions in css ( afaik ) . 
  ~ ~ try this i got it to work but yea ... ~ ~, 
  well that did n't work . 
  lol all the comments where i tested are my own . 
  and of course it does n't work i even posted with part missing it ( should have had a.author ) but still that does n't work either sorry ! . 
  not sure i get what you want but if you talking about the `` no screenshot '', 
  blocking the link you can use this adjusted to work best for you . 
  they have n't talk much about psn ( only about the gaikai stuff ) for the ps4 , i 'm guessing they are keeping those thing for e3 or that rumer press conference for before e3 . 
   aside from that i 've never played a good exclusive imo no my ps3 . 
  it has sat collecting dust since gran turismo 4 came out . 
  he apparetly has n't played it since gran turismo ** 4 ** ... 
  sony has n't said anything about psn yet so we do n't if it is free for the ps4 ( i do think however that lots of the gaikai stuff will be paid maybe except for the demos thing ), 
   is this possible ? 
  not with css . 
  you can do it with a bot ( i think ) . 
  that was bad . 
  will e3 be broadcast on tv this year ? 
  since g4 no longer does gaming , will anyone be covering it . 
  ( i guess maybe spike but last year they only did ms. ) i wander if no one will be broadcasting it nintendo 's conference on tv they decided it was not worth it and it was better to do a nintendo direct . 
  they will be there and will have playable games on there for the visitors ( did you not read the post ? ), 
  they will also have a nintendo direct , they just wo n't have a live conference like companies usually do . 
  yes but only ms conference , i said that in my comment . 
  i get your point , but my other comments on this thread was asking if e3 conferences will be broadcast this year on tv , because g4 is no longer in business . 
  so if it will not be , i do n't feel like going with a nintendo direct online would be any different than a online only press conference . 
  lets see some random words and one in spanish , let me guess pitbull 's new single ? 
  we really need someone else on that position ... 
  cano !!, 
  cano 's swing is beautiful . 
  i think he was out ... but better for us that it was overturn so yey !, 
  i wish he had the helmet on , as the head looks a bit weird for some reason . 
  still it 's a nice poster !, 
  i want to hold a cup next to it and drink some of that water . 
  your account is shadow banned you may want to contact the admins / r/reddit . com, 
  click his username . 
  fyi i ca n't see when you reply to me , no one can ( i have to approve the comments so people can see it ) . 
  you need to contact the admins via / r/reddit . com message the mods there . 
  so they can fix it ( unless you are a spammer where they will just banned you again ), 
  . . keep getting what ? 
  i 'm secretly hoping that the chips they have to stream games to the vita and stuff , will also be use to stream to a vr headset that they will announce at e3 . 
  / crosses fingers ( mostly never going to happen ), 
  i think they could sell it for $ 300 ( about the same as the oculus ) and advertise as not needing a tv to use your ps4 i think they would get the money . 
  why do keep you posting ? 
  people ca n't see what you post unless one of the mods approves it i told you how you can fix it , if i see another one of your comments i wo n't approve it again . 
  did you do to / r/reddit . com ? 
  and they told you that ? 
  because those mods there are the admins i feel they told you more the just that . 
  ps i ca n't see when you reply to me . 
  that 's a tibetan mastiff actually , the name is in the url ...

  the $ 999 mba has a 64gb ssd , i for one prefer they go with a traditional drive and more storage . 
  oh ? , i was kinda agreeing with you that it 's not worth the cost i most like made the comment because i went and look it up and was disappointed when it was only a 64gb .
