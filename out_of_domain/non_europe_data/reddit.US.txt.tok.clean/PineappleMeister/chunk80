  a user ca n't click the creddit buttons as shown in the gif , but i do n't know how to get this window to show up ( it looks like you need reddit gold creddits ) so i ca n't test what 's wrong with it . 
  i made the selector for the icon that shows up there more specific , so that it does n't show up anymore but i ca n't even tell if that help ... 
  [ link to magethread # 1 ] ( http://redd.it/33xqk8 ) ( removed to keep clutter down ), 
  this will probably be the last of these . 
  the subreddit is not being dominate by only one topic . 
  ~ ~ ** you can post anything about the paid mods on this thread . 
  ~ ~ because of the megathread , links and text post about this topic to the subreddit will be regulated . 
  * ~ ~ all ** self/text-post ** will be remove . ~ ~, 
  * ~ ~ link post ** can be posted if they are news . 
  ( not opinion pieces , forum links , twitter ) ~ ~, 
  ~ ~ i 'm going to cycle the thread every 24 hours or 1000 comments whatever comes first ~ ~, 
  looks like we wo n't be needing this anymore . 
  * ** number of subscribers : ** 133,118, 
  * i 'm a moderator, 
  * ** why we should choose your subreddit and your ad for promotion ? 
  because we feel lots of people want a pc oriented gaming subreddit that focuses on gaming news and playing games , and away from memes/satire/etc and this is what we try to do in / r/pcgaming .
