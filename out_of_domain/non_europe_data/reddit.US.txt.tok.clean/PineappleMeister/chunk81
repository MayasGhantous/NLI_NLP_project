   every fan of metal gear has their favorite game in the series . 
  for some , it 's the unique gameplay quirks , memorable set pieces , or specific plot points that dictate their adoration for one game over another . 
  when defining the best metal gear game , things get trickier , but with the phantom pain , that problem is finally resolved . 
  there has never been a game in the series with such depth to its gameplay , or so much volume in content . 
  the best elements from the past games are here , and the new open-world gameplay adds more to love on top . 
  when it comes to storytelling , there has never been a metal gear game that 's so consistent in tone , daring in subject matter , and so captivating in presentation . 
  the phantom pain may be a contender for one of the best action games ever made , but is undoubtedly the best metal gear game there is . 
  [ ign ] ( http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/24/metal-gear-solid-5-the-phantom-pain-review ) 10/10, 
   the phantom pain is the kind of game i thought would never exist - one where every minute gameplay detail has true purpose . 
  its lack of story focus is sure to be divisive for the metal gear faithful , but the resulting emphasis on my story , my tales of espionage action , easily make it my favorite in the series . 
  there have certainly been sandbox action games that have given me a bigger world to roam , or more little icons to chase on my minimap , but none have pushed me to plan , adapt , and improvise the way this one does . 
  metal gear solid 5 : the phantom pain does n't just respect my intelligence as a player , it expects it of me , putting it in league that few others occupy . 
  [ respawn ninja ] ( http://respawn.ninja/2015/08/metal-gear-solid-v-the-phantom-pain-review/ ) 10/10, 
   metal gear solid : the phantom pain is quite possibly ( more than likely ) the last hurrah from kojima in this franchise and from the level of detail , the brilliant cinematography style missions to the massive expansion of gameplay with mother base management -- he 's going out with a bang . 
  the introduction of the game was really powerful and basically took that level of momentum throughout the entire campaign . 
  it 's incredible to see the amount of work gone into this title and you can see kojima and the team really poured their soul into this game to give it character . 
  this is simply one of the best games i 've played this year . 
  [ metal gear informer ] ( http://www.metalgearinformer.com/?p=21259 ) 10/10, 
   for a series that has been around since 1987 to constantly reinvent itself and stay relevant is an accomplishment in itself . 
  but to totally break what you expect a game can do for you emotionally & mentally -- and at the end of the day have fun with it and give you legitimate joy -- is something special . 
  [ examiner ] ( http://www.examiner.com/review/metal-gear-solid-v-the-phantom-pain-ps4-review-kojima-is-perfect-once-more ) 5/5, 
   it 's difficult to effectively describe everything this game has to offer . 
  it 's difficult to think about the next time we see a new metal gear solid and when that will be . 
  it is , however , not difficult to say that metal gear solid v : the phantom pain is the best game of the year so far . 
  [ the daily dot ] ( http://www.dailydot.com/geek/metal-gear-solid-v-phantom-pain-review/ ) 5/5, 
   aside from being a mildly engrossing troop management feature , mother base acts as a narrative precursor to big boss ' outer heaven fortress . 
  it 's just one of a number of key elements in the phantom pain that adds gravitas to the events that preceded this chapter in big boss ' stor -- and the known metal gear-related incidents that have yet to come . 
  it takes talent to make the player think that a game director is `` phoning in '' a story only to realize later that every narrative beat had some degree of meaning . 
  it 's only when i completed the story that i realized that every scene that made me rub my chin in puzzlement is a proverbial breadcrumb that offers a new perspective upon second viewing . 
  a couple revelations are even significant enough to make one rethink the series as a whole . 
  this is one of those rare instances where marathoning a game series is more meaningful after the latest sequel is released , not before . 
  [ egm ] ( http://www.egmnow.com/articles/reviews/metal-gear-solid-v-the-phantom-pain-review/ ) 9.5 / 10, 
   even metal gear solid v : the phantom pain 's missteps show a certain boldness that is absent from the big budget games space . 
  it is unafraid to experiment , not just on the franchise 's structure , but on mechanics readily established as standards in the industry . 
  delivering the most realized open-world stealth game to date in addition to the customizability for players to approach every challenge however they see fit , the phantom pain not only changes the rules of the metal gear solid series , ultimately altering the trajectory of the franchise , if it does continue , while simultaneously changing the idea of what can be accomplished with an open world game , both narratively and mechanically . 
  [ gametrailers ] ( http://www.gametrailers.com/reviews/cy43vw/metal-gear-solid-v--the-phantom-pain-review ) 9.3 / 10, 
   make no mistake , though , the phantom pain is excellent . 
  it expands and enriches metal gear solid without compromising the qualities that make the series so beloved . 
  despite the huge scope , hollywood talent , and technical flashiness , there 's a subtlety to the phantom pain that 's truly captured our hearts . 
  even now we 're still turning its events over and over again in our minds . 
  so rarely do game stories demand so much consideration . 
  decades later , it 's incredible that metal gear can still captivate , inspire , and amaze . 
  the phantom pain is another significant addition to an enduring legacy .
