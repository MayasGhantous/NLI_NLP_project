  you 're projecting pretty heavily . 
  because the toaster is n't going to reject you , and if it does , it wo n't leave scars on your ego . 
  because people do n't want to be in the vicinity of you when you allow the gases in your stomach to enter the air that they 're breathing ? 
  you do n't go to a club to talk , you go to a club to experience primal human interaction . 
  except they 're not risking their lives for our country ( u.s. ) . 
  we 're not under any threat of being invaded and no country has declared war on us . 
  they 're not fighting to defend the united states , they 're fighting to overthrow foreign governments . 
  sounds like you have social anxiety . 
  to stay alive ? 
  so what is the theoretical pronunciation ? 
  that 's the thing . 
  for a book intended for children , it has so many deeper meanings that what you read on the surface . 
  the evolution of type ii adult-onset diabetes . 
  anyone know if this guy posts in / r/theredpill ? 
  commie ? 
  but ... communism would imply * equality * , and we ca n't have any of that with the redpill now , can we ? 
  i used to do this all the time when i was younger !, 
  for example :, 
  person : sasdi avioenj ahseff ? 
  me : what ? 
  yeah , i want to get pizza . 
  i do n't believe your provided example follows . 
  a book and a kindle are vastly different things . 
  while both allow you to read , one is made of paper and ink , while the other is made of plastic and circuit boards . 
  in a same-sex marriage or an opposite-sex marriage , it 's still the same thing , just different sexes . 
  a very interesting read , if a bit dated . 
  i thought it was already firmly established that a `` twink '' was a young , thin , hairless gay man . 
  as for the ultimate question that is posed , `` what comes after the twink ? '', 
  the answer would be a `` twunk . '', 
  \u042d\u0434i\u0442 : can we make `` baconator '' an actual russian word ? 
  \u041d\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0430 * could * mean `` no translation , '' but it would properly translate over as `` there is no translation . '', 
  it 's pretty simple . 
  latino : mexico and all of central and south america . 
  hispanic : mexico and all of central and south america excluding brazil . 
  you act like those things are exclusive to france . 
  other catholic countries are just as well known for their homophobia . 
  ever visit denmark ? 
  despite being one of the happiest countries , they have a racism problem against africans and middle easterners . 
  as for going to a beach , mountains and a major metropolitan city within an hour , you can get all of that in the south of france .

  when i was a kid i was a really energetic child , but i had no outlet for that energy . 
  as a result , i was often bored , so rather than going outside and playing or whatever else , i ate food for entertainment . 
  i thought nothing of it as a child , and my parents tried to get me to eat less , but they could n't watch me 24/7 , so i eventually gained a lot of weight . 
  it sucked because throughout middle school and high school i was extremely conscious of my weight problems , so i was eating to cope with my low self-esteem as well . 
  now i 've got it mostly under control , and i 'm only about 20 lbs away from my goal weight . 
  if anyone 's wondering , the french at the bottom says , `` this cat 's a dumbass . '', 
  how many men do you know that can sing soprano ? 
  why the fuck were you going 98 in a 65 ? 
  i ca n't be the only one who thought by * weed * op meant ** weed ** . 
  `` i think we should have an open relationship . '', 
  this was after i found out that he had been cheating on me with 3 different guys . 
  i 've got spurs that jingle jangle jingle ^ jingle ^ jangle,

  i have the opposite experience , i 've lost weight in uni . 
  but as the old saying goes , `` broadway does n't jiggle . '', 
  are n't crackheads usually thin ? 
   launches 300 + lbs of solid mass into the corridor, 
   children scatter , squealing , teacher stares, 
  and now there 's chewed up celery on my monitor . 
  je propose / r/cuvedelard, 
  now tell us how you * really * feel . 
  i 'm not disagreeing with you , i just think you 're getting inordinately upset . 
  [ right here my good sir/lady .

  `` and who are you ? '', 
  the proud ham said . 
  and if ginger is anything , it 's a bitch . 
  we ca n't afford to . 
  you 're right , we won our independence in the revolutionary war 35 years previously . 
  because we 're the only country on either continent with `` america '' in its name ? 
  ironic ... 
  i think it 's because when americans criticize the united states , it 's because it 's our home country and we have a deep understanding of it , whereas everyone else mostly just has a cursory glance at american culture from visiting or what they read or see on tv . 
  relative to speaking several languages , consider the size of the average european country . 
  my home state ( michigan ) is larger than several european countries such as slovakia , slovenia , austria , the czech republic , hungary ... now take that and multiply it to the area of 50 states , several of which are larger than my state . 
  thus , you have to take the size of the united states into account . 
  if you lived in kansas , for example , you would have to drive thousands of kilometers in any direction before you 'd reach a place where english is n't people 's first language . 
  oh , really ? 
  i just looked it up , and a flight for 4 from my city to mexico city would cost $ 7,830 alone . 
  that 's over 2 month 's worth of wages . 
  but i mean , it 's not like i need to pay bills or eat for 2 months , right ? 
  oh , i guess the american airlines website is just lying to me . 
  definitely my new favorite gif . 
  all these people talking about coming out and getting a boyfriend a month/a year later ... i 've been out for 5 years and i 've nothing to show for it . 
  my uncle owns a shitty used car dealership in detroit ... so accurate . 
  painful ? 
  i did n't even develop memories until i was 3 . 
  this is a problem with music in russia . 
  when the artist swears , they insert a ridiculously loud * beep * over the word that really fucks up the song . 
  in the united states they make a radio edit that just has the word dropped or changed . 
  actually , the `` absence '' of an accent is called the general american accent and is based around iowa and southern illinois . 
  yes , we call those english muffins here . 
  i 'm not sure why they would advertise that as a biscuit . 
  [ this is what an american biscuit looks like ] ( http://www.pillsbury.com/~/media/pb/images/hero/medium/products/biscuits/biscuit_hero_crop.ashx ), 
  scandinavians put flags on their christmas trees . 
  i rest my case . 
  we do have them ; they 're called elephant ears . 
  the star spangled banner is about the defending of fort mchenry by american soldiers ... i do n't know where you 're getting any of that other bullshit , every american student is taught about the war of 1812 at least once . 
  and i have no idea what you mean by `` you assume everyone else is american if they 're canadian , british or australian . '',
