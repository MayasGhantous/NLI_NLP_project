  tell that to my cuhrves !, 
   omg , you totally stole that tl ; dr from charmed , fatshamer !, 
  actually , `` breeder '' is a derogatory term for heterosexuals . 
  fast food is more expensive everywhere . 
  a burger may cost $ 2 at a fast food place , but you could probably spend $ 5 and make 4 burgers at home . 
  do you * really * think she 'd fit through the moon door ? 
  everything about this series is just magical ; from ginger 's rise and fall , to you and eric having a child together . 
  but now i 'm really sad that it 's over ( for now ) . 
  i love you , / u/tallula , you 're my favorite redditor . 
  i have , actually ... 
  i got banned for saying that fat acceptance and the lgbt rights movement are n't the same thing . 
  i 'm definitely going to wait for the general consensus . 
  i do n't want to go drop $ 60 on it then have it be a total flop like gta iv . 
  that 's deep . 
  wait ... the hostess took them to the back where * no one * was sitting , but she was humiliated by ** all ** the people watching her try and fit into the booth ? 
  i 'm pretty sure his diet just consisted of crack and yogurt . 
  the fuck ? 
  i ca n't understand why he 'd stay with her if he were so embarrassed by her behavior . 
  organization ? 
  check . 
  check . 
  german , confirmed . 
  it 's a common colloquialism when negating verbs in the 1st person singular to contract the sounds . 
  thus , you get something close to the pronunciation of `` jeune '' for `` je ne . '', 
  it 's still a colloquialism , as i said , so a separate pronunciation of je and ne would be proper . 
  the `` e '' in `` devez '' is n't dropped , it 's retracted because the `` stress '' falls on the second `` e. '', 
  it stopped working so i threw it away . 
  the needle was on e and i figured that must mean end . 
  that 's western european/canadian privilege . 
  i ca n't grow a beard . 
  [ i 'm not happy about it , either ] ( http://i.imgur.com/nsazbhm.jpg ), 
  is that a pa i see ? 
  subtle , subtle . 
  how many rice cookers do you have ? 
  do your parents leave their television remotes in the plastic baggies they came in ? 
  another guy with a pa chiming in . 
  you 're having a piece of sharpened , tri-beveled steel shoved through your penis ; it 's not going to be painless , but it is n't nearly as painful as you think it will be . 
  as i remember it , it was a sharp prick ( ha ! ), 
  then a slightly warm feeling , which was just the blood , it turns out , and it was over . 
  recovery is said to be about 4-6 weeks , though you 'll usually stop having any difficulty with it after 1-2 weeks , but you wo n't be able to stretch or have sex or anything until it 's completely healed . 
  the biggest thing i can tell you it make sure your piercer uses the correct diameter ring . 
  when i did it , the piercer used a 5/8 '' ring and i did n't think it would be a problem , but as it turns out it was too small and it felt like it was ripping my dick in half every time i got hard , which made sleeping very uncomfortable for obvious reasons . 
  a week later i went to a 3/4 '' and it hurt for about a week afterward and everything was all good . 
  so i have a really good female friend that i met at university . 
  being acting majors , we were sociable with all the other acting and musical theatre majors because we were n't a particularly large department . 
  the friend and i were basically inseparable , so one day the friend and i were sitting next to one another when she got up to go to the restroom and one of the female musical theatre majors comes up and says , `` you two make a really cute couple ! '', 
  i started laughing , she looked confused . 
  i had to explain to her that i was a raging homosexual and that we were just friends . 
  * looks at username *, 
  uh , that middle part ... the gay part ? 
  yeah , you did n't need to include that . 
  i can see the outline of your penis . 
  you 're hilarious . 
  troy , fool . 
  we rockin ' dat low crime rate and higher gradient standard of livin ' . 
  troy colts 4 lyfe , homie . 
  gay guys are just as bad in that regard . 
  it 's nothing but #gay #gayboy #gaylove #lgbt #queer #gayteen #gaylife #acceptance #bornthisway #rainbow #f 4f, 
  i did n't realize all those hash tags applied to that photo of your sandwich . 
  it 's not easy being cheesy . 
  edit : oh , and being gay does n't help . 
  two of my female friends have the last names `` potter '' and `` riddle . '', 
  needless to say , their nicknames throughout school were harry and tom . 
  hey , my last name is best !, 
  let 's get married , have kids and change their last names to `` meh . '', 
  he said gay people were bringing god 's wrath upon the nation . 
  the only thing that has a logo at br are certain styles of the men 's polo which has [ a little elephant on it ] ( http://www.buyredtag.net/image.php?type=p&amp;id=195 ), 
  b ** r ** and , not band . 
  could you explain this to me ? 
  i work at banana republic and from what i 've seen , gap inc. is a great company to work for . 
  we refer to that as gap and banana republic 's mentally challenged younger brother . 
  gray is a color . 
  grey is a colour . 
  first off , i love you , cher . 
  you 're the inspiration that makes me want to be a performer . 
  now to the questions :, 
  is what kathy says about you true , or is she just exaggerating ? 
  if you could have any other career , what would it be ? 
  what shampoo do you use ? 
  lastly , i dressed like you for a halloween party and i made $ 62 doing cher impression . 
  it 's not really relevant , i just thought you might appreciate it ( i 'm a male , by the way ) . 
  my friend has had sex with more than one of her cousins , but she 's danish , so she 's basically related to every dane in one way or another . 
  you just eat around it . 
  the quality does n't affect it , it 's just a simple case of supply and demand . 
  so is smashing a plate against the back of someone 's head , and groping a minor , and keying someone 's car , but that did n't stop hammer . 
  i think you need to have your parents read these . 
  perhaps it will give them the perspective they need to actually do something about him . 
  i would switch m\u00eame around to read `` le m\u00eame jour . '', 
  le jour m\u00eame reads as `` the very day , '' `` the exact day , '' or `` the day itself . '', 
  yay !, 
  a woman 's self-worth is based only on how sexually pure she is !, 
  thanks for reminding that sexually-active women must truly be the scum of the earth , huh ? 
  * so alfalfa *, 
  they 've got their panties in a twist because they think rape is n't a thing . 
  i 'm not sure if it was that user or another gay trper , but he said that he liked trp `` logic '' because he realized women did n't like him . 
  he spouted off some bullshit about how women wo n't want you to be their token gay friend anymore once they 're married and have children . 
  he made some false cause argument about gay men being a proxy for straight men , and that they wo n't need you once they get a husband .
