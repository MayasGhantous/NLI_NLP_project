  no , you did n't , but you 're a self-avowed redpiller , and a woman 's marriageability factor is one of the central tenets of trp . 
   but she was ` miring my gainz !, 
  how could i say no ? 
  i was the victim here !, 
  i do n't recall where i saw it , but i read a study that showed that if one twin has a certain sexual orientation , there is a ~ 75 % chance that the other twin will have the same orientation . 
  i do n't know what you 're talking about . 
  oils , fats and refined sugars are at the top of the food pyramid . 
  obviously they 're the most important , so she eats those the most . 
  what ? 
  why ca n't we ** wo ** man the harpoons ? 
  you mean with great mayo ? 
   i do n't need to justify myself to you . 
  i haz a condishun , it 's just super rare and you 've probably never heard of it . 
  * swing and a miss !, 
  no , they are n't . 
  it would help to see a picture of what you 're talking about , but the issue itself could be caused by a number of different things . 
  it may be that the diameter of the ring is too small , you might be having an allergic reaction to the metal , your skin may not be as strong . 
  my suggestion would be to down gauge to 8ga in titanium to 1 ) make some room in the piercing and 2 ) take the pressure off the upper side of the piercing . 
  my father 's sisters wrote a 4 page letter to my mother telling her how much of a bitch she was and she was no good for my father and their marriage would never last . 
  twenty one years later and my parents are still married , meanwhile , my aunts have all been divorced or remarried . 
  bully ii : the return of gary, 
  a spare tire , a tire iron and a bag of chex mix . 
  do n't forget , you have to shout , `` stay tuned for an all new ally mcbeal ! '', 
  otherwise , the bear wo n't run away . 
  those are oddly specific . 
  you 're being deliberately obtuse . 
  people cheat , people `` trade up , '' it 's a known fact . 
  if a bisexual person decides to cheat , he/she has twice as many people to choose from . 
  because it 's biphobic regardless of what you say !, 
  pretty sure i 've seen him in a porno . 
  it 's a man . 
  it 's definitely a man . 
  i recognize the waistband of his underwear as fruit of the loom , and bke67 are a line of men 's jeans from buckle . 
   my mom ... and my dad ... * they 're older than me now *, 
  i would certainly hope so . 
  thank you !, 
  so many of my friends like jrpgs , but to me , they 're basically a slightly interactive anime , not a video game . 
  well , men ca n't get gestational diabetes . 
  there does exist a sizable lgbt teen genre where the novels usually center around the trials and tribulations of coming out and the like . 
  at least he 's not one of those people who 's fifty pounds overweight and describes his body type as `` average . '', 
  what the fuck is a sheel ? 
  i sawr it . 
  ` ello , ` ow are you ? 
  ` ave you seen my ` ickory ` atchet ? 
  ably performed by the ensemble, 
  which is ironic considering there could be 20 different pronunciations of the same word in an english city . 
   way to judge from behind the monitor, 
  judges from behind his monitor . 
  i do n't know what you 're talking about . 
  this just makes me more bitter and jaded . 
  ( baseless ) fat shaming has got to stop !, 
  that 's * still * no excuse . 
  as a male knitter/crocheter , i frequently have to adjust patterns to get things like socks and gloves to fit when they 're originally written for women . 
  you know how difficult that is ? 
  not very . 
  it 's just a matter of increasing the number of stitches until you 've got the correct length or width . 
  that carbon-based life-form, 
  except for penis , that just gets bigger !, 
   * poc get this so fucking much *, 
  as told by a white person . 
  i 've never done the bone press method , i just measure from the tip to my pelvis . 
  [ like this ] ( http://31.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m3mg9weq5h1rnjkdpo1_500.gif ), 
  so english . 
  thank you !, 
  music , food , current events , politics , religion ? 
  apart from politics and religion those are all such topical subjects that you could talk to anyone about . 
  uh ... take your pants off . 
  when and where ? 
  then can we have a pj party ... . . a naked pj party ? 
  as a strong , able man who happens to be gay , please do n't try and speak for the rest of us . 
   if i wanted to fuck something that acted , talked and looked like a chick , i would fuck a chick . 
  do you have any idea how many times people have used that argument as to why being gay is wrong ? 
  i find it funny that you call yourself `` gay-friendly , '' yet in this thread you 've used the terms `` queens , '' `` fucking flamers '' and `` flaming poofdah . '', 
  i can feel the love . 
  i 'm questioning the validity of this photograph . 
  you mean to tell me that this man was split in half and there 's virtually ** no ** blood ? 
  queen is , the other two are not . 
  edit : despite that , he 's made it perfectly clear that he 's straight . 
  not exactly part of the community , no ? 
  i do n't live in the uk , nor does aiku . 
  flamer and poofter are considered derogatory in the us , though the only people i 've heard use the term `` poofter '' are english men over the age of 50 . 
  a baseball bat, 
  a ) i 'm not hiding behind anything . 
  if you replaced your statement with `` typical male black voice , '' you know that would be considered racist . 
  b ) the second caption foretold nothing , you just tried to disarm anyone from criticizing you by calling them idiots . 
  that 's double plusgood . 
  keep it up comrade . 
  what does reproduction have to do with anything ? 
  does that mean heterosexuality is also an illness because it prevents someone from enjoying gay sex ? 
  that 's rather arbitrary . 
  if people , regardless of orientation , do n't want to reproduce , does n't that then invalidate your statement that it it 's instinct to want to reproduce ? 
  i have to agree with the general consensus of video . 
  i tell myself every day i have what it takes to be a successful actor , and that i do n't need a degree . 
  lately , i have n't been so sure . 
  i 'm from troy , so ... sorry .
