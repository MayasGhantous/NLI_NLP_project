  [ smashing , let me just get ready !, 
  ] ( http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lngtvkifrz1qeqwogo1_500.gif ), 
  just remember , there 's a chance she was born while kurt cobain was still alive . 
  did she win the wii ? 
  yes !, 
  you 're absolutely correct . 
  h&m is a swedish company and uses european sizes . 
  it 's both a curse and a blessing because i can get attractive european style clothing , but i have to wear a medium , as opposed to the small i can get away with in american clothing . 
  banana republic 's tailored slim fit shirts fit really nicely throughout , though they 're a bit pricey . 
  after losing 50 pounds , i can say , yes , yes it does make it bigger . 
  yes , he made zombie films popular in the united states ... forty five years ago , that does n't mean he 's an authority on current tastes and trends of zombie films now . 
  i do n't know what you expect of the group . 
  they 're living during the zombie apocalypse , and they 're not going to just hop up and move to a new place every episode , they 're looking for a place they can live and grow . 
  the mod does n't take into consideration that n ^ * x * more fat people get heart attacks than thin people . 
  more heart attacks = more chances at least one will survive . 
  i 'm glad andrea died . 
  she had * at least * 5 different occasions when she could have done the right thing . 
  she could have listened to michonne , she could have stayed at the prison , she could have killed the governor that first time , or that second time or that third time , but she did n't . 
  italian is a nationality , not a race . 
  nope , you just attack and murder people that have a different religion . 
  you 're projecting pretty hard . 
  where will * you * be when your laxative takes effect ? 
  that 's why i have him/her tagged with `` hit me with the ching ching '' in bright blue . 
  they only care insofar as they can say they 're morally superior to all other white people . 
  and two children named jordan and jamie . 
  so ... you support racism as long as it 's against white people ? 
  dun talk to i like dat , shitlordmon !, 
  me fi take dawn de patriarchy meself . 
  me are a proud womon , me no need a mon , mon. 
  boom bye bye in a misogynist head . 
  ... y-yes . 
  yes . 
  she asks someone for an opinion . 
  someone replies . 
  she says she was n't asking for an opinion . 
  yeah , like when people use the word `` lame '' to mean things they do n't like . 
  stop oppressing me because of my physical disability by using a word that is hardly ever used in that context !!, 
  this is easily one of the most ironic things i 've ever read . 
  if the situation were flipped , a white person hating a black person , you would decry it as racism , even if the black person were an asshole . 
  okay , do you not understand that racism is racism , regardless of who it 's directed at ? 
  but you also have to remember that romney spent the entirety of the election toeing the political line . 
  whether his true beliefs or not , he 's not hard-line republican enough for this group . 
  now how about i give you the ** real ** definition of racism , not the one from a book called * portraits of white racism * ? 
  according to dictionary.com it is , [ `` a belief or doctrine that inherent differences among the various human races determine cultural or individual achievement , usually involving the idea that one 's own race is superior and has the right to rule others . 
  '' ] ( http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/racism?s=t ), 
  yes , white people have it easier , no , that does n't mean you can be assholes to them because of it . 
  why did n't you address my definition ? 
  do you deny the definition i gave ? 
  no and no . 
  it 's not outdated and white people 's power status is irrelevant . 
  before you make that judgement why do n't you read [ this thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/1seelc/black_people_of_reddit_who_have_spent_time_in/ ) where quite a few black people have said that they find american black people to extremely racist toward white people ? 
  you 're literally the type of person op is talking about . 
  assassin 's creed : black bag, 
  that 's racist . 
  that tree 's in birmingham !, 
  the original asker did n't even say it was reverse racism , he just said it was regular racism . 
  cucumbers are fruit , though . 
   if i 'm like a size 10 or 12 is your idea of `` big '', 
  i 'm a fully grown male and i 'm a size 8 . 
  bitch , you 're big . 
  if they say it 's `` transmisogyny '' then are n't they inherently adhering to the gender binary that dresses are `` women 's '' clothing ? 
  and mine . 
  granted , it 's only been one year , but i 've kept those 60lbs off without any fluctuations . 
  of course , because white people do n't have real culture , they just raped it from other , noble , colored societies . 
  that japanese artist was reclaiming his culture . 
  as i was reading this , i was thinking , `` this person has really poor swedish spelling . '', 
  that 's actually not true . 
  assuming you stay under a certain caloric limit , regardless of physical activity , you 'll lose weight . 
  when it comes to selling clothes , we actually flip it . 
  we call older women `` miss '' to make them feel younger , and we call younger women `` ma'am '' to make them feel respected . 
  yeah , i ca n't find a ps4 anywhere save for ebay where a bunch of assholes are selling it for a ridiculous markup . 
  i 'm not sure whether you 're aware of this or not , but \u0441\u0443\u043a\u0430 ( suka ) is russian for `` bitch . '', 
  now i really want some goddamn roast chicken . 
  well , it 's almost a cobb salad . 
  exactly , when i first started running i could barely run a quarter of a mile without getting winded and i hated it . 
  now i can run at least 4 miles and i love it . 
  i 've never seen someone unblinkingly use a strawman that seriously . 
  see also : personal incredulity, 
  though it did have some meat to it . 
   who is doing * xis * best, 
  my chinese friend gave me a rice cooker . 
  is she an accomplice in my appropriation ? 
  look , dubloons !, 
  do n't drop 'em !, 
  til cisgendered gay people do n't exist . 
  i do n't know about the cost , but it actually took 3 years to animate her hair . 
  a clear case of doublethink if i 've ever seen it . 
  the three abrahamic religions ( christianity , judaism and islam ) actually have no problem with loans , it 's charging interest for loans that is considered sinful i.e. 
  usury . 
  jews were often targeted for the simple fact that they were the `` majority minority '' in most of europe . 
  did you read the comments ? 
   `` homos are worse than beasts '' `` fags are animals '' `` our lord gave them aids because of their transgressions '', 
  those all sound pretty hateful . 
  i 'll give you some perspective . 
  to me , a vagina looks like a weird flappy , droopy , wet flower and i ca n't look at one [ without thinking of this ] ( http://www.freewebs.com/shaarok/m2.jpg ), 
  * bang *, 
  i just use alt key codes . 
  and swedish only requires six codes for three letters : \u00c4\u00e4 \u00d6\u00f6 \u00c5\u00e5, 
  i 'm not being hitler !,
