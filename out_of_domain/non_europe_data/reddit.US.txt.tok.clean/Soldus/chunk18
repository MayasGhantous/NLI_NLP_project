  well , you would know , liar . 
  get out of here , m. night shyamalamadingdong !, 
  yeah , i 'm a 5 ' 9 '' man and i 'm only 15lbs heavier than her . 
  no one can own a natural food like a plant , but they can be recognized as the creator of prepared food . 
  for example , brie de meaux has been granted an aoc ( appellation d'origine contr\u00f4l\u00e9e ) since 1980 , which basically means nobody can term something as `` brie de meaux '' unless it 's made to the exact standard as the laiteries in brie , france . 
  yeah , let 's change the gender systems for 800 year old languages because feelz !, 
  nobody 's saying he ca n't have his opinion , they 're just saying it 's ignorant and illogical . 
  that 's a terrible analogy . 
  you ca n't force yourself to like the taste of something , but you can absolutely change the way you think about something . 
  it 's not ironic , telling someone to stop being homophobic is not the same as telling a gay person to accept himself . 
  i hope you go around to seafood restaurants and barbecues telling people how sinful they are with as much virulence . 
  my brother and his ex got into a verbal fight and she called the police and said he hit her ( he did n't ) but they still took him to jail . 
  i think it 's easy to say `` go easy on them '' when you 're not in that situation . 
  what if the woman had a knife , or a gun , or happened to be smaller but much stronger than you ? 
   us white people are assholes to this day . 
  do n't try and make blanket statements about the whole based on the shitty actions of the few . 
  but with social anxiety , it 's just other people in general that make you anxious , no ? 
  i 'm guessing with this guy , he 'd be perfectly fine around someone , then become uncomfortable only after he found out that person was gay . 
  that 's bullshit . 
  being disgusted by homosexuality is in no way natural . 
  i 'm gay and i 'm not disgusted by heterosexuality , i 'm indifferent to it because it does n't affect me . 
  interesting that that sjw uses `` favourite '' as an example when in french it 's spelled favori/favorite . 
  so , in reality , americans spell it more closely to french than commonwealthers . 
  but if they did n't arbitrarily change the definitions of words how are they supposed to justify being racists ? 
  you ca n't score a goal if you move the goal posts !, 
  yes , i have an anecdote , but where 's your source to support the claim that `` most men are homophobic ? '', 
  also , asexuality is n't being disgusted by sex , it 's a lack of sexual desire . 
  lastly , you can change the way you think and how you feel . 
  it 's pointless to throw your hands up and say , `` well , they 're my emotions , there 's nothing i can do about it ! '', 
  i personally prefer quiltbag, 
  by definition , circumcision * is * normal in the united states . 
  circumcision * has n't * done me any harm , my penis works just fine , thanks . 
  well , she says she wo n't accept criticism from someone who ca n't speak a second language , which ironic because 1 ) she claims she does n't speak english and seemingly only speaks danish and 2 ) i 'm sure she would n't take criticism from anyone , regardless of polyglotism . 
  yes , i 'm perfectly illustrating that your point is incorrect , unless you 're claiming that you know more about the functioning of my penis than i do . 
  * \u266a \u266b the krusty krab , come spend your money ... here !, 
  yes , it 's genital mutilation , but it is normal by american standards , and it 's never negatively affected my or any other man 's penis i 've dealt with . 
  nor does almightybob1 , and please show me where i was trying to justify circumcision . 
  i stated a fact , that the majority of american men are circumcised , and there is nothing wrong with my penis . 
  racism = oppression + power , shitlord . 
  but appropriation is a white thing . 
  if we appropriate , then we 're shitords because appropriation is wrong , but if we do n't appropriate , we 're appropriating because not appropriating is inherently poc so we have to appropriate so as to not appropriate . 
  `` looking for a reason to be offended '' for $ 400, 
  daily double !, 
  i ca n't handle this stupidity anymore . 
  have any of these people been around a 2 year old ? 
  he 's gon na do whatever the fuck he wants regardless of whether you tell him it 's wrong or not . 
  seriously , what is her problem ? 
  does she have some irrational fear of spread legs ? 
  i noticed in her faq that she states no one ever talks about men 's legs , but they always tell women to close their legs . 
  gee , that might not be because women wear skirts/short dresses which could flash their nether regions , could it ? 
  nah , it 's just male privilege . 
  while that move itself is pretty kickass , if she was well aware that it was illegal move , then she should have absolutely been docked points . 
  what 's the point of rules if you 're just going to ignore them ? 
  edit : turns out , she was n't even close to getting a bronze medal , so she did it as a `` fuck you '' to the olympic committee and was happy she was marked down for it . 
  i do n't know where the sjw is getting `` openly racist '' from , but as for the judges being men ? 
  six of the ten judges were women . 
  oh my god , tara lipinski is so graceful !, 
  i 'm always in awe that these people can do all these twists and flips on the ice when i do n't even know how to ice skate . 
   rapies, 
  you 'll find that pretty frequently on grindr . 
  guys will list that they 're hiv + in their profile , and then make a passive-aggressive remark about `` ignorant people , '' which is always , ** always ** directed at negative guys who do n't want to have sex with them . 
  first off , til i 'm a sexual gatekeeper, 
   i do n't know about you , but i hate being told how to think . 
  is that why you 're telling everyone how to think ? 
   preferences are always socially constructed . 
  yes , i remember when mommy told a young me to stay away from those fat , hiv + latino men . 
  this guy is literally the same as those titp women who say , `` i want a tall , strong , masculine bodybuilder to fuck me , but he has to not care about the fact that i 'm 200 pounds overweight , and he 's a misogynistic fat shamer if he does . '', 
  i find it funny that even though i 'm a white , cisgendered male i still end up with with negative privilege because i 'm gay and non-religious in the united states . 
  [ this ] ( http://pollystreaming.com/spongebob-squarepants-season-3-episode-1b-doing-time_v7353 ) particular episode is called `` doing time '', 
  somewhere after midnight , in my wildest fantasies, 
  ~ blushes and winks at you ~ : stop being so kawaii-desu ( \u25d5 \u203f - ), 
  they do indeed exist . 
  well , i dyed my hair red using henna . 
  either she does n't know what the word `` lesbian '' means , or she 's a `` political lesbian . '', 
  the complete disregard for history is really bothersome . 
   not because he was some kumbayain ' negro hippie who believed in turning the other cheek when fascists fucks want to pummel poc back into slavery, 
  uh , that 's ** exactly ** what he believed . 
  maybe they forgot , but mlk was a pastor and had a phd in theology and always stressed the teachings of jesus as part of his activism . 
  i would n't doubt that they do . 
  regardless of how much you hate men , if you 're a heterosexual woman , there 's going to be at least one man that you 're sexually attracted to . 
  bears are n't necessarily big , they 're just hairy . 
  a fat , hairy gay guy is a chub . 
  then there are cubs , which are young bears . 
  there are also lions , which are hairy gay men with blond or red hair . 
  there are also categories depending on race :, 
  black bear -- black guys, 
  polar bear -- white guys, 
  brown bear -- southern asian/middle eastern/latino guys, 
  panda bear -- eastern asian guys, 
  bears can run up to 40 mph for short distances . 
  unless you have a sizable head start , that bear will close the gap in a few seconds flat . 
  depends on what brand you use . 
  i use lush , and it fades a bit for a few days after dyeing it , but then it just stays . 
  to get rid of it i 'd have to cut it off . 
  i do n't know why i always get surprised and/or hurt when black people are criminals . 
  we should just start assuming they all are until proven otherwise . 
  ` #black people #bonquisha, 
  am i doing it right ? 
  i 've just noticed that they never actually explain that , they just stop any sort of discussion , e.g. 
  `` the dictionary is wrong , end of story '',
