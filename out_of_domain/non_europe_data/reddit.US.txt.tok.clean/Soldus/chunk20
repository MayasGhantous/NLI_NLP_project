   i 'm an asshole . 
  i 'm going to claim not to be , and if you call me out on it , you 're the asshole . 
   it really pisses us black trans women off that you give rupaul andre charles ( and tyler perry dressed as madea ) more love and respect than you do the average black transwoman struggling to live their lives and interact with the black cis and sgl communities without major drama . 
  perhaps because they 're well-known entertainers , whereas i 've never heard of you before ? 
  `` actually ... '', 
  representational , not abstract . 
  let 's face it , once these women get up to a certain weight , i 'm sure they just stop caring . 
  it was my privilege, 
  it tastes like pork . 
  the end . 
  where do people say `` further '' and `` farther '' as a homophone ? 
  wow , we 've got 1/100 ,000 ^ th of the wyoming population in this thread !, 
  i could walk naked for miles and miles and never come across another human . 
  i did n't even know my state had a mmj program . 
  is that a chihuasky ? 
  the only hobby that 's non-heteronormative is fucking people of the same sex . 
  but if she went full dj tanner , she would have learned her lesson , that it 's through diet and exercise that you lose weight . 
  i lost 60 lbs last year and i 've still been losing weight . 
  where 's my gold medal ?!, 
  fuck the camarilla , anarchs4lyfe , yo, 
  [ already exists , bro ] ( http://mcphee.com/shop/bacon-toothpaste.html ), 
  in theory , you could make a toothpaste like that by removing sodium lauryl sulfate , but then your toothpaste would n't foam up . 
  that 's not even impressive . 
  with watermelon 's high water content , he 's basically just taking a drink . 
   stop oppressing me !, 
  what did i do ? 
   omfg , it 's not my job to educate you , shitlord, 
  but how can i know what i did wrong if you wo n't tell me ? 
   jesus christ , stop attacking me, 
  wow , you 're getting really upset about this . 
   are you seriously fucking tone-policing me right now ?!, 
  i really do n't know what i did wrong . 
   i ca n't even . 
  i just ca n't . 
  gosh , sorry i asked . 
  american culture is black . 
  but it 's also white , red , yellow , brown , blue , green , turquoise , magenta , chartreuse , aquamarine , indigo , scarlet and ecru , because american culture is not homogeneous . 
  american culture is founded on the cultures of all the groups that live here . 
  it 's the reason why you can go to an african american art museum , a mexican heritage concert and russian high tea all in the same day . 
   i explained to her that the brand took a part of a culture and turn it into something profitable , something that is now mainstream , without acknowledging its people or having any respect for its meaning . 
  because disney did n't do that with the little mermaid . 
  lol , female tearz, 
  it 's a joke . 
  she 's emphasizing the fact that she * is * funny as opposed to the sjws who say , `` i 'm so sweet and funny and personable , why ca n't men see past my tumbling rolls and gaping maw , they 're just asshole fatshamers ! '', 
  yes indeed !, 
  there 's a russian monastery near where i live and they have a restaurant that serves russian food and tea time . 
  that 's what they * should * do , but it more often ends up being :, 
  take a step back . 
  realize it 's just your feelz . 
  call that person out anyway . 
  sexually confused ? 
  you do n't get your sexuality from your parents , otherwise gay people would n't exist . 
  you 're saying nasa faked ** six ** moon landings ? 
  are you retarded ? 
  answer the question . 
  yes or no ? 
  quit making thinly veiled references to the nsa and retroactively applying 2014 technology to 1969 . 
  so if the mother would die from bringing the baby to term , would n't abortion be self-defense ? 
  our medical practices are ** not ** that improved . 
  that 's why we still have maternal mortality rates . 
  and quit referring to a zygote as a `` child . '', 
  calling a clump of cells on the uterine wall a child is like calling an egg yolk a chick . 
  that 's extremely amero-centric . 
  go to japan . 
  now it 's japanese privilege , and shinto privilege . 
  relative to many places on earth , there is female privilege . 
  a woman living in the western world , regardless of ethnicity , sexuality or class is going to have an infinitely better life than a man living sub-saharan africa . 
  `` privilege '' is a relative term for who the majority is in a particular region . 
  teaching is historically men 's work , not women 's . 
  in most of europe , women were n't allowed to be teachers until the 18th century . 
  watchmaker fallacy , bro, 
  i think you should append that to say * date * rape . 
  unless you think someone holding you down and forcibly having sex with you against your will is bullshit . 
  you 're an idiot for making unsupported claims . 
  i have a very loving mother and father and was never abused , yet i turned out gay as a daisy . 
  weird , huh ? 
  pascal 's wager . 
  logically unsound . 
  try again . 
  but ... we do know how the universe was * actually * created . 
  we call this the big bang . 
  that 's the one !, 
  ironically enough , deriving from the french word for cunnilingus . 
  i used to go on vacation to gaylord every year . 
  such a lovely place . 
  hitlr \u2122, 
  for someone in such a sad commercial , she sure has a humorous name . 
   3 ) him saying `` if i were gay , i 'd think hiphop hates me , '' which simultaneously casts hiphop as extra-homophobic , erases lgb rappers , erases black straight rappers who have come out in support of lgb people , implies that he , a straight man , can speak for gay people and knows what we `` think , '' and is him not checking his white privilege in critiquing a black genre ( and making money off of doing so ), 
  * hip hop * is * homophobic , by the very admission of hip hop artists . 
  * name one well-known gay rapper apart from frank ocean and lady sovereign . 
  gosh , think of the ** thousands ** of gay rappers whose experiences are being erased !, 
  * the number of rappers who support lgbt people is few and far between . 
  * he says , `` if i were gay , i 'd think hip hop hates me . '', 
  he did n't say , `` if i were gay , i 'd think hip hop hates me and i know every other gay person agrees with me . '', 
  i did n't realize having an opinion makes you the official spokesperson for that group . 
  * yes , the predominance of rappers are black , i do n't see why that would preclude white people from rapping , however . 
  yes , we should make every piece of clothing to account for the 0.0001 % of men who do n't have penises , or for the 0.00001 % of women who do have penises . 
  did annie happen to be taiwanese ? 
  i only ask because i went to a school with a large chinese population , and i knew a taiwanese girl named annie who was the sweetest person i 'd ever met . 
  i won best actress one time .
