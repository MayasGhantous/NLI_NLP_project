  i 'm a male . 
  i 'm afraid of his loon-gaze . 
  i 'm surprised she is n't one of those people with a litany of self-diagnosed mental disorders like other sjws . 
  this is why i 'm starting to really hate these people . 
  you post this long-ass response , addressing every inane point they make , and the best they can respond with is , `` lol , he should stop being a faggot . '', 
  she says :, 
   `` some native people did n't have a problem with me doing this so all native people must not have a problem with me doing this '', 
  but in reference to her link , she asserts :, 
   `` this one native on tumblr has a problem with you doing this , so all native people must have a problem with you doing this '', 
  pot , meet kettle . 
  but if you use your power to make me do something , could i not also use my power to stop you from making me that something ? 
  if everyone were equally powerful , every little thing would be a power struggle that would just end in an impasse . 
  according to them , it 's not racism when it 's a white person in china , it 's prejudice as a result of white imperialism . 
  so even when white people are the victims , it 's still their fault . 
  yanrouge is n't talking about them , bun is talking about those people who claim genetics is the reason why they 're 600 pounds , but that argument falls through when you look at poor countries that have a ridiculously low obesity rate . 
  if it were genetics , according to them , then even a starving woman in darfur would be obese . 
  i still like bun/buns/bunself the best . 
  but what if the penis was wearing really funny glasses and had clown hair ? 
  b-but ... intersectionality !, 
  you can when you 're a sunkin . 
  which is hilariously ironic . 
  anecdotal evidence about a few white people ? 
  fact about all white people, 
  anecdotal evidence about a few black people ? 
  omgz ur a racist nazi fuck meet a real black person asshole !!, 
  well , when you 're a whorekin , who knows to whom you 've been throwing your lusty wiles . 
  how about being a white male ? 
  that seems like it 'd be a hard job to get unless you already had it . 
   look into my eyes when i stare at you !, 
  they have to * let * you smang them , otherwise it 's rape . 
  a private * de * briefing , huehuehueh, 
  agnosticism ( of greek origin ) : without knowledge, 
  atheism ( also of greek origin ) : a lack of belief or a disbelief in a deity/deities, 
  the contradictions of agnosticism and atheism would be gnosticism and theism , respectively, 
  ken ham is the biggest hypocrite i 've ever seen . 
   you ca n't say something happened , you were n't there to observe it . 
  also , you ca n't say a law of nature is valid in the past just because it 's valid now . 
  really , ken ? 
  you were n't there to observe the flood and noah 's ark , yet you trounce it around like fact . 
  you also say that there 's a uniformity to nature , so would that not imply that the laws of nature have remained the same as bill stated ? 
  i guess the greeks do n't know their own language then . 
  a - , an - , in - , un - , - less ( \u03a4he alpha privative , privative a , alpha privativum , indicating an opposite or lacking sense ) -, 
  knowledge ( knowing ; understanding ), 
  \u03b1\u03b3\u03bd\u03c9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 \u2022 ( agnostik\u00f3s ) from greek \u03ac\u03b3\u03bd\u03c9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 ( agn\u014dstos , `` unknown '' ), 
  and i 'm sure she had lovely birthing hips and a certain corn-fed vigor . 
  she 's for male dominance . 
  if i remember correctly she 's a moderator of / r/redpillwomen, 
  yes , / u/ten _ toothed_decadent has the right of it . 
  the additional e is silent and is just used for gender agreement , this is also the case with plural `` s. '' this is done also with the past tense of verbs , e.g. 
  parl\u00e9 , parl\u00e9e , parl\u00e9s and parl\u00e9es are all pronounced the same . 
  [ all ] ( #b `` so is irri . 
  i 'm wondering how they 're going to reconcile that in the show '' ), 
  the reliquary by monet, 
  fuck you , you shitlord , you 're sitting on my invisible tail !, 
   it also acts to lessen the legitimacy of aave, 
  speaking with poor grammar is considered legitimate now ? 
  charibdis did n't eat your toucan , it * smanged * it . 
  but communism , like so many sjws claim to support , is a white cisgender male thing , too . 
  where are my dragons ( of color ) ? 
  i like that ryangoslingsexual is so large . 
  bitch , how you not a hobbit ? ... oh ... yeah ... oh , right . 
  brb , going to the morgue, 
  ridges and bumps for his pleasure !, 
  yes , the word `` hysteria '' is derived from the greek hustera meaning womb , hence `` hysterectomy . '', 
  that 's the only thing i miss about being fat . 
  i used to be able to walk around in the middle of winter in jeans and a t-shirt and not feel the cold at all , now i have to be wearing slippers and a blanket in my own house to not feel freezing . 
  this is the only appropriate response to give when people pull out the tone policing bullshit . 
  cl4p-tp is the only other character who even holds a candle to tiny tina . 
  lel , verbs and pronouns are the same , shitlord . 
  no , cinderella is a french fairy tale . 
  her name in french is `` cendrillon . '', 
  by that logic , black people * can * be racist assuming they 're the majority , like in detroit . 
  i know how you feel . 
  none of these hot guys want to suck on my dick . 
  but black people are in power in detroit . 
  mike duggan is the first white mayor of detroit since 1974 , and 5 of the 8 city managers are black . 
  they 'll never know :(, 
  i love your writing style . 
  i would read the fuck out of your memoirs . 
  everybody raves about how great a show it is , but i just ca n't get behind it . 
  i 've tried several times to watch it , but it seems every scene just devolves into all the characters shouting , and it 's just too obnoxious for me . 
  is there something i 'm missing here ? 
  have n't you heard ? 
  mlk was actually a staunch militant who hated whitey , an sjw told me so !, 
  why has cis become synonymous with straight ? 
  why are they erasing my cisgay existence ? 
  god , karen , you 're so * stupid !, 
  this is what always bothers me . 
  every civilization that 's ever existed has history . 
  this whole `` every other month but february is white history month '' thing is bullshit . 
  if sjws could pull their heads out of their asses long enough to crack a history book and see that the united states was founded and populated by europeans , they 'd understand why it 's an integral part to its history . 
  on a global scale , white history is pretty insignificant if you take into account the histories of the pre-columbian americas , africa , asia and oceania . 
  are n't these the same people that say that men ca n't be feminists ? 
  i do n't know what that second bun was talking about . 
  louis xiv was on to something . 
  wearing heels , man or woman , makes you feel like a bad bitch . 
  i would think so , too , but apparently it 's not . 
  my friend 's father is/was the band director at my old high school , and my friend played the saxophone , so they put him in his dad 's class . 
  i wear high heels to work even though i do n't have to,
