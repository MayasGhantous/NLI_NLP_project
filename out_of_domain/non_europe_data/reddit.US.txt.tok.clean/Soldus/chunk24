  which is why i 'm opposed to calling this trash exhibit art because i see no real purpose , meaning or intent behind it . 
  sorry , i 'm not listening , i 'm too busy with my privilege . 
  remember guys , bicycles have two wheels * or more * because tricycles do n't exist . 
  i mean ... that guy * is * pretty attractive . 
  you 're being completely disingenuous . 
  the `` armed gangs '' are ukrainian citizens within their right to overthrow their government . 
  the `` armed gangs '' in crimea are the russian military . 
  it 's unacceptable to have a foreign military take hold of sovereign land . 
  it may be the most peaceful option , but it sets a poor precedent for future diplomacy . 
  also , this is the exact same attitude that world powers had towards germany when they took austria and poland . 
  just remember , hitler and mao were both also democratically elected . 
  no , it 's not . 
  i 'm saying that being democratically elected means nothing . 
  as a man , i agree with / u/gibberishword . 
  you 're acting like a petulant child , whining and banging his fists against the floor because he did n't get what he wants . 
  you want something ? 
  go get it . 
  no one is going to get it for you and no one owes you anything . 
  believe it or not , arrogance and entitlement are off putting to most people , so you might want to work on that . 
  heterosexuals were genetically engineered on the isle of patmos , by the evil black scientist yakub and his 59,999 gayniggers from outer space . 
  but really , according to elijah muhammad of the nation of islam , white people were a science experiment gone wrong by a scientist named yakub , and that 's why white people are so evil and rapacious . 
  i think it 's reasonable to assume the noldor ( and by extension the nandor and silvan elves ) would have darker complexions as they 're described as having grey eyes and dark hair . 
  `` vanya '' itself means fair and with people like galadriel , that 's a given ; however , the remaining teleri that did n't depart for tol eress\u00eba were the sindar elves , which includes legolas and thranduil , who are both described as being fair . 
  i love this . 
  it 'll be so interesting to see this subreddit through a tumblr lens !, 
  notice how bun cites other disney princesses ' hair ? 
  notice how aurora 's hair is just large sections with curls ? 
  notice how jasmine and pocahontas ' hair is entirely black , so it 's just an outline ? 
  kida 's hair is the most detailed and * atlantis * was in production for 5 years , while * princess and the frog * was only in production for 3 . 
  that 's what i 'd like to know , too . 
  they all say they 're nonbinary or genderqueer and such . 
  but what the fuck does that mean ? 
  though i 'm sure if you brought it up she 'd find some way to fetter away any inkling of logic . 
  it reminds me of an `` asexual '' sjw who was complaining that people assumed she did n't have any sexual attraction because she was asexual . 
  quiet , neosantanta-chan nobody asked for your tsundere opinion , rokudenashi !, 
  they 're called twunks . 
  this . 
  feminism !, 
  i 'm almost certain her dress is made out of the same material my couch is upholstered with . 
  the artist 's name is dmitriy samohin . 
  if the law is on your side , hammer the books . 
  if logic is on your side , hammer the facts . 
  if neither are on your side , hammer the table . 
  if you scroll down a bit , he says that he 's living in the middle east . 
  how do people make espresso at home ? 
  he says that he is n't arab or muslim and was raised in the west , so i 'm guessing he 's some european living in the middle east for whatever reason . 
  congrats on the engagement . 
  looking at both sides of the story . 
  i think both of you are right , and both of you are wrong , for different reasons , of course , but that 's the case . 
  i think your boyfriend 's fear of coming out to his parents is a serious concern and it 's very selfish of you to push him to do so . 
  especially so if he think his parents may cut him off financially . 
  that being said , it 's unacceptable for him to call you his `` best friend '' to his friends . 
  i would suggest supporting him and gingerly pushing him to openly call you his boyfriend to more and more people . 
  in the end , if he 's not ready to come out to his family then he 's not going to , and forcing him to do so will end up making him resent you . 
  yes , i 've had something similar happen with a friend of mine who wanted to experiment . 
  i do n't really have anything to add because i do n't have very much relationship/desired relationship experience but ... 
  nope , i 've never been hit on outside of the internet . 
  i 'd like to think i 'm an open and friendly person , but maybe i just have some serious brf going on . 
  are these people stupid , or do they not know liza is one of the most common characters for drag queens ? 
  they really should rename it * `` l'esprit de douche '' *, 
  you never win , you just do a little better each time . 
  guys , i was born and raised in michigan , but being a white person , i automatically know what it 's like to be a briton fighting off the roman invasion in the 1st century . 
  i did n't know that either . 
  i do n't know why it upsets me so much , but i find it ridiculous that cheyenne jackson threw away a 13 year relationship only to get engaged to a new guy 6 months later . 
  i 've been talking to a guy on okcupid since november and finally worked up the chops to ask him out and now i have n't heard from him in 2 weeks . 
  yes , your lack of empathy * is * quite pathetic . 
  oh , i forgot , you 're only allowed to be sad if you * literally * have the worst life ever !, 
  are we talking about the same people who baptize dead people ? 
  anon is a light paladin , oppressin ' all dem necromages . 
  i prefer my boyfriends to have penises !, 
   slide 1 : being trans is not a fad !, 
   slide 5 : #transtrender, 
  are those banana republic chinos ? 
  and anyone not living in `` mexico '' or the louisiana purchase has to leave because the rest is all english land . 
  well , if all that land belongs to mexico , then all that mexico belongs to spain . 
  the `` it 's ours '' argument is a bitch , ai n't it ? 
  no peasants ? 
  is this the 14th century ? 
  there are several reasons , but most of them are unfounded and stupid . 
  one of the most common reasons you 'll hear is that the french are rude and snooty , though the people saying that have usually only been to paris if they 've been to france at all . 
  that 's like saying all americans are like people in new york and la. 
  secondly , the french are seen as being cowards because they surrendered in wwi and wwii . 
  this contrasts heavily to the rest of french history where france was seen as one of the most powerful nations in the world , enough so that the french language had as much sway then as english does now . 
  then there 's the stereotype that french people are gay because france is well known for its art , literature , music and cuisine , which by many people 's standards would be considered `` feminine . '', 
  so what about a white woman and a man of color ? 
  are they on equal footing since their oppression equals out at -1 ? 
  is that why the only transwoman of color i can name is janet mock , who i only know about for being a bitch ? 
  wait ... bun unironically says `` diabeetus '' ? 
  shortbus was such a good movie . 
  that 's definitely something i would do as opposed to porn . 
  well , [ here ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2c/namibie_himba_0717a.jpg ) [ are ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/af/himba_girls_photo_by_sascha_grabow.jpg ) [ some ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a0/namibie_himba_0720a.jpg ) [ more ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6f/namibie_himba_0716a.jpg ) [ himba ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/namibie_himba_0718a.jpg ) [ women ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/28/himba_woman_%28namibia%2c_southen_arica%29.jpg ) , so you can make that call . 
  i hope this bitch knows driders only exist when drows offend their goddess lolth . 
  so , in reality , it 's a woman 's fault . 
  m'aiq wants a colovian fur helm ... 
  but i totally agree with you . 
  i always had my male characters wear skirts and dresses while swinging a huge battle axe . 
  so how do you say `` caulk '' ? 
  everyone says i have an accent because i 'm from michigan , but i do n't !, 
  nope , my dad says roof with a short o , but i say it with a long o. i pronounce the a in water like the a in walk . 
  you do n't understand it because it does n't make sense .
