  sjws do n't differentiate between institutional racism interpersonal racism . 
  did you not read what / u/robo94 said ? 
   nato and laser both follow correct english phonetic pronunciations as if they were their own independent words . 
  it does n't matter what the a in nato or the e in laser stand for . 
  they 're pronounced as separate words , not the combined pronunciations of their parts . 
  c is soft before the vowels e and i. 
  it 's hard before the vowels a , o and u and before consonants . 
  regarding the caesar bit , it 's actually improper to pronounce his name with a soft c . in english it 's pronounced as a soft c because it 's a vestigial affectation from the french * c\u00e9sar * ( where it would be pronounced as a soft c ) , but c\u00e6sar in latin , which is the spelling we use , would actually be pronounced as ** kai ** - * sahr * , which is where the german word `` kaiser '' comes from . 
  do you see an h in the word . jpeg ? 
  because i sure as shit do n't . 
  what ? 
  technology is easier to use ?!, 
  what a tragedy !, 
  are you smoking crack or do you just not understand english ? 
  i did n't ask what . jpeg stood for , i asked if there was an h in the word . jpeg . 
  let 's see , there 's a j. . . then a p , followed by e and g. nope , no h there . 
  no , see , you 're not getting it . 
  when it 's your problem and you 're offended , you 're just being overly sensitive . 
  when it 's * my * problem and * i 'm * offended , ** then ** it 's problematic . 
  or it 's pronounced gif , just like gift is pronounced gift , not jift . 
  known also as `` projecting '', 
  from my understanding of sjwnese , this person is a butch woman who wants to be effeminate . 
  i would say he * did * do them specifically for those reasons . 
  homosexuality was recriminalized under stalin in 1933 . 
  stalin frequently targeted prominent jewish figures in soviet society in order to suppress jewish culture ( see [ night of the murdered poets ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/night_of_the_murdered_poets ) and the [ doctors ' plot ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/doctors%27_plot ) ) . 
  lastly , stalin frequently relocated russians to countries in the caucasus to weaken their authority under the guise of creating a stronger russian identity . 
  wait , so according to bun , white people are inferior in every regard ... yet they somehow managed to steal , corrupt , rape and subjugate every other race ? 
  so we 're just disregarding the fact that every illustration by thomas taylor , mary grandpr\u00e9 or any of the other illustrators depicts harry being pale as fuck ? 
  great , hufflepuffs are all friendly metal detectors . 
  because they 're perfectly aware of the fact that they 're racist and sexist , they just do n't want to feel bad about it . 
  no they do n't . 
  they complain about election results when they do n't vote . 
  they put donate buttons on their tumblrs . 
  they sit on their asses and moan . 
  / r/paranormalparamours, 
  it 's the himba tribe of namibia . 
  the mixture they put on their skin and hair is a mixture of animal fat and ochre called `` otjize . '', 
   if you ca n't accept that sometimes your voice is n't the most important in the room , you might need to get over yourself . 
  well , thank fuck * you * said it . 
  well , you sure as shit would n't want the top to be a fish , would you ? 
  english , of course , then french and russian . 
  i 'm proficient in swedish , and by extension , norwegian and danish . 
  she 'd still be considered overweight . 
  she 'd have to be 8 ' 6 '' to hit the high end of the `` normal '' weight range ( meaning a few pounds shy of being overweight ) . 
  institutional racism is never going to go away ; it 's just how humans work . 
  regardless of how many laws or rules are made the majority in a society is always going to have the upper hand . 
  no , you 're muddling the definition of racism to include several different circumstances . 
  racism is dislike , hatred or negative attitude toward another person on the basis of race . 
  that 's it . 
  you 're kidding !, 
  benvolio cabbagepatch ? 
  she obviously does n't understand marxism save for a very , very base definition . 
  her entire response just sounds like a tirade of buzzwords . 
  colonialism , kyriarchy , solidarity ? 
  she does n't know what the fuck she 's talking about and she 's trying to pass it off as an enlightened `` way of the future . '', 
  as a gay guy , where 's all this oppression i 'm supposed to be experiencing daily ? 
  come on , straight people , you 're slipping up !, 
  i love how hypocritical they 're being . 
   white people and men ca n't be sad or depressed because woc in the us have it worse off , and i do n't care if women in the middle east are even worse off because my feels !, 
  and numbers , apparently . 
  so the lesson here is : do n't help others because they 'll try to burn you at the stake . 
  ugh , ca n't have that . 
  i 've got the celiac disease . 
  makes me cronk in my genechtagazoink . 
  that 's a paddlin ', 
  to expand on that that further :, 
  sjw : says something about privilege and oppression, 
  normal person : [ * insert english language here * ], 
  sjw : see how racist , sexist , homophobic and ableist they are !, 
  y' know , lesbians are called homosexuals for a reason ; because they like homosex . 
  a penis going into a vagina is heterosex regardless of the genders of the people involved . 
  white guy leaves a small tip at a chinese restaurant ? 
  murderer !, 
   okay so black people ca n't wear our hair the way it grows out our head, 
  okay, 
   alot of people go to school and get licenses and degrees in order to start and maintain client 's locs !!!, 
   it 's so crazy that i pay my loctitian 80-120 at every appt i have with her , just so she can fucking `` neglect '' my beautiful well groomed and kept hair . 
  wait ... if that 's the way it grows out of your head , why do you need to pay money to have someone maintain it ? 
  what american methods ? 
  i can make rice in the microwave in a few minutes flat . 
  if i know i 'll need a lot of rice i 'll just toss it in the rice cooker , though . 
  when stir frying rice , the rice has to be precooked and is often covered and left to sit for a few hours ( or even overnight ) . 
  if you tossed dry rice into a pan it would just burn . 
  if your friends disprove capitalism , then they 're not ( well-informed ) socialists . 
  the stress in coulis falls on the i , so it 'd be pronounced koo-lee , and by saying it a french accent , you can easily distinguish it in the same way you differentiate raison and raisin . 
  that 's stupid and even further from french . 
  in india lighter skin is associated with some form of wealth and status because northern india is more prosperous and has a lighter skinned population . 
  dravidians from southern india tend to have darker skin and are seen as being poorer and less educated . 
  very true , my assumption is that anyone who uses the term coulis ( over pur\u00e9e ) probably has some background in cooking and , by extension , some background in the french language . 
  i think you mean alsace-lorraine , * schlampe * . 
  yeah , they almost sound like sjws, 
  it 's amazing what lengths these people will go to say `` i 'm an asshole and that 's a * good * thing ! '', 
  pro-life protests and rallies take place on almost all university campuses at one time or another . 
  i 'm as pro-choice as they come but it does n't bother me because , while i disagree with them , they 're not hurting anyone and they 're within their rights . 
  am i reading this correctly ? 
  are they trying to redefine the * law * now ? 
  when it came to racism , whatever , they have their stupid definition that does n't really mean shit , but when they try to redefine laws because it 's not convenient for them , that 's when i get pissed . 
  i 'm neither trans nor a woman , but i would pay a lot of money to look like beyonc\u00e9 . 
  that woman is fucking gorgeous . 
  but taiwan is oppressed by the prc !,
