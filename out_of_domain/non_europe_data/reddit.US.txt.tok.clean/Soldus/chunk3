  i know , i was pissed . 
  i had to read all the articles that day in english , which sucks , because some things like russian singers/actors are specific to the russian pages , with the english pages only being a sentence or two long . 
  for example :, 
  [ english article ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nyusha ), 
  i would definitely consider this scenario as cheating . 
  regardless of whether or not anything happened , there was still the potential , and the ex planned to do it . 
  the only thing that changed , according to your friends , is whether or not those guys that he flirted with said yes or no . 
  i 'm really enjoying this right now . 
  yeah , i have a canvas messenger bag . 
  i use it when i need to carry papers and my laptop . 
  oh my ... well ... i need a moment . 
  i think i was more upset by prim and cinna 's deaths . 
  they do have a surgery for that . 
  well , if you can see the bottom of the penis , it 's fairly easy to tell . 
  you just have to see if the skin on the frenulum is still attached . 
  i can ' really say which i would prefer , as the only penis i 've ever dealt with is my own . 
  ... chocolate, 
  * shame *, 
  charlotte all the way . 
  i think i like jane eyre because oliver twist is one of my favorite books , and they have similar themes in terms of a coming of age for an orphan ; though , one starts off rich ( and miserable ) while the other is poor ( and miserable ) . 
  and that 's why i hate identifying myself as an american , because people always assume i 'm as ignorant as the rest of my country . 
  unfortunately , that generalization is often based in fact . 
  the thing is , the stupidest americans are the ones that shout the loudest . 
  i point you to this video for reference :, 
  ** however ** , note that those are southern americans speaking , of whom the rest of the country is extremely ashamed . 
  not texas . 
  over 30 % of texans believe humans and dinosaurs lived at the same time . 
  i 'd like to quote the texan comedian ron white , `` you ca n't fix stupid . '', 
  there 's definitely a closet joke in there somewhere ... 
  what 's with the `` dat ass '' smile ? 
  purrfectly *, 
  i 'm sorry , i 'll leave now . 
  i do n't care if i am american . 
  i partied hard today . 
  i drank a lot of imported french wine and ate brie ... oh god , so much brie . 
  thats why , like a warm souffl\u00e9 , you have to start off low and slow . 
  hmm ... ca n't tell if stupid christian , or troll atheist . 
  i personally enjoy the one my uncle would always say :, 
  `` rub a dub dub , thanks for the grub . 
  yay god , let 's eat . '', 
  [ just ... just listen to this , then make your decision ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgwgeoaaydy ), 
  you did n't tear the tendons in your wrist , if you know what i mean . 
  it sounds more like the premise for the next es game . 
  i just wanted his outfit ... 
  [ why do n't we have both ? 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nueisqerr1o ), 
  +1 for jennifer lawrence, 
  what the author bio says to me :, 
  `` i have a website and helped write a book . 
  i do n't have a degree in history , psychology or human sexuality , but you should believe me anyway ! '', 
  i think the better question would be , `` what * would n't * she do for a klondike bar ? '', 
  this has to be a joke . 
  i mean ... no food at an ethiopian restaurant ? 
  it just seems to be set up * too * perfectly . 
  [ all over some wings ? 
  [ indubitably ] ( http://www.patexia.com/data/user836/ckeditor/images/lulz.jpg ), 
  i 'd say he should wife you , but it 's a bit late for that . 
  i buy all of my russian books from kniga.com and russlovo.com, 
  i do n't think you need to worry about it . 
  the person i speak to most in french is from algeria , but her pronunciation is n't that different from standard french ( then again , she lived in france for quite a few years ) and has n't really rubbed off on me . 
  well , everyone else got it down , i think i should just mention that if you 're describing an object with an object modifier ( such as un/une/des or mon/ma/mes ) , the subject has to be ** ce ** not il/elle . 
  as everyone has said , both are correct ; however , i believe the first one to be more popular as it follows the usual conjugation of the verb . 
  if i ever have to use an idiomatic expression that exists in english but not french , i use something close . 
  but in your case where nothing similar exists , i just say it in english . 
  if they get it , great . 
  if not , i explain the meaning . 
  wiktionary has audio samples for most words . 
  though , it 's usually only the word in the nominative case for nouns/adjectives ; however , it provides a declension table which is a great help . 
  that 's how it always feels for the first few times . 
  i 've had the exact same feeling before . 
  the uncomfortable feeling , feeling like you have to pee ; however , after a few times , it suddenly feels really good and all those weird , uncomfortable feelings go away . 
  i would n't even worry about it . 
  i never actually writ the ligature , because a french speaker will know what i 'm writing regardless of whether or not the letters are written together . 
  for example , if i write `` coeur '' or `` c\u0153ur '' , a french speaker will know i 'm writing heart . 
  as for \u00e7 , i write a regular c , then i write a vertical line , then add the swoop beneath that , similar to what baloo wrote `` in theory '' , though that 's because i write out the entire word , then go back to add in accents . 
  at least , * at least * he did n't say `` let 's not waist each other 's time . '', 
  i imagine being kicked out of your home as a teenager and being ostracized from your family and friends must suck . 
  but no , you 're right , a joint tax return is the paramount issue for gay americans . 
   i get my share of hate and ridicule , more than an average gay person . 
  really ? 
  so you 've had someone tell you that you do n't deserve to live , that you 're going to burn in hell ? 
  someone has called you an abomination , a pervert , a pedophile ? 
  you 've been threatened with physical violence ? 
  you 've lost your friends and family because you 're christian ? 
  no , you have n't . 
  this happens to lgbt people everyday in the united states . 
  do n't talk to me about hate and ridicule unless you actually know what it is and what it feels like . 
  ah , but you can choose to smoke pot or not . 
  well , i 've heard many christians compare homosexuality to alcoholism and pedophilia . 
  morrowind . 
  any day . 
  every day . 
  i 'm not afraid of spiders , i just hate the fact that they exist . 
  unfortunately for your friends , it 's not a matter of the word marriage , it * is * intrinsically about the rights granted . 
  they same thing they 're proposing is what many christians have suggested , that being a * separate but equal * civil union . 
  however , nine times out of ten , the same rights are n't granted , and it 's not equal . 
  that 's why it 's being fought for , because civil unions * do not * grant equal rights . 
  i see , well you 're describing a religious ceremony , which is completely irrelevant to a civil marriage that is recognized by the government . 
  you can get married in a church , but without a marriage license , the government still sees you as being single . 
  and in some countries , you ca n't even sign the marriage contract at the church you 're getting married at .
