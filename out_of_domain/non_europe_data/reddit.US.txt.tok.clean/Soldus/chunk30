  stop treating * interpersonal * racism as * institutional * racism . 
  i 'm sorry i appropriated all of your paneer : /, 
  i usually hate unusual hair colors , but raven pulls it off really well . 
  as weird as it 's sounds , it 's an actual case of * doublethink * . 
  they hold two contradictory ideas but through mental gymnastics are able to maintain both and act as if it 's logically sound . 
  as some others have explained , he probably just summoned it from somewhere else . 
  hermione explains this when she talks about gamp 's law of elemental transfiguration about food . 
  you can summon the food to you if it already exists , you can make more if you 've already got it , but you ca n't just make it appear out of the air . 
  so you 're the gay edward lewis ? 
  i 'm 20 and have had mine for about a year . 
  guys ' reactions have ranged from neutral curiosity to being really excited about it . 
  regardless , as others have said , get the piercing because you want it and forget about what anyone else thinks . 
  michigander : fourth 'd, 
  nope , you really only need one if you 're really anal ^ ^ ^ heh about being exceptionally clean or if you 're getting into heavy assplay . 
  i 've never used one before and i 've never had a problem . 
  no , if he were anti-gun , he would be saying `` no one should have any guns ever . '', 
  he just supports regulations on who and how one can get a gun . 
  the author of the article is a man , but it does n't make it any less inane . 
  gon na make a spooky halloween scarecrow with all that straw !, 
  lol , fucking aviankin ca n't even speak xer own language properly . 
  yep , same with the swedish varf\u00f6r . 
  i find quiltbag works well for my purposes . 
  and [ here ] ( http://realhistoryww.com/world_history/ancient/misc/vanishing/drawing.jpg ) you can see that they distinguished themselves from other neighboring ethnic groups . 
  sure , they were n't white , but they definitely were n't the dark-skinned africans sjws make them out to be . 
  but she could n't because the tower was draining her power ; she could open portals , but she could n't step into another universe . 
  i 'm not sure where you live , but i 've found a pa can cost anywhere between $ 60 - $ 100 . 
  when i got mine done it cost $ 80 . 
  the process itself is pretty straightforward : the piercer will determine where he wants to place it , and you should ask him to put it a little deep so you have enough to stretch . 
  once he 's found where he wants to put it he 'll insert the receiving tube into your urethra and stretch the skin taut . 
  this can be a bit uncomfortable , but then he 'll quickly do the piercing and you 're done !, 
  there is n't really anything necessary to get ready for it , just make sure your genitals are clean !, 
  you do n't need to shave assuming your pubic hair does n't reach the end of your penis . 
  ppp are pretty common among uncut men and is n't really a concern for you or the piercer . 
  for the third one it would actually be celtic languages , not gaelic languages . 
  gaelic would only include irish , scottish and manx while celtic would include welsh and breton . 
  as / u/vallessir said , it * does * represent brittany ; however , french would be included in the celtic language family due to its ( albeit small ) influence from gaulish . 
  exactly , that 's why i said using celtic would include welsh and breton in addition to the aforementioned goidelic languages . 
  you seem to be forgetting the fact that 70 % of russia is sparsely inhabited tundra . 
  it 's not hard to take over land that no one 's actually living on . 
  despite that russia still sucks at fighting . 
  they cinched a victory over the swedish and the turks but have lost almost every other engagement , i.e. 
  the crimean war , the russo-japanese war , the seven years ' war . 
  as far as napoleon is concerned , they just fled and let winter finish the french off . 
  i was n't talking about a foreign power invading russia , i was talking about russia acquiring all of its land . 
  look at this [ population density map ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/russia's_population_density_by_region.jpg ) . 
  notice all the yellow area east of the urals where the population density is < 2 people/km ^ 2, 
  russia did n't become the largest country on earth due to military prowess , they just claimed largely uninhabited land . 
  it 's pretty shockingly offensive how much you 're misrepresenting his argument . 
  at what point did he say he should expect to be harassed ? 
  he said the way you present yourself informs people 's perception of you and you should n't expect to be beyond reproach just because you 're `` expressing '' yourself . 
  while it might not have had a clinical name , the * italian vice * has had several euphemistic names throughout history and has been documented for thousands of years . 
  the same ca n't be said of demisexuality . 
  that 's the hilarious part . 
  sjws always claim that white people just * love * to kill poc , particularly black people , when all statistics show that an overwhelming majority of murders are intraracial , not interracial . 
  a couple times a year ? 
  shit , it 's more like once every 5 years for me . 
  i also wonder this for ... reasons . 
  the author says it 's perfectly fine to have preferences but it 's not okay to prefer a race ... but what if your preferences are exclusive to a certain race like a certain hair color or eye color ? 
  i 'll give you michael brown , oscar grant and rodney king but :, 
  - gay bars already existed before stonewall, 
  - there 's no king of france because he was captured trying to flee to austria, 
  - technically the united states exists because a bunch of guys got together and signed a piece of paper, 
  i know it gets posted every day in this sub , but it 's so damn relevant :, 
  `` when you tear out a man 's tongue , you are not proving him a liar , you 're only telling the world that you fear what he might say . '', 
  for dates : the person who initiated the date pays, 
  for boyfriends : we alternate who pays, 
  but muh demisexuality !, 
  but people still do eat meat raw . 
  sushi ? 
  steak tartare ? 
  carpaccio ? 
  calm down , snowflake , everyone was bullied to some extent . 
  you forgot the *** racism !!!, 
  it 's not * so * out of left field . 
  the uyghur people of western china are muslim . 
  i 'm going to need to see some sources , otherwise everything you just said is bullshit . 
  male/female are biological sexes . 
  they do n't change with your gender identity . 
  why is this so hard for sjws to understand ? 
   if a grown woman can walk around in an outfit , a girl should be able to wear the exact outfit in school, 
  even if that woman is a hooker ? 
  you 'd be okay with your 14 year old daughter dressing like a hooker ? 
  oh , somebody 's wings are n't strong enough to get them off the ground : /, 
  do you know of potato chips that are n't made from potatoes ? 
  he also cites indonesia , the place with the highest number of muslims in the world . 
  tortilla chips are made of corn , though , not potatoes . 
  \u0421\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442 ( soviet ) means a council . 
  you do n't connect \u044d . 
  like \u0431 , you have to stop and pick up your pen . 
   the black community in the us has historically been more supportive of the lgbt community than the white community has been . 
  quite the opposite , actually . 
  black people in the united states are overwhelmingly religious , particularly southern baptist , and the southern baptist convention ( the largest denomination of baptists in the world ) holds that , [ `` homosexuality is not a ` valid alternative lifestyle . 
  ' '' ] ( http://www.sbc.net/aboutus/positionstatements.asp ) also , in 2008 [ 70 % of black voters voted * for * prop 8 ] ( http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/11/06/ar2008110603880.html ) . 
  it 's this view of homosexuality that drives many black and latino men in america to be `` on the dl . '', 
  there it is . 
  as soon as he started mentioning his boyfriend 's job , laziness and attractiveness i knew it was n't just about not being out . 
  `` you 'll never guess what i found in my sock last night !, 
  go ahead , guess ! '', 
  no its becky, 
  when the levee breaks , mama you 've got to move .
