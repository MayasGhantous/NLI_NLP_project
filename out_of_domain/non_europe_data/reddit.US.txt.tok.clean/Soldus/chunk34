  true , but a cut guy does n't have any folds for bacteria and such to get caught in and missed . 
  my lymph nodes were swollen and i had a really bad sore throat a few weeks ago . 
  i was also freaking out because i thought it might be hiv . 
  i waited a few days and my symptoms cleared up and i tested negative the other week , so it was more than likely some random minor infection . 
  that 's 920 calories . 
   i am still spending opportunity cost to be at work, 
  someone just ~ ~ finished ~ ~ failed econ 101, 
  maybe they meant stephen king ? 
  you do n't understand , i need this coach purse to livvvveee !, 
  probably the fact that the * olympic * did n't actually sink , and 30 people died on the * britannic * , while 1,500 died on the * titanic * . 
  fun fact : that was just the naming convention of the white star line . 
  their rival , the cunard line , often went with latin words for their ships . 
  * lusitania * , * campania * , * aquitania * , and of course , the * carpathia * which was the first ship to arrive to help the * titanic * survivors . 
  the * lusitania * was torpedoed by a german u-boat and sank a few miles off the coast of ireland . 
  this led to a public outcry as the lusitania was a passenger ship , not a battleship . 
  passenger ships were considered off limits for attack , but germany said they would attack any ship flying the british colors . 
  the * campania * sunk after it collided with the * hms glorious * , a royal navy ship . 
  i 've also seen a lot of photos of her photoshopped on stalin 's body . 
  it 's a communist joke , not an asian joke . 
  it also wo n't stay afloat if everyone stops using it . 
  no one 's going to invest in a dead website . 
  likewise , poc only means black people . 
  that 's the reason why asians and latinos are on a roulette wheel of `` coloredness . '', 
  they 're poc when they can be used to prove a point , but suddenly they 're `` privileged '' and derailing the discussion when their problems are brought up . 
  that 's called projection . 
  i make about a $ 1.20 over minimum wage , free drinks 30 minutes before , all during your shift , and 30 minutes after ( though we really just treat it as free drinks all day if you worked that day ) . 
  a free food item a day and a mark out of a pound of coffee or tea each week . 
  tipped out weekly . 
  baristas have anywhere between 20-35 hours a week . 
  shifts and sm have 30-40 . 
  house customer : could i get extra caramel ? 
  at least they 're conscious of it , then you look at the mods of titp and realize they 're all in total denial . 
  to be part of the working class you have to actually work , dumbass . 
   you do n't get rich writing science fiction . 
  if you want to get rich , you start a religion . 
  - l. ron hubbard, 
  true , but the ancient romans have n't been around for about 1,600 years . 
  these bastards are still doing it . 
  i know , dany is an unlikeable character on the show because the writers wrote her that way , she 's much different in the books . 
  [ adwd ] ( #b `` her nephew aegon has a stronger claim than her '' ), 
  really ? 
  we have trash cans everywhere . 
  two in the condiment bar , one by the bathroom , one near the bar , and two on the patio . 
  i do n't mind making them , it just becomes a hassle when i 've got 8 of them in queue and the customers start to get angry because it 's taking so long . 
  i actually had the opposite problem with my nipples . 
  they were pierced with straight barbels , but they became swollen and were always leaking pus and would n't heal , then i switched to cbrs and they got better overnight . 
  we 'll only make a drink extra hot unless you explicitly say `` extra hot . '', 
  and you have no idea how many times i 've made hot lattes , chais , and caramel macchiatos and had a customer stare at me and say `` i wanted that iced . '', 
  i do n't know . 
  i talked with my sm on the phone for a few minutes to set up the interview , which was two days later , then offered me the job on the spot . 
  [ recurring theme ] ( http://www.moneyandshit.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/lady-without-pants.jpg ), 
  it 's a case of doublethink ; they 're strong and independent , yet weak and under the yoke of the patriarchy . 
  it 's understandable to a certain extent , they claim to be indomitable so they feel they have a purpose , but they say they 're oppressed by this seemingly omnipresent monolith so they have something to direct their hate towards , their `` two minutes hate '' if you will . 
  i agree with you , but it 's a bit annoying that you 're taxed $ 0.50 / hr for a bonus . 
  exactly !, 
  it 's my special little pocket money that i use for gas or beer . 
  * post-teenager ? 
  * motherfucker has * gray * hair , time to start paying your own rent . 
  yas gawd , i do n't stand in front of a mirror for 2 hours beating this mug to be compared to some naked dude getting covered with rocks . 
  reminds me of more performance art where a girl was crying while holding a bowl of milk . 
  who cares ? 
  they 're there to look pretty , not fit a quota . 
  security cameras , bro . 
  if you roughly know the time it happened your sm can get the footage to corroborate what you said . 
  haha , i was wondering if anyone would notice . 
  i could n't find my lip liner so i tried to freehand it ; you can see how well that turned out . 
  i do n't know if it will help you at all , but the actual style of the shoe is a `` mary jane '' heel . 
  why does helen keller only masturbate with one hand ? 
  she moans with the other, 
  how come helen keller did n't scream when she fell off the cliff ? 
  she was wearing mittens, 
  i feel like at some point we should be allowed to say no . 
  like right here . 
  after 40 pumps the tea is just there for color . 
  the fuck ? 
  your steaming wand should be spotless each time you use it . 
  i saw it . 
  yes . 
  no , as a proud poc , he should only speak and teach spanish !, 
  or when you have to lock your bedroom door at night so your brother does n't take money out of your wallet or steal your car at 2 in the morning . 
  because it 's a valid point , what does he , a programmer , know about the development of english pronunciation ? 
  jif makes it sound like you 're talking about peanut butter . 
  gif sounds like you 're saying gift but leaving the t off . 
  the `` correct '' pronunciation of words is entirely dictated by the most common usage . 
  no one says `` k-eye-sarh '' when they say `` caesar , '' they say `` see-zer '' despite the former being the proper latin pronunciation of his name . 
  so from a purely objective standpoint , if 51 % of people pronounced your name the `` wrong '' way , they 'd still technically be correct . 
  gill gives gilt gizzard gifts to the git gimp . 
  and cars , and planes , and printed books , and lights , and microphones , and ceiling fans , and sewing machines , and refrigerators , and microwaves . 
  sooo ... even when it 's not about poc , it 's about poc ? 
  damn , i 'd erase your debt . 
  unlikely , doran will go out of his way to avoid conflict ; he 's not likely to lie and scheme . 
  i 'll give you that one , i should amend my statement to say that doran is n't reactionary and does n't act brashly , if he 's going to lie and scheme , it 's going to be thought out and for the long-game . 
  that 's what i 'd like to know !, 
  do n't bring lana into this !, 
  \u0427\u0442\u043e\u0431\u044b would never be used in those cases , though . 
  it would only mean `` to '' in the sense of `` in order to . '', 
  in the case of a statement like '' \u044f \u0445\u043e\u0447\u0443 \u0442\u0435\u0431\u0435 \u0433\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0442\u044c , '' the `` to '' is implied . 
  oh my god , is that just a thing ? 
  we have a customer that gets a venti gtf , 6 matcha , 1 cr\u00e8me base , venti and grande scoop of ice , soy , double blended . 
  you could build a house with that glue .
