  i do n't know about 6 '' , but we have our sani buckets on little wire stands like [ this ] ( http://www.usascientific.com/productimages/equipment/lg/74001131-stackable-wire-rack-lg.jpg ) . 
  depends on the week and the time of year , but we 're a midvolume caf\u00e9 and we usually make around $ 1 - $ 1.50 / hr . 
  hey , body double , this is what the dragonborn looks likes . 
  oh , also , it 's the same dragonborn the entire country has been talking about . 
  you might still be able to retrieve it . 
  most sinks have a u-bend [ like this ] ( http://cdn.instructables.com/fnl/jp96/g1zgouhy/fnljp96g1zgouhy.large.jpg ) . 
  if you unscrew it ( careful , it 'll be full of water ) , your ball might still be in there . 
  it happened when i dropped a ball from my nipple barbell down the drain and i fished it right back out . 
  edit : whoops , just read that it went down the shower drain . 
  yeah , you 'll have to buy a new ball . 
  + / u/user _ simulator / u/soldus, 
  no , it 's because of what 's being put into them . 
  even if you make them with perfect proportions , a vbf will always be a bit thicker while a crf will be thinner , because you 're adding more solids/liquids to the mix . 
  in his own personal writings lenin said he did n't want stalin to succeed him or rise to any power . 
  he tried to distance himself from stalin before his death , but stalin managed to garner enough support ( and assassinate trotsky ) to solidify his power . 
  obviously it 's [ elephant hitler ] ( https://drawception.com/pub/panels/2012/5-8/ynbxmdhm1y-8.png ) . 
  nope , he went on hajj to mecca and saw muslims from all over the world ( including white ones ) and they were happy . 
  he realized hating and advocating for violence toward white people was n't going to help the struggle for black americans , so he began advocating peace like mlk , but the noi was a radical group and did n't want someone with so much influence in their group to be going against their ideology , so they had him assassinated . 
  the mormons are relatively harmless , i 'd compare it more to the wbc . 
  i do something similar . 
  i use about ~ 2.5 tablespoons for 12oz , then drink half of it hot , then add milk and ice . 
  why not just cut out the middle man and pour the sugar straight down your throat ? 
  but that 's a situation he put himself in , much like someone dancing on the freeway , that he was n't forced into . 
  when you 're intentionally putting yourself in a dangerous situation , you 're lucky if you survive , you 're not unlucky if you die . 
  afc, 
  it 's hara-kiri in the united states as well ; the poster is just spelled wrong .

  simple melody , simple vocals , and a perfect way to express your feelings . 
  camerooooon !, 
  i did n't know what to get you this year , so i got you this box ... of white privilege . 
  you know , i wonder if i have fucked up taste buds ; several of my coworkers say they like the vietnam too , but i ca n't stand it , it 's so acidic it 's like drinking a glass of orange juice . 
  or just add `` and '', 
  i love that . 
  `` sure , we say white people are all ugly , mentally unstable racist sheep-shaggers who ca n't cook or dance , but it 's only because it 's a * fact * ! '', 
  a requirement for quite a few people . 
  [ here 's a map ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cd/map3.10requireddresscodesforwomen_compressed.jpg ) outlining the practice in the arab world . 
  it is , you can fuck all the 16 year olds you want , but you ca n't take pictures of them . 
  that 's why there 's always that notice at the beginning of porn that says `` all models depicted were 18 years or older at the time of filming . '', 
  i feel really uncomfortable for her . 
  funny that she uses a gif of beyonc\u00e9 , who most likely exclusively wears weaves and lace fronts . 
  veranda as espresso ? 
  i guess if you want a demitasse of acid ... 
  i 'm not sure about your location , but white mocha does have dairy in it . 
  clearly i ca n't read . 
  you said `` to clap slowly '', 
  keep on grinding that axe , sweetheart . 
  i do n't know what i 'm more disgusted by : that picture or the fact that these people are calling it `` beautiful . '', 
  asking the important questions . 
  because i do n't hate men , but i have to explain why it 's * totally * okay to do so . 
  * i * do n't , like , seriously i * do n't * . 
  but you 're probably a woman-murderer if you say it 's wrong , but it 's okay , even if i do n't . 
  i do n't , i swear . 
  yeah , but ( rape culture ( \u221e ) ) = jokes + \u222b opression ^ * n * +1 / rpa, 
  where rpa is * rapes per annum * and * n * = normalization of rape, 
  i got you a stocking full of empty promises !, 
  as you can see , rape culture is multiplied by an infinite number , so the jokes and oppression do n't really make a difference because rape culture never stops , rape culture never slows down , you 're just along for the ride staying just above 50mph . 
  forced labor is still slavery regardless of how hard the work actually is or not or if your owner helps . 
  jesus actually would n't have been palestinian ( or philistine ) , as philistia was a region that was encapsulated by 5 cities around the dead sea . 
  assuming the bible is correct in that he was born in bethlehem , then he would have been born in judea . 
  [ here 's ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c7/first_century_iudaea_province.gif ) a map showing the regions at the time . 
  philistia is the province to the southwest, 
  no , you do n't get to call someone out , then get pissy and refuse to support yourself when they ask for an explanation . 
  is it even possible to tear down that system ? 
  white privilege is majority privilege , plain and simple . 
  likewise , an amhara person would be privileged in ethiopia and a jewish person in israel just by virtue of having the majority of people around them be like them . 
  the only way to stop that is if there 's no ethnic/racial/religious / etc. 
  majority or plurality in any country . 
  whites have lost most of their power in south africa ; they still have economic power , but as / u/perpetualjoke stated , they 're currently under genocide watch due to persecution . 
  out of curiosity , how did you do that ? 
  did you do it independently or through a university ? 
  god damn mongorians alway tear down my shitty wall !, 
  she is part of a social group !, 
  the ladies who lunch , and lunch , and lunch ... and before dinner snack , and appetizer , and dinner , and dessert , and post dinner snack , and before bed snack , and midnight snack , and i had to get up and go to the bathroom at 2am so might as well have another snack snack society . 
  so it 's not against dress code ? 
  i have a solid black kilt and i asked my sm if i could wear it , but she said she was n't sure so she would find out but never got back to me . 
   for the rest of us who are busy having consensual sex , there 's no reason to worry about this shift in standards at all . 
  is it even possible to trot out the `` if you 're not doing anything wrong you have nothing to fear '' line unironically anymore ? 
  yes , it absolutely does , shitlord !, 
  if you include it , you support it . 
  just like the writers of game of thrones clearly support rape and are probably rapists themselves . 
  i have no proof of that , but i 'm probably right , so who cares ? 
  really ? 
  you think someone 's going to tell the entire world something that some people never tell , and go through various surgeries all as a publicity stunt ? 
  he 'd appreciate the effort , but he 'd see pretty quickly that they 're misguided . 
  he advocated unity and turning your enemies into your friends , not this decisive bullshit that just serves to make people hate each other more . 
  and it 's funny because a lot of the terms that they say white people ca n't say ( hunty/henney , yas gawd , okurrr , house down , etc. ), 
  are terms that originated in the drag community ( which includes white queens ) . 
  not much , in actuality . 
  sjws like to trot out the idea that europeans came to rape and subsequently murder the entire native population , but the truth is that 90 % -95 % of natives were killed by smallpox and other diseases . 
  they of course had no resistances to it , so it stampeded through their populations like a buffalo . 
  or the civil war is n't relating to the title . 
  if it were a tyranny war or lowering crown authority , i do n't think the cb would be valid . 
  it 's hilarious , she 's a black lesbian , but they hate her because she does n't buy into their bullshit , especially after the `` i 'm not african-american , i 'm american '' thing . 
  oh , silly , a latte is what you call the air in the cup !, 
  should have added rum to make a mojito . 
  i do n't understand her reasoning , did she think she would get a shot for free just because she wanted it on the side ? 
  it refers to the microfoam , which wo n't be as thick and will lay `` flatter '' as opposed to the fluffy foam of a cappuccino . 
  that 's a huge misunderstanding people have . 
  sriracha is just a very popular chili sauce from thailand , like ketchup or salsa here . 
  the `` rooster sauce '' that everyone thinks of when we say sriracha is the product made by huy fong foods .
