  `` spic and span cleaning service : * we want more lemon pledge * '', 
  i 'm so happy this is a thing . 
  goats produce a * type * of wool : cashmere . 
  do you want them to just grind up some green beans and throw them in some hot water ? 
  would that make you happy ? 
  here 's a simple guide, 
  ** roasts **, 
  light roast ( blonde ) : softer flavors , can detect the `` origin tastes , '' generally more acidic, 
  medium roast : still some origin tastes in addition to the `` coffee flavor . '', 
  a nice balance between robustness and acidity . 
  dark roast : origin tastes usually gone , heavy coffee flavor , usually low acidity . 
  ** continents **, 
  south/central america : coffees usually taste of nuts , chocolate , bananas , occasionally citrusy, 
  africa : generally fruity , floral , juicy , and citrusy, 
  southeast asia : earthy and rich , spicy, 
  so , if you know the roast and origin you can usually tell how the coffee will taste . 
  can confirm , am starbucks partner . 
  our hot chocolate is made with our mocha , which is dark chocolate , which we add vanilla to to soften it a bit . 
  the funny thing is that the chai concentrate you can buy at the grocery store is different than the chai used in stores . 
  they intentionally made them taste different so that you would * have * to go to starbucks to get the real starbucks taste . 
  we have a customer like that . 
  she gets a mf , nonfat , 3\u00a01/2 frap roast , a grande scoop and half a smoothie scoop of ice , 1\u00a01/4 coffee base , 1\u00a01/2 mocha and triple blended . 
  she then wants you to pile up her cementaccino with a spoon above the line then add `` light whip and mocha drizzle . '', 
  she probably imagines she 's living in the 17th century where she 's forbidden to have a job or an education . 
  this is a typical thing and has happened to me . 
  the swelling and white and yellow stuff is lymph from your body healing and will go away eventually , just keep up with your cleaning and you 'll be good . 
   if you 're able to defend the violent members of your group without worrying about being seen as dangerous , you 're clearly not oppressed . 
  then i guess men are oppressed , since they 're all rapacious murderers according to tumblr . 
  because it has the word `` negro '' in it . 
  circumcised guy here , never use lube . 
  that 's budai , not the buddha . 
  if you have to say `` the sociological definition '' instead of just `` the definition , '' then you should automatically know you 're full of shit . 
  well , look at if from the boyfriend 's perspective . 
  would you be hunky dory if you had to sit on the sidelines watching your boyfriend fall for someone else ? 
  and then on your boyfriend 's deathbed having him ask for that same person ? 
  no , he wants to fuck dem sweet sweet stamens . 
  people celebrate christmas in india too even though christians are a very small percentage of their population .

  every figure in history is a piece of shit , but that does n't mean that needs to be attached to every mention of their name . 
  gandhi helped liberate india through nonviolent protest *, 
  martin luther king jr. was a leader of the civil rights movement and brought about change for equality **, 
  mother teresa set up charities and hospices all over the world and has helped innumerable people ***, 
  nelson mandela lead the movement against apartheid and became the first black president of south africa ****, 
  * he was terrible to and cheated on his wife . 
  ** he also cheated on his wife . 
  *** she believed healing came through suffering and did n't allow anesthesia in her hospitals , yet got treatment ( with anesthesia ) in france . 
  **** he was part of a terrorist organization that regularly bombed and executed civilians . 
  yeah , but that 's * different * . 
  wow , is that some * victim blaming * i 'm hearing ? 
  knowing tumblr , it may very well be . 
  their analogy boils down to `` imagine if instead of being opposed to all discrimination as they are , they were only opposed to the discrimination we oppose , and support the discrimination we like ! '', 
  no , it 's different !!!, 
  misandry jokes are funny , haha !, 
  misogyny jokes * literally * contribute to the murder of women everywhere !, 
  someone got a thesaurus with xer women 's studies degree . 
  steal ? 
  how do you steal a word ? 
  it 's not a physical object that can be picked up and hauled off , nor is a white/straight/rich person using that word stopping you from using it . 
  do you think i 'd get upset if a straight person came up to me and said , `` yaas mawma werk , get your life to the gods the house down boots and twerk '' ? 
  no , your only options are a ) be black and agree with tumblr b ) be white, 
  it 's pretty popular in south korea just from american influence . 
  nasim pedrad was on snl for 5 years .

  a quick glance at the comments section of any article on iggy azalea is enough to prove that point . 
  not my character , but she was the duchess of flanders . 
  she did n't have any special traits or anything , so i assume it was a glitch , but she lived to be 114 . 
  it 's grammatically correct to use `` borrow '' with an indirect object to mean `` lend . '', 
  there 's two different types of macchiatos . 
  espresso macchiato ( marked espresso ) , where the espresso is `` marked '' with a bit of milk foam . 
  then there 's a latte macchiato ( marked milk ) , where steamed milk is marked with shots of espresso . 
  what do they think kfc stands for ?

  yikes , might as well use a paper clip . 
  they 're not using aluminum because of the weight , they 're using aluminum because it 's cheap .

  just so you know , the city of detroit itself only has a population of 700,000 . 
  the areas around detroit can be very different . 
  but you 're implying that the metropolitan area is as bad as detroit , despite the metropolitan area having one of the richest counties in the country . 
  so then you 're proving my point . 
  the city , city , of detroit is bad , the metropolitan area is not . 
  so it 's bad for 700,000 michiganders , not the other 9,150,000 michiganders .
