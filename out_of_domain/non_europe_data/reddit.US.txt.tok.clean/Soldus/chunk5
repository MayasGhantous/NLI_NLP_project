  i run around in bow ties , but that 's just because i like formal attire but find bow ties more fun than neckties . 
  so let me get this straight , you had respect ? 
  you should n't have taken that risk \u2122 \u00a9, 
  but that is considered ** very ** bad english . 
  it saddens me that most phones have a keyboard with a specific key for each letter , yet everyone refuses to use them . 
  it 's even more disheartening when it occurs on the internet , where someone has a full , physical keyboard at his disposal , yet stll rites lik dis . 
  i could date a vegetarian as long as he does n't try and proselytize me into being a vegetarian . 
  vegans , on the other hand , would be impossible for me . 
  i have quite a few vegan friends and it just seems agonizing . 
  every time we go out to eat they always have to order really bland/unappetizing things because there 's nothing vegan on the menu . 
  i occasionally make vegan food , though that 's usually just because it 's a recipe i like that happens to have no animal byproducts , but for the most part i make meals including things like milk , eggs , etc. 
  yep , my straight friend wanted to experiment ... let 's just say he did n't want to do it just once . 
  i was always taught that if it is n't a b.a.n.g.s adjective ( beauty , age , number , goodness and size ) , and it comes after the modified noun , it is a literal meaning , while when it precedes the noun , it can be taken to a more figurative meaning . 
  for example :, 
  un prof ancien ( an ancient/elderly teacher ), 
  un ancien prof ( a former teacher ), 
  i 've been taking french for five years , though i think i developed fluency after about three . 
  i could find you , or you could find me . 
  if you ever see a young man walking down the street in royal oak smoking cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e tobacco out of a long-stemmed briarwood pipe , make sure to wave . 
  so are you . 
  oh , god , i 'm so sorry . 
  i do n't know why i thought that ... i feel really ashamed now . 
  weird ... our largest ethnic groups here in michigan are germans , poles and dutch . 
  that last one . . uh ... is n't always a bad thing . 
  `` i 'm going to make you forget everything ! '', 
  no one ever said ** all ** gay men were intelligent . 
  skyrim is really fantastic for this . 
  not only do they have a translation for french , but the entire game dialogue in french , as well . 
  furthermore , there are separate actors for different characters , whereas many games have one actor doing the voices for every male or every female character . 
  i would n't know , i play on ps3 . 
  i 'm not sure if there 's an option for xbox , though i 'm fairly certain you can install it on pc in french . 
  oh , yes . 
  you simply go into the system settings , then the system language . 
  i switch it from english to french , and skyrim is then in french . 
  normally you 'd be correct ; however , in this phrase , there 's a liaison between `` en '' and `` un '' , leading to a slightly different pronunciation between `` en '' and `` an . '', 
  does it matter ? 
  they were n't real cities to begin with . 
  i prefer the boy next door type of guy . 
  not muscled or anything like that , just that average body type with a cute face and soft hair . 
  not mine , but my parents ' . 
  my father had gone on a camping trip with my mother and some of her friends that included canoeing long distances . 
  the group decides to take a break by the side of the river and my mom goes off into the forest to pee behind a tree . 
  my dad came up behind her and got down on one knee and proposed to her mid-piss . 
  twenty years later and they 're still going strong . 
  do n't we all ? 
  she could be right , though by then , we 'd probably be on the iphone 3,435,342 with a ** bigger screen ** and ** even higher definition **, 
  well , at one point , it was . 
  i think they 're claiming to be of irish ancestry . 
  d\u00e9ranger : to bother, 
  `` sorry to bother you . '', 
  just be glad your second toe is n't longer than your big toe . 
  know , you got it the first thyme . 
  ftfy, 
  each dream is a separate reality , as such , the laws of one dream would n't apply to any subsequent dream . 
  most guys i know do n't shave , but rather trim to keep it neat , and i completely agree with it . 
  if i 'm giving a guy a blowjob i do n't want to spend half the time pulling pubes out of my mouth . 
  edit : i just want to add ; i do n't think body hair should really be an indicator for one 's manliness . 
  stop it , that 's not turkish . 
  i can snap without using my thumb . 
  i can also snap all of my fingers simultaneously . 
  that `` german '' font has always annoyed the hell out of me . 
  it always takes me eons to read a german newspaper for that reason . 
  i know , my grandfather has a bunch of them that i used to read to practice my german . 
  no , he changed his name to `` eddard , '' became a lord , then died . 
  as a current university acting major , be a broadway actress . 
  you 'll get paid out the nose for doing something that 's so incredibly fun . 
  you will have to work hard and long , but it 's so worth it in the end . 
  it sounds like * you 're * the one with an ax to grind . 
  i agree with you 100 % , and when you say `` gun control , '' so many people automatically assume you want to take their guns away and make them illegal to own . 
  whisper, 
  fetch, 
  are you actually native ? 
  french hooker, 
  for the bit about william shakespeare -- it actually was n't all the uncommon during the elizabethan/jacobean period to have several different spellings of one 's name . 
  katharine of aragon , for example , spelled her own name as `` katharine , '' `` katharina , '' `` katherine '' and `` katherina . '', 
  mary i called her `` kateryn '' in her will . 
  as wikipedia puts it :, 
   rarely were names , particularly first names , written in an exact manner during the sixteenth century . 
  `` a dolla make me wan na holla '', 
  then on the reverse side :, 
  `` wan na see what $ 5 make me wan na do ? 
  maybel8er is n't saying that a 21 year old can guarantee that he 'll still be alive in 10 years , he 's making the point that this man will be 77 in ten years and his likelihood of dying from an age-related illness are greatly increased and that the op should be aware of that if he wants to pursue a relationship with him . 
  i 've always have a problem with pitbulls ever since i was a kid . 
  my neighbor had them and they would always bark and howl ; one day one of them bit his son and left a long gash across his brow which left a nasty scar . 
  also , the fact that the dogs were specifically bred for fighting makes me a bit wary of them . 
  recover in terms of what ? 
  relative to population , it probably would n't take that long . 
  the world population in 1900 was 1.6 billion ; by 2011 it was 7 billion . 
  i 'd agree with you if i did n't hate humanity so much . 
  i 'd rather have a pig or chicken who was friendly than have an annoying , whiny infant . 
  pit bulls should be wiped out as a breed . 
  the cdc reports that from 1979-1998 there were 238 dog bite related fatalities in the united states . 
  among the pure bred group the highest number of deaths , 66 , were attributed to pit bulls with the next highest being rottweilers at 39 deaths .
