  i always wondered about folsom ... 
  disregard that entirely . 
  for whatever reason , central and south americans are upset that citizens of the united states call themselves american . 
  just use * am\u00e9ricain * , and you wo n't have any problem . 
  it is n't logically consistent , though . 
  `` we believe that everyone has the right to life , unless you disagree with us , then we kill you . '', 
  well , if your blue is my red , then one of us has an eye disorder . 
  it does , actually . 
  she claims that fire can not kill a dragon , and it 's shown several times that extreme heat does n't affect her , long before she meets mirri maz duur . 
  can someone explain to me why her name was changed to yara/jara in the series ? 
  i think he actually mean fat-jacked , that he 's fat , but he 's got muscle beneath it . 
  no , he does n't . 
  he says that he only kept one , and he gave all the other obsidian blades/arrowheads away . 
  it seems to be that there can only be one dragon at a time , as evidenced by viserys . 
  sorry , i have n't read a dance with dragons yet because i want to buy it in paperback to match the first four . 
  it 's the opposite for me . 
  `` jif '' does n't hit the ear right ; when i hear it , i think people are talking about peanut butter . 
  wait , what ? 
  i 've lived in/around detroit for 18 years and i 've never seen a juggalo . 
  umm ... i think `` increible '' is spanish . 
  incredible in french is `` incroyable . '', 
  do you expect him not to be ? 
  everyone has a bias . 
  maybe you were just an asshole first . 
  the title says it all . 
  this was n't one isolated incident , that has been on-going for years . 
  so what would you have had him do ? 
  tell that to all of the gay people who have committed suicide because of `` name calling . '', 
  i 'm sorry , but that 's bullshit . 
  i know the cousin 's type , and regardless of what the op tried to do , he would n't have stopped . 
  ignoring him would n't have helped , going to another family member would have been just as useless . 
  the cousin sees the op as a weak target , someone he can abuse without repercussion . 
  the only way for it to stop is to show the cousin that op is not weak , and is not someone to be trifled with . 
  no , no , no , no !, 
  talking to the cousin 's parents would have done * nothing * . 
  the cousin acts that way because of his parents , so they probably share the sentiment . 
  you really do n't understand , do you ? 
  in my experience , anyone who uses the term `` fag '' is not someone who can be reasoned with . 
  words mean nothing to that person . 
  it does n't matter how many times you tell them off , or how many times they 're reprimanded by an authority figure . 
  the only way to stop this type of person is to show them that you are no longer a victim that they can patronize at will . 
  you 're right , i do n't know him , yet i 've found in every case that those who are anti-gay , homophobic , anti-gay marriage , whatever , are often illogical people and willingly reject facts so that they can hold on to their bias . 
  i have a feeling that had he taken legal action against his cousin he would have been ostracized by his family and would have been the bad guy in the sense of , `` how could you call the police on him , he 's family ?! '', 
  and apparently , his family applauded him decking his cousin in the mouth . 
  if his family ( probably including the cousin 's parents ) do n't have any objection , then i do n't see a problem with him being put in his place . 
  wishing accomplishes nothing . 
  things only happen by someone * doing * something . 
  on an unrelated note , might i ask why you 're opposed to homosexuality ? 
  so ... do redpillers just not get sarcasm or ... ? 
  the sad but true fact is that there are several uncircumcised men out there who do n't have good hygienic practices and * are * cheese factories . 
  i ca n't tell who 's more annoying in this thread . 
  the people who call circumcision `` barbaric mutilation '' or the people who are calling those people assholes . 
  i was dating this guy who i had met through a mutual friend and one day he texts me asking , `` do you want to have an open relationship ? '', 
  and i asked , `` what would that entail ? '', 
  he told me that we could fool around with other guys , but that we would still be in a relationship . 
  i asked him why he would even consider that . 
  he said there were a few guys he was fooling around with before he met me and missed it . 
  i told him that i really was n't comfortable with that , but he said that it was okay because it would be purely physical with all those other guys , and only emotional with me . 
  he did n't bring it up again , but then i get another text about a week later that said something along the lines of , `` how would you feel if we broke up ? '', 
  i asked him if that meant that he wanted to break up . 
  he said no , but a few hours later he texts me , `` i think we should break up . 
  i ca n't be in a relationship right now because i really need to focus on my studies and i 'm tired of lying to my mom about you ( he was in the closet , and apparently i was listed in his phone under a girl 's name ) . '', 
  that was n't really the worst part . 
  the worst part was that 4 days later he was dating my girl friend who had set us up in the first place in an effort to be heterosexual . 
  he wanted to know if we could be friends , but i gave him a resounding no . 
  my `` friend '' then called me a heartless , immature bitch because i did n't want to have either of them in my life anymore . 
  ** tl ; dr ** : boyfriend dumps me in a text message , then dates my female friend to try and be straight . 
  because an average asian only weighs around 20-35 pounds . 
   you americans eat so much , no wonder -, 
  `` holocaust '', 
  no , not even slightly . 
  so they basically admit that they 're misogynistic , right-wing racists ? 
  funny , they usually spend most of their time denying it . 
  most white people do n't use lotion that often because we do n't get very noticeably ashy . 
  i probably get an equivalent number of messages in four months . 
  fuck the midwest . 
  he 's smart enough to understand quantum physics , yet does n't know how to use a gerund . 
  go ahead , make fun of his kilt . 
  you were n't asked what the law says , you were asked :, 
   do * you * ** believe ** marriage is automatic , irrevocable consent ? 
  * you * are being asked about your personal opinion . 
  stop dodging the question and answer it . 
  there is n't really any way to force that ; you just have to let it happen . 
  when i first started learning french , i did the same thing , always translating anything i read , but i kept practicing my french until it basically became second nature . 
  as one tip , try thinking in french . 
  any time you would normally think in english , just do that in french . 
  i speak french and russian fluently , then i 've got a pretty good hold on swedish . 
  my german and arabic are conversational and my hebrew and korean are elementary . 
  this thread made me really sad . 
  there are guys here who 've slept with almost 300 people , meanwhile i ca n't even get one guy to have sex with me . 
  i 'm just going to sit in my corner and stare scornfully at everyone . 
  the irony is palpable ; you criticize me for setting up a strawman in your first paragraph , then you make a series of strawmen yourself in the second . 
  all of the questions in your second paragraph are unfounded , ludicrous , inflammatory and irrelevant to the point at hand and you know it . 
  as to the first question : it does n't matter , but i want to know . 
  but these are children who are under the supervision of their teachers , who fall under the jurisdiction of the school itself . 
  if someone gets hurt at school , the school is liable for it . 
  what really disturbs me is that someone said :, 
   even if you 've personally been raped its okay to still have a sense of humor . 
  haha , guys , remember that time i was raped ? 
  so funny , right !,
