  but ford created a method of efficiently mass producing vehicles , effectively `` creating '' the automobile . 
  they do , though . 
  when harry and dudley are attacked by the dementors , he casts a patronus charm and he receives an owl telling him that he was expelled for casting it . 
  the ministry knew exactly who and what spell was cast . 
  i read that children were allowed to use the `` lumos '' charm because it could easily appear as a flashlight , which would n't arouse suspicion . 
  i answered this question to someone else earlier : the ministry allows students to use lumos outside of school because it could just look like a flashlight from a distance . 
  does chick-fil-a even serve beef products ? 
  i believe a study done a year or two ago asked , `` regardless of whether you agree with their `` lifestyle '' or not , do you believe homosexuals in jamaica should be allowed the same benefits as others ? '', 
  only 26 % said yes , 70 % said no . 
  clearly jamaica is still an * extremely * homophobic society . 
  the irony is hilarious . 
  also pulled from wikipedia :, 
   the dog was bred first to bait bulls and bears . 
  when bear-baiting and bull-baiting were deemed inhumane , rat-baiting and dog fighting became more popular . 
  the apbt breed was used in both sports , and its prevalence in being put in pits with rats , or other dogs led to `` pit '' being added to its name . 
  that feeling goes away eventually , correct ? 
  could you explain why you believe baelish was the cause of the war ? 
  i agree with / u/lamentedghazal in that [ agot ] ( #b `` had cersei and jaime never had an incestuous relationship , jon arryn would have never discovered it , and cersei would have never had him poisoned . 
  as a result , ned stark would have never become hand of the king , bran would have never fallen and the starks and lannisters would have never become enemies . '' ), 
  no , it 's not a choice . 
  that 's uhh ... that 's ... really anti-semitic . 
  [ context ] ( http://www.youtube.com/user/themostpopulargirls ), 
  that is easily the most inane thing i 've ever heard . 
  damn , i guess i 'm ahead of the curve . 
  actually , you can . 
  not a single communist country has followed marxism correctly . 
  communism is supposed to follow capitalism , but none of the countries that have adopted communist governments had been capitalist previously . 
  how ? 
  both ch\u00e9 guevara and george washington had men executed for their crimes . 
  apparently ignorance of communism = intelligence now . 
  you think of young people at the beach ? 
  that 's the problem ; so-called `` marxist '' societies have been so far away from marxism that it 's impossible to say `` it does n't work , man , '' because it 's never been tested . 
  and as a matter of fact , your doubts are wrong . 
  communism is supposed to be the natural successor of capitalism . 
  if cambodia and china had been capitalist for however many years previously , communism would have been a much smoother shift rather than a violent and turbulent revolution . 
  who the fuck spells derek like that ? 
  the only time i 've heard `` i have nothing wrong with them , '' used is if it 's followed by , `` but i do n't agree with it , and i do n't want it around me . '', 
  shall we debate the merits of slavery while we 're at it ? 
  this post and the comments seem to be extremely self-contradictory . 
  * if you do n't want a boyfriend , you 'll get one ; if want a boyfriend , you wo n't . 
  in reality , they could stretch the tv series out for another 7 years if they split each book into two seasons as they did with asos . 
  ... that 's the point of dating , so you ** can ** find the * who * . 
  just because you did all those things and started to love yourself is n't what necessitated you getting a boyfriend , you were just in the right place at the right time . 
  it 's understandable that you would n't have chemistry with * every * single guy you meet . 
  it becomes problematic if you do n't have chemistry with * any * guy you meet . 
  well are n't we just a little expert on the m\u0153urs of fine dining ? 
  in the show , it 's perfectly possible . 
  in the books , robb and jon are 14 at the outset , and jaime was 17 when he killed aerys . 
  he and cersei are only 31-32 when the series starts . 
  he wanted his cheese and his cheddar . 
  it would be understandable if a white fish tasted too fishy , but something like salmon ? 
  fuck no . 
  when he said he wanted it well-done , you should have reused to cook it right then and there . 
  motherfucker do n't know about steak . 
  you should have done it , and just handed her that oozing monstrosity and let her deal with it . 
  you 're lumping `` debate '' and `` discussing something '' into one category , and they should n't be , as they 're inherently different . 
  with regards to gay marriage , there is n't any point discussing or debating it , because there are n't any logical arguments against it . 
  i live in the suburbs ... there 's no where to do parkour . 
  it is not important . 
  saying that marriage is a very old tradition has no gravity on whether or not gay marriage is permissible . 
  that 's something several people fail to see . 
  from a legal standpoint , what marriage * was * is irrelevant to what marriage * is * unless there 's a legal precedent for gay marriage ; knowing that a daughter could be pawned off by her father has no effect on one man marrying another . 
  tasted both . 
  they do n't taste the same . 
  but the character ike is an animation , not a living cat . 
  i actually think he 's quite talented , in that he 's rather ingenious with his raps . 
  rather than just rapping about how he killed some guy and fucked three hos , he talks about real issues . 
  furthermore , his meter does n't always match the tempo of the beat , which creates an interesting dissonance . 
  i think he 's revolutionizing rap , breaking the mold , as it were . 
  michigan here ; we love our brothers to the great white north . 
  never heard a michigander speak ill of canada . 
  but the president has the power to veto a law , so that it must be reconsidered in congress . 
  there is no best president . 
  only better than the worst . 
  you 're probably an asshole if you want to murder * anyone * . 
  not even close . 
  you 're blaming college kids because congress screwed you over ? 
  intelligent . 
  that 's funny , because obama would be closer to a republican than a socialist . 
  you 're forgetting that there was a political shift . 
  republicans in the 19th century would be closer to modern day democrats . 
  this post is really rather ridiculous . 
  congress is more to blame than obama ; likewise during the bush era . 
  i think rather than arguing , republicans , democrats , libertarians and all political groups should work together , striving to reform and improve the country ... then we can go back to arguing . 
  [ to the fact that you were the berries n ' cream lad . 
  as a michigander with a thing for scottish guys , god damn you . 
  ** edit : ** still wishing you two the best ... and , uh ... god damn you and all that . 
  the accent , the culture , the * kilts * . 
  oh , and scotch . 
  lots and lots of scotch . 
  mmmmm , scotch . 
  with haley joel osment . 
  i cried so hard and promptly went and hugged my mom . 
  okay , have fun !, 
  holy fuck , that thing 's like a foot long !, 
  so , i stalked your profile and i 'd just like to say : salutations , fellow pipe smoker !, 
  he could call you an indecisive whore ... i ca n't really think of any more bi slurs . 
  that 's interesting , there are bi stereotypes , but not slurs . 
  that 's a picture of himself that he sent to his marine boyfriend . 
  ftfy,
