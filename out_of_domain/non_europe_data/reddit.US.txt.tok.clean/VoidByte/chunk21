  while in this case you would probably be fine , it is a very bad habit to develop when learning the correct way does not take any more effort . 
  your post had some good information in it . 
  the technical bits of it where spot on . 
  i have a kettle on my desk at work ( in the us ) . 
  i get lots of weird questions about what it is :( . 
  i always preferred using ` cat ' over ' < ' because cat provides a consistent command . 
  it allows building a pipeline that is read as a pipeline . 
  it is also very easy to do things like :, 
  cat file.txt | head | ... 
  which allows you to test the rest of your command pipeline on a subset . 
  then you just delete the head and run it for real . 
  this is an extremely common convention in technical circles . 
  we label servers ` blahx.yvr1 . < company  ` or ` blahx.lhr1 . < comapany  ` all the time . 
  makes for a nice logical naming system . 
  an absolutely fantastic produce store that also sells european candy , jams and other imports . 
  sorry , i meant the boat he is on not the one you can see . 
  i use macvim but i selected gvim . 
  i have around forty plugins . 
  many of them are syntax highlighting , code completion etc. 
  many for languages i do n't use nor ever have ( wtf is vim-cucumber doing in my plugin folder ? ) . 
  i only use a few that significantly adjust the vim experience : minibufexplorerpp ( i could drop this and probably should ) , ctrlp , gitgutter , and fugitive . 
  so in your home directory you should have :, 
  * ` ~ / . vimrc ` : your personal config, 
  inside of ` ~ / . vim/bundle ` you git clone the plugins you want . 
  i 'm not familiar with any ' ~ / . vim/pathogen / ` directory . 
  you should have ` ~ / . vim/bundle/delimitmate / { . git , ... } `, 
  oh and in your . vimrc you should have :, 
  '' load the pathogen package manager . 
  there is a bug that causes vim to return 1 instead of 0 if filetype is not, 
  '' on when you attempt to turn it off . 
  it must be off for pathogen to work, 
  '' correctly . 
  so turn it on then turn it off there by ensuring it is off and, 
  '' that vim returns proper status codes . 
  filetype on, 
  filetype off, 
  call pathogen #infect ( ` bundle / { } ' ), 
  call pathogen #helptags ( ), 
  call pathogen #incubate ( ), 
   i 'm a little confused by { . git ... } in your first comment . 
  if that 's refering to simply cloning the git into delimitmate / if so , i 've done that . 
  i also did n't have execute pathogen #incubate ( ) after helptags ( ) . 
  sorry i was trying to say ` deliminate / < contents of the deliminate git directory  `, 
   i had nothing other than execute pathogen #infect ( ) . 
  should i have an ` infect ' statement for every plugin in which the plugin is specified ? 
  you are correct that an infect statement is needed for each directory . 
  but to make this simpler pathogen provides a helper . 
  specifically the ` { } ` in ` bundle / { } ` tells pathogen to infect every directory in bundle directory . 
   execute pathogen ... and some refer to call pathogen ... what 's the difference ? 
  is there a difference ? 
  which should i use ? 
  ` call ` calls a specific function with arguments . 
  execute takes a string and runs the entire thing even if there are multiple function calls . 
  if you are familiar with c then think of it as the difference between execv and system , if not ignore this sentence . 
  i personally reference the language as golang around 60 % of the time . 
  it actually is less confusing . 
  i 'd be more in favor of renaming the language . 
  you are in fact wrong . 
  the ip is set in the packet by the os/application . 
  this is really useful for somethings but has allowed people to do amplification ddos attacks using a dns server . 
  basically i send you a dns request that is a small number of bytes big with a spoofed ip . 
  the result is a much larger number and gets sent to the spoofed ip . 
  you get a few thousand dns servers responding then you can crush the spoofed ips connection while yourself only sending a very small number of bytes . 
  spoofing is commonly done at the udp layer . 
  udp and tcp are on equal layers . 
  tcp does n't work because the three way handshake requires that both sides are able to successfully make requests and receive responses from each other . 
  you are correct about ftp and scp being at a higher layer from tcp and requiring tcp to work . 
  i just implemented this at work for github : enterprise . 
  the biggest problem was intercepting requests to github not generating the meta tag . 
  ` column - t ` . 
  will sort input into nicely organized columns . 
  kernel interface table, 
  i 'm pretty sure i 'm misunderstanding what you are saying . 
  awk ' { print $ 2 } ' will work without sending it through column first . 
  i use this feature of vim all the time . 
  sorting , etc. 
  upstart/daemontools/runit / god/systemd/init all solve this problem . 
  i personally am a big fan of daemontools once you have it configured it has a very nice simple ( shell ) api for doing things . 
  i think it is just will call only . 
  hmm that seems really cheap to me . 
  i was expecting 10k minimum . 
  openopenssl, 
  there was a pretty decent one ( cjones.org/hg/go-xmpp2.hg/xmpp ) but it only really implements the very core of the language but not things like muc . 
  it looks like it recently disappeared . 
  git is absolutely 100 % not a gnu program . 
  it is registered under the gpl but has no affiliation with fsf . 
  as for your other point hosting git yourself is a pain . 
  every git solution ( github , stash , gitolite , gitlab ) have their own collections of advantages and trade offs . 
  making a decision is not as simple as do it in house or do it on the cloud . 
  * edit : updated wording on second paragraph *, 
  source : just rolled out github : enterprise for a 100 + person org . 
  a young girl gets a visitor from beyond the grave who gives her a sword and set of bells that belonged to her father . 
  to discovery her father 's fate she has to travel across a wall from the late 18th century country where technology rules to a 10th ( ish ) century country where magic rules . 
  along the path she battles the undead , meets companions and explores her families history . 
  does the walker choose the path , or the path the walker ? 
  chai is often used to refer to a very specific type of tea . 
  which is a indian blend of black tea and spices often mixed with milk . 
  where are you in the us ? 
  likely you will have to find a local import store . 
  in sf bay area you can try draegers , and cameron 's pub .
