  meta means to be about itself . 
  a meta-game would be a game around a game , a meta-discussion would be a discussion discussing the art of discussions , metadata is data about data , etc. 
  / u/stonerdog 's post is not meta at all . 
  if it were a photoshop of someone photoshoping it would be meta . 
  the word is sometimes abused to be anything that that references common memes on reddit . 
  meta is an `` x about x '' not an `` x referencing x '' . 
  so a meta-reddit would be a subreddit about running/managing/building / using/something a reddit . 
  a meta-reddit -- post would be a reddit-post about how to post to reddit . 
  it is self referential for sure but that is n't enough to make something meta . 
  meta has to be an abstraction of itself . 
  first rule of polandball is to not talk about polandball . 
  no , not at all . 
  aws is absolutely expensive . 
  most people of scale will build out their own infrastructure . 
  dropbox , netflix , etc. 
  really old and likely out of date but the their is a high scalability article from when they were justin.tv http://highscalability.com/blog/2010/3/16/justintvs-live-video-broadcasting-architecture.html, 
  kinda . 
  the cost per unit of resource ( cpu , memory , disk , network ) on aws is all much higher . 
  but for a small company it can balance out since they are unable to negotiate good rates for resources , they have to hire someone to manage the datacenter , they have to manage power , buy routers etc. 
  so for a small company it can definitely be cost efficient overall . 
  for a big company they may say it will cost us x % more but we will gain flexibility that will make the increase in cost worth it . 
  at the end of the day dollar for dollar aws is way more expensive . 
  thanks for all of the suggestions !, 
  i 've bought a couple of them and will try and get back with reviews . 
  i often end up at 404 's because i manually munge with urls . 
  justin.tv deleted all archives a while ago . 
  there was an announcement beforehand to let people know to download the files . 
  free apps :, 
  * iterm2 - much much better than the builtin iterm . 
  * macvim, 
  * sourcetree - does n't replace command line git but can be useful when looking at the bigger picture or to augment git . 
  * dropbox - used mostly for syncing other apps like iterm and 1password . 
  * caffeine - small menu bar item for quickly disabling the screen saver . 
  paid :, 
  * divvy - create keyboard shortcuts for arranging your windows . 
  i have a couple of keybindings for top , bottom , left , right , top left corner , etc. 
  * alfred - useful tool for launching other apps , good clipboard manager . 
  * 1password - soo very much worth the money . 
  its a great feeling to know that i do n't know the passwords to most of the sites i log into and that i do n't need to know them . 
  * radium - not the greatest but a useful tool for listening to sirusxm or di.fm . 
  i 'm like 99 % sure that none of the mods are twitch staff . 
  iterm2 is a much more featureful terminal emulator . 
  a lot of the advantages that were in iterm2 have now been ported to terminal.app like better color support . 
  still iterm2 has a bunch of stuff that terminal.app does n't like :, 
  * better horizontal and vertical split windows ( with some key bindings these become very powerful ), 
  * syncing settings via dropbox, 
  * visor mode to temporarily pop up a terminal window . 
  these are just the features i use there are a bunch more i do n't that you can integrate into your workflow like tmux support . 
  when talking about non-traditional income ( basically anything that is n't in a paycheck ) its safe to assume that 50 % of it is going to taxes . 
  between federal tax , state tax , social security , self employment tax , etc you end up around 50 % or close enough that you just put 50 % away for taxes and anything left over is bonus . 
  * disclaimer : this is for the us only *, 
  my understanding is that undertown does n't really exist but was largely a case of artistic license by mr. butcher . 
  i 'd say more i have one voice that goes along its merry way and another that is me talking to myself . 
  often the other two have nothing to do with each other . 
  i 'm looking for a small-ish daily bag something to carry a 11 '' macbook air , a notebook , and a few odds and ends like sunblock . 
  preferably something in leather . 
  i came across [ cambridge satchel companies expedition ] ( https://www.cambridgesatchel.com/us/buy/expedition-satchel/ ) . 
  i was thinking the slim in brown . 
  though i like the oxblood enough to get a medium in it . 
  will this look too out of place ? 
  most days i 'm wearing a button up with jeans or chinos . 
  100 % agree . 
  when i was newly deconverted living in utah i spent a lot of time on / r/atheism . 
  it was a useful tool for dealing with the world around me . 
  as time passed and i mellowed a fair amount i unsubbed because it had reached the point where instead of helping me deal with the issues it was just encouraging me to focus on them and not move on . 
  / r/atheism has a place and i still occasionally visit it . 
  i 'm glad it is n't a default sub any more , it likely never should have been but at the same time i do n't think it is quite the hell pit that some think it is . 
  i seem to have found at least part of the answer . 
  according to the us embassy in london if the deed poll is witnessed and stamped by a solicitor then it will be recognized in the usa .

  texas was a country for 10 years . 
  that is hardly anything to rave about . 
  vermont was a country for over 20 . 
  hawaii for over a hundred years . 
  have you seen a doctor ? 
  that is interesting because in my five years at two companies over 70 % of the programmers had a beard . 
  granted very few of them were anywhere near that crazy . 
  with pr votes for small third parties matter more . 
  this causes a wider collection of parties that have to compromise to form a coalition . 
  since each party ends up with a small number of concerns and problems they are worried about it allows an individual to better express what their main concerns are by voting for a the party that matches their views . 
  with fptp you have to vote for someone you think will win and it becomes a race of who is the least bad . 
  btw you wanted `` immaculate '' which means in pristine condition . 
  not `` emasculate '' which means to make something weaker , or to take away a mans role or identity . 
  probably two and a half feet or so . 
  ~ ~ i showed him the article for a knobkerrie and he said he would probably agree except for the two smooth bowl like sections , one on the top and one on the side . ~ ~, 
  i looked around the internet some more and found these pictures : http://www.randtribal.com/zulu_scalloped_knobkerrie_2.html, 
  it has indentations in the same place they are just flat instead of bowled out . 
  this is almost certainly the answer . 
  you can tax gifts . 
  the usa has a gift tax . 
  in the states we have two main forms of identification . 
  our drivers license which is used to verify age and identity for 90 % of stuff [ 1 ] . 
  this comes in a hard laminated card . 
  and then we have our social security number [ 2 ] . 
  your ssn is used to identify you for tax and social security ( our pension scheme ) . 
  in addition it is needed when applying for a passport . 
  some other people ( comcast , doctors office , etc ) piggy back and use it as a form of identification . 
  the ssn card is paper , but it really is n't a problem because you should n't be carrying it with you . 
  the only time you need the physical card is when applying for your drivers license , starting a new job or getting a passport . 
  the rest of the time you just need to know your number .
