  american sailing association, 
  your credit card info was n't available to the public . 
  there was a misconfiguring in the cache server that caused display data to be displayed to the wrong person . 
  this caused things like the last four of your credit card to be shown . 
  the actually scary info is things like your address . 
  as a software/operations engineer ( both sides of the coin ) who has had to work with and manage caching servers i approve this message . 
  the diamond age : or , a young lady 's illustrated primer, 
  i love using siri . 
  i use it to call people , check what my next appointment is , set timers , etc. 
  [ google image search ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=slav+squatting&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=678&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjelluh6ytkahue8gmkhwqrb1mq_auibigb ), 
  i think it is also a matter of where you grew up . 
  in the uk peter rabbit is everywhere . 
  in the us not so much . 
  it exists in america , but i do n't think everyone knows about it . 
  reminds me of my least favorite name ever `` nevaeh '' , it 's heaven backwards . 
  hate to break it to you but its very doubtful that your suggestions caused those features to be implemented . 
  it can take weeks of programming and testing to add features like that . 
  it is most likely that the features where in planning if not testing well before you filed your support ticket . 
  i have a outback , horatio is a bit small so i have to lift him in and out currently , but once he gets a bit bigger he should be able to manage it himself . 
  plenty of space for him and gear . 
  hong kong would be first world . 
  it was an ally of the us ( part of the uk ) during the cold war . 
  episode iii is kinda 11 years old , episode iv is even older than that . 
  well outside of the spoiler statue of limitations . 
  emotional support animals are just animals that help people with anxiety , depression , etc. 
  being around my dog calms me down , and makes me less anxious . 
  that is enough for my doctor to give me the emotional support animal paperwork . 
  service animals must be trained to provide a specific service , such as guiding the blind , detecting and reacting to someone going into a seizure etc. 
  these are two completely different categories of support animals . 
  and i fully support your right to be able to buy a joint while you are on vacation . 
  sadly i ca n't buy my dog when i land , so you know the two weeks where i 'm in another place its kinda nice to have him around . 
  also simmer down now . 
  keep watching , there is a brief glimpse of him eating dog food out of it . 
  kids like running around with space ships fighting each other ? 
  portland actually has bicycle highways . 
  they are pretty sweet . 
  it may not have anything on amsterdam but by most of the worlds standards its pretty advanced cycling infrastructure . 
  because its round baked good like most pies in america . 
  its common slang for pizza in the us . 
  the worst is when `` kkk '' ends up in your documents . 
  luckily i 've always caught it before i pass it on . 
  much escaping , so wow . 
  [ gridiron football ] ( https://www.wikiwand.com/en/gridiron_football ), 
  to the rest of the world everything in the sf bay area , east bay , north bay , san jose area etc etc etc are all considered `` san francisco '' , `` greater san francisco area '' and the `` san francisco bay area '' . 
  you see this all the time when people talk about silicon valley , its lumped in as part of san francisco . 
  that is how the world views the area . 
  my understanding is that course work is largely community driven with dev support for edge cases and language oddities . 
  so a small group of community members can easily produce welsh courses since its so similar to other languages , while you need massive dev support because japanese is so different . 
  i 've been in four or so rentals around the bay area over the last five years . 
  every one had a fridge . 
  never heard or seen a rental that did n't . 
  sounds like california . 
  i really wish they would add depositories in the grocery stores . 
  then people would be more likely to actually deposit them rather than throwing them away . 
  anki supports spelling fields . 
  simply add ` { { type : field name } } ` to your card . 
  in this case you would have something like ` { { type : english pronunciation } } ` then you add the english pronunciation to each of your words . 
  you know i 'm fairly sure its a mortal sin to refer to the hitchhiker 's movies over the books . 
  the books are well wroth reading . 
  ipp with an apple pencil and penultimate is like paper notes , but superior . 
  it 's easy to cut and paste , draw , backup , create new pages , change the paper type ( lined , ruled , graph ) etc. 
  granted it has downsides like being way more expensive , and needing to charge . 
  the echo is n't always listening , at least in that it is n't streaming everything to the cloud . 
  instead it has a small specialized processor that can detect when the right word is said , that triggers it to start shipping to the cloud . 
  tp flakes and ends up with small pieces of tp everywhere . 
  in addition when i blow my nose frequently with tp i end up with torn up chapped peeling hurting skin around my nose . 
  unemployment is only granted if you are laid off , or other extenuating circumstances . 
  the one time i 've ever applied ( and i was granted it ) was after my company was three months behind on paychecks so i quit . 
  if you quit , or are fired for bad behavior unemployment is almost certainly going to be denied . 
  ` 42 ` is n't the answer to every question in life , the universe and everything else . 
  instead ` 42 ` is the answer to the * ultimate question * of life the universe and everything else . 
  the difference being there is one question that is more important than any other and the answer to that is ` 42 ` . 
  * ca n't tell if joke *, 
  their grandmother is the queen of england , her portrait happens to be almost all ( or all ? ), 
  british currency . 
  epoch is not necessarily pronounced as epic . 
  in fact i do n't think i 've ever heard it pronounced that way . 
  according to the [ cambridge dictionary ] ( http://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/pronunciation/english/epoch ) , that is the american pronunciation , but even that i do n't fully believe . 
  [ xcode ] ( https://developer.apple.com/xcode/ ) is the standard ide from apple . 
  its basically the way to go if you are building ios or osx objective-c apps . 
  beyond that there are hundreds of options , from [ coda 2 ] ( https://panic.com/coda/ ) , [ sublime ] ( https://www.sublimetext.com/ ) , [ atom ] ( https://atom.io/ ) , [ textmate ] ( https://macromates.com/ ) , and my favorite [ macvim ] ( https://github.com/b4winckler/macvim ) . 
  most of these would be considered editors , and still need to have compiler , debuggers etc installed . 
  kinda , sorta , but its way more complicated then that . 
  android is built around the linux kernel , but its actually pretty heavily modified last i checked , for example there is a lot of controversy around wake locks and getting them merged upstream . 
  sometimes , but not always . 
  one of the meds i 'm on has a very different release profile depending upon if you get the name brand or generic . 
  my doctor had me show him the version that the pharmacist was giving me so he could either up or down the dosage accordingly . 
  fair enough . 
  is mostly the correct way to write titles . 
  they should have not capitalized words like `` has '' , `` to '' and `` for '' . 
  i highly recommend that everyone buy a copy of 1password and use it . 
  as a techie i long railed against sharing the same password everywhere , but still did . 
  1password allowed me to start out easily by just saving passwords as i went and then as i grew used to using it to enter passwords i started making more and more complicated passwords with its generator . 
  i 'm now at the point where i know four passwords off the top of my head . 
  my 1password password, 
  my apple password ( darn you apple for making me type it so often ), 
  my laptop password, 
  my ssh-key password, 
  i highly highly recommend 1password as a way to increase your password hygiene . 
  i personally do n't trust lastpass .
