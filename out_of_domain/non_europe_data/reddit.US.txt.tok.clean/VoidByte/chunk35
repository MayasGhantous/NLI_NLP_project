  you have to prove you had sufficient reason for quitting to get unemployment but it is n't cut and dry . 
  ditto with being fired too . 
  if you are fired for maliciously destroying the store i do n't think you can get unemployment .

  * leftenant * is spelled lieutenant , even when pronounced as * leftenant *, 
  in my field ( us , software engineering ) it is just about unheard of to not cover expenses . 
  flight , hotel , and often a per diem for dinner . 
  you are generally taken out to lunch mid-day since interviews often run from 10 in the morning till 4-5 at night . 
  my newfie hates snuggling . 
  he would much rather just lay in the room near you . 
  if you go to a different room he will follow and lay down in the new room next to you . 
  but if you try and snuggle he gets upset . 
  we are over at r/newfoundlander :d, 
  i got an email announcing it . 
  i thought it was new based upon that . 
  would n't this be a problem with vms ? 
  they do n't listen on the loopback address , but they are running on your localhost . 
  how does the fact that i 'm running my server in docker instead of in the main userspace/networkspace stop it from being localhost ? 
  yes that is sorta the point i 'm trying to make . 
  docker containers and vms both get exposed to the os as non-loopback devices . 
  either tun devices or virt devices . 
  yet for all intents and purposes they are considered `` localhost '' . 
  this depends upon the state . 
  even in california which has some of the most employee friendly laws , if you are writing something relevant to your job at home the company still has grounds to claim it as theirs . 
  unless you are a contractor . 
  in some states ( iirc ) it does n't matter at all if you do it in your own time and on your own machines , if you write code the company owns it . 
  look up your state laws and if in doubt contact a lawyer . 
  depends what media you listen to . 
  it was regularly mentioned on bbc world service before gary 's interview . 
   it does n't matter , how the replublican party changes , blacks/hispanics , etc. 
  are not going to vote replublican ( the dems will always promise more free stuff ), 
  have you stopped to consider that statements like this probably have more to do with the lack of minority voters then dems promising them free stuff . 
   there are now more `` minorities '' ( hispanic , asian , black ) collectively in the us than caucasians . 
  this is n't true . 
  the latest census puts `` white , alone '' ( not mixed ) at 72.4 % of the us population . 
  but that is irrelevant to my point . 
  the larger conversation here is that the rnc has issues with attracting minority voters . 
  for example according to [ gallop ] ( http://www.gallup.com/poll/160373/democrats-racially-diverse-republicans-mostly-white.aspx ) 89 % of the republican parties voters are white . 
  this is fairly out of line with the national averages . 
  your assertion was that the reason there is this discrepancy is that : '' ( the dems will always promise more free stuff ) '' . 
  my counter was maybe statements implying that minorities just want free handouts have more to do with the discrepancy than who is giving free handouts .

   my dream is a hemispheric common market , with open trade and open borders , some time in the future with energy that is as green and sustainable as we can get it , powering growth and opportunity for every person in the hemisphere . 
  ehh , i could see how she was talking about open borders in terms of energy exchange , and i could see how it is interpreted otherwise . 
  i 'm not part of the node.js community , but i am part of the rust and go community . 
  from everything i see and hear about npm it embodies everything i despise about how go manages dependencies , from what i see and hear about yarn it embodies everything i love about how rust ( cargo !!!! ), 
  handles dependencies . 
  sometimes new and shiny is better . 
  _ disclaimer : take everything said with a grain of salt as i do n't use npm or yarn _,

  ` ctrl + [ ` is the actual escape code for the ` escape ` key . 
  super easy to hit with caps =  ctrl . 
  then nothing would ever happen . 
  most elections/pools/etc between two choices end up almost evenly split . 
  look at the columbia peace referendum , american elections , etc etc. 
  there are other arguments you could use for why brexit should n't happen but this is not one of them . 
  i 'm a bit late to the party but this is n't 100 % true . 
  all of their internal services run on aws . 
  things like the website , recommendation engine etc. 
  but the actual video cdn , the thing that serves video to the users runs on their own network .

  to quote 3adwill further down this thread :, 
   to be fair it does n't mean those staffers spent all those 12 hours thinking about the tweet , i bet they read it and quickly iterated over it . 
  and should n't be called `` wireless charging '' . 
  that is a terrible gimmicky name to market it . 
  `` contact charging '' is a more accurate name . 
   oversample, 
  i do n't think that word means what you think it means . 
  oversampling is when you sample a sub-group at a larger rate than normal in order to find out specific information about that group . 
  you still weigh that group down when looking at global questions , but you then have additional information about the group when looking at the specific sub-group in isolation . 
  this is a standard polling technique that both parties use . 
  that does n't mean you overrepresent that group when you are looking at the whole . 
  so using fake numbers . 
  lets say we are doing a sample of 1000 and for simplicities sake 50/50 republican/democrats . 
  this means you would sample 500 people who claim they are republicans and 500 people that are democrats . 
  now lets say you want to run ads for democrats so you oversample them so instead of sampling 500 people you instead sample a full 1000 . 
  so you have sampled 500 republicans and 1000 democrats . 
  when you are looking at democrats vs democrats each person 's answer is weighted to 1 . 
  when you are looking at republicans vs democrats you weight each democrats answer to 0.5 . 
  thus getting mathematically a comparable result . 
  oversampling is not over representing a group in the whole . 
  it is over-representing the group in specific questions where you only care about that group .

  thanks i appreciate your response , i just see the word `` oversampled '' thrown around a lot . 
  i 've not been polled either . 
  the few times companies have tried i 've either been eliminated ( working for fortune 500 corporation that was related to poll ) or similar things . 
  although many years ago i did work for a polling organization doing crap work cleaning up their reports , doing the weighting , etc before they got sent on to the bigwigs . 
  but it was too many years ago for me to remember much of it . 
  i ca n't speak for public polls but internal campaign polls are all about accuracy they do n't care if they are winning or loosing they want the best information they can get so they can make tactical decisions . 
  not-op but i use alfred for lots of things . 
  currency conversion ( via a plugin ) , locking my mac , launching apps , pausing/playing/next track/previous track music , remembering things i 've copied ( i.e. 
  i copy `` a '' , then i copy `` b '' but i can lookup `` a '' ) . 
  that is just the short list from the top of my head .
