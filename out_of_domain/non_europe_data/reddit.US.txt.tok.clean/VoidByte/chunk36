  it just does n't take hundreds of people working on an assembly line . 
  this is the true issue . 
  we no longer need grunt labor , so we have a surplus of unemployed and underemployed people and they are left holding the hot potato wondering what to do . 
  things like basic income , universal healthcare and social safety nets are going to be essential in the new world where we automate away 90 % of jobs . 
  and it is about to get much worse . 
  self driving cars are just on the verge of become plausible . 
  sometime in the next fifteen years you will start to see long-haul drivers replaced and that is the number one source of employment ( technically truck drivers * ) in the us . 
  what happens then ? 
  i 've never used a stethoscope on a a microchip , but i have used it one on a computer before . 
  i do n't remember the exact circumstances but something was making an odd noise and i was trying to narrow down where/what it was and the stethoscope allowed me to figure it out . 
  i think some states will `` automatically '' sign you up as part of your drivers license or voter registration . 
  so that is a possibility . 
  although , i know i had to sign up manually . 
  it was named that after the `` new york world '' newspaper which sponsored the original cup . 
  definitely a misleading name , but made a lot more sense in the context of the paper . 
  fair enough . 
  i glanced through wikipedia to find the name of the company , but missed the surrounding paragraph saying that it was disputed . 
  thanks !, 
  uhh , actually whites still are a majority of america . 
  according to the 2010 census they makeup somewhere around 60-70 % of americans . 
  it is projected that in 2044 whites will no longer be a majority . 
  although if republicans ca n't fix their civil war and figure out what it is they stand for then it is hard to see them putting forth a respectable candidate . 
  it does workout that a californian 's vote is worth less than an alaskan 's . 
  * california population : 37,253,956 / 55 electoral votes ~ = 677,344 people per electoral vote . 
  * alaska : 736,732 people / 3 electoral votes ~ = 245,577 people per electoral vote . 
  so because alaska has such a small population and they are guaranteed three electoral votes each person 's vote ends up being worth `` more '' in the end election . 
  now then this is not to say that the electoral college system is fundamentally bad or good . 
  but it does value different states ' citizens differently in order to balance the power between large states and small states . 
  because on the surface this is very normal . 
  on the bbc , may have been `` westminster hour '' , may have been `` any questions '' , they talked about how it was normal for the sitting government to reach out to both parties mid-elections to attempt to build relationships in case they win and prepare to work with the transition team . 
  it is possible that something nefarious is going on underneath , but without proof of that , we have to take this as normal diplomatic outreach . 
  now then mr. trump 's insistence that russia was n't involved in us hacking is far far more worrying . 
  that is funny because the h1bs at my company are literally some of the smartest people i know . 
  there are two types of organizations that use h1bs . 
  those that are literally trying to hire the smartest and best people in the world , and body shops . 
  i totally agree that we need to crack down on bodyshops , but that is much better done by putting ratios on number of h1bs or something , not dissolving the system . 
  the american intelligence community is in agreement that russian actors has been behind the recent hacks of the dnc and other organizations . 
  [ mike pence even acknowledged this ] ( http://www.newsweek.com/pence-contradicts-trump-russia-behind-hacks-510468 ) . 
  here is the official statement :, 
   the u.s. intelligence community ( usic ) is confident that the russian government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from us persons and institutions , including from us political organizations . 
  the recent disclosures of alleged hacked e-mails on sites like dcleaks.com and wikileaks and by the guccifer 2.0 online persona are consistent with the methods and motivations of russian-directed efforts . 
  these thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the us election process .

  absentee ballots have been/are being counted . 
  trumps till lost the popular vote , but he won the electoral vote . 
  please do n't spread this misinformation . 
  the `` lecture '' does n't have to be a lecture . 
  it could be dylan putting on a show , reading a poem , giving a speech , really just about anything . 
  all he has to do is declare it his `` nobel laureates ' lecture '' . 
  he does n't have to go to sweden , that is just an honorary dinner where all the laureates get together as a celebration . 
  i went to buy a copy of pokemon sun the day after it came out . 
  there was a line of 50 people waiting to buy a copy . 
  i basically said screw that and went over to target . 
  they had another two boxes or so of copies and i was in and out in under five minutes . 
  not only that but preowned games are n't that cheap . 
  a brand new $ 40 copy of fire emblem conquest ( released july 2015 ) sells for $ 37 preowned . 
  you save $ 3 in order to screw the publisher and get a used copy , hurrah !, 
  go gamestop . 
  i also got to the second island at around 8-9 hours . 
  i just spent my time catching pokemon and exploring . 
   it 's not what she did wasnt illegal , people are literally in jail - right now - for things far less severe than what she did, 
  what she did was perfectly legal at the time . 
  unethical , but legal . 
  the people that are in jail for `` what she did '' actually broke the law . 
  they shared confidential information with uncleared people with the purpose of sharing confidential information with uncleared people . 
  hillary shared confidential information with cleared people on a private email server . 
  as far as the fbi could find she never had the intent to share confidential information with uncleared people . 
  i know the difference is subtle , but it is a difference that is important particularly with how the laws are written . 
  but he has spent the last two weeks selling the government out for personal gain . 
  his daughter is using `` 60 minute '' interviews to upsell jewelry , his hotel is advertising that it is the place to stay to visit him , argentinian press is claiming that he is pressuring the argentinian government to remove regulation getting in the way of his construction . 
  trump is refusing to put his assets into a blind trust , and is instead inviting the manager of his assets to head of state meetings . 
  what does he have to do to convince you that he is corrupt ? 
  if he shot someone on fifth avenue would that convince you ? 
  because at this point that is all that is left . 
  i was unaware of that particular fact . 
  i can find some references to it on fox news , ny mag and the daily mail . 
  but snopes says it is [ unproven ] ( http://www.snopes.com/hillary-clinton-regularly-had-her-maid-print-classified-documents/ ) . 
  i 'll conceded that their is a possibility , but that is what the fbi was investigating , and their was no proof of wrongdoing , just carelessness . 
  no they are calling articles about how the pope endorsed trump to be `` fake news '' . 
  it is meant to be like html tags : ` < s  this is sarcasm < / s  this is not sarcasm ` . 
  sure trump can raise the money and request an audit of california . 
  same way stein has for wi , mi and pa. 
  you know , being sued for racism and loosing is about as clear a sign of racism as you can get . 
  but i guess trump totally was never sued by the government for not renting his houses to people of color , never happened at all / s. 
  this was a major talking point through the election . 
  i 'm not sure how you missed it http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/27/hillary-clinton/true-hillary-clinton-says-federal-government-sued-/, 
  how about the new york times or is that still too liberal for you . 
  at some point you are being willfully ignorant , what proof would be good enough for you to accept ? 
  technically it means `` care of '' this is used when sending a package to someone , via another person . 
  i think someone accidently replaced a ' % ' with it in a previous reddit post and it has become a bit of a meme . 
  the issue is way deeper than that . 
  during the election i would occasionally browse / r/the _ donald to try and get a glimpse of the other side and it was largely a cess pool . 
  lots of ** bold ** , and over the top statements , everything is a meme , kek , god emperor , kek etc. 
  then add in that the moderators are widely regarded as deleting everything that might be remotely contradictory to the party line and you have a mess . 
  if you want people to respect / r/the _ donald then the sub needs to take a look at how it acts . 
  on the other hand / r/conservative was much more reasonable space , people can disagree and have a discussion . 
  i do n't always like what people say on / r/conservative , but i do trust that a conversation can be had without ban hammers and constant name calling . 
  this is n't really possible . 
  i 'm legally required to enter the uk with my british passport , and likewise i 'm legally required to enter the us with my american passport .
