  well seeing as how the king had strong pro-nazi feelings it would n't have been entirely unreasonable . 
  and newfoundlanders originate in labrador . 
  particularly since it is a type of [ goblin or fairy ] ( https://www.wikiwand.com/en/redcap ) who must kill humans to continually dye their caps red in the humans blood . 
  if their cap dries out they die themselves . 
  to be fair to donny ( god i ca n't believe i 'm going to defend him ) he was most likely talking about replacing the top people in the cia who are replaced with every new administration . 
  clinton participated in the recount because the recount was happening and they wanted a lawyer in the room . 
  nothing more . 
  the entire time her campaign insisted that it was n't going to change the result . 
  he was born before apartheid ended . 
  that is kinda half the point of his book [ born a crime ] ( https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29780253-born-a-crime ) . 
  also by south african standards he is n't black , he is [ coloured ] ( https://www.wikiwand.com/en/coloureds ) , which is a different caste in the apartheid era system . 
  every race was a different caste and their was a rough hierarchy . 
  two races or tribes might be on the same rank of the hierarchy but were still not allowed to intermix . 
  i 'm far from an expert here so feel free to fact check and correct me i may have parts wrong or misremembering . 
  * afrikaner , european , japanese , taiwanese , south korean, 
  * coloured / mixed , chinese , indian, 
  * various black tribes, 
  it is also possible to ascend/descend the hierarchy , for example if you were coloured you could be `` upgraded '' to white or `` downgraded '' to black depending upon the inspector and your actions or appearance . 
  [ this quora article ] ( https://www.quora.com/what-was-it-like-to-live-in-south-africa-during-apartheid ) seems to have a good list of restrictions that were placed on different groups . 
  instagram ? 
  the problem here is concentrated benefit vs dispersed cost . 
  a small group of people receive massive benefits by selling oil/gas , but everyone is hurt a tiny tiny bit by the pollution .

  it was 17 not 18 , and it was the chief of the usic speaking on behalf of the 16 member agencies , but the point stands . 
  there is nothing i can say to change your mind . 
  the rumors you heard are just leaks and rumors . 
  here is a [ wapo ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/clinton-blames-putins-personal-grudge-against-her-for-election-interference/2016/12/16/12f36250-c3be-11e6-8422-eac61c0ef74d_story.html ) article with updated versions of those rumors saying the opposite . 
  but chances are that you wo n't trust that because 1 . it comes from the wapo and 2 . it is unconfirmed . 
  i seriously doubt the cia and the fbi will each release individual reports on the russia hacking because they do n't work like that . 
  instead when they do release public statements it is via the director of national intelligence . 
  this case is a bit more complicated than the headline reads . 
  he was not exonerated , just from my understanding released early . 
  he and a friend both provided alibis for each other . 
  the dna evidence then proved that his friend was one of the rapists . 
  in the original case the victim claimed two men raped her and identified him as one of the two . 
  i do all of my banking through charles schwab . 
  they offer full refund of atm fees and no foreign transfer fee . 
  it means when i travel i just go to any atm and withdraw the money in local currency and they do all the transfers on the backend . 
  this method is imperfect since they require a travel notice with a maximum length of 30 days , but you can re-add the travel notice every 30 days ( until they get tired of it ? ) . 
  also when you withdraw the money you withdraw say # 300 and it takes ~ $ 370 . 
  so you have to do math to figure out how much to take out . 
  since your childhood passport is long expired you are fine . 
  i was in an identical situation when i applied for my first adult passport . 
  it was five years ago that i filled it out so i might be remembering incorrectly but yes i think so . 
  i was trying to point out one way to do fee free transfers . 
  yes schwab might not operate in canada but i 'm sure there are banks with a similar setup in canada . 
  you need to take a trip to san francisco . 
  i can very much confirm that the homeless will shit in the street . 
  this was my newfie for the first 9 months of his life . 
  ** disclaimer : i 'm just starting to learn russian so take this with a grain of salt , and someone else correct me if i 'm completely wrong **, 
  in russian 's past tense you adjust the suffix of the verbs based upon the gender of the subject . 
  for males this suffix is `` \u043b '' , for females it is `` \u043b\u0430 '' , neuter it is `` \u043b\u043e '' and for plural it is `` \u043b\u0438 '' . 
  now what is interesting is if you are talking about yourself sentences start to diverge . 
  for example to say `` i read [ a book ] '' if you are male it is `` \u044f \u0447\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043b '' while if you are female it is `` \u044f \u0447\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0430 '' .

  as someone who occasionally uses lang-8 , can i ask why you are looking for alternatives ? 
  i 'd love to hear about how grammar changes based upon gender of the speaker in various romance languages . 
  i only know about cases where the grammar changes based upon the gender of the word , or 3rd party subject . 
  seriously , i love little oddities like this . 
  i 'm not sure where you are moving from but something to note if you are an american you still owe the us government taxes as if you earned that $ 50,000 in the us minus what you have already paid to the russian government . 
  also if you are moving from california they will claim that you owe them 5-10 % as well . 
  so you would owe $ 9,372 to the us government minus $ 6500 you have already paid to the russian government . 
  obviously ignore this all if you are moving from any country other than the us , or one of the few other countries that believes in global taxation . 
  if you have n't already i 'd highly recommend you add two factor auth to your google account . 
  it is n't perfect but it will greatly increase your security . 
  if you are on iphone [ overcast ] ( https://overcast.fm/ ) is a great podcast app . 
  you subscribe to the podcast in the app , either by selecting it from the menu , or manually adding the podcast 's subscription url . 
  then ovecast will download the lessons as they are released . 
  you can also configure it to download old episodes . 
  overcast then has a webview you can use to listen to episodes and it will sync the location to your iphone . 
  not quite what you are asking for but i 've been pretty impressed with my blue yeti microphone . 
  the sound quality is excellent for meetings . 
  combine with a nice set of traditional headphones and it all works out . 
  blue is the company , yeti is the microphone . 
  they also make a cheaper one called the snowball . 
  i have a terrible feeling they are confusing hindi with arabic . 
  its a tad over $ 100 ( ~ $ 106 ) but i quite like my [ blue yeti ] ( http://a.co/gwhmvjq ) . 
  i have n't used it much for language learning specifically yet but i use it for conference calls , online gaming and facetime to call the folks . 
  if you want to go cheaper ( ~ $ 69 ) i hear good things about the [ blue snowball ] ( http://a.co/iolh9vw ) . 
  i 've never used it but i 've heard good things about it from people over at / r/twitch and a coworker who has one . 
  by the way 6th form is british , for americans it is grade 12 . 
  i 'm not terribly far into russian but i have two anki decks for it :, 
  * root : : russian : : general - everything i make . 
  this is things stolen from duolingo , words i find in movies , tv shows , news papers etc. 
  * root : : russian : : cyrillic - this was a deck i downloaded from the anki site . 
  the name should be pretty self-explanatory . 
  i do n't use tags really and i do n't differentiate knowledge from different sources . 
  i currently have two types of notes , `` reversible '' and `` morphology '' . 
  i 'm constantly tweaking them and have n't used the morphology one too much yet so it will definitely see some changes . 
  reversible has a bunch of fields english , russian , russian recording , spelling , picture , and gender . 
  it then generates optional cards depending upon which fields i fill out . 
  the spelling field is simply the russian field in all lowercase with any stress indicators removed , i setup the anki card to do the spelling test based upon the spelling field if it exists if not to use the standard russian field . 
  morphology lists the case and then has a field and card for masculine , feminine , neuter , and plural . 
  as far as russian voice i use [ forvo ] ( http://forvo.com ) . 
  i search for the word try out all the options and take the one that is most legible . 
  i do tend to avoid ukranian pronunciations because i 've heard they pronounce \u0413 a bit differently . 
  my 6s was doing this and they replaced the battery . 
  seems to have fixed the issue . 
  sorry that apple support says your phone is fine .
