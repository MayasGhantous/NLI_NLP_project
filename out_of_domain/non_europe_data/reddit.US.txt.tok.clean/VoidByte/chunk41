  [ i am a bear , you are not a bear ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibjqwxig0yk ), 
  marco talked about this a bunch on [ episode 91 of * under the radar * ] ( https://www.relay.fm/radar/91 ) . 
  the podcast is pretty good all around if you are interested in ios development and/or running small businesses . 
  my biggest request/complaint about it is that there is n't a good way to register custom global shortcuts without using better touch tool . 
  i found the better touch tool system to be a bit buggy if you also use the touchbar itunes controller . 
  i wish i could just open automator build a workflow and then add it to the touchbar . 
  this is n't a backdoor . 
  this is a user initiated action that causes it to send some additional info . 
  there is no remote execution of this . 
  ** it must be initiated by the user ** by calling 911 . 
  once or twice a day in seattle , wa . 
  bloody fuck . 
  even when trump is condemning white nationalism he is still supporting it ( emphasis mine ) :, 
   `` we must love each other , respect each other and ** cherish our history ** and our future together . '', 
  there is a way to fake it with a handful of ips and one machine, 
  you should be using parameterized queries . 
  pseudo code :, 
  ** bad ** :, 
  query = `` select * from foobar where name = ' '' + name + '' ; '', 
  execute ( query ), 
  ** good **, 
  query = `` select * from foobar where name = ? 
  execute ( query , name ), 
  most database libraries should do the right thing and send the parameter separately and prevent any form of sql injection . 
  at least as far as i 'm aware . 
  ** disclaimer : i 'm not a web developer and could be wrong . 
  not sure if / s or not but : / r/starterpacks /, 
  alfred is updated all the time , last update appears to be july 2017 . 
  is the mac store version not ? 
  that is not a bad price for ribena imported to north america . 
  i 've paid anywhere from $ 15 - $ 20 for it . 
  because i love blackcurrant and it is otherwise basically impossible to get otherwise . 
  good point , i 'll make sure that is included in whatever contract we devise . 
  we are both currently in washington , but he will be moving to utah to be with family coinciding with my leaving the country . 
  my mum has an ikea expedit ( 2x3 laying horizontally ) that she keeps right next to her cable outlet . 
  she has some plants and a key basket on top of it . 
  there are a handful of baskets in some of the cubes and i think some more plants in others . 
  the router and modem are hidden in the various cubes behind the plants . 
  yea if only spulunk was n't something like a million dollars per year for a gigabit of log data per day .

  i 'm pretty sure that was intentional , as a joke . 
  i just mash my wallet to the door and hope it manages to read the right one . 
  most of the time it succeeds , sometimes you have to flip the wallet over , and rarely you have to pull the right rfid card out and hold it to the door . 
  granted i 'm just using it for door access passes , i would n't do it for credit cards . 
  to be fair he is in atlanta , home of coca-cola . 
  my friend from the area tells me coke is basically a religion there . 
  so it is entirely possible that in his ( limited ) experience everyone does primarily drink coke products . 
  the uk and ireland have very strict rules about bringing in animals to prevent the spread of rabies . 
  great effort went into eliminating rabies some hundred years ago . 
  is it possible for someone to get around quarantines and introduce rabies , yes . 
  is it likely no . 
  it is like saying my home is snake free , it is until someone brings a snake into it . 
  ahh but you are missing the important part . 
  mere serfs do n't get freedoms , only lofty land owners get it . 
  so for example i recently was checking out something about vonage for work . 
  now i 'm getting vonage popup ads . 
  i checkout eve online and i see eve online ads all over the place . 
  anyone else noticing a large amount of targeted ads ? 
  i 've been reading cliff stoll 's * the cuckoo 's egg * , in it he keeps a very detailed log of everything that happens on his servers . 
  this has gotten me thinking about my job and has resurrected past thoughts about keeping a log . 
  so my question : how many of you keep logs . 
  what tools do you use and what tips do you have for doing it ? 
  thanks, 
  i have a nexus one . 
  i love it but the power button just broke about 2 weeks outside of the warranty htc is leaving me out to dry . 
  so i 'm planning on switching to verizon ( better reception than t-mobile ) and getting an iphone . 
  is it worth getting the iphone 4 now or using some hacks to keep using my nexus until the new iphone comes out . 
  what is the deprecation on an iphone if i where to resell it when the iphone 5 comes out ? 
  so i recently got my first bike and went to fill it up . 
  a bit of gasoline splashed and got onto the outside of the tank . 
  like an idiot i did n't stick the cap back on before i grabbed some paper towel to wipe it off . 
  a corner of the paper towel fell off into the gas tank and quickly sunk to the bottom . 
  what do i do now ? 
  so i went sailing a few times as a kid while in boy scouts and really enjoyed the opportunity . 
  i 'm now looking to get into sailing and was curious if anyone knew of any good resources , schools , or programs to relearn the basics of sailing ? 
  i 'm a huge blackcurrant fan and a huge tea fan . 
  i figured i 'd try and find something that mixed to two . 
  are there any recommendations for a good blackcurrant black tea ? 
  thanks . 
  hey ,, 
  i 'm a dual citizen usa/uk residing in california . 
  i 'm looking into the possibility of changing my last name . 
  this is unrelated to any form of marriage . 
  does anyone have any information regarding the process for having my name changed in both countries ? 
  for example is a uk deed poll recognized in the usa ? 
  is a usa court order recognized in the uk ? 
  will i just need to file both get the name approved in both countries ? 
  anything else i should be worried about ? 
  i know i 'll have to get my driver 's license reissued , ssn , both passports , etc. 
  thanks !, 
  an uncle recently passed away and its been hard on my grandmother particularly financially . 
  this particular uncle was basically wholly dependent upon my grandmother for all aspects of his life for his entire life . 
  so it has gotten me thinking about what is in store for the future and particularly my parents . 
  now i should probably lead up with my parents have no financial common sense . 
  they are in debt up to their necks . 
  would it make sense and can i take life insurance out on my parents ? 
  that way when they pass i 'm not having cover the funeral etc ? 
  i 'm assuming that any money from the insurance would be safe from their debts as it would be my policy . 
  for clarification i 'm not talking a big policy but something small to cover funeral and other expenses . 
  * edit : they are in utah , i 'm in california if that matters .
