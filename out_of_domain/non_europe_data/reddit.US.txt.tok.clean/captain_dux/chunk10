  glad i made your day . 
  you helped make me a better man . 
  so kawaiiiiii senpai, 
  this dude right here . 
  i mean i admit i 'm bad . 
  i 'm just trying to help put my peers . 
  you can learn from the student sometimes . 
  i guess i 'm ever the optimist . 
  who wants a piece of machamp - bruno . 
  . oh wrong game my b, 
  holy cow so many lamp shaped welts . 
  shhhh ... 
  i ca n't hear you under my hooves, 
  too true , had a game of top cat ( i love me some rengar ) started out 1/3 due to bad map awareness and not dealing with udyr well . 
  but , at level 6 i started to roam . 
  got a few kills and went the akaadian rengar route of one shotting . 
  when a fight would break out , best believe i am diving the adc and making him remember there is a rengar out there . 
  alone farming ? 
  picking you off then counter shoving lane and bailing . 
  all the while , our wonderful thresh had the nerve to flame everyone ( particularly me ) and say i was trash and throwing . 
  started 1/3/0 . 
  ended 17/8/8 , with a decent ( not good ) cs total . 
  we won , thresh still flamed me and said my rengar plays gave him cancer typical bronze behavior . 
  the jist is , every time we 'd die and he 'd run because he did n't want to die the first thing out of his mouth was `` it 's people like you why i am stuck in bronze . '', 
  no jerk weed , you are stuck in bronze because you 're straight toxic and ca n't help your team . 
  you tear them down . 
  mute works wonder kids , still climbing with cat . 
  no stopping me now . 
  silver v here i come . 
  that 's a whole lotta yasuo , but dang dude . 
  well played !, 
  made my favorite jungle cat into a neato wallpaper < 3, 
  i 'm considerably lower elo than you , but have higher elo experience in dota 2 . 
  so , here we go . 
  it seems like you are tilt . 
  you 're dying a lot and sticking to your `` go to '' . 
  while that 's great when you 're winning , on tilt you 'll end up shooting yourself in the foot . 
  second , something something wards . 
  you did n't but much of any wards . 
  if you 're going to play a niche top laner , like yasuo , on every back get a ward . 
  it 's 75g , wo n't break the bank . 
  play with a metronome in the background and ward . 
  every 6 ticks check the mini map . 
  pick a bpm that works for your tempo . 
  secondly , stop playing ranked . 
  i 'm serious , just stop . 
  play normals and rediscover your love for league . 
  you really need to understand that this is n't solely about winning . 
  when i broke 3.5-4 .5 k mmr in dota 2 , i strictly played brewmaster and undying . 
  but i did it because i was smiling every game ? 
  fed my butt off as brew ? 
  yolo lol it happens . 
  have fun , take a break and just ignore your past . 
  you ** were ** diamond . 
  you ** are not ** diamond right now . 
  focus on your mistakes and conquer yourself before you conquer others . 
  interesting , i am a lower elo rengar main and have gone the akaadian path to winning ( that sweet sweet 100 % crit ) . 
  never the less , ap rengar back when i started used to be hilarious . 
  is it still as powerful as season 3 ? 
  if elements loses this week . 
  i will listen to nyan cat for 8 hours , playing only ap rengar climbing ladder . 
  mark my words . 
  this will be the return to glory . 
  viva la allaince ( pls come back to former form , as a dota 2 notidehunter fan as well ), 
  do you need medical attention , i thought i heard you choking . 
  i 'll raise you one bet . 
  loser listens to nyancat for 8 hours playing only apcat-gar . 
  never . 
  alliance was a champ last i recall . 
  lucker dogs still trying to scrim . 
  no thank you . 
  i 'll take a team actually has a shot to win worlds . 
  the undefeated streak starts today b o y z, 
  edit : shoo shoo na , this is eu . 
  out with you, 
  not to be a stick in the mud , but is there a keep this horse wizardry out of my god damn lane . 
  forget shen , hes such a jerk . 
  my rengar top ca n't cheese that . 
  happy cake day !, 
  i never said what ladder i 'd climb . 
  probably na because easy . 
  flair up buddy . 
  el win for the day . 
  hold up . 
  we them elements, 
  pay up nerds . 
  i do n't know , going to school in the south ( born in the north east ) , a lot of the deep family lines i hear from my girlfriend 's family sound way too fake . 
  but that 's how they talk . 
  that , or the 87,000 packs of dip her redneck family chews a day ruined their mouths . 
  [ i lol 'd ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydcjl7qya1s ), 
  that is fairly true . 
  also seeing as her family grew up in the sticks of bumble fuck . 
  they are very proud to be sons and daughters if the confederate . 
  they are sad their niece/cousin/granddaughter is dating a `` yank '' . 
  thankfully she 's more educated than that . 
  also mfw i 'm a first generation american . 
  i attend school in sc , being born in the north east let me send in my two cents worth . 
  i grew up in a badish area , guns were common and so was a lot of violence . 
  i got out , i got educated , now i am a fine individual as of today . 
  i am personally against guns , to me it 's unnecessary , i have a right to own one , i just choose not to .
