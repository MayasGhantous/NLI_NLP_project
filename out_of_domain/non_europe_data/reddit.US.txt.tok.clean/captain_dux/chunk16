  cheers mate , i 'm working from my home state but once i am in season with mudding/at uni i 'll do more research, 
  like the mudder ? 
  heh , 10 time veteran of multiple runs and am trying to qualify for my universities competitive running battlefrog squad !, 
  i got ta try muay thai then , my university offers classes to staff and since housing is staff . 
  . got ta try, 
  that 's my ultimate fear . 
  having a knee that was a hare 's breath away from total reconstruction i 'm wondering if i can kick box without having to fit . 
  like working on a heavy bag and/or sandbag a dummy . 
  any advice ? 
  very interesting , i will ask the gym at my uni . 
  i normally just want to fight against either a shadow or a dummy . 
  that way if my knee is shot it 's own dang fault . 
  i do n't want a guy my weight and height landing devastating shots on my knee , but another guy in the thread said his knees were okay . 
  i feel like if i see aatrox top i just giggle and go jax . 
  may be the wrong instinct . 
  but , i feel aatrox just ca n't hang with jax outright . 
  once jax gets a bork and sheen , it 's curtains . 
  sad story of my childhood . 
  paper mario and the thousand year door just dropped , having paper mario been my favorite game i had to conquer it . 
  i was stuck fighting the shadow queen when the urge to go called . 
  i could see the tv from where i was seated but , didnt want to extend my play time . 
  it was a really low play time . 
  so , i brought my wavebird into the can , beat the shadow queen . 
  tl ; dr - owned a wavebird , dumped on the shadow queen while taking a dump . 
  i mean , most of the time when an aatrox goes to cs i will immediately hit him with a w . that really hurts , i play jax fairly aggressively to try and force out . 
  it may not make a difference but i also go quick level 2 with dorans blade . 
  i just feel like whenever i go jax into aatrox it 's over before it starts . 
  but is also only from my experience , 
  i 'll have to save a few shekels for graves then , 
  again , its all relevant , even if you keep jax down they can survive decently enough until 6 and sheen spike . 
  once that happens they will just farm and walk all over opposition . 
  i really think jax is a sturdy wall against aatrox , that is my humble ** opinion ** . 
  take it as such , i really hold true that once you get sheen and if you have the bare minimum of common sense about when to use e . the lane should be a cake walk once you get sheen . 
  sheen is a hugeee spike for jax . 
  it makes farming infinitely easier , plus if you rush bork vs aatrox i do n't know much about how he works but i think bork just makes aatrox sad in general . 
  again , this is my opinion . 
  not really a sleeper op , take it from the guy who plays a monkey ton of jax . 
  his early game is weak , and i mean weak . 
  you get ganked early and die you 're pretty f 'd all game . 
  you need to farm efficiently and wait for item spikes to even be relevant . 
  however , nothing short of a nuclear bomb will stop a well farmed jax and your splitting power is unparalleled . 
  pls no tankgar . 
  it 's nice if you are behind , but if you get the kills you need always go damage . 
  your job as rengar is to delete the adc / apc ( mid ) off the face of the earth and then vanish and do it again . 
  with that in mind , to those ** learning ** rengar , get some tanky items !, 
  if you ca n't trust your mechanics the little armor or mr from visage and randy will cover your messed up combos, 
  sleeper op ? 
  i do n't have one but jung olaf with ghost , righteous glory , and ult is fun . 
  i pretend to be a racecar . 
  coming bot !, 
  zoooooooooooooooooommmmmm . 
  ah , see that 's the thing . 
  jax needs to play passive in this lane and let aatrox come to him . 
  let 's pretend you are jax for the time being . 
  you have 3 options top . 
  aggressive jumping and zoning ( bad idea vs aatrox he 's just going to out sustain you ) , passively farm and let him come to you ( most likely to happen , if an aatrox let 's you free farm you just punish him in 5 minutes with a sheen and bilge on first b or whatever ) , and lastly , defensive ganking oriented play ( second most likely , you are scared this aatrox knows his business and will force you to tower . 
  if he does , call for a gank , wind up e jump , and then force him to summner out . ) . 
  jax is weird vs aatrox , you need to play passive at first , but once you get your first spike . 
  it 's time to abuse aatrox , your passive is what you need to watch for against jax . 
  if you are anywhere near 1/2 hp count jax 's autos and watch his items . 
  eg : you have no passive and are sitting at 1/2 hp farming . 
  i will wind up 2 autos . 
  then w q you . 
  that will either kill you or force a flash . 
  let 's do the basic calculations without numbers . 
  you are getting hit by sheen + q + w + passive and possibly an auto . 
  that 's a lot . 
  as aatrox you are correct , you need to abuse jax early , place wards to watch for ganks . 
  but above all do not let me farm and trade for free . 
  hope it helps . 
  eh , i have n't had the same success with malph aatrox as i do with jax . 
  why is rengar the baddiest dude around ? 
  everything he says is followed by straight savagery . 
  abilities : q = a | w = s | e = d | r = f, 
  items = 1 = z | 2 = x | 3 = c | 4 = t | 5 = g | 6 = b, 
  summoners = w e, 
  i used to play a ton of world of warcraft at high mmr pvp ( 2500 + for those curious ) . 
  so please bare with me about my bindings . 
  i always have my ghostblade on z because it allows me to seamless go z - a - leap - d - s - dead target . 
  i also use my hydra on x ( or 2 ) , but that is my binding . 
  i can explain more and why my bindings are so funky . 
  darius / renekton / other lane bullies - generally i just whimper to myself and pray my jungler gives me mercy so i can get an early kill on the target . 
  gnar - abuse the bushes and beat him up when he is little , you need to remember that if he gets big you got ta back off . 
  big gnar is a lot more scary than baby gnar . 
  voli - same thing , cheese him with zoning and abuse him early . 
  you have shockingly strong early game buddy . 
  first piece of advice , holy bajesus christ man you play a ton of champions . 
  secondly , you die a shit ton . 
  over your past 20 games you have averaged almost 8 deaths to 3 kills with 5 assists , worse yet only a 40 % kill participation !, 
  you have a90 % win rate on leona over 10 games . 
  like dayum dude that is good . 
  play more leona !, 
  my phone is about to die , but tonight if you want , message me and we can talk in depth about this dude !, 
  you may want to narrow down a role and have pocket picks unless you are pigeon holed to a role . 
  for instance , i main top and jung with a heavy hand in rengar . 
  if i ca n't rengar go olaf . 
  i would suggest you play support and jungle . 
  you seem to have decent winrates in those roles , if i stand corrected . 
  trump is seriously on a bender of destruction , what is he aiming to accomplish ? 
  his brash overzealous attitude has n't won him many supporters .
