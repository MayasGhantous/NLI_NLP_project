  if you 're na i 'd love to help you, 
  so did you subscribe him to like 99 porn websites . 
  edit : andddd my highest comment is about trolling people with porn . 
  shame, 
  doodly doodly scrubbing my toes . 
  jax is my go to top laner , he is really fun but if you get punished , oh boy you are screwed . 
  my normal start is flask pots and charge lane with w as first skill . 
  however , if i am really confident i can win out , i go d blade and kill wolves starting e. 
  as jungle jax you probably want rangers , rush sheen , get warrior , then finish tri . 
  you need to remember jax is all about finishing his items , becoming a split pushing monster , and lastly punishing anyone dumb enough to fight him 1 on 1 . 
  however , being a jungle main ( rengar in particular ) if i see a jax top . 
  i tend to priortize ganking him early and often to make his life hell . 
  jax does n't like getting ganked early with no items . 
  it really stinks , in fact it makes your lane a nightmare . 
  if i get a good bush gank off and shiv him off the map . 
  guess what , top lane is won i can camp elsewhere . 
  jax generally falls behind in farm and once he hits his item power spikes it 's too late . 
  i already got fed or someone else is big . 
  jax is fun , but respect his weaknesses , 
  fair statement , i normally go the dekar or akaadian rengar route . 
  tiamat , skip warrior , rush lw , youmoos , ghostblade , sell smite etc etc. 
  i can generally one shot anyone who is n't a tank with relative ease just because of rengar 's insane ganking power . 
  i was thinking kha has a similar role of if you are alone , watch your back because i will find you and make it painful . 
  normally i just stick to off picks like malph jung , rekt ` sai , even the occasional vi if i ca n't get rengar . 
  but kha just looks fun , if that makes sense . 
  also , in regard to his build . 
  i did a little research before posting , would you recommend warrior , tiamat , bc rush on kha ? 
  also does kha tend to use cdr boots like knifecat or is he happier with mercs ? 
  fair statement . 
  i figured they were up the same alley so i would give him a whirl . 
  but who knows , i just love catman and he does some serious work when he gets a lead . 
  it 's scary the crits i have laid down . 
  e.g : back in my b1 promos , enemy shaco thinks he is sneaky and disappears into stealth . 
  had 5 ferocity , ult , q , youmoos , i think the crit was almost for 1.2 k ? 
  yeah that scared me and i was n't even on shaco . 
  i do n't see shacos since i left bronze and low silver ( surprise surprise ) . 
  but normally i save my smite for heimer turrents and shaco boxes . 
  it is funny to see people open mouthed and shocked when their gimmick backfires . 
  i will definitely give kha a fair shake, 
  this is interesting , why do you not go black cleaver . 
  i thought bc armor shred passive and kha 's q with the passive are perfect in harmony . 
  my theorized build would be ranger warrior , tiamat , mercs , phage if behind , or lw if ahead , hydra , bc rush or lw depending on what was built first , then get survivability items . 
  yes this build lends itself from the rengar mindset but maybe you can explain why no bc on kha ? 
  very insightful !, 
  i feel there are nuances to rengar that need a lot of technical mastery and patience . 
  it 's why a lot of people put him away and when he wins hard it 's an `` op champ rito nerferino pls '' . 
  kha has always had my eye , not because i like having the edge in, 
  the hunt mini quest . 
  i think in my past 5 or 6 games i only saw one good kha player . 
  he was scary , he almost killed me in a one on one in the hunt quest , i was actually impressed . 
  kha just looks super fun and requires the same patience is a virtue killing tactics rengar has . 
  thanks for the help !, 
  i really want to give him a whirl now !, 
   although if they have like 3/4 tanks then go for black cleaver and then take merc treads instead for boots . 
  good to know . 
  as a rengar player my mind set is hunt down apc or adc make them go away , run away , do it again . 
  this play style seems really similar , i think this could be good . 
  i only get soto if i am dead certain i will not die . 
  i can generally float 10 stacks , but i do n't generally like soto it does n't fit my style . 
  however , if i go rengar top , yeah im totally getting soto . 
  so if i understand you , kha takes a weeee bit more patience ? 
  i think that i can understand what you mean by saying it 's all isolation . 
  qt and nb3 are all playing kha right now . 
  i am on coffee break so i am watching them and it seems fairly similar to rengar . 
  just a lot more being patient . 
  yeah , when i was in bronze low silver it was as easy as ult , you-q , jump kill . 
  as i climbed i learned how to kill with no ult , it 's a lot of thinking and mind games . 
  but i think kha will work . 
  however , i still love jungle cat . 
  season 3 jungle cat and me go a wayyyyssss back . 
  something something deflate-gate . 
  something something we have revis . 
  something something super ** bowles **, 
  yes he does sometimes if he is wildly ahead . 
  i mean i watched his youtube , you probably know better than i. i have seen pridestalker and him skip the warrior if they are stupid stupid ahead . 
  it 's not an every day im skipping it thing . 
  sounds like an absolute rekt-oning . 
  this seems to be the general consensus . 
  i am assuming people are saying `` if you can do it , do it , it 's weak but hell try it '' i normally go tank jungles if i ca n't rengar . 
  shaco 2spoopy4me and nowayjose.gif am i playing nid . 
  no no . 
  too much work . 
  you got ta make a profile , manage it , i ca n't i have farrr too many fabulous men fawning for me . 
  am named shane . 
  i also have played football ( american ) all my life . 
  my family and girlfriend come to my college games , and still find it hilarious , to yell `` come back shane '' any time i make some variant of a play . 
  it 's now caught on and the sideline yells it too . 
  i still never hear the end about that movie . 
  inb4 yes i have seen it and liked the movie . 
  oh look , it 's jim . 
  hey he took my favorite spot last week . 
  i guess he is n't getting coffee ** this week or any other weeks ** .
