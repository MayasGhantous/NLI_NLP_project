  for giggles i have gone trundle and that has been to my advantage to the n ^ th degree . 
  if that makes sense ? 
  do n't own teemo or kennen , normally if i see nasus i go rengar and just beat him down early with bush abuse and kill power . 
  i picked trundle a couple of times because i thought `` fuck it why not '' . 
  i thought because nasus wants to get beefy , my ult basically saps that power from him . 
  my jimmies are intergalactic now . 
  just wanted to say this : holy shit you play a lot of fizz . 
    be me , silv 1ish mmr with friends in his promos,

    [ mfw ] ( http://stream1.gifsoup.com/view2/3421755/fuuuu-rage-o.gif ) `` no one plays rengar right , everyone just gets damage and that 's retarded '', 
    link my profile showing 80 % winrrate on glorious catman, 
    `` you stupid homo why did n't you tell us you mained rengar '', 
    `` because he 's op and i want to keep it a secret '' [ had to go with this disgusting bug instead ] ( http://orig10.deviantart.net/2dfa/f/2012/283/4/8/troll_kha__zix_by_tinelia-d5hggcm.jpg ), 
  so you are buying him a bubble right ? 
  rengar main here , climbed from bronze to low gold with the cat . 
  runes i use , armor pen reds , armor yellows , cdr blues , 2 armor pen quints 1 cdr quint . 
  start whatever side you are comfortable with . 
  as you progress try the dekar level 3 start ( albeit more complicated , but man does it throw the other jungle off his game ) . 
  you can lane gank around 4 , but your power comes from a massive level 6 ambush . 
  what i tend to do is hone in on a weaker target . 
  monitor mid and bot , occasionally top and see who is barely surviving trades . 
  think with patience and opportunity as you play . 
  build order is kinda cut and dry imho :, 
  get a trailblazer ( do not buy warrior , dont do it ) , tiamat , brut , boots , youmoos , cdr boots , lw , sell blazer , hydra , then its situation builds from there . 
  if i am wildly ahead , i rush ie , pd , sell boots for another pd . 
  build that ? 
  if i am the laggard or getting cc 'd i get bt and merc scim . 
  overall rengar is super fun but i do n't suggest nb3 as a rengar player . 
  sure he makes big plays but he does n't play just the cat . 
  dekar , pridestalker , akaadian , rengaronly , and others to name a few will teach you way more . 
  currently learning bug , however , imho fuck the bug play rengar . 
  i know hypocritical and all but rengar gets banned and i can olaf play olaf so much before i wan na go to an assassin, 
  the reason i was wonking around with it is because she is n't as imposing late game . 
  that may just be my ignorance of it , however , i have noticed the devourer makes her scary . 
  add in botrk and you got sticking power on really nasty w procs . 
  i have been debating adding in bc rush then botrk because i prefer to have a big 1 2 knock out . 
  but after my two damage items is when i tank up hard . 
  worked as a physical therapist aid some time ago to pay bills in college . 
  in all my years of nasty injuries post surgery i saw , lock-arm , dislocations , hip replacements . 
  nothing is fucking scarier than seeing an achilles tear . 
  the screaming you hear is unrelenting . 
  the head therapist/doctor even said it hurts so bad he would n't wish it on his worst enemy . 
  that when you know it 's bad, 
  paper mario , in particular the [ huff n. puff battle . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovsv_rvgzdy ), 
  when i was little , i would crush huff n. puff without a sweat . 
  i had friends who 'd get to chapter six then call me in to beat huff n. puff using my ` magic touch ' . 
  i was the mariano rivera of paper mario . 
  come college , meet girl we hit it off and we 've been dating for 3 years . 
  i recently set up an n64 for us to play drunk mario kart or any other games . 
  welp , she got paper mario from her brother . 
  she could never beat , you guessed it , huff . 
  for a surprise gift , i beat huff and got her to the save point before the crystal king 's palace . 
  needless to say , she loved it . 
  albeit , she was pissed i did n't tell her how to beat huff . 
  snowball 's chance in hell the miltank was nasty ( dirty chikorita picker here ) . 
  the worst was the stupid piloswine from pryce . 
  holy . 
  shit . 
  i hated that stupid thing . 
  i would stack my team to beat him . 
  * lolfuckyouicywind * crits all day lose everytime . 
  still bitter . 
  not necessarily every rengar player . 
  let 's not throw all of us into a pot of flaming . 
  that 's like saying anyone who plays riven or vayne will tilt if and spam `` gg noob team '' if they get ganked . 
  most rengars , if they play the kill right , will nab the kill without much resistance . 
  absolutely not man . 
  rengar main here floating a 65 % -70 % winrate lately ( 55 % overall ) . 
  it just slows you down . 
  why spend the money on the enchantment when i will 99 % sell blazer after i finish my holy trinity . 
  as a control warrior player , i was sitting there continually saying . 
  `` no fucking way . 
  no fucking way . 
  way . '', 
  i felt bad for this guy . 
  why the fuck would you let malygos win . 
  holy shit 20 damage mindblast, 
   together they suck, 
  s c u k. . 
  says the clg fan top kek, 
  if cw somehow manages to win , i will buy a cake get the cw logo on it . 
  make a video dancing to 1000 miles then slam face into the aforementioned cake . 
  i was fortunate enough to see l'hermione at the south street seaport a week ago . 
  it was amazing to see the artistry put into the ship . 
  yes , it was the re-created version . 
  but it was still amazing to see . 
  i 'm currently at work but will update the comment with the pictures later . 
  hydra lw youmoo my friend . 
  no need to worry . 
  elements has this in el bagerino, 
  do n't worry . 
  well take good care of freeze next split . 
  i mean you guys took shook . 
  i really doubt it 's freeze . 
  i bayleef . 
  asked my girlfriend . 
  were both young 20s been dating for over two years . 
  her answer : you 're still a kid , no matter how i try you 're always a kid . 
  plus , seeing you around toddlers is freaking adorable .
