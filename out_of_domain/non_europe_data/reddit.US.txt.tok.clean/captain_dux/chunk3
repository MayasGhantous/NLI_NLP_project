  but sh ... 
  i did n't tell you . 
  take some insulin for dat homeboi . 
  shhh . . shh ... no tears . 
  justice soon, 
  sure !, 
  mick is just a term kinda like `` china-man '' or `` vietkong '' . 
  when the japanese and vietnamese immigrated during the war they were disliked . 
  because fear of treason or fear of stealing american life . 
  mick is a term used to generalize the irish . 
  when they immigrated they used to work a lot of the lower end jobs . 
  eg construction like my grandparents and parents . 
  so , to use the phrase in action . 
  that stupid mick took my job . 
  imagine the dumb rednecks in south park . 
  haha, 
  heh , it wasnt bad from my end in the back . 
  in due time my friend .
