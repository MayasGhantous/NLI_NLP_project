  i walk into the house to see everyone coddling ham-man-tha as she stuffs her face with cake and brownies . 
  i look confused , what 's going on . 
  at the sight of me , she screams `` you did this ! '' . 
  * allofmywhats.life * apparently , she alleged i threatened to tell everyone a nasty rumor if she did n't let me escape . 
  notice , everyone was coddling the ham except gurgash . 
  i would never do this . 
  this was a giant red flare in my mind . 
  the deceiver 's mom walks in and says we need alone time to talk it out . 
  [ please wait !, 
  i can be good !, 
  ] ( http://thefreybaby.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/ipi_please_wait.gif?w=480 ) i am innocent !, 
  guys cmon !, 
  the door is slammed shut , we are alone . 
  me and the beast . 
  she looks at me expectantly , but still licking her mighty lips . 
  [ heavy breathing ensues ] ( http://stream1.gifsoup.com/webroot/animatedgifs7/3217531_o.gif ), 
   ham-man-tha ; was n't my plan genius ? 
  are n't i so smart dux-y . 
   dux ; you got ta stop calling me that . 
  what do you mean ? 
  you outright lied !, 
   ham-man-tha ; oh silly dux , of course i did !, 
  it 's how we girls get what we want . 
  we lie tee ^ hee ^ hee ^ hee !, 
  i knew we would n't be alone otherwise . 
  now , i got ta make you feel better for earlier . 
  i really need to show you a real kiss . 
  oh my god , flashback . 
  freaking flash backs . 
  i slowly recount all she ate . 
  add it in with her death of breath from before . 
  your valiant night shant be shamed !, 
  i panic , how can i alert others to come back in . 
  i know !, 
  knock on the . 
  urggg . 
  oh no not again . 
  guys , it happened , i threw up on the hambeast . 
  i got so nervous so fast i puked . 
  i puked on the ham-beast . 
  it was awful . 
  thus she bellowed in rage , then she screamed `` ew omg what the hell !, 
  he 's throwing up again !! '', 
  i was whisked away into the safety of another room . 
  mrs. deceiver felt so bad she made me sit alone with gurgash . 
  he laughed and laughed , telling me that 's not how to swoon . 
  * ass-hole * of course , sick in the eyes , mouth , and face . 
  i lumber off . 
  i ride my trusty steed backhome . 
  little did i know , a new storm was brewing . 
  part 4 ; cybernetic revenge . 
  first time poster , etc , etc , etc. 
  i used to be , well , gracious in portions to say the least . 
  i was fat , i 'll be brutal . 
  this is the time to vent right ? 
  i was freaking fat , i was 6 ' 5 '' and 260 lbs of depression and fat . 
  i hated myself . 
  i had a tragic knee injury that ended my athletic career . 
  i felt like i was alone , i had friends , but i was kind of alone . 
  no one really understood what i was thinking . 
  i was sad because i lost all i cared for , sports . 
  so , i decided to stop being a mopey piece of garbage and go insane in the gym . 
  cut the garbage out of my diet ( less cheat days ! ), 
  and run 10ks for fun , workout six days a week , eat cleaner than a store-bought whistle . 
  you name it , i did it . 
  in fact , i dropped 50 pounds by my freshman year of college . 
  i was only slightly impressed . 
  despite everywhere i went people would be stunned at my transformation . 
  i went from fat to overtly fit . 
  yet this is where my battle began . 
  i still see the same doughboy in the mirror . 
  everyday i do n't see happiness . 
  i see what i need to keep improving . 
  i work harder and harder every time to see very little progress . 
  weight gain terrifies me , i ca n't stand the scale . 
  every pound is like a stab in the back . 
  a lash backwards . 
  so i work harder . 
  i float at a `` healthy '' 6 ' 5 '' and 215 pounds of mass . 
  i am stronger than anyone i know for my age and height . 
  yet , i still do n't like what i see . 
  i guess i 'm scared i 'm still the fat kid . 
  i have a beautiful girlfriend , my first really serious relationship . 
  i love this girl to death , i would do anything for her . 
  she has been so supportive of me through this , but my constant obsession with health makes her worry about me . 
  i really want to change and get over this fear , for her . 
  i love the girl and ca n't stand the thought of losing her . 
  i will take any advice , i want to fight the man in the mirror . 
  i have wrestled with doubts , i won . 
  i fought with the demon of fat , i triumphed . 
  i can beat this , i just need to get this off my chest . 
  hello you dumplings . 
  after a hiatus in the mountains with some good friends and family , i am back . 
  i will continue the ham-man-tha saga soon however , this weekend in the mountains gave me a moment of clarity . 
  a moment free of the [ land whales , hooray for no land whales ! ] ( http://www.myfacewhen.net/view/6203-creepy-dog ) . 
  of course , my reprieve from the whales was short lived , [ much to your delight ! ] ( http://www.myfacewhen.net/view/1998-hahahahahaha ) . 
  so now , i will recount the tale of a ~ ~ friend ~ ~ ~ ~ immobile human replica of the mouth of hell ~ ~ ~ ~ human replica of the michelin man ~ ~ thing i know from working out . 
  the star studded lineup ;, 
   be me on a good day ; captain_dux ( dux for short ) . 
  6 ' 5 '' and 215 lbs .
