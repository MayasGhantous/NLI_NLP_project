  training for half marathons and running religiously . 
  still struggle with body issues such as image , but that is minor . 
   be gym friends ; a rag-tag group of friends who go to the gym the same time i do . 
  we spot each other and have a merry time . 
   by the love of zeus do not . 
  i repeat do not !, 
  a beast that was approximately 5 ' 6 '' and easily a solid 350 lbs of fupa and haes . 
  avid ball state fan , ( because he played there he claims ) and is a die hard believer he is still healthy . 
  so , first day back from a relaxing weekend at the mountains . 
  what is my first plan of action ? 
  to go to the gym !, 
  i leave my girlfriend 's apartment and run to the gym for a quick workout . 
  i do my normal [ cardio circuit ] ( http://www.myfacewhen.net/view/6313-lol ) before heading the free-weight area . 
  i walk over to the bench press and run into some of the gym buddies . 
  today we 're all feeling adventurous and decide to go above body weight for reps. 
  suddenly , the earth splinters . 
  zeus has open the gates of hell . 
  demons and the infantry of the damned flood the gym . 
  the smell of burning flesh has started to overtake the remaining precious oxygen . 
  [ this can not be my bitter end ! ] ( http://www.myfacewhen.net/view/241-i-am-disgust ) . 
  no , wait , false alarm guys . 
  fupa-ham-chew just finished his light ~ ~ mosey on the treadmill at speed negative snail ~ ~ marathon prep to go bench with us . 
  fupa waddles over and sees what i 'm warming up with . 
  i am going around 215 for warm up then moving to 275 for reps. fupa scoffs . 
   fupa : heh , the load ca n't even lift a little less than me . 
  try eating some protein , you wo n't be so fat and actually gain muscle . 
  now the gym bros know i have a serious body image problem . 
  being a former rising planet , i fight like hell to stay in shape . 
  another thing i work with is my temper , it can be as explosive and devious as my strength and passion in the gym is . 
  so i stop and stare at the beast . 
  i move the weight up to 225 . 
  i [ smirk ] ( http://www.myfacewhen.net/view/3202-joey-ehhhh ) . 
   dux : fupa , if you are so strong . 
  show me what you 're made of . 
  you 're an old ball player . 
  show me that o-line strength boy !, 
  he puffs up his ~ ~ glorious globules of man breast ~ ~ awesome rocking chest . 
  he sits down onto the bench , i hear it wheeze the final words . 
  this is the end . 
  he demands i spot him . 
   fupa : this is how a real strong arm does it . 
  watch and learn nerds . 
  so i stand behind him , stifling a laugh as [ best i could !, 
  ] ( http://www.myfacewhen.net/view/3292-hahas ) off with the force of 1,000 value meals fupa-ham-chew raises the bar !, 
  his arms are shaking like a tree in hurricane katrina . 
  [ gym buddies are watching idly ] ( http://www.myfacewhen.net/view/3646-i-came ) and i am focusing on his ~ ~ bust that rivaled pam anderson ~ ~ form . 
  down goes the bar and low and behold . 
  it thuds onto his chest . 
  not the best form , but hey , if he gets a rep good for him . 
  fupa begins to push the weight out [ making the most strained face i have laid eyes upon ] ( http://www.myfacewhen.net/view/780-well-derp ) . 
  he pushes with all his might , the result of his labor was a loud wet fart . 
  now i was too busy laughing to remember the ham is dying . 
  my friends actually had to help him up . 
  he is [ angered ! ] ( http://www.myfacewhen.net/view/1333-i-mad] . 
   fupa : you asshole you almost killed me !, 
  i was too busy repping out and you left me to die !, 
  yes , i did endanger the ham , but cmon . 
  he farted during a rep !, 
   dux : yeah i shoulda had that spot , but dude , you barely got a lift off . 
  not even close to a rep. you ca n't call me fat dude , you 're built like a krispy kreme . 
  [ uh oh ] ( http://www.myfacewhen.net/view/2118-did-i-say-that ) it was word vomit . 
  i said a bad word . 
  i said the kk word and attributed it to him . 
  he was about as red as a cherry tomato . 
  in his mighty ham rage , fupa-ham-chew unleashed secret fat attack combo 1 . 
  the blind rage punch , he swings with the velocity of a dying sloth . 
  i dodge , and the ham punches the wall . 
  ham is now crying , and i am sitting there with [ no pity , he swung at me ] ( http://www.myfacewhen.net/view/3697-coem-at-me-bor ) . 
  the ham marches off , he says he will never workout with an indignant and a racist ever again . 
  i turn to my friends and ask , how am i racist ? 
  they came to tell me fupa is a firm believer that it is a race to be fat or thin . 
  e.g ; you are a thin white male captain_dux . 
  sally is a medium build asian girl . 
  bobby is a stocky black man . 
  etc etc. 
  fupa * firmly * believes that race should include body type . 
  so his fatassery is apparently a race . 
  so therefore , i am a discriminatory , racist , shitlord . 
  [ sue me ] ( http://www.myfacewhen.net/view/3316-sdasdd ) . 
  i am stunned that this ham thinks being obese is a race . 
  a flipping race . 
  i mean i cant decide if he is ignorant or just really really deep in the fat logic . 
  please discuss . 
  feel free to ask about my workout regiment . 
  i love to talk !, 
  you guys are great . 
  more to come soon !, 
  howdy y' all gud lil dumplins ' , y' all ready to fill up on some duxy 's good ol' word stewing ? 
  i know you all are fixin ' to get some [ moar good ol' beetus . 
  ] ( http://www.sharenator.com/image/143512/ ), 
  i spent these past for weeks or so in the mountains . 
  it was serene , ii got to unwind and spend sometime with family , friends , and m ` lady . 
  i totally suggest mountain weekends to all . 
  however , do n't play pictionary . 
  you may end up yelling a lot and screaming over why someone ca n't guess what your drawing of a tattoo is . 
  anyway , onto the meat you shitlords . 
  ** warning not too much fatlogic here , this is a stepping stone to the logic ** * i dont want you to be left in the dark . 
  so we last recounted that ham-man-tha face raped me , vomit is a viable defense , and i am a beta little shitlord brewing . 
  your star studded cast ladies and gents !, 
   probably do n't captain_dux ; maybe be captain_dux ; awkward chubby middle school kid .
