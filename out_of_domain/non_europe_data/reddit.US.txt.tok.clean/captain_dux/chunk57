  i wrestled , played a lot of world of warcraft ( lok ` tar ogar ! ), 
  6 ' tall . 
  easily 220 ( heavier than i am now . 
  woops ) the victim of a cybernetic war . 
   snaps ; m'lady from afar at the time . 
  too beta to make a move , later learned she had a massive crush on me . 
  later lost interest because of my beta mentality . 
   please by hades fortune do n't be ham-man-tha ; the pure definition of evil incarnate . 
  perpetual face-rapist . 
  great target for practicing projectile vomitting . 
  300 lbs of love and infatuation . 
  so after my terrible vomit scene , i biked home . 
  remember heart of a champion , need to persevere through pain . 
  so off i go to play wow and [ kill some boars ] ( http://southpark.cc.com/clips/09c7ww/living-to-win ) . 
  now for those of you who are n't familiar , during my age group aim was the cat 's pajamas . 
  you needed to have an aim to survive in my little town . 
  [ honey badger do n't care if you did n't want it ] ( http://www.firstcovers.com/index.php?site=image&id=896727&case=users ) you needed aim . 
  so , generally while geeking out doing world of warcraft stuff , i 'd leave aim open in the background . 
  so i would periodically check it to see if i had messages . 
  now here is the start of the cybernetic attacks . 
  times will not be accurate and names will be changed to protect the innocent ( ham-man-tha cough * cough * ) . 
  at the party , when i had a spare moment to make awkward talk with snaps i mentioned aim . 
  she said she 'd add me . 
  [ victory for me , contact is made . 
  we did it ! ] ( http://img4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130911004635/dragonball/images/9/94/aww_yeah.png ) . 
  she told me she 'd add me when she gets home . 
  now , here is the tricky part . 
  the beast must have over heard this . 
  this angered the beast , so the clock began . 
  ** side note to the audience ** snaps was sleeping over at the deceiver 's house . 
  i did n't know this because ~ ~ the beetus god 's hate me ~ ~ ~ ~ i am a horrible vindictive human being ~ ~ life is funny in some ways . 
  so i log on and see a request . 
  let 's call the account redhead_snap69 . 
  so i see this . 
  omg she added me , so hype , very wow . 
  [ ensue heavy breathing ] ( http://www.reactiongifs.com/r/ovrjy.gif ) . 
  so i calmly accept and shoot her a message . 
  the dialog begins now . 
  the assault starts here , this is the ground zero . 
  [ the final stand begins ! ] ( http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/10/04/article-1218082-06b34b6b000005dc-616_468x286.jpg ) .

   redhead_snaps69 ; uhhhh , dux , you alive yet ? 
   dux ; yeah , so . 
  . your friend ? 
  she 's tall , muscular , and easily your type !,

   dux ; nobody goes to my matches . 
  literally no one except ham-man-tha . 
  she is no where near my type , lol . 
   redhead_snaps ; look at her !, 
  she 's muscular as hell . 
  why would n't she be !, 
  scared of a bigger girl . 
   dux ; if you mean scared she will eat me , yeah . 
  if i owned this dog , he would do this to me [ at that moment .

   redhead_snaps69 ; omg you 're such a douche !, 
  what the fuck dux !,

   dux ; she attacked me , i try and turn her away . 
  she ca n't take a hint . 
  redhead_snaps69 ; you just hate her because she is fat . 
  she is the sweetest kindest nicest woman alive !, 
  she just wants the best for you . 
   dux ; ( now mad ) want the truth ? 
  she is n't nice .
