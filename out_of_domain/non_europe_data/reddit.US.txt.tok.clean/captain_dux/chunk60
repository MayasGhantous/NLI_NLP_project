  your hand wrapped around my finger . 
  you could n't talk , the medicines had ravaged your body and left you too weak to talk . 
  we had to help feed you , it was so painful to watch . 
  above all else , i remember carrying you to the bed where you would eventually die . 
  i was the last person to hold you before you passed . 
  i remember crying like a little kid putting you down . 
  i remember being so angry i broke through two layers of sheetrock because i punched a wall . 
  i remember driving to the top of the hills in my little hometown and screaming until i lost my voice . 
  i remember , waking up on memorial day and knowing you died . 
  you made it six months exactly from your diagnosis . 
  the doctor was good , really good infact . 
  he guessed the time you would die perfectly . 
  he was n't being cruel , he had just become jaded by seeing countless pancreatic cancer deaths . 
  i do n't blame him , i infact honor him . 
  your funeral was a blur , i only remember reading a speech in front of the entire family . 
  i told myself i would n't cry . 
  instead , i delivered the speech . 
  without referencing the paper but once . 
  i remember looking at the audience and seeing everyone else 's face . 
  tears were streaming down their face . 
  but one face stood out . 
  my mother was in hysterics . 
  i lost it then . 
  i ca n't remember what you looked like before the treatment . 
  i ca n't remember those good times we laughed and cried about at christmas . 
  i still struggle to remember what we did for my sixteenth birthday together because `` it was a big one , so let 's go crazy '' . 
  all i know is i miss you like hell . 
  i just wish i could have done more to help you . 
  i guess , i will remember getting this off my chest . 
  i have a wonderful mic . 
  i am fairly experienced in healing prior to mw . 
  i would prefer :, 
   warrior , hunter , me, 
   warrior , mage , me, 
  but anything will work !, 
  add me !,

  hello you fat-shaming shitlords . 
  i recently have had a battery of health issues that i am trying to correct . 
  i recently had a battery of tests that left me feeling weak , had exam stress with uni , and a perfect storm that kept me away from you lovable lard grazers . 
  [ now i imagine you looked like this until now . 
  ] ( http://www.dvorak.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/angry_mob_by_acwraith.jpg ) now , after one my recent battery of medical exams i was left starving and told to eat a substantial meal by my doctor . 
  i left the office feeling woozy . 
  so i decide to call my girlfriend and say let 's get food , my treat . 
  now , i did n't witness this , this is second hand from girlfriend . 
  * your cast of shitlords and shit-loads *, 
   probably do n't want to be capt_dux - your average college student . 
  health issues and stress do n't mix well at all . 
  my year has n't started strong but i will rebound . 
  6 ' 5 '' and 215 lbs . 
   be her , please be my wonderful woman ( here on out ww ) - dating here for quite some time now . 
  been with me through my rocky year . 
  even came with me to my medical exams . 
  i really do love this girl . 
  ca n't figure out why she likes me . 
   great odin give me strength if you are - ham-ulous crime the maw of agony ( here on out know as ham-ulous ) the mighty beast with a maw like a black hole . 
  there is an old saying about this beast somewhere . 
  something about the abyss staring back into you . 
  she was apparently `` short like me , but as wide as me laying on my back '' . 
  so , i finished a day at the hospital as mentioned prior . 
  ww decided she would drive me to the nearest moe 's in our college town and get me a burrito . 
  i gave her my card and said get something you want too . 
  ** side note : she did n't use my card , [ why do n't you ladies take my money !, 
  ] ( http://procrasti-nation.eu/wp-content/uploads/shut-up-and-take-my-money.jpg ) ** anyway , i used the app to order in advance . 
  our local shop offered a deal because if you used the app and some special coupon you got free burritos . 
  sweet deal !, 
  so i felt like i was going to pass out because i had been up all night and wanted sleep . 
  ww takes over here as this is her time to shine . 
  to crusade against the legions of saturated fats and such . 
  ww walks into moe 's , and the que is obviously huge . 
  they offering free burritos to kids if you order it . 
  it 's a college town , it was thirsty thursday . 
  do the math people . 
  so into the queue she goes . 
  suddenly , the earth shifts off it 's orbit . 
  the sidewalk splinters under the mighty force of an orbital collision . 
  worlds have started to collide . 
  no wait , it 's ham-ulous some of her ~ ~ cronies ~ ~ moonions . 
  surprise , surprise ham-ulous and her moonions have ordered the free burrito and got into the queue . 
  ww begin nice said hi and made small talk . 
  joking about the wait . 
  first mistake , she engaged the ham in it 's element . 
  a purveyor of food . 
  not only and food , easy access `` tex-mex '' . 
   ww : hah , is n't this queue way too long . 
  i did n't realize that many people like burritos . 
   ham-ulous : this is bullshit , i have low enzyme levels ( the fuck bro ) and need to eat . 
  i was feeling faint . 
  * moonions grumble in agreement chirping about paying for queso *, 
   ww : oh , i 'm here for my boyfriend and i. 
  he just got out of the hospital so we need food . 
   ham-ulous : you do n't need to lie , it 's fine if you ordered two burritos . 
  i did . 
  * moonions chirp and squee in excitement *, 
   ww : no seriously . 
  look , he 's the kid who 's on his phone in that blue ~ ~ mercedes ~ ~ shitmobile . 
  wait , he 's asleep . 
   ham-ulous : that kid is yours ? 
  ~ ~ how did you get him to love you . ~ ~ how is he sick ? 
  he looks healthy , ca n't be ** that ** sick .
