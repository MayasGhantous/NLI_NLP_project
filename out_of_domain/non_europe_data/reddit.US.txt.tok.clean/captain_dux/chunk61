  okay , so this ham is trying to pick a fight from my understanding . 
  no cares given , i 'm snoozing in the car . 
   ww : yeah he really is , he is very active so he does n't look sick at all . 
   ham-ulous : so he 's like me , i work out all the time at derpstein campus gym and i have the beetus , hypertension , and bad knees . 
  ww sees an outlet , aha , dux is hypertensive and has bad knees . 
  i really drew the crap shoot on the genetic lottery . 
  my mom is stage iii arthritic at 55 . 
  her knees click when she walks , it 's bad . 
  i had a complete knee reconstruction no more than two years ago . 
  ** damn you wrestling/football ** so guess where i am going . 
  ww : oh wow , dux has hypertension and has awful knees . 
  if he was awake you two would probably be able to share ** health ** advice . 
  ham-ulous : i do n't need help trust me tee ^ hee . 
  i am a perfectly healthy ~ ~ eat monster ~ ~ lady . 
  ww has grown tired and tunes her out . 
  10 minutes pass and this is not ample feeding time for our growing blackhole . 
  so she sits down in a chair while on line . 
  eventually her rage has grown to a critical mass and she bellows . 
   ham-ulous : this line is too damned slow . 
  i need my food now . 
  granted , fifteen minutes would be long if you ordered in advance . 
  now , remember , the entire university is essentially ordering burritos . 
  this poor four man army of moe 's slaves are drowning in burritos and angry college kids / college planets . 
  ham-ulous incites her moonions to become angry . 
   ham-ulous and the moonions : we demand to see your manager you are denying me and my friends food . 
  manager sits them down and tries to explain what i mentioned above , they are swamped and want nothing but the best for the moonions and ham-ulous . 
  there are whale songs of how they are [ starving ] ( http://canadajournal.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/1-in-5-youths-overweight-or-obese-survey.jpg ) . 
  finally , ww gets our food . 
  the moonions notice and shout `` hey she got her food what the hell ! '' . 
   ham-ulous : give me your food , i am beyond faint and need it now . 
   ww ( kinda pissed ) : no , this is for my boyfriend and i. 
  you ordered your own your up next anyway . 
  go away . 
  whale song continues about discriminashun and condishuns . 
  tl ; dr : queso and free burrtios make college workers suffer hell and attracts throngs of whales . 
  i am also a sick kid . 
  so for those who do n't remember , my earlier years were plagued by a horrid beast that would try to ~ ~ mate with my face ~ ~ ~ ~ assume i was a tastey snickity-snack ~ ~ make lovey dovey heart eyes at me . 
  of course , i would [ gracefully turn her down ] ( http://img.pandawhale.com/post-25055-nope-adventure-time-gif-aigh.gif ) . 
  again , this is another set up piece . 
  i am going to show you the best insight i have . 
  i hope you giblets enjoy it !, 
  so i will now tell you a three part story . 
  this story all took place over a weekend trip to washington dc with my eighth grade class . 
  so , without further rambling and nonsense . 
  i want to into a new way of the characters . 
   on the off chance you are captain_dux ( how are you omg i wan na meet me then ) : be an awkward and chubby video game nerd . 
  wrestling was my life and probably veggie pizza . 
  have a terrifying gag reflex . 
  ham attractant and wow extraordinaire . 
  huge confidence boost after i started believing in myself . 
   you can be mrs. brimstone : an angry esl teacher we had at our school . 
  she survived human trafficking in some third world nation . 
  would n't tell us where she is from . 
  taker of no shit , and breaker of wills . 
  kinda looked like this [ figure ] ( http://skymovies.sky.com/image/unscaled/2011/04/14/horrid-henry-the-movie-01-4.jpg ) . 
   by the great boon of the mighty overlords do not fucking be ham-man-tha : the bane of my existence . 
  a beast of epic proportions tee ^ motha ^ fuckity ^ hee ^ shitlords this beast was rumored to live in the deep grounds below , to only arise for meals and to hunt for a suitable mate . 
  unfortunately , i was on the beast 's hunting path . 
  there was no stopping her . 
  her breath was death , her stare was rays of the blazing sun , her maw was famine . 
   do n't be our surprise guests . 
  so , before we went to dc our school corralled the entire eighth grade student body into an old gymnasium at 5 am . 
  no problem for me , i was up by then daily for some unholy reason . 
  i immediately sat down next to my wrestling buddies and began to talk about which girls we wanted to take to our `` formal dinner dance '' . 
  most girls had this [ reaction ] ( http://cdn4.gurl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/tumblr_leqtkcawca1qcnhhzo1_500.gif ) which was n't surprising . 
  i , of course , was still in ** fat ** uated with snaps . 
  i had my target zeroed in like a marksman , i would n't be stopped . 
  suddenly , the earth shattered . 
  the windows caved in . 
  the principal screamed in peril , `` it 's a tornado !, 
  well , it was a tornado of sorts . 
  it was a whirlwind of mcbeetus griddle cakes , and hair . 
  it was ham-man-tha in her `` i woke up like dis , hammy '' look . 
  i am guessing she noticed me , damn my faulty hiding strategy . 
  being tall really foils that plan a good amount . 
  i see her lumbering over , [ oh god please do n't communicate with me . 
  ] ( http://gifsec.com/wp-content/uploads/gif/2014/05/terrified-reaction-gif.gif ) my wrestling buddies stuck around to help ward the beast . 
  sadly , this was a failed venture . 
  before you know it , ham-man-tha split . 
  there were two new moons in her titanic orbit . 
  each licking their lips , trying to be cute and prepared to flirt . 
  they were about as sexy as [ this ] ( http://www.reactiongifs.com/r/icream.gif ) . 
  so we sit and brace for planetary collision . 
  long time no talk big man !, 
  have you met my cuties ? 
  margorie heffer and lauren lards-alot ? 
  ( here on out heffer and lards ), 
  * i knew them , they went to our sister school . 
  if you wanted , you could go to an earlier dc trip if you paid in advance . 
  f me . 
  they paid and went with the beast *, 
   dux : oh yeah , i know them . 
  how are ya doin ' ? 
  me and the guys were just going to pack and lea ... 
   ham-man-tha and the moons : we 'd love to sit !, 
   dux : oh awesome , hey 165 and 185 , you two need to meet these girls . 
  they are really nice . 
  inside my head : * i learned , i am not going down alone you sneaky sobs *, 
   dux : ham , look , we have a bad past . 
  leave me alone on the field trip .
