  i kissed snaps , ham sat in her feces for two hours . 
  cried about discrimination . 
  brimstone yelled and scared the fear of god into me and my friends . 
  [ in our next episode !, 
  ] ( http://www.reactiongifs.com/r/jwgutv7.gif ) all you can eat buffets are a challenge . 
  tl ; dr : twerkin ' so hard pants gon na hate me . 
  edit : formatting 2pro4u, 
  hi there . 
  i am a 2k exp mw with a fresh horde start . 
  i am currently 1750 cr looking to push 2.2 k. 
  please let me know if you are interested at all . 
  hello you sugar-lump dumpling fisters . 
  i have been up all night ~ ~ to get lucky ~ ~ ~ ~ save struggling kittens from a burning shelter ~ ~ riddled with exams , so sleep deprivation is fun . 
  for some reason my half jogged mind found it a great idea to regale a tale of ham-man-tha and the time i used assassin 's creed esque wall climbing to achieve two things . 
  only in time will we learn what this was . 
  ] ( http://www.reactiongifs.com/r/dmtf.gif ), 
  onto our cast of characters :, 
   on the off chance you are captain_dux ( how are you omg i wan na meet me then ) : be an awkward and chubby video game nerd . 
  wrestling was my life and probably veggie pizza . 
  have a terrifying gag reflex . 
  ham attractant and wow extraordinaire . 
  huge confidence boost after i started believing in myself . 
   be snaps : a visage of beauty that would always lure me back . 
   you can be mrs. brimstone : an angry esl teacher we had at our school . 
  she survived human trafficking in some third world nation . 
  would n't tell us where she is from . 
  taker of no shit , and breaker of wills . 
  kinda looked like that teacher from recess . 
   by the great boon of the mighty overlords do not fucking be ham-man-tha : the bane of my existence . 
  a beast of epic proportions tee ^ mothafuckity ^ hee ^ shitlords this beast was rumored to live in the deep grounds below , to only arise for meals and to hunt for a suitable mate . 
  unfortunately , i was on the beast 's hunting path . 
  there was no stopping her . 
  her breath was death , her stare was rays of the blazing sun , her maw was famine . 
   do n't be our surprise guests . 
  so we finally arrived at the ~ ~ cheaper than a bottle of taaka ~ ~ high-brow fancy hotel in dc . 
  there was a wonderful garden in the center . 
  now , here is a key fact about the garden . 
  the hotel was built around it . 
  there where ledges around each ring that had certain flowers planted in them . 
  we arrived around mid-day so brimstone boomed over the children demanding we go to our rooms and place everything in there . 
  we were randomly assigned locations . 
  once we were done placing our luggage down , we were to meet in a ~ ~ torture cell ~ ~ grandiose ballroom . 
  now i took the stairs to the second floor and saw snaps . 
  the girl ran over and hugged me saying she was in room 2xx . 
  i was in a room three doors down . 
  she told me we could finally hangout . 
  [ successs ] ( http://www.reactiongifs.com/r/pbs1.gif ) . 
  suddenly , a surprise happens . 
  she kissed me ran off and said see you in an hour . 
  boy was i on cloud nine , it was a perfect day in the clouded area i now associate with dc . 
  however , this gigantic ^ teehee step i took would be tripped up by a glob-like beast . 
  we eventually made our way downstairs , my friend group started to mingle with the girls who were in snap 's tow . 
  it was pretty awesome , i got to be with my wresting friends , snaps with me , 8th grade was worry free . 
  of course , this is a tale of ham-man-tha , where would be without her ruining the [ party . 
  ] ( http://www.reactiongifs.com/r/stnfck.gif ), 
  no earth shattering , no windows bowing , and no sound of hooves in the distance . 
  rather , we find our heroes stuck on cloud nine . 
  snaps and i are talking about how goofy brimstone looks in `` relaxed '' clothing . 
  our wonderful conversation was interrupted when ham-man-tha grabbed my shoulders . 
  she was ~ ~ preparing to eat me ~ ~ getting her [ sexy face on . 
  ] ( http://www.reactiongifs.com/r/zumbmk0.gif ), 
   ham-man-tha ; dux , you 're coming with me to derpdeherp middle school dc bash . 
   dux ; hah , good one ham , but i uh got a date with snaps . 
  . you see we . . . 
   ham-man-tha ; youre coming with me or ill make you come . 
  i wo n't be turned away , i know better than this . 
   dux : ham [ leave us alone or i 'll get brimstone . 
  ] ( http://www.reactiongifs.com/r/334.gif ), 
  she stormed off if a whirlwind of dorritos dust . 
  snaps turned me to me stifling a laugh jokingly saying i had a `` killer '' date to the formal dance for our class . 
  i stabbed back she can just go stag if she really wants . 
  surprisingly she laughed and all was well . 
  brimstone called us to this room with faculty to make some baseline announcements . 
  rule one ) no staying in an opposite sex members ' room . 
  if you are found guilt . 
  big trouble . 
  rule 2 ) do n't leave your room past curfew for any reason . 
  we will be placing a piece of tape on the doors to know who left the rooms . 
  rule 3 ) be respectful yada yada . 
  . i stopped paying attention after `` the big two '' . 
  after an eventful and wonderful meeting we went back to our rooms to change for a surprise from the faculty . 
  snaps and i hung out in the lobby because we were already dressed and did n't want to lounge in the rooms . 
  my friends went upstairs to put on `` real clothes '' . 
  in other words , jeans and a hoodie . 
  the school congregated in the lobby after everyone freshened up . 
  our principal and science teacher ( graduating class chair ) stood up and announced we wouldnt be going to some theater show . 
  the theater was under construction due to a ceiling collapse . 
  instead , we would be have a first time ever , all you can eat pizza party . 
  all of my whats went out the window . 
  a pizza party , catered by the school , it 's all i can eat , and i have m ` lady that is actually wanting to talk to me . 
  lord it 's a wondaful day-ah . 
  we all file into the same room before except it is n't as dreary . 
  imagine a room filled with just pizza . 
  it was almost [ magical ] ( http://www.reactiongifs.com/r/xwoa.gif ) to see . 
  they even had my favorite , veggie pizza . 
  ironically i distinctly remember snaps saying she loved it too . 
  so we bonded over that . 
  it was great . 
  now , i will never forget what i witnessed . 
  the sheer willpower it took for ham to do this was astonishing .
