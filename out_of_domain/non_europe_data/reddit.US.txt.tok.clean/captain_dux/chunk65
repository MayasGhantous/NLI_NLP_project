  ( i 'm big but i wo n't hurt you unless you give me a reason to ) . 
  anyway , as a bouncer our job is to make sure people `` seem to be '' who they are the license . 
  this tale is about my encounter with a `` regular '' at our bar . 
  i pray this does n't evolve into something more . 
  ** characters **, 
   dux : a bouncer at some beatdown college bar . 
  6 ' 5 '' of fake i.d snatching , drunk thwarting , party pooping shitlord . 
   mikey : my co-worker for the night . 
  a grizzled vet of the bouncing scene . 
  looks like [ this ] ( http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mf5s5tgycb1rbrja2.gif ) . 
  homeboy has seen some shit . 
   drunk college kids : going out because wohooo no parents !, 
   : drunk , dazed , & disorderly ( ddd ) : our wonderful orbital star . 
  the woman who solely defied science and alcohol tolerance . 
  as stated , my job is to make sure your id is n't too fake or you are n't too [ drunk ] ( http://cdn77.sadanduseless.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/1911.jpg ) before you try and enter my bar . 
  do n't be a moron and i 'll tell you be good . 
  we have our normal clientele coming in around my shift . 
  sorority girls , frat guys , frosh with their fakes , single superiors , and the lonelies looking to boost their feelings . 
  my shift is fairly normal until i see a mass of people heading for my bar . 
  me and mikey stiffen out and brace out the white girl storm . 
  we let majority of the girls in without issue , no fakes , no problems . 
  however , there was one id that was about as real as a three dollar bill . 
  i look at the id and see a picture of a black girl from xyz state who is 6 ' 0 '' . 
  i look up , i see a missing oompa loompa who probably stole the id . 
  i proceed to follow protocol with a fake id . 
   dux : ma 'm i have reason to believe this is either fake or ** not ** your id . 
  you want to tell me how you got it ? 
   ddd : fuhck yous i ai n't stealun sit . 
  s ' my eye-d . 
  * now i notice i can smell booze on her breath , she 's been pre-gaming and getting hostile . 
  she 's got a good amount of weight on me and about 5 ' 6 '' . 
  i call for mikey to spot me . 
   dux : i never said anything about idenity theft . 
  however , if you did steal it you will be going to jail . 
  now , i 'm [ done being nice ] ( http://www.reactiongifs.com/r/nicki.gif ) . 
  you answer me now , or get the fuck out of my bar . 
  where did you get this id ? 
   ddd : * starts sobbing * i was trying to turn it in !, 
  i swear !, 
  do n't get me in jail * insert whale song about discriminashun and scholarships * . 
  ah , good , you are n't your average level of stupid . 
  you 're special brand of stupid i like to call , iq-room-temperaturous . 
  i now understand why you act the way you do . 
  i grab her id and scan it , yes , this is definitely the man-bear-piglet that is standing before me . 
  i notice she is 20 and grab my marker to cross her off . 
  apparently , following laws that will make me lose my job enrages the beast . 
   ddd : yew ash-hole . 
  i am a grown ash wuhman i can drunk if i want * hic * . 
   dux : fine , go drink , i dare you . 
  i got an officer on call if i see you even sniff a beer . 
  [ try me ] ( http://www.reactiongifs.com/r/sost.gif ) . 
  mikey is stifling a laugh seeing me try and beat common sense into this drunken ham . 
  with a pout she lets me x her out for booze . 
  with a tee ^ hee she stumbles into the bar and says , thanks cutie !, 
  i turn around to see her walking toward our dance floor with a raised stage . 
  i just woke up and am about to head out for my second day . 
  pray for mercy and wish me best . 
  as a thermomter , you just read the situation in your life before you . 
  you react instinctively and almost off of heart and passion . 
  as a thermostat , i feel in control , it 's mundane and by the book but it is safety in control . 
  i just ca n't find the right balance . 
  when i say valuable , i mean it semi loosely . 
  the term value can imply the `` bang for the buck approach '' , or you can even see it as `` this card is a key part of my deck , i need it therefore it is valuable . '', 
  i want to see what people say . 
  this includes class legendaries . 
  lately , i have been on a nasty skid . 
  i fell hard and fast , from rank 8 down to about rank 11 . 
  i know it 's partly on me , making a hasty decision , but when i slowed my game down , i always felt like i still got one upped . 
  i mainly play control warrior . 
  i tinker with the deck based on what i see . 
  what do you do here ? 
  is it mainly me ? 
  is it luck ? 
  is it the vengeful gods of rng ? 
  i know the best advice is to just walk away , but i feel like i could do something to right the ship . 
  yesterday , i wrote about losing streaks . 
  i decided to take a break and listen to music while i play . 
  i timed my turns after my skid started . 
  my turns on average now last about a minute . 
  i also tried swapping my card back for fun . 
  now i am on a tear , ten wins out from my golden warrior and still driving hard . 
  the music i listened to ? 
  while embarrassing , i went to youtube and hit random . 
  i ended up here , https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxls-cpgbe0 . 
  i have not lost since i discovered this song ? 
  tl ; dr snapped my streak because only fux wit hoes who rock dolce and gabbana and a little luck !, 
  hey everyone , i truly wonder where control warrior sits in this meta . 
  since oil rogue is running wild it would make sense that warrior comes roaring back into contention . 
  any thoughts there ? 
  i would appreciate it if you guys dropped a little opinion with my warrior deck too !, 
  i have netted 500 + wins with garrosh , so i am looking to push legend again with warrior . 
  i used to play lol a lot , then something terrible took over me and i got into very competitive hearthstone . 
  i got my goal in hearthstone and continually maintain it . 
  but , that is n't the point of this post . 
  recently , i was placed in b5 because well , my mechanics are n't the best . 
  i want to at least hit silver . 
  i have received some advice and the points are fairly straight forward . 
  - buy wards , gank a lot ( i main jungle ) , do n't feed . 
  - pick three champions , master them , make them yours , win a lot . 
  - do n't tilt and rage at your teammates , they are a reason you win just as much as you are .
