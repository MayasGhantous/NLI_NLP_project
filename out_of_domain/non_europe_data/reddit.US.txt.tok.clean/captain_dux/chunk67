  so , the night before i flew home i downloaded her rom and before i knew it she had a totodile named crocodilly and my chikorita named basil . 
  it 's been just over a month , and our tuesday and thursday skype ritual is to say hi , ask about the week , and play pokemon together . 
  i played a bit on the plane so i have a bit of an edge on her ( okay , more like five badges ) but i help her learn about the game . 
  right now her team is growing fast and she loves pokemon , it 's our thing and it 's helped us stay strong . 
  in the three years we 've been dating we have had a lot of ways to make distance feel close , but this was the best way for sure . 
  so , that 's my story , my girlfriend and i really enjoy our pokemon and time apart . 
  the game made it feel like i never left . 
  right now i am about to take on claire and she is just finishing off morty . 
  for those interested here are the teams :, 
  team dux :, 
  - ** monteloupe ** , the rhyhorn, 
  - ** basil ** , the bayleef, 
  - ** wooly ** , the ampharos, 
  - ** fleek ** , the crobat, 
  - ** brick ** , the quagsire, 
  - ** toesy ** , the dragonair, 
  team girlfriend :, 
  - ** crocodilly ** , the croconaw ( she does n't like him now , he 's not `` cute '' ), 
  - ** marie ** , the mareep, 
  - ** fluffy ** , the furret ( he is her favorite ), 
  - ** slippery ** , the dratini, 
  - ** cutie ** , the eevee, 
  that 's a wrap folks . 
  hope i was n't too boring , 
  edit : i suck at bullets, 
  hi everyone ,, 
  i recently had a stellar irelia game vs an urgot top , i know that 's a losing lane seeing as urgot can poke well . 
  but the weird thing is i won really really hard . 
  i felt like i should have lost and made massive mistakes , it may be me beating myself up , but that 's how i am . 
  may be too rough on myself . 
  below is my op.gg with a replay sitting there on the irelia game in question . 
  ( 12/0/1 for those analyzing ) . 
  * what could i have done better ? 
  * was my cs okay ? 
  * did i have good caluclated aggression ? 
  * were my tp ganks okay ? 
  * tips / tricks ?

  edit : heads up i am very low elo . 
  recently took back to ranked after stopping my hard tilt . 
  much more relaxed and have been winning decently just playing for fun . 
  after two weeks off , i am finally hitting ranked again . 
  i promised i 'd attach some bullet points on what i learned so , here we go !, 
  * ** admit it , you are human and make lots of errors ** this was a hard one , i tried to play meta champs to win and think too much . 
  i made tons of mental errors . 
  tunnel vision , over extension , lack of vision , you name it . 
  i probably made that error . 
  to quote a guy who is helping me learn the game `` your only real strength is you have fantastic mechanical skill , everything else is just crap '' . 
  but remember , because you 're weak today does n't mean you wo n't be the victor tomorrow . 
  * ** focus on your cs ** holy smokes , this was another huge one . 
  after two weeks off i saw just how pitiful my cs was really . 
  in one game back in ranked , i went from averaging 4-5 cs a minite ( yeah i said i was bad ) to approximately 6-7 without thinking . 
  6-7 at the moment is where i feel comfy , but hey i am still learning . 
  i am here to share my notes from my break from ranked . 
  * ** do n't be afraid to pick out of the meta ** i play a ton of rengar , not entirely meta but he makes me happy . 
  if i ca n't rengar my normal , i have two fall-backs i know just as much about . 
  jax and hecarim . 
  they may not be the best top laners ever , but you know what ? 
  i do really damn good with them , and it makes me happy . 
  i know every single matchup for these champions inside and out . 
  pick your holy trinity , grind it up . 
  it 's not bad to be a one trick pony unless you tilt . 
  * ** you are your true self when no one is watching ** this is a little rule i figured out recently . 
  normally , i try to shut up in ranked games . 
  i noticed , a lot of people i played with were just plain vicious in the league games . 
  calling people just atrocious things . 
  `` but he 's a stupid mouth breathing feeder and is bad ! '', 
  do n't care , you would n't call your girlfriend a stupid mouth breather because she forgot to close the door . 
  why ? 
  because sleeping on the couch sucks ( i have a temporary rental contract with my couch during bad times , so trust me i know ) and so does losing . 
  do n't berate , lift . 
  saying `` good use of xyz spell abc ! '', 
  or even `` thanks for the gank fat man :p ( in reference to a gragas gank ) '' makes people laugh and want to win . 
  they know you 're not an jerk and are more willing to help you when you struggle . 
  * ** most importantly , have fun it 's a video game ** this is easy . 
  it 's a game , it wo n't matter tomorrow at the office if you won or lost that ranked game that was an inch from the game winner !, 
  you were so close !, 
  it could have been a win !, 
  my promos !, 
  it does n't matter , tomorrow you will wake up healthy , presumably happy , and walking . 
  think about all the good in your life , one game will not shatter your life . 
  be happy , play for fun , if it is n't fun stop . 
  then come back when it is . 
  i hope this helped you guys , i 'm now b4 after placing out of b5 . 
  i think applying my knowledge really helped and i can see the light at the end of the tunnel . 
  let 's do this . 
  hey everyone , i 'll keep this brief as today is kinda bad . 
  i attend university in south carolina . 
  i was born and raised in the north east . 
  my home state has been depicted as a party scene with beaches that smell like gasoline , you get the picture . 
  anyway , my girlfriend and i are watching the news and i see they may take down the confederate flag in wake of the charleston shooting . 
  i make a quick comment saying `` welp , it 's about damn time '' . 
  my girlfriend of 2 years , born and raised in the land of dixie , was enraged by this . 
  how could i not respect her heritage ? 
  what is wrong with me ? 
  i explain i just see it as a symbol of oppression and hatred , it does n't belong on government grounds . 
  she says it 's not racist , it 's just tradition they are embracing the civil war it 's not for xyz reason why ca n't i accept it . 
  i told her i do , but i signed the petition to take it down . 
  she lost it and we are in just a nasty fight . 
  we 're working it out but man , a stupid flag can really mess things up .
