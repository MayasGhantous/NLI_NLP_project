i joined to say , i think we should all shake hands like this from now on . 
  i noticed this too . 
  the `` good '' bits are still somewhat obfuscated . 
  this may all be true , but i have enough anecdotal evidence for myself that i avoid msg at all costs . 
  i have had too many nights - cowering in my dreams - huddled with my family in the bathroom while rhino-sized dogs , escaped from some fiery chasm in the ground , scratch and lunge at the door . 
  the next morning , i 'll dig through the trash to look at the ingredients on some pre-packaged dinner we had . 
  there it is . 
  no thank you . 
  poorly designed interfaces . 
  lol !, 
  [ remember the raisin !, 
  ] ( http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/the-war-of-1812-remember-the-raisin.html ), 
  btw , we 've really forgotten the raisin . 
  [ bicentennial ] ( http://www.riverraisinbattlefield.org/ ) is january 2013 . 
  he beat it . 
  i searched for comments about this comment and found your comment . 
  i 'm going to comment that daniel day-lewis looks like lincoln and is not distracting , but tlj looks just like tlj . 
  they could have slapped an eye patch on him or something ... 
  two things :, 
  1 ) he kept relatively cool for being interrupted as often as he was . 
  that lady was disrespectful . 
  i do n't care if he 's a scumbag , he 's an elected scumbag . 
  2 ) while our `` enemies '' may be interpreting the president 's remarks as apologetic , which would be a concern for me , people like king are reinforcing that idea to the detriment of our international relations . 
  they are not without their problems , but `` the best government is local '' . 
  agreed . 
  no slurring homophobes on reddit please !, 
  this is not nascar , people !, 
  watch the people , they repeat without variation . 
  as usual , they are the weak link . 
  ... except op , of course . 
  thanks for posting this . 
  which one are you ? 
  in buddhism , brain washes culture . 
  too late , i have learned that it is extremely difficult to draw reliable and valid conclusions from the casual observation of internet voting . 
  my girls just started playing with their older brother 's long-abandoned legos . 
  one made a spaceship and flew it into the room . 
  `` the black enterprise '' . 
  awesome . 
   and * almost * everyone here shares the same sentiments . 
  ftfy . 
  some people there are obviously messed up . 
  you 're right !, 
  left-facing just looks stoned . 
  you certainly know your winkers !, 
  here , have an upvote . 
  now , please explain why moderate muslims are not standing up for themselves . 
  please tell us why we hear such flop-flopping nonsense like [ this ] ( http://www.freep.com/article/20120915/news05/309150151/dearborn-imam-violence-not-what-islam-preaches ) . 
  that an imam can say , `` there is no way we can tolerate killing . 
  '' , but it 's the people who burn the quran who , `` have blood on their hands . '' ? 
  how can anyone say they have no tolerance for killing , but then assign the responsibility for killings to anyone but the killers ? 
  yeah , i got cross-posted while looking up my link . 
  anyway , the question is not really answered . 
  yes , i know about the outrage in pakistan and i support this and think it 's long overdue . 
  one small quibble : they are angry that a girl got targeted and i do n't understand why they are not outraged when ** anyone ** gets targeted . 
  thanks for your response . 
  do n't the imam 's have some amount of immunity from the death threats ? 
  many important social reforms ( which could get an advocate killed ) have been led by pastors , rabbis and priests . 
  thank you for answering our questions . 
  what will you be doing on december 22nd , 2012 ? 
  perhaps hanging a new 5,125-year-long calendar on your wall ? 
  will it have kitten pictures ? 
  but seriously , i suppose you will be very busy up until the 21st helping to squash the media 's ridiculousness . 
  i wish you the best and support your efforts to be a voice of clarity in these farcical times . 
  thanks !, 
  hairy toes and all . 
  btw : `` dawn horse ''  = `` duck-sized horse '', 
  it 's astronomically weak . 
  literally . 
  ` murica adds , ' ... all get-out ', 
  ` that certificate looks legit as all get-out . ', 
  setting the foo bar far too high . 
   congressman laughs, 
  not quite a laugh . 
  more like a manic chortle ? 
  i want to go . 
  btw , humans probably did not ` migrate ' out of africa so much as undergo micro-dispersions one generation , or one clan-feud , or one bad season , at a time . 
  migration , in my mind , carries connotations of individuals moving long distances with some periodicity , i.e. 
  coming and going . 
  irony alert : the fans are the ones behind the cages . 
  getting those menus from those super-helpful local sandwich shops . 
  every . 
  day . 
   never ask how you did . 
  near the end , i like to ask if they `` got what they needed '' from the interview , or something similar . 
  i think it shows good follow-up skills and opens the door for them to give a critique if they wanted to . 
  wow , so steam power might be significantly safer than we give it credit for . 
  and the national park service website : http://www.nps.gov/rira/index.htm, 
  ok , some detective work ... 
  i clicked the link .

  emphasis mine . 
  `` you define god , so act like it . '', 
  one and only commandment .

  ftfy, 
  so does reddit not have some way for reposters to declare their intent ? 
  why not include it in the title ? 
   repost ( 9mo ) : what do we want ?
