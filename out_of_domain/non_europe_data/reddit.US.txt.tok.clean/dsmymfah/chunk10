  i see it 's [ taken ] ( http://www.bmsoftware.com/madesafe/index.htm ) now ... sry ... 
  i 'm an it guy , who has worked with raid devices , and i did not get that reference . 
   banana oil, 
  yeah , i saw that . 
  i was referring to the trademark when i made the comment , but that actually looks like it 's been abandoned . 
  sweat misters sounds pretty gross . 
  what happened in idaho in 1975 ? 
  this article seems to contradict the data . 
  they know perfectly well what you 're doing in there . 
  yeah !, 
  completely arctic climatic . 
  we have rules in my house . 
  no shitty musical instruments and no shitty sports equipment . 
  i would also extend that to telescopes and microscopes , but damn , we just ca n't afford that shit . 
   we 're about to see monumental advancements, 
  and cats . 
  we 're definitely going to see more cats . 
  like , in the * mail * ? 
  * sigh * .

  voila voila , washington . 
  europe has one native maple , the field maple ( [ acer campestre ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/acer_campestre ) ) , and it is [ very broadly distributed ] ( http://www.euforgen.org/fileadmin/templates/euforgen.org/upload/documents/maps/jpg/acer_campestre.jpg ) . 
  it has much less sugar than acer sacrum , but [ it can be tapped ] ( http://www.pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?latinname=acer+campestre ) . 
  find them in the summer and fall and set a reminder for yourself in january to set up your tapping equipment . 
   if they find it, 
   when they find it, 
  of course they do . 
   who the fuck tips on togo orders, 
  yeah , everyone knows the togolese make terrible servers . 
  why are hundreds of people still posting `` do n't do it '' almost a full day later when there is no chance anyone will see their post and the question was answered with the first post that said `` do n't do it '' ? 
  for the random person who is wondering the same thing as me and sees this post : hi . 
  i am very careful when i go there to speak with the waitstaff to get what i like . 
  they 've seen many a hardened beer drinker buckle under the bam , as i have , and they understand . 
  lol . 
  i certainly did not mean to intimate that your were some `` random person '' . 
  but , seriously , that 's a lot of dough . 
  if i have your attention here , would you please answer the question many of us have ? 
  how can someone looking to buy a house at that price point possibly justify the need for a co-signer ? 
  something does not add up . 
  it 's not even a good scam , if that 's what it was intended to be . 
  ok , maybe it 's the `` socal '' part of the equation . 
  it 's expensive there , i know , but i ca n't believe there 's nothing available at a better price . 
  as / u/funfor6 mentions , this is not a sustainable mortgage . 
  hard to tell from the pics , but it looks like you 're using regular ( sisal ? ), 
  twine . 
  that 's works just fine but consider getting [ coir ] ( http://freshops.com/cgi-bin/shopper.cgi?preadd=action&amp;key=mercxtw ) for next year , or the year after . 
  it really holds up year after year and the hops love climbing on it . 
  awesome lpt .

  please be aware that some license agreements with lynda , like at my school , are ** charged per login ** . 
  it 's open and available to all affiliates , but it 's not an unlimited license . 
  they get a bill every month based on usage . 
  this may be why it is not advertised . 
  lynda is notoriously difficult to negotiate with on academic pricing . 
  up there with apple and adobe . 
  please check with your help desk . 
   history channel only shows modern american stuff, 
  subsistance rhubarb foraging . 
  everyone please just zipper merge . 
  that way , no one needs to be an asshole . 
  in the meantime , if the lane is open and legal , please use that lane . 
  legal trumps nice . 
  if they tell you to wear medical alert bracelets and they tell you to carry glucose tablets , why do n't they make medical alert bracelets that carry glucose tablets ? 
  could not find any on the i-net . 
  that 's an excellent document . 
  thanks . 
  people should read this and be well-informed when they talk to their vet if they ever need to put their pet down . 
  limburger cheese is , technically , an atrocity . 
  consequences for the rest of us  risk  reward, 
  should be labeled `` ak47 '' . 
  my husqvarna was doing this and it turned out to be that the throttle cable had slipped . 
  have someone move the throttle back and forth while you look at the front of the cable . 
  you 'll see the cable actuates an arm on the carburetor . 
  with the throttle all the way forward ( choked ) , try to see of there is some play in that arm . 
  try to gently push on it in the direction that chokes the engine more , usually up . 
  if the engine starts when you do that , you know you need to adjust the cable just a little bit forward . 
  just enough to remove some of that play . 
  the screw that holds the cable on mine was a torx screw . 
  # 20 or 25 , i ca n't remember .

  i found this :,

  my father was working on vectoring nozzles at westinghouse more than 50 years ago . 
  he 's an old man now . 
  by this point , it 's a very well understood field . 
  i do n't think they consider this all that complex . 
  he sure swears like one .
