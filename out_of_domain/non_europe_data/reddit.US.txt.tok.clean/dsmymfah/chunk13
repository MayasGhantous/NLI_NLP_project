  i take the crunchy egg out and chop it up a bit to make a soft-boiled-tasting crispy egg and serve on toasted english muffins . 
  i would think so , but you 're better off looking/asking around a bit . 
  i 've not done an extract in 15 years . 
  i just remember my pots were too small when i went to ag . 
   overall , there is always blame on both sides when it comes to generalizations . 
  haha . . 
  i see what you did there . 
  it 's fine . 
  perfect , even . 
  he 's an artisan , it 's a video . 
  not sure if people want a thousand artisan video subreddits ... 
  / r/artisanvideoswithoutmusic, 
  there 's a third type of job , one where you take a shower * at * work . 
  edit : and no , please do n't post those kinds of `` artisan '' videos here . 
  that looks nice and all , but does it smell like hot piss and mushrooms ? 
  it 's not a subway if it does n't , it would be a `` metro '' . 
  `` hey , video this ! '',

  true . 
  oil takes a little while to break down and become really great at frying . 
  100 % fresh oil is not as good as the combination of fresh oil with a little bit of old oil added to it . 
  door jokes are the best . 
  knock , knock ... 
  jack looks like he wanted joe to run so he could use that gun .

  it is pretty accurate to say we 're made of `` star stuff '' . 
  the hydrogen was not made in stars , true , but it was made in the big bang , which is even more romantic , even if not technically a star . 
  here 's another thought , the vast majority of that  30 % hydrogen was in one or more stars at some point in the past 13.8 billion years since it was created . 
  that 's right , hydrogen was not created by stars . 
  it was created by the big bang . 
  which is even more awesome !, 
  some large percentage of us by weight has existed in its present state since the beginning of time . 
  my second point is that this stuff has been floating among the stars since the beginning of time and that 's close enough to `` star stuff '' for me . 
  also , since it 's has been around for so long , it 's reasonable to assume that a lot of it might have been in a star or two since then . 
  i do n't have a source for this . 
  well , as the_king_of_the_universe , i will have to defer to your notions on the subject . 
  when someone calls me `` star stuff '' i will strive to let them know that it should more generally be referred to as `` space stuff '' . 
  because , it 's complicated . 
  i will most especially enjoy telling them that i came to this conclusion though my conversations with the_king_of_the_universe and that the_king_of_the_universe wants them to know that the_king_of_the_universe is mildly perturbed when people such as themselves propagate factually incorrect information about the universe . 
  wish me luck !,

  be aware that it 's almost impossible to see with a telescope . 
  it 's too fast . 
  binoculars are even tough . 
  i just stand and watch it go by . 
  use the telescope to look at other things while you 're waiting .

  how did this work out for you ? 
  awesome !, 
  late to the party here , but could not pass up a comment on this :, 
   wilson 's case is more murky than other gun merchants . 
  instead of directly selling firearms and accessories , he provides blueprints on the internet to manufacture 3d-pistols at home . 
  i 'm going to wait until they have their 4d-pistol line available . 
  well , natal did become kinect . 
  so , big commercial and technical success there . 
  this holographic stuff looks to rely on kinect-like hand gestures . 
  yes , it was very pointed constructive criticism . 
  agreed . 
  it seems to come into `` focus '' in 3d .

  is n't what great ? 
  many of them are square nowadays . 
  or , rectangular . 
  this way , they can be hinged and work more like a door to the underworld .

  you can just fix the spelling on monday . 
  the ` reverse sear ' option you mention might be problematic as it 's important to get the surface of the meat dry before searing . 
  a hot , cooked roast might be more difficult to get dry than a cool , raw one . 
  might be worth an experiment . 
  i should keep food in the laundry room .

  i think the subliminal old shirtless dude in the background got to you . 
  too small , too slow . 
  you ca n't really blame people when they see him walking fine and they suspect something wrong is afoot . 
  it was a little clumsy .

  if it was called an faq , would that help ? 
  `` talking points '' sounds nefarious , but it 's really just a list of questions people will have . 
  i appreciate knowing this info . 
  it 's almost impossible for me to `` guess the right questions to ask '' and it 's in costco 's best interests that i 'm an informed consumer . 
  i wish all companies were more transparent with their customers . 
  one more .
