  attachment point is different though . 
  awesome , thanks !, 
  like / u/ohjamesk mentions , you can pause the frame in res or on the gyfcat website . 
  my phone does not have great depth of field , so this was one way to obviate that limitation . 
  my phone , samsung galaxy s4 has a camera mode called `` animated photo '' . 
  i guess it just creates gifs . 
  the biggest issue was that the file was 37mb , so getting it off the phone and onto gfycat was non-trivial ( sent to box , download , upload , etc. ), 
  i think next time , i might just try to upload it directly from the phone to gfycat . 
  had not thought of that . 
  the lighting is a led worklight i have . 
  if i had a bunch of these to id , i would make my daughter program a lego motor to slowly turn a turntable . 
  would it help to id if i polished it , of should i just go to / r/fossilid , as was suggested ? 
  water ? 
  and ... you just moved up the list . 
  did you check how you would withdraw from your 401 ? 
  read the fine print on withdraws before the age of 59.5 . 
  that explains the eurostach . 
  5 days you asked to be reminded of something and it 's mysterious, 
  the new sod attracts birdies . 
  if you 're trained in how to use it , it 's not too much weight to carry for the potential benefit . 
  how to clean up after yourself . 
  it sure is a good way to puncture the roofing membrane .

  most sashimi these days has been frozen , killing parasites . 
  alcohol is the solvent ; it solves my problems . 
  if they gently bruised the hops before adding , they would give off even more aroma . 
  if it were my pub , i 'd slice them in half for garnish . 
  source : i 've grown my own hops for more than a dozen years .

  very nice . 
  good job , kid !, 
  the fukn redditard perused the opposite but , in the end , decided not to buy it .

  looks like someone went to the prometheus school of running away from things . 
  i 'm sorry your pun got a bad reaction . 
  then they should just call him t-bone . 
  on spring mornings , the orthopod comes out from its cozy burrow and saws your fucking bone in half !, 
  i grew some last year and harvested about as much as i planted . 
  i had trouble with `` lodging '' , when the plant falls over and matts down . 
  i could not figure it out until one day i saw my dog laying in the middle of the patch . 
  she loved to hang out in there and nibble on it . 
  concoct the need for buyers of certain `` restricted '' items to show identification . 
  post a big legal-looking sign . 
  if they do n't balk , make a show of photocopying their id , etc. 
  they are familiar with this scenario because you ca n't buy pseudoephedrine , etc. 
  without going through a similar process . 
  you could even ask your local town/city board to write an ordnance requiring the id and you do n't even need to concoct a story . 
  in the 24th century , they would n't care . 
  consider `` packing for the trip '' - a series of techniques from the psychedelic community whereby you do self-work for a few days or weeks before a session . 
  meditate , exercise , read good literature , and educate yourself about your drug of choice . 
  your aim is to get yourself into a good place , mentally and physically , so that the drug can be a catalyst for positive change above and beyond the work you 've already done . 
  i 'm being somewhat flippant when i say you might consider a psychedelic trip like you might knee surgery - you need to strengthen your muscles in both legs before the surgery so you are better prepared to heal . 
  you ca n't expect the surgery to work well without proper preparation and physical therapy . 
  in the days leading up to a session , do some things you might like to do when you 're high . 
  listen to great music , read some buddhist stuff , watch baraka , clean your space , hang out with good and inspirational people who like and love you . 
  also , read up on what the scientific community has learned about anxiety , especially the physiological causes and effects , the different nervous systems at play , and how it can be mitigated with simple breathing techniques . 
  the advice in this thread on finding a good partner who will stay sober , the different strains to use , and how you should take it slow are all on point . 
  the technique of taking only a single puff is good , but at some points in my smoking life , when even a single puff might be more than i wanted , i would simply smell my stash . 
  i would take deep whiffs of the herb and hold it like i would a proper toke . 
  this was enough to trigger the muscle-memory of smoking and allow me to relax and have a mini `` practice '' session with zero chance of anxiety . 
  the ritual of smoking is itself a big part of smoking and i learned , without ingesting anything , how to differentiate and appreciate both .

  the united states is a union in a very different sense than , say , the european union . 
  we are a union * forever * . 
  3 million soldiers fought and 750,000 died in our civil war to decide this immutable fact . 
  it is rather for us to be here ( gettysburg ) dedicated to the great task remaining before us -- that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion -- that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain -- that this nation , under god , shall have a new birth of freedom -- and that government of the people , by the people , for the people , shall not perish from the earth .
