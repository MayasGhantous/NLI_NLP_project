  there have been many empires and reichs before us that have had the hubris to claim that they would last until the ages , but none of them drew their strength and inspiration from the ancient and undeniable right of each human to be free . 
  this is not to say that we 've constructed a perfect system , but rather that the principles we 've used to form this best-effort government are based on the unassailable fact that all people are created equal . 
  our flag represents these `` founding principles '' . 
  a very different answer from mine , but also correct . 
  alaska v. pluto . 
  stealing mail is a federal crime with severe penalties . 
  the mailbox itself , even if you bought it , is considered federal property . 
  also , the postal inspection service is not to be trifled with . 
  have you considered [ brewing a clone ] ( http://www.homebrewtalk.com/showthread.php?t=296940 ) ? 
  sometimes , they are better than the original in bottles . 
  one on each foot ? 
  we do in many places . 
  almost all of our science and engineering is done in metric now . 
  all product labeling requires both . 
  my kids use meters conversationally . 
  we 're getting there . 
  consider a [ hopslam clone ] ( http://www.homebrewtalk.com/showthread.php?t=219599 ) for a big bright iipa . 
  i like it better than pliny and it 's a beautiful peach color under the light . 
  our politicians are only responsive to our voting influence ( as opposed to money influence ) when we flood their offices with email and phone calls and put on a big show of `` popular support '' for or against a measure . 
  the `` monied '' people have figured this out , however , and now they pay for `` grassroots '' campaigns . 
  it 's called [ astroturfing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/astroturfing ) . 
  you could probably try a grassroots campaign if you got lots of people to speak loudly with a unified voice . 
  of course , i 'm sure you realize the internet would be a good way to try this . 
  here 's a [ grassroots organizing framework ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/sandersforpresident/wiki/orgguide ) put together by bernie sanders ' people that you can maybe use to get started and modify to your needs . 
  i had a german girlfriend and she paid similar costs and time in school . 
  she pronounced it `` fahrt-schule '' ( teehee ) . 
  she was an awesome driver . 
  i did not go to any school , just had my dad teach me . 
  paid some nominal amount ( $ 20 - $ 50 ) for the paperwork and driving test . 
  and [ russia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bering_strait#the_.22ice_curtain.22_border ) !,

   baby within the next 18 months to 2 years, 
  til lesbians have highly variable gestational lengths . 
  maybe , but you can capture the warm outflow and use it to wash up . 
  your first evil exploit !, 
  it 's a wonky pretty pussy . 
  i believe that is an artifact of the ~ ~ photosh ... ~ ~ depth of field on the camera . 
  saline solution is not the best for preserving eyeballs , tbh . 
  sensational media . 
  true . 
  but with finger-wings . 
  moonshine corn maize !, 
  drink all day . 
  try to find that one stalk to pee on after dark . 
  cooties and all , you understand . 
  seriously though , start looking around now , before everyone gets back to school . 
  do n't just look for postings , look for employers that you want to work for and cold-call them . 
  the person who answers the phone could very well be the person you would be working for/with , be nice to them . 
  tell them you called to talk to * them * to get their thoughts on your situation . 
  maybe they 're planning on posting a job soon , or know about something . 
  they will be more inclined to help you when they understand that it 's the work that * they * are doing that you find valuable . 
  pick a few places at first that you 'd be fine working at but ok if you 're snubbed . 
  that will warm you up for the big calls to the places you know you want to work . 
  you want to feel over-prepared , but not cocky . 
  that 's the sweet spot . 
  research them before calling . 
  this only works for positions that pick up the phone . 
  the vast majority of positions should be applied for via regular channels . 
  also , look at student job postings . 
  working for a college department could be fun/good for resume/connections . 
  as complicated as the chart is , it 's missing the ** time ** dimension . 
  you had the stench armstrong . 
  quite a collectable now ... 
  ha , i thought someone posted `` kenji 's pizza '' and you were complementing it . 
  at least it drops sick beats . 
  you did your phd on hummers . 
  i am showered !, 
  `` and then he rested . '', 
  `` and then there was much begatting . '', 
  `` and jesus said , ` peace unto you . ' '', 
  ... actually , not much to change here . 
  the neutral side . 
  has not , has he . 
  i keep telling her that 's what all the oil is for . 
  a red right arrow means that you must come to a complete stop at the marked stop line or before moving into the crosswalk or intersection . 
  after stopping , you may turn right on the red arrow at most intersections if the way is clear . 
  some intersections display a `` no turn on red '' sign , which you must obey . 
  i believe op is in fl . 
  cereal masterbrewster, 
  op is from fl . 
  the caps are [ sic ] from the original . 
  red arrow means only right turns . 
  op is from fl as well . 
  i love the red onion sauce at mendy 's in the basement of grand central . 
  i 've made a close approximation at home and found that it 's essentially the same ingredients as ketchup with more , and more intact , onions . 
  if i 'm feeling lazy , i will saute up onions and just add ketchup , a sprinkle of spices , and maybe a splash of vinegar to freshen it up . 
  tl ; dr : it 's some variation on ketchup . 
  play with proportions until you like it . 
  ** nothing ** is font-insensitive on a mac . 
  fonts are the lymph of a mac . 
   extremely self-centered and hedonistic, 
  so , like ayn rand 's objectivism ... 
  the satanist 's and our most conservative colleagues have something to agree on . 
  but really , i prefer traveling backward on trains . 
  i think it 's a little safer . 
  lol , it was a trap . 
  you 're not dumb . 
  if you knew how long it took me to figure out how to spell it right , you 'd feel better .
