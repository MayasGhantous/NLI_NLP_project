  if only we could bottle the stuff . 
  first , i too am not impressed so far . 
  where is your follow-through in something as simple as the thread you yourself created ? 
  second , ombudsman .

  just interjecting here to mention that , as a beekeeper myself , i find it 's almost inevitable that any thread or popular news article on bees will eventually include a pun on bees . 
  it 's just something i 've noticed , along the lines of godwin 's law , that happens . 
  i suspect that it has something to do with how so may aspects of bees are entwined with our lives . 
  honey , sweetness , the word `` bee '' . 
  anyway , any feedback on this topic that mite help explain it is encouraged .

  perhaps , mr trump , you are familiar with the more grammatically correct hyphenated term , `` straight-forward girl '' . 
  as in , `` mr. trump , i am a straight-forward girl and you should know that the hubris you exhibit is not as much of a turn-on as you might imagine . '', 
  i `` pay '' myself ( in my mind ) between $ 10 and $ 30 an hour for any work i do around the house . 
  at those rates , it 's worth it to buy good tools and materials so i 'm not wasting my mind-money .

  they 've got a bunch of clickbait `` xyz city does not exist '' articles . 
  that patent date gives a manufacturer of barnes : http://www.datamp.org/patents/advance.php?id=3599&amp;set=5, 
  sites like http://vintagemachinery.org/ and http://www.practicalmachinist.com/ have lots of info and photos of these lathes . 
  not sure of the value . 
  looks like the unmodified machines get the big bucks . 
  it was probably treadle powered . 
  do you still have the parts that were taken off ? 
  if you find out it 's not worth much ... 
  i 'm in se mi ... but there is little chance my wife is interested . 
  planned adulthood should lose its federal funding over this . 
  as management , i 'll say that it 's pretty frustrating how obfuscated the pricing is . 
  here 's a list i provided to my purchasing people to walk them through the implications of `` cloud procurement '' . 
  * base licenses @ $ x/year/seat . 
  could be lower based on special discounting or higher for more advanced versions , like enterprise . 
  * support @ $ x/year/seat . 
  comes with some licenses , but at different levels . 
  * salesforce products like marketing cloud or knowledge base that run on top of the base platform . 
  paid per seat to salesforce . 
  highly variable prices . 
  * `` data '' costs . 
  the base package allows for x-number of various technical needs ( api calls , database rows , etc. ), 
  if you go over this allocation , there are costs . 
  * `` usage '' costs . 
  for example , marketing cloud , in addition to their base cost , also charges per the volume of email you send out and for sap . 
  * managed packages on top of salesforce . 
  paid to a third party . 
  pricing could be a flat rate that gets split within an org , or a per seat cost . 
  highly variable licensing models among the thousands of apps . 
  * consulting with a firm for implementation assistance . 
  basically , all the flexibility and customization lead to highly variable long-term costs . 
  so , i 'm not really complaining , but it does make it difficult . 
  my leadership `` grew up '' in an era of `` big bang '' , capital-intensive software deployments . 
  they are not accustomed to committing ongoing operational costs for the unforeseeable future . 
  add on the variability and it makes them uneasy . 
  edit : add marketing cloud sap . 
  i know there 's more i 'm missing . 
  another one : communities charges per login . 
  flesh entering . 
  you typed `` suck '' very well , so there 's that . 
  well , i 'm a salesforce.org customer , so that might tell you how many checks are flying around here ; none !, 
  we get one slow , plodding , chicken-legged check every once in awhile , if we ask nice enough . 
  exactly .
