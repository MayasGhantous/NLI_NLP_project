  the media 's reaction to trump 's statement reflects an incorrect understanding of what the term `` the second amendment people '' refers to . 
  as a `` second amendment person '' myself ( who happens to also be a liberal , btw ) , i understood the term to mean `` people who are willing to defend their right to abolish tyrannical governments '' as that may be necessary to `` ensure a free state '' . 
  now , that position should be alarming enough to the msm and other `` establishment forces '' so i 'm not sure why they had to jump to conclusions about other possible interpretations . 
  how about if i put my thumb in your hole ? 
  very interesting , thanks .

  steam reviews , when up in the 99 % positive range , seem to attract these types of `` i 'm just posing a negative review so people will see it '' reviews . 
  some of them openly admit it , thinking they have an important point to make . 
  that is true . 
  also , the first sting can `` train '' the immune system ( develop an antibody ) so that by the second sting ( weeks or years later ) the antibodies will react to the venom .

  contact the wku 's `` here to help '' service and ask for their help in getting the doctor to fill out the form . 
  maybe a quick email from them will motivate your doc .
