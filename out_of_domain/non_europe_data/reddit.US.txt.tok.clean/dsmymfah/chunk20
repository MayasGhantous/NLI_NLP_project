  what is the vessel and lid ? 
  thanks . 
  added to my wish list . 
  love the crispy edges . 
  did they cut down a tree and make one stool ? 
  idahoan occultists are generally fairly neat people . 
  at least now we 've identified the shoulder thing that goes up . 
  after watching clickspring , i can only see the bit of solder slop . 
  why is it a bag and not a `` lousy t-shirt '' ? 
  then it could say ... `` and this lousy t-shirt '' at the end . 
  which is funny because pp treats lice too . 
  right ? 
  i need to find out more about this . 
   people had to be brought in just to be murdered, 
  they were brought in to replace the murdered actors in * cats * . 
  and then they were murdered . 
  pennies ? 
  i 've bathed in rivers . 
  they can leave you smelling worse than you did going in . 
  also , i 'm not sure what causes the sting you sometimes get from the water . 
  some rivers are not worth it . 
  maybe that 's why he 's angry at the guy who got to pound foolish . 
  i like that there are no snakes in this video . 
  haha , yeah , / u/fvf 's dad was dumb . 
  everyone knows not to use ketchup bottles , but old tabasco bottles . 
  the spice makes it warmer . 
  i would have thought a good name would have been a trumpbone . 
  did n't, 
  i 'm really glad this is a thing . 
  in re : 1st amendment, 
  sideways ovaries ? 
  thanks for bringing this up . 
  i 'm a fan of subs requiring verification . 
  i thought he was drawing this : http://i.imgur.com/kthujtv.png, 
  lol , you 're in for a treat . 
  beer not bia . 
  late to the party here , but two things :, 
  guns are tools , not toys, 
  i disagree with the anti-gun `` boys and their toys '' narrative and this weapon promulgates that argument, 
  and , 3 , yes , i agree , it 's also not a good idea because `` kids '', 
  this point has been addressed and debunked elsewhere in this thread . 
  it 's not an opinion that gun safety involves a spectrum of strategies working together . 
  safes , locks , education and properly scoped legislation are part of the solution , but other actions , like avoiding mixed messages around the fact that `` guns are not toys '' are also important . 
  these efforts are compromised when , for example , / u/autosear refers to them as `` simple gun safety '' . 
  it 's not simple . 
  it 's a complex web of psychology , sociology , physical security , training , and more . 
  it 's a life-long commitment to stopping that one , very remote , possibility of someone hurting themselves with your weapon . 
  i take it seriously and op 's gun , and the lack of serious response to it , damage the credibility of responsible gun owners and compromise our ability to educate non-gun owners and children about their own responsibilities around guns . 
  p.s : not calling / u/autosear an irresponsible owner , just calling out the fact that we should not diminish how complicated our responsibilities are . 
  why does their political party matter to the accuracy of the story ? 
  lol . 
  maach 25th, 
  i 've put an [ auto-siphon cap ] ( http://www.homebrewing.org/38-auto-siphon-tip_p_3012.html ) on the end of my dip tube . 
  if i recall , i had to shorten it by a few fractions of an inch and add a bit of hose to make the diameters match snugly . 
  worked well . 
  cool idea . 
  one thing to think about is the existing data on real world geology that already exists out there , much of it for free . 
  something like the usgs wss ( https://websoilsurvey.sc.egov.usda.gov/app/homepage.htm ) might enable you to build out a pokemon go type interface that lets you interact with the soil under your feet right now . 
  edit : ( hint : it 's loam ), 
  american politics 2016 , in a nutshell . 
  each school you apply to does a `` transcript evaluation '' for you to see what would transfer . 
  normally , this is done during the application process , but if you ask , maybe they will do one for you . 
  i do n't know about cut handles , but delaminated ones are are easy to fix with shoo goo . 
  their point is that the local people do n't know/care the animal is endangered and their traditions of eating them are perfectly `` normal '' ( and perhaps even sustainable ) . 
  if the end goal here is the preservation of the species then we need to do more than vilify the local tradition of eating bush meat . 
  we need to educate people about the current state of the species , but more importantly , seek out the root cause of the issue which is loss of habitat . 
  the palm oil plantations themselves and the habitat they destroyed are a bigger catastrophe , by several orders of magnitude than the local hunting the plantation workers do . 
  it is much harder , however , to motivate westerners to outrage over huge swaths of trees than it is over ape eating . 
  / r/rockhens, 
  contact the dean of student 's office at the college ( s ) you want to attend and they will explain what 's available . 
  there is a lot more available than in the recent past , but lds are , ironically , still kind of new for most places . 
  better meds and/or accommodations in k-12 mean more kids are better functioning and able to get into college now . 
  good luck !, 
  day 638 :, 
   g'day , chris here ... 
  well , i 'm glad that nightmare is finally over then . 
  lol . 
  `` moist '', 
   ... keep and bear arms for militia purposes , as well ** asself-defense ** . 
  i , for one , will defend myself from asselfs at all costs . 
  my grams . 
   individuals, 
  i 'm sure no offense was intended , but i contain multitudes . 
  it 's whitman . 
  lol, 
  it 's ok . 
  it was a bit obtuse and could have been taken a number of ways . 
  my wife has been on an equalirampage for exactly [ 120 days ] ( https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=election+day+2016+-+today ) . 
  it 's not annoying at all because i have read the comments section on breitbart ( any article ) and i am genuinely concerned for this world . 
  we need you and her . 
  my undergrad was in creative writing and now i do it . 
  i have also retained little , but my daughter is proud that i was a writer and it gives her confidence that she will be one too . 
  so that 's nice . 
  not a problem . 
  sorry i made a sloppy joke on your thread . 
  the don 's spaghetti . 
  that is exactly where i stopped reading . 
  bad article . 
  as a liberal , i say , `` wrong ! '', 
  if anything , the constitution flows from our natural rights , not the other way around .
