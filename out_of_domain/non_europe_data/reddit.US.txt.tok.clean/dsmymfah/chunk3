  here 's something on autolysis from 4 hours ago :, 
  here 's the one on tannins from 6 hours ago . 
  ( except it 's on biab , not hot sparge , which i agree could be a problem ), 
  the barrier to entry for new brewers is steep enough without us adding extra things to worry about . 
  totally different 1942 . 
  warrior 's ... 
  honor ? 
  the '' - logy '' part . 
  very old-fashioned . 
  we should just call it techno . 
  insert thread of imgoingtohellforthis jokes about `` character skinning '' ... 
  those planks look like they 're probably oak , but if they 're not , and it 's hickory , save it to smoke up some pork . 
  i used my hardwood floor scraps to smoke some shoulders yesterday . 
  do not smoke the cat , buy some pork shoulder , or boston butt . 
  my friend has a blog that he tracks both his running and cheeseburger consumption on . 
  the running is expressly so he can eat the burgers . 
  lol . 
  i did that when i turned 21 . 
  i mostly drank and ate little . 
  i lost weight but , disturbingly , i got a beer gut . 
  once i realized how dangerous that seemed , i toned it down a bit . 
  hey , btw , thanks for your service !, 
  step two looked like some frothy mugs of beer before i zoomed in . 
  that was explanation enough for me . 
  i 've not tried it myself , but i 'd like to build one of these ladybird beetle houses . 
  but they specifically avoid defining `` god '' . 
  see : http://meritbadge.org/wiki/index.php/declaration_of_religious_principle, 
  as a pantheist , i 'm fine with this . 
  i 'm still waiting for smarter deer . 
   ... he would ** n't ** shit himself if i made a gluten free ipa, 
  ftfy, 
  it 's a niche sport because that 's where you put your hands . 
  wow . 
  who knew the * tablespoon * was at the center of this vast conspiracy ? 
  there 's no such thing as `` animal porn '' . 
  it 's uniquely human . 
  first full-color surrender ? 
  some of them like to be saddled with quilt . 
  or so i understand . 
  [ there 's nothing hypothetical about it . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/criticism_of_government_response_to_hurricane_katrina#confiscation_of_civilian_firearms ), 
  paranoid , as in motivated by fear ? 
  sure . 
  your workplace should be providing you with safety glasses . 
  you should wear them . 
  if there has ever been a more apt use of the phrase , `` this should end well '' , well - this is it . 
  i grew up on the east coast and during the few years i live in san antonio , i desperately missed bread . 
  there was no bread in san antonio until central market opened up and sold their ciabatta . 
  still the best ciabatta i 've ever had . 
  big holes and chewy . 
  it was like the a hunk of swiss chess , but it was bread . 
  see if your school has an ombudsman . 
  i was suspicious . 
  i looked up my school and fire had a good number of ( very recently updated ) citations from their official policies . 
  not bad . 
  no , not me personally . 
  but the position is designed to guard against exactly that sort of cronyism . 
  let me tell you though , when i found out ( after getting a ba and a ms ) that such a position existed , i was pissed . 
  i felt like they did a good job of hiding it from me and would have used it quite a few time during my many years in higher ed . 
  also forgot to mention that the position is designed to be a sort of `` escape hatch '' to help students avoid litigation with the university . 
  you can also read that as the following advice : always comport yourself in these situations as if you are prepared to litigate . 
  ( and always be prepared to litigate . ), 
  also , as a side note , i 've have panic attacks for many years and i do not like them one bit . 
  i hesitate to give internet advice , but have found that if i 'm able to `` drop my breathing down into my belly '' , much like people who meditate can , the symptoms of the attack immediately vanish and i feel wiser . 
  that abstract was hard to read , but i think they 're saying the used the first ceramic pots to make fish soup . 
  never doubt logical things exist . 
  lens flare ? 
  my son did this . 
  he painted it like sponge bob . 
  victory was irrelevant . 
  readers ( should ) have different expectations from social vs. mainstream media . 
  msm is expected to deliver `` finished '' news , culled from their sources . 
  social media works more directly with sources , in many cases we * are * the source . 
  readers should know that the news produced is a `` work in progress '' and take the proper precautions with the information . 
  problems can crop up if people do n't recognize this difference , or when social media appears to be an authoritative source . 
  in other news , that article was pretty bad . 
  by the very nature of the medium , you are going to have a very diverse influx of information . 
  this is one of the strengths of the system . 
  we still have some work to do on culling and verifying and such , but to fault the system for `` spreading bad tips '' is like criticizing a police hotline for recording and taking seriously every tip they get . 
  make it super-duper dense and you get ... coal . 
  star !, 
  awesome !, 
  i love these super-obvious-when-you-see-it things . 
  there 's so much more to be done , and some of it is helpful and straightforward like this .

  master bear-baiting tips to stop wolves dogging dogs . 
   our results show that our brains are much more dynamic than previously thought, 
  you can tell it 's real by the sparkles . 
  anxious . 
  still clicked for sideboob . 
  to be fair , `` before internet '' was also `` before good cameras '' , so maybe not as many as you think . 
  they 've jumped the cat-in-a-shark-costume . 
  ha , me too . 
  the kids are plowing through the netflix episodes and that 's what they call it . 
  ^ kids !,
