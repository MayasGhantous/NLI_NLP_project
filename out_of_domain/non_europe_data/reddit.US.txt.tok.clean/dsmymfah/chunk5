  i 've had a norwegian brew on my to-do list ever since i read [ brewing and beer traditions in norway ] ( http://books.google.com/books/about/brewing_and_beer_traditions_in_norway.html?id=yujbaaaamaaj ) , by odd nordland . 
  if you 're interested in ` the old ways '' , this guy went around norway in the 1950 's ( ? ), 
  and interviewed a ton of farmhouse brewers specifically to preserve their traditions and techniques . 
  there 's some great pics and descriptions of the implements they used including filters made of hair and details on how various mash tuns drained . 
  being an equipment nerd , i loved this . 
  i learned that they not only used juniper branches for the strike water , as you showed , but they also laid them in the bottom of their mash tun , along with alder branches to form the bottom of the filter bed . 
  the farmers told how one certain man would travel from farm to farm on brew day to build these filter beds of juniper and alder because the technique was delicate enough that if not done right would lead to a stuck mash . 
  i see you 're washing a stainless false bottom , which seems much easier . 
  they also talked about where they got their ingredients from . 
  it was a bit of a trial , as you might imagine , and much of the discussion centered around the need to be frugal with ones supplies . 
  in fact , alder was used because it not only gave a nice sweet edge ( i 'm imagining not unlike sassafras ) but also colored the beer . 
  darker beer meant it was a ` richer ' beer . 
  i do n't recall reading about the yeast paddle , but i do remember reading about a yeast ` log ' . 
  they would take a small log and hack little slices into it all around so they could smear the dregs of their last brew all around it . 
  they would then hang it over the mantel , warm and dry , but not near the fire , so it would dry out . 
  it would keep that way indefinitely and be ready for dunking into the next batch of wort . 
  just makes me think about how sanitary we are today compared . 
  i 'm sure their stuff had a bit of ` farmhouse sour ' to it back in the day . 
  i 've been looking to make my own copper kettle and it 's very hard to find pics of old , handmade kettles . 
  do you think you could grab a couple pics of how the bottom is put on ? 
  thanks , that 's really nice of you to offer !, 
  i 'm most interested in the bottom of the kettle , if it 's soldered or riveted , and how thick the metal is compared to the sides .
