  thanks again !, 
   maybe these can help, 
  yes , they do . 
  thank you . 
  you 've not failed , these will help . 
  my thanks to you , and to sigmund next time you get drunk with him . 
  no , this is great . 
  just what i needed . 
  thanks !, 
  op delivers !, 
  not drunk now . 
  must have been drunk 2 days ago when i previously answered this . 
  i 'm also a nyc transplant and i 've been looking for a good slice for some time now . 
  here 's the lowdown for my tastes . 
  for reference , my benchmarks are, 
  * joe 's on bleecker = a + . 
  ( sigh ), 
  * nypd = c ( tastes like bad nyc street pizza , tastes like home , ask for slices to be hot ), 
  * chicago style = pizza casserole, 
  two places in aa that are ok but serve small neapolitan pies , not slices . 
  * http://maniosteria.com/ = b + ( super expensive , like 4x nyc prices for the volume ), 
  * http://www.neopapalis.com/ = a - ( sauce is a little too strong , but otherwise pretty good ), 
  recently discovered in downtown detroit , eastern market :, 
  * http://supinopizzeria.com/ = a ( so excited to find this . 
  almost walked by . 
  it 's good . ), 
  as an aside , bread . 
  there are no kaiser rolls here . 
  no egg sandwiches . 
  i 'm still heartbroken . 
  not sure if that 's your thing . 
  zingerman 's has a very good semolina bread , so that 's a life saver . 
  washtenaw dairy has great donuts . 
  search for a franchise you might like to open ? 
  i remember , 27 years ago , laughing like hell at that . 
  i just think it 's funny that this is the pic that motivated you to start doing this . 
  btw , i noticed you have a boilerplate edit that you include when people respond to your post . 
  maybe that could include some encouragement for website owners and developers to think about accessibility on their own sites . 
  maybe point them at a site like http://webaim.org/ or http://www.lighthouse.org/accessibility/design/web/,

  hahahahahaha !, 
  fat chance !, 
  edit : i have a `` how to draw faces '' book that maps out the muscles . 
  i hung it in the workshop and it keeps people away from the tools . 
  with regard to earthquakes , have you seen any designs that use a lighter material than cement for the roofing . 
  in many monolithic constructed buildings it 's the walls that fail , but the roof that kills . 
  bam , iran was one instance where poorly built walls combined with heavy roofs [ killed a lot of people ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_bam_earthquake#cite_note-iranshopefades-14 ) . 
  i discovered something similar last night . 
  as i walked up to the front door of my house i asked myself , `` how much money would pay 20 years from now to be able to do this ? 
  to walk up this sidewalk and into this house , with your wife and kids and dogs inside . '', 
  20 years from now , i might pay just about anything to have those few moments back again . 
  so i took them as they came .

  i never thought much about the gamecube . 
  i remember playing games on it with my son and my niece , but i do n't remember the hardware much . 
  that 's a pretty good indicator to me that it was great . 
  went through two pages of posts on the logmein forum and the vast majority had ( at least ) one or two grammatical errors . 
  just struck me as strange . 
  and modest too . 
  `` and here 's a little something-something for you , house . '', 
  - escarpment, 
  ( i just wanted to use the word `` escarpment '' ), 
  well , ok . carrion then .

  this effect is called a [ katamari democracy ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1w0zw3/despite_all_the_romanticism_over_home_made/cexr1ko ) , as of 50 minutes ago . 
   public demonstrations that gain momentum do so like a snowball down a mountain , collecting and absorbing bystanders , fair weather ideologues , true believers , and the downright crazy without prejudice . 
  good post . 
  the corollary to the well-informed non-tech founder is the developer who is capable of describing the technological decision points in a non-technical way so the founder can participate in the decision making . 
  for example , the founder wants a quick and dirty page . 
  the good dev will explain the risks of long-term support of the page and enumerate the benefits of investing more time into building a well-architected , standards-based app . 
  the founder can then understand and intelligently participate in the decision . 
  before you say that the latter option is always best , understand that this particular business may , in fact , only need the quick and dirty solution for now . 
  the dev might not understand the business drivers behind that need . 
  if the founder is really good , they can help the dev understand those drivers and the dev can participate in business decisions . 
  tl ; dr : it 's a process of bringing everyone along according to their strengths and supporting each other as we work on our weaknesses .

   you do n't need to stress about sanitation, 
  you really do n't need to stress about anything in homebrewing . 
  you may have seen the homebrewer 's motto : [ rdwhahb ] ( http://www.homebrewtalk.com/wiki/index.php/rdwhahb ), 
  take a small leap , brew your first batch , and you will see that doing it is much less complicated than talking about doing it . 
  looks like they need to loosen up the buckle a notch or two .

  are fundamental marks of existence permanent ? 
  i translate the lyrics for him in my shitty german . 
  did you fall asleep on it and drool on it ? 
  and , my goodness , what are they eating that they squirt that seed-filled bile all over the sidewalk every night beneath their roosts ? 
  after cooking , i just leave them covered in the pan with the heat very low . 
  they caramelize on the cut side . 
  just made it up .
