  i know you probably did n't mean to just go out and do something like this without having some knowledge of what you were doing first , but i feel that i should point out that installing something like this requires a bit of ( easily obtained ) knowledge so it 's done safely and efficiently . 
  just saying . 
  from another angle . 
  nothing is wrong . 
  everything is exactly as it should be . 
  3.1598 \u00d7 10 ^ -6 c ( speed of light in vacuum ), 
   but it 's sort of a front, 
  it 's called [ high-context culture ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/high-_and_low-context_cultures ) . 
  it seemed fake to me at first but it 's part of the culture to speak that way . 
  you have to pay close attention to the words a southerner uses to understand their intent . 
  easterners wear their intent more on their sleeve . 
  more than once , while i lived in the south , i would think back to a conversation hours later and realize someone said something and i was only now getting it . 
  i did n't grow up with it , so it was not easy for me to process . 
  se michigan is interesting as it 's on the border between `` east '' and `` midwest '' . 
  influences from both are here . 
  you do n't know who you 're going to get until you start talking to them . 
  i see the bitch-faced `` easterners '' walking in the park one minute and talk to my super-sweet neighbors the next . 
  i 'm still trying to figure out midwesterners , but i think you might be right , they are just nice people . 
  you earned it , therefore , you deserve it . 
  that 's how it works . 
  as an aside , no other person is in a good position to second-guess your accomplishments , let alone your lifestyle choices . 
  i roomed with a guy who used baby powder on his balls , and while i can appreciate the results , the juxtaposition of the `` baby '' smell and the thought of vinnie 's balls was just wrong . 
  the vinator goes on the bottle tree . 
  it 's a nice setup , makes washing easy . 
  i also use a [ bottle washer ] ( http://www.northernbrewer.com/shop/double-blast-bottle-washer.html ) . 
  it 's also pretty nice . 
  the cost of these three items , on this site anyway , are $ 79 . 
  which is halfway to an entry-level kegging system . 
  now that i keg , i wish i had put up with a little manual bottle washing and saved my money for a kegging system . 
  my bottling equipment gets used only occasionally now . 
   because the bible says it did, 
   because you can not directly observe the past , you can not presume to know what actually happened . 
  i saw someone point out this little jewel the other day : ken ham did not witness the creation of the bible, 
  remember the raisin !, 
  it wins the award for most ironic battle cry . 
   train in a conduit and oil , gas and electricity in different conduits , kind of like a fistful of drinking straws, 
  a2coin . 
  that way , we 're always at the top of the cyrpto charts , like aaa plumbers in the phonebook . 
  i think it 's a great idea . 
  ( not sure why all the naysaying . ), 
  sure , there are issues to be overcome , but so what ? 
  there is a vision here that if successful would be beneficial to merchants , consumers , and the city . 
  i say , go for it !, 
  maybe show up [ here ] ( http://www.meetup.com/a2newtech/events/150900402/ ) tomorrow and just start talking to people . 
  many [ places ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scrip#community-issued_scrip ) , like [ detroit ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/detroit_community_scrip ) , have incorporated scrip into their economies to encourage local consumption . 
  detroit backs theirs with dollars , but if you let the market value the scrip , then it would function to essentially build liquidity into the local bartering process . 
  i would imagine there would be an aa scrip -  bitcoin market , at least . 
  the ann arbor farmers ' market might also be interested . 
  here 's usda 's page on using [ scrip ] ( http://www.fns.usda.gov/ebt/scrip-system-paper-scrip-token-or-receipts ) for snap cards at farmers ' markets . 
  and [ oregon 's ] ( http://oregonfarmersmarkets.org/ebt/tokens.html ) use of wooden nickels . 
  even if your idea only replaced this system , i think it could be successful . 
  all the current cyptos are market-valued . 
  people are using them . 
  i 'm not quite getting your argument here . 
  the * coin has some value , the dollar has some value and they each have some value relative to each other . 
  prices are set according to those values . 
  if it 's a large differential , like doge to dollar , then so be it . 
  that 's one of the features of cryptos , no need to manipulate the market . 
  the market sets the value and we know it 's not `` stabilized '' or otherwise tampered with . 
  ( speculation issues aside . ), 
  volatility could be a real issue and would be a very worthwhile discussion . 
  the reasons a buyer would acquire the * coin :, 
  good will - the buyer wants to invest in their community, 
  no fees - as alluded to in other threads , no cc processing fees , no swipes at every farmers ' market booth, 
  potential deals - merchants set lower price for `` local '' buyers using * coin, 
  they got them `` free '' - local communities can support interest-free loans , gift-certificates , or other giveaways to encourage local consumption . 
  carry it in a paper or digital wallet - easier than cash, 
  6 . probably more ... 
  there is no requirement that the * coin be tied to the conventional financial system . 
  if you wanted to do that , then yes , you need to get backers . 
  the list of local currencies you point to has examples of currencies backed by local merchants . 
  that 's one option , but not the only one . 
  again , a good discussion to have , but not a good reason not to do it . 
  merchants would only list prices in usd . 
  if a buyer wants to use * coin , then the calculation is done on the spot at the current rate . 
  that 's the way overstock.com does it now for bitcoin . 
  yes , merchants need to accept the volatility that comes with that setup and it 's part of the calculations they do when they first agree to accept the currency . 
  wikipedia says , [ calgary dollars ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/calgary_dollars ) are not explicitly backed by any fiat currency . 
  their '' [ about ] ( http://calgarydollars.ca/about/ ) '' page , however , does say , `` the value of one calgary dollar equals one federal dollar . '', 
  not sure what 's going on there . 
  so yes , * coin proponents would be faced with a choice of how to set this up :, 
  1 . tie the currency to usd , find backers , and have a simple exchange rate, 
  2 . decouple the currency from usd and train merchants and users about how the currency market works, 
  obviously , i 'm a fan of option 2 . 
  it 's more overhead in the beginning , but leverages the benefits of crypto in the long-run . 
  that was mere seconds . 
  more like auto ** quiki ** bot . 
  care . 
  that 's actually encouraging . 
  are they teaching this more now , that there is a pathway for whistle blowers and expectations to utilize it ? 
   it has always been legal and ethical to report illegal acts, 
  but not alway encouraged . 
  do not , under any circumstances , tip me . 
  arugh !, 
  now i have to go look up how to accept it !, 
  i told you not to do that . 
  * grumpy , but over-caffeinated , so it all evens out . 
  [ the raisin ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/massacre_of_the_river_raisin#river_raisin_massacre ) . 
  is this just `` dacted '' then ? 
  i just called out , `` chewydabacca ? '',
