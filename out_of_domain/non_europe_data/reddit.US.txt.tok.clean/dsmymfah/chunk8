  theory : the koch brothers do n't necessarily want to directly `` buy '' our political system , they want to instill fud into it . 
  they use their money to cast aspersions on things like ` the science behind global warming ' . 
  if the system is unstable , or perceived to be inefficient , ordinary people will shrink from their duty to advocate for what is good . 
  in this atmosphere , the lobbyist will thrive .

  take a breath , sit back , and think about how you want to move forward with this . 
  there is plenty of time . 
  be strategic about it . 
  frito-lay will respond to a solid strategy , not any amount of money that any of us can put on the table . 
  ask the community what they think . 
  involve your fellow shibe . 
  that 's where you will find the value in doge . 
  crows in snow ... murder in the 1st degree . 
  i 've never thought of dogs having drumsticks before , but there they are . 
   money replaces bartering . 
  it is supposed to represent stuff . 
  yes , as stated , one doge represents one doge . 
  this concept , as / u/newskul gently reminds us , is one of the main reasons why many of us are here . 
  we are all very familiar with the trite concepts of what the dollar represents and we are embarking on this journey to discover the * new * possibilities that * new * thinking around currency can uncover . 
  we can think of it this way , the theory goes that when writing first developed we primarily used it to count and inventory things . 
  i imagine that the first sumerian to apply the written word to a `` higher '' literary calling , like story-telling or poetry , faced unparalleled ridicule . 
  `` little hash marks are for counting , you fool , not for writing notes to yourself . 
  and just what is this about supple nubians ? '' . 
  they could not see what was ahead , the books upon books and poems on poems to be written . 
  and so it may be with currency . 
  we might be now be in those brief days where a fundamental transformation of a storied institution like currency is just beginning to find a new medium for expression . 
  this may very well be the dawn of a new art , where how we represent our contributions to society are measured in new and beautiful ways . 
  how we give recognition to each other now , with little tips , may be the first inkling of a new poetry of how we show someone that they are valued in this world and we , in turn , receive value and recognition from others . 
  it 's time to put our old ways of thinking about currency aside and grow the systems that our sons and daughters can use to write sonnets to each other about how much they love each other and deliver both meaning and value to their beloved at once . 
  there is a place for seriousness around cryptos . 
  for example , pertaining to this thread , no one should be concerned about the price dropping . 
  doge should be part of a balanced portfolio of investments that can include some speculative currencies . 
  investors should be 100 % prepared to lose 100 % of it . 
  it can be part of a measured investment strategy where one accepts the full spectrum of risks . 
  find someone you trust to talk about it - over coffee - * not * online . 
  there is also a place for all this foolishness . 
  it helps give some elbow room for thought around the grand ambitions ahead .

  the following is just my personal experience . 
  you should talk to a professional if you feel you need more ( or more correct ) info . 
  many people feel this way at times . 
  there 's nothing wrong with feeling this , it 's a normal and healthy way for a mind to test out all the possibilities and make sure it 's on the right track . 
  we will subconsciously push ourselves to extremes of logic and emotion to test the borders , just as we did when we were children . 
  one thing that can happen , however , is people can get `` stuck '' thinking about a particular item and the mind plays out the scenario on a `` loop '' . 
  our brains derive a bit of pleasure from `` playing '' like this and it will often drift back to what feels good , perpetuating the `` loop '' . 
  there 's lots of resources online about changing your `` inner dialogue '' .

  when the big boys fund startups , they do so in exchange for a piece of the action ; some portion of ownership . 
  there 's no reason i can think of off the top of my head why a kickstarter-type campaign ca n't offer some portion of ownership as part of their `` packages '' . 
  right now i only see t-shirts or product offered . 
  if they offered `` stock '' , or some fractional ownership , i might be more interested .
