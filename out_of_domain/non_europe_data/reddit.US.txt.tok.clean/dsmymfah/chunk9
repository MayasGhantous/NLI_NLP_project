  not sure if there is anything more recent . 
  i had this same struggle you 're having when i signed up as an adult leader . 
  you 're correct , the application does require an obligation to god . 
  i just simply defined what `` god '' meant to me and i was comfortable signing . 
  if anyone were to ask me about it , i would simply say that i fulfill the obligation to god part and that i 'd rather keep the details of how to myself . 
  part of my belief in god is that people should not talk about their belief in god too much .

  i think sabine finally shows up at 2:56 . 
  i 'm involved in these sorts of discussions at my u and no one talks about changing the business model to one of `` pleasing customers '' . 
  sure , we want to compete with other schools who have more modern facilities , etc. , but all those improvements can also be lumped under a `` quality of life '' argument and i see most of it as a good thing . 
  we 're not just stacking our students in cinderblock dorms anymore . 
  our concept of quality living/learning spaces is maturing . 
  yes , it 's expensive , but there are actual gains to be made toward our core mission . 
  our `` customer service '' discussions are more accurately labeled as `` constituent management '' work . 
  of course , we use customer service tools to accomplish this , but our goal is to better understand our students so we can serve them more efficiently . 
  it 's not to `` please '' them , although that 's not a bad outcome . 
  we want to measure things like co-curricular outcomes and see if they correlate with grades or perhaps prior service work . 
  we do this by collecting data in a `` customer '' system . 
  sorry if the name gets conflated with other business-y names , but we ca n't afford custom higher ed it solutions anymore and we 're turing to ` commodity ' it providers to do some of the heavy lifting for us . 
  i 'm chucking to myself thinking of how apoplectic the next article will be when people find out we 're managing admissions using a product called `` salesforce '' . 
  as if providing the ` service ' was n't bad enough , now we 're selling it !, 
  sure i did , deuce . 
  i 'm saying the premise of the article is a red herring . 
  i agree with his point that we should not treat students as customers , but my point is that i do n't think that is what 's happening . 
  what 's happening is that we 're getting better at serving our students and it looks a lot like better customer service . 
  it 's just better student services . 
  nothing wrong with that . 
  my point is that , at my institution anyway , we 're mature enough to keep our eyes on the mission . 
  `` customer service '' is just another tool in the toolbox . 
  improving it does not mean it drives the bus . 
  sorry , it was n't much but you could see just enough of the guy and his reaction to her arrival .

  i have much more respect for businesses that encourage/require their workers to wear safety gear regardless of laws and regulations . 
  in this day and age , there is no reason why anyone should be doing this work without safety glasses .
