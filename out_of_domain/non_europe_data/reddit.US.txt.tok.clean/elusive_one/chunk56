  i currently have medical things that would prevent me from currently being a receptive partner . 
  i 'm not sure i would be into it , but if that was a fantasy of a partner , i might give it a go and see what happens . 
  i did n't believe i received something special when i was baptized and got `` the ghost '' . 
  nothing felt different when i got the `` priesthood '' . 
  started to not believe in prayer , then doubted this god fellow . 
  conclusion , i did n't believe in any of it , but could n't call myself an atheist because they are bad . 
  then i got a book that explained what an atheist was ( just no god ) and i 've sat there happily ever since . 
  my family is a few generations in , as well as many friends . 
  now that there is easy access to information , i 'm shocked by the history . 
  but no more shocked that i was when i was 20 and already out and learned of the mountain meadows massacre . 
  i was already out by then , but it make me realize just how white washed the history i was taught was . 
  hell , i did n't want to finish watching it . 
  just shut it off . 
  damn skippy !, 
  mesa is the slow spot for bar/club experiences . 
  correct answer, 
  it 's the reason they joined england and became great britain . 
  they tried and failed , and needed money . 
  joined gb . 
  [ cgpgrey ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3hnmlq8m9u ) has a quick video about it . 
  i hear you buy your underwear ( the magic variety required ) at the temple . 
  you can buy it online but you have to provide a membership number . 
  there are three magazines that most members have a subscription to . 
  the friend , the ensign , and the new era . 
  they are monthly . 
  they have a whole business that churns out material to be gobbled up by the sheeple . 
  it 's for profit arm just built a [ mall ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/city_creek_center ) in slc , is a large player in [ cattle ] ( http://www.livestockweekly.com/papers/01/01/25/whldeseret.asp ) in the us , and owns a huge percent of [ florida ] ( http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/world/57102720-68/church-joe-company-florida.html.csp ) . 
  someone in the comments says it 's near 2 % . 
  whatever , it 's a lot . 
  you are required to pay 10 % ( a tithe ) of your income to be a member in good standing so you can enter their temple . 
  they have weddings in the temple , do n't pay , ca n't go . 
  unless you lie , but then you are unworthy so you have to lie about that too , but you just lied so that should n't be a problem . 
  put up that front so you do n't look like a bad member that ca n't go to the temple . 
  hot drinks just meant fire water . 
  coffee is fine , they are just speaking as men when they say coffee . 
  it 's 4:20 , tee hee !, 
  use the cli !, 
  stop using gui anything . 
  since some exp . 
  would be `` beneficial '' you should be ok . 
  if you get the job , you can call yourself a linux admin so `` welcome '' !, 
  study up on cli for the next 2 days . 
  cgpgrey has some quick video 's i like that are very informative . 
  some supernova 's you can see . 
  they can last anywhere from hours to weeks i believe . 
  even during the day for bright ones . 
  it 's a star , so it 's fixed in the sky ... like the other stars ( does n't move ) . 
  edit : article says you wo n't be able to see it with the naked eye . 
  from [ here ] ( https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/tftp-hpa/+bug/664424 ), 
  the default behaviour for tftpd is to not create new files , i.e. 
  you can upload to an existing file location ( as long as it has the correct permissions ) but you ca n't create new files on the tftpd server . 
  you can change this behaviour by adding the -- create parameter to tftp_options in / etc/default/tftpd-hpa and amending the directory permissions on / var/lib/tftpboot . 
  however you should do this with extreme caution ; this effectively allows any remote client to upload data with no authentication to your server which could create potential denial of service problems due to full file systems etc. . . 
  edit : just looked at archwiki page and you should just be able to add - c like so, 
  execstart = / usr/sbin/in . tftpd - c - s / srv/tftp /, 
  adding - c should do the trick . 
  big durty  long con . 
  so much comedy gold in there . 
  i re-posted one of my favorite lines as a text post [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1vwn9b/there_is_nothing_more_fundamental_in_gods/ ) . 
  woot , phx at 93 . 
  prescott added probably dropped it a few spots too . 
  it got me , super fun . 
  i often have downtime so i 'll be here a lot !, 
  yup . 
  i went to school with a kid named nephi that lived there . 
  it 's just north of mesa which is a suburb east of phoenix . 
  eating meat at every meal will not make you feel like crap ( / r/paleo , that 's what they do ) . 
  coffee and tea have great health benefits . 
  alcohol has great benefits ( 2 drinks a day , not a six pack or binge drinking ) . 
  people knew how to be healthy , wow brought about nothing new except more control for js . 
  `` bless these doughnuts that they will nourish and strengthen our bodies '', 
  that one made me laugh . 
  so true . 
  my mom made me walk out of the dollar theater while watching super mario brothers because it gave her a dark feeling . 
  rated pg . 
  i love how he does n't just come out and say `` these things are not true '' but has to use the mormon way to say it `` i know these things not to be true '' . 
  more words = more authority !, 
  there 's a program called whois that will look up domain registrars . 
  fairtoall.org is a `` private '' registrar through godaddy . 
  basically , godaddy puts their name in there for you so you do n't have to identify yourself . 
  lds.org uses their commercial entity . 
  so unlikely . 
  lds.org : registrant name : intellectual reserve , inc. 
  fairtoall.org : registrant name : registration private, 
  you can use whois.net to look up that information for any site . 
  come out to the ones that are out , they would be able to relate . 
  maybe help . 
  hopefully you are my sister !, 
  there 's almost zero chance of that . 
  it 's not just a mormon thing . 
  but yes , it 's all over mormon scripture . 
  edit : you 'll also notice that it focuses on the women . 
  god impregnated mary ? 
  he had to have her as a spiritual child first , so he cheated on heavenly mother with his own daughter . 
  ok for dudes to fuck more than one , not ok for chicks . 
  i checked familysearch.org which is another lds website and it lists intellectual reserve like lds.org . 
  but that does n't mean they do n't own this one too . 
  but i doubt it . 
  there 's more than just lds inc. that hold the views on that site . 
  hey , chopping of someones head is not against any commandments , but rated r movies ; totally on that list of things never to do .
