  do n't forget mutual !, 
  oh and scouts for the boys . 
  and firesides . 
  general conference should be mentioned too !, 
  and church dances . 
  and breakfasts my stake would have from time to time . 
  oh and stake conference . 
  area conference too . 
  then there are the occasional other activities , breakfasts , camp outs , etc. 
  it 's kind of a whole life sink . 
  `` but what they called wine back then was only grape juice '' . 
  that line is seriously sometimes used since mormons do n't drink alcohol . 
  store bought bread and tap water , possibly filtered , not at my old ward ( church ) building . 
  there were a few occasions where someone forgot the bread and had to go buy it at the store , which is funny because mormons strongly discourage shopping on sundays . 
  some go as far as calling it a sin . 
  already taken . 
  ** mountain meadow massacre **, 
  welcome to arizona !, 
  do n't forget to bring a comb !, 
  have to have an armchair, 
  dude at work ruined me too . 
  he roasts his own coffee . 
  not quite commercial , he does it in his backyard . 
  he does buy green beans in 50 lb bags though . 
  also has many varieties and sells some of it . 
  now i roast my own beans . 
  started with a hot air popper , but those break too much . 
  now i just do it on the stove top in cast iron pan . 
  coffee 1 day after it 's roasted is about my favorite thing in the world . 
  then i got a fancy new electric kettle for tea and found out a lot of people use it for pour over brewing . 
  shit now i have to give that a try . 
  all happened because i heard the guy at work talking about espresso and asked a few questions and he threw me into the world of good coffee . 
  the holy spirit is also a separate person . 
  but has not received a body of flesh and bone , yet . 
  that 's the way mormons see the trinity . 
  the trinity , one god 3 roles . 
  god the father , the son , and the holy spirit . 
  the mormon view , one god 1 role . 
  the other roles in the bible , the son ( literall ) and the holy ghost , are delegated . 
  they sell them in 12 packs now at a convenience store i frequent . 
  pretty good . 
  probably have a training program running at the arizona air national guard on the border of phx and scottsdale . 
  a few months ago they had urban training and they would fly in lines , day and night , no running lights ( except the last one ) . 
  people have pictures of choppers below the top of high rises in downtown , pretty crazy . 
  i went up to window rock and there are just like 20 dogs that were hanging out near the mcdonalds drive through . 
  crazyness . 
  this also works in a lot of aspects of life too . 
  as for mormonism , if my family brings up something about mormonism i act as if it 's weird and if they ask i tell them that ( it 's not ok ) . 
  do n't go into detail , that just gives them ammunition to come back at you with . 
  of course if you know there are people that are reasonable , you can give reasons . 
  but for most of my family , they are lifers . 
  only get into specifics when you think there might be headway ( most of the time there wo n't be ) . 
  choose your battles . 
  i probably did n't put that very clearly , but something i wish more people understood . 
  news story https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35wpvr65vds, 
  sorry , ca n't find pictures . 
  but i personally saw a line of 5 ( or was it 4 ) black hawks fly to and from downtown and a line of about 6 what i think were huey 's do the same . 
  saw them fly there and back ( live in between ) . 
  only the rear heli had running lights on both runs . 
  it was really cool . 
  google fu not working right now , not finding pictures . 
  interesting first hand account posted here . 
  rant holding doors open is super annoying to me . 
  i 'm a dude and there a few guys i work with , if you 're 5 steps behind , they will just walk through . 
  2 steps behind , always hold it open . 
  3 or 4 steps ... who knows !, 
  it makes going through a door awkward with them . 
  it 's so fucking annoying !, 
  i know how the fuck to operate a door , we are going to the same location , there is no fucking need to hold it for me . 
  i 'm not even carrying anything !, 
  now i know another reason why it bugs some women . 
  that being said i do hold doors open in some cases , but i try to make it obvious i 'm going to so they do n't have to break stride . 
  some people are bad at doors . 
  that which is good is not uniquely mormon . 
  it can be found elsewhere . 
  that which is uniquely mormon is not good . 
  no reason for it to exist . 
  no coffee or tea . 
  not caffeine . 
  even though i was told it was * because * of the caffeine . 
  there was a press release on mormon news room last year . 
  now it 's just '' ** because we said so ** '' !, 
  now , iced coffee and tea ? 
  you get to decide !, 
  `` is n't just the fact that mormons need to be told by their leaders that they wo n't be ` getting their own planets ' more than a bit odd ? '', 
  ramen !, 
  someone in my family is the only one i know on facebook who is `` upset by this attack on religious freedom '' . 
  also compared something obama did to something a racist , sexist or a muslim would do . 
  the `` my brothers keeper '' initiative . 
  did n't think they would stoop that low . 
  person was baptized in 1978 btw . 
  yup , no major wars . 
  they were always outgunned by a lot and so they kept moving until they had time to establish in utah . 
  they did have wars , though not extremely bloody . 
  mormon war may refer to :, 
  1838 mormon war ( aka missouri mormon war ) , a conflict in 1838 between latter day saints and their neighbors in northwestern missouri, 
  illinois mormon war , a conflict in 1844 -- 1846 between latter day saints and their neighbors in western illinois, 
  utah war , a conflict in 1857 -- 1858 between latter day saints in utah territory and the united states federal government, 
  that 's a cool map, 
  `` i belong to the church of ... '',
