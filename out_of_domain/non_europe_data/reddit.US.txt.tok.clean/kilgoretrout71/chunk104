  if a * secular * society guarantees its citizens the right to freely exercise their religion , and that right is hindered by a public law , and citizens petition the government for redress of this problem , and these citizens always lose their battles , then there is no guarantee of free exercise . 
  take emotion out of the equation . 
  use free speech instead . 
  if public laws always trump my right to free speech , i do n't really have free speech . 
  our constitution guarantees the right to free exercise . 
  citizens ' rights will always come into conflict with public laws at some point . 
  that 's why we have courts . 
  there is nothing about a secular society weighing its citizens ' constitutional claims against its own public laws -- sometimes winning and sometimes losing -- that offends secularism . 
  this is done in many , many different areas of public life other than with religion . 
  just because the constitutional right in conflict is one relating to religion , does n't mean that the government should always win against the claim to qualify as `` secular . '', 
  by the same token , atheists should n't bemoan people 's right to make free exercise claims just because we have no interest in making them ourselves . 
  if the government oversteps in acquiescing to such a claim , we have the establishment clause on our side . 
  zoom in . 
  why do you keep saying that i 'm ignoring the establishment clause ? 
  i 've brought it up repeatedly . 
  and the lemon holding makes my point :, 
   for a law to be considered constitutional under the establishment clause of the first amendment , the law must have a legitimate secular purpose , must not have the primary ** effect ** of either advancing ** or inhibiting ** religion , and also must not result in an excessive entanglement of government and religion . 
  government wins sometimes and loses sometimes , and in neither case is the secularism of the state offended . 
  read the [ compelling interest ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/free_exercise_clause#compelling_interest ) section of free exercise . 
  i have a feeling you do n't know what 's being argued here . 
  read the linked article , read the top comment , and then look at my comments . 
  * i am not trying to say that government has to bend over for religion whenever religion wants it to . 
  i told you i 'm not providing the entire context . 
  read what i said in context . 
  i 've covered the same ground many times over at this point . 
  comments are threaded to mitigate the need for that . 
  i 'm here for the people . 
  i do n't trust oligopolies . 
  i need buddies with cocaine . 
  my take was that people were going out of their way to be respectful toward an old man , and that those same people did n't really understand what the waffen ss was all about . 
  they kept talking about `` enlisted soldiers '' as if the ss were just garden variety soldiers . 
  and thanking the guy for his service was just kind of . 
  i dunno , retarded . 
  well look at sherlocksbeard over here . 
  i know reddit is cynical about this , but i actually think it 's a good thing when people resist the urge to be prejudicial . 
  in my lifetime ( 43 years ) i 've only seen it go as far as helmets . 
  my dad used to tell me about the uproar that was caused when they proposed making seatbelts mandatory in cars . 
  because seatbelts could be ordered as an option , the mandate was considered an affront to personal freedom and the free market . 
  i think the regulation has been vindicated . 
  in the case of cars , additional safety features have been mandated ( and i 'm fine with that ) , but as i said , i 've never seen any serious effort to require anything other than helmets for motorcyclists . 
  i did n't know people were still saying things like this until i found reddit . 
  even as a kid in the 80s , i thought that argument had been dead for a generation ( as were a lot of the people not subject to the regulation ) . 
  american here . 
  can confirm . 
  we pay one way or another . 
  if it 's not in taxes , it 's in insurance premiums or cost-shifted medical billing . 
  he said he was being sarcastic . 
  he supports universal healthcare . 
  you can control the type and amount of a substance you put into your body , but you can not control everyone 's behavior on the road . 
  accidents happen that are not your fault . 
  if you support taxpayer-funded healthcare , then i do n't see how indifference to behaviors that will lead to higher costs makes sense . 
  even without the taxpayer system , the public has an interest because of insurance premiums . 
  and the lives , too . 
  i 'm not sure what the other commenter is talking about , but i wo n't rule out the possibility that he knows something i do n't . 
  in any case , i believe he is wrong , and that you are right . 
  the rationale behind fcc regulation of broadcast media was that the frequency range was limited and could therefore not be privately owned , but instead had to be licensed . 
  certain standards were necessary to qualify for a license , including `` decency '' standards . 
  because cable is n't limited in this way , it does n't have to abide by those standards , but it often does anyway to avoid pissing off its audience and/or advertisers . 
  btw , network news came out of this arrangement . 
  in addition to decency standards , there was a requirement that a certain amount of broadcast time be dedicated to `` public service . '', 
  news was the go-to idea for fulfilling this requirement . 
  we should totally turn our roads the other way like yours are . 
  well , and public health , too . 
  the same could be said of most laws or regulations . 
  the thing is , you and i might manage to live our lives just fine with every possible risk in place , but we are not the public . 
  the public is the public . 
  and we 're part of it . 
  okay , i missed that particular angle . 
  i 'm used to seeing bipolar arguments on reddit . 
  their customers are the public , so in that sense , yes . 
  the interest group that includes all of us . 
  edit : am i wrong ? 
  how is a public law about public health only supporting `` interest groups , '' when the entire public sufferers for your `` freedom '' ? 
  you know , my sister and her fiancee are quintessential tea partiers with this attitude , but here 's an interesting fact : her fiancee has a teenage son who was diagnosed with cancer . 
  his medical costs were in the hundreds of thousands , even after his pre-aca insurance coverage . 
  what was the response from mr. freedom and responsibility ? 
  `` i 'm not paying it . '', 
  that 's what it was . 
  you know who * is * paying it ? 
  you and i and everyone else , that 's who . 
  we 're that `` interest group '' you were talking about . 
  edit : in retrospect , i can see that i misunderstood the comment . 
  yes , freedom does win out over money in the u.s. , and quite often too , depending on the area of law . 
  when it comes to basic civil rights the costs to the state are high just protecting them . 
  when it comes to traffic laws , not so much . 
  i know it 's framed that way , but it 's a rather silly thing in my opinion . 
  the roads are public and are subject to public laws . 
  if the complaint were about what happens on a private road then perhaps there would be an issue of freedom to discuss , but unless you also pay the entire cost when you fracture your skull , the public still has an interest . 
  no , i understood your sarcasm . 
  my comment was meant in support of yours . 
  unfortunately , it 's not unreasonable to expect intransigence and incivility here . 
  i try not to be the thing that so often frustrates me . 
  it has butt-tons of impact on others . 
  i think your argument holds for safe recreational drugs and other `` consensual crimes , '' but when you need $ 500k worth of medical attention because you did n't wear a seatbelt , i 'm going to pay either through higher insurance premiums , cost-shifted medical billing ( usually both ) , or taxes . 
  it only fails to affect me as long as you 're accident-free . 
  plus , i think i was referring to the mandate that manufacturers include seatbelts in all cars ( i ca n't see the comment at the moment ) , which is a pretty big deal . 
  laws saying you have to * wear * them are different ( though i support them as well ) . 
  you can smoke in your own space , but most driving occurs on public roads and is therefore subject to public laws . 
  my enjoyment is diminished by traffic lights , but i accept them because the roads were n't built for my personal enjoyment . 
  edit : i must have gotten this wrong .
