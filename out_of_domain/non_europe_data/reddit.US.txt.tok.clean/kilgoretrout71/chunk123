  it 's the same type of hatred that you get when someone cuts you in line at the supermarket . 
  that type of anger that induces a little whence in the back of your neck and a shiver of anger echoing through the vestiges of your body . 
  that anger stems from my feeling that srs is the personification of all the ills of society . 
  srs represents the corporate greed corroding the foundations of the things i love , the person looking for a handout , the one who 's always looking to blame others instead of their own ineptitude , the person quick to use lawyers and sue instead of having a personal conversation . 
  srs is an adulterer and a liar and srs has abused the goodwill of our society for its own personal gain . 
  in short , srs is the type to cut its piece of the pie from the middle and still get mad when you eat the crust . 
  and it 's these very things about srs that represents the moral decay i despise . 
  i honestly can say this with a straight face . 
  i despise srs . 
  i do n't wish srs any physical harm because i 'm not that type of person , but i just wish srs would disappear from this website and by proxy my life in general . 
  srs needs to be fired ; since srs has held the position of ceo bad things have happened here . 
  negative things . 
  it 's time reddit shed srs and move on . 
  every video i watch , every snippet i see and every interview i read about srs induces a hatred i have n't felt for someone in a long time . 
  it 's not an implicit hatred like i would have for a murderer , psychopath or a bully . 
  no , it 's a lot more nuanced than that .

  what i really want to know is , what could a dead guy be so angry about ?

  i have no idea either way , but i 've read many comments complaining that / r/tifu is loaded with fake stories . 
  i 'm not a subscriber . 
  * shrug *, 
  typically they do criminal and child abuse background checks , and these would n't catch something like that . 
  previous employers do n't lie , but they omit a lot of information . 
  these days , a former employer will usually only confirm that you worked there and give the starting and end dates of employment . 
  somebody should tell john boehner . 
  you seem no less like a `` pisssy child '' when you ascribe your pet peeve to `` leftists . '', 
  real grownups do n't oversimplify things in this way . 
  you also negate your own point by supplying what is to you a valid object of criticism , and then failing to demonstrate that it 's not in play here . 
  inequality of opportunity does not require a `` weird ass caste system . '', 
  it is a fundamental condition of nearly every society on the planet , varying only by degree . 
  and there 's nothing wrong with complaining about effects as opposed to causes . 
  just remember that the last laugh is on you . 
  and no `` purity tests '' for me , either . 
  i 'm very liberal , dammit !, 
  * wont, 
  haha !, 
  have n't heard jello in a long time . 
  that was great . 
  also , nice flower . 
  and hey , i notice you 're danish . 
  i got married in denmark 25 years ago in november . 
  we had little money and could n't eat out much so we had to buy groceries while we were there , but our little hotel did n't have a fridge , so we hung our plastic bag full of food out the window to keep it cold . 
  my favorite picture from the trip is the front of this brick hotel called alnor kro -- clean and pristine , except for the little bag hanging out the second-floor window . 
  i know , you did n't ask . 
  but i do n't get to talk to danes much , so you won the lottery and got to hear this . 
  cheers !, 
  really , i do n't know who * would * make such a claim . 
  the term is pretty ridiculous on its face , even without the juvenile context in which it 's typically used . 
  but more to your point , yeah , when you 're talking with americans ( especially on reddit ) you have to remember the way we bastardize certain terms and ideas . 
  and it 's not a stretch at all in this context . 
  to many americans , the terms democrat , progressive , liberal , and socialist are all but synonymous . 
  to many american redditors , you could throw sjw onto that list . 
  every ideological persuasion has extremist elements , and so-called progressives or liberals are no exception . 
  the problem , though , is that once you come up with a clown hat for these people to wear , opponents begin dressing even those only slightly so inclined in the same hat . 
  it 's pointless to use the term sjw to apply only to extreme cases at this point , because people routinely use the term to describe anyone who even hints at siding with victims . 
  checkmate , sjws . 
  wow , haha !, 
  well , yeah . 
  my sense is that -- especially in american political culture , where the system itself forces people into one of two camps -- people become wary of `` code . '', 
  and i think we 're all guilty to some degree of pigeonholing people based on that one telltale , um . 
  tell -- be it vegetarianism , lgbt support/tolerance/indifference , party affiliation , or what-have-you . 
  i mean , this sub is all about picking up on these cues . 
  every post here is saying `` yeah , you 're totally not x , because you said y. '', 
  so it 's not an * invalid * lens through which one can view things , but there are risks involved . 
  many people in my own family have the same * sentiments * i do , but would n't express them as freely as i do because the people in their social and extended kinship networks would see it as a red flag of sorts . 
  there 's a risk of alienation . 
  i guess i could go on about this all night , but i 'll spare both of us and wrap it up by saying that in situations like the one you described , i try to use humor wherever possible . 
  i dunno -- `` yeah , i do n't eat meat . 
  but do n't worry , the communists already kicked me out of the party . '', 
  ( i did n't say i was good . ), 
  i just think it 's better to defuse a situation than to appear as if you really * are * trying to hide something .
