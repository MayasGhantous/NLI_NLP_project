  get it ? 
  no , state . 
  unless the children were eagles or something . 
  as a 42 year old , let me assure you that your old self is gone for good . 
  touch\u00e9 !, 
   agree . 
  i just took a peak in there now, 
  op , please label nsfw . 
  does n't mean he has to like having them around . 
  i was a republican once . 
  [ * shudder * ], 
  nope . 
  he 'd have charges in two states , and the two states would work out an agreement on where he 'd do his time if convicted . 
  i 'm not an expert , but i believe that if kidnapping were involved , there could be a federal charge , but i think it would only apply if he were n't the actual parent . 
  i think the uninitiated are misconstruing your construal there . 
  you 're telling me that all the controversy is about people trying to * fix * children ? 
  the more you know . 
  maybe similar math to that which has the u.s. prospering as a whole while most of the people in it are struggling in one way or another . 
  well , this is only tangentially related , but i also notice people making unnecessary plugs for sriracha everywhere i turn . 
  maybe it 's just me , but i 've come to think that mentioning sriracha is code for something . 
  maybe it 's `` odd '' because the person does n't consider him/herself particularly nationalistic , but gets that reaction anyway . 
  maybe try this in / r/youshouldknow . 
  interesting !, 
  i use the happy birthday song to remember my name . 
  hahaha !, 
  um , you can call it whatever you want , man . 
  it 's a general statement , sure , but it is backed up by data . 
  i would retrieve that data if you were expressing polite skepticism , but you 're just being a douche so i wo n't waste my time . 
  thanks . 
  was n't aiming for relevance , fortunately . 
  just a bit of opportunism . 
  i think i understand now . 
  since self-interest trumps non-aggression , all of us `` takers '' who vote for statist , aggressive policies are * already * living in accordance with libertarian principles . 
  they 're already * in * their utopia and do n't even know it !, 
  a fair point !, 
  blue steer . 
  ok , so we have a girl who asks facebook if `` insurance '' covers abortions , never mind that every company and every plan is different , and never mind that this is the least discreet way of finding your answer short of taking a full-page ad out in the new york times . 
  and we have a doe-eyed fiancee who accepts at face value 1 ) that she conceived without sex , and 2 ) that for some reason the pregnancy test he `` found '' belongs to another girl , and then reacts with some kind of aw , shucks . 
  i know stupid is plentiful , but the only stupid here is in the comments where people are falling for this . 
  edit : i think i should note , too , that if this were real , then op is capping with a cell phone and stitching the caps together on a pc . 
  god , i think i know who buys the stuff on infomercials now . 
  edit 2 : right , so , as i said , it 's bullshit . 
  you can see for yourself [ here ] ( http://i.imgur.com/3dhc84t.jpg ) and [ here ] ( http://i.imgur.com/it6wgkp.jpg ) . 
  for op 's juvenile response you can look [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/cringepics/comments/28x4vw/there_are_too_many_quotes_to_pick_just_one_found/cifjwct ) . 
  top comment is collecting karma like a black hole . 
  very few people are actually thinking here . 
  and just look at the `` boyfriend 's '' tone throughout . 
  it just reeks of fakeness . 
  like the people in this thread who believe this is real . 
  do n't forget that she asked * facebook * whether insurance covers abortions . 
  i 'm sure that was your first instinct , too , right ? 
  because we would n't want this thing getting out , now . 
  i think op edited it . 
  the link you gave me does n't work , but the link in the top comment is working for me . 
  here 's a direct link to the image : http://i.imgur.com/nd96bg4.jpg, 
  right . 
  it 's actually worse than the details themselves . 
  i know people can be quick on the computer sometimes , but op is supposedly making screen shots , making a collage of the screen shots , captioning the collage in various places , uploading to imgur , and linking here , in a space of minutes . 
  do n't think so . 
  also , the screen shots are mobile and the collage had to be done on a pc , so there 's that , too . 
  it 's as big a mystery as why op would cap the feed with a mobile in order to stitch the caps together on a pc . 
  some things are just best to the philosophers i guess . 
  not the point . 
  he posted the first two caps , which had to be put together on a pc , then posted a third cap which had been made on a phone . 
  and for some reason the top is missing from the third cap . 
  why would someone cap with a phone , stitch with a pc , then cap with a phone again ? 
  why is the top missing from the third cap ? 
  why not just cap on the pc , where you would n't have to stitch the images together ? 
  because it 's bullshit , that 's why . 
  and this was surely much easier to do than capping from the pc in the first place , where you would n't have to stitch anything . 
  i think i get it now . 
  what were your intentions [ here ] ( http://i.imgur.com/3dhc84t.jpg ) , then ? 
  [ happy now ? 
  i do n't care what you own . 
  that 's an analysis of the picture you uploaded . 
  it 's just metadata embedded in the file that shows several things , including the photoshop process that op used to fake the screen caps . 
  i do n't doubt that the images are circulating , but they 're photoshopped . 
  the * text * in them is photoshopped . 
  even the edits are visible . 
  they mean that they 're not screen caps , as op said they were . 
  the text was applied using photoshop layers . 
  a `` flat '' image , such as an actual screen cap , would n't show the text of a capture in the metadata . 
  who is persisting ? 
  did you look at the links to the metadata posted above ? 
  the `` screen caps '' were manufactured in photoshop . 
  so , however real these people are , the screen caps are fake . 
  if you know those people , then ask them why someone fabricated an interaction between them in photoshop . 
  haha , ok , you had me there for a bit . 
  look , i 'm not saying the whole thing is n't clever or funny . 
  i may have done something similar 20 years ago , if it had been possible then . 
  i do n't * really * care , but i have to say i was pressed on more by people nitpicking my skepticism than by op himself . 
  of course , i did n't fake anything at all , and you know that . 
  but as a token of goodwill , i 'll donate 10 % of my karma to charity anyway . 
  they were png files . 
  two of the pics he uploaded were png files , and the data is there . 
  one of them seems to be gone , but the one linked to the post is still there . 
  if you 're looking at the final pic , which is a jpg , that data has indeed been stripped . 
  first , i want to give credit to / u/greatdominions for suggesting this be posted here , and to / u/excellentgary who submitted this already . 
  i submitted it again myself because excellentgary 's post seemed to miss a rule or two , and also because i 'm the one who called the bullshit . 
  i saw the post in passing and thought it was bullshit just due to the circumstances , but op kept insisting that his `` screen caps '' of a facebook conversation were genuine , and i felt like i was in a circlejerk shitstorm with all the skepticism of my skepticism , so , after finding that two of the files posted by op were png files , i checked the metadata and linked to it [ here ] ( http://i.imgur.com/3dhc84t.jpg ) and [ here ] ( http://i.imgur.com/it6wgkp.jpg ) .
