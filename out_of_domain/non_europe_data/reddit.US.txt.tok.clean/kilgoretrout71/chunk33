  also , til that means i 'm #rekt . 
  funny thing is , i really do n't give a crap about any of this . 
  but after having my skepticism doubted and downvoted so much by people who * so * wanted to believe that a guy would accept his `` fiancee 's '' claim of a virgin pregnancy , and that a pregnancy test he found in * his house * actually belonged to the girl 's friend , even though the same girl asked two weeks before on facebook whether `` insurance covers abortions , '' i just had to find something that would shut people up . 
  as i said in that thread , there 's plenty of stupid around , but the only stupid in that thread was in the comments , where people were falling for op 's story . 
  well , you can believe whatever you want . 
  if it 's really important for you to believe that some guy with a fiancee who posted a question to facebook asking whether insurance covers abortions , who weeks later found a positive pregnancy test in his bathroom , would accept without any skepticism that 1 ) his fiancee is pregnant , * and * a virgin , and that 2 ) she 's not really pregnant , because the positive pregnancy test was her friend 's and not hers , then by all means , believe that . 
  it makes no difference to me at all . 
  just believe that the guy who claims he took op 's two png files and checked the metadata , and posted that metadata , is really the one who is faking stuff here . 
  because that 's so much more plausible than the idea of someone faking a ridiculous story using photoshop . 
  if you * really * want an ironclad case , download the png file yourself and check the metadata yourself . 
  you do n't have to be sherlock holmes . 
  sure . 
  the real damning stuff is at the top . 
  it shows photoshop activity , specifically the addition of text in the form of `` layers . '', 
  an actual screen capture would be `` flat . '', 
  think of it like a drawing on paper , and transparencies laid over the paper . 
  if the text is part of the drawing , the way it would be if it were a flat screen cap , then it would n't be seen in the metadata . 
  it would just be `` part of the picture . '', 
  but with text added in layers , it 's as if it were written on transparencies , and this is recorded in the metadata . 
  it 's like the `` picture '' is in one place and the transparency is in another now , and this clearly shows that the text was purposefully placed into the image . 
  the image was manufactured , not captured from a screen . 
  i can accept that . 
  i was a little primed by people who were were n't joking at all , so i easily could have overlooked the underlying humor . 
  if the file is saved a certain way , in a certain format , yes . 
  but generally not . 
  i 'm not really sure about png files , tbh . 
  i 'd have to check . 
  in my experience , the layers have only been preserved when i 've saved in the photoshop format ( psd ) , but that 's because i have n't worked much with other formats . 
  edit : to clarify further , most of the time , people save in the jpg format . 
  the image has to be flattened to do this , so if you encounter a photoshopped jpg , you definitely ca n't undo the work . 
  he was careful this time to keep the damning metadata out , but it still shows an adobe signature , which does n't say much by itself , but the ela analysis shows different compression levels in all the text areas , which makes it smell like bullshit to me . 
  he 's basically using the same m.o. 
  yeah , ok , i was just gon na let this go because i do n't really give a shit . 
  until i read people being sincere and gullible , and then i do . 
  a little . 
  enough to point out that op 's full of shit . 
  again . 
  just like last night . 
  anyway , believe what you want , but [ here ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dx2qyky.jpg ) is what text from a real screen shot looks like with ela . 
  notice the separate words ? 
  the outline of letters ? 
  notice the defined rectangular shapes where the text goes ? 
  those are text boxes , which is what op used to fabricate the graphic you guys are cringing and pouring your hearts out over . 
  that 's all . 
  believe it , or do n't . 
  at least you 've been informed . 
  fair enough . 
  but i did n't mean to imply he edited a screenshot . 
  i do n't think a screenshot was ever made . 
  your example was different from mine , but one thing it did not have is long , rectangular boxes where the text goes . 
  the image is a photoshop fabrication . 
  i 'm not going to debate you . 
  op made a bullshit post yesterday in which he neglected to remove the metadata that demonstrated unequivocally that he 'd fabricated the `` screen caps '' and the story . 
  this time he cleaned the metadata and improved on the plausibility of the presentation , but he 's still full of shit . 
  it 's ok , though . 
  i 'm not trying to win a battle . 
  believe whatever you want . 
  hahaha , awesome . 
  i 'm totally done now . 
  you 're good enough for the gullible , i 'll give you that . 
  you 're proving , anyway , that most people are nearly as dumb as your fake characters . 
  do n't think i did n't notice how you obscured the `` 18 hours ago '' in this pic . 
  and people will come by and make me out as the dick for noticing . 
  they 're all yours , man . 
  upvote for the mea culpa . 
  update :, 
  i was a bit dumbfounded last night when someone pointed out that the op mentioned here had posted another fake facebook thread to / r/cringepics , and right on the heels of having been called out for this one . 
  so i checked it out and went back and forth a bit about whether to say anything there . 
  this is n't how i usually spend my time , and i have no interest in engaging in a protracted witch hunt . 
  but i decided to say something anyway , partly due to the sincerity of the comments on the post , partly to the brazenness of a second hoax perpetrated so soon after the first , and partly because of what i 'd thought to be a petulant response to being called out the first time . 
  so i got up this morning to a couple of surprising pms . 
  one was an apology from a commenter who 'd given me some crap in op 's first post , and the other was from op himself . 
  he was polite and apologetic . 
  he 'd made another / r/cringepics post calling himself out for both fake submissions , and i told him i 'd link to it here , so [ here it is ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/cringepics/comments/291uk7/op_fakes_a_few_posts_attempts_to_backtrack/ ) . 
  people have different attitudes about stuff like this . 
  some people might get on op 's case about this or that . 
  i 'm not going to say anyone is right or wrong for what they think . 
  as far as i 'm concerned , though , i 've encountered so many people on reddit who wo n't give an inch on some of the most indefensible stuff , that i 'm willing to accept op 's gesture as sincere and follow through with his request to help clear the air . 
  this sub places value on an op 's response to being called out , and i think this response is among the most contrite i 've seen . 
  that 's my take , anyway . 
  well , i see that op has engaged in some self-defense here . 
  for the record , i thought his first post was so transparently false that i was more pissed at the commenters for believing it than i was at op for making the post . 
  but i agree with people here that his staunch defenses sully his point , and while i thought his first post was more silly than anything , i found the second one to be insensitive to people who have suffered the loss of a loved one . 
  for what it 's worth , op seems more contrite now . 
  i remind myself of how firmly people can dig in over the most nonsensical stuff , and realize that op 's position seems to have evolved in the right direction . 
  everyone puts up a guard of some kind when they 're called out . 
  and while i disagree with op 's justifications , i still see them as a normal reaction to an embarrassment . 
  he posted to / r/cringepics again , calling himself out for both posts , [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/cringepics/comments/291uk7/op_fakes_a_few_posts_attempts_to_backtrack/ ) . 
  you can interpret the gesture however you want , and that 's fine . 
  but op apologized to me personally , and i choose to accept the apology . 
  yeah , same here , actually . 
  but when i called it out on logic alone i got downvotes and all kinds of crap from both commenters and op himself . 
  i really only went for the metadata to get another commenter to shut up , at first . 
  people * really * want to believe implausible stuff sometimes . 
  for what it 's worth , op sent me an apologetic pm and then called himself out on two fake posts in / r/cringepics . 
  i accepted his apology and told him i 'd link to his admission , so you can find it [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/cringepics/comments/291uk7/op_fakes_a_few_posts_attempts_to_backtrack/ ) if you 're interested . 
  not everyone will see it in the same light , but i 'll give him credit for stepping forward , anyway . 
  yes , i agree . 
  that played a role in my decision to call him out a second time . 
  even a ;-) would have probably tipped the scale for me , because it would be an acknowledgement of sorts , and one could argue that anyone who cared enough would be able to find it .
