  i just did n't want to cast the net too wide for fear of getting sucked into the rabbit hole of `` well , this is n't 100 % correct . 
  i can name three countries that blah , blah , blah '' and all the hair splitting that ensues the slightest over-generalization in these parts . 
  now please do n't say `` but people split hairs in all of western culture . 
  if these remarks were tempered enough to be true i might agree with some of them . 
  i certainly agree that idealism has to be adjusted for real-world conditions , but what i see too often coming from people on your side of the fence is the dismissal of such policy preferences as * ipso facto * irrational , doomed to failure , irresponsible , or what have you , as well as a great deal of hyperbole backed up by cherry-picked examples . 
  `` everything they do is a fuckup , '' `` leaders who ca n't do shit , '' and `` everything is falling apart '' are examples of such hyperbole and invoking the admittedly bad healthcare.gov rollout as if it were just one of many examples of systemic incompetence is a fine use of cherry picking . 
  look , i have two kids in this dominant reddit demographic and i have had to repeatedly stress to my daughter in particular that you ca n't govern yourself entirely by the heart . 
  in my opinion that 's good advice for both people and governments . 
  but ridiculing and dismissing idealistic goals is just throwing the baby out with the bathwater . 
  and while i know it does n't sit well with everybody , the truth is that governments can and do bring about desirable social change proactively . 
  it took a war to end slavery , for god 's sake . 
  ( please do n't come back with the whole `` the war was n't about slavery '' argument . 
  * pretty please ? 
  * ) i mean , i would * think * you see it as a good thing that a hotel owner in georgia ca n't refuse a room to a black couple because they 're black . 
  shortly after civil rights laws were passed in the 60s , though , a hotel owner fought for his right to be able to do so , and thankfully lost the case . 
  who would openly fight for such a thing today ? 
  hardly anyone . 
  and we partly have proactive , idealistic government policy to thank for that fact . 
  finally , i 'm not sure what your issue is with `` cultural relativism . '', 
  is there something about cultural relativism that is bad ? 
  i mean , to use a popular paradigm from the right , is n't the cultural universe a lot like a marketplace , where costs and benefits can be weighed and some notions pursued while others are rejected ? 
  if businesses did n't engage in `` industry relativism '' a lot more of them would fail than currently do . 
  i just do n't see what could possibly be wrong with understanding cultural malleability or using that knowledge to make an argument or advocate change . 
  what exactly is your problem with it ? 
  ** tl ; dr : ** it 's an exaggeration to imply that `` liberals '' wish to govern on idealistic principles to the exclusion of practical concerns , as much as it is narrow minded to reject idealistic concerns for the fact that they 're idealistic . 
  also , the term `` cultural relativism '' is thrown around as a pejorative here and elsewhere , and yet i 've rarely , if ever , seen an argument advanced that effectively explains what is wrong with it . 
  edit : deleted comments were mine . 
  tablet said my post failed a few times when it actually had n't . 
   [ hyperbole ; unsubstantiated generalizations . ], 
   yes , there is value to realism . 
  if you do n't understand my post saying that empathy has to be balanced with realism and competence , or you think that 's some kind of extreme position , then you 're delusional and so is your post . 
  my comment was primarily in response to your claim that `` the world , and this generation of millenials , are starting to get a sense of how government and world stability can deteriorate when ** all the focus ** is on social relativism and helping everyone be fulfilled and nurturing every soul . 
  ( emphasis mine ) . 
  this is a straw man argument . 
  if you disagree , then please demonstrate how the people you are criticizing are either doing this or advocating that this be done . 
   again , if you think it 's a rejection `` idealistic concerns '' to say that idealism should be balanced with realism , you 're outside the lines of any reasonable discussion/debate with a conservative . 
  please see the comment to which you responded , in which i said no such thing , and in fact advocated the same position you claim to be advocating now . 
  if we both agree that idealism and realism should be balanced , then one of us should stop pretending that the other advocates putting `` all the focus '' on whatever idealistic goals he does n't agree with . 
  weird . 
  i translated it to `` ooo da doodie doo di da oom bork bork bork . '',

  i 'm a team player . 
  i have stuff from ikea .

  and thanks !, 
  it was through an act of desperation in a different context that my wife and i met two of our closest friends . 
  twenty years ago we moved here , a place where we had no friends or family around . 
  we were restarting our lives from the ground up and had to grab some low-wage jobs just to get the ball rolling . 
  the bigger problem , though , was that our daughter was still a toddler and there was no way we could afford a proper daycare program for her . 
  i was having a hell of a time finding something we could afford that was suitable and was becoming desperate and disillusioned . 
  then i saw this woman walking with her 3-year-old daughter , and i really just wanted to know what the hell she does with that kid when she goes to work . 
  i figured i really have nothing to lose at this point , so i approached her and asked her . 
  as luck would have it she and her husband had a background similar to the one i shared with my wife . 
  we became good friends , helped each other out with childcare from time to time , and we 've stayed close all these years . 
  that 's why you ca n't build a bridge out of it . 
  sounds like a pickle you can play dress-up with . 
  it 's weird how this stuff takes on a viral character . 
  i 'm 43 and i 've spent my entire cognizant life with a clear understanding that my parents ' generation were known as baby boomers and that mine had taken on the label of generation x. 
  and even up to several months ago i had never heard baby boomers collectively blamed for anything other than being alive and getting old , which is now starting to put a strain on social security and other entitlements . 
  then , as if out of nowhere , i happened upon a massive circlejerk related to today 's high cost of college education , wherein it was widely claimed and accepted as fact that `` baby boomers '' had voted themselves `` massive subsidies '' and then voted them away after full advantage had been taken . 
  of course , not one example of a specific instance was provided . 
  and there seemed to be a huge misunderstanding about what `` baby boomer '' means , not to mention that said generation neither unilaterally agreed on policy nor considered being drafted or paying mortgage rates in the teens to be living the dream . 
  i thought it was a weird , isolated circlejerky thing at the time . 
  now i see it 's apparently become a `` thing . '', 
  here 's the thing . 
  you said `` an in-joke is a meme . '', 
  is it in the same family ? 
  yes . 
  no one 's arguing that . 
  as someone who is a redditor who studies memes , i am telling you , specifically , on reddit , no one calls in-jokes memes . 
  if you want to be `` specific '' like you said , then you should n't either . 
  they 're not the same thing . 
  if you 're saying `` meme family '' you 're referring to the taxonomic grouping of memeidae , which includes things from puns to one-liners to satirical repetitions of the very thing you 're railing against . 
  so your reasoning for calling an in-joke a meme is because random people `` call the in-jokes memes ? '', 
  let 's get cumboxes and broken arms in there , then , too . 
  it 's okay to just admit you 're wrong , you know ? 
  i 'm sorry , i was just riffing on your comment with the very thing you were complaining about . 
  it 's a shortened , adapted version of the unidan in-joke that 's been making its rounds for weeks now . 
  to be honest i totally agree with your point and i 'm being hypocritical and unoriginal by making this joke . 
  but that 's also kinda the joke . 
  sorry for the confusion if there was any . 
  for a second i was wondering why a bad economy would result in massive hair martyrdom . 
  it was the [ occupation with the highest risk for homicide ] ( http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/96-100/homicide.html ) at the time . 
  the source does a fine job of explaining that . 
  if you 're not satisfied with what i provided in the comment you 're invited to click on the link . 
  that 's why i put it there . 
  here 's the thing . 
  or even difficult . 
  in fact it was easy as . 
  * something * . 
  me neither . 
  i was so happy to find that place . 
  there 's a lot of crap out there claiming to have `` reviews '' of various mattresses that are really marketing tools . 
  we spent * weeks * researching the damn things after coming within an inch of making a really regrettable sleep number purchase , and that site helped quite a bit with clearing the fog . 
  ended up going with talalay latex and we 're very happy with it ( and spent $ 1k less than we would have on that sleep number ) . 
  i think you 're confusing two ideas here . 
  a company that fails to adapt to a changing market fails itself more than it fails its customers . 
  in fact , it 's practically this way by definition because a `` changing market '' implies that people * are * having their needs met -- elsewhere , in this case . 
  i mean , yes , blockbuster failed me by charging me late fees when netflix did n't .
