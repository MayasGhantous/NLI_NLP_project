  so even on an international scale it 's mostly black people on the receiving end of justice . 
  i think a catch-22 is pretty much helleresque . 
  i 've seen this sentiment expressed before and i think it has some merit , but i think the problem with this idea is rooted in the stated purpose of the networks . 
  the * sole * purpose ( ostensibly , anyway ) of cnn or fox news is to inform , with the latter even using the oft-mocked tagline `` fair and balanced . '', 
  i think your observation is valid , except that tds really * was * `` just a comedy show '' when it began , and so it does retain some right to refer to itself as such when held up to entire networks devoted to informing the public . 
  it 's like a pizza joint that happens to have beef wellington on the menu , which happens to be favored by critics more than that of nearby four-star restaurants . 
  yes , it 's served on a paper plate and there are no suitable wine pairings , but hey , it * is * a pizza joint . 
  well , that 's my 9 a.m. analogy , anyway . 
  well , i was n't going to nitpick that part , but since you brought it up i guess i have to say that i do n't see anything kafkaesque here . 
  that term is usually applied when something bizarre , inexplicable , and beyond one 's control is happening . 
  sorry if that comes off as pedantic . 
  i 'm not trying to be a dick , even if i 've managed to seem like one . 
  i did n't criticize the catch-22 reference . 
  no , i do n't . 
  i mean , i get your * point , * and really , i probably would n't have bothered commenting if i 'd known it would require this much explanation . 
  i 'm not trying to say that you 've committed some kind of unforgiveable error or that your idea is invalid . 
  i just do n't see this situation as having the requisite elements to warrant the label `` kafkaesque . '', 
  i suppose if you wanted to split hairs finely enough you could say that anything that resembles something kafka wrote is `` kafkaesque . '', 
  it would be at least be as logically sound as , dare i say , calling a jackdaw a crow . 
  but people do n't use the term that way very often . 
  ( it would most likely be used that way in a discussion of literature . ), 
  i think you have to look at more than just the trial to get a sense of where the term applies more fittingly . 
  if you consider the trial together with the metamorphosis , for example , you can see that the situation with these prisoners just is n't surreal and bizarre enough to deserve the label . 
  however the prisoners ' intentions do n't match our fears , they * do * know why they 're there . 
  yes , it sucks and there very well could be all kinds of dissonance at work there , but if you put their situation up against that of waking up one day to find that you 've become a giant insect , it just falls short . 
  great , i feel dirty now . 
  seriously , call it whatever you want . 
  hence my parenthetical . 
  your point is a given , and it applies to comedy central as well . 
  since everyone is pursuing profit here , we can look beyond the baseline to see what else is going on . 
  this is why we 're not comparing news networks with , say , wal-mart . 
  ah , i see your point . 
  right , that makes sense . 
  thanks . 
  yes , i get that this is what 's `` really happening . '', 
  but my point is that the networks project something to the public that they expect to draw viewers . 
  they are therefore `` selling '' the idea of `` we 're worth watching '' to that public . 
  i mean , i can alter the semantics and make the same point :, 
  cnn and fox news sell advertising and draw viewers to that advertising by offering them `` news '' that is supposed to be verified and delivered in good faith . 
  comedy central draws viewers by offering them comedy . 
  in the case of the daily show , viewers are becoming informed as a bonus . 
  if the daily show dropped the news element , some viewers would stick around for the comedy . 
  if cnn and fox news did the same , well . 
  thanks for the clarification . 
  the term `` keynesian '' typically refers to government deficit spending during economic downturns for the sake of stimulating the economy . 
  i 'm sure there are additional nuances , but to my knowledge regulation and the free market are n't really at issue in the keynesian model . 
  i remember when mp3s first popped up on usenet and i was like `` yeah , right . 
  like i 'm gon na download a * song * that would fill three or four floppies . 
  no thanks . '', 
  even if he was just trying to spruce things up in the bedroom ? 
  oak-kay guys , enough . 
  it seems to me that the damage caused to our international standing by allowing these things to happen in the first place is only made worse by our failure to hold people accountable . 
  in my view it 's about precision . 
  the mistake made by thesaurus jockeys is assuming that synonyms are just alternatives for expressing the same thing . 
  and while in some cases they * can * be exactly that , it 's important to remember that different words with the `` same '' meaning exist for a reason . 
  to say `` he pulled a tooth '' gets the job done , but it 's a rather blunt way of saying `` he extracted a tooth , '' which has a more precise meaning and creates more vivid imagery ( if it 's what you mean to say , of course ) . 
  that 's why a good vocabulary can only be developed through extensive reading ( of properly edited works ) . 
  it 's through repeated exposure to words used in their proper context that one gets a sense of how these synonyms are best employed . 
  ( or `` used , '' if you will . ), 
  the best advice here would take your circumstances into account ( i.e. , whether english is your first language , your education level , your specific goals , etc. 
  ) , but since you asked about `` general vocabulary improvement '' we 'll skip those questions for now . 
  first , i 'd recommend material that has a `` literary '' target audience . 
  and i know that 's not very helpful by itself , so to clarify , i 'm referring to a broad category of writing that is primarily made up of serious fiction . 
  the reason i did n't just say `` serious fiction '' is that there 's a lot of great stuff out there aimed at people who * appreciate * serious fiction , that is n't itself fiction . 
  or serious , even . 
  the key , i think , is to seek material written with a more `` artful '' intent than informational . 
  in my experience , authors who care as much or more about * how * they tell their story as they do about the story itself , are the ones who will be especially attentive to the nuances in their word choices . 
  of course , there are plenty of exceptions to this , but since i 'm trying to cast the net as wide as i can here , i believe this to be a good starting point . 
  if you 're looking for more specific recommendations of this type either i or someone else in the thread might be able to match some authors or titles with your interests . 
  the other thing i 'd recommend is going after material that is * juuust * outside of your comfort zone in terms of difficulty . 
  it does n't do much good to read volumes of stuff that is already well within your range . 
  and i would argue that going * too * far out of your range could leave you both unsatisfied and discouraged . 
  if you 're in high school , for example , i would n't use james joyce or thomas pynchon as a starting point , but i might suggest reaching for something a little tougher than harry potter . 
  ( not picking on hp , just pulled it out as an example . ), 
  as for me , i happen to be a big fan of kurt vonnegut . 
  his stuff has range , too . 
  his novels are pretty accessible , for the most part , but his nonfiction books require a bit more effort in general , i would say . 
  anyway , the key thing is to keep yourself challenged , but not to the point where you 're not enjoying what you read . 
  if you 'd like more information or you have more questions i 'd be happy to help however i can . 
  i see . 
  yes , this helps me understand your original comment more . 
  i 've come across stuff written by and about posner from time to time but never took a close look at * him , * really . 
  thanks . 
  this comment is at best substantially convoluted and at worst not not all fucked up . 
  upvoted for the honest effort . 
  i love the use of the term `` political correctness '' as if the concept favors one way of life over another . 
  it is n't `` politically correct '' to be gay or straight . 
  it 's politically correct to use terms like `` homosexual '' or `` gay '' as opposed to `` fudge packer '' or `` faggot . '', 
  also , i would love to see some of these `` vicious '' attacks that were leveled against someone for expressing pride in being straight . 
  i suspect puzzlement to have been the more likely response . 
  yes , and it 's a product of the same `` free market '' they claim should reign supreme in every other circumstance . 
  if the free market chooses a more inclusive path , then it 's somehow not a market force at work but rather `` liberals . '', 
  so are you saying it 's a little bit like [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rj7rxyzh.jpg ) ? 
  oh , good lord . 
  what would a world full of 7,000,000,000 people do without a month dedicated to `` awareness '' about heterosexual sex ? 
    for older folks in the their 30s, 
   well , that 's telling . 
  it really * is * telling , because as a frail , clueless person in his 40s with one foot in the grave , i remember my own youthful bewilderment at people who exercised caution and healthy skepticism before embracing idealistic stuff . 
  there seems to be an undercurrent to this whole bitcoin thing that reminds me of kids going `` come * on , * man , the problems are n't really problems . '', 
  the * problem , * as i see it , is that as we get older we realize that some of the stuff we already have is the best possible compromise among competing ideals .
