  our system allows for a person to present a defense . 
  imagine a person getting strung up for killing a guy . 
  murder = bad , so justice is served , right ? 
  well , then we find out that the murderer -- now himself murdered -- had been defending himself at the time against a lethal threat . 
  oops . 
  i guess we can apologize to him in the next life . 
  yes , this example is different , but the point still stands . 
  an elaborate system of justice is n't perfect , but it 's the product of our highest ideals . 
  beating a guy down who a ) did n't actually do anything yet and b ) was n't allowed to present a defense , is an example of what a civilized society rightly does not tolerate . 
   how is he not a pedophile ? 
  is there some age cutoff that i 'm not aware of ? 
  good question . 
  it 's not about age so much as it is physical maturation . 
  a pedophile is a person who is attracted to prepubescent children . 
  not all pedophiles are sex offenders and not all sex offenders are pedophiles . 
  that is , there are people who are attracted to prepubescent children who do not act on their attraction for the same reasons that society does n't tolerate such behavior . 
  by the same token , there are people who for one reason or another find themselves offending against underage children or teens , who are n't necessarily attracted to people that age exclusively . 
  people who are attracted to physically mature people that are not `` fully grown '' ( say , roughly 13-17 ) are called ebophiles . 
  that term is tossed around a lot and is also heavily criticized for being used by `` pedophile apologists . '', 
  but the truth is that a sex offender is n't necessarily an ebophile , pedophile , or any kind of `` phile , '' really . 
  he * may * be , but that ca n't be determined based on a single act . 
  i know this seems counterintuitive , so for an analogy , just imagine the performers in `` lesbian '' porn . 
  many of them are n't lesbians . 
  some of them are , to be sure . 
  some are bisexual . 
  some are straight . 
  i suppose there 's more that could be said about this , but i 'll leave it here for now . 
  i hope you find it helpful in some way . 
  your use of english makes it clear to me that this comment does n't deserve to be taken seriously . 
  what does it mean , exactly , to `` passively '' defend `` pedos '' ? 
  also , i did n't defend anyone in my comments . 
  i condemned the behavior of people like you , who demonstrate a frightening willingness to act as judge , jury , and executioner when it `` feels right '' to do so . 
   my honest opinion , if you passively defend pedophiles , you likely are a pedophile . 
  you could be standing up for animal rights , civil rights , immigrants rights , but you know what will make you take action ? 
  a situation you can identify with . 
  well , then you 've exposed your opinion as complete shit . 
  i am most certainly not a pedophile . 
  also , a tiny bit of effort ( i.e. , looking at my comment history ) would reveal to you that i actually put considerable effort into `` standing up '' for and discussing matters related to civil rights , history , politics , and so on . 
  i 've commented on this topic as well , but it represents a small minority of the things i focus on . 
  did you know that a right to a trial by jury falls under the aegis of `` civil rights '' ? 
  of course you did n't . 
   kill yourself, 
  edit : a word . 
  '' [ never ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/2qe91t/tifu_by_giving_my_2_year_old_daughter_scented/cn5ijcg ) . '', 
  it 's a question of legitimacy . 
  cops are sanctioned by society to perform a role that ordinary citizens are proscribed from performing . 
  the behavior ca n't be considered `` better '' or `` worse '' without context . 
  punching a guy in a boxing ring is different from playing `` knockout , '' though the physical act may very well be the same . 
  yeah , i know . 
  i 'm easy to sucker sometimes . 
  it 's like catching an annoying fly in your hand and then letting it go again just to see if it will continue to be annoying or not . 
  results tend to be predictable . 
   the civil rights movement does n't want condescending people like you being associated with them . 
   i am for civil rights but i do no represent the movement, 
  lol,

  they had lots of evidence , actually . 
  the trial was also televised , so there was a strong case made for many americans who were paying attention to it that o.j. 
  was guilty . 
  the whole thing was very racially charged , though . 
  the lapd had a very bad relationship with the black community to begin with , and the cop who was responsible for gathering evidence ( i believe that was his task ) was shown to have had racist attitudes . 
  the evidence itself * really * made it look bad for o.j. 
  but opinions across the country were divided along racial lines , and the jury was mostly ( if not all , i ca n't remember ) black . 
  so the state 's case was rejected and o.j. 
  was found not guilty . 
  it was a pretty solid case of jury nullification . 
  i 'm growing weary of the amped-up responses on reddit , and particularly the high concentrations of them that occur in this sub . 
  how does a failure to persuade a jury to convict constitute not having ample evidence ? 
  ( `` proof , '' by the way , is not what is presented in court . 
  evidence is . ), 
  if i present a video of someone in the act of committing a crime and the jury returns a not guilty verdict , that does n't mean i `` did n't have proof '' ( or evidence , as it were ) . 
  it means i failed to win a conviction . 
  my use of `` jury nullification '' may not have been completely accurate , because we do n't know what the jurors were really thinking , as far as i know , so we do n't know if they consciously acquitted him while knowing he committed the crime . 
  but the point is that the racial element in the case was strong , and played a huge role in its outcome . 
  i have to wonder if you were old enough to follow the case , or even alive when it was actually taking place . 
  because if you were you would n't consider what i said to be `` asinine . '', 
  and what you said about mark furman does n't contradict what i said . 
  mark furman was shown to have racist attitudes that tainted the persuasiveness of the state 's case . 
  but the case did n't hinge on mark furman alone . 
  look : i 'm not even commenting on what the jury * should * have done or whether the burden of proof was properly met from a legal standpoint . 
  i 'm saying that from the standpoint of the public who watched the case unfold , it seemed pretty clear that o.j. 
  committed the crime . 
  and irrespective of the legal standard , it is solidly established that racial tensions played a role both in the courtroom and among the spectating population outside the courtroom . 
  this is n't a controversial assertion for either side of the case . 
  had a team of some of the country 's highest-profile , superstar lawyers representing him . 
  they used every trick in the book during the case , as one would expect , including raising one frivolous objection after another during the prosecution 's closing arguments . 
  they persuaded the jury to see reasonable doubt where many other observers did n't see any . 
  he was acquitted in the criminal trial and then went on to * lose * the civil suit against him , where he was found liable for the wrongful death of the victims .
