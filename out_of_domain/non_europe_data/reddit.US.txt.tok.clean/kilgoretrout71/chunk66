  well , maybe that 's true , but i fail to see how acknowledging my own ignorance contributes to `` the problem . '', 
  your comment seems to imply that i 'd do just as well * not * acknowledging things i do n't know about , and believing whatever i feel like . 
  i refer to my understanding as a `` silver lining , '' not as proof that i 'm not susceptible to misunderstandings . 
  i have the perspective i have because i lived in a different country and married someone from that country . 
  so i 'm not sure what you 're getting at . 
  sure , i see your point . 
  i did n't mean to nitpick , if that 's how it came off . 
  this is great . 
  thank you . 
  they 'd already beaten us with sputnik anyway . 
  was it from / u/apoplastic ? 
  i got one from that user indicating 328 . 
  i believe the switcharoo mods make efforts to fix breaks like that . 
  no , they 're a different color entirely . 
  if the powers that be had had women in mind when they designed the system , we would n't be having this conversation . 
  my wife 's 50 . 
  a few years ago she did that thing where you take the pill straight through the cycle and do n't even * get * a period . 
  her gyno then asked her to stop `` just to see if it 's still happening . '', 
  it was . 
  now she 's back on a regular cycle . 
  she must 've missed it . 
  point is , that option exists . 
  maybe that 's not news to you , but it was to me . 
  ah , one of those rare * actual * lols . 
  oh , the horror . 
  i swear to god , there is something out there for every damn situation . 
  i made a post once about the time i put a loaf of bread in a fish tank and killed all the fish ( i was about 3 when i did it ) . 
  someone replied with a youtube link to a song called something like `` fish bread '' that showed a bunch of fish swimming while embedded in loaves of bread . 
  i was like , * really ? 
  that 's the one !, 
  i believe your understanding of things is correct , but insults , however tempting it is to use them , do n't encourage people to rethink their positions on things . 
  i 've learned a lot from being told with respect that i am wrong . 
  when a group or movement critical of existing institutions , powerful individuals , etc. 
  is attacked overtly or covertly by the entities they are criticizing , it becomes vulnerable to influence and support from outside interests with potentially more threatening goals in mind . 
  i remember hearing talk about mlk 's possible ties to communist organizations ( really do n't know how much of that was substantiated ; never followed up on it ) and how some people used this alleged connection to discredit him and his message . 
  but then i remembered that mlk was n't preaching communism . 
  people who are offended by the message of a dissident will be inclined to see such ties as nefarious or indicative of ulterior motives . 
  people who support the message will see such ties as the inevitable result of being marginalized by more `` respectable '' entities that are part of the establishment being criticized . 
  i 'm not saying that the so-called darling organizations on the left have never been involved in wrongdoing ( neither the left nor the right speaks with a single voice ) . 
  but it should n't be surprising to anyone when a group that challenges the established authority for legitimate reasons becomes associated in some way with another group that is challenging that authority for less honorable ones . 
  interesting replies here . 
  some of them hinted at what i would have said , but none that i saw went straight to the point of what i think is going on here . 
  `` so '' is a little complicated because it can be used as an adverb , conjunction , adjective , pronoun , or interjection . 
  my sense of things suggests that even as an interjection , `` so '' draws upon its functionality as a conjunction . 
  as a conjunction , `` so '' is a link that creates continuity . 
  * he has n't finished his work , so he wo n't be going out tonight * and * the electricity will be shut off today , so what are we going to do about it ? 
  * are examples . 
  as an interjection , `` so '' usually comes at the beginning of something that could easily stand on its own . 
  * so , how are you , then ? 
  * and * so look who 's here !, 
  * are examples . 
  if you consider the usage in the latter case , you can see that it hints at a sort of `` continuity '' in a social rather than grammatical sense . 
  it 's as if the speaker were incorporating a standalone event into an ongoing narrative . 
  so ( see ? 
  ) , i see the usage you 're referring to as a way to break the ice with an uninitiated audience . 
  ** by putting `` so '' at the beginning of a title where the title could easily stand alone , the writer is creating a subtle sense among readers that a conversation ( human conversation ? 
  western conversation ? 
  american conversation ? ), 
  was already in progress . 
  ** it says `` we 're all in this conversation together and here 's my part of it . '', 
  can you make mushum from peachicks ? 
  ah , the ol' reddit [ bing-a-roo ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/2teppt/parents_of_ugly_children_when_did_you_finally/cnz9b5d?context=3 ) . 
  interesting . 
  i 've been using reddit is fun almost exclusively on my phone and tablet and i usually prefer it to either a browser or another app . 
  i 've never used another app for long , but maybe that 's due to habit . 
  that 's what i use and i 'm pretty happy with it . 
  email the dev !, 
  he 's super responsive . 
  he even implemented a change i suggested in one of his updates . 
  i hear people trashing it all the time and i do n't quite understand the hate . 
  i definitely agree with getting rid of adviceanimals , but i left / r/funny alone . 
  i only look at what 's on the first page or two on my front page for that sub ( meaning i only see the top 3-5 posts in the sub ) and , sure , it can be hit or miss , but i 'm just not bothered by it . 
  i honestly think it should be askmen and askwomen . 
  forget the `` rights '' angle . 
  so , you mean , they could n't identify louis c.k. 
  in a lineup , for example ? 
  i do n't know whether your claim that finkelstein is `` the poster boy '' for right-wing muslims is true or not , but if it were , would it make finkelstein 's claims wrong or disingenuous ? 
  if you go against something , you 're going to invite support from everyone who is against it as well , even if you 're against them too . 
  i never imagined beards to be a thing from the 50s . 
  not saying you 're wrong absolutely , but it does n't strike me as accurate . 
  the beard trend of late seems to me like something out of the 1890s . 
  ah , that makes sense . 
  my parents were born in the 40s . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://www.scvtv.com/gif/mugs/mug_jamesdean.jpg ) an iconic figure from the time . 
  a different take on the shotgun wedding , to be sure . 
  i know you were just giving an example , but since you gave the one you did i would suggest migrating to a community where your opinions * are * appreciated . 
  given your anxiety , you may not be ready to start dropping contrarian opinions around where some sort of backlash is inevitable . 
  in time you 'll develop the skills to confidently stand by your opinion in less friendly environments . 
  two things stand out for me when i read your remarks :, 
  1 ) learn friendly confidence . 
  by that i mean , try to adopt an attitude of friendly acceptance of both praise and criticism . 
  a friendly demeanor is something only assholes will dismiss . 
  someone gives you shit for preferring a console to a pc ? 
  ( frankly one of the dumbest things in the world for people to fight about in * this * guy 's opinion . ), 
  just say * yeah , maybe you 're right . 
  it 's just not that important to me . 
  i prefer a console , but that 's me . 
  you prefer a pc and maybe a pc really is better . 
  i still like my console . 
  * it does n't have to be about winning an argument or being `` better . '',
