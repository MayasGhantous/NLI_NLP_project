  * lock 'em up , * so they 'll come out worse than when they went in . 
  * make 'em hurt , * so their children will hurt too . 
  in my state one of the potential consequences for failing to pay child support is having your driver 's license suspended . 
  because -- you know -- nothing will make a guy get a job like taking away his means of attending interviews and getting to work . 
  people seem to forget that when people do stupid shit -- and we all do , at one time or another -- it is n't always out of reckless disregard for others , or part of a destructive pattern . 
  consequences are fine , as long as they fit the circumstances and do n't do more harm than good . 
  i 'm willing to bet that the driver in this clip will not do this sort of thing again . 
  a mark on his/her record that would serve as a flag in the screening process for school bus drivers or other passenger-carrying enterprises would seem appropriate . 
  hmm . 
  if municipal providers ca n't compete , then there 's no reason to oppose them , right ? 
  money in politics is the problem everyone recognizes , but i think we have a problem with the way party politics works here as well , even in the absence of the money issue . 
  parties are n't mentioned in the constitution , and so dominant factions have rigged the system to create high barriers to entry for other parties . 
  we need a system that does n't force people to bundle their preferences with the lesser of two evils . 
  in germany , for example ( last i knew ) , if your party gets 5 % of the vote , you get seats . 
  the binary system we have now is tiresome . 
  just watch people scramble to take sides when an issue transcends the current division . 
  * i want less government in my life . 
  but he 's a traitor to his country . 
  at least according to obam -- wait , let 's start again . 
  that 's why calling this stuff out is more entertaining than it is productive . 
  one of the greatest takedowns of fox news by jon stewart was a recent one , where talking heads at fox were shown at length expressing indignation over the lack of `` apologies from the left '' for jumping to conclusions about the shooting in ferguson , followed by the * really * damning observation that after two years of beating the benghazi drum , fox had nothing to say about the bipartisan report concluding that there was no misconduct , * even when they had one of its authors in the studio . 
  it was great television , but how many minds did it change ? 
  the only thing that seems to change minds is the passage of time ( i.e. , new generations ) and events and issues that do n't fit into one single worldview ( as in the case of edward snowden ) . 
  this does not account for 24 hours of slacking . 
  yeah , i saw it , but my point here was that his case is an example of something that does n't fit neatly into the binary political division in the u.s. should a republican praise his disclosure of government overreach , or condemn his disrespect for authority , for example ? 
  this difficulty with pidgeonholing exists independent of the public 's ignorance . 
  and that 's the other thing too , of course : oliver spoke to people on the street , who are going to reflect the public 's overall apathy . 
  politically engaged people would have responded quite differently . 
  never met a messy barber . 
  reasoning checks out . 
  glassdoor seems to be a great all-around resource in this way . 
  i believe it 's compiled from user-submitted data ( or at least partially so ) , and it includes information about every job imaginable , including employer-specific information . 
  yes , minors are precious vessels of sunshine if anyone over 18 has sex with them , but are saddled with a level of culpability that could cost them their life if they do something shitty . 
  complicity means absolutely nothing in the former case , but means everything in the latter . 
  the truth is that we 're just full of shit in this country . 
  we love * punishing * people , and we 'll torture logic to absurd extremes in our effort to justify doing it . 
  this shit would all go away if we could eradicate the sadistic pleasure we take in the suffering of others . 
  edit : `` well , i 'll just downvote this and move on . 
  i have nothing to offer in the way of a rebuttal , but i do n't like these words i 'm looking at , so that 's that . '', 
  i 'd be happy to engage in a debate on this topic , and i 'll even admit i 'm wrong if i 'm wrong . 
  am i wrong ? 
  there 's merit to this idea , but whatever deficiency exits in a minor 's ability to grasp the seriousness of larceny , will also exist in the cases of rape and murder . 
  it 's not that they wo n't understand that these things are * wrong . 
  * i think most six-year-olds understand that larceny is wrong too . 
  or arson , or dealing drugs , or whatever . 
  it 's that they do n't have the perspective to wrap their heads around the implications , or to exercise meaningful empathy . 
  are you saying the cop was in fear of being smothered ? 
  that would be a novel take on things . 
  hmm , i dunno if this qualifies . 
  i can see the bridge perfectly fine . 
  i was trying to figure out what was going on here and the information quoted in comments did n't paint a clear picture , so i looked at the statute . 
  the statute also does n't seem to paint a clear picture at first , because subsection c seems to contradict itself . 
  it says :, 
   no other flag or pennant should be placed above ** or , if on the same level , to the right ** of the flag of the united states of america , except . 
  and then it says, 
   no person shall display the flag of the united nations or any other national or international flag ** equal , above , or in a position of superior prominence or honor to ** , or in place of , the flag of the united states . 
  now , one can choose to believe that people who make a living writing laws would codify a direct contradiction inside a single , small subsection of law , or one can reason that while there appears to be a contradiction , there really is n't one . 
  if we give lawmakers the benefit of the doubt ( and i think it 's fair to do so in this case , especially since we 're appealing to the text to begin with ) , it would seem that the first portion quoted above establishes that the term `` equal , '' which follows thereafter , does not mean `` equal height in all circumstances , '' because when the u.s. flag is flown at equal height to the flag of another country ** and ** it 's flown to the right of it , it is not `` equal . '', 
  `` equal '' here appears to mean * equal in any way other than at equal height and rightmost , * because the first part of the subsection specifically says that the position to the right at equal height is not `` equal . '', 
  if the u.s. flag were never to be flown at equal height to the flag of another country , ** the identification of the rightmost position at equal heights as more prominent would be superfluous ** . 
  i hope this helps . 
  if you take another look at what i wrote , you 'll see that i was quoting only from subsection c . it is n't necessary to consider g in this instance . 
  as for the system of triage you quoted , take another look at that too . 
  it only becomes necessary to give more weight to later language than earlier language when an effort to `` interpret the provisions so both can be given effect '' is `` futile . '', 
  here , it is n't . 
  the language in the second sentence says `` equal to , above , or in a position of superior prominence , '' not `` at an equal height . '', 
  `` equal to '' can encompass height when height is what the assessment hinges on ( such as what is described in subsections e and f ) . 
  but the first sentence in subsection c already delineates a circumstance where the u.s. flag and the flag of another nation can be displayed at an equal height in a manner that is n't `` equal , '' namely , when the former is on the right . 
  when the american flag is displayed at an equal height to the flag of another nation , and it is to its own right of that flag , the display is not `` equal . '', 
  because this understanding allows both provisions to be `` given effect , '' there is no need to parse the statute further . 
  i think you 're confusing party with ideology . 
  your comment compares `` democrats '' to `` conservatives . '', 
  the democrats in the south who supported racist policies were n't `` liberal democrats . '', 
  they were `` southern democrats , '' who were , by and large , conservative . 
  not that republicans were liberals at the time . 
  it 's just that party and ideology were n't as tightly linked as they are today . 
  nixon was a rather liberal republican in many ways . 
  wallace was a conservative democrat . 
  world events , regional politics , and other factors blurred the lines somewhat . 
  today things are much more tightly linked and that plays a role in our polarization . 
  it 's changing in interesting ways , though . 
  this is what she said :, 
   here 's an answer . 
  i support letting women and their doctors make this decision without government getting involved . 
  period . 
  end of story . 
  now your turn , senator paul . 
  we know you want to allow government officials like yourself to make this decision for women -- -- but do you stand by your opposition to any exceptions , even when it comes to rape , incest , or life of the mother ? 
  or do we just have different definitions of ` personal liberty ' ? 
  and i 'd appreciate it if you could respond without ` shushing ' me . 
  ancestry.com does this , and as their techniques and data improve , your results update dynamically . 
  my wife is < 1 % persian !, 
  yay !, 
  i 'm really impressed with their results . 
  i was matched with a lot of people i never knew about . 
  i like the way that no matter how long ago you did your test , your results update as the technology and data improve . 
  i did mine years ago , and although my initial profile was very close to what it is today , several refinements have been made to it since then , adding more details and finer divisions among ethnicities . 
  i think it 's awesome . 
  wait , what ? 
  they have different money .
