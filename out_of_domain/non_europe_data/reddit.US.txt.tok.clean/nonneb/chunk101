  that 's totally normal and fine . 
  the same thing should apply to english , too ( except for the \u00df bit , i suppose . 
  that should be easy enough ) . 
  when i 'm speaking german , i pronounce bach as bach . 
  when i 'm speaking english , i put a / k / on the end . 
  different languages , different sounds . 
  why is it always germans complaining about how german words or names are pronounced in foreign languages ? 
  when was the last time anyone heard a mexican at chipotle like `` actually , it 's burrito '' ? 
  that 's still going to depend on who you ask . 
  a lot of countries call their standard language `` castellano '' . 
  i 'd say i 'm pretty efficient in terms of effort and total number of hours put into a language , but i 'm not the best person to ask in terms of learning a language intensively over a short amount of time . 
  i 've never tried it , but i assume this would work about as well . 
  read about it on wikipedia . 
  figure out what to look for as you 're learning . 
  go through a good textbook with lots of audio or something comparable . 
  usually the best textbooks are language specific , but assimil is a safe choice most of the time . 
  michel thomas and pimsleur are too short to replace a textbook , but they can be nice additions . 
  if you can get a grip on the grammar without too much hand-holding ( no shame in needing hand-holding , though ) , glossika is a great choice as well . 
  glossika is also a great post-textbook material . 
  read and listen . 
  audiobooks are the most effective for the amount of time spent in my experience , but tv series are easier to binge sometimes . 
  during steps two and three , mimic things you hear . 
  i do n't generally do it systematically ( although shadowing a book can be very useful , i 'm just lazy ) , but when i hear something i did n't know , ca n't pronounce , or think will be especially useful , i say it out loud . 
  start speaking whenever you feel like it . 
  it will take a couple of weeks to a month to activate what you know . 
  i know this is controversial , but i 've tried it myself and it worked for me , at least . 
  i studied chinese for about three or four years before going to china . 
  i never spoke to anyone , except a couple of times in restaurants on vacation where i did n't speak the local language . 
  i focused most of my energy on listening , but i kept my reading abilities up as well . 
  i knew about 2500 characters when i got to china , with appropriate reading ability , but most importantly i could generally understand what people were saying . 
  it was n't so hard to get the passive vocabulary into the active pool after not remembering it or stumbling around it in conversation a few times . 
  this is tailored to me , and other things work for other people . 
  i do n't like talking as a beginner . 
  i do n't talk a particularly large amount in my native language , much less a language i know 500 words of . 
  on the other hand , i enjoy studying , reading , and watching tv . 
  beginning to speak is a much more pleasant experience as an intermediate listener , and i do n't feel like postponing it slows me down at all in the long run . 
  christoph kolumbus ? 
   finna is just aave again , means try to/want to . 
  ca n't it also mean `` about to '' , as in `` i 'm about to go to the grocery store '' ? 
  i always thought `` finna '' was a little further in the future than just `` ima '' . 
  i could be confusing it with `` fixin ' to '' , but i always understood it that way and have never noticed it not making sense . 
   do taiwanese and chinese people have the same kind of technological shift that we do , where handwriting is not nearly as important/common ? 
  i 'd say even more so , outside of school , at least . 
  you need to be able to write your name , address , and other important stuff like that . 
  a lot of restaurants have a card where you write down your order as well . 
  so you need to be able to write legibly , so stroke order and all that , but you only need to be able to write a few characters from memory . 
  regarding number 5 , i think you 're having trouble because you 're reading \u70ba\u4ec0\u9ebc as why . 
  try dividing it up into \u70ba and \u4ec0\u9ebc \u3002 \u70ba goes with \u82e6\u60f1 and indicates the thing you 're worrying about . 
  not really . 
  you know how \u5c0d and \u6709\u8208\u8da3 go together ? 
  that 's what 's happening here , but it 's \u70ba and \u82e6\u60f1 \u3002 i would translate the sentence as `` what do you worry about often ? '', 
  or something like that . 
  you know you might need a \u70ba in the sentence , and thus that \u70ba\u4ec0\u9ebc might not be why , because you have a word ( \u82e6\u60f1 ) that often goes with \u70ba . 
  i was in t4 - , so i never saw any of the internet menus , and i 'm only familiar with checklists from upscale hotpot restaurants . 
  i 'm sure it differs by region and individual restaurant , but op should at least be aware that they might have to do it from time to time . 
  if your comprehension is that low , reading it with a translation alongside is probably the best course of action . 
  most of the benefits of using a dictionary for a fraction of the time and effort . 
  you can use two physical books ( book stands help with this ) , a parallel text , you can read it in your l1 first , you can make your own parallel text on the computer , or you can use [ this great app ] ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.book2.book2&amp;hl=en ) that turns your epubs into a parallel text for you . 
  the first time through i would n't write anything down . 
  if you want to go back through and write down the words that come up frequently that you 're still not sure about , that can help . 
  100 % comprehension of most any book wo n't happen until you 're well advanced enough to know how you like to read , so do n't try to learn every word in the book . 
  not for now , at least . 
  i do n't remember if they use this in mexico or not , but one of my favorite anglicisms in honduras was `` yonke '' , where you can go and buy old car parts . 
  no , i think it just pulls the text out , so anything with too many images or unusual formatting probably wo n't work . 
  i know plato uses the word \u03bd\u1fc6\u03c3\u03bf\u03c2 . 
  i do n't * think * he used the word \u1f24\u03c0\u03b5\u03b9\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 to describe it , but i could be wrong . 
  i 'd have to read through it again . 
  sorry i ca n't really respond in greek . 
  i studied classics at uni , but i never learned to write or speak . 
   okay no language is inherently simpler than another, 
  you do n't have to be so careful . 
  there are at the very least [ some fringe cases ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/language_complexity#a_comparison ) which show that some languages can be more complex than others . 
  i tried it out on my phone in china and it seemed to work pretty well . 
  homophones are n't that much of an issue , really . 
  most words have two syllables , so it 's not as bad as it would seem looking at the number of characters that are homophones . 
  it generally does n't have a problem detecting tones if you have a standard accent . 
  there was a viral video of a guy trying to speak a number to dial in his car , but he had a thick accent and the car could n't understand him . 
  ibus is n't an ime in and of itself . 
  are you using mozc ? 
  that 's just a modern greek sentence that means `` was n't it a continent ? '', 
  edit because i realized i did n't answer your question : \u1f08\u03c4\u03bb\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u1f76\u03c2 \u03bd\u1fc6\u03c3\u03bf\u03c2 is how plato referred to atlantis . 
  if you want to talk about the place the way plato did , i would go with \u1f08\u03c4\u03bb\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u1f76\u03c2 \u03bd\u1fc6\u03c3\u03bf\u03c2 . 
  i have no idea about the disappearance stuff , sorry . 
  i do n't know what broke college me would have done without uztranslations , their predecessor . 
  there 's a lot of stuff on there that 's hard to find anywhere else , even if you 're willing and want to pay . 
  interesting . 
  i remember seeing something about moving to language.ws on the uztranslations site , otherwise i would n't have known about it . 
  it seems lingvist.info and language.ws are both at least modeled after uztranslations , though . 
  no , it was just a place to share and find material . 
  people there did do useful things like digitize and ocr physical textbooks and stuff , though . 
  the mongolian script is all over the place in inner mongolia , which has more mongolians than mongolia . 
  even in big cities like hohhot , the signs and announcements are all bilingual using the traditional script . 
  your comment is basically correct with the big classifier `` in mongolia . '', 
  if there is a large group of germans anywhere these days , they generally try to stay as far away from each other as possible . 
  it 's not like most groups where they 'll open a restaurant ( probably would be a bakery for germans ) at a certain threshold . 
  there are some older groups that were n't so shy about maintaining a community , but they generally do n't speak the same standard german as in germany . 
  texas german is probably the closest , but the community of speakers is nearly gone . 
  there 's also pennsilfaanisch , but 1 . it 's kind of hard to understand and 2 . there 's not too many speakers of it left either . 
  that 's for the us . 
  south america has some wwii era arrivals that still speak german .
