  i know i 'll be included when they 're comfortable and want to include me . 
  i helped a group of radical feminists do a workshop for men in the local communist youth group . 
  it 's not like feminists hate men , even the so-called man-hating feminists . 
  they do outreach sometimes . 
  they 're just very sensitive to the power dynamics involved in dealing with men , which some men take personally . 
  to address your question directly , i tend to avoid saying things like `` i 'm a feminist '' to feminists , not because i 'm not , but because i do n't want them to think that i 'm claiming an equal say and stake in their struggle . 
  i usually just say i 'm involved with x , y , and z groups and it never causes any friction . 
  i know that i , as an individual and a man , suffer from things like traditional gender roles , but ultimately i still get taken more seriously than women and benefit from being a man , even if i 'd rather not . 
  i 've seen the feminists i work with have to put up with so much shit from men trying to help that i 'm pretty much on board with whatever exclusionary measures they choose to take at this point . 
  in the same way , it 's really important for men to have groups that tackle gendered problems from our perspective informed by feminist theory , but there 's a shortage of that at the moment . 
  the closest i come to being around a bunch of men dealing with gendered problems is in communist groups . 
  putin speaks german sometimes when he visits germany or austria . 
  he 's even addressed the german parliament in german before . 
  ah , i completely misunderstood what you meant . 
  that makes a lot more sense now . 
  i thought you meant your society as a whole was feminist . 
   the nuance and the real issues tend to be ignored for cheap soundbites . 
  who is doing that ? 
  the feminists or the politicians ? 
  if all you hear from feminists is the soundbites on tv or high school bloggers on the internet , of course you 're going to think they present the issues without any nuance . 
  there is plenty of academic work behind feminism , as well , if you go looking for it . 
   but they are getting out shouted by the vocal minority of anti-sex , anti-men and anti-white people who are out there . 
  yes , there are feminists who reject the sex-positive rhetoric , including me and most of my irl feminist friends . 
  i do n't personally know any feminists i 'd describe as anti-men or anti-white . 
  wary of men and white people , sure , but not harboring any ill will . 
  as i was writing this , i thought `` this sounds like someone who gets their idea of feminism from tumblrinaction '' . 
  yep . 
  sorry for wasting your , my , and everyone 's time . 
  what does this have to do with learning chinese ? 
  are you just running out of china related subs you have n't been banned from for spamming ? 
  ( or was that the socialist subs ? 
  i do n't remember but i recognize your user name ), 
  yes , fox news is astoundingly racist . 
  water is wet . 
  does n't make this post any more relevant . 
   fox news is not racist ,, 
  i 'll trust your opinion , internet stranger . 
   stop being so sensitive, 
  i 'm sensitive about postnationalism spamming irrelevant shit in half the subs i subscribe to . 
  i do n't live in the us and do n't have a tv anyways , so i could n't give half a shit about fox news 's antics , which is why postnationalism 's spam bothers me . 
   you make judgment calls on people based on genitalia and skin pigmentation . 
  i try not to , but it 's difficult to break subconscious prejudices i picked up from my community as a child . 
  if you 're talking about white men , though , i 'm a man and have n't had many experiences that would make me personally wary of men . 
  i think you 're assuming a lot about me to think that i have anything against men . 
  however , i 've seen and listened to the experiences of my friends and respect that they have reasons for wanting places where they can discuss things without men . 
   now while that might not be true that idea is spreading among the fence sitters and if you losse them then you will losse every thing . 
  people have been saying that since feminism became a thing . 
  pandering to people who think that way has n't proven effective . 
  feminism might as well be dead in germany too , compared to other places i 've lived like spain , mexico , and the us . 
  it 's an ineffective , watered-down movement that gains nothing through its moderation . 
  there are a multitude of reasons why feminism is more widely-supported and effective in some places than others , and there is little to no correlation with how extreme or moderate it is . 
   so you are making assumption about me, 
  you go on a board that is largely about making fun of shitty things feminists do , then come onto pro-feminist board and complain about feminists . 
  it seems like bad faith to purposely seek out examples of feminism behaving badly and then complain about feminism as a whole . 
  my hunch is that you 're not aspirating the t in tea , which over a shitty speaker might sound like there 's no `` t '' at all . 
  none of the recent courses should need ocring . 
  only the oldest courses did n't have selectable text . 
  [ glossika ] ( https://glossika.com/courses/fluency123/taiwanese ) is definitely the most comprehensive course for taiwanese at the moment , and it 's 40 % off right now . 
  mdbg.net has stroke order gifs . 
  i think that 's what you 're asking for . 
   for example i have a word b\u0101 , i need a website that 'll show me the character for it and how to write it . 
  that 's tricky . 
  if you type in b\u0101 , you would get \u516b \uff0c \u5427 \uff0c \u5df4 \uff0c \u53ed \uff0c \u6252 \uff0c and more . 
  oftentimes if you know what it 's supposed to mean , you can pick out the character , but sometimes there are characters with similar enough meanings when translated to english ( like \u4f5c and \u505a ) , so i hope you 're learning the characters in class with the pinyin . 
  the vowels are hardly the same at all . 
  compare :, 
  english ( something like general american ) -, 
  / \u00e6 / as in bath , trap , yak ban , tram , yeah, 
  / \u0251\u02d0 / as in ah , father , spa boss , dog , off, 
  / \u0254\u02d0 / as in all , bought , flaunt, 
  / \u025b / as in dress , met , bread, 
  / \u0259 / as in about , syrup , arena, 
  / \u026a / as in kit , pink , tip, 
  / i\u02d0 / as in beam , chic , fleece, 
  / i / as in happy , money , parties, 
  / \u0268 / as in private , muffin , wasted, 
  / \u028c / as in bus , flood , what, 
  / \u028a / as in book , put , should, 
  / u\u02d0 / as in goose , new , true, 
  spanish :, 
  / a / as la, 
  / e / as in fresa, 
  / i / as in piso, 
  / o / as in oreja, 
  / u / as in luz, 
  [ \u025b ] also exists as an complementary allophone of / e /, 
  english and spanish have three distinct vowel sounds in common , out of english 's ~ 12 : / u / , / i / , and / \u025b /, 
  you might like [ \u7a0b\u74a7 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjqzfgxfiyi&amp;index=19&amp;list=plqzl52zjocvjbdpvx46cgpirsatl_tops ) . 
  [ astro bunny ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnanuuksya ) is really good as well . 
  my greek grades improved drastically when i stopped doing everything with paper and keeping a vocab list like my teacher said and started reading my homework over and over again . 
  first on perseus , then without , and if i had to look something up i started over . 
  i did n't parse every word on paper , but i paid attention to the forms . 
  i 'm tempted to say teachers , and classicists , but especially classics teachers are slow to change . 
  maybe it actually is worse for other people to use perseus , but it seems silly to me to waste time in a paper dictionary , and the results seemed to verify that , in my case . 
  trying to explain why idioms are the way they are is something i 'll leave to others , but it might help you to know that \u8173\u5370 is footprint . 
  i 've only heard of people taking the computerized tests in china and the us . 
  they 're not available in most of europe , for instance . 
  change the topic to something you agree on . 
  in my experience , gun control is a safe bet ( assuming you 're an american , here ) . 
  talk up the things you have in common , how you 're tired of elites running the country , etc.
