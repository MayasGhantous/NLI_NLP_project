  i can still go in there and get what i want for less than four euros . 
  some of the falafel options are only two euros ( $ 1.80 is the cheapest , iirc ) . 
  that 's only one example , but it seems to be successful . 
  attract yuppies by how you market it , still sell d\u00f6ner for prices that do n't drive away customers who know they can walk fifty meters to a different store . 
  you do n't have to actually acquire or speak the language to be able to read . 
  knowledge is enough most of the time : words , grammar , idioms . 
  but listening and speaking is something that humans are equipped to do naturally , often subconsciously . 
  with enough knowledge , you can kind of make yourself understood in speech ( see most high school spanish students in the us who can put together sentences but ca n't understand anything spoken at native speed ) . 
  but there 's no shortcut for listening , no way to fake it , and no amount of book study or memorizing that 'll make you understand . 
  the only way to do it is to practice listening until you get better . 
  first , make sure you can hear and distinguish the different phonemes of the language . 
  if you ca n't hear the difference between ship and sheep , you 're gon na have a bad time . 
  babies learn to do this automatically . 
  you 're not a child , so you have to practice . 
  after that , it 's just a matter of listening a ton . 
  here 's a useful activity i find helpful . 
  you might find it a little more time-effective than watching tv or things like that :, 
  listen to the text before reading it . 
  at lower levels or more difficult texts , maybe only a sentence at a time , but i 've also done it for up to chapter-size chunks . 
  read the text ( or excerpt ) , preferably while listening to it . 
  listen again without looking at the text . 
  then repeat steps two and three until you 're satisfied with how much you understand . 
  picking the right text is an important part of this . 
  ideally it 'd be something you could understand on paper but ca n't understand when you hear it , but learning a little extra vocab is n't a bad thing either . 
  d\u00f6ner , waffle house , and l\u00e1ngos are the holy trinity of after-getting-fucked-up-all-night food . 
   but is n't that problem a lack of multilingualism rather than too much ? 
  people are complaining that those people ca n't speak english and want them to learn a second language . 
   no one wants immigrants to forget their native language , they want them to learn the local language . 
  they want them to go from being monolingual to bilingual . 
  it certainly applied to german and irish immigrants in the us , though it 's hard to say if that would still be the case today . 
  they 're referring to the various combinations of tense , mood , and aspect which are commonly referred to as `` tenses '' by laypeople and those who work with esl . 
  one linguist , i think mcwhorter , but definitely a more well-known pop linguist , has argued that the progressive form and do support both come from contact with the celtic languages . 
  there 's not a definitive , widely-accepted answer to your question , though . 
   even further away from english than asian languages . 
  eh , they 're genetically unrelated to english , just like chinese , korean , etc. 
  they 're not * more * unrelated . 
  i 'm not sure about estonian , but hungarian is a part of the standard average european sprachbund , so it does in fact share more with other european language than chinese . 
  it 's just not due to a genetic relationship . 
  you can use youtube-dl or a site like clipconverter to download them . 
  i get most of my audiobooks from youtube , and i just tell youtube-dl to download the playlist and then i can put it on my phone just like any audio book . 
  it 's not just about modesty or sexuality . 
  males are more likely to commit sexual violence , which is one of the reasons why we have segregated bathrooms in the first place . 
  [ transwomen have the same rate of crime , including violent crime , as men , which is much higher than natal women . 
  ] ( http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0016885 ), 
  women may be uncomfortable around males for a number of reasons , crime one of them . 
  we have to either rethink having segregated spaces at all , or recognize that transwomen are no less ( or more ) threatening to women than other natal males and respect women 's spaces . 
  the relevant quotes from the linked article , if you want to ctrl + f : second , regarding any crime , male-to-females had a significantly increased risk for crime compared to female controls ( ahr 6.6 ; 95 % ci 4.1 -- 10.8 ) but not compared to males ( ahr 0.8 ; 95 % ci 0.5 -- 1.2 ) . 
  in this study , male-to-female individuals had a higher risk for criminal convictions compared to female controls but not compared to male controls . 
  this suggests that the sex reassignment procedure neither increased nor decreased the risk for criminal offending in male-to-females . 
   what makes you think that they would n't also be willing to break a hypothetical law that prevents them from being in a specific bathroom ? 
  i think the issue is more whether or not other people feel comfortable calling men out for being in a women 's restrooms . 
  the law itself is not a deterrent ; the assertion that women ( and bouncers/security/everyone else ) have a right to pre\u00ebmptively keep men out of women 's restrooms is the key part . 
  no , i look up unusual words and tell my students we ( native speakers ) have to look up how to spell stuff all the time . 
  i do n't do it that often , but i 'm completely shameless about it when i have doubts . 
  sounds to me like [ readlang ] ( http://readlang.com/ ) or [ lingq ] ( https://www.lingq.com/ ) . 
  for harry potter i 'd recommend just reading it ( and listening ) and not worrying about anki . 
  harry potter uses pretty repetitive vocab for the most part , especially if you read the whole series , which i 'd recommend . 
  putting new words you encounter in anki is a much more effective strategy for shorter texts like spiegel articles . 
  i hear pinyin < en  as / \u0259n / most of the time as well . 
  it may vary by dialect , but / \u0259n / is definitely more common . 
  if you hear it as rhyming with the english word when , you probably live in a place with a somewhat non-standard dialect . 
  op , check out the forvo entry for [ \u6587 ] ( http://forvo.com/search/%e6%96%87/zh/ ) . 
  it sounds much more like / w\u0259n / than the one you linked . 
  same thing here with [ \u9580 ] ( http://forvo.com/word/%e9%96%80/#zh ) . 
   you simply wo n't be able to make enough anki cards , study and review them due to the amount of vocab that a novel throws at you . 
  i agree completely , * but * if you 're a masochist or advanced enough that it will be manageable , readlang will automatically make flash cards ( including many kinds , like cloze deletion ) out of the words you clicked on to get the hovering translation . 
  they export well to anki , and you can read anything you have in epub format . 
  i used to use lwt . 
  it has a lot of features that are more useful than readlang , but i ultimately switched to readlang because it was faster to just click the word and it did n't interrupt the flow of reading too much . 
  lwt seems to work best with more intensive reading , which i generally do n't do as much of as extensive reading . 
  in mexico , everybody thought i had a german accent , and that was before i had started learning german . 
  in spain , it was either german or latin american . 
  i even met a few d\u00f6ner guys who had lived in germany because they switched to german when i ordered in spanish . 
  in german , people usually ca n't place my accent . 
  the default seems to be assuming i 'm arab , but i think that 's more about my appearance than the accent . 
  in china , there is only one foreign accent : the laowai accent . 
  in portugal , people assumed i was spaniard . 
   if your vocab is limited , i 'm guessing you have n't spent much time listening to chinese being spoken . 
  you can listen to chinese all day every day and not learn a thing if your level is so low that you ca n't get the gist of it . 
  subtitles are a crutch , but watching some chinese movies with subs in your non-study time is better than not listening to chinese at all . 
  some cctv channels always have bilingual subs . 
  i forgot which ones , but check around and i 'm sure you 'll find it . 
  if you 're willing to watch things offline , it 's really easy to use aegisub to combine a chinese srt ( subtitle file ) and an english srt , then open the video and sub with vlc . 
  voil\u00e1 , bilingual subs for most any major movie . 
  try changing your fonts and locale in vlc and windows if the chinese is n't displaying . 
   did n't know vlc could display multiple subs at once . 
  it ca n't , that 's why you have to combine them in aegisub . 
  no , but being rich [ does tend to make you an ass ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jul/08/the-age-of-entitlement-how-wealth-breeds-narcissism ) . 
  how so ? 
  i always thought lojban was fairly straightforward . 
  the crux of op 's problem is that sometimes \u3123 sounds like / \u0259n / and sometimes it sounds like [ \u025bn ] . 
  no matter how you divide it , op 's still looking to find out why it sometimes sounds one way and sometimes another . 
  they 're asking about vowel quality , not tone . 
  some possible explanations would be that it depends on the initial and/or tone ( or they 're some other type of allophones ) , they 're regional variations , or it depends on register . 
  all of those explain why one phoneme sounds different ways . 
  i 'm sure there could also be other explanations , but you seem to be addressing an issue that op 's not talking about , namely what finals are . 
  it says \u5b6b\u5b50\u5175\u6cd5 , which means sun tzu 's art of war . 
  the picture is upside down , by the way . 
  yes , it 's literally master sun 's ( \u5b6b\u5b50 , s\u016bnz\u012d ) military tactics ( \u5175\u6cd5 , b\u012bngf\u0103 ) . 
  that 's just the name of the book in chinese .
