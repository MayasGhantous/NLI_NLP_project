  i understand how the conversation got to this point , but do n't make fun of the white men who live in east asia . 
  it 's like bullying children : easy and often justified , but just kind of mean . 
  i know a couple of bilingual english/german kids who went through that phase , but they grew out of it . 
  even in a 50/50 situation , the child is n't learning the exact same things at the same time . 
  there will always be gaps in knowledge that leads to them transferring knowledge of one to the other . 
  then they `` organically '' get the correct forms reinforced and stop doing it , assuming they have enough contact with both languages . 
  because they feel the urge to take a shit , so they do . 
  nah , my town of around 30000 has about five waffle houses in the area , which are always open . 
  i figured that was normal - maybe not waffle house everywhere , but ihop in fancy places or denny 's or something . 
  true , small walmarts close , but if i 'm willing to actually drive into the city ( 30000 ) , it 's 24/7/365 . 
  even by the classical definition , most of the alt-right is n't liberal . 
  they 're straight up fascist . 
  yes , fascism is degenerated capitalism and all that , but we 're at risk of muddling our message if we act like liberals and fascists are one in the same . 
  expecting feminism to address every issue is putting a bit of an unfair burden on women . 
  attacking every kind of oppression is what marxism is about . 
  it 's our job to make these movements work together . 
  people organize most passionately in their own self-interest ; we can fight against homophobia , transphobia , and sexism without insisting that they 're all feminism . 
  marxism is the most well-equipped tool to unite all oppressed classes . 
  i just find it funny how anti-racist movements do n't get flak for not always including whites , for example , but feminism gets asked to include men . 
  that 's not what intersectionality means . 
  but then again i was banned from / r/socialism , so maybe i 'm just out of touch with the reddit left . 
  for other people , practicing by themselves makes them less self-aware and anxious when they start speaking . 
  i personally do n't like to start speaking until i have to ( or maybe solid b1 , but i generally have to first ) . 
   uh trans women are women, 
  never said they were n't . 
  when talking about men in the lgbt movement , which i said i had a problem with being pushed on feminists , your first thought is trans women ? 
  because gay men seems like the more obvious choice here . 
  and yes , that 's what i meant . 
  different groups , despite fighting the same oppressor , can have conflicts on specific issues . 
  we have to work together as socialists , but there needs to be room for women to oppose surrogacy ( if they feel so inclined ) , even though it may be against the interests of gay men . 
  lumping all of these issues together as feminism weakens women 's ability to fight for their own interest by expecting them to fight everyone 's oppression as well as their own . 
  socialists have to find a way to negotiate these conflicts -- the burden is not on women or feminism . 
   third wave feminism is intersectional feminism , i.e. 
  a movement that fights for women 's rights as well as the rights of minorities , lgbt + , etc. 
  that 's what i was responding to when i started participating in this thread . 
  you 've been talking about trans women . 
  i 've been talking about feminism more broadly . 
  intersectionality is a tool for analyzing intersections of oppression . 
  it 's not about expanding anything . 
  crenshaw used it to talk about black women 's experience living on ( at least ) two axes of oppression . 
  other movements can use intersectional analysis as well ; i think it 's been a huge boon to helping marxists understand oppression more broadly . 
  but it does n't mean every feminist and every group needs to concern themselves with every kind of oppression . 
  that 's a deliberate misunderstanding or misapplication liberals use to undermine feminism . 
   we may not be accountable to men , but we are accountable to women -- all of them ,, 
  are black women accountable to white women when they organize around issues that affect black women ? 
  i do n't think so , and i do n't think we should be telling any marginalized group who else they 're responsible for or accountable to , especially not women , who always get asked to deal with everyone else 's shit . 
  i generally do n't like explaining sounds like that , but yes , it 's accurate for what it 's trying to do . 
  [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/standard_chinese_phonology#consonants ) is a less watered down explanation of it . 
  look particularly at the parts where it talks about retroflex consonants , and follow links to clear up any terminology you 're unfamiliar with . 
  why is that irksome ? 
  it 's not like the posts get hidden or anything . 
  who are you learning from ? 
  a lot of speakers do n't distinguish the two . 
  that 's nonstandard , but you wo n't be able to hear the difference from every speaker . 
  you definitely need to know how they affect the vowels that come after them , though . 
  i would recommend you do learn how to distinguish them , though . 
  standard is usually better , unless you 're living somewhere with a particular accent . 
  get some recordings of minimal pairs and drill them until you can hear the difference , then you can learn to pronounce them correctly . 
  the textbook should be using standard pronunciation , as well as most of your online resources . 
  i have n't seen a website that does this , no . 
  it 's especially tricky in this case , because there are no true minimal pairs . 
  the vowels that follow the retroflex consonants ( ch , zh , sh ) never follow the palatal consonants ( q , j , x ) . 
  practicing with pairs like ji\u0101 and zh\u0101 should be good enough , though . 
  there are some good pronunciation drills at the beginning of the fsi chinese course . 
  i 'd look there if i were you . 
  vokale = vowels , fyi . 
  in addition to what i mentioned in my other response , mdbg has audio you can use to compare two similar words . 
  tts is good for single characters , as well . 
  could be useful . 
  if you just listen a lot and pay attention , you 'll work it out in the end somehow or another . 
  i generally downvote people talking about points because i do n't do n't care and do n't think it 's relevant . 
  otherwise not so much . 
  how does requiring force to maintain power make it illegitimate ? 
  your premise seems kind of arbitrary . 
  the lone apostrophe is also used after classical names . 
  odysseus ' boat , achilles ' heel , and so on . 
  james ' ( for one person ) would definitely be an unusual form in the us . 
  james 's is recommended by most style guides . 
  judging by a quick google , st. james 's is more common in the uk , as well . 
  achilles is a classical name . 
  different rules for latin and greek names . 
  i 'm on my phone so i ca n't look up a citation , but i 'm pretty sure most of the major style guides recommend james 's , but achilles ' . 
  i know , it 's an english convention . 
  it has nothing to do with the languages themselves , just whether or not they 're of classical origin . 
  back on the computer . 
  i looked it up and here is a list of style guides which prefer james 's :, 
  chicago manual of style, 
  new york times manual of style and usage, 
  american psychological association, 
  [ telegraph ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/topics/about-us/style-book/1435322/telegraph-style-book-pp.html ), 
  [ the cambridge handbook for editors ] ( https://books.google.de/books?id=lt1r8ve4e80c&amp;pg=pa154&amp;lpg=pa154&amp;dq=cambridge+handbook+copy+edit+possessive&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=stfvdh58ju&amp;sig=ms_acz5wra-tp5p8bg7op2ok8ya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewirvpha97_rahviarqkhesbbisq6aeigjaa#v=onepage&amp;q=cambridge%20handbook%20copy%20edit%20possessive&amp;f=false ), 
  [ the guardian ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/guardian-observer-style-guide-a ), 
  [ purdue owl ] ( https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/621/01/ ), 
  and most importantly , the [ new yorker ] ( http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/comma-queen-possessed ) , arbiter of all that is correct and holy in the english language , prefers james 's . 
  ap and mla are the only two dissenting opinions i could find as far as major style guides go . 
  i went out of my way to include some british style guides , as well , just to demonstrate that this is n't an american thing . 
  look into going to a community college for two years . 
  that will get you in the door , and then you can transfer and possibly get scholarships to finish your degree at a four year university . 
  ( look into phi theta kappa , they 're good for getting scholarships to universities ) . 
  i know a bunch of people from less rich countries who have done this .
