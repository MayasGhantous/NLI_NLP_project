  1 day , 3 days , 7 days , 14 days , 1 month , and so on ( just an example , it depends on your settings ) ? 
  if it does n't , then switch to anki asap . 
  flashcards without some kind of spaced repetition , automatic or otherwise , are much less efficient . 
  it 's free , it syncs between different devices , it is very powerful , and it 's so widely used that there are tons and guides and tutorials on the internet . 
  i 'd be surprised if there 's no guide to converting decks from quizlet if it 's at all possible . 
  if you 're learning word lists from a textbook , you wo n't have to mess with most of the features . 
  just put ge'ez on the front , english on the back ( assuming you 're just learning to read ) , and anki will take care of the rest . 
  maybe tinker with max new cards per day if it 's too much or not enough . 
  portuguese-spanish-catalan-italian , mandarin-cantonese ( written ) , danish-norwegian-swedish , icelandic-faroese , pretty much all the slavic languages , german-dutch-afrikaans-frisian , thai-lao , hindi-urdu , dari-farsi-tajik , pretty much all the turkic languages , navajo-apache , irish-scottish gaelic , zulu-xhosa ... 
  pretty much any closely related languages that have n't had major disruptions or borrowed a large number of loan words . 
  extra points if they 've evolved in close contact ( danish-norwegian ) or are basically just the same language with different names/standardizations for whatever reason . 
  i 've always thought agree to disagree was a bit of a copout . 
  if we were actually okay with each other 's positions , the discussion probably would n't have taken off . 
  agree to disagree is when you and your friends are speculating on next year 's draft picks , not when aunt eva sue thinks we oughtta shoot them niggers keep cutting our power lines . 
  even if it 's a more reasonable position , i do n't feel obliged to accept anyone 's position as valid if i do n't think it is , nor do i expect anyone who really disagrees with me to pretend like it 's okay . 
  conflicts do n't get resolved by cutting off the conversation in the middle . 
  have a good row sometimes , it 's good for you . 
  i do n't trust it to represent me in any way , shape , form , or fashion . 
  never have , and unless something really unexpected happens , probably never will . 
  about the only thing i 'd trust it to do is fight back if another country invaded , and i 'm not even sure it 'd fight back if the invading country gave our politicians enough money or promised them enough power . 
  chinese people can become american . 
  foreigners can become german . 
  no one can become chinese . 
  it 's not just a race thing , or a legal thing . 
  going to china and expecting to be treated like everyone else is asking for disappointment . 
  it 's better to embrace it . 
  i picked a transliteration of a common western name because my real name would n't transliterate well and would n't be instantly recognizable as a name . 
  it worked out fine , would recommend . 
  the only subject i can think of similar to languages is music . 
  neither have shortcuts around tons of practicing . 
  the people you mentioned are not average joes . 
  the russian state and , you can argue , the russian people benefited greatly from guns they did n't have to worry about the rights to, 
  a private firearms sector benefits the business owners and investors more than the average person or worker . 
  if the state ran the factories , the military industrial complex would n't be driven by profit , but by the needs of the state , or more pessimisticly the needs of the bureaucrats in charge . 
  it 's not the best arrangement , but it 's certainly not without its advantages . 
  i do n't want a bunch of private companies controlling the tools we need to defend our country . 
  i might hate our ( us ) government , but they 're at least * supposed * to have better motives than making money . 
  russia had nowhere near the resources of the us when the communists took over , but they industrialized and managed to make the arms race/military build-up competitive for a while . 
  that 's impressive , and their ownership and control over industry played a big role in that . 
   thing is , the ussr nearly went bankrupt and starved millions of people for trying to compete with the us . 
  well yeah , it was kind of a milder version of why north korea spends so much on defense . 
  they felt like they had to be able to challenge the us militarily to secure their existence . 
  i do n't blame them , the us made their opposition to the ussr as a communist state clear from the beginning . 
  the state prioritized defense over the lives of some ukrainian groups that were fighting against them . 
  was it the right call ? 
  i do n't know , i do n't think there was a right call in that situation . 
  if my job were defending the ussr , i can see myself making the same choice . 
   american weapon development was just business , no resources were diverted from other goods and services to make it happen , because of private interests, 
  i disagree . 
  america was much , much more developed . 
  america had a strong , modernized , industrial economy , and could afford weapon development without having to sacrifice nearly as much . 
  during wwii , arms production in the us had to be state-guided at the expense of other industries in some instances as well . 
  america 's arms development and production thrived because of its strong economy despite private interests , not because of them . 
   if there is scarcity , capitalism can outproduce and out-innovate any other system . 
  if america and the ussr had started in the same economic situation , i would put my money on russia . 
  if the countries were judged based on how much progress they made in that time period , russia unquestionably came out better . 
  they went from a feudal regime to a world leader of industry and military in less than a century because of state control . 
  the closest we 've come to having a state owned arms industry in the us was during wwii , and it worked quite well . 
  it was still fundamentally private , though . 
  i reject your claim that it has done better under private industry than it would have under state direction . 
  we 've never really tried it . 
  people much more eloquent than me , from both sides of the political spectrum , have responded to randian capitalist moralizing . 
  if it has n't convinced you i sure wo n't . 
  it 's not just about natural resources , but development . 
  russia had extremely limited industrialization in 1917 . 
  little technology , few factories , non-existent infrastructure . 
  i do n't know what to tell you if you do n't think that 's true without being very patronizing . 
  they did n't have much capital in the country to start with . 
  squandering did n't help , but they were working with much less wealth than we were in almost every way , which meant they had to make tough choices about what to prioritize that we did n't have to make because we had a well developed , industrialized economy . 
  i use the english text on the right to understand what i 'm reading in russian on the left . 
  i gradually pick up more russian words and structures as i read . 
  if our country was founded on the stock market and finance industry , then i 'm a pigeon . 
  also , seeing as how i do n't know anyone rich enough to worry about the stock market or 401k , i 'm happy to vote against the finance sector that makes money despite being completely unnecessary . 
  if you cared about your retirement , you should n't have invested it with a bunch of crooks who invent money and charge other people to use it . 
  i started watching \u534a\u5996\u50be\u57ce recently . 
  it opens with hordes of white soldiers getting killed by a chinese woman . 
  most of the action movies i can think of off the top of my head have ridiculous white villains . 
  and if black people show up , they 're always criminals . 
  do asian movies really have a problem with portraying asians as inferior ? 
  i 'm only familiar with chinese films , but i do n't see the bias you 're talking about . 
  scots and frisian are both made more difficult by the lack of resources and media . 
  i would n't put them at the same difficulty as dutch . 
  generally the germanic languages and romance languages are the easiest for english speakers . 
  dutch , swedish , and norwegian are probably the easiest germanic languages . 
  afrikaans , scots , and frisian would be even easier , but there are very few resources for learning them . 
  germanic languages share a lot of basic vocab with english and are more familiar grammatically , but there are still plenty of things to trip you up . 
  romance languages generally have much more complicated verbs , and the grammar is less familiar , but they compensate by sharing tons of vocab with english . 
  the most common words are different , but things like newspaper articles or books become transparent with much less vocab study than germanic languages . 
  french , spanish , portuguese , and italian are probably the easiest . 
  let 's take a look at the first paragraph of a random wikipedia article from dutch and spanish . 
  i 'll bold the words that you can probably figure out through similarity :, 
  dutch :, 
  ** a ** spacecraft or space ** ship ** ** is ** a vehicle designed ** for ** travel ** outside ** ** the ** atmosphere , ** that is to say ** ** for ** space travel . 
  spanish :, 
  a ** spaceship ** , ** spaceship ** , or ** spaceship ** ** is ** a ** vehicle ** ** designed ** to ** function ** beyond the ** earth 's atmosphere ** , ** in outer space ** . 
  there 's a reason so many people here are recommending germanic languages , but there 's also a reason fsi ranks them the same difficulty as the romance languages . 
  that 's hardly enough material to learn a language . 
  can you come up with enough concrete examples of this in asian movies to show a trend ? 
  if anything it 's more likely to be the influence of hollywood . 
  i think it 's mostly for economic reasons , with the influence of hollywood playing am important but secondary role .
