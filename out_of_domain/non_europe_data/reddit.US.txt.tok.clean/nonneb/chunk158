  it was this feeling that donald trump struck with his promise to `` make america greate again . '', 
  does that help with with losing income and status , unhealthy lifestyles , depression ? 
  driving the the land , you see what the data and statistics do not show . 
  places whose main street is lined with empty display windows and barricaded buildings . 
  whose factories are now industrial wastelands . 
  whose malls have become ghost towns . 
  and whose young and strong have long since moved away to the metropolises on the coasts . 
  and with them the hope of a better future . 
  and the comments , because why not :, 
  whatever reasons they give , it 's not the fault of latinos , gays , blacks , or the media . 
  it 's not trump 's fault either . 
  why the democrats lost the election :, 
  bernie sanders : `` when you 're white , you do n't know what it 's like to be poor '', 
  http://www.politifact.com ... 
  obama : `` they get bitter , they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who are n't like them . '', 
  clinton : `` half of trump 's voters are dim-witted losers/victims . '', 
  racism and discrimination are on the retreat everywhere , but the expression `` white trash '' is still a fashionable word among liberal on the east and west coast . 
  the democratic party abandoned the rural population in the heartland and the inhabitants of the northern industrial stronghold a long time ago . 
  drugs and suicide are running rampant . 
  that 's the environment that carried trump into the white house . 
  `` they get bitter , they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who are n't like them or anti-immigrant sentiment or anti-trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations . '', 
  '' `` when you 're white , you do n't know what it 's like to be living in a ghetto . 
  you do n't know what it 's like to be poor . 
  you do n't know what it 's like to be hassled when you walk down the street or you get dragged out of a car , '' sanders said . '', 
  bernie sanders : `` when you 're white , you do n't know what it 's like to be poor '', 
  `` sparked a controversy friday night after suggesting half of donald trump 's supporters belonged in `` a basket of deplorables '' which she described as consisting of `` the racist , sexist , homophobic , xenophobic , islamaphobic -- you name it . '', 
  she went to note `` some of those folks -- they are irredeemable , but thankfully they are not america '' . '', 
  clinton : `` half of trump 's voters are dim-witted losers/victims . '', 
  it 's very simple . 
  in countries in which the citizens have to pay for healthcare out of their own pocket , the affluent live longer . 
  the poor die earlier . 
  that 's why it was dumb of the trump voters to have voted for trump . 
  because the president will soon eliminate `` obamacare . 
  and he 'll hardly replace it with something `` better , '' no matter what he promised .

  it may be dumb , but it was n't a vote without just cause . 
  you can look at it as a protest . 
  like setting yourself on fire out of protest .

  scientists have projected life expectancy to continue rising in germany and other industrial countries until 2030 . 
  respect , the rules are almost like god : they can see the future , when no one else can even see five years into the future . 
  but you can unfortunately already see one thing : the usa , and especially places like the rust belt and heartland have a massive drug problem , and that 's eating away at the society . 
  you can find anything that gets you high or eats away at your mind there , especially modern drugs . 
  the families are being torn apart , and in some areas , the welfare system can hardly keep up because it 's simply too much . 
  they more or less look on helplessly . 
  a phenomenon that has n't really entered the public consciousness . 
  a phenomenon that has n't really entered the public consciousness . 
  the usa is always a step ahead of us . 
  in the above article , you do n't look at the society in awe of it 's technological development , but a society that shows where the future of a neoliberal , profit-maximizing , pruned economic and social policy is headed . 
  it profits a few who become zillionaires and do n't know what to do with the cash , while the rest get fat , dumb , poor , and die earlier . 
  distracted by nonsensical and cheap electronic discussion , in which protagonists from the dumb mass continue to be voted into leadership positions , not knowing that he is the butcher of himself and his like . 
  we should dare to look in the crystal glass at europe/germany . 
  you can already recognize the basis for it . 
  what language are you asking about ? 
  oh that was in the title . 
  i ca n't read , sorry . 
   live in a nice suburb with a big yard . 
  is that the american lifestyle ? 
  as a southerner with lots of experience hating on yankees , that 's not what high-minded means when talking about yankees . 
  a closer approximation would be `` up their own ass with self-righteousness . '', 
  pretending not to understand a southerner using a valid , contextually clear definition of a word to make yourself feel better might qualify , i 'm not sure . 
  i did it , for science . 
  quick note on one of your questions though :, 
   which type of water do you use to drink ? 
  i think you meant `` which type of water do you usually drink ? '', 
  i 'm not sure if you were going for * used to * as in the past ( probably not ) , * be used to * , or * use for * , but the question works either way . 
  so i checked the german version and a correct , literal translation would be `` which kind of water do you use for drinking ? 
  '' , though i 'd still be more straightforward with the english question . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/learningenglish/grammar/learnit/learnitv284.shtml ) 's a quick look at why you need * for * instead of * to * there . 
  tl ; dr * to * is for an individual , one-time purpose , and * for * is used to describe what something is generally used * for * . 
  ( if you do n't care , just ignore this . 
  it was n't meant as a criticism . 
  i just used to teach english and ca n't really turn it off/still find it interesting . 
  in context , i 'm sure everyone still understood what you meant . ), 
   are germans friendly ? 
  depends on what your comparing it to . 
  if you 're european , they 'll probably seem averagely friendly . 
  if you 're american , you 'll probably get culture shock because they do n't smile or talk to each other as much as we 're used to , not to mention the directness . 
  also , making friends with germans is a very long process . 
  do n't expect to have new , close friends within two weeks like if you were moving to a new place in the us/mexico . 
   judgemental, 
  not particularly , no . 
  it might affect you trying to get certain jobs , but tattoos and such very much fall into the `` private '' sphere , and i doubt anyone gives you shit about it . 
   english, 
  not sure about osnabr\u00fcck . 
  i do n't live that far away , but i 've never spent much time there . 
   vegetarian/vegan friendly, 
  every place there 's a university , there are plenty of vegan places . 
  the other stuff is too specific to osnabr\u00fcck for me , but like the other commenter said , you 'd have better luck asking in / r/germany . 
  i 'm also from near gadsden , but it 's been a while since i lived there . 
  besides the problems caused by the economy , i do n't think gadsden is a shithole . 
  there 's a good bit going on for a town that size , and the downtown area is about as nice as you can expect it to be . 
  is there anything you think makes it a shithole besides just being poor ? 
  the hospitals are expensive , even by american standards . 
  i 've never had better than very mediocre experiences there , most of them simply bad . 
  unfortunately nobody is pushing any good options for fixing american healthcare , so there 's not much to do until people get pissed off enough to get violent . 
  nationalizing resources and infrastructure generally does n't go over well . 
  on reddit , taking factories from the owners and distributing the profits to the workers instead of shareholders is usually called `` theft '' . 
  killing capitalists who try to fight back when you take their factories is also generally scoffed at . 
  most any call to violence , now that i think about it .
