  i know , but english does n't see the same distinction . 
  they are n't real until they happen , and they have n't happened when you utter the second sentence . 
  they are potential until they happen , real when they do . 
  it 's not wrong to use the real or unreal conditional to talk about potential problems in the future . 
  the question is just how likely you think they are . 
  similar story with the word may . 
  who is the rest of the population that the costs would be passed to ? 
  i get the impression from my citydwelling acquaintances that median people are doing great there , either , and it 's not due to rural people holding them back . 
  trade barriers are first and foremost a a hindrance to multinational corporations . 
  yes , i think corporations working in the us should bear the brunt of the costs of keeping a stable economy that benefits the workers . 
  no , i do n't consider it a handout , nor do i think handouts are the only way to handle a post-employment economy . 
  people have been interested in and writing about this for a while now . 
  a lot of the responses in this thread seem to assume i value the free market , which i do n't at all . 
  not even a little bit . 
  i would be nationalizing/otherwise reclaiming industries left and right if were up to me . 
  the promise is to help in the future with currently potential problems that become real in the future . 
  that 's how potentiality and the word may works in english . 
  a lot of / r/shitamericanssay should actually just be / r/imnotthetargetaudience, 
  i 'd ask for clarification , but i 'd understand it as the car may get damaged , it may not . 
  if it does n't get damaged , i do n't pay . 
  the first sentence is n't grammatically correct , is it ? 
  i 'm just a learner , but i had the impression that the first sentence is wrong . 
  in my experience , germans say merci to each other about as much as americans say gracias . 
  it 's just a kind of funny , offbeat thing to say . 
  i never read too much into it . 
  nrw , by the way, 
  interesting . 
  is there a difference in meaning ? 
  i 've only been learning from novels , and as far as i noticed , a possessive pronoun referring to the subject is usually \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0439 . 
  i 'd appreciate any insight or links to read more about this . 
  these kinds of requests show up on hinative sometimes as well . 
  if rhinospike does n't do it for you , might want to check that out . 
  the same way we ( allies ) justified bombing cities during world war ii . 
  i 'm not saying it 's good reasoning , but if you think your enemy is a fundamental evil ( anarchists , for the rebels/resistance ) , you can justify a lot of stuff by saying it 's necessary to win . 
  a good way to get around explaining things when you do n't feel like it is just linking to something that explains it or can help the reader figure out what you 're talking about . 
  yes , it 's very similar . 
  the notebook feature is n't italki 's focus , but if there are enough people to correct it and help you it 's more or less the same . 
  it sounds like the piece you 're missing is a lemmatizer . 
  when i search for [ lemmatizer russian ] ( https://www.google.de/?hl=en&amp;gws_rd=cr&amp;ei=wib7wpnhaooqsggypododg#hl=en&amp;q=lemmatizer+russian ) on google , i get a couple of promising results from github and a few blogs about people doing the same thing . 
  sorry i do n't have personal experience , but maybe that will help . 
  in my experience , most people who say chinese grammar is easy fall into two camps : people who have studied less than one or two years of chinese ( or < hsk4 ) , and people who had bad experiences with declension/conjugation tables in school and never successfully learned a european language . 
  but that was n't an option , so it 's good . 
  unfortunately i do n't know exactly why . 
  i just know it as the pattern that corresponds to hear someone doing something , see someone doing something , etc. 
  between the time i wrote my first comment and now , i heard my ( native ) partner say , `` ich hab ihn weinen geh\u00f6rt . '', 
  the infinitive may be dominant , but the past participle 's not exactly uncommon , either . 
  had to sounds better to me , but i would n't call the second sentence wrong . 
  backshifting is n't always obligatory , but if you 're not sure , it 's probably a safer choice to do it . 
  i 'm only mildly infuriated that i do n't have one , otherwise i do n't see what you 're talking about . 
  i 've travelled almost everywhere in europe , and lived in three different european countries . 
  i 've also lived in a few places in the us . 
  i do n't think europe is more diverse culturally . 
  linguistically , yes , but diversity in any other metric i 've heard for culture can be found in the us just as well . 
  unpopular opinion , but i just do n't buy the europe is so diverse thing . 
  they like causing problems with each other , but they could very easily be a megastate like the us or china and have comparable levels of diversity . 
  in an international setting , being an english speaker is a type of privilege . 
  educated germans who do n't speak english get ridiculed , and even the idea that germans can be educated and not speak english is getting kind of weird . 
  this is something we never have to worry about , because we speak the most common lingua franca . 
  i think this subreddit 's understanding of just how many people speak english betrays their class bias . 
  the only way you can interact primarily with english speakers in most of the world is to hang out with upper class people . 
  in that sense , people are right . 
  learning a language to do business with international corporations is a fool 's errand . 
  they all have english speakers . 
  but most people do n't speak english . 
  if you only learn about other countries through their english speakers , you get a view that skews heavily upper class . 
  this is part of why the western media ca n't seem to understand why maduro has any support at all . 
  in the same way , english speaking russians are way more likely to be liberal , prowestern , etc. 
  i learn languages because i like experiencing cultures firsthand . 
  business wise , english usually works if you 're going over international borders . 
  but you ca n't get the perspective of average people firsthand through english , except perhaps in scandinavia . 
  that 's why i learn languages . 
  here is a list of style guides which prefer lattice 's :, 
  chicago manual of style, 
  new york times manual of style and usage, 
  american psychological association, 
  [ telegraph ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/topics/about-us/style-book/1435322/telegraph-style-book-pp.html ), 
  [ the cambridge handbook for editors ] ( https://books.google.de/books?id=lt1r8ve4e80c&amp;pg=pa154&amp;lpg=pa154&amp;dq=cambridge+handbook+copy+edit+possessive&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=stfvdh58ju&amp;sig=ms_acz5wra-tp5p8bg7op2ok8ya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewirvpha97_rahviarqkhesbbisq6aeigjaa#v=onepage&amp;q=cambridge%20handbook%20copy%20edit%20possessive&amp;f=false ), 
  [ the guardian ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/guardian-observer-style-guide-a ), 
  [ purdue owl ] ( https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/621/01/ ), 
  and most importantly , the [ new yorker ] ( http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/comma-queen-possessed ) , arbiter of all that is correct and holy in the english language , prefers lattice 's . 
  ap and mla are the only two dissenting opinions i could find as far as major style guides go . 
  the rules about putting 's on the end are all phonological . 
  i do n't think the fact that lattice ends with an `` e '' plays any role . 
  i always thought spud was a british thing . 
  i 've always heard them called potatoes in the us , and i definitely do n't know spud as an insult . 
  turnip would have made just as much sense . 
  option 4 ) listen to audiobook in target language while reading bilingual text . 
  that 's what i 'd choose most of the time , but options 1 ) and 3 ) are very useful past a certain point as well . 
  3 ) takes less time than you might think . 
  it takes me 10 minutes to read a chapter in english that it will take an hour to listen to in russian . 
  2 ) is good for practicing reading , but i never do it because i 'd rather practice listening , too . 
  cities are pretty similar , but i 'd say that 's true in europe as well . 
  how different are frankfurt , madrid , and prague ? 
  rural areas always highlight the differences more clearly , in my opinion . 
  you have a point with the architecture , especially comparing places with moorish or ottoman influence to those without . 
  i was thinking more of diversity in people . 
  the general demeanor and values of people between minnesota , southern california , wyoming , appalachia , the coastal south , the louisiana bayou , and new englanders vary at least as much as demeanor and values in europe . 
  and if you go to a restaurant serving local fare , you 'll get about as much diversity in cuisine , as well . 
  i live in europe , so i do n't really get the foreign country feeling at all here , which is part of why i do n't think it 's especially diverse . 
  yes .
