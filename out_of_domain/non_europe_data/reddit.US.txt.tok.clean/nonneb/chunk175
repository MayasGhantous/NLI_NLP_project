  they sound nothing alike to me . 
  al has the / \u00e6 / sound ( also true in british , right ? 
  ) , while german albrecht starts with / a / . 
  you 're right that it 's certainly not the british sound in `` all '' . 
  german does n't even have the voiceless l / l\u0325 / . 
  i think what you 're trying to say is `` do n't use [ \u029f ] '' , but that has nothing to do with voicing . 
  for someone who knows nothing about german , this is about as close of an approximation as you can get with english sounds . 
  the only think i 'd add is that \u00fc is often anglicized as / ju / ( sounds like the word `` you '' ) . 
  then again , i think trying to pronounce names the way they 're spoken in their native language is more often douchey than not , especially when you do n't know the language and ca n't make the sounds , so i would n't recommend any of it , but if an english speaker has to try this is pretty good . 
  do n't mind the haters . 
  being able to understand is a gradual process , but if i had to pick one memorable point , it was a little over six months in when i realized i was understanding german even when i was n't paying attention or trying to . 
  not perfectly of course , but i could understand the radio even while off in la-la land driving on the autobahn . 
  i never did lessons at all . 
  towards the end of the year i listened to all the harry potter audiobooks in german , and that helped a lot . 
  i also started reading the spiegel and looking up words i did n't know , just one or two articles per day . 
  i 'd say 90 % of my learning was just from having to get around germany in german and parroting what i heard other people say . 
  in social situations you 're gon na have a lot of context to help you out , and people tend to talk about the same stuff all the time . 
  the first things i learned to talk about were the weather , soccer , and insurance . 
  edit : and like other people said , that a2 studying will turn out to be a big help after you get tuned in a bit . 
  having the basics like declensions and conjugations down pat will make it way easier to progress . 
  yes , but not like the name al. 
  being able to to mix up / \u00e6 / and / a / as a native english speaker seems crazy to me . 
  / a / is much more likely to be heard as the vowel in lot [ \u0251 ] for native english speakers . 
  i 've never heard a native english speaker mix up / \u00e6 / and / a / in any language . 
  / \u0251 / and / a / is normally a big problem , though . 
  germany for a few years . 
  people do n't talk to strangers . 
  people do n't smile . 
  no unlimited drinks . 
  everything is always closed except while you 're at work . 
  if it is illegal , it is considered impossible . 
  there is no trace of optimism anywhere . 
  everything anyone wants to try is a bad idea . 
  the answer to every question is an immediate , kneejerk `` no '' , even if it 's obviously yes . 
  and on that note , oh my lord customer service . 
  you have to really fight to get people to do their jobs , here . 
  it 's very effective , especially when it 's the right level or you already know the story well , but i 'd recommend using the audiobooks at the same time . 
  reading just makes you good at reading . 
  you should be practicing listening from the start . 
  i disagree on learning latin first . 
  latin is easier at the beginning , but i found it much more difficult to become a competent reader . 
  the cases are n't as distinct as in greek , and you kind of have to get a feel how romans construct things to make any sense of it because the case/gender system does n't do the work for you . 
  greek , on the other hand , if you know your declensions , conjugations , and vocab , usually makes sense . 
  this is of course just my personal experience , but it 's something i 've heard from other classics students as well . 
  tl ; dr latin is easier to learn , harder to use . 
  same thing here , i first heard of reddit watching youtube videos about starcraft . 
  w\u014fde h\u00e0ny\u016d b\u00f9h\u0103o . 
  just because the pinyin with offset tones really bothered me for some reason . 
  wiktionary.org lists the perfective or imperfective pair next to the infinitive . 
  on [ this entry ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%d0%b2%d0%b7%d0%b3%d0%bb%d1%8f%d0%b4%d1%8b%d0%b2%d0%b0%d1%82%d1%8c ) , for example , you can see that ( impf ) is written near the verb , and the perfective counterpart is listed to the right . 
  on my computer it looks like w\u01d2 de h\u00e0ny\u01d4 b\u00f9h\u01ceo instead of w\u014f de h\u00e0ny\u016d b\u00f9h\u0103o . 
  it 's not a big deal , just \u00e6sthetically displeasing . 
  i 'd still take it over the version where the tones do n't go over the letters , but pick your poison , i guess . 
  interesting . 
  both windows and reddit is fun for android are showing it with offset tones . 
  i checked and firefox on my linux machine displays them correctly . 
  i had this particular word open because i had looked it up while reading harry potter , so between harry potter and wiktionary i 'm pretty sure it exists . 
  is it not commonly used ? 
  first off this seems to have some errors/typos ( they do n't seem intentional , i could be wrong ) , so i tried to capture that in the english . 
  if anyone else thinks i over or underdid it let me know . 
  departure and you shall sleep, 
  if you are n't , you will die, 
  death is mysterious and magical, 
  but only you is never awake, 
  when you are awake , you walk in pain, 
  you can die in many different ways, 
  the world is an evil place, 
  sleep is a risky thing , because spiffy, 
  flee quickly when death approaches, 
  sleep can be the only option , when the time approaches, 
  but sleep is death , so that does not go well, 
  thus they run on the street as they are death knell, 
  death knell kill the grim reaper, 
  because you are no wood expert, 
  only a wood expert can destroy the forest, 
  and so must the story end, 
  just a couple of little things :, 
  forest , not forrest, 
  that 's how the story ~ ~ have ~ ~ has to end, 
  `` the sleep is a risky thing '' sounds a funny . 
  i think it 's because sleep as a noun is uncountable , but i 'd have to double-check the exact reason why . 
  `` when you not are '' does n't work either , not even when it 's poetic . 
  everything else looks fine to me , considering the source material . 
  if you had reasons i missed for doing the things i `` corrected '' , i 'd be interested in hearing them . 
  it 's japanese . 
  ! translated, 
  this is japanese , not chinese . 
  the different character simplifications give it away , plus it 's the name of a university in tokyo . 
  it is not that one . 
  i 've heard people complain about that translation as well , but i 'm still bad enough at russian that i do n't notice . 
  just to clarify , exactly what parts of the linked instructions would you like the translator to do ? 
  is all you want a translation of their information on gsxt.gov.cn ? 
   i wish it was n't heavily influenced by french . 
  i wish there were a difference between all of the yous . 
  i find it interesting that you did n't use the subjunctive in the first sentence , then did in the second . 
  in spanish , adjective genders are really nice because it helps distinguish who or what you 're talking about . 
  it 's not that useful in noun phrases , but in predicates , especially when the subject is omitted , it it helps make it clear what they 're referring to . 
  the last language of the week was literally a second german thread . 
  they also announced they 're going to alternate weeks between new languages and repeating languages that have already been done . 
  this is one of my favorite language of the week posts in a while because it has a few grammar features i 've never seen before .
