  i had to read it a few times before it stopped rhyming with yokel . 
  provide universal healthcare ; repeal restrictive gun laws ; break up the media oligopoly ; rehabilitate workers ' collective bargaining rights , both within the traditional union and in non-union workplaces and industries . 
  i follow soccer in german and spanish and baduk in chinese . 
  the group of people i play chess with normally speak german . 
  i read a lot , so that fits with most languages nicely . 
  i learned bopomofo very early in my studies . 
  the second textbook i used was pavc , and zhuyin just seemed much more straightforward to me . 
  at the time , i already knew pinyin and just liked typing in bopomofo because i could specify tones . 
  i think more resources should use it , though , because it 's much more difficult for the learner to get confused . 
  in zhuyin , one symbol = one sound . 
  memorize it and done . 
  pinyin could be learned that way , but you 'd still have to learn the rules for different pronunciations after the retroflex and palatal consonants . 
  in practice , learners make tons of mistakes because , for example , < i  can be pronounced four different ways depending on context , and that 's not always easy for learners to grasp . 
  the argument for pinyin , as far as i understand it , is that it 's used in mainland china . 
  that 's all well and good , but how often do foreigners have to use pinyin in china ? 
  as long as you know the characters , the romanization system is n't super important . 
  teach with zhuyin or yale first and then learners can pick up pinyin when they go to china . 
   i wish people who need a substitution would use `` sti '' instead of `` ssi '' - it 's a lot clearer . 
  or just put in a little schwa like lots of people do with < kn  . 
  i prefer it the right way , of course , but i usually do n't have to try to figure out what they 're saying from context if they pronounce it k ^ ( \u0259 ) nabo instead of knabo . 
  i do n't feel connected or united with people across the country . 
  i did when i was a kid and bought into all the unity rhetoric , but then i moved out of the us . 
  most of the americans i knew after moving were n't southerners , and we had nothing in common because of where we were from , not any more than me and a brit . 
  they were n't what i associated with american . 
  i also realized that my standards for being the `` same '' were really low . 
  driving across the us is n't that much more or less of a culture variation than driving across europe . 
   i have been to the states once and everywhere i went , i saw american flags . 
  i thought that was pretty odd , but neat . 
  come to [ bumfuck ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d8/gadsden_flag.svg/1200px-gadsden_flag.svg.png ) , [ alabama ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/flag_of_alabama.svg/1280px-flag_of_alabama.svg.png ) , and you 'll see a lot of a [ different flag ] ( http://www.rd.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/03/01-confederate-flag-facts.jpg ) s , none of which have too much positive to say about our union or federal government . 
  i most certainly can and do complain . 
  this league needs salary caps or something to keep it interesting . 
  yeah , battling for europe and relegation is interesting , but it 's not nearly as all that * plus * battling for the top spot . 
  it wo n't happen does n't necessarily mean it 's a bad idea . 
  in most places , there are n't enough serbians for people to think too much about them either way . 
  for people who do know something about serbia or serbians , you 'll probably be lumped in with other slavs , i.e. 
  white but not quite . 
  here 's the [ declension table of the word nett ] ( http://www.canoo.net/inflection/nett:a ) . 
  be careful about whether you need the strong , weak , or mixed declension pattern . 
  because there 's no article , you need strong in this case . 
  this is n't the progressive , for starters . 
  `` ringing '' is a gerund in english , but that does n't make it progressive unless it 's accompanied by a form of the word `` to be '' ( sometimes not even then , but that 's neither hither nor yonder ) . 
  it 's not progressive in spanish , either . 
  when you learn a verb , you should also learn what form of a word follows it and whether or not it takes a preposition . 
  for example , it 's quiero + infinitive , voy + a + infinitive , trato + de + infinitive , sigo + gerund . 
  in spanish , this is pretty easy because it 's usually the infinitive , but you need to pay attention to it nonetheless . 
  `` disfrutar '' is a little tricky because because it can be disfrutar + infinitive , disfrutar + de + noun , disfrutar + de + infinitive and disfrutar + noun . 
  to me it sounds more normal to say `` les gusta tocar las campanas '' , but check and see what native speakers say about what sounds most natural . 
  used to , i 'd have sessions where i did anki ( audio sentence flashcards ) , and other sessions where i watched and read stuff . 
  now my study sessions are 100 % watching and reading stuff , looking up stuff i do n't know if it bothers me . 
  i still do anki , but i manage to fit most of it into dead time . 
  lack of self-governance . 
  i wish all the best to new york , but if we get forced to follow laws they want or vice versa it 's naturally going to piss people off . 
  it 's frustrating when 80 % of the people you know agree with you about an issue but the government says it 's illegal ( let 's say prayer in schools , as a random example ) . 
  it 's easy to demonize people who disagree , especially if you hardly know any . 
  as someone who lives in europe , i hate one and two euro coins . 
  they 're bulky and quickly become too numerous for my wallet to handle . 
  we probably just like them because they 're there , we 're used to them , and they 're convenient . 
  still happens to me after being here for years . 
  i pay for a coke with a five and my first instinct when getting only coins back is `` what the hell is this ? '', 
  what 's good for native speakers is not necessarily good for learners . 
  why would it ? 
  what native chinese speakers need from a pronunciation system and what learners need from a pronunciation system are completely different . 
  children learning pinyin in the prc are n't used to alphabets , nor are they bringing preconceived notions of how alphabets work with them into the classroom . 
  pinyin is consistent and * can * be used to represent the sounds of mandarin . 
  that 's all the native speaking population using it means . 
  i do n't see why it 'd have any bearing on whether or not it 's the best system for learners . 
  also , the population of the prc is a long way from all knowing pinyin . 
  i 've met plenty of old people who are n't comfortable with it . 
  they are using ipa . 
  note the brackets to indicate phonetic transcription in the title . 
  in the rest of the text , they use nyu for [ nju ] and noo for [ nu ] , which makes sense , because most people here probably ca n't read ipa . 
  for the most part , americans drop the [ j ] after alveolar consonants , but it does differ to a certain extent by person and region . 
  [ this page ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/phonological_history_of_english_consonant_clusters#y-cluster_reductions ) has more info on it . 
  the phenomenon is called yod dropping . 
  as someone who grew up around it but does n't hear it much anymore , it always makes me feel at home . 
  i completely agree , and things have gotten pretty divisive before , too . 
  now is bad , but it 's been much worse , and the cause is ultimately the same . 
  i agree with all of this . 
  that does n't mean it 's the best system for learners . 
  the difference between pinyin and french is that pinyin is n't nearly as common as french written in the latin script . 
  i agree the advantages are n't groundbreaking , but i still think the advantages of starting with zhuyin or yale outweigh the disadvantages . 
  pinyin is a cinch if you already speak chinese , and students not living in china do n't need pinyin early on in their studies , so i would use a system that works better for english-speakers who do n't already speak chinese . 
  it 's common in north carolina and south alabama/northern florida , but i think it 's a minority pronunciation elsewhere , at least according to [ this map ] ( https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:iw-uw_merger.svg ) . 
  i do n't know where that 3000 figure comes from . 
  at 3000 characters i felt semi-literate at best . 
  to read like a high school graduate you probably want to know closer to 5000 characters . 
  everything is singular , so it 's `` everything that is ... '', 
  neither of the last two is correct . 
  when you 're writing latinx , no it 's not . 
  when you 're telling other people they have to , then you 're going into prescriptivist territory and trying to change people 's speech/writing patterns . 
  i live in small town germany and shops having their own web page is not really a thing here . 
  even some of the takeout places do n't have websites . 
  it 's like the us at the turn of the millenium . 
  not because of the infrastructure or anything like that , not at all , just that it 's not embraced and used for as many things by as many people . 
  i 'm from a comparably sized town in the usa , and it resembles the culture of internet use situation 10 years ago , maybe more . 
   a ridiculous amount of youtube videos were banned . 
  that was probably gema , but that was lifted recently . 
  it was a huge pain in the ass for years , though . 
  now i usually only notice things being country blocked if it 's about hitler or something . 
   i also was surprised to see you can not get google street view in most of germany , which is weird because france is covered perfectly .
