  mixing something like a non-rhotic accent with a rhotic one ( both of which exist in the carolinas ) will sound equally odd . 
  this is actually the main contributing factor to why i ca n't watch house of cards unless it 's dubbed . 
  the best thing you can do if you want to learn a southern accent is learn the cmt accent . 
  it 's the most prestigious/widely-broadcast southern accent and it wo n't sound unfamiliar to anyone in the us . 
  if you really want to keep it to a more specific location , you 'll want to narrow in on one city to focus on , or at least one dialect region . 
  otherwise it 'll sound kind of like an american mixing cockney , geordie , and rp for a british accent . 
  something similar may be true about southern california , i do n't know . 
  dialects tend to be a little more uniform out west . 
  edit : by cmt accent , i mean what you hear most on country music television . 
  barbecue is a distinct way of cooking pork . 
  you smoke it . 
  it takes a long time , it 's an art form , and there 's lots of regional variation . 
  the best is objectively a pulled pork sandwich with slightly spicy barbecue sauce served with coleslaw , by the way . 
  some yankees , coming from an area that does n't have barbecue , call their cookouts `` barbecues '' . 
  a cookout is where you grill meat on a grill . 
  it 's very different from barbecue . 
  because you 're asking about briquettes , i assume you 're talking about grilling . 
  and to answer your question , i do n't think it makes a big difference when you 're grilling . 
  the smoke does n't add that much flavor itself . 
  wood charcoal is critical when barbecuing . 
  can you replace the word if with whether ? 
  if yes , then use `` ob '' . 
  that works most of the time . 
  any example in particular that 's giving you trouble ? 
  i really need to stop precoffee redditing . 
  you hear it a lot for emphasis , meaning more or less the same thing as in diesem ... 
  it usually gets a long vowel as well . 
  op is n't asking for an hsk level . 
  since they used grade levels , it seems like they 're asking what the target education level of the newspaper is . 
  the fox news website and the new yorker are both written for native audiences , but one requires a higher reading level/level of education to read comfortably . 
  same thing in german , bild is way easier to read than the s\u00fcddeutsche zeitung . 
  both for natives , but different reading levels . 
  but in no ways helps answer op 's question . 
  no , but i also did n't complain about being downvoted for an unhelpful answer . 
  german : adjective declension, 
  spanish : listening comprehension, 
  chinese : pretty much everything about grammar, 
  ancient greek : verb conjugation, 
  latin : figuring out which words agree with each other in poetry, 
  russian : verb aspects and prefixes, 
  esperanto : esperantists , 
  german is n't much harder than french if you already speak english . 
  chinese helps a bit with korean , but it 's still much harder than german or french . 
  learning what you 're interested in almost always works out better in the end , anyways . 
  you can learn what duolingo teaches just by mousing over the words , the pictures , reading the grammar tips and notes , and trial and error . 
  that said , while i think the vietnamese course is pretty good , duolingo by itself wo n't get you very far . 
  that has more to do with what 's covered in the course than the way they cover it , though . 
  from someone who 's pretty neutral on trump , this conversation looks a lot more like disagreement than delusion . 
  clearly-sighted makes it sound like you sighted something clearly . 
  i 'm not saying it would never make sense , but it 's certainly not common . 
  `` clear-sighted '' means that you have clear sight . 
  compare it to big-boned , not * bigly-boned . 
  `` boned '' is n't a vpp here because there is no verb `` to bone '' with that meaning . 
  the - d turns the adj + noun combination into an adjective . 
  the second half is n't a participle itself . 
  edit : other similar constructions to consider : red-headed , long-legged , big-hearted , quick-witted, 
  english is n't that different than russian . 
  think of produce versus produce . 
  as for your question , this [ reddit post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/korean/comments/1q7svn/how_do_you_know_which_syllables_to_stress/ ) and this [ topic ] ( https://forum.wordreference.com/threads/korean-stress.1947298/ ) might help shed some light . 
  this is what i came to the comments to mention . 
  `` if i were writing when you called , i would have let it go to voicemail '' is not a grammatical sentence to my ears or according to any prescriptive standard . 
  your sentence is correct . 
  a lot of the things you marked as subjunctives are not subjunctives at all , but part of real conditional sentences . 
  the subjunctive is used in unreal conditionals . 
  all of these examples you gave are not subjunctives : past prog subj , pres simple subj ( all three ) , pres perf subj , pres perf prog subj , future simple subj , future progressive subj , future perf subjunctive , future perf prog subj, 
  here 's how the subjunctives should look :, 
  i recommend he * be * there . 
  it is important that he * appear * in court . 
  past subj . 
  ( present unreal meaning ) i wish she were here . 
  if the ocean were whiskey , and i were a duck , i would swim to the bottom and not come back up . 
  and you had past perfect subjunctive correct . 
  you could add progressive if you wanted to . 
  there 's even a perfect subjunctive , as in `` it is essential that he have completed two years of spanish before graduation '' . 
  that normally is n't taught , though , because it 's so uncommon . 
  depends on where the paper is being published , but in general i like the chicago manual of style . 
  they do use different names for the subjunctive than i did in this thread , though . 
  it 's a hypothetical/unreal situation in the past , which means most english speakers will use `` if i had been writing '' . 
  if i saw your sentence in a paper , i 'd just assume it was a mistake and fix it . 
  what i wrote is also a subjunctive . 
  the issue here is n't whether or not to use a subjunctive or the use of was/were , but simply that your sentence is not the right tense . 
  i 'm kind of surprised it does n't set off your native speaker spidey sense , assuming you are a native speaker . 
  according to the oxford dictionary of english grammar , the subjunctive is actually increasing in use , at least in britain . 
  was/were for the subjunctive is mostly just a choice of register . 
  i listened to the first lesson on soundcloud . 
  the guy recording sounds fine , and the sentences sound natural . 
  that 's only a small sample , but i do n't hear any problems . 
   bob : `` you were writing last night , were n't you !, 
  admit it ! '', 
  jane : `` but i answered your call !, 
  if i was writing when you called , i would have let it go to voicemail . '', 
  `` if i was writing '' is the wrong tense . 
  `` if i were writing '' is the wrong tense . 
  `` were '' is a subjunctive that refers to non-past times . 
  to refer to an unreal event ( writing ) in the past ( last night ) , you need to use `` had been '' . 
  if you need a subjunctive referring to something in the past , you use the form of the pluperfect . 
  `` i had been writing '' would be correct in your example . 
  `` if i had been writing when you called ... '', 
  `` had been writing '' is the subjunctive referring to an unreal event the past , so it takes the form of the past perfect . 
  `` called '' is a real event in the past , so we use the simple past .
