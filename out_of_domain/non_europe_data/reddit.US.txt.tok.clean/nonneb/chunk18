  the system has only caught on in a few relevant fields in the us . 
  unless an employer asks , there 's no real need to bother with it at all . 
  the [ ilr ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/interagency_language_roundtable_scale ) is the best us equivalent , but it does n't have much international traction , or use within the us for that matter . 
  the widespread demand for it just is n't there yet . 
  `` and yet ... is it not relevant that , during the period that the classics were the only subjects taught in leading schools , `` britannia ruled '' in almost every respect . '', 
  i studied classics and love the idea of more latin in schools as much as anyone , but attributing the teaching of latin to the pre\u00ebminence of britain during the height of its empire is a little much . 
  i 'm having trouble parsing the first sentence . 
  how is it different from `` who wants to f ** k ? '', 
  can i not read or did they completely forget to mention that it is also a substitute for have not and has not ? 
  zhuyin is used for indigenous formosan languages , which is probably why it was included . 
  well , here 's where i remember seeing it , but it 's citation needed , so who knows the accuracy . 
  it 's apparently used to write other dialects of chinese as well , according to the article , but if you 're not familiar with it , i trust you over unsourced wikipedia assertions . 
  the closest i can come is this , http://210.240.194.97/tg/unicode/twmd/sengko/n1712r.htm , which talks about extended bopomofo for minnan and hakka . 
  even from the standard european neoliberal outlook , democrats would be center-right . 
  compare the democrats ' policies to the cdu in germany , for example . 
  any kind of oppression is bad , whether people be oppressed economically , because of perceived race , gender , or sexual orientation , among others things . 
  so i 100 % support gay rights and same sex marriage . 
  health care should be everyone 's right . 
  any of the reforms to the system within capitalism are imperfect , but if it saves workers ' lives , i 'll support it while we work to overthrow the system . 
  gun control : / u/redzeal 's answer . 
  this is an especially important issue in the united states , where gun control laws are overwhelmingly used to put young black people in jail , furthering racial oppression as well as taking away our means to fight back . 
  ( relevant argument against drug laws , as well ) . 
  immigration is a much trickier issue . 
  on the one hand , i sympathize with socialist states wanting to prevent the exodus of capital , including skills and intellectual capital . 
  on the other hand , it seems to go against the ideals of internationalism and divides us by countries instead of uniting us as workers . 
  i do n't have a strong opinion on this one , but i tend to favor more open borders , and immigrants should always have their rights protected . 
  i 've had a couple german feminists tell me that they prefer things like `` policemen and policewomen '' to `` police officers '' because it explicitly includes women , whereas police officers are conceived of as male regardless of what gender the word is . 
  i hope they catch up to using neutral language when possible , though . 
  including two genders instead of one does n't help all the people who identify as neither . 
  if you 're going to try to steer a language from on top , at least aim high . 
  exactly . 
  the problem is that by using the masculine form for the neutral form , it invisiblizes the female component of the mix and reinforces the idea that the male is the normative human being . 
   only it can be used to reer to both men and women ( and everybody else ) . 
  i 'm not so sure about that . 
  compare `` die studenten '' , masculine , possibly mixed , but widely regarded by women as excluding them ; and `` die studierende '' , which is not a masculine form , and thus more neutral . 
  or that 's how i understand the argument , at least . 
   you 'll have to ... 
  i 'll give you benefit of the doubt and assume you 're not a native english speaker , but that 's a very impolite thing to say . 
  some of my friends i mentioned in the original comment told me about this particular study . 
  from wikipedia :, 
  sandra l. bem , daryl j. bem : does sex-biased job advertising `` aid and abet '' sex discrimination ? 
  in : journal of applied social psychology . 
  snore . 
  focus on how your throat feels as you do it . 
  as you 're snoring comfortably , keep the `` purring '' sound going as you breathe out . 
  after you 've got that down , hum while you do it . 
  different tricks work for different people , but that 's how i first made the right sound . 
  it still took a decent bit of practice to pull off consistently , though . 
  it usually varies freely , sometimes with the voiceless approximant as well . 
  for hungarian , i use http://online-filmek.cc/ ( it 's not live , but there are lots of shows and movies ) . 
  that 's the only site i use regularly for streaming . 
  normally i just download what i want to watch . 
  many people in miami do speak miami english . 
  you can generally tell if it 's a typo / brain slip by the extremely low number of google results . 
  there 's a rosetta stone navajo course . 
  could you please explain the division of labor comment ? 
  i always thought division of labor was essential to communism , or any sort of large-scale , connected society . 
  i 've never struggled as much with spanish as here in granada . 
  it 's true that some people try to speak more `` standard '' for foreigners , but even then do n't expect to hear many `` s '' sounds . 
  it took me a few months ( b2 in las before coming ) before i could understand most granadin@s talking among themselves . 
  old working class men still might as well be speaking swahili , though . 
  all that to say good luck , and the only andal\u00fa resources i can think of that have n't already been mentioned is mala rodr\u00edguez , who sings in dialect . 
  it 's not really my thing , but you might like it . 
  no one here has mentioned the occasional lack of distinction between l and r here , e.g. 
  granada is a fun city , enjoy yourself !, 
  '' / l / may be pronounced as / r / in syllable-final position , as in [ \u02c8arma ] instead of [ \u02c8alma ] for alma ( ` soul ' ) or [ e\u031er ] instead of [ e\u031el ] for el ( ` the ' ) . 
  the opposite may also happen ; i.e. 
  / r / becomes / l / ( e.g. 
  sart\u00e9n [ sal\u02c8t\u1ebd\u031e ] ` frying pan ' ) . '', 
  from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/andalusian_spanish . 
  also , i 've heard veld\u00e1 too many times to think it 's a fluke . 
  sequence of tenses . 
  jodie foster is so fluent in french that she dubs her own movies . 
  today i learn ** ed ** jodie foster ** was ** so fluent in french that she dub ** bed ** her own movies . 
  yeah . 
  people argue about when backshifting is appropriate and when not , but they 're both pretty common and make sense . 
  i would have phrased it like op , but i would n't call what you wrote wrong , either . 
  english is already the most common second language in the world . 
  it has 430 million l2 speakers . 
  spanish is the second most common language in the world by number of native speakers . 
  it has 406 million native speakers . 
  i 'd like to meet a pie native speaker . 
  then we could once and for all figure out the phonetic values of those pesky laryngeals . 
   everybody else might as well learn english . 
  source on time needed to learn one versus the other ? 
  for anyone else who would have had to google it , * a la carte * dining is ordering from a menu . 
  if you 're saying fully fluent = interpreter good or c2 + , i 'd say that seems pretty reasonable . 
  to answer your question about the downvotes , i think it 's just because you gave a number and no more info or explanation . 
  being a french teacher , i assume you 've seen [ this ] ( http://www.newrepublic.com/article/116443/new-york-citys-french-dual-language-programs-are-mostly-pointless ) . 
  i do n't agree with all of it , but french is spoken by some 12 million people in the americas , mostly in canada . 
  the average american ( us ) will never use it and hardly ever be exposed to it unless they go to europe or parts of africa . 
  spanish is more popular for obvious reasons . 
  so if you 're going to pick a language that 's mostly useful across an ocean , why not go big ? 
  the perceived economic opportunities ( which is what most people care about , for better or worse ) of languages like chinese or arabic , among others , are pretty appealing . 
  the only advantage french has is that it 's easier for us . 
  the most surprising of all is that portuguese is n't even close to competing with french at this point , when geography and economy would make me expect otherwise . 
  my college discontinued its german major while i was there . 
  i think it 's sad because they cut from 5 languages to 4 , but if it eventually gets replaced by another fifth language , i ca n't really complain . 
  there 's a reason so few people in the us are studying german . 
  the way interest in french is going , i would n't be surprised if it 's facing the same kind of large scale cuts in 30 years that german is getting now .
