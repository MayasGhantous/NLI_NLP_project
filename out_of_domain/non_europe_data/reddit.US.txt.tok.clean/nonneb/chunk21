  also , if you said where you were from or a culture you wish you liked , we might could help more . 
  without more specific info , etcomro 's answer is about as good as it gets as far as advice goes . 
  i really wish there were groups advocating for sovereignty/autonomy who were n't religious fundamentalists or racists . 
  it scares me that wanting a country that represents our culture , our economy , and our people puts me in the same category as these people . 
  asiatorrents.me has subs and all the episodes with plenty of seeders . 
  search for `` bu bu jing xin '' , there are some subs in the comments . 
  ( if you need an invite , send me a pm ), 
  [ here you go ] ( http://rutracker.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=3188382 ), 
  the audio does n't match the pdf version i see most often on the internet , so [ here ] ( http://rutracker.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=3160569 ) are the matching books . 
  you might can find them easier somewhere else , but that 's where i downloaded mine from . 
  since i 'm working by myself it might take a while , so i think the easiest thing to do is wait 'til i finish and then upload a torrent somewhere . 
  assuming that 's legal , i 'll post it here , too . 
  since there seems to be no distribution outside of china , i 'm guessing the legality is kind of a gray area . 
  sorry , i have n't :(, 
  if there are no seeders , send me a pm and i 'll do it . 
  i think you need to sign up , but it 's free and you do n't need an invitation . 
  this is something that happens naturally with time . 
  as my german friends got to know me , and as my language ability gradually expanded outside `` practical matters '' , they started to occasionally tell me things like `` you 're not the kind of person who says stuff like [ xyz ] . '', 
  also , like in your native language , your personality and the way you talk are heavily influenced by who you 're around and what you expose yourself to . 
  it reminds me a little of the teenage years where you 're trying to sort out who you really are , except i already have an identity now so it does n't stress me out so much . 
  i 'm also in a cross-language relationship , and while your concern is n't unreasonable , i would n't worry about it , especially if your so already knows your `` native '' personality . 
  my so and i have a few unwritten rules , e.g. 
  if you need to tell someone something that could hurt their feelings , do it in english . 
  we 're both more direct and a little less polite in german than in english ( she learned english in the southern us , and her english personality shows it ) . 
  plus , chances are your l2 personality wo n't be all that different , and if it is , it 'll be more like your so and your/their friends . 
   but given the american propensity to anglicise french loan words, 
  i 'm trying to find some articles on this phenomenon , but i 'm having trouble . 
  do you happen to know of any comparing anglicization of french loan words in the us vs. uk ? 
  his amerikan version sounded decidedly not amerikan , though . 
  i also think most people i know would pronounce kah-drey , not kah-drey . 
  i finished [ disclosed ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/disclosed ) not that long ago and really enjoyed it . 
  all the versions i 've seen are chinese and english hardsubs , which i think is pretty normal for singaporean tv . 
  how is readlang better than lwt ? 
  lwt seems to have a lot more functionality for keeping track of words and reading with audio , and all for free . 
  i also do n't see why looking up words on the fly is difficult . 
  click on a word -  dictionary in a subwindow . 
  i 'd just read through and not worry about the new words . 
  if anything , spend a couple of minutes reading a chapter in english before you read the same in french . 
  it 'll help you pick up on some of the key words without having to wade through the book with a dictionary . 
  `` y' all were '' just sounds like an educated southerner talking to an outsider to me , or maybe just in a more formal context . 
  when i was in college , `` y' all were '' was most common , but at home , both `` y' all was '' and `` y' all were '' seem appropriate sometimes . 
  ( similar situation with you was/were or they was/were for me . 
  it all depends on who i 'm talking to . ), 
  thinking about your response , does that imply that you do n't have an `` intermediate '' way of speaking between the standard and your `` y' all was '' dialect , where you say y' all but keep sv agreement ? 
  i think [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/27fhpr/i_love_learning_languages_and_i_really_want_to/ci0lg1i ) is more of an `` app '' comparison . 
  nah , it 's not just english speakers . 
  a good many spanish speaking countries use a `` how are you ? '', 
  question as a matter of ritual as well . 
  parts of china use `` have you eaten ? '', 
  the same way . 
  but yeah , ritualized `` how are you ? '', 
  type questions can be really frustrating , especially when i really want to know how someone is . 
  `` how are you ? '', 
  fine , and you ? 
  `` great thanks . 
  so how 's it going ? '', 
  that all seems very complicated . 
  front : [ sentence in japanese , with portion clozed out ], 
  back : [ sentence in japanese , with clozed portion revealed ] [ audio ], 
  no furigana , no pronunciation , no english , no gloss . 
  i 've been doing this from day 1 , so i think being a beginner is irrelevant . 
  i know chinese , though , which helps me with the kanji . 
  but i do think the screenshots are a good idea . 
  i generally do n't do cloze cards from tv shows , but i 'll remember that in the future . 
  from the example you gave , i would n't like that card because it does n't have enough context for me to remember what i need to say . 
  have you considered putting in multiple lines of dialogue ? 
  usually someone from the united states . 
  universalove has a whole bunch of languages , five or six , i think . 
  french , portuguese , english , japanese , some slavic language ( serbian , i think ) , and a language that sounds like german and i can half understand , but is n't actually german . 
  it 's a really enjoyable movie with a good soundtrack . 
  zombie brother \uff08 \u5c38\u5144 \uff09 is great and i have n't seen it anywhere outside of chinese language video sites . 
  i 've actually forced some non-chinese speaking friends to watch it with me because i think it 's so good . 
  it 's a refreshing take on the zombie genre , and i like the animation style too . 
  i 've had this problem with chinese and a couple of other languages with unusual characters . 
  i went to control panel -  clock , language , and region -  region and language -  administrative ( tab ) . 
  change the language for non-unicode programs to chinese and the subs should work . 
  make sure your font settings in vlc are set up , too . 
  i 've never seen them listed as the same language , and they 're most certainly not the same . 
  not even the same language family . 
  i used two beginner textbooks , one happened to be simplified , one traditional . 
  i did the simplified first , traditional second . 
  it 's really not that big of a deal . 
  if you land on your face , it 'll be because of the characters in general , not because of the simp/trad differences . 
  while i enjoyed that show too , it would be one of the first shows that comes to mind when i think `` overacted . '', 
  it 's not that difficult . 
  if you know 750-1000 , you 'll probably recognize 600 + ( hopefully someone else knows exactly what percentage simplifications were regular ) within a few days of seeing the traditional characters and figuring out how they were changed into simplified . 
  there are some traditional characters that are n't obvious if you know simplified , but they 're a minority . 
  i would pretty much always recommend learning the dialect you 're exposed to the most , which for you would be belgian french . 
  people will appreciate it and it 's very awkward to purposefully try to pronounce things differently than the people around you . 
  but then again , i learn a lot by mimicking , so maybe that 's not as big of a deal for other people . 
  i think it mostly depends on your preferences though . 
  how 's your accent in dutch ? 
  can people identify where you 're from when you talk or do you sound like a newscaster ? 
  how do you want to sound in french ? 
  is it more important to sound educated/neutral or to sound like your neighbors ? 
  how does it not follow it 's own rules ? 
  english uses the oblique case for naming people . 
  that 's him . 
  it 's me . 
  i 've taught efl in an environment where about half the students were functionally illiterate , though the first language was spanish .
