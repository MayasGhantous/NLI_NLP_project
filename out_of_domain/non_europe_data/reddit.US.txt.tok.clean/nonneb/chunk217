  one sentence at a time . 
  one sound at a time at the beginning . 
  audacity is a good program for this . 
  start short . 
  your problem letters as an english speaker will probably be w ** a ** s h ** a ** st d ** u ** gem ** ach ** t. three sounds to work on : a , u , and ch ( ach-laut ) . 
  after you can pronounce the sentence like your audio sample , move on to another sentence . 
  eh , i always had a better time in toronto and can more easily imagine myself living there , but chicago is nice too . 
  what makes you like chicago more than toronto , just curious ? 
  you are n't practicing listening that way , but it wo n't kill you as long as you 're getting plenty of listening practice elsewhere , which you should be doing anyways . 
  if you 're learning chinese and this kind of thing bothers you , you 're going to have a bad time . 
  i do n't blame you . 
  i would love to commiserate , but i made myself stop because i end up on their level far too quickly . 
  my chinese has been on maintenance for two years because at a certain point , i just got fed up with it . 
  hsk5 is enough for the odd cases three times a year i need to use it for something . 
  i finally had to be real with myself , `` why do i willingly subject myself to this ? '', 
  you can argue the details but [ this chart ] ( http://www.atlasandboots.com/foreign-service-institute-language-difficulty/ ) is pretty accurate . 
  esperanto would likely be easier than any of these if you 're not opposed to learning a constructed language . 
   a more relaxed pace of living, 
  of all the stereotypes i 've heard , that 's a new one . 
  there are parts of europe that i think are comparable to the us in terms of pace of living , but especially as you move north things get neurotic very quickly in a way i 've never come close to experiencing in the us . 
  then again , i 've never lived outside the south . 
  where i live was built in the 1200s . 
  it 's pretty cool , but again , do n't get why certain americans idealize it so much . 
  i 've got a shitter and a kitchen like everyone else . 
  there are definitely cool parts , but they do n't apply to things most people see in europe . 
  i also have a moat , which is pretty cool . 
  the fire pit has been used for millennia and used to be a pagan shrine to a local god , where you made sacrifices by drinking beer and cooking meat , like me and the neighbors still do when the weather is good and will probably continue being done hundreds of years from now . 
   much worse standards of living on the whole, 
  i live one of the poorest parts of germany and i 'm having trouble coming up with any metric that would be true by . 
  how do you figure ? 
  they 're all probably related . 
  kieken is the low german equivalent . 
  lots of good advice here , but i found the news way more difficult to understand than youtubers and stuff like that . 
  the news has lots of vocab that does n't come up too much in casual speech . 
  i went to college for free , drive old cars and never bought a house . 
  i 'm over thirty , debt-free , and will probably remain that way barring some catastrophe . 
  that said , i think this is unusual for americans . 
  it feels unusual , at least . 
  not unheard of , but not the norm . 
  i was raised in a house that thought usury was wrong and taught me to save up for things i wanted , plus i had the opportunity to get my education paid for . 
  i also recognize that the american `` buy a house '' mantra is not nearly as universally applicable as a lot of americans make it out to be . 
  sometimes renting makes more economic sense . 
  i 'm not super rich , but i 'm educated , self-employed , and not a dumb-ass with money . 
  it 's possible in certain circumstances . 
  * german philosophy and politics * by john dewey is a bit dated , but it rings true today as much as it did before wwi and wwii . 
   relaxed and confident presence, 
  i seriously ca n't tell if you 're being facetious or not . 
  relaxed ? 
  confident ? 
  frantic and perpetually insecure even in undeniable and certain success is more like it . 
  i thought nothing to envy was a bunch of rubbish with good info riddled by the author 's completely unfounded musings and opinions , so you may not find my advice particularly useful . 
  i still think dewey 's work is required reading for people interested in german culture , though . 
  this is a different representation of the data . 
  it 's all still inflation , just that the rate of inflation has dropped a bit , and my key concern ( you can do less with a dollar ) is in no way contradicted . 
  be careful conflating class , racial , or regional motivations with personal motivations . 
  the confederacy was racist , but it does n't automatically follow that every confederate was racist . 
  china . 
  constant staring , people taking pictures of you with and without your permission . 
  i had people come up and physically grab me and turn me around for pictures . 
  but mostly just staring and people pointing and saying laowai . 
  as someone else pointed out , germans are also professional starers , but the difference is that germans have no particular reason to stare at me specifically . 
  they just stare at everybody . 
  in china , being a tall , hairy bruce-lee 's - final-boss-looking brute with big , round eyes is enough to keep attention anywhere outside of big cities and tourist spots . 
  the standard language of taiwan is mandarin chinese , as well . 
  you will be able to understand people fine . 
  it 's just a slightly different accent and a different writing system . 
  there are also regional languages in taiwan and the prc which are not mandarin . 
  the most common of these languages in taiwan is often called taiwanese , but it 's not the standard language . 
  it 's not common to encounter young monolinguals , but you may not understand people from certain areas speaking to each other . 
  that 's true in the prc and taiwan . 
  it works the other way too , though . 
  i 'm not surprised . 
  there are some vocab and slang differences , a couple of consonants and tones sound funny , but it 's not that big of a deal . 
  edit : thought this was a different comment , sorry . 
  i learned simplified and picked up traditional just by watching some tv . 
  it 's not a big deal either way . 
  there are only a handful that are completely different . 
  unless you prefer to learn the most commonly used system , the one that 's easier to handwrite , the one that 's easier to read on small screens , etc. 
  it 's just a preference thing . 
  radical middle . 
  a bit of marxist analysis here , some right-wing solutions when relevant , or left-wing , whatever works in the specific case , and a firmly producerist/populist economic outlook . 
  nothing to do with centrism , which i see as being in direct opposition to the interests of the people . 
  i 'm not judging anyone . 
  people from both sides of this non-issue , learners and natives alike , like to think the way they did it is better or easier . 
  it 's not a big deal either way . 
  he just meant that we should call him whatever gets him convicted the fastest . 
  it 's not exactly beautiful prose , but i do n't necessarily have a huge problem with it either . 
  the guy 's a criminal and a disgrace under any name . 
  the inability of people from the prc to read traditional characters is much more easily explained by the same forces that allow brits and aussies to better understand american english compared to the other way around . 
  chinese ( prc ) people will see traditional at the ktv and on signs every once in a while . 
  the majority of chinese content from anywhere is produced in the prc , and taiwanese people have a lot more exposure to simplified characters than the other way around . 
  most people who have something to do with taiwan adapt with minimal problems , even if they learned simplified characters . 
   then why are you even replying this ? 
  everyone has a preference but you make me feel like you 're judging me, 
  because i disagree with you . 
  i do n't see any good reason to take a discussion on writing systems personally . 
  it 's certainly not personal on this end . 
  that 's how i took it at first listen . 
  i just listened again and that 's still the only interpretation that makes any sense to me in context . 
  what did you think he meant ?
