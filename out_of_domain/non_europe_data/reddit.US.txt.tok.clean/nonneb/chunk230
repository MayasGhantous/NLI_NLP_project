  classical chinese , like any written chinese language , can be written in simplified or traditional characters . 
  standard mandarin : this is what you 're learning in school . 
  cantonese : this is a different language from mandarin . 
  think french and romanian . 
   though extraordinaire seemingly always has a positive ring to it ( so using the example from the other poster `` dancer extraordinaire '' , this would always be interpreted as a very good dancer ) , whereas extraordinary can be positive or negative and is closer to ` unusual ' - e.g. 
  an ` extraordinary dancer ' could be either someone who is very good at dancing or someone who is well known for dancing , but because they do it an unconvential or displeasing way . 
  these are pretty much the opposite for me . 
  ______ extraordinaire is often used to mock people , whereas without a lot of context indicating otherwise , i 'm going to assume that extraordinary is a good thing when i hear it used to describe a person . 
  the french accents in the recordings , though . 
  i could n't handle it . 
  agreed about the extraordinarily bad and good . 
  that 's why i specified the connotations when it 's describing a person , e.g. 
  an extraordinary dancer , an extraordinary writer , etc. 
  where are you from , just curious ? 
  as an american , i 'm used to hearing extraordinaire mockingly . 
  could also be class or regional differences , but the connotation is strong enough that i 'd do a double take if i heard someone using it as a compliment . 
  the quality is of life is still way too high to see that level of unrest in the us . 
  if large sections of the population lacked access to basic supplies , we 'd see a lot more unrest in the us , too . 
  bolivarianism was heavily influenced by socialism , but it 's fair enough to say it was n't `` actually '' socialist . 
  i normally think of it as a left-nationalist cousin of democratic socialism , which is different enough from socialism to be worth separating in my opinion . 
  cuba , however , is one of the best examples of a socialist state out there . 
  how can you possibly argue that cuba has not been ( or was n't , at this point ) working towards a socialist society ? 
  of course it did n't work out exactly as planned , but if we do n't call societies striving towards socialism socialist , who is ? 
  i 've never noticed esperanto sounding like spanish , but spanish and greek sound similar because they mostly use the same sounds . 
  my mind often tries to decipher greek as spanish when i first hear it . 
  i speak esperanto . 
  it has a lot of similar words , but if i could n't understand any of it , i 'd probably think it sounded like a mix of polish and italian . 
  aside from the vocab , i do n't think it sounds particularly spanish . 
  no one in that thread asked how to say on/off . 
  on/off is not the same as turn on/turn off . 
  the answers given in the thread ( \u015dalti , mal\u015dalti ) are the most common words used to say turn on and turn off . 
  i can imagine ek/for being an appropriate translation of on/off in certain contexts , but it 's not what op was asking about , and you getting on your high horse while not answering op 's question is kind of silly . 
  i definitely encourage people not to trust what some other person says , but in this case the community was pretty much correct . 
  hey , i do n't think people should let interesting-looking people just pass by , so i would like to get to know you .

   nationalism is a disgusting thing , regardless of where it comes from . 
  nationalism has been a great tool for resisting oppressive governments . 
  let 's not throw the baby out with the bathwater just because there are some instances and places where it 's toxic . 
  everyone at my school had gotten bussed to a presentation against racial violence or something like that . 
  my parents had let me skip school because they thought it was bullshit . 
  i was hanging out playing tennis at the park . 
  a friend came back from the bathroom ( there was a tv in the building ) and told us what had happened , so me and about five other truants and homeschoolers spent a couple of hours sitting in a small building with a drink machine and a tv ( and air conditioning , thank god , it was like 90 \u00b0 f ) watching the news .

  i 'm pretty sure this is thai . 
  they keep saying falang , foreigner , and it sounds like thai , but i 'm not 100 % . 
   my county sheriff 's department was decapitated, 
  i mean , i think people , including cops , should be held accountable for crimes they 've committed , but decapitation seems a little medieval to me . 
   this is not argued by anyone . 
  [ sure it is . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/brittonicisms_in_english ) probably the most famous is mcwhorter 's assertion that do-support developed due to language contact , but the wiki article i linked mentions some other claims as well . 
  alabama to washington state by way of yellowstone and south dakota on the way back . 
  i 've also done alabama to toronto via lexington , ky. 
  i enjoy driving and riding in cars , so i probably do more road trips than average , but i do n't feel the need to ever drive through kansas again . 
  if we 're counting road trips outside the us , i did granada , spain to the north coast of poland and then down to hungary once , but that was less road trip and more living in a car for a while . 
  i 'd never heard it with egypt before , so the e really threw me off . 
  i 've always heard bumfuck , [ state ] . 
  heh , i usually have the feeling that places have been warped into some bizarre future , not the other way around . 
  i even feel that way in birmingham sometime . 
  what the hell is the summit , even ? 
  it 's like a strip mall gone terribly wrong after exposure to radiation . 
  of all the places i 've been , the only one that stands out as feeling like it was in a time warp was vidor , texas . 
  that whole area near beaumont is definitely not a place that feels futuristic , but vidor in particular is a special place . 
  it means `` hello . '', 
  also people who like being helpful , people who like languages , people who want to practice , people who like the drama that inevitably shows up ( that 's you right now ) , people who like teapots , and yes , people who have lots of time on their hands , as if that were a bad thing . 
  you just wrote what i think was intended to be an attack on ujezdzamkraby completely unrelated to anything they had said . 
  you also say your wife is mean because she wrote out clearly what she needs . 
  to echo the other commenter , you 're a douche .

  i think it 's a fine translation . 
  the german sentence itself could mean i 'm glad you 're [ killing me ] , but between the context and the intonation , i do n't think there 's too much room for ambiguity here . 
  it 's pretty common . 
  first something breaks , and you plan on fixing it , but you do n't . 
  then the condition of the car gradually deteriorates , maybe you take a couple of parts to sell or use , and eventually it 'd just be more expensive than it 's worth to fix it or sell it for scrap . 
  plus , if it 's a nice car or one you especially liked , you 're probably averse to letting it go . 
  i moved to germany with a car that could n't pass t\u00dcv , and the only reason it 's not suffering the same fate is that a nigerian guy told me he wanted it , so i just let him have it . 
  otherwise it 'd still be sitting out back , too . 
  every single one is true in some places . 
  the whole stereotype about people being dumb is misunderstood by outsiders . 
  uneducated ! = dumb , but other than that , yeah , rural alabama is probably a lot like what you think rural alabama is like . 
   if a syllable ends with r is it an ah or a hard r , and how can i tell when a syllable ends ? 
  it can be a tricky subject for natives , too . 
  is \u00fcber-all or \u00fcbe-rall ? 
  generally , though , an r at the end of a syllable is pronounced more like ah . 
  fe-ah-shte-uh , meakel ( merkel ) , gelsenkiachen , toasten ( torsten ) , etc. 
  there are accents that pronounce the r more or less like the beginning of a word , and it 's somewhat region dependent , but most newscasters do n't . 
  it 's one of my favorite major cities on the continent . 
  i 've been there a few times . 
  people are nice and polite , most of it does n't feel too cramped or dirty compared to other big cities , there 's good food , and i usually manage to find a cheap place to stay . 
  in principle yes , but like so many forms of regulation , the execution is very important and i do n't trust our government to do it in a way that does n't benefit large corporations more than it does the workers . 
  like so many issues , minimum wage being the other big one , i think a solution focusing on workers ' rights to organize would suit our culture and political climate more than direct government regulation . 
  [ synonyms rarely mean exactly the same thing . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/comments/1oyoea/is_there_such_a_thing_as_a_true_synonym/ ) in this case , i was trying to make the point that you can be formally uneducated and still be knowledgable , have good reasoning and decision-making skills , etc. 
  one of the biggest surprises to me moving away from alabama was the fact that the percentage of people who do n't have the sense god gave a billy goat seems to be pretty constant everywhere i 've lived . 
  same thing with the number of brilliant people . 
  it just tends to express itself differently . 
   we do n't even have canadian accents anymore . 
  i like toronto and all , but y' all totally have canadian accents . 
  judging by the canadians on this sub , y' all ca n't hear it , but we can . 
  at its extremes it 's stupid , but i like the general skepticism of authority .
