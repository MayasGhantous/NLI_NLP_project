  i used these books and thought they were great . 
  you can sound monotone and emotionless in chinese , too . 
  when people talk about tones in chinese , they 're talking about lexical tone , not expressiveness . 
  you speaking english in a monotone way is completely irrelevant to how well you can pronounce chinese . 
  as of 2015 , 21 % of people in germany have a migration background , which means that they 've had an ancestor who was n't german some time after 1949 . 
  i 'm not aware of any comparable statistic in the us , but germany is n't really that homogeneous . 
  [ here 's a nice graphic showing the percentage of people with migration background in different parts of germany .

  i have some older family members that say co-cola . 
  they use it to refer specifically to coca-cola , while coke is the generic term . 
  i do n't recall ever hearing co-cola as the generic term , but the word is definitely around . 
  northeast alabama , by the way . 
  i found i can limit the initial vocabulary trouble by really making sure i have a handle on the phonology . 
  my ability to acquire vocabulary quickly seems to be directly related to how little the words sound like gibberish to me . 
  i used to think it was just harder at the beginning , and there 's some truth to that , but nothing helps push past the first hurdle more than tons of listening practice .

  i 'm subscribed to just about every country subreddit i 've come across . 
  i like reading about what 's going on in other places , plus it 's a good opportunity to practice other languages . 
  pretty much anything involving telecom companies in the us is super expensive and likely poor quality . 
  i 've heard it blamed on not enough regulation ; i 've heard it blamed on not enough competition . 
  as usual , i think more competition or more regulation either one would be better than the corporatist bullshit we have now . 
  the us is n't alone in having these problems , though . 
  germany is more expensive and has worse infrastructure than most countries in europe because its telecom sector has similar issues . 
  if the rural us were well-connected i would agree with you , but it 's not really . 
  our internet penetration is n't awful considering our geography ( we 're 29th in the world ) , but it 's not enough to justify the prices . 
  it 's a factor , and i think it 's a good point , but i would n't look at it as a primary cause of the general terribleness of our telecom companies . 
  german and spanish are the only ones i speak well enough you can drop in most situations and it 's not too much of a bother for me or the other people . 
  also esperanto , but that feels like more of a hobby than a language sometimes , especially since the political leanings of esperantists have shifted in a way i find unpleasant in the last ten years . 
  my chinese is alright as long as it does n't get too technical . 
  i majored in latin and greek , and i 've gotten pretty good at reading old english since then as well . 
  for posts on reddit , i generally know enough of the romance and germanic languages to follow the conversation . 
  my current projects are russian and polish . 
  i do n't know any slavic language well , so i 've been studying those since january . 
  i can for the most part keep up with news about familiar topics in russian now . 
  i 'm subscribed to pretty much every slavic country 's subreddit , though , just because . 
  serbia and croatia are particularly entertaining , it turns out . 
  for example , saying `` if i was a billionaire ... '' instead of `` if i were a billionaire ... '' the former is generally considered acceptable in britain , but not in standard american english , even though there are a lot of people who say it . 
  it 's a big thing that has to be taught and corrected in english class , so it was confusing to see it in a book . 
  it 's very minor , just another thing that can be slightly jarring to some readers . 
  enough of those little things and people feel uncomfortable . 
   where is the yukon ? 
  i was amazed to learn , years later , that king 's cross is a real place . 
  hearing someone talking about being in king 's cross and asking `` like in harry potter ? '', 
  was not my proudest , most intelligent moment , but it happens sometimes . 
  in general , no . 
  do n't capitalize food names . 
  there is a little disagreement among style guides about whether or not you should capitalize dishes that have a proper noun in their name , but they tend to err on the side of saying do n't capitalize it . 
  short version : get a textbook with lots of audio and study every day . 
  the number one predictor for your success in language learning is how much time you spend on it . 
  it 's normal if everything feels over your head . 
  the more you learn to roll with it until you get it , the less frustrating it feels . 
  consider using spaced repetition software like anki for vocab .

  your anxiety is well-founded . 
  they will probably judge you . 
  they 're germans ; that 's what they do . 
  chances are they 'll be nice and polite about thinking they 're superior to you , though . 
  in my experience , though , foreigners ( especially anglophones ) make a way bigger deal out of their poor language skills than germans themselves do . 
  you 're just another person who speaks german poorly . 
  there are plenty of those in germany . 
  just do your best and do n't be apologetic about unless someone criticizes you . 
  upon criticism , apologize and move on . 
  keep getting better and it will happen less and less . 
  neither one really ? 
  i just thought it 'd be interesting to include canada as a point of comparison because it is a very developed country that has similar geographical concerns . 
  the napkin math is more just speculation , but that seems to be more or less this discussion is staying it . 
  the fact that we find similar issues in countries without the geographical concerns is more relevant to my point than any comparison between the us and canada . 
  i know pretty much nothing about the canadian telecom industry or how it works out for the consumer compared to the us . 
  it basically radiates from the family out . 
  i feel less american than southern , less southern than appalachian , etc. 
  alabama seems a bit arbitrary to me some times , but i do feel more alabamian than american for the most part . 
  ah , the good old pro free speech = fascist . 
  i love this line of argument . 
  eating fast in restaurants . 
  it 's true , we do , and i love it . 
  there are many better places to be than a restaurant after the food is gone . 
  to take it a step farther , the couch is usually more comfortable than the kitchen table , too . 
  top side up . 
  they smell funny if you store them upside down . 
  there 's a bigger difference between lookout mountain and anything south of gadsden ( travel time ~ 30 minutes , within one state ) than there is all the way from lookout mountain up to at least north carolina or over to rome ( georgia ) . 
  state lines do n't generally have much to do with culture . 
  i grew up with people in the nearest town telling me i sounded like i was from the mountain because of my accent . 
  i never hear a word about it driving north through appalachia , at least until kentucky or so . 
  the accent and the culture go together , for the most part . 
  i think some of this comes down to the disconnect between law and morals . 
  you can respect the rule of law , and think that snowden should be punished accordingly , but also think that he did the right thing despite its illegality . 
  i personally do n't hold this view about whistleblowers -- i 'm generally team whistleblower all the way -- but i hold comparable views on other crimes that i find morally justifiable , but recognize that it 's better that the laws are in place and enforced as they are . 
  i use the [ same script ] ( http://www.webupd8.org/2016/03/translate-any-text-you-select-on-your.html ) troy_civ does . 
  it works like a charm . 
  the verb here , was , is a form of the word be . 
  that 's a copula . 
  it does n't have an object . 
  for anyone wondering , this is the opening line of the book * neuromancer * by william gibson . 
  a copula links a subject to a predicative expression . 
  in this sentence , `` the sky '' is the subject , `` was '' is the verb , and `` the color of television '' is the predicative expression .
