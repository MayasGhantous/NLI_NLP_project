  page 424 has the sources he used to make his own estimate . 
  they are all lower than his own , and he offers no precise explanation of how he came up with the numbers he did . 
  most sources , as shown in the book , put the number significantly lower . 
  i 'd trust ethnologue or the british council over crystal 's estimate . 
  the british council 's numbers match ammon 's from your first link : about 1 billion learners of english , many of whom never achieve any kind of useful proficiency in the language . 
   wow , you mean that when people are no longer afraid that they 'll be imprisoned or killed for being gay , they no longer hide in the shadows ? 
  now that we can get married , we 're getting married , and in public ? 
  greeks were in no way hiding in the shadows . 
   gay people have always existed , and we 've adapted to be invisible throughout most of history , out of necessity . 
  i do n't think they have , because i think gayness is a social construct . 
  people have been having gay sex for a long time . 
  in some places more , in some places less . 
  sometimes it was acceptable , sometimes it was n't . 
  people 's sexuality can change over the course of their life , or from one situation to another . 
  gayness is the way our society has compartmentalized a behavior that goes against its ( recent ) sexual mores and the way those labeled have such have made sense of their incompatibility with those sexual mores . 
  so in that sense , gay people today are different . 
  gay people are n't a threat to humanity 's reproductive capacity at the moment . 
  i agree it 's a weird thing to worry about . 
  there are much more pressing issues driving down birth rates at the moment . 
  that 's also from david crystal . 
  the reasons i did n't like his last estimate still apply . 
  latin was offered in my high school until the teacher retired the year i got there . 
  i did n't study it then , but i went on to study latin in college and a good portion of the students had had some latin in high school . 
  i personally like pulled pork with a kind of spicy sauce , but basically any kind of barbecue style from east of the mississippi that uses pork is pretty good . 
  the vinegar sauces are nice for some variety sometimes . 
  i ca n't really get behind the chicken barbecue they do in parts of alabama , though . 
  it 's not bad , it just does n't really register as barbecue to me . 
  the only kind of barbecue i actively dislike is texas style barbecue . 
  it tastes like nothing to me . 
  i lived in texas for a few years and never had a plate of barbecue i wanted to finish . 
  the dry meat with no sauce or a sauce that might as well be ketchup does n't do it for me . 
  four adults involved : a , b , c , and d. 
  you are the child of a and b. 
  your half-brother is the child of a and c. your half-sister is the child of b and d. would that still be a taboo relationship ? 
  i 'd say it depends on the living situation , but it does n't seem worthy of a wtf to me . 
  werde/wirst/wird / werden/werdet is used for things in the present . 
  wurde/wurdest/wurden / wurdet is for the past . 
  let 's look at your example . 
  i think the root of the problem here is that the sentence does n't look passive . 
  kirmes 's corrections are all active , because that 's the only way to make this sentence work with ich ... das buch ... a passive sentence puts the object of the action first . 
  present active : i buy the book . 
  present passive : the book is bought . 
  past active : i bought the book . 
  past passive . 
  the book was bought . 
  present active : i eat the apple . 
  present passive : the apple is eaten . 
  past active : i ate the apple . 
  past passive : the apple was eaten . 
  past passive : _____________________, 
  the sentences are contrived , but for getting the gist of how to form the passive they 're hopefully passable . 
  see you again in the real north . 
  i had no contempt for coastal america before i finished college and moved out of the south . 
  to be honest i thought it was a little ridiculous . 
  how different can we be ? 
  now at any point in time about two smug comments away from being a full-blown secessionist . 
  of course i have my own opinions on it , but by far my strongest opinion is that it 's not my or our business and they need to work it out themselves . 
  i went to really small schools and a had a few part time teachers , mostly in high school . 
  the advanced math teacher , for example , was part time . 
  she only had a few classes a day . 
  i ca n't really answer your question , just wanted to add that part time teachers do exist in the us as well . 
  you know how in english , you sometimes say `` it '' even though there is n't really an `` it ? '', 
  it 's raining . 
  there is no it , it 's just a dummy subject because english sentences need a subject . 
  well , german sentences sometimes need dummy objects . 
  this is one of the more common patterns where they 're necessary . 
  i do n't know all the examples and rules , but just be aware that dummy objects exist , be on the lookout for them , and you 'll get the hang of it eventually . 
  should n't be a problem . 
  there 's a train from the signal iduna park train station to dortmund hbf at 23:34 , dortmund to essen 23:45 , and then essen to cologne at 00:48 arriving at 02:23 . 
  or easier , you can take a train from dortmund hbf to cologne at 01:44 , arriving at 3:02 . 
  dortmund hbf to essen at 23:53 then essen to cologne at 00:48 arriving at 02:23 is also an option . 
  the db navigator app is your friend . 
  in any case , it seems like there are plenty of late trains . 
  my experience has been the opposite . 
  i find europeans ( lived in three countries , but only germany longterm ) unfriendly and unwilling to make small talk . 
  they are social with their friends , but it takes about two years to get to know a german as well as the average person in line behind me at the dollar general in the us . 
  europe has a very big distinction between how they treat friends and strangers that we just do n't . 
  some americans do feel an obligation to remove trump from power . 
  some people like him or disagree with the things you think are clear . 
  i personally think he 's more of the same , just more of an asshole on a personal level . 
   did n't even win the popular vote, 
  we do n't elect presidents by popular vote . 
  that 's probably a factor in why he 's not more widely viewed as illegitimate . 
  the top 5 picks are generally to the weakest teams . 
  of course they do n't win that much .

  episodes v and vi i 'm are translations of the english novelizations by donald f. glut and james kahn respectively . 
  the episode iv book credits george lucas on both the english and german covers , but since that book is the same series as the others , i 'm pretty sure it 's the novelization that was ghostwritten by alan dean foster . 
   i ca n't do anything about how my comments `` sound '' to other people . 
  this is * not * how americans generally approach social interactions . 
  that 's a lot of your problem here , i think . 
   doing something requires reason . 
  not doing something often does n't . 
  it 's simple factual statement . 
  doing something does n't require a reason . 
  not doing something often does . 
  my statement does n't seem like less of a fact than yours . 
  as another commenter said , `` that 's just , like , your opinion , man . '',
