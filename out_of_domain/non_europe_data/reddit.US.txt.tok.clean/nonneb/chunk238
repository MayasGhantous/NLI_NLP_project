  this works , but there are more efficient ways to go about it . 
  this method includes no intensive listening , which slows it down significantly , and mining your own sentences takes up a lot of time . 
  proponents argue that mining the sentences is part of the learning process , and it is , but the copying , pasting , and finding sentences that you can understand as a beginner all take time that could be spent doing something that involves more practice as well . 
  why bother explaining this method at all , if it 's so inefficient ? 
  for one , some people legitimately like learning this way . 
  a learning strategy you enjoy will work better for you than a learning strategy you do n't . 
  secondly , the core concept is sound , and there are very good ways to adapt and combine this method with other methods to make it work . 
  instead of explicitly studying grammar , you 're learning sentence templates that you can swap around to produce the sentences you want . 
  pulling sentences from textbooks and putting them into flashcards is much quicker provides sentences that progress from easier to harder . 
  cut up your book 's audio files and put them on the flashcard using a tool like anki ( front : audio \u2192 back : l2 and english ( l1 ) ) , and then you get intensive listening practice at the same time . 
  if you are learning a language with a difficult script like chinese and japanese , having two separate cards , one with the written sentence on the front and one with the audio on the front , is an effective strategy . 
  shadow the audio when the flashcard comes up , and you 've got pronunciation practice as well . 
  add some cloze deletion cards for unknown words , and you train your active recall . 
  like with any method , you still need to supplement with lots of practice activities , but that 's a method that can hold its own with any of the others on this list . 
  ( note : this is my personal favorite method for difficult languages ), 
  you can also combine this idea with subs2srs , a program that makes audio or even video flashcards from movie files and their corresponding english ( l1 ) and l2 subtitle files . 
  explaining how to use subs2srs is outside the scope of this guide , but the end result is that you can make thousands of audio flashcards from your favorite movies without having to cut up or type out the cards yourself . 
  a discussion of 10k would n't be complete without discussing glossika 's take on the method . 
  glossika does n't offer more than 6000 sentences for any language , but the principle is the same . 
  it includes the sentences , progressing from less to more difficult ; audio files which are great for shadowing ; plus pronunciation guides in ipa . 
  it 's a good compromise between 10k and assimil-style shadowing . 
  it is , like its uncle 10k , more comprehensive and will take you to a higher level than assimil , but it has no grammar notes or explanations and requires a good bit more autonomy on the learner 's part . 
  * remains effective into intermediate and advanced levels, 
  * content interesting to you ( from sentence mining or subs2srs ), 
  * highly adaptable . 
  the principle that knowing a lot of sentences means knowing a lot of vocab and grammar generally works and can be combined with other methods . 
  * free ( except glossika or buying movies especially for that purpose ), 
  cons :, 
  * glossika and movies cost money, 
  * difficult to execute correctly . 
  not as difficult as lr , but you can slow down your learning a lot trying to figure out how to effectively mine sentences and set up flashcards, 
  * overkill for easier languages . 
  you probably do n't need 10,000 sentences to start engaging with native material in spanish . 
  10k is a better choice for more difficult languages . 
  * does not necessarily provide as much practice as other learning strategies ( though it can be modified to mitigate this disadvantage , or you can just spend more time doing practice activities ),

  grammar translation, 
  this was the go-to method for teaching europe 's literate classes for centuries , possibly longer . 
  it 's not that popular these days , but it still works , even if it 's a bit dry and inefficient . 
  the grammar translation method treats language as a sum of its vocabulary and grammar . 
  if you know the vocab and the grammar , you should be able to put together a sentence . 
  it does n't necessarily include any listening or pronunciation practice , which means there are n't many opportunities to make the language automatic , which is probably your goal . 
  nobody wants to sit around and flip through declension charts and vocabulary lists in their head to be able to understand or make a sentence . 
  and when you try to produce sentences , they 're going to sound like early iterations of machine translators , when they went word by word . 
  nobody wants that , except classics majors and other people learning languages for purely academic purposes . 
  if your only goal is reading , you can learn to translate fast enough to understand what you need to read , and eventually the reading will become automatic . 
  it 's effective because you can more or less entirely skip the practice activities outlined below . 
  sure , you may go your whole career and never be able to string together two sentences in latin , but you can read it , and that 's what you want . 
  good examples of books which still rely mostly on this method are hansen and quinn 's greek : an intensive course and wheelock 's latin . 
  elements of grammar translation are found in more modern courses focused on modern , spoken languages , as well . 
  the learning in everyone 's favorite language app , duolingo , is still fundamentally the grammar translation method at its core . 
  learn vocab , learn grammar , put it together like a puzzle . 
  duolingo has made some changes like including audio , and its grammar instruction is more explicit in some courses than others . 
  * you do n't have to bother practicing speaking , listening , or writing . 
  cons, 
  * no practice, 
  * pretty much everything else, 
  teachers, 
  i 'm going to keep this segment short , because there 's not shortage of places to read about how to learn a language from other people . 
  i 'm lumping everything that involves another human being teaching you something into this category . 
  the most straightforward way to learn from a teacher is to hire a teacher . 
  find one you like , and do n't be afraid to tell them what you want and why you 're learning . 
  if they are n't being responsive to your goals , pick a different teacher . 
  cons : it costs money , and the teacher may not be good . 
  you could also try to do a language exchange . 
  the first problem with this is that it 's a little inefficient , because you have to spend half your time helping them . 
  if you enjoy that , then it 's not an issue . 
  the second problem is that even well-meaning native speakers are n't necessarily good teachers . 
  it will probably work if they 're patient and willing to try , though . 
  humans are shockingly good at communicating when they want to , even if they do n't share a language at all . 
  how efficient this method will be depends a lot on you and the dice roll that is finding a good language partner . 
  getting unsuspecting natives to teach you can work , as well . 
  the actual learning of vocab and grammar comes mostly from attentively listening to other people and getting things from context . 
  to give an actionable example , if you find ordering stuff at the bakery very confusing in germany , stumble through ordering a coffee , sit near the counter , and listen to people order until you figure out what questions the bakers ask and how people respond . 
  keep in mind , though , that this only works if you know a few words already , or there are plenty of cognates in every day vocabulary . 
  this would be much less effective or more difficult as a true beginner in vietnam . 
  i know i 'm not doing justice to these methods , but it 's easy enough to google . 
  any kind of two-way interaction with other human beings is going to be practice , and there 's usually enough context that you learn new things too . 
  the only other warning i have is to pay attention to whether you 're actually learning new things , or just practicing what you know . 
  do too little of either and you 're likely to stagnate . 
  ** supplemental exercises **, 
  ** for vocab **, 
  sometimes , your lack of vocab is what 's holding you back more than anything else . 
  when that happens , you need to give your vocabulary a boost . 
  ideally , you 're learning most of your vocabulary through your learning strategies or practice activities , but sometimes , for whatever reason , you just feel like you do n't know any words . 
  there are a few ways to remedy that .

  flash cards, 
  put l1 on one side , l2 on the other . 
  some kind of spaced repetition system makes this much more efficient . 
  you can build your own flashcards or download premade decks in anki , or use some of the courses on memrise . 
  clozemaster is a new option that functions like flashcards , but uses cloze deletion . 
  the big advantage there is that you see the word in context . 
  word lists, 
  i 'm addicted to screens , so i 've never personally used wordlists and do n't feel qualified to talk about them . 
  some people swear by them , though . 
  follow the links on this page to learn more about it . 
  ** for pronunciation : **, 
  for getting native-like intonation , shadowing is one of the best techniques out there . 
  your textbook , audiobooks , whatever you can find , shadow it .
