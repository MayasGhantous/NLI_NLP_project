  hypothetically you could recreate that outside of the country in which the language is spoken . 
  google it or search on this forum . 
  i say get a book with lots of audio and start studying , then start watching lots of tv , listening to audiobooks , and talking to people . 
  whatever you choose to do , it mostly comes down to spending a lot of time learning however you learn and practice , practice , practice . 
  it depends on how fast you want to learn . 
  more is better . 
  if you get burned out , tone it down a bit . 
  you do n't have to take courses anywhere if you do n't want to , but some people find it easier to stay motivated with structure and a class environment . 
  yes , but you can generally get back up to speed pretty quickly . 
  it really has very little to do with how many you know , though . 
  it has to do with how often you use them . 
  people can get rusty in their native languages if they do n't have anyone to talk to for years . 
  it gets easier after you 've learned one . 
  starting to learn one does n't really help at all . 
  it depends . 
  actually , no it does n't . 
  it sounds kind of stupid , honestly . 
  not that it 's necessarily impossible , but lots of people like the idea of knowing lots of languages and relatively few enjoy studying enough to be able to speak more than one or two . 
  maybe you 're the .5 % and my doubt is misplaced . 
  i used the course `` el nuevo portugu\u00e9s sin esfuerzo '' from assimil and found it very good . 
  what !? 
  you learned to speak mandarin faster than german ? 
  i 'd say it takes me about three times as long to get to the same level in mandarin as german . 
  mandarin vocab is harder , grammar is harder , pronunciation is harder . 
  i literally ca n't think of anything easier about studying mandarin besides morphology . 
  i can read ancient greek and latin ( studied in college ) , speak english ( native ) , german ( language-in-law ) , and spanish . 
  i can also get along with simple situations in chinese and hungarian , which i 'm still actively studying . 
  try tiger cubs ( \u98db\u864e ) . 
  i 'm generally do n't get into hk series that much , but i like this one . 
  i 'm not sure if there 's a place to watch it online ( did n't check ) , but i downloaded mine by torrent . 
  check out `` dirty chinese : everyday slang from what 's up to f * % # off ! '', 
  you can also download an epub . 
  i 'm really happy for you and baron_bill , but i ca n't really imagine it for myself . 
  grammar to me is probably the hardest part of learning chinese . 
  i was probably a year or more into studying before i could consistently put together something resembling grammatically correct sentences that were more than svo . 
  sure , learning characters and vocab is more time-consuming , but memorizing is n't much of a brain strain . 
  here 's where i 'm coming from :, 
  i think sometimes people confuse grammar with just conjugations and declensions . 
  chinese has a rigid word order that is different from english in all but the simplest of sentences . 
  it 's pretty rigidly left-branching ( which is one of the hardest things for me to get used to speaking a foreign language ) , has classifiers ( which for a learner is more or less a gender system from hell ) , and different lexical categories . 
  all in all , chinese grammar might be typologically similar to english , but i do n't think they do n't have much in common for the learner . 
  you can hardly say anything like you would in english . 
  with german , on the other hand , i can memorize a few declensions and conjugations , put  2nd verbs at the end of a sentence , put all verbs at the end of a dependent clause , and i 'm very understandable if i fill in the rest with english grammar . 
  naturally there are a few other quirks for the learner to figure out ( v2 word order when it 's not like english , adverb placement , learning which cases go with which verbs/prepositions , etc. 
  ) , but none of it inhibits intelligibility all that much . 
  i 'm not trying to say that chinese grammar is the hardest or anything . 
  for an english speaker , i 'd probably put it more difficult than most ie languages but easier than most others . 
  i 'm just always surprised to hear people thinking it 's easier . 
  if you have n't already , check out k\u00e9k r\u00f3zsa ( blue rose ) and see if it 's what you 're looking for . 
  it 's actually the only hungarian restaurant i 've eaten at in budapest so i ca n't compare with others , but i thought the food was good and the prices were fair . 
  for those like me who are lazy and do n't like googling things , here 's a qq link to the first episode . 
  there 's a link on there to the second episode , too . 
  yeah , their problem is that instead of saying `` i have a standard accent '' , you said `` i have no accent '' , and on reddit it 's important to be technically correct . 
  of course it makes no sense to someone who understands what an accent is . 
  the thing is , most people have n't done linguistics 101 , and when they say no accent , they mean they have what they perceive as a neutral/standard accent . 
  you 're completely right , and protocol 's response was also in order . 
  the poster ( now deleted ) just seemed to not get what protocol_7 was trying to say . 
  maybe we just have different ideas about what technically correct is . 
  conforming to the scientific usage of a word over its common usage seems technical to me . 
  a manta-driver stopped at the curb and asked a passing turk :, 
  `` hey man , how do you get to ( nach ) aldi ? 
  the turk replied of course : `` to ( zu ) aldi . '', 
  the manta driver said : `` but it 's only 8 o'clock ! '', 
  zu can mean `` to '' or `` closed '' in english . 
  the turk , who of course speaks more proper german than manta driver , corrected the manta driver 's nonstandard use of the word `` nach . '', 
  but the manta driver thought he was saying that aldi was already closed . 
   korean after all has an alphabet and that 's considered equally ( or even more so depending on who you ask ) difficult . 
  korean the language is considered as or more difficult than japanese . 
  no one is saying hangul is difficult . 
  that was my first post in the thread , i was just quoting op to try to explain the problem . 
  let 's try this again . 
   korean after all has an alphabet and *** that *** 's considered equally ( or even more so depending on who you ask ) difficult . 
  i 'll rewrite , replacing the demonstrative pronoun for clarity . 
   korean after all has an alphabet and *** korean *** 's considered equally ( or even more so depending on who you ask ) difficult . 
  it 's just a pronoun with an ambiguous antecedent . 
  op probably could have made that more clear , but it 's not that hard figure out what they meant from context . 
  yes . 
  i say it \\ \u02c8sal-m\u0259n \\, 
  they help with grammar and vocab , pronunciation if you can include audio . 
  what i do is pretty close to what 's described [ here ] ( http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/10000-sentences-how ) , except i usually leave out the literal translation and sometimes replace or supplement pronunciation ( hiragana ) with audio . 
  there 's a big difference between not focusing on studying and not using . 
  this is a fun question so i 'll answer about learning standard english from southern/southern appalachian :, 
  past tenses . 
  is this word regular or irregular ? 
  i still have to look it up sometimes . 
  when i 'm speaking , i still mess up cost , come , and run sometimes if i 'm not paying attention . 
  borrow and lend . 
  wth is lend ? 
  borrow ( or borry ( sp ? ) ), 
  is plenty , no need to make things more complicated . 
  double modals . 
  this is the thing i 've been working on correcting most recently . 
  i did n't even realize it was nonstandard until a couple of years ago . 
  this is also the one thing that i still have trouble with even when i 'm really focusing on proper english , e.g. 
  in a job interview , but it 's getting better . 
  honorable mention : vocab or words that are pronounced noticeably different . 
  oh i completely forgot about lay/lie . 
  i know it has to do with transitivity , but i do n't know which one is which . 
  and even if i can think of the right one , i hope i only need to use it in the present tense . 
  i generally do n't worry about that one mistake too much , though , because i do n't associate it so much with my regional dialect .
