  i thoroughly enjoyed and would also recommend andrew mango 's biography for anyone who has a good bit of time on their hands . 
  you clearly do n't live in alabama/mississippi . 
  the only one not covered by our leaders is running a paramilitary organization . 
  it might be because i 'm a couple of beers down , but could you please explain a little more about how the sentence demonstrates impaired syntax ? 
  i also hear this frequently in northern alabama ( near gadsden/collinsville ), 
  ever heard of medical tourism ? 
  when i lived in merida , mexico , i met lots of u.s.ers with serious medical problems who went there because they could afford the medical care . 
  i 'm not a native german speaker , so take this with a grain of salt . 
  if you speak german well , you have no problems communicating with someone in austria . 
  the largest differences within hochdeutsch are between bavaria/austria and the rest of germany . 
  they differ primarily in accent and lexicon ( they have mostly the same words , but some words that are used all the time in austria/bavaria are not as common in , say , the ruhrgebiet or berlin ) . 
  swiss german is a whole nother language which is not mutually intelligible with standard german . 
  you will probably understand some of it , but not enough to communicate well . 
  that being said , everyone in switzerland speaks hochdeutsch too , which they use in writing and to speak to foreigners . 
  when they 're not speaking swiss german , there are hardly any differences between the language in germany and in switzerland ; they just have a cute accent . 
  to be a little more specific on how they differ in pronunciation : the r is pronounced differently in different areas of the german-speaking world , but it differs as much within germany as between countries . 
  the pronunciation of some final consonants also differs by region and accent , but that varies at least as much if not more in germany than between countries . 
  the stress and intonation of sentences is the most widely varying aspect between countries ( and bavaria ) , which usually does n't cause a lot of miscommunication . 
  edit : you could try posting this r/de for more and better responses, 
  communication between german speakers from the three countries is no problem , but people from austria talk funny . 
  also , bavarians sound like hitler . 
  most linguists say it 's another language . 
  there is a degree of mutual intelligibility , much like there is between almost all the north germanic languages . 
  it is a dialect/language in much the same way that schw\u00e4bisch , k\u00f6lsch , and luxemburgisch are dialects/languages , depending on who you ask . 
  sociopolitcally , i understand the desire to treat them as dialects of the same language , but they 're just not mutually intelligible with the german i or my ( native ) wife speak . 
  my general rule of thumb is if they have to subtitle it in standard german , it 's probably a different language , but there is a historical precedent for referring to it as a dialect as well . 
  on op 's question , it 's hard to understand , but it does n't matter because they will speak proper german with you . 
  the distinction is just not an important or exclusive one . 
  from near the beginning of the english version of the article on swiss german :, 
   unlike most regional ** languages ** in modern europe , swiss german is the spoken everyday ** language ** of all social levels in industrial cities as well as in the countryside . 
  swiss german is a dialect of german , but even languages like plattdeutsch are a part of the german dialect continuum . 
  here 's an example of the problem with making this distinction important : plattdeutsch and dutch are a part of the west german dialect continuum , but they are not a part of the high german dialect continuum . 
  dialects are always relative to other dialects and languages , and the inclusion of swiss german as a dialect does not exclude its existence as a language . 
  a quick look at the english wikipedia page of k\u00f6lsch demonstrates the interchangeable nature of the two terms . 
  the choice of whether to use dialect or language makes a ( frequently political ) statement about the nature of the language in question . 
  the german wikipedia , for example , uses exclusively the word dialekt for k\u00f6lsch . 
  the [ k\u00f6lsch ] ( http://ksh.wikipedia.org/wiki/k%c3%b6lsch_%28sprooch%29 ) language article on k\u00f6lsch , however , uses the term sprooch , as does the akademie f\u00f6r uns k\u00f6lsche sproch ( edit : forgot the billboard , `` die einzige sprache , die man auch trinken kann '' . ), 
  the german and english uses of dialect and language are usually similar , but the sociopolitcal attitudes and concerns influence the language used to refer to their own languages . 
  the unity of the german people and state has been a conscious effort throughout most of germany 's history , so vocabulary which emphasizes the connection rather than the differences is preferred . 
  the language in k\u00f6lsch itself , however , emphasizes the differences , perhaps for local pride or reaffirmation of its legitimacy and social importance/acceptance . 
  the terms in both english and german are not exclusive , and the word choice usually demonstrates the different views or perspectives the writer has . 
  edit : one of my favorite internet arguments to witness was a german linguist telling a dutch person that dutch was a german dialect . 
  ( i believe this was on www.unilang.org , but i 'm too lazy to find the link to the thread . 
  it was a couple of years ago . ), 
  the words are different , but it many cases the distinction is linguistically meaningless and politically charged . 
  edit 2 : i forgot something that happened to me yesterday that is very relevant . 
  i was filling out some paperwork , and german and swiss german were separate options for native language . 
  meh , i think the more important distinction is whether or not there is a standardized form of it . 
  but even then , if there is any kind of unsurety about whether something is a language or a dialect , both are usually true and/or acceptable . 
  that is not a good and universally applicable rule , either . 
  shanghainese is most certainly not the same language as mandarin or cantonese any more than italian is the same language as french , but it has no standard form , and books and periodicals are not published in it . 
  the chinese consider it just a dialect , but almost all western linguists will call it a language . 
  that is german . 
  the swiss write in standard german . 
  google [ medial diglossia ] ( https://www.google.com/webhp?hl=en#sclient=psy-ab&amp;hl=en&amp;site=webhp&amp;source=hp&amp;q=medial+diglossia&amp;pbx=1&amp;oq=medial+diglossia&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=g-v1&amp;aql=&amp;gs_sm=e&amp;gs_upl=1193l3576l0l3732l16l9l0l3l3l1l409l2612l0.1.3.3.2l11l0&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.cf.osb&amp;fp=9c035c39c3419f8e&amp;biw=1022&amp;bih=597 ), 
  i can believe we 're having this discussion . 
  it 's a fairly common thing to see on the internet , but not necessarily about the situation of the german languages.asking r/linguistics is a good place to get some more opinions on the subject . 
  lesson # 2 from occupy wall street : do n't look like hippies . 
  do n't confuse the left and right with american social values . 
  the amount of social liberty in a socialist state can vary , which i think is what you 're trying to say . 
  if we can appeal to the poor and working class , many of whom do n't support abortion rights or gun control , we can become the majority . 
  we can appeal to people who self-identify as on the left and on the right in the united states , because they define their political leaning by social values rather than by economic ones . 
  teacher here . 
  is there any reason you ask other than curiosity ? 
  it will never be my duty to kill people like myself for my country 's leaders . 
   why is journalism so fucking bad ? 
  ftfy, 
  older people say arse in the deep south/appalachia . 
  interesting to see how conservative the accent is . 
  i 'm melungeon , which is a comparable ethnic group , but we do n't have anything more linguistically interesting than is usual in appalachia . 
  sorry i 'm a little late to see this post . 
  this is because they are pronounced the same way . 
  `` i should 've eaten '' sounds just like `` i should of eaten , '' but , of course , the second sentence makes no sense . 
  there is nothing you can write in mandarin that can not be read by a cantonese/wu/etc . 
  the non-mandarin speakers usually write in something like mandarin and use the same characters . 
  even someone from outside the prc who does n't speak any mandarin will be able to read anything written in mandarin . 
  it is , however , possible to write something in cantonese that a mandarin speaker will not understand . 
  cantonese uses some characters that do not appear in the writing system of mandarin and other dialects , and thus will not be understood . 
  i believe it is possible to write wu , but it 's very uncommon and i do n't know anything about it , so i ca n't help there . 
  source : speak mandarin and a bit of cantonese, 
  yes . 
  the problem is that you assume they read reputably published material frequently , which most people who make this mistake do n't . 
  he wants you to put his pubicle sack in your mouth and draw succulently on it . 
  i 've never heard `` hair of the dog . '', 
  most of the time i say/hear `` hangover beer . '', 
  23 , bonn , germany . 
  i 'm not an atheist though , just a religious humanist who likes hanging around, 
  listening to americans leads me to believe quite the opposite . 
  why do you believe free speech is an inherent part of democracy ? 
  yes , this is common in aave and also in some southern dialects . 
  i would say english is more helpful in learning french than german , despite the genetic relationship . 
  this is due to the vocabulary and rather simple grammar shared by both . 
  it 's a problem of orthography , not grammar . 
  also , at your ( op 's ) level of english , people are much more likely to think that you 're lazy than that you do n't know the rule . 
  this is not confusing socialism and communism , but rather having no idea what obama is doing . 
  it 's easy , but i would n't call it indubitably the easiest at all . 
  i would argue that spanish is significantly easier to learn than dutch for an english speaker who does n't speak german . 
  it also depends on which style manual you use . 
  i learned it 's always '' 's '' unless it 's after a classical name , e.g. 
  odysseus , achilles , etc. , but i do n't think it really matters .
