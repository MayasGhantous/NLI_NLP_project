  drives me nuts when i hear myself do it . 
  it does , but in spontaneous speech , i do n't have always have time to think about how something would be spelled . 
  also , words like `` friend '' do n't make things any easier . 
  pavc taught the double \u4e86 as well , but i have never seen it outside of that textbook . 
  maybe it 's a dated construction ? 
  before a noun , it functions like an adjective in english . 
  after a noun , it still describes the noun , but it functions grammatically like a verb and can form a predicate . 
  growing up in the us , the [ redwall ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/redwall ) series is my only source of knowledge about shrews . 
  i generally pay about 1200huf a meal , 900huf for chinese , 500 for d\u00f6ner or similar . 
  a fancy tablecloth type place will run more in the 3000huf range . 
  hungarian beer costs about 200huf , more in the center of town . 
  to get imported beer at a bar in the center of town can cost up to 800huf / .5 l. 
  i guess around 300huf ? 
  it varies widely , but hungary is a wine country and it tends to be pretty cheap . 
  cake is everywhere , and it 's delicious . 
  maths is the more common word in britain and its more recent colonies . 
  the university of granada is shameful . 
  i ca n't speak for the others , but who are you hearing wonders from ? 
  what department ? 
  every person i 've known who has gone there from outside of europe has been shocked at how little work there is , how uninterested the professors are , how antiquated teaching styles are , and how insulated the academic environment seems to be from the rest of the world , probably because very few professors actually speak a foreign language . 
  throughout spain , profs are overwhelmingly chosen from the local community , which in granada means there 's not that much to choose from . 
  the humanities are outside of town because franco did n't trust them , the social sciences are run by opus dei because ( gasp ) franco did n't trust them . 
  i met a few non-europeans who enjoyed living in granada , but not a single one who had much positive to say about the university . 
  however , if op is from europe , there 's a decent chance they 'll have a better time with the school itself . 
  at least the ones i met found it pretty normal . 
  i felt like i missed out on a lot of interesting stuff going on because i had no idea what 's going on in china besides boring , biased reports from western media . 
  i learn both because they 're not that different , but generally focus more on simplified for the same reason i would focus on american english instead of british , latin american spanish instead of european , german german instead of swiss , etc. 
  more speakers usually means more stuff for me to read about , listen to , watch , or do in that variety of the language . 
  chinese is no exception . 
  i 've seen it in mainland and singaporean shows as well . 
  i 'm not sure i would trust any sources that say that . 
  the sound is / \u0288\u0361\u0282 / , not like the s in pleasure . 
  as a good rule of thumb , trust your ears over possibly patronizing or confused textbook authors . 
  adults can definitely become fluent by that definition . 
  i think there are some people who will probably always sound a bit non-native , but it 's definitely possible to master the other parts . 
  i started studying german at 21 years old and would fit your definition of fluency . 
  my knowledge of literature is pretty bad , but then again it 's not that different than most of the people i talk to in german . 
  the cultural references and tv shows everyone watched as a child are more important imo . 
  some people study for decades and never get there , but if you put yourself in the right position and put a lot of effort in , you can get there . 
  this is normal . 
  if you keep doing it , it gets better . 
  i have the same problem , and i never really break through that barrier unless i put myself in a position where i need to speak the language , or it would at least be more convenient than speaking a different one . 
   i would like to learn a language that i was exposed to as a child, 
  depending on the language , learning a heritage language can be even more difficult than if you were n't exposed to it as a child . 
  speaking a foreign language gets a certain amount of respect from those who do n't and understanding/sympathy from native speakers , unless it 's a heritage language . 
  it does n't matter if you started learning spanish at age 30 , if your last name is martinez , some people will take it for granted . 
  the problems you 're experiencing are very normal , and i think most language learners have felt the same way at some point . 
  just keep going and it gets better . 
  remind yourself why you 're learning the language , and if you need to take a break for a week , do it . 
  i find that visualizing yourself as a fluent speaker can really help with motivation and discouragement . 
  it might be frustrating now , but think about how awesome it will be in a few years . 
  keep it up !, 
  i agree , anything besides standard grammar is ambiguous and unclear . 
  that 's why i ca n't understand these sentences :, 
   what if english was not my first language ? 
   what if i was unfamiliar with southern colloquialisms ? 
  can you please clarify in standard english ? 
  after lots of thinking and research , i realized what you were trying to communicate in your primitive , nonstandard dialect . 
   what if english ** were ** not my first language ? 
   what if i ** were ** unfamiliar with southern colloquialisms ? 
  where have you been where it 's better ? 
  yes . 
  if i ** were ** confident in your ability to use the subjunctive , i would know whether it 's also your native language or not . 
  unfortunately , i only know that you have poor command of the standard language . 
  if only everything published in the public realm adhered to the rules in order to guarantee disambiguation ... 
  oh , i was expecting a story where you desperately needed to say `` the whale eats sugar '' or some asinine sentence that you would have never learned otherwise , but this is an even better story . 
  good luck on the test , op !, 
  many of the gypsies who live in romania are romanians by nationality . 
  foxlink38 is n't wrong , they 're just not separating romanians based on ethnic origin . 
  it depends on what is meant by `` really romanian '' . 
  if they are n't romanians by nationality , what are they then ? 
  making the claim that people who are n't ethnically romanian ca n't be romanian nationals is kind of like saying non-white people ca n't be american . 
  i guess you could make that case , but i do n't know how i feel about it . 
  i know here in hungary , there 's a distinction between roma and ethnic hungarians , but the roma still have hungarian nationality . 
  i felt like i was missing out on news , mostly . 
  i now know i was also missing out on lots of e-sports events and gaming culture , tv shows i like , and interesting internet trends and discussion . 
  most of the stuff i read about china in english talked about the one-child policy very dismissively , used pop historians ' completely made-up death tolls when talking about mao , and generally only talked about issues that concerned china 's relationship with the west . 
  it tends to also be nauseatingly pro hong kong and pro taiwan . 
  i do n't have anything against either of those places , but i want to hear other ideas too . 
  occasionally i run across a piece that presents a chinese viewpoint on an issue , but its an exception . 
  i 'd never run across that site before . 
  thanks !, 
  a fair number of high schools in the usa have day care centers ; it 's not just a gypsy thing . 
  a lot of good phrasebooks include responses , but almost never enough . 
  i personally really like phrasebooks as a supplement because most courses only cover so many real life situations . 
  the most common daily things tend to be pretty formulaic , and even if what i 'm saying makes sense grammatically , it could throw someone off if i say `` i 'm interested in two cups of coffee '' instead of `` i 'd like two cups of coffee . '', 
  at least that 's how i imagine i sound trying to build daily sentences without consulting the phrasebook , and i 'm sure it 's compounded by any other mistakes i 'm making . 
  if i 'm traveling somewhere but know i will not continue learning the language , i generally do somewhere from 10-30 lessons of pimsleur . 
  it 's not that hard to learn traditional later , but if you 're most interested in taiwan , it might not be a bad idea to start exposing yourself to the traditional characters as well . 
  it does n't add all that much time to just familiarize yourself with the other system . 
   but i 've seen quite a few people online that say that 's not necessarily true due to various reasons ( traditional being more structured , pictures more likely to have meaning , etc. ), 
  do n't listen to the political propaganda . 
  learn whatever you 're more interested in because you 're more interested in it . 
  i really think that watching tv shows you like will help you more than looking specifically for things that are easy to understand . 
  you learn a lot more when you 're really interested in something . 
  i would recommend tv shows over movies because they tend to use a lot of the same vocab over and over and have dialogues about more common topics . 
  a lot of filler dialogue gets cut out of movies to fit it into a smaller package , whereas a 40 episode tv show with a simple plot does n't really have that problem . 
  i find i learn the most when watching shows with chinese subtitles and pleco in my hand for when i do n't understand something . 
  that being said , if i 'm lazy i 'll just watch with chinese subs , if i 'm really tired sometimes i put chinese and english subs . 
  try out subtitles and see how you feel you 're learning the most .
