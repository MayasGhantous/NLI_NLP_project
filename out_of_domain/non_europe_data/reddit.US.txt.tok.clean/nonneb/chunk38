  that could be what 's throwing you off . 
  this song is really good , thanks for bringing it up , 
  i lived in rural yucatan for a while and got to hear the language a bit , but unfortunately i never got my mayan up to a level where i could have more than a basic conversation . 
  it 's just too easy to switch to spanish when everyone where i lived but a few older people and pre-school age kids can speak it too . 
  i ran into some people who were monolingual , but they were almost always from more rural areas . 
  there was also the problem of lack of resources . 
  since i lived there , they 've released a telenovela in mayan ( [ baktun ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykgwkg2q6w ) ) , but as far as i know , comprehensive courses or parallel texts are still pretty few and far between . 
  edit : [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlkhiwmojxe ) 's a rap in maya . 
  unfortunately el cima passed away , and the only other rapper i know that raps in maya sometimes is [ pat boy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ugfdatcy_w ) . 
  and [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1hzf1-_ibw ) is both of them in one song . 
  future perfect is will have + [ past participle ] . 
  going to + [ unmarked infinitive ] is something completely different , usually called the `` going to future '' or something similar . 
  more communist conlangers  this sounds like it could be fun . 
  count me in . 
  i think tones generally do n't fare well when exposed to large groups of non-native speakers ( hausa and swahili , for example ) , which could make it ill-suited for a human auxiliary language . 
  hello , i currently live in budapest . 
  i 'm originally from alabama , usa . 
  i speak english ( natively ) , spanish , and german , and i 've been studying mandarin for a few years . 
  i 'm also an esperantist , and i studied classics at university . 
  looking forward to collaborating with y' all !, 
  how could we automatize encyclopedia entry generation ? 
  i understand most of the other applications , but i do n't really get that one . 
  i think it 's a nice idea . 
  the easier to parse , the better . 
  i 'm not completely sold on the idea that human languages used for communication can be described by cfgs , but i 'm far from an expert . 
  are there any examples of human languages , constructed or not , that are context-free ? 
  how does this look ? 
  / p , t , k , l , m , n , w , j , s , a , e , i , o , u /, 
  this would leave us with 14 phonemes , which is quite a small number , but within the range of natural languages . 
  this also leave room for plenty of variation from speakers coming from different native languages . 
  the stops could be realized as aspirated or voiced , / n / could be realized as [ \u014b ] by speakers who do n't distinguish the two at the end of syllables , / s / as [ z ] , etc. 
  i would leave [ r ] as an allophone of / l / . 
  the vowel system could be rough for speakers of languages like arabic or miskito which have fewer vowels . 
  we could reduce the vowels to / a , i , u / and still have 12 phonemes , which is still more than a couple of natural languages . 
  `` the butt '' ? 
  i had the same problem when i first wanted to try duolingo . 
  i took a placement test in german ( which i already speak ) , and in the upper levels , there were little problems everywhere . 
  the most common thing was not accepting my correct answers , but there were a few others as well . 
  the positive thing is , i 've been receiving a steady stream of notifications telling me that they 've fixed the problems i reported , so that means it 's getting better . 
  it 's weird that you do n't get the same for french . 
  i agree that it must be a moderator problem . 
  seems like they should add a few more . 
  funnily enough , i did n't have the same problem trying to test out of the spanish tree . 
  german probably had more problems just because there are fewer people using it . 
  from what you said about not receiving any notifications about your corrections , it must be a mod problem , but not having a large enough userbase could be a contributing factor as well . 
  i do n't really speak french , so sorry if i misunderstood what you were talking about . 
   succinct to what degree and for what benefit ? 
  as far as we know , languages tend to communicate the same amount information in roughly the same amount of time . 
  the more we reduce vertically , whether phonemes or anything else , the more syllables we 're going to need to communicate the same thing . 
  to a certain point , this is no problem . 
  information density goes down , syllables per second go up . 
  past the point at which humans would be uncomfortable speaking faster , however , information would begin to be transmitted more slowly . 
  so whether succintness is more practical depends entirely on the goals of the language . 
  i would argue that being able to speak and communicate information in a timely manner is an important quality of a successful auxiliary language , even if it comes at the expense of how easy it is to parse . 
   ccl is meant to be a widely-distributed nl . 
  rather than parting from other nl as a reference and optimizing cost of entry ,, 
  native language ? 
  natural language ? 
  assuming ccl is communist conlang , i 'm not sure it 's intended to be a native language or a natural language . 
  i would argue it should be naturalistic , i.e. 
  suitable for human communication , but it 's all open for discussion . 
  edit : i guess nl could be naturalistic language too , missed that the first time . 
  as far as why we are n't optimizing existing languages ? 
  i personally doubt that i would feel comfortable that an existing language was neutral enough to promote as an auxiliary language , no matter how stripped down it is . 
  then again , i 'm not nearly as focused the possible computational benefits of the language as you are , so once it again it comes down to goals . 
  cherokee would probably use [ this one ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_the_cherokee_nation#mediaviewer/file:flag_of_the_cherokee_nation.svg ) . 
  / f / or / v / only occurs in 44 % of languages . 
  do you think that 's enough to include it ? 
  i agree about / h / . 
  it occurs in 62 % of languages , but since we 're borderline short on phonemes it 's probably a good idea to include it . 
  if [ x ] can be an allophone , that should cover the vast majority of people . 
  audiobooks , declension tables ( e.g. 
  canoo.net for german , verbix for spanish ) , talking to myself , and being around native speakers . 
  anki helped push me past the b2 plateau , because in my daily life i would never use enough c-level vocab to remember and reinforce it . 
  the usa and britain are the only nationalist , racist , imperialist nations . 
  also , spain is in some ways better than other countries in some ways , so it is not bad and you should not criticize it . 
  plus , being racist against gypsies does n't even count . 
  it 's their culture , it has nothing to do with their race . 
  i ca n't tell from your response if you picked up on it , but that was supposed to be a caricature of the way some people defend spain . 
  i find it just as silly as you do . 
  are lah , lor , and loh like particles ? 
  i had the same trouble with german starting out . 
  i did n't know when to use schon , mal , halt , ej , etc. , but i heard people say them all the time , so i 'd just throw them in wherever . 
  i do n't really know how to describe how to use them . 
  mal kind of softens requests or commands , halt kind of means it is how it is , schon kind of ( re ) affirms something ( like indeed , maybe ) . 
  ej goes at the end of a sentence . 
  it 's negative-ish , but i ca n't really think of how to describe it better . 
  i have n't been corrected on them in a while , but at this point i kind of have a feeling for when to use them and when not to through trial and error , but describing them is really difficult . 
  [ more here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_modal_particle ), 
  not south america , but i 'd recommend southern mexico . 
  it 's very safe , the accent is easy to understand , and the people are very friendly and talkative . 
  this was my first experience being immersed in spanish and i loved it . 
  unfortunately i do n't have a specific language school to recommend , but merida has plenty . 
  i only went to nicaragua a couple of times for visa runs , but it would be my second choice . 
  i stayed at a language school in leon and talked to some of the staff there . 
  the teachers seemed knowledgeable and interested , and they organize lots of other activities as well . 
  [ fundacion la isla ] ( https://laislafoundation.org/learn-culture/ ) , it was called . 
  do n't take their prices at face value . 
  they have places to stay as well as offering classes , so tell them the situation and how long you 're staying and they 're likely to cut you a deal . 
  that pretty much goes for everywhere in central america , though .
