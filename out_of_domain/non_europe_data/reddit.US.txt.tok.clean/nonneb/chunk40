  knowing the characters and catchphrases from a discontinued kids ' show everyone your age watched is n't usually required . 
  but all of things are part of what separates a competent speaker from a native-like speaker in my mind . 
  so if you want to be a native-like speaker , focus on that . 
  if you want to be professionally competent and able to talk to other well-educated people in the language about complex stuff , focus on that . 
  they 're related skills , but they 're not the same . 
   so really how far off is c2 from native fluency ? 
  all that ranting to say , i do n't think this is really the best question , because c2 is n't just a test of language ability . 
  but no , i do n't think there 's a better official accreditation system at the moment . 
  cefr fills a need that is very important for europe , being the interdependent linguistically diverse place with an educated workforce that it is . 
  but keep that in mind , and do n't turn it into something it 's not . 
   would it be possible to do what i just mentioned & come back to attempt & pass at c2 having only the b2 required knowledge & b2 educational requirements as well as sufficient cultural knowledge ? 
  if i 'm understanding your question correctly , i do n't think it would be possible . 
  having b2 knowledge and enough education to do b2 tasks generally means you 'll be able to pass a b2 test . 
  having native-like cultural knowledge , intonation , accent , etc. 
  is certainly helpful , but by itself it 's not going to give you the ability to understand a formally written article on some unfamiliar and difficult topic . 
  the only time i 've encountered this personally with people who have actually taken one of the cefr exams is with immigrants in germany who moved there in their early teens-ish . 
  their german is pretty much just as good as natives they went through hauptschule with . 
  no ( foreign ) accent , they get all the jokes and weird references . 
  the only difference is that they 're expected to take the exams , and all their cultural knowledge from growing up in germany does n't help them `` summarize information from different spoken and written sources , reconstructing arguments and accounts in a coherent presentation . '', 
  that 's a skill in and of itself , and it 's especially difficult when the spoken and written sources are something someone with more formal education would need to sit down with and focus on . 
   so basically what you 're saying is to achieve `` native fluency '' you really need to have a good cultural understanding of the language & it 's country ( ies ) ? 
  yes , but do n't downplay the importance of accent , either . 
  lots of c2 speakers , and i mean people who are excellent with the language and deserved to pass the test , have noticeable accents . 
  if it interferes with communication , you 'll get points off , but there 's a huge gap between interfering with communication and sounding like a native . 
   do you believe in the flaring system that / r/languagelearning employs ? 
  i do n't really have a big problem with it . 
  despite the fact that cefr is n't only about language skills , it 's still a useful metric . 
  one problem is that i think it contributes to people thinking of language proficiency as a kind of monolithic thing , where you 're fluent in spanish or you 're not , you have a c2 in french or you do n't . 
  it 's possible to be really good in some areas and lacking in others , and the cefr guidelines are n't and should n't be everyone 's goal . 
  oversimplifying complex issues is hardly a problem specific to / r/languagelearning , though . 
  i 've been working in tefl for four years , three of those in europe where preparing people for the cambridge tests is a big part of the job . 
  i 've never taken an official exam because i 've never needed one . 
  interviews in the language are good enough for most places , and for english teaching , half the time they do n't even expect you to speak the language . 
  the official tests are mostly useful for getting hired or pay grade bumps for government jobs , ngos , big corporations , and hr departments that do n't speak the language they need to hire . 
  i do n't put anything on my flair because there are a few people around here who like complaining about how no one here is really tested , and i 'm not , so i 'm not going to add fuel to the fire . 
  i 've met a couple of people from fryslan who speak frisian , dutch , and english . 
  i know a good number immigrants at home in the usa who speak some kind of mayan , spanish , and english ( lots of immigration from guatemala in the area ) . 
  i met a bunch of people in honduras who spoke either creole/spanish/english or miskito/spanish/english . 
  a lot of the indians i run into speak english , hindi , and some other indian language . 
  i 've met a few chinese people who speak cantonese , mandarin , and english . 
  speaking 3 + languages is not really that uncommon . 
  people who speak 5 + , on the other hand ... 
  i ca n't think of any i know in real life . 
  edit : i thought of two swiss people i know who speak swiss german , german , french , english , and spanish . 
   so for example an exam board that oversees the testing of a language compiles set material that they deem is suitable for certain levels ? 
  ( b2 , c1 , c2 ) but would it be different from how a native speaker would compile the same test & what they think needs to be included, 
  i do n't think the difference is really exam board vs. average native speaker . 
  the difference is in the goals of the exam . 
  the exam writers are n't trying to test how native-like you speak the language . 
  if the exam writers wanted to make a test that was a better assessment of solely language skills , holding a native speaker from x place as the ideal speaker , they could . 
  but that 's not the point . 
  employers in europe are n't looking for people who can convince others they were born in germany . 
  they 're looking for people who can use german professionally ; whether or not you sound very native-like or close enough is irrelevant . 
  i do n't really think an average native speaker 's lack of metaknowledge about their own language has much to do with it at all . 
  accent and cultural knowledge does n't make you a proficient user of the language professionally . 
  if it did , every native speaker would be have the skills to be an effective office worker , and they do n't . 
  at least not without training . 
   what in your opinion is the best way for a c2 speaker to go about acquiring a `` native-accent '' to the point where they could fool a native speaker into thinking they 're native ? 
  the only language where people regularly mistake me for a native in is german , and it came really naturally . 
  i do n't think i could even pass a c2 test , though . 
  i 've been studying spanish for twice as long and am nowhere close to near-native , despite also being about c1 skills-wise . 
  unfortunately i 'm probably not the best to give advice about this . 
   so in a way , one size does n't fit all ? 
  & the debate about `` fluency '' really depends on what you want out of the language of studying & how it 'll function within your life ? 
  yes , exactly . 
  for my goals , a c2 in german would be almost irrelevant . 
  i want to integrate and blend in , socialize , and connect with my in-laws . 
  i 'd rather be closer to native than have more professional office skills . 
  on the other hand , my spanish is exactly what cefr is supposed to test . 
  i use it as a tool , and what you can * do * with the language is what the cefr tests . 
   & in this respect is this where the cefr is flawed ? 
  i do n't think the cefr is flawed at all . 
  it 's just not a measure of how native-like you are . 
  the flaw is people who treat it as something it 's not . 
  depends on the language . 
  spanish/english is mostly understandable , but not so grammatically correct . 
  same story for the major western european languages . 
  english to hungarian is only useful for individual words or certain set phrases , and english/chinese is almost completely useless . 
  like emaltman said , use linguee if you need to see how to express something in your tl . 
  i realized i did n't know any diving terms , so i looked up some of the equipment listed on wikipedia .

  what exactly do you need to do in 28 days ? 
  what level are you at right now ? 
  it was worth a look five years ago . 
  there was less competition , the content was more community driven , and there were more languages offered . 
  it means remix . 
  i find chinese grammar much harder than spanish or german grammar . 
  i feel like the vast majority of people who say that it 's easy just know that it lacks the things they find hard in commonly studied european languages : case , conjugation , plurals , whatever . 
  but chinese has its own difficulties , and anyone who has learned to form anything more than a simple sentence should know that . 
  well , this particular book says `` make confident first steps in mandarin chinese '' on the cover . 
  in general , though , it 's mandarin unless it says otherwise . 
  greek has to be pretty high on the list . 
  i 'd argue it 's easier than russian for an english speaker .
