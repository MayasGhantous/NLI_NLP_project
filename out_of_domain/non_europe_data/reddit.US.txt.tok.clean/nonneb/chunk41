  it has fewer cases and easier pronunciation , at least . 
  if you do n't mind learning something a bit more out of the way , ladino and yiddish are very similar to spanish and german , respectively , just written in the hebrew script . 
   well when you put it like that , it just makes me more curious . . :p, 
  i had the same thought . 
  i guess some people are ashamed of being weaboos , but that seemed a bit too tame to cause someone to start off so defensive . 
  after a bit of research , it seems op posts in / r/nekomimi / , / r/ookamimi / , and / r/yiff . 
  own it . 
  yeah , in the south we have idjit , but i 'm like 90 % sure it 's not related to jit as used in this video . 
  i mean , you could replace it every time with jitterbug and it makes perfect sense . 
  idjit seems to be a bit of a stretch . 
  was it the standard microsoft ime or something even worse ? 
  i kind of figured as much . 
  using sogou on any kind of test would make it much easier . 
  they are written twice ( or more ) to form one character , like in op 's examples . 
  here are [ more ] ( http://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-cn/%e7%96%8a%e5%ad%97 ) . 
  that 's perfectly natural german , but it 's kind of emphasizing obst . 
  it may have been wrong when you said it , because there was no reason to emphasize obst or bring it up at the beginning of the sentence , but it 's not bad german . 
  it 's an important sentence structure to learn , and one you 'll hear very often from natives . 
  you 'll get the hang of when to use it yourself with enough exposure . 
  for example :, 
  how often do you eat fish ? 
  how often do you see him ? 
  `` how long does it take ? '', 
  how long does it take to get to the business from your house ? 
  how long does it usually take to get through customs ? 
  how long does it take to get certified ? 
  in the future , you can generally find the answer to `` how do you say ... \uff1f `` questions on linguee.com or tatoeba.org . 
  some of these sentences also came from ichacha.net , which has awful english translations , but has a fair collection of sentences . 
  the pronunciations there can be a little too standard sometimes , as in you 'll never hear it that clearly unless someone is reading , but for learning pronunciation , that might be just what you need . 
  everything you said about piano applies to language , too . 
  i 've been doing music my whole life and got interested in languages relatively late , but the practice skills all transfer great . 
  german grammar is very front-heavy . 
  learning to conjugate verbs ; decline adjectives , articles , and nouns ; and place verbs correctly is the hardest part . 
  i 'm not really sure how to help because i do n't know what you 're struggling with right now specifically , but grammar gets easier as you go with german , not harder . 
  not saying there are n't some weird quirks to figure out at a more advanced level , but i think it 's relatively minor . 
  these articles always act like learning mandarin is some kind of soulless business investment . 
  as if you ca n't find chinese intellectually stimulating , china does n't have a fascinating culture , or whatever . 
  i do n't really get where these people are coming from there . 
  how many people has communism killed ? 
  if you 're speaking long enough to tire out your voice , you 're probably practicing enough . 
  also , some people can pick up grammar while their practicing speaking , other people need to just study grammar . 
  if your voice is tired , take a break and practice something else . 
  if you 're using assimil , a grammar supplement might not be a bad idea . 
  chatting with natives on irc or hellotalk through text can help forming sentences quickly and fluidly . 
  talking is better of course , but if you 're voice is tired , do n't push it . 
  if you really feel the need to practice more , sing , do n't speak . 
  talking is harder on your voice than singing . 
  i think learning grammar through exposure can be a good idea . 
  that 's how i learn best , but i 've met other learners who need to sit down with a grammar book and exercises . 
  if you 're learning grammar through reading or listening , you need to pay special attention to the grammar . 
  with chinese , sometimes i read through once for understanding , then another time for grammar constructs i do n't know or would have used differently . 
  you can sing however or whatever you want . 
  sing american songs , sing your assimil dialogues , sing literally whatever you want . 
  as long as you 're relaxed and singing , it 's better for your throat than talking . 
  i 'm still amazed that you 're talking enough for this to be a problem . 
  i 'm a teacher and talk a lot , but i still do n't generally hurt my throat unless i 'm sick or having sinus trouble . 
  12 % of the eu speaks german as a foreign language , 11 % speaks french as a foreign language . 
  [ source ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_237.en.pdf ) . 
  german 's also becoming more and more popular , while french is pretty stagnant . 
  i also have n't experienced your first paragraph at all . 
  bureaucrat jobs mostly require english/german/french or english/language of local office . 
  more and more germans are getting put in important posts , and most of them speak german . 
   the issue with german is that native german speakers tend to speak english quite well . 
  rich ones , maybe . 
  germans in berlin , maybe . 
  if you 're going to travel outside the tourist areas and big cities , you need german just like you need french . 
  if you stand in a supermarket and holler for an english speaker , you might find one slightly quicker in rural germany than rural france , but that 's only so helpful . 
  battle angel alita . 
  first manga i 've ever read , but i 'm enjoying it a lot so far . 
  i just finished the three-body problem , by cixin liu . 
  it has some less than kind portrayals of the cultural revolution , but besides that it 's one of my favorite sci-fi books to come out in a while . 
  nothing terribly communist on the nightstand right now , i 'm afraid . 
  i 'm a little worried about how we can define interesting . 
  chinese has a ton of tv shows and movies , and seeing how people have diverse ideas of what is interesting , that list could get really big really fast . 
  and then you might as well just go to iqiyi . 
  http://www.asianmdb.com could save us the trouble of making a list of tv shows and movies . 
  all it really needs is more people contributing and rating shows . 
  you 're just frustrated . 
  it happens . 
  you 'll either give up or get over it and keep studying . 
   because china has shit for tv shows, 
  chinese shows may be shitty , but it 's about 5x better than most countries . 
  people learn those languages , too . 
   and locks down its entire internet, 
  holaunblocker, 
   tones are not meant to be learned, 
  that 's why no foreigners speak mandarin . 
   the only chinese i could find are working in farms and have no interest in being social . 
  hellotalk , italki , sharedtalk, 
  i did n't know about that site , thanks !, 
  here 's one in text format for [ esperanto ] ( http://www.denisowski.org/esperanto/espdic_readme.htm ) . 
  and [ chinese ] ( http://www.mdbg.net/chindict/chindict.php?page=cc-cedict ), 
  i think the chinese dictionary is already being used in a program ( extension , actually ) like you 're describing called perapera . 
  india , nigeria , the usa , japan , and china are the biggest movie producers by volume . 
  [ here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/film_industry#national_film_production ) are some stats on the countries that produce the most movies . 
  [ r ] is a somewhat stigmatized southern/bavarian feature ( not sure exactly where , maybe parts of switzerland too ) . 
  [ r ] is the standard newscaster/narrator accent , and by far the most common realization of the phoneme . 
  it often comes out as a fricative in some places , but still . 
  [ r ] is sometimes used in certain types of music or theater . 
  if you use [ r ] and are obviously foreign , people generally wo n't think about it too hard .
