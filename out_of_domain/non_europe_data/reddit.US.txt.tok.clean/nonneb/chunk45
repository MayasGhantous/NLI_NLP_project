  i do n't really understand why the op chose that particular thing to criticize about china . 
  it seems pretty reasonable to me . 
  i hear \u60a8 with an - ng on the end most of the time , even though the pinyin is nin2 . 
  you have more practice listening to the people you listen to more often . 
  your teacher very likely grades their speech to be easier to understand . 
  just keep exposing yourself to different speakers and learning to understand them . 
  subs2srs is one of my favorite tools for improving comprehension of tv shows and movies . 
  robert ross , teaching * the joy of painting *, 
  i do n't know how big the difference is , but glossika has two courses on business mandarin . 
  kontroll is my favorite hungarian movie , and i 'd recommend kalandorok too . 
  in addition to what p0lar _ said , pimsleur starts from zero , while glossika starts from around a2 . 
  but if you like pimsleur and finish it , i think glossika would be a great follow-up . 
  it 's been a while since latin class , but i think that should be exempli gratia because gratia takes the genitive . 
  i agree , it 's possible to pass off what they 're doing as marxist , even though most ~ ~ marxists ~ ~ everyone sees through the bullshit . 
  relevant article for anyone interested which takes a very cautious approach towards calling china communist or capitalist : http://monthlyreview.org/2013/03/01/china-2013/#top, 
  and here 's a post from / r/communism a while back that made a stronger version of the argument that china is still on the communist path . 
  notice it was almost completely shot down , but still an interesting ( and shorter ) read : http://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/2mkhh4/what_do_you_guys_think_of_this_analysis_of/, 
  for something like bar talk , you need to find a language exchange partner or private teacher who frequents bars and get them to teach you . 
  even better if they 're from the same place you 're going , because informal language can vary a lot throughout germany . 
  you 'll also probably pick up a lot in the month you 're there before the bar opens if you go spend some time in other bars in the area . 
  i recently tried to use a copy of my passport on a train from beijing and they would n't let me on the platform without the real one . 
  i have no doubt that some people would let you use photocopy , but it 's not 100 % . 
  this is / r/communism101, 
  i think your vision on the future is more dependent on technology than the nature of class relations , so i would n't say you 're a communist or a socialist . 
  what you seem to want is a liberal democracy where everything is perfect because there is no scarcity , and this is achieved through technology . 
  i guess my question would be , how will the people ensure they benefit from all this technology ? 
  what if companies refuse to release the replicators , or sell them at a prohibitively high price ? 
  maybe your answers can help us learn a little bit more about your politics to better answer your question . 
  what you 've given us is a vision of the future , with very little information about how . 
  not sure about russian , but i find chinese grammar much more difficult than greek , german , or latin grammar . 
  it 's svo and typologically similar to english , but the similarities do n't go much further . 
  grammar from ie languages is much more familiar . 
  genders , cases , and conjugations are a pain , but ultimately something that can be memorized . 
  the way more complex chinese sentences are constructed was mind-boggling to me for years . 
  i only ( kind of ) get the hang of it now just by years of exposure . 
  ( for anyone else struggling with chinese grammar , there 's an edx course intermediate chinese grammar that i found quite helpful ) . 
  compare to german , where if you memorize a few conjugation and declension tables and put the verbs at the end of dependent clauses , you 're pretty understandable if you phrase it more or less like english . 
   typologically similar, 
  both chinese and english are isolating and analytic . 
  there are a few popular ways to learn the characters . 
  some people swear you should write them over and over again . 
  that 's how chinese students learn them , and i 'm sure it works , but it 's too painful for me . 
  i personally just throw them in anki and fail them until i can remember . 
  also not terribly fun , but i enjoy it more than writing til i get cramps . 
  it helped a lot when i started memorizing words instead of characters , for example , memorize \u559c\u6b22 instead of \u559c and \u6b22 separately . 
  however , this does n't teach you handwriting , which is what you say you 're struggling with . 
  some people also put emphasis on learning the radicals , so you can see what pieces characters are built from , making them easier to remember . 
  that 's what ogiso_setsuna is talking about , i think . 
  i personally think you 'll figure them out pretty quickly just by learning characters , but it might be helpful . 
  i 'm on \u5747\u8861\u6559\u6d3e right now . 
  if we can get a group of five , i 'm down to play on a different server , though . 
   for example , suppose english has a word batman and another phrase for a baseball player called bat man . 
  they might change bat man into something like bat person , to make comprehension easier without context, 
  real world english example : the words pen and pin sound the same in southern american english . 
  so we started calling them ink pens and stick pins to differentiate . 
  hi , speaker of appalachian english here . 
  since when does ebonics get a free pass and we do n't ? 
  the same people who defend ebonics defend most every stigmatized dialect , and the same classist people who are prejudiced towards black people because of how they speak are prejudiced against us , too . 
  we just do n't attract the racists as much . 
  also , they are not gramatically or semantically indistinguishable . 
  aave has a very different tense/aspect system . 
  for example , the habitual `` be '' does n't work in appalachian english , as in phrases like `` he be trippin '' . 
  in the same way , the present progressive in appalachian is formed with `` is ( a - ) '' , while in aave usually omits that . 
  compare `` he 's ( a - ) fishin '' with `` he fishin '' . 
  there are also plenty of pronunciation differences . 
  appalachian vowels often break into two syllables , aave vowels do n't . 
  aave is non-rhotic , appalachian english is rhotic . 
  that 's really weird . 
  from your description i 'm roughly the same level as you , but no one ever corrects anything i say or switches to english with me . 
  even when i notice i make mistakes , people normally do n't seem to care . 
  then again , i lived in the ruhrgebiet , and berlin is special . 
  i 'd recommend not taking it personally . 
  do what they 'd do if you commented on their english : say they 're being too critical and dismiss it , possibly with a insult about their english thrown in just to be unnecessarily combative . 
   what pisses me off most is that i am in berlin where we are also speaking english a lot of the time , and these people make arguably worse mistakes in english, 
  have you tried telling them ? 
  the responses are pretty good if you need a laugh . 
  my textbook used traditional , but since then i 've been studying/using simplified . 
  i find it easier to write , easier to read in small font , less cluttered-looking , and it 's easier to find native content in simplified than traditional . 
   but you know what they say when everyone around you is an asshole ... 
  i 've never really gotten that sentiment . 
  why do some places seem full of assholes and others do n't ? 
  i do n't change * that * much when i move . 
  people talking about the lost tribes of israel are some of my favorites , but this is only the second time i 've seen them say it was the celts . 
  the first time i was at a screening for a film produced by a local weatherman about how the battle of teutoberg forest caused the holocaust , and the guy next to me ended up explaining to me how the gauls were the lost tribes of israel . 
  at that point in my life , i was too polite to just walk off , but i was really having trouble keeping it together . 
  who , the white guys ? 
  there 's not really a way to avoid getting stopped for pictures , free stuff , and getting hit on . 
  it 's how they handle it that determines if they 're shallow or not . 
  what we consider bragging is looked down on , but what counts as bragging to an american and a german is not the same . 
  i can totally see someone , in the right context , talking about their qualifications kind of like op did starting a new job in the us . 
  would not fly in germany , or at least people would give you shit about it . 
  americans are also much more prone to and used to expressing confidence verbally , whereas germans tend to be less verbal about most everything except their insurance policy . 
  not that simple , they both go both ways . 
  someone explained japanese below , but i 'll give chinese ( mandarin ) examples . 
  wa ** l ** mart in china is called woe ** r ** ma ( \u6c83\u5c14\u739b \uff09 , but ha ** rr ** y potter is ha ** l ** i bote ( \u54c8\u5229\u6ce2\u7279 ) . 
  i think it depends on where the english sound falls in the syllable , but i 'm not sure . 
  the second link is broken , should be this : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/internationalization_of_the_renminbi, 
  relevant username ? 
   the limited phonology means that japanese is by far the easiest of these 3 languages in terms on pronunciation and listening comprehension . 
  japanese has an easier phonology than chinese , but it 's also spoken about 60 % faster , which can cause as many problems as the simple phonology solves .
