  [ spoiler ] fives , in particular , disobeyed authority , even took out his inhibitor chip keeping him subservient to the republic , and managed to discover the order 66 plot . 
  his character was intended to be heroic , but , like in the real world , people who do n't fit into the machine are labeled as crazy . 
  there 's certainly a difference between a well-functioning democracy and a dictatorship , but the clone wars is set at a time when it 's not clear exactly where the republic falls on that spectrum . 
  when did it stop being a democracy ? 
  or become a dictatorship ? 
  i was impressed at how the show was able to raise issues like this in a way kids can digest , as opposed to the typical good guy/bad guy plot . 
  by the way , i would actually agree with most of your specific complaints if i saw them in the show , but i think i just got a different message from the show than you did . 
  it most certainly has a liberal slant like almost everything , and is by no means a beacon of socialist values , but i would choose it for my kids ( if i had any ) over most shows i 've seen . 
  you can definitely start with assimil , especially since she has a background in french already . 
  if she 's not comfortable with it , doing a shortish beginner course first is n't a bad idea . 
  i personally like pimsleur , though in this situation i would only do one level . 
  sample it before you buy , though , to make sure it suits her . 
  i use [ cantofish ] ( https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/cantofish/ ) , which might be helpful for you . 
  it 's for firefox , but that 's the best i can think of . 
  oh , definitely . 
  i 'm a lot more comfortable understanding spoken german than reading it . 
  probably because i have n't read more than a few books and some news articles here and there , and have never taken a class . 
  i showed up in germany knowing very little and pretty much just wung it , supplemented by looking at conjugation and declension tables . 
  i 'm not sure if my speaking is better than my writing . 
  i spell some stuff wrong ( mixing up er/a is a big problem for less common words ) , but if it 's informal communication , i 'm for the most part pretty confident . 
  i mean , half the people on my facebook feed ca n't use das/dass to save their soul , so it 's not like it demands perfection . 
  i definitely wo n't be doing any formal work writing german anytime soon though , so in that way my speaking could be considered better than my writing . 
  my spanish and chinese are the opposite , though . 
  reading/writing is significantly better than listening/speaking . 
  and of course greek and latin i ca n't speak at all , so german is definitely the outlier there . 
  there are a few sites where you can read it online , but i have n't found a convenient place to download it from to read offline , at least a chinese version . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.dm5.com/manhua-beijixiong-cafe/ ) is the first one i came across on baidu . 
  this particular series i 've only ever found in traditional , unfortunately . 
  if you really do n't want to pay people , you can try ackuna.com . 
  you should really pay someone though , it 's better quality and translators need food , too . 
  why ? 
  i 've never known an immigrant/expat community that does n't throw in words from the language where they 're living . 
  seems like mixing words is just something people do when they 're always around two languages . 
  when people complain about german being hard , it 's usually cases and whatnot . 
  but the register difference between colloquial and formal german is pretty big , which makes reading quite difficult , even if you can speak well . 
  i have the book , and i really like it . 
  it 's pretty typical for an assimil book , and better than assimil mandarin in my opinion . 
  so if you like that format , go for it . 
  as someone from appalachia , i can personally assure you that i sound exactly like shakespeare . 
  reading shakespeare was actually too easy for me , which is why i just read the sparknotes to get the gist . 
  it had nothing to do with the fact that i could n't understand half of what he was saying . 
  fair enough . 
  there are certainly people that overdo it . 
  not to pick on r/learnjapanese , but it is ( or used to be , at least ) pretty rampant over there . 
  this just seemed more natural to me , i guess because it 's using chinese words to talk about chinese political distinctions that i normally would n't talk about in english instead of just throwing in characters for random words . 
   this is , after all , the loudest goddamn country in the world . 
  a lot of complaints on / r/china make me think , `` these people must have never lived in central america , '' but this one is the best so far . 
  it gets pretty loud here , but it ca n't hold a candle to the constant reggaeton out of extremely loud old pa systems in every single shop and square . 
  * whew * your title scared me . 
  just download and seed some of the torrents with the gold coin next to them , you 'll be back in the black in no time . 
  more details of what ? 
  loud reggaeton music everywhere ? 
  there 's not many details or cool stories . 
  where in china there 's always some person on the bus playing bad chinese music loudly from their phone , in la there 's at least three plus the bus speakers . 
  where here i 'm likely to hear \u5c0f\u82f9\u679c every time i leave the house , in la it 's the latest reggaeton track every third shop . 
  it 's pretty much the same , just more frequent and louder , and no dancing grandmothers . 
  same story for pretty much every china complaint on here that is actually just a developing world complaint , which is probably half of them . 
  central america  ** l ** atin ** a ** merica  la i 've never even been to los angeles , what would i know . 
  my only defense is that everything i posted after lunch yesterday was under the influence of baijiu . 
  the apple song situation could be better , could be worse . 
  anywhere near speakers or a middle age man with a cell phone is a danger zone , though . 
  what do you think about it that your friends say is romanticized ? 
  either way , fascinating is a definitely a word i 'd use to describe it . 
  it 's very much a place of contradictions : rampant alcohol and drug abuse with plenty of tee-totalers ( sp ? 
  ) , teen pregnancy rates through the roof ( my county is consistently top 5 in the nation ) coupled with strong religious views against pre-marital sex , a sub-saharan life expectancy in the richest country on earth . 
  we have kick-ass music , singins , beautiful scenery , an interesting dialect , and probably the most interesting group of people i 've lived around . 
  lots of people who made it off the mountain come back and retire or work from home if they can , and i 'm hoping to get back as soon as i 've saved enough to plant some blueberries . 
  that 's the fun part . 
  on the other hand , i did n't enjoy playing at my neighbor 's when i was little because they had an outhouse . 
  getting healthy groceries does n't happen much , because the nearest wal-mart is 35 minutes away , but there 's a dollar general and a jack 's ( think mcd 's plus kfc if you 're not familiar with it ) 10 minutes away . 
  the most successful people i know my age who stayed there are a vet tech and a farrier . 
  jobs are pretty much zilch unless you commute to or move into the nearest city , which is n't exactly an economic wonder . 
  other options include pulpwooding and agricultural work , and gathering firewood or scrap metal are popular among younger people between jobs/instead of working at waffle house . 
  now , keep in mind it 's a really diverse place these days . 
  some of the big cities like knoxville etc. 
  are really nice , and some parts are definitely better than others . 
  my family is melungeon and has been in appalachia since the 1600s , and our current land since 1800 , so the family friends and everything i grew up around are only a small subset of very mountain people in a place that 's really quite diverse . 
  you can run across people from all over the place at the weekly trade day . 
  and when i say diverse , i 'm afraid i 'm not talking about racial diversity , unfortunately . 
  at least not in my area . 
  there is one black guy and one vietnamese lady that live nearby . 
  everyone knows who they are and talks about them all the time . 
  not usually malicious , but plenty of ignorant/casual racism . 
  there are confederate flags everywhere . 
  it took me months to convince a couple of black friends to come to my house , and when they came , the fucking neighbor ( an uncle , unfortunately ) got out his binoculars to look . 
  i know a guy a few miles away hires a black guy to bush hog his fields , and he literally stands outside with a gun while he bushhogs to make sure no one messes with him . 
  there are some real winners here , but almost everyone i know was happy when the trailer colony of skinheads burned , so that 's something at least . 
  their electricity was run through an extension cord just laying along the road , so who did n't see that coming . 
  i 'm rambling , but if you have any questions , i 'm happy to answer . 
  it 's a great place . 
  people are mostly very nice if a bit suspicious sometimes . 
  i grew up there , spend a month or so there every year now , but have n't actually lived there in almost ten years . 
  not an expert , but i 'll do my best . 
  we have a few interesting things that happen to our verbs . 
  one is forming the progressive tenses with a - prefixes , e.g. 
  i think it happens mostly for story telling , but i 'm not sure . 
  also , subject verb agreement is different . 
  the past of `` be '' is always `` was '' , for singular and plural . 
  sometimes plural subjects take the singular form of other verbs as well . 
  one of the biggest differences i notice is the past tense of verbs , which are often regularized , and some of the most common ones use the past participle instead of the past .
