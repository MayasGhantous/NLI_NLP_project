  when i lived at my very religious family 's house , i was n't allowed to read this book because it was about darwin . 
  true story . 
  edit : oh , and to answer your question , i read it and there 's nothing unexpected . 
  i 'm 22 and have no intention of voting . 
  i tend to dream in the language my day is spent in ( or around exam time in university , the language i 've been studying all day ( ancient greek , anyone  ? . 
  on occasion , this has happened in languages which i 'm only marginally comfortable with . 
  i 'd say it would n't happen before about a month though : you need to be able to handle some tasks without thinking about it . 
  i thought they handled it pretty well : they had a backup stream with commentary , and they got the tastosis stream fixed pretty quickly . 
  good job mlg !, 
  that 's odd , i 'm not having any problems with it ( excluding the five minutes the main stream was down ) besides being tired . 
  some of us actually spend time and energy working toward the goal of revolution instead of just voting and pretending like we 're doing something important . 
  that 's not true . 
  do is required only in negative sentences ( and questions ) which do not contain another auxiliary verb . 
  * i am not, 
  * i shall not/shan ' t, 
  * i will not/won ' t, 
  * i must not/mustn ' t, 
  * i cannot/can ' t, 
  * i would not/wouldn ' t, 
  * i could not/couldn ' t, 
  * i ought not/oughtn ' t, 
  * i have not/haven ' t, 
  * i use to not, 
  * i might not/mightn ' t, 
  * i may not, 
  i might have forgotten a couple , but none of those verbs take an additional auxiliary do in negation or questions ( except for `` have '' when it 's not a part of a perfect tense ), 
  if you do n't cross your 7 's , continental europeans will likely think it is a 1 . 
  i ca n't find a good image which demonstrates why on google at the moment , but their one looks like `` 1 '' without the bottom line . 
  is n't that just the perfect passive ? 
  no `` plu '' involved ? 
  there are plenty of businesses in the deep south where aave is the only language you 'll hear employees use , which becomes quite humorous when some of my aave-impaired friends visiting from areas without a large number of aave speakers find themselves unable to understand . 
  so you and your russian amikino share esperanto ? 
  you must produce and make native esperanto speaking babies . 
  i especially do n't understand why it was given a one sentence mention the first day in my economics class and was never mentioned again . 
  esperanto is most likely the simplest choice . 
  however , if we must choose a natural language , i find turkish to be the least complex and most regular . 
  i 've never learned or attempted to learn a native american language ( except yucatec maya , which is not even close to as difficult as something like navajo ) , so i ca n't comment on that . 
  of all the major languages , however , i find korean the most daunting . 
  the phonology is killer : their `` m '' sometimes sounds like an m and sometimes a b. oh and they have 3 sounds for p , one of which sounds like a b ( to an unexposed english speaker ) and all of which sound like each other . 
  the grammar is complex enough , but even more different . 
  did i mention politeness forms ? 
  have fun with that . 
  * \u3142 = `` p '' in `` sports '' ( unaspirated unvoiced bilabial ), 
  * \u314d = `` p '' in `` pen '' ( aspirated unvoiced bilabial ), 
  * \u3143 = tense `` p '' , whatever that is ( tense unvoiced bilabial ?? 
  ( someone correct me if i 'm using the wrong terms ) ), 
  also , \u3141 sometimes sounds like `` m '' and sometimes like `` b '' to english speakers , which is also a pain . 
  \u3142 sounds like `` b '' to us sometimes too . 
  i can mostly tell them apart except for \u3143 , but i have to concentrate . 
  i double-checked , and apparently \u3142 is sometimes pronounced as p and sometimes b. 
  even easier to learn , 
  could you elaborate a bit on why german is easier than the other languages you listed , specifically dutch and afrikaans ? 
  i would also say that french and spanish are easier for native english speakers than german , but i can understand the case against that . 
  i just tried to say sport with a voiced `` p '' and it sounds a bit odd . 
  sport with an unaspirated `` p '' and sport pronounced like `` sbort '' are definitely not the same for me . 
  edit : when i say voiced `` p '' , i meant the orthographic `` p '' , not the sound . 
  here is a whole thread about an example from the pimsleur course , with some links to the audio included : http://how-to-learn-any-language.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?tid=7126&amp;pn=1, 
  as i remember , it has something to do with nasals in korean being pronounced with the soft palate in a different position than in english ( want to say i read that in `` the sounds of korean '' from choo and o'grady but i could be mistaken ), 
  i constantly say `` there is '' , especially `` there 's '' , instead of `` there are '' with plurals . 
  sounds wrong to me . 
  a whole nother is grammatical where i 'm from , and if you do it , there 's a good chance it 's grammatical where you live too . 
  i 'm not sure if `` a whole nother '' is an example of tmesis or not , but that might be the word you 're looking for . 
  less for fewer is n't really wrong as i understand it . 
  fewer is only for countable objects , less is for countable or uncountable . 
  i also had to look up that use of `` whose '' recently for some editing i was doing and some pretty prescriptivist style manuals said it was ok . 
  could you give an example ? 
  high german can be two things : one is the official , standardized language of germany , austria , switzerland , and a couple of smaller countries . 
  i think , though , that you are asking about the high german languages , which are a dialect continuum which includes all of the german languages/dialects which were a part of the high german consonant shift ( p -  f or p -  pf , for example ) . 
  standard german is one example of a high german language/dialect . 
  low german is a group of dialects ( though according the european charter for regional or minority languages , a different language than high german ) which did not experience the high german consonant shift . 
  it 's a rather uncommon language these days , though seemingly everyone from north germany has a grandma that speaks it . 
  a variant is also spoken by the ~ ~ amish ~ ~ mennonites . 
  why are they called high and low ? 
  high german comes from mountainous and higher altitude areas , thus high . 
  low german comes from , you guessed it , plains and low altitude areas . 
  short version : high german , low german , and dutch are three closely related west germanic languages . 
  it 's a bit like asking how spanish and portuguese are different ( a slightly larger difference there , but not much ) . 
  it used to be much more common than it is now . 
  when i pick up books published in the early part of the 20th century from a used book store , i see this style more often than not . 
  it is a bit arbitrary . 
  like lingprof said , they do form a dialect continuum . 
   you could just as accurately describe it as one language standardized three different ways . 
  that would be a bit unconventional , but it ultimately depends on the definitions of language you 're using . 
  i think the division into three major parts by their sound changes works out pretty well , however . 
  they do teach platt as a foreign language in a few german schools and it 's protected by the european charter for regional and minority languages , and most of the dutch people i know do n't respond very well to being told they speak the same language as germans . 
  that does n't even bring up the issue of mutual intelligibility , but overall i feel like calling them all the same language would be a bit like calling the chinese `` dialects '' all the same language : counterproductive , at least . 
  and my apologies , i was thinking of the mennonites , who speak a low german language . 
  the amish do indeed speak a high german language . 
  i say `` an ar linguistics subission '' or `` an ar trees submission . '', 
  however , when the subreddit begins with a vowel , i say `` a raw submission '' ( for r/aww ) `` a ratheism submission '' . 
  i 'm not sure how normal this is . 
  i only know how i say them because i talk to myself . 
  is 4 gate not standard in pvp ? 
  til someone counted how many words johnny depp said in edward scissorhands . 
   and let 's admit it , you need large entities ( corporations ) to produce things we enjoy or rely on to survive ( cars , computers , clean water supplies , police , hospitals ) . 
  i completely agree ( except about the police , as noted elsewhere ) , but where does hierarchy come in ? 
  the socialist society needs administrators and organizers . 
  administrating does not mean being someone 's superior . 
  organizing does n't make you someone 's boss . 
  what is a tea towel ?
