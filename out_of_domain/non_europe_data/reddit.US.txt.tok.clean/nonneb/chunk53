  there are also , however , lots of period dramas and cop/gangster dramas , which have a different type of ridiculousness . 
  chinese movies are good in a much less absurd way . 
  especially in recent years , the average chinese blockbusters are very enjoyable movies , and taiwan produces some good relatively lower budget films ( at least they look lower budget ) . 
  i 'm especially fond of the films based on \u4e5d\u628a\u5200 books . 
  quebec cinema is also great , but unfortunately not a huge scene . 
  for the size of quebec , it 's pretty impressive though . 
  i know you asked for the best , but i have to give german a shoutout for having the worst movies to population/money ratio . 
  yeah , i know , there are some great german movies , but how many ? 
  i 'm struggling to break five , i 'd be really surprised if there were ten . 
  that 's just not enough to help with language learning , because there 's no strong industry to keep producing watchable stuff . 
  i told you i 'd post the 50th lesson of assimil to give you an idea of the level the second book starts at . 
  here 's the dialogue . 
  might be a couple of typos , i found the audio but not the book . 
  i prefer simplified , but am pretty comfortable with traditional , too , almost entirely from watching taiwanese shows with trad subtitles . 
  they are n't that different . 
  if i remember correctly , there are only a couple hundred different characters , the rest are all systematic changes . 
  i 'm sure you can do it in anki if you want to , but if you 'd rather just pick it up as you go , it 's not too hard . 
  yeah , taiwanese entertainment is extremely common . 
  especially in the music industry , where the top hits are very likely to be taiwanese artists , and if you go to a ktv in china , you 're going to see more traditional than simplified . 
  the tv shows are also all over the place . 
  twdrama was kdrama before kdrama got big , and any chinese language streaming site , including the mainland ones , is going to have more than enough taiwanese shows to keep you entertained . 
  i have n't noticed any censoring , but i 'm sure there are shows that get the axe . 
  i have n't heard of a big show in taiwan being banned in the mainland , and i 'd wager it 's mostly the small , overtly political pieces that probably are n't big enough to get on iqiyi anyways . 
  in which case , you could watch them on a taiwanese site or youtube , no big deal . 
  unlike you , i actively prefer mainland media , but still about half of the shows i watch are taiwanese , so i seriously doubt you 'd have a problem sticking to tw tv shows if you want . 
  the only place where you 'd be be crippling yourself is in the movie department . 
  war movies , action movies , anything that requires big special effects does n't show up as often in taiwanese movies . 
  there are great taiwanese movies , but when you want to watch things go boom , taiwanese movies wo n't give you that as often . 
  taiwan has good presence on non-ccp-approved sites . 
  they 're not behind the great firewall at all . 
  facebook is big , whatsapp and line are big , plenty of taiwanese stuff on youtube . 
  there are plenty of websites , as long as you do n't mind crappy 90s web design and bbs . 
  i 'm not sure about how taiwan censors its own web , but it 's not censored by china . 
  two side notes : one of my favorite mandarin series came out of singapore . 
  singapore and malaysia do n't put out nearly as much stuff as china or taiwan , but do n't ignore them , either . 
  two : definitely do n't learn cantonese for hk movies . 
  more and more of them are being produced in mandarin to appeal more to mainland audiences , which has the bonus effect of inviting censorship . 
  yeah , i thought it was chesterdrawrs until i was in middle school , and still pronounce it that way . 
  and , my speech is rhotic , though to me it makes sense for of -  a ( non-rhotic - er ) , not of -  er ( rhotic ) , but what do i know . 
  sorry for lack of ipa , too lazy . 
  pavc ( practical audio visual chinese ) seems to be the standard in taiwan . 
  i used it , and it 's a solid , high-quality textbook . 
  i could have sworn assimil had a version in traditional characters , but i used the simplified version . 
  if i did n't pay hefty ticket fees to be underwhelmed , i would n't feel like i was on vacation . 
  thanks for the advice !, 
  most of it 's pretty self-explanatory , but when you say salt city , are you talking about \u76d0\u57ce\u5e02 \uff1f it seems a little out of the way for the weekend , but i 'll keep it in mind in case things get too slow . 
  i 'm actually in \u5f90\u5dde pretty often , but i 've never taken the time to explore the city , just jump on the high speed train . 
  i 'll definitely check out the tombs sometime , now that i know they exist . 
  i was n't expecting anything life-changing . 
  i was just looking for a way to kill a four-day weekend , a friend mentioned lianyungang , the pictures looked nice , so why not ? 
  do you remember what part of town the bar is in ? 
  or just in general the best part of town to go out and have drinks ? 
  my town has one proper bar , which is always empty , so my standards are pretty low . 
  update in case anyone finds this thread through searching :, 
  \u8fde\u5c9b and \u82b1\u679c\u5c71 are both worth your time , though a little pricy . 
  i spent all day on the island . 
  the beaches kind of suck , but if you enter and go right into the nature reserve , there 's a beach down there that is much less crowded . 
  there 's also a path along the ocean that seems to stretch most of the way around the island , which is a very enjoyable walk , especially through the nature reserve , where there are wild-ish peacocks . 
  if you 're planning on walking through \u82b1\u679c\u5c71 , definitely allow a whole day . 
  i showed up in the afternoon and did n't have enough time to get all the way through the park . 
  it 's a cool place , though . 
  it costs 100rmb in the summer , 50rmb in the winter . 
  no atms near the buses or cable cars , and they do n't take any kind of credit cards . 
  i did n't enjoy \u8001\u8857 at all . 
  one emptyish tourist street of overpriced , frozen seafood and shops with signs in right-to-left traditional characters . 
  that 's about it . 
  it 's a long way from anything else , and was n't worth the trip from the city center . 
  there seems to be more city activities in \u6d77\u5dde \uff0c but i never made it out that way , so i ca n't comment . 
  also , there are enough tourists here that the locals know to try to scam foreigners . 
  like most chinese scammers , their attempts are laughably amateur most of the time , but if you 're not used to it , be on your guard . 
  i enjoyed [ stephen chow 's version ] ( http://baike.baidu.com/link?url=uv8bcsaq67mk-lpnzvfkfkuwjfkjtct2zowueneg-gewor3fqq2ln3zhmir2kw-977m25dd0n2t_k2nsdvieh_zxcuj55_zz2dylimi1boc ) of journey to the west as well , but was n't that mandarin ? 
  more like [ these ] ( http://i01.i.aliimg.com/wsphoto/v0/2010093735_1/-font-b-waterproof-b-font-breathable-dupont-materials-customized-felt-soled-font-b-fishing-b.jpg ) . 
  i use plia\u011da frat ( in ) o and plijuna frat ( in ) o. 
  i took greek , latin , and spanish in college while learning german outside of class for my then-girlfriend and figuring out enough french to read primary sources i needed for my papers . 
  my greek , german , and spanish all turned out well . 
  latin was never really my passion anyways , and i 've since forgotten a lot , but it was n't a huge problem in class . 
  those languages are n't as difficult as yours , but since you already know some chinese , i 'm sure you 'll be fine . 
  it was a lot of work though , so make sure you 're willing to put in the time . 
  why not ? 
  i do n't live in a city with uber , so i 've never tried it . 
  what makes it different than using alipay for other purchases ? 
  define good quality ? 
  according to the locals , \u5f90\u5dde\u8bdd is similar to the dialect where i live . 
  there are different registers , but it can get pretty unintelligible sometimes . 
  like [ these ] ( http://v.youku.com/v_show/id_xmzuyodqxntyw.html?from=s1.8-1-1.2 ) kids . 
  the only people i know who speak like that are proper \u519c\u6751\u4eba , though . 
  [ here ] ( http://v.youku.com/v_show/id_xnjqwmjmynje2.html?from=s1.8-1-1.2 ) is what 's supposed to be lol commentary in the local dialect , but this person 's speech sounds very standard to me . 
  the tone contours are n't that different . 
  and [ here ] ( http://v.youku.com/v_show/id_xodayodawodg4.html?from=s1.8-1-1.2 ) 's a video one of my friends showed me the other day . 
  it 's mostly \u666e\u901a\u8bdd , and it 's supposed to be funny , not informative , but the person speaking \u6dee\u5317\u8bdd is enunciating pretty clearly . 
  maybe you 'll find it useful . 
  you can especially notice the tones on \u4e0d\u7ba1 . 
  and finally , despite the put on voices , [ this ] ( http://v.youku.com/v_show/id_xmzu1nde3odey.html?from=s1.8-1-1.2 ) is probably the closest to the way most people in town speak . 
  not as unintelligible as the first video , but not as standard as the lol video either . 
  the tones seem different to me , but i 'm not really sure how to describe it . 
  edit 2 : [ here ] ( http://www.iqiyi.com/w_19rsm5o80l.html ) 's another one . 
  sounds pretty typical . 
  edit : for the first time today ( been living here for four months ) , a friend introduced me as speaking \u6dee\u5317\u8bdd , instead of the usual \u4e2d\u6587 / \u666e\u901a\u8bdd / whatever . 
  i 'm very distrustful of people talking about my chinese in general , but hey , a first is a first . 
  if i share a strong third language with someone , we usually speak in that language .
