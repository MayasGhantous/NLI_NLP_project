  easy ? 
  i enjoy it a lot and am hoping to extend my stay here , and not only because i 'm not satisfied with my mandarin yet . 
  i 've heard some wu dialects visiting friends in \u6c5f\u82cf , and i really like the way they sound . 
  i hope to learn another dialect after i improve my mandarin , but i ca n't let myself get too distracted for now . 
  you missed the opportunity to use `` he opens the window up '' to further highlight how confusing and mysterious separable verbs are in german . 
  in most contexts , in `` literally stated it '' , i would interpret literally as an intensifier , and in `` stated it literally '' , i would not . 
  maybe that poster always interprets `` literally '' before a verb as an intensifier , even if the speaker meant literally literally . 
  still an asshat , but i think that 's what sparked their misuse-of-literal alarm . 
  do they ever connect a preposition and a subject ? 
  usually they 're between the subject and the main verb in an affirmative sentence , or at the beginning of a question . 
  on a side note , the questions you ask here make me kind of hate whatever school system you went to and make me feel bad about being an english teacher . 
  do n't get me wrong , not knowing grammar does n't mean your stupid or anything , but to get through school without having had a class on this stuff is a huge failure on the school 's part . 
  and i appreciate that you 're making the effort to improve for your students , but these are the kind of things that you should really know before you start teaching . 
  again , not entirely your fault , someone had to hire you first . 
  but damn . 
   nearly 1 million people are getting enemas ? 
  towns and cities are evacuated not people . 
  just a bit of pedantry about the word evacuate . 
  i lived in a few different countries in europe , never found a store i could go to and pick up everything i needed like walmart . 
  auchan ( al campo ) is probably closest , but the selection is a bit lacking compared to wal-mart , not to mention it 's more expensive . 
  i do n't know why you 're getting downvoted . 
  it 's a convenience that once you have , is hard to leave . 
  it 's difficult to get used to going all over town to pick up different stuff . 
   does she have the boss wife 's weixin ? 
  the most useful advice in the thread . 
  this is one of those problems that can unfortunately probably only be solved the chinese way . 
  just from watching and interacting with foreigners in different countries , seven years seems to be a decent estimate of how long it takes most people to get near-native in a language . 
  sometimes it 's faster , some people never learn , but do n't be discouraged after one year . 
  keep pushing and you 'll get there . 
  a lot of times , the books are actually ebooks , but they forget to put that in the description . 
  do n't email me a scanned pdf , i could have gotten that off baidu myself . 
  when the delivery people are being lazy and telling you to come get your package instead of delivering , just threaten to complain to their boss . 
  sometimes taobao customer service can push them a bit , as well . 
  do n't trust the ratings . 
  some people rate five stars , but then say that they received a fake/broken item in the comment . 
  no idea why they do that . 
  read the comments , do n't look at the stars . 
  like op said , never search in english . 
  pleco it first . 
  oh , no 711s in these parts , so i would n't know . 
  i just put the link because they have a fair selection of single-source beans , and the price seems fair enough . 
  maybe people in big cities are n't as desperate , but i was psyched when i found it . 
  i always order from there , but if people have better online suggestions , i could always use more options . 
  i wear size 47 . 
  when i search for shoes , for example \u7bee\u7403\u978b , i then get a list of filters , one of which is shoe size ( \u978b\u7801 \uff09 . 
  click on \u66f4\u591a , then whatever size you want , as long as it 's 47 or less . 
  i searched for onitsuka tiger 47\u7801 , and the same list of filters came up . 
  after clicking on 47 , all the options on the first row had the shoes in size 47 . 
  that does n't help you with half-sizes , but i 've never had to look for them , so i do n't have any good tips . 
  some of the results for the onitsuka tiger 47\u7801 had half-sizes though , like [ this ] ( http://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a230r.1.14.26.trx8wr&amp;id=40916579043&amp;ns=1&amp;abbucket=20#detail ) one . 
  if you like \u90a3\u4e9b\u5e74 \uff0c \u6211\u5011\u4e00\u8d77\u8ffd\u7684\u5973\u5b69 , watch the other movies based on \u4e5d\u628a\u5200 books , like \u7b49\u4e00\u4e2a\u4eba\u5496\u5561 and \u6740\u624b ( i think the movie has a longer name , but i ca n't remember it at the moment ) . 
  they 're some of my favorite chinese-language movies . 
  it can be hard ( though certainly possible for more popular titles ) to find downloads on the internet . 
  but some apps let you download manga to store on the phone for offline use , like \u6f2b\u753b\u4eba \uff0c for example . 
  i 'm not sure if their catalog has everything you 're looking for , but it 's worth a look . 
  he 's trying , bless his heart . 
   in trying to teach the basics of a language people revert to very simplistic ideas including ... 
  you hit the nail on the head . 
  almost every language book i 've seen uses stereotypes as a way to help the learner make associations and avoid confusion . 
  for example , in 5 years of teaching english , i 've never seen a book which introduces the word `` nurse '' with a picture of a guy or refers to a nurse as a guy . 
  and to be fair , if i try to mix it up , i 'll inevitably have a student who is thrown off by it , so i think the language courses are more a symptom of targeting an averagely mainstream sexist audience than some devious patriarchal plot , but it 's annoying all the same . 
  not sure how relevant this is to duolingo , but it 's definitely a trend in language learning materials in general . 
  i 've had and am currently having the same struggle . 
  it 's a matter of improving not only listening comprehension , but also anticipating what kind of things the person will say . 
  the things germans say to strangers and the things chinese say are very different , so even if i think i understand the words , it just confuses me sometimes . 
  i do n't really have that problem with german or spanish anymore and i did n't really do anything specific to work on it . 
  i just practiced , lived in the respective countries for a while , and got used to interacting with people . 
  i guess i have more sympathy than advice . 
  the one thing i 'd say , which is more motivational than practically helpful , is to pay attention to how often you actually do n't understand those snippets of conversations or first words in your native language . 
  for me , it 's a lot more than i realized , and it made me feel more comfortable not understanding every little thing i heard . 
  i met an adult last week who thought chinchillas were mythical , because they had only heard of them from my neighbor totoro . 
  yes , but cursive stroke order is often different from the standard stroke order , like for the character \u751f . 
  if we label the standard strokes of \u751f as 12345 , then the handwritten \u884c\u4e66 style character would be ( 12 ) 435 , as seen in these [ 1 ] ( http://www.sfzd.cn/%e9%ab%98%e6%b8%85a/%e6%99%8b/%e6%99%8ba%e7%8e%8b%e7%be%b2%e4%b9%8ba%e8%a1%8c%e4%b9%a6a%e5%85%b0%e4%ba%ad%e5%ba%8fa197_1033.jpg ) [ 2 ] ( http://www.sfzd.cn/%e9%ab%98%e6%b8%85a/%e6%99%8b/%e6%99%8ba%e7%8e%8b%e7%8c%ae%e4%b9%8ba%e8%a1%8c%e4%b9%a6a%e8%96%84%e5%86%b7%e5%b8%96a20_518.jpg ) [ 3 ] ( http://112.124.33.156:8080/%e9%ab%98%e6%b8%85a/%e6%99%8b/%e6%99%8ba%e7%8e%8b%e7%8c%ae%e4%b9%8ba%e8%a1%8c%e4%b9%a6a%e9%9d%99%e6%81%af%e5%b8%96a40_6220.jpg ) [ 4 ] ( http://112.124.33.156:8080/%e9%ab%98%e6%b8%85a/%e5%94%90/%e5%94%90a%e6%ac%a7%e9%98%b3%e8%af%a2a%e8%a1%8c%e4%b9%a6a%e5%8d%83%e5%ae%87%e6%96%87a635_442.jpg ) characters . 
  the top to bottom rule actually seems to be very unstable in handwritten characters which have three horizontals , though it of course depends on who 's writing . 
  but yes , that \u5e74 is probably a better example . 
  \u751f is just the three horizontal character that came to mind first . 
  edit : by the way , i just started studying \u884c\u4e66 a month or so ago , so i 'm still very new and possibly misunderstand a few things . 
  communists believe that the government is chosen by the people . 
  the people `` chose '' the communist party during the revolution . 
  what the chinese government does not like is western liberal democracy and voting , but they very likely believe that they are chosen by the people and would have no problem with the quoted statement . 
  oh , they definitely know and give zero shits , but that does n't stop them from using the old propaganda when it 's convenient . 
  and that old propaganda is what makes statements like `` rulers should be chosen '' completely harmonious , as long as they 're chosen with chinese characteristics . 
  i know some people who sign up for class , then do n't go and work full-time , so if you 're willing to take the risk , you should be able to work illegally . 
  how much make depends on how much you can charge a class and how many students you can get , or if you can find a flexible part-time job that pays well ( probably not if you do n't have ideas already ) . 
  just pick a university you want to go to and can afford , or follow a good part-time evening job if you find one . 
  my friends who work on the student visa pay 7000rmb to sign up for class and get the visa , just to give you an idea of what to expect . 
  how much chinese can you speak already ? 
  hustling for jobs is a lot easier if you speak some chinese and are white . 
  the other big consideration of having a group of people who know you teach and refer students to you , so if you already have that where you are now , you should consider staying put . 
  mostly in english . 
  fandoms ? 
  mostly in english . 
  those tear-worthy shipfics written by 12 year old girls involving jacob and harry potter ? 
  english . 
  youtube . 
  what do you like ? 
  philosophical debates/religious debates ? 
  english . 
   i have a feeling that there 's a lot of confirmation bias going on here . 
  yeah , even little hungarian has plenty of snape/harry [ fanfic ] ( http://fanfic.hu/merengo/ ) , surely it 's not as english dominated as op thinks .
