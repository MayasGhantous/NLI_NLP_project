  i ca n't offer a better explanation as to why , though . 
  maybe / u/keyilan knows . 
  i do n't know what i 'm more scared of , the racism of / r/china , or the chance that this new sub will become a hangout for / r/asianmasculinity . 
  choosing between ccjers and amers is a tough call . 
  it 's redpill , just more creepy and for asians . 
  lots of discussion happens about asian females with white guys ( aka sexpats ) . 
  like this [ post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/asianmasculinity/comments/35jq1n/why_white_sexpats_hate_asian_men/ ) ( +30 ) . 
  oh by the way , [ all white guys are referred to as sexpats ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/asianmasculinity/comments/3efvuc/suggestion_instaban_sexpats/ ) . 
  even legit posts sometimes get called sexpats if they 're not 100 % aligning with the redpill bullshit inferiority complex shared by most of the sub . 
   what 's with asian dude 's tendency to set asian woman up with loser white dudes ? 
  sometimes this tendency seems natural and subconscious . 
  no other race seem to have this cuckold tendency . 
  i do n't even know what they 're talking about sometimes . 
  cuckold tendency ? 
  there 's another post on the front page talking asian hoes . 
  i bet she 's not hoeing it up with an asian guy . 
  [ oh ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/asianmasculinity/comments/3gv8o2/how_to_react_when_asian_hoes_act_like_hoes_around/ ) , it 's a white guy , big surprise . 
  did you know / r/china is a big sub because everyone there works two hours a day because they 're sexpats ? 
  [ well it 's true ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/asianmasculinity/comments/3h9vmw/whats_an_alternative_to_rchina/cu5padk ) . 
  actually , [ that whole thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/asianmasculinity/comments/3h9vmw/whats_an_alternative_to_rchina/ ) has a few gems . 
  from this [ thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/asianmasculinity/comments/38n9q8/boycott_online_dating_especially_in_the_west/ ) ( +18 ) :, 
   if you participate in online dating in the west , you 're simply putting the white pussy on the pedestal . 
  then there was this [ manifesto ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/asianmasculinity/comments/3ge155/how_to_dominate_a_small_towns_hookup_cultures/ ) , but to be fair someone else called him out on it being rapey . 
  i 'm going to go take a shower after clicking through there . 
  actually , now that you made me think about it , i 'll stick with / r/china . 
  i think / r/china has improved a lot over the last year , but it 's not exactly the most civil place . 
  there are some commenters whose posts can seem very anti-china , especially to people who do n't live there , and that spills over a little into racism sometimes . 
  i would n't call it a racist sub , but if you go looking for it it 's not too hard to find . 
  i browse / r/china fairly often , i just do n't have too much to say about it most of the time . 
  most of my discussion goes on on wechat . 
  / r/china is expat dominated , and a lot of the posters are bitter and there 's in general a lot of negativity . 
  it used to be worse , and there was a survey and lots of complaining . 
  one of the biggest issues with / r/china is that there 's a lot of mod overlap with china circlejerk , whichever subreddit they 're using now . 
  and as you 'd expect , an expat circlejerk about china is racist . 
  yeah , i know they 're joking and venting , whatever , it 's a far cry from / r/coontown or something , but it 's not a pretty place . 
  and a lot of people think that china needs a more diverse group of mods , not just the circlejerk squad . 
  it all blew up in reddit drama fashion a while back ( months ? 
  a year ? 
  i do n't know ) , so that 's what you 're missing . 
  also , postnationalism has drama with pretty much everyone . 
  i remember them trying to call out people on / r/china for the racism a few times , but i do n't know what actually got them banned . 
  no , for the vast majority , literally nothing sticks besides `` hello '' and maybe the numbers . 
  the education system is not geared towards learning a language . 
  they memorize lists of words , without knowing how to pronounce them , write them down , and then forget them . 
  at nicer schools the situation is different , but even people educated in better chinese universities generally ca n't hold a conversation unless they went to an international school , had a tutor , majored in english , or are exceptionally more motivated than most chinese students . 
  most of the english teachers at the high school i work at are about b1 , a few of them worse , and they 're the ones who majored in english . 
  i think the wenzhounese glossika course is almost out . 
  glossika.com says it 's in post-production . 
  last night i walked by a table of ~ 20 year old men , who then yelled yangguizi at me instead of the typical laowai . 
  walking down buxingjie is what i did to get that . 
  edit : it 's also not uncommon for people to just start stroking and commenting on my skin . 
  it freaked me out at the beginning , but at this point i just accept it the same i do `` your chinese is so good '' or `` are you used to chinese food ? '', 
  for what purpose are you anglifying it ? 
  where you 're sending it will affect the format . 
  this should get you started , at least .

  if you want an easy first language , esperanto is probably the best choice . 
  if you 're turned off by constructed languages ( which you should n't be , because esperanto has a good number of speakers and a lively culture ) afrikaans or norwegian/swedish might be good choices . 
  i lived near keleti in a one-bedroom apartment for 60,000 huf a month . 
  it was across the road from the park , good subway connections , not too swarmed/price inflated by tourists . 
  i would recommend that area , but budapest has lots of great areas . 
  210,000 is a fairly normal wage in budapest . 
  it 's decent , but you wo n't be living it up . 
  this was last year . 
  it was difficult to find an apartment at that price with a landlord who speaks more than hungarian , but they 're out there . 
  i ended up finding mine through a german language website , because i could n't find anything cheap enough through the english ones . 
  yeah , mandarin speakers can be a bit mumbly sometimes , but it 's still way slower than spanish or german . 
  see winnai 's post for details . 
  i always tell my students ( of english , not japanese ) , that they can ask what to say , how to say it , when to say it , who to say it to , and where to say it , but why is almost always the wrong question when learning a language . 
  it is how it is because that 's how japanese people use it . 
  one of my friends is a train driver , usually driving between anhui and shanghai . 
  he seems competent enough and does n't complain about anything you would n't expect . 
  not that one person 's perspective is that helpful , but i 'd rather be with idiots in a train than a plane anyway . 
  the philipines is the only one that comes to mind . 
  but i do n't think that 's what most people are talking about when they refer to english as the international language . 
  yes , it 's an official language in many countries , but more importantly it 's the de facto trade language for large-scale business and diplomacy in many places where it is n't an official language . 
  that trend was certainly started by the british , but without the continued importance of english after the fall of the british empire and the start of american hegemony , english would have had more trouble keeping its prestige . 
  take either britain or the us away and the situation would be very different . 
  now though , i think english has almost reached critical mass in europe , to the point that britain and the us could both disappear and english would probably stay the most important language in the eu . 
  i receive emails from gmail addresses all the time and have never had any problems that i 'm aware of . 
  looking at practice tests , i could pass hsk 5 but certainly not hsk 6 at this point . 
  my chinese is b1 , maybe b2 on a good day , if i 'm using the cef as tested by cambridge ( fce , cae , etc. 
  ) , the goethe institute or dele . 
  there 's no way in hell i could pass a proper c1 test in mandarin , but i 'd feel pretty confident walking into the hsk 5 next round . 
  [ here are some estimates from people who know more than i do . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hanyu_shuiping_kaoshi#estimates_of_equivalent_cefr_levels ), 
  i tend to agree with the french association estimates , but i see where the german association is coming from . 
  the hanban estimates are nonsense , and i do n't know how they justify it . 
  nothing fits . 
  i 'm feeling more the badlinguistics legend who claimed they would balkanize our homelands .
