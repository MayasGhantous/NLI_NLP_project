  you can find anything if you look hard enough and ignore etymological dictionaries . 
  i saw it when it came out . 
  lost in thailand was much better , but if you enjoyed the first one you might as well watch lost in hong kong too . 
  it was n't awful , just very average . 
  except for the recurring helmet bit , that was just awful . 
  definitely cherokee for me : beautiful writing system ; six tones , which distinguish lexical items and can also have grammatical functions ; over 2,000 verb forms , which inflect to agree with subjects and objects , for aspect , voice , and whether or not you saw it yourself , and sometimes the shape of the object . 
  the high-pitched nasalized stress on the last syllable of most every word gives the language a very pleasant rhythm . 
   everyone seems to know english . 
  total nonsense unless you 're in the netherlands or scandinavia . 
  there are plenty of jobs in germany , the mediterranean , eastern europe , etc. 
  they 're not as easy to get as jobs in asia or latin america , and the pay to cost of living ratio is generally not great for the grunt jobs , but they 're definitely there . 
  even a lot of young , educated `` english-speaking '' germans ( of whom there are fewer than most people think ) want lessons to improve when they are about to move or start a job working with native english speakers all the time . 
  eh , i can do the majority of that in german and i 'm c1 . 
  those things are n't really tested by cefr at any level . 
  i 'd say a lot of what you 're talking about is becoming more native-like . 
  cefr is about how well you can use the language in academic or professional contexts . 
  whether you sound native-like or not , feel comfortable or not , `` blend in '' with natives , can eavesdrop , etc. 
  is not tested much . 
  all languages and dialects are equally capable of expressing abstract thought . 
  and just curious , what part of the essay made you ask this ? 
  edit : found it , i think . 
   it is sometimes said that they alone make the vocabulary of english uniquely rich , which is what robert mccrum , william cran and robert macneil claim in the classic the story of english ( 1986 ) : that the first load of latin words actually lent old english speakers the ability to express abstract thought . 
  mcwhorter definitely does n't support that claim , nor would any respectable linguist . 
  he brought it up to highlight the perception of latin loanwords in english , i think . 
  yes , it 's not very common in the united states , and it 's used almost exclusively in military contexts . 
  clicking is fairly rare in bantu languages , and used to be completely non-existent . 
  they are borrowed sounds from the khoisan languages , which have far more clicks than zulu or xhosa . 
  from the first sentence of the [ wikipedia article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/khoisan_languages ) :, 
   the khoisan languages ( / \u02c8k\u0254\u026as\u0251\u02d0n / ; also khoesan or khoesaan ) are the languages of africa that have click consonants but ** do not belong to other language families ** . 
  there 's actually no proof the khoisan languages are related to each other , much less to bantu languages . 
  i think it 's a good idea , but the ratio of beginners to competent speakers seems very high . 
  turn off the part of your brain that internalizes/learns from what you read before you go there . 
  being chinese does n't qualify you to know the differences between believe/trust or hope/expect in english any more than being american qualifies me to know the difference between chinese words with similar meanings . 
  sure , i think writing systems are fascinating , and excluding logographic scripts , most take a few days max to learn . 
  the only real use is that i can go almost anywhere in the world and be able to read the street names or recognize brand names , cognates , etc. 
  which is surprisingly useful , as i found out recently flying through russia for the first time . 
  i can read the latin alphabet , greek alphabet , arabic script , hebrew script , cyrillic , chinese characters , the korean alphabet , hiragana , tengwar , and the cherokee syllabary . 
  i feel like i 'm missing a major script or two from south or southeast asia , but i 've never dabbled in a language from there or been , so as of yet have had no reason to . 
  but i do n't really understand you saying `` i can read and write in a few writing systems . '', 
  read and write what ? 
  you can sound it out sure , i guess that 's reading in a way . 
  but what can you write in a writing system if you do n't know a language that uses it ? 
  like me and the korean alphabet : maybe i could write the names of my favorite starcraft players , but without knowing korean , there 's not much to write . 
  you could write a haphazard list of morphemes which may or may not make sense . 
  i 'm not sure that 's writing in a much more meaningful sense than using letters to write nonsense in another language . 
   a few weeks to learn how they should be put together, 
  i think you 're underestimating the difficulty of learning idiomatic , grammatical chinese , whether you leave the pronunciation out of it or not . 
  i 'm guessing because the most common greeting , szia , is not a german loan . 
  or because the map colors are indicating the family of the language spoken there , not the origin of their greeting . 
  either way . 
  \u4e0d\u65b9\u4fbf is a very versatile one . 
  do n't want to go to the store ? 
  \u4e0d\u65b9\u4fbf teacher asks you to stand up in class but you 're busy masturbating ? 
  \u4e0d\u65b9\u4fbf had too much baijiu and wo n't be at work in the afternoon ? 
  using `` inconvenient '' too much in english is a common chinglish problem , as well . 
  good explanation , but remember you 're explaining this to someone who still is n't clear on what an object is . 
   object in grammatical description does n't mean literal physical things . 
  basically it means a __________ ( noun or noun-like ___________ ) that is not the subject in reference to a __________ verb , and in reference to a __________ verb it will be the ___________ ( the non-indirect-object object ) ___________ . 
  edit : do n't know why the quote is bolding , and i ca n't stop it at the moment . 
  not sure how to take this response , but my second example is a scene from the movie \u90a3\u4e9b\u5e74 , in case that was what you were omging about . 
  when people do n't reach their communicative goals in a conversation , if one person is a foreigner , that 's likely what people will blame it on , and the problem they will try to fix by talking to you like an idiot , switching languages , whatever . 
  some cultures are much worse about this than others , and i 'm a little surprised you 're posting this about being in germany , because they 're the least likely to do this of anywhere i 've lived ( maybe mexico was slightly better ) . 
  it 's still a problem , though , and it pisses me off like crazy if it happens a lot * cough * china , spain * cough * . 
   if i treated foreigners the way i am treated in china in my own country i would be called racist . 
  i 've honestly never seen anyone in the us or europe treat foreigners like chinese people do . 
  not saying westerners are great with foreigners or anything . 
  there are some westerners who can be as hateful as some chinese people , and that 's certainly racist , but i have literally had to change the way i think about and use the word ignorance after living in china and hearing the conversations seemingly normal people casually have about me when they see me . 
   reaaaaally slowly . . 
  do n't forget really loudly . 
  it helps foreigners understand if you yell, 
  as far as chinese/taiwanese high school romance movies go , it 's one of the best and most widely seen . 
  it 's a good movie and a visible part of chinese pop culture , but if you do n't like that genre i doubt it will change your mind . 
  i think b2 is a good level to start picking up another language . 
  b2 is when doing things like reading , watching movies , talking to people , etc. 
  can become the biggest part of how you learn . 
  you can actually have fun with the language , so it wo n't divide your dedicated study time as much as it would if you were at a lower level . 
  it would be better for you and probably make the users feel better about helping you if you attempted to write the sentences yourself and looked for feedback/corrections . 
  i also second the recommendation of lang-8 for this kind of thing . 
  it 's a very useful resource . 
  my first two semesters we did hansen and quinn , and the third semester we were reading lysias . 
  what is your professor doing that you find unorthodox ? 
  white people in the west are the beneficiaries of structural racism , which plays a large role in the development of the kind of person you 're describing , especially the feeling of entitlement . 
  you did n't make it seem like all white people were like that , which would have been problematic . 
  if you see someone being a raging racist , they are almost always a member of a dominant/supremacist ( in the race/gender studies meaning of the word , not `` white supremacist '' supremacist ) group , whatever that is in the country/situation in question . 
  do n't take their point , it 's shitty apologetics by people who do n't know better . 
  as someone who studied classics , i want to play devil 's advocate a bit . 
  why not learn another romance language ? 
  you 'll get the big majority of those words and their core meanings , equally applicable across dozens of languages , plus get the perks of speaking a living language . 
  polar bear cafe, 
   i 'm not going to try shitting in a bottle but kudos if you can . 
  was that what curry recommended ? 
  i thought the idea was you spit the liquor back in the empty bottle all sneaky-like . 
  i would n't shit in a bottle either . 
  i 'd never pull somebody up for saying `` pull somebody up '' , but ... what does that mean , exactly ? 
  give them a ticket ? 
  google says `` cause someone to stop or pause ; check . '', 
  so could i say , the police officer pulled me up because my tag was expired ? 
  i just realized typing that sentence that i would say `` pull somebody over . '', 
  i feel dumb , and that answer is kind of unsatisfying . 
  edit : maybe it is different ?
