  also , everything must be about me all the time . 
  feel free to correct me if i messed up any of the translations . 
  edit : iammatthew beat me to it and did it better . 
  thanks !, 
  i meant the mainland , the prc . 
  people often refer to the mainland as china and taiwan as taiwan in english , but i could have chosen a less ambiguous word . 
  or did i misunderstand something ? 
  i do n't think it has much to do with how old the word is , but rather the length of the vowel preceding the / s / . 
  if it 's a long vowel , you use the \u00df ; if it 's a short vowel , you use ss . 
  i do n't find that particularly ironic either . 
  in australia , speaking french is a connection you share with the other person that 's not shared with most people . 
  in france , it 's unremarkable and is about as good a springboard for friendship as `` we both have hands . '', 
  plebs is a collective noun , and significantly more common in the singular than in the plural . 
  `` i think it 's to distract the [ common people ] ( http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=plebs&amp;la=la# ) '' sounds perfectly fine . 
  the plural is plebes , anyway . 
  edit : or if we want to use the accepted english uses of the word , which makes a lot more sense since we 're speaking english , [ pleb ] ( http://www.dictionary.com/browse/pleb ) is the singular , plebs is plural . 
  she was n't entirely wrong . 
  what she gave you was the plural of the word plebeius ( where we get the word plebeian and thus pleb ) , which is a different word than plebs . 
  she associated the plural with the wrong root word . 
  the first glossika italian course got a lot of flack because people did n't like the speaker 's accent , but i have n't heard any complaints about the new one . 
  i think glossika is some of the best intermediate material out there . 
  it 's a little dry for some people , but if you have the focus and discipline , it 's very effective . 
   but can it be said that our ideology is wrong ? 
  sure , our ideology is wrong . 
  we think everyone will benefit from liberal democracy and/or anti-communists , and history has shown time and time again that most of the places we go into do n't . 
  to me , liberal democracy seems like a way of pretending to give people a fair share of power without actually taking it away from the wealthy . 
  plus , the success of western countries ( and thus liberal democracy as a system ) still rides largely on economic exploitation of the resources or labor of less developed nations . 
  usually not enforced by the state directly , but by private businesses . 
  it 's also why the us gets so upset about other countries nationalizing resources : it means private ( western ) companies ca n't get in on the action and bring money from someone else 's oil/rocks/labor / whatever back to the us . 
  all that being as it may , replace the west and liberal democracy with china and governments with chinese characteristics and i ca n't imagine it being anything but a disaster . 
  if china gains more power , especially international political power , they 'll be more of a threat than the west very quickly . 
  anywhere between a2 and b2 you 'll get something out of it . 
  if you 're a strong b2 it 'll might be a little too easy for you . 
  i started using the chinese course at about b1 and it was super helpful . 
  this is one of those situations where the best thing to do is download it and try it out , then buy it if you think it 's the right level . 
  what are you on about ? 
  that 's how i was using it anyways . 
  ting_bu_dong is n't a troll , they just think that the west is good because the west is good , and they 're trying to work it out in their head but it keeps getting circular . 
  do n't know why you 're getting downvoted . 
  this is a big issue . 
  abcs see how they 're disadvantaged in the usa , and instead of using that to fuel productive activism and joining with other minorities , they think of themselves as chinese and identify with china . 
  it 's somewhat reminiscent of afro-centrism , but instead of africa , it 's a huge , imperialist , racist state that they identify with . 
  [ this blog ] ( http://countrychinkbroadsides.blogspot.de/2016/07/white-chinese-mandarin-lobotomy.html ) is a good example that was posted in / r/chinese a while back . 
  it 's entitled `` why i 'm against mandarin as a rural chinaman '' , although the author is neither rural nor chinese . 
  i 'd recommend reading through it to see how this western chinese identity and western racism gets mixed up with china the country and white supremacy internationally . 
  it 's convoluted and poorly organized , and not nearly as pro-china as some , but it 's a good example of the confusion and where these nationalistic tendencies can come from imo . 
  that 's a pashtun custom , not a generally muslim one . 
  it was also an ancient greek custom .

  i 'm not sure if you 're an anki person or not , but i have a deck with all the glossika sentences [ here ] ( https://mega.nz/#!y54x2bjb!lrvtill954qqwagrhdyzq1h1qjg50vkfhknvukyuikm ) in case you decide to get it . 
  it 's disorganized and inconsistent , but it 's got the sentences from the fluency and daily course in it . 
  if they 've never typed on a keyboard before , then download an input method that uses handwriting recognition . 
  here 's a [ video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfow02iixoi ) that shows you how to do it . 
  because duolingo does n't make you fluent in a language by itself . 
  their fluency meter is n't that accurate anyways , but even if it were , you 'd need more than the duo course to get anywhere near 100 % . 
  are the creepy dudes a part of the language exchange , or are they in the bar and bother the people doing the language exchange ? 
  my info is a couple of years old , but there are plenty of jobs in spain , especially if you speak spanish and especially if you are willing to work half ( or entirely ) under the table because there are no small number of schools that have a ... creative ... approach to their taxes . 
  but yes , there was still plenty of demand and i doubt the situation has changed that much . 
  the economy sucks about as much as it did then and english certificates still mean more earning potential for the students . 
  do n't expect to make more than 15 euros per classhour from a school , though . 
  you might get lucky , but without a degree , you 'll be looking at the lower-end schools and spain 's not exactly the best place to make money anyway . 
  if you can get private customers , you 'll earn more . 
  i do n't know all the courses , but the ones i 've seen are very naturally translated . 
  the chinese is outstanding and does n't sound englishy at all . 
  the german is quite good as well , though there 's the occasional awkwardness . 
  spanish has a couple of sentences that i would consider `` wrong '' ( still syntactically correct though ) , but it 's only a handful of 3000 . 
  here 's one in german . 
  germans like people with foreign accents selling them stuff . 
  [ have you tried the side bar ? 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/learnjapanese/wiki/index/startersguide ), 
  why not do it on the computer instead of by hand ? 
  a lot of chinese learners also swear by pen and paper , but i have n't seen any evidence that it actually helps . 
  have you seen any studies on it ? 
  it seems like doing dictations on paper would use up a lot of time without necessarily making it more effective . 
  i do everything on the computer and am happy with the results , so i 'm always a little skeptical of the necessity of pen and paper . 
  i use audio technica ath m50x . 
  they sound great , are sturdy , and a fair price for what you get quality wise . 
  i bought them for music , not voices , but they work great just the same . 
  what was your problem with yours ? 
  in what way were they not clear ? 
  i doubt it 's a high priority because there 's nowhere where catalan is enough to survive on if you do n't know spanish ( or french ) . 
  i 've been trying to find an old youtube documentary i saw where a foreigner ( non-spaniard/catalan ) learned catalan but not spanish , and then went through spanish catalunya , andorra and parts of france trying to get around only using catalan . 
  it was quite interesting , but my google-fu is failing me . 
  the welsh version would be `` there 's nowhere where welsh is enough to survive on if you do n't know english . '', 
  it would n't make sense to have a welsh course from spanish , because welsh is not really useful if you do n't already speak english . 
  similar story with catalan . 
  it 's not really useful if you do n't speak spanish . 
  sure , but despite what we might think from browsing the sub , i do n't think duolingo 's main user base is people who start doing it for fun .
