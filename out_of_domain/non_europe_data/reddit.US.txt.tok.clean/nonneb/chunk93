  it 's a language course in an app/on the computer , so it attracts people who want to learn a language for one reason or another . 
  and the reasons for learning a language are usually some practical need or interest . 
  to add to/clarify what lovely is saying , it 's feminine in pretty much every way except that it uses `` el '' in the singular . 
  it agrees with feminine adjectives ( even when using el ) , and uses `` las '' in the plural , las almas . 
  i think this pattern only occurs with feminine nouns beginning with a stressed `` a '' , and is a purely phonological change ( i.e. 
  not like `` la mano '' , which is truly feminine ) , but i 'm not sure if i 'm remembering that correctly . 
  i do n't think it 's that odd . 
  you got a new interest , learned a lot , and hopefully had a good time in spain . 
  people doing bad things does n't always lead to bad results , thankfully enough . 
  in the sixth one , for people who want to find it . 
  i despise learning vocab . 
  i have to disguise it as practicing somehow , usually listening . 
  i use the audio with textbooks as a beginner , which is why i actively avoid books with vocab lists that are n't covered in the dialogues or whatever they 're using . 
  which culture and class do you hate on people for ? 
  someone was complaining about the sub being too slow , so here 's a translation of an article from readmore.de , which is my go-to site for esports news . 
  interview with michael bister at gamescom '16, 
  michael bister : `` the support for starcraft ii is n't there anymore '', 
  today , 4:10 p.m. 
   we at readmore.de are back on site at gamescom 2016 , where we talked to michael bister about the esl championship and the end of starcraft ii, 
   readmore.de : the esl championship was also held at gamescom last year . 
  what has changed for you since then ? 
  actually not much has changed for us at gamescom : we put together the esl arena and our booths on 2000 square meters almost exactly the same as last year , including both our alpha and beta stage . 
  the championship is taking place on a weekend again , as well . 
  the only difference is that we broadcasted cs : go and league of legends at the same time last year . 
  now we have two days we can fill with the games . 
  the counter-strike tournament is being held on saturday , and the league of legends finals are the next day . 
  that way we can show both the semifinals and the finals on the big stage this time . 
   why is n't starcraft ii being held at gamescom ? 
  starcraft ii is in a special position as the tournament will be shown in taketv studios next week . 
  unlike with the other games , the group phase has n't been played yet , so the best eight players are being invited to krefeld and playing from group phase to finals offline on site . 
  we were working with the idea that starcraft ii would be taking part in the esl championship for the last time after a really long run , and we wanted to use the event at taketv to give the game a fitting farewell . 
  take 's studio in krefeld was the obvious choice for a final goodbye , as it helped make the starcraft ii scene big in germany . 
   why did you decide on this course of action ? 
  we looked at the development of not only the viewer numbers from last year , but also of player activity . 
  considering the three or four professional players in germany , the esport athletes made it clear that the the game has already peaked . 
  our hope lay in the current expansion legacy of the void and that the downward trend would change some , but unfortunately that 's not the case . 
  we thought about changing to the archon mod , but that would n't be so simple . 
  the support from the players and publishers is not there any more , so we have to say goodbye to starcraft . 
   could overwatch replace starcraft in the championship ? 
  overwatch is an exciting title , represented at gamescom through tournaments like the atlantic showdown , which we will hold here in the next few days . 
  we also bring the topic up on our esl play site : that way we see from the initial feedback how the game is going so far and whether it will be relevant for us . 
  how does the community look ? 
  how is it played ? 
  at the moment , the game is still very young and has some balance issues . 
  blizzard still ca n't know exactly how the professional scene will react . 
  so i think overwatch is n't ready yet . 
  some things have to be adapted and changed to make the game fair , which is why , at least for this year , it wo n't be played at the championship . 
  we will of course keep an eye on it , and if it looks different next year , the game could be introduced in 2017 . 
   what are the esl 's plans to strengthen the national league ? 
  between 2008 and 2012 , we had an appreciable decrease in viewers and prize money in the eps [ esl pro series ] , but we also see that the championship is growing again . 
  fans becoming more interested in the international scene - esl one , iem grew a lot in that time - really weakened the national leagues . 
  so the esl lost some of its focus on the regional scene . 
  with the change to the championship , we have changed a lot in the other leagues as well . 
  the goal was to provide the individual regional scenes with similar events so that they would reach the same level . 
  in the next few years , we could go so far as to link up the national levels . 
  the german champion would also play against the english or french champion sometimes - copying the champions league style a bit .

  the german champion would also play against the english or french champion sometimes - copying the champions league style a bit . 
   english has firmly cemented its place as the world language , and there 's no way you 'll convince countries all over the world to give up teaching english , a fairly simple language with similarities to so many european languages that is so widely spoken already as a second language , in favour of chinese which has no relation to european and american languages , is incredibly difficult to learn and will only be spoken by people in china and chinese immigrants across the world . 
  we 're already seeing a shift away from english in east asia , where china and korea are reducing the amount of english taught in their schools .
