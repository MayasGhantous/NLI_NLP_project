  you 've = you have . 
  it is correct , although it sounds weird , and i am not sure what patrick has to do with any of this . 
  [ here is a video ] ( http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=06e_1272805182 ) in which another cameraman gets killed . 
  he is filming an attack on an fsb headquaters somewhere in russia ( nalchik ) in ' 05 . 
  he is pinned down by some cars where he gets shot . 
  there is some blood , so this is slightly nsfw/nsfl . 
  shit texas , get it together !, 
  not only that , did n't facebook apps copy all of the phone numbers stored on your phone and send them to their servers ? 
  edit : [ here 's a link .

  and everyone 's favorite : '' [ bing it ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfhuz5qryx4 ) ! '', 
  is n't she blake reynolds now ? 
  i have a huge problem with that . 
  imagine the friends who disregard facebook for privacy concerns , or people who want no online identity . 
  well , you can forget about that because one of your friends could be using said app and involuntarily sharing your personal information with facebook and you do n't even have to sign up . 
  that is pretty scary for me . 
  dropbox is a pretty terrible host to share files on reddit . 
  reddit tends to bring in a lot of traffic , and dropbox only gives you limited bandwidth when you share your files . 
  so once you meet the limit , dropbox can lock your account . 
  at least that is how it used to be , but it might be different now though . 
  but thank you anyway for sharing your collection . 
  there are also an infinite amount of universes in which you are not with her . 
  ( [ including this one . 
  that is basically my first sentence . 
  i am saying they should wait before they post to reddit and see if they can get a more updated screenshot , if their comment is not already deleted . 
  if it is deleted , then go ahead and post the first screenshot before it got erased . 
   iranian nationals, 
  i am guessing this is more towards diplomats or anyone involved with the iranian government . 
  it said they do n't have an embassy there anymore so they wo n't have a safe place to go . 
  i doubt [ mek ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/people's_mujahedin_of_iran ) would go after iranian citizens in canada . 
  same with 4chan . 
  the media and ( everyone else ) think that / b / = 4chan and reddit is being associated with r/jailbait and now r/creepshots . 
  yeah . 
  those are bots . 
  you should never download them , you would only waste bandwidth . 
  only download from trusted uploaders . 
  man , i swear i would break those so easily . 
  it looks like that is made of some sort of cardboard , but man , do those things look cool . 
  they are probably testing a new layout change , and you got selected . 
  are you signed up for any testing stuff on youtube ? 
  seems like you have an addon or some sort of plugin that is blocking you from removing it , or the search engine could be an extension itself . 
  check your plugins and addons and remove any that look suspicious and go to your control panel and then go under programs to uninstall a program and see if you have any crapware installed . 
  it could be a crappy app that installed the search engine in the first place . 
  netanyahu is a lunatic but so is ahmadinejad . 
  when the talibangelist christians did it , no one gave a shit . 
  the article is from yahoo , i do n't even think they are journalists , they are more like bloggers or tabloids . 
  now if we can only pass laws banning the federal government from doing the same ( without a warrant at least ) . 
  i respectfully disagree with, 
   good lpers know the game inside-out, 
  i think that is a load . 
  not everyone who has a good lp is a master of the game they play . 
  nor should they be masters on every game they play . 
  sometimes it is entertaining to watch someone fail at a game . 
  also , many do blind playthroughs of a game and suck at the beginning , but somewhere near the middle they get the hang of the game and own it at the end . 
  it kinda shows that a lper who is generally good in one game can suck in another . 
  i also agree and disagree with your point on personalities . 
  there has to be a ratio . 
  i mean , people do n't just watch lps for the game . 
  if they did , they would watch an lp with only game sounds and no voice . 
  people watch lps for the game , and also for the personality of the person playing the game . 
  what directory are they running from ? 
  if they are running from appdata , you should probably remove them . 
  you could also get something like wireshark and see what they are connecting to if they are connecting to the internet . 
  iexplore.exe is the name of internet explorer 's exe file . 
  ehh , the ones born in those countries ( the west ) seem to be happy , but they tend to be more moderate . 
  the ones that are n't happy seem to be the one 's born in the poorer countries of the mid east , southeast asia , and africa . 
  also , since there are a lot of events happening in their home countries , immigrants move to western countries , but they still do n't feel happy . 
  things are too different and too liberal for the more extreme sects of islam , and you see a lot of protests and protesters that demand that some of those western countries reform their laws to suit their views of islam , but luckily it is not all muslims that are demanding reform . 
  / r/atheism is not the voice of all atheists on reddit . 
  there are other atheist subreddits that are n't , in your words , `` childish '' like / r/atheism . 
  there are / r/agnostic , / r/trueatheism , / r/debatereligion , / r/debateanatheist , / r/freethought , / r/humanism , / r/secularhumanism , and / r/youngatheists . 
  the default subreddits tend to be just be a dumping ground for crap . 
  you should seek out some of the smaller subreddits for better content . 
  some people said he might have broken in to steal stuff to maybe buy drugs , or to just get the money from the stuff , because it 's his aunts house and he would know where valuable stuff is at , but what if he just wanted to kill his aunt ? 
  probably the js blocker . 
  i think using a sandbox is a little troublesome . 
  i mean , chrome already sandboxes its plugins . 
  even then , you can do click to play plugins . 
  so all that is left is javascript really and that extension solves it . 
  chrome is pretty secure , so unless you are n't very careful about the sites you visit , you do n't need excessive protection . 
  good idea . 
  texas . 
  around dallas specifically . 
  or could it possibly be the woman on the far right , or maybe the woman , if there is one , behind robin ? 
  you should n't have mentioned reddit . 
  you should 've at least mentioned non-biased , or rather minimal-biased , news sources . 
  too many misinformed and extremely biased news articles make it to the front page of reddit . 
  you should rather mention some sources directly like npr or the christian science monitor . 
  i am glad though , that the conversation turned out fine . 
  i would n't have made my point across as nicely as you . 
  i think in haiti , people would get poisoned by a toxin that would paralyze them and slow their heart rhythm to the point where they could be pronounced clinically dead , so some were buried alive . 
  i wonder if something similar is happening here . 
  it 's the daily mail . 
  i could actually link them , but i was feeling a bit lazy , but thank you for the tip . 
  they are kinda like fox news but based in the uk . 
  they are biased , hypocritical and they exaggerate , editorialize , and make their articles sensational . 
  he can use these two websites to help him get ideas and how to debunk some of the stuff that might be mentioned at church . 
  the [ skeptics annotated bible ] ( http://skepticsannotatedbible.com/ ) , and [ rationalwiki ] ( http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/main_page ) . 
  it felt like someone ran into my room and tripped .
