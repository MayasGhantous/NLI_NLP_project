  paid leave , pshhh !, 
  more like on paid vacation !, 
  what a bastard . 
  i feel nothing . 
  popular searches are going to be on there , and stuff like recent music and popular channels and products are going to be on there as soon as you type a letter . 
  there is no reason to feel that bad about it . 
  as long as the stuff i want to watch is on youtube , i am content . 
  anti-abortion , pro killing children . 
  yeah , i kinda know what you go through , except my person is n't as extreme as your great uncle . 
  i have to deal with the usual right wing crap , like anti-abortion , pro bible , pro military , and nationalistic stuff for the us and mexico . 
  it 's kinda weird because she 's mexican , and its weird for a teenage mexican to be right wing . 
  usually the mexicans i know do n't really care for politics , or tend to be democratic or independent . 
  the best thing you can do is unsubscribe from your great uncle , or just remove him completely and deal with him getting mad at you for unfriending him . 
   from there , they send unsolicited instant messages along the lines of `` lol is this your new profile pic ? '', 
  followed by a url . 
  clicking the link downloads a zip file containing malicious executable files , which sophos has detected as troj/agent-ycw or troj/agent-ydc . 
  that 's not exploiting skype . 
  that 's exploiting dumb people . 
  flashgot work for you ? 
  it 's really unnecessary to use it by default . 
  https is preferred in areas where you have to log in , or you have to deal with sensitive info like credit cards and banking stuff . 
  https is used each time you log into reddit . 
  i assume pay.reddit.com is part of reddit 's paying forms or something dealing with an exchange of currency through reddit and they use https to encrypt traffic . 
  i mean , unless you really want to encrypt your traffic on reddit , you do n't need the https . 
  if you want to always use https on major sites get something like [ https everywhere ] ( https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere ) for chrome and ff and [ https finder ] ( https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/https-finder/ ) for ff . 
  yeah , it 's owned by an ad company . 
  i would n't trust it either . 
  he needs to get rid of it and get [ fanboy 's ultimate annoyances list ] ( https://secure.fanboy.co.nz/adblock/r/fanboy-ultimate.txt ) . 
  it 'll block what ghostery will . 
  i would like to add to op 's list . 
  [ https finder ] ( https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/https-finder/ ) is an addon to https everywhere . 
  [ cookie monster ] ( https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/cookie-monster/ ) deals with cookies . 
  [ betterprivacy ] ( https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/betterprivacy/?src=ss ) deals with `` super-cookies '' like cookies left over by adobe flash that are hard to get rid of . 
  and an optional [ web of trust ] ( https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/wot-safe-browsing-tool/?src=search ) that shows website ratings in terms of stuff like security , reliability , privacy . 
  other than those , op is pretty good , unless he wants to go one up and get a vpn or some sort of ssh tunnel to be even more private . 
  i do n't know about op , but my biggest gripe with the latest ff ui , is that i want the navigational buttons to look like the old circa ff 10 with the back arrow being larger than the forward arrow , and i want the buttons to have a shape . 
  i want it to look like the current palemoon installation instead of the latest firefox . 
  [ basically i want the top , instead of the bottom , like so ] ( http://i.imgur.com/nzqoo.jpg ) . 
  wait until tomorrow morning to post it again . 
  one thing that proves evolution is the common cold and the different seasonal flu 's . 
  many strains of the flu evolve and you need to get shots every year to prevent the most common flu in your area . 
  hell , many flu 's and colds evolve and become resistent to medicine and so they become more `` powerful . '', 
  [ that has happened with gonorrhea as well ] ( http://abcnews.go.com/health/wellness/super-gonorrhea-scientists-discover-antibiotic-resistant-std/story?id=14027745 ) . 
  science ca n't say how life began , but it can show , and has shown how life has changed and flourished . 
  if they say god has created life , ask them which one , and which creationist story they are sticking with . 
  chances are they say evolution is false because they do n't really know what it is and they just repeat what they hear from preachers and whatnot . 
  you will probably not convince them that evolution is real . 
  one of 'em is an old dude !, 
  the bottom left is a sports illustrated model named [ irina shayk ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/irina_shayk ) and i think middle right is english model [ gemma atkinson ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gemma_atkinson ) . 
  wow , that is freaking terrible . 
  i did n't know that chrome would even do this . 
  i get that there was a challenge to hack chrome and that it was hacked , but the should n't force an update on you this way . 
  it should be up to you when to restart your browser . 
  i guess , this is the only time i 'm happy to be on chromium developer builds and have to manually install updates . 
  could it be that the browser is crashing , but then again , there would be an error message , and it probably would n't re-open . 
  4 of those months were due to him breaching a previous sentence according to [ this source ] ( http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/news/s/1590965_jailed-man-who-wore-anti-police-t-shirt-on-day-pcs-fiona-bone-and-nicola-hughes-were-shot ) . 
  does anyone know if this affects beta ? 
  i have been using 16 beta since 15.0 came out . 
  to them , secularism is the killing and removal of religion . 
  i hate the new themes . 
  they are locked to chrome-like window borders , and they do n't blend well whenever you have any other visual styles installed on windows 7 . 
  i use 11.64 and older skins instead of the newer themes , on version 12.02 because i like the transparency that the old skins had . 
  maybe you should give some of them a go , and i do n't see how themes would slow down the browser . 
  that is weird . 
  edit : added a few things and changed the aero window borders to chrome like window borders . 
  what the hell do they mean they no longer do this ? 
  i 'm sure many schools have this stupid pledge and recite it every morning . 
  are they being changed back pre - '54 or are christians bitching about nothing again ? 
  indoctrination is a hell of a drug . 
  those are the average comments on every dubstep song . 
  someone mentions skrillex and the arguments will go on forever . 
  this guy is pulling logical fallacies out of his ass . 
  i only got ten minutes in before i turned it off . 
  he said this though : around 06:42 he said that the people cared about manuscript so much so that it never changes as opposed to any other literature written and that the bible is the pretty much the same today as it was 500 years ago . 
  he also claims that the dead sea scrolls found in the qumran caves in 1947 were 1000 years older than any other known manuscript and that it is about 95 percent the same as the standard hebrew bible today . 
  he did n't cite any sources . 
  i meant to add that i am on 12.02 , but i use 11.64 and older `` skins '' instead of 12.00 + `` themes '' . 
  i was thinking he looks a bit like andy samberg . 
  i meant in terms of aesthetics . 
  see how old skins have transparency as opposed to the new themes ? 
  [ here is what i mean ] ( http://i.imgur.com/sh2dy.jpg ) . 
  bottom is opera 12.02 using an old 11.64 skin and the top is opera next using a random 12.00 theme . 
  themes are locked to their own window manager and by that i mean the minimize , maximize , and close buttons . 
  skins are n't . 
  skins are flexible on visual styles . 
  you can see i tried a new visual style [ here ] ( http://i.imgur.com/znwim.jpg ) and it uses the visual style 's minimize , maximize , and close button instead of whatever is locked to the theme . 
  sorry if this does n't make much sense . 
  i just do n't like the fact that themes change the minimize , maximize and close buttons . 
  i want opera to use the default visual style 's . 
  you do n't need to burn it . 
  you just get a virtual drive program like [ wincdemu ] ( http://sourceforge.net/projects/wincdemu/ ) and you `` mount '' the iso , which is like inserting a virtual cd/dvd ( the iso ) into a virtual cd/dvd drive ( which is where wincdemu comes in handy ) . 
  if you would like to just give them a cd , you just get something like [ cdburnerxp ] ( http://cdburnerxp.se/ ) and click on burn an iso . 
  remember to burn at a low speed , because sometimes burning isos at high speeds can cause errors , at least that is the case when burning operating systems . 
  if you do n't have an . iso , and you have the installation files , you can just put it on a usb and let them borrow the usb to install the program . 
  holy shit . 
  he really is an atheist . 
  in this case , religion is their drug . 
  i do n't think dumping motor oil into their yard like that is legal . 
  if i recall i only know about religious christian organizations that do edit books to fit their christian ideology . 
  anything from science books to history books .
