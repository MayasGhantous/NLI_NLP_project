  if they wo n't read a simple paragraph of ideas contradicting of theirs , you wo n't be able to reasonably argue with them . 
  are the first four things checked off when you try to erase your cache , when you do the ctrl + shift + del alternate on mac ? 
  or are you trying to say you want to get rid of the omnibox ? 
  if you want to get rid of the omnibox forever , under privacy in the settings , you 'll want to untick `` use a prediction service to help complete searches and urls typed in the address bar '' . 
  first of all you should be wary of services offering free vpn services , because what do they gain for allowing you to use their services for free ? 
  especially when it comes to allowing peer to peer . 
  there are [ expat shield ] ( http://www.expatshield.com/ ) ( uk ip based ) and [ hotspot shield ] ( http://www.anchorfree.com/hotspot-shield-vpn-download-windows.php ) ( us ip based ) . 
  these are more for general browsing and when you just need access to us or uk based services . 
  these should n't be used for stuff like p2p . 
  there is [ vpnreactor ] ( https://www.vpnreactor.com/ ) which you can only use every other 30 minutes before you have to take a 30 minute break , so this kinda sucks for everything . 
  it does n't block p2p ports though . 
  the last free vpn service still running that i have used is called [ privitizevpn ] ( http://privitize.com/ ) which is a little sketchy . 
  they have no working ` about us ' page . 
  this is the free vpn which is the blue `` anonymous download '' link on the pirate bay next to magnet links . 
  the service is great for p2p , and i have n't run into any time limits nor bandwidth limits . 
  it 's a bit slow when you go on the internet though . 
  connections sometimes fail , so use it carefully . 
  you should check out that vpnbook one that others have pointed out . 
  i am going to as well . 
  sorry if these services are n't what you are looking for . 
  i just thought i would review ones that are free and i have used recently . 
  malwarebytes and mse did n't show up anything .

  how is this justice ? 
  so his girlfriend broke up with him , and he won the lottery after ? 
  what if she left him because he was an asshole ? 
  i read from [ another source ] ( http://darien.patch.com/articles/jennings-charges-dropped-because-the-cabbie-hid-the-knife ) of another reason he screwed himself over . 
  the cab driver held evidence from police . 
  he did n't turn over the knife for five months , he kept it instead . 
  more sources that back this up : [ 1 ] ( http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/charges_dropped_against_morgan_stanley_4yypwa2kqqipnw0rrgg2mi ) , [ 2 ] ( http://darien.dailyvoice.com/police-fire/charge-dropped-against-darien-man-taxi-incident ) , [ 3 ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-15/ex-morgan-stanley-executive-s-stabbing-charges-dropped.html ), 
  i know some that use facebook as `` you go to my school '' or `` you live in the same city as me '' list . 
  i shit you not , one girl said her phone got messed up and so she got a new one and later posted a comment asking for the people that know her to send her their numbers . 
  i find it weird having to ask your friends list on facebook if they know you , to send you their numbers . 
  it probably means they have a ton of people they do n't know on their facebook . 
  at times it feels like the only thing facebook is for is to fill people 's egos . 
  there 's just something about people that they need to keep adding strangers to increase their facebook friends list . 
  i doubt that those people will ever interact with probably 70 % of their friends list . 
  it 's the phrase `` if you know me '' that gets to me . 
  obviously there is nothing wrong with losing your contacts and posting in your wall asking for their numbers . 
  it 's just that , how diluted with people you do n't know , is your friends list on facebook that one has to mention `` if you know me '' ? 
  are n't there like sleeves for cards that block rfid waves , or even metallic wallets that block rfids ? 
  seems like that can be an option if you do n't want to damage your card . 
  anyone have the citation for that study ? 
  i do n't see any . 
  i was obsessed with this movie when it came out . 
  i always told my parents to rent it whenever they had a chance . 
  i also enjoyed [ dante 's peak with pierce brosnan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dante%27s_peak ) that came out a year after twister did . 
   please bear in mind that reactos 0.3.14 is still in alpha stage , meaning it is not feature-complete and is not recommended for everyday use . 
  they are n't really actively developing it . 
  i remember reading that they had a problem with funds . 
  i also remember reading that the developers they have , are n't working on it as much as they could . 
  it looks like duct tape , and that shit wo n't come off easy . 
  his monitor is going to be sticky for a while . 
  it was on public land i think and it was being funded by taxes . 
  it is probably disrespectful to people of other faith who serve in the military because not everyone who is in the military is christian . 
  someone once told me , `` thank god it 's friday . '',

  what amazing things does germany has that no other western country has or comes close to having ? 
  there was no evidence that the romans had a salute like the fascists or nazis did in the 20th century . 
  they were just painted like that . 
  also punchline in the title . 
  i agree with anon on downloading malwarebytes and doing a full scan on safe mode . 
  there is also another option that you can use . 
  you can download this program called [ autoruns ] ( http://filehippo.com/download_autoruns/ ) and let it scan everything that runs whenever you start your computer and log in . 
  from there you can click on the `` logon '' tab and examine what programs start run when you log in . 
  it shows you the descriptions , the program publishers , and the locations of where the programs are on your system when they run at login . 
  you might want to google any suspicious programs that stand out to you by googling the programs description . 
  you have the option to disable them from running at startup by unchecking the box to the very left of the program . 
  since what you have appears to be malware , the malware might not be in a system folder location , it might be hiding in a folder in your appdata folder under c : \\ users \\ ( your account name ) \\ appdata . 
  so check on autoruns if you see any suspicious files running from there at startup , though i ca n't be for certain anything will be there and i do n't know what type of infection you have . 
  that infection could be masking as a legit file so be cautious . 
  do the malwarebytes scan first before you try this method and be careful of the files you disable if you decide to disable any . 
  `` you ca n't believe in nothing . 
  you have to believe in something . '', 
  yeah that kinda sucks . 
  there are only 64 bit builds for linux and bsd , not windows or os x and that goes for both chromium and chrome . 
  firefox is the same where 64 bit is only on linux . 
  seems that 64 bit browsers are n't really in demand at the moment . 
  you would figure there would be now that 64-bit seems to be the default on many consumer laptops and desktops , though a lot of people still use 32 bit computers . 
  but it also seems that browser developers do n't want to release 64 bit builds because of incompatibilities with plugins . 
  many plugins still seem to be 32 bit only . 
  i wish program developers would develop for 64 bit like adobe started doing with flash . 
  anyways , do you really need java on your browser ? 
  most sites seemed to have gotten rid of java by now . 
  though it is weird that it is off center for him . 
  when i got the new layout a few times ago it was all fine and centered for me on both chromium and firefox . 
  it 's a brutal cycle . 
  plugin devs do n't want to build 64 bit plugins because there is a lack of 64 bit builds for chrome and firefox and the browser devs do n't want to build 64 bit browsers because of the lack of 64 bit plugins . 
  though both sides are slowing jumping on the 64 bit bandwagon . 
  ie9 shipped with a 64 bit version in 2009 with windows 7 and adobe flash on 2011 . 
  or a second thing that can be said for number 1 is `` you claim homosexuality is a choice , but is n't following a religion a choice someone makes ? 
  religious people get to have rights as defined by the first amendment , they were n't born believing in a god , so why should n't the lgbt community get rights like the right to get married , as well ? '', 
  though the negative thing about this is that it will subtly reinforce the notion that homosexuality is a choice , but i think it can still be a good question to ask . 
  i hear the claim that homosexuality is `` unnatural '' even though , as you say , it is found in over a thousand species , and those are the only ones that we know about . 
  more homosexuality in species can be found in the future . 
  what if one was to reverse the question and ask `` so homosexuality is unnatural even though it is found in thousands of species , answer me this , why is homosexuality prevalent among different species , but the belief in a god is only found in one ? '',
