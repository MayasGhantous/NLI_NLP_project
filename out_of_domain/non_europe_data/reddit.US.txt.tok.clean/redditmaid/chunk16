  i guess those are kinda like door hinge in which they rhyme with orange but have different spellings . 
  do you also hide behind 7 proxies ? 
  no , but seriously , do you use different ip addresses for different accounts ? 
  if information was to leak , would n't it be convenient if your real ip address was not to be shown , but a fake one ? 
  though the question is which proxies are to be trusted that they wo n't mine your fake data and sell it . 
  and does n't the scapegoat effect take into place ? 
  exactly one group of people is to blame , and if it is n't going to be the jews , then it will be another group , like the bilderbergs , the un , skull and bones , us government , the vatican , the nazis etc. 
  for all , or most of the world 's problems .

  here 's another alternate . 
  there is a portable program called [ floola ] ( http://www.floola.com/home/ ) , and you can stick this on a usb or your ipod and you can use it as a replacement for itunes . 
  it 's been a while since i have last used it on my friends ipod though . 
  you should have a second browser with plugins disabled . 
  if you have the portable tor browser , they should n't be activated , they are disabled , or use their own directories for plugins , instead of your system defaults . 
  what about the christians that support the death penalty ? 
  why do those christians not see that as `` murder '' but abortion is , or does it not really matter because he is `` guilty '' of crimes and deserves death ? 
  what about the one 's that have been found innocent after the fact ? 
  and is n't it still taking someone 's away someone 's life ? 
  i think it does . 
  what if her being pregnant endangers the child , or her own life ? 
  should she risk it , and try to have the child ? 
  what places in the netherlands would you say to stay away from ? 
  and what are some of the smaller cities that are very safe that you would recommend ? 
  i always wanted to travel to europe , and i do want to visit the larger cities , but i also want to walk around the smaller towns and stay away from the city . 
  i would 've told her she was misled , to be honest . 
  he has a point in that we should explore earth some more , because we have n't even explored all of earth 's land yet . 
  we keep finding new species and new man made structures along the way , but what the hell man . 
  mars and nasa are n't a waste of taxpayer money . 
  they are barely even funded today . 
  the wars are the biggest waste of taxpayer money . 
  he should 've criticized that . 
  i know . 
  just because one thing has n't been fully explored , that does n't mean you ca n't explore another thing as well . 
  we should both explore land , and space , because we can . 
  also the seas and lakes , because who knows what lurks down there . 
  not to mention that addons are n't the only one 's that drag the browser down . 
  having lots of tabs open and flash running slow it down . 
  [ palemoon ] ( http://www.palemoon.org/ ) is just as good as waterfox and it is also x64 optimized but it also ships its own 32 bit version . 
  people have said that palemoon is faster than waterfox , because palemoon was built for crappier computers because they strip some stuff off and add some things of their own . 
  it runs pretty fast on my windows xp vm . 
  this is n't only happening in florida , it happens in many states and not all of them are religious schools . 
  these are essentially behavior modification through torture schools . 
  one umbrella u.s. organization that operates these schools are called [ wwasp ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_wide_association_of_specialty_programs_and_schools ) ( world wide association of specialty programs and schools ) . 
  they take ( essentially kidnap ) us children and many times ship them to one of their schools in another state or even overseas . 
  one of their most notorious overseas schools was called [ tranquility bay ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tranquility_bay ) in jamaica .

  religion is just an excuse to legally operate in the more religious states in the us . 
  [ truecrypt ] ( http://www.windows7hacker.com/index.php/2012/01/how-to-use-truecrypt-to-encrypt-the-whole-windows-system/# ! ) . 
  lock down your entire operating system by encrypting your partitions . 
  was n't she the most google 'd teen some year after her pics came out ? 
  that sucks . 
  you can do whatever the hell you want whenever you buy a desktop and laptop , but your rights stop at phones and tablets ? 
  those are personal computers too !, 
  we really do need technological rights reform in the courts . 
  because of lust involved . 
  it is part of the ` seven deadly sins ' , not that that is part of the bible , it is just that they are against them included with all the other shit that is forbidden in the bible . 
  they also do n't want sex to be a ` liberal ' thing , they think that it should be used only for procreation , so it should n't be done just because both of you are horny . 
  same for texas . 
  even if you are n't in a classroom you have to stop in the halls and salute and be even more late to class . 
  you will get yelled at by the admins if you keep on walking . 
  posting that you are about to commit a felony on facebook , this can only go well !, 
  yeah , it is part of the seven deadly sins , but it is still mentioned in the bible and the [ bible condemns it ] ( http://www.openbible.info/topics/gluttony ) . 
  also virtualbox is foss while vmware is proprietary . 
  vmware can do anything they want with their program , while virtualbox is limited to certain open source guidelines , so yeah , virtualbox should be more for casual use , while vmware is more for professional and corporate use , though you can use either program for whatever use you want . 
  what i want to know is how the next person knew to reference ` r/atheism is leaking ' . 
  i assume this is n't his first reply to a religious status . 
  i hear 2.2.1 is also good , though i have n't used utorrent in years . 
  [ qbittorrent ] ( http://www.qbittorrent.org/ ) for linux distros and non copyrighted stuff , [ transmission-qt ] ( http://sourceforge.net/projects/trqtw/ ) for everything else . 
  i know some anti-p2p organizations join trackers to catch file sharers , but i do n't think government agencies care about file sharing , i think someone is file sharing on government computers . 
  i remember when that russian torrent catcher website about two years ago launched and it told you whether or not your ip was linked to any torrents , i remember an article from torrentfreak that said french government ip ranges were logged as sharing files , and i think even one of them was tied to the prime minister . 
  edit : it was last year , and the website was called [ youhavedownloaded ] ( https://www.youhavedownloaded.com/ ) ( the logging is down , but the site is still running ) and the [ allegations were against ] ( https://torrentfreak.com/zut-alors-french-government-deny-bittorrent-piracy-allegations-120101/ ) the then president sarkozy . 
  [ canadian parliament ] ( https://torrentfreak.com/busted-canadian-parliament-hosts-bittorrent-pirates-120101/ ) may also have been involved in file sharing . 
  you are n't trolling when you get paid to do that shit . 
  i mean look at preachers who know they lie , but preach anyway , look at fox news , look at glenn beck , bill o'reilly , rush limbaugh or any other clown on tv or radio . 
  they do it because they get something monetary in return . 
  they appeal to certain masses who will believe them no matter what , or at least most of the time . 
  they then sell them shit , or expect their followers to give them something . 
  did n't aj oversell some of that unneeded and potentially dangerous drug that is supposed to be used in time of radiation fallout after the japenese tsunami and reactor failures ? 
  he also sells a lot of colloidal silver through ads on his sites . 
  those people are n't like / b / who ` troll ' pro bono , and to just to rustle some jimmies , they wo n't waste their time if they are n't going to get something out of it . 
  and i think deep down the longer they spout their lies , the shorter time they will come to believe their own lies as the truth , so they will keep on misleading . 
  or maybe someone went to the city or places with internet , downloaded it and brought it back and distributed it . 
  just unsubscribe man . 
  there are barely any good default subreddits , / r/gaming being one of them . 
  you will never see ads condemning the men who run out on their pregnant girlfriends , or moms who run out on their husbands and leave the kid with the dad , but two loving men or two loving women want to raise a kid , then that is a huge problem . 
  not allowing gays to marry and adopt is n't about sanctity about marriage or any of that other crap , it 's all about `` eww gay people '' . 
  because i do n't want to mix non copyrighted with , well copyrighted stuff . 
  i use transmission with a vpn for music and movies and i use qbittorrent without one to seed linux distros , and this one is running a lot of the time in the background .
