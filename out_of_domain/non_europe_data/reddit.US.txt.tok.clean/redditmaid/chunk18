  dallas voted democrat this year with 57 % of the votes going for obama as opposed to other counties around dallas , and i only had one or two butthurt republicans on facebook . 
  everyone else was pretty happy obama won again . 
  not all texans are ignorant bastards . 
  anyone else think that he looks a bit like david mitchell ? 
  it 's funny how people are quick to say he is done saying shit . 
  i still think he has a few more months in him . 
  stop posting cited facts and logic !, 
  listen to my hearsay . 
  i 'm the one who is right ! '', 
  by `` i am about his other laws , '' does she mean she rejects shit that affects her , and only acceptss the laws that affect people she deems undesirable , like the lgbt community ? 
  obama is n't the socialist middle easterner . 
  that 's jesus . 
  she was probably being tweeted at a lot telling her how dumb and ignorant she was about australia .

  come on !, 
  he has to be trolling or seriously delusional . 
  nacho cheese vs cool ranch . 
  seems like it is the first one . 
  thank you . 
   we define marriage very clearly in the state of texas . 
  so if you have a play that tries to push and promote a different marriage definition , which is clearly illegal, 
  i want to see that legislation where it is illegal to teach about gay marriage . 
  fine on my end . 
  windows 7 , opera 12.11 beta rc build 1653, 
  click on `` other discussions ( 1 ) '' at the top .

  well , atheists also have the lesser known [ scarlet a ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/out_campaign ) . 
  how about milk instead of water giving you half a point ? 
  you could make it like mooshrooms and bowls . 
  just right click on a cow with a bucket , and drink . 
  i do n't think this will be exploited , not unless you want to drag a cow around everywhere you go . 
  you left out an important detail . 
  mirrors !, 
  downloading updates for windows 7 takes hours upon hours . 
  with linux , you can choose mirrors of repositories that are closer to your city and country as opposed to the probably one source of patches and updates for windows . 
  with more download options , that means less people hogging bandwidth and more speed for you . 
  it seems that you can get an up to date system in less than one hour with ubuntu at least . 
  is n't this the exact same quote that miley cyrus caught shit for , for posting it on her twitter by her religious fans ? 
  nope , does n't matter . 
  i think many email hosts keep copies of emails , even after they have been deleted for months . 
  what you should say is do n't do incriminating stuff over services that will gladly handover your data to those who ask i.e. 
  it 's an election year , and it would probably reflect bad on obama 's administration for going after churches right before the election , even if they were violating the law . 
  the republicans would 've used this as the `` war on christianity '' by obama . 
  oh no , i am all for going after the churches that do this , but i was saying that obama probably would n't have allowed the irs to do anything about it at least until after the elections , because he did n't need any bad publicity ( brought upon by himself or his administration ) before the elections . 
  and yeah , the religious right are always going to pull out the victim card every time someone calls them up on their bullshit when they violate the establishment clause . 
  i ca n't speak of many services based in the us that do n't . 
  usually they have to , because they are on us soil , and the government can pull out the `` national security '' card and they are forced to handover info or face the consequences . 
  but yeah , usually many overseas services are the way to go , like vpn providers . 
  also open source software and services are preferred , because many proprietary software can have backdoors or are made in ways for governments to snoop in on conversations like skype . 
  guess `` the gubment ' and the mainstream media are n't the only ones who like censorship . 
  i would n't trust any email providers . 
  [ one canadian based service sent info to the feds ] ( http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2007/11/encrypted-e-mai ) . 
  if you want to do stuff over email , you better encrypt your messages with something like [ gnu privacy guard ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gnupg ) or [ pretty good privacy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pretty_good_privacy ) . 
  i never understood this . 
  why work with things that you know will probably interfere with your religious beliefs ? 
  fucking catholic church , i wish they would be kicked out of ireland and other countries where they push their evil agendas . 
  the usual : `` first amendment : worship anyone you want . 
  first commandment : worship only me . '', 
  so which is it republicans , the secular , everyone 's welcome america , or the ostracizing , christian sharia america ? 
  oh oklahoma , [ you banned islamic sharia law ] ( http://abcnews.go.com/us/media/oklahoma-pass-laws-prohibiting-islamic-sharia-laws-apply/story?id=10908521 ) , now ban your christian sharia as well , or you guys are unamerican for going against the bill of rights . 
  they are so fucking aggressive at going after tax dodgers in places in europe like switzerland even demanding that they release tax documents or face repercussions . 
  if they can do that , then they can go after those faux-christians that preach in the million dollar mega-churches that preach for romney ( and obama ) that violate their tax exemption status . 
  pocket change to them . 
  the make billions at the cost of a few millions . 
  they won either way . 
  i know , i do want the government to be more aggressive about this . 
  but whenever large scale conspiracies like this happen , they hide it well until a screwup and then it is out . 
  the doj did n't investigate until 2006 , but the conspiracy started in 2001 . 
  that is 5 years of them fixing prices . 
  and i guess you are right . 
  it would n't really be justice to punish the companies , when the people who ran it are n't there anymore , though it was five years , and not somewhere like twenty . 
  but again , you are right . 
  if they paid more , it would hurt the lower level employees more , the money would probably come out of the employees checks who did n't know and did n't participate in higher level illicit activities . 
   do the atheists in wisconsin realize they 're going to hell ? 
  essentially telling an atheist that they are going to hell is like telling them to expect coal for christmas .

   and if you make a view like this public you are immediately slandered as an anti-semite, 
  [ there was a resolution passed in california that equates the criticism of israel on college campuses as `` antisemitism '' . 
  ] ( http://leginfo.ca.gov/pub/11-12/bill/asm/ab_0001-0050/hr_35_bill_20120823_amended_asm_v98.html ), 
  the bill ~ ~ prohibits ~ ~ condemns :, 
  \u2022 `` language or behavior [ that ] demonizes and delegitimizes israel ; '', 
  \u2022 `` speakers , films , and exhibits '' that indicate that `` israel is guilty of heinous crimes against humanity such as ethnic cleansing and genocide ; '', 
  \u2022 describing israel as a `` racist '' or `` apartheid '' state ;, 
  \u2022 `` student-and faculty-sponsored boycott , divestment , and sanction campaigns against israel ; '', 
  \u2022 `` denying the jewish people their right to self-determination ; '', 
  \u2022 `` applying double standards by requiring of israel a behavior not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation ; '' and, 
  \u2022 `` actions of student groups that encourage support for terrorist organizations such as hamas and hezbollah . '', 
  i do n't necessarily agree with all the criticisms of israel and stuff like holocaust denial , but i do n't think a country should be free from criticism and nor do i agree with essentially banning opinions . 
  edit : changed `` prohibits '' to `` condemns '', 
  edit 2 : looks i was misled about this bill . 
  it is not a law prohibiting `` antisemitism '' or what could be perceived as antisemitism , just a resolution that is somewhat meaningless , and it does n't prohibit it , it just says not to say those things . 
   question : how the fuck does an affair bring up national security concerns ? 
  blackmail . 
  affairs open you up to being blackmailed . 
  you are putting yourself in a vulnerable position by doing dumb shit like having an affair . 
  if you ca n't keep your private affairs in order , how can you run the cia ? 
  also , secrets were found on her emails which were searched before petraeus 's . 
  and , he is the head of the cia .
