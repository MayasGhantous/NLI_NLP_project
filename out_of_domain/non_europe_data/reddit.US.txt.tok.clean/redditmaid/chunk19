  he does n't get the same type of privacy as the average citizen . 
  do n't forget about [ apathiesm ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/apatheism ) , aka the `` i do n't give a shit whether deities exist or not . '', 
  please do n't link to naturalnews , a known conspiracy theory site . 
  is it weird for you to get erect after watching a naked woman bounce up and down in a pool ? 
  she also had her own porno called `` backdoor to chyna '', 
  no , backdoor to chyna was a real porno directed by a real porn company . 
  the sequel to her sex tape was just bonus footage . 
  it 's a horrible site that posts exaggerated , blatantly false , or misquoted news articles . 
  it is an associate to known liar , alex jones . 
  also , like mrkurtz said , you are just feeding them ad revenue . 
  oh that , well , that part was * obviously * for a `` different culture in a different time , it is not relevant today '' . 
  that really sucks . 
  there are only 64 bit builds for linux , though at least for windows , there are two forks for 64 bit builds , waterfox and palemoon . 
   heroin is not the only pain killer , sugar is not the only sweetener , religion is not the only pacifier . 
  all of these things come with side effects . 
  that is a pretty neat quote . 
  [ i believe some conspiracy theorist interviewed the guy who created the site and said he did it as a joke . 
  ] ( http://12160.info/profiles/blogs/itanimullicom-ltlt-the-facts ) the conspiracy theorist then went full retard and asked the guy if he knew about darpa evil robots and shit . 
  anyways i think it is legal to do that . 
  by that , i mean by a domain and link it to a government website . 
  because rfid tracking is part of that muslim obama 's satanist agenda obviously . 
  people have also mentioned that he could pass off as a liberal or moderate republican . 
  let me guess , he was gay was n't he ? 
  that automatically makes him an atheist , and this is theist oppression !, 
   using this opinion , and radical elements propped up by religious schools funded by saudi oil , saudi arabia and the us armed some assholes and sent them in through turkey to cause chaos . 
  do you have a source for this ? 
  his top video has 4.6 k views because he tagged along with a couple of other popular minecrafters when they played on a private minez servers and then uploaded those videos to their channel . 
  people then went to his channel to see his point of view . 
  i need it for two things , not the plugin , but just the jre for minecraft and libreoffice/openoffice , which though , can still run without a jre . 
  i think you should respect the believer , not the belief . 
  give them respect , until they fail to reciprocate that respect . 
  that 's true . 
  i 've seen a couple of threads on askreddit on why porn sites have better players and better video loading compared to youtube . 
  youtube does n't really have any real hard hitting competitors . 
  sure there are sites like vimeo and metacafe , but they are n't really at the level youtube is at . 
  there are thousands of porn sites out there , one way to win people over is to have better video players available on most common electronic devices . 
  just ask him if he considers other world religions like scientology and mormonism to be as valid as his own religion . 
  if he views them as dumb , then he is the one on the left of the picture . 
  i would n't say it 's the right thing to do , but going to church can be somewhat good . 
  churches are social places and you can get to interact with different people and be social . 
  it 's a community thing . 
   she says when im 18 i can make my own decisions . 
  it 's true . 
  she pays the bills and pays for the roof over your head and food on your plate , and until you can do those things on your own , you sorta have to do what she says . 
  i do n't agree that religious parents should force their children to go with them to church , but they have the money . 
  if you do go to church , i would sit in the back and not be disruptive . 
  listen to some music if you can . 
  or if you want to listen to what is being said , i would take notes of the claims being said and see if they hold water . 
  you can use various online tools to debunk any crap they say , like creationism and the like . 
  examples include the [ skeptic 's annotated bible ] ( http://www.skepticsannotatedbible.com/ ) , [ iron chariots wiki ] ( http://wiki.ironchariots.org/index.php?title=main_page ) , and this [ list for bible contradictions ] ( http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/jim_meritt/bible-contradictions.html ) . 
  stop posting his videos . 
  he is a crazy bastard . 
  he has done this many times , provoking the border patrol agents and he was tazed before . 
  `` satan has brainwashed christians not to have children ( birth control ) '', 
  `` beware of jim morrison and the doors '', 
  anti-science rant, 
  anti-gay rant, 
  `` true libertarians are pro-life and anti abortion '', 
  anti-free education, 
  `` religion is more important than politics '', 
  `` liberalism is hypocrisy '', 
  fuck this guy . 
  i posted these to show that he is n't some actor when he wanted to preach to the border patrol . 
  people should know he is a fucked up preacher , and that he intentionally provokes the border patrol . 
  i moved the buttons around before moving them to their original spot , and the bugs were still there . 
  i did the reset , but it still did n't work . 
  that directory does not exist . 
  well , it 's free as in free beer . 
  not free as in libre or freedom , free . 
  not all porn videos are available on tube sites , only clips . 
  i would say people download porn site rips from filelockers or torrents . 
  if they were on those tube sites , then maybe the need to store them would go away . 
  also people download dvd and blu ray rips too , and not many tube sites have full length videos . 
  you might have adware installed that is replacing embedded youtube videos into advertisements that fail to load . 
  does going to youtube , and watching a random video work ? 
  sorry your ex girlfriend 's faith was so low that being with an atheist hurts her faith . 
  are you serious ? 
  what the fuck man . 
  this has to be one of the dumbest shit i have read about the us government . 
  you ca n't really travel to cuba and buy shit because you are aiding the ~ ~ redcoats ~ ~ ~ ~ terrorists ~ ~ ~ ~ nazis ~ ~ communists , but companies are forced to buy israeli shit ? 
   sponsored by the arab league , and certain moslem countries, 
  yeah , fuck their boycotts . 
  you can only support our boycotts . 
  because bittorrent after v6 is just a rebranded utorrent , so why not just use utorrent ? 
  many of these clients are pretty old and no longer maintained . 
  like abc . 
  last stable version was released in 2005 . 
  [ this will generate a torrent ] ( http://checkmytorrentip.com/ ) that will tell you what ip is being sent to the tracker . 
  you can then check any ip lookup website to see if it matches your non vpn ip address . 
  if it does , your vpn is not set up right , or something else is wrong . 
  check the sidebar of / r/vpn for other tests you can do to check your vpn connections . 
  [ they also gave caved and gave information about steroid dealers to the fbi . ], 
  ( http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2007/11/encrypted-e-mai/ ), 
  it 'll change in the next 30 years . 
  the number of atheists and agnostics is increasing . 
   what would it take to convert you to a religion ? 
  and, 
   what would it take for you to believe in a god ? 
  are two different questions entirely . 
  everyone would agree that people would believe in a deity if the evidence came along .
