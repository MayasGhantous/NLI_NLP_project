  wow , you should kick his fucking ass out , move out , or force him to get a job or you will stop paying your share ( all ) of the bills . 
  ehh , kinda . 
  [ compared to 24 other western `` civilized '' countries , switzerland has the fourth highest gun rate of homicides per 100,000 people . 
  greece , ireland and the us have higher rates .

  this really is n't a scientific nor statistical reply . 
  i did n't include all or most countries out there , i also did not include how many guns there are in each country per 100,000 people , nor how strict or lenient gun laws are in each of those countries . 
  so , switzerland is probably ranked high because many of the other countries do n't have the same amount of guns per 100,000 people nor the average rates of gun per person . 
  here is a great [ politifact article ] ( http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/statements/2013/jan/06/facebook-posts/facebook-posting-says-gun-rich-swiss-have-lowest-f/ ) on switzerland and its guns . 
   edit : nothing seems to work , ill just re-install home premium tomorrow, 
  do you still have the key for the upgrade ? 
  if so , you should do the upgrade to ultimate when you re-install hp . 
  once you open up task manager , if you accidentally closed explorer , you can to file  new task ( run ) and type in `` explorer '' or `` explorer.exe '' . 
  if those do n't work , type in `` c : \\ windows \\ explorer.exe '' , or you can manually browse to it by clicking on the `` browse '' button at the bottom of the screen . 
  type them without the quotations . 
  [ comodo firewall ] ( https://www.comodo.com/home/internet-security/firewall.php ) if you want advanced firewalling , and more application control . 
  [ ccleaner ] ( https://www.piriform.com/ccleaner/download ) to clean up browser history , temp files , recycle bin etc. 
  alternative to glary . 
  [ netspeed monitor ] ( http://www.floriangilles.com/software/netspeedmonitor ) or [ networx ] ( http://www.softperfect.com/products/networx/ ) monitor internet traffic . 
  both have a taskbar toolbar that show internet speeds . 
  [ autoruns ] ( http://www.filehippo.com/download_autoruns/ ) shows you all the crap that run at startup . 
  you can also disable internet explorer extensions and explorer shell extensions .

  ninite pretty much has it all , really . 
  i guess if you want portable apps designed for flash drives , check out portableapps.com . 
  other than that , ninite is awesome . 
  thank you . 
  ca n't believe i forgot about `` about : permissions '' . 
  that is if he uses internet explorer . 
  chrome , opera , firefox and safari all have their own cache . 
  it is a single file and i think you need a third party program to open them . 
  she has been wearing weird dresses for the past few award shows , has n't she ? 
  then again , that makes her stand out . 
  tpb closed their trackers a while back . 
  they use public trackers now for the torrents which include openbittorrent , publicbt , and istole.it . 
  that feature is in [ windows xp and 7 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vwjmd.jpg ) , so i assume it is on vista as well . 
   `` i saw all kinds of traffic pass . 
  first in french , then in germany - cologne , aachen , frankfurt ... 
  but i asked myself no questions , '' she said . 
  really ? 
  i mean , once i hit the belgian border , i would 've known that something was wrong . 
  67 years old or not , how do you not realize that the gps was messed up until you end up in eastern europe ? 
  surely the signs were n't in dutch or french anymore , a long ways ago . 
  there is a pretty large opposition to music in the islamic world . 
  many see it is haram ( forbidden ) because it `` takes away attention '' from allah . 
  it is debateable though . 
  some say all music is forbidden . 
  some say all music is forbidden , except music with a certain type of drum . 
  many moderates say only music with negative topics ( sex , drugs , alcohol ) are forbidden . 
  [ you can read some threads on / r/islam about it ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/islam/search?q=music&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all ) . 
  also remember france [ more or less objected ] ( http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2003/jan/22/germany.france ) to our war in iraq ( 2003 ) and there was the whole [ freedom fries ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/freedom_fries ) thing that was a result of their objection . 
  i am not really sure if this contributes to reddit 's relaxed attitude towards french intervention in mali , but i thought it should be pointed out anyway . 
  i thought chrome was supposed to be the stable one . 
  i am running the lastest chromium developer build and i get purple links . 
  are n't many schools under contracts to use microsoft products like ms office ? 
  also , do n't they get windows xp or windows 7 or whatever os at a lower cost by sticking with them for a while , and buying serials in bulk ? 
  ca n't say for sure , but you must know the internet is censored in many islamic countries , and reddit is probably one of censored sites . 
  there is another somewhat similar syndrome called `` paris syndrome '' where people who travel to paris experience psychiatric symptoms such as acute delusional states , hallucinations , feelings of persecution ( perceptions of being a victim of prejudice , aggression , or hostility from others ) , derealization , depersonalization , anxiety , dizziness , tachycardia , sweating , and others . 
  it usually affects the japanese where their media over hypes paris as some utopia , where everyone on the street is a high class model and nice , but they experience those symptoms when they realize it is just another crappy western city . 
  here is an article by the bbc on that topic . 
  beforeitsnews.com is an conspiracy theorist website , you should question just about everything that is posted to that site . 
  they are like gnats in your ear . 
  you try to slap them away , but they keep coming back wanting your attention . 
  buzzing and shit . 
  many people are having problems with the second one . 
  check / r/chrome . 
  chances are you are using res , and they say it is a bug with res , or a bug with chrome itself . 
  i do n't know how to help you , other than me suggesting you try chromium or iron , or use firefox for the time being . 
  sorry i was n't much help with both of your problems . 
  try / r/atheismbot . 
  that helps out a lot . 
  it filters the garbage memes , attention whorish pics , and facebook screencaps to nothing but news articles , yt videos and self posts . 
  with many things filtered out , the comments are better , because they address self posts , and generate discussions , instead of posting karma farming comments . 
  so , can we smoke marijuana and torrent music and films , in the name of jesus ? 
  i do n't mind them too much to be honest . 
  i am trying to get into reggae and dub , and they have some blatant religious overtones . 
  they might be fake . 
  the ones that end up on the front page could be doctored , and op ca n't respond . 
  they do n't want to offend or be unfriended , they are closeted , or they do n't want to start a religious argument on facebook because it is worthless are all some reasons why op might not respond . 
  if you do want to see some where people respond and generate discussions try / r/thefacebookdelusion . 
  yeah , getting just 10 or 20 relics for a sig weapon is way too easy when there are 120 relics in total . 
  in gta , you needed to get at least 40-80 out of 100 hidden packages ( special items sorta like relics ) to get some of the more powerful weapons at your houses . 
  especially for something powerful like the amr , 20 was n't even a challenge . 
  silverlight : http://filehippo.com/download_silverlight/ or, 
  download [ malwarebytes anti malware ] ( http://www.filehippo.com/download_malwarebytes_anti_malware ) and do a full scan . 
  spybot does n't compare to mbam . 
  also check your dns server settings . 
  it might have been changed . 
  try changing it to [ google public dns ] ( https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/docs/using ) . 
  if any of these fail , you might want to do a clean install . 
  be sure you have your drivers cd/dvd , you do n't want to be stuck with a fresh install and no drivers , which would mean you do n't have access to the internet or anything involving drivers . 
  he was n't arrested for drunk driving , because you obviously ca n't prove in court that he was drunk , but rather for two counts of failing to perform the duties of a driver . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.kgw.com/news/local/drunk-driving-facebook-post-lands-astoria-teen-in-jail-185591512.html ), 
  still , he deserved to go to jail for bragging about that shit . 
  he should 've kept his mouth shut . 
  also do n't moot 's posts , at least when he comments , have a dashed rectangular border around the text ?
