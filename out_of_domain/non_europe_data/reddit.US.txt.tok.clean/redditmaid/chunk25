  we 've already seen it mate . 
  creationism is unconstitutional and un-american to teach in public schools , or schools funded by taxes , period . 
  glad zack is vocally standing up against this . 
  did n't he also recognize non-believers in his inauguration speech as well ? 
  try this . 
  see if you find any traces of bluestacks running at startup . 
  like through a service , or as an executable . 
  try to disable or delete them , but first do a system restore point , in case you delete , or disable something necessary on accident . 
  also try [ process hacker ] ( http://processhacker.sourceforge.net/ ) as an alternative to the crappy default task manager . 
  you might find what the default task manager is missing . 
  try [ revo uninstaller the free version ] ( http://www.revouninstaller.com/revo_uninstaller_free_download.html ) . 
  if it shows up , try to uninstall it and do an advanced scan which should find all the crap it left behind . 
  also open up the task manager , hit file  run . 
  type in msconfig and go to the startup tab . 
  see if zd shows up , and prevent it from running at startup . 
  also , if it shows you where it is running from , you can go to that folder , and delete the exe and all the crap that comes with it . 
  try [ autoruns ] ( http://filehippo.com/download_autoruns/ ) , it should show more stuff that msconfig startup could miss . 
  after downloading it , and running it , go to the `` logon '' tab . 
  it should show you where it is running from , and from there you can disable it , and delete it . 
  if not there , check the `` services '' tab as well . 
  does zoom downloader even run at startup when you first login , or when you first run a web browser , or do you just know it is still in your computer ? 
   that home schooling is unconstitutional , because it allows parents to teach their children any belief system they want without government intervention ? 
  parents can teach whatever bollocks they want at home , because it does n't involve american tax dollars . 
   if you do , you may want to re-think what the term unconstitutional really means . 
  creationism in public schools is unconstitutional . 
  that is a fact . 
  i do n't know if avast is blocking access to files . 
  i would suggest you go back to autoruns , and check the explorer , internet explorer , scheduled tasks , and image hijacks as a last resort . 
  i would suggest you get rid of avast , and get microsoft security essentials , a better , leaner , and microsoft supported antivirus program . 
  many people recommend it , along with malwarebytes antimalware . 
  you should definitely get malwarebytes and do a scan with it . 
  anyways , you say it starts up whenever you download a file ? 
  what browser ( s ) do you use ? 
  did you get it from [ salon ] ( http://www.salon.com/2013/01/11/stop_talking_about_hitler/ ) , or do you have a better source ? 
  i would love to know more about germany 's gun laws . 
  i saw that link in the article . 
  thank you . 
  now i want to know the source of the article where it says that stalin did n't believe in gun control and armed thugs of all types as quoted by brown university historian , omer bartov . 
  this would be a huge blow to that ridiculous notion that he controlled guns . 
  did you check to see if zd has any extensions or plugins that you can disable in firefox ? 
  throw in `` op is a faggot '' . 
  annoying as hell to see . 
  it is also homophobic , and should have stayed on 4chan , where it is used a lot . 
  would n't it be different if people would post `` op is a nigger '' ? 
  they would get called out for being racist , meme or no meme . 
  [ op is a faggot was recently misused on this guy . 
  ] ( http://np.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/16mscp/i_asked_my_friend_to_photoshop_me_into_a_picture/c7xgg63 ) people called him a faggot for stealing and reposting a picture , even though he proved them wrong . 
  anyways , those comments you listed are mainly found in threads on the default subs . 
  try finding smaller subreddits where the content is filtered , and the comments are ( usually ) better . 
  establishment clause , first amendment . 
  the government ca n't promote a religion , public schools fall under the government , and creationism/intelligent design is promotion of religion , specifically christianity . 
  it is not science and does not belong in schools , but at church or at home . 
  you know what is funny ? 
  conspiracy theorists believing we could n't visit the moon in 1969 . 
  but somehow , these same conspiracy theorists usually believe that [ obama visited mars by teleporation ] ( http://www.thetruthbehindthescenes.org/2012/02/26/project-pegasus-travelling-to-mars-teleportation-and-jump-rooms/ ) and time travel and other bollocks in the 1980s as part of a darpa project . 
  so , how do we get from the moon being impossible to visit in 1969 , to time travel and teleportation in less than 20 years ? 
  surprisingly , they are n't us americans ? 
  i know that it is a tv show , but come on , who leaves unlabeled counter cleaner , right next to food ingredients ? 
  that is a health hazard , and the guy could faces fines , or worse . 
  one bug i would get , is that gifs would load in the middle and play , before it starts over again . 
  and also another thing that gripes me , is andre knows that victoria is trying out the things from the containers , but he does n't mention beforehand , `` hey , do n't eat the white stuff from the container on top , it 's counter cleaner ! '', 
  he just waits until after she put it in her mouth to say something about it . 
  i smell a lawsuit . 
  sucks that the [ irs gave up on figuring out which churches are charities and which one participate in politics . 
  ] ( http://bigstory.ap.org/article/irs-not-enforcing-rules-churches-and-politics ), 
  that should be the petition , force the irs to start investigating which churches meddle dangerously with politics , where they abuse the exemption , or the irs should face budget cuts or something where they get off their asses and do what we pay them for . 
  i do n't know if i like soda that has lost its carbonation , do n't get me wrong , i would drink a soda can that was open a day , but i really love room temperature soda . 
  especially 7-up or sprite at room temperature . 
  here is a [ gun debate on wendy williams ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kvts0qhnac ) and it sucks that penn teller was the only voice of reason here between wendy and two women with news backgrounds . 
  he was calm and collected during it , even though he knew they were using flawed logic . 
  what a badass swatting the gun away from being pointed at him . 
  i would 've just stood there frozen . 
  i just delete them . 
  fucking java is a pain in the ass to disable on all of the browsers that i use , after an update . 
  i never even use java , so i do n't touch the control panel for java and the only reason i have it ( and i assume many people have it for , is minecraft ) . 
  but thanks for that tip . 
  [ obama does this a lot . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=theao0lt4dw ) i swear he says pauses and says ` uhh ... ' and then talks for a couple of seconds before another `` uh ... '' . 
  from march 31 , 2006 . 
   the big bang , where did the energy for that come from ? 
  modern science can not answer that question . 
   you may say , well where did god come from ? 
  i say he has always and will always exist . 
  [ then why not say the same for the universe ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eqdhtvl_50 ), 
  the whole white house petitions thing is shit as well , they do n't accomplish anything . 
  the wh only reaffirms their original stances in those petitions , if they get large enough numbers to respond . 
  if it is n't my toilet , i am going to have trouble peeing in it . 
  muslims and christians are both taking advantage of africa , and have been for years . 
  religion is one of the problems in africa that needs to be fixed . 
  he said he would n't waste federal resources on medical marijuana vendors , nor medical marijuana users . 
  he has closed down more medical marijuana vendors in 4 years than bush 's 8 years . 
  it said that he was thrown off of stage for playing the same song for longer than 30-45 minutes , and not that he was anti-obama . 
  so they hire a guy with opposing political views , and then get mad when he sings one of his songs that opposes obama 's positions ? 
  i always shoot them , even before they take your friends . 
  they are pretty useless and have poor accuracy skills . 
  sometimes you try to take a camp stealthily , and these bastards show up full force , machine guns blazing . 
  remember a few weeks ago when an idiotic politician threw a fit when he claimed there was a muslim bias in the textbooks ? 
  haha , and they found a right wing christian bias instead ? 
  well , this is one of those biases .
