  well i think it is just in case you did n't accidentally make a tab fullscreen , you can know what tab caused it to go fullscreen and as ericj2190 points out , as a security feature . 
  there are lots of benefits about having a us centered vpn though . 
  there are cons sure , but it is better to use a vpn service than to get caught torrenting by your isp or some third party . 
  i guess it depends on your local , state/province , and national laws . 
  wow , nice !, 
  would 've been better if they were scaled down though , instead of being posted at full resolution . 
  i heard isps throttle connections though . 
  they may not go after you through the courts like in the us , but do n't think they do n't do anything about it . 
  how in the hell do you pee ? 
  that shit looks like it is blocking the urinary tract . 
  granted there are no deadly sins in the bible , [ gluttony ] ( http://www.openbible.info/topics/gluttony ) is mentioned more in the bible than [ homosexuality ] ( http://www.openbible.info/topics/homosexuality ) . 
  blame overly protective parents on this one . 
  did n't muslims see action in north africa in wwii as well ? 
  also the yugoslav area ? 
  why would you do that shit ? 
  because there is a liberal war on religion !, 
  i know so because fox news told me !, 
  the guy from the video sounds like he would voice commercials for [ ammu-nation ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwh7ogfrp8q ) in the fictional grand theft auto universe . 
  you know , i bet a lot of people turn on their tv but get on their computers all day and forget the tv was on . 
  that is what i used to do when i had cable . 
  man , i miss background noise . 
  no , they are going to cut off everyone 's access to the outside world . 
  their internet will only be an intranet inside iran . 
   to that end , iran 's ministry of communications and technology has announced the launch of a domestic intranet -- a completely closed loop that would leave iranian citizens without online access to the rest of the world . 
  they just are n't worried about getting hacked , they are worried about rebel websites and un-islamic things . 
   `` we have identified and confronted 650 websites that have been set up to battle our regime -- 39 of them are by opposition groups and our enemies , and the rest promote western culture and worshiping satan , and stoke sectarian divides , '' conservative cleric hamid shahriari said in march . 
  `` we are worried about a portion of cyberspace that is used for exchanging information and conducting espionage . '', 
  it ca n't be an article about the sale of russian weapons to the us without talking about recent gun violence !, 
  that damn sensationalism . 
  i have to ask , how did you not know if he was simply joking and believes in evolution ? 
  this is one of the reasons religion exists today . 
  people are too scared to witness anything that will contradict what they know to be fact . 
  they see it as a threat . 
  yeah , from the film `` i now pronounce you chuck and larry '' . 
  the restraining order . 
  i mean , say that that was evidence for a `` demon . '', 
  many cultures and religions have things like demons or `` evil forces '' that do bad things to people . 
  which god or gods , would such demonic forces prove exist to counter such evil forces ? 
  that damn title . 
  wow , how many addons do you have installed and what version are you running ? 
  and is flash or java running . 
  flash ups the ram usage more between 100 and 200 megs for me . 
  at most my firefox esr ( now beta channel ) uses around 200 to 300 megabytes for at most 5 tabs open . 
  i have 20 extensions , 18 enabled and i have 4 gigs on this laptop . 
  maybe it is time to get an x64 fork . 
  i wish mozilla would finally release an official 64 bit version since 64 bit is the default when it comes to new consumer computers so 64 bit computers are on the rise . 
  same goes for firefox , although you have to go to about : config in the address bar and search for `` plugins.click _ to_play '' and changing it from `` false '' to `` true '' . 
  i used to be a conspiratard myself , i believed that the government orchestrated the attacks for their own benefit . 
  so i used to hang out with other conspiratards and that is where i started to become skeptical of the so called `` truths . '', 
  some of the people i knew believed that advanced lasers took down the buildings and turned them into ash . 
  one person believed aliens were behind the attacks . 
  but the one that just threw me off the most was that there were no victims and that there were no planes . 
  that 's right . 
  i know someone who said the people were all photoshopped and that the planes were cgi . 
  whenever he mentioned that , and disregarded that there were shit tons of bodies recovered , i started to distance myself from them . 
  that guy was so aggressive at getting his point across and that everyone else was a shill and made up lies to distract you from the `` truth . '', 
  i started to realize it was sounding like bullshit and just how dumb it was , and how dumb i was to believe all of it . 
  in reality , it seemed like a huge anti-government circlejerk . 
  they always complain about the government , but never actually do anything but fucking complain . 
  they do n't want to vote , because everyone is obviously a government patsy , even people from the smaller parties with no history of corruption . 
  but they also wo n't leave the country , because that is just too simple . 
  they feel like a cult at times . 
  they refuse to listen to anything that contradicts their hypothesis 's and everyone else is wrong and a sheep . 
  but if you listen to them , you will be saved !, 
  also another thing that made me withdraw from them was the fact that everything that ever happens , is a conspiracy . 
  nothing ever happens , just because . 
  it is always the government behind everything . 
  like the aurora shooting . 
  one ( possibly ) mentally insane or drugged up person ca n't shoot someone else without the government having something to do with it . 
  they claimed the shootings was another attempt of the gov. 
  trying to take people 's guns away . 
  this shit has been said since columbine , yet was has really changed federal wise , with gun laws ? 
  not much . 
  what i want to know is how the dhs thinks a hospital 's online store is a front for terrorism . 
  `` sir , i am going to need to ask you to shut down this gift shop because these ` get well soon ' cards are obviously linked to al-qaeda . '', 
  at the address bar go to to `` opera : config '' and go down to `` user prefs '' and find `` show startup dialog '' and untick/uncheck it . 
  try this shortcut, 
  pretty much anything adobe on linux is dead . 
  is there a link refuting the argument ? 
  i want to learn more about this one . 
  they deal with their enemies like [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22tj_l4pcps ) . 
  i think the best way to make w7 look better is to browse the [ windows 7 visual styles ] ( http://browse.deviantart.com/customization/skins/windows7/visualstyle/ ) on deviantart . 
  also , many of those themes look beautiful with the [ token icon set ] ( http://brsev.deviantart.com/art/token-128429570 ) or the [ ecqlipse icon set ] ( http://chrfb.deviantart.com/art/ecqlipse-2-quot-ico-quot-66339090 ) to replace the icons on pinned apps in the taskbar . 
  anyways , what was the biggest reason you left os x in favor of windows and what is the biggest thing you miss from os x ? 
  no , actually this was very informative . 
  i understood it . 
  basically , to every species , we are products of changes , possibly through mutations , over large periods of time and those changes either helped us , or caused us harm . 
  why stop at `` creator '' ? 
  when it comes to watches , is there only one person who makes watches ? 
  does he create all the parts from scratch ? 
  no , chances are he buy parts someone else made . 
  so , who is to say that there is only one creator ? 
  there could be hundreds of creators . 
  also , i noticed that people claim `` there has to be a creator !, 
  none of this just came out of nowhere ! '', 
  well , how can that person say that , but when you tell them that that logic could apply to a god or gods , they claim that is something different . 
  it surely is flawed . 
  [ dat everything . 
  except for sips , who lives in jersey , no ? 
  actually , were n't there tweets yesterday that protesters in australia stormed the uk embassy yesterday ?
