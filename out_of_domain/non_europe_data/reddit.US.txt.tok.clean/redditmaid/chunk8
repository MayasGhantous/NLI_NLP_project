  we should n't care if politicians are christian or not , because we have laws that say no religious tests should be forced on someone running for office , nor should we pass laws promoting one religion over the other , because of the first amendment . 
  so it should n't matter what religious ideas a political party in the us has , they ca n't really force their views into laws . 
  both . 
  he is literally hitler . 
  ( metaphorically speaking . ), 
  i use ddg and ixquick/startpage . 
  both are pretty cool , and privacy oriented . 
  i actually use ddg more but only because of the cool ! bang syntax 's . 
  what do you mean ? 
  well like i said before , both ixquick/startpage and ddg protect your privacy , but i meant that i prefer ddg to ixquick , because ddg has the syntax 's . 
  nah , just to get the 100 % and small stuff like zero 's asset ( once you complete the missions , it generates cash ) . 
  if you love gta , how can you say they were shitty ? 
  they were fun . 
  obviously they were n't made with the same quality as their console cousins , but they were entertaining none the less . 
  at least these are n't the * offensive * billboards like the ones mocking other people 's religious beliefs . 
  do n't get me wrong , i like that they quote the contradictory crap in the bible , but placing it on a billboard is n't going to help . 
  it is only going to make people mad and place atheists and other groups in an unfavorable light . 
  i 'm glad that there does n't seem to be much outrage on this billboard , unlike others that have been placed in different states . 
  disregard the children ? 
  instead of debit or credit , why not prepaid ? 
  go to some store a few miles away from where you live , buy a prepaid , and sign up for a vpn at starbucks or mcdonald 's , or any place where there is free wifi . 
  you want to minimize the information that can be traced back to you . 
  how many hotdogs can you eat in one sitting ? 
  the guy who tweeted was n't the one driving . 
  maybe . 
  that is why i said buy it a few miles away from where you live . 
  do n't buy it from the store down the street , because they will know the person who bought it , lives around the area . 
  also , you should always pay with cash , if you do n't want more information attached to the prepaid card . 
  i do n't see the point in paying for a prepaid card , if you want it to be for anonymous purposes if you are going to pay for the card with a debit or credit card . 
  i mean , you already have a card , so why buy a prepaid card ? 
  if you want the least information attached to the prepaid card , you should buy it away from your area with cash . 
  looks like you disabled javascript . 
  see if you can re-enable it . 
  also , do what nihilozero said , and clear your cache . 
  if it is the judeo-christian abrahamic god , he will need to do way more than just prove he exists for me to worship him . 
  even then , i do n't think i would worship such an evil god .

  somebody needs to make this into a gif . 
  you should tell her to visit an african hospital , and then ask her if vaccines are necessary . 
  did i accidentally stumble onto r/magicskyfairy ? 
  they must be changing the way you can buy a prepaid card now i guess , or i guess it depends on who sold you the card , what type of card ( visa , mastercard , ae ) , and the bank associated to it . 
  the last time i bought one , i bought it at a cvs about three years ago and i only had the give the cashier the money to load it up . 
  i still had to activate it online , or over the phone though . 
  i never understood this . 
  i had many friends who would not show up to school a lot . 
  so sometimes they would get three days suspension for not showing up to school . 
  this is even worse . 
  jail is a terrible place and we should spend more money on education instead of cutting costs because the children are missing out . 
  there are many reasons why a student would miss days of school . 
  some come from bad home situations and some might need to work to support siblings , some are experiencing bullying or something that keeps them away from people , ` normal ' classes might not be the right course for them and they are failing due to an impairment , and many more reasons . 
  the punishment for missing a lot of days in school should not be missing more days of school . 
  that is counterproductive . 
  god did n't give us free will , the talking snake did . 
  i 'm sorry man . 
  there still maybe some cards that do n't ask for personal info , or see if you can ask if you can verify online . 
  that is what i did with my card . 
  i just went to their website and activated it there . 
  today on fox news : `` godless , evil , scumbag , communist , america 's no .

  the vpn host or the prepaid card company ?

  fuck these stupid regurgitated copypasta comments that are on every music video . 
  you must be new to youtube or something . 
  you know you would figure if the us was founded as a christian nation that it would be called the `` christian republic of america \u2122 '', 
  and without religion we would literally be more technically advanced by over 9000 years thanks to all the sci [ ent ] ists because athiests = scientists . 
  you should 've just made this into a self post without the image with the moon . 
  i heard this , but i ca n't find any sources . 
  people say she is a hardcore fundie on twitter , but the last time i checked i did n't find any religious tweets to be honest .

  if you are on 7 and are referring to missing file icons , you have to change them through registry editing . 
  it used to be super easy on xp , all you had to do was go to ` folder properties ' in explorer from the tools menu and then go over to the ` file types ' tab . 
  there is a [ guide from how to geek ] ( http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/12383/change-a-file-types-icon-in-windows-7/ ) on how to make it easier to change icons using a 3rd party program by nirsoft called [ file types manager ] ( http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/file_types_manager.html ) on windows 7 . 
  same for [ startpage ] ( https://www.startpage.com ) which is the sister site of ixquick which uses google without all the identifiable stuff . 
  the headline is a bit sensational . 
  they have n't been blocked , just the phrase ` thepiratebay ' has been been removed from instant and autocomplete searches . 
  you can still type in `` thepiratebay '' and you will see the official site as the first link . 
  they are however being downranked in searches related to `` infringing '' works . 
  if you are n't part of the 90 % , are n't you the weird one on here ? 
  probably because of how some muslims in the mid . 
  east view israel which is a jewish state . 
  they say that what israel is doing to palestine is comparable of the treatment the jews received in german occupied countries in the 30 's and 40 's at the hands of the nazis .

  did anyone else lean to the left every time kurt got close to the wall ? 
  well , you better spend it as soon as you pick it up . 
  i loved these , but i hated them for two reasons : if you lose one of the lead holders ? , you were screwed , and the second thing was that the lead was n't attached to the white plastic part that well so if you applied any force whenever you were writing , the lead would go through the white part . 
  i swear these sharpeners were never properly installed at my schools . 
  they would be missing a screw and that would cause the sharpener to wobble every time you tried to sharpen your pencil . 
  i think you might want to rephrase that last sentence . 
   it 's time for the extremists to die off already . 
  you know because of suicide bombers . 
  anyways , i do n't think extremists should have to ` die off ' , even though i know you do n't mean literally . 
  i wish extremists would evolve and move with the rest of the world into the 21st century . 
  why would he stop them ? 
  he commanded that the hijackers fly the plane into the building and violently kill all of those people so that they can go to heaven .
