  afghan soldiers turned their weapons on isaf soldiers mentoring them and murdered a number of soldiers throughout the country as well . 
  all because of an accidental burning of books that were used by taliban prisoners to write messages in to other prisoners . 
  of course i did n't want violence to occur , it angers and saddens me that it has . 
  yet it received so little recognition , the hypocrisy and the hate so present in muslims . 
  remember the qur ` an burning staged by pastor terry jones ( boneheaded bigot as well ) even more blood was spilled here then . 
  violence triggered by trivial offenses and a refusal to accept that any culture may operate differently than their own . 
  all the while the west stirs quietly while more blood is shed in the name of the supposed religion of peace . 
  should news of this reach afghanistan , i would be willing to bet more of the same will happen . 
  more blood will be spilled . 
  and will you protest ? 
  probably not ? 
  will you even hear about it ? 
  slim chance ? 
  islam has within it a recipe for terrible brutality , oppression , ignorance and conflict until all the world is for allah . 
  even if you choose to deny it how many millions of adherents to your religion follow the path of jihad , literal sharia , wahabism , salafism and so on ? 
  that is what should have been discussed these past few days . 
  oh , you respect all humans and animals ? 
  according to islamic law that should n't be so . 
  do you ignore the najis ?

  religion provided answers and hope at best . 
  it produces willful ignorance , bigotry and violence at worst . 
  the collective knowledge of humanity now provides the answers and is constantly seeking more , and i have found that i do n't need any god to find hope . 
  not to say there are not benefits to religion , but it 's usefulness to an informed humanity has largely passed i believe . 
  instead of wishing to see a world without religion , i wish to see a world without religion used to justify the errant actions and views consistently possessed by it 's adherents . 
  i do not think muslims are full of hate . 
  i have known lebanese , iraqi 's , jordanians , afghans even saudi and pakistani muslims who are wonderful people . 
  people i am glad to have met and known . 
  however , i believe those truly following islam as described in the holy qur ` an and as presented in the life of the prophet ( pbuh ) contains the recipe i described in my previous comment . 
  `` islam has within it a recipe for terrible brutality , oppression , ignorance and conflict until all the world is for allah . '', 
  islam was born of the sword , spread by the sword and ruled by the sword . 
  until muslim defeats at vienna and lepanto and steady technological/economic gains by the christian west , islam was a military threat and constantly sought to expand the ummah . 
  osama bin laden chose september 11th for reason , he saw the defeat of the muslim forces at vienna on september 11th 1683 as the end of muslim expansion , and the relative end of open war between the ummah and the dar al harb . 
  he reopened those hostilities quite clearly as a resumption of conflict not between america and islam , but the entire non-muslim world , and all true followers of islam . 
  now , one mistake westerners often make and muslim apologists like to repeat , is the belief that jihadists are somehow ignorant or misinterpreting islam . 
  the leadership of the hundreds of jihadist groups operating around the world , and often their fighters , even the suicide bombers have proven to be extremely intelligent men . 
  well read , masters of the qur ` an and the hadith . 
  are you telling me they are all fools ? 
  no , there are simply adhering to their faith as strongly as they can . 
  it 's no wander so many who delve deeper into islam , who seek to strengthen their faith and live for allah tend to find themselves supporting or participating in jihad . 
  there are enough publications and statement written by fighters and leaders alike who offer insight into why war is being waged on the west and on apostate governments in the muslim world . 
  i do n't think you could deny much of what they claim . 
  so i ask you . 
  why are you getting upset about a forum on the internet being a bunch of dicks when your fellow believers are murdering people around the world ? 
  in just the last week ... 
  9 x killed in hillah , iraq for being shiites, 
  3 x killed in pattan , thailand by islamic separatists, 
  9 x injured in bauchi , nigeria at a beer garden, 
  3 x killed in kenya at a soccer game, 
  13 x pakistani soldiers murdered and some beheaded by ttp, 
  2 x killed in jalalabad for selling music, 
  8 x killed in quetta , pakistan at a laundromat, 
  35 x killed in yemen by aqap, 
  14 x killed in baghdad in a market bombing, 
  7 x pakistani soldiers beheaded in laddah, 
  2 x christians murdered in karachi, 
  3 x dead in a shrine attack in pakistan, 
  2 x dead in a mosque bombing in quetta, 
  and 20 x dead in a resort near kabul, 
  all of that in 6 days !, 
  i wish with all my heart muslims were posting offensive comics rather than murdering people across the world . 
  this list does n't include honor killings , sharia rulings , or other incidents not picked up by the news . 
  what do you have to say to all this ? 
  how can you excuse it ? 
  how can you ignore it ? 
  have an upvote for being a chill muslim !, 
  i am not saying the `` average muslim '' is going to blow themselves up . 
  but the average muslim is likely to be passively frustrated to enraged with the news . 
  a portion will take to the street in protest . 
  a portion will donate or otherwise support those wishing to conduct attacks . 
  and a tiny portion but a portion nonetheless will be one step closer to committing their lives to jihad , and taking the lives of others in the name of allah . 
  oh and i have known muslim 's from a variety of backgrounds . 
  see my comment below . 
  thanks for the level reply , have another upboat !, 
  are you an emirate ? 
  i was floored in dubai the difference between the lives of emirates and the immigrant pakistanis and indians . 
  once i spoke with a pakistani cab driver and asked him what he thought about alchohol sales in dubai . 
  he said he could care less , if life was good here , than why change it . 
  he recognized that is was wrong , but he said it was his life he needed to worry about and to let the others do as they please . 
  it was an enjoyable conversation really . 
  on the flip side , i 've seen iraqis and afghans murdered for selling or consuming alchohol , and read about many more incidents elsewhere . 
  dubai and the uae is a special place in the middle east , a world apart from much that surrounds it . 
  the thing is , your average christian is somewhat to very passive , but those who consider themselves `` devout '' tend to be the ones denying evolution and raising their children to be ignorant bigots . 
  in comparison , your average muslim is also very level , but the scale of extremism among those who consider themselves `` devout '' goes far further and has much worse implications than christians . 
  christians are ignorant pricks at their worst . 
  muslims behead people and blow themselves up in markets filled with fellow muslims at their worst . 
  it 's quite a difference and worthy of recognition . 
  i 'd also love to hear explenations for taqqiya , the sanctioned practice of lying to decieve an enemy or to make gains when not in a position of power . 
  the jizya , the humiliating tax on non-believers along with the long list of rules and oppresive measures taken on non-believers in muslim dominated societies . 
  the list of najis , which if adhered to means non-muslims are no better than shit or pigs .
