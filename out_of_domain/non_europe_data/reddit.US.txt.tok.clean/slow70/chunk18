  finally savannah !, 
  it 's a little mh-6 that i think does tours . 
  i 've seen it from time to time since moving here three years ago , usually buzzing down the river or slowly hovering over downtown . 
  the religion of peace at it again . 
  i do n't know how the world can continue to stomach and tolerate the constant violence perpetrated by islamic fundamentalists . 
  you ca n't compare harmless wingnuts like phelps to islamic fundamentalists . 
  the token `` oh other religions do it '' argument is nonsense . 
  since mohammad first started raiding caravans , every frontier of islam , there is violence . 
  where muslim immigrants are surging , there is botched integration and violence . 
  within the dar al islam , there is violence . 
  open your eyes . 
  it 's really insightful reading your commentary . 
  you have so much to be proud of as an englishman yet you so flippantly toss it aside while espousing the virtues of `` multiculturalism '' . 
  i 'm not trying to defend imperialism/colonial practices as a whole , but the uk gave much to the world , the uk , not multiculturalism . 
  the guy was yelling allahu akbar while beheading an english soldier . 
  he states clearly his motive . 
  who do you think the `` we '' or `` our '' is he 's referring to in his rant ? 
  indeed we should learn from the past , july 7 , 2005 for example . 
  then there is today . 
  today is a fine day to stop making apologies or excuses and get to solving the issue men like this pose . 
  terrified ? 
  i want to sympathize , but with so much violence around the world perpetrated by islam , it 's almost laughable that you claim to be afraid of us . 
  again , the '' ____ religion has done it too ! '', 
  argument is hollow . 
  there exists no religion or belief system of any sort that has so consistently spilled blood throughout the world as islam has . 
  that website is poorly done in a lot of ways , i linked you to the attacks section . 
  that is cold hard numbers , facts that you ca n't dispute . 
  the event in london today is n't even on that page yet , but it will be , alongside hundreds of other dead and wounded ( mostly other muslims ) . 
  sulayman i 'm guessing you are a muslim , and i do n't claim that * all * muslims are violent extremists . 
  but you need to recognize that there is a consistent force within your religion , of devout believers who recognize the call to jihad . 
  before you rave on about anders brevik , turn your eyes inward , to your own community and figure out what the fuck is wrong with it . 
  i think it 's the quran , it 's mohammad 's teachings , it 's unavoidable ... and unfortunate . 
  it 's not a few crazies . 
  it 's years and years of steady incidents , large and small , petty and disastrous . 
  why are you going to such lengths to ignore them/make excuses for them ? 
  i agree that blanket judgements should be avoided , but the fact is , regardless of geographic location , economic well being , ethnicity , family conditions , political situation , education so on and so forth ... where there is islam , there tend to be extremist elements that seek to harm others in the name of islam . 
  that can not be ignored . 
  the fact that we have created the term `` islamaphobia '' to slam generally reasonable critique is dangerous and shameful when blood continues to spill . 
  you 're forgetting the practice of abrogation , essentially stating that a sura revealed later trumps all prior revelations should there be any contradiction . 
  mohammad 's writings became a lot less tolerant as his empire grew . 
  they were mohammad 's words put down by a nameless scribe . 
  you 're snapping at a technicality . 
  the point on abrogation stands in the quran and is mirrored in the hadith . 
  no you do n't need to argue with me , but you should argue with those spilling blood in the name of allah in the uk , in niger , in iraq , in yemen , in syria , in pakistan , in indonesia , in the philippines , in afghanistan , in somalia , in chechnya ... . 
  wow , you just revealed a lot about your thoughts on the overall matter . 
  i 'm sure the families of those killed in london on 7/7 , or madrid on 11/3 , or beslan , or hell , pick one of the thousands of market bombings in iraq and afghanistan ... they 'd all be relieved to hear that you are n't responsible for them . 
  but go on , carry the water in defence of islamists . 
  let 's see how long it is before more blood is spilled at your apathetic feet . 
  oh wait , 133 were just killed in quetta yesterday , another 20 in niger ... will you copy and paste the excuses in this thread to any follow ups ? 
  that plan looks great !, 
  it will be wonderful to see that take shape . 
  edit : is anything going to be done about the run down apartments ? 
  charleston is a great idea seeing as you could check out the middleton plantation or old sheldon church along the way . 
  ocala springs is a great trip in the other direction . 
  nailed it !, 
  that was quick . 
  and here i was thinking that an alley would be something people woudnt recognize so readily ... wow r/savannah . 
  you creepers . 
  more blood of the innocents to keep the spanish moss at bay ? 
  that 's the one . 
  i do n't understand how a building that new went that far south so quickly . 
  i feel like i should know you . 
  i love how so many of these would apply to today 's military as well . 
  the bad chow , the bag drags , people who snore ... i 'm not nearly through the album either . 
  since they stop in the uk ... did he keep a separate book once he crossed the channel ? 
  lose a taste for humor ? 
  there seems to be a couple years missing here . 
  this would be great !, 
  green truck ... get the rustico for there , and every other burger to look at while you eat it . 
  probably the best burgers i 've had in my life . 
  hucapoos ( for drinks ) and the crab shack ( for dinner ) are worth a stop too . 
  it makes me feel like i 'm on the wrong side of america ... i envy you two wheeled fools on the left coast . 
  i 'm not riding right now . 
  this feels wrong . 
  oh savannah ... i pay my water bill just across the street from where the pic was taken . 
  damned utilities . 
  former contractor here : there are very clear statements of work for every us contractor position in country . 
  most companies must turn in daily/weekly timesheets logging hours worked that form the basis for billing the us government . 
  - not saying this is n't abused . 
  - tcns who work in dfacs , sanitation , maintenance etc number higher than most would expect . 
  what `` random killings '' are you on about ? 
  sounds hugely ignorant . 
  there is definite accountability of movement , expenses , communications , ammunition , weapons , personnel , so on and so forth . 
  a contractor certainly has more `` freedom '' than most green suiters but that does n't extend to the actions you are implying . 
  in my experience the freedom held by being a contractor meant you were able to focus on getting the job done without pandering to the military rank structure or limiting regulations ( to a degree ) . 
  wrong was wrong , right was right ; and unlike your average soldier who had to nod and go along with whatever , a contractor is getting paid to be a professional , not a * yes * man . 
  this is far from the norm , these are individual incidents , and yes , all of them fucked up . 
  the clips look to be from iraq before the surge , moving through urban environments and heavy traffic is a bit of a hinderance to the mission not to mention dangerous when you consider the vbied threat . 
  official doctrine was to `` bump '' vehicles that did not move out of the way for you . 
  eof procedures technically allowed personnel to fire on approaching vehicles if they did not respond to warnings and continue to approach a vehicle ( you 're supposed to shoot the engine block ) . 
  these rules are likely being abused in this video but they practices were ** born from the loss of hundreds of lives ** to vbied and other threats . 
  as for the woman that was hit ... you see the congestion there ? 
  what would happen if 4-12 us personnel dismounted in the middle of all that ? 
  a crowd would form wherever it was , anger would stir , and depending on the part of town , i would expect violence . 
  it 's shitty , but those guys did n't have much of a choice .
