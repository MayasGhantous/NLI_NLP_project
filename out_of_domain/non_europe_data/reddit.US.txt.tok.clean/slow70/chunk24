  - home likely built in 40s-50s . 
  was remodeled in the last five years ( your room at least ), 
  - i 'm guessing you live in the east coast , perhaps new jersey or new york, 
  - they really wish you would clean your room, 
  - you do n't play many games and are n't the artistic type but you do enjoy music and appreciate quality sound devices . 
  your laptop is mostly used for browsing and schoolwork . 
  - the textbooks beside/below your bed you do n't bring to class , or maybe they are from a past class . 
  - the tissues could be in a more subtle place . 
  see what all you can guess , i 'll be back with answers tomorrow , that is unless someone nails it . 
  ** apo ** i left that tab open as a hint , i have an old flame in london ( no way to guess that ) but i am writing from an apo . 
  ** sav ** before coming here i did live in savannah and love that town with all my heart . 
  i still keep an apartment there but i 'm not sure if i 'll go back . 
  ** zerotheplay ** i know nothing about that sticker , scavenged the shelves from a unit that left here a few weeks ago . 
  ** clep ** actually misleading . 
  took sats back in 05 but joined the army straight away , i would like to take the tests again before doing school full time , i need to strengthen my math skills . 
  ** decor ** i got a laugh off of this one . 
  the christmas lights make it feel cozier , the quilt you see is something we all were given since it stays cold in here . 
  i ordered a comforter from amazon so i just use that one as a buffer between my space and the wall lockers next to me . 
  ** clothes ** masculine would be right , professional wear seems to stick to earth colors here . 
  the answer is that i am a 26 year old contractor currently in a 12 man bay in afghanistan . 
  the bay is newer construction and the furniture kind of misleading since it 's probably what most dorms have . 
  the guys got a kick out of the term `` fairy lights '', 
  nice observation !, 
  iphone is for wifi when i am in the bay , but it is my stateside phone , the other one is my local roshan afghan phone . 
  this room is wired to us standards . 
  great job breaking it all down , but i got ta say it 's still off . 
  the answer is that i am a 26 year old contractor currently in a 12 man bay in afghanistan . 
  good eye on the contents of the drawers , you do n't want to get sick here because your mission still needs to get done . 
  same thing for days that grind , caffiene is essential and i swear by 5hr energy . 
  the furniture i figured would be misleading . 
  it 's newer and uniform for all the new bays built on this base . 
  my bay is for 12 men , with the building itself having a dozen or so rooms like this . 
  the wikihow is so i can make sure letters actually get to this gal i 'm writing in london . 
  the internet makes it easy to stay in contact , but i believe in the presence of a letter . 
  your the only one to note the books . 
  i am fairly progressive and just love to read , i think that books hold a key to one day being a better man . 
  on the candles/smelly straw things ... afghanistan stinks ... and i do n't want to smell other peoples dirty laundry or dirty selves ... so i make sure my area smells good . 
  the hackey sack was just given to me by a soldier going home . 
  i plan to not suck at it at some point . 
  the quilt was just issued to us all since the winter is rolling in . 
  i 've already got a comfortor so i wont be using it . 
  may as well use it to soften up the room and buffer the space between me and the next guy . 
  the helmet says a lot . 
  conventional troops dont get to paint theirs like that , it would either imply that i am sof or civilian . 
  i know that is n't something most outside of this world would know . 
  zero the play ? 
  salvaged the drawers from a unit that left not long ago , i do n't know a thing about the play . 
  good job though man , keep doing this . 
  really good guesses guys , answer posted , ** but no one has gotten it right yet . 
  how did i guess ny/nj ? 
  little details about the house , the baseboard , the material , size and thickness of the closet door and the window all lend to midcentury american suburbia . 
  the heater vent below the desk made me think some place cooler and the clothes in the center of the pic look to have a yankees logo on them . 
  i get that you have surrendered . 
  - 18 year old male, 
  - midwest if not northeast judging by the thick socks , hats , jackets , and what might be a hockey stick by the bed . 
  i ca n't make out the handle . 
  - you appreciate organization and like to keep mementos , you probably have a box under the bed or in the closet filled with little trinkets . 
  - the spark plugs probably go to a project you have been putting off , or maybe you have an older model car due a change . 
  you do n't want to do it in this weather . 
  - you do n't have all the bulbs in your overhead light lit , maybe because you like the ambiance , maybe you just have n't changed it . 
  - this is the second story of a house built in the 30s or 40s . 
  neighborhood would be considered working class . 
  - ca n't tell much else just because of the picture resolution , the `` thanks baby '' makes me think you have a girlfriend and what might be a rifle case to the right of the door makes me think you and your father hunt regularly , the crossbow was probably a gift from him . 
  nope , just like ted talks and that just happens to be the one i intended to see next . 
  here you go universe ... 
  stories like this have the odd affect of shocking me for a brief moment ... then an almost resigned `` of course '' reaction to the massacre being perpetrated by a fundamentalist muslim group . 
  i do n't know what the right response is . 
  dialogue has been too vague and circular . 
  how do we fix this ? 
  in any event , this is 2,000 families , 2,000 lives just as vivid as our own . 
  they should not be forgotten because of their location or color . 
  this , so much this . 
  the west as a whole , media and government especially are guilty of repeatedly ignoring the measured reasoning behind these attacks . 
  they have their motives , they have clearly laid them out . 
  it 's time we listen/react and stop blaming social/economic/political issues of the moment . 
  male , europe , i 'd say mid 20 's / over 24 . 
  you have spent time in asia and the middle east ( the framed ceremonial dagger image/where was that found ? ), 
  and brought the mask/picture on the wall in the right of the image from venice . 
  i want to guess you live in central/eastern europe from the wall mounted ac unit/the il-2 sturmovik model plane on the top of your shelf , the brand of the tv , hockey figure and the gas mask which i think is of warsaw pact origins . 
  you smoke though i might venture to guess cigars from all the butane and zippos . 
  then again , why so many cigarettes ? 
  a collection or just experimenting with flavors ? 
  maybe you brought back unique packs from the places you have visited . 
  i ca n't make out what you have on the bottom right , but i see prague maybe ? 
  how did i do ? 
  first of all , thank you for taking the time to offer such a well thought out comment . 
  it seems that there stirs within islam a recipe for violence and call for domination unlike any other religion . 
  western commenters are quick to blame current political or economic factors for the steady tide of fundamentalist muslims willing to shed/spill blood for their beliefs . 
  however if you simply listen to their leaders , listen to their own statements in the all too common interview filmed before a suicide attack or beheading , they have stated their reasons and the reason is islam . 
  there is the dar al harb and the dar al islam . 
  the ummah , the kuffar . 
  if a muslim follows the instructions in the quran and seeks to mirror muhammads life as it was recorded , violence against the non-muslim world comes across as a pretty clear instruction . 
  what do you think ? 
  wow . 
  as soon as i read the headline i knew who you were talking about . 
  he 's approached women i was with individually/with groups of friends out and about asking to photograph them nude . 
  i am not the type to be worried about men talking to a gal i 'm with but his whole demeanor was just ... off . 
  one girl actually did meet him for photos ... at a house with very little furniture - she was sketched out - but not enough to keep her from driving with him in his car to the middle of the lowlands where she took her clothes off for him . 
  i do n't know how she felt safe . 
  did you ever have reservations about her being with other men ?
