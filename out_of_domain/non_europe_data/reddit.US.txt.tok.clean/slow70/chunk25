  i really like the perspective you have . 
  i am coming from one where sex is the most intimate thing you can share with someone , i feel like its a precious thing that if given too freely loses its value . 
  i am a hypocrite when it comes to holding that standard to myself , but it does affect my thinking when it comes to my partner . 
  i ( 26/m ) came here to ask the exact same questions , though mine were not as eloquently posed . 
  thanks / u/polytaway2014 for a starting point in the answers here . 
  source : currently reading `` the price of glory '' on the battle of verdun . 
  this is my first dive into a thorough account of the first world war and at the stage of the book i 'm in now , the battle of verdun has been raging for some four months . 
  at this point in the battle the best prepared trench-lines and communications trenches had been churned time and time again by shellfire , where original trenches had been , a series of shell craters typically remained . 
  portions were buried and reburied , caved in , filled with rainwater and muck . 
  the dead from previous combat left where they fell , discovered as new trenches were dug or blown to such small portions that `` every square meter was occupied by some amount of decomposing human flesh '' . 
  yes they dug new trenches under fire and reinforced damaged lines . 
  usually at darkness with the fear that a flare or a barrage would catch the men in the open , nevermind the fatigue the men would surely face depending on how long they had been on the line . 
  the germans were known to have some of the best quality trenches and the french the sloppiest with the english and americans somewhere in between . 
  the french often suffered because of their habit of digging out individual shelters in the forward side of the trench which were prone to caving in during a bombardment . 
  it 's estimated that by the battles end , over 150 shells fell and 1,000 men were killed per square meter of the battlefield . 
  all physical evidence of over 150,000 casualties erased by the constant churning of earth by artillery fire . 
  it 's no wonder this battle left the scar that it has on europe . 
  check out the book i mentioned in the beginning . 
  edit : just wanted to add . 
  the very nature of the battlefield meant that open ground was dead ground if in range of artillery or as the case of the forward lines - machine guns . 
  forward trenches were resupplied by a network of communication trenches which then connected with secondary lines of defense . 
  basically there was always another trenchline behind the one that had just been taken and due to the slow exchange of ground , there rarely was an entrenched force facing an enemy hastily trying to dig in . 
  if that is what you were imagining . 
  this . 
  as a veteran here i thought `` neat , first female veteran in the senate . '', 
  only to find she deployed to kuwait once in 20 years . 
  a lot of war has been going on around her in the meantime and the iowa arng has apparently deployed to iraq and afghanistan several times . 
  i hope this gets fact checked and thrown in her robotic face . 
  * i ca n't help but scoff a bit at the mention of combat in afghanistan ending ... i hope he says more on this part of the world later . 
  ( i 'm writing this from in afghanistan ), 
  * notice boehner 's and indeed most of the republicans reluctant clapping when the economic gains are mentioned . 
  * on energy : we may be more competitive in the energy sector than a few years ago , but the price drop in oil and the saudi decision not to act as a swing producer to balance the market means that all these offshore rigs , shale and tar sand projects in the non opec world will fast become unprofitable . 
  us producers are already losing money . 
  if i remember right energy investment in the us oil sector has already dipped 37 % since oil began to drop . 
  this will swing back to hit us and could hit hard . 
  * 31:51 my god the partisanship !, 
  look at all those stern faces . 
  how bad it is that millions more americans have health insurance !, 
  * i am noticing a theme ... good news for america , republicans put on stern faces and do n't clap . 
  * affordable child care !, 
  paid sick leave !, 
  equal pay for women !, 
  alright !, 
  * around 42:30 ... probably the first president to say `` up our game '', 
  * 44:30 ish oh bernie sanders you, 
  * `` hire a veteran '' ... thank you, 
  * faster trains and faster internet/pipeline slam !, 
  * 51:50 ish going to mars ... i think we need to keep pushing the envelope , it inspires us all . 
  * 53:00 oh man corporate tax, 
  * 54:40 ish ... and look who stands for the monied interests ... 
  * 56:00 plus : so many thoughts here ... the response has been measured , occasionally misjudged , but it has been smarter than lunging in with no plan . 
  the authorization of force against isil ... . hopefully we can get things done . 
  * on iran : bravo ... diplomacy has been working and we have a potential ally against sunni extremism in the region , a natural counter-balance to saudi influence ... once again the hawks stay silent . 
  * 1:04 ish and look at the republicans sitting silent on climate change ... this is beyond frustrating . 
  `` and the best scientists in the world are all telling us that our activities are changing the climate '', 
  * 1:06:10 ish he said `` we done '' and looks temporarily enraged at the teleprompter . 
  i do n't know that i 've heard him misspeak before . 
  someone may be getting fired . 
  * 1:08:26 another telling shot of our government ... the denouncement of discrimination against a long list ... and yet there are jeers ... and yet the republicans sit in silent disapproval . 
  * 1:13:10 ish `` from a wedge issue to a story of freedom '' and there is a ways yet to go . 
  again the division is apparent . 
  * 1:15:00 ish so much this, 
  * 1:17:00 why would the republicans sit silent at the mention of ensuring citizens have the right to vote ... 
  * 1:18:30 this is exchange is great !, 
  i wonder which republicans started that clap . 
  * strong finish , now for the rebuttal !, 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0stihqv6yjq ... 
  * man i hate that i find myself so virulently opposed to republican stances here but how can anyone not be ?? 
  they simply are not for us . 
  bought and paid for , a force of regression and division . 
  * their unwillingness to reach across the aisle has been apparent some time and their display tonight shows where they stand on issues ... against the economic gains , against equality , against better access to healthcare , against diplomacy with iran , against corporate tax reform , against simple science ... where does it stop !, 
  * keystone right off the bat . 
  tax reform sounds like a lot of smoke and mirrors when you think of their typical stance . 
  her whole demeanor has that feel of a politicians 15 second promo during election ... only they seemed fake in 15 seconds , let alone a 20 minute speech . 
  * 19:20 ish `` republicans think tax filing should be easier for you '', 
  why do i feel like she 's talking to a elementary school class ? 
  * 20:00 he just called for action against isil ... he is n't wishing them away . 
  * looking up more on joni ernst thinking `` awesome , first female veteran in the senate '', 
  in 20 years she deployed only once to kuwait ... there has been a lot of war going on in the meantime ... 
  * i want so bad for there to be things to agree on ... but everything is mentioned as either an independent effort or stands in contrast to my values . 
  lots of buzz words and generic statements that seem to me would only appeal to those who do n't pay attention to politics beyond what fox news will spoon feed you . 
  * i ca n't help but scoff a bit at the mention of combat in afghanistan ending ... i hope he says more on this part of the world later .
