  the nature of their work , print media in a nation that champions freedom of expression and free speech is something worth defending , even lauding when it becomes threatened . 
  of course sanctity is relative and the iranians are welcome to carry on with their contest , the very nature of which is petty in vindictive . 
  that was my sole point in the root comment . 
  i 'm not sure what there is you 're getting hung up on when there are far better arguments to be had elsewhere . 
  and from an objective stand point ... mocking ongoing evils in the world is very different from mocking the systematic murder of millions . 
  so please , do n't try to speculate what i might or might not understand from a single sentence and you would do well not to speculate on the motives of the dead . 
  noun : satire, 
  the use of humor , irony , exaggeration , or ridicule to expose and criticize people 's stupidity or vices , particularly in the context of contemporary politics and other topical issues . 
  dragging up the murder of millions 70 years after the fact in a deliberate effort to offend a specific group is not satire . 
  if you wanted to stretch it , the only real tie in is that jews were victims in the recent violence as well . 
  in any event , they are being petty , cruel and vindictive . 
  that does not mean i would take away their right to be so . 
  have you got any more broad speculations/generalizations you 'd like to throw out ? 
  looks great but what exactly is yerba mate ? 
  ** submission statement : ** there has been lively debate about the bounds of free speech following the recent violence in paris . 
  i personally feel the iranian initiative to encourage a series of holocaust related cartoons fall outside the realm of satire with their willful intent to offend absent a current context . 
  this article continues the discussion . 
  ** submission statement : ** the story of warsaw 's occupation , division , uprising , destruction and rebirth is an amazing one that remains unfamiliar to most . 
  warsaw went from a population of 1,300,000 pre-war to less than a thousand hiding in the rubble of a city systematically destroyed by a departing occupier . 
  the photos in the link were taken by a team of american architects surveying the damage and reconstruction efforts in post-war europe . 
  vivid color images capture a living ruin of the city , life somehow carrying on prior to the surge of reconstruction that recreated the polish capital we know today . 
  thanks for the input !, 
  i had no idea about a quarantine period that long . 
  as for food , what i 'll really be on the hunt for is jimmy dean sausage . 
  i kind of look forward to the hunt . 
  i 'll shoot you a pm soon i 'm sure . 
  ( i have never been so conscious of exclamation points in my writing before . 
  do we type loudly too ? ), 
  we have a similar group just called the american legion with the same purpose in the us . 
  not many young veterans make use of it as the buildings are usually in disrepair and often empty . 
  i imagine british pub culture would make it a different experience over there . 
  a lot of us do smoke cigars it seems . 
  i only smoke socially but some of my fondest memories are of a bunch of guys getting together after a long day/mission and having a cigar while listening to blues music and having good conversation . 
  i guess it 's what we turned to absent a pint . 
  i understand the confusion with ` vets ' . 
  i would do my best to offer encouraging words to any hamsters i happen to be handed . 
  would credits carry over just the same ? 
  well that might affect my thinking then . 
  i am really not sure how to feel about kingston . 
  i had the idea that at the very least it 's a foot in the door if i 'm not given an offer to the other schools . 
  i would hate to waste an academic year though . 
  i understand completely about the hollow worship soldiers seem to receive in the us . 
  i think our population should be more critical of a group of people just like any other with good and bad among them . 
  the atlantic had a great article last month on this exact topic . 
  i do n't expect any special recognition being a veteran , but it is nice to be around those who have been through the same suck . 
  it 's easy to feel disconnected without someone else around who has shared those experiences . 
  i 've heard of reese 's shell topping from visitors but i have never seen it in the us myself . 
  maybe i just do n't spend time in the ... whatever aisle that would be in . 
  i appreciate that feedback on transfers , i ca n't imagine a professor holding someone back if they found a better opportunity . 
  thanks for hitting so many points !, 
  you guys have really helped with the foundation for this move . 
  regarding american food , i have to say ... i ca n't believe you all have a five guys in london . 
  those are probably the greasiest burgers available second perhaps only to checkers . 
  god help your arteries . 
  source : american , burgers , enough said . 
  do you guys do sausage and eggs mixed ? 
  sausage and eggs with coffee cake is a christmas time tradition of my family . 
  eggs , jimmy dean sausage and way too much creamer . 
  simple . 
  i have to spread the joy . 
  yeah , you throw the sausage on the skillet , break it up finely and cook until it starts to get just a little crispy on the outside . 
  mix the creamer and eggs in separate bowl and pour over the sausage . 
  the idea is to coat the sausage all around and mix it together . 
  that way you are n't eating a clump of sausage alongside a clump of egg no no , the two mate and create something sublime . 
  i have no idea if that is something you could find in a diner over there . 
  i swear i 've tried other sausages , but jimmy deans is the best . 
  keep your eye out for this and do n't look back . 
  heavy cream i mean, 
  sure !, 
  i have wanted to attend a university offering business and journalism/international relations programs . 
  kings college war studies or international relations is what i really hope for . 
  i applied to westminster and kingston as well after looking up what schools in greater london offered a mix of those programs . 
  in hindsight i wonder if there are n't better choices within the city that i missed , which is part of why i ask about transfer after year one . 
  i am still going back and forth with kcl and i have n't heard from westminster yet . 
  what 's the deal with ryanair ? 
  are you kidding me ? 
  the paris we know and love today was the result of meticulous planning and regulation by georges-eug\u00e8ne haussmann . 
  it was planned order and form that gave the world the city of light so loved by so many . 
  sure cities could be horrible places to be from the middle ages to the industrial revolution but fortunately we have advanced beyond the point of throwing waste out of windows and letting pack horses rot in the street . 
  progress has allowed us to build better cities only we have forgone the human element . 
  that 's just it , for all their faults cities were built for people , at the scale of people . 
  now we seem to have lost sight of that . 
  ( not to say their are n't schools of thought moving in the right direction , but by and large the groupthink seems to move in the other direction . ), 
  abe 's on lincoln has open mic night on mondays and molly mcphereson 's on congress every tuesday . 
  you 'll see some amazing talent there . 
  i feel i learned a lot about how to be and not to be a good parent courtesy of my parents own traits and the traits of the three step parents i 've had as well . 
  - i will never put down my kids/actively intimidate/threaten them, 
  - if i wind up splitting from an eventual baby-mama ; i will never project my bitterness or anger about an ex onto my children . 
  - religion ... that was a tough one to get out from . 
  - i will never make my kid feel guilty for asking for anything . 
  i could go on and on . 
  my father was an ass . 
  fortunately i had positive role models as well , but i still note the negative affects he had on me as a person . 
  empathy, 
  you 'll get a better idea of who you are . 
  with that comes self-confidence and the ability to direct growth . 
  there is a path ahead of you to being a better man/woman , keep pushing through the weeds . 
  i was of the impression that is was simply that the bombs were falling on jungle and lines of communication running through them . 
  the vc had little trouble repairing what were generally dirt paths through the forest . 
  if one path was thoroughly destroyed the traffic would simply divert to another nearby .
