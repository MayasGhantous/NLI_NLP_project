  glory perhaps , but many who come to the fight already have decent lives ... think of the european fighters , the american from florida who drove a dumptruck filled with explosives into a syrian army checkpoint . 
  i probably could n't find the video again , but it really stuck with me the first time i saw a video showing a wealthy , married , educated saudi go to iraq to blow himself up in another svbied attack ... all the conventional excuses apologists toss out were gone and his speech echoed what the top ideologues preach again and again ... jihad against the apostates and the kuffar was his motivation , the establishment of the caliphate and to echo the call for others to join . 
  it 's almost like fighting the japanese in wwii , how do you win against an enemy that does not fear death/who have no material motives ? 
  edit : and honestly if you can find something showing isis/aq/any muslim fundamentalist group flatly using sex , money and power to recruit ... i 'd like to see it . 
  even the videos showing a bride auction in northern iraq were more to show the application of islamic law in affect , not to lure fighters for women . 
  excellent post first of all . 
  your argument boils down to essentially , and let me know if i 'm mistaken , that `` islam is being violently misrepresented by a narrow lot who fail to heed scholarly authority and tradition . '', 
  ok , so the impassioned argument you made needs to be had within the muslim world . 
  it seems that the fundamentalists are winning the battle over the minds of young muslims and even if the majority never turn to actual violence , the minority that do are capable of terrible barbarism . 
  so you ignore their stated beliefs and goals . 
  you operate with a completely iraq-centric belief , ignoring that islam ( and extremist elements within islam ) come from a wide range of locales . 
  and you in general seem to lack a common sense world view that well , ** islam is responsible for a disproportionate amount of violence around the world ** . 
  the question is n't if it is a more violent religion but why and how can it be helped . 
  that is not to imply that the fundamentalist elements are correct in any sense , only that they are doing what they are doing out of a ** fundamentalist interpretation of islam ** . 
  period . 
  i completely agree with your points but the bottom line is there is no way to get humanity to collectively reject religion anytime soon . 
  so then where do we direct an appeal ? 
  what do we appeal ? 
   its texts are inherently militant, 
  it seems obvious and millions of fundamentalist muslims would agree but we ca n't make that observation aloud without being called a bigot or brushed aside as ignorant of the ` real ' islam . 
  you can see comments of that ilk here . 
  i think this very discussion , the discussion flowing from this article elsewhere online is the right direction but how else to counter this ideology and create a constructive discourse about it ... i 'm not sure . 
  those statements are from obls declaration of jihad on the us right ? 
  since you speak of cherry picking , i remember clearly the fatwa establishing itself early on as fitting in line with islamic theology . 
  while obl justified the call and sought to rally muslims with a wide range of abuses/perceived abuses against the ummah the core of the call is rooted in that same theology isis follows . 
  while the west 's argument and understanding may shift ... the sunnah will not and as long as there are muslims studying their holy texts , there will be those calling for violence/shariah and seeking to create a reality simply incompatible with modern values . 
  so no , i am not cherry picking from among their stated beliefs rather i am looking at what is common among not just isis or aq , aqap , hqn , milf , al shabaab , god there are so many ... so many whose root philosophy and call to action is based on islamic texts . 
  every frontier of islam has these violent elements including the populations of immigrants in western europe . 
  this is not in dispute . 
  a further look at history compounds this view . 
  i 'd ask you to look beyond the short term . 
  do not forget the wrongs of the west but do not wrap yourself in this apologetic sentiment that ignores the common element in this problem we all face . 
  edit : this just happened . 
  muslim minority uigher detonated suicide vest and kills 8 . 
  ca n't really blame that one on us troops in ksa can you ? 
  they 've already filmed children executing `` spies '', 
  as much as i like the innuendo in the comments below ... what is the deal with the oxo tower ? 
  is it because ` oxo ' references kisses and hugs ? 
  is it because there is a romantic restaurant on top ? 
  all i have heard leads me to picture a few dozen pimply teenagers and one odd thirty year old necking each other and taking home to-go boxes of the thick awkwardness that hangs in the air . 
  ( american - not living in london yet - understandably unaware ? ), 
  i appreciate your well laid out comments , but i feel we will just have to disagree . 
  islam is not just a dressing on top of other grievances , it is core . 
  * islamic * fundamentalism/extremism/terrorism is a problem that must be addressed . 
  you can not hope to fix what you refuse to properly identify , just as you can not seek to re-frame the very reasons these groups have identified all too clearly for us . 
  romance flavored stock cubes ? 
  i am working in kabul right now and just could n't get internet connectivity up till about 20 minutes ago . 
  `` the sale has ended '', 
  i am not giving up but i am feeling that sinker right now . 
  amazing post and story man . 
  thanks for sharing . 
  veteran here who has wanted to do the trail for years ... just have n't made/found the time yet . 
  a couple questions for you . 
  1 ) how did your gear change from beginning to end ? 
  what did you wind up not needing that you had initially and what did you need/wind up having later that you did n't know to start ? 
  2 ) people that did the trail alone vs in a group or with a partner . 
  what are your thoughts there ? 
  i guess you would never be too alone as you would see other hikers and could make friends , but what difference did you notice in the moods of those hikers ? 
  ** submission statement : ** the last [ thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/truereddit/comments/2w29hf/what_isis_really_wants_the_islamic_state_is_no/ ) produced a good deal of discussion and critique of the initial atlantic article ` what isis wants ' . 
  here , the author , and a number of isis supporters respond to the reception of that piece . 
  these are horrible . 
  what is going on here r/architecture ? 
  abe 's on lincoln mondays and molly 's on tuesdays both have great blues music . 
  every single week . 
  first off , savannah loves you guys . 
  i 'm out of town but i hope the jinx treated you right this last show . 
  - the night ` savannah almost killed me ' was inspired by ... do you know where you guys wound up ? 
  any details from that night you remember or could elaborate on ? 
  - how has falling in love again affected your thoughts on songs about past heartbreak ? 
  does it feel like a story already told or have they lost their weight in a way ? 
  i ask that as someone who was blown away by i hope he breaks your heart and the way a whole crowd seemed to be together in remembering the same thing . 
  and thanks for doing the ama !, 
  that guy just looks so happy to be playing a guitar . 
  that has got ta be contagious . 
  i think i 've seen you guys three times at the jinx , including the first . 
  i did n't know the words yet but dammit everyone else did and those songs soaked in deeper than the five dollar tall boy-whiskey specials i kept ordering . 
  there is lots of talent out there sure , but you guys really do have something special . 
  we 're all lucky you chose to keep on keeping on . 
  now how the hell does one get invited to one of these pre-show bbqs ? 
  that 's a hell of an answer . 
  i had no idea you guys met there . 
  there is something in the sweet air of that town that plays with the heart i swear . 
  savannah , ga. ... 
  the most beautiful american city i 've ever seen/lived in . 
  just big enough , just small enough , loud enough , quiet enough , quirky , creative , friendly , 20 mins from the beach ... 
  and downtown completely walkable ... with an open container nonetheless . 
  this post does not properly convey my love for the place or the many practical reasons that it 's an amazing place to call home . 
  come visit . 
  you 'll see . 
  any specific questions you can think of let me know . 
  there is an / r/savannah and i 'm sure people there would be happy to help out too . 
  i also recommend looking up `` visit savannah '' on facebook and just browsing their pics or liking the page . 
  i promise i 'm not some tourism lackey either , the city won me over is all . 
  resident here , debating saying wonderful things about the city and pretending we have a secret to keep . 
  i am out of town . 
  i ca n't tell you how badly i wish i were there for this . 
  good luck with the sale !, 
  i explored the old hospital now used as the savannah law school as they were gutting it , i 've also checked out the old grain facility on hutchison island and an abandoned hotel/apartment/unsure complex south of president street before you hit truman parkway . 
  there is lots more and i wish i were around to join you guys . 
  post some pics when you get to it !,
