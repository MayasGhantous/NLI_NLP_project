  assuming the jury is n't from the bible belt, 
  and operates with any capacity for logic , the verdict would be swift . 
  remember you are 99 % atheist/agnostic . 
  you deny thousands of ancient gods and hundreds of currently worshiped deity 's as well . 
  by the circumstance of your birth you are christian . 
  i guess hell is filled with billions of chinese who just were n't lucky enough to be born in the civilized , christian , our beliefs are better than yours west . 
  one man 's religion becomes another man 's fairy tale . 
  as zeus and baal and anubis are spoken of now , so too will jesus one day . 
  assuming muhammad is n't still being worshiped , mankind will be better for it . 
  `` and remember - it has always been the folly of youth to belittle the wisdom of older folks who have lived and experienced far more . '', 
  this implies that i should just shut up and heed your words . 
  that wo n't do much for your argument here . 
  never mind the men who disagree with religion happen to be older and wiser folks who have experienced far more than me as well . 
  amazing the different conclusions life brings people to . 
  so what truth brought you back , confidently to religion ? 
  what made you truly believe ? 
  what evidence is there ? 
  you said you went questioning but never said what brought you back . 
  i still do n't see how you can discount a world of professional opinions and knowledge to claim the earth is little older than the pyramids . 
  there is so much i could say on this , but i worry about offending you . 
  so far this , as with other debates where i did more research , has only strengthened my opinions . 
  pascal 's gambit is still the best argument for religion i see , as cold and calculated it is . 
  seems to me an omniscient god would see through it and prefer honest doubt to feigned belief . 
  i love you dad , try not to get bitter about this .

  subject : re : faith and intellect, 
  well - i waited a long time for some kind of response from you - and in order you chose to be insulting and condescending within the first few lines . 
  whether your mom has anything to do with this or not is completely absolutely beyond the pale of your `` discussion '' - and i think even you sense that you were insulting by your closing words - `` try not to get bitter about this '' . 
  since you chose to quote from someone famous - allow me to share a few others from that `` collective knowledge of men far better read than . . '', 
  `` god exists whether or not men may choose to believe in him . 
  the reason why many people do not believe in god is not so much that it is intellectually impossible to believe in god , but because belief in god forces that thoughtful person to face the fact that he is accountable to such a god . '', 
  `` there is no neutral ground in the universe : every square inch , every split second , is claimed by god and counterclaimed by satan . '', 
  `` the greatest act of faith takes place when a man finally decides that he is not god . '', 
  `` the atheist can appeal to nothing absolute , nothing objectively true for all people , it is just mere opinion enforced by might . 
  the christian appeals to a standard outside himself/herself in which truth and qualitative values can be made sense of . '', 
  peter huff, 
  `` the real attitude of sin in the heart towards god is that of being without god ; it is pride , the worship of myself , that is the great atheistic fact in human life . '', 
  oswald chambers, 
  and i could go on and on ad infinitum . 
  but the bottom line up front - is that some of the greatest minds in history have realized in their own searches for truth that there is a god . 
  what follows afterwards - always - is what are you going to do about that simple fact ? 
  more importantly , you know for a fact that someone named jesus christ walked the earth almost 2000 years ago . 
  and what will you do with that fact ? 
  where will you choose to stand ? 
  which jersey are you actively putting on ? 
  as i said before - you have n't taken the time to fully develop your intellect and that is a damn shame . 
  like genius wasted - but more common than you might know . 
  i read and will ignore most of your insulting , poorly formulated and rambling attack on the christian faith ; although i know you well enough to understand some of it is you deliberately baiting . 
  i recognize that you still do n't seem able to construct a solid `` scientific '' foundation for anything you want to cite and instead choose to stoop to personal attack rather than any kind of logical point versus counterpoint . 
  but you are terribly wrong - and time is running out to figure where you will stand -, 
  jesus - will never be known as zeus , baal or anubis . 
  none of them ever had anyone say - '' . . at the end every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess ... '' baal is just another namer for lucifer - and you ought to know that - while zeus was a mistaken attempt to name a senior god and anubis . . , maybe you should study more before you mix these false gods up with one another . 
  or if you prefer , mix neptune , beelzebub and aphrodite - since it makes just as much logical sense . 
  you ought to take some time out of your busy schedule to read and study philosophy -- start with great thinkers who wanted to prove that there was no god . 
  i wo n't be bitter - but will remain pissed off at you . 
  shame that you wasted the chance to discuss this subject .

  dad i said in the very beginning ... `` i do n't mean to be condescending or insulting when discussing this , but it 's hard not to come off as offensive when challenging someone 's belief . 
  `` and yes , anything and everything related to mom is completely unrelated to this discussion , yet you saw fit to bring her into it only to insult her intelligence . 
  i have an issue with religion ; i have an issue with christianity . 
  what do you expect me to say ? 
  in any event nothing was an insult to you , so why are you taking it so personal ? 
  knowing you i thought you might take this route . 
  i do n't see why it 's so hard to remain level in this discussion . 
  `` it was , of course , a lie what you read about my religious convictions , a lie which is being systematically repeated . 
  i do not believe in a personal god and i have never denied this but have expressed it clearly . 
  if something is in me which can be called religious then it is the unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our science can reveal it .

  what has been its fruits ? 
  more or less , in all places , pride and indolence in the clergy ; ignorance and servility in the laity ; in both , superstition , bigotry , and persecution . '', 
  ( james madison ), 
  `` the way to see by faith is to shut the eye of reason . '', 
  ( poor richard 's almanack , benjamin franklin , 1758 ), 
  `` the idea of god was not a lie but a device of the unconscious which needed to be decoded by psychology . 
  a personal god was nothing more than an exalted father-figure : desire for such a deity sprang from infantile yearnings for a powerful , protective father , for justice and fairness and for life to go on forever . 
  god is simply a projection of these desires , feared and worshipped by human beings out of an abiding sense of helplessness .
