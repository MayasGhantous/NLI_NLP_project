  you have been banned from ~ ~ / r/pyongang ~ ~ / r/istanbul, 
  an interesting view , but what other way is there to educate all than to do so in brackets ? 
  go to the parade , then go to a friends backyard and eat/drink there . 
  usually the bored and the brave will venture into the madness and return back to report , that or be absorbed into it . 
  thank you , i 'll reconsider the wording and appropriate sub . 
  i remember at the height of the sectarian conflict , 06-07 in iraq , every single day there were market bombings , bombings at checkpoints , checkpoints set up by sunni groups , by shia groups , each abducting and killing members of the opposite sect as they passed through ... 
  the amount of blood shed in and around that one city , never mind the rest of the country is staggering . 
  and think what that must do to someones psyche , to hear that 100 were killed at the market you frequent one day , a week after 400 were killed at a mosque your cousin attended , a month after that same cousin was abducted and murdered by unknown militants along with a dozen others ... 
  i wish these facts , these images could be driven into the skulls of every american like they have been mine ; maybe then you would never let yourselves be deceived and let into another war like this one which still has yet to end . 
  i was a soldier then , foolish and fickle in my reasons for being there . 
  i 'm sorry the us opened such a pandora 's box in your country . 
  i feel a responsibility to keep reminding my peers that we went there on the urging of a calculated deception crafted by the bush administration . 
  people who walk free today . 
  we should be outraged and seething at the injustice they propagated . 
  yet we carry on and let it lie . 
  how do you handle it as an iraqi ? 
  i figure it might be similar to being a veteran in the sense that you assume most just would n't get it and do n't bother trying to explain , for your own sake . 
  sanders all day . 
  it aches to hear you say you hate american soldiers , most of us genuinely wanted to do good there , to forge a way to peace once everything had fallen apart . 
  may as well say most germans in occupied france wanted to do good there ... meaning i get that it 's a fairly empty statement . 
  i lost people to iraqis fighting us because we were invaders . 
  i lost people fighting us because they were ideological and religious extremists . 
  i saw the brutality they inflicted on the iraqi people and just trying to stop that evil from operating with impunity was enough to justify my time there . 
  just the same , the lies , the leadership that led us into the whole conflict should have been taken to trial long ago . 
  i came to this sub with the same issue . 
  iphone5s that spent maybe half an hour at the bottom of a hot spring . 
  i 'm looking at drivesavers right now but i work abroad , so i ca n't call easily . 
  how did your experience go ? 
  did you mail a hdd in with your phone or have them transfer the data online ? 
  also , what were they able to get off ? 
  just pictures or messages and so on ? 
  how much was it ? 
  ideally i 'd like to have the phone fixed , but if that ca n't be done , i really want the images on there . 
  eleven ? 
  is there any article discussing this ? 
  city hall , the forsyth fountain , an oak , the fish drain pipes , the downtown grid , the monuments in different squares . 
  too many ideas !, 
  this is why i entered this thread . 
  plausible apocalyptic scenario : check, 
  submarines slammed into buildings : check, 
  mutants : check, 
  jetskis jumping over fire : check, 
  sea beasts : check, 
  quad 50 caliber machine guns eating a fortress : check, 
  a treasure map : check, 
  the freaking exxon valdez being rowed by pirates : check, 
  and people have the gall to say this movie sucks ... 
  envy mostly . 
  incredible national parks , world class cities and a more progressive society overall . 
  what we could be perhaps without the republican party/crony capitalism mucking it all up . 
  i just got back from thailand and laos and i met so many awesome canadians , maybe a dozen or so , yet less than half that many americans over the course of a month . 
  i think that says a lot about the perspective you all are likely to gain and the set of values that would make so many reach so far to travel as they did . 
  one of them told me it was probably just because of a beer commercial with people telling cool stories with the punchline `` and he was a canadian ! '', 
  there is the naskh or the theory of abrogation for the quran and the hadiths , wherein the contradictory verses within or between these islamic scriptures are analyzed . 
  typically , whatever came later is deemed to hold final authority , contradictions being explained away as man simply not being ready for one truth and so being told something else before being told something better later on . 
  this can be fairly troubling when you consider the overall tone of the quran and the degree of violence instructed within it . 
  the teaching mirrored muhammad 's life , initially he had to be accommodating of others . 
  later , as a powerful warlord he needed no such pretensions . 
  obligatory pbuh/for her is generous and merciful/etc, 
  at first i thought ... do i know this guy ? 
  i ca n't remember if this story came out drinking with friends at some point or if i just read it here or if i know another who shared your horror . 
  i ca n't very well go around asking who got slapped with their own cum . 
  you win the gold in mental gymnastics, 
  not a very good analogy you 've got there . 
  in any event , no , this is not * my logic * , this is a principle within islamic theology which too few outside of the umma understand . 
  if they did , they would recognize the danger present within and quran and the very clear instructions for islamic domination . 
  piano and guitar lessons do not cancel one another out , they add , to make something better and beautiful ; which is what you were getting at i imagine . 
  only naskh deals with verses which are * contradictory * not * complimentary * . 
   quran for some areas is a repetition of earlier revelations and as confirmed in those earlier revelations it contained abrogations . 
  quran delivered those abrogations and repeated the earlier revelations . 
  i 'm not sure i follow this . 
  ** you should n't be getting downvoted . 
  ** i disagree with your logic , but it is imperative that the world have a glimpse into muslim thinking ** so that we may better understand ** and better respond . 
  ** you should n't be getting down voted .

  jack black was in water world ? 
  i 've forgotten this . 
  have you ever watched fox news ? 
  all of it . 
  not mine , but my ex-gf had an uncle who was a ~ ~ wizard ~ ~ numerologist . 
  at a glance , he had a calm , measured demeanor which was shattered the second he looked your way . 
  there was an absolute wild fire ever present behind his eyes . 
  once his gaze was on you , it felt like standing too close to a fire , a wave of energy coming on , uncomfortable and enthralling at the same time . 
  with a single start , your birth date usually , he could ramble endlessly , the whole time wriggling his fingers , counting digits and pointing to empty space . 
  `` oh so you were born in 1988 ? 
  well 8 , naturally , when turned 90 degrees represents the symbol of infinity , 8 and 8 being two shy of ten , with two eights together you have sixteen which in thracian lore echoed the sixteen warriors sent to fight the dragon of dacia who represented the greed of man , do n't fall prey to greed . 
  since you were born on the sixth day of may , five - six , you are prone to seek and need natural progress , five and six together is eleven which once again echoes two , balance , pairs ... . . '', 
  all i could do was listen in bewilderment . 
  the rest of her family just ignored it . 
  i wish i had a wizard for an uncle . 
  in my own family , i had an uncle who was a chevrolet fanatic . 
  i remember one christmas him hammering nails into the 70s style wood paneling in this lake house the family shared . 
  middle of the living room , he was hammering seemingly random nails . 
  he then wrapped christmas lights around the nails which formed a chevy logo ... no one even remarked on it/found it out of the ordinary . 
  ** the siege of szigetvar : ** in 1566 a 2300 strong hungarian garrison effectively delayed an ottoman invasion force of up to 300,000 intent on attacking vienna . 
  szigetv\u00e1r was divided into three sections divided by water : the old town , the new town and the castle -- each of which was linked to the next by bridges and to the land by causeways . 
  when the ottoman army approached , the hungarians lowered red banners across the walls as if beginning festivities and greeted the army with a single cannon shot . 
  once the siege began , the ottomans drained the waters as best they could , meaning their troops fought in the muck , an effective swamp that quickly led to disease ripping through the army . 
  the siege lasted over a month , each island being defended fiercely during which disease ran through the ottoman camps and ottoman emperor suleiman the magnificent died . 
  the ottomans offered the hungarian defender count nikola zrinksi leadership of all of croatia as an ottoman vassal , which he ignored and continued to fight .
