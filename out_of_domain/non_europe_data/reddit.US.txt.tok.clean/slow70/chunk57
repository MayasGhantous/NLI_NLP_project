  and they share the ideological aims of popular non-terrorist islamists . 
  they are all unified behind a theocratic desire to enforce a version of sharia as law over society . 
  considering that non-violent wahhabi and islamist muslims exist in their millions globally , this drastically increases the potential recruitment pool for jihadists . 
  the insurgency could not succeed were this not so . 
  there is no use in denying it . 
  for many years , liberals -- and i speak as one -- have refused to acknowledge the ideology of islamism . 
  had a coleman inflatable bed at the last burn and it worked great !, 
  one set of batteries for the pump lasted all week , a blanket kept it nice and not sticky , plus whenever i was out we threw a tarp over the bedding so dust stayed off it . 
  my bed was dope yo . 
  i do n't think you read the article ... the group responsible for the attack stated their specific motivation for the attack was to kill non-muslims and the implementation of shariah law . 
  no correlation right ? 
  you must not have been paying much attention to the region or its history , well , ever , if you think islamists are averse to killing other muslims . 
  from the sunni/shia schism since , it 's been all to easy to brand another a blasphemer and claim they are n't a muslim to justify violence . 
  like another poster said , you 're being intellectually dishonest/pulling mental jumping jacks here ... 
   do n't try and lecture me about the persecution of religious minorities in the middle east and other wahabbist hellholes, 
  then do n't make such senseless statements as the one you posted before . 
  unless you can elaborate on the point you were trying to make , you contributed nothing to the conversation and sidestepped the issue before dismissing a substantive article with an ` lol ' . 
   their attack is to generate an armed military response against them in order to gain more followers and sympathizes by putting themselves against a corrupt military and government . 
  there are already regular , if not incessant military/police operations against extremists in pakistan , even if you exclude the fata . 
  so , to * provoke * a military response to gain * sympathy * is why they did this ? 
  is this why hundreds of school children have been massacred by islamists in pakistan ( on multiple occasions ) as well ? 
  or is it because the religion demands it ? 
   historic caliphates have been no strangers to killing off political rivals ... . this was before sunni and shia were ever a thing . 
  historic caliphs ? 
  are you smoking something ? 
  the schism occurred during the power struggle following muhammad 's death did it not ? 
  you 're dismissing their stated goals/intent and precedence to do what here ? 
  i understand you have an urge to defend your fellow muslims , i understand you likely harbor fundamentalist beliefs and values you hesitate to share here and i understand you assume most of us are unfamiliar/downright ignorant of the muslim world , but do n't expect to skate by with such nonsense here . 
  you 're right , this is n't a * new * point of view , but it is one very much needed to challenge the chorus of outlets and talking heads spouting misinformation and nonsense . 
   reinforcing an interpretation that has in some cases been expanded into a kind of extremism on its own . 
  this is an issue i 've talked about for years . 
  as left/center leaning politicians fail to call islamic fundamentalism what it is , right wing personalities have been more than glad to . 
  the xenophobia and racism they draw from only serves to alienate otherwise reasonable people from an uncomfortable truth , but nonetheless , a truth . 
  i am liberal on most every issue on the us spectrum bar a few , the most prominent being my recognition of the threat within islam . 
  i do n't want to be associated with trump or cruz in any way , i hate to agree with them ... . their methods i find wrong , disgusting and downright oppositional to who we are . 
  that 's what you get when only the right suggests a solution . 
   then what is the actual fight here ? 
  we must force ( ca n't say how ) a discussion within islam , at least those living in the west , that will lead to new norms which are in sync with 21st century , progressive values . 
  otherwise we are not compatible and can not leave together peaceably . 
  so the fight is :, 
  ** 1 ) ** calling the problem what it is . 
  stop making excuses for those plainly willing to elaborate on why they do what they do with justifications in the quran . 
  ** 2 ) ** holding islam accountable for the violence preached within it . 
  defining new norms which reject such intolerance and backwards behavior . 
   how do we fight an idea ? 
  a hard question for sure , but one we must seek an answer to . 
  i think knowledge is the start . 
  look at how viciously the taliban and boko haram reject education . 
  look at how prolific the wahhabi madrassa system is . 
  look at how children in isis held areas , in areas with hamas influence are taught to hate and seek jihad . 
  education could counter that . 
  exposure to the world and other ways of living might ... then again , that has been met with rejection in parts of the muslim world as well . 
  western culture deemed corrupting and devilish . 
  on the other hand , did n't the west/christendom work through some of the same troubles ? 
  were n't teutonic knights slaughtering pagans and inquisitors burning heretics in our own past ? 
  the catholic , protestant divide even mirrors the visceral divide between sunni and shia . 
  yet we , for the most part , have moved past that . 
  experienced revolution and hard won enlightenment which allowed the casting away of such bloody anchors . 
  the muslim world has yet to experience this . 
  but globalization is here . 
  we can not wait around for the religion to come around . 
  we can not continue to accept bloodshed in the world 's cities and mutely dismiss continued bloodshed within the muslim world and its fringes . 
  the empty statements separating the threat from islam only serve to exacerbate the problem . 
  the tethering of what should be common sense truth regarding islam to those who are otherwise backwards and bigoted in our own society can not continue . 
  we all must recognize , to borrow from gore on another divisive issue , `` an inconvenient truth . '', 
  funny , i remember checkpoints set up in iraq by sunni groups , sometimes aqi associated , sometimes not , always to detain and murder anyone with a shia name . 
  their bodies would be found in the tigris or dumped in the desert somewhere on the outskirts of town . 
  men , women , children , did n't matter . 
  killed because they were shia . 
  the bombing of the golden mosque , specifically meant to trigger sectarian conflict ... 
  the green banners and portraits of ali carried by the militias which retook tikrit . 
  they themselves seeking revenge for sunni offenses in past years . 
  i do n't know how such a widespread and bloody divide can be dismissed as a ` meme ' . 
  just the same , attaching national boundaries to the equation is silly . 
  the nation states are proxies for respective sunni or shia interests . 
  not the other way around . 
  edit : downvoted for calling out the blatant dismissal of a real world problem ... . of course r/islam, 
  i posted it because the focus was so very direct and succinct . 
  the charges are direct and demand a reevaluation of our present discourse . 
  there is no shortage of nuance , evidence and opposing views on the topic , most of it misses the whole point , which is the point of this article . 
   anything to avoid discussing ideas . 
  this is the issue , most reporting and discussion completely avoids association with islam ( until it ca n't any longer ) then minimizes the association ( with a tired rolodex of excuses ) until the public eye moves on . 
  meanwhile , the right wingers kick up a storm and in it , carry their own brand of extremism further . 
  this does n't have to be long form to be substantive . 
  what do you think ? 
  sounds to me like these theologians , jurists , judges , philosophers and imams are n't resonating with the ummah . 
  meanwhile , the leaders of * countless * violent groups responsible for the deaths of innocents of all faiths seem to be resonating with quite a few ... 
  but then again , there is always a theologian or imam to point to who says ______ person/group/sect are n't * true * muslims and therefore they may be/should be killed . 
  to back up , it does n't matter whose word you take . 
  blood has been and is being spilled and you choosing to ignore it does n't help the problem . 
  could you elaborate on this ? 
  it sounds to me like you 're dismissing the point of this article as if wahhabism and fundamentalist islam were * not * the root of extremism and therefore much of the terrorism we see around the world . 
  that view does n't seem to fit into reality very well . 
  i would very much like to hear your alternative . 
  that 's a good point . 
  perhaps you can only take on so many glaring if reluctant truths at once . 
   i guess people should read up more . 
  that is a passive sentiment . 
  would you wait for countless thousands who have been/are radicalized to ` read up ' more ? 
  or would you rather be part of the change , a voice of reason among your brothers and sisters ?
