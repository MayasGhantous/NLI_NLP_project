  they were built to be driven by and through and to with parking lots and driveways galore . 
  but quality public space ? 
  heavens no . 
  imagine if the green belt had been paved over and replaced with wal-mart style shopping centers and avenues lined with chain businesses of all sorts . 
  imagine if the a4 had instead wound straight into london and through , say , kensington forty years ago . 
  of course , much of kensington would have been demolished to make way , but hey , that highway was needed for all the exurb workers to get into the city quicker . 
  oh , and how about that six story parking garage across from the v&a , nice right ? 
  attention to detail , care and quality are all lacking and it 's commonplace enough that most americans do n't know any better . 
  what 's more , there is usually a newish band of suburban development where those with money tend to move to , while the older suburbs fall in value . 
  newer looks better of course , be it on the chain bookstore or the gas station or on your average roadway . 
  but they are built cheap , and age poorly . 
  the profit motive , generally the short-term profit motive has guided us growth and policy for decades . 
  i 've watched my family build a couple of mcmansions , by most measures , they 've ` made it . ', 
  and yet , watching these buildings go up , it 's shocking how poorly constructed they are and how poor the materials are to boot ; even in ` nice ' neighborhoods ( 250-400k price range/nc ) . 
  a friend of mine in georgia , a building inspector , commented on how it was always a pleasure to inspect older homes for all the quirks and for the fact that so many were built so well , far exceeding code . 
  whereas contractors now have extracted as much profit as possible out of each construction and make cheap structures which barely meet those same codes . 
  cheap is the norm . 
  new is the norm . 
  auto-centric is the norm . 
  in none of those norms is there room for quality public space or serious public consideration . 
  ** tldr : just poke around in google street view in the us/uk/de / elsewhere in western europe . 
  you 'll see the difference . 
  hey / u/elekin , i know there are already plenty of replies below and this 'll probably be redundant , but i 'll add my voice . 
  i 'll try to answer questions first then jump on the overall topic . 
  ** crime : ** drug/gang related mostly . 
  domestic disputes as well . 
  but after years of living downtown i am not really worried about it . 
  i was out and about downtown all hours of the day , countless late nights taking strolls along or with a partner , i never once had a problem . 
  not to say that it could n't / wo n't happen , crime is very real in every major metro . 
  the historic district is flanked by large projects , it will be a long term struggle to ease the problems which lend to the violence we see now , but it 's no reason to lose heart in the community as a whole . 
  ** climate : ** it gets hot . 
  it can suck . 
  but i found myself with far more blissful days at the beach and in the park than anything else . 
  daily , on the days that are n't nice enough to make you pause in awe , it 's still comfortable . 
  pollen is a bitch , but it 's fun to bitch about . 
  the heat too for that matter . 
  thunderstorms are awesome . 
  sun showers followed by hot sun/humidity are not . 
  brace yourself for the utility bill though . 
  ** bugs : ** i 've fought fleas on my dog , i 've lived in four or so places downtown , places less than 20 years old and more than 100 , but i 've never had a problem with bugs in my homes . 
  others i know have . 
  ** auto dependence : ** i generally left my car parked in a lane unless i was heading outside of downtown . 
  i mostly walked and rode my motorcycle around town . 
  you can live without a car , but i recommend a bike/motorbike/car because sometimes , it really is too hot to walk if you can avoid it . 
  i think the city is pretty bike friendly , and it 's getting better . 
  there 's a good network of trail riders and bashers as well as a couple of good bike shops downtown . 
  you 'll see lots of scaddies and locals riding around downtown . 
  ** parking tickets : ** the downtown tax . 
  i 'll just jump on that before going further . 
  christ it can be bad . 
  all the more reason to find off street parking or forgo the car completely . 
  ** mj ** : you 'll have no problem there . 
  sundays there is usually a drum circle in forsyth and people smoke there . 
  you 'll smell it drifting from balconies and courtyards every so often , be smart about it though . 
  ** culture : ** i 'm a former conservative/army vet etc turned stout progressive . 
  i always felt at home and comfortable in my views there . 
  there are plenty of like minds , even a ` drinking liberally ' club . 
  that said , you are deep in a red state . 
  there 's always the tacit knowledge that you are surrounded by those who probably do n't agree . 
  ga will teach you that soon enough . 
  that said , i never once had a confrontation of any sort with someone with opposing views , always respectful disagreements face to face . 
  i 'm happy to lend some visibility to my views and hopefully influence gradual change here . 
  ** locals living in the historic district : ** yes !, 
  maybe you just drift to like minds , but i found friends living on my street , the block over , two squares down , all around . 
  so of course you see them as you go about your business and get to feel at home , literally among friends in the city pretty quickly . 
  it seems many choose to eventually move southside , to the islands , midtown/ardsley to settle down and pay less rent , but if you want the downtown lifestyle , it 's there for the taking . 
  tourists are background noise a lot of the time . 
  sometimes you 'll hate them , most of the time you 'll understand why they 're here and feel a little smug about calling savannah home . 
  ** low-key divey bars : ** you 're good there . 
  tons . 
  low key and divey ? 
  check out abe 's on lincoln or the reincarnation of pinky masters . 
  the rest will come . 
  ** the worst parts of living in savannah ? 
  * getting stuck behind a carriage when you have somewhere to be . 
  * finding yourself surrounded by drunk and aggressive tourists at a bar you had high hopes for if it were n't for the crowd . 
  * the parking tickets, 
  * the occasional traffic jams on the way to tybee, 
  * the times when fancy parkers runs out of chicken biscuits and you 're drunk and this is n't cool . 
  by the way , the line is actually an awesome thing , talk and eat in it if you like . 
  * the wait to sing at mcdunoughs which you feel you should be able to skip around since you 're a local , but the five bachelorette parties are all requesting the same songs and you have n't got a chance . 
  protip : try out molly 's instead . 
  * realizing you spend too much on going out . 
  wish you had more to spend on all the delicious food all over town . 
  * apartment hunting . 
  it 's a jungle and very much luck driven . 
  * the job market . 
  * drivers from florida, 
  * tourists from florida, 
  * proximity to florida, 
  all this said , usually it 's people from savannah talking about moving to portland or asheville or some other bigger city . 
  still , the place has a way of pulling people back . 
  i see near unlimited potential in the city . 
  though i work elsewhere now , i love it unlike any other city , and i 'm not a native son . 
  i 'll return one day . 
   living in the heart of the action has always been where i gravitated toward - and beautiful/serene atmosphere is a huge plus ,, 
  hey homie , forget all the noise . 
  this statement . 
  just move here . 
  what the hell am i being down voted for ?
