  she has gotten in touch with local like-minded girls and performed for some time in the local rocky performances as both columbia and trixie performing a pre-show routine . 
  i have seen dozens of shows mainly in nyc and i 'm certain she would fit in and perform well , i do n't think she knows where to go to get in touch with the community though . 
  is there a forum , an open mic equivalent , a way to join traveling groups or travel to perform with a troupe elsewhere ? 
  what advice or information would be useful to her ? 
  i know this is just a posting on the internet but i believe in her and want her to succeed at something shes dreamed of for years . 
  i 'm looking for pants that will keep me cool and looking dapper at the same time . 
  shorts that are comfortable but would work with a short sleeve button up . 
  and so on . 
  i generally stick to jeans and more formal pants for day to day use and relegate shorts to days working on the car or where i otherwise give no fucks . 
  i 'm ready to do it right this summer/spring . 
  having been lucky enough to live in the united states and abroad , downtowns and sprawl , i feel i have been given a rather diverse perspective to the ways in which people construct their environment . 
  i developed a distaste for our auto-dependent environment built with little apparent consideration for people as well as the buildings plopped into these landscapes . 
  just the same i have come to appreciate the beauty , functionality , quality construction and timeless aesthetics of older many older buildings . 
  as my distaste for cheap , disposable and unsustainable suburbia grew along with a desire for beauty in my everyday environment . 
  i 've decided to pursue architecture in an effort to remedy the affliction as i see as well as contribute to a better future . 
  idealistic i know , but i do n't mind . 
  my question here is about the slant the architecture community seems to have towards modernist and brutalist styles of design . 
  granted i am an outsider looking in , but as i browse reddits architecture related forums , architizer and arch daily i see little but the supposed cutting edge of architecture . 
  in my eyes buildings like the disney opera house , flw 's work , the eisenhower memorial , most everything on the front page of this subreddit , even the new wtc/freedom tower are all the wrong way to go . 
  in the long run i do n't think they will be appreciated as many older buildings are , i think they will go the way of the glass tower , the soviet apartment block and the subdivision as unloved places which fail to integrate into their surroundings and function as part of the human element . 
  they seem artsy for arts sake , gaudy to be gaudy , cheap , impractical and likely to leak . 
  am i wrong ? 
  what do you all think ? 
  monumental egos : `` starchitects '' like frank gehry do not build for people -- they build to shock . 
  i will update this as answers come in , but does anyone have any idea what the ...

  i think i got the picture from a wormland press bit ? 
  the following exchange occurred between my father and i roughly one year ago . 
  we have not spoken since . 
  i am currently in afghanistan and did not hear from him or anyone else in that side of the family for my birthday two days ago . 
  i was raised southern baptist but honestly never believed , though i pretended to and desperately sought god 's truth and conviction of some sort . 
  my father became more and more fundamentalist over the years , particularly so since i left home in 2005 . 
  anyway , here it goes ... . . it gets nasty . 
  i think this conversation is quite insightful and may echo others difficulties in being an open agnostic/atheist . 
  ** tldr : ** father asks how i 'm feeling about religion after seeing a fb post . 
  conversation starts of level but quickly plummets off a cliff and degenerates into personal insults from my father . 
  have not spoken to him since . 
  includes irrational rage , evasion , reference to implied attack by a paladin , lucifer 's jersey and young earth creationism !, 
  ** according to superedo : ** `` it 's great that you 're questioning your beliefs . 
  i did too when i was your age . 
  now as long as you come to the same conclusions i did , we wo n't have a problem here , you little snot-nosed punk . '',

  dear josh - how are you doing ? 
  daphne ( * step-mother * ) tells me that you and becca ( * ex-wife , i left her , phony fundie * ) had some kind of interesting conversation via facebook ( a site i can not access from here ) and it sounds like you are still in the midst of some serious soul-searching and questioning of the christian religion . 
  i do n't know if you want to try and have a conversation via email or not - do n't know if you want to really talk about this subject - or if you have closed your mind and heart to the subject ( like when some stupid officer has his mind made up and does n't want to be faced with any additional facts or new information , especially the kind that would make his decision look truly stupid - yeah , we have all worked for them at some time ) . 
  i was younger than you when i went through a phase of being very doubtful about organized religion and christianity - you could ask my dad but he probably does n't remember ; seems he says that a lot nowadays . 
  no one can tell you what to believe or not to believe - although some things are beyond your ability to deal with - like gravity . 
  you do n't have to believe in gravity but it will still have its effect on you . 
  you do n't have to believe in the power of the sun 's radiation over 93 million miles away ( or whatever ) - but it will burn your skin without mercy if you stay out in it too long . 
  i love you and wish you the very best , as always , in many ways you are choosing your own path now and have for several years , but if you want to talk - then respond sometime ( preferably not after a month or longer ) . 
  remember you are the technical switched-on generation and i 'm from the over-the-hill gang . 
  love - dad,

  race across india in a customized rickshaw !, 
  i 'll be doing the mumbai express next year , planning on making my rickshaw look steampunk/colonial while i wear a pith helmet/cape and occasionally a horesemask ( unrelated ) . 
  two other buddies are joinging me on a seperate rickshaw which they want to make look like a world war 1 tank . 
  any redditors going to join me ? 
  i read off this headline about the estimated number of stars per human and was met with `` bullshit , that 's just all pointless guesswork '' . 
  i couldnt disagree more and i argued at length in defence of the pursuit of knowledge and a better understanding of the universe . 
  you gents are likely far better read than i , what would you have said ? 
  what analogies or examples would you give ? 
  i 'll be there the middle two weeks of july and would like to use one of the companies that offers track rentals to do a few laps . 
  i 'm 24 and so too young to rent the 911 's for most companies , so i 'm shooting for the lotus exige . 
  part of me thinks if i ca n't get one of the better cars i may as well rent an exotic and drive around the mountains for a day instead of the ring . 
  has anyone driven the ring before ? 
  did you deal with any of the rental companies ? 
  how was the experience ? 
  anything you wish you had known beforehand or done differently ? 
  i 've had the priveledge of living in brooklyn , savannah , munich and a quiet ranch in texas . 
  i 've also had the misfortune of living in suburbs of varying qualities , all of them grating at me on a subconcious level . 
  it always bothered me walking out to a sea of uninspired cookie cutter houses and parked cars , only to walk to my car . 
  most recently i lived in savannah , and coming out the front door brought me onto a beautiful tree lined street , brick sidewalks and cobblestone roads lined by 200 year old buildings . 
  it was quiet except for the sound of wind rushing through the trees , spanish moss swaying with it . 
  you could hear muted signs of a city all around , people talking , walking , laughing , cars driving by slowly , an occasional horn or siren . 
  on weekends i could often hear music coming from a nearby park . 
  overall i walked outside and immediately felt refreshed by the beauty around me . 
  it 's something i do n't think most people get , or notice they are missing . 
  `` this extraordinary incompetence can be attributed to the education of architects - rooted in modernist dogma - which encourages them to be heroic geniuses before they become adept practitioners . 
  the buildings of heroic geniuses must be like nothing ever seen before in history . 
  they are also designed to exist in splendid isolation . 
  they therefore occupy space rather than define space . 
  they are anti-social by nature . 
  they necessarily can not fit into an established fabric of buildings by non-heroic non-geniuses . '',

  i think the results are visible here , visible in archdaily , in architizer and painfully so in our streets . 
  what say you / r/architecture ?

  in response to some of the more negative remarks below :, 
  why bash them ( those that said `` thank you for your service '' ) for extending a simple kindness ? 
  i served for years in uniform and i thank those i recognize as veterans and those currently serving when i see them .
