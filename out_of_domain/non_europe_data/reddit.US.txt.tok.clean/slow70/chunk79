  just because i do this as a civilian now i am a heartless mercenary ? 
  i agree the war on terror is hardly `` protecting our freedoms '' or whatever other patriotic mumbo jumbo you hear to justify these conflicts . 
  i think the war on terror has done more to remove american freedoms at home more than anything else . 
  the war in afghanistan removed al qaeda 's unhindered freedom here , they have just moved elsewhere . 
  i ca n't justify our further presence . 
  the war in iraq i ca n't justify at all , but when i served there i removed people who were brutally murdering their fellow iraqi 's far more often than they harmed us , and yes i removed those who sought to do us harm . 
  i see iraq as a giant bug-zapper that for the length of that conflict , gave aspiring young extremists somewhere to go and die fighting armed infidels rather than hatching plots to strike us at home . 
  do n't assume because i served that i have some hero complex . 
  that is bullshit and i see it far too often in soldiers . 
  a sense of entitlement , `` look at me , are n't i cool i use a gun ! '', 
  type thinking . 
  i am not that type , i did my job , i continue to do my job because it pays well for my age , i 'm good at it and it does help protect american lives here . 
  those of you with the automatic disgust for those of us who have held a weapon or had to use one ... well you 're entitled to that disgust . 
  but we are n't all limp dick waving , tap-out wearing juveniles who throw puppies off of cliffs or want to shoot foreigners . 
  most of us are decent folks believe it or not . 
  so i 've posted here before about the lady back home who wants to break out into burlesque and you all provided great feedback . 
  this time , i 'm taking her to europe and we 'd like to see whatever burlesque events we can as we travel . 
  we 'll meet in london , travel to paris then do a few cheetah flips through germany , switzerland and on through northern italy . 
  london looks to have lots of interesting acts , a few i have found include :, 
  * crazy horse burlesque - well rated , expensive , touristy, 
  * the tassle club, 
  * caf\u00e9 de paris, 
  * cellardoor - offers classes before shows, 
  * peacock bar, 
  * proud caberet, 
  in paris we have :, 
  * chez michou - authentic parisian caberet , looks more lgbt than anything else, 
  * moulin rouge - apparently a tourist trap now , overpriced , reviews are mixed, 
  * gentry de paris burlesque review - rated as a world class show , classic feel, 
  i do n't have a clue about what munich would have to offer but i 'm certain there is a scene somewhere in the city . 
  so do any of you have experience with acts in europe ? 
  any suggestions ? 
  uniqlo does n't do e-commerce unfortunately , the closest i 've found so far is this . 
  i 'm heading through europe this summer and i want something tough with a few pockets and a classic look that wo n't be too hot . 
  any suggestions would be great !, 
  after poking around awhile i 'm sort of torn between these three ll bean choices . 
  what do you all think ? 
  would a body decompose , freeze , mummify , or remain essentially `` fresh '' ? 
  not sure what triggered this question , but i 've never heard this question answered .

  i 'm flying into london in a couple weeks after spending seven months in a part of the world where you do n't get to dress too well . 
  i 'll only be in london a day or two before heading elsewhere . 
  i will have a morning to myself and i wanted to know if there was a relative one stop place i could find ... 
  a ) a pair of boatshoes, 
  b ) a couple ties, 
  c ) a light/casual jacket, 
  d ) a generally awesome selection of casual button ups and pants/jeans to choose from, 
  i have heard of harrod 's but worry it will be too massive to navigate in my limited time . 
  also , i 'll be staying just south of hyde park . 
  thanks in advance gents !, 
  i 'll be travelling from london to florence in a couple weeks and can not stand the idea of ending my trip without an ample supply of german beer towards the end . 
  i know bavaria quite well but i have never really looked for beer in italy , it was all wine and aperol spritz . 
  thanks !, 
  i 'll be flying into london in just over a week and travelling east through the following locations . 
  the itinerary is meant to be flexible , room to spend a day or two extra at a place should we choose and room to cut as we choose . 
  basically i just need to wind up in florence at the end of 14 days . 
  i have lived in munich and know bavaria and northern italy fairly well , i ca n't say the same for london , france or switzerland though . 
  ** london **, 
  ** paris **, 
  * day trip to rothenburg ob der tauber, 
  * day trip to bertchesgaden/konigsee, 
  ** verona **, 
  ** venice **, 
  ** florence **, 
  * day trip on a scooter roaming around tuscany, 
  i chose the locations in italy and germany as the best i 'd like to show my girlfriend who has never been to europe . 
  i have been to lake como and milan and begrudingly left them out as well as a number of town in italy , and i will have to cut a few places on this list probably . 
  thing is , i 'm torn between travelling to see as much as i can , and just taking it easy in a place . 
  if anyone can provide any context to the swiss and french locals as to how much time would be needed or what places you 'd recommend , please do . 
  lived in munich a few years as a kid and have been back several times since , lady has never seen the place . 
  we 're both really sociable but my german is n't quite conversational so i figured i 'd look for some conversation/drinking mates here . 
  first round is on us !, 
  background : we 're 20 somethings from savannah , ga. . she 's a nurse , tour guide and burlesque dancer and i 've worked for the government and aspire to be an architect/racecardriver when i grow up . 
  ** did n't expect all the replies , might this turn into an official reddit meet up of sorts ? 
  ** augustiner bierkeller on arnulfstra\u00dfe - 1930 ** we just need a figure a way to recognize each other . 
  i 'm a fairly new rider , fine riding in a decent leather jacket and a half helmet until i started poking around here . 
  after hearing about so many going down and seeing just how much gear can protect you , i would like to get purpose built riding gear . 
  the problem is , most of the gear seems styled for sportsbike riders , which no offense to them , i see as a bit gaudy and excessive . 
  i do n't want to look like a motogp riding 5 miles to work . 
  so what quality/casual/cruiser style gear do you have ? 
  ** pics would be appreciated !, 
  ** allied pilots finding unexploded shells in their aircraft with messages written by forced laborers in german factories supporting the allied effort in their own way . 
  ** the siege of szigetvar : in 1566 a 2300 strong hungarian garrison effectively delayed an ottoman invasion force of up to 300,000 intent on attacking vienna . 
  szigetv\u00e1r was divided into three sections divided by water : the old town , the new town and the castle -- each of which was linked to the next by bridges and to the land by causeways .
