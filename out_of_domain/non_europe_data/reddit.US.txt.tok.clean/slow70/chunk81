  and for the digs rooted in truth , to each their own , everyplace is n't for everybody . 
  keep the butthurt in the bathroom of club one !, 
  edit : loving this , and there are still so many to hear about !, 
  26 year old american here . 
  - i 've got a dog and a motorcycle i love very much . 
  chances of bringing both over ? 
  - still waiting to hear from my choice universities , but i have an unconditional offer from kingston ( journalism ) . 
  i knew little of its reputation and now i 'm a little wary . 
  would it be easy to transfer to another school after 1st year ? 
  - where could i find actual american groceries ? 
  no not crisps and pop-tarts . 
  i 'd like to cook some dishes for friends ; i mean excellent southern breakfasts and steak and potato type goodness . 
  - i am a veteran of the iraq and afghan wars ; are there any places vets are known to meet that might welcome an american ? 
  - how feasible/expensive is it to travel to mainland europe for a few days break ? 
  seasonal trends/specials/budget air/rail ? 
  - anything else that should be known ? 
  i 've traveled to london several times so i 've got the basics i think . 
  do n't speak loudly on the tube , do n't stand to the left of escalators , different verbiage and such . 
  if any fellow yanks are reading this toss me a line , i 'll buy you a pint once i 'm there !, 
  picture of dog attached to garner sympathy . 
  his name is hank . 
  i have a month of vacation time coming up in may and i am really struggling to pick a destination for myself and a significant other . 
  i am working in kabul and she lives in london , i 'll fly back to see her a few days before we start this adventure . 
  ** places considered : ** - southern spain , the south of france , cinque terre/italian riviera , morocco . 
  ** places travelled : ** - ( as relevant ) lived in munich , so much of germany and northern italy . 
  have passed through switzerland and been only to paris in france . 
  she has been to all the places we are considering except italy . 
  ** length : ** i will have one full month , she most likely two weeks . 
  i 'd like to sit still in one place a week or more then hop around . 
  ** climate : ** looking for a sunny , dry and warm place to escape from the afghan winter . 
  a place where we would be comfortable outside all day . 
  ** interests : ** savannah , ga is home to me and part of what i enjoy the most about it is being able to just take a relaxing stroll through beautiful , beautiful public space . 
  if you want busy it 's there , if you want peace and quiet it 's there too . 
  i long for this feeling more than most when i think about where we want to travel . 
  i want to share that feeling with her , explore a beautiful place that is n't overrun with visitors . 
  i like the idea of staying someplace with a homey b-n-b feel or in our own villa someplace removed ( tough finding deals though ) . 
  ** where we need help : ** - considering what i am looking for it seems that all the places considered might fit the bill . 
  please share your experiences !, 
  what region would offer the most if we chose to base centrally ? 
  how busy were these places in may-june ? 
  tell me about that amazing caf\u00e9 , bar , park , treasure off the beaten path !, 
  ** wildcard : ** before i knew i 'd be joined by her i was considering a couple weeks hiking in nepal . 
  i was just accepted into an undergraduate program in london . 
  i 've been out since 2011 but contracting ever since . 
  i 'm still overseas so i ca n't just go into an office to ask about this . 
  anyone have experience using the gi bill in the uk ? 
  i will be trekking the annapurna circuit in early may . 
  i 'll have two weeks in nepal then two weeks in europe . 
  i 'm working in se asia and will be packing clothing for both respective trips ... 
  in order to keep from dragging around a bunch of jeans and button up shirts that i will be wearing in europe , is there a place or policy anyone has taken advantage of to store personal items while taking bare minimum on the trek ? 
  thanks !, 
  i have had a number of amazing experiences and storybook moments with women i 'm no longer with . 
  i hate the thought that those memories will fade with noone to recall them with ... as the former partner is n't around - they may be too intimate for friends and the fact that they would generally be awkward for any new partners to hear . 
  let 's remember reddit . 
  i 've spent the last eight years in the ic working a wide range of assignments . 
  considering the nature of our work and the core skills required to succeed within it , it seems that a transition to journalism would be ideal . 
  i 've been accepted into a london based journalism program starting this summer though i have the itch to work now . 
  would it be worthwhile to look into freelance work or to begin producing in the meantime ? 
  i 'm facing the harsh reality of a decade worth of work being unavailable due to it 's place on secure networks . 
  i find my experience extremely relevant as events unfold in iraq and as the isis tide ebbs and flows , i find myself incensed politically and aching to do something more than throw kindling on a comment string . 
  i want to do something with this drive and not just wait three years to have a piece of paper claim that i am qualified to do so . 
  any input or advice is greatly appreciated . 
  i have lived all over the us , three years in munich and traveled extensively abroad and i ca n't shake the glaring difference in build quality , materials , thought and planning that go into streets in the us compared to europe . 
  it would be funny if i did n't feel such shame and frustration for it . 
  i was planning for an upcoming trip and browsing streetview and this scene - a modern intersection in suburban strasbourg struck me as a perfect example . 
  mixed use , quality materials and construction ... so on and so forth . 
  there is no excuse for us streets to be of such lower quality . 
  i 'll be flying from dubai to kathmandu to start and meeting my significant other in paris after i finish the annapurna base camp trek . 
  this trip planning began with the desire to trek in nepal then relax a bit in europe before handling some business in london . 
  a flame that reignited had me reconfigure the plan to allow for me to complete a shortish trek then spend time with her in europe ( she has ten days ) . 
  my main worry is that i have n't accounted enough time for travel . 
  especially concerned that i 've allotted enough time in nepal . 
  i am up to meeting somewhere besides paris and have considered london or munich as places that might have flights from kathmandu . 
  any hubs you guys might recommend ? 
  i really wanted to go to london after nepal to handle business and allow some buffer time to complete the trek and have her fly in but her work was n't able to provide those days off . 
  any thoughts are really appreciated guys . 
  this place has offered all kinds of help already just with the search tools . 
  but i wanted to ask directly for your thoughts on this . 
  i 'm specifically looking for something along the lines of punchdrunk 's productions . 
  i know they performed the drowned man in london but that ended in 2014 . 
  i was blown away by sleep no more in nyc and would love to find a similar experience in london . 
  does anyone know of anything similar happening now ? 
  spanish moss ... 
  i am working in afghanistan and last time i was here i brought a gerber jar filled with spanish moss from orleans square . 
  that jar is back home packed up now ... but i miss that little connection to home . 
  would anyone be willing to mail me a jar of the stuff ? 
  if so , pm me and i 'll offer my address . 
  i can order you a pizza or something in return ? 
  `` there are monstrous changes taking place in the world , forces shaping a future whose face we do not know . 
  some of these forces seem evil to us , perhaps not in themselves but because their tendency is to eliminate other things we hold good . 
  it is true that two men can lift a bigger stone than one man . 
  a group can build automobiles quicker and better than one man , and bread from a huge factory is cheaper and more uniform . 
  when our food and clothing and housing all are born in the complication of mass production , mass method is bound to get into our thinking and to eliminate all other thinking . 
  in our time mass or collective production has entered our economics , our politics , and even our religion , so that some nations have substituted the idea collective for the idea god . 
  this in my time is the danger . 
  there is great tension in the world , tension toward a breaking point , and men are unhappy and confused . '', 
  moving to london this fall and ca n't help but be a bit bewildered in attempts to make sense of transit times and the like . 
  i need to be somewhere with good links to both leytonstone and kingston upon thames . 
  seeing as they are diametrically opposite ... i could use some help with this in looking for a flat . 
  ** edit : ** i really appreciate the feedback ... you 've given me a far better starting point than i had .
