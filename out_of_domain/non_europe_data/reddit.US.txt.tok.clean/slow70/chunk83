  expired drivers license so i ca n't rent a car , all camp mates already on playa . 
  anyone leaving reno around 1pm tuesday ? 
  if this question is worded terribly , i apologize . 
  a conversation elsewhere on jobs expected to disappear/already disappearing with relative quiet led me to this question . 
  detroit came to mind as a major urban center which contracted violently ( for several reasons of course . ), 
  also , anyone who has driven through the rural south can attest to the many empty main streets and abandoned properties because so many have moved to urban centers and because so few bodies are required to manage a modern farm . 
  it seems like a drastic change if viewed objectively , and yet it 's a change going by mostly unnoticed in my view . 
  for some reason i took no photos inside . 
  there was one message in particular , written on one of the ribs , right hand side maybe halfway into the structure . 
  it took up maybe three feet of space along the spine and was absolutely incredible . 
  there must be a gallery somewhere . 
  [ removed ], 
  i 've just started a personal website which i would like to develop long term , as part of that , i 've finally started pushing content to instagram . 
  i have lots of content from travels in nepal , europe and several locations in the us going back several years . 
  my question is how should i parse this content out ? 
  should i shotgun blast a little bit of nepal here , savannah there day to day ? 
  or should i post all i have of nepal over a time , then all i have of boston , etc etc ? 
  right now it feels really unfocused and i 'd like to fix that . 
  thanks . 
  american , but i will be flying out of london the first week of february , must return to london by the first week of march . 
  last year i had planned a trip to northern thailand in december when the weather seemed to be perfect , ** i 'm concerned now that the weather will not be as favorable or that the rice fields may be burning this time of year ** . 
  i 'm particularly worried about this because i am looking to ride a motorcycle for much of that time and trek the rest . 
  weather looks to be perfect in patagonia at this time , but , my ideal trekking would be without large crowds . 
  ** i 'm worried about how crowded the ` w ' trek on the torres del paine will be ** . 
  also , would much snow remain ? 
  i think both trips would be incredible and there are different aspects of both i am drawn to . 
  the decision depends on those concerns of mine . 
  if anyone here has done one or both at this time of year , i 'd really appreciate any wisdom you could offer . 
  up till now i 've been carrying a 55l ( ? ), 
  rei pack that seems to have been discontinued , enjoyed it , took care of me in nepal , but there are some features it lacks and i 'm looking to upgrade to the kajka . 
  i 've never used a pack this large and since it is n't cheap , i 'm curious if it could be practical enough for the following . 
  * 30 x days in argentina , includes ` w ' trek in torres del paine, 
  * 30 x days thailand , would use to carry all i needed for the month . 
  * 30 x days northern india , strapped to motorcycle frame, 
  * eventual at thru-hike, 
  i 'm wondering if it is n't overkill and just too much for everything . 
  i will be returning to nepal eventually and know this would work well * there * considering the lessons i 've learned there . 
  i just worry i 'll be burdening myself needlessly elsewhere . 
  27 - usa - currently working in se asia - prior military/intelligence community - never attended college/uni, 
  admittedly , i knew going in that would be relying very much on my personal statement and any interviews that might be conducted with admissions personnel . 
  i graduated from us high school ten years ago and did n't much apply myself then . 
  i 've done very well in various assignments since , i 'm confident in my ability , but scores from 2005 do n't reflect that . 
  so , is there any way i can take a levels ? 
  schedule a trip the uk ? 
  i pass through the uk every 90 or so days on business and could take time if need be . 
  basically , i 'm willing to wait another year if i can test well enough to secure a spot at a preferred uni . 
  if i ca n't manage this , i guess i should open up to the idea of clearing/abandoning hopes in the uk altogether . 
  is it ok to contact universities directly ? 
  what about unis that were not among your five choices ? 
  any advice or context that can be offered , i 'd greatly appreciate .

  i 'm more worried than i expected to be . 
  i do n't want to delay higher education any longer and be that creepy old guy in the classroom . 
  doing this remotely so i ca n't physically check out places myself . 
  any good/bad experiences ? 
  [ this article ] ( http://www.theemotionmachine.com/why-its-worth-it-to-pay-the-costs-of-being-yourself ) resonated heavily with me as part of why i so love this community . 
  `` being yourself does n't ` solve problems . ' it simply opens up a new way of living in which there is more depth and more height in the experience of your feelings , more breadth and more range . 
  you feel more unique and hence more alone , but you are so much more real that your relationships with others lose their artificial quality , become deeper , more satisfying , and draw more of the realness of the other person into the relationship . '', 
  ** where ** - right now i am hoping to follow [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/m76cpqp.jpg ) rough path . 
  * mae hong son loop ( pai - soppong - mae sarang - mae klang/doi inthinon - cm ), 
  * chiang dao ( for the temple hike ), 
  * chiang rai ( mostly just as a way station to laos ), 
  * siem riep ( fly to ? ), 
  * james bond island, 
  * back to bkk to fly out, 
  ** length ** - i 'll have just under one month . 
  6th of february to the 1st of march . 
  ** budget ** - i have saved up a good bit . 
  i 'd rather be thrifty as i can with most things though . 
  exceptions to be made for quick travel/worthwhile experiences . 
  ** interests ** - i like to get/feel like i am off the beaten path . 
  peace , beauty , a challenging hike/trek , the feel of actual wilderness . 
  i am a huge motorcyclist and plan to complete the mae hong son loop . 
  ** my questions ** - for all my research , the places listed above is where i most want to go , however , i know i ca n't cover them all/spend the time i might like at each . 
  so i 'm asking for your help in prioritizing . 
  also , what the best way to travel between each place would be/what you wish you had known before going . 
  also , i 'm curious about getting a traditional tattoo , i really like the idea of the monk choosing what you most need , however , i worry it 's the type of thing only douchebags do . 
  ** misc ** i am a hasher ( does n't have anything to do with mj ) and a couch surfer . 
  pretty well familiar with london , but i have n't quite found what i 'm looking for , and searching online seems to throw up more options than i can check out before the date . 
  queen of hoxton 's wigwam ? 
  one of the breakfast club speakeasies ? 
  call me mr lucky ? 
  also , anyone want to have a pint ? 
  edit : i 'm sorry for all those that cringed at this . 
  i 've just arrived in van vieng after spending time in luang prabang and so far , i could not be more disappointed . 
  i find it dirty , cheap , cliche , hollow and completely absent the charm found elsewhere in northern thailand and laos . 
  even the locals seem disinterested and jaded . 
  i was n't expecting or hoping for the party town that was , but i did expect a small , beautiful town with plenty to do nearby . 
  i 've only spent a day in the city so far , so please , let me know if i 'm wrong or what i 'm missing .
