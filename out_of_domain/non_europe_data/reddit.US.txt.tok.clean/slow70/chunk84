  if not , let this be a warning to others . 
  [ removed ], 
  working abroad now but really hoping to make a move back to savannah . 
  know the city but moved for lack of opportunity , anyone have good or bad to say about it ? 
  as the title says . 
  i 'm just not a visually creative guy and could use some inspiration . 
  currently contracting in afghanland so i do n't have any physical records on hand . 
  is there any online/phone resource i could tap into to retrieve these , hopefully in a timely manner ? 
  ** solution : ** for anyone else with the same question . 
  iperms does indeed have them ; should be in your enlistment/reenlistment paperwork . 
  recruiters will have access as well . 
  i keep telling myself to be easy , that i simply ` ca n't see around the bend ' when it comes to where i will be in the coming months . 
  i 'll be returning to the us , maybe for good , maybe not , maybe school , maybe not ... i 'm not sure of what city even if i do stay stateside . 
  i 'm a bit overwhelmed . 
  but i 'm both excited and calmed when i remember that i 'll be seeing all of you this summer . 
  burning man will once again be a landing pad of sorts , and has somehow become the one clear destination ahead . 
  i 'm grateful to have it . 
  former savannah resident here , working abroad and looking to return to the us to work and study . 
  i wish i could go back to savannah but there is n't a college program that fits what i 'm looking for there . 
  i 'm looking for the walkability , quirkiness and creativity , beauty and calm that can be found there , but outside of the southeast . 
  i hope you guys that have been around the block might have a few recommendations . 
  i 'm the only one of my campmates to have gotten a ticket this year ( so far ) and i did n't really find what i was looking for at the theme camp kind enough to host us before . 
  anyone strike out solo and find their tribe ? 
  how did you find a camp that fit ? 
  i 've only had a mac some four months now and with the purchase of a new iphone , i 've begun trying to sync a particular shared photo library from iphotos to my phone . 
  should be simple - but every tool that seems to exist to enable this looks to be disabled because my iphotos library is stored on an external drive . 
  itunes also seems to have disabled the option to sync a selected folder with the iphone , which is how i have handled it on my pc before . 
  ideally , i would be able to sync one folder in iphotos with my iphone . 
  however , ever step so far has been blocked . 
  does anyone know a workaround ? 
  i 'm fleshing out some long term travel in nepal and india - if not elsewhere - and will need to purchase tickets from either dc or london to the area . 
  round trip fares are in the 800usd range right now and i worry that if i delay the purchase of a return ticket , they will cost much more . 
  however , i want to leave the trip open ended . 
  maybe three months , maybe six . 
  as long as i am content and can afford it . 
  any wisdom you all could offer ? 
  i 've been to nepal in april and may , last year in for the abc trek . 
  it only rained a couple of days during my trek , but i 'd rather not knowingly walk into weeks of rain since this is the monsoon season . 
  i 'm looking for a 7-20 day trek that would not be constantly awash in rain or suffer from obscured views and cloud cover . 
  any wisdom is greatly appreciated .

  by the numbers then in narrative form ... 
  - rented from landlord from jul14 - dec15 . 
  - never signed a lease or rental agreement . 
  - no security/deposit . 
  - left for contract in afghanistan in sep14 - still here . 
  - a roommate has lived in the unit this entire time , paying under half of the total rent . 
  - gave landlord notice of departure ,  60 days . 
  - he offered to move property/provide storage . 
  - schedule time and date of move . 
  friend will be at property to assure everything is moved professionally . 
  - scheduled time arrives , landlord is not there , movers are not there . 
  - storage unit items are destined for closes for day . 
  - landlord arrives hours late , packs belongings with no supervision . 
  - landlord contacts friend that evening , threatens to dump belongings as truck rental is due in the morning . 
  - talked down , movers arrive in the morning and unload into storage unit i had arranged . 
  - movers are paid by friend - whom i paid through venmo app . 
  - no damage to unit/no outstanding rent/etc . 
  - fast forward to march . 
  death in the family and i return to us for emergency leave . 
  i visit my storage unit to find a suit and see how my belongings were moved . 
  - i find an absolute mess , damaged property and some items missing . 
  terrible job through and through . 
  - i contact landlord about missing items , he demands payment for the truck and movers far above amounts that were mentioned before and despite the fact that i had paid the movers already . 
  - i refuse , he threatens to throw my belongings on the curb . 
  and here we are !, 
  my landlord and i had a very amicable relationship up until my move out . 
  he had seemed reasonable enough as a landlord and antiques dealer when he offered to find a storage unit for me/hire movers . 
  i found my own unit , he hired movers and assured me of their professionalism . 
  my friend , who was to oversee the move is a landlord herself , with some dozen properties she manages for herself and others . 
  she kept me up to date on the day of the move and the day after when everything was actually placed in storage . 
  she assured me the movers were paid , for their time and gas , etc. 
  ten days after the move , he sends me a message claiming $ 437 for the truck , $ 60 for gas , $ 300 for movers and $ 100 for a water bill . 
  this came as a surprise since i had already paid the movers/truck and for their gas . 
  i told him i would not be paying the water bill as i had not been in the unit in over a year . 
  that would fall on my former roommate . 
  i assumed everything would have been with her or in storage . 
  it was only when i returned to the us for the funeral that i found out the landlord was holding some belongings of mine i had specifically asked him to hand over to her . 
  i have asked him repeatedly about it and he has either dismissed it or sidestepped the questions . 
  now , he is demanding the payments above or threatening to toss my belongings on the curb . 
  for better or for worse , all of our communication has been on facebook and i have record of every statement between us . 
  i also have the word of my friend who was there for the move . 
  i have asked her to pass the contact info for the movers as well so i can get word from them , on there record , as to whether they were paid or not . 
  ** as i see it , my former landlord , whom i had no contract with , is holding my property and threatening its destruction despite the assurance that all my things would be moved professionally into the storage unit as we arranged and as i paid for . 
  i feel like my hands are tied being over here , i also wonder how my options/his too , might be limited because we had no contract . 
  would n't our verbal communications hold bearing ? 
  i really would appreciate any grounding/direction/context you guys might offer . 
  i am probably going to lawyer up anyway , but if i can prevent that cost , all the better . 
  i 'm not over here in the dust because i want to be . 
  ** edit : ** turns out my partner got a receipt from the movers , signed after they received payment from her/me . 
  just sent that to the landlord . 
  also , [ this ] ( http://imgur.com/a/gk4nx ) is what i found in storage . 
  items tossed into boxes with no regard for what might break , nothing at all to protect items or furniture items . 
  many things just tossed in , not in a box or anything ... i 've done a lot of moving over the years but never seen it this bad . 
  came back to warthunder after a yearlong hiatus where i played maybe four hours back then . 
  played il2 for years and happy to find its feel alive and expanded here . 
  questions then :,
