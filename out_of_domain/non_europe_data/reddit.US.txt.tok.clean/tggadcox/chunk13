  pray you keep freeman, 
  is that a newer parenting thing ? 
  i am college aged , and my peers think i 'm wierd because i have never broke a bone ( not for lack of trying , i just like milk ) . 
  but i also grew up still being allowed to play outside , so . 
  nope lol . 
  i 'm 6 ' 4 '' and do things like mountain bike and play tackle football, 
  i 'm 6 ' 4 '' . 
  im pretty sturdy though, 
  got ta watch that interpretive moshing, 
  pm me if you want to talk . 
  not sexual , but ill be your reddit buddy, 
  holy shit the count counts in sesame street, 
  brass monkey . 
  that funky monkey . 
  drink indian river, 
  too bad i was n't redditing during the last wc, 
  this , more than anything , makes me want the game, 
  `` reasonable '', 
  no , unfortunately . 
  i 'm a pc guy, 
  like that audi commercial ? 
  i think someone is a little jealous . 
  went from nc to montana last summer . 
  absolutely amazing trip . 
  bite meat for juicy explosion, 
  not sure if serious or not , but mexicans are some of the hardest fucking workers i know . 
  cut it out you racist . 
  about the convienient timing aspect . 
  there are a lot of days im up on a saturday at 7 am to watch arsenal . . 
  bjoern werner , indianapolis colts, 
  i suppose that makes sense . 
  its easier to make up the sleep if you have a whole other day, 
  i would disagree , but im a night owl, 
  so far professionally it is hard to judge . 
  we are only 2 games into the season ( this is his first year ) so there is n't a big sample size to work with . 
  in college he was a beast . 
  i saw him play live once and he was impressive . 
  he was drafted in the first round , at one point scouts had him as one of the top 5 players in his draft class . 
  so pretty good . 
  why is this so funny, 
  surely , actually, 
  sexy, 
  op i just found your thread . 
  what the hell happened man ? 
  shhhh, 
  you uh , plagarized the top comment, 
  just motivation to pedal faster, 
  the quality of my stream is making me think this game was played in 1996 . 
  kinda nostalgic , really . 
  is it on tv in the us ? 
  i love you . 
  i think like 4 of their regulars, 
  ** bring it you chelsea cunts **, 
  ** let 's beat these motherfuckers **, 
  phil dawson ai n't no zuerlein, 
  if you are ever in ohio and have some laurinaitis gear , wear it . 
  passed through there last year with his shirt on and everyone was so friendly . 
  is it just me or does he look like he has aids ? 
  i thought there was a facemask against quick . 
  then i was like fuuuuuu when i heard it was in the backfield, 
  you obviously do n't realize we actually field a soccer team . 
  hahaha quinn just trucked the ref, 
  kinda, 
  beats a factory of sadness, 
  stop the fucking penalties, 
  espn has turned into the tmz of sports, 
  is n't he married to adriana lima ? 
  3rd down time motherfucker, 
  honestly , i have always thought smith was better . 
  while he is not going to be the most flashy guy every game , he is consistent for the most part . 
  i think people got enamored with kaepernick because of his flashy style , but he is kind of a fluke in my opinion . 
  look for him to go the way of mark sanchez in a couple years . 
  this is one ugly ass game, 
  throw morris in and we got a deal, 
  bet you a peyton we are penalized, 
  tonight , on tnf,

  these are two shitty undisciplined teams, 
  relevant username, 
  well when you get chased as much as he does,

  you are fantastic, 
  yeah he 's a twat, 
  the seats are red, 
  yeah mayock missed that one,

  oh fuck you harbaugh,
