  schottenheimer is such a shitty coordinator, 
  nah , the cards have their own outdoor stadium . 
  i have no idea why the seats are red . 
  revivers ? 
  mayock is right . 
  they need to throw down field . 
  the fucking play calling has been fucking horrendous, 
  no schottenheimer only has a job because he has his daddy 's name . 
  he is a fucking horrible coach, 
  fuck you boldin you 're a cunt, 
  thats what it looked like, 
  its all our coordinators . 
  turned the team to shit . 
  and finnegan . 
  he is a dipshit, 
  fuck this, 
  its been an hour . 
  well ? 
  as a student at the school that invented webassign ... 
  got ta hork the g 's . 
  he screams too much, 
  american here . 
  learned who he was , not his methods . 
  im university, 
  so uh yeah you kinda need to explain the surgery to me please, 
  which is how you format a movie title mid sentence according to mla . 
  you just admitted it was according to mla . 
  which makes me technically correct . 
  the best kind of correct . 
  modern communication tech is so cool . 
  i suppose the good thing is whoever did this obviously is n't very intelligent . 
  so you like the extermination of blacks , jews , gays , romas , eastern europeans and the destruction of countless schools of thought and intellectualism ? 
  idk . 
  the statistical improbability of a mass shooting event concurring twice in the same location in a short time frame is pretty low . 
  edit : i have no idea what the fuck i just wrote . 
  leaving it . 
  ** i 'm so sorry **, 
  i started watching it yesterday . 
  edit : i guess i got what was coming to me . 
  god im getting scared to go outside, 
  i 'm not arguing for or against the legacy of various groups . 
  the simple fact that you want them exterminated makes you a little bitchy piece of shit . 
  im leaving you at 69 points, 
  guy labled as intelligent by others * here : ditzy girls are kinda hot, 
  * statements do not reflect the opinion of op, 
  meant to reply to the comment above you . 
  kinda ironic in context, 
  how ? 
  thats like saying guys who like blondes are douches because they have an opinion . 
  dude , you are reading way too much into what i said . 
  stop white knighting . 
  how am i being insecure ? 
  i bet they could n't swim away though, 
  its more than that . 
  read it . 
  its a pretty good book, 
  *** nailed it ***, 
  saudi library ? 
  mine has tons of video games . 
  played dishonored and ac3 for free . 
  this is the thing i do n't understand about soccer in europe ( ignorant american ) . 
  why is it in europe someone can be arrested for making monkey noises at a black player or sending a racist tweet , while in the us , where we fought the worst war of our history over race relations , calling someone a `` stupid nigger '' etc. 
  only results in public shaming or something similar . 
  is n't what they do in europe an infringement of free speech ? 
  this happens in the us . 
  northerns think of southerners the same way . 
  i feel for you bro, 
  your username is n't helping your case, 
  both of our flatscreens came from costco and sam 's club . 
  it is actually a pretty good place to buy stuff like that . 
  its 2 am and i want a blt now ... 
  north carolina - pulled pork with coleslaw . 
  eastern or western style is up to you . 
  dude , how long has it been since you watched an arsenal match, 
   probably pretty solid advice for about 90 % of anything you read ~ ~ on the internet . ~ ~, 
  ftfy, 
  do n't forget the towns of middlesex , climax , toast , bat cave , and turkey , nc, 
  oh god my sister, 
  i was in badlands last summer . 
  in the visitors center they were working on some fossil ( i want to say a sabretooth tiger ? ), 
  an 8 year old girl has found walking around in the visitor center 's picnic area . 
  it was crazy . 
  got ta get that diamond pickaxe certification bro, 
  you should check out a hurricanes game if you are ever out this way . 
  `` redneck hockey '' is pretty wild . 
  you just ride everest over and over again . 
  few people know about the single riders line, 
  thats a great way to avoid crabs !, 
  dont forget the bonus points for marrying a super model, 
  viking here , can confirm vikingness, 
  run saban out of the sec, 
  well in fairness we snowed on them . 
  always finish strong, 
  i do n't think it would make much of a difference . 
  as an american and being the first in my family to really get into soccer , i have supported the us through the ups and downs of the last decade . 
  i would think someone like me , where soccer was like the fourth or fifth biggest sport in my family growing up , would have a much greater chance of defecting over someone who was born into a family where soccer was first and foremost . 
  the combination of crest username and apparent central american allegiance has me very confused about you . 
  is n't this considered their best stadium too ? 
  haha very cool . 
  what is the soccer culture like down there ?
