  go watch it . 
  right now . 
  he had open heart surgery the same day as my great grandfather , my mom likes to joke she 's seen him naked in person , and is buried about 100 feet from my grandfather . 
  he always seemed like a down to earth guy and it has felt like he is a long lost grandfather to me, 
  i 've been limited to dry lemons since those whores got into my grove, 
  i think he 's pretty good tbh, 
  american , egyptian or isis , i think we can all agree ... . fuck tottenham, 
  an inferior english soccer club from north london , known for selling gareth bale , perennially finishing below arsenal and managing to never play champions league football . 
  also , ironically , they are known for the large contingent of jewish fans they have, 
  nope i 'm born and bred american, 
  that 's what your mom said last night, 
  you mean when the words end on a kinda upward tone ? 
  you 're up early !, 
  making the sheep breakfast in bed ? 
  ups store guy here -, 
  all licensed retailers of alcohol are required to mark on boxes that the shipment contains alcohol . 
  ups is very anal about it because unregulated alcohol shipping quickly crosses the line to trafficking if a state prosecutor decides to get pissy . 
  computers and meat are n't regulated , so yeah it 's all good, 
  ups leaves it up to the driver 's discretion if signature delivery was not specifically purchased . 
  based on the schedule drivers keep , if it 's not paid for the driver will most likely leave the box on your porch, 
  that 's smart . 
  each ups store is an independent franchise , so your milage may vary , but for me if you packed the box yourself , it 's a do n't ask do n't tell policy . 
  do n't make it obvious and i wo n't really ask . 
  however if you flat out said something about alcohol i would have to turn you down . 
  lol . 
  clap stool . 
  german is so literal, 
  micro econ for the win, 
  i work in the mornings and have class in the afternoon . 
  so half happy right now, 
  when will the scourge of pennsylvania finally come to light in the public eye ? 
  when ? 
  when they canceled at 1030 this morning ... 
  felt like a kid on christmas, 
  that 's pretty smart actually . 
  most all ncsu majors need at least one calc , but cs is still fairly limited to specific focus areas, 
  bellerin is showing his age a bit, 
  what the fuck, 
  maybe he 's gay for the eyes, 
  it was a lucky deflection . 
  most of our problems are self created . 
  its fixable . 
  we got this, 
  this is his worst game in a while, 
  fuck this gay earth, 
  it 's like how someone 's old southern grandpa would say it, 
  i love playing pranks on my dog, 
  what the hell it looks black and blue here but white and gold in the actual pic, 
  atlanta does n't have the greatest rep either . 
  it took me a good while to grow back the leg hair that got burned off by one of their flares last year, 
  that 's surprising actually . 
  my understanding is terminus is the more moderate atl group . 
  i was in an altercation with the atl ultras , who i think are now banned because they lit ft. lauderdale strikers ' stadium on fire . 
  that 's pretty shitty of orlando then . 
  check out father and son antiques in downtown raleigh, 
  yeah , that 's pretty common knowledge in nc/sc . 
  do n't go to south of the border . 
  i think its a front for drugs or something, 
  ** edit : ** south of the border fun fact : former federal reserve chairman ben bernanke worked there on summer during his college years to help pay his way through harvard . 
  too easy, 
  well , jake long is gone, 
  actually , as the planet warms , areas that were largely non arable , such as siberia , are expected to support agriculture . 
  climate collapse is a very real issue , but we are going to have bigger problems than feeding ourselves . 
  i think they are just concerned . 
  and i appreciate that . 
  we have a really good relationship , it just adds a little extra stress on top of the planning . 
  should n't you be supporting fulham ? 
  \\ #coyg, 
  mildly off topic , but what type of work do you do , and what does your company look for in a new hire ? 
  i 'm expecting to graduate ncsu in 2016 in environmental science .
