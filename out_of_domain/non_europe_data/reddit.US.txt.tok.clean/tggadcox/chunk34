  if you compare the individual sponsorship though , adidas has messi and ozil while nike 's lineup includes ronaldo , neymar , zlatan , james i believe . 
  depending on where you are in nc it 's basically the middle east,

  kacee at arrow in cameron village has done a really nice job on mine the last two cuts i 've had, 
  whenever i hear partner i automatically assume that you are gay, 
  ah yes , because my commentary on the carolina railhawks is so much more relevant on / r/soccer than commenting as an arsenal supporter, 
  it does n't directly , but it gives a background and context on your comment . 
  i would estimate 99 % of / r/soccer knows fuck all about nasl soccer , but everyone knows at least generally what 's going on in the premier league, 
  i mean , i do n't give a shit who you have sex with . 
  it 's just an observation . 
  and fuck anyone who makes hiring choices based on gender or race or sexual orientation .

  dude , one of the biggest biotech firms in my area just cut 200 jobs while the only guy i know with a finance degree just got a cushy job with good pay and lots of vacation time . 
  coming from a stem senior , you are dae steming way too hard right now,

  i work ~ 20 hours a week , and while my gpa is n't fantastic i 'm more than passing and i 'm on track to graduate debt free . 
  if people want to do it , they will find a way . 
   / u/thepulloutmethod placed on commissioner 's exempt list, 
  probably a better analog for the soccer system is academies , where players are developed from a young age by clubs , and then promoted to the senior team , unlike the draft were they move from one college team to the nfl . 
  with soccer , it is all one organization . 
  the transfer window is more like free agency in the nfl , but guys do n't have to be free agents to move teams . 
  sometimes i ca n't understand what people are singing and it 's in english . 
  something about the crowd noise makes the words hard to pick out,

  brissette is very athletic , coming from an nc state student , and with a couple years in belichicks system could turn out pretty good . 
  all the physical tools are there, 
  boring boring arsenal, 
  team looks disjointed . 
  i worry for alexis and ozil 's futures with us . 
  my friends in iceland fed me so much of the stuff . 
  it really is an acquired taste though , by the end of the trip i kind of liked the milder stuff, 
  * eye twitch *,

  side note , do you have anyone with a background in soil science working for you ? 
  haha not yet . 
  i 'm actually environmental science , but have really enjoyed my soil science classes , and it annoys me when my friends say they are boring lol, 
  boooo i want my gold back,

  # ** fuck city fuck spurs **,

  hb-2 is a pro corporation bill in religious fundamentalist clothing .

  most people are used to barbecue smothered in sweet cloying sauce . 
  nc barbecue is a bit more subtle and spicy . 
  of course if you were out near charlotte getting eastern style , you are in the wrong part of the state . 
  if you were getting lexington style , your taste buds are broken . 
  haha , you must have had 5 or six different styles then . 
  barbecue is so localized here . 
  eastern tennessee is distinct from western nc , and sc is a whole other animal , and then i hear in georgia they use coffee in the sauce , but i 've never eaten georgia style . 
  it would feel so weird to see arsenal legend petr cech in a different club 's shirt, 
  where is kd, 
  i had my physics final that night, 
  its more of how politically vocal whu want to be . 
  here in nc i 'd say it 's probably 60/40 against to for in support of the law , but we have had bands like pearl jam and bruce springsteen cancel shows as a political statement, 
  random tangent , but my first non railhawks live soccer game was arsenal bournemouth, 
  they have a really cool little stadium from what i hear,

  the guy apperently had done time in georgia state prison for defrauding investors with his precious metals business , and his wife who was a state supreme court justice ended up resigning when her opponents dug up mr. berry jr 's history . 
  the guy was always chain smoking and wearing a ratty old steelers superbowl champion sweatshirt when he came in , and he owed my boss something like $ 1000 when he passed away last year . 
  rotation ?
