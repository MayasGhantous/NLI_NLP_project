  was that 7-9 bullshit ? 
  holy shit who knew throwing down field works jesus christ, 
  lol berman does n't know they got the to, 
  # ** mannion **, 
  where the fuck is the fucking goddamn qb spy get your head out of your ass williams, 
   i never watched the rams last year and now i know why . 
  so did everyone else , that 's why they moved, 
  is it bad that i 'm actively rooting against my own team so that no one shows up for games and kroenke is forced to blow the whole thing up ? 
  why should i support a team that obviously shows no initiative though ? 
  i can root for a team but disagree with how it 's run , and know what action needs to be taken . 
  fuck this team, 
  except we have no pick next year, 
  no wins till the whole organization is fired, 
  i want an empty coliseum, 
  do n't buy rams shit until everyone is out, 
  the nfl has changed . 
  fisher is a dinosaur . 
  we need new blood, 
  this . 
  team . 
  # ** fuck keenum fuck goff start mannion **, 
  t-minus 4 months in the mccrory administration, 
  our governor was the former mayor of charlotte , this all started as a big `` fuck you '' to his former city council and spiraled from there, 
  the belk bowl is an independently organized event , not an ncaa one, 
  dude it says right in your article it was established by raycom sports , not the ncaa, 
  i 'll be happy with a draw , but champions league arsenal * is * champions league arsenal , so who the hell knows, 
  but it 's not an ncaa event , which means they can not pull it out of nc . 
  if they revoked certification it would have to do with the game itself , or the organization that runs it , not the state it 's in . 
  the ncaa is in charge of booking scheduling and running events like the ncaa tournament or the fcs playoff . 
  for conference level events like the acc tournament in greensboro or bowl games the organization just certifies they are run up to standard . 
  lol what the fuck, 
  when the us gets pro/rel i 'll care , until then it 's a joke, 
  lol what a shit team, 
  that 's the achilles !, 
  that looked awkward, 
  good fucking save, 
  ayyyy lmao, 
  hnggggg, 
  giroud you dipshit, 
  kek, 
  2 yellow, 
  he definitely told him to go fuck himself at one point too lol, 
  having watched most of colombia 's games in copa america , ospina is absolutely fantastic in a tournament setting . 
  totally ok with this, 
  my element came from there !, 
  everything really is bigger in texas, 
  all that thhhhhing, 
  arsenal supporter from denver . 
  you have no idea, 
  pls, 
  well phil sims is still retarded, 
  ncsu confirmed best nfl qb producing school, 
  speaking of mcdonalds , why do the french love it so much ? 
  it 's always seemed like an odd combination to me, 
  i 'm american and i like european mcdonalds way more . 
  i think the last time i ate at one was in london in december, 
  i 'm not well versed in buli history but is n't union berlin considered the people 's club there ? 
  of course investors do n't care , but i wonder how that impacts local support, 
  thanks for helping out with mikel arteta back in the day, 
  contrary to wenger 's belief , alexis is n't a striker, 
  small club m8, 
  apology accepted, 
  * little menisci taste so good *, 
  lol i helped a buddy change a flat last night, 
  i like it, 
  i like it, 
  in case anyone is interested , chelsea is already down at leicester , and they have their ab team going, 
  chelsea down 2-0 now lol, 
  luuuucassssss, 
  xhaka broke both legs, 
  did anyone else just hear an explosion in the arsenal player stream ? 
  chelsea is off to extra time !, 
  brilliant squad selection from wenger today imo , i hope we can stay in next round to keep giving the youngsters some minutes, 
  playing coq against chelsea is asking for a red card . 
  we need someone strong and physical but level headed, 
  not just for the discipline record . 
  i think xhaka offers a comparable level of skill tracking back as coq while also not being prone to some stupid errors or fouls like how coq can get when hes frustrated . 
  we are probably going up against costa the master troll , and seeing how the game last year totally changed on a red card , i think he will be looking to get something similar this time around . 
  it also helps that xhaka has been hitting targets at distance better than lee harvey oswald of late , which gives us an extra element of attack, 
  edit : on mobile , ca n't format, 
  i suppose you could interchange with iwobi , i just like walcott 's experience over iwobi in this case . 
  iwobi first off the bench if things are going poorly though , for sure, 
  using that line of logic then , would n't you prefer a guy who has shown himself to be a goal scoring threat from midfield ? 
  we would be going into the game with essentially the same lineup as both defeats last season if we played coq , save maybe the upgrade from gabriel to mustafi . 
  i think the extra element xhaka brings that coq does not have would give us the advantage , otherwise you risk the same situation playing out, 
  lucas on the wing would be interesting as well , but tbh i 've not been overly impressed with giroud since the euros , and i do n't want alexis up top . 
  we will probably get alexis at striker and a double pivot of cazorla and coq though , with walcott and iwobi on the wings , but who knows . 
  can confirm , flipped between hamburg , dortmund , and league cup today , and watch arsenal pretty much every weekend, 
  i wish werder were n't so bad , i want to see johansson and gnabry link up well, 
  my nasl side beat la with landon donovan back in 2014 , it was odd to see him on our little practice field , as we had the field in our main 10,000 all seater resurfaced during the international break . 
  i think there was total maybe 500 people there ? 
  my high school football field had bigger bleachers, 
  yeah !, 
  it 's always the balkans ... 
  you probably went to high school with my cousin, 
  charlotte-us-wilmington carolina cup with charleston and richmond added in hngg, 
  i 've always favored sc . 
  raleigh sc , carolina sc . 
  sounds good to me, 
  conversely , with all the garbage nc has pulled of late , i would rather us identify with the city instead of the state .
