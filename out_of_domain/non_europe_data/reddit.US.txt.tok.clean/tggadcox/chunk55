  oh god why, 
  good no call imo,

  # ** fuck jeff fisher **, 
  # ** fuck jeff fisher **, 
  lol carolina at home ?

  sauce ? 
  alabama starting qb joey freshwater ? 
  the drink bit was useful, 
  webassign came out of my uni 's physics department in the 90s , which they have since spun off into its own thing . 
  the physics department here is shit , and webassign is shit, 
  based prophet, 
  sorry for yesterday :( my best friend is a bucs fan and he kept harassing me yesterday lol, 
  can confirm , is a twat, 
  my man, 
  alternatively , solo travel was one of the most meaningful experiences of my soon to be concluded college time . 
  sometimes travelling in a group insulates you from the full experience of where you are . 
  different strokes i suppose, 
  senior with one final left , a 100 level bio gen ed . 
  feels like the hardest thing in the world because i do n't care anymore, 
  haha what 's your major ? 
  i do n't have anything lined up yet , but i keep seeing things , so i 'm hopeful, 
  justification ? 
  he 's played in like 3 games and been sent on loan, 
  of all the people holding others back , coq is the last guy i would expect to do that, 
  unpopular opinion : ospina is better than cech, 
  oh i 'm not blaming cech for that , i just think ospina is able to compensate better for crappy marking . 
  he is a bit more acrobatic than cech , and i think his distribution is better, 
  should have taken an extra touch there ozil, 
  good wall, 
  walcott has been invisible today, 
  i think alexis wanted the ball, 
  so shit today, 
  fuck off everton, 
  when it gets cold enough here you better believe i wear my scarf, 
  orange is my favorite color , and i think these look great, 
  says the guy who 's team is named minnesota united . 
  i 'm just glad we are properly using a soccer naming convention . 
  the term `` united '' first originated in england when a new club was formed from the merger of two previous clubs . 
  man u for example was formed from newton heath fc and a merger with a new management team . 
  minnesota ( and atlanta and dc ) just randomly use the term because soccer . 
  same with rsl and houston to some extent . 
  i 'm all for eurocentric naming in american soccer , but it should be done properly so it does n't sound ridiculous . 
  i liked our previous look, 
  holy shit , i 've lived in nc for 19 years and i 've just connected bern to new bern, 
  hahahahahahahaha no . 
  if he 's a big ozil fan , you could sell him on the idea of learning from wenger/ozil , and essentially be the 10 in waiting . 
  he is only 23 , ozil is 28 . 
  by the time ozil is past his peak , draxler will be 26-27 , right in his prime . 
  i think he has issues with not being the main guy because he has been behind other players who , while good , are not at ozil levels of performance or skill . 
  madness obviously, 
  my thoughts exactly . 
  you do n't actively recruit other guys to come play with you if you have one foot out the door, 
  lol i hope he 's ok , that 's hilarious, 
  random question , but do you go to nc state ? 
  i see an element around campus with an orlando city bumper sticker on it , which is the only time i 've seen ocsc stuff in raleigh, 
  you only got ta pay 13-15 guys , 6 or seven of who are your most highly paid . 
  nhl teams have 23 guys on a roster, 
  do n't forget that they federal courts are forcing a special election in new non gerrymandered districts next year , so the repubs are trying to fuck as many people over in a year as possible, 
  like some guy said above , that sounds like the perfect code name for a super star destroyer, 
  i think that 's what they were going for . 
  pretty good role reversal , i thought . 
  really emphasizes the whole `` rebels are terrorists '' idea, 
  what are we , some kind of rogue one ? 
  yes, 
  in fairness , pk sounds absolutely ridiculous, 
  lol, 
  giroud for iwobi . 
  we miss cazorla , the midfield play had been dire today . 
  done his hamstring, 
  got ta get it here i think, 
  what the fuck xhaka wrong way, 
  leagues not done quite yet , but the mentality of this team is appalling . 
  it is absolutely unacceptable to try and sit on a one goal lead for 85 minutes . 
  we need a midfield playmaker other than cazorla , for two seasons now the title challenge has gone up in smoke with a cazorla injury . 
  i 'm in favor of getting draxler in january now , if that is really true . 
  after today 's performance would it be that big of a loss ? 
  hahaha the monkey guy was all my friends , who are n't really star wars people , could talk about, 
  exactly !, 
  the mon calamari cruisers are essentially converted cruise ships going up against cutting edge millitary tech . 
  they should get fucked up, 
  the jedha market battle setup had no music, 
  i said this in the everton thread and got downvoted to hell . 
  ospina 's distribution is better , and i think it shows in the fluidity the team plays with in cl games, 
  yeah but you do n't call touchdowns `` tds '' or three pointers `` three p-ts '' in normal conversation . 
  pk is just a vestigial part of early mls 's attempts to americanize soccer for the sake of being american . 
  like the overtime shootout and non plaural team nicknames , it will eventually die out . 
  when you 're writing it . 
  but if you call it a `` tee dee '' you sound ridiculous, 
  if it 's in durham you 're going to lose a lot of your potential college age audience from ncsu . 
  most students at state do n't venture up that way much, 
  this . 
  my unweighted gpa was about 2 tenths lower than most of my peers , but my sat was about 300 points higher ( old system ) , just graduated from a somewhat selective engineering school this weekend, 
  what a shot kid ? 
  my mom is from chicago and swears by aurelio 's, 
  i graduated last friday , turn 23 today , and am having a bunch of friends over for brunch on sunday . 
  too many events,
