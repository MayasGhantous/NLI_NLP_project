  i dont think he did, 
  i think you got your ronaldos mixed up bro, 
  courtois looks like he is going to be a beast, 
  say hi to sarah and bristol for me . 
  any story really, 
  check your american privilege there buddy . 
  you do n't know what its like to deal with other europeans . 
  ** so brave **, 
  i was happy to see you guys stay up . 
  i always like watching us play newcastle ( even the 4-4 draw a couple of years ago ), 
  good lord . 
  a couple years ago a tornado destroyed a home depot 15 miles from me and it rained insulation from the building on my house . 
  it was a devastating storm . 
  i ca n't imagine what its like there if you are finding stuff 100 miles away . 
  check the standings . 
  you just blew my mind, 
  do n't rip on the jags attendance over in / r/nfl , they will swiftly correct you, 
  yankees fan , arsenal fan . 
  wat do . 
  i got into english soccer following arsenal a few years ago . 
  never really had an mls team , but had planned on supporting carolina railhawks , my local club , whenever they move up to mls . 
  being a huge yankees fan , it is nice to get into mls sooner . 
  love the yankees . 
  love arsenal . 
  i can overlook mcfc . 
  god a seahawks fan too . 
  enjoy chris long repeatedly putting wilson in the dirt . 
  although the construction all over 54/hillsborough makes it a pain in the arse to get there, 
  i knew that was coming, 
  playoff hockey can get wild . 
  a few years ago my local team almost lit a few cars on fire in the parking lot . 
  redzone is like a beer bong of nfl . 
  its glorious . 
  i love me some durham bulls games, 
  yes , but doing it drunk is better, 
  usually i do the opposite , to be obnoxious, 
  already did that , kind of . 
  its not a dedicated gaming rig , but was bought with gaming in mind . 
  some schools use gmail , so the . edu address will always be there if its used, 
  what is the job situation like for es majors ? 
  maybe it is just mine then . 
  we get to keep ours as long as we still use them, 
   mythsmashers of food, 
  ftfy, 
  ahhh summers at my grandparents ' house , with the beer fridge stocked with several cases of yuengling . 
  good times . 
  got me into beer too . 
  never in a million years would i have guessed i would be trying to chill to a video of a guy in an nfl hat discussing the reproductive organs of hobbits and their possible reincarnation . 
  they know . 
  north carolina here . 
  low 70s this weekend , 90 by friday . 
  such is life . 
  noooooooo, 
  is this possible even for a teenager ? 
  i 've always heard that teenagers need to get the most sleep possible . 
  i 'm about to hit 20 , i 've noticed the same problem as thread op . 
  good luck man !, 
  you should check out north carolina some time !, 
  we are an amazing state , and our unemployment is lower then most of the country , for the future anyway . 
  or being a teenage male ? 
  choo choo motherfucker, 
  ftfy . 
  i 'll be your friend !, 
  all of you in this thread !, 
  in high school , this kid i knew would wear at least one article of orange clothing every day . 
  he said he would do that until the buffalo bills won the super bowl ( idk the relationship between the bills and orange , but what ever ) . 
  we ended up calling him `` cheetoh '' freshman year , and it stuck . 
  he goes to my university now and i ca n't for the love of god remember his real name . 
  carolina-railhawks please !, 
  you are like the cow version of / u/unidan, 
  we drew a little over 6k for a game against san antonio a couple of weeks ago . 
  the galaxy game this week sold out . 
  attendance record at like 9.8 k or so . 
  great attendance . 
  and right now , the road situation around the stadium is total shite , but people still come out . 
  i think it has a lot to do with the area . 
  you can get some upper level hurricanes hockey tickets for less than railhawks tickets , but people still show up in cary . 
  there is just a huge demand for it here . 
  it started being popular at nc state and unc and just expanded from there . 
  i think the hawks can be an mls side one day . 
  ol\u00e9, 
  railhawks and galaxy too . 
  love sticking it to arena, 
  are you english ? 
  in that case , carry on about the humidity, 
  take care of your shit first , then follow your dreams . 
  work and dreams do not always have to be intertwined . 
  incredibly boring . 
  way too much red on the home jersey , no more storm flags . 
  the whole thing just is `` meh . '', 
  just incredibly boring . 
  my 16 year old neighbor named tyler deals heroin and lsd . 
  you just described my ex to a t. 
  add chaz, 
  then you already know the spoiler, 
  ** thank god i can go shit now **, 
  huh . 
  i live in apex . 
  til . 
  really need to get up to asheville more .
