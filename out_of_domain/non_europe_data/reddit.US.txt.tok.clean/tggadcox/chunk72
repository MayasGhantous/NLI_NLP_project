  what a fucking barn burner . 
  i need a beer, 
  i like reddit because i can watch a game while at work , go out with friends the same night , come home and read the post match thread , which ends up letting me learn about a random dude in munich 's favorite baked goods, 
  i disturbed my neighbors in my office building, 
  psych , that 's the wrong number, 
  when he handled that ball and took the shot off the volley , it was such a good couple of touches . 
  i 've never seen a big guy with that amount of ball control, 
  spotify student discount, 
  this sounds shady enough to be plausible, 
  true , height wise ibra is bigger . 
  but kola is such a bulky guy, 
  brb conducting shirt stretching tests, 
  there was some guy yesterday posting a message from his whatsapp group claiming there was a link between a port project in guangzhou and his company , does make you wonder, 
  aaaaaand you 're part of the problem . 
  as soon as americans realize we are all on the same team no matter what political ideology , race , economic status , or religion you belong to , we are all on the same team . 
  dude i 'm as liberal as they come but you are part of the reason the far right accuses the left of being special snowflakes . 
  to say that all confederate soldiers are black hating racists is the same as saying all iraqis today are terrorists . 
  yeah you 've got a lot of shitty people on both sides , but the majority of your day to day foot soldiers were guys that got conscripted into fighting a war men with a lot more money , education , and influence than them wanted to fight . 
  to not acknowledge anything else is just contributing to the problems we are dealing with as a country . 
  i 'm an american , i do n't believe in fighting each other . 
  a house divided can not stand and when you make blanket statements calling people to form tribes you are undermining everything this country is built on, 
  the far left is as equally full of shitheads as the far right . 
  the more centrist this country becomes , the more positive the prognosis is for our long term health as a nation, 
  a sincerely legitimate question - why ca n't white people have a white lives matter rally in the same vein as a black lives matter rally ? 
  i think the riot in charlottesville was a poorly disguised neo nazi rally , but why ca n't white people protest black on white hate crimes , or killings of white people by police ( which per the washington post shows that there has been about 110 more deaths of white people than black at the hands of police in 2017 ) . 
  i suppose it 's just difficult for me to understand , as my family fought the british in the revolution , fought for the union in the civil war , and never owned slaves . 
  how are the actions of a subset of the population that adheres to a reprehensible ideology that also shares my skin color make me personally responsible ? 
  i 'm sincerely interested in your thoughts , because it is something i have struggled to understand . 
  so what 's your end game then ? 
  round them up in camps instead ? 
  i 'd say that 's fair enough , as long as they are preserved in a strictly educational sense . 
  i just think it 's a dangerously slippery slope to advocate the eradication of any subset of individuals, 
  so , as i 've asked others in this thread , what 's your end game here ? 
  what would you like to ideally see be done to fix this problem ? 
  well that would be tricky to execute within the confines of the 1st amendment . 
  sure , private enterprises can not deal with anyone who embraces nazi ideology , but you ca n't just outright ban an ideology without undermining the constitution, 
  [ that 's false unfortunately ] ( http://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2017/08/14/there-hate-speech-exception-first-amendment/q9m4iqfqvbo24nnlnpor1o/story.html ), 
  did you read the article ? 
  the supreme court literally ruled in favor of the national socialist party of america , that they could continue their hate speech, 
  good . 
  the statue may represent abhorrent ideas but state property is state property and the law is the law . 
  angry mobs should not be allowed to just go around destroying things at will . 
  like it or not , the law is the law , and we all have to respect that . 
  and separate but equal was overturned by a long history of nonviolent protest and civil disobedience , not rioting and destruction of public property . 
  there are good laws , there are bad laws , but if you want your movement to have any legitimacy , you can not violently destroy things as your main method of protest . 
  no , i think they went about civil disobedience the right way . 
  they were successful because they sent a message in the correct , rational way . 
  tearing down a statue is not the same as sitting at a whites only lunch counter, 
  [ the confederacy enacted the first military conscription law in the history of the united states ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/confederate_states_army#control_and_conscription ) at the very beginning of the war . 
  further more , they enacted the [ twenty negro law ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/twenty_negro_law ) which actually * exempted * slave owners from fighting in the war . 
  the vast majority of csa foot soldiers were either conscripted forcefully or coerced into volunteering because they were going to be conscripted anyways . 
  they way i see it , claiming all confederate soldiers were traitors is the same as spitting on the average vietnam vet who just got home from saigon . 
  blame davis , and lee , and stonewall jackson , but do n't put the fault of a few rich slave owning assholes on the shoulders of a lot of poor uneducated farm boys who were doing what they thought they had to do . 
  the way i see it , if a law is not directly hurting someone ( the way slavery was hurting slaves ) then it is just and should not be broken . 
  if the law is unjust and negatively impacts or impedes an individual 's pursuit of life , liberty , and happiness ( which is property in the strictly jeffersonian sense ) than it should not be followed . 
  anti vandalism laws are in place to protect private and public property , and just because that property is seen as an object of hatred does not mean anyone has the right to destroy it . 
  [ second paragraph down ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/african-american_civil_rights_movement_ ( 1954 % e2 % 80 % 931968 ), 
  '' [ a ] cts of nonviolent protest and civil disobedience produced crisis situations and productive dialogues between activists and government authorities . '', 
  i agree that the movement was n't entirely homogeneous , but to discount the major role nonviolent protest played in the movement is entirely ignorant on your part . 
  all of the major protest events associated with the civil rights movement and especially dr. king were nonviolent events , whereas riots did not play a large role in any of the changes that occurred . 
  please explain to me how a statue has negatively impacted you . 
  not your family , culture , ancestors , but you personally ? 
  has that statue kept you from getting an education ? 
  has that statue kept you from getting a job ? 
  has that statue stopped you from voting , buying a car , house or computer ? 
  the constitution only protects against the physical infringement of your rights , not against your feelings . 
  dude you just totally missed what i said . 
  the constitution only protects against the ** physical ** violation of your rights . 
  not the emotional . 
  yeah , the statue had a hell of a lot of charged emotional connotation around it , but that does n't give you or anyone else the right to tear it down . 
  and you 're right , these particular events have not personally hurt me . 
  but my ancestors got kicked out of europe for their religious beliefs and came to this country , where they fought with native americans . 
  later on these same ancestors intermarried with the same native americans , who got forcefully removed from their lands so they could be occupied by white people . 
  even later than that my ancestors fought the bloodiest fucking war in american history against the same guys these monuments are honoring . 
  the point is life is n't fair , but just because my grandfathers and grandmothers got fucked over by the english , americans , and confederates does n't mean my feelings are hurt and i 'm entitled to go tear down statues of andrew jackson or the church of england or confederate dead . 
  i was n't deported from my homeland or sent to a reservation or shot by a southerner . 
  yeah , it sucks my family went through that , ** but it 's the past ** . 
  what happened in charlottesville is the present , and if you want to go protest that , go ahead with my full support . 
  i think that 's the right thing to do . 
  but you are not entitled to destroy other entity 's property because it represents something that happened 150 years ago . 
  be the change you want to see , but do it the right way . 
  thank you . 
  so many emotional arguments surrounding this , it 's nice to see someone rational . 
  sitting at a lunch counter is a victimless crime , while tearing down a statue is the destruction of real property, 
  eh , i 'd argue that there is reasonable expectation from the original owner of the flyer that they are temporary , so under that definition it would n't be the same as a permanent monument . 
  i suppose that 's my viewpoint on all of this . 
  personally i do n't think there 's anything wrong with the statue , but at the same time i 'm not opposed to removing it . 
  i would rather it be in a museum than destroyed , of course . 
  i also think the individuals involved in the event should face the consequences of their actions . 
  are you a cop, 
  we are getting a drafthouse in raleigh , i 'm definitely in now,
