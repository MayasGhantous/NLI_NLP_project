  i kinda got scared off when some hobo tried to mug me in the biltmore mcdonalds bathroom a few years ago . 
  i do n't know why , but i just imagined you typing away on reddit from a macbook while you sit in your thatched hut wearing a loin cloth , the day 's kill roasting on the open fire outside . 
  forage on , bro !, 
  coming soon to a 3d printer near you, 
  i do n't think someone who would actually wear one of the masks in public would really care how it feels . 
  he had to go grab that guys dr. pepper 10 out of the river, 
  if you want the story to make sense get at least 2 if not 1, 
  i can see where you are coming from , but to me the bad just way outweighs the good . 
  personally , it was weird enough that the kinect was required hardware ( i mean come on , a sensor device that can literally detect your heartbeat in a common area of your home is straight out of 1984 ) but with all of the drm and restrictions on used gaming , it really has alienated a lot of people . 
  i think what people do n't like about the change is that the current gen consoles and the general market surrounding them was a successful model . 
  microsoft could make an improved version of the 360 and basically be printing money . 
  instead , to a lot of people , it feels like the changes that are planned are made in mind to screw over consumers , and that has pissed a lot of people off . 
  bring it uncle sam . 
  res tagged . 
  my dad , uncle , and grandpa were at that game !, 
  small world, 
  torry holt is great . 
  does stuff at nc state all the time, 
  ohhhh yeahhhh cunts !, 
  now i remember why i have you tagged `` takes / r/gaming way too seriously '', 
  apex here . 
  race you . 
  may the best karma whore win . 
  the culture is more or less the same though . 
  its like an 8 hour drive ( i might be wrong ) from london to germany , and look how many different nations and cultures you go through . 
  in america , we drive 8 hours and there can be a lot of the same regional customs and culture . 
  now weather wise , yes , getting traded from the miami dolphins to the buffalo, 
  bills would suck , but its not like an english player getting shipped to some eastern european team culture wise . 
  i actually had to explain to my dad a few times how the transfer system works . 
  he was weirded out by it because he is so used to the american trade system . 
  without giving too much detail up , does he happen to work for a company in the park , or used to ? 
  my dad met a guy over wow and ended up getting him a job down here , and he had to move , and him and his wife just had a baby about a year and a half ago . 
  you may be the first couple born out of total procrastination . 
  considering what ps3 started at , quite reasonable, 
  holy fuck yes, 
  can anyone link to the preview ? 
  i missed it on the livestream . 
  edit : [ here it is !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jw9bhqxb9c8 ), 
  they got the exclusive license and the whole series went to shit . 
  gander mountain ? 
  sitting in the stands at wakemed . 
  post game edit : ** awwwwww yeahhhhhh **, 
  that referee tried to hand chivas the game on a silver platter . 
  no sympathy . 
  had a lesbian friend who worked there . 
  she was treated like shit . 
  i bet you are really good at making characters in skyrim . 
  i can be temporarily gay for italian food, 
  eh , that 's what you would think . 
  really it 's the lobbies for healthcare and private insurance that run the show . 
  just like everything else in this country . 
  should n't you be playing cod ? 
  you and me are almost identical . 
  about 20 minutes from the railhawks , but my first love is arsenal . 
  i get shit on here all the time , being an amercan who loves a london club , but there just are n't that many options for me . 
  i support the railhawks now pretty strongly , but i try to watch every arsenal game i can . 
  i think a lot of europeans at least have trouble grasping the sheer geographical distances between a lot of fans and some teams , so they do n't really get the idea of a long distance supporter . 
  side note , if you go see the railhawks sit in 309 . 
  was in the stands wednesday night for the chivas game . 
  it was mad . 
  hmmm . 
  i 'm arsenal/go to nc state . 
  a person with allegiances like yours should not be so reasonable lol . 
  i am in nc , but i grew up a st. louis rams fan , which i got from my dad because he stared liking them because they were on tv a lot in the 70 's where he grew up in tennessee ( side note , he bleeds tennessee orange ) but the whole `` long distance '' thing never really bothered me . 
  ironically , the main reason i started supporting arsenal was the fact the kronke had a controlling stake in the team and just recently purchased the rams , so i thought it was a good fit . 
  sweet . 
  if you have any questions about ncsu , feel free to pm me haha . 
  it is a pretty cool school . 
  that would be an ironic twist . 
  panther creek ? 
  one time , i responded to `` european '' with `` europe '' and did n't win the round . 
  do n't worry buddy , if my classes are an accurate reflection , there are plenty more cute catepillar experts out there . 
  i miss hannaford :(, 
  communism . 
  not even joking . 
  i 'll post a picture of the batting, 
  cages later , they have the old turf from three rivers . 
  also , no cameras were allowed in the clubhouse , but i can confirm among other things there were a chewbacca costume , a live pufferfish , and multiple game, 
  used pittsbugh penguins items . 
  ** edit **, 
  the view from the pressbox, 
  the batting cage pics wont load . 
  go to milwaukee . 
  i was there last summer , ate four brats, 
  i 'm more of a miller park bratwurst guy myself . 
  get swimming pool seats and do an ama, 
  that was on the list to do , but there is a stinking kenny chesney concert sunday , so no tours all week ... 
   out of my depth, 
  yay pizza for everyone !, 
  except celiacs ... ^ ^ ^ sorry, 
  geez . 
  i thought that the whole gluten thing was the latest fad diet type thing that had grown out of a health issue a tiny part of the population had . 
  i had no idea that is what celiac did . 
  lydia was too effective for me . 
  as i went to finish a bandit , she killed him from behind and he fell dead out of the way , and i accidentally killed her . 
  i 'm so sorry, 
  terrible quality , the stream keeps cutting out , and the broadcast just gave us an instant replay of an empty net . 
  ** this is awesome **, 
  mmmm pizza,
