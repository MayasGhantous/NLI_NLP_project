the new youtube layout is very clean , i really enjoy it , contrary to popular opinion . 
  i find the subscriptions feed showing uploads only ( http://www.youtube.com/feed/subscriptions/u ) the most useful thing ever , especially the bar to the left . 
  however , the feature where you could see other videos by the channel being removed was a step back , in my opinion this is the only step back . 
  i would love to have that feature back , or something similar . 
  thank you for doing this ama . 
  you are an awesome father . 
  props to you, 
  today i got by fine with a peacoat and sweater underneath , but the weather is very bi-polar day to day as already stated . 
  thank you for explaining it , i do n't think i would have understood it completely beforehand . 
  just finished about 30 levels after i read this post , thanks y' all now i 'm hooked on to it,

  they do not wear down at all and i never get blisters . 
  kanye was much better before my beautiful dark twisted fantasy , after that he just fell off . 
  prior to this , he rapped about social issues but now his music is just boastful . 
  i enjoy listening to it , just not as much as his older stuff . 
  usually what i have heard and found true by experience is that however long you have taken off is about equal to how long of consistent running it takes to get back to your previous level of fitness . 
  you may be able to get a pair of twenty twelves for the low now , i absolutely love my pair but it may depend upon where you live . 
  thank you for your service,

  i do not know of any wal-marts in washington d.c. , just the suburbs .

  french bulldogs !, 
  so cute, 
  most posts i see from that subreddit are the former . 
  i prefer zippers , but do n't mind button fly . 
  easier access , nahmean ? 
  1901 buttons ups are great , and at a decent price point for the quality . 
  purple pigeons have always been my favorite , great shot . 
  less break may look better depending on opinion , but as already suggested cuffing, 
  luminox watches are very nice , but i 'm not a big fan of this particular watch . 
  this one looks like a sports watch . 
  times weekender is great if you 're not committed to watches . 
  reliable and very versatile as you can switch the strap out easily . 
  i 'm not a fan of it . 
  looks too blue-collar for me, 
  rick owens has been making men 's skirts and dresses for quite awhile . 
  i like how kanye west pulls it off , but i do n't think i can . 
  i think shorts over meggins/waxed denim can look sick as well , but only `` street-goth `` ish . 
  i do n't think the trend will be here to stay , however . 
  anybody else notice how when they escaped woodbury it was quite dark out and when they came to the cars it looked like 9am-ish ? 
  no , no !, 
  when they got to the road with the cars, 
  if i recall correctly michonne said approximately one mile, 
  moncler has made quite a few blazer-jacket hybrids iirc . 
  i can only find one online , however.they are a bit pricey and more of an early fall jacket , and there 's only one size on nordstrom .

  anybody else notice how this was the first episode that anybody missed a shot ? 
  correct me if i 'm wrong, 
  what do you think the blowing up of `` harlem shake '' will do for trap music ? 
  shit will get mad real when you mix harlem shake, 
  oatmeal , buck , and classic . 
  personally i am not a fan of sahara, 
  as long as it fits well ( the most important aspect ) and a decent material i do n't see a problem in buying at a price point, 
  anyone get the power corruption lies print ? 
  is it as loud as it appears to be online ? 
  any tips for trying to meet artists before/after the show ( possibly ) backstage ?

  the cheapest on ebay is $ 1,800 : s makes me sad , they look pretty cool, 
  bling tee probably instantly . 
  hopefully they have a restocks on most items like last season . 
  damn i love flatbush zombies on this track, 
  out of those two , get the green . 
  navy is n't the best choice if you plan to wear jeans with them . 
  but better yet , get a brown pair . 
  scrap the shoes & undershirt , shorten the cuff , and wear a different watch ( from the picture if looks digital ), 
  looks a tad big on you, 
  pink is a little too wide in the shoulders and fits better than the blue, 
  pink fits your better , but is n't optimal, 
  i feel like they have sold out . 
  hear me out ; last spring summer i felt as if ( especially ) the t-shirts restocked several times and did n't sell out as fast . 
  might just be my imagination , but i do n't know . 
  he 's wearing a t shirt . . !, 
  i see nast and ferg , where 's yams ? 
  do n't get a 3 button suit unless you 're like 6 `` 2 ' or taller , otherwise i do n't think it looks too great,

  iirc past levi 's collaborations ( leopard interior ) jackets were approximately $ 200, 
  incredible fades, 
  do n't stretch them without wearing them , i think you will end up regretting it . 
  if you are in a rush to stretch them out , go biking or sleep in them . 
  sleeping in raw denim stretches it out and i honestly barely notice it . 
  yeah . 
  not appropriate unless you are working out/being active . 
  not sure if you have seen this guide , i have n't gone too much in depth into it but is very well put together and worth the read .

  `` when you discover what works for you , you 'll see that striving to look your best is n't work at all . 
  it should come naturally . '', 
  wear whatever you are comfortable with , nobody is forcing you to wear anything or to not wear anything . 
  dressing nicely is n't pretentious at all . 
  [ r/teenmfa ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/teenmfa ) may be worth checking out for you, 
  i ca n't think of any pair off of the top of my head but it would probably be worth it for you to invest in orthotics . 
  i 'm kind of digging longer t shirts ( see : street goth ) and drop crotch sweatpants . 
  i do not think either look would work for me but i think it looks so dope when pulled off correctly . 
  they 're * not * coming near me :( . 
  disappointed .
