  nothing is going to be out of the ordinary or completely reinventing clothing as we know it . 
  he is just getting his feet wet in the fashion industry after being marginalized and frustrated as a result . 
  he is a really creative guy musically , i was disappointed myself with this collection . 
  this is kanye 's recent wardrobe reconstructed by apc . 
  i 'm expecting more risks in the future . 
  this solid collection is more elaborate than his first with apc ( regardless if you think it 's a copy or not ) , so it could be his ticket to bigger things . 
  people still do n't fully trust his experience and expertise in fashion , so he has to establish credibility first . 
  hopefully his collection with adidas is way different . 
  i highly doubt jean touitou ( and the apc label ) would let kanye designing some crazy stuff under his brand . 
  that 's not what apc is about , they 're known for creating great quality clothing with mid tier designer pricing , not reinventing the wheel . 
  if it were a full kanye west collection , i 'm sure things would be different . 
  i actually like the pieces and you can expect them to be well made with nice materials , but for someone who is banging on the fashion doors like a lunatic saying he 's got some original ideas ... i 'm not seeing many ( at least with this apc collection ) . 
  this is nothing new in recent drops from designers but it 's the refining of products that are already great . 
  long story short : construction , quality , & image/brand . 
  all apply to most `` high priced '' ( this is relative ) garments . 
  both are a pass . 
  for starters , i do n't think this jacket would last long ( re : quality ) . 
  bombers/varsity jackets are big as of lately and to me it 's a little played out . 
  i 'm a little prejudice towards these things for either being cliche or irrelevant . 
  but hey , if you like it who are we to tell you what to wear and what not to wear ? 
  pants fit a little awkward , may not be the right cut for your body type . 
  everything looks good , but it looks like the clothes are wearing you and not the other way around . 
  you do n't look very comfortable . 
  nice individual pieces , just do n't come together well . 
  they look like all belong in a different outfit . 
  shirt fits a tad small . 
  other than that looks great . 
  the denim becomes exponentially more comfortable after each wear !, 
  for the fadezz bro . 
  great write up !, 
  here 's a full pdf copy of the preppy handbook for anyone interested in reading/taking a look [ link , large file ] ( http://vk.com/doc-39101853_115847580?dl=23d0027ca665eb9fd6 ), 
  i am itching for [ this apc x kanye fur lined parka ] ( http://www.upscalehype.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/apc-kanye-west-collection-paris-fashon-week-2.jpg ) . 
  not sure if i can fit this item into my wardrobe or even afford it , i just want it . 
  [ brooks brothers ] ( http://www.brooksbrothers.com/slim-fit-chinos/mr00292,default,pd.html?dwvar_mr00292_color=brbl&amp;contentpos=24&amp;cgid=0220 ), 
  of course . 
  it looks like this [ ermanno scervino fur lined jacket ] ( http://www.upscalehype.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/kanye-west-wearing-ermanno-scervino-army-green-fur-lined-jacket-fear-of-god-la-flannel-shirt-and-patta-x-kangaroos-woodhollow-heritage-hiking-sneaker-boots2.jpg ) he wore . 
  but toned down and not with a price tag of $ 3,500 . 
  a crotch blowout is caused by denim that fits too tight , wearing them too low , or cycling/running in them . 
  it can be prevented by washing the denim occasionally , or reinforcing the crotch area . 
  a message that has been reinterpreted into an anthem for drinking . 
  you 're on ktt ? 
  bizzare, 
  hopefully i 'm not late to the party, 
  oak nyc, 
  acne studios, 
  nike, 
  thanks . 
  the tee length is ~ 34 in ( i 'm 6 ' 2.5 '' ) and oversized is something i 've been trying to experiment ( tech/street goth whatever falls near that category ) . 
  thanks for the constructive advice, 
  yes, 
  my shirt from oak fits pretty standard except the length and an extra 1-2 inches in the chest than i 'd normally wear . 
  you can check out [ oak nyc 's collection ] ( http://www.oaknyc.com/men/oak-collection/tees.html ) of tees to find something to your liking , or sit patient until they restock . 
  they are seriously high quality , well worth the money . 
  nike did me dirty again ... 
  kanye tore up baltimore . 
  can confirm it was an awesome show . 
  easy to pass on . 
  actual ukrainian here , living in america . 
  there are riots in smaller cities and towns , none nearly as violent but are n't covered on media like kyiv or lviv ( ua 's most western major city , both geographically and politically ) . 
  the west of ukraine is overwhelmingly anti-russia , and it is pretty evident . 
  in this part of the country the local governments were taken over quite quickly . 
  many people in the east are pro russia , as you probably can assume riots there are n't as widespread . 
  people oppose yanukovych there but not as vehemently as in central or western ukraine . 
  this is a russian stronghold , and it 's not going to change . 
  some people are against yanukovych but pro russia . 
  central ukraine is where all the riots are erupting . 
  the ukrainian people do n't want to walk down the path of russia anymore ... we have clearly had enough . 
  several hundreds of years of occupation and marginalization have to come to an end . 
  at first the protests were about not signing an eu deal , then to violent protests to evict yanukovych and his government and to demand a fair & free election . 
  the riots now are about a regime change , we need to change shit . 
  we demand freedom from corrupt officials . 
  my dear friend of 20 years went to kyiv in december before orthodox christmas to visit family . 
  he went to protest on the maidan . 
  i have n't heard from him since , i hope he is ok . 
  i wish to hear from him soon . 
  ukraine forward !, 
  glory ukraine !, 
  \u0412\u0438\u0431\u0430\u0447\u0442\u0435 , i was exhausted last night . 
  this is not the case . 
  i would say myself most people are opposed to yanukovych . 
  just looking for offers right now . 
  i could pass it as ds , but it 's been worn in my house for 3 or so minutes . 
  not really looking for trades other than field pullover f/w '12 in ( i think i need size l ) i add of course . 
  that 's the only thing i 'm particularly interested in , but open to other offers in my favor . 
  thanks for looking !, 
  edit : a handful of people have offered me $ 90 , i do n't know what the demand is exactly for these but i am in no particular rush to sell . 
  bin is $ 150 shipped . 
  if you think this is unfair let me know . 
  thank you for the offer , but i can not accept this . 
  the answer to any `` which boot '' question : get fitted for them . 
  you are looking for a 3-piece boot , i 've never heard of soft shell . 
  riot parka , playboy jersey , and pit bull keychain ( most heat item of the season tbh ) . 
  black riot & white playboy !, 
  putin and putin 's actions do n't have widespread support across russia . 
   implying russia 's elections are free and fair, 
  russian elections are all a fa\u00e7ade . 
  they are not transparent at all . 
  state controlled media . 
  requiring a 7 % threshold ( raised from 5 % in 2007 ) for a party to win a single seat in duma ( lower house of legislature ) . 
  unusually high voter turnout .
