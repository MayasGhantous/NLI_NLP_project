  without voting fraud , putin probably would not have enough votes for a super majority and thus requiring a second round election . 
  rt is even worse than fox news !, 
  thank you !, 
  as a ukrainian expat , it always has bothered me when people say this . 
  this verse is n't terrible , but i still think sean is only good for hooks and choruses . 
  kinda feel bad for him . 
  where is that track you worked on with kanye ? 
  how is the atmosphere in some of these places ? 
  any appropriate for around college aged kids ? 
  cheap flimsy toilet paper . 
  never again . 
  wether you speak russian or ukrainian in ukraine is not indicative of anything . 
  ukraine has been under russian imperialist rule for centuries . 
  people were forced to speak russian . 
  most people in the country speak russian . 
  i just want to see mourinho vs. 
  pep and ibrahimovi\u0107 vs. ronaldo, 
  the pp annual calendar is the watch of my dreams, 
  i would love to have either !, 
  if i balled hard enough to afford a patek or a lange sohne ( or it was a life or death choice ) patek would have a slight edge to me . 
  patek 's mastered combination case working , movement , and dial , and hand finishing . 
  patek remaining independent and the stern family ownership is unique in the watch making world . 
  i do n't think you could go wrong with either however !, 
  never see me again, 
  besides bayern-united ( lol ) , these draws are very even . 
  should be a thrilling set of games . 
  surprised fifa would do this . 
  they are a non-political organization . 
  people called for sanctions against russia , including not being in the fifa 2014 world cup . 
  we know that 's not going to happen . 
  vivaldi and chopin are my favorite composers . 
  no pieces in particular that stand out from both of them , just enjoy [ most of ! ], 
  their music . 
  i made an updated version of the map . 
  additionally , venezuela and serbia have recognized it . 
  when you brought out jay-z at coachella it was insane to think about how much history you two have between each other . 
  definitely my top coachella moment . 
  thanks for the great music , illmatic is one of my top albums of all time . 
  field pullover f/w '12, 
  pay to get the written packet back for $ 10 . 
  we want to see it . 
  beautiful watch and in my opinion one of the most functional rolex watches . 
  i 'm hoping to get a coke bezel later this year !, 
  there 's a pepsi dial and also a black and red one that is dubbed coke . 
  sad to see him go , but in jos\u00e9 we trust !, 
  poroshenko is really the best choice for ukraine . 
  he can balance diplomatic ties with the west/eu and russia very well . 
  ukraine 's public opinion on nato membership is low . 
  [ poll from 2002-09 ] ( http://razumkov.org.ua/eng/poll.php?poll_id=46 ) and [ poll from 2014 ] ( https://twitter.com/uacrisis/status/466538189058895872 ) . 
  ukraine applied for nato membership in 2008 . 
  it was put on hold under yanukovych . 
  the interim government under yatsenyuk has no intentions of ukraine joining nato . 
  i think it is pretty clear ukraine is headed towards european union integration . 
  ukraine has always been an integral yet difficult state to the eu . 
  yanukovych was pro-eu at the start of his presidency . 
  yanukovych was thrown out of office for not signing the [ association agreement ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ukraine%e2%80%93european_union_association_agreement ) in november 2013 . 
  yatsenyuk and poroshenko both have the intentions of joining the eu . 
  the eu condemned russia annexing crimea and placed sanctions on top russians . 
  ukraine was granted a loan of $ 1 billion to mend her shattered economy . 
  it is in eu 's best interest to get ukraine under eu sooner-than-later . 
  ukraine 's economy has grown at the slowest rate out of all the post communist countries . 
  `` ukrainian success will be one of the most powerful answers to russian aggression , '' david cameron ( 2014 ) . 
  i hope i presented this as objectively as possible, 
  ** tl ; dr ** in short nato : probably not , eu : yes . 
  on the grounds of what , immigration ? 
  would you be willing to sell one in particular ? 
  it looks just like one my father wore . 
  nato is not popular among ukrainian people . 
  ukraine wont be joining in the short-term or even long-term . 
  however , eu membership is a promising prospect . 
  there is economic success to be had in the eu despite the rise of euroscepticsm ( which will wash over when recovered from global recession ) . 
  it is evident in [ this graph ] ( http://www.reinisfischer.com/sites/default/files/ukrainevspolandgdp.png ) which shows the gdp of poland and ukraine . 
  following poland 's accession in 2004 , their gdp increased at a higher rate . 
  the eu is willing to work with western balkan countries to increase stability and economy for membership , the same is true for ukraine . 
  [ this statement ] ( http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/en/ec/142786.pdf ) was made on behalf of the eu by van rompuy and barroso . 
  how much did he do for the club ? 
  it seems american owners treat clubs more of an asset , versus sheikhs and oligarchs who dump seemingly endless amounts of money expecting little financial return . 
  i would like to thank you for helping me ** not ** fail ap world !, 
  thanks !, 
  6 seconds a day is n't bad , for a seiko mechanical that is damn good . 
  it may lose less time per day as it settles down . 
  for arabic to english translations there are n't always 1:1 translations, 
  enlighten me . 
  credit being too available is a dangerous . 
  the college education bubble will burst eventually . 
  haha , a family friend who knows i 'm into watches got me this , but it is far to big for my taste . 
  fifa is all about fixing matches . 
  fifa wo n't cash out if brazil does n't win . 
  all of football is corrupt , fifa allows cheating by bigger name teams to be swept under the door . 
  unbelieveable . 
  just like how ukraine was absolutely jipped of a spot in the world cup , fifa wo n't make money if france is n't in the cup , even if they lack cohesion . 
  i do applaud them for instituting goal line technology , even if the would be goal call was absolute bullshit tonight . 
  if neymar wins the golden boot , i will lose all respect for fifa . 
  i think he is a phenomenal player . 
  if his golden boot is earned by illegitimate goals such as the penalty , then he does not deserve it . 
  point taken, 
  i could n't see \u010cech playing second fiddle to courtois though . 
  it 'd be a shame to see him go but it 'd be for the best . 
  the eu is n't for babysitting countries . 
  ukraine 's economy wo n't be fixed overnight , with or without help of russia/eu .
