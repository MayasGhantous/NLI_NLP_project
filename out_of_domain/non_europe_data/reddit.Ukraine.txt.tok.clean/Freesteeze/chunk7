  looks like a homage to the iwc pilot chronograph . 
  iwc schaffhausen is a german watch company . 
  watches by brands like sinn and iwc wo n't hold their value as well as a patek or rolex , for example . 
  bar iconic models like a. lange s\u00f6hne grand lange . 
  market value or resale is simply how much people are willing to pay for it . 
  more people are interested in buying preowned rolex or patek , it 's the free market at work . 
  if you love a watch and plan on wearing it to death you should n't be worried about it 's resale value . 
  it gives people peace of mind if a situation comes up and they have to liquidate their watch they can cash out on most if not all what they paid for it . 
  enjoy the watch , the explorer ii is my favorite rolex . 
  of course , where would you find algerians who speak in a ukrainian accent ? 
  you could talk this down at an ad for that price . 
  i would be weary of buying a watch like that with so many complications online for a price like that . 
  typical bbc sensationalizing titles . 
  ukraine 's not headed for civil war just * yet *, 
  who is n't at least bilingual in luxembourg ? 
  hard to tell from just the face , take the back off and take a photo of the movement . 
  love the no date sub , to me it has less of a presence on the wrist but in a fantastic way !, 
  russian has a lot of borrowed words from french . 
  i 'm about a2 in french if you 're eager to exchange languages . 
  you sound like most americans learning russian . 
  in \u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u043e and \u0433\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0442\u044c your \u0440 's are a bit swallowed up . 
  stressing is instrumental to the correct pronunciation in russian . 
  keep imersing yourself in russian and you will naturally get better at it . 
  i had no problem understanding you . 
  honest question , after the two awful \u00d6zil misses why does he still have a starting 11 spot over g\u00f6tze ? 
  listening to fox news radio just puts the cringe cherry on the top . 
  thank you , i will put this to good use . 
  when i stumble upon the occasional polish article or video i feel like i can get the gist of what is being discussed . 
  it 's low hanging so i might as well learn . 
  interestingly enough i feel i can understand it better than serbo-croatian or bulgarian , which i imagined would be closer to eastern slavic . 
  regards, 
  these countires have no right to ban their ideologies as that would be outright totalitarianism . 
  germany in particular still has a large far-right party , the nationaldemokratische partei deutschlands , which resembles neo-nazism but has not been banned . 
  in the most recent election far-right parties have gained a footing in the european parliament . 
  [ crimea ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_crimea ), 
  til malta is a part of italy, 
  [ thank me later ] ( https://www.facebook.com/germanwags ), 
  how can anyone think that this is moving forward ? 
  banning political parties/ideologies is not in line with european values , it is a step closer towards facism and totalitarianism that the yatsenyuk government was accused of . 
  ukrainian patriot , and * against * the banning of ukraine 's communist party . 
  the only people who could shoot down aircrafts in eastern ukraine are putin 's terrorists who are backed and supplied by russia . 
  the ` pro-russian ' protester/rebels/activists do not have the resources to shoot something this high up down . 
  the russian flag is upside down but who 's complaining ? 
  is there any reason cultural or otherwise trap is big in denmark ? 
  i would have never thought, 
  welp , looks like one more thing i 'll be doing next summer, 
  i had a dream i could buy my way to nato , when i awoke i spent it in the eu .

  * ca n't think of a 10th but it 'd probably be a grand complications minute repeater, 
  i think it 's kinda special . 
  before the milgauss the sea dweller was the only rolex with writing on the caseback . 
  if i 'm not mistaken is n't that a luxembourgish flag and not a dutch flag ? 
  luxembourg has a 3:5 proportions and netherlands has 2:3 proportions . 
  luxembourg 's blue is pantone 299 and netherlands ' is 286 . 
  i chose the embroidery as it is very unique for a flag ( in my opinion ) to have something like this on it . 
  embroidery ( \u0432\u0438\u0448\u0438\u0432\u043a\u0430 , vyshyvka ) has a rich history in belarus and ukraine . 
  i could not find a suitable crown as belarus for most of her history has been nearly an extension of russia , and always subject to russia 's enormous power . 
  do you mean something like this ? 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pahonia in retrospect that would have been much better . 
  who knows , i may chose to make an updated one . 
  as far as the ukrainian coat of arms , i thought it looked bare with a tryzub without a wreath . 
  in hindsight , i should have considered [ 1 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/west_ukrainian_people%27s_republic#mediaviewer/file:zunr_coa.svg ) or [ 2 ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a2/large_coat_of_arms_of_ukraine_%28color%29.png ), 
  the fact that we had already heard most of the songs prior to the album release killed the element of surprise for one . 
  also it featured too many artists to really give a handful of artists to shine , a few members of g.o.o.d. 
  were overshadowed . 
  very colorblind friendly flag . 
  bruce springsteen , lou reed , elton john , and obama have praised kanye west and paul mccartney is working with him . 
  kanye has no talent , right ? 
  bavaria is to germany as texas is to the united states . 
  take that as you will, 
  if an american were to go to sweden to attend college , they would end up paying about the same sticker price as in the us . 
  scandinavians enjoy the highest taxes in the world and cost of living . 
  interesting . 
  from what i 've heard luxury shopping in asia is more expensive than elsewhere, 
  what will you use the gmt hand for as you live in gmt +0 ? 
  the field pullover is so nice , congrats . 
  wish i could find one for a price slightly below rape, 
  switzerland probably has the most expensive luxury watches . 
  currency exchange to chf and vat if you 're in the eu . 
  * the opening part of i am a god when the heavenly bass comes in, 
  * the background chorus in jesus walks, 
  * aotl interlude, 
  * `` you gon ' see lawyers and niggas in [ yeezys ] '' ( live ), 
  the swatch sistem 51 for $ 150 keeps better time than a patek at $ 150,000 . 
  great looking and unique watch . 
  you 'll be paying full price to service that at rolex , keep that in mind . 
  this is because the initial warranty with rolex is up . 
  talk him down from 5.5 , you can definitely do so . 
  2 years from purchase from an ad, 
  `` i smoke i drink i 'm stop i ca n't because , if you do n't like it get off my , get off my . . '' while the hell of a life beat rolls in . 
  perfect,
