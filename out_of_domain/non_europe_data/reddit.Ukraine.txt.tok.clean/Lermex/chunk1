that was a great video , thanks . 
  i would love to watch a full play in op . 
  [ instructions on how to make one ] ( http://origamiyoda.wordpress.com/folding-your-own-origami-yoda-other-star-wars-papercraft/ ), 
  this . 
  i think you should try to see guys as potential friends first , and see friends as potential boyfriends . 
  my best relationship with a girl began after a year of being friends .

  why not have fun trying ? 
  til there already is a word for anything you can ever do in bed, 
  now teens will think 12 is the society approved age to have sex . 
  some will start lying that they do it and others will respond by actually doing it to not fall behind . 
  you do n't need a debugger , nobody seriously uses a debugger for java . 
  learn to work with log statements ( basically system.out.println ( ) ) . 
  and this way you can use notepad + + and console - the best combo for learning how stuff actually works . 
  this inheritance is unused and confusing : you do n't actually instantiate this class later in your code , instead you use composition - store a reference to a plain jframe object inside of your object . 
  you 're right , of course , but my point was that debugger should n't constrain your choice of tools/environment as it , while nice to have during your first steps , is not indispensable . 
  if you want to use hot technologies , i would recommend you to choose ruby + rails or python + django , but either way you will have to learn a new language . 
  js is not a good server-side option for beginner/intermediate developer as it is kind of exotic in this role and is n't very well covered by documentation , books and tutorials . 
   package helloworldapp ; / / is this like import ? 
  what does it mean and do, 
  it declares which package this class belongs to . 
  package is almost the same concept as folder . 
   public helloworldapp ( ) {, 
  / / why did they make this ? 
  no practical reason for this . 
  some authors recommend to include empty default constructors as a `` good style '' , but this practice is n't well accepted and i have n't come across it at work . 
  well , it will be called if you instantiate this class . 
  what did you build your site on ? 
  some kind of cms ? 
  you need a jdk - java development kit . 
  you can get it here :, 
  but be sure to download the one for your operating system and cpu architecture ( 32 or 64 bit ) . 
  junit is still it . 
  yes , there are newer testing frameworks , but their additional features will not be useful to you until much , much later . 
  junit is the industry standart and you will do yourself a favor by learning it . 
  and all of my 100 + co-workers , with 1-10 + years of experience and our team leaders and architects are also not competent developers ? 
  we develop various telecommunication software ( i.e. 
  operational and business support systems ) and debugger is something i 've never seen any one of our projects use . 
  can you , please , provide counterexamples , i.e. 
  big java projects that use debugger as part of their development/testing ? 
  this code works ... what exactly do you need help with ? 
  `` grade_averages '' is a very bad class name . 
  class names should always start with a capital letter and multiple-word names should be written in camelcase,

  if it 's made mostly of edible stuff , then it 's the best friggin ' cake i 've ever seen o_o, 
  i see what you did there, 
  i just upvoted you midway through the post and moved on . 
  this is not good code by any metric . 
  yeah , as if you 're actually reading taocp , 
  native russian speaker here . 
  passed one of the tests ( http://learnrussian.rt.com/tests/test-11 ) just for fun . 
  got 89 % . 
  hey , i 'm not the op , but i 've been struggling for a long time to understand cross-hatching and specifically the question of which direction to draw the lines . 
  i 've read on the internet that the lines should follow the object 's `` shape '' , but the teacher in my art class told me exactly the opposite -- to choose a random direction for lines and show the shape of the object only through lights and darks . 
  can you say which one is correct and why ? 
  thanks . 
  i read the title as `` physicists create quantum link that ** does n't ** exist at the same time '' . 
  sounds much more interesting , 
  it 's a conflict between python 2.7.4 and a lower version . 
  check that you 're running the correct python executable, 
  thanks , til you can drag routes to customize . 
  but , how good is the interface really if i never knew of this feature for all these years ? . . 
  it 's `` draw calls '' , not `` cell '' , so the rest of your explanation is wrong too . 
  basically a draw call is a single request from your cpu to your gpu to draw a bunch of vertices . 
  more [ on stackoverflow here . 
  ] ( http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4853856/why-are-draw-calls-expensive ), 
   it is compiled while java is interpreted ,, 
  this is wrong for both . 
  they are both compiled to bytecode ( which is then interpreted by a vm , but this is not what is usually meant by `` interpreted '' language ) or they can both be compiled to native code using 3rd-party tools . 
  so absolutely no difference between java and c # on this point . 
  java programmer . 
  my collegues laugh at me for `` only getting to doing actual work after all the colors in the ide and os are right '' ,

  i got myself a nexus 6 phone this week and today i got an idea to try looing at demos aimed at google cardboard just by holding my dk2 lenses in front of the phone with my fingers . 
  it worked suprisingly well and allowed me to see how much screen door effect is left at 1440p ... which is practically none !, 
  i was really surprised by difference from the dk2 . 
  i was sceptical before because 1080p -  1440p does n't sound like that much of a jump . 
  now i ca n't wait for the next oculus ( dk3 , cv1 or whatever ) .
