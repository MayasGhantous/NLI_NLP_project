plutonia is somewhat more crazy , as it is made by real maniacs . 
  team tnt is a one of the best `` doom '' teams , so their wads are better ( icarus , evilution ) , their dos-based port ( boom ) is better than vanilla and could be used under dosbox as well . 
  so yes , both final doom wads are great , but evilution is more ` classic ', 
  ] ( http://search.ligazakon.ua/l_doc2.nsf/link1/t012341.html ), 
  it is even 40uah in kyiv ( livoberegna ) now . 
  it is still 2usd so far, 
  you can just use a [ dosbox ] ( http://www.dosbox.com/wiki/dosbox_and_mac_os_x ) . 
  i use it on kubuntu for 4 + years - everything is fine , just like in 90s . 
  just an emulator of dos , so only dos-based apps avaliable to launch,

  some teams decide to give the # 12 to the fans , as they could be s half of the team . 
  as instance , there is a # 10 in brescia ( baggio ) , maldini and baresi in milan etc. 
  imho , there is only one indiana . 
  ( just remembered south park episode `` free hat '' ), 
  thanks for the response . 
  it 's kubuntu for 4 years ( but looking forward to move on and choose another distro or even freebsd ) . 
  kgtk looks nice ( i would try it , thx for the link and idea ) , but comments show problems with ff . 
  yeap , i prefer nightly , as it has more features to test . 
  thx , it really looks like a dead-end . 
  will it make sens to install thunar and delete it ? 
  better to hold torres on the 46th minute . 
  but barca is still ahead . 
  even now , versus atm and ref, 
  if i got the sense . 
  in unix-based you can just type $ pyhton % filename % . py ( or python3 ) . 
  in windows , i guess , you should just write the full path to the file in console ( cmd ) . 
  as  c : \\ python34 \\ % python executable % . exe % filename % . py . 
  on another hand you can just pen file in idle and press `` run '' in it 's menu, 
  mb you are right , but actually , i 've never faced ptoblems with path . 
  maybe , i did n't get the problem . 
  hope . 
  someone to be a better advisor, 
  yeah , i know that . 
  but if you install python from default repos ( debian in my case ) , you will not face problems . 
  the same with default directory in windows , proposed by installer , i guess . 
  but yeah , path should be defined properly . 
  i 've already visited it . 
  open containing folder opens dolphin , as defined by system settings and mimeapps.list . 
  actually , i do n't remember myself to edit defaults.list , so will try it asap . 
  thanks !,

  gibraltar will make the show, 
  2018 is in three years, 
  imho , the best mediaplayer for gnu/linux on desktop , great to see the 1.0 for android !, 
  ronaldo could easily be banned for this match too , according to result . 
  great game for simeone 's men, 
  `` oh no , not again '' . 
  i really like this game , but first ` hitman-based ' movie was not so good . 
  trailer looks to be full of action , blood and guns , but the real nature of 47 is silence , but who cares , bloody hell is in trend since wolf3d and doom published,

  indiana joned is not a bond , i think , there should be only one actor . 
  alas , ford is old and i have no influence , so let it be someone with the `` han solo 's / indie 's '' charisma . 
  it 's more than a rude ban for them . 
  not only a rude , but dumb and stupid . 
  that 's even could be worth a yellow card during the game , but we have , what do we have , as first president of ukraine told, 
  it has an annual fee + privacy protection ( sometimes ) . 
  if your local currency is non-stable to dollar ( i.e. 
  uah ) , it 's better to purchase for 10 years ( max ), 
  it used to be there , but the bank on the shirts is a bankrupt now . 
  blank shirts are better imho, 
  they have different sponsors . 
  on my memory , the logo changed 4 or 5 times . 
  some ultras asked the president of dynamo kyiv not to make any changes , but money ca n't appear itself . 
  yes , surkis is not poor , but the question is still open . 
  i have looked through some huge ukrainian resources , not enough info . 
  still to discover, 
  nothing is over here , the game in kyiv would be interesting, 
  i have changed fcb crest to my native city club 's crest , 
  thanks , hope to see the success after shakhtar 's failure, 
  i know , but there is a feeling , that we 'll see more than 1 goal, 
  for example , aek athens in 02/03 . 
  6 draws in the group stage and 3rd place -  uefa cup . 
  have you tried to do something like [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bhvrs5c.jpg ) ? 
  and what do you have [ here ] ( http://i.imgur.com/2llfgoc.jpg ) ? 
  i guess , there are is only one choice : or save or preview . 
  according to transcript from ukrainian '' \u041a\u0438\u0457\u0432 '' , kiev is formed from russian '' \u041a\u0438\u0435\u0432 '' . 
  dynamo is ukrainian club , kyiv is the capital of ukraine , so formally it is correct to spell `` kyiv '', 
  rebrov is such a fresh breath . 
  serhiy , thanks for this dynamo, 
  it 's a very good season for dynamo so far . 
  reminds me the golden era of lobanovsky . 
  glad , that the champions league in 2015/2016 will be with the club from kyiv, 
  a tough game for dnipro . 
  anyway , good luck , guys . 
  i admire ajax as a club and great academy , but this game has the club from ua , so , \u0437\u0438\u0447\u0443 \u0443\u0441\u043f\u0456\u0445\u0456\u0432 '' \u0414\u043d\u0456\u043f\u0440\u0443 '', 
  unfortunately , valeriy vasyliovych died in 2002 and dynamo was not the same club as earlier . 
  lots of coaches , fails and pain . 
  especially with blohin , a real legend as a player , but he lost as a club coach ( not as the coach of the national team ) . 
  let it be the old-day dynamo , which can make the pain for opponent, 
  great success for ukrainian teams in europa league , but ajax is still a great club . 
  hope , there is small amount of ` vata ' here , so \u0421\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0430 \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0456 !, 
  what a great day for national football, 
  hello , people . 
  mr.wales . 
  few silly questions . 
  if you create a device like a the hitchhiker 's guide to the galaxy , what catchphrase will you put on it ? 
  and how often do you check the wiki-page about yourself ? 
  and not silly questions for every guest , what is the hardest in defending people 's rights and liberties ( i.e. 
  some people are against defending their liberties for some reasons , government bans , some crazy organizations with opposite goals ) ?
