  thanks, 
  any card is acceptable and could be bought in supermarket or kiosk . 
  data connection is not so good . 
  in huge cities the network connection for calls is good for mts , kyivstar and life  . 
  if you visit ua only for a week , you can buy a [ kyivstar 's ] ( http://www.kyivstar.ua/en/kr/mm/tariffs/prepaid/smartphone1/ ) packet for 10-15 uah and choose the weekly option ( unlimited calls in network and unlim.network traffic ) . 
  if your relatives use phones , it would be good to choose the simcard of the carrier they use , because every carrier provides free-in-network calls , which is cheap and correct . 
  long time ago we had some small 3g-carriers , but their prices were really awful, 
  if government kills for playing on the streets , outdoor , they will play indoor . 
  but messi would n't get a medical treatment , to my mind . 
  but yes , barcelona has an indoor team , so the question is open . 
  damn , i am seriously thinking on it . 
  i looks like orwell-style `` 1984 in sports '' . 
  there was always against soccer . 
  there is a peace with cricket and snooker . 
  goal is an own goal . 
  red card is freedom .

  but thanks for this questions , it is weird , funny and crazy at the same time, 
  wonderful game with lots of moments from each side . 
  to my mind , neymar should have a rest for 1-2 games and he will return better . 
  great night of football . 
  and the fight for the trophy is ** not ** over yet, 
  perez is fond of breaking transfer records and making huge deals . 
  but bale could be effective in proper times . 
  as ( unfortunately ) he scored a goal in copa final during the martino 's fcb era ... 
  dynamo kyiv vs bayern clash ( 3:3 ) for fcdk and barca vs r.madrid with the first messi 's hat-trick for fcb . 
  and also i like the match , in which dynamo won against barca 4:0 at camp nou, 
  killing legs union indeed , versus every random team, 
  tymoshuchuk in starting xi . 
  great experienced player , but it is a brave decision , pan mykola, 
  where are my heart pills ? 
  but nothing is over , goal was close to be scored, 
  plays for fc shakhtar for many years . 
  he is a good keeper , but sometimes makes silly decisions, 
  let 's get 3 points in other games, 
  i am following the estonian football since previous season . 
  fond of tammeka and admire n\u00f5mme . 
  also followed levadia just before roman smishko has left the club for trans, 
  you can visit baltic states , they are not so big and buses go between them every day . 
  i have visited tartu ( estonia ) and riga ( latvia ) , it was around 6-9 eur for a night ticket from tartu to riga . 
  there are a lot of places to see , from tallinn you can get to scandinavia . 
  on the other hand you mentioned turkey . 
  the south of country is notable by some mountains , but in summer it could be too hot at noon . 
  also , there is a cappadocia ( buses go there too ) . 
  you can watch some our trip [ photos ] ( https://flic.kr/s/ahsjl43lpj ) and decide . 
  people in estonia know english well , elderly people speak russian too . 
  i hope that this would help . 
  sure . 
  i has become a student of tartu univ , not fir a long time for personal reasons . 
  but i 've visited tammeka - trans match ( 2:1 ) , even made the [ video ] ( https://youtu.be/qmssoq2koug ) of the second tamma 's goal, 
  ford is still an awesome actor . 
  one of the important reasons the sw saga lives , imho,

  a bit of magic from iniesta . 
  wonderful, 
  good luck in semis . 
  dnipro can do it !,

  dip books are also available on amazon, 
  fine map , but doom with mouse is littke bit wierd for me . 
  i know , that i can not use it , but it seems lika a game from 21st century now ), 
  maybe that 's true , but i prefer the classic way . 
  with dosbox , vanilla ( or boom port ) and a piece of the nostalgia, 
  there were a lot of wonderful players in barca, 
  almost the same situation . 
  fcb is my favourite foreign club since 1999 . 
  rivaldo and kluivert were really cool . 
  and i remember the first figo 's clasico at camp nou in rma 's shirt . 
  strong emotions, 
  one of the coolest characters in sw `` 6 fillm '' galaxy , though he had only a small couple of epsiode minutes in the original trilogy . 
  well , not a legal goal , but it counts as away goal , which is a great handicap for dnipro , but napoli would be angry in the second leg . 
  reddit is like chuck norris among the web-sites , if you know what i mean, 
  mr lukas , i suppose , you can do it yourself  ok . 
  the man was standing in front of the optic store , eating a banana sandwich & drinking some coffee . 
  suddenly he heard a weird noise . 
  it looked like a sandwich had begun to eat him . 
  my congratulations to dnipro and it 's fans .

  [ olimpiysky ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ce_shbqukaavbtf.jpg:large ), 
  such a sweet smell of nostalgia . 
  this revenant reminds my previous 20 years playing ( vanilla ) doom2 . 
  oh , yeah , it 's real, 
  sw episodes iv-vi , if they do n't enjoy the original movies , ( spoiler alert ) i am not their father, 
   now yandex shows these images in its full glory !!,

  i would give him a brush and say that he really can be a great artist . 
  i have forgotten something , but it 's still b2 ( proofed by ielts in 2014 ), 
  hello !, 
  i do n't know what exactly is with privat , but i have checked the first random bank ( otp bank , hungarian bank in common ) . 
  according to tables , they allow more than $ 500 by [ wu ] ( http://en.otpbank.com.ua/privateclients/money-transfers/westernunion.php ) and moneygram . 
  but the commission is high in this case . 
  and i guess , that it is possible to send money by paypal . 
  ukrainian cards work for payments/transfers via paypal / your ukrainian contact may put money on her card and try to send them ( if transferring such sums is allowed by bank ) . 
  hope you will cope with this situation, 
  sorry for the stupid question , but do you ( like a true-hitchhiker ) follow the `` always know where your towel is '' rule ( based on the hitchhiking guide to galaxy ) ? 
  thanks for the answer . 
  seems , you are ready for everything , even to meet the ravenous bugblatter . 
  good luck in your journey, 
  congratulations to sevilla and her fans . 
  thanks , dnipro , for the wonderful season .
