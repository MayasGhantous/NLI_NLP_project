  and all the best to matheus, 
  i like dynamo , but support dnipro , as it is a club from my country , from a great city . 
  i support any ukrainian club in european cups . 
  and dnipro with dynamo are not so big rivals in ukraine . 
  and i also support bar\u00e7a from the kluivert-rivaldo times as well, 
  that means something like `` it 's not over yet '', 
  `` in the democratic country '' . 
  you can ` cut off ' as many heads you want , but the dragon of fifa corruption would still be alive ... 
  sending a pm , thanks !, 
  a great woman , who is doing a good job . 
  strongly recommended, 
  thank you very much . 
  oops , really-really sorry, 
  it was a really stressful penalty shoot-out . 
  loosing a final , dynamo made it to the victory . 
  i agree , that was awesome , but after the match it was an accident on strong emotions . 
  could be a trouble for the stadium , but now the main point is the victory . 
  that team is dnipro , dynamo was eliminated by fiorentina in el quarterfinal, 
  he needs a game practice , but in dynamo , while shovkosky is still playing , he ca n't get his chance . 
  with 5-6 matches per year it is hard to keep skills . 
  maybe , in year or two , when sasho retires , he will be the # 1 on the fcdk goals, 
  what a season for vermaelen !, 
  you can choose the [ ecolines ] ( http://legacy.ecolines.net/index.php?s=84 ) website , i used them triple times ( kyiv-tartu , and then tartu-riga , riga-kyiv ) . 
  comfortable , some buses are equipped with sockets and wifi . 
  i do n't know about the prices , maybe it is expensive . 
  this is not an advertisement , just an advice . 
  unfortunately , [ the site ] ( http://busfor.ua ) , which is monitoring the different prices on simple routes is having issues for a long time and is not able to show the list of available propositions . 
  upd : now it works . 
  but still has only ukrainian and russian interface . 
  [ example for the 1st of july ] ( http://busfor.ua/%d0%b0%d0%b2%d1%82%d0%be%d0%b1%d1%83%d1%81%d0%b8/%d0%92%d0%b0%d1%80%d1%88%d0%b0%d0%b2%d0%b0/%d0%9a%d0%b8%d1%97%d0%b2/1%d0%bb%d0%b8%d0%bf%d0%bd%d1%8f ) . 
  i do n't know the date , it is easy to change it . 
  you can always use dosbox as well as mentioned above . 
  chocolate-doom , mentioned by viciarg is like a vanilla doom, 
  doom ( 1-2 ) and heroes ( 1-2 ) . 
  still playing, 
  just coffee . 
  i drink it so much , that mosquitoes ca n't even try my blood , as they are not drinking coffee . 
  damn , i really like it . 
  i was afraid of the upcoming doom , but it looks like a piece of a good-old masterpiece from 90s with modern changes . 
  this is the doom, 
  i really love the head indicator ( used to show an enemy attacking you for pcs without sound card ) and still it was a hope to see it again . 
  we shall thank that there is a health meter . 
  it has passed 22 years , something is forced to be changed . 
  and you can still play doom1-2 as well . 
  but yes , i hope that it will be something about this in future , doom is the game with a great community . 
  and together we can kick cyberdemon 's ass, 
  i will count to 120 if i have only 2 minutes left, 
  hello . 
  first of all , thanks for wonderful roles in dozens of films ,, 
  especially in bttf and interstate 60 . 
  i know , you have been asked this dozens of times , but could you tell please what was your most expected `` year 2015 '' invention to become real ? 
  welcome back and congratulations . 
  sweet and happy tears on eyes . 
  all the best . 
  reddit is becoming even better, 
  the list is not full without [ discow ] ( http://i.imgur.com/8ghkss2.jpg ), 
  that people , born in 1999-2001 can talk , as for me '10 years ago ' is not 2005 , it is much closer to 1997,

   about : crashes, 
  yes , i have sent 3 times them :, 
  thanks for response, 
  ok , thanks for fast responses and help . 
  will use stable edition . 
  have a nice day, 
  not for the battle , ofc , just a wish to tell [ wazzup ] ( http://i.imgur.com/zf7g0if.jpg ) !, 
  actually not . 
  but they are pretty similar in some questions,

  thanks . 
  well , i am using qt/kde , so need to check the compatibility ? 
  once upon a time / / , / ** / and # fought to decide who is the most actual nowadays ... 
  meanwhile $ man looked at them and tears went from her eyes . 
  `` my kids , '' - $ man said . 
  - `` they are so big and adult '' . 
  - `` oh , yes ! '', 
  - answered vi , not interrupting reading his newspaper and smoking a wooden pipe, 
  well , better not too drink so much coffee at 3 a.m. . . 
  well , i have recieved a b2 certificate in 5-6 months . 
  not a perfect b2 , to be honest . 
  and there were lessons 3 times per week and 2 hours each . 
  and my native language and polish are very common . 
  it is possible and easy , if you really want to learn in and to know it . 
  the main ingredient is a wish, 
  mine is ukrainian . 
  and i can name russian as almost native too , as grew up in russian-speaking family . 
  some words from ukr , some from rus are pretty similar with word from pol , and grammar is common . 
  afaik , the slavic-language grammar is very difficult for other and that is the main point to understand , i am not sure, 
  so close ... 
  but de gea is de gea, 
  ok , let it be . 
  but in the second half seleznyov will be on the field !, 
  that 's true , in lviv 's region club . 
  both he and milevskyi have somewhat ruined their careers , but were talented young sportsmen, 
  kravets , damn it ... 
  rip , spain , 
  congratulations , spain . 
  well , po for ukraine , once again, 
  great david de gea , too late subs from fomenko ... 
  so , po , let it be ...
