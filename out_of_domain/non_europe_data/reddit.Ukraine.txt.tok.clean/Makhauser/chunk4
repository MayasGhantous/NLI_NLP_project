  i remember most of our pos ... 
  especially vs slovenia nt and the mistake by shovkovsky 15 years ago ... 
  they both were a ` golden ' pair in dynamo kyiv 's school . 
  aliev was somewhat influenced by milevskyi , but yes , he was more likely to become a world star . 
  he prefered alcohol too , as well as caught the ` star ' , having some beautiful seasons . 
  then he chose the second dk team career , few years in russia and now is playing for amateur team . 
  but also played in the friendly match , dedicated to the memory of andrii husin , the legend of dynamo and ukrainian nt , who has passed away 1 year ago, 
  well , slovenia . 
  sashko , [ do n't go for a walk ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgscdyct1jy ) , please, 
  yes , it was an awful mistake . 
  ukraine is very lucky in po matches ( 5 pos , 5 eliminations from croatia , slovenia , germany , greece and france ) . 
  let the best team to win the game , without mistakes from players and referees . 
  it would be a great duel . 
  but he can still make stupid mistakes too . 
  and could not do anything in 2010 against greece, 
  i hope , it would be as cool , as original boba fett from sw . as remarkable as han solo and as killing as the death star . 
  and so cute as r2d2 's beeping , ewoks and chewbacca . 
  and please , no midi-chlorians, 
  writing something in text field and pressing the `` save '' button . 
  that is how it works . 
  approximately 3-4 cups ( 500ml ) per day . 
  or more . 
  instant and natural coffee . 
  without milk and sugar . 
  just because i am fond of taste and it helps to make stupid things faster . 
  actually yes , but is still becomes better from year to year and depends on the amount of people connected , network settings and the type of connection . 
  i faced a 900-2500 ms ping from mcdonalds open network on the server from the same city and about 12-15ms from the wired connection on the server in 1500km . 
  lots of factors , but yes , the main one is the distance, 
  just to any server , entire , from 1000 km , from the next-door girl 's pc . 
  just a number, 
  unfortunately , nope . 
  there used to live an old disabled lady , but no girls at all . 
  nobody watches ` sheldon cooper fun with flags ' nowadays ... 
  leaving my browser tabs opened while being away from computer, 
  hello , mr.murray . 
  thanks for you job . 
  was the morning `` wakeup '' radio song annoying and familiar ? 
  if yes , who you gon na call ? 
  i have got the experience with android , ios , winmobile , symbian , firefox os and j2me platforms . 
  each of them has pros and cons . 
  on android phone you can install apps not from the market , not officially , but have a root-access , turning the phone into a linux one . 
  but it has lots of bugs , my android phonre 's ( aus zenfone 5 ) google play services crashes 4-10 times per day . 
  ios phones are pretty popular , but too proprietary . 
  symbian 8.1 phone is still with me and it is almost perfect, 
  firefoxos is a cool os , but still needs to be the competitor, 
  winmobile is not yet supported, 
  j2me is pretty good too . 
  fyi , that is obvious , but apple is a monopoly for ios , while android could be isntalled on lot of devices . 
  that is the main point , those phones are more powerful and just for me , android is better than ios . 
  unfortunately , nokia does n't provide meego/maemo phones now , so the choice for an everyday use ( with sms/icq/skype / calls , reddit , twitter , facebook , instagram or something else ) is android for me , if only 2 os are available to choose . 
  but it depends on your needs too . 
  [ codecademy ] ( https://www.codecademy.com/tracks/python ) is the best choice , with a console and ide . 
  also [python.org ] ( http://python.org ) , [ learn python the hard way ] ( http://learnpythonthehardway.org/ ) and dive into python ( [ 2 ] ( http://www.diveintopython.net/ ) , [ 3 ] ( http://www.diveintopython3.net/ ) ) are cool . 
  some other sites provide too , but these are the best imho, 
  edit : and on / r/learnpython people can help too, 
  be aware to learn py3 , py2 would become a history in few years, 
  i am 24 and have not ever been in relationships yet . 
  i do n't think it is weird , just not the right time for them . 
  and yes , people are also afraid of me sometimes , as i am a red-eyed it-geek . 
  well , on our tv rus-lang films are going with ukr-lang subs . 
  in one episode the woman said : `` it is not so hard to hide ** the gender ** of a baby for 6 months '' , and the translation was : `` it is not so hard to hide ** the half ** of a baby for 6 months '' . 
  the point is russian '' \u043f\u043e\u043b '' ( en . 
  ` gender ' / ` sex ' ) could also mean the floor and the half . 
  so yes , some bloody translator 's dreams, 
  your bed before waking up, 
  not the same , as no solo , leia or chewbacca in sw1 trailer . 
  that is the main factor for sw7 , tears on eyes , oldskool etc. 
  `` 42 '' \u00a9 douglas adams, 
  in modern world you need money to pay for food , water , heat , electricity and internet . 
  you will earn money at work to be able to pay for it . 
  and school is afantastic time from elderly background , you ought to appreciate the school and university time while you can, 
  i sucked at philosophy and something related . 
  it is not the reason not to go . 
  i have changed 3 universities ( 2 for bsc and 1 - msc ) with only 1 successful graduation , so have experience in laziness and doing nothing . 
  i am a closed and sociophobic person too , but community sometimes is helpful, 
  is it the binary system ? 
  in any case , appr . 
  many stupid mistakes made , sociophobic personality and a great laziness to improve perosnal life . 
  brain, 
  so long and thanks for all the ~ ~ fish ~ ~ cheese ? 
  there were a lot of them . 
  from the latest , i guess , is the 1st of september , 1939 , as the wwii began . 
  millions of victims in total . 
  absolutely , their are connected together to make the xx century to bloody and rude,

  glad to see el kono in sevilla 's starting xi, 
  ouch , that is hard to read even if you can say his surname in ukrainian , 
  well , it is ok , for sure . 
  that 's why kono is more easy . 
  or , for example , name him by his name : zhenya , yevhen or zheka . 
  and the 35th match without a champions league clean sheet in a row for akinfeev . 
  it was hard not to score again him, 
   when you do things right , people wo n't be sure you 've done anything at all, 
  some magic from konoplyanka ^_^, 
  1 from 6 . 
  well done , guys . 
  just a little karma cashback for the a\u010dimovi\u010d 's goal in 1999, 
  better one :, 
  `` make me a sandwich '', 
  `` what ?
