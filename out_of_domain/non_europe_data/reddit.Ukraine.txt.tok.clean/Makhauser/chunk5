  make it yourself '', 
  `` okay '', 
  that reminds me how i handcuffed myself . 
  naked , with the hands behind the back , the keyhole was not accessible to open , as was on the unreachable side . 
  and impossible to put hands to the front side . 
  well , that was n't with a lady , but a curious one too, 
  [ pique 's reaction ] ( https://twitter.com/3gerardpique/status/672176304045838337 ), 
  16 long years ... ukraine is on euro , dynamo is in the play-off . 
  amazing, 
  yeap , sure . 
  i am talking about the lucky year . 
  from another hand , ukraine has qualified through the po for the first time, 
  actually , it is not the civil war , yes . 
  lot 's of russians there . 
  yes , there are some native population in the east , but they are not the core . 
  on paper there is a peace time without heavy weapons , but in fact terrorists shoot at ukrainian army forces all day long with grads and guns . 
  situation is sad and just now there is no chance for it to end in the nearest future, 
  i will buy instant noodles for the rest om my life . 
  i guess , it will be about a year or two , if i eat them everyday 3 times per day . 
  the cacodemon ( original one ) , duke nukem , and , probably , kenny, 
  lucas turned it into the biology branch with his damned midi *** ans ... 
  something similar to [ ghost ] ( http://kde-look.org/content/show.php/ghost?content=107902 ) plasma theme . 
  could be installed from settings, 
  that was unpredictable , 
  great job , leo !, 
  high five , cristiano, 
  such an unpopular decision . 
  persona was great ... panorama , persona ... * and e10s is alive *, 
  it is a fantastic map . 
  as any of romero 's . 
  tested on boom ( dosbox ) - fine , on vaniila there is a visplane error, 
  awwww !, 
  so cute \\ ^_^, 
  well , at least there is a goal at home ... 
  will be 25 in summer , too . 
  i guess , we both will not see the heat death of the universe , the time machine , the perpetuum mobile and the stuff we liked to eat in 90s with that taste, 
  yes . 
  the true taste of some food . 
  i do n't know how in the world , but in my country the 90s mirinda was better , the 90s chocolate bars - too . 
  as well as chips, 
  he made the football much better . 
  brilliant coach , brilliant player , the brilliant man . 
  rest in peace , johan, 
  as cacodemon is my favorite monster in games ever , i have even played doom with a deh , which makes them absolutely harmless and mostly immortal, 
   hit points = 400000, 
   far attack frame = 0, 
  officialy , it is eet/eest . 
  but some hotels , shops and institutions have cet/cest clocks . 
  the zakarpatya region is close to hungary , there are a lot of hungarians and hungarian language ( dual-language street signs , for example ) . 
  last year visit to beregove and its ' surroundings forced a phone to gmt +1 . 
  geographically it is possible , but actually , the time in whole ukraine ** officially ** is set to gmt +2, 
  yes , something like that . 
  some people use `` regional '' cet , but if we speak about the fact , it is better to use eet . 
  uzhhorod , as far as i remember , uses everywhere the eet, 
  hello , mr.klimkin . 
  thanks for doing the iama . 
  what do you think about the possibility for the open labor force market between ua and eu ( not just in a visa-free agreement for ukraine ) ? 
  i guess , it would be to hard for it . 
  episode vii was expected by people as they could see han , luke and leia again . 
  according to the specific topic of the roque one , imo it can break some records , but without a last-year boom . 
  but if it shows something familiar for the classic trilogy fans ( the death star , darth vader or somebody 's young years , so yes , 1b is possible ), 
  still impossible to be installed on zenfone 5 . 
  as far as i see in comments , it is a plus of this model, 
  great for shakhtar , they are forced to play away from home . 
  2 years in a row for ukrainian clubs in el semis . 
  just amazing . 
  yeah , it was a disappointment in cl , but also it was a huge progress in a form : the first champions league 's po after the lobanovsky era, 
  absolutely . 
  so many years in the club , even in this hard situation . 
  deserves a huge respect, 
  hope , rebrov will make the changes and next results would be better, 
  according to the situation in country , and with the ukrainian football , it is just amazing . 
  unfortunately , dnipro lost to sevilla . 
  i support every ukr . 
  team in eurocups , does n't matter from where they are . 
  i really do n't understand some people , who wish the lose to shaktar , dynamo , dnipro or zorya , for example, 
  what a wonderful ending of the great fairy-tail . 
  my congratulations to every leicester fan, 
  hello . 
  every ukrainian card is now nano/micro/minisim , so will fit the iphone 's port . 
  if you have a phone from a carrier , it can be a problem . 
  we do n't have 4g , only 3g now . 
  most common prepaid carriers are [ lifecell ] ( http://www.lifecell.com.ua/uk/ ) , [ kyivstar ] ( http://www.kyivstar.ua/en/mm/ ) and [ vodafone ] ( http://vodafone.ua/en ) ( commonly known as mts and umc ) . 
  unfortunately , lifecell does n't have the en-version, 
  the best cover provides kyivstar , i guess . 
  lifecell is rather popular and easy-to-buy, 
  vodafone provides 3g-packages with an unlimited access to texts via viber and whatsapp , to facebook and twitter . 
  50uah ( appr . $ 2 ) for 2gb of mobile internet . 
  it 's a nice step , i am investigating the system , but i have disabled the ** tabs ** ( and made a feedback survey as well ) are pinned , but not ` sticked ' to the top . 
  and does n't have notification with the light for updates . 
  this made me a little bit sad . 
  ** long bar ** seems nice as far as i use it , thus you can just remove the search bar from the top if you want . 
  and ** activity stream ** with latest bookmarks is really cool . 
  thanks for response . 
  sure , i can . 
  but unfortunately , only in few hours . 
  actually , there [ is a notification ] ( http://i.imgur.com/1ydkaae.png ) , sorry for that , but it is not as in horizontal tabs . 
  i know , that the present one seems to be better for vertical tabs , but if they are not `` sticked '' , the notification will be visible only when someone returns to the first tabs . 
  and sometimes there are more than 100 tabs ... 
  3 in a row , fantastic !,
