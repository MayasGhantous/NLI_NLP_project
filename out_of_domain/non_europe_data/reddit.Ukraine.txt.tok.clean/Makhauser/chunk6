  i guess , sevilla will be on the third place in their next cl group . 
  you may be only the second in the sevilla league . 
  it depends on the carrier . 
  the ordinar price for lifecell or vodafone ( they could be bought in supermarkets , in lots of kiosk as well as in airports and railway stations ) is about 30uah ( or less ) ( appr . 
  $ 1.15-1 .20 or $ 1 ) , but there are no money there often , thats why you should also buy a payment card or use the atm . 
  be aware , that some of them ( if not all ) take some commission for every payment . 
  to be honest , he is a real legend . 
  for shakhtar , and both ukrainian and european football . 
  good luck , mircea, 
  i have missed them . 
  sweet times with alaves , oviedo , tenerife and more . 
  sure . 
  [ so long and thank for all the ... pillows ] ( #irony ) ( \u0414\u0438\u043c\u043e\u043d \u0436\u0435 ), 
  gitlab [ \u043e\u0442\u043c\u0435\u0442\u0438\u043b ] ( https://www.gnu.org/software/repo-criteria-evaluation.html ) \u0434\u0430\u0436\u0435 \u0421\u0442\u043e\u043b\u043b\u043c\u0430\u043d . 
  not as bad , as expected . 
  happy for zinchenko to play in the match . 
  this is ukraine i know . 
  great game for them so far . 
  they may try and qualify to the round of 16 , it would be deserved as well as todays victory, 
  sad , but deserved 4th place in the group ... so , sheva will be the next head coach ? 
  he was a great player , the real legend , but yes , hope shevchenko will not be a coach now . 
  thought about lucescu too , but he is a little bit old and was linked with zenit ( as well as some clubs from turkey ) . 
  i also want to see ukraine with a foreigner as a coach , but it seems to be a sort of sci-fi . 
  miron markevich has not signed a new contract with dnipro , he can be as well . 
  i hoped for ajax to dedicate the game to johan , but it 's ok, 
  hi , sandy , thanks for all the stuff you have created . 
  have n't you thought about making a level/wad for doom as jr did some time ago ? 
  your levels were rather remarkable , admire playing them even now . 
  olexandr came to the dressing room after the match against shakhtar ( 3:4 ) , hugged everyone : teammates , coaches , the stuff , the president of the club , and thanked everybody for all the years in the club . 
  `` everything has its ' beginning and the end . 
  my more than 20 years career is over now . 
  i was happy to defend the colors of the dynamo kyiv . 
  there were wins and loses in my career , both triumphs and failures . 
  i was happy all the time and now i have decided to retire . 
  it 's time to thank the club and the fans . 
  shovkovsky remains the only goalkeeper to keep the goals clean during the wc penalty shoot-out . 
  he has played in dynamo since 1993 and was a part of the squad , shined in europe alongside with shevchenko and rebrov . 
  are n't spoilers the path to the dark side ? 
  from that point of view seems that dv kills ` colleagues ' . 
  or is it a rule of ` there are only 2 of them ' ? 
  anyway , i try to avoid any chance to catch any kund of a spoiler before watching the movie . 
  that really hurts . 
  she will be always be in our hearts . 
  good night , leia . 
  rest in peace , carrie ... may the force be with you . 
   what is the difference between words '' \u043b\u044e\u0431\u043e\u0432 '' and '' \u043a\u043e\u0445\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044f '' ? 
    this question covers exactly the same ground as another question in this proposal, 
  more than a quarter of the century . 
  no relations , no coitus . 
  and i am too na\u00efve to subscribe to / r/sex /, 
  that is just great . 
  those permits , the halepa and the soviet anthem just make it even more adorable . 
  two ? 
  is n't it reasonable to teach python 3 ? 
  it is about 4.35 am here in kyiv now , but i am still waiting for it ( and yes , i have moved to stretch far-far ago ) . 
  even birds have already woken up and singing on the street . 
  the more we expect it the more tasty the cake becomes . 
  i have attended the tammeka vs narva trans match ( 2:1 ) in 2014 while living in tartu , and i have somewhat enjoyed it . 
  the league where people are more to play romantic football without big money and crowds . 
  it attracts , so i am following the league and cup supporting tammeka , but they are nit really pretending on something in league and have lost in the latest cup final to infonet ( aka fci tallinn during this champions league ), 
  so happy to see them together and on the field . 
  kluivert , rivaldo , ronaldinho , belleti , giuly ... the really enjoy the game like little kids with a ball . 
  that is so sweet, 
  i am glad he is too old to use magic outside of hogwarts, 
  are there checkboxes ? 
  the one might be born twice or more often ? 
  oh that road to kyiv . 
  the second year in a row this club eliminates the one from ukraine, 
  yeah , hard times for the football . 
  clubs to participate in the eutopean cups few years ago are in the 3rd tier now . 
  hope it will end some day . 
  but well , there are a lot of work to do and problems to face, 
  the most important distro nowadays , even just seeing the top on the distrowatch . 
  there are mostly debian and its derivatives in the top-10 , and i am happy using it for 7 years . 
  firstly as kubuntu , later as debian stable . 
  thanks , ian . 
  you will never be forgotten . 
  the yet another said thing he was not that old . 
  the pioneers pass away , but we will remember them forever . 
  so long , ache . 
  [ bash ] ( https://duckduckgo.com/?q=bash+cheat+sheet&amp;t=ffhp&amp;ia=cheatsheet&amp;iax=1 ) one works as well, 
  i am few months older than linux , and it was originally announced the next day after my country announced its independence . 
  so sweet and symbolic . 
  hope gnu/linux to spread further and further , it is worth it . 
  $ cowsay - f tux `` happy b-day . 
  thanks , linus '', 
  i will buy popcorn and wait for the rms comment on this, 
  like gwenview ? 
  i am not feeling victorious , just wondering . 
  it was always like that : gnome has the `` g '' , kde - `` k '' . 
  yakuake , rekonq and amarok also do n't start from k. dolphin , dragon do n't even have it . 
  k is the reference to the de . 
  neither in english nor in polish , but lots of relocation stories to poland can be found on the [ ukrainian dev community website ] ( https://dou.ua ) . 
  it is one of the most favorable relocation destinations nowadays ( and especially for it specialists ) , i have tried twice : in 2016 from april till july ( fj in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a ) and just now from july 2017 till at least october ( same company , different position ) . 
  i can say what i like and what bothers me . 
  i admire the traveling ( even within poland : wroc\u0142aw , krak\u00f3w , pozna\u0144 etc. ), 
  and its price . 
  i admire the stuff one can find in the supermarket , there are about 5 different in 2 km radius from apartment i rent , and the choice is better from the one in kyiv 's supermarkets in the place i live . 
  but as for me i am a bit pissed off the traffic lights . 
  they do n't have countdown timers and even if you press the signal button to cross the road - you can wait for few minutes .
