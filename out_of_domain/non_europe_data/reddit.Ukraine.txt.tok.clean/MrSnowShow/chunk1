but i do n't think it is that easy to take down big sites . 
  and they love gaben, 
  yes you 're right we are not haxors : /, 
  origin uplay so fucking annoying ... they do this to prevent pirates but pirates still get the games . 
  this stuff only messes with legit costumers  . , 
  why the fuck you post about them on this sub ? 
  unless you 're an adult you do n't want a gf . 
  just hand around with chicks casual stuff nothing serious thats what i do ...

  your dick is bigger than all of your mates - gf, 
  oblivion still better in terms of quests and story and npcs and dialogue, 
  4x60 = 240 $ wow awesome with 240 $ u get 20 good titles on steam :d, 
  open console , type in :, 
  showenchantment, 
  wow that is very generous, 
  take on choppers pls, 
  ring a ding ding baby, 
  can somebody explain me why the g43 gaming mobo ? 
  he forgot to explain that before installing gpu , in your case you have to remove those 2 white things before putting ur gpu into the pci e slot, 
  at 4:10 he 's talking about fov and saying that pc fov doens ' t look natural lol * facepalm *, 
  oh my fucking god you are fucking sick man get help, 
  move to [ r/oblivion ] ( http://reddit.com/r/oblivion ), 
  welcome to the master race, 
  killed because he 's an idiot xd, 
  summon dremora lord, 
  hit him once, 
  let dremora take care of him and walk away with style, 
  had to play the game on max difficulty because the combo of my 1st spell weakness to 3 elements and then 2nd spell dot of all 3 elements oneshot everything in 10ft :d, 
  i like how all cities have different personalities in oblivion and its hard to choose ... 
  - bruma with nord culture close to skyrim, 
  - leyawiin with swamp around kinda makes you think if that is what black marsh looks like, 
  - anvil with all stony buildings, 
  - skingrad with it 's misterious vampire count, 
  i do n't know ... maybe bruma for me , but i really like cloud ruler temple, 
  gpu : somekind of intel express chipset family shitty gpu xd, 
  hdd : 160 gb, 
  anything where gameforge is involved they just ruin it . 
  `` come on , i have n't got all morning '', 
  auroras, 
  you should stick to that build with fx 6300 and gtx 760 or an amd equivalent gpu . 
  its much better than the one you posted originally :d, 
  railroad you mean very linear with little to no choice at all ? 
  fucking consoles slowing down evolution of gaming - . -, 
  i do n't understand how a 1.6 ghz 8 core processor and an hd7850 can be called next gen, 
  hahahaha nice xd but i 'm on phone and it 's all slower and laggy . 
  `` do n't argue with stupid people , they will drag you down to their level and beat you with stupidity '' - ca n't remember who, 
  what about gigabyte mobos ? 
  peasantry flair is essential, 
  where can i get mousepads for 1 $ ? 
  radeon hd 7870 is minimum ( i think ? ), 
  so u can crush plebstation and peasantbox1, 
  wow thats amazing . 
  but whats your friend 's reason to sell it so cheap ? 
  show [ this ] ( http://30vs60fps.com ) to your peasant friends . 
  ppl posting builds of $ 600 with 770 ^ ^, 
  whats your cpu ? 
  it does n't bottleneck ? 
  nice build . 
  tho i do n't know if you really need the fx 6350 could just stick with fx 6300 and oc it when needed no ? 
  correct me if i 'm wrong but i think 6350 eats more power than 6300, 
  xbox1 is the biggest ripoff this gen. ps4 is more or less it 's good for casuals that do n't understand nothing about tech and do n't care . 
  but xbox1 is total shit $ 100 dollars more , fucking kinect , weaker gpu and all the restrictions cant even use ur own headset wtf microsoft, 
  if you can i would suggest hd 7870 over gtx 660, 
  edit : physx games gtx 660 and 7870 for non physx, 
  ** correct me if i 'm wrong **, 
  miners right ? 
  is it only a scanner or full antivirus like avira/avast/mse ... ? 
  ( i 'm on phone and googling is extremly slow and painful ), 
  steam is free unlike ps + and xlive and will save you aton of money, 
  nice one :d, 
  it 's an overkill to play 1080p with a $ 1800 pc . 
  should invest in 1440p . 
  how can one update bios if you cant use the cpu ? 
  [ show him this ] ( http://30vs60fps.com ), 
  why u need so much hdds ? 
  ancient dark brotherhood and nightingale chest . 
  you do n't need more . 
  i sometimes even run around with ** emperor 's robes ** . 
  as a sneak archer all you really need is a good bow armor doens ' t matter much . 
  do n't buy premade pcs, 
  the badass ** [ galmar stone-fist ] ( http://fc00.deviantart.net/fs71/i/2012/167/c/b/galmar_stone_fist_by_thedruginmeisyou00-d53o7y9.png ) **, 
  how much was the laptop ? 
  hmm i see ... building a computer is n't that hard and you 'll learn about pc parts in the process so definetly you should check it out when you have time . 
  you can build a nice pc that outperforms new gen consoles with 550 600 dollars . 
  a wrong idea that people have is ** omaigod to play gamez with gud grapheecs u must own da $ 3000 alienware pc **,
