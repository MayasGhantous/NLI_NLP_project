  http://pcpartpicker.com is an awesome tool that we use to make builds . 
  am i the only one that has a savefile that was created in 11/11/11 right before hadvar ask `` who are you ? '', 
  yes , i never enter caves because of that . 
  mouse and keyboard + the # 1 mod for skyrim : [ skyui ] ( http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/3863/ ? ), 
  / r/oblivion, 
  tes iv needs some love . 
  that actually sounds pretty badass . 
  i 'm sure in early may we will be getting new mods . 
  trust me . 
  what i mean is for people to stop with * omg skyrim looks gorgeous !!! 1 !!!! 1 ! 1 ! one ! 1 !!, 
  i 'm still waiting for the glorious day where aaa games fully support linux . 
  that we 'll be the best thing pc gaming could get . 
  the key point of linux is just like pcs over consoles : ** freedom ** ( murica ! ), 
  i 'm ukrainian and i confirm this . 
  in my country everyone who has a pc just pirates everything . 
  games , music , movies and have like 100 cds with all of those . 
  also some kids that understand more than others about pc will just do real piracy by selling those torrented games . 
  also the games that are sold on the stores most of them are just modded games and they call them `` new '' . 
  example : my friend 's grandmother sent him a gta : police madness ( in russian ) . 
  it was basically gta vice city deluxe with 9999999999 money , all missions passed and some new area with russian stuff . 
  i 'm surprised no one mentioned http://4chan.org/b/, 
  ncsoft is atleast much better than gameforge , you 're lucky americans . 
  we europeans suffer with gameforge alot . 
  well aion is much better in na ( ncsoft ) than in europe ( gameforge ) . 
  also tera is better in na ( enmasse ) than in europe ( gameforge again ), 
  can you tell me some shit that ncsoft has done ? 
  holy fucking shit !, 
  if you bough this for $ 1000 then you got ripped off . 
  * apu is a bad choice if you 're using a dedicated graphics card, 
  * overkill ram and psu, 
  * weak gpu, 
  for $ 1000 you could get a 780 build . 
  what was the problem with ncsoft aion ? 
  gameforge 's eu version was alwaya late in patches and fucking goldpack bullshit . 
  i 'm level 44 at eu tera . 
  what am i missing ? 
  i feel like the game is too much grindy . 
  it is the same in na ? 
  * do n't know about the favorite thingy . 
  open your inventory , mouse over to the item that you want , press f. 
  * ~ ~ to install a mod , you need to copy the files to the / data folder and activate them in the launcher  data files ~ ~ but ignore this , since you 're new to pc you can install nexus mod manager and you can activate/deactivate mods with a single click . 
  i personally ca n't help you much with it because i install my mods manually . 
  * do n't be afraid to experiment . 
  you are on a pc , the possibilites are endless and you will learn alot in the process . 
  * use the search function of reddit and google stuff . 
  it gets tiresome to see the same questions everyday . 
  do n't forget to install [ skyui ] ( http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/3863/ ? ), 
  to get rid of the stupid console ui and get the pc specific one . 
  it has has mcm ( mod configuration menu ) that alot of mods use for easy config . 
  lucien mothafuckin lachance is forever in our hearts . 
   ah , i really doubt it , i have seen some amazing things that only a $ 2500 + computer would be able to achieve, 
  okay , this troubles me . 
  i think you bough a prebuilt . 
  a $ 1000 built computer is able to handle skyrim with a fuckton of graphic mods since a $ 1000 build is a gtx 770-780 or r9 290 290x, 
  a $ 2500 is just a huge overkill for skyrim . 
  holy shit how much u play per day ? 
  well maybe i 'm just a bit lazy but in dcuo for example leveling is a blast . 
  while in tera i keep doing the same quests over and over with little to none variation . 
  * do quests in an area, 
  * last quest of that area sends you to another area, 
  * do quests in the new area, 
  rinse and repeat . 
  holy shit the cpu and gpu are expensive as fuck in bulgaria . 
  i ca n't believe this , another cod . 
  ghost just got released a couple of months ago and there 's already a new cod ? 
  i never played cod and this makes me want to play it even less . 
  when the competition starts ? 
  well you do whatever you want , it 's your game . 
  but personally why the fuck would anyone want to play with a slut character in a video game and use nude mods just to stare at her body ? 
  those mods make me sick . 
  i had those written by hand . 
  then i really must decide if i continue level my sorc , warrior or slayer . 
  a week or two ? 
  wow that 's fast . 
  i level in tera by picking every quest in every area i come across during campaign quests . 
  is this the right way to level ? 
  i guess for my first 60 i 'll just fo every quest and explore every area like i 'm doing atm . 
  then for my alt i just search for faster grinding . 
  i have a question , like a year ago or more i was playing and i always heard about conjunct and fraywind gear . 
  you did n't mention those . 
  are they outdated and useless ? 
  do n't go past 6 so you can always have your right hand on your mouse, 
  * 1 2 3 4 5 ( 6 if you can ), 
  * shift + 1 2 3 4 5 ( 6 if you can ), 
  * shift + left click , right click , middle click, 
  * keys around the wasd for important skills . 
  if you want to keep the original keys just use shift . 
  because t is for enchanting , r is for whisper reply , q is for marking targets and e is for party quick messages , f is for interact ... etc, 
  * if you need you can also use ctrl and alt for even more shortcuts . 
  also ( atleast for me ) keeping a logical decision behind keybinds helps . 
  for example : my sorcerer has c for backstep and shift + c for teleport jaunt . 
  logic is that c is my escape key . 
  so i need conjunct then . 
  what about fraywind ? 
  oh , and is there any new set coming in the reaper patch ? 
  you guys should also mention this which in my opinion is a great argument :, 
  * peasants probably already have a computer for school/word processing/work/e-mail / internet browsing/etc . 
  so basically their costs is a console ( ** 500 $ ** ) + pc ( let 's assume its a ** 500 $ ** too ) so this is ** 1000 $ ** with no games . 
  for 1000 $ you can make a fucking beast of a battlestation which is like 3x more powerful than consoles and still use the same money . 
  or you can do a 600 $ budget build and save 400 $ .
