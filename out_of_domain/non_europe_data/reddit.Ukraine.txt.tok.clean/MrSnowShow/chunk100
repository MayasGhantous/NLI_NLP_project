  and it is actually about * thieving * . 
  unlike skyrim where you do a few thieving related quests and after the `` twist '' it 's no longer about thieving . 
  sure you got those jobs from delvin and vex but you steal `` fake '' stuff that spawns just for the quest , in oblivion on the other hand you have to break into real stores and steal real shit . 
  also i hated the whole `` everything is a shadow of it 's former self '' , it feels like bethesda went full lazy and used that as an excuse to not develop guilds further . 
  in oblivion the fighters guild is firmly established and respected through all cyrodiil , same with mages guild and they even have the arcane university . 
  thieves guild is also feared and dark brotherhood even more . 
  this is so nice to read . 
  you know that one thing that you find really amazing and when you recommend to people but they ca n't really get into it and miss out on a really amazing thing and you feel sad about them ? 
  and this however is that you managed to keep going and eventually realized how fucking amazing oblivion is . 
  consistenty , that was the desciption that i missed when thinking about for example seeing huni or soaz dominate a game and yet i still did n't ` believe ' in them . 
  players like ( as you said ) niels , bjergsen , febiven those guys no matter how badly they 're loosing they are still relevant in the game, 
  it 's a play on the [ event horizon ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/event_horizon ) phenomenon, 
  it was the 3rd game of final vs clg on vlad, 
  definitely . 
  i love this idea of naming moves after players , some of them on top of my head :, 
  + pulling an insec - with lee sin connect a q , place a ward behind , dash to it and kick enemy back to the team, 
  + pulling a misaya - ulting with tf into middle of team and use zhonya, 
  + pulling an xpeke - backdooring, 
  + pulling a reginald - locking wrong card on tf, 
  + pulling a saintvicious - getting outsmited, 
  and now, 
  + pulling a soaz - overextending and when caught just teleport away, 
  reminded me of wolf from skt t1 at worlds, 
  thinkpad line does not have it, 
  do n't do it . 
  stickers 99 % of time just ruin the product and people who know their shit do n't need attention whoring `` im so nerdy xddd '', 
  those back , forward and home buttons look like win xp era, 
  russian is just so good to listen to , people can really use their creativity to fuck around with words making it very entertaining to listen to . 
  msi 2015 febiven 1v1 faker , twice . 
  never forget, 
   what is this where are all the pictures, 
  oh god , does he also still read [ these kind ] ( http://i00.i.aliimg.com/img/pb/506/281/517/517281506_492.jpg ) of books ? 
  just a formatting tip , because your post looks like a big unreadable wall of text, 
  in reddit to make a new paragraph you must press enter twice [ enter ], 
  [ enter ], 
  like this, 
  you will probably not like at first a lot of songs , but after some time you will love them . 
  happened to me with vicarious , 10,000 days , rosetta stoned , third eye , pushit , sober ... at the moment i do n't like much the disposition/reflection/triad trio but i know that in time something just clicks and i start to love it . 
  now if only niels went instead of rekkles ... 
  why ? 
  the korean slayers , 2-0 both azubus never forget ... 
  ~ ~ well ... ~ ~, 
  ~ ~ og amazing ~ ~, 
  ~ ~ froggen ( forgot his team ) ~ ~, 
  edit : i fucked up, 
  oh i see , thanks for the explanation, 
  i like him but judging from worlds , his performance was not as good as it used to be while niels was a fucking monster . 
  and just imagine a solo q challenger player to all stars in one season would be really good to him and i think he deserves it more . 
  really wish the assassin meta came back and thus zed because this champion has so much outplay potential and creates great show . 
  i like your youtube name and tool fans do too, 
  ** why thinkpad ? 
  * they 're really cheap when you buy a used one, 
  * splash-proof keyboard thanks to drainage holes . 
  * keyboards feel excellent while typing , yes even the new ones . 
  * great durability , your data is what it protects most , if it happens to be thrown out of a tall building or run over by a truck . 
  the casing will deal with daily wear and tear like it 's nothing . 
  * utilitarian design , stuff like indicator leds , great keyboard key layout ( on x220 , t420 models and earlier ), 
  * docking solutions that easily turns your laptop into a desktop ( not performance wise of course ! ), 
  just sitting it down, 
  * easy to repair , upgrade and maintain thanks to readily available hardware maintenance manuals for almost every model and spare parts are easy and cheap to obtain, 
  * trackpoint ( that red thing on the middle of the keyboard ) , great for those who type a lot or hate swiping their fingers all over a touchpad . 
  works surprisingly well for first person games , if you 're into that .

   ugly laptops, 
  so you call yourself a geek and ca n't even appreciate beautiful ibm design that lasted for over a decade ? 
  funny because i have n't played lol since ending of season 3 ( over 2 years ago ) however i recently subscribed because i love the e-sports scene . 
  you need to use a backslash on the \\ ^ so that reddit formatting knows you want to type the literal \\ ^ and not super ^ script, 
  so ... it seems voat is pretty much a clone of reddit without any new features , am i missing something ? 
  well reddit does not silence unpopular opinions , it 's all in the users ... 
  to be fair back then riot tagged vayne as an assassin in champion description and i played her since level 1 with that in mind . 
  and yes i used to just walk around the enemy team and assassinate the adc . 
  1st year of cs , we learned about memory , flips flops , resets and shit but i for some fucking reason can not understand it ... 
  i wish i could appreciate this but fucking digital circuits are not for me i guess ... 
  reddit does not allow url shorteners so your comment was caught in the spam filter,

  the ` mini ' dlcs which are, 
  * fighter 's stronghold ( a cool place aimed for warriors ), 
  * wizard 's tower ( same thing but for mages ), 
  * thieves den, 
  * horse armour ( this one as you mentioned gets a lot of critics ), 
  are ** not ** available in any ps3 version . 
  also beware that there 's a serious glitch in the ps3 goty edition where you ca n't complete the vampire cure quest thus if you become a vampire there 's no going back . 
  both european and american versions have this glitch but the european version however has a workaround while north american version does not . 
  just a little tip ,, 
  do n't post torrent links in reddit comments . 
  it 's kinda like an unofficial rule that everybody follows, 
  i 'm not butthurt , i do think torrenting is a great freedom to have but i was just saying to you that here in reddit people generally downvote and talk down when torrents are mentioned especially links to them . 
  it may be so , but generally nmm is not well supported on oblivion so it is not recommended here . 
  sad thing is that newer laptops will never get libreboot because of intel management engine or whatever it is called . 
  i used to hate it when listening to undertow and be like `` why the fuck would they waste 15 minutes in this bullshit track and just 1/4 is music and rest is silence like wtf ? '', 
  but then one time i just listened to it and it ` clicked ' and it 's awesome . 
  it pretty much happens to every tool song that i dislike , and then at one point it just clicks and suddenly it 's one of the best songs . 
  agreed , maynard does some intense screams, 
  yeah a lot of people do n't need a lot of power on a computer especially a laptop which are much more common now . 
  3w on full load hell yeah,
