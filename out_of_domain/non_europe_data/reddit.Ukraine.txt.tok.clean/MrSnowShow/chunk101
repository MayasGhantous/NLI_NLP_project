  i 'm gon na lose my fucking job over this !, 
   be confident, 
  this is a good general advice , however i noticed that a classmate of mine in these last days tried to talk more confidently but it was way too forced , you could see how uncomfortable he was and it was more awkward than just him being that awkward dude he was before . 
  niels would play much better kalista, 
  so why does dash has his hair like that ? 
  / r/outoftheloop please, 
  yeah he 's nice . 
  but i get the feeling that is n't that good anymore as he once was back then we he could n't participate in lcs and played in challenger series and stuff like that . 
  same thing with snoopeh , he was a nice , and overall awesome personality in the lcs ( [ get fit with snoopeh ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adfuttmsjjm ) ) but sadly he was n't as good especially when playing with eg . 
  faker is more about kills though ... he managed to pop egg twice, 
  this was my dream allstar team ... niels deserves it much more, 
  btw i 've been looking into the schedule and did n't find any lck vs na why ? 
  a little history lesson, 
  the current design is the 2nd version ( mine was 1st ) made by the godly / u/minsctheranger , though he went inactive without any warning ( rip and good luck , wherever you may be ) and / u/bertolotti kicked him for some reason . 
  it does n't seem that he will come back so we 'll just keep this one . 
  edit : i was planning to do some `` cleaning '' on the stylesheet but now i do n't have much time with university exams, 
  i feel kinda the same with the `` add new stuff '' kind of mods , it just does n't feel right . 
  however i really enjoy those minor mods that make tiny adjustments that make a big change in the gameplay ( pretty much the [ utilities , minor changes ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/wiki/index/mods#wiki_utilities.2c_minor_changes ) category of our mods list ) . 
  those kind of mods is what makes me enjoy modded oblivion so much . 
  a little fix there , a slight adjustment over here , removing/changing an annoying mechanic and suddenly you got yourself a much better game and can never go back to vanilla . 
  had a smile during whole game . 
  definitely was the funnest one to watch and it was nice because i originally did n't think it would be as fun to watch as it was . 
  eu midlaner beat a korean adc main with ad carries . 
  impressive, 
  in his heart he 's european, 
  why would you spoil it ? 
  it was n't made by bethesda though . 
  morrowind , oblivion and skyrim were all made by bethesda and i 'm pretty sure they wo n't be making mmos . 
  eso on the other hand was not made by them , they simply allowed zenimax to do it . 
  i think the problem is that reddit is getting more and more mobile users and even though there is a sidebar button in every reddit app you still need to make a conscious decision to read the sidebar and a lot of people just do n't do it, 
  the reason is simple , it was not made by bethesda . 
  i think it is the same reason reason why i liked fallout 3 more than new vegas , simply fo3 was made by bethesda and fnv was not . 
  however , fnv was made by a lot of people who made fo1 and fo2 so generally people who played 1 and 2 liked fnv more . 
  this is receiving reports of not related to oblivion , and it is true . 
  however there 's a bit of discussion going on in the comments so maybe we let this slide ? 
  but please in future if you want to post some image that does not directly relate to oblivion do it in a self post and add some oblivion relation to it . 
  i did get it too but i 'm just saying that are some reports from users of not enough oblivion related, 
  [ i remember my game more like this ] ( https://markcz.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/screenshot1.png ), 
  i was running oldblivion , 640x480 , everything on low , everything in oldblivion settings also on low and yet it would crash if there was too much action on the screen . 
  it made the last quest almost impossible to do and i had to be looking at the ground all the time to avoid crashing . 
  custom always, 
  depends on your playstyle , but since all premade classes are kinda shitty it does n't really matter, 
  you do n't need to rush the main quest , if you travel around the cities you will find very interesting quests, 
  also about the difficulty slider , do n't be ashamed to turning down the difficulty slider if you 're having problems and vice versa if you do n't feel any challenge . 
  think of the `` difficulty '' slider more as `` balance to make game fun '' slider since oblivion sadly is fairly unbalanced as levels go on . 
  do you remember what was your 1st custom class ? 
   i do realize now that i need to spread the major/minor skills out more with like only one from each attribute . 
  is that right ? 
  yes , if you want to do [ efficient leveling ] ( http://www.uesp.net/wiki/oblivion:efficient_leveling ) but since you 're new you better just enjoy the game playing without guides because that 1st `` lost '' experience is the best when playing games . 
   also , do you only level up after sleeping ? 
  i have n't quite picked up on just what the stat requirements are for going up a level . 
  you level up after increasing 10 times any combination of your major skills , after that you get an icon near your compass and at that point you need to sleep and you can distribute 3 points into your stats/attributes . 
  [ you can also get a bonus ] ( http://i915.photobucket.com/albums/ac358/the_zink/oblivion2009-12-2319-56-12-27.jpg ) of +2 , +3 , +4 and +5 to an attribute depending on how many skill level ups you did related to that attribute . 
  ( oblivion calls it `` governing '' skills of an attribute , so for example block , heavy armor and armorer are governing skills of endurance ), 
  ( since you touched the topic of efficient leveling , i 'll ** try ** to explain it anyway in a simple way ), 
  the ideal setup you imagine is each level up gaining +5 to 3 of stats you 're increasing , but in order to get a +5 bonus you need to level up any combination of skills 10 times related to that attribute ( example : endurance is related to armorer , heavy armor and block , so in order to get a +5 bonus to endurance on level up you need to level a combination of those 3 skills 10 times ) . 
  what you want basically is to be able to control your leveling so that when you do level up , you have leveled up all the skills necessary to get a +5 bonus to 3 of the attributes you 're planning to put a point into . 
  which ironically leads to for example if you 're a mage to not have all the magic skills as your majors because you 'll be leveling too fast ( since you 're using magic all the time ) and not getting enough level ups of skills to get the +5 bonus . 
  ( remember that you level up after leveling up 10 times any combination of major skills , but in order to get +5 bonus on 3 attributes you need a minimum of 30 skill level ups ), 
  edit : but once again since you 're new you better just be enjoying the game with the slider turned down when needed . 
  yes , i think it was a time where most europeans were going to sleep . 
  it 's just sad . 
  so they resort to make fake stories so others can vicariously enjoy them, 
  dude where is your cigarette and \u041e\u0431\u043e\u043b\u043e\u043d\u044c ( obolon ) beer ? 
  dv6 are literally hell . 
  had one for like 5,5 years , it went multiple times to manufacturer for repairs . 
  it died though but it was my fault , i was on linux and was running a bare bones arch install with no power management and i let it multiple times totally run out of battery and one time it just did n't turn on , fried a bunch of mobo chips, 
  well , it raises some issues for example if steam hypothetically goes down you 'll no longer have access to your games despite you `` owning '' them . 
  english, 
  a note on ctd when exiting game ,, 
  it happens when you have a few mods , it is particularly annoying because if you change your settings they wont be saved since oblivion crashes on exit . 
  you can use fast exit to fix it or use oblivion stutter remover since it is more updated and also included fast exit . 
  if i recall correctly you only need to close 3 oblivion gates , the kvatch one , the one near bruma and the big one also near bruma . 
  before closing the big gate near bruma you get an ** optional ** quest `` allies for bruma '' to get help from all the cities but they ask you to close an oblivion gate nearby , so that is why you probably remember it as a chore but once again it is optional . 
  should the natural environments be moved to unrealiable mods section in the wiki then ? 
  a bit sad too because it was literally one of the first big successful mods , it came like a month after oblivion was released . 
  if you wanted to explore cyrodiil without oblivion gates then you should have just delivered the amulet to jauffre and just never visit kvatch . 
  the oblivion gates start to randomly appear ~ ~ after you first contact with them which is in kvatch ~ ~ after delivering martin , so if you do n't visit kvatch you 'll have a gate-free cyrodiil . 
  fixed it , it has been a long time since i played, 
  well he 's inactive so i doubt it will do something . 
  but what 's up with you ? 
  you disappear randomly and then appear out of nowhere, 
  look at his post history , he 's been spamming / r/skyrim with individual posts instead of an album, 
  thanks bro , i 'm gon na need it a lot, 
  frontier is just an amazing area especially when snowy . 
  the combat in my opinion is the best and the most immersive . 
  what i mean by this is that every attack has a sense of weight , you basically can `` feel '' how hard you just cut/smacked that guy , it 's so damn fluid and the animations are top notch too . 
  to give you an idea fire up any assassin 's creed ( not sure for unity or syndicate because i have n't played those ) , choose hidden blades and open them up a few times , now go do the same in ac3 . 
  in my opinion the opening of blades in ac3 is so well done that you can almost `` feel '' it how fast and intense that blade opening is . 
  it is one of those things that when done correctly make a huge difference , the animations , the sound effects and brutalness make ac3 combat one of the best experiences for me . 
  basically the [ ac3 frontier gameplay demo ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzrkley9ohq ) describes perfectly what i 'm talking about starting more at 3:40, 
   nmm, 
  if somebody is using nmm the first thing recommended here is to stop using it . 
  think of the difficulty slider not as `` difficulty '' but as `` balance '' instead . 
  since oblivion leveling is pretty much a backwards ass clusterfuck , there 's no shame in adjusting the slider to balance it out . 
  definitely . 
  oblivion is a 9.5 year old game let 's not forget that . 
  although you have what is called an integrated graphics ( igpu for short ) , you will not have any problems whatsoever playing oblivion because that igpu is modern and beats many older dedicated graphics cards . 
  not everybody has a uefi system, 
  do n't like that terminal background,
