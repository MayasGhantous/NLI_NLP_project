  however , the overall fallout theme is for more mature audiences while elder scrolls is more accessible to younger gamers, 
  because not everyone can make money by giving pretty much the same speech over and over again . 
  i do n't like doing it on girls from the same class or even school/uni unless i 'm 100 % sure she will accept because if she does not then i will have to see her constantly and if i wanted her friend too then it would be awkward .

  the saying is among the lines of `` girls do n't like ass lickers/kissers '' and this guy is almost literally doing that .

  why would you post a link to the imgur site instead of directly to the image ?

  i saw that movie many times and ca n't seem to remember where ... 
  i mean do n't you adjust your volume as multiples of 5 ? 
  like 10 , 15 , 20 , 25 , etc. . . 
  i rage internally when i see someone put the volume at something like 33 or 27, 
  especially dat combat, 
  ac1 has that real `` assassin '' vibe . 
  what i mean is that you 're an actual assassin instead of a more `` knight '' in the ezio games with epic armors , 15 potions , 25 knives and crossbow shots , etc. . . 
  also has that `` assassin '' vibe because literally all your main missions are to actually assassinate someone . 
  acr i believe had the biggest deviation of doing actual assassin shit . 
  i 'm not sure if i was just new to the series or a retarded kid or perhaps a bit of both but in ac1 when too much guards ( especially those big ones ) came i had to fucking run for my life or else i 'm dead for sure . 
  other ac games it was always kill without breaking a sweat . 
  acr was saved by the altair parts in my opinion, 
   wireless : broadcom, 
  oh god . 
  also ,, 
  i just hope it will at least in future be compatible with a generic kernel without any additional bullshit . 
  when we want a laptop with linux support we 're not talking about one where the company just comes up with half assed ` hacks ' and puts a shiny ` linux compatible ' sticker . 
  we want a laptop that everything will work on a generic kernel so we can install any distro on it . 
  anything with magic i guess . 
  unlike skyrim , in oblivion it is pointless to go full magic without any melee fighting because your spell casting is an idependent thing and is not influenced by the weapon you 're wielding which makes playing two-handed or archer mages much more enjoyable than in skyrim . 
  ( i personally love my dual wielding katana robed mages ) . 
  once you level up your destruction , get enough money and mana you will be able to one shot pretty much everything by mixing up with a weakness spell before hitting you powerful one ( friendly tip : damage over time is fucking amazing ) . 
  so what you 'll end up doing is cracking that difficulty up instead of down for most cases . 
  i still rewatch it sometimes , that and ac2 and acb openings . 
  hmm nice , i never though about this . 
  i always used 2 spells , one weakness and another damage , in the late game weapons are pretty much useless so i was a bit forced to use weapons just for the role-play aspect but doing the enchant weakness combo is a nice way to keep weapons relevant . 
  it 's a nice play for vacation but has big problem with employment and all the young people are immigrating because you get shit pay with a degree . 
  it 's nice , they kinda like built their own little comfy kingdom in the middle of eu, 
  this is why i have n't set up my mail app yet , it would drive me insane . 
  i love my plain black , grey or white v neck t-shirts . 
  i just remembered [ this gif ] ( https://i.warosu.org/data/g/img/0501/24/1441555111839.gif ) existed . 
  why suddenly everybody stopped talking about tbp and moved to kas ? 
  `` gaming '' hardware is generally disgusting overpriced shit aimed at 15 year olds . 
  every time i see a `` gaming '' prefix on hardware it just makes me want to puke, 
   can automatically know a person is smart by making a linux joke and seeing who chuckles . 
  yeah , because installing a linux distro automatically makes you smart ... 
  one issue i 'm having with my x220 ( and i believe the same happens with the t420 ) is that for some reason whenever playing video it stats using 100 % of the gpu or something , killing the battery life in process . 
  somebody on / tpg / posted a solution to this but i forgot to check it out : /, 
  i know they may be better than generic mouses but the aesthetics designed to make 15 year olds cum with a bunch of epik gaymer l3ds juts kills it for me, 
  [ this thing ] ( http://webwit.nl/input/kbsim/img/modelm_4.jpg ) is sexier . 
  yeah , i basically kill them in all possible combinations and talk to the survivors in between kills to get all the possible dialogues . 
  i remember on my first playthough i literally talked to every npc multiple times and picked every topic . 
  for some reason i really liked the lore and wanted to know every detail . 
  my favorites to listen to were jauffre and martin because they had always things to say about the oblivion crisis . 
  i remember scrolling through topics countless times repeatedly just to make sure i did n't miss any dialogue , i 'm pretty sure every conversation topic of every npc i met was gray . 
  also arena and dark brotherhood < 3, 
  mainstream things are always hated so it 's no surprise . 
  not here , but in other places arch also gets hate for being a `` choose your own de by a command line interface '' and does not offer real choice ( systemd , glibc , etc. . . ) basically a pseudo `` hardcore '' distro while in reality it is n't . 
  / u/i _ eat_poop_ama already explained but i think it was also because most of us were kids when we played gta vc and sa and it was hard for us to do those missions where a little bit more accuracy and timing were needed . 
  [ you are not ready for this ] ( http://bigkneelover.deviantart.com/gallery/ ), 
  i have intermission as my ringtone though ... 
  jedi academy and jedi outcast, 
  the rift, 
  it 's just beautiful, 
  both can reach the armor cap later in the game so it 's mostly personal preference, 
  they do n't want to help those who just want to be spoonfed . 
  if you show that you 've tried many different approaches and post needed info related to the problem then people get help . 
  i really liked how in the gentoo handbook it teaches you about whatever you 're doing . 
  for example when partitioning in arch wiki it says, 
   if you have bios then do these commands and if uefi then do these instead, 
  gentoo handbook is more like this :, 
   ok , now it 's time to partition . 
  first you need to figure out what partition table to use , options are mbr [ explains it ] and gpt [ explains it too and then proceeds to explain the differences and in which cases you might use one or the other ], 
  this way it makes you learn a bit more about what you 're doing . 
  even if you 're not installing gentoo , reading the handbook is very interesting . 
  this is what your mentality should be when dealing with any errors . 
  i had people not know what to do when the error says `` please remove [ file ] '' because for some retarded reason when they see the word `` error '' their brain automatically ignores the rest of the text . 
  install real arch, 
  i hate openbox config files . 
  xml are you serious ... ? 
  mods inactive, 
  so he actually did it ... 
  i 'd kill myself too . 
  just kidding . 
  if you 're wondering what happened , basically ian went nuts on twitter , threatening to suicide and ranting about the police , everyone though someone hacked into his twitter because his style of typing was completely different . 
  apparently he really did suicide , but it 's hard to believe it was him that day . 
  [ here 's a pastebin of his tweets before his account went down ] ( http://pastebin.com/yk8bgru5 ) ( read from bottom to top ), 
  edit : i believe something shady is going on, 
  once i got my first thinkpad i immediately started using the clitmouse and never went back , like you own a thinkpad and you 're not even using the most signature feature of it . 
  also you can practice orgasming a girl while computing, 
  i have no idea , there are conspiracy theories going on though because his `` suicide '' was very weird and those tweets did n't seem like him .
