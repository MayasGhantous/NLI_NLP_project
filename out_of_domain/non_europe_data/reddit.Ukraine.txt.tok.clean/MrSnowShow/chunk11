  so for less money , you get all-in-one machine where you can do all your web browsing/word documents/school shit/music making/video edition/chatting/skyping / teamspeaking/etc . 
  and if you go console for games + crap pc for basic stuff you get shit gaming and shit pc for more money . 
  so i guess their * it 's cheaper * argument is totally invalid . 
  despite being rude , i must agree with him about ps4 vs xbox , seriously :, 
  better performance ( alot of games xbox runs 720p while ps4 runs 1080p ), 
  ps4 requires subscription to play online but you can still use apps that require internet without subscription , while to use internet you need to pay on xbox ( confirmation needed ), 
  xbox console bans , are you fucking serious ? 
  xbox : you want to use your headset ? 
  $ 25 please, 
  xbox : fucking camera . 
  you can buy a camera ** if u want ** on ps4, 
  oh and remember when xbox was announced with all the restrictive shit like activation codes on every game , need to be always connected to internet and camera always on ? 
  it was obvious that microsoft just trying to scam people but they failed so we know that they do n't care about costumers . 
  and the last one and the biggest : ** costs 100 $ less **, 
  so basically you have a better performing potato with less restrictive bullshit for ** less money . 
  ** i do n't even know how can someone even ** think ** of buying a xbox one . 
  ps : i still hate both potatoes . 
  i game only on the true open free of scams platform : ** pc **, 
  have you tried dc universe online ? 
  no :( tell me about it, 
  it 's for xbone right ? 
  i remember it now . 
  did you read his diary ? 
  he says that he escaped the same way as the hero of kvatch . 
  you ca n't go anywhere outside cyrodiil . 
  i used to run on my pentium 4 with no dedicated gpu using ** oldblivion **, 
  staring at the blades and wondering if i will get the bonus again . 
  try * fortify speed 100 pts for x seconds on target * and cast it on shadowmere and ride it . 
  ** do it . 
  mind telling what specs ? 
  oh and you built it yourself right ? 
  then there 's also a dayz ripoff for xbone its hilarious, 
  i 'm new to crunchbang and linux in general . 
  how do i change the color of when i highlight something ? 
  crunchbang uses 100mb when nothing is on . 
  you are time traveling right now . 
  1 second per second . 
  but according to special relativity : the faster you travel through space , the slower you travel through time . 
  at the speed of light time stops for you . 
  and if you go more than speed of light you will , by theory , go back in time . 
  but according to einstein ( i think ) it is impossible to reach the speed of light because of your mass . 
  something with mass will never reach the speed of light . 
  so if by `` time travel '' you mean going back in time , then no , you ca n't . 
  and a crappy 400w psu, 
  but according to einstein ** e = mc ^ 2 **, 
  this means that mass = energy , but a tiny bit of mass contains alot of energy and alot of energy is necessary for just a little bit of mass since the constant is c ^ 2 . 
  this may sound incredibly dumb but if we somehow could transform all of our mass to energy then we could travel at * c * ( speed of light ) and then somehow convert back to mass with the same properties then we might have a chance . 
  disclaimer : do n't take this seriously because i 'm still in high school and have much to learn . 
  i 'm on phone right now . 
  is nexus 5 from htc ? 
  are there any good nexuses with 4 inch screen ? 
  you forgot to mention that mods make the games age in reversal . 
  skyrim , a 2,5 year old game , is in top 10 played or w/e on steam because of mods . 
  and also the rest of top played games are basically heavy mod influenced or once were mods ( dota 2 , counter-strike ), 
  nightforge then will probably be esier to get since it may be needed to craft new t15 . 
  as a sorc that just reached 48 all i can say is that pre 48 sorc is not the real sorc . 
  after reaching 48 it became incredibly fun for me to play especially at instances and bams . 
  and no , their dps is not lower than warrior 's , all dpss are viable in tera . 
  but with sorc after 48 you will go from normal dps to fucking amazing top dps nuker beast along with zerkers . 
  but in tera you can create a char and play at level 20 just to try it out while having some skills . 
  so go ahead , but the real sorc is at 48 . 
  you will find the funnest class by yourself and it depends also on the game , for example in aion i loved playing a tank despite hating sword and shield , because in aion you can use 2 weapons and i used a greatsword most of the time . 
  but in tera i hate tanks . 
  arent sorcs also top dps along with zerks after 48 ? 
  is n't it awesome how in tera you can simply choose a class that you like and do n't worry about realising later that it is n't viable, 
  we can get a 7850 , underclock it and boom !, 
  there is the ps4 gpu, 
  daamn that 's so true . 
  is n't being a pc owner and having endless possibilites awesome ... 
  failforge is a bad company . 
  you will basically pay almost x10 more for anything in the market . 
  i 'm not kidding , there was a post a couple of days ago where 2 things costed 60 $ - ish while in na it costed 7 $ . 
  it 's not really that diferent . 
  ocassional pker here and there . 
  but nothing gamebreaking . 
  i 've always played on pvp servers because the adrenaline is awesome when u run away or fight that pker ^ or ^ even ^ pk ^ yourself, 
  it 's sad how this game is a huge grindfest with the same quests over and over and over and over . 
  my only motivation to play is the awesome combat ( manual aiming ) . 
  this is the game basically :, 
  pick up a main quest in the town and a normal quest , they both send you to a camp . 
  after you arrive at the camp , you have 6 quests waiting for you to do in that area . 
  the main quest sends you to another area but you do n't go there because you finish the 6 quests . 
  finish all quests in that area and receive last quest that tells you to go to another area where the main quest already pointed out . 
  add some ocasional dungeons and instances and there you have basically 95 % of what you do to level up . 
  what is your class ? 
  i 'm playing sorc and i sometimes die vs bams . 
  but when i manage to kill them the rewarding feeling is worth it . 
  just take off your crystals . 
  why not pc ? 
  all hail the red team !, 
  what about crunchbang ? 
  i 'm using it because i wanted a lightweigh distro just to try out playing around in terminal . 
  can i do stuff in crunchbang like you do in arch ? 
  htc one is like around 58 % more expensive, 
  i though warriors had better backstab combos ... 
  gamepad on tera ? 
  jesus christ ... how will you aim ? 
  so i guess then warrior is better in duels right ? 
  still keyboard and mouse offer much better accuracy, 
  fuck warriors and slayers .
