   but it has to hit a living target in order to expand out to its aoe . 
  holy shit . 
  this means that my multi element spell, 
  * shock 50 pts for 3 seconds in 10 ft area, 
  * fire 50 pts for 3 seconds in 10 ft area, 
  * frost 50 pts for 3 seconds in 10 ft area, 
  was only doing 2/3 ( fire and frost ) damage whenever i aimed at ground to hit multiple enemies , which was pretty much  90 % of the time . 
  yes it had shock animation . 
   cast shock ( or any spell in which shock is the dominant element and the animation used ) into a wall or floor and it just vanishes . 
  fire , on the other hand , explodes when it hits walls or floors . 
  weird . 
  mine definitely damages everything nearby when i aim it at the ground . 
  do you have unofficial patches ? 
   is your magic modded ? 
  as near as i can figure it , the magicka cost for that in the vanilla game would be about 3000 points . 
  no , it 's vanilla . 
  i had 500ish magicka and the spell would leave me almost empty so the cost was around 470-480 . 
  i had 100 in destruction and all attributes except luck . 
  it works as both on linux though ... 
  how 's the battery life ? 
  i heard of this thing called ` apmd ` is it sort of a tlp equivalent ? 
  because it has a whole company backing it up while debian is and probably will always be community driven . 
  and you only run ` apmd ` as power manager ? 
  i though the heat from being always charged at 100 % would damage the cells . 
  what about unplugging the battery once it reaches 100 % ? 
   if i 'm willing to spend 1k on a new laptop, 
  but you do n't need to spend 1k on a laptop . 
  sandy/ivy bridge which you can get for 150-300 dollarios ( depending on your luck ) is more than enough for uni . 
  no , the only guilds available are the mages , fighters and thieves . 
  you need to press enter twice between lines [ enter ], 
  [ enter ], 
  like this, 
  my problem is no h264 hardware decoding , atleast on i915 ( intel open-source drivers ), 
  i read on hn or slashdot somebody explaining this in detail . 
  all the high executives are getting a shitton of money , use chrome and basically do not give a flying shit or a fuck about firefox . 
  leave that place for your own good . 
  why would we need 10bit if that article says human eye can see around 7-10 million and 8 bit already provides almost 16.8 million, 
  nice , do you have any idea of the power consumption in wattage ? 
  on linux i generally get around 8w idle and 11w while browsing and other stuff . 
  [ this is one of the top posts here which pretty much sums it up ] ( https://i.imgur.com/6vxdtsz.jpg ), 
  what about putting the battery to 100 % and unplugging it and only plug when i need the portability ? 
  because it 's just some grill attention whoring with her shitty 10 line shitpost `` meme '' . 
  thank god i unsubscribed from that shithole of a sub . 
  what an entitled cunt honestly , he did not create `` pcmasterrace '' , he simply saw it as a joke on / r/gaming and decided to be the one to create the sub . 
  if he did n't do it probably hours later somebody else would and i 'm pretty sure that person would not use a fucking `` creator '' permaflair . 
  i had to disable it on my x220 because i did n't like the little green led . 
  do you have the thinkvantage fingerprint software installed ? 
  all you have to do is check a box there . 
  yep , i love the uniqueness of the x300/1 but they were made to [ compete with airs ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hnocukbix0 ) and thus have a shitty ulv cpu . 
  browser with custom 4chan css + irc + animu pic + screenfetch + obscure music = 90 % of desktop thread, 
  even worse in non-english countries they use special characters from their native language . 
  b-but my bash scripts ... 
   that amd logo, 
  lovely, 
  the archlinux lightweight and costumizable meme needs to die . 
  [ an arch developer himself said that arch is the opposite of that ] ( https://lists.archlinux.org/pipermail/arch-general/2015-july/039443.html ), 
  the 1600x1200 is an affs/flexview/ips display and is the only reason to do a frankenpad instead of just buying a t61 . 
  did you install any de , gnome should handle that by default ? 
  you can buy them for 160-200 dollars on ebay, 
   tfw you will never own the perfect t601f frankenpad with the real uxga flexview screen and post 08/08 nvidia chip . 
  many people have a thing for lowercase f, 
  oh god, 
  you should fix your font rendering . 
  all you have to do is enable the non-free repos , it 's just editing a config file . 
  not bad but it 's not something i 'd put on a thinkpad . 
  they 're for me are that boring black business machines . 
  still no hardware decoding on youtube though ... 
  show me your about : support page where it says h264 hardware decoding . 
  well no is a no , meaning that youtube eats more battery . 
  i get around 13-14w while if i play the same video using mpv + youtube-dl i get 11-12w, 
  hiding in plain sight may be a good idea . 
  also chrome on windows user agent . 
  this man speaks in fucking riddles . 
  absolutely disgusting, 
  $ 1 , $ 2 , etc. . . are command line args . 
  dialing down the cpu is not always the best option . 
  most of the time it 's better to execute the task quickly so the processor can go into idle state quicker . 
  thinkpads and other business machines such as latitudes and elitebooks . 
  what other alternatives are there ? 
  definitely not some shitty consumer-line pavilion or inspiron . 
  firefox on intel, 
  supports hardware h264 decoding no ;, 
  are you not happy with ubuntu ? 
  download unity tweak tool and install some themes if you want to change things a bit but if it works then just use it , an os is just a tool . 
  you do n't see carpenters showing off their hammers to each other , they just use them . 
  what about ffmpeg hardware decoding ? 
  i think firefox since version 43 stopped using gstreamer and now it 's using ffmpeg . 
  do you use firefox ? 
  for me in the ` about : support ` page i have, 
  supports hardware h264 decoding no ;, 
  chromium also reports on ` chrome : / / gpu `, 
  video decode : software only , hardware acceleration unavailable, 
  and, 
  accelerated video decode is unavailable on linux : 137247, 
  disabled features : accelerated_video_decode, 
  and i do notice a higher power usage when playing the same video on youtube when compared to mpv + youtube-dl . 
  on youtube it 's around 13w while mpv + youtube-dl is 11-12w, 
  also the right alt becomes alt gr , english us have them both as alt only . 
  linkthe1st made some quality videos back then . 
  let 's not forget in the early days,
