  \u2611 also install google chrome and set is as my default browser, 
  on literally every popular program , and as we all know most normal people just press next and not read a thing . 
  * 30 is now objectively the best thinkpad you can buy . 
   arch screwed up my wi-fi, 
  after reading this it 's kinda expected . 
   so i guess i 'm asking you to convince me, 
  you probably have a reflect damage enchantment on you , check your active effects tab . 
  did you even read the guides in the sidebar ? 
  1 led  1 led/key, 
  is n't retina just a higher resolution ? 
  retina is just a marketing name for hidpi, 
   buys an x220 instead of the superior in every way x230 because of the 7 row keyboard for the functionality, 
   gets a `` minimal '' 40 % keyboard, 
  i also once played a whole afternoon of minecraft and when i had to go out the sun was setting and my first though was, 
   shit the monsters are about to come, 
  it 's really ridiculous how he 's getting banned just for having a different view on how the linux ecosystem should be . 
  reddit mods are generally idiots .

  what is the condition of your battery ( i.e wear level ) ? 
  there 's also somewhere an email where rms answers to this picture , wish i saved it . 
  [ how i do my computing ] ( https://stallman.org/stallman-computing.html ), 
  36 is kinda low . 
  on older thinkpads at least , the t with an 's ' suffix have worse battery life than regular t because of the slimmer design also implies a slimmer battery .

  unrelated but can somebody explain me why some companies have weird stock names such as msft , aapl , intc , nvda , etc. . . 
  you do not seem to fully understand what exactly `` free '' software and the whole `` freedom '' business, 
  read again . 
   the freedom [ # 1 ] to study how the ** program ** works . 
  you ca n't study a proprietary program . 
  i 'm pretty sure here in all of places there 's no need to mention which linus we 're talking about . 
  it 's not like that . 
  i had this happen to my windows partition . 
  it does not `` activate '' the update if you close the window . 
  the real problem is the window pops up saying that an upgrade is scheduled on day xx . 
  if you close the window the update remains scheduled , so you have to click the `` cancel schedule '' . 
  it 's just a dumb tripfag, 
   ( that 's 1 followed by 158 zeroes for the curious ), 
  that is 10 ^ 158 , just to give a perspective there are ~ 10 ^ 80 ** atoms ** in the observable universe . 
  just watch more of his talks and read more articles, 
  it 's not about `` freedom '' to do anything with the computer . 
  it 's having an os compromised fully of free software so you are free to study how it works , modify it for any purpose , distribute your changes to others , etc. . . that is why proprietary software is a no-no . 
  congratulations , you ran a few commands in the console . 
  you are truly a master of reading a wiki page . 
  it 's pretty much the best price/performance thinkpad you can get if you do n't mind the new chiclet and 6-row layout . 
  it has a full voltage cpu , good power management , pretty good igpu ( twice as better as the * 20 series ' ) , still has independent volume buttons , has more ram slots ( 16 gb max ) , expresscard slot ( can use egpu ) . 
  the only downside i can think of is there 's no 1080p screen . 
  the newer generation x240 , has a 1080p ips screen , however it has the shit all-in-one trackpoint buttons , a low voltage cpu , no independent volume buttons ( they just removed them , what the fuck ? 
  ) , a single slot for ram with maximum 8 gb capacity and no expresscard . 
  honestly i 've been really tempted to just install ubuntu with unity and be done with it . 
  all it needs is a flat theme and icons and it looks gorgeous , because the default ones look kinda 2008ish . 
  [ here 's the webm that made me consider it ] ( http://webmshare.com/play/m7z0x ) from [ this post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxmasterrace/comments/4ff6uz/i_just_compiled_my_first_kernel/ ) a while back . 
  what 's the point of it ? 
  thinkpads are tanks , i just throw mine in my eastpak and forget about it . 
  roll back to 7 ? 
   if i ca n't install whatever i want on the system, 
  that 's the problem , fsf does not fight for `` install whatever you want on your computer '' . 
  you 're simply misinterpreting what they stand for and what their goals are . 
  okay , going to try as basic as i can . 
  proprietary software is defective by design , you ca n't study it , modify it or do whatever you want with it because you do n't have the source code . 
  this leaves you at the mercy of the developer , if they programmed a keylogger that sends your keystrokes whenever you open a bank webpage , they can do it , and you have no idea if it is happening . 
  this type of software design is considered malware and that is why if you want to have freedom in your computer you should use free software . 
  once you put proprietary on your system your freedom gets compromised ( perhaps a more appropriate word would be security ? ), 
  [ perhaps a talk would be more interesting ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lupghyik9q ), 
  they simply want to avoid proprietary software by default . 
  and it 's not preventing you anything , you can change the repos in parabola ( which is fsf approved ) to regular arch for example . 
  about source code , you probably do not but others do . 
  did you guys change the css recently ? 
  i remember it being kinda clusterfucky, 
  yes, 
   i should point out that your webm is 404 'd . 
  still plays fine for me . 
  live at nassau ny . 
  i remember hearing that one years ago but i ca n't find it now . 
  more like ibm sold their thinkpad line to lenovo ... 
  with that awful fail-at-solarized css theme, 
  just letting you know that you were shadowbanned by reddit admins ( not us ) so you should message them to resolve your problem, 
  your edits gave me fucking cancer, 
  the main reason people ( like me ) choose the * 20 series over * 30 is because they want that classic keyboard and 7 row layout . 
  since you do n't care about the keyboard then there 's no reason to get a t420 when the t430 is superior in every way . 
  biggest advantages include a more power efficient cpu and a much better igpu . 
  personally i wish was n't this `` get off my lawn '' and did n't care about the keyboard so i could get the best price/performance thinkpad series right now which are the * 30 ones . 
  is all that blogging necessary ? 
  any relatively modern intel and amd cpu has a fucking backdoor to your entire computer . 
   the intel management engine with its proprietary firmware has complete access to and control over the pc : it can power on or shut down the pc , read all open files , examine all running applications , track all keys pressed and mouse movements , and even capture or display images on the screen . 
  and it has a network interface that is demonstrably insecure , which can allow an attacker on the network to inject rootkits that completely compromise the pc and can report to the attacker all activities performed on the pc . 
  it is a threat to freedom , security , and privacy that ca n't be ignored . 
  the whole page is very well written and worth reading . 
  when next elder scrolls will be released every kiddie will cry about how skyrim was much better and not as dumbed down as the new game . 
  antergos is a very bad idea . 
  basically they spoonfeed you the install part ( which is easy to do manually in the first place ) and throw you into the arch world where you need to read wiki pages and mess with config files . 
  ca n't wait for kerneld, 
  you can hold the block key while casting spells to make the cooldown time between spells shorter . 
  that became crucial on my atronach birthsign 100 % spell absorb build where ( another hidden mechanic ) you can absorb your own telekinesis to restore magicka . 
  [ better leveled lists ] ( http://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/2272/ ? ),

  wait , windows 10 does not allow you to simply install the game from cd ? 
  pirate the game then , you already own it . 
  it may seem unethical at first but it 's microsoft 's fault that windows ' codebase is a massive honk of shit and they had to disable securom because it would cause issues .
