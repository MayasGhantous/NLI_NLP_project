  perfectly ? 
  i though you had to remap 2 or 3 keys for complete functionality . 
  edit : also , nice keyboard .

   since i was 39916800, 
   i 'm posting this on a throwaway because i do n't want this complaint to be associated with my main account, 
  what the actual fuck ? 
   os x is nonfree, 
  os x is built upon a free foundation ( darwin os ) with proprietary gui and a few drivers . 
  use ` systemd-boot ` instead of grub , it 's better for an uefi system . 
  i 'm pretty sure x220 has better battery life than the t420 ... 
  and the t420s has worse battery life than regular t420, 
  under the reply box there 's `` formatting help '' you can click , which opens the most useful formatting syntax .

  i just want h264 hardware decoding so i can watch youtube without much battery drain . 
  vaapi is installed and works with mpv . 
  but both firefox 's about : support and chrome 's chrome : / / gpu pages report no hardware decoding . 
  what does your about : support page say ? 
  all you have to do is go to the vp9 wiki page, 
  i think you can set ` layers.acceleration.force-enabled ` to true but what i want is stable support . 
  since you have to enable it in about : config it means it 's not fully ready . 
  oh , you 're right , the ` layers . ` prefix makes sense . 
  what firefox used by default to accelerate compositing layers ? 
  oh wow , i had no idea the ui was software accelerated . 
  guess another thing i 'm waiting for , i use linux on a laptop and battery life is very important . 
  you can become an expert with the trackpoint in 1 or 2 days maximum . 
  of course it is playable , but the decoding is handled fully by the cpu which drains your battery life . 
  very little . 
  i 'd rather prefer that bethesda works on something new than pointless remakes . 
  what 's up with muh remakes/remasters obsession ? 
  why would you want developers to waste time on pretty much better graphics and minor improvements ? 
  i only use the trackpoint however i see no reason to disable the touchpad . 
  whenever you use the trackpoint or are typing , the touchpad gets disabled so if you touch it by accident then nothing happens , it 's as if it was part of the palmrest . 
  if you think about how you do your computing , you 're either moving the mouse around and clicking stuff or typing something which means the touchpad is disabled 99 % of time . 
  plus whenever someone needs to use your laptop and they 're not familiar with the trackpoint , the touchpad is right there . 
  ~ ~ palmrest is carbon reinforced plastic ~ ~ , it 's the top lid that has rubberized texture . 
  edit : apparently it 's not . 
  just embrace the joke , no need to act smartass, 
  shit . 
  what was the newest model with carbon fiber reinforced plastic then ? 
  the new * 60 series honestly look like some cheap bootleg knockoffs of the older models . 
  it 's really sad, 
   i like how arch linux gives you complete control over the system, 
  this is false and [ an arch developer himself ] ( https://lists.archlinux.org/pipermail/arch-general/2015-july/039443.html ) said that arch is the __ opposite __ of user-centric freedom . 
  the only reason people like me buy the x220 is because of the classic keyboard . 
  x230 is just straight up superior in everything else . 
  so if you 're one of the lucky persons that does not mind the new 6-row chiclet keyboard then x230 is a godsend . 
  yes you 're right , i did n't mention it because i did n't think it was much of an issue . 
  do you think that by 2018 you wont be able to find genuine replacement batteries ? 
  [ there 's a madman that modified the embedded controller firmware to accept his 3rd party battery ] ( http://www.zmatt.net/unlocking-my-lenovo-laptop-part-1/ ) . 
  x240 also has fn + end as insert . 
  it 's pretty much the worst thinkpad you can buy right now , the only thing good about it is the 1080p ips option . 
  did n't even show how it looked at the end . 
  have you read the recommended mods ? 
  what have you tried installing ? 
  it is , [ here 's a link ] ( http://www.zmatt.net/unlocking-my-lenovo-laptop-part-1/ ) to a madman that managed to do it . 
  it 's checked by the embedded controller ( ec ) . 
  [ here 's a sort of story ] ( http://www.zmatt.net/unlocking-my-lenovo-laptop-part-1/ ) of how a dude managed to unlock his laptop . 
  get the dankpad, 
   i use my computer all day, 
  this is a problem, 
  i remember the first time i enabled e10s , probably spent like 10 minutes just scrolling back and forth . 
  back when i played i had more or less the same feeling as you . 
  so i made a mod myself called [ sun damage change ] ( http://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/45002/ ? ), 
  that only makes the sun damage you at 100 % vampirism , at 50 % and 75 % it was kept at 0 damage because if you keep it at 0 instead of removing , then the sun burn screen effects remain , making it more immersive . 
  that gave me plenty of time before i had to feed so feeding was no longer a chore . 
  antergos is a pointless distro and if you use it you should be ashamed of yourself . 
  covered in rain is one of those songs that you have to stop whatever you 're doing and just listen . 
  that 's why you buy used/refurbished instead of the new ones . 
  shitting their board is not enough so they must come to / g /, 
  yes , they disable it and then remove entirely from memory . 
  it is only possible on older intel chips though , we will probably newer have libreboot on anything past x200 because me is signed . 
  the x230/t430 are pretty much superior in every way than the x220/t420 . 
  the only reason people ( like me ) bought the * 20 series is because of the classic keyboard . 
  if you do n't mind the new chiclet 6-row layout then you can go with * 30 series . 
  however * 30 series can not charge 3rd party batteries , only genuine lenovo ones . 
  my trust was broken with, 
   overclocker 's dream, 
   and do you think we will get more recent laptops with the ryf certification from the fsf ? 
  ( preferably thinkpads ), 
  x86 hardware most likely not . 
  you can read more here https://libreboot.org/faq/#intel ( the whole page is quite an interesting read ), 
  most relevant part to your question is :, 
   before version 6.0 ( that is , on systems from 2008/2009 and earlier ) , the me can be disabled by setting a couple of values in the spi flash memory . 
  the me firmware can then be removed entirely from the flash memory space . 
  libreboot does this on the intel 4 series systems that it supports , such as the libreboot x200 and libreboot t400 . 
  me firmware versions 6.0 and later , which are found on all systems with an intel core i3/i5/i7 cpu and a pch , include `` me ingition '' firmware that performs some hardware initialization and power management . 
  if the me 's boot rom does not find in the spi flash memory an me firmware manifest with a valid intel signature , the whole pc will shut down after 30 minutes . 
   due to the signature verification , developing free replacement firmware for the me is basically impossible .
