  i 'm going zerk and pwn them both xd ( skill needed ), 
  * cpu : it 's okay, 
  * mobo : msi b85m g43 is also a nice choice you might wan na check it out . 
  * ram : it 's fine . 
  * storage : i recommend switching to western digital caviar blue 1 tb . 
  they 're the same price but i 've seen alot of posts how seagate fails a lot . 
  * case : it 's a little bit expensive but it 's your choice , you can get cases for $ 40 - $ 50, 
  * psu : corsair cx600m is $ 10 less , higher wattage and semi modular . 
  * video card : it 's fine . 
  thanks for the info , but fuck em both . 
  i roll zerker and thunderstrike the fuck out of them ( with a lot of skill ofc ), 
  holy shit bot . 
  i ca n't believe i did the same mistake twice . 
  you could save the money from os and use it to get a gtx 770 . 
  because honestly for $ 900 a 760 build is a bit of underpowered . 
  well what he could have done better ? 
  * lol da infamous second son best exclusive ever suck on dat pc gamers . 
  seriously , how can a 8 hour $ 60 single player game compare to pc exclusive $ 20 never ending multiplayers that keep people playing over 1000 hours . 
  peasants before : * da 60 fps takes away imerssion and hurts human eye idiots *, 
  peasant later : * omg suck on dat console does 1080p at 60 fps omg it 's so smooth ps4 best system eva *, 
  is that better than doing cs and kuma ? 
  also how will i get gear to match my level ? 
  even worse than following the main quest ? 
  no sorc streamers ? 
  love this reply, 
  golden labyrinth 1 man or golden labyrinth with a 5 ppl party ? 
  thanks man , because i really need to decide if i continue with my level 52 sorc or just roll warrior slayer or archer . 
  seriously , the combat is amazing . 
  with or without xp boosts ? 
  have you seen videos of gameplay ? 
  i love how our homeland is considered alien and hard to live in . 
  we are survivors . 
  and we specialize in magic and stealth which is my favorite combination . 
  seriously , just go talk to paarthy for a bit and you will know the right choice . 
  ps : go fuck yourself delphine . 
  yeah but it will be worth it if you like fast paced combat and dodging and blocking stuff . 
  if our world was swords , bows medieval weapons and magic it would be much more interesting : /, 
   masterworked items no longer have yellow borders . 
  nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo, 
  it 's maintenance day . 
  yours is na , his it 's eu . 
  all i can say is welcome to eu mmo world . 
  where we suffer in hell with companies like gameforge while na thrives with :, 
  * better support, 
  * faster patches, 
  * better server stability, 
  * more and better events, 
  * buy more for less in cash shop, 
  * no bullshit ( like aion 's eu gold pack ), 
  while also being laggy , messy and huge , this client works only when it decides to . 
  a couple of days ago i had my launcher stuck at 0 % for no reason , i left it like that and then it decided to work . 
  but do n't trust their schedule if it says 7-11 always add extra 1 2 hours, 
  why arena unbalanced ? 
  i honestly can not choose . 
  because cyrodiil is like the reunion of all provinces :, 
  * black marsh-ish leyawiin, 
  etc. . 
  each of them and the land around is unique in a way and they all provide different atmospheres and feeling everytime you go to each of them . 
  in early game yes , but later you get chain skills and start hitting fast + you get + atackspeed gear . 
  by reading ** day/night cycle ** and ** music ** it instantly reminded me of perfect world . 
  does anyone still remember this old ass mmo ? 
  the mechanics are awful but i loved the flying mounts and open world pvp . 
  you could basically have fights in the air then drop off your mount and hop in again to kite melees ans stuff . 
  or just fly arou d exploring . 
  i think it was released before wow in china in 2005 or w/e, 
  dcuo is awesome . 
  i love how in the end you get to see how much you dpsed , healed , tanked , restored power ( mana ) and more . 
  it is pay to win . 
  people wasted thousands ( i know one of them personally ) on perfect world so it is very p2w . 
  i have no idea about currentlu but it is definetly not worth checking it out . 
  tera fits all your needs !, 
  * f2p and it is ** not ** pay to win . 
  * awesome action combat with aiming . 
  * pretty nice graphics . 
  the game might get a bit grindy if you play solo but since you got a friend it will be better . 
  i know i said this already but the combat is a fucking blast . 
  and fighting bams ( big ass monsters ) never gets old and you get a rewarding feeling since you need to do your best and focus on dodging/blocking their atacks . 
  action fast paced combat with open world pvp is awesome, 
  a little bit offtopic but i would like to talk about classes :, 
  i would love if a mmo had more unusual classss rather than just traditional classes . 
  examples :, 
  * forsaken world 's ** vampire **, 
  * dofus 's ** ecaflip ** ( a cat that dmg depends on luck ), 
  and also having even multiple specializations like in dragon 's nest ( archer  acrobat  windrunner ), 
  it is really fun to pvp vs like a `` cousin '' class for example i went archer  acrobat  windrunner vs a distant cousin archer  sharpshooter  sniper or a close one like archer  acrobat  tempest . 
  the ignorancy is strong on this one . 
  * a 3770k are you stupid ? 
  * $ 80 case hell no . 
  * ssd is not obrigatory its a priviliege, 
  * 500gb for $ 80 . 
  no dude . 
  you can get cheaper mobos dude . 
  also a console does n't come with your moms tv . 
  leme show u a real budget build :, 
  * 100-120 dollar cpu fx 6300 or i3 4130 . 
  often on sale u can get i5 4440 for just a little bit more . 
  * $ 60 mobo either am3 + or lga1150, 
  * 8gb ram for 60-70, 
  * $ 50 case, 
  * $ 40 corsair cx series psu,
