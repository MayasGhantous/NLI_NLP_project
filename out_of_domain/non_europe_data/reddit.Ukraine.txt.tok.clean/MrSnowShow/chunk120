  but i think he did campaign in texas a few times , but yeah , texas going blue is probably like california going red . 
  nvidia uses vdpau and not va-api, 
  t. / g /, 
  are you still getting banned over and over again and making new accounts ? 
  if that 's you then i admire you a lot . 
  it 's so fucking retarded how you are getting banned just because you have a different ** opinion ** on what the linux ecosystem should be . 
  could you enlighten me about it ? 
  i only started following trump and politics in general when dnc started . 
  i have a person that 's constantly saying how good obama is and how great america has become . 
  i pointed out the national debt rise but he quickly dismissed it by saying all countries have debts, 
  from ukraine actually . 
  i think the whole ` obama is the best ' is because he says that when ukraine got invaded obama and other countries leaders made a lot of sanctions and cut deals with russia so for him obama is a hero . 
   but unless that person actually lives in america , pays american taxes and deals with american politics , any opinion about how great america has become seems silly . 
  spot on . 
  you 're doing it wrong, 
  not op but this should be helpful, 
  you 'll need an os x compatible wifi card , stock do not work . 
   too heavy, 
  no they 're not . 
  also , the l series are the crappier version of the real thinkpad ( tm ), 
  i 'd stick with the x230, 
  $ 220 is a nice deal . 
  one big thing for me is the keyboard . 
  if you look at an [ x230 keyboard ] ( http://blog.the-compiler.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/x230.jpg ) vs the [ x240 ] ( https://ttboj.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/x240-keyboard.jpg ) , you 'll notice that first they just removed the independent volume and mute buttons and integrated them as fn + f keys , secondly they also removed the media buttons ( which previously were in the arrow keys ) and replaced them with useless ones and third and most disgusting is they simply made insert as fn + end . 
  not to mention the one button trackpoint buttons which are so crap that lenovo took them back in the next series, 
  * 40 series honestly are the shittiest choice in my opinion, 
   19w idle, 
  no good , idle should hover 10w max . 
  do you have tlp installed ? 
  weird , because it seems you do n't have it properly installed , what distro ? 
  that shinny keyboard though ... 
   #nothing actually happens if you 're offended, 
  love this one, 
  what about mark cuban ? 
  what he has to do with trump ? 
  ( non-american , only started following elections after dnc ) . 
   based on the fact that the democratic nominating process is totally rigged and crooked hillary clinton and deborah wasserman schultz will not allow bernie sanders to win , and now that i am the presumptive republican nominee , it seems inappropriate that i would debate the second place finisher . 
  this was the reason why . 
  no worries though , tomorrow everything will be revealed . 
  dude , trump was against 16 other ** politicians ** and they 're still wondering to this day how the hell he managed to win against them all . 
  if you think that trump is not a good debater then you 're truly delusional . 
  just scroll down to the 2nd comment ... 
  it was n't always 16 people , he even complained about having so many people on stage . 
   trump did well under those circumstances but we have yet to see him 1 on 1 , which calls for a very different set of debate skills . 
  yeah but his opponent is hillary , which has a very big problem with direct questions because she does n't have direct answers on them , the people and especially trump know that so i 'm not sure how will she handle being exposed as a corrupt and world class liar . 
  it was 8 years ago . 
  this woman now has seizures , coughing fits , and gets her unconscious body dragged into a van by security . 
  sanders , really ? 
  trump is an entirely different level . 
  cruz was considered a good debater and look what happened to him . 
  anyway , in a bit more than 24 hours we 'll see who is right and who is wrong . 
  also , could you stop downvoting because i need to wait now a few minutes before replying . 
  downvote is not a ` disagree ' button . 
   nothing about how trump appeals to intellect and reason, 
  yeah right , that 's why he 's a successful businessman . 
  to become a successful businessman you surely do not need intellect or reason ... 
   othing about how he communicates consistent , coherent points that reflect a commitment to his values, 
  he 's been saying the same about the state of the country for over 30 years ( corrupt politicians that do n't know what they 're doing , national debt rising , trade deficit , loosing jobs , etc. . . ), 
   i now realize `` it was n't always 16 people '' is the best defense of trump you could come up with . 
  you claimed he did good in debates because it was 16 people , i just said that it was n't always 16 people and he still did good in `` trump vs 2 or 3 other people '' debates . 
  it 's so pathetic how trump gets so much bullshit `` he 's dumb he 's stupid '' yet he 's accomplished much more than anyone who insults him probably will . 
  [ this is what i 'm talking about ] ( https://i.reddituploads.com/8210c369b45747bd8793d663342ecbf0?fit=max&amp;h=1536&amp;w=1536&amp;s=698d5c7505119d35301df02e153bf072 . ), 
  he borrowed $ 1,000,000 and build a company with them worth now ~ 10 billion . 
  not good ? 
   he 's been whining about everything, 
  trump for the last 30 years has been pointing out that the us have bad trade deals , national debt is rising , companies moving overseas and leaving hundreds of people without jobs . 
  these are real issues and should n't be dismissed as `` whining '' . 
   trump is twice my age , but i 'm far more highly educated than he is, 
  if you talk about how much intelligent you are then you 're probably not that bright . 
  i do n't think he knows what the word cuck means, 
   this is bigger than just the u.s. 
  this is a cultural shift, 
  definitely much more than just an us election , this is western civilization we 're talking about . 
   if you disable the privacy leaks, 
  are you really this delusional ? 
   blocking the thinkpad logo, 
  absolutely haram . 
  what are you running to have an only 8w discharge ? 
  i can get 8w if i do absolutely nothing . 
  start using the trackpoint . 
  it takes like 1 or 2 days and you 're a master after that . 
   but very bullshit questions ,, 
  absolutely disgusting . 
  there were 3 trump controversies that lester brought up and zero for hillary . 
  when he mentioned taxes i was like, 
   `` oh okay , so now they 're going to discuss each of the candidates controversies , good '' . 
  after that ended he then mentioned obama 's birth certificate , i thought, 
   `` okay this is getting ridiculous , but i guess they first talk about trump and then hillary '', 
  and later he still started talking about trump this time was about `` presidential look '' and shortly after it 's `` last question '' and over . 
  no hillary emails , no corrupt foundation , no benghazi . 
  fuck this guy . 
  arch + cinnamon preinstalled . 
  really ? 
  why not just use the real distro ? 
  in case anyone wondering why this -2147483648 is that the ` horses owned ' value is stored in a 32 bit value and -2147483648 in binary is, 
  that first 1 is the signal bit , 1 for negative and 0 for positive . 
  so the game for some reason put that 1 at the beginning . 
   has billions in the bank, 
   comes home and bangs his supermodel wife, 
   has a successful business,
