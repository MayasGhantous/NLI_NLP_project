   won the nomination against 16 other politicians, 
   currently leading in polls, 
   gets called ` stupid ' by some random redditors who will probably never accomplish half that he has . 
  yeah , you sure showed him . 
  it 's true . 
  i 'm sorry but the corrupt world class liar that can barely fit a high school gym in her pathetic rallies is not so popular as you might think . 
  even pence has more people than her . 
  \\ #trumpwon trending on twitter says otherwise, 
   one obviously racist, 
  why would you say that ? 
  ~ ~ it still baffles me how they have done it . 
  republicans wanted to end slavery , democrats opposed , republicans wanted to allow black people to vote , democrats opposed . ~ ~, 
  ~ ~ yet somehow they convinced that blacks should always vote democrat no matter what despite republicans were the ones fighting for them . ~ ~, 
  shit i fucked up . 
   download dws http://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/destroy_windows_10_spying.html and remove all the windows spyware . 
  are you really this delusional ? 
  do you seriously trust a 3rd party program made by god knows who with your os settings ? 
  really ? 
  well the description said ` freeware ' . 
  freeware is a term describing software distributed for ` free ' , executable only . 
  still , if you think you can change anything in windows 10 is pure delusion . 
  remember , it 's microsoft 's computer , not yours . 
   it 's another gaming kiddie tries to install arch and steam thread, 
  i doubt that you installed real arch though, 
  all you need is an icon pack and gtk theme, 
  weird , how ca n't you not read the error then ? 
  it says it ca n't load intel graphic drivers , what have you tried to do to fix it ? 
  themes and icon packs are independent , but some themes also offer their own icon pack for a more uniform look . 
  all you have to do is find a theme that you think looks good , and the same thing with an icon pack . 
  what happened to `` sticks and stones '' ? 
  just deal it with seriously what the fuck , why are we living in a generation of pussies that only cry about their feelings ? 
   trump 's praise of putin, 
  he 's saying that in sense that putin is better than obama because obama is weak and does n't get respect by putin and other world leaders . 
   or his aversion to upholding nato, 
  he just wants countries to pay what was agreed upon [ they should be spending 2 % of gdp on defense ] ( http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2016/images/04/15/nato-3_custom1.jpg?iid=el ) and many of them are not, 
   nonrelease of the tax returns . 
  he said he will release later when audit is done . 
  even the clandestine 1995 tax return document says nothing is wrong .

  for classic keyboards specifically, 
  the previous theme was probably one of the best i 've ever seen if not the best ( it 's a duel between old / r/firefox and / r/teslore for me ) . 
  honestly i do n't come here often because i do n't understand many of the post because i do n't have any knowledge about browsers and mozilla but when i come the big reason was just to appreciate the css . 
   `` blaze your own path '' is now gone, 
  why removing one of the most pleasing parts to look at . 
  why replace it with just blue backgroud ? 
   implying the rest of boards are all true story, 
   4chaners, 
  really ? 
   i 've put it in the sidebar , any thoughts on that ? 
  very generic . 
  could n't you just make it smaller and fit the new smaller header ? 
  yes , they 're not paying taxes that they ** should ** be paying . 
  trump pays what he legally must . 
  ever heard of tax loss carry forward ? 
   an accounting technique that applies the current year 's net operating losses to future years ' profits in order to reduce tax liability . 
  generally accepted accounting principles ( gaap ) specify that loss carryforwards can be used in any one of the seven years following the loss . 
  that 's the tax code , he simply followed it . 
  nothing illegal happened . 
  trump actually said in one of his rallies that he indeed benefited from the tax laws which the politicians allowed to exist , full of complicated amendments in favor of the wall street elite , donors and special interests . 
  he used those laws brilliantly that is why he 's the one who knows how to fix them . 
  but of course you wo n't hear the msm talking about this because they 're too busy being mad at trump following the law . 
  you forgot, 
  * 1x cat, 
   also how do i check what is the manufacturer of a particular keyboard ? 
  interrupting moderator bitch did n't want trump to say that clinton called african americans superpredators, 
  trump is being a fucking monster . 
  god damn !, 
  him congratulating her for creating isis was so brutal, 
   advisor : `` she would be if she 's done something illegal . '', 
  you 're kidding right ?? 
  hillary deleted evidence 33,000 emails and tried to cover it up . 
  consequentially it exposed classified information that could be hacked by any foreign nation . 
  just the fact that she 's right now under fbi investigation and running for president is absurd . 
  rip in piece , not that it was any good to begin with ... 
  registration closes in a lot of states today i think november is too late . 
  is it really necessary ? 
  i throw mine into an eastpak and forget about it . 
   they are trying to please everyone, 
  you please everybody by having many product lines and not fucking up the one that a certain demographic loves to please another totally different demographic . 
  wow is this 2007 ? 
  dre is a master, 
   trumps a racist , misogynist , xenophobic serial sexual assaulter, 
  trumps a [ citation needed ] , [ citation needed ] , [ citation needed ] [ citation needed ], 
  i laughed everytime clinton mentioned her website for `` fact-checking '' during the debates . 
  like yeah , go to my totally not biased website if you want to know the '' '' '' '' '' `` truth '' '' '' '' '' '' . 
  if you want portable 12.5 inch go with x220/x230 . 
  if you want 14 inch go with t420/t430 . 
  now between * 20 or * 30 is personal preference . 
  if you do n't mind the 6 row layout then go with * 30 since it 's a generation newer and almost better in every way except you ca n't use 3rd party batteries and it 's harder to flash a modified bios if you want to remove wifi whitelist . 
  you can also go with older models all the way to x60/t60 depending on your needs and how `` old school '' you want it to be ( 4:3 or 16:10 , ibm logo , etc. . . ) but the * 20 and * 30 are the best price/performance . 
  laugh all you want you still ca n't provide one . 
  where is it ? 
  that 's the t430 ? 
  if so then you should know that you can only use official lenovo batteries on * 30 and newer . 
  wow , you linked me an anti-trump subreddit , that really proves he is racist, 
  it 's more like, 
  #evanevanevanevanevna hangon hangon hangon hangon can you fact that that for me on the fly ?
