   how is it clinton 's fault that someone sent her the question ahead of time , unprovoked ? 
  you ca n't be serious about this one . 
  do you really think she would risk her career and reputation by leaking debate questions just for shit and giggles . 
   when i see it i 'll believe it . 
  until then , `` evidence '' in the form of partisan hacks releasing heavily doctored videos featuring out of context quotes from individuals who are acting independently of clinton 's campaign ate not going to sway me, 
  you 're still ignoring wikileaks . 
  the one who has a history of 100 % accuracy . 
   why did brazile leak the question then ? 
  you think she was paid ? 
  evidence ? 
  i do n't fucking know , it could be either a blowjob , some favor , plain money . 
  all we know is that hillary got questions in advance , making it unfair . 
  and you 're defending it , i see you do n't like fair elections . 
   the wikileaks emails do not offer proof of any corruption . 
  i 've asked repeatedly for concrete proof of corruption contained in the wikileaks emails and you have n't provided it, 
  dude the emails literally have a yellow highlight . 
  you require close to zero amount of brainpower to draw conclusions from them and this whole situation and i 'm really having trouble understanding how you 're unable to . 
  [ taking money from foreign nations ] ( https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/11915 ) - it 's illegal, 
  [ huma dmits in email that foreign interests force hillary to do what they want her to do , also admits that `` friend of hillary '' list is available and rentable to people who want to influence ] ( https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/5469 ) - basically she 's a puppet . 
  [ hillary 's team destroyed ipads and blackberries with hammers in the state department ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twimjlx_abq ) . 
  definitely nothing shady going on right ? 
  fact checked on the fly . 
  honestly this thread is going pretty good and / r/the _ donald now has +90 % upvote rate ( they constantly downvote everything there ) . 
  which means they stopped `` working '' . 
  probably waiting further instructions . 
   but that is decisively not what happened , and that email says so in plain as day language, 
  * they are discussing whether or not they should take the money and need to sort them out based on various criteria . 
  at the end suggesting to take the money and deal with attacks . 
  why that if there 's nothing wrong with taking the money ? 
   where does huma say that hillary does what foreign interests force her to do ? 
  * context , but you do not seem to be able to connect 2 and 2 to get 4 . 
  * destroying equipment with hammers is not okay . 
  also why do you need a video of it happening when it is confirmed that it did happen . 
  what are you asking from me is that i get hillary myself and bring to your home and make her somehow admit that she 's a corrupt and dishonest person . 
  yet you probably still would dismiss it because it 's obviously a fake double hillary . 
  use your head and be skeptical of these career politicians that [ do not give a flying shit or a fuck about you ] ( https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/927#efmaiuamkaviaxv ), 
   trump , well , do we even need to go there ? 
  how about we got there ? 
  i 'm wondering of your opinion on trump . 
  why do you type like this ? 
  you have 1985 in your username which implies that you are at least 31 years old . 
  that 's plenty of time to learn how to type properly . 
   he 's a buffoon , a charlatan , a philanderer ; he 's arrogant , egotistical ; he 's racist , misogynistic , xenophpobic ;, 
  he 's a [ subjective ] , [ subjective ] , [ subjective ] : , he 's [ subjective ] , arrogant ( in a good way ) , [ subjective ] ; he 's [ citation needed ] , [ citation needed ] , [ citation needed ] . 
  in particular i 'd really love to see where he says something racist . 
   he has no genuine policy agenda . 
  renegotiate bad trade deals , securing the southern border , impose term limits on all members of the congress , repeal and replace the no longer affordable obamacare . 
  just some of them , are you even paying attention ? 
   he has avoided taxes, 
  he paid exactly what he legally had to . 
  have you ever heard of [ loss carryforward ] ( http://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/losscarryforward.asp ) ? 
  it 's a legal accounting technique . 
   his vision of the future borders on fascism , where borders are closed, 
  strong border to keep criminals , drug lords and other bad people out . 
  also to control illegal immigration because it 's very unfair how many people wait for years to become citizens and others just go across the border and do n't care . 
   `` others '' deported, 
  illegal aliens . 
  there 's a deportation force active right now called ice which by the way endorsed him , as did over 16000 border patrol agents working tirelessly risking their lives at the border . 
   immigrants are scapegoats . 
  illegal criminal aliens . 
  not normal immigrants , his wife is a immigrant for fucks sake . 
   his intellect can barely maintain a single train of thought through the end of a sentence . 
  he 's a very smart person . 
  [ he predicted 9/11 19 months before it happened ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ruxcv71ic ) and constantly outsmarts the joke that is the msm for example [ when tricked the msm that he 's gon na comment on the birther issue so they all rushed to there to see if they can catch some controversies but ended up with 30 minute coverage of him getting endorsements by the millitary ] ( http://dailycaller.com/2016/09/16/media-outraged-after-trump-tricks-them-to-cover-endorsements-from-military-heroes/ ), 
  also predicted brexit and recently that anthony weiner, 
  do n't dismiss his intellect just because you do n't agree with him . 
  do you think a dumb person could build and run a successful business ? 
   his `` rigged election '' rhetoric is not only baseless but dangerous . 
  remember that dnc was rigged against bernie ( wikileaks revealed this ) . 
  debbie wasserman schultz quickly resigned after the scandal because she was supposed to be neutral . 
  also texans reporting their republican vote being changed to democrat . 
   he panders to white supremacists, 
  what is latinos for trump , women for trump , etc. . . ? 
   his campaign is a publicity stunt, 
  one of the biggest political phenomenons recently happening . 
  dozens of thousands of people go to his rallies and are extremely enthusiastic about it . 
   he has no experience ,, 
  true but he 's not there alone, 
   supporters are , frequently , bigots . 
  they 're bigots because they do n't agree with you . 
  okay . 
  yes , but i saw many misinformation and pointed it out . 
   supporting a [ citation needed ] , [ citation needed ] , [ citation needed ] fraudster is not worthy of my respect . 
   we get it straight from the sexist , racist , fascist mouth . 
  really ? 
  i 'd love to see it/hear it because that would definitely turn me away from trump , yet i never heard him say something racist . 
   [ citation needed ] that comes out of the trump campaign, 
   i do n't respect [ citation needed ] , and i do n't respect [ citation needed ], 
  i 'd really love to see trump saying something racist . 
  do you really think that the huffington shitpost is a reliable source ? 
  it 's the same as if i linked you an infowars or breitbart article . 
   he said a judge was biased because he was of mexican decent . 
  he said this . 
  he was being treated very unfairly by the judge and many lawyers he talked to backed it up . 
  we all agree that the very strong `` we 're building a wall and mexico is going to pay for it '' statement made a lot of mexicans butthurt and he simply pointed out that the judge could be one of them . 
  do n't you think that 's a reasonable concern ? 
  what if he indeed was biased ? 
   his company would not rent to minorities . 
  this is documented . 
  he won that case .
