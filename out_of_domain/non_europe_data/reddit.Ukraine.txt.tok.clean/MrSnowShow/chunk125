   he advocates denying immigration based on religion . 
  this is one of his big platforms . 
  extreme vetting from problematic places like syria , how did letting 1 million immigrants uncontrollably work out for germany ? 
   when people at your rallies who are there to support you are throwing nazi salutes, 
  this does not happen . 
  huffpo , really quality articles, 
  that article was written by michael d'antonio . 
  [ he writes for the huffington post ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/author/michael-dantonio ) , and i forgot to earlier mention but [ huffington post is commited to make sure hillary is elected ] ( https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/5988 ) . 
  and did they seriously try to race-bait with something that his father said in the 70s ? 
  [ here 's a washington post article ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/07/25/did-donald-trump-really-say-those-things/ ) where they show how hillary ads use some of his quotes but very out of context and slight variations that make a big impact . 
  but look , let 's appeal to common sense . 
  if trump was so racist why there would be these latinos for trump , women for trump and other groups , getting invited into a black church , etc. . . 
   this was a later version . 
  originally , trump was calling for a universal ban on all muslims entering the united states `` until we figure it out . '', 
  it was n't based on country . 
  yes but it evolved into extreme vetting , why are you sticking to something that is no longer what he no longer supports ? 
   then there was this , which definitely was n't nazi , but still cultish and deeply troubling, 
  it 's not cultish or troubling . 
  it 's all just for shit and giggles , did you even watch the video of the article you posted ? 
  it 's silly to try to link something done just for laughs and to relax a bit from politics topics to the rise of fascism or something . 
   his anti-muslim sentiment, 
  it 's anti-terrorism , who in most of the cases are muslims . 
  it evolved into extreme vetting after a thought and that is what matters . 
   that 's troubling . 
  [ no fun allowed at trump rallies !, 
  ] ( http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/facebook/000/731/143/3e3.jpg ) really ? 
  that 's why tens of thousands of people go to his rallies , because he mixes talking about various political topics and having fun with the crowd and entertaining them . 
   do you not see the bigotry in equating muslim to terrorist ? 
  i did equate , read again . 
  i said `` who in most of the cases are muslims '' . 
   a politician should n't be an entertainer . 
  he 's not an entertainer . 
  so you think trump should be a robotic politic that reads from a paper what to say to his crowd ? 
  rallies are for you to interact with your supporters and he 's damn good at it . 
  how can you be against keeping a good and happy mood and making interesting rallies ? 
   i think that trump has formed a cult of personality around himself , and made the election more about him than about what he can do for america . 
  that is a prerequisite to dictators taking power . 
  what are you even talking about ? 
  his whole campaign is about making america great again . . 
  this man could have happily lived the rest of his days without any worries . 
  yet he chose to fight against the corrupt establishment . 
  renegotiating bad trade deals , bringing jobs back from overseas ( it happened because of bad trade deals ) , lowering taxes for the middle class , repealing and replacing the no longer affordable obamacare , term limits on all members of the congress ( to fight corruption ) . 
  how is this bad ? 
  huffington post is a liberal leftist hellhole . 
  this is the conclusion anybody can reach after spending 3 minutes browsing the site . 
  [ huffpo fired a guy for questioning hillary 's health ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhhnr5jetiw ), 
  [ huffpo is committed to make sure hillary is elected as the next president ] ( https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/5988 ), 
   trump 's speech at the rnc said `` i alone can fix this . '', 
  i think that shows how much he thinks it 's about him, 
  he 's saying that because he 's an outsider from mainstream politics . 
  he criticizes politicians by being all talk and no action and being bough by special interests , lobbyists and donors . 
  it 's not about bragging , it 's about being an outsider and not a career politician . 
   he was pro-globalism in 2013, 
  what ? 
  he 's had his opinion about the state of the country for like 30 years . 
  [ sorry for linking a video with biased title ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocabt_o0ysm ) but it has interviews back to 80s where he 's talking about how the country is getting ripped off , the same as now . 
  you can basically listen trump saying 20-30 years ago the same things as today . 
  that 's not the issue , he 's pro free trade and all those things but problem is us are getting ripped off with bad trade deals . 
  he wants to put america first on these deals . 
  what 's wrong with women for trump ? 
  why would they be confused ? 
  i think if they go to rallies and buy women for trump gear and clothes then they 're far from confused . 
  trump is not there alone , he will have great negotiators for him . 
  they ca n't predict what kind of deals will come out the renegotiations . 
   most, 
  5 out 13, 
  okay . 
   tfw you 'll never be able to shitpost 24/7 on twitter inside your 2b neet mansion, 
  that is because you get your news from baity biased articles on facebook . 
   he comes over as a complete and total idiot, 
  you have no idea what you 're talking about . 
  do you really think a dumb person would manage to have a successful business in the first place ? 
  he also lost a lot of money in the 90s as many other businesses but he managed to come back unlike many other who never did . 
  trump wants to renegotiate bad trade deals that rip off the us , have a strong border , invest in the military , lower taxes on middle class and impose term limits on all members of the congress . 
  but i bet you never heard any of this because they 're too busy reporting how trump called someone fat 11 years ago . 
  are n't you spamming this for like the 3rd time now ? 
   `` anti-trump '' was the moderators reasoning . 
  it 's clearly stated in the subreddit rules that you should only post if you support trump , as it makes moderation easier . 
  is it not obvious that a trump supporting subreddit is biased towards trump ? 
  the sub is n't trying to be neutral , it is clearly biased and states it many times . 
   killing democracy . 
  really ? 
  so choosing a candidate democratically kills democracy ? 
  i guess you only like democracy when your side is winning and the opposition is `` killing '' democracy if they 're winning . 
   clinton sent emails !, 
  she created an illegal private server , then when specifically asked to hand the emails over , she deleted it . 
  that 's a crime , which is why she 's under fbi investigation right now . 
   all trump ever did was sexually assault multiple women, 
  this is what they claim . 
  one of them opened a store a day before announcing , seeking fame maybe no ? 
  good that nobody buys her bullshit . 
   over grabbing women by the pussy, 
  have you even watched the 2005 video ? 
  it 's alpha male banter . 
   sent emails, 
  do not dismiss it as simply `` sending emails '' . 
  she 's under fbi investigation right now because of it . 
  not sure if you know but communications are supposed to be transparent , however clinton created an illegal private server where they could communicate without it being seen by the state department . 
  when they learned about this they asked her to turn the emails over yet she deleted them and used bleachbit to hide traces and her team even [ destroyed multiple blackberries and ipads with hammers ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twimjlx_abq ) . 
   first , nobody ever talked like that,
