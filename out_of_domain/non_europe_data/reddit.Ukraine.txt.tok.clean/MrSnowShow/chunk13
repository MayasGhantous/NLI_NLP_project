  * $ 150 gpu better than ps4, 
  * wd caviar blue for $ 59 1 tb 7200 rpm, 
  why not both ? 
  started playinv since 1.26 and stopped at 2.0 . 
  a real dissapointment , the atmosphere died with the update and just was n't fun anymore . 
  oh and i would love to see mmos handle pvp rules like dofus : you are neutral , but you can join anytime bonta ( angelic ) or brakmar ( devils ) and when you join you can pk the opposite faction , if you pk a neutral you have penalties . 
  so instead of having pvp and pve servers mmos could handle it this way in one server . 
  i still have the music in my head < 3, 
  seriously dude just browse / r/buildapc and you will find pretty decent budget builds that can actually run games @ 1080p for just like 100 150 more than a console, 
  you also forget that most people have a comp for internet and console for games . 
  this means 400/500 console + 500 for pc = 900/1000 . 
  but you can have for just 600 an all in one ** more powerful ** gaming/web browsing/video editing/music making/photoshoping/animating / coding/whatever the fuck you want and save 300-400 . 
  add steam sales , free online and generally cheaper games and in the long run you save a ton of money . 
  there is no reason to go full tower . 
  a mid tower does the job just fine . 
  majestic as fuck . 
  the arrows are still there and it only appears when you upvote something , when downvoting it mods should add a peasant head . 
  nooo !, 
  never heard such good soundtrack in any other mmo . 
  red team ftw !, 
  awesome !, 
  \\ # 1366x768problems, 
  i wo n't win because i never win anything . 
  but still , does n't cost trying . 
  i can not understand how you do n't like leveling too fast . 
  this game is a huge pain to grind , atleast for me , because it 's the same shit over and over . 
  so if i 'm overleveled i can just 1-2 shot those mobs and advance through areas faster . 
  well all i can say is , atleast me , in cs with sorc i just almost faceroll to win after level 48 . 
  no seriously , my pc is kinda crappy so not everyone 's models get loaded and i get gray models that are not in the position that they show up in my screen but i still end up most of the time in top 5, 
  see a bunch of people together, 
  burst of celerity, 
  cast every spell that you have off cooldown, 
  open source programs ftw !, 
  it 's in the clouds !, 
  i7 is almost useless for gaming ( 0,5 % increase maybe ) so it 's not worth the extra price just for hyperthreading, 
  the problem with laptops for gaming is that you 're paying for the portability rather than performance . 
  so for the same money a self built desktop will always be much better than a laptop . 
  oh and whatever yo do , do ** not ** buy those pre-build desktops , especially the `` gaming '' ones ( ex : alienware ) . 
  it 's because they 're overpriced and most of the times unbalanced - generally include a useless i7 along with a $ 50 gpu ( graphics card ) and your games run like crap . 
  building by yourself is the best method since :, 
  you get more performance for less money, 
  ** you can choose individual components and be sure that they 're quality ones and have long warranties for each ** ( this one is really important ), 
  you can make it look however you want . 
  no bloatware ( pre build computers usually come with alot of stupid software that only occupies space ), 
  you learn alot about computers which means you can repair them by yourself . 
  you set your budget , which means you can either build a $ 500 budget build that outperforms consoles or go for a $ 1500 build with the greatest components and everything in between to suit your needs . 
  and before you think that you ca n't do it : if you have the ability to read or watch a 20 minute video on how to do it then you 're more than capable of building it by yourself . 
  oh and if you visit / r/buildapc people can help you select parts for your pc so you get the most performance for your budget . 
  i have a natural bald spot in middle of my moustashe , basically it 's like hitler reversed . 
  yes the 0,5 % -1 % increase is between i5 4670k vs i7 4770k, 
  amd is great for budget builds because both cpus and gpus have a better price/performance ratio than their competitors intel and nvidia . 
  but the problem is that they stopped making the performance cpus ( fx ones ) around 2012 to compete with intel and focused on apus . 
  the fx series are still fairly good atm but are getting outdated . 
  but let me tell you a little story :, 
  a point in time intel went into performance per core while amd went for more cores ( they made the first 8 core ) . 
  problem was is that most programs/games would n't use a lot of cores so intel dominated the market . 
  this is changing but it still is n't noticable , that is why if you compare i5 4670 3.4 ghz against fx 8320 3.5 ghz , the intel one will win in single core performance . 
  but also the i5 is from middle 2013 and fx 8320 is from 2012 . 
  so the final verdict is probably go intel because amd stopped making performance cpus and they 're getting outdated while intel is making new cpus, 
  edit : if you get a midrange gpu then you can get away with a cheaper cpu . 
  but if you go high end gpu then you will also need a better cpu . 
  currently i think that a fx 8320 or 8350 do n't bottleneck the high end cards but since they arent making more fx cpus , they will be bottlenecking when newer cards come out . 
  ps : i heard some stuff saying that intel 's 4th gen of cpus they cheaped out on thermal paste ... 
  ** but do not believe 100 % on what i said because nothing is better than doing your own research **, 
  ** guards !, 
  get the town 's people to safety **, 
  yea , heimskr is already a dick yelling about talos, 
  do ** not ** buy alienware or any prebuilt pc . 
  just build them yourself . 
  overheating laptop , one of the first i7 720 @ 1.6 ghz and a hd 5650m . 
  i have like 1200 $ and i can build myself a pc . 
  but problem is that in 1 year i go study to capital city and probably ca n't take my desktop with me and only come weekends home , and my parents say that i probably will outgrow games just like i did with toys and stuff when i was little . 
  is that on linux ? 
  that clock is classy as fuck . 
  still alive prisioner ? 
  keep close to me if you want to stay that way . 
  are you ready ? 
  here we go :, 
  ** pc specific **, 
  * pc ui , just like darnified ui and skyui, 
  * higher res textures, 
  * more hotkeys because we have a fucking keyboard with lots of keys, 
  * if possible , support for hyperthreading , multiple cores and all the advantages pc brings, 
  * skyrim has ( or had ) a bug where if fps goes way over 60 , things start to fucking go crazy [ video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfcdrma2daq ) . 
  support for higher fps for people with 144 hz monitors . 
  * and of course keep the modding ability , since this is huge in elder scrolls and give us construction set/creation kit . 
  * hope bethesda never thinks of bringing any kind of drm ( steam is exception ), 
  ** general stuff **, 
  * better physics, 
  * better ai, 
  * better graphics, 
  * better performance, 
  * less bugs, 
  * better landscapes, 
  ** immersion **, 
  * what 's with the fucking handholding ? 
  remove essential from npcs . 
  okay , so basically if the npc is related to some quest , he should have protection from other threads like dragons , vampires and random bandits . 
  but if the played wants to kill that npc the game should allow it and the player needs to face the consequence of killing an important character . 
  * fix the goddamn fake lights , i remember in skyrim we did n't need fucking torches because everything was so clear .
