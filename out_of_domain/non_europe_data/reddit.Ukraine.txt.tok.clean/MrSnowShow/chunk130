  calling a nazi everyone you do n't agree with is not how to argue . 
  `` b-b-but my 30 years of experience ! '', 
  comunist, 
   because it is . 
  you have no idea what you 're talking about . 
  / r9k / made pepe mainstream and of course / pol / made their own versions . 
   many racist and juvenile things he said during the campaign ? 
  can you enlighten me on which racist things he said during the campaign ? 
  he said the ** concept of climate change ** is a hoax by the chinese . 
  as in we 're fucking ourselves with regulations over what could be false while china/india/etc just laugh and keep polluting . 
  remember when it was all about global warming , how there will be no more ice in greenland by 2015 and all that bullshit ? 
  now the narrative changed to climate change . 
  note that i am not a climate change denier but many past predictions were flat out wrong , just like brexit polls , just like trump polls . 
  msm has become a propaganda rather than an actual news source . 
   [ are you being serious ? 
  ] ( http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/093/532/f02.png ), 
  that is how you look . 
  if he 's so racist why you are unable to give me at least 1 instance of him being racist ? 
   prior to the campaign he spent years attacking obama 's nationality , claiming he was born in kenya and therefore should n't be eligible to be president . 
  the emphasis of these conspiracy theories is him being born ** outside ** the us thus not able to be president . 
  it 's not about ** where ** he was born , be it kenya , syria , france , norway , russia , whatever . 
  that is not the issue . 
  they do not have anything against kenya . 
  stop assuming it 's racism just because a black population country is mentioned . 
   he has said that he wants to see stop and frisk applied in cities like chicago though it has been ruled unconstitutional and is a policing strategy that focuses directly on blacks and hispanics . 
  you know that despite being 13 % of population , black communities are responsible for ~ 50 % of the murders , according to doj ( and no , facts are not racist ) . 
  i agree that stop and frisk targets minorities and generalizes them unfairly but if a small amount of population is responsible for so many murders then obviously they will be targeted more , it 's also their fault of this outcome . 
  it 's not about them being black or hispanic . 
  it 's about people who do street-like crimes that majority is black or hispanic . 
  just like crimes such as tax dodging are done by mostly whites . 
   hen there 's the ` mexico is sending rapists ' thing , which admittedly was used mostly without the context of his entire statement by the media and clinton campaign to smear him . 
  thank you . 
  he 's once again telling the truth , many criminals come from across the border . 
  and in the 60 minutes interview he explained that it 's his priority to get these people out , estimated at 2 or 3 million . 
   lastly the ban on muslims entering the country, 
  it has evolved into extreme vetting by countries of terrorism, 
   well i 'm sure you 're probably already aware , but russia pays people to undermine political discussion, 
   just know some of them are actual paid trolls from russia . 
  that is complete bullshit . 
  it is just a move by the left because they actually have a company called correct the record which got a 6 million dollar budget to go shitpost pro-clinton on social media and reddit , 4chan , etc. . . 
  [ ctr is a real company and they state their purpose on their website . 
  ] ( http://correctrecord.org/about/ ), 
  `` russian trolls '' is just a baseless way for them to defend . 
  the point of those conspiracy theories was about him not being american thus not eligible to be president . 
  it 's not about ** where ** he was born , it 's about being born outside the us . 
  stop assuming it 's racism just because a black country is mentioned . 
  that natasha bertrand that wrote the article is a vocal anti-trump . 
  it 's as if you wrote the article . 
  once again , there is no evidence of any `` paid russian trolls '' while clinton had 6 million of online shilling and ctr website has this info . 
  during the campaign what he talked about obama was that he was a crappy president and obamacare is a disaster . 
  __ not __ `` who else thinks obama is from kenya ? 
  yeah vote for me '', 
   it was pure racism, 
  conspiracy theories about obama being born outside the us is not racism . 
  you just assume it 's racism because of kenya . 
  if it was ` obama was born in sweden/spain/poland / white country ' you would n't call it racist . 
  vaermina 's daedric quest . 
  i played on max difficulty but only after having the `` full build '' and all my custom spells and enchanted apparel . 
  magic is overpowered , and so is alchemy . 
  only way is to read patch notes by yourself, 
  what exactly do you have in mind ? 
  if it is some simples value changes , ex : lowering breton 's 50 % magic resist to 25 % then you can easily do it yourself using the construction set . 
  [ shivering isles spoiler ] ( #s `` towards the end of the questline you get to fight yourself too '' ), 
  you still do n't get it . 
  it 's about him being born outside the us . 
  the country where he supposedly is from is irrelevant . 
  you 're just assuming it 's racist because kenya is an african country . 
  would the conspiracy say obama was born in switzerland you would n't call it racist . 
   destruction is awful though . 
  it is n't , custom dot is the key . 
  my custom combo of weakness mix + damage mix one shotted everything within a 10 ft radius at default difficulty . 
   donald trump calling judge 's professionalism into question due to his race ( hispanic judge ), 
  ** reminder : ** mexico is not a race . 
  he simply said that the judge was treating him unfairly in court and that it could be due to him building a wall ( which got a lot of mexicans pissed ) and him being a pround mexican ( which is nothing wrong ) could affect the treatment in court and many lawyers told him that the case could be done with a long time ago . 
   donald trump insults parents of slain muslim soldier and ascribes grieving mother 's silence as subservience, 
  ** reminder : ** islam is not a race . 
  his son died in a war that hillary supported and he comes in and plays the baiting role that the dnc had him to do . 
  how exactly did he insult him ? 
   his professional career has been littered with allegations and lawsuits alleging discrimination . 
  he settled charges brought by the justice department related to housing for primarily black and hispanic minorities . 
  that happened in 1972 , that is over 40 years ago and the case was settled as ' a minor settlement without admitting any guilt ' . 
   he was one of the loudest and longest proponents of the birther movement . 
  how is the birther movement racist ? 
  the issue is him being born ** outside ** the us and thus not able to be president , not * where * he was born . 
  you just assume it 's racist because an african country , kenya is mentioned . 
  if the conspiracy theory was that he was born in finland , you would n't call it racist . 
   he was endorsed by the kkk and did n't disavow them until being asked a number of times . 
  being supported by racists does _ not _ make him a racist . 
  he does not represent them or any of their ideals . 
  also why are you linking me the new york times articles when they [ gave veto power to hillary 's campaign ] ( https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/4213 ) and thus posted all year anti-trump , pro-clinton articles . 
  why do you think their latest quarterly profits dropped by 95.7 % ? 
  they 're a propaganda machine . 
  dude , better graphics require better hardware . 
  how are you expecting to have pretty graphics mods when you ca n't even run the vanilla game on medium ? 
  look , people are tired of everything being racist , everything is sexist , everything is offensive . 
  trump says what people think would get them in trouble of this cancerous political correctness but he does n't give a fuck and says how it is . 
   blatant hate speech should be banned, 
  ca n't have free speech without hate speech . 
  learn to deal with it . 
  and what you call `` hate speech '' could simply be an opinion you do n't agree with .
