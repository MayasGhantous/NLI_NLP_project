  you 're asking to ban opinions you do n't agree with . 
  that is censorship . 
   it is almost 2017 . 
  we all know what is right and wrong . 
  i do n't think you represent everybody . 
  if we all knew what is right and wrong there would be no arguments . 
  twitter , a safe space for terrorists and had #rapemelania trending . 
  problem is what you think is `` hate speech '' for others could be simply the truth . 
  oh and saying `` b-but it 's [ current year ] '' is not an argument . 
  * trump wo n't run for president, 
  * trump candidacy is a joke, 
  * trump 's ceiling is 15 %, 
  * trump 's ceiling is 20 %, 
  * trump 's ceiling is 35 %, 
  * trump 's ceiling is 40 %, 
  * trump will never get the nomination, 
  * trump will never flip florida, 
  * trump will never flip pennsylvania, 
  * trump has a 5 % chance at winning the election, 
  * trump will never make mexico pay for the wall < -- you are here, 
  i felt like almost every oblivion quest was hand crafted while skyrim 's most of them were just a generic scenario . 
  [ this post from gamefaqs sort of explains it ] ( http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/615804-the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim/63556974 ) i quote :, 
   ** oblivion ** : some women are robbing and blackmailing married men . 
  i need you to find the suspects , let them try to seduce you , and catch them in the act . 
   ** skyrim : ** some women are robbing and blackmailing married men . 
  i need you to go into this dungeon full of draugr and kill them . 
   ** oblivion : ** these ghosts are haunting my ship . 
  here 's a silver sword . 
  can you kill them for me ? 
   ** skyrim : ** these ghosts are haunting my ship . 
  here 's the location of a dungeon full of draugr . 
  go and find an item from there to help me drive them away . 
   ** oblivion : ** climb into the well out back and fetch me a ring that sunk to the bottom . 
  jokes on you !, 
  that ring is going to make you drown . 
   ** skyrim : ** a bandit stole my ring , man . 
  can you go into this dungeon and get it back for me ? 
  oh , and watch out for the draugr . 
   ** oblivion : ** guess what ? 
  you 're trapped on an island where hunters hunt people for fun , and you 're the prey . 
  have fun !, 
   ** skyrim : ** some guy is running a game on an island where people hunt other people for fun . 
  word has it he 's in a dungeon nearby looking for treasure to fund his game . 
  go and kill him . 
  what ? 
  you want to see this game for yourself ? 
  nonsense , the dungeon will be far more convenient . 
  off you go . 
  try not to trip over any draugr . 
  oh and oblivion 's guilds were at a completely different level than skyrim 's . 
  edit : some more input of my own, 
  ** oblivion ** : my husband is trapped inside a dream , you 're gon na have to wear an amulet and go inside his dreams . 
  however you 'll be handicapped inside , good luck !, 
  ** skyrim ** '' : my husband is trapped inside a dream . 
  go into this [ generic dungeon ] and retrieve a cleansing potion . 
  ** oblivion : ** word is there 's a rogue mage killing merchants along the gold road , i need you to pose as a merchant and bait him . 
  do n't worry , there are 2 battle mages that will guard you . 
  go into this inn and sleep there , if anybody asks , you 're just a traveling merchant . 
  ** skyrim : ** word is there 's a rogue mage killing merchants along the gold road . 
  there 's a fort nearby which we suspect is where he 's hiding . 
  go there and kill him . 
  i 've been thinking about this for months now . 
  it all comes to the `` special snowflake entitled millennial '' attitude . 
  being a customer is a __ privilege __ not a right . 
  if the company refuses to serve you for whatever reason , it 's their right to do so . 
  have you not learned anything from this election ? 
  you 're still going with the `` everything is racist '' narrative ? 
  after brexit , after trump you maybe you should stop labeling everything as racist and start to rethink your priorities but nah just keep calling everybody racist that might work some day amirite ? 
  [ here 's a liberal like you explaining why you 're doing it wrong ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glg9g7bcjks ), 
   why is trump campaigning in wisconsin and michigan ?? 
  you know that christianity had a reformation in the xvi century that removed the most intolerant and violent parts of it ? 
  islam did not have a reformation . 
  which is why it 's so intolerant and violent . 
  and how does that invalidate that `` islam is not a religion of peace '' ? 
  self restrain ? 
   because the sub 's custom css was made ages ago and is totally borked, 
  the css is pretty good thought , my favorite thing are the `` submit '' buttons with the trackpoint in the middle . 
  the banner thing is just a minor issue fixed by justing adding a ` repeat ` option . 
  edit :, 
  all you have to do is, 
  1 . go into http://reddit.com/r/thinkpad/about/stylesheet, 
  2 . search for this line ` background : # 2a2b2e url ( % % headerimg % % ) no-repeat fixed 68 % 0 % ; `, 
  3 . change ` no-repeat ` to ` repeat `, 
  reddit is generally fond of ugly tattoos . 
  i honestly never seen any good one and i 've been in this shithole for almost 3 years . 
   puerto rico does n't have many of the privileges states have , such as representation in congress . 
  they do have representatives but they can not vote . 
  why would n't a 2010 game work on 2016 laptop ? 
  i am retard , i did n't get that one . 
  i liked this one too ( to spez ), 
   you do tolerate hate-speech . 
  you have proven that . 
  you just pick and choose who you allow to be berated . 
  i ca n't believe some people treat the huffington shitpost as an actual news source . 
  it 's allowed in / r / [ redacted ] . 
  oh because nbc and cnn especially were really legitimate right ? 
  and totally not trying to push a left wing agenda throughout the election . 
  here 's cnn where they said for example that [ it 's illegal to possess wikileaks and that everything we learn from it must come from cnn ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dcatg9qy_a ) . 
  what 's up with this `` trump will start ww3 '' meme ? 
  the man said he wants to restore relations with russia and syria also called him to discuss alliance ?
