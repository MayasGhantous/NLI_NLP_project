  and he does know what he talking about . 
  for example , nobody talked or probably knew about how china manipulates their own currency to come on top with trade deals but trump has been talking about this since the 80s and how the us is loosing more and more money in trade . 
  [ he predicted 9/11 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ruxcv71ic ) , was against the war in iraq . 
  stop underestimating him . 
  i do n't think so . 
  the man has won the white house !, 
  he was an ** ex - ** goldman sachs dude . 
  do n't you think it 's reasonable that he needs to appoint somebody who got experience with money to the treasury no ? 
   however , as a businessman , he has not done well . 
  when you are beaten out on a roi by paris hilton , you can really not claim to be a brilliant businessman . 
  he has his business ran for decades . 
  the 2014 profit was pretty good . 
  he lost a lot of money in the 90s like pretty much every big business ( almost 1 billion ) and managed to come back , wrote a book about it . 
   talking about how china manipulates their own currency ? 
  yeah , it 's pretty well known , here 's probably where donald saw something about it : http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/15/opinion/15krugman.html, 
  you linked me a 2010 article , he was talking about the issue since the 80s !, 
  [ here 's a video that has some interview compilations ] ( https://youtu.be/ocabt_o0ysm?t=2m54s ) at the 2:54 mark he talks more specifically . 
   so stop thinking that the paid meme-magic shills over at the_donald, 
  there are no paid shills . 
  the only paid shills were hillary 's ctr and they state in their [ about page ] ( http://correctrecord.org/about/ ) that their purpose is to defend hillary on various social media . 
  also / r/newaccountsinpolitics, 
  the rest of the sub looks crappier than the old css thought . 
  the issue that the previous css were n't hard to fix . 
  i loved the old theme and hate this new bland one , lacks as / u/ibmthink said , the special touch , missing the red elements . 
  the issues that the old one had were easy fixable but oh well . 
   what 's wrong with this new one ? 
  feels like naut but without any thinkpad stuff . 
  the old one was surprisingly good and had that nice red vibe around it . 
  i usually see it as blue with a white cross but it looks really awesome the other way , imagine white background with 4 blue triangles . 
  having experience ! = corrupt . 
  trump does not receive money for political favors . 
  once again , he is ex-goldman sachs . 
  unlike hillary that gave paid speeches disguised as bribes while us senator , nobody gets paid so much to speak . 
   dude did n't get rich by turning down money, 
  he declined presidential salary . 
  also his donations during the campaign average at $ 61 per person . 
  he got like ~ $ 18000 from wall street unlike + $ 40 million to hillary . 
   he declined the salary because it 's less than what he gets from his businesses he refuses to sell to a blind 3rd party to eliminate conflicts of interest . 
  why would he sell decades of what he dedicated his whole life to a blind 3rd party ? 
  he is now taking care of legal shit to pass the business to his children . 
   you mean those donations he spent on paintings of himself ? 
  lol, 
  that was in 2007, 
   it 's not like he 's ever given any indication he cares bout ethics . 
  dude dedicated decades of his life to the business . 
  why would he throw all of that away for a maximum of 8 years ? 
  just pass to the children while president ... which is what he is doing . 
  also why are you downvoting based on opinion ? 
  you should really start a cinema career since you 're so good at projecting . 
  what a little faggot we have for ceo . 
  gets mad at a community for not sharing his political beliefs so decided to destroy reddit 's integrity ( now nobody knows if what somebody posted is actually what they posted ) in a childish shitty `` troll '' attempt . 
   i am surprised your solution was not generic . 
  that is because they are biased liberals . 
  they do n't agree with t_d so they fuck with it . 
  ets also uses stickies to get to / r/all but they do n't care since ets follows their narrative . 
  it 's disgusting, 
   i myself engaged in conversation in t_d , in support of bernie , and i ended up banned . 
  well their rules clearly state that you should post in favor of trump . 
  i do n't agree with this but they have their reasons to do so i guess . 
   i think / u/spez is still letting his feelings get in the way of correct decisions . 
  it 's clear as day that he and the mod team have definitely a left wing political bias . 
  leaked admin chats revealed that one of the admins was literally a paid correct the record shill ( the ones that flooded / r/politics as you mentioned ) . 
  more red !, 
  remember the trackpoint between submit buttons that made it look like a thinkpad keyboard ? 
   it 's not because of t_d 's ideas , it 's because of it 's behavior . 
  how can you not see that ? 
  purposely spamming the front page with post after post meant to antagonize people . 
  it 's not the front page for fucks sake . 
  front page is what you 're subscribed to . 
  you probably meant / r/all . 
  but that is reddit 's fault not don 's . 
  t_d users are more united and much more inclined to upvote than others . 
  the sticky to / r/all tactic is used in more place than just t_d but only t_d gets special treatment for * some * reason . 
  imagine the outrage if in 2012 obama 's sub was banned because too many posts got upvoted and reached front page, 
  this post by spez is disgusting , you can summarize it by this :, 
  * i fucked up hard , got caught editing comments and thus destroying site 's integrity , so t_d now gets a filter from / r/all and their stickies ca n't no longer go to the top *, 
   you upvote things specifically to bring them to the top of / r/all, 
  upvote shit for the same reason people upvote shit on other subs . 
  reaching r/all is just a consequence of reddit 's algorithm , which was changed by the way . 
   nobody feels bad for you after you 've antagonized and spewed vitriol all over the site for months . 
  is it fair ? 
  but hardly anyone cares because you guys are assholes . 
  when bernie shit reached r/all it was fine . 
  because it fits your narrative . 
  but once a different opinion steps is you cry and cry shut it down delete this reeeeeeeeee raycis raycis ... really ? 
   oh you guys are just being fucking crybabies . 
  see above . 
  you ca n't even handle a fucking different opinion before crying to ban don . 
   lol whatever he played a joke which , while i admit was n't a good decision , is not that big of a deal . 
  take your whining to voat . 
  it 's not a big deal because you do n't agree with t_d ideas . 
  editing user 's posts is not okay . 
  fuck off with your double standards . 
  td is a / pol / colony redpilling normies , and has done a pretty good job . 
   come on you 're not fooling anyone . 
  it 's right in the titles of the posts on your sub ... `` get this to the top '' . 
  we can read , you know ? 
  who gives a shit ? 
  reddit allows it to happen and it gets taken advantage of . 
  the sub is all high energy especially during the last weeks when everything was so important .
