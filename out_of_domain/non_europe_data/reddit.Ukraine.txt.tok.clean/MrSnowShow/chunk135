  in what fantasy world you live in ? 
  why is he getting condemned for pointing out issues that he wants to fix ? 
   the rapists comment, 
  he said criminals ( rapist , drug lords , murderers , etc. . . ) are coming in through mexico which is why we need a strong border . 
  it 's a true statement . 
  what is wrong with it ? 
   making fun of a disabled guy, 
  he did not , he did that arms wiggly impression many times https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csab3ynizh4, 
   attacking a dead soldiers family, 
  what kind of attack ? 
   attacking mccain 's status as a war hero, 
  controversial true . 
  he said `` i do n't like people who got captured '' . 
   attacking a model based on her looks, 
  what the fuck ? 
  being a model is all about looks . 
   grabbing women by the pussy comment, 
  private banter from 11 years ago . 
  you know what context is ? 
  he said `` once you 're a star they ** let you ** do anything you want , grab em by the pussy '' . 
  emphasis on ** let you ** part . 
   attacking women on their appearance, 
  yes because everybody is beautiful right ? 
   can you imagine the outrage from the right if obama did any one of those things ? 
  this is where you wrong . 
  he did not do those things as msm reported , you yourself said that msm is left biased . 
  stop buying their bullshit and do your own research . 
  i 'll give you an example . 
  i saw on facebook feed that trump is going to deport 2 or 3 million ** immigrants ** yet when you open up the article it says '' ** illegal ** immigrants and if you go to the actual interview it 's actually 2 to 3 million ** criminal ** illegal immigrants . 
   he never actually gave any evidence for most of his claims , said why things are bad , very little about how specifically he would change them . 
  just `` everything 's shit , but i 'll fix it '' . 
  you have not been paying attention then . 
  he talked about china 's manipulation of currency and the increasing us-china trade deficit , nafta 's disaster for usa manufacturing , bad trade deals and deals in general with foreign nations , rising national debt and other many issues . 
   played on people 's fears and made a bunch of empty promises . 
  as we 're talking he 's not even president yet but already saved ~ 1000 jobs from leaving to mexico . 
   i do . 
  i watch and read his words myself . 
  i stand by all the things i listed being valid negative stories . 
  i do n't really feel like diving into every single one of them . 
  i addressed every single one of the issues yet you just deny . 
  but i do n't condemn you since it 's highly unlikely that i can dispel over 1 year of msm lies in one reddit comment . 
   all he 's ever said is that things are happening , and things are bad . 
  no specifics . 
  small words , no details . 
  do you think he 's going to start giving foreign diplomacy lectures and theories on his rallies ? 
  rallies are not a place for that . 
   not buying it . 
  only one of those examples was similar . 
  nothing i can do about it . 
  it 's debatable but i really think it 's just him being him . 
   `` who wrote that ? 
  did hillary 's scriptwriters write it ? '', 
   pretty much implying a mourning father of a soldier is a paid shill . 
  it was a lame line as weak as `` stronger together '' slogan and her entire campaign . 
  his son died in a war that hillary clinton voted for yet he 's standing there next to her . 
  but i can say that wife thing was unnecessary ( but not offensive ) , they were trying to bait him and succeeded . 
   the point is he 's on twitter at 3am talking about sex tapes and attacking her personally like a child, 
  i think you need to know some things about alicia machado . 
  they accuse trump of being judgmental of beauty on a beauty contest that he owns ( miss universe ) . 
  yet if you [ watch the interview yourself ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppxsaoxzimg ) he 's actually being very nice to her about her weight and sort of defending her . 
  she admitted being a getaway driver from a murder scene , dismissed it as `` everybody has a past '' . 
  i do n't think everybody 's past involves being an accomplice in a murder but maybe that 's just me . 
  [ here 's the video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=we8onvlwshg ) . 
  she lied about trump bullying her into an eating disorder yet she said publicly in the 90s that she had the disorder prior to running for miss universe [ video here , 5:07 minute mark ] ( https://youtu.be/bj2bk7bp7be?t=5m7s ), 
  also she appeared on a sex tape while msm media called it a `` risque scene '' despite being clearly , a sex tape . 
   you fucking kidding me ? 
  he 's talking about how they wo n't say no because you 're rich . 
  it 's disgusting . 
  you forgot the key words , ** let you do anything ** . 
  they ** let ** him , as in _ allowing _ , _ conceding _ hmm ? 
  these women make their choice by allowing a rich man to grab them . 
  what happened to her body her choice ? 
   what does that even mean ? 
  he 's an asshole who goes low and slings personal insults at people for their looks or whatever else . 
  he does not have a politician filter and says what many are afraid to say because of the political correctness culture we have that everything is offensive , raycis , sexis , etc. . . you 're talking as if he insults everybody out of nowhere , [ they also insult him and he insults back ] ( http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/ws/624/amz/worldservice/live/assets/images/2015/12/12/151212111857_trump_vs_prince_talal.jpg ), 
   he speaks in the normal political speak, 
  absolutely not . 
  he 's not even a politician , as in all talk no action . 
  as i said earlier he is n't even a president yet and already crafted a deal to keep jobs in the country , like he promised . 
  yes, 
  it does not make me want to upgrade because i never used an ips panel before . 
  and the sideways viewing angles are n't bad . 
  i know the theory ( brighter , better viewing angles , colors etc. . . ) and i 'm sure once i upgrade eventually i will be disgusted by tn panels . 
   where do you think it needs more red ? 
  just look at the old theme , it had red bars and lines everywhere . 
  current one lacks a lot of contrast . 
  isis on suicide watch, 
   i 'd sticky it , but mods can only sticky posts they make themselves ... 
  what ? 
  i can stick other posts in my sub just fine . 
   the same thing happened with the t410s and all users got a fix as well . 
  what happened with the t410 ? 
  damn , sometimes i envy the patriotism . 
  almost makes me want to migrate ( legally ) . 
  not even assumed office and already saving jobs . 
  truly under budget and ahead of schedule . 
  they 're doing a sort of strawman on his promises . 
  he said that he will lower taxes and regulations to make business more friendly and create more jobs , but if companies __ still decide to leave __ there will be consequence such as taxing their products coming from mexico or other places . 
  sanders is saying that trump promises to tax companies but is doing the opposite , which is completely wrong . 
   b-b-but he is so cool !,
