  he fist bumps janitors and did you see the hilarious `` obama out '' xd best president ever !!, 
  just like in nature , bright and intense colors are the universal symbol of `` poisonous , stay away '' for animals , for us humans they dye their hard . 
  thank you sjws . 
  material design before it was cool, 
   we 're not going to get anywhere, 
  i disagree , we are making a little bit of progress . 
  for example you know now that alicia machado ( the supposedly poor woman that trump attacked ) lied about trump bullying her into an eating disorder , was accomplice in a murder and was clearly involved in a sex tape that hillary accused of being a `` conspiracy theory '' . 
  next time when you 'll criticize trump you wont mention alicia machado since you know the facts now , that is a little victory for me . 
   this is way oversimplified . 
  this implication is that if you have money and power , you can do what you want to women and they wo n't say no . 
  that is the woman 's choice . 
  there are these women called gold diggers that like rich men . 
  they make their choice to involve with rich men . 
  why are you condemning their free will ? 
   and think about the kind of women who might have been the ones to be grabbed or kissed : employees of his , miss america contestants , other women trying to come up in either show business or otherwise . 
  you 're speculating at this point . 
   and plenty of women have come forward to say that trump groped them and kissed them against their will . 
  you will probably dismiss them all for reasons like not coming out sooner or being opportunists, 
  all i know is that they announced all at the same time once a new batch of dirt on hillary came out and dropped all charges once election is over . 
  one of those women ( an ex-pornstar i think ) opened a store a day before announcing that she was touched by trump . 
   all of which have easy refutations if you look into the reasons why women do n't speak out about sexual assault and harassment, 
  same goes in reverse . 
  many women abuse the `` rape '' claim . 
   but your average locker room talk does not mean talking about using your status to just take what you want from women without asking because `` they 'll let you '' . 
  i still do n't get why is it hard to understand that there is nothing wrong if they __ let him __ do it . 
  even if he literally starts kisisng out of nowhere ( i believe he did n't mean it literally ) . 
  barack obama sends military weapons to taiwan and naval ship and choppers between china and taiwan yet a trump angered china and will cause a ww3 for receiving a congratulations phone call ? 
   we tried to warn you trump supporters . 
  you do n't know shit . 
  you said he 'd never run , you 'd said he 'd never get the nomination , you 'd said clinton would go for a landslide win , you said countless times that he is finished and there __ absolutely no path __ for 270 , you 'd said that he will not keep his promises yet he just saved ~ 1000 jobs before taking office . 
  now tell me why i should believe when you got it wrong every time for 1 year and half, 
   yes the phone call is far more dangerous than the weapons ,, 
  do you even read what you write ? 
  there is right now a ship with a chopper and all that between china and taiwan complete with a `` press here to start ww3 button '' yet a `` congratulations ! '', 
  phone call is more dangerous ? 
  no wonder that you got pretty much got it [ completely wrong ] ( http://truthfeed.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/xscreen-shot-2016-11-09-at-9.13.24-am.png.pagespeed.ic.hz0rrhjq-e.png ) about the whole election happenings because you seem to live in a completely different reality . 
  go against clinton in / r/hillaryclinton and you get banned, 
  go against sanders in / r/sandersforpresident and you get banned, 
  yet / r/the _ donald which clearly state in their rules that you should post if supporting trump and questions should go into / r/askthe _ donald must be a multicultural critic accepting all viewpoint upvoting sub ? 
   that just makes me so ... happy . 
  so you 're a commie that hates free speech and advertises censorship . 
  do you even know what is the first amendment ? 
   listen man , you dont know anything about me so how about you dont make assumptions, 
  when i said _ you _ i meant this sub as a whole . 
  completely inaccurate coverage of the election . 
  i thought you 'd finally learn but i guess not, 
   g-g-go read a book !, 
  educate yourself !, 
  not an argument . 
   i understand that you want to defend your boy but this is a giant fuck up . 
  i do n't you understand that it was a `` congratulations ! '', 
  phone call . 
  you do n't need to be a master foreign policy expert to process this information . 
  once again , sub got everything wrong covering the election . 
  this is just the continuation . 
  nothing will change after this phone call . 
  get over it . 
  i understand you want to criticize don at every turn ( just like criticizing him for saving jobs ) but focus on the real issues , and not a `` gratz '' phone call . 
   this is how they always deal with the truth, 
  i do n't think you 're in a position to talk about the truth . 
  do i need to remind you that this sub went through, 
  * his candidacy is a joke, 
  * he will never get the nomination, 
  * texas is a swing state, 
  * he has absolutely no road for 270, 
  and a bunch of complete bullshit in between . 
  you got it wrong , all year long , and you keep getting it wrong . 
  get it through your thick skull, 
   changing that policy would be a delicate and risky undertaking at the best of times, 
  `` changing that policy '' ? 
  nobody talked about changing any policy . 
  it was a `` congratulations '' phone call . 
  just that . 
  nothing more . 
  do you understand this ? 
   by making that phone call . 
  he did not . 
  he _ received _ a `` gratz '' call from taiwan 's president . 
  point still remains . 
  the president of taiwan wanted to congratulate trump 's victory . 
   and trump agreed to a phone call not understanding the diplomatic consequences and how this will color future us-china policy, 
  i 'm pretty sure he 's aware about taiwan vs chinese taipei issue . 
  once again , nothing will come out of a `` gratz ! '', 
  phone call when there are us navy forces between china and taiwan . 
  read again , i said, 
   nothing will come out, 
  also , stop downvoting different opinions that actually contribute to a discussion . 
  it does nothing other than being an inconvenience to post since you get a 10 minute `` silence '' between each post . 
  why would it ? 
  i said it earlier and i say it again , there are __ us navy forces __ between china and taiwan right now and us sold military equipment to them yet a `` congratulations on your victory mr. trump '' is supposed to do something ? 
  if you were china what would upset you more ? 
  + having us navy a few miles away from you defending an independent territory while telling you `` oh taiwan ? 
  totally a part of china '', 
  + a `` congratulations on your victory mr. trump '' phone call from taiwan, 
   all you guys do is pull things out of context and try and cover your ears . 
  really ? 
  you say that but your next phrase is, 
   i do n't care what else you have to say, 
  are you _ sure _ that it is not actually you that is covering your ears ? 
   who gives a flying fuck that he won a popularity contest when we 're discussing his foreign policy,
