  more wealthy people voted for trump you dumb fuck . 
   broken down by income bracket , 52 % of voters earning less than $ 50,000 a year -- who make up 36 % of the electorate -- voted for clinton , and 41 % for trump . 
   but among the 64 % of american voters who earn more than $ 50,000 a year , 49 % chose trump , and 47 % clinton . 
   link a credible source, 
   i-i d-don ' t believe it, 
  that 's some shitty denial attitude you got there . 
  yes . 
  only liberals are capable of rational thought ... 
  just stop with the `` i 'm better than you attitude '' already , it makes you look like an arrogant prick . 
  good idea . 
  i 'm pretty sure if you talk to trump supporters like that they will definitely change their mind and vote in your interests next election cycle . 
  you 're so smart . 
  you need to watch something , it 's just 6 minutes, 
   the uneducated in middle america elected a [ citation needed ] [ citation needed ] [ citation needed ] [ citation needed ] [ citation needed ], 
  and even if that was all true , what does that have to do with corruption ? 
   he 'll use words like transparency and diversity and all will be forgiven, 
  this made me so mad . 
  i watched as the faggot dodged the question 3 or 4 times using the same memorized 15 second speech and kept getting away with it, 
   but it actually tracks better for multitouch , and looking at the config on windows , i should be able to define as many hotkey areas with 4 finger detection , which is better than most other current non tp laptops . 
  am i missing something here ? 
  it 's not about the trackpad , it 's about the 3 __ trackpoint __ buttons that were turned into one . 
  lenovo actually acknowledged this as a fuck up by them and fixed in the next series . 
  as for the rest of complains there are 3 things that i and many dislike in x 40 series and after . 
  they completely removed media keys as you noticed . 
  at least on x230 they moved them from arrow keys to the top as f keys . 
  it 's really stupid why would they just remove your ability to control music player `` remotely '' . 
  complete removal of dedicated microphone mute , volume mute and volume up and down . 
  made insert into fn + end . 
  absolutely disgusting . 
  in my opinion the x240 is one of the shittiest choices of the x series , only reason to get it is for 1080p but you do n't even have that . 
  if you have a north american goty ps3 copy of the game , you __ can not __ cure vampirism because of this bug . 
  the european edition has a workaround , if you switch your system language to spanish or german , she will then accept the bloodgrass , you can then save and put your language back to english and continue on with the quest . 
  push the pin up, 
  press a button to keep it up before it falls, 
  repeat 1 and 2 for all other pins, 
  where 's the difficulty ? 
  as others have said pins sometimes stay longer while sometimes immediately drop . 
  the key is to keep juggling them up until they stay for a little longer which is when you should press x. 
   trump is a racist . 
  how is trump racist ? 
  you 're not letting me dodge the question !!!, 
   he said he 'd threaten them with taxes if they refused . 
  that is wrong . 
  he said he would tax them as a consequence of leaving , not before leaving . 
   because making the richer even richer through tax breaks is better while the middle to lower class will have to continue with their taxes, 
  wrong . 
  he is cutting taxes for both businesses and middle class, 
   what about him calling taiwan to put a fucking hotel there when we have an agreement not to acknowledge them, 
  wrong again . 
  he received a `` congratulations '' phone call from the president of taiwan . 
   her response would have been, 
  that 's not how it works, 
  why ? 
  how 's high school going ? 
  if anything i think it actually helped him . 
  it just showed that he __ legally __ paid what he was supposed to . 
  found one of my old screenshots of my vampire . 
  / pol / is the new / b /, 
  b-b-but 30 gorillion people are being killed by western policies every day !, 
  i really , really liked the subtle airhorn because it reflected how subtly tucker managed to weasel in those in the middle of a serious conversation . 
  you wo n't loose the `` divine crusader '' title in the `` factions '' page if that is what you 're talking about . 
  what will happen is that you wo n't be able to use crusader 's armor and sometimes other npcs will comment, 
   i used to think you were a hero . 
  a holy knight and all that . 
  i guess i should have known better, 
   i used to admire you . 
  but it turns out you 're just a sinner like all the rest of us, 
  what you can do is , after going _ a bit _ out of character and completing the db questline , is to do the pilgrimage again and it will restore your infamy to 0 . 
  i know this guy only from the rap montages . 
  why is he a liar ? 
  ac3 had a really good combat system . 
  the kill moves were brutal and the sound effects were top notch , it made you feel like you really just stabbed that guy and clashed his sword , etc. . . 
  like seriously , fire up ac3 , equip the hidden blades and open them a few times . 
  the sound effect and animation is so good that you can almost feel the energy as the blades come out of the holster . 
  i loved every bit of combat when playing ac3 . 
  tucker is causing massive meltdowns after a brief dialogue . 
  is this real life ? 
  the thing with these idiots is they always try to soften up their tweet somehow . 
  i see this happen on many tucker interviews where the guest says something incredibly partisan but once on the show they do not answer for it . 
  like that `` professor '' when on the show he said he wanted to promote `` political discussion '' but in reality he wished he 'd done more anti-trump for his college essentially turning it into a safe space . 
  do you think he 'd just full his cabinet with truck drivers and waitresses ? 
  he appoints successful people , which consequentially are rich . 
   he 's not doing ____________ he promised, 
  he is n't even president yet . 
   yes , and do you think they got rich by protecting their workers and caring for people ? 
  probably not . 
  we 'll see what will he do with them , politicians are all talk no action so let 's see about businessmen . 
   he 's already been saying how the `` lock her up '' ` plays nice ' on the campaign trail , but not actually going to do it . 
  clinton foundation is still under fbi investigation so she may still get locked up . 
  he ca n't ` drain the swamp ' while he 's not in office . 
  and no , ` drain the swamp ' does not mean filling his cabinet with truck drivers and bicycle mechanics . 
  8ch 's / leftypol / is the one organizing it . 
  did you read his 100 day plan ? 
  to put it simply he wants to pass various laws that prevent various outside influences to us politics . 
  he ca n't do that while he 's not president . 
   `` i am not a racist , i am a realist , and realistically blacks commit the majority of the crimes . '', 
  what 's wrong with this statement ? 
  it 's true and data comes from the department of justice . 
  you need to first acknowledge that there is a problem in order to fix it . 
  are you somehow implying that black people ca n't be racist ?
