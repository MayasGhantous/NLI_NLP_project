  you do n't, 
   then get judged . 
  why do you care ? 
   trump says racist shit, 
  can you please show me something racist he said ? 
  i kept hearing this for like a year and half yet never heard him say anything racist and i 've been following the elections since dnc . 
   bunch of huffington shitpost and nyt articles, 
   #guys hitler kkk hitler kkk hitler kkk !!!!!, 
  reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee, 
  nice way to ruin a potential good post, 
  look i 'm not going into all the trouble of debunking shit bait articles `` le kkk trump hitler kkk hitler trump '' and i already did address many points in my other comments . 
  1 comment of mine gets +10 replies and i can only comment on 10 minute intervals due to downvoting . 
   the justification was `` mexico is n't a race '', 
  i think you need to go back to 3rd grade where assignments consist of reading a text and answering questions about it ( i.e. 
  interpretation ) because you 're complete shit at it . 
  my argument for him was to take the full quote and context and not just because the words ` mexico ' and ` rapist ' are somewhere nearby , it does n't allow you to ignore whole context and just scream raycism !!!, 
  `` mexico is n't a race '' was just a sidenote , not a justification . 
  investigators are still desperately struggling to understand the motive behind this attack, 
  does this affs screen come with some x200 like ips panels come with some x220/x230/etc ... or x200 never really came with these screens ? 
  while `` shitpost '' here on reddit means `` a bad low-effort post '' , on 4chan it can also mean just `` posting on 4chan '' , not necessarily actually making ` shit ' posts . 
  people there jokingly call their thinkpads `` shitposting machines '' . 
  so this affs comes from the tablet version , right ? 
  * she talks like a truck driver *, 
  did you seriously call a 3rd gen i7 a piece of shit ? 
  is there are name for this syndrome that if it is n't the latest \u2122 and greatest \u2122 of the market and costs + $ 1k then it 's shit ? 
  t601f ? 
  nice . 
  that is my dream machine . 
  4:3 affs screen and a non-failing post 08/08 nvidia chip . 
  yours has a non-failing nvidia chip and 4:3 affs ? 
  it 's another episode of `` pushing liberal agenda thought / r/bestof '' . 
  also you need to be reminded that there is absolutely __ zero __ evidence that the russian government hacked dnc and john podesta 's emails . 
  not in worldnews but one guy told me this, 
   the russian hackers compromised key vote tabulating computers to steal the election . 
  and then trump 's lawyers desperately stopped the recounts in court to keep that fact hidden . 
  all i 'm saying is that there 's no evidence . 
  i do pay attention to the news yet there is no evidence or proof . 
  if you have it then please enlighten me . 
  pardon my skepticism but my point is when you accuse a military powerful foreign government of hacking you need to have at least something to back it up . 
  all i said was the truth which , as of right now , is that there is no evidence . 
  they 're doing what it seems to me with these useless reports is to create such a big pile of papers that it _ looks _ like evidence . 
  did you even read those 2 articles that you posted ? 
  the first one right from the start says :, 
   and though it offers the most detailed official analysis yet of russia 's operations , critics in the cybersecurity community ** say it lacks the still-secret evidence ** needed to persuade skeptics that analysis is true . 
  and the second article is a terrible hackjob and the writer does n't even know what the word `` evidence '' means because he thinks those reports are evidence . 
  the two reports released are basically restatements of what is already of public knowledge . 
  pardon my skepticism but before starting a feud with a powerful foreign nation you need to have at least something . 
  i 'm not asking to release the evidence for public . 
  problem is these reports offer nothing but restatements of what is already known to the public . 
  i do n't think you know what ` evidence ' means . 
   we assess russian president vladimir putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the u.s. presidential election, 
   we further assess putin and the russian government developed a clear preference for president-elect trump . 
  we have high confidence in these judgments, 
  this __ is not evidence __, 
  also :, 
   the report neither assessed `` the impact russian activities had on the outcome of the 2016 election '' nor did it provide details on the evidence underpinning its conclusions, 
  come back when you have real evidence , and when you do have thank you and have a nice day . 
  not fully the first one . 
  i stopped once realized it was just a detailed explanation of how it happened yet sadly no evidence which is what really matters . 
   how can you say the conclusion of us intelligence agencies is not evidence ? 
  them saying `` high confidence '' , `` trump is russia 's favorite '' and restating what is already known is not evidence . 
  look i remember them assuring us that weapons of mass destruction were there when they were not so pardon my skepticism here . 
  you 're assuming the evidence is there yet there is no mention or any details about it which is my original point . 
  releasing reports saying `` high confidence '' among other speculations is not evidence no matter how right it feels to you . 
  i want something more than `` high confidence '' , `` trump is favorite in russia '' , `` we believe russia tried to influence elections by exposing clinton '' etc. . . 
  this is absolutely worthless . 
   the evidence is classified and unavailable to both you and i, 
  i am looking for a totally direct statement and assurance . 
   `` we know __ for a fact __ and have evidence to back it up that the russian government was behind the dnc and john podesta 's email hacks to influence the election '' . 
  but we 're not getting any of that . 
  i do recognize that it 's a very difficult task since cybercrimes are much harder to track . 
  i forgot about the newly released 2nd report ( this friday ? ) . 
  however my original comment is still true . 
  as of right now , there is no evidence so we have to trust these agencies as you said . 
  i already said it earlier but i remember how assured they were that wmds are there so i 'm sorry for wanting a bit more than vague statements . 
  2nd report says that there are highly classified parts that were removed so they 're moving in the right direction , now we need more . 
  sort of . 
  they basically said here we have a document but without all the super secret stuff we ca n't show . 
  i 'm still waiting for a confident assertion that they know __ for a fact __ what happened . 
  you need to watch this to understand, 
  so whenever something good happens with trump people joke around that they ca n't take so much winning . 
  not at all . 
  carrier stayed because of a deal with trump , he literally picked up the phone and called them . 
  some japanese company i ca n't recall decided to invest in us because of trump . 
  and recently ford decided to abandon plans in mexico in good faith because of trump 's pro-business policies . 
  \u0411\u043b\u044f i 've been disc\u043e\u0432ered !, 
  why is the concept of different opinion so alien to you ? 
  that is liberal `` humor '' for you . 
  \u0424\u0430\u043a i 've been discovere\u0434 !, 
  look , just because you do n't like his attitude that does not mean he is not qualified to be president . 
  do n't treat your opinion as fact and the moral high ground . 
  it 's not . 
  ~ ~ the term ` alt-right ' was invented by the clinton campaign . ~ ~, 
  how is that post racist ? 
   on most default subs racist comments are well reviewed, 
  such as ? 
  i think you need to stop labeling people you disagree with as nazis . 
  it 's just 1 stupid meme ... 
   but his aptitude and unwillingness to learn, 
  what does this even mean ?
