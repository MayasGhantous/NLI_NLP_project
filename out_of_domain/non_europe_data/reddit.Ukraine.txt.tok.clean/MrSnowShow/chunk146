  buzzfeed document is fake news , what part did you not understand ? 
  that was the `` go back to univision '' . 
  they seem to kinda all act the same way . 
  i have a right to ask a question i 'm out of order and have n't been called but i 'm special snowflake i have a __ right __ to ask a question . 
  in fact they think they have a right to many things , while in reality it 's a privilege , like immigration for instance . 
  where the hell is the personal attack ? 
  oh i do n't remember that one . 
  there was so much stumping this press conference i might have to rewatch it . 
  that 's reddit ` discussion ' for you . 
  one person makes a usually leftist viewpoint , another agrees , next one maybe make a pun , fast forward a bit and it all transformed into a massive circlejerk of confirmation bias while cumming in each other mouths , spewing le epik memes xd and upboats farm as long as your opinion closely resembles reddit 's hivemind , if it does n't then you 're labeled as a `` troll '' . 
  what i like about tucker is that ( at least from what i saw ) is he does n't even share his position when debating liberals , he simply calls out their bullshit and flaws in their logic . 
  not sure whether or not it 's good for tucker to associate with the_donald . 
  he 's already being targeted as `` loved by neo-nazis '' ( same flawed logic as in kkk --  trump ) . 
  nevertheless it gives back impression for the opposition . 
  he has a right , but not by going out of order and ignoring others ' right . 
  t500 is just too expensive , you 'll get bad price/performance . 
  if those are your only options then t530 is definitely worth it , hopefully it 's the one with that brighter fhd screen . 
  to be fair , hitler 's socialism was different from marxist socialism . 
  and it actually worked . 
  while i do believe they are biased towards clinton , i think this was just a celebration to the end of dnc , both republicans and democrats were there . 
  you need to watch it again sometime later . 
  100 % you missed a lot of details and subtle dialogue . 
  i think it started on the_donald with a picture of police officers with pretty much the same title . 
  nice buzzwords you got there . 
  where did you learn them from ? 
  huffington shitpost or was it ^ ^ ^ totally ^ ^ ^ not ^ ^ ^ fake ^ ^ ^ news buzzfeed ? 
  they 'll get back to / r/politics for their dose of indoctrination, 
   who 's triggered him . 
  is this a new way to deflect any criticism ? 
  celebrities attack trump , trump defends himself . 
  what is the problem here ? 
  you 're part of the problem of liberals throwing the world `` racist '' around without actually knowing it 's definition . 
  what 's the problem of wasting 1 minute of your day for a tweet ? 
  if he thinks somebody is being unfair to him , he tweets back . 
  why is this such a hard concept to understand ? 
  there is no `` whinning like a little bitch heheh xd le drumpf stupid xd '' . 
  it 's a simple dialogue back and forth . 
  why it 's petty only from his part ? 
  why ca n't celebrities be called `` le childish twitter rant xd '' when they decide to shit on the president-elect ? 
  i 'm all for his tweeting and hopefully he keeps doing it , no matter how silly or `` immature '' it might seem . 
  it 's a quick and effective direct line between the president and the people . 
  my point is the line above, 
   if he thinks somebody is being unfair to him , he tweets back . 
  why is this such a hard concept to understand ? 
   muh presidential behavior, 
  it 's a breath of fresh air watching a president act like a normal person . 
  i hope he keeps tweeting , it 's a direct line of communication to the people . 
  he 's not in yet . 
  so we just have to wait to see . 
  but i do hope he keeps on tweeting . 
  take a look at these, 
  it will probably be the grand champion !, 
  i ca n't wait for the epic battle !, 
  i even helped him with a quest . 
  wtf what drivers am i supposed to install now ? 
  does it include all the bells and whistles like hardware decoding support and power management ? 
  trust me , we 're having much more fun watching your meltdown since november 8th, 
  n-n-not my president reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee, 
  there was no mention of race in op story yet you called it racist . 
  not really . 
  thinklight also lights up the area around you , not only the keyboard . 
  so is bhs releasing yet another `` not even half-full skill bar '' class ? 
   2014 touchpad, 
  absolutely disgusting, 
  i miss that app so much ever since i switched to ios . 
  alien blue is filled with useless animations and reinvents the ui , it 's pretty but the functionality is n't there while reddit is fun just takes reddit and puts it in mobile mode . 
  [ the same eastpak ] ( https://www.sportzone.pt/i/8ad4f52ba8791658baa189fc1cb1e52338f9d2df ) i 've been using for years . 
  just throw the x220 in and forget about it . 
  this is what , like the 3rd or 4th person who engages in twitter meltdown after a tucker interview ? 
   to think i was going to spend $ 800 - $ 1,000 on a new laptop alone !, 
  so much this . 
  there seems to be some kind of syndrome that if you do n't spend at least 1 grand on the latest \u2122 and greatest \u2122 i7 then your laptop is going to be crap . 
  am literally shaking right now . 
  fascism has come to america, 
  just wanted to let you know that you were shadowbanned by reddit admins . 
  ( not us mods ) . 
  you should message them about it . 
  for me it 's the other way . 
  never felt more confident about a presidency before . 
  i just hope he keeps his word .

  sweden yes !, 
  such good decisions . 
  germany too yes . 
  it 's a direct consequence of massive importing of immigrants from 3rd world countries with completely different mindset . 
  so massive rape increase is fine because it also happens somewhere else you have n't named ?
