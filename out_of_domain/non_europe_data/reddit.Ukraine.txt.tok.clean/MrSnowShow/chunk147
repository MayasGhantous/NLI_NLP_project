  look , sweden betrayed it 's own people all in the name of some `` diversity is our strength '' fairytale and similar . 
  cultural enrichment was a mistake . 
  it 's okay we all make mistakes , but you 're supposed to fix the mistake to minimize damage already done . 
  despite the massive increase in rapes and other crimes , your leftist government refuses to acknowledge this and continues to push this fake fairytale that everything is fine and going great . 
  your country is in 3rd place in rapes as i stated earlier , congratulations . 
  all of this and you have the * audacity * of basically talking shit about americans who rejected a world class liar and corrupt career politician and elected an outsider who wants to put the country , and it 's people , in the top priority , which is what a government is supposed to do . 
  does n't matter . 
  it 's still a tremendous increase compared to other european countries and a real problem . 
  but keep being a rape apologist . 
  i 'm acknowledging a problem . 
  how can you say something like that when you ca n't even acknowledge that sweden had a spike in rapes committed by immigrants ? 
  a migrant raped a ** 12 year old girl ** and got only 22 days of community service . 
  not only there are more rapes , but the government is n't properly punishing this disgusting crime . 
  you 're disgusting . 
  girls as young as 12 were raped as a consequence of huge mistake which was the leftist immigration policy and you 're worried about `` racism '' ? 
   blogpost, 
  oh you 're [ one of these ] ( http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/12/maxresdefault.jpg ) . 
  i never thought i 'd actually `` meet '' you and have a discussion . 
   they 'd have already deported white men to somewhere else , hahah . 
  yes deport them from their own country . 
  an entire race . 
  being right-wing means i 'm pro-sexual assault ? 
  what the hell ? 
  you linked me a blogspot . 
   sexual assault, 
  i do n't think you know what that means, 
   when you 're a star , they let you do it . 
  you can do anything . 
  grab them by the pussy . 
   when you 're a star , they let you do it . 
  you can do anything, 
   when you 're a star , they let you do it . 
   they let you do it . 
   they let, 
   let, 
   ** let **, 
  not sure if you noticed but emphasis on the `` let you '' part . 
   ** let **, 
   l\u025bt /, 
   verb, 
   verb : let ; 3rd person present : lets ; past tense : let ; past participle : let ; gerund or present participle : letting, 
   1 . not prevent or forbid ; allow . 
  best kind of correct . 
  gave me a laugh . 
  are fedora edgelords right-wing ? 
  i always thought of them as angry atheists who like to yell at their christian family , play vidya , watch anime all day and white knight for women online . 
  oh and , just for fun , do you have dyed hair with a bright `` shocking '' color such as purple/red/green / etc. . . ? 
  did you read the `` let '' definition ? 
  rape happens , it 's horrible and sadly we may never fully eradicate it . 
  when a government makes a policy that almost directly increases rapes and other crimes i criticize it . 
  i do n't think it 's hard to understand . 
   you only latch onto the sexual assault, 
  it 's just one of the examples why this `` diversity is our strength '' and `` cultural enrichment '' are failed policies, 
  i 'm not against immigration , i 'm an immigrant myself . 
  i 'm against mindless mass immigration policies like `` yeah just come in and do whatever you want , we pay you with our citizens money , do a crime ? 
  no worries we reduce sentence you 're obviously mentally unstable '' . 
  i hate it when extreme left wing policies have great consequences on the country yet they 're downplayed instead of addressing the issue . 
  i 'm not sure if you 're going to be able to handle this shocking information but ... ... women like to sleep with rich guys . 
  you do n't know figures of speech ? 
  you just made up a hypothetical scenario in your favor , not an argument . 
  yes . 
  kill all men !, 
  last question . 
  i 'm pretty sure you describe yourself as `` anti-racist '' yet you seem to have a loathing of an entire race of people , white men . 
  if that 's true , then by definition , that makes you a racist . 
  ever thought about that ? 
  discrimination based on skin color and gender . 
   you are defending a molester . 
  i 'm defending reasoning . 
  what you 're doing ( wrongly ) is starting off the argument with already trump being * obviously * a rapist . 
  damn . 
  i had many arguments over this but your comment was the most reasonable against my argument . 
  however i still believe that it 's the `` vulgar guy talk '' that i myself had and heard many many times . 
  since he was running for prez the tape was of course perfect material for more anti-trump propaganda . 
  #who voted for you ? 
  you mean the picture ? 
  i got it off google images , i only noticed now it 's from breitbart . 
  i do n't read breitbart , just headlines on when they appear on facebook but i take them as a grain of salt , just like i do with the huffington post . 
  you should do it too , since unbiased journalism is almost impossible you might as well listen to everybody to get a wider perspective . 
  should n't be too hard since you probably describe yourself as `` tolerant '' . 
  and the fact that d.c. is ~ 90 % blue . 
  i think you 're trolling right now but i 'm going to take the bait . 
   he 's a `` fucking white male . '', 
  i did n't know day old babies could fuck , but yet , here we are . 
   fyi , that reads as racist . 
  it 's just joke reference to [ this lunatic ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-3y3ndct-y ) who screamed randomly ** you 're a fucking white male ** as if it 's a valid argument . 
  [ you can watch the whole thing here if you 're interested ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu3vcvgpalq ) . 
  where 's the racist part ? 
  you realize that the inauguration was < 12 hours ago ? 
  he 's not even president for half a day . 
  they 're gradually replacing old pages with new ones . 
  stop with this mindless fear-mongering , for your own sake and others . 
  i believe he genuinely cares about the country . 
  [ here 's a compilation of interviews from 80s all the way to 2015 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tzxvr9chng ) . 
  it 's really nice to see him talk about the same issues 30 years ago , which only got worse . 
  what 's mine fired ? 
  forgot northern mariana islands, 
  op is technically correct thought ( the best kind of correct ) . 
  he said `` map of states '' and territories are not states . 
  agree ?
