  the guy was giving an interview while a coward subhuman piece of dogshit gives him a sucker punch and runs away ? 
  you defend this type of scumfuck behavior ? 
  can you please point out at least 1 racist policy by trump ? 
  you 're part of the problem of throwing around racist at whatever you do n't like . 
  it 's loosing it 's meaning and is harmful to real racism issues . 
  are we attacking 10 year old kids now ? 
  what kind of sick fuck are you ? 
  i 'm pretty sure he does not want to kill black people . 
  you probably know zero about him . 
  you can disagree with something and still respect it . 
   so many immigrants as monsters, 
  ** illegal ** immigrants . 
  funny how you probably can name every letter of the ever increasing lgbtwtfbbq + + + + yet ca n't differentiate illegal and legal immigration . 
  that tariq interview ending was so brutal . 
  `` i 'm calling __ you __ out for lying ! '' . 
  left him speechless because he knows that deep down is that he 's not trying to end racism , but fueling it instead with these fake claims , he even called the repeal of obamacare a white supremacist thing . 
  good . 
  there are a lot of people who still think that trump hates immigration . 
  he has said repeatedly that he wants a wall , but does n't mind having a beautiful door for people to come in legally . 
  he wants to keep the illegals out , in other words , enforce the border . 
   4channer, 
  please do n't do this, 
  hilarious how even the title of the post is already biased . 
  do n't forget that 5 or 6 failed businesses out of hundreds of successful ones . 
  the clinton foundation is still under investigation , there 's still hope, 
  are you literally shaking too ? 
  he 's trying to educate you , fucking retard, 
  gold medal for mental gymnastics goes to you, 
  as if making a country great again is somehow a bad thing, 
  nice projections . 
  no wonder you 're so violent against the right , you have a completely distorted view of their ideas . 
  please do n't put spoilers in the title next time, 
  a similar thing happened with minecraft . 
  spent the whole afternoon playing and when i got out of the house the sun was setting and my first thought was - `` oh shit , the monsters are coming '' . 
  that is fn + f2 . 
  fn + f3 opens up a power settings menu , but you can set it to turn off screen , which is what i did . 
  my brain just farted , you 're right . 
  i think they meant that the thieves guild questline is better than in skyrim . 
  invest in alchemy and poison your arrows . 
  alchemy in oblivion is way more fun than in skyrim in my opinion . 
  your argument would make sense if you did n't label anyone slightly right leaning a nazi and fascist and whatever other word you misuse . 
  did you really just put the word facts and / r/politics in the same sentence ? 
   everybody who does n't agree with me is a fascist, 
  see the problem here ? 
  you probably also think that ** all ** +60 million people that voted for trump are racist sexist homophobic misogynistic islamophobic [ buzzword ] [ buzzword ] [ buzzword ], 
   t_d are nazis, 
  just because you do n't agree with them does n't mean they 're nazis . 
   a 4chan user talking about the flaws of the left as if the right is infallible is at least somewhat fascist . 
  oh my god . 
  criticizing the left makes you a fascist ? 
  what the hell am i reading, 
  you 're wrong and here is why :, 
  people voted for trump because he proposed to actually change something . 
  * renegotiate trade deals ( nafta , end tpp ), 
  * enforce the southern border ( a wall ), 
  * congressional term limits, 
  * bring back manufacturing jobs and punish companies that leave usa to make their products from another country . 
  and many more , these are the biggest ones . 
   he 's already going back on campaign promises , demonstrating he 's just another two-faced politician . 
  wrong again . 
  just today trump announced that they will start on building the wall . 
  also he already restricted immigration from countries compromised by terrorism . 
  what exactly did he go back on ? 
  in your opinion . 
  more than 60 million people like his campaign promises . 
  but fuck actually having a different opinion . 
  they 're all le dumb uneducated bigots amritie ? 
  is this bait ? 
  what white supremacist movement are you talking about ? 
  / pol / is not alt-right, 
  my claim is that / pol / is not alt-right . 
  simple as that . 
  yeah sorry i missed the point , late night ... 
  ( when i say `` you '' i mean what i 've generally seen from the anti-trump opposition , not you personally ) . 
  my simple suggestion to you is to stop labeling conservatives or anything remotely right leaning as omg fascism nazism kkk hitler . 
  the key is discussion , labeling people is the end of the discussion . 
  i could make a much better worded post but it 's just late and i have to go to sleep . 
  also if you have n't watched already [ here 's a liberal explaining it better ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glg9g7bcjks ), 
  reddit is filled with these pseudo intellectual morons . 
  when will you fucking retards finally learn that your degree that ends with `` studies '' does not make you any smarter than a man in his 40s who never went to college . 
  i never said that uneducated people were smart . 
  try again without projecting next time . 
   i never used arch but repeat memes like a parrot, 
  idiots downvoting you . 
  they probably tried arch , could n't follow a beginner 's guide , fucked up the install and instead of blaming themselves they blame the distro . 
  in other words , the problem is between the computer and the chair . 
  funny because res tells me i have upvoted you over 30 times . 
  keep doing what you 're doing in this sub . 
  she is still under investigation so there 's hope . 
  posts actually telling why arch is good are downvoted and somebody who never used arch repeats `` le arch breaks xd no job neet distro '' are on top . 
  no i do n't . 
  what it is this trend when suddenly everybody wants to a fix of their nostalgia and wants remasters of everything because `` omg when i was a kid this game man so good please remaster ! '', 
  just shut the fuck up and let developers work on something new . 
  worth mentioning also , for pc players , if you do n't want to mess with efficient leveling there 's a mod called [ all +5 attribute modifiers ] ( http://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/2691/ ? ) . 
  all you need is to level up just once any skill and it will immediately give you a +5 to the skill 's related attribute . 
  why do you make up bullshit about a community you know nothing about ? 
  that 's what we 've been hearing all election long and look what happened . 
  use the computer ? 
  `` draining the swamp '' does not mean pulling people out of the street to work for trump . 
  for example , just because he appointed an ex-goldman sachs dude who worked with him during the campaign ( remember how little money trump spent per delegate/ev ? ),
