  * speaking of the divines , they should be also contacting you and offer quests just like daedric princes , in sort of like angel vs devil fight . 
  ** there you go , 10 fucking thousand characters rant about how the next elder scrolls should be . 
  and i 'm not even halfway done yet because it was all top of my head . 
  the key word that describes what needs to change is : ** diversity **, 
  ralof you damn traitor !, 
  out of my way !, 
  well this was more like a rant on top of my head so i did n't give much though to each point and nostalgia sometimes kicks in ... 
  variety , they were in morrowind so what 's the problem ? 
  fine !, 
  i hope that dragon takes you all to sovngarde, 
  ( yes , 2 more lines and we need to choose , i do n't know ... ), 
  * those are 4 effects that an ingredient has , but which ones you see depends on your alchemy level, 
  * taken from [ oblivion : alchemy ] ( http://www.uesp.net/wiki/oblivion:alchemy ) uesp page : *, 
  a novice ( alchemy < 25 ) recognizes one of four ( 1st ) potential alchemical properties of an ingredient . 
   an apprentice ( alchemy = 25-49 ) recognizes two of four ( 1st and 2nd ) potential alchemical properties of an ingredient . 
   a journeyman ( alchemy = 50-74 ) recognizes three of four ( 1st 2nd and 3rd ) potential alchemical properties of an ingredient . 
   an expert ( alchemy = 75-99 ) recognizes all four potential alchemical properties of an ingredient . 
   a master ( alchemy = 100 ) can make potions from a single ingredient . 
  only the first effect of the chosen ingredient gets added into the potion . 
  they say that when you murder someone , the dark brotherhood comes in your sleep . 
  that 's how they recruit new members . 
  heard any news from the other provinces ? 
  ** owyn ** , imperial city arena blademaster . 
  a favorite of mine :, 
  * you must be downright determined to get yourself killed , huh ? 
  okay then , head back up to the arena and try not to die before the gate opens . 
  but reading is like 20 % of the experience , his voice acting is very fun to listen to . 
  stop !, 
  you violated the lore !, 
  i have to admit . 
  the first time doing that quest i though that i needed to kill the rats , and i did it hahaha . 
  * this one is a breton . 
  he looks a bit of dandy but he 's deadly with a blade *, 
  also when you fight a dude with a magical dagger he also says in a very funny way :, 
  * i guess you showed that wood elf what you thought about his magical dagger hee hee hee *, 
  this is why we need to listen to them . 
  ** page 3 **, 
  * we 'll meet again in sovngarde brother *, 
  ** page 4 **, 
  * looks like we 're the only ones who made it . 
  was that really a dragon ? 
  the bringers of the end times ? 
  i recommend watching linkthe1st 's ( he 's yogscast will now ) oblivion videos , since his editing skills and voice both top-notch . 
  [ vampire cure quest ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rfqhjzy5-0 ), 
  [ vampirism ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qporyokbqea ), 
  [ alchemy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzhck9nfuvk ), 
  [ enchanting ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrgicl9aspe ), 
  and more that i ca n't remember, 
  and he has more detailed guides on more games . 
  i sometimes even watch his videos just because of how professional and well-done they are . 
  ( no seriously , i watched the vampire guide video maybe like 15 times ), 
  * you crack hoarding bitch *, 
  i 've also met a pretty cool dude in aion we often just go to a high place somewhere with a nice landscape view and just talk for even hours . 
  too bad that i stopped playing so i have n't heard from him since : /, 
  they usually go for fancy dates like 11/11/11 that was skyrim . 
  sorry i 'm not very good in terms of gods . 
  i only know about talos the mighty !, 
  as i said this was mostly spontaneous and did n't give much though . 
  but it 's funny how vigilants of stendarr are against daedra worship and also any form of undead while meridia also hates undead . 
  the point that i was trying to make is getting more interaction with the divines rather than just daedric princes , because then some people could role play a paladin character and act on behalf of the divines . 
  i 'll never forget you . 
  people always want what they do not have . 
  so switching peasant posts and no-peasants posts will always keep ( me atleast ) happy . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ sometimes ^ ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^ like ^ ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ ^ laugh ^ ^ ^ ^ at ^ ^ ^ ^ peasant ^ ^ ^ ^ stupidity, 
  as a more pvp player :, 
  * duels vs every class ( can ignore healers ) and tips for 1v1ing, 
  i 'm just gon na rip a comment from another user :, 
  let me tell you a story , @ february 2012 ( i think ) a patch applied on both na and korea . 
  and it changed kuma , but diferently in na and korea :, 
  * in na they nerfed kumas because it had a massive cry on how they were op and it was impossible to win against them, 
  * in korea they massively buffed the kumas because koreans said that it was impossible to win as kumas . 
  so basically at the same day , na got kumas nerfed because people could n't teamwork properly while in korea they buffed kumas because of how koreans teamworked and it was impossible to win as kuma . 
  this is to show just how far in terms of skills na/eu are from koreans . 
  so basically if a korean team came to na and played kuma , it would be a huge joke for them . 
  for some reason i 'm at 100 % ready but play button is grey ... 
  the waiting until it completes and then login works, 
  thank you kind sir and i get distracted by mirrors alot , you see why ? 
  even though sony made a better console than microsoft , i just keep loosing respect to them because they keep lying about their games quality . 
  killzone is n't full 1080p, 
  watch_dogs 1080p 60 fps advertise bullshit, 
  now this, 
  ~ ~ the rift ? 
  goodness no ! ~ ~, 
  ~ ~ the landscape feels like it 's dead ... ~ ~, 
  i confused with the reach , nevermind the rift is beautiful . 
  i do this because skyrim is n't a game where areas have levels so you can do anything at any level , i just want to enjoy the game while having my character already with appropriate skills for the playthrough . 
  holy shit he beats the meat with his left hand . 
  i 'm also using a hd 5650m laptop . 
  i 'm just waiting for it to die due to overheating so i have excuse to build a desktop . 
  i actually put my cpu at 80 % maximum performance or else it will melt probably haha . 
  ** meanwhile on console optimization : **, 
  we 'll use a resolution of 801p so we can get to 30ish fps and turn on basic aa ( but it looks like high-end pcs we promise ), 
  come on , your post title is exactly like the last sentence ... 
  finally someone like me !, 
  followers just get in the way and overall just slow me down and i do n't have the time or patience for their bullshit and need to always look behind if they did n't get stuck somewhere . 
  this is why i also ( despite wanting to ) can not play a summoner or illusionist character because i simply do n't have the patience until the summon starts to kill or the enemies just kill themselves . 
  i just go in and kill them all and keep moving . 
  stealing thousands of real life hours from us . 
  this is why i 'm refusing to buy anything with 3 ^ rd party drm . 
  this drm is supposed to stop piracy but what it fails in almost everyway , the only thing it succedeed is stopping to play multiplayer most of the times .
