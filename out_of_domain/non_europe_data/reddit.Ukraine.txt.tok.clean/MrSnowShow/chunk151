  my dad found one of those on the street and gave it to me , but i know nothing about it, 
  i 'd try also to reinstall grub ` grub-install [ your ssd ] ` ( ? ), 
  i think and also regenerate ` / etc/fstab `, 
  also why are you using ubuntu 's livecd for arch ? 
  do you really think it 's a good idea to use ubuntu tools on archlinux ? 
  well i 'm pretty sure a gentoo person knows what he 's doing and you 're apparently not . 
  if you look at his comments below he is using antergos instead of arch , which explains a lot . 
   antergos, 
  ^ ^ \\ ( this ^ ^ may ^ ^ be ^ ^ a ^ ^ bit ^ ^ rude ), 
  you sneaky fuck , why did n't you tell us from the start you were using antergos , not actual arch ? 
  please do n't spam , i really hate removing posts but you already spammed twice just links without any constructive input of your own . 
  edit : did you seriously just report my comment ? 
   delet this !!!, 
  why am i not surprised, 
   sjws are n't bad, 
  \\ - an obvious sjw, 
  he pays tremendous amount of tax . 
  there are a fuckton of taxes to pay . 
  real estate tax , property tax , and bunch of other taxes . 
  is it supposed to be funny ? 
  is this liberal `` humor '' i am looking at ? 
  if so then you guys are terrible at this . 
   and it is really funny, 
  i have some bad news for you ... 
  how were you taking care of your battery ? 
  i have this battery for a little more than a year and it 's already in worse shape than yours ( 2h30-3h-30 ) . 
  i think i fucked up when i left the computer for days without a battery, 
  no , it 's retarded . 
  ^ ^ ^ it 's ^ ^ ^ not ^ ^ ^ arch, 
  i 'm pretty sure it 's autoconfigured to start on boot , but the first time you need to start it manually if you do n't want to reboot . 
  one thing i do n't see mentioned a lot is oblivion 's journal vs skyrim 's . 
  skyrim 's feels very boring while oblivion 's is all charmed up and that * ding * sound effect adds to the `` magic '' . 
  overall i would say oblivion has that clear `` fantasy '' feeling while skyrim not so much . 
   but also conveniently any country trump has business interests in . 
  the 7 country list was made a couple ( ? ), 
  of years ago under obama . 
  also africa-tier rape statistics and no-go zones that even police wo n't enter . 
  amazing !, 
  there are funnier when upside down, 
  like [ this one ] ( https://scontent.fopo1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t34.0-12/16839417_1282214281862915_587258071_n.png?oh=1d45d2f51511a164b6b957c220247e3f&amp;oe=58b0b0b5 ), 
  we culturally are so far left that the slightest deviation is now considered `` far right '' . 
  it 's laughable . 
  / pol / is not alt-right you fucking newfaggot, 
  i said this 2 days ago [ in this thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/5v9r57/this_is_hands_down_the_best_game_i_have_ever/de0wexu/ ), 
   one thing i do n't see mentioned a lot is oblivion 's journal vs skyrim 's . 
   skyrim 's feels very boring while oblivion 's is all charmed up and that ding sound effect adds to the `` magic '' . 
   overall i would say oblivion has that clear `` fantasy '' feeling while skyrim not so much . 
  one day i 'll make a nicely worded post describing exactly what i love about it, 
  that just how reddit works , it 's not for discussion , it 's for repeating the same generally approved `` opinions '' and replies are simply confirmations of those opinions . 
  anything else gets downvoted and hidden . 
  this is proportional to the size of subreddit , bigger it gets , the more it suppresses different opinions . 
  reddit discussion can be summed up as, 
  a person makes a `` reddit-approved '' viewpoint, 
  another person agrees with that, 
  3rd person makes a pun, 
  repeat this for other comments and you end up with a giant orgy of confirmation bias and unfunny jokes . 
  so that 's pretty much it . 
  be a good boy , do n't say anything out of ordinary and all your comments will have positive karma !, 
  yay !, 
   i 'll never understand how the minds of downvoters work . 
  it 's simple , most redditors are fucking retards . 
  i do n't even bother anymore . 
  i think i understand 24bit but what 's the point of going all the way to 96khz ? 
  nyquist theorem says that the sampling rate just needs to be  = 2x the frequency to not have losses . 
  even the president is sometimes called shitposter-in-chief, 
  you 're a 17-18 year old politically-retarded kid , you would n't get it . 
  the snoo must be uploaded in subreddit settings , not with css . 
  24 and politically-retarded ? 
  in your css you have this fucked up code :, 
  #header - img.default-header , #header - img {, 
  z-index : 99 ;, 
  position : relative ;, 
  opacity : 0.0 ;, 
  as you can see you have both set ` opacity ` to zero and ` background-image ` to blank . 
  of course nothing shows up . 
  try something like, 
  #header - img {, 
  position : relative ;, 
  this should be enough, 
  jesus man just use it for 1 or 2 days what the hell man this is n't rocket science ... 
  follow uninstall instructions for natural environments, 
  follow install instructions for all natural, 
   that mexicans bring in rapists and the like . 
  that 's not really what he said . 
  it was in the context of mexican ** government ** not wanting to deal with it 's criminals so they send them through the border . 
  but of course when the msm reported on this they did not give adequate context . 
  donald trump 's statement, 
   i do n't see how there is any room for misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the statement i made on june 16th during my presidential announcement speech . 
  here is what i said , and yet this statement is deliberately distorted by the media :, 
   `` when mexico ( meaning the mexican government ) sends its people , they 're not sending their best . 
  they 're not sending you ( pointing to the audience ) . 
  they 're not sending you ( pointing again ) . 
  they 're sending people that have lots of problems , and they 're bringing those problems to us . 
  they 're bringing drugs.they 're bringing crime . 
  they 're rapists . 
  and some , i assume , are good people !, 
  but i speak to border guards and they tell us what we 're getting . 
  and it only makes common sense . 
  they 're sending us not the right people . 
  it 's coming from more than mexico .
