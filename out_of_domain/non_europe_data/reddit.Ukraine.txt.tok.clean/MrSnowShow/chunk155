  100 % fail . 
  and thus a generation of snowflakes is born, 
   main quest up to cloud ruler temple, 
  although cloud ruler temple is a comfy place to have access to , if you advance the main quest to that point you will have random oblivion gates popping up which i found to be annoying . 
  what i usually did was just deliver the amulet of kings to jauffre , take his supplies and never visit kvatch until i wanted to focus on the main quest . 
  okay . 
   por exemplo , a rep\u00fablica centro-africana , a republica do n\u00edger , a som\u00e1lia , etc. . . 
  est\u00e1s a tornar isto mais complicado do que devia ser . 
  censur\u00e1-lo ? 
  can you elaborate why ? 
  do n't worry about the downvotes , ~ 90 % of reddit is retarded and does n't know what the downvote button is actually for . 
  no , this is n't a $ 300 hp craptop from your local electronics store . 
  being conservative does not mean automatically hating other countries . 
  a country 's is supposed to serve it 's people what the are you talking about ? 
  i know the future is one global community but we are _ very _ different so it 's gon na have to wait for a few decades ( ? ) . 
  also i love my culture and you should love yours . 
  we can all coexist peacefully yet tolerant and proud of our culture . 
   i use antergos, 
  this is / r/archlinux, 
  do you really consider installing arch an accomplishment ? 
   help, 
  what are you talking about ? 
  i 'm simply stating that installing arch is just following instructions and is __ not __ an accomplishment whatsoever . 
  i just hate this toxic `` everybody gets a trophy '' `` you 're all winners '' attitude . 
  i was also pretty happy with my minimal arch install but did n't go to whore myself out on / r/archlinux . 
  i do n't like the concept of reward without merit , it 's that simple . 
  perhaps i misunderstood the intent of this particular post . 
  but i see constantly posts about arch installations as if it was some achievement and overall a bunch of mental masturbation because the install is so _ hard _ . 
  like seriously what 's the point ? 
  it 's no different that posting #nopainnogain on instagram after being 1h in the gym . 
  perhaps you 're right , i do not know anything about op and my original comment was most likely unnecessary . 
  i 'll leave as an example to others how it _ should n't _ be done . 
  why are you repeating facebook memes ? 
  he invaded during summer but winter came before he reached moscow . 
  i know this is / r/thinkpad but since you 're used to macs why you simply did n't go with a 2015 model ? 
  you 're not forced to always buy the latest \u2122 and greatest \u2122, 
  yes that is why he has a successful marriage and 3 or 4 daughters, 
   socialists believe that the default state is wealth . 
  i guess so . 
  they do n't understand that __ life __ is a constant survival battle , it has always been . 
  __ you are not entitled to a comfortable and healthy life __ , times have changed - instead of running around with a spear and hunting/gathering food , we changed that to being somewhere for 8h doing something , receiving a piece of fancy paper and trading that for food in a grocery store . 
   tight budget, 
   preferably < $ 400 ... yeah , sad, 
  do n't have to be sad . 
  there seems to be some kind of major brainwash if you do n't get the latest \u2122 and greatest \u2122 i7 \u2122 core \u2122  $ 1000 laptop then your computer is probably crap . 
  it 's not . 
  $ 400 is more than enough to get a really good price/performance , if you know what you 're doing . 
  the guy uses antergos what did you expect ... 
  somehow he can afford to waste time posting on reddit and waiting for answers but typing the exact same question in google is hard apparently . 
  bill nye the bachelor 's in me guy, 
  whoa , you missed my point . 
  i 'm not calling him stupid , what i was trying to point out is that that labeling himself as `` bill nye the science guy '' is deceiving since you 'd assume he 's a real scientist but in reality he has a degree in mechanical engineering . 
  i was n't saying that degree in me is crap . 
  i 'm in engineering myself so i know about the high difficulty and dropout rate . 
  what do you expect from a socialism flag ? 
  self criticism is unknown for them which is why they supports an ideology that brought nothing but failure . 
  any sane person would abandon it or reform it , but they do not have plans for that . 
  see definition of insanity . 
   private property is theft, 
  the fuck does this even mean ? 
  you ` steal ' property from who ? 
  mother nature ? 
  the red is too bright, 
  liberals realizing that forced diversity maybe is n't our strength after all ... 
  any guesses about what happens to those after college ? 
  worse is that guy who shares them on facebook, 
  try this video, 
  what a little sensitive snowflake you are . 
  did you really get so upset at a mere suggestion of googling something ? 
  / u/bobcrosswise gave you a detailed anwer and suggested googling too and your ` thank you ' is by downvoting him and reporting his comments . 
  i 'm mod and i had to ignore the report that you stupidly used because you simply did n't like what he said . 
  please read up on what is downvote and report for . 
  why not the 1600x1200 ? 
  even if there is an infinite amount of universes , i 'm pretty sure there not one which has a hillary president . 
   awful placement of the control key, 
  that 's how it should be . 
  the switch was almost immediate for me . 
   taking picture of a screen, 
  come on man you can do better than that . 
   but the 6300u has no tpm , which , i believe , means no vpro , no tc and no atm . 
  is it the case ? 
  i do n't think so , where did you get this info ? 
  all modern intel cpus are compromised and is ( for now ) impossible to remove the management engine without the pc shutting down after 30 minutes due to signature verification . 
  google 's ceo salary is n't even $ 200,000,000 . 
  he got like $ 650k and rest was from stocks . 
  they will go to the next level . 
  best way is to just try it yourself . 
  go in-game , pick any major skill , open console and type, 
  ` advskill [ a major skill ] 50 `, 
  this will advance a major skill by 50 points , you will be able to sleep 4 or 5 times and thus level up 4 or 5 times , depending on how much progress you already had . 
  your skill points are not going to get lost . 
  what you 'll be loosing however are the little bonuses ( ranging from +2 to +5 ) [ at this screen ] ( https://harryperry999.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/oblivion-level-up.jpg ) . 
  on first level up you 'll get +2 up to +5 on some attributes . 
  but all next levels there will be no bonuses , it will be all blank ( +1 ) . 
  `` everybody gets a trophy '' is bad already but now there 's a trend of `` gim me a trophy for doing this absolutely basic thing '' . 
  there 's already a snowflake problem but this way it might get worse, 
  no , you 're supposed to call him a racist and shut him down by any means necessary . 
  what patch are you on ? 
  there are many bugs during this quest and the biggest one which is melisandre not accepting bloodgrass is fixed by version 1.1.511 of the official patch . 
  also why not patch it ?
