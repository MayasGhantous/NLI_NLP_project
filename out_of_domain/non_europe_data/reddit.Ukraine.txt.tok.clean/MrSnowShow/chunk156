  patches should automatically be downloaded and installed once you 're connected to xbox live .

   you need to upgrade your flash player, 
  ethernet cable ? 
  one of the most obvious things is putting ` obama ' in obamacare ... really ? 
  if trump proposed trumpcare he 'd be grilled by the left for being so narcissistic and self-centered . 
  have you tried looking at, 
  why is there such a high correlation between fascism and aesthetics ? 
  polaco, 
   it creates a feeling that the individual is insignificant . 
  it 's pretty much how i interpret ` right-wing ' , it inclines towards what 's better for the group rather than the individual . 
  it could be something as simple and moral as `` america first ! '', 
  or extreme and regarded immoral as killing sick babies to keep a population strong and healthy . 
  kyle , seriously , do n't copy-paste commands from the internet . 
  also no , you do n't need to change nothing , defaults are fine . 
  what do you mean by goty without dlc ? 
  goty is base game + 2 dlcs , knights of the nine and shivering isles . 
  do you mean the little small dlcs like fighter 's stronghold , vile lair , horse armour , etc. . ? 
  what platform are you on ? 
  those are __ not __ available if you 're on a ps3 . 
   i also wanted to change cpu max on battery to save power, 
  do n't do this . 
  i know it sounds intuitive but modern processors do what 's called `` race to idle '' where they try to accomplish a task as quickly as possible to return to idle state which is very efficient . 
  if you throttle the cpu you will end up wasting more power because it 's better to do a task quickly and return to idle than do a task slowly but for a longer time . 
  what an entitled cunt you are . 
   help me archers but i 'm not even using your distro i 'm using some shitty installer that i have no idea what it does because i ca n't even follow some simple instructions from a wiki page, 
   mild touch of infinality, 
  your fonts look to thin for my taste . 
  you should n't really mess with font settings , default ubuntu is gorgeous . 
  ca n't wait for them to bring the defaults to gnome in 18.04 . 
  are they just as good as unity ? 
  i remember looking at one of my friend 's installation and fonts were n't that impressive , perhaps something changed i do n't know . 
  wuz, 
   when they have more people than you have bullets, 
   `` a moron admires complexity , a genius admires simplicity '' . 
  the president is figuratively hitler wow i never knew america was so racist fascist misogynistic homophobic transphobic, 
  come on it 's [ number of years since the birth of jesus christ ] !, 
  reminds of this beauty from the huffington shitpost, 
   #donald trump and his cabinet will trade on inside information as president, 
  and first paragraph says, 
   actually , i do n't know that donald trump will take advantage of the inside information he will have access to as president , but no one knows that he wo n't . 
  it 's a quote ... you do with it whatever you want . 
  impechment time boys !!!, 
  dronal shtrumpf is finished !, 
  what 's that supposed to mean ? 
  we had biweekly discussion threads back in the days when the sub just got new mods , but they were created by a regular user . 
  for example :, 
  guess we have to learn automoderator . 
  nice , i used to use bitmap fonts too but then discovered source code pro, 
  also coincidence , i 'm also doing a graph based project due this sunday ... it 's gon na be a long night . 
  it 's not like it 's 2005 and there 's 1 computer for the whole family . 
  you can have your productivity laptop and/or desktop with whatever os you need while still having fully free laptops just for fun . 
  hate to be that guy but fsf and `` libre '' do not fit there . 
  fsf is a non-profit organization and `` libre '' is just a french word that stallman likes to use to distinguish free ( freedom ) from free ( price ) because in french ( and many other languages ) `` free ( freedom ) '' and `` free ( price ) '' are two distinct words . 
  unfortunately most of us can not sustain ourselves by giving the same 2 or 3 speeches around the world . 
  the `` arch is constantly breaking '' is a meme . 
  the only people who say that believe arch is always breaking are those who never used it in the first place , like op . 
  but muh evil ceos making x10000 than a worker !, 
  t440p is better , still has socketed full wattage cpu . 
  what 's the reasoning behind the nordic crosses ? 
  do you use git with `` bash on ubuntu on windows '' ? 
  so you just use the git 's shell instead ? 
  i saw a friend install it and it kinda got scary because of different conventions for file endings ( lf + cf and other shit ) i have no idea how should it be configured . 
   talk to me about httt, 
  i did n't have big expectations because the `` ratings '' always put this album one of the last but it 's _ so _ good . 
  oldblivion did that for me , made the game very bright . 
  my intel pentium 4 's integrated graphics were not capable of running oblivion 's newer shader technology . 
  running on 640x480 , all on lowest of lowest possible , all crash-preventing patches and the game _ still _ crashed when too much happened on the screen . 
  that became especially annoying at the end of the main quest , i had to always look at the ground because the slightest spell effect would crash the game . 
  #dronel shtbumpf is finished after this, 
  ^ ^ right ^ ^ guys ... ^ ^ right ? 
  how do you even work with cad on a 12.5 inch screen ? 
  here you go . 
  basically what you do is go to the [ x220 's keyboard page ] ( https://pcsupport.lenovo.com/pt/en/solutions/pd013449 ) and for each language it goes from left to right :, 
  nmb --  alps --  chicony, 
  ` iwlwifi ` ( intel 's wifi firmware ) is nonfree and as with all nonfree things , it is not included in debian by default . 
  all you had to do is enable the non-free repository and install intel 's wifi firmware ... 
  no idea , i do n't know what kernel module an `` ancient '' wifi chip uses . 
  my guess is you just had non-free repos enabled . 
  also you said earlier, 
   i thought that at least the thinkpad line was very compatible with linux . 
  thinkpads _ are _ very compatible with linux , it 's just debian that from an ethical standpoint does not include non free ( as in freedom ) firmware and software by default , all you have to do is enable the repo and you 're set . 
  pick any other distro and wifi works out of the box . 
  install gentoo is a meme, 
   writing a new os only for the, 
  386 in 1991 gets you your second ` f ' for this term . 
  but if you do real well, 
  on the final exam , you can still pass the course . 
  the arrogance, 
  they are their own parody at this point, 
  relevant quote, 
   `` if you ca n't explain it simply , you do n't understand it well enough '', 
   no designated month since this constellation apparently wanders across the sky and can appear at any time of the year . 
  til, 
  oh man i hate how liberals argue . 
  the last guy was annoying, 
   `` ok so you asked a very specific question let me reply to you by giving a very generic answer '' . 
  liberals only have 2 modes : smug and outraged . 
  the new york times ? 
  really ?
