  they were the most shameless and out in the open straight up shilling for her the entire election . 
  it was disgusting , cnn at least tried to be subtle somehow but nyt did n't care at all . 
  did n't wikileaks reveal that they gave her veto power ? 
  it is not a _ free _ download . 
  you have to buy the game . 
  note that any skill level up ___ after ___ getting the `` you have to rest '' popup does ___ not ___ count anymore towards the bonus . 
  make sure you get the correct amount of minor level ups before leveling your major skills and reached the `` you have to rest '' stage . 
  i remember reading that donald trump 's airtime on tv would have costed like $ 2 billion . 
  and he got it for free . 
  he played the media like a fiddle . 
  my favorite troll from him was how he tricked the entire msm on broadcasting 30 minutes of him receiving veteran endorsements . 
  nobody liked comey anyway . 
  russia investigation is a meme too . 
  msm get guests that admit there is no evidence but next day you 'll still be hearing about this `` developing '' russia non-story . 
  there 's also 1 ram slot and even more gimped keyboard layout ( no more media keys for you and insert is now fn + end ), 
  you may not need a feature but many thinkpad users do need them , and miss them . 
  also the problem with single ram slot is that it 's limited to 8gb . 
  shift + insert for example is used in linux to paste things . 
  the thing that pisses me off most about removal of media keys is that there is absolutely no compromise . 
  a lot of changes have compromise , example : we take your ports but you get a thinner laptop . 
  removal of media keys is just that , removal . 
  they straight up decided that you no longer are allowed to control your music player , but you can with an older laptop . 
  the only justification i can image is saving a few cents ( ? ), 
  on painting those icons on every keyboard . 
   should be able to handle a 16gb stick . 
  it does n't . 
  it 's a hardware limitation . 
   i do n't have keys to control the music player on my older thinkpad ( x200 ), 
  look at your arrow keys . 
  you 're also kinda missing my point . 
  i understand that you specifically might not care about these changes , but a lot of us do . 
  i know you can , my point was they just simply removed it for no apparent reason . 
  i you can , my point was that there 's absolutely no reason to simply remove a feature like that . 
  + / u/user _ simulator / u/mrsnowshow, 
  unique armor ? 
  if i recall correctly they use leather armor . 
  that interview left me a bit confused . 
  i refuse to believe that a mayor can have such infantile grasp of reality . 
  do you think he actually believes the bullshit he said ? 
  or does he know that the paris '' '' '' '' `` climate '' '' '' '' '' agreement is just a huge worldwide virtue signal and another instance of global socialism , specifically sucking money out of the us . 
  i 'd like to interj - oh okay carry on . 
  nothing wrong with begging when it 's done in a humble way . 
  what a lot of people hate are entitled gib me dat free shit folk , that behavior is disgusting . 
  ips screen ? 
  ` normie ' is more a / r9k / thing . 
  yay , life is a disney movie !, 
  we just sing and say ' i love you ! ', 
  and everything will be great !, 
  it 's not a fair comparison . 
  shivering isles simply offers more content and is a full expansion . 
  maybe it 's just a different opinion ? 
  r/tucker _ carlson = home of russian protrump trolls, 
  got it . 
  thank you for your enlightenment , clearly you 've invested your entire mental capacity on figuring that out . 
  openbsd is a good candidate , many openbsd developers use thinkpads so support is good, 
   and lastly besides this , is there a way in the ui to tell i am a vampire ? 
  you 're probably wearing a helmet that 's why you did n't notice but if you look at your character 's eyes they 're now a light red and you look paler and older . 
  also on your spells menu , on active effects you should have `` vampirism '' and other vampire specific buffs/debuffs . 
  as a vampire i like to wear a more `` vampirish '' clothes . 
  you 're probably apolitical that 's why . 
  understanding that chart is babby 's first politics, 
  i do n't use twitter but this guy apparently kept saying `` why do n't you go back to watching kid cartoons '' . 
   lenovo is all about $ $ $, 
  every company is all about $ $ $ . 
  if they figure out that making macbook clones will make them more money than sticking to traditional thinkpad values then they will not even think twice about it . 
  good to know it 's easy to open and work with . 
  i used to despise * 40 series but now i see that t440p is the logical choice if you want native 1080p . 
   it 's not fair that armor gives you 3 extra slots for enchanting, 
  that 's why i use mods to enchant a robe for example with +100 fortify magicka . 
  i do n't consider it cheating since a robe occupies 2 slots and i could get the same effect the legit way by simply wearing a 2x 50 + fortify magicka shirt and pants . 
   they are not obliged to, 
  it 's not a matter of intel wanting to open their code or not . 
  they are __ forced __ to keep it closed . 
  so even if intel wanted to , they legally ca n't . 
   the me firmware is compressed and consists of modules that are listed in the manifest along with secure cryptographic hashes of their contents . 
  one module is the operating system kernel , which is based on a proprietary real-time operating system ( rtos ) kernel called `` threadx '' . 
  the developer , express logic , sells licenses and source code for threadx . 
  customers such as intel are ** forbidden from disclosing or sublicensing the threadx source code ** . 
  also a simple `` disable '' button is not enough in my opinion . 
  well in ubuntu for example to install tlp you simply do, 
  and you 're done . 
  with arch you do, 
  and then go to archwiki which has a page on tlp and you now learn that you must enable the tlp service with systemd . 
  basically in this particular example ubuntu enables the tlp service by default while in arch you must do it yourself . 
  this gets can get more complicated if you 're installing a more complex package . 
  since you mentioned `` handbook '' it reminded me of gentoo 's handbook . 
  it is also very good . 
  the sentences are written in a way that you not only get instructions , but also learn something more deep about what you 're doing without getting too technical . 
  example , this is from the `` preparing the disks '' part :, 
   although it is theoretically possible to use a raw , unpartitioned disk to house a linux system ( when creating a btrfs raid for example ) , this is almost never done in practice . 
  instead , disk block devices are split up into smaller , more manageable block devices . 
  on amd64 systems , these are called partitions . 
  when i first read the above i learned :, 
  you do n't use the full disk space to write stuff, 
  theoretically it can be done, 
  i thought all computers use partitions , but now i know that there are other disk divisions that are not partitions, 
  stuff like this is all over the handbook . 
  you could also see wolf blitzer dying inside as he was announcing trump winning key states . 
  beautiful . 
  given reddit demographics it 's not surprising .
