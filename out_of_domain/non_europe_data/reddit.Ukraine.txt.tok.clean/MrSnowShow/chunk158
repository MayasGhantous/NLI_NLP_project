  reddit , for whatever reason , seems to attract a specific type of people - the beta normie but social awkward pseudointellectual high school/college teenager . 
  despite reddit receiving millions of unique visitors , they still view this site as a secret community of counter-cultural warriors and intellectuals . 
  these people usually have the typical lame leftists opinions we all know : the west is evil , companies are evil , etc. . . 
  despite what they might claim , leftists are _ very _ intolerant of right-wing opinions . 
  you often hear a right-winger saying stuff like `` that 's your opinion and it 's fine '' , `` you do n't have to like [ whatever ] and that 's fine '' . 
  you never hear a leftists say this , instead they try to censor you , call you names , scream at you as you were the devil . 
  they honestly believe that they are on the moral high ground and on the `` good '' side fighting against the inherently evil opposition which followers are simply too stupid to realize , the idea that a big group of people holding a different valid opinion is simply impossible for them to grasp , but this is a story for another time . 
  we all know how termites make [ their big homes ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/cathedral_termite_mound_-_brewbooks.jpg/256px-cathedral_termite_mound_-_brewbooks.jpg ) , they do not have central planning , each termite does it 's job and it just in the end ends up together . 
  the leftists here are the same and reddit provides them the perfect tools for creating an echochamber . 
  each of them hangs around and abuses the upvote/downvote system , it was meant to encourage good posts and hide spam , but in reality it serves as an echochamber creator and maintainer . 
  due to left 's intolerance of different opinions as explained earlier , if you express something out of the ordinary , you _ will _ get fervently downvoted and even reported , you are a _ troll _ , like wow it 's [ current year ] how do you even have that opinion ? 
  you are definitely a troll and you 're getting downvoted and reported , troll . 
  it 's not just the users , it 's also the mods and admins . 
  collectively they all contribute to maintain an echochamber of opinions on this site which gives them easy to use tools to do so . 
  it 's not a central effort or having infiltrators as you said , it 's just how leftists are , which is why i gave the termite analogy earlier . 
  see that 's the problem with leftism in general , it can only exist in a contained regulated environment , put it out in a truly free speech environment and watch as it falls apart . 
  i could go on but i guess i made my points, 
  not a fan of putting the swastika on everything-fascism . 
  fascism is much more than swastikas . 
  i guess you should have called it independent national socialist bavaria . 
  nice fairytale you got there . 
  i get the message but it simply does n't work in a real world . 
  sorry man but you must let go and move on . 
  they 're parasites specifically . 
  looking for something to leech off from . 
  maybe unite some 2 similar states to keep 50 stars ? 
  americans , do you really need two dakotas ? 
   i 'm a broke student who ca n't afford office, 
  as a student you probably have free access to office 365 , i know i do . 
  memes _ and _ politics ... on my / r/oblivion ? 
  what 's up with the shitty low effort memes raid lately ? 
  do we need to start to moderate quality ? 
  my parents used to tell me when giving the `` you must work if you want something in life '' talk, 
  with translates to `` for free , only the cheese in a mousetrap '' . 
  the ones crying `` pls remaster oblivion '' are entitled spoiled kids that want nothing more than fulfilling their nostalgia . 
  they do n't care about years of development time , do n't care how long it will take and prevent progress for a brand new elder scrolls . 
  all their care about is __ me __ __ me __ __ me __ , __ me __ and __ my __ needs come first !, 
   not only is there the whole vampirism bug , but i heard that the shivering isles dlc is so bugged that it 's impossible to complete or something like that . 
  is that true ? 
  i 'm pretty sure you 're mixing up a lot of stuff here . 
  the game is not ` basically broken ' . 
  there is a serious glitch yes , but only the north american ps3 goty is affected , you can not cure yourself after becoming a vampire due to a bug in the vampire cure quest . 
  honestly i 'd try to stick with the pc version , due to better graphics and modding potential . 
  not sure what 's your problem with the keyboard , have you actually tried to force yourself to play a bit ? 
  even if at first it 's bad you should easily get used to . 
  i used to play with keyboard and laptop 's touchpad when i was a kid , of course it was terrible at beginning but quickly i got used to . 
  oblivion --  fallout 3 : ** 2 years **, 
  fallout 3 --  skyrim : ** 3 years **, 
  skyrim --  fallout 4 : ** 4 years **, 
  fallout 4 --  tes6 : 5 years ? 
  so , end of 2020 ? 
  games get more and more complex as time goes , so it 's reasonable i guess . 
   because it has an oddball history, 
  i 'm not familiar with this , care to elaborate ? 
  why did you bring up dylann roof ? 
  you know it 's possible for 2 bad things to happen at the same time ? 
   look at the name `` antifa '' it means `` anti-fascist '' they are literally formed to protect themselves against fascism, 
  is this sarcasm ? 
  omg yesterday i checked my mailbox and i had a note with that symbol saying `` we are the nazis !!!, 
  prepare to die !! '', 
  i am __ literally shaking __ because i 'm a green transracial gay otherkin sad how it 's 2017 and such hatred and bigotry still exist . 
  according to marx \u2122 2 +2 = 5 but when countries did 2 +2 they got 4 so it was n't real . 
  checkmate bigot, 
  hahahahaha sure sweetie '' '' '' '' _ [ soon ] ( https://i.redd.it/dyj8dsuace0y.jpg ) \u2122 _ '' '' '' '', 
   drumpf is finished i swear !!, 
  this time 4 real, 
  wait ? 
  did you link to your own comment as evidence ? 
  also [ obama told that an american election ca n't be hacked ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cruh2p_wh_4 ), 
  darn putin hacking american elections !, 
   it was influenced by foreign entities, 
  oh really ? 
  how exactly ? 
  did they force a trump vote at gunpoint ? 
  i do n't think you know what evidence means . 
  evidence is not a / u/boredomenthusiast reddit comment . 
  i suggest you to seriously revise the propaganda you 're pushing . 
  you need to let off the guilt once and for all . 
  you and your government honestly . 
  this is not the 1940s . 
  do people really use linux distro shirts ? 
   left wing politics is entirely based upon violence , namely institutionalizing theft via the expropriation or abolishment of private property . 
  this subreddit is a direct response to the thugs and parasites calling for an expansion of government thievery , violent leftist revolutions , or those who seek to destroy the values & culture of liberty and freedom which are foundations that our western civilization is based upon . 
  it 's on the sidebar, 
  one is conservative biased and other is liberal biased ? 
   using jquery for something that can be done with css, 
  makes me sad, 
  i agree that he was stupid . 
  he went into fucking north korea and somehow thought it was a good idea to steal a poster from a staff-only area . 
  play stupid games , win stupid prizes . 
  one of the most ignorant comment i 've read . 
  you 're aware that ~ ~  90 % ~ ~ + -80 % businesses and startups fail ? 
  that applies to other things in life , you _ will _ fail a lot until you succeed . 
  5 or 6 bankruptcies is nothing when you have hundreds of successful ones . 
  that sounds like something you 'd read off a shitty facebook page . 
  yeah i should n't have put  90 % , usually you hear `` 9/10 business fail '' 8/10 fail etc. . . 
  what matters is that the percentage is high , it 's entrepreneurship 101 . 
  so saying stuff like `` wow trump had 5 or 6 bankruptcies '' just shows how ignorant you are . 
   instead , we got evasion and slipshod displays like putting a sticker on someone else 's steaks in the campaign, 
  i 'm not familiar with this , what are you talking about ?
