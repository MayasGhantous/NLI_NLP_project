  removed only because it is posted already, 
  was n't expecting that , these guys manage to nail it every single time . 
   adobe flash player, 
  should we tell him ? 
  english does n't have a separate word for `` free as in freedom '' , unlike other languages, 
   and updated regularly, 
  not true , libreboot does not distribute microcode updates . 
  source : https://libreboot.org/faq.html#microcode, 
  you did n't read it right . 
  libreboot __ does not __ distribute microcode on processors that do not need microcode updates . 
  newer cpus _ need _ microcode updates so libreboot is not supported . 
  i know about that , i linked the same page you did and read it many times . 
  i was simply correcting / u/creshal statement where he said, 
   you 're still dependent on intel 's proprietary microcode that 's running inside your cpu ** and updated regularly ** . 
  which is not true , would he drop the `` and updated regularly '' he would be correct and i would n't say anything . 
  just wanted to say i 'm glad you switched to a tekken version where you can actually enjoy the game how it 's supposed to . 
  now all you need is to climb ranks so fights are not a one-sided rape . 
  oh and , did you reach fujin in tt2 ? 
  i 'm a big kazuya fanboy but after tekken 7 revelations i 'm inclined more and more towards heihachi . 
  think of it , his wife is a devil , his son and grandson also have demonic powers and what does heihachi have - his pure strength . 
  he does n't need demonic superpowers to kick ass , and that is badass . 
  seriously , the last fight kazuya went from normal to opening a third eye to fully demon then back to normal and it _ still _ was a very close fight . 
  kazuya needed all of that demon faggotry just to narrowly win against pure strength . 
   a friend once asked me to watch a video with her that she was going to display on her computer using netflix . 
  i declined , saying that netflix streaming was such an affront to freedom that i could not be party to its use under any circumstances whatsoever . 
  from his personal webpage . 
   how you rebel against society in this day and age , not being a degenerate . 
  funny how it turned out . 
  just goes to show how fucked up the western world is when you get / pol / which always had edgy extremist out of the ordinary controversial opinions now supports - nuclear family , tradition , self-improvement and basically not being a degenerate . 
  here 's a pic that circulates around / pol / , should give you an idea, 
  this pic that circulates / pol / should give you an idea why, 
  and get that slight lag as the game processes where all the little pieces should fly, 
   i guess people do n't want to hear what problems she has . 
  that 's reddit for you . 
  if your opinion is not circlejerkable the retards press the censor button because feelings are hurt . 
  because last gen hardware was actually good , expensive and thus competitive . 
  remember : sony sold each ps3 at a loss and got their money back with game sales . 
  it 's not the case with this generation . 
  sure they were affordable at release but only because the hardware itself was not only midrange but already becoming outdated . 
  why are you installing in bulk ? 
  of course you will have problems that way . 
  you should, 
  run game, 
  if the game runs fine then goto 1 , if not then it 's time to read the readme and fix things . 
   all the `` guides '' are , well , kind of shit . 
   please do n't just say follow the instructions on each mod page , ** they do n't work **, 
  if the guides were `` shit '' and instructions `` did n't work '' then how come there are thousands of people endorsing and using these mods ? 
  many people work hard during their free time writing guides and instructions to make it a bit easier for the community . 
  just because you 're a retard with short attention span who ca n't follow instructions does n't mean they 're all `` shit '' and `` do n't work '' . 
  like most issues , the problem is between the computer and chair . 
  you 're the one that did n't make the point , all you said is `` cringe '' and `` mental gymnastics '' . 
  i do n't agree with the guy ( i think what he does with the game is degenerate ) but he makes fair points and you do not . 
  your advice transcends tekken and online games , it applies for life in general . 
  the first thing you should do when anything bad happens ( you lost the game , you died in your raid , you failed that class , etc. . . ) is to realize you 're probably the one to blame , plain and simple . 
  no excuses no bullshit , it 's __ your __ fault 99 % of time . 
  and you need to ask yourself - `` what could have __ i __ done differently ? '' . 
  failure is vital in becoming successful , but you need to be able to recognize your failure and act accordingly . 
  if you make excuses ( `` he spammed '' , `` that move is broken '' , `` the exam was hard '' ) you will never improve . 
  the first step on fixing a problem is recognizing that there is a problem . 
  why did you take it personally ? 
   i do n't complain or make excuses for my losses or overestimate how good i am . 
  i know i 'm trash . 
  his advice is for the people that do not have self-awareness like you do . 
  p stands for perfect . 
  normal ewgf is 14f ( 14 frames ) but kazuya is the only one that can also do it in 13f which is called the pewgf . 
  normal ewgf is hard , pewgf is extremely hard . 
  what the juggle combo is should be irrelevant . 
  it 's over once you got launched into the air , all the hard work and mind-games were made _ before _ you got launched . 
  same , as a kid in tekken 4 playing kazuya , i noticed how you did n't need the __ down __ in f , n , __ d __ , d/f so i just skipped it and input only f , n , d/f . 
  so yeah , all my kazuya electrics at the time were pewgfs, 
  i never got quite around how it works , and it 's stupid because even the game itself rewards you with spells that are weakness + damage but , as you know now , they do not work as intended . 
  a pragmatic solution is to just have 2 spells , one weakness and another the damage . 
  on my mage i used to have, 
  100 % weakness to shock , fire and frost for ~ 30 seconds in a 10 ft area, 
  [ x ] shock , fire and frost damage for [ y ] seconds in a 10 ft area, 
  so yeah , cast weakness first then cast your damage spell . 
  also , there 's a `` weakness to magic 100 % '' but i never tried it since i killed pretty much everything one-shot on hardest difficulty so i did n't bother . 
  does it stack with other weaknesses ? 
  does it need to be a 3rd separate spell ? 
  i do n't know ... 
  the game does not actually pick what you 're _ wearing _ at the time , it picks what 's `` best '' for your inventory based on price , armor rating and enchantments at a specific point , which is normally when you meet martin again in cloud ruler temple . 
  you 're not a scrub , you 're simply an inexperienced player . 
  in these last years everyone is careful because everything is offensive so posts like yours are a breath of fresh air . 
  personally i love being trashtalked , if some elitist guy calls me a scrub or noob chances are that he is right and that only serves to motivate me . 
  i trick i used to do is inputting 2 before d/f . 
  the issue might be your timing is right , it 's just that your right hand reacts slower , making you miss the electric . 
  try thinking on inputting 2 before d/f , but do n't think too much and that may help fix the coordination problem . 
  i do not play tekken at the moment and have n't played in years so i ca n't tell you if it worked or not longterm . 
  what ? 
  jin does n't have hellsweep and he has ewhf not ewgf which works fairly differently . 
  1366x768 tn still exists because companies who buy them in bulk do n't care about their employees eye cancer , they want to cut costs . 
  as long there 's a market for it it will continue to exist . 
  you 're right , the virtue signal from eu and globalist deals in general is getting quite annoying . 
  yes , there are 2 inputs for pewgf, 
  normal ewgf --  f , n , d , d/f +2, 
  pewgf 1 --  f , d , d/f +2 ( skip ** neutral ** ), 
  pewgf 2 --  f , n , d/f +2 ( skip ** down ** ), 
  skyrim for the leveling , weapon combat and overall modern features that you 'd expect from a 2011 vs 2006 game . 
  oblivion for the world , quests , soundtrack , factions , anything magic , and a personal favorite - the art style . 
  oblivion 's art style is not only beautiful but also very detailed and vibrant , skyrim 's art style is more dull .
