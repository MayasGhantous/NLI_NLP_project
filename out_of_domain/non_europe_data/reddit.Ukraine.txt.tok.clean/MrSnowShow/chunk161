  example : take a look at flairs in our sub , every icon looks amazing . 
  yes , always but the latest \u2122 and greatest \u2122, 
  ewgf and wgf are not combos , they are moves . 
  kazuya , heihachi and devil jin ( i.e the mishimas ) can all do the move . 
  done by doing a __ c __ rouch __ d __ ash ( f , n , d , d/f ) and pressing 2 ( cd +2 ), 
  the move is almost useless because a superior one exists : ewgf, 
  it 's done by inputting d/f +2 at the same time . 
  ewgf is superior in every way - better damage , faster recovery thus allowing many combos and juggles and safe , gives frame advantage on block ( normal wgf is jab punishable on block ) . 
  instead of normal -1 or +1 point . 
  2 ranks difference is 0.25 points i think . 
  i think the system is bad for ranks , for example that asuka probably got 2 or 3 promotions off you . 
  however if you get `` unfairly '' promoted and end up where you do n't belong , you should be loosing more and getting demoted to a rank closer where you belong . 
  but still i do n't like it . 
  best system would be you can infinite revenge match but as a break point - you can request revenge as long as the difference between wins is at max 1 ( ex : 1-1 , 2-1 , 2-2 , 3-2 , etc. . ) . 
  once you get a 2 win lead it should stop . 
  otgf combos are stylish as fuck . 
  in t7 with rage drive you get a small taste of otgf+k azuya combos . 
  races are spread out like this , based on attributes and skills, 
  mages, 
  * altmer, 
  * female argonian, 
  fighter, 
  * orc, 
  thief, 
  and then you have imperial whose strength is social interactions ( high personality , +10 on speechcraft and mercantile ) and does n't stand out in any particular way like the other races, 
  that there says quite a lot about you, 
  here you go, 
  no , it 's just called a different opinion . 
  a hard concept to grasp for many i guess, 
   im right you 're wrong !, 
  thanks for letting me know you 're a bigot, 
  the hivemind in this thread particularly is horrible . 
  all top comments are simply calling him stupid for having a different opinion than what the hivemind taught them what to think . 
  it 's scary as fuck how leddit managed to grow and influence so many retards, 
   you are in login queue, 
   estimated waiting time : over 9000 hours, 
  no joke , this was a legit message back then . 
  league was becoming so exponentially popular that there were days where you simply could not login or had to wait hours and hours . 
  why the is left so bad with memes ? 
  how out of touch can a person be to produce an abomination like this ? 
  first off the title says `` the_donald irl '' but the memeball has a giant swastika on a strange shade of red background . 
  i guess it 's supposed to be nsdap flag ( because the_donald = nazis ) but did n't even get the flag properly so you need a title to specify who are you talking about , the image is useless by itself . 
  and as a cherry on top it was saved in . jpg because the poor retard does n't know jpeg 's compression algorithm was designed with photo-realistic images in mind , it goes to shit with abrupt color transitions that happen with these type of image . 
  the meme is complete shit from the start and i have n't even touched the important part which is the text . 
  aside from being full of artifacts due to jpeg 's compression , it starts off with, 
   `` complains that non-whites are destroying spanish heritage '' . 
  i never heard anyone saying this . 
  what is it supposed to mean ? 
  how can a non-white destroy spanish heritage ? 
  `` non-whites '' is pretty generalized , you mean a white american could be complaining how a chinese is destroying spanish heritage ? 
  this meme gets a -1 / 10 , yes it managed to slip into negatives . 
  it started with 0/10 without even looking at the content . 
  these memes are supposed to poke fun at straw-mans and slightly exaggerated views but you managed to completely fuck it up by making up an `` argument '' that literally nobody ever said . 
  [ here 's a top tier memeball ] ( http://i.imgur.com/iiynb4t.gif ) , which is why it 's being shared constantly while yours will be only here with 0 points . 
  seriously , can anybody explain me why leftists ca n't do anything properly ? 
  i assume it can go both ways, 
  if you 're attractive it will make girls curious but if you look hideous it will drive them away quicker . 
  copyright is not free market . 
  it 's the complete opposite . 
  it 's the government interfering in the market . 
  copyright - contract between government and artist , granting him a temporary monopoly over his work so he 's more motivated to create more work . 
  originally it was ~ 20 years ( ? ), 
  but artists always argued that it 's not enough so it eventually led to author 's lifetime + 70 years . 
  i 've read some comments and the thing that enrages them is `` this is what russia wanted '' . 
  they truly believe the leader of the most powerful country on earth is a russian puppet . 
  to them - russia = pure evil and we should always do the opposite of what they want . 
  that 's why they also think that kkk supporting trump is a valid argument for his racism . 
  exactly . 
  when default reddit is very supportive/against something i immediately get skeptical because those guys somehow manage to always get it wrong . 
  can you elaborate more on `` alpha male christian dudes '' ? 
  i 'm not religious but i respect christianity and recognize it 's fundamental role in western civilization . 
  trying to understand how exactly it shaped our western society . 
  perhaps i should read the bible , this time not the kid 's version . 
  not only grammar and long sentences but also very inconsistent with spacing and presentation . 
  sometimes you leave a space before _ and _ after a dot , sometimes you do n't leave a space at all before/after a comma , random capital letters , random extra spaces , etc. . . it 's all horribly inconsistent . 
  why would you downvote him ? 
  it 's not a ` disagree ' button . 
  do n't link to facebook please, 
  inform\u00e1tica --  usar as merdas, 
  yes you did . 
  feel free to repost but post the actual image not facebook link to the image . 
  i know it links to the image but you do not need to link an image thought facebook . 
  [ they 're this ] ( https://img.4plebs.org/boards/pol/image/1484/86/1484866619039.png ), 
  just like some left-wing extended their support for sjw anti-western anti-traditionalism , physical_removal is the right-wing extension of anti-sjw pro-western pro-traditionalism . 
   anarchism is a social movement that seeks liberation from oppressive systems of control including but not limited to the state , capitalism , ** racism , sexism , speciesism , and religion ** . 
   this subreddit is a direct response to the thugs and parasites calling for an expansion of government thievery , violent leftist revolutions , ** or those who seek to destroy the values & culture of liberty and freedom which are foundations that our western civilization is based upon ** . 
  not the best examples but highlighted in bold is the `` extension '' i am talking about . 
  of course it matters . 
  you should link images like this - http://i.imgur.com/w6ukjkd.jpg, 
  see the difference ? 
  you click on it and the image immediately opens . 
  your link takes a user to fucking facebook , you have to click a button and then it takes you to the imgur website ( not the image directly ) . 
  if this huge waste of time could be avoided then why not ? 
  also  50 % reddit traffic is through mobile , making the experience even painful . 
  oh and your post was caught in the spam filter so it never appear from the start, 
  once again feel free to repost but do n't make users open 2 full websites to view an image . 
  also help us help you by providing more info about what mods you have and what have you tried to do to fix this . 
  it 's reddit 's spam filter , talk to them about it . 
  linking to facebook is considered `` spammy '' that 's why it got auto-removed . 
  it 's not `` my specific rules '' i 'm merely giving you tips on how to post properly .
