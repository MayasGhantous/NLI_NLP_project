   real bible, 
  what do you mean by this ? 
  what bible is `` real '' ? 
  also do you recommend to start with old or new testimony ? 
   4channers, 
  please do n't do this . 
   in their parents basement posting pepes all day, 
  that 's / r9k /, 
  they were born with inferior genetics , they never felt a woman 's warmth and probably never will . 
  women __ never __ looked at them as a potential mate due to them being essentially genetic trash . 
  ugly males are always creepy and repulsive , they joined the game in very hard difficulty . 
  they at least recognize this and do not try to force society to see them as beautiful . 
  browsing it made me aware of how lucky i was to be born normal . 
  there 's also the occasional `` fuck all women we need to be able to legally rape them '' but those are not top voted posts so i do n't think the majority shares those views . 
  what do you mean not inferior genetics ? 
  having a weak/recessed jaw , negative canthal tilt and essentially weak and recessed skull are things you are born with and have no way of changing naturally . 
  [ look at this example ] ( https://www.dryaremchuk.com/img/mandible_jaw/mandible_implant_new_1.png?t=1427749926336&amp;width=378 ) , went from subhuman to good looking . 
  it 's genes . 
  racismo !, 
  racismo !, 
   but why are they defined as weak ? 
  take a look [ at this picture ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/07/29/72/072972f9d23aa88525ea868eb2023354.jpg ) . 
  you can see that on top right his jaw is recessed and that alone makes the rest of your face ugly . 
  it 's genes , fixable with surgery - chin implants . 
  [ before and after pic ] ( http://www.nzcosmeticsurgery.co.nz/wp-content/gallery/chin-implants/chin-implant-3.jpg ) . 
  obviously he looks a lot better after . 
  you should talk to him after starting the quest . 
  you 're in for a surprise . 
  it 's not subjective . 
  [ please tell me which pic looks better to you ] ( http://www.nzcosmeticsurgery.co.nz/wp-content/gallery/chin-implants/chin-implant-3.jpg ) , left or right ? 
   that 's it, 
  no , that 's not it . 
  it was just an example of how your genes may fuck you up and some characteristics __ will __ make you more attractive that 's entirely dependent on genes . 
  i 'm not an incel but i browsed their sub and they do make some fair points about objective beauty . 
  `` beauty is subjective '' is political correctness bullshit . 
  we deep down know how important looks are and the ugly guys on incels realized this . 
  looks are not everything , it 's sometimes the only thing that matters . 
  [ girls went wild for this gangbanger and rapist only because of his looks ] ( https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/3408090/jeremy-meeks-chloe-green-wife-melissa-worlds-hottest-felon-topshop/ ), 
  reddit shamelessly steals them and make their own version with the original humor sucked out of it, 
  i 'm asking for your opinion and you refuse to answer because objectively he looks better on the right and you ca n't spin it , so you just ignore it . 
  it 's not just chin , i gave chin as an example as what can make you objectively ugly . 
  no amount of showers or gym or personality will fix your [ fucked up bone structure ] ( http://imgur.com/n8epzqk ) < -- only way for this guy to be attractive is photoshop because his face is fucked to the core . 
  incels are on a whole another level of misery . 
  genetic trash essentially . 
  [ no woman looks at them as a potential mate ] ( https://g.redditmedia.com/ybbpzf2ontuncosyf05xcixqhzitxbivf1pk4wu2dta.gif?w=320&amp;s=e9561aebbe1b2742e7e6d77c3b52a040 ) . 
  nature is cruel but that 's the way it is . 
  incels discovered this and there is nothing they can do . 
  jeremy meeks is living proof that looks is pretty much all that matters , so much that even if you 're a piece of shit gangbanger criminal suddenly it [ does n't matter ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/bqqxdofccamxrhd.jpg ) . 
  not at all . 
  clearly you have n't interacted with each community long enough to figure out the differences . 
  also the fact that you said the word ' 4channers ' is also proof you do n't really know 4chan culture as you think you do, 
  have you tried actually reading the install instructions ? 
  you 're talking out of your ass . 
  ps4 has higher input lag and that 's a fact , being used in tournaments is not an argument . 
  mishimas are just on another category , accept it . 
  being much harder than your average tekken character is part of the charm . 
  it may or not be your thing . 
  not at all . 
  if you play high execution characters you will get more handicapped than a person playing a `` normal '' character . 
  what he is trying to do is fool himself into thinking that his inferior version is not that inferior . 
  it is . 
  i 'm curious , what do you think classifies as ` skill ' in tekken ? 
  still trying to fit in are ya ? 
  but that 's jdcr , dude is so good that he can adjust his gameplay for taking into account a few frames . 
  other people ca n't do that so the laggier version affects them more, 
  so true . 
  they bitch about brainwashing while saying dead serious that `` reality has a liberal bias '' . 
  it 's cute . 
  the 120 ssd is probably the default one . 
  i 'd get the 320 hdd and use the extra money to buy a good ssd like samsung 's , it should be better . 
  that 's entirely up to you . 
  do you need extra battery life or not ? 
  i 'm also like you at 35/62 wh but i have access to power outlets almost everywhere i use it ( university ) so a mild inconvenience does not justify $ 80 . 
   i got tricked, 
   ppl here pressured me to do so, 
   and in pretty sure he knows what he is talking about, 
  why are you so easily indoctrinated ? 
  i 'm really not a fan of these shitty memes but also do not want to arbitrarily remove posts , what do / r/oblivion ? 
  edit : you can also help by downvoting, 
  i 'm asking / r/oblivion opinion on what should i do , as a mod . 
  perfect example of scrub mentality - `` you can only play by my arbitrary rules '', 
  i really enjoy king , he 's very unique . 
  he 'd probably be my main if mishimas did n't exist . 
  you may not like what he is saying but downvoting it wo n't make it wrong, 
  queria o primeiro livro da s\u00e9rie _ culture of critique _ - _ a people that shall dwell alone _ . 
  [ persuasion attempt of somebody who suffered direct consequences of the ideology i 'm advocating ], 
  come on now !, 
  the earth went around the sun 2017 times since the birth of jesus christ , how is this not an argument ? 
  those specific shades of blue and red mesh so well together, 
  rolling stone went full huffington shitpost-style garbage ` appeal to emotion ' journalism . 
   best ending i 've ever read . 
  i really hated how he just stopped following julia, 
  you 're on reddit for 4 years , you should 've known better that the reddit community does n't use upvote/downvote the right way - they use them as agree/disagree buttons , and i do n't think that 's gon na change anytime soon . 
  the system is fine for things like cute kittens or sharing your epic custom playstation controller or whatever but it 's terrible for discussion and opinion sharing . 
  to elaborate a bit further , reddit is an echochamber . 
  there is a general approved mentality and if you deviate from that you will get downvoted , reported and perhaps even banned . 
  what fuels this machine even more are imaginary internet points . 
  everybody is so afraid of loosing karma and on some comments you can actually see a descent into madness through his edit : 's because he received 1 downvote . 
  karma is such a cancerous system , it 's removal would greatly improve this site and end karma whores and their virtual dick-measuring contest . 
  yes , reddit hates elitism in general because of muh equality and all that .
