  * bullshit prices, 
  and more , these is why i do n't use apple products because i like the total opposite : ** freedom ** and ** open source **, 
  department of redundancy department . 
  you also have armed to the teeth right ? 
  archwiki is really amazing , wish debian had one like that too because come on , debian was one of the first distros so it should have collected alot of info by now . 
  honestly , after that week i see much less peasantry posts hitting the hot section ... 
  seriously how the fuck could anyone think that eyes work in fps ? 
  but it 's still nice to know that if you use arch you have a huge wiki that helps you alot and is specific to you . 
  i 'm still new but when i get more experience i 'm totally moving to arch , still got ta learn the diferent `` parts '' so that i can have a functional system without missing anything important . 
  this reminds me of the disastrous xbox one e3 where the man mentioned `` tv '' more than gaming . 
  ( ca n't link video i 'm on phone ), 
  / r/linuxmasterrace needs some love . 
  the grammar is very suspicious also . 
  check also at / r/buildapc, 
  and here i am reading reddit in class ... so ironic . 
  one thing i learned is that if i ever move to america , i can not afford to become sick . 
  non transparent conkys ruin wallpappers imo . 
  even though steam and valve are a big part of pc gaming , the banner should also include other companies just like the old one . 
  ( i still only saw the gaben in the old banner because of 1366x768 laptop ), 
  as am i typing this the page is moving , i guess you 're working that 's good :d, 
  the terminal idea is great , but the colors contrast is bad and the reply comments become white and it hurts to look at . 
  i did it because i accidentaly joined a mp server and it had the thing when someone completes a quest you got buttload of xp and it ruined my char so i just hacked him all the way to power 100 . 
  but my second char is all legit level 14 or whatever . 
  but i 'm not unlocking anything new since quests spells and crafting are still very limited so i did n't play much more . 
  consoles : hey i got these games for you , they 're ** free ** . 
  peasants : omg that 's awesome how can i get them ? 
  consoles : just give me money regularly . 
  peasants : best company ever they give us free games in exchange of money . 
  * logical thinking just got raped *, 
  speaks french ... fuk knows bitch, 
  ahahahhaha this part is hilarilous, 
  i 'm not a huge expert in fps games ... but i think cs players totally wreck any cod console peasants . 
  normally the highest fov , but ... 
  in borderlands 2 for example the max fov is good , while in dishonored it feels weird so i have it a little bit less . 
  i love how he says to kill the vigilant of stendarr :, 
  * weeeeak ... he 's weak ... you 're strong , crush him *, 
  made me want to kill him x100 more . 
  ** performance ** : 780 and 290 \u2264 290x \u2264 780 ti, 
  ( simplified prices , they 're always + $ 20-40 ), 
  r9 290x - $ 500, 
  okay so if you with 290 or 290x which price is $ 200 or $ 300 less you will get just a little bit less frames than the 780 ti or even better performance in some games . 
  amd is just the best in terms of price/performance . 
  if not for them , we would be probably paying way more for cpus and gpus . 
  it 's an amazing game for an alpha . 
  and ten times more fun with friends . 
  quick research in one webpage, 
  ** cards : **, 
  290x ( 1115 mhz / 5.67 ghz ), 
  average fpses, 
  ** crysis 3 **, 
  ** tomb raider **, 
  of course more research should be done before conclude anything . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.hardocp.com/article/2014/01/13/asus_r9_290x_directcu_ii_oc_overclocking_review/5#.u5cpdijrz6k ), 
  performance / price-o-meter, 
  ** very bad [ ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... . . | ... ] very good **, 
  would n't the card just melt ? 
  thanks , i 'm new to linux . 
  is this good :, 
  sudo shred dev/sda1, 
  because grub says windows is on dev/sda1, 
  also what is the diference between shred and rm ? 
  yes but nobody buys ref cards of the 290/290x . 
  what can you tell me about i3 vs openbox ? 
  okay so i changed my flair text , should look more `` professional '' now haha . 
  `` work '', 
  * launches screenfetch and reddit *, 
  hello again , i was looking at these tiling wms and do you have any experience with them ? 
  especially i3 seems to be really popular . 
  of course they hate microsoft ... why the fuck they made a weaker console in terms of pure performance in games and still charge you more for it ? 
  what a ripoff . 
  and you remember the e3 where they said games had activation keys , kinect always on , needed internet connection ... 
  they obviously were trying to rip off even more but atleast sony did n't go the same way and forced microsoft to remove that bullshit . 
  how can someone be so blind and still give them money for their shitty console ? 
  ps : i 'm not a fanboy because i do n't own either system . 
  why do i want those voice commands and ability to watch tv on my tv on a ** gaming ** system ? 
  i want the best possible peformance in games rather than some features non-gaming related . 
  most aaa games run @ 720p or 792p ( which is a joke ) , 30 fps and reduced fov , hardware is seriously underpowered for the price . 
  seriously why would i buy it if for the same money i can play @ 1080p ? 
  what marketing scheme ? 
  explain please . 
  sounds to me that you 're the one that `` fell '' for the marketing schemes , since you are n't capable of basic logical thinking . 
  let me explain to you , xbox provides you with :, 
  * inferior hardware, 
  * locks you down to only them ( only use their headset , console bans etc. . ), 
  * forced to buy gold if you want to use internet on your xbone, 
  * charges you more but gives less performance, 
  and more stuff and you 're saying that i 'm the one who fell for the marketing schemes while you 're the one locked down with a device without any freedom ? 
  the ps4 is indeed more powerful but i do not play on consoles . 
  i do n't want to insult anyone i 'm just trying to understand ** why ** someone would buy a product that clearly is inferior in performance which is the most important aspect in a ** gaming ** device . 
  i would understand if it was cheaper then there would be a reason but it is not .

  hmm i guess got ta go check out bspwm . 
  does it have same keyboard focus as i3 ? 
  enjoying the entire experience with inferior overpriced hardware ... 
  also paying for gold ... 
  wm - none ? 
  is that possible ?
