  is that screenfetch ? 
  i tried, 
  sudo aptitude install screenfetch, 
  but it does n't work, 
  because * archey * draws me a debian logo . 
  awesome !, 
  ( i do n't know if you do n't mind answering stuff to me about linux but ... ), 
  did you ever use any of the bsd ? 
  ohh i see . 
  another question ( are u fucking serious dude ) :, 
  how do you edit the config files on your system ? 
  do you use a file manager like thunar or just use ranger and nano ? 
  is it possible to edit with terminal ? 
  because if i type for example, 
  / etc/default/keyboard, 
  i get error because is n't no command , so i guess i need a program to edit the file , right ? 
  x1 is at the same price but performs worse . 
  wtf ? 
  wow that 's a total new level of badassery for me, 
  i used to think like :, 
  `` people who use linux are badass hackers '' , after learning more i though `` people who do n't use a de are the real deal '' and now it 's without a wm are the ultimate bosses . 
  just saw some stuff abou vim ... 
  i guess i just stick with ranger and nano for now haha . 
  geany is too gui-ish but useful because i can have open alot of config files at once and do n't need to navigate folders . 
  is this possible with vim and nano ? 
  oooh and one more . 
  when you put in a usb flash drive or a cd how do you browse them on a minimal system with no file managers ? 
  i guess you never played on a pc then to say `` it looks great '' about x1 . 
  did you ever try something else than xbox ? 
   like you can tell the diference between 720 and 900, 
  you say this because you do n't have it , you try to convince yourself that you do n't need it because you already did the purchase and do n't want to feel bad about it , i understand this because not everyone wants to accept that they were wrong . 
  the problem with consoles is that they give you an inferior system , charge you money for it , make you hold on that piece of junk for 8 years before give you an option for a bullshit upgrade with no backwards compability . 
  if you take into account the bussiness stategy of both microsoft and sony , you 'll find out that it is just a big systematic ripoff of uneducated customers . 
  here is what describes your behavior . 
  ( sorry for it to be a bit circlejerky but it still represents the truth ) [ this ] ( https://www.lucidchart.com/publicsegments/view/53922bd8-aa24-4451-a2ea-5d2c0a0050d8/image.png ), 
  how am i trying to piss him off ? 
  we 're having a discussion about console gaming and i want to know why the hell would i buy a system that clearly is a huge ripoff because with the same money i could get somethign that performs much better and is more open . 
  you do n't really make points , all you say is that you like the xbox experience and do n't care about graphics . 
  those are purely subjective , while i 'm trying to tell you objective points and you ignore them , here are they again :, 
  * bad performance and big price , ( seriously wtf is 792p ? , it clearly shows how desperate this console is ), 
  * restrictive bullshit ( ca n't use own headset , needs to but $ 25 [ adapter ] ( http://www.xbox.com/en-us/xbox-one/accessories/headsets/stereo-headset-adapter#fbid=mm0uloq-iby ) , gets console [ banned ] ( http://www.cinemablend.com/images/sections/60440/_1384023658.jpg ), 
  * countless times games had to be stripped down because of console limitations ( ex : unreal engine 4 , skyrim cities etc. . . ), 
  the thing is that they 're lying to you infront of your face constantly and ripping off while you just allow them instead of demanding quality products , they just see you as a person who has falllen to their marketing schemes . 
  tri-x costs $ 425, 
  vapor-x costs $ 458, 
  tri-x clocked at 850 mhz while vapor-x i at 1,03 ghz . 
  is it really worth it $ 30 ? 
  could n't i overclock the tri-x to be the same clock as vapor-x and have like +3 \u00bac ? 
  how much it was ? 
  edit : red team ftw !, 
  atleast he got the name of pc parts right , there are some peasants that go like :, 
  * i own e9 fx 14770k @ 5ghz cooled in the south pole with a geforce gtx hd r10 9970 ti acx tri-x , vapor-x lightning gaming edition that i bough from nsa 's supercomputers . 
  i play on 3 4k @ 420hz @ 420 fps special edition signed by snoop dogg and wiz khalifa monitors . 
  but all of this suck so hard you ca n't even imagine , smooth 792p with a smooth 30 fps is all i need *, 
   just installed a new installation, 
  welcome to the departament of redundancy departament . 
  i found funny the windows thing haha . 
  by extended partition you mean dynamic volume or is it different ? 
  190 $ wtf !, 
  so cheap . 
   amd radeon hd 7800 series ( 1mb ), 
  what kind of 78xx ? 
  really ... 
  [ knights of the nine ] ( http://www.uesp.net/wiki/oblivion:knights_of_the_nine ) was a dlc for oblivion !, 
  awesome find . 
  did n't like it much though because i 'm not a paladin type character . 
  is it the 7870 ? 
  the problem is with these console is that instead of providing you acess to exclusive games and being `` best buddies '' . 
  they instead hold the games hostage , because they know that the average uneducated customer will go buy their console for these 6 hour single player `` next gen '' exclusives : less gameplay more cutscenes fuck yeah , true next gen !, 
  ( at 900p upscaled and * silky smooth * 30 fps ), 
  that 's cheydinhal dude ... 
  i hope that you are a troll , but if you 're not i have this to say . 
  i could use the same skill argument on this : * it takes alot of skill to cut a tree with a knife , anyone can do it with a chainsaw . 
  * sounds retarded right ? 
  exactly like controller vs kb + mouse . 
  oooh anvil home , the one with the * ghosts * . 
  damn oblivion 's quests sure are unique and caught me multiple times by surprise . 
  it does not `` take more skill '' , it is just a handicapped fps experience . 
  and to add insult to injury some games even have reduced fov . 
  what the fuck happened to actually * replying * to their post instead of making a new one ? 
  why you do n't have dragonborn dlc ? 
  you would witness a tentacle madness right there . 
  step 1 . 
  buy a pc, 
  step 2 . 
  thank you and have a nice day . 
  if you need any help just contact any of the pc guys , they love to help . 
  if you decided to follow steps 1 and 2 , then i have to say [ this ] ( http://www.tickld.com/cdn_image_content/84943.jpg ), 
  ** radical entertainment **, 
  prototype was painfully average but prototype 2 was a much better experience , i could play prototype 2 over and over if my pc did n't overheat . 
  by handicapped i mean it is crippeled down . 
  oooh the sweet internet points , right !, 
  so true . 
  peasants instead of demanding quality products , are so brainwashed that they just defend them blindly . 
  do n't get me wrong , i like the idea of a console : a gaming device for ** casual ** gaming and stuff , but it 's so poorly executed but they get away with it because of fanboyism and marketing bullshit . 
  even todd howard said the the real elder scrolls experience is on the pc . 
  serial downvoter here ? 
  i 'm level 41 i think ... once you get there maybe we can play . 
  ctrl + shift + p, 
  wan na know why ?
