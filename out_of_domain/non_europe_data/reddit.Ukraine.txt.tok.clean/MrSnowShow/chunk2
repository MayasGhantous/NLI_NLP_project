  loot in skyrim is n't that exciting as in games like borderlands or torchlight . 
  me getting 1st pc at age of 9 . 
  playing games that literally came out of cereal boxes , crazy taxi and startsky & hutch . 
  and later got gta sa , my dad was like `` look there 's an 18 there '' and me `` oh that does n't mean anything it 's fine '' . 
  then i was playing with my mom around and ryder said in the 1st mission `` keep up motherfucker '' my mom like `` what did he say ? 
  '' , lucky me she did n't know english well ahahaha . 
  i do n't think ps4 and x1 will hold for long like the ps3 and x360 did . 
  so in like 2 years pc will totally crush consoles even more and more ppl will realise how this gen consoles are so weak, 
  when peasants will understand that framerate is not a preference ? 
  peasants need to understand that framerate is not a preference . 
  love the # 1 < 3, 
  [ this is also good ] ( http://30vs60fps.com ), 
  i always knew x1 is total shit and a total dumb fuck would buy this console . 
  i can not understand how can someone be so blind when x1 is the biggest fucking ripoff of the console history . 
  ooh i see ... 
  thanks , glad that my playstyle is effective ^ ^, 
  ty for help :d, 
  oh i did n't know that self posts dont award karma so i did n't want to look like a karma whore . 
  ( reddit user for not so long and most of time was only reading ), 
  it may be a little offtopic but can you explain what do you feel with claustrophobia ? 
  because i 'm the opossite ( claustrophilic ? 
  ) , i like being in closed space where i have what i need like a ma own little space pretty cool . 
  oblivion had ** depth ** and ** immersion ** in those awesome quests and npcs . 
  when you enter a guild you actually feel and that you are insignificant in a big and organized guild and slowly rise in ranks and become more noticable and eventually become guildmaster . 
  in skyrim your progression is not even tracked and guild questlines are too short and you become guildmaster far too fast which breaks immersion and ** you do n't even get recognized as being a guildmaster ** . 
  example : * so you 're brynjolf 's new protege ... * ** no !, 
  i 'm fucking the guildmaster . 
  ** it totally breaks immersion everytime i go inside ratway . 
  human eye cant even see past dirt so why bother with fancy blocks lol fgt, 
  ** maven black-briar ** : * bla bla bla , make me angry and i 'll contact the dark brotherhood * . 
  bitch please i 'm the listener and i ai n't doing shit for you . 
  i really hate how in skyrim they made dark brotherhood a very common thing , example : in skyrim you talk to npcs that say `` eh i did some jobs for the dark brotherhood '' , like wtf is this bullshit ? 
  in oblivion db was a secret organization and i remember that lucien lachance told you that when there 's a contract you must accept it and you can not simply leave the dark brotherhood . 
   ruled out japan, 
  english is not my native language , does it mean that there will be no japanese ac ? 
  if not japanese then atleast chinese ac would be awesome . 
  omg sell that x1 piece of shit now unless you want to get buttfucked by microsoft jesus christ x1 biggest shit ever, 
  maybe i sound angry xd but i really started to hate x1 when i learned how it 's a huge ripoff and the worst console ever . 
  i knew this comment would get hated but w/e . 
  it was n't my intention to be a dick, 
  * less expensive mobo, 
  * drop the 10000 rpm hdd and get a 7200 rpm, 
  * put all that money that you saved on a better gpu, 
  i just use vampire lord for role-playing purposes - * ugh too many enemies time to transform blabkalbalaglalbla fear my wrath minions *, 
   skyrim is officially boring for me . 
  what the hell ? 
   ( xbox360 ), 
  oh i see why, 
  * what 's a loading screen ? 
  * - ssd, 
  i can emulate them on pc . 
  showboating ? 
  it was just a joke about ssds ... 
  ye ps4 gets updates with latests graphics and rams so it gets better everyday while you pc fgts hate to update ur stoopid pc every year to play games at good settings lol stoopid nerds . 
  i do n't think you understand , but fps is n't a ** preference ** . 
  bigger numbers = better . 
  * cinematic 24 fps feel * that 's just some bullshit that peasants made up . 
  gon na make one right now . 
  * stay tuned * xd, 
  i think you are paying too much for a useless 4gb 760 . 
  with that money you can get a nice 770 . 
  correct me if i 'm wrong, 
   i used to be a pc gamer but pcs sux !, 
  i had a gtx 790 titan ti 10gb but i still think that xbox looks better, 
  why the fuck do these idiots keep telling that they were pc gamers ? 
  [ watch at 0:50 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0dxtovi2yo ), 
  i think the 270x is so expensive in canada cuz of miners , switch to 660 ti , 760 or 750 ti ? 
  correct if im wrong cuz im on phone atm . 
  i heard somewhere * why people say that america is the dumbest country ? 
  i 'm american and i think that europe is the dumbest country *, 
  it 's because peasants see trailers and demonstrations from pcs, 
  i always have one piece of each precious gem :, 
  * diamond, 
  * emerald, 
  * garnet, 
  * ruby, 
  y u join the imperial dogs ? 
  what 's with the resolution ( 1360x768 ) and why a gt 640 ? 
  but da impiruls be all pussies surrender to fuken elves and suck their deeck and remove talos n shit, 
  that 's 6 seconds per frame, 
  watafok m8 , empaiur is so weak dat cant even handle skyrim civil war n u tink dey can win war vs thalmor faggets ? 
  fuk this weak empire dats why strmclk make revolution cuz we r too stronk, 
  [ it 's from a song which lyrics chorus is `` psycho killer qu'est - ce que c'est '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx6fstiq6ls ), 
  oh thanks ** professor ** - turtle, 
  it is a great game for an alpha and even better multiplayer, 
  but one big problem : wollay doens ' t update this game for very long time . 
  most alpha games get a fuckton of updates but this one has been around for years and still in alpha 0.1.1 ? 
  it has so much potential ... wollay pls : c, 
  i ca n't use a controller anymore for years . 
  i got all 120 stars on super mario 64 using keyboard and mouse . 
  what the hell is wrong with me, 
  yes , my mind kinda thinks that software is just virtual so it is n't worth paying while hardware is physical so its ok . 
  i force myself to think otherwise but i just ca n't :( . 
  $ 1k budget and getting only a 750 ti : s, 
  but even if you did get a better card ( 770 ) it says in pcpartpicker that it wont fit unless you cut something, 
  dmz 's build is the best it comes with a 770 you should change it :d, 
  i got * one * word for you : ** killablechildren **, 
  wont that cpu bottleneck ? 
  [ u/dmz _ dragon ] ( http://www.reddit.com/user/dmz_dragon ) will make the best build using your money :d, 
  how the fuck ?
