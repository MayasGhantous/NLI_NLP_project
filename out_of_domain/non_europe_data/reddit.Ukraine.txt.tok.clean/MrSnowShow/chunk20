  it 's because ctrl + shift + ** p ** or ** n **,

  / u/the _ penis_wizard after like 4 or 5 times finally managed to get claim / r/oblivion . 
  all hail / u/the _ penis_wizard !, 
  thanks for the feedback . 
  i 'm trying to use the same colors and schemes like the original game 's ui . 
  basing on [ this ] ( http://www.pibweb.com/review/images/oblivion_quest.jpg ), 
  thanks again for the feedback and keep it coming . 
  ps : 1st day of actual cssing so i 'm at the moment is only capable of basic stuff but i 'm learning and i like to do it . 
  balancing the damages at later levels . 
  seriously , in medium dificulty i one shot everything with my spells but take ages of sword swinging to kill anything . 
  that 's because weapons only get a max 30 dmg and my spells do 400 base or whatever and if i add 100 % weakness then it doubles i think . 
  i 'm sorry about this , but with my css knowledge ( 2nd day of cssing ) i still ca n't get it right for both 1366x768 laptop users and 1920x1080 desktop users . 
  also the 500kb limit on images limits me further . 
  but it 's a constant work-in-progress so you 'll be seeing improvments . 
  thanks for the feedback . 
  * second day of cssing here . 
  i added the code , but ( to me ) nothing happened . 
  what does it do ? 
  i used ` . pagename a ` to make the banner instead of ` #header - image-left ` or something like that , do n't know if that matters ... 
  you can check the stylesheet at ` reddit.com/r/oblivion/about/stylesheet` and if you want to help , just message . 
  thanks for the feedback . 
  that would be awesome , since i 'm no artist . 
  ( i made that one in paint haha ), 
  oh and will you make a banner with brown color scheme like the original game ? 
  but you do n't need to rush it . 
  we will probably make a banner contest later to see which one the community wants . 
  you do n't need to rush it because we will probably host a showcase and the community would decide . 
  if you want you can also make a oblivion-themed reddit alien ( in imperial armor , daedric or blades armor , etc. . . ), 
  good to know that , thanks for help :d, 
  i have no idea , but the wikis always refer main charcter in oblivion as * the hero of kvach *, 
  done . 
  pretty pictures and text so people can still write silly funny stuff ( :, 
  ^ a ^ little ^ bit ^ late, 
  the reason he went to prison is because , as a breton , was a master of gastronomy . 
  but little they knew that he was also a moon sugar/skooma dealer , that is until the day he got caugh . 
  after escaping through the sewers with the blades , he decided that he wanted an adventurer 's life . 
  problem was , he was not a good warrior . 
  he read in some books that vampirism gave , among other things , agility and strength . 
  since he was tired of normal food , vampirism would him in that too , because a vampire only needs blood . 
  so he decided to become a vampire , and became infected through contact with some dead vampires that he found on a cave outside cheydinhal . 
  after becoming a vampire and still being very human-like , he went to the mages guild in search of arcane powers . 
  eventually he became the arch-mage and had crafted the most powerful spell combo avaliable to his magicka reserves . 
  but his vampirism consumed him over time , so he had to do something : that 's where he decided to join a vampire hunting guild , what is a better way for a vampire to hide than to pretend he hunts them ? 
  he was bound to some factions , but still felt alone . 
  so by murdering glarthir in skingrad , he was recruited by the dark brotherhood . 
  there he found another vampire fellow and was accepted as family despite being a child of the night . 
  this is what i 'm hoping for in the next elder scrolls . 
  todd howards said that true elder scrolls experience is on pc so i hope they will, 
  * take advantage of multiple cores and ( if possible ) hyperthreading, 
  * more keybinds ( seriously we have a keyboard full of buttons ), 
  * higher res textures, 
  * pc specific ui ( hey bethesda , did you ever wonder why the top mods for oblivion and skyrim are darnified ui and skyui respectively ), 
  * support for high fps ( in skyrim if your fps is way too high then the game starts to do some fucking crazy shit ), 
  * no console limitations/downgrades should come to pc, 
  compared to skyrim , every faction questline was more longer , interesting and with alot of twists . 
  that 's fucking retarded ... not allowed to change flair, 
  have n't seen one of those in years ... thank god for adblock . 
  29.97 fps to be precise . 
  therefore , the $ 4000 that the * pc master race * spends on achieving those 60 fps , all go to waste . 
  but they do not seem to understand how our eyes work , so that 's why ** me ** - an educated console gamer - knows that a $ 500 console will provide me with the best possible gaming experience for the price . 
  microsoft and sony all provide me with * free * games every month so i save even more money . 
  i recommend waiting for a goty sale , the amout of dlc is ridiculous so it 's just better to wait for a glorious goty sale . 
  please read our sidebar for all of that , and also a wiki is coming very soon . 
  those are recomended mods . 
  the list was updated in our wiki but we are going to enable wiki very soon ( probably today ) so stay tuned . 
  * best mods * is very subjective . 
  so if you want to ride on dragons in oblivion , then i advice you google something like `` oblivion riding dragons mod '' . 
  i hope you do n't mind that your submission is not approved because we recently claimed this sub after years without active moderators and these posts were flooding this sub like crazy . 
  my advice is , regardless of subreddit , is to read the sidebar before posting . 
  it will probably have most frequent questions already answered . 
  anyway , welcome to reddit !, 
  depends on what you want to do . 
  if your character 's a mage , then you might consider joining with the mages guild or if your you 're a warrior then search for the fighters guild , etc. . . 
  maybe you would want to prove yourself that you 're a badass gladiator , then why not heading down to the arena ? 
  try to * role play * your character , what does he want to do ? 
  what are his moralities ? 
  what he wants to become ? 
  what are his goals ? 
  etc. . . 
  our wiki is now open , the button is on top , near * hot * * new * etc. . . 
  oblivion goty will probably go  75 % discount for sure on the steam sale . 
  and ** i think ** when gmg says that you need steam , they will give you a steam key , otherwise you need to install their client . 
  ^ need ^ confirm, 
  of course you can , oblivion 's a 2006 game . 
  did you really need a laptop ? 
  because `` gaming '' laptops and generally the prebuild computers have terrible price/performance ratios . 
  with that money , you could buy yourself a desktop pc with double the performance . 
  ^ pardon ^ my ^ stupidity, 
  i do n't get it ... 
  you love being in emperor 's dreams ? 
  i ** strongly ** recommend not buy a prebuild `` gaming '' pc ( alienware ibuypower etc. . . ) . 
  they most of the time come with an unecessary i7 along with a shitty $ 100 gpu and your games run like crap . 
  you will get more performance , cheaper , better warranties , no bloatware , costumizability if you build a computer yourself . 
  currently playing a light armored restoration character .
