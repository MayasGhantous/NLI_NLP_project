  but forget all of that about what is op and what is not and just play the game , trying stuff , what works and what not . 
  you gave me a new topic for our faq , thank you !, 
  lol pcfag ubisoft said fc4 will be equal to pc ultra high max settings so you waste $ 21428591285 on ur pc 4 graphix and i only $ 500 so loss is all on you fgt get ur facts straight fgt nerd !, 
  on a side note , this might become peasant 's new argument , `` lol devs said its equal to pc ultra high '' . 
  how we will explain them the conspiracy behind the gaming industry for these pathetic `` next '' - gen ? 
  holy fucking shit dude . 
  you have 32 gigs of ram , i7 4770k , a $ 200 mobo , and only a radeon hd 7950 ? 
  tagged as watch_dogs hero, 
  why a 4350 cpu ? 
  wow this one is genious , definetly should go to the [ repository ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/wiki/repository ) so we can at anytime show this to any peasant . 
  oh god why this has only 100 upvotes ? 
  this is fucking hilarious !, 
  okay can someone explain me anal ? 
  i do n't fuck much but i think that the ass was made to take a shit and not to insert a fucking dick . 
  gog is really investing in pc gaming , which is very nice . 
  they also know that drm only hurts the real costumers . 
  it is cheaper to buy those games indivually on steam rather than paying for a ps + subscription . 
  also you can not acess those `` free '' games once you stop paying . 
  oh god . 
  there was a peasant like that `` 60 fps makes the game twice as short so i prefer 30 '', 
  are you serious or just a sarcastic comment ? 
  i ca n't believe sony has the balls to ask $ 60 for a game again . 
  the area between chorrol and skingrad is my favourite , as is under around cheydinhal . 
  those are the ones more forest-like . 
  and i also like how some places resemble other provinces , like bruma area reminds of skyrim and leyawiin area is swampy because that is what black marsh probably looks like . 
  i really miss the popups and the sound effect of when your quest gets updated . 
  something about it made me very excited ( now that i think about it , i think it is one of the many things that make oblivion more * fantasy-like * ) rather than just `` go speak to the jarl '' boring message that hovered for 5 seconds before dissapearing . 
  sex scenes when my parents walk by . 
  i 'm a fucking pretty princess !, 
  ( gamer poop : skyrim anyone ? ), 
  it also happens in physics too . 
  atoms looking like the solar system , and more minor stuff that i ca n't recall right now . 
  oh and i have physics and chemistry exam tomorrow and i 'm here almost midnight ... redditing instead of studying . 
  god no what a nighmare !, 
  i hate how google buys anything that starts to grow and just forces its users to use google features . 
  it first started out as wanting to feel like a pro lol player because lol streamers browsed reddit . 
  so i just opened up the / r/leagueoflegends and ocasionally read some stuff that was there . 
  fast forward half a year later i 'm completely hooked and modding one sub . 
  a healthy lifestyle is just the slowest way to die . 
  why hamachi ? 
  why not simply opening ports so we could just enter the ip and be done with it ? 
  also , did they fix the bug where in multiplayer servers you received a shitton of xp because of other people doing quests ? 
  it ruined my first character ... 
  sorry for the retard question but i 'm on phone atm and cant browse . 
  did cw get a pvp update or is it somekind of mod/hack that servers did ? 
  pretty old, 
  you should really learn to port forward . 
  it saves so much time and is much more smoother than using hamachis and tunngles . 
  also some routers have support ddns which is even more smoother because instead of giving your friends your ip ( it is worse if it is dynamic ) , you can give them sort of like a site address because it 's easier to remember . 
  ( facebook.com is easier to remember than 173.252.110.27 ), 
  that 's how dungeons are supposed to be , dark and scary . 
  also i recommend getting a night eye mod because the default one is just bad . 
  here is part of the text from the [ recommended mods ] ( http://reddit.com/r/oblivion/wiki/index/mods ) wiki page :, 
  * [ detect life and night-eye shader ] ( http://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/36407/ ? ), 
  - oblivion 's [ vanilla night-eye ] ( http://static-1.nexusmods.com/15/mods/101/images/36407-5-1294000860.jpg ) removes information about where the shadows and light are , and also the rather opaque blue color is not very nice . 
  this mod [ fixes ] ( http://static-3.nexusmods.com/15/mods/101/images/36407-1-1294000928.jpg ) both of these issues and comes with various colors . 
  also has a detect life replacment should you want it too . 
  role-play as a dark healer !, 
  pretend you are going to heal them , but the side effect is a short paralize , but just kill them instead !, 
  i find funny the look of your cat after barbas said that . 
  ps : y u no punchcat ? 
  this made me laugh more than i expected haha !, 
  also reminded me of a post about a game where you can select a name for your horse and the guy named him `` my dick '' . 
  * can you ride my dick ? 
  * i just washed my dick for you . 
  found this gem on facebook as you can see by the link, 
  gta 4 is just a terrible mess in terms of optimization so it 's okay . 
  hope gta 5 will not go the same way . 
  i just hope reddit does n't go the same way that many websites/games went by ruining the classical design . 
  ** if it ai n't broken , then do n't fix it **, 
  well , this is * youdontsurf \u2122 * content , only 9gag grabbed it and put their stupid watermark ... 
  ** first of all , happy cakeday !, 
  now to the matter at hand . 
  the snoo should be oblivion related for example a know character , like mehrunes dagon or sheogorath . 
  or just the reddit alien in some armor ( blades , imperial , imperial dragon , daedric ) any suggestions ? 
  personally i like the mehrunes dagon idea , because this game is called tes iv : oblivion and not tes iv : cyrodiil so it 's more about the evil thread . 
  about the size , no need for a specific size , it only needs to fit on the banner . 
  ( the current banner has 150px height excluding the brown border so that should be the maximum ), 
  and the format should be . png or . jpg because reddit supports these two ( as far as i know ) . 
  edit : also if possible , make the background transparent . 
  wow it 's awesome , already added it and if you hover over with your mouse it will show a message crediting you . 
  thank you ( :, 
  ( oh and can everyone see the message when you hover over with your mouse ? 
  because i 'm on linux at the moment but i have n't tried in windows yet because last time i tried it did n't work ), 
  oh and if you did n't know , it doens ' t have to be necessarely a small picture with `` reddit '' on the left , it could also be a bigger reddit alien only . 
  but nevertheless it is awesome and i thank you again ( :, 
  i think you mean punchcat, 
  when i say preference i mean when peasants say `` lol i prefer 29.98 fps as it makes the game feel like a movie '' and other bullshit . 
  do n't understand the downvotes ... who cares if it has a stupid watermark , it 's still youdontsurf content and it was n't even of 9gag some guy posted it . 
  seriously what the fuck ? 
  it got a stupid 9gag watermark for some reason , does it mean that it 's not youdontsurf content anymore ? 
  as much as i like steam , i will still buy the witcher 2 from gog at 10 $ simply because they provide drm-free digital store and have big faith in the pc community . 
  that is why despite witcher 2 being 5 $ atm at steam , i will still buy it at gog for 10 $ because they went all in for pc gamers and that is awesome . 
  jesus christ relax and have a fucking laugh , so what about the watermark , it is still youdontsurf content, 
  yes i 'm probably missing some part of an important everybody-should-know rule . 
  ** this !, 
  maybe i was n't clear enough , but some people say like `` sometimes i prefer lower fps so i can have better quality . . etc '' this is perfectly fine . 
  what i tried to say is exactly like your analogy , purposely handicapping themselves while and denying that higher = better . 
  yes but you still know that higher = better , peasants deny this . 
  good luck haha , a day ago i also had an exam by the morning but still was redditing at 1 am .
