  damn reddit gim me back my life !, 
  i still have biology and geology ( 2 in 1 ) next wednesday and i 'm also done ( :, 
  * at the job interview *, 
  q : so , what are your abilites ? 
  a : i can do written tests . 
  we have a [ recommended mods ] ( http://reddit.com/r/oblivion/wiki/index/mods ) dedicated for these questions , as they were nuking this sub when it had mods inactive . 
  the 3 buttons from out wiki are underlined , how could you not see them ? 
  okay then , i hope you do n't mind that i 'm just going to remove this thread since people are tired of answering the same stuff over and over . 
  if you have any suggestions to our wiki , please let us know . 
  once you go pc , you never go back . 
  like what ? 
  xbox one has inferior hardware and ca n't even output 1080p . 
  it can not be considered a `` next '' - gen console . 
  pc can have any input device , console restricted to one controler, 
  pretend i 'm a guard and stand around with a torch . 
  fortify speed 100 pts on my horse and travel at the speed of light . 
  watch dogs 792p vs 900p, 
  ac black flag 720p vs 1080p, 
  bf4 720p vs 900p, 
  the xbox does have inferior hardware , only a little bit better apu 1.7 ghz vs 1.6 ghz but gpu matters more . 
  still both consoles are way behind in terms of hardware . 
  no , i do n't use console . 
  i simply have a spell * fortify speed 100 pts on target for 60 seconds *, 
   * no real pvp, 
  okay i pass then , but i like your iniciative . 
  tera 's combat is pretty awesome so i 'm playing that right now . 
  what is weapon mastery ? 
  have n't played dcuo for quite some time . 
  ( still have influence gear and marks of tactics ), 
  i also play the slayer !, 
  the idea of being fairly agile while still carrying a huge sword is awesome . 
  have a sorc lvl 55 but i 'm bored with him , maybe because he'a a human male and human males are boring and the robes are not cool looking imo . 
  that is fucking awesome , too bad i ca n't play since in this game you need to pay to unlock the best weapons and armor . 
  not worth it . 
  you also save money by going pc so ... 
  there are alot of f2p games that rely only on cosmetics and are alive and running great . 
  also i 'm not complaining about it , just saying that because i 'm a 17 year old student and can not afford a subscription at the moment . 
  i have money , but no income . 
  i always just deliver the amulet to jauffre and just never visit kvatch . 
  so i have no gates and can do whatever i want . 
  modding oblivion also in the meaning of trying out random mods . 
  somebody should make a [ mod it until it crashes ] ( http://i.imgur.com/etjue1p.jpg ) but for oblivion . 
  ofcourse it can run games at 1080p but only the ones which are less graphical demanding ( football games or whatever ) . 
  you also play elder scrolls on console ? 
  everyday , thousands of console gamers keep playing tes on their consoles , unaware of the amount of extra content they 're missing . 
  at one point , they hear tales of pc tes , * `` is that even possible ? 
  it must be all lies ! '' * . 
  but some brave souls investigate , and take the *** step *** :, 
  ** enough !, 
  i 'm tired of having an inferior experience , being locked down like a slave , i want freedom !, 
  freedom to add what i want to my game !, 
  freedom to custumize my game to fit my personal needs !, 
  no more slavery , i am free now !, 
  and thus , he builds himself a pc , and never looks back . 
  you may have found the real tes experience , but thousands of others have not . 
  do not let this tragedy continue . 
  point them out to the light and the reward will come to you naturally, 
  [ here 's todd howards saying that pc is the best place to play skyrim ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0mpuiyjkui&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=19m40s ), 
  what 's the logic behind that ? 
  the games just become more demanding over time and the hardware just gets older . 
  if it struggles with 1080p now , then imagine what happens in 3 years . 
  witcher 3 will already push the consoles to their max limits .

  i 've looked it up , but that does n't change that this generation is underpowered and is holding games back in terms of performance . 
  they need to reduce games ' features because of console limitations . 
  this is the problem , consoles are holding gaming back while people just keep buying them no matter what instead of demanding quality products . 
  when you take into account the business strategy of sony and microsoft ( not so much nintendo ) , you 'll find that it 's all just one big greedy systematic ripoff of uneducated consumers . 
  i understand your attitude , but the passive attitude is the reason why it just gets worse . 
  so there has to be somebody to make the move or else it will just keep getting worse . 
  ps : great to have a discussion with a casual ( ? ), 
  gamer that does n't go like * `` omg elitist pc nerd fag gtfo let us enjoy our games '' *, 
  nooo !, 
  that attitude will not get you the real tes experience . 
  this was one of the few mmos i really spent most time in . 
  but i ca n't really afford it now ) :, 
  \u266b i 've created a monster , cause nobody wants to see marshall no more ... \u266b,

  well pc gaming is on the rise mainly because in past five years of surging growth , competition , and innovation in the industry have improved the pc in almost every regard , largely due to the mobile revolution and things like steam , humble bundle , and good old games . 
  more and more people switch to pc because it is becoming much easier to build one and the time where pcs were expensive has long since passed . 
  with the amount of videos , guides that are on the internet , the `` pc is too complicated '' argument is fading away . 
  so what ( i think ) will happen in future is that either sony and microsoft get their shit together or else they will keep loosing costumers . 
  right now it is n't a big deal but in time it will become if consoles keep being underpowered . 
  it was a joke haha , in style of those commercials `` everyday thousands of children die because parents leave them alone at home , do not let this tragedy come to you , keep your children safe as they are our future '' . 
  so this is skyrim-style :, 
  everyday countless of gamers play tes on their consoles , unaware of the colossal amount of content they 're missing , do not let this tragedy continue , build yourself a pc , because the real tes experience is on the pc . 
  * gaming pc is not expensive as shit , why do you think it is expensive ? 
  you can build a computer that outperforms the ps4 for as little as $ 500 if you go simple stuff .
