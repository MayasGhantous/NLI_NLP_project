  * not optimized does not mean unplayable, 
  * i can not believe that you are not capable of installing a program,

  seriously even my grandma can probably do it . 
  i 'm not living in america , so getting a job is harder for young folk .

  so true . 
  i 've never been much into crafting in mmos and stuff but in oblivion , the alchemy is very enjoyable . 
  i like to feeling of being a plant scientist . 
  i have no idea why , is it because we can make potions anywhere ? 
  i find that having specific places to make potions is annoying . 
  because in skyrim i ** never ** crafted a potion and i 've been playing since release ( 11/11/11 ) . 
  i hate leyawiin , because it 's all swampy and messy . 
  bruma is nice because its snowy and i like snow !,

  here 's a mod from our recommended mods wiki page that will interest you . 
  * [ all +5 attributes modifiers ] ( http://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/2691/ ? ), 
  - when you [ level up ] ( http://core-rpg.ru/news/wiredskyrim/oblivion-level-up.jpg ) , the bonus to each attributes depends on how many level ups you did with certain skills . 
  but to have the max amount of bonus ( +5 ) you need to plan your skill usages accordingly . 
  this is called [ efficient leveling ] ( http://www.uesp.net/wiki/oblivion:efficient_leveling ) . 
  but if you 're a person that simply wants to play the game while still getting max bonuses , then this mod is for you . 
  ^ nobody ^ will ^ judge ^ you . 
  i have done this alot and did n't notice anything . 
  i never win anything so ... 
  gibe terraria please hue hue hue hue, 
  `` find me a pc that is more powerful than ps4 for # 400 '' this is the most retarded argument ever . 
  do n't forget that peasant 's cost is pc for school/work + console . 
  while we have a pc that can do both better . 
  so even if we go with # 800 pc we will still save money . 
  cheaper games , free online , win money on games like tf2 dota and csgo etc. . . 
  proven . 
  the nine divines are boring . 
  they 're never boring .

  for steam games just go to your library of games . 
  right click on the game , you should see ` view game cd-key ' as the second option on the dropdown menu . 
  or you can start the game . 
  once the game is running press shift & tab together , it will bring you to a steam menu that should have a tab ` cd-key ' . 
  the 3rd option is to go to look for the ` view ' tab at the top left of your steam library menu . 
  click ` view ' , then ` games details ' . 
  now you can click on your game in the regular library and it should show game info in the right half of the steam application . 
  under the section `` links '' at the far right edge there will be a link for `` cd key '', 
  here is my [ `` battlestation '' ] ( http://i.imgur.com/snepzgr.jpg ), 
  please consider building it yourself . 
  if you have the ability to read or watch a 15 minute youtube video , then you 're more than capable of building it by youself . 
  trust me , you will thank everyone of us after you 've built it by yourself and realized how much more powerful your pc is and how much money you 've saved . 
  also the knowledge gained is great and you 'll be sure that you have quality parts on your rig with good warranty time .
