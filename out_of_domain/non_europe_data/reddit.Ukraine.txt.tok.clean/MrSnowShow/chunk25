  i bough it in winter for 2.74 $ and later it even got lower to 2 $ . 
  do not buy games that only say `` summer sale offer . 
  ends it 30 june '' . 
  unless it 's the last day . 
  you did fixes right ? 
  how can i join a team ? 
  that 's odd . 
  my friend tried a shitload of fixes but the game simply would n't run . 
  borderlans 2, 
  witcher 2, 
  bioshock triple pack, 
  how many parts are there ? 
  because i 'm `` studying '' at the moment ... 
  i do n't know your taste in gaming , but if alot of people play it , then chances are you 're also going to enjoy it . 
  look around for some gameplay and stuff . 
  terraria pls, 
  orion dino horde . 
  thank you kind sir . 
  if you keep going every 30m then in roughly 2 hours u will put the full key . 
  how do you take out a condom ? 
  in your case it is by farting !, 
  haha burn !, 
  you should wait until they go on sale before buying them . 
  totally, 
  how the fuck do i join a team ? 
  properly format your texts so they look nice and easy to read . 
  formatting in reddit is very easy and fast . 
  also good grammar helps too . 
  do n't downvote based on opinion . 
  downvote is not a disagree button . 
  use the search feature before posting any question . 
  i do n't think there are subreddits to avoid , because some people enjoy subs that others do n't . 
  do not be a dick . 
  follow redditiquette . 
  edit : learn the abreviations , `` til '' `` ama '' `` psa '' etc. . . 
  your toilet trips will now be 15 minutes longer than before . 
  yes , unless you 're in a circlejerk sub where the main point is being a jerk around a joke ( example : / r/androidcirclejerk ), 
  i already claimed 3 keys today ... 
  mine was 3840 some hours ago ) :, 
  doesnt matter which one, 
  i remember playing tomb raider as little kid on the ps1 . 
  scared the fuck out of me . 
  i would n't mind if i could have this new tomb raider on my library ( as it is still very small ) . 
  i would be nice of you . 
  thank you and good luck to everybody else . 
  the xbone and ps4 are n't capable of 60 fps without turning down the graphics to very ugly so that is why it 's 30 fps . 
  of course they will say that stuff because it would be embarrasing for `` next '' - gen to have bad performance . 
  also 24 fps on movies because they could n't do more , also added in motion blur ( which video games do n't have ) so it looks smoother . 
  in gaming - higher framerate = better . 
  ( seriously , ** [ nsfw ] ** check out / r/60fpsporn to see what you 've been missing . ), 
  then i might consider buying it once it goes on sale . 
  the goty ofcourse . 
  thank you kind sir . 
  if he is a peasant , then he wastes $ 60 . 
  try through browser ? 
  the cpu combo is not very good , because you have an overclockable cpu with a cheap mobo . 
  you either get a less expensive cpu or if you want to overclock just get a better mobo, 
  ~ ~ cpu : okay ~ ~, 
  ~ ~ mobo : okay ~ ~, 
  memory : unless you 're planning to add another 8gb stick soon , then it 's better to go 2x4gb, 
  storage : it 's okay if you do n't mind seagate 's failure rate, 
  video card : okay, 
  case : personal choice , but there are cheaper cases . 
  su : never heard about enermax , what you guys think ? 
  xfx , seagate , corsair are good brands . 
  login logout ? 
  login logout out of steam ? 
  restart steam client ? 
  peasants think that console = wine , it gets better with time . 
  damn that kde ... 
  have alot of new games ... 
  ca n't play them because only 2 gb of hdd space left . 
  just an answer to `` stated that they purposely locked their game at 30 frames per second to achieve that `` filmic look '' . '', 
  oooh , right i 'm a retard for not seeing cinnamon haha my bad . 
  my dad actually uses no de , only openbox . 
  he 's also not tech-savy but what he only does is browse the web so openbox is the best option . 
  is n't it amazing how linux manages to adapt to everyone 's personal needs ? 
  while totally understanding the reason behind pirating the game , we do not allow posts directly asking where to pirate games . 
  there are plenty of other places where you can find this information , but / r/oblivion is n't one of them . 
  thank you and have a nice day . 
  but according to gaben , linux is the future of gaming . 
  if this is true , atleast my kids wo n't be experiencing windows gaming . 
  yeah , microsoft 's directx is the thing stopping the linux take on games , as most aaa games use that library . 
  we just have to wait ... for some glorious change , maybe a new revolutionized opengl massively better than directx , or hope for people to start hating windows more and more so linux gets more populated ... 
  they also forget how they spend money on a pc for work/school . 
  so this totally invalidates their `` pc gaming is expensive '' argument as they waste 400 $ on console + 400 $ for a shitty ( probably prebuilt ) pc . 
  and that is with ** no games ** . 
  add in the expensive games + online subscriptions and you have already spent 1000 $ . 
  while with pc , you go with a budget build for around $ 600 ( or even less if you want ) . 
  buy ridiculously cheap games , do n't pay for online and maybe even ** win money by playing games such as dota 2 , tf2 and csgo . 
  so if you even go with a 1000 $ badass build you 'll still save money around the 1-2 months compared to consoles while getting a much better experience . 
  i think you misspelled football . 
  ( bracing for america 's downvote train , as it 's 1-2 am here in europe people are gettin ' ready for monday ) . 
  hmmm , but we 're facing the company led by the richest man on the planet ... 
  nsfw dude, 
  here 's how to fix it :, 
  delete it from your computer, 
  buy xbone, 
  buy the game, 
  buy texture packs,
