  buy skins, 
  enjoy minecraft how it was intended you stupid game-ruining fuck . 
  what guy from twitter ? 
  best decision gaben did in his lifetime haha . 
  i think the problem is that he 's the only real dev , his wife only does art . 
  with the money he has , he could get a fucking team and speed up the process ... 
  but seriously , if you look at the version history you will see almost everyday updates and then suddenly shortly after the game gets released ** boom !, 
  ** no updates for fucking 11 months exactly at this moment ... 
  the game sure is fun ( even at this 0.1.1 alpha which is surprisingly amazing ) . 
  but the way that wollay treats the community is terrible . 
  this game has the potential to be a huge minecraft rival . 
  ( edit : in terms of popularity ), 
  and since his wife is only doing art , it 's then just a one man team about all the technical stuff . 
  that 's fucking awesome , i always dreamt as a kid to have my own tools . 
  i 'm on phone at the moment so i ca n't look . 
  but is your program written in c++ ? 
  also i did a bit of programming some years ago as a kid on windows , how you test your programms ? 
  because i remember that the finished products were . exe files . 
  i do n't get it : /, 
  i 'm not comparing gameplay-wise . 
  i 'm just saying it can reach minecraft 's popularity . 
  when i compare this game minecraft , i 'm talking about popularity . 
  any recommended program ? 
  i used dev-cpp back then . 
  wow i did n't know you could use a text editor for the code and just use a compiler , that 's very minimalistic hacker-like style , which is awesome . 
  i though you needed a specific program . 
  eh , random icons around . 
  nothing special ... 
  3 days for ~ ~ mate ~ ~ cinnamon + conky ? 
  nixers are the best . 
  where are the i3 , bspwm , 2bwm . . etc desktops ? 
  the taskbar is ugly : c, 
  default # !, 
  's conky is not very sexy . 
  he left it because he wanted to work with other games . 
  it was his game so if he did n't like something then he could change it but he did n't . 
  how do you launch programms with i3 ? 
  i 'm new on linux , i use openbox and everything i need is on the rightclick menu . 
  does i3 also have rightlick menu ? 
  or you just type in the name of program in terminal ? 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ once ^ ^ ^ ^ you ^ ^ ^ ^ go ^ ^ ^ ^ kb + mouse ^ ^ ^ ^ you ^ ^ ^ ^ never ^ ^ ^ ^ go ^ ^ ^ ^ back . 
  are you serious ? 
  but does n't it affect controller too ? 
  haha , the only pants that i found that were more vampire-like in the vanilla game . 
  personally , ever since the minecraft beta 1.8 adventure update , i could n't play more . 
  i think with the biomes and how they removed the bright green grass + the health bar killed it for me . 
  it just stopped there for me for some reason . 
  it is such a shame because i really like the game . 
  i have n't even enchanted an item yet , and everything that was added after the enchanting i did n't try it too . 
  also , could i also add a keybind to open a specific directory where i have all of my games or school projects ? 
  wow ... 
  i 'm sorry but i ca n't help you with how to setup a controller because i 've never used one . 
  are you on an american or european edition ? 
  ** edit **, 
  if you 're on the american edition , then sadly there is no way to cure . 
  but if you 're on the european edition , if you change your system language to german , the witch will then accept the bloodgrass . 
  you can then save and change the system language back to your desired tongue and that 's it .

  busy with school and programming ? 
  so you 're in school while working as a programmer or just do it for fun self-learning ? 
  oh and last question , how do i control things like wifi connections , volume and battery ? 
  ( if on laptop ), 
  i do not want it , but thanks for doing this anyway . 
  there is a fallout 3 goty deal too . 
  hello dmz_dragon , in your more recent posts you stated that the i3-4130 beats fx-6300 . 
  so he should go with the i3 ? 
  all self learning ? 
  that 's awesome , i also tried some years ago , made a simple console program in c++ but now i forgot everything . 
  how did you learn ? 
  what languages ? 
  today is blue 's day . 
  should have gotten the goty instead . 
  are you a wizard ? 
  what were your goals as a starting programmer , because currently i have no idea what i want to code , so i 'm kind off lost without a direction ... 
  it includes all dlc , and one of them increases the level cap and lets you continue playing after finishing main quest . 
  `` diary '', 
  can you give some examples of casual programs ? 
  walk always in the shadow of sithis , dearest brother . 
  never buy an ubisoft game ever again until they change this shit . 
  you still play it ? 
  there are plenty of servers online . 
  the game from my fucking childhood . 
  i do n't play much singleplayer , i started with jk3 mp and alot of years later tried jk2 mp but not very interesting . 
  and by boredom later went into the sp , the jk3 was easy , but in jk2 i got lost every 5 minutes ... so annoying . 
  i 'm also surprised that the main servers are still running . 
  deus ex human revolution and fallout new vegas, 
  i hate these kids that play adult games . 
  but most of us here are hypocrites . 
  i 've been playing gta vc and gta sa since i was 8-9 years old ... 
  hahah i 'm not very fluent in des since i do n't use them . 
  but that conky color is n't the best and could use more prettyness . 
  payday the heist, 
  thank you and have a nice day, 
  i have a similar story, 
  2000-2004 nintendo 64 just like you, 
  2004-2010 hybrid ps2 and pc pentium 4 without a dedicaded gpu, 
  2010-until now still using the radeon hd 5650 laptop with an unecessary i7 1.6 ghz, 
  i play multiplayer , but when i 'm bored i might also try that one . 
  thanks ( :, 
  eh , it was the first thing that came to my mind when i saw it .
