  are there servers running this mod ? 
  here are the specs from that `` gaming pc '' from ibuypower :, 
  amd a10-6800k quad-core apu, 
  8gb ddr3-1866 high performance memory, 
  amd radeon r7 260x 2gb, 
  2tb 7200rpm sata-iii 6gb/s hard drive, 
  lg slim slot load blu-ray reader, 
  windows 8.1 + office 365 trial, 
  keyboard and mouse is n't as scary as console users think it is . 
  it should n't take long to figure it out and once you 're fine with it , you will be more than grateful that you took the time to get used to the keyboard + mouse . 
  so yeah , just go to keyboard and mouse , it 's worth it . 
  also another myth is that you need to buy that high-end kbs and mouses . 
  i 'm curretly gaming in a shitty laptop keyboard + some cheap logitech usb mouse , and i 'm perfectly fine with it . 
  all the high-end kbs and mouses are just luxury , you can game on cheap kb + mouse with no problems whatsoever . 
  * i would switch the seagate barracuda to western digital caviar blue 1 tb . 
  they 're the same price but generally western digital is more reliable . 
  * if you 're not planning on adding another 8 gb stick , it 's better to go 2x4gb . 
  * i 'm not sure about this one , but i would rather go with a better gpu and a little bit worse cpu/mobo . 
  * do you really need wireless mouse ? 
  wired is more reliable . 
  * bigger psu for later upgrades . 
  do not buy games that say only `` summer sale !, 
  offer ends 30 june '' . 
  just wait until they go on flash , daily or community . 
  if they do n't go on any of those , then just buy on the last day of sale . 
  please read our [ wiki ] ( http://reddit.com/r/oblivion/wiki/index ), 
  it was made for new players , such as yourself , to not keep posting the same questions over and over and not turning this sub into a / r/oblivionheyguyzwatmodsshouldigetimnewtothisgame, 
  we have 3 buttons over there , one of them clearly says `` recommended mods '' , how did you miss that one ? 
  not trying to be rude or anything , but please read the sidebar atleast before posting stuff . 
  should have posted this as a comment . 
  should add those to the wiki . 
  custom class is always the best class . 
  that 's awesome . 
  still on the `` cpu '' department there 's only apus to choose from . 
  only thing that i disagree is with asus r9 290 . 
  ( correct me if i 'm wrong ), 
  asus cooler on r9 290 has a bad design so it 's less effective . 
  sapphire tri-x is cheaper but comes in 850mhz but you can oc it easly . 
  reddit is fun has a sidebar . 
  there 's a little icon near the sub 's name to show it and also to message mods . 
  i do n't know if you know the history of this sub , but basically for a long period of time it had inactive mods and 80 % of posts were people asking what were the best mods . 
  recently it was reclaimed and users suggested a [ wiki ] ( http://reddit.com/r/oblivion/wiki/index ) so that players that want mods have a nice list instead of making a new posts that was already made 2 days ago with the same intentions . 
  i 'm gon na have to disagree with you but the `` hey just installed oblivion , what are the recommended mods ? '', 
  are not exactly `` mod discussion '' as you said , in those posts users will almost always ( those who still have patience ) repeat themselves over and over . 
  the typical answers are : `` install ooo , ocov2 , qarls texture pack , weather all natural , deadly reflex and dont forget to use wrye bash or omm '' rinse and repeat every 2 days . 
  is that really mod * discussion * ? 
  i 'm sorry if i have offended you in anyway , it was n't intentional . 
  i just want people to know that there 's a wiki for these types of posts . 
  thank you and have a nice day . 
  is that on asus ? 
  should have crouched . 
  yes , probably the first comment was a bit `` unwelcoming '' . 
  but what i really meant is that we have a wiki to help people who look for mods have an easier time rather than posting the same question that was posted 2 days ago . 
  it 's pretty bare bones because only recently this sub was reclaimed so we did n't had much time to develop a longer list . 
  this also requires more contributors because only 3 people can not make a huge good mod list , for example , i do n't use much overhauls and stuff , so i can mostly contribue is with the `` utilites , minor changes '' section which are the mods that i mostly use . 
  so for a bigger list we need more people who experienced mods that others did n't . 
  oblivion sure had a big modding community , but skyrim already surpassed it as you can see [ here ] ( http://www.nexusmods.com/games/ ? ) . 
  also back then there were no yt channels like brodual , dedicaded to showcasing a bunch of mods . 
  there a newer videos about oblivion , but what they mention is pretty much what is already in the [ wiki ] ( http://reddit.com/r/oblivion/wiki/index ) . 
  so to summarize ( in my opinion ) these are the reasons :, 
  the wiki was added recently and it is a work-in-progress . 
  lists such as gems get contribution by alot of people which leads to to the next point . 
  it is easier to find resources for skyrim mods , as the amout of internet users and consequentially videos on yt and also more people play skyrim . 
  ps : do you think the 3 buttons are really that hidden ? 
  even when you go to submit something they are still there , do you have any suggestions for some other place where they can be ? 
  i 'm pretty sure bandits are still carrying some pieces around , so go on some bandit-killing adventure and you should find it . 
  ( even me as level 49 , if my memory is correct , i think i saw mithril bandits still . ), 
  also there probably are shops selling those too . 
  i appreciate your input , but by reading your other replies , i have a few points to adress :, 
  our goal here is to create a good page that we can redirect people to when they 're looking for mods , but in order for it to be accurate/complete/etc , we need contribution from different people with different mod experiences so we can have a more extended good mod list . 
  you stated that you liked to help , i for example do not use managers and install all my mods manually . 
  but since you have experience with those , it would be a nice addition but as / u/arrythmia said , you refused to be a mod and consequentialy actively helping creating guidelines for oblivion . 
  the modding tutorial is a work-in-progress , so obviously it will be changed as people give feedback and point out what needs to be added/removed/changed . 
  this sub for a long time had inactive mods , and / r/oblivion was full with people asking the same questions everyday and answerers just kept repeating themselves over and over , do n't get me wrong i also like helping new people , i was answering questions alot when i started using reddit but it got tiresome because people would just repeat themselves over and over for weeks , so it was my `` dream '' of being a mod in a sub about the game from my top 5 personal favorites and create nice help pages so users could have the answers right there and the content had more discussions rather than the same mod recommendations and troubleshooting , so this was the reason why the wiki was created . 
  there are still plenty of questions in this sub but they are always different , and i keep track of the questions and keep adding the worthy ones to the faq . 
  thank you and have a nice day . 
  wow , i really love the music from oblivion . 
  made the game really feel like a fantasy world . 
  [ powdered deer penis ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58zlnivhym0 ), 
  i do not know about enchantments . 
  but with spells i had to make a weakness to all 3 elements spell , and then a only damage spell . 
  because if you put them both in one spell , the weakness doens ' t work . 
  this is the real deal !, 
  i love some / r/wmporn, 
  and i though borderlands 2 dlc was excessive ... 
  i 'm a brother that owns [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/snepzgr.jpg ) ( i7 1.6 ghz 1 ^ st gen , hd 5650m ) and i have gaben 's blessing for sure . 
  not saying it is bad , just a ridiculous long list . 
  and even the goty edition misses some stuff . 
  no no no , you go expensive every part except what really matters which is the gpu . 
  but others already pointed out much better builds for the same money . 
  hahahahaha when i first read it i was like wtf is that spelling but then after reading sidebar i understood : / r/buildanapc, 
  this may sound incredibly retarded but i laughed alot on this . 
  build a fucking apc ... are you serious ? 
  i guess he never saw / r/60fpsporn, 
  edit : ** nsfw **, 
  i did n't play much , but i loved the vampire class from forsaken world . 
  doge has some unknown magical brainfucking properties . 
  seriously , the first time i saw the picture of the doge i was like `` wow '' and my brain was there processing what i was seeing . 
  and everytime i look at the picture and he 's like staring into my soul and i 'm still like `` wow , what the fuck , so majestic ... '', 
  chrome is n , firefox is p.
