  ctrl + shift + ** p ** or ** n **, 
  it 's okay it happens , i 'm not here for ** read the fucking sidebar you fkin idiot blind piece of motherfucking shit ** because that 's just no way to treat users . 
  anyway , any thoughts about the list ? 
  ctrl + p is print, 
  ctrl + shift + p is private, 
  i like to have 24 % on exams because it has that failing feeling . 
  i have now ocov2 installed so he is different now, 
  operation etw or whaever failed . 
  may your, 
  * fps be high, 
  * ping be low, 
  * resolution be high, 
  * loading screen time be low,

  console peasantry :, 
  where you think you 're spending less money , but the online subscriptions and expensive games will make you waste more money in a matter of months as compared to pc while still getting an incredibly crippeled down experience . 
  i do n't have much experience , but i 've tried only ltd. 
  i really liked it , but the problem was that if i recall correctly , i could n't feed without doing damage . 
  that was the only reason i stopped using it because i did n't want to murder random npcs . 
  but the rest of features that you get are all very nice . 
  / r/skyrimporn worthy, 
  have n't played league since end of season 3 where i reached my goal of getting gold . 
  as a main vayne , this video * almost * made me want to play league again haha . 
  wow , the enchantment restore over time is awesome !, 
  downloading right away . 
  ( i 'm a particular fan of these type of mods ), 
  thank you for sharing this one , it will be added to wiki for sure as well as other mods that people have mentioned here . 
  that 's exactly the reason why i stopped using it . 
  but is such a shame because the mod is really awesome imo . 
  what os did you us ? 
  is it unix-based, 
  can somebody explain why use a different hud , what 's wrong with the default one ? 
  ( 24h in tf2 ), 
  what 's the trolldier ? 
  ca n't recall the name at the moment , but i love the one from db where you kill valen dreth . 
  modded is always better , even if you do n't add any new stuff . 
  the bug fixes and gameplay ajustments are too good to pass . 
  this uniqueness in quests is one of the things that keep oblivion on the top of my personal favorites . 
  i 'm really hoping for a co-op on the next tes with maybe 2 or 3 people max . 
  i do n't know if it would work but it 's sure better than a mmo ... 
  it would be a good idea to sticky this , it 's time for a new one . 
  i made a mod called [ sun damage change ] ( http://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/45002/ ? ), 
  that reduces the sun damage to 0 when your vampirism is 50 % and 75 % and only has damage at 100 % . 
  another person 's [ mod ] ( http://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/31018/ ? ), 
  just removes it , but by reducing to zero instead it is kept the screen blurring/distortion effects that i think are pretty cool . 
  oooh i remember now , it was a quest yeah !, 
  thanks , in my playthrough i have n't done the fighters guild yet but i 'm going to do it now to meet this cat haha . 
  and i also like how in oblivion i feel that i 'm in a fantasy world . 
  the music , atmosphere are all fantasy-like and makes me always wonder what some magical unexpected stuff will happen in my travels . 
  hah one of the first videos of skyrim , got released like 2 weeks after game release . 
  some dragonborns here need some / r/teslore . 
  what kind of computer is that ? 
  i like [ this one ] ( http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/24342/ ? ), 
  first person for pretty much everything , i only use third person to look at my badass char . 
  that gpu is n't even a gaming-oriented one . 
  * get better weapons and arrows, 
  * enchant them, 
  * use sneak atacks, 
  dwarwen weapons can be found as loot after level 6 . 
  also if you still have that problem , maybe try downloading a mod that reduces everyone 's health ( including yours ) but buffs damage , so combat is alot shorter and more dangerous . 
  you know what ? 
  bitch got what she deserves . 
  she 's racist and all full of herself , i hate that damn woman . 
  i do n't know if they appear in stores , i just know that vendors start to have them after level 10 . 
  and portuguese, 
  as someone who made a mod with 1 endorsment , i thank you for the credit haha . 
  it is n't even for skyrim , it 's for oblivion . 
  i 'm embarrassed to [ advertise it ] ( http://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/45002/ ? ), 
  1st row : it 's not skyrim , it 's the empire symbol that has been around forever ... 
  if it 's worth that much then why not sell it and build a proper gaming rig ? 
  that 's awesome , glad i helped other people out . 
  thanks for pointing that out , i 'll go fix it right now . 
  but from what i heard you should use either omm or wrye bash . 
  nmm is not very good for oblivion . 
  ( need confirmation here , because i install all mods manually ), 
  why the wiki is gone ? 
  r9 290 for 350 $ vs 780 for 500 $ and they have around the same performance ( check the benchmarks ), 
  glorious red team !, 
  i do not hate nvidia , because they do make quality products . 
  i just do n't agree with their pricing , same goes for intel in the cpu department . 
  if not for amd , then we would be paying way more for gpus and cpus . 
  i remember when the r9 290 came out , it costed $ 399 while the 780 was around $ 700 and r9 290 had around ** the same ** performance . 
  so yeah that made nvidia drop the price obviously . 
  obviously the reference cooler is hot , but do not get the reference cards . 
  [ here 's a video of overclocking the sapphire tri-x with temperatures and stuff ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcby9em_jlm ), 
  just play all three . 
  also just a formatting tip so it 's easier to read . 
  use ` [ dark brotherhood chronicles ] ( http://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/41090/ ? 
  ) ` to make it appear like [ dark brotherhood chronicles ] ( http://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/41090/ ? ), 
  you can use a video card with any cpu , there is no such thing as `` not compatible with * this * cpu '' . 
  you just do n't want to use older/less powerful cpus with high-end cards because they ( cpus ) will bottleneck the performance of the video card . 
  so if you buy yourself a fancy gtx 780 ti ( $ 700 ) and have an amd athlon ii x4 ( $ 80 ) you will loose over half of the performance that the 780 ti offers . 
  absolutely . 
  r9 290x sits at $ 500 at the moment while you can get a r9 290 for as little as $ 360 . 
  the price gap is just too big to go 290x . 
  i 'm not a big fan of sli/crossfire so i ca n't advice in that . 
  are you not happy with your current 760 ? 
  it 's still a reliable card . 
  generally nvidia offers,
