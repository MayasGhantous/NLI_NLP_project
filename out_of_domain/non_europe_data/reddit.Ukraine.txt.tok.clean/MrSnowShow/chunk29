  * lower wattage, 
  * better ocing, 
  * lower temperatures, 
  * physx and other nvidia stuff in games . 
  * better drivers, 
  * better software ( geforce experience , shadowplay , etc ), 
  also under the text box where you type in stuff , there is a button `` formatting help '' which lists formatting codes that you can use to make your text prettier/easier to read . 
  in my opinion this is n't really a `` completing zones '' game such as kingdoms of amalur for example , the world is open and you just explore it anywhere you like . 
  but you can just go to one city and look for quests there , but some might require you to travel to other cities and such . 
  talk to npcs ask for rumors , go to inns and talk to people . 
  i think it 's cooler to first develop your character and only then go for the main quest . 
  it is n't very cool to finish the main quest at level 3 . 
  you get food , place to sleep , quests with rewards , reputation . 
  also trainers . 
  ebony armor only starts to appear after level 16 ** i think ** . 
  but you can go kill umbra if you want ebony armor earlier .

  no , i do n't there 's any performance advantage by going full amd . 
  one common behavior i see among pc gamers is the `` lust for performance '' . 
  there are joke-memes for this like `` i want to upgrade , but all my games run at max settings already '' . 
  the upgrading choice is personal . 
  if i was in your place , i would n't upgrade yet because 760 is a pretty decent card at the moment and it is better than the potatoes ' gpu . 
  but that 's me , if you have loads of money then it would be no problem for you . 
  i do not know your budget/income , but for me 4k is a bit pricey and only 30 hz so i would just wait some months until the prices start go down . 
  meanwhile the cards price will also keep dropping . 
  it 's basically pc vs consoles again . 
  windows - consoles, 
  linux - pc, 
  the reasons why you prefer pc among of them is freedom and costumization . 
  which is what linux offers and windows do n't . 
  people keep saying that this is the true linus . 
  i agree but linustechtips is also a great guy . 
  and should not be shunned down only because his name being the same as torvalds ' . 
  so it 's like naive right ? 
  that 's good . 
  in the tech world `` few months '' do make a difference . 
  god no !, 
  how to make windows borderless ? 
  this is sexy as fuck . 
  i 'm looking forward to deleting my windows partition and just dedicate my time to tweaking my linux install . 
  ofcourse they change with generation , but i said generally . 
  what taskbar is that ? 
  numix is ubuntu 's one right ? 
  is it fixed where players do missions and everyone advances a bunch of levels ? 
  it ruined my first char so ... 
  i was asking how to make windows borderless so i could have too . 
  why hamachi ? 
  yeah it 's my style . 
  i do n't like fancy shit , just plain performance . 
  so how the cards are at the moment ? 
  let 's consider the from 760 to 780 ti and r9 270 to r9 290x, 
  but not to the same point . 
  but basically linux is like a self made garage car capable of great speeds while windows is a normal racing car . 
  when i said freedom i really ment costumization , not amout of programs i can use . 
  ** i think ** the 780 should be maxing out every game at 1080p while still being playable . 
  that 's a very good deal . 
  amd drivers no longer shit ? 
  that 's awesome . 
  also about oc , i always saw that nvidia cards could get more performance out of overclocking than amd cards . 
  link ? 
  thank you , that worked !, 
  but how do i move the windows around ? 
  i use super + arrow keys but they become tiled so for example i ca n't have a little window on center . 
  that 's the reference card , which is bad . 
  what about [ this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=garojjgth0c ), 
  portugal, 
  yes but no one should buy reference amd cards . 
  just a tiny note , there 's no need for the 3 zeros . 
  so it can be, 
  player.additem ca12a 1, 
  no it 's because they 're hot as hell . 
  yes exactly !, 
  thanks, 
  how to remove window borders in i3 ? 
  or add a simple line border like yours on the clean screenshot, 
  what irc program ? 
  also , do you know what happened to / r/wmporn ? 
  you have an error in your i3 config file !, 
  ohh , the new rules sorta make it more like wmporn, 
  i3 config file v4, 
  i remember seeing that watch_dogs on ultra at 1080p was with avg . 
  fps of 68 with the 780 and newest drivers so it should be okay . 
  i have version 4.2 , but how do i upgrade ? 
  it 's because i just installed it yesterday it should have the latest version . 
  i 'm running crunchbang . 
  oh nice , but later i 'll just switch to arch and it has the latest versions right ? 
  you have the latest version on your debian right ? 
  am i the only dark fellow here that likes to live in the vile lair ? 
  the gray fox *, 
  just play the thieves guild questline to have you questions answered . 
  i was thinking about this the other day , seriously are all my friends retarded for clicking and sharing on that shit ? 
  any idea of how to install that on debian ? 
  no , it 's about the font . 
  it comes with a bunch of files and i do n't think that just placing them on . fonts will work . 
  i like the color scheme , red the dude and blue the grandma . 
  and when they rap together it becomes red + blue = purple, 
   p.s. 
  this subreddit has a very obnoxious style . 
  could you elaborate on this please ?
