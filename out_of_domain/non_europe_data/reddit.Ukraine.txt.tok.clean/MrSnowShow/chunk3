  my laptop from 2010 is i7 1.6 ghz and ati hd 5650m but cant get 60 fps on ps2 emulator, 
  anything involving the dark brotherhood , i love victim 's reactions and lucien lachance, 
  this is like the 10th time i say this :, 
  ** fps is not a preference **, 
  how that quote connects with skyrim ? 
  it 's because they messed up value of items in skyrim alot . 
  take for example ** savior 's hide ** , a daedric artifact by hircine, 
  * in morrowind the item is worth 150000 gold and you can not sell it for full because no merchant has so much gold . 
  * in oblivion it has already dropped to 6250 gold which is totally stupid even tho no merchant ca n't buy it for full price it was still stupid that a daedric artifact is only worth 6250, 
  * in skyrim it dropped to ** 2679 ** gold !, 
  an item that was given by an evil `` god '' is worth ** 2679 ** gold !, 
  the fence * tonilia * when you upgrade thieves guild has 4000 gold . 
  wtf is this shit ? 
  2679 gold for an item from a daedra lord ? 
  oooooooooooohhhhhhhhhhh i see now, 
  well , i was 15 and she was 16 . 
  we could n't do it in my house because parents are almost always at home . 
  her house was like 4 kilometers away and no parents to bother us . 
  the day earlier i did my first shave because i could n't have a jungle on my lucky day . 
  so we journey to her place and things get * hot * on the bed , i start to put my hand under her panties and thinking of finding a nice teen shaved lil pussy but as i get my hand lower and lower , i touch a fucking amazon forest !, 
  holy shit man i got scared and pulled my hand of ( oh god ) but decided to ignore it and after 1-2 hours we decide to do it . 
  i take the condom off and try to put it , my dick falls !, 
  omfg why ?? 
  i get boners all the time by being a teen and now when there 's a naked girl with huge tits besides me i go flat ... 
  so basically i waste a condom and we leave her house . 
  the next day it 's the same , but this day i put on the condom ( because i trained in my house ) and i get to action and as soon as i put it in her i think * oh my god i just lost my virginity * . 
  not gon na lie - it lasted for 1-2 minutes until i came ... after some minutes we decided to do it again , i was hoping for it to last more and it lasted also for only 1-2 minutes and we had to leave . 
  then i went on vacation and when i came back we never did it again and we broke up . 
  this was 1,5 years ago and now i 'm scared to fuck another chick because i do n't want it to be a failure like my 1st time : /, 
  i do n't have any problem with erection i think i was just so nervous that it happened,

  the `` 1 '' means when you press 1 it will switch to/use that thing that is binded to 1, 
  you should have played oblivion 's dark brotherhood quest line . 
  the image that you get from the db in skyrim is just horrible, 
  upgrading the thieves guild is doing the jobs that vex and delvin offer , after you do 5 in markarth solitude windhelm and whiterun you will get a special job in that city and after you do it that city will support the thieves guild and the ragged flagon will be upgraded and tonilia will have more gold . 
  only when u do 5 jobs in each city and the special jobs and complete the quest line you get the quest to become guildmaster, 
  am i the only one that never really got into cs : go ? 
  paarthy < 3 . 
  delphine can go fuck herself i ai n't killing paarthy . 
  * what is better ? 
  to be born good or to overcome your evil nature through great effort ? 
  for me it 's the opposite . 
  i remember when skyrim was released i avoided picking any nirnroot because i did n't want a quest flooding my quest log like in oblivion . 
  then later i found a crimson nirnroot * oooh what is this ? 
  * pick it up and then * a new quest has started * fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu !, 
  sexy, 
  the same happens with lucien lachance when you kill rufio :, 
  * kills rufio when he 's sleeping and sleep in his bed, 
  * lucien lachance comes and says `` rufio is dead ... how de we know this ? 
  you will find that the dark brothe ... '', 
  bitch pls he 's right next to us, 
  being only child causes this behavior ? 
  cuz im also only child, 
  wow much balls you have sir, 
  * there is no such this as stupid questions , there are stupid people that ask questions . 
  i really like amd , but is n't r9 290x worse than gtx 780 ti for about the same price ? 
  and the r9 290x is n't hot and loud as hell ? 
  if its 200 then its okay . 
  but if its a diference of 50 i would go for for nvidia, 
  you will surely make more than one character because you will understand more and more so just explore and enjoy this great game, 
  * faction quests especially mages guild and db are much better with a rich storyline and longer than skyrim . 
  oh and the arena and the hilarious guy that is in charge there, 
  * quests in general are much more interesting than skyrim 's and alot start unexpectingly and have fun twists , you will almost never get bored of a quest in oblivion, 
  * shivering isles is an amazing expansion and maybe one of the best in gaming history, 
  * in oblivion you get more recognition and npcs greet you acordingly when you acomplish something so you actually feel that you shape the world around you . 
  in skyrim you can be the thieves guild master and vekel goes like * so you 're brynjolf new prote ... * it breaks immersion, 
  * in oblivion there is more variety in races you see alot more beast races , in skyrim i felt that 90 % were human-like npcs . 
  * alchemy is more straight forward than in skyrim , you carry around 4 alchemic apparel and you can make something at any time and you do n't need to eat ingredients , your alchemy level modifies what effects you can see . 
  * enchanting does n't have a skill that is painful to level up . 
  and also there are not so much restrictions on what effect you can put on different armor parts . 
  * you do n't need to unequip your weapon to cast spells , making chars like magic archers work easily, 
  * you can make your own spells , skyrim had few spells but oblivion has alot of them but also alot are unecessary like ** drain skill : mercantile **, 
  * you have a ** water walking ** spell/enchantment xd, 
  * one of downsides to oblivion is that since it is an old game the mechanics are not as good as skyrim 's , example : no dagger sneak atack , not so nice crime and bounty system , worse leveling system ... but most of this stuff is fixed with mods anyway, 
  oblivion is a great game and i hope you enjoy it as much as i do since 2007 < 3, 
  : do n't get me wrong i love skyrim i play it since it 's release at 11/11/11 but oblivion got it right in terms of quests and integrating you into the world . 
  they 're drowning in money why would they do that ? 
  i do n't get it :(, 
  it was back in the early days before it got patched . . ahh memories, 
  i love the one when you enter the abandoned house and molag bal says :, 
  * weak , he 's weak , you 're strong , crush him *, 
  it 's because most `` console ads '' are actually footage from pc, 
  [ from why pc ? 
  in oblivion you do n't need to unequip your bow to cast spells , so arcane archer is a pretty smooth gameplay . 
  this is what i said to a guy like you that started to play oblivion :, 
  you will surely make more than one character because you will understand more and more so just explore and enjoy this great game, 
  * faction quests especially mages guild and db are much better with a rich storyline and longer than skyrim . 
  oh and the arena and the hilarious guy that is in charge there,
