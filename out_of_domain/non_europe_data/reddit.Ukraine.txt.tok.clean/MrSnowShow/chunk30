  have n't really went into costumizing because for debian there 's only version 4.2 and the code that i found do not work . 
  is that ` tty-clock ` ? 
  because i have it but it is n't centered and is also showing the date . 
  and there 's no ` man ` for it . 
  we 're survivors , we live in a land many consider alien and unhospitable , a vulcano exploded in our land yet still here we are survivin ' and thrivin ', 
  i like to chill near roxey inn . 
  ( north of imperial city ), 
  also in any colorful forest-like place . 
  aciv black flag is 1080p in the ps4 . 
  [ nsfw ] ( #s ), 
  oh right , i misread there . 
  til to write empty comments . 
  not a real fan of kde , default is very windows-like . 
  sorry for newb question , but how do i install it ? 
  it has only the source code . 
  no de is where it 's at for me . 
  your [ background ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ei0rtfq.jpg ) on the top has a descontinuation or whatever because of your bar . 
  any original link ? 
  ^ not ^ english ^ native, 
   moped the fuck out, 
  is this a good or a bad thing ? 
  what is the problem ? 
  it 's sort of minimal and straight to the point with no fancy stuff . 
  about the alchemy and enchanting part , my first tes game was oblivion and i did both alchemy and enchanting . 
  in skyrim i have n't touched both and i 've been playing since release ( 11/11/11 ) . 
  in oblivion both are simplier and ( imo ) more enjoyable to do . 
  * ** alchemy ** - the main difference between oblivion and skyrim is that in oblivion you can carry 4 alchemy apparel with you ( each of them increases potion 's power , some increase power of negative effects and other positive ) , and to craft a potion you just need to go into your inventory and right click any of the apparel , this means you can craft potions anywhere . 
  also you do not need to eat the ingredients to reveal their effects , your skill level depends on how many effects you can see . 
  * ** enchanting ** - the main difference is that there is ** no enchanting skill ** . 
  also you do not need to disenchant items to learn effects . 
  here are detailed [ alchemy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzhck9nfuvk ) and [ enchanting ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrgicl9aspe ) videos so you can learn more . 
  after playing with vanilla vampires and if you think it 's bad , then install some mods . 
  but only after playing vanilla for some time . 
  yay , time to go by foot all the way to weynor prior . 
  ** this is the part where you fall down and bleeeeeeeeeed to death ** makes me cringe everytime haha . 
  after completing the quest , he told me that he has a key to a chest where he stores his savings . 
  i pickpocked the key and steal it . 
  all i can do is remove the windows logo . 
  i need to find a place where i can buy a super key . 
  my problem with ubuntu is that it has a huge amount of people so they 're starting to act more like proprietary software and are deviating from what ( imo ) should linux be . 
  ads on unity , are you fucking serious ? 
  explanation on why 0x800 ? 
  it 's hex right ? 
  still makes me sad . 
  the arch way is much better . 
  aww that 's bad ... 
  i can not imagine myself playing vanilla vampire . 
  terminal is where it 's at . 
  but the beauty of linux is that is manages to please every type of user . 
  what the flying fuck , for years i 've been rightclicking  open in new tab . 
  game of thrones, 
  what exactly do i write at / etc/apt/sources . list ? 
  why exactly ncurses ? 
  all-time # 1 poster, 
  biggest number of karma ? 
  or something else ? 
  neither do i and i 'm european . 
  why not pcpartpicker list ? 
  800 w is an overkill if from a reputable brand . 
  with that you can run newer cards in sli/crossfirex, 
  ~ ~ 16 and 21 . 
  she was a teacher but not in school and university student too . ~ ~, 
  just noticed it says sex . 
  that 's also me . 
  but i still feel that i 'm a failure with chicks , alot of people tell me `` dude that chick totally digs you '' but i do n't believe/feel that it 's true and they look uninterested when near me . 
  any linux distro . 
  but seriously just use your head and there will be no viruses . 
  this is a typical behavior :, 
  \\  downloads freemovies.exe, 
  \\  ignores warning that it 's dangerous to open random, 
  . exes from the internet and opens it, 
  \\  pc becomes slow, 
  \\  search for antivirus, 
  \\  finds 24/7 pro pc guard, 
  \\  popup says that pc has 420 viruses, 
  \\  pc becomes slow as fuck, 
  \\  complain that pcs only get viruses, 
  damn on phone now ca n't go look around . 
  but check the benchmarks with cards like 660 ti , 750 ti , ( 760 is a bit over $ 200 ) r9 270/270x , 7850 7870 , ( r7 260x ? ), 
  but then it comes to the part where the chick expects me to kiss her or whatever and i do not know how should i do it , or if she even wants it because some chicks like to pretend they 're not interested so i do not want to go for it and then get rejected :(, 
  okay so i have this samsung s duos . 
  what do i do to get rid of the horrible touchwiz and countless shitty aps ? 
  ( chaton , r u fukin serious ? ), 
  why there 's os x port and a console port but no linux port ? 
  irssi master race, 
  atleast some games go into * my games * folder . 
  hope it 's for more than just ubuntu though ... 
  my dad is a glorious linux user . 
  that solid blue and terminal color scheme does n't look very nice ( imo ), 
  that 's nocturnal 's dress . 
  but olfina has relations with joh battle-born !, 
  [ proof here ] ( http://www.uesp.net/wiki/skyrim:letter_from_olfina ), 
  dude this is n't 2008 anymore ... 
  people still think it 's 2008, 
  i like to log out on a night club . 
  5 $ to shit my pants . 
  awesome !, 
  $ 900 build and only a 760 ? 
  there are builds out there that have a r9 290 while also costing $ 900,
