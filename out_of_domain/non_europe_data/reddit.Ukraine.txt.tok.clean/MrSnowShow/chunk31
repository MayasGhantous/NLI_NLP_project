  i like the [ agent ] ( http://images.uesp.net/thumb/0/08/ob-class-agent.jpg/200px-ob-class-agent.jpg ) , [ nightblade ] ( http://images.uesp.net/thumb/7/75/ob-class-nightblade.jpg/200px-ob-class-nightblade.jpg ) and the [ healer ] ( http://images.uesp.net/thumb/c/c4/ob-class-healer.jpg/200px-ob-class-healer.jpg ) . 
  and the one that i hate is [ warrior ] ( http://images.uesp.net/thumb/a/a2/ob-class-warrior.jpg/200px-ob-class-warrior.jpg ) . 
  alchemy in oblivion is very fun for some reason . 
  in skyrim i did n't even bother and i 've been playing since release . 
  i just do n't like it , and that 's not my playstyle in rpgs . 
  i hate sword and shield . 
  but the thing is that i liked to explore oblivion wilderness and in the process collect ingredients and craft potions right there because we can do it anywhere in oblivion . 
  damn , i love lucien 's voice , so badass . 
  i really like the line where he talks about the poisoned apple :, 
  * if someone is inclined to eat , and they taste the apple ... * *** death *** . 
  words can not express it so you got to listen to it . 
  the magic part imo is much better . 
  there 's no fancy spell graphics but spells are better and sort of overpowered . 
  i wont win but i 'll post it anyway . 
  you know what they say , no luck on the game then luck on love . 
  where do you get a genuine windows disk ? 
  i can just use the code that i get on the bottom of the laptop right ? 
  and then just use the key on bottom of laptop right ? 
  \\  says pc is expensive, 
  \\  owns a mac, 
  damn i also feel psycological addiction . 
  i go for months without smoking but still get that feeling you described when near people who smoke . 
  but then some night after i drink a little bit i get a huge will to smoke . 
  most of the times i do n't but it happens . 
  have n't bough a pack and probably never will , because as my friend said `` your first pack is never the last '' . 
  this is probably what 's keeping me from becoming an active smoker + my friends that do n't smoke . 
  thanks man, 
  low quality inside . 
  ultra hd outside . 
  why are you adding des and wms ? 
   * lxde, 
  oh god that comment was legendary, 
  but [ os ] tag is no longer allowed so having a wm/de flair is a bit redundant . 
  hmm i wanted to get a ear piercing ( dude ) and all my friends opinion was `` piercings are for fags '' so i did n't get one :(, 
  you forgot a '' [ '', 
  skyrim has 99 % of dungeons with a quick exit way . 
  yea , kill the draugr while he 's sleeping  . , 
  thanks for the giveaway !, 
  random.org pick me please !, 
  infamous would be nice . 
  thanks for the giveaway !, 
  my first `` build '' was a pentium 4 no ded gpu then i added more ram ( by downloading ofc ) and a geforce 8800gt, 
  puked on my apartment stairs :(, 
  thanks for the giveaway op, 
  oh great and mighty / u/minsctheranger , his name is gr ** a ** y fox, 
  thank you and have a nice day . 
  .99 usd are u shitting me ? 
  mailinator does n't work on facebook . 
  so i used maildrop.cc, 
  too many purchase requests , fuck !, 
  football is a moba ? 
  amd stopped making the fx series , but it 's hilarious how 2012 cpus still compete with intel 's newer ones . 
  r9 290 best price/performance for a $ 360 card, 
  what classes you think are useless ? 
  one of my workspaces [ here ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wdyympk.png ), 
  oh god , norton and utorrent, 
  once again , asus r9 290 has a bad cooling design . 
  better off with something like sapphire tri-x, 
  because dunmer master race, 
  this is from this sub 's autobot :, 
  * `` lastly , here 's a few tips : adblock is awesome for hiding fake download links . 
  deluge is an excellent open-source client that is n't in close cooperation with the mpaa ( unlike utorrent , uninstall it as soon as possible ) . 
  oh , and remember : torrenting in itself is n't illegal , and it 's definitely not piracy !, 
  it 's simply a method of transferring files . 
  [ just wondering , is this hard to see ? 
  first , thanks for taking the time to read the wiki . 
  secondly to answer to the general suggestion :, 
  we need input from the community what works together and what not . 
  but most of the times it is easy to figure out what does n't work together . 
  example : a mod that changes combat animations and a mod that adds a new home , do you think they will work together ? 
  ofcourse they will since they change two very different stuff . 
  now let 's say you have a mod that changes stealth damages and a second one that is a stealth mechanics overhaul . 
  the stealth mechanics overhaul probably also tweaks the damages so they should conflict with each other . 
  remember to read the description that comes with every mod , and use your common sense : * `` hmm , i have a vampire sun damage tweak mod so this vampirism overhaul mod will probably conflict '' *, 
  hmm , this got me thinking of starting a new header in the mod list for style including clothing , armors , weapons , hairstyles , beards , etc. . . 
  is n't archbang just arch with openbox + tint2 + conky like crunchbang ? 
  use a '' \\ '' before '' \\ # '', 
  hah , i remember using limewire and also reading all those speeds like t1 , t2 , etc. . . 
  this made me want to play an mmo for some reason . 
  i really like the concept of classes where everyone specializes in something , it 's really cool . 
  i never win but it 's okay, 
  i also though of that , you could explain it better because this sub for a long time had no active mods and the `` what are the best mods '' posts were out of control so people got tired of them . 
  the speeds will be like 20 ghz and ddr15, 
  that is the glory of the modding community . 
  and all these top games : dota 2 , counter strike ... were born as mods . 
  do not worry , oblivion is n't really stable so it 's normal that it happens like that . 
  damn i love this sexy card !, 
  best r9 290 for the money imo . 
  welcome to team red . 
  17 portugal dude, 
  too bad that windows is n't sexy : /, 
  the classical `` i do not want it '' when a person is butthurt but does not want to admit . 
  that 's probably some residual psycology that peasants have which is `` u need da $ 3000 to play pc games '' . 
  i see that your problem was solved so i just mention this :, 
  ** man i love this card , sorry . 
  wow if my laptop shut down at 80 degrees then i would be fucked . 
  it always plays at 85 and only goes down at like 92 or something . 
  recently a problem started , if i played a newer game ( something after 2011 ) it would be hot as fuck , and after like half an hour the game started to drop down fps and eventually shutdown due overheating . 
  so now i 'm just playing older games at 80-ish degrees with a shitty cheap laptop cooler . 
  so i got ta try this .
