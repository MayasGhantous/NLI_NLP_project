  also my laptop starts to work hard when i watch a 720p video which is hilarious but sad at the same time . 
  still better than a console though . 
  because a console does n't offer me the freedom that the pc has . 
  which is a huge reason to me . 
  this what turns me down in mmos . 
  because i know there 's no perfect balance and i just keep thinking about theoretical battles and stuff and end up switching classes so much that i get bored and wont play anymore . 
  ( and tera doens ' t help with it 's annoying repetitive quest system ) . 
  wrong !, 
  they own `` titan z * gaming edition * '', 
  hah , i remember playing oblivion on my pentium 4 without any dedicaded gpu . 
  i had to use oldblivion which reduced the graphics to older versions of pixel shader and vertex shader . 
  had everything on low , 640x480 , had every crash fix patch and there was no lightning so dungeons were clear as day . 
  not to mention horrible graphics and no spell effects particles and any fancy stuff . 
  and also when there was too much action the game would crash , so to complete the last part of the main quest i had to always look down at the floor and save at every second because it would just crash if i looked somewhere else and there was too much action . 
  so yeah but i still played alot because oblivion is just awesome . 
  only scroll .

  nice minor changes , these are going into the [ recommended mods ] ( http://reddit.com/r/oblivion/wiki/index/mods ) . 
  thank you and have a nice day . 
  ` tfc ` for looking at my badass char . 
  ` tcl ` when i 'm stuck, 
  pls op , i give you all my upvotes !, 
  yep, 
  i also started with # !, 
  a few months ago and now i 'm planning to move to arch . 
  yay for no-ubuntu begginers !, 
  why not c/c + + as first language ? 
  that ' a what i 've been playing with some years ago as a kid . 
  reminds me of the `` get trolled hard '' kid . 
  but i ca n't find it . 
  not a fan of guis but no vim ? 
  chromium is for linux . 
  this is a very good point . 
  i also had something similar . 
  i was selling a set of equipment but i forgot one piece and the guy did n't notice , so we did the trade and then i saw the last piece was still in my inventory but i still gave it to him . 
  i can not be evil :( even with a stranger in a video game . 
  i know , but he also made a suggestionn since i do not use any mod manager then i answered only to the suggestion . 
  just wondering , did you see / r/oblivion 's recommended mods ? 
  [ some people do not see these ] ( http://i.imgur.com/hw3jm03.png ), 
  that ' a why we need contribution from the community so we can expand the list to be more diverse . 
  also you wanted a map mod . 
  one from the list is : * elven map redux * . 
  ca n't link right now i 'm on phone but just google it . 
  edit : [ link ] ( http://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/3002/ ? ), 
  is this sub dead ? 
  steamos is just a distro for the linux kernel . 
  when people say `` linux '' they are actually referring to `` gnu/linux '' with any distro since `` linux '' by itself is n't a os . 
  have n't bough an ubisoft game since release of uplay . 
  get cheaper ram dude , you can save $ 20-30 . 
  nothing to do with the build . 
  but use double enter to make a paragraph so it is easier to read . 
  i 'm portuguese , what happens if i order part from usa or whatever and it is faulty , will i send it back all the way to usa and stuff ? 
  i would only change the hdd to a wd caviar blue . 
  i 've seen alot of reports how people had like 3 seagate hdds dead and wd still alive and running . 
  your parts are from older gens but still powerful . 
  the only thing that is worthy to upgrade from the list is the '' * piece of shit keyboard * '' , get yourseld a mechanical kb !, 
  xfx 's and gigabyte 's r9 290s are currently lower than usual price , sapphire was also on sale a while back , too bad it 's over since tri-x is so sexy . 
  7770 is kinda old . 
  you can get more recent cards for that money . 
  also wd caviar blue over seagate . 
  i 'll take a look at them when i get back on pc . 
  minor mods are my favourite ones . 
  asus cooling on r9 290 is bad . 
  pick other brand . 
  shame i 'm on phone right now . 
  but if people can make budget builds for $ 450 that include a gpu more powerful than new consoles then you can make a pc for your parents for as little as 300 if you go cheap , i even saw a 200 apu build somewhere . 
  cpu is overkill , mobo can be cheaper , as well as case , psu and ram . 
  use the reddit/markdown format button that is on the top right near the wattage and copy/pasta it here . 
  you 're cheaping out a bit on the cpu compared to the rest of your parts , get atleast a 8320 for 150ish or something like intel 4430 4440 or 4570 for 170-190 . 
  cheaper ram , save $ 20, 
  with that money get an r9 290 instead it performs better while also having 4gb gddr5, 
  really need that $ 50 optical drive ? 
  replace caviar green with caviar blue . 
  you can go with i3-4130 cpu, 
  corsair cx 430w is enough, 
  save a few bucks going with 1600 ram ( $ 60 is ideal price ) or even go with 4gb and save more, 
  and you could argue the rest but you can save like $ 20 - $ 30 on cheaper mobo and case, 
  also get windows from someplace else if you can, 
  with the saved money if you think your parents wont use much space then you could drop the hdd get them a ssd to make things faster, 
  yay for the red team !, 
  oh no why you bough a pre built pc ? 
  what is pcs + ? 
  sorry for this , but seeing as amd gets kind off `` bullied '' from both intel and nvidia in cpus and gpus respectively , it is nice to see amd rising and providing better price/performance ratios despite the odds kind of being against them . 
  ( bullshit that i see : amd drivers are crap/amd cards are hot as fuck/nvidia adding bunch of their stuff to games like physx ), 
  wow you said ati , nostalgic moment ... 
  definetly not asus for the 290 since the design of cooler is bad . 
  sapphire tri x is pretty nice , it was $ 360 some weeks ago but now it has gone up in price . 
  current cheap choices are xfx and gigabyte i believe for around $ 370ish . 
  are n't powecolor just reference cards that are hot as hell ? 
  edit : oh wait just saw that it had some fans and stuff , are they good as for example tri x , double dissipation and windforce ? 
  do you need the i7 ? 
  i5 will be fine in gaming for $ 100 less . 
  also you can get cheaper ram for like $ 60 - $ 70 . 
  r9 280x seems the best choice . 
  just wondering , what brand of the r9 290 ? 
  wow is windforce rly that bad ? 
  i though they were one of the top coolers . 
  or is it only a case in 290 ? 
  pakscape for . pk3 files right ? 
  just no .
