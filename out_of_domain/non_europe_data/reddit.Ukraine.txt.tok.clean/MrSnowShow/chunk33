  i 'm pretty sure asus has some problems with their cooler design in newer r9 cards so you might check that out . 
  yes , the sexyness from sapphire cards is just too hypnotizing . 
  i remember watching benchmarks of 280x vs 770 as they trade blows back and forth ... 
  ** gloriousgaben **, 
  sid meier 's civilization v + gods and kings, 
  crysis 2 maximum edition, 
  thanks for the giveaway and have a nice day . 
  i used it on star wars jedi knight jedi academy, 
  you should not get the asus 280 because atleast in the r9 290 the cooling has a bad design so it 's less efficient . 
  ah , a linux brother . 
  i can not wait until the day when linux gloriously becomes the gamers ' platform . 
  no idea . 
  as much as i wanted it to be that early , there is still little support and directx is still dominant . 
  why would you get a reference amd dude ? 
  any feedback on the css theme ? 
  tried to make it look like oblivion 's default ui , but it 's a constant work in progress . 
  i do n't think there 's a problem leaving the main quest for later . 
  and yes , you probably have a disadvantage because of the leveling problem and not efficient leveling ( getting +5 three times for attributes when leveling up ) makes it worse . 
  * but note that doing a `` perfect character '' is not required to enjoy oblivion . 
  there are a couple of solutions to this problem :, 
  * you can follow the [ efficient leveling ] ( http://www.uesp.net/wiki/oblivion:efficient_leveling ) . 
  * if you do not have the will to do it normally then you can download [ all +5 attributes modifier ] ( http://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/2691 ) so you receive +5 each time you level up . 
  * or you can use mods that change the way that leveling and scaling of enemies works . 
  mostly focusing on making some static level mobs , ** not ** making the entire world scale with player ( you can encounter low level enemies while being high level and vice-versa which is impossible in vanilla oblivion ) , etc. . . 
  i 'm sure reading mods ' description will inform you more . 
  see ** overhauls ** at the [ recommended mods ] ( http://reddit.com/r/oblivion/wiki/index/mods ) . 
  edit :, 
  * or you can simply turn down the difficulty slider , i used to do that when i was new to the game and did n't bother with efficient levelings and stuff . 
  console users would n't be surprised . 
  did you know that they pay for minecraft skins and texture packs ? 
  other people have already writen alot of reasons , but trust me . 
  once you go pc , you never go back . 
  you 'll be amazed on how much you 've missed . 
  [ here 's todd howards saying that pc is the best place to play skyrim ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0mpuiyjkui&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=19m15s ) but the same reasons also apply to oblivion and morrowind . 
  oh and if you do n't know who todd howards is , he 's basically the main man in bethesda . 
  personally no . 
  si is a full expansion ( one of the best dlcs ever ) while kotn is just some new places and armor with a questline . 
  hey noobs , i 'm totally like gon na own you noobs la la la la la la la la, 
  getting it right for both 768p laptop users and 1080p desktops and phone is a bit hard ( with my css knowledge ) but i 'll try . 
  also do n't you browse reddit with an app ? 
  like reddit is fun , reddit sync , etc. . ? 
  you should download a reddit app for faster browse , i personally use reddit is fun . 
  i 'm on the phone at the moment ca n't direct link . 
  i 'm pretty sure it 's the last one on the [ recommended mods ] ( http://reddit.com/r/oblivion/wiki/index/mods ), 
   if you have an nvidia graphic card it should run well . 
  what 's the problem with amd ? 
  lakeside koth, 
  pretty sure no one knows this one . 
  it 's ** mp/ffa3 ** from star wars jedi knight jedi academy ( jk3 shortly ) and ** ffa_bespin ** from star wars jedi knight 2 jedi outcast ( jk2 ), 
  player.removeitem [ id ], 
  it 's only, 
  player.remove item 1fece, 
  if u use the ` 1 ` after ` 1fece ` it will not work . 
  not to sound cocky but i think this is what i do naturally all the time . 
  i just ca n't get mad and yell at people no matter what , sure i might get mad but only on my thoughts and it only lasts like 10 minutes and then i purposely try to keep being mad at that person but i just ca n't . 
  also i never yelled and raised my voice at people . 
  and when i try to call for someone far away i try raise my voice but i do n't feel like `` myself '' when i to do it and proceed to fail yell/scream . 
  get up early, 
  do workout that i havent been doing for years regularely, 
  dont fap, 
  study later for exam tomorrow, 
  well temperature is the amount of movement that particles have . 
  particles moving faster generate more heat and interact with each other and stuff to generate heat, 
  since the universe is alot of empty space it makes sense that it 's cold . 
  theoretically 0 kelvin is the lowest temperature possible . 
  but at 0 k there is no volume so there 's nothing . 
  and in theory , if you go over the speed of light then time will go backwards . 
  ofcourse , intel `` graphics card '' are n't dedicaded they come with their processors so it 's no surprise that it does n't run well . 
  and there should be no problem with amd cards as i have one pretty old and it works fine . 
  their subreddit has a post with reasons . 
  i just wont do it to dont feel like a looser without a girl . 
  playing my vampire `` daggermage '' at the moment . 
  using my own [ sun damage change ] ( http://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/45002/ ? ), 
  to make it less annoying . 
  ctrl + shift + ** p ** orn, 
  this is nasty : /, 
  but it 's sad that somebody somewhere already does this . 
  flight is ~ ~ bad ~ ~ slow . 
  same shit with australia and sydney ... 
  dollar is worth more than euro, 
  reminds me of all the awful specs details in ads . 
  amd hd graphics ( what is the card model ? 
  vram ? ), 
  500 gb storage ( rpm ? ), 
  intel core i5 processor ( model ? 
  clock speed ? ), 
  no info on the psu or mobo whatsoever, 
   a teacher told me the reason for the seasons is that the earth is further from the sun during winter . 
  earth is further from the sun during winter is only true in the southern hemisphere, 
  but seasons are not caused by distance but by planet 's inclination ( 23 degrees ? 
  op where 's edit7 ? 
  what `` german stuff '', 
  gold shower ? 
  did it also have reduced fov ? 
   to stream at console level at 792p 30fps you will need to underclock a 4 year old gtx 480 to 405 mhz . 
  ftfy, 
  but even apple themselves do n't agree with that . 
  ** pcs are expensive **, 
  ugh this is the most retarded shit ever , and then they proceed to buy macs , both consoles and every new game that comes out at $ 60 . 
  if you care about your money , you will go pc .
