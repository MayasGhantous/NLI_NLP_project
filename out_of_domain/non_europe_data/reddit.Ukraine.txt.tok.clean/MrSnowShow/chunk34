  piracy ( stfu bot ! ), 
  made me go pc , because as a little kid i had a ps2 i wanted to play games but my parents could n't keep buying me games for 64 $ back then because i would just beat them in 3 days . 
  so at 9 years old parents bough a pc and i learned to torrent and just kept with it since and i fell in love with kb and mouse ( no seriously , i collected all 120 stars in super mario 64 with kb and mouse ) . 
  and i also liked the feeling of `` freedom '' that pc offers . 
  but now i got older and rebuying everything that i pirated . 
  specs ? 
  i would like 1 and 2 please . 
  thank you op, 
  800 will build you a nice very machine . 
  first i would suggest you inform yourself about the different pc parts . 
  newegg has 3 videos about building a pc . 
  first one is about all the parts i suggest watching that . 
  that cpu and gpu were cheap as fuck . 
  congratz on the deal ( and welcome to the red team ) . 
  hah i remember some months ago it was 4670k and 770 trend . 
  i love seeing a nice budget build with a big bang for buck instead of those 1000 $ builds that have a 750 ti ... 
  amd cards have stabilized from mining . 
  alot of r9 290s are around because they 're cheap as fuck and have good performance . 
  and amd cards are cheaper in general and offer around the same ( if not more ) performance compared to respective nvidia counterparts . 
  edit : not sure how long but i 've heard talk about 800 series and r9 ( 390 ? ), 
  do n't h81 mobos only allow single channel ? 
  because i read that somewhere . 
  i might be wrong . 
  you do the right thing . 
  most builds i see here people just focus more on cpu and other stuff and end up with a $ 1100 build while having a r7 260x ... 
  better go with z, 
  why i havent seen xeons then on builds here ? 
  i7 with no graphics costing like i5 . 
  what 's the catch ? 
  asus r9 290 is a bad choice . 
  the cooler design is bad . 
  also what kind of mobo is that ? 
  you can get cheaper ones with a locked cpu, 
  do n't get the asus r9 290 . 
  because the cooler design is bad and it is n't efficient . 
  get something like xfx , sapphire or gigabyte i think it 's on sale atm . 
  nice deals mate . 
  i 'm currently on a hp overheating laptop from 2010 too so i only play older games or else after 30 minutes of s newer game it starts stuterring due to cpu overheat and just shut down . 
  i have money but i will stay one more year in school and then probably next year move to capital for university and come home only for weekends so i do n't know if it 's worth . 
  you can build it for half the price or less . 
  770 is a lower tier so it 's worse than r9 290 . 
  770 compares with r9 280x while r9 290 compares with 780, 
  damn , mobos are n't really my speciality also i 'm on phone it 's 2 am and i ca n't take a look at them : /, 
  $ 1000 and a 750 ti is not a good bang for buck . 
  with that money you can get a r9 290 which is like much more faster than the 750 ti, 
  just a tip, 
  top right there 's a button ** reddit/markdown list ** or something . 
  click that and copy paste here for a nicely formatted table .

  have you ever played star wars jedi knight jedi academy ? 
  hp pavilion dv6-7 whatevee juet suck . 
  source : i own one, 
  whatever you do dont buy hp . 
  source : own one, 
  well the 8xxx series are from 2012 so it 's natural that intel is winning now . 
  this is sad because i 'm a amd fan , atleast they still have the gpu market going ok . 
  yep . 
  i rly want it . 
  but i wont have the time to use it : /, 
  / r/mildlyinteresting, 
  do some alchemy . 
  poisons are strong as fuck . 
  that psu is a bit expensive . 
  did you use pcpartpicker.com ? 
  why $ 80 optical drive ? 
  it should cost you like $ 20 . 
  for me personally a 1000 build must have atleast 280x/770 or better gpu to be worthy . 
  but that 's me , some people go fancy cases water cooling ocing cpus fancy mobos fancy kb mouse headset 16 gb of overkill ram and just gimp on the gpu ... 
  also if you go pcpartpicker.com there 's a button top right ** reddit/markdown format ** or something like that . 
  click it and copy paste the code it will make a nice formatted table here on reddit . 
  i just sometimes assume automatically that every build is a gaming one that is trying to save money on all stuff and go all in for the gpu but that is n't true . 
  have no idea because never used ps and fl ( even though i have it on my pc because i want to fuck around ) . 
  super speed was always the fastest dude .

  whodunit is obviously the # 1 for alot of people , and for good reasons . 
  on top of my head , i can only remember one quest which is order of the virtuous blood . 
  how do you know that ? 
  if you want to read then [ here ] ( http://www.uesp.net/wiki/differences_between_morrowind,_oblivion,_and_skyrim ) this is all about mechanics and stuff . 
  many people ( me included ) say that oblivions quests and factions are better ( especially the dark brotherhood < 3 ) . 
  also oblivion feels much more a fantasy world and has a fitting music to it . 
  the real complains i have are leveling system and ugly characters but this can be fixed with [ mods ] ( http://reddit.com/r/oblivion/wiki/index/mods ), 
  have we gone meta ? 
  very soon i 'll get a pc because i 'm 4 years with [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/snepzgr.jpg ), 
  do n't forget to go to gog.com and use their backup feature where you put the ~ ~ cd ~ ~ steam key and you will have it in your account anytime for download without any kind of drm and bonus content such as soundtracks , artworks etc. . . also do the same with witcher 2 . 
  account register takes like half a minute and doesnt need email confirm . 
  support gog because they 've put alot of faith in pc gaming .

  thanks for the giveaway, 
  it was bough back in 2010 and it has an i7 720 ( 1.6 ghz ) so me 13 years old thinks `` wow i7 and a 1gb dedicaded gpu is more than enough and it 's 20 % off '' and parents buy it . 
  the processor overheats as fuck even with a computer cooler some weeks ago it starts to stutter heavily under 20 minutes and then just shuts down . 
  this happens when i play games that are newer than 2011 and are aaa with good graphics , so i just play old games now . 
  hell even a video at 720p starts to heat . 
  maybe it 's my shitty 15 $ cooler , but i do n't know if i should waste money on this sucker by buying a better cooler . 
  yes my shitty 15 $ does n't help that much . 
  if i play a aaa game ( borderlands 2 for example ) after 20 minutes the processor overheats and the game starts stuttering and eventually shuts down . 
  so i only play older games now . 
  do n't know if i should invest in a better laptop cooler because i might just get myself a desktop . 
  i 'm not sure if i undestood your question , but having a `` backup '' on their website is just having the game right there always availiable for download without any kind of drm , you download the installer and play the game without any software . 
  also you get bonus stuff and discounts on witcher 3 i think if you have one or both of them ( need confirm ),
