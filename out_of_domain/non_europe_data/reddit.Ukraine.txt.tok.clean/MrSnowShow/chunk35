  or was it edited ? 
  oh my god i just used that on my last game :(, 
  if the river flows red , then take the dirt road . 
  and when i started tf2 i just played spy ... suffered alot . 
  it always pisses me of how teens of my age ( 17 ) just keep thinking that their parents owe them something . 
  like wtf are you serious ? 
  you owe them everything you have and you 're bitching because they wont buy you a new phone . 
  link ? 
  but it 's the best in combat and the fastest of the 3 . 
  backstory op ? 
  flight is just boring , what 's the fun of * just * flying when you can run around , jump off buildings , dodging obstacles , using your speed to jump higher/further while leaving electricity trails . 
  makes travelling much more fun . 
  damn this is sexy as fuck . 
  are gaps only for dwm or can i get them for i3 ? 
  thanks for the input, 
  now that i think about it , it 's a bit redundant to have a huge 200px height saying oblivion . 
  but more feedback and possible new banners for the header would be nice help . 
  oh hello there brother . 
  gaben bless you . 
  this is a very useful piece of information , definetly going to the wiki !, 
  imagine , assassin 's creed brother/sisterhood . 
  it 's the same as man referring to all humanity . 
  ( in my language atleast , . 
  do n't know if english is the same ), 
  to be honest , i like it much more when people show off budget builds with good bang for buck . 
  i really do n't appreciate those 1500 $ builds with fancy mobo , fancy cpu , fancy case , h100i , 850w +80 plat , razer/steelseries/whatever mouse kb headset and at the end 750 ti . 
  this kind of attitude pisses me off . 
  `` i will gladly bend over and take it in the ass whenever microsoft wants '', 
  i think the flairs should be like `` pc master race , mac heathen , notebook nobles '' according to that hierarchy triangle that i ca n't link right now . 
  because there is a pc master race flair and also a desltop pc flair . 
  also need to think one for linux . 
  your friends are just jealous . 
  people find hard to admit that there 's a better alternative to what they 're used to . 
  picture them pushing a cart with square wheels , then you come by with circular wheels and they just say `` naah , it 's too easy for us '' and keep on strugling . 
  r9 290x if you care about your money . 
  price/performance much better . 
  what is your budget ? 
  that 's a fucking downgrade . 
  why the vapor-x ? 
  tri-x is fine ( 3 degrees celcius difference ) and alot cheaper . 
  you can get even cheaper with xfx dd . 
  also i guess you 're planning on getting another 8gb stick because 2x4 is better than 1x8 if you 'll stick with 8 gb . 
  what is your budget ? 
  no europe ? 
  i prefer the super key . 
  r9 270x then . 
  drivers ? 
  recent ones improved watch dogs by alot . 
  hey / r/oblivion community ,, 
  just resized the banner ( which i made quickly in paint since i 'm no artist ) to be a bit smaller , as a [ suggestion ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/2b4e4t/nice_layout_for_a_subreddit_but_theres_just_one/ ) said . 
  which i agree there 's no point for it to be so big ( atleast with this banner image ) . 
  what do you think about this ? 
  does it look nicer ? 
  and if you have any suggestions for a banner image then let the community know . 
  thank you and have a nice week . 
  but if you still want to play vampire purely of aesthetics/roleplaying ( like myself ) then i suggest installing some vampirism mods . 
  i use my own [ sun damage change ] ( http://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/45002/ ? ), 
  so the sun damage does n't bother me as much and i can keep roleplaying as a vampire . 
  there are plenty of other mods that change alot of stuff in vampirism . 
  my hp has bad cooling system so it 's overheating as fuck . 
  dv6 series suck . 
  guess bspwm is my new wm, 
  hp sucks, 
  source : own one, 
  star wars jedi knight series, 
  after posting that comment , the peasant proceeds to google `` how to add mods to xbox 360 '', 
  it seems that the whole `` straight to the point '' that older consoles had , is gone . 
  still owning the dv6 . 
  damn it sucks . 
  just play the game and only then start researching about the mechanics and stuff . 
  you will have good memories of the things you did when you were clueless . 
  [ just wondering , is this hard to see ? 
  why would you go back to ps3 ? 
  it has less dlc + even if you do n't want to cheat and stuff you can install the unnoficial patches and better graphics . 
  did u read the [ recommended mods ] ( http://reddit.com/r/oblivion/wiki/index/mods ) ?
