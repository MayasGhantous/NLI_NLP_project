  edit : fixed link, 
  links ? 
  money will be used on spell making . 
  also why no conjuration ? 
  oblivion 's conjured mobs are diverse and fun !, 
  clannfear is my personal favourite . 
  too little details . 
  there are hundreds of reasons why your game is crashing and giving details will narrow that number down . 
  / u/l0st-d 4md seems to enjoy doing these . 
  also sometimes it 's nice to have chill moments like this . 
  what do you use your computer for ? 
  i 'm asking this because * bsd has less applications avaliable ( i think ), 
  gaps are sexy, 
   there 's much less programs that work out of the box , though . 
  this is what i really had in mind when i said `` bsd has less applications avaliable '' . 
  also a problem i have is all my friends and stuff use skype for example ( which i dislike ) . 
  oh and another thing , is programming in linux/unix only works for linux/unix ? 
  that 's not * `` spectral assassin '' * . 
  that is ** lucien mothafuckin lachance !, 
  it 's part from the [ immersive armors ] ( http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/19733/ ? ), 
  new banner by / u/avian81 !, 
  this one looks much better . 
  thanks for the contribution !, 
  already implemented it and looks nice for me . 
  definetly better than what i did in paint haha . 
  also in sidebar you have been credited . 
  hey , do you mind if i post this info on the faq ? 
  because sadly i do not use any mod manager so i do n't have any experience at all with them mod managers . 
  that 's great . 
  the faq is a bit uncategorized at the moment but i 'll fix it in a few minutes . 
  just wanted to say thanks to you and / u/minsctheranger are the ones that provide the most technical help and that 's is awesome by your part . 
  but do n't most companies that hire programmers require them to program stuff to work on windows ? 
  with . exe and shit . 
  r9 290 is 4gb , ~ ~ cheaper ~ ~ around the same price and more powerful . 
  bioshock 2 would be great, 
  thank you and have a nice day op, 
  [ op 's card ] ( http://pcpartpicker.com/part/gigabyte-video-card-gvn770oc4gd ) - $ 359 with a $ 20 rebate ( no rebate is $ 379 ) . 
  [ xfx r9 290 ] ( http://pcpartpicker.com/part/xfx-video-card-r9290aedfd ) - $ 372 with promo code and rebate . 
  for pure gaming , r9 290 is the obvious choice, 
  i agree with him . 
  between both consoles , ps4 is the obvious choice for me . 
  it 's cheaper ( or atleast was , no idea ) and is always a step higher in resolution than the xbone . 
  why some people pay more ( or equal ) and get a worse experience by buying xbone i do n't know ... 
  bioshock please . 
  thank you for this !, 
  fixed the link now , but you can find it on the sidebar and below the banner . 
  as a level 47 mage , the game is stupidly easy for me . 
  need to bump up the difficulty to max or else i one shot everything . 
  well i can not recommend you any playstyle because i have no idea what are your preferences . 
  anyway , just play the game and experiment different stuff and see how they work out . 
  well i have 100 spell absorb and use a glitch which is that you absorb your own telekinesis and restore mana ( atronach birthsign so my magicka regen is 0 ) . 
  also i used a mod to add +100 magicka enchantment to my robe . 
  this is because a robe occupies two slots , but the sigil stone only gives +50 magicka . 
  so if i wear shirt and pants i can have 2x +50 and with a robe i can only have 1x +50 . 
  edit : so i have fortify magicka on everything except necklace and both rings . 
  plus i have 33 % damage reflect ring and a 60 second 100 % armor spell that makes me immune to physical damage which is pretty op . 
  i can sneak easly with invisibily and open very hard locks with a spell . 
  and my main source of damage consists of 2 spells . 
  * weakness to fire frost and shock 100 %, 
  * damage from fire front and shock 50 pts for 3 seconds, 
  kills anything at normal difficulty . 
  what is the missionary ? 
  non-native english speaker and on phone atm . 
  i also love this aspect . 
  it is ** my ** pc . 
  not one of the millions other clones that exist there in thw world . 
  oohhh that was my first ^ ^ and ^ ^ only position . 
   and on phone atm, 
  this is why i did n't google, 
  and i get asked if the baby looks more like father or mother . 
  how the fuck would i know ? 
  the baby looks like a potato to me . 
  doing research by yourself is great and it should be the first option before asking for help . 
  one of the most satisfying things ( for me personally ) is figuring out something on my own . 
  i 'm actually thinking of just erasing my windows partition and dispose of my gaming habits . 
  without si , i know of, 
  * fire salts, 
  it 's damage health fire damage and shock damage . 
  not much magnitude but for 37 seconds or something . 
  edit : also the six effect poisons have only 2 damaging effects and rest are like burden and silence so i think the best option for pure damage is going with 3 effect because they 're all damage ( like the one i posted above ), 
  edit2 : also added the alchemy calculator to the sidebar . 
  thanks for that !,
