  i only know of [ real lights ] ( http://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/10891/ ? ), 
  so what do you really program ? 
  what languages ? 
  because i 'm thinking of going programmer but have no idea what my job will be, 
  awesome , i 'm in like the final lap . 
  i 'll just keep myself entretained with ricing my setup and learning to program . 
  it 's important to find another occupation or else i will relapse . 
   and am afraid of screwing up . 
  no one has ever installed mods and not screwed up atleast once . 
  this happens to everyone . 
  well just keep playing and when there 's something you do n't like try to fix it with a mod . 
  for example , i hated how i could n't delete spells so i searched for a mod and i [ found it ] ( http://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/23069/ ? ), 
  * use sneak atacks, 
  * enchant it with a sigil stone, 
  * craft poisons, 
  [ john mayer - covered in rain ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89l86ywdwkg ), 
  even better is to build one by yourself . 
  yes it will , but i ** strongly ** recommend you building your own pc . 
  it will be cheaper , costumizable , and you will know that you have quality components on your rig . 
  and building a pc is not rocket science , if you have the ability to read and/or watch a 20 minute youtube video then you 're more than capable to do it . 
  this sub scrolls horizontally , just saying . 
  but i see alot of mod showcase posts and their gpu is the 660 ti, 
  cons0le haz the best e-sportz !, 
  all pr0 players are on console !! 1 !! 1 !!! oneone !, 
  and here i am trying to ditch my gaming habits by deleting my windows partition ... 
  * very lightweight * is running something like ratpoison , i3 , bspwm , dwm , cwm , awesome . 
  i 'm still a linux newbie yet , running crunchbang atm . 
  my plan is now switch to arch and fill entire disk and then eventually move to freebsd because messing with a unix descendant sounds awesome . 
  ugh i hate how google buys anything that is becoming popular and eventually tries ( and fails ) to incorporate their features . 
  because i want to learn to install arch :d, 
  nothing has changed ... yet . 
  no update for a year . 
  a blog update of wollay showing off the new quest system and a new video of it in action . 
  dude this is nothing special , might just post it to / r/wallpappers instead, 
  \\  pc is not meant to play games, 
  \\  still gets the job done better than consoles . 
  do n't get the asus , the cooling is badly designed for this card . 
  there 's qarl 's texture pack already in omod format . 
  check the [ recommended mods ] ( http://reddit.com/r/oblivion/wiki/index/mods ) wiki page, 
  you could have opened up some terminals, 
  my windows setup has a [ related wallpapper ] ( http://fc04.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2014/196/0/8/bioshock___splashdown_by_khurth-d7qti92.png ), 
  gives massive discounts , has a modding community/tools , you can win money by playing , no ads , game sharing ...

  all other people already pointed out reasons to go pc . 
  and i want to give one more a lil bit uncommon . 
  you build a pc , it 's yours ( to an extent ) , you know exactly what you have in your rig , you have chosen every part that you wanted , pc platform is not owned by anyone . 
  so would you rather build something unique ? 
  or buy one of the millions ps4s that are owned by one company and you must accept whatever they 've thrown at you ? 
  damn i wish i was you , i 'm 17 and i 've lost a huge chunk of my interest in gaming , no idea why . 
  i game now for like 1 hour not even everyday and it 's only one old game and i just chat or go afk and do n't even fight . 
  that is some sexy / r/unixporn right there . 
  i 'm moving to bspwm because gaps are so nice . 
  3 days have passed and i 'm still in love with this !, 
  how you add borders in openbox ? 
   this game is pay to win, 
  oh that 's bad, 
   it just makes things go faster , it does n't give an `` unfair advantage . '', 
  gameplay wise . 
  what ? 
  definition of pay to win is exactly `` paying to ** win ** '' and not `` paying to make this faster '' . 
  so this game ** is n't ** pay to win according to what you said . 
  sorry for replying to a 5 month old comment but i sort of agree with you . 
  i started playing on 2.7 and stopped at 3.0 , the new classes do n't appeal to me whatsoever and do n't fit in the world : /, 
  i only know of [ deadly reflex ] ( http://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/8273/ ? ),

  how much you wasted on it ? 
  the most i 've spent on a game was 20 $ and it is alot to me haha . 
  i do n't know if i should go into aion again or not ... 
  i prefer tera much more , but my 2 friends are playing aion so ... 
  it 's consolerized . 
  i really hope the next elder scrolls makes a proper pc game since [ todd howards said that with skyrim they did 2-3 times better on pc ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0mpuiyjkui&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=19m15s ) . 
  this includes :, 
  * proper pc ui, 
  * high res textures, 
  * if possible use more cores, 
  etc. . . 
  u tel da trut !, 
  chipper n moar powerfool ?

  it may not have the best leveling system or main quest , but the world feels like a real magical fantasy one with nice atmosphere and fitting music . 
  never played morrowind ( not in mood of playing ** any ** game at the moment ... ) so i can only compare it to skyrim . 
  also it being my first elder scrolls game changes my perspective alot . 
  9 year old me ( 2006 ) watching my friend playing , then managing to get it working on my pentium 4 with no dedicaded graphics card . 
  using oldblivion , everything on the lowest possible , 640x480 , all crash fixes and the game still would crash if there was too much going on so i had to always look at the floor when action heated up . 
  but prior to that i was trying to install morrowind but i failed , gave up and found out later about oldblivion . 
  so if i managed to get morrowind working 8 years ago then ** maybe ** i would like morrowind more . 
  i 'm a ( vampire ) blademage , i use ranged spells and dagger for melee . 
  he was was efficiently leveled . 
  i had to bump up the difficulty to maximum because lower than that my spell combo which is :, 
  * weakness to shock , fire and frost 100 % for 35 seconds,
