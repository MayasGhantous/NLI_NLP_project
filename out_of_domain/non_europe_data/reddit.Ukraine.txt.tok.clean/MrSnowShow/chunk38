  * shock , fire and frost damage 50 pts for 3 seconds, 
  this 2-spell combo simply destroys * almost * anything at medium difficulty . 
  sometimes i want to get sneaky and use a bow , but this is very rare . 
  i have some pretty powerful poisons that destroy anything very slowly . 
  i have 100 % spell absorbtion , atronach birthsign so to recharge my magicka i use the telekinesis exploit/glitch/bug ( you absorb your own telekinesis , thus restoring magicka ) . 
  and i have several `` gamebreaking '' spells such as :, 
  * 100 % armor for 60 seconds . 
  * open very hard lock, 
  * invisibility, 
  have all the summons should i want to relax and let them deal with it . 
  oh and vampirism is only for role-playing purposes and personal preference ( vampires are cool ) and i use my own [ sun damage change ] ( http://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/45002/ ? ), 
  to make it easier for me . 
  no idea , sometimes it happens and then i play again but this time it 's pretty long . 
  i really want to play games and stuff but i just do n't have any will to do it . 
  i hop into a game and after 5 minutes i 'm out ... 
  i mostly on the pc now learn to play songs in guitar , browse reddit , fuck around in my linux setup and chat with friends : /, 
  blade , alchemy , alteration , conjuration , destruction , illusion , restoration . 
  my logic was that the cap was 85 points which is 100 % damage reduction . 
  but i tested it out and 85 % spell does the same thing . 
  thanks, 
  on this playthrough i simply used [ all +5 attributes modifiers ] ( http://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/2691/ ? ) . 
  i did n't want to bother too much because i just wanted to relieve the experience and not to force myself through boring and tedious ways just to level efficiently . 
  unnoficial patches and nothing else i think . 
  the first playthrough just go modless and then mod the things that you want to change . 
  for example : after modless playthroughs i did n't like how i could n't delete spells so i searched for a mod that [ does exactly this ] ( http://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/23069/ ? 
  change in launcher . 
  damn what is your mod list ? 
  because i 'm also experiencing a crash on exit ( does n't really bother me since i want to exit the game anyway ) but now i understand why my sensivity changes never save . 
  so if you get your mod list i can see which ones we have in common and maybe fix it . 
  yes i remember oblivion not crashing only on a clean install . 
  people get sometimes better fps on skyrim at ultra than on oblivion ultra . 
  i 'm not really sure what you mean , but i 'll assume it 's reinstalling the game . 
  simply right-click oblivion on your steam library and select * delete local content * and it should uninstall and then just download it again . 
  pug ( not sure if it is an acronym ) means when you are placed to a dungeon with random people, 
  this is the part when you fall down and bleeeeeeeeed to death !, 
  makes me cringe everytime . 
  if the cops ask , you did n't get in here okay ? 
  spy around here, 
  god i failed that mission so many times, 
  so tractor !, 
  dofus anyone ? 
  i really enjoy those , they 're actually feel like a real journal by describing stuff . 
  and the sound effect felt really magical just like all cyrodiil . 
  skyrim dissapointed me with it 's journal entries . 
  because that code replaces the text next to the reddit alien with a banner . 
  i know of this video you speak since i used it too . 
  when the big twist on the dark brotherhood questline occurred . 
  lucien lachance :(, 
  came home at 1 am . 
  `` eh just going to see if i have any reddit mail '', 
  currently 2:38 am ... * fuck *, 
  alternate guide is the best, 
  dofus was my first mmo too . 
  i recently just logged in to see how it was , incarnam was deserted just as astrub :(, 
  i started playing from version 1.26 and stopped at 2.0 . 
  something about 2.0 killed what i loved about the game . 
  sometimes i listen 1.2 x soundtracks and they 're just on a other level compared to new songs ... 
  i did n't level much . 
  because i did alot of pvp . 
  was hanging around with a lvl 37 sacrier with a shitty tofu set and a shitty cape and no toady but was rank 4 . 
  then i leveled up to 46 and became rank 5 , it was so cool every high level of my faction liked me because of my rank . 
  some high level opposing faction killed me for no reason ( maybe jealous ? 
  and i was always patrolling north astrub looking for bontas to kill . 
  ati 5650m and 1366x768, 
  start a game - 99\u00bac after 20 minutes . 
  [ super hotkeys ] ( http://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/22326/ ? ), 
  it 's a fucking laptop . 
  gon na apply new thermal paste and clean it tomorrow !, 
  happy cake day !, 
  good :, 
  * ost, 
  * magical world, 
  * faction ( oh db < 3 ), 
  * ** spellmaking **, 
  * fun quests ( oh whodunit < 3 ), 
  * shivering isles is the best dlc ever, 
  * hero of kvatch is the most powerful because [ si spoiler ] ( #s `` he became sheogorath '' ), 
  * variety of races ( in skyrim there wouldnt be a variety of races because all khajiit are trading caravans and stuff ... ), 
  bad :, 
  * stability on pc, 
  * leveling system, 
  * repetitive gates, 
  is n't weed also legal in colorado ? 
  `` you have a beautiful slut face '', 
  / r/hurtinganimals, 
  please do n't click it !, 
  fuck this sub and every person involved in that are fucking prick bitch ass piece of shit motherfuckers . 
  hah i do n't think it will work again for me xd, 
  gamestop made even a build guide some ( months ? ), 
  ago, 
  console, 
  \\  meant for gaming, 
  \\  fails, 
  and others like `` wish i had the time to do it but i better just buy one prebuilt '', 
  building a pc is worth anyone 's time . 
  you 'll learn alot during the process and wont get scammed anymore in pc repair shops . 
  some countries even use the word playstation instead of console because there 's nothing else . 
  source : live there, 
  do n't really want to be the `` you must be fun at parties '' guy , but subreddits like eli5 and askreddit get gilded for insightful/helpful/funny / etc i mean worthy comments . 
  i would be more happier if gilding in / r/pcmasterrace was also because of those reasons .
