  [ this is sexier in my opinion ] ( http://images.anandtech.com/doci/7601/sapphire_290_trix_3qtr.jpg ), 
  ** update : ** got new thermal paste on cpu and gpu , cleaned it up of the dust . 
  max temperature when playing an intensive game : 65-70\u00bac, 
  fuck yea !, 
  and next-to-none noise whatsoever even during intensive tasks . 
  lines too bold for * my * taste . 
  but this is fucking awesome idea . 
  let 's just hope the mods add it . 
  . self . thumbnail { background : url ( % % image % % ) no-repeat 0 0 ; }, 
  [ loving the new css ] ( / r/colors ), 
  yeah it 's nice . 
  now just mods to add it . 
  while sorc is pure mage , we need an `` off-mage '' . 
  there are countries out there that do n't even have an xbox so they use `` playstation '' instead of `` console '' because there 's nothing else .

  thanks for the giveaway !,

  makes me sad that people believe in this shit . 
  hey , i see that you 're a slayer . 
  can you clear me out about some info that i got ? 
  i hear alot of people say that slayer is kind of bad in pvp so i would like to know that before i commit more time to my slayer . 
  i 'm already level 45 . 
  is zerker really that bad ? 
  will level 65 be better for him atleast ? 
  what is the updated info ? 
  wait but what about zerker in pvp , especially duels ? 
  i though they were the worst . 
  thanks for the answer, 
  goddamnit maybe i should continue with my sorc or just make an archer . 
  but i think archer has less mobility and cc than sorcerer . 
  5 am reporting in, 
  i would make an archer . 
  i 'm only concerned about if a warrior catches me and i 'm dead . 
  i feel like sorc can deal with melees better than archer . 
  is this true ? 
  ( thanks for the detailed answer btw ), 
  so you 're saying that slayer is still good ? 
  because other answers :, 
   slayer loses to every other melee class 1v1 . 
  and, 
   reapers shit all over slayers even harder than lancers vs zerkers . 
  / r/oblivion reached 15,000 subscribers recently !, 
  back then the max amount of people online were like ~ 25 and that was a good day , now i 've seen +40 or maybe there was more when i 'm sleeping because timezones and stuff . 
  so nice to see the sub of the game that is probably in my top ~ ~ 5 ~ ~ 3 grow . 
  ofcourse that nothing replaces the first experience where you really explore the game and feel lost . 
  this is for your nostalgia moments . 
  but i enjoyed the most around 2nd-3rd playthrough where i knew what i wanted to do ( be a badass mage ) and was working towards it but i did n't knew much about mechanics and best values so i was always discovering the best weapons/spells/enchantments / potions . 
  now i just play when i forget something and want to relive that experience . 
  but still this game is in my top 3 all time . 
  i do not need it , just wanted to say thanks for the generosity . 
  good luck everyone !, 
  what about the new 65 skills ? 
  slayer will get a sort of like ohs without reset and can double dodge . 
  you think he will become better ? 
  tera has the repetitive grind downside but with other people it 's much more fun . 
  i love seeing good bang for buck builds !, 
  this one is great . 
  alot of builds out there are over $ 1k and their gpu is a 750 ti ... 
  / r/60fpsporn is all you need, 
  glorious linux !, 
  wow level 65 sounds amazing . 
  the reason why i 'm asking this is because i do n't want to spend time with a class that is underpowered in pvp ( idc about pve ) and tera being grindy and repetitive adds up too for my questioning . 
  well yeah but the main point is endgame pvp since the combat is so awesome . 
  no idea if i should stick to my sorc level 55 or slayer 45 . 
  i heard sorc is pretty good in duels which is a big interest of mine . 
  oh and 3v3s, 
   equalized slayers get shat on, 
  this worries me : /, 
  what is that passive ? 
  ohai there !, 
  well that definetly is n't my area haha so yeah . 
  anyway fatness should be considered a problem and not `` be yourself '' advertising bullshit . 
  glorious # !, 
  represent . 
  but i 'm switching to arch soon . 
  i have my father also using crunchbang because his small laptop lags with windows and now it runs smooth as fuck . 
  imo there is no reason whatsoever to add a reaper class : /, 
  wait isnt that a good passive ? 
  you said that slayers suck in equalized, 
  that is why despite on summer sale witcher 2 being at 5 $ on steam and 10 $ on gog , i still bough it on gog because they deserve my money . 
  because ubisoft . 
  ac 2 is the best ac for me . 
  making ac yearly sucks balls . 
  do n't get me wrong i love ubi 's games ( especially the older ones which are prince of persia and `` oldschool '' splinter cell ) . 
  but the way that they treat pc gaming with :, 
  + downgraded graphics ( watch_dogs , far cry 4 on console = ultra high on pc advertise ), 
  * uplay - this shit sucks and doens ' t even fucking work properly, 
  this is why i no longer support ubi, 
  and it comes with a bunch of additional content such as ost , maps and artwork . 
  he forgot to say must be 192 kbps . mp3 file or else the game wont pick it up . 
  people think that i 'm somekind of playboy who gets all the chicks , but this is n't true : /, 
  was gon na to say that . 
  ukraine represent !, 
  that flair . 
  what was it ? 
  it 's [ deleted ] now . 
  the woman is now baptized as ** henrietta !, 
  tizaki why still no implementation ? 
  hey it 's me again . 
  just wanted to ask if i can use this on the modding tutorial since arry is busy at the moment and it could use more information .
