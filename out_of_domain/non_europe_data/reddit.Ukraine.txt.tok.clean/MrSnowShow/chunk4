  oblivion is a great game and i hope you enjoy it as much as i do since 2007 < 3, 
  : do n't get me wrong i love skyrim i play it since it 's release at 11/11/11 but oblivion got it right in terms of quests and integrating you into the world . 
  i do n't have the steam version , but i guess you just need to run obse_loader . exe , it should show a cmd window and then oblivion will lauch . 
  i tried to use the getobseversion command in console and also did n't get any message but obse is working for me so i think it should be fine . 
  was thinking the same ... 
  you need to ask people and guards for rumors or about the city and often they will tell you something abou a quest then you can ask further about it and you will get a quest . 
  but that 's not the only way to get quests , you will get surprise quests i just do n't wan na spoil it  . 
  i play unmodded mage level 47 but with 100 spell absorb because of atronach birthsign , i need to bump up the difficulty because i one shot everything in a 10 ft area . 
  i use the telekinesis bug to restore my magicka . 
  weapons do almost no damage at higher levels especially with higher difficulty, 
  maybe 300 . 
  i remember playing at 2007 on my pentium 4 and with no dedicated gpu . 
  i was using oldblivion and the lowest settings possible , the game would still crash tho when there were alot of characters . 
  armor enchant is useless . 
  i just use 100 % armor for 60 seconds spell and it is more than enough, 
  [ stealth overhaul redux ] ( http://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/31908/ ? ), 
  later in the game weapons deal less damage so this mod makes sneak multiplier higher depending on ur sneak and marksman skill, 
  the way that i played at the end of the main quest was to always look at the ground or else i would crash, 
  if you have 100 spell absorb you can use a telekinesis spell to restore your magicka because it gets absorbed. , thats how i do . 
  typical elder scrolls, 
  next elder scrolls you play on pc right ? 
  why not a desktop ? 
  or you need the mobility ? 
  i have a huge list . 
  but the top thing that i want is ** better leveling system ** . 
  this was a huge issue in oblivion and in skyrim it 's still not perfect . 
  elder scrolls has most enemies level with you , so why the hell if i level my lockpicking skill enemies get stronger ? 
  they should separate combat-helping and non-combat skills . 
  what 's the gpu ? 
  and i 'm just here wondering , who wants to watch a game being played on a filthy peasantbox ? 
  it 's like watching a game being tortured . 
  hah , your processor wo n't matter much for gaming unless it 's terribly outdated it will bottleneck if you have a good gpu . 
  why you just do n't upgrade your desktop ? 
  what 's that armor ? 
  what about gigabyte ? 
  the `` windforce '' word makes me totally want to buy a gigabyte card because it sounds badass , also twinfrozr . 
  about leveling :, 
  * you indeed need to do 10 level ups to get +5 . 
  but , ** minor ** skills also count towards attribute bonus , so in order to get +5 int +5 wil and +5 end - i make an example : you level 10 times any major skill related to wil ( destruction 6 and alteration 4 ) , so you have already +5 wil and there was a messsage saying * you need to rest and meditate bla bla bla * it means that any ** major ** skill that you level will count towards next level ** but ** any ** minor ** skill that you level after that message will still count towards this level 's attribute bonus . 
  so to get +5 int and +5 end you need to have a minor skill related to intelligence and level it 10 times and also level 10 times armorer , heavy armor or block for the +5 end . 
  i personally think that it breaks immersion to do efficient leveling for people that just want to play the game so i downloaded [ all +5 attribute modifiers ] ( http://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/2691/ ? ), 
  so that i can just play the game while getting good bonuses . 
  divines bless your kind heart . 
  hah i did n't even knew there was a steam logo , some event , rog logo evga titan and radeon o :, 
  1366x768 problems, 
  they better upgrade the servers for that day, 
  got my first pc when was 9 years old . 
  before that i played on n64 and later i was playing on ps2 . 
  some years later my parents asked me `` you want a ps3 when it gets cheaper ? '', 
  and i refused because somehow with intuition i knew that pc was better so i just stick with it until now . 
  as long as you understand that pc is objectively superior to consoles in every way possible and keep praising gaben as our god and savior it is okay . 
  just be careful with horrible graphics so that they do n't murder your eyes, 
  just deliver the amulet to jauffre and do n't go to kvatch , so no gates of oblivion until you want . 
  majestic as fuck . 
  based on aesthetics :, 
  ** dagger : ** blade of woe, 
  ** two-handed : ** ebony blade, 
  dragonbone dagger is a bit better because blade of woe has speed of 1 while dragonbone dagger is 1.3 . 
  but still blade of woe is sexy as fuck . 
  ebony blade has an endless enchantment of steal health and is upgradeable . 
  i 'm having the same problem . 
  not crashing alot of times but random crashes when i want to fast travel idk , it is n't gamebreaking since it saves before fast travelling and also sometimes when loading . 
  mods we have in common are :, 
  * unofficial patches, 
  * natural environments, 
  * darnified ui, 
  i 'm pretty sure it was happening before i installed darnified ui so it might be one of those two but i 'm more inclined towards natural environments . 
  got ta test it out when i have time . 
  hey dude i 'm kinda new to reddit how to make it appear like `` 22 | 5 '' instead of total points ? 
  thank you kind sir , reddit is much sexier now . 
  ** warning : ** exposure for more than 30 seconds may cause headache . 
  ^ you 're ^ only ^ immune ^ if ^ you 're ^ a ^ peasant, 
  i got ta try with disabling natural environments, 
  i pirate games that have stupid drm that harm more legit costumers than pirates . 
  you ca n't stop piracy , the more bullshit drm that you put onto a game the more crackers feel like it 's a challenge to them so developers need to stop with this . 
  ( i 'm looking at you ubisoft and you uplay and many more ... ), 
  in a game called fa\u00e7ade if you actualy type in melon you will loose o :, 
  in my day , we used to share bubblegums when they were already in someone 's mouth . 
  ( bubblegums were really rare when i was young ), 
  this looks like low res textures ... 
  i 'm lying . 
  i though it was a tutorial on construction set ... 
  i 've also been in that phase . 
  hell , when i was younger 13-ish i would even use movetoqt on alot of quests , such shame t_t . 
  but even now sometimes i rush a quest but then remind myself that this game is beautiful so i try take my time . 
  i usually see a lets play and get inspired and want to play calmly like them but i do n't know after a while i start to speed up : / wish i was calmer in rpgs, 
  omg i want pigeon simulator to shit on people 's cars !, 
  i sat there for like 5 minutes waiting for it to break . 
  look at that pair of glorious ... cups, 
  this is so annoying .

  [ please use this , this should be the official fps comparison ] ( http://30vs60fps.com ), 
  yes because only one is not enough to remove 74830823 viruses from your pc, 
  based purely on personal preference, 
  ** race : ** dark elf , because they are badass magic rogue type of char . 
  ** playstyle : ** i like mixing magic and stealth , i always need to have sneak at atleast 50 . 
  tried to be a barbarian once with two handed , it 's cool but not my style . 
  i absolutely hate sword and shield .
