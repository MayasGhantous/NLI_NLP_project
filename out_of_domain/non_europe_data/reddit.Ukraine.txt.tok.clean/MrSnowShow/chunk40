  since i install all my mods manually and had no problem for now ( maybe because i 'm no extensive modder ) i have no experience with any mod managers so i ca n't contribute : /, 
  i always refuse to tell `` yes , sir mazoga '', 
  whoa at 75 % it 's pretty hard . 
  here 's a uesp article about it , it 's called [ efficient leveling ] ( http://www.uesp.net/wiki/oblivion:efficient_leveling ), 
   ( funny that that 's the way it 's worked out ... ), 
  not really sure what you 're referencing here , but i 'll assume it was the `` discussion '' between you and arry some weeks ago . 
  while i truly did n't understand how it all started and why , i think you would be a very good addition to help out building nice guidelines for new users . 
  since you have extensive knowledge about how the ( modding subject ? ), 
  mostly and your english is clear and nicely written ( unlike the faq which i wrote myself and it has those things of a non-native speaker that learned through online gaming ) . 
  i remember using [ oldblivion ] ( http://www.uesp.net/wiki/tes4mod:oldblivion ) on my pentium 4 with some intel integrated graphics . 
  all on lowest possible and the game would crash if there was too much action so i had to always look at the floor in order to not crash the game . 
  still played the fuck out of it as a kid . 
  i used to have +95 \u00bac on cpu and +90 \u00bac on gpu and thermal shutdowns after like 30 minutes of playing an intensive game . 
  also the noise was horribly loud , like a fucking airplane about to take off . 
  all of this with the processor working at ** 80 % ** . 
  then i replaced the thermal paste on both cpu and gpu and cleaned the dust , my exhaust on cpu was completly blocked . 
  now i run the same intensive games and my cpu temp maximum was 73\u00bac and almost no noise most of the time . 
  the processor is working at 99 % now , when it was at 80 % the max temp was 71\u00bac . 
  i was about to give up gaming and move full-time to linux because of this and it was n't even enjoyable to use a laptop because my hand would just burn and the noise was too annoying . 
  but now my full-time transition needs to wait while i enjoy the rest of my games without getting a thermal shutdown after 30 minutes . 
   because i do n't agree with the rest of the moderation policies here . 
  could you elaborate on this please ? 
  since i 'm not aware of what really happened and it is in my interest to improve whatever is not the way it should be . 
  good guy / u/mrsnowshow for using the search bar before posting something haha . 
  does it get to point where the bethesda logo appears ? 
  i 've though about this before `` why remove if it gets downvoted and out of sight ? '', 
  but never really discussed it with fellow mods and the amout of those posts has diminuished alot so there is n't much worry about this . 
  but now that i think about it here 's what i have to say responding to, 
   if a thread is unpopular , it 'll sink out of sight on its own, 
  while i agree with `` let the voting speak for itself '' i think it does n't work here , currently there is n't sizable amount of `` posts income '' in / r/oblivion , so there 's little difference between browsing ** hot ** or ** new ** . 
  what this means is that those downvoted posts will be still visible to someone on ** hot ** and will act as a bloat and `` obstruct '' the sub . 
  but now that i think even more about it , ever since there has been a recommended mods page , the amout of `` what are da best mods ? '', 
  has diminuished considerably compared to when there were no active mods . 
  this makes the ocasional `` what are da best mods ? '', 
  post not destructive and bloaty as it used to be back then . 
  hahaha you remember my post ? 
  i quickly went back to the comments and had a good laugh , worth it haha . 
  what is your strategy then ? 
  i see you have a different view of reddit and i respect that . 
  but i want to talk about this :, 
   at least the question and suggestion threads are people who are actually looking for information , and someone else can actually help them by actually providing the information or at least pointing them at it . 
  it accomplishes something, 
  the `` information seeking '' posts are 100 % welcome , but there 's a catch :, 
  the problem is that those `` best mods pls '' posts are the same stuff over and over again . 
  this does not really `` accomplish something '' ( which is something you defend ) and ( returning to my point again ) `` bloats '' the sub as there 's not enough `` post income '' to hide those `` wat r da best mods ? '', 
  posts that only get one answer which is `` there 's a recommended mods page '' . 
  also the only ones that get removed are the ones which are ** very generic ** , like literally `` wat r da best m0ds '' ? . 
  when someone specifies more , for example , `` what are the best mods for a low end computer '' or `` what mods do you guys recommend for a stealth playthrough '' these ones are welcome because they generate discussion and really accomplish something . 
  ( oh and i should preface this saying that it 's mostly my opinion ), 
  and about screenshots , some of them are retarded and unnecessary ( like those `` paint me like 1 of ur french girls '' of someone lying dead on a * sexy * pose ) . 
  but alot of them generate entretainment and make people remember stuff from their playthroughs and share it , others make jokes then one things leads to another and you have a fun discussion going on about , all of this because of a sucessful screenshot . 
  you probably have it in a place where you ca n't modify anything . 
  i think the easiest solution is to just drag the file to your desktop , edit it there , save and move back to the original place . 
  souce : used to do this with the ` hosts ` file in ` c : \\ windows \\ system32 \\ drivers \\ etc `, 
  oblivion 's quests realy are unique and memorable . 
  i 've never done the cure quest myself because i 'm a child of the night and intent to keep it that way forever . 
  get onto a computer with `` a place to insert the disk '' , simply copy all the files from the cd to an usb flash drive and just install on your new computer through it . 
  hey , i 'm currently using a spell with all 3 elements damage and before using that i cast my weakness spell to all 3 elements . 
  but now i 'm wondering , will my damage boost even more if i also add a 4th effect as `` weakness to magicka '' ? 
  because i did n't know this effect existed until now . 
  for the texture pack : yes , you need all 11 parts . 
  and for bigger cities i do not know , there 's no install guide on the mod 's description . 
  i suggest to download all 3 files and see if there 's any documentation on what 's needed and whatnot . 
  i love the fact that the hero of kvatch is the most powerful between dragonborn and nerevarine because [ major si spoiler ] ( #s `` you become fucking sheogorath himself ! '' ), 
  hahaha that 's hilarious !, 
  i need to see this ingame . 
  bethesda motto :, 
  we make 50 % of the game and let the modders take care of the rest . 
  oh right , i totally forgot about the art of oblivion 's menus . 
  i really like them colors . 
  and what about both 100 % wtm and 100 % wtshock on the ** same ** spell ? 
  will it still get 40 pts ? 
  i tested having both weakness and damage at the same spell and it did n't work out . 
  but using 3 elements weakness + 3 elements damage works out . 
  i now want to test if 3 elements weakness and weakness to magicka + 3 elements damage actually do more damage . 
  oh i did n't know that , not much of a role player so i 'll just do it anyway and put the potion on a special place . 
  i 'm still only level 17 and my xp halfway to 18 . 
  almost done with the tutorial !, 
  r9 290 is definetly a much better choice than a 770 4gb . 
  have fun !, 
  oh and i forgot the first question , here it is : [ obge ] ( http://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/30054/ ? ), 
   i cant seem to download an enb mod, 
  how you `` ca n't '' download an enb mod ? 
  what is the problem ? 
  ** i think ** enbs and obge are n't compatible though ... 
  it 's weird , because there are people with families and stuff who are probably more hardcore gamers than us now . 
  windforce 770 ( op 's card ) - $ 349.99, 
  windforce r9 290 - $ 379.99, 
  it 's just $ 30 more and you 'll get much more performance . 
  i read *** everything *** more than 5 times ... aaaand i 'm doing it again now . 
  with that money you could have gotten much better performance with a r9 280x ( but has 3 gb of gddr5 , but it 's perfectly fine for a single 1080p monitor ) . 
  that 's not how gpus work ... 
  clock speed and vram are two very different things . 
  all hail the linux master race !, 
  i think you should make the background transparent . 
  well i said about the transparent because it seems to be transparent on current one . 
  also i hate to say this but mods did n't use alot of suggested cool things ( that i saw ) . 
  for example , [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/2cay31/suggestion_make_the_self_posts_thumbnail_look/ ) , and also another one where a guy made a much cooler snoo ( the reddit alien ) and it had +2000 upvotes and mods still did n't add it . 
  why / u/tizaki ? 
  the gold speaks for itself .
