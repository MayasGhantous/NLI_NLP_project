  my sorc is 33 o : but i 'll just create a new one because zerker is my love . 
  funny thing is some time ago i was dueling an archer and he won vs me like 5 duels straight with 80 % hp left . 
  then after that i won like 5-10 straight because i adapted to his playstyle and also had like 80 % hp left . 
  ( but this was maybe level 50 so it 's different ), 
   when you use moves like bloodlust or inescapable doom , the match will be over soon after, 
  reminds me of [ this awesome clip ] ( http://youtu.be/bq_gtlrdaq0?t=1m ) . 
  anyway thanks for the detailed answers this definetly encouraged me to roll zerker . 
  what class r u playing ? 
  onli 5 dollers a moth totely wort it . 
  pc fagz hav 4 fri cuz no1 wud buy dat shet . 
  why the hell do n't you add stuff that people suggest ? 
  where 's the new self post icon ? 
  where 's the improved `` glorious pc master race bla bla bla '' without any jpeg artifacts ? 
  where 's the new snoo that was posted very long ago and is much better than the current one . 
  i use nano what exactly is wrapping ? 
  use a \\ before #, 
  \\ #vimmasterrace, 
  can someone explain me what the standoffs do ? 
  oh so those standoffs have like a `` platform '' where the mobo is placed and does n't touch the case right ? 
  * sigh , are we really doing this again and not even in / r/skyrim ? 
  too bad we ca n't build laptops yet . 
  when i grow up this will be my business !, 
  * travelling *, 
  ooh a nightshade !, 
  * picks it up *, 
  i have a strange love for nightshades . 
  i 'm not sure but / u/bobcrosswire knows this . 
  $ 1 = 1 $ is so painful : /, 
  budget builds are the most interesting to look at !, 
  pcmr is my main sub . 
  it has amazing helpful people . 
  ** ] ( #s `` i did the quest fighting the altered pet and all the fight was wondering `` lol jack forgot explosive when its going to be ? '', 
  and then i realise it 1 second before *** that *** happens ! '' ), 
  wow what a fucking asshole that jack is ) :, 
  edit : used the spoiler code , was on phone at that moment so i did n't knew about it . 
  exactly , because currently they ca n't be self built and good laptops overheat quickly . 
  that 's why i want to change it haha . 
  that 's a daedric quest from ( my personal favorite ) sanguine . 
  you can use mods if it bothers you to unplayable condition . 
  i was on phone when i wrote it so i totally forgot there 's a spoiler tag . 
  i play an atronach mage . 
  * you can use welkynd stones . 
  * alchemy potions, 
  * or you can use a glitch/exploit :, 
  first get 100 absorbtion with sorcerer 's ring and spelldrinker amulet . 
  now the glitch/exploit what i talked about is that you absorb your own telekinesis and restore magicka this way . 
  you will need to experiment with different values to get the right magnitude . 
  it 's because you will restore 4x ( i think ) the spell 's cost , but will never have full magicka because you max magicka will be ` max - spell 's cost ` ( example : if your max magicka is 650 and the telekinesis spell costs 60 then your maximum magicka that you can restore with that spell is 650-60 = ** 590 ** . 
  so if go with a high magnitude you will restore alot but also have a big gap , but if you go too low the gap will be lower but it will also take more casts to restore your magicka pool . 
  just try around and you 'll understand what i 'm talking about . 
  [ here 's a pic of my character , take a look at the magicka pool ] ( http://i.imgur.com/85obftt.jpg ), 
  ( do n't forget to hold block when casting spells so the animation will be shorter ), 
  edit : since your max magicka will be capped as ** max ** * minus * ** telekinesis ' spell cost ** , the ideal setup for me is making the telekinesis spell in a way that in two casts i get my maximum magicka possible restored . 
  i just used [ all +5 attribute modifiers ] ( http://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/2691/ ? ) . 
  since what i wanted from this playthrough is to get the nostalgia feeling and just play for the story rather than having a pen and paper and trying to level efficiently . 
  what happened to phonebloks ? 
  i 've posted this question a few days ago, 
  [ take a look here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/teraonline/comments/2cz98o/the_berserker_pvp/ ), 
  his profile pic shows exactly who is he . 
   $ 60 a month, 
  this is n't true . 
  it 's per year . 
  na or eu launcher ? 
  i get * that * laugh everytime i see 792p . 
  seriously what a joke this xboner is , and people still buy it somehow o_0 . 
  interesting ... 
  i come to / r/buildapc and skip all build complete and only go for build help and ready , because i want people to get best performance possible with their budget . 
  and also do n't really enjoy the very expensive builds . 
  i get more enjoyment helping out a $ 500 budget builder get the best machine . 
  feels very rewarding imo . 
  that one is great . 
  do you have a microcenter nearby ? 
  because there you can get a good deal on a cpu + mobo combo . 
  that build is good because it has a cheap 4th gen processor which means that you wo n't need to replace your motherboard when you want to update . 
  so do n't get the apu from your original build . 
  good gpu choice but why locked cpu and a aftermarket cooler ? 
  also there are cheaper mobos . 
  the second build op look at it !, 
  that one is good . 
  ~ ~ i ca n't check right now since i 'm on phone but i think the i5 4670 is 3.4 ghz and just a few dollars more . ~ ~, 
  3k-4k builds ? 
  not to be rude but you seem like having the `` pcs r expensive '' mindset even after building one which is very surprising for me . 
  rtorrent ? 
  is it gui ? 
  ubuntu and simplicity ? 
  no way dude are you serious ? 
  no no no !, 
  do n't get the asus version . 
  it 's cooler is badly designed for this card . 
  you 're right , that mobo is for ocing . 
  you 'll save money by buying a h mobo instead of z. 
  as for the rest , it 's more of your personal choice if you want to get a cheaper ssd , case or cpu ( i5 4440 is 3.1 ghz and costs maybe $ 20 less ) to save more money . 
  what are your temps ? 
  do n't listen to your friends . 
  the less people know , the more opinions they got . 
  red team is good . 
  sapphite is sexy and pretty good which is what matters . 
  i do n't know where you read about overheating , probably about reference cards . 
  not bad o :, 
  whoa a 8800gt !,
