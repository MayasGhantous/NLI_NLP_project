  well but ymd is just dmy inverted , still a logical triangle . 
  once you 've insulted then you 've automatically lost the argument . 
  til length = capacity, 
  oh ty for explaining a non native speaker ( :, 
  this is why despite all the hate i still browse this sub . 
  what the actual fuck . 
  please get yourself informed :, 
  cm is length and can not have relation with capacity . 
  but cm ^ 3 is volume and it relates to capacity ( litres ) . 
  so 1 cm ^ 3 = 1ml and 1dm ^ 3 = 1l, 
  is it really necessary to create an account ? 
  which is at what clock rate ? 
  bizkit is right here !, 
  people in the house throw your hdds to the air, 
  thanks for doing this op, 
  terraria for me please, 
  well that 's a shitty advice . 
  but could work . 
  yes !, 
  electricity and water are best friends forever . 
  hey _ vargas _ what is your story ? 
  i always saw / u / _ vargas _ comments and you have a shitload of karma but i do n't know the background for this : /, 
  maybe put in it in sidebar too ? 
   vergas, 
  r u serious ? 
  i do n't get his joke : /, 
  is asking for username bad because people read all your posts ? 
  yes , oblivion ( and pretty much elder scrolls ) is n't like traditional leveling games where moar lvl = better . 
  the only motivation to level is to have better loot and rewards . 
  shrek is love , shrek is life . 
  go sli and make girlfriend play on integrated . 
  gaming , programming and general pc stuff ( chat , browse reddit , etc ), 
  equal or less than 1000 $, 
  above 20 inch, 
  good bang for buck, 
  y u no res ? 
  atleast he is n't retarded enough to say, 
  i have two nvidias 7970 ti gaming sli edition in crossfire, 
  deluge master race here . 
  damnit it 's in pounds , i need equal or less than 1000 euros or dollars since $ 1 = 1 $ in this area . 
  came here to say this . 
  270x is the best < 200 $ card . 
  make out with my crush . 
  my mind was blown . 
  only thing i disagree is the expensive z mobo with a locked processor . 
  you could save like $ 70 by going cheaper h mobo and go for a r9 290 gpu, 
  well i guess it 's time to find a good open souce program to do the job that skype does . 
  too bad that evga does n't make amd cards . 
  nope . 
  requires servers , i prefer mumble or raidcall, 
  rip / u/c _ stat :(, 
  check the sidebar . 
  it 's the first step to do when you get into a new sub . 
  thank you and have a nice day . 
  the build is fine with a h mobo , but i would still make some more personal ajustments :, 
  i would see if it 's worth going with the same processor but slightly lower clock speeds 3.1 or 3.2 and save a lil bit of money . 
  ram is a bit expensive , i would search something around $ 60 - $ 70 if i can . 
  have trust issues with seagate so i would go for wd . 
  gpu would be a r9 290 because it 's an absolute beast of a card and it would be a crime to not get it . 
  case a bit on the expensive side , would search for one for $ 40 - $ 50, 
  maybe get a higher wattage psu, 
  so it would be something like this :,

  check the [ recommended mods ] ( http://reddit.com/r/oblivion/wiki/index/mods ), 
  i play in first person , but often switch to third person just to take a look at my badass character . 
  you can read about what are the bonuses and negatives of each race [ here , it 's from uesp ] ( http://www.uesp.net/wiki/oblivion:races ), 
  when choosing a race you 're first need to decide on your playstyle ( to make it simple ) : warrior , mage or assassin/thief/sneakydude / whatever . 
  after you 've decided , you better pick the race which has the best bonuses corresponding to your playstyle . 
  example : if you want to go mage , then you 'd better pick breton or altmer because of their magicka pool boost and basically bonuses in most of the magic skills . 
  it is not necessary to do this though , if you really want to make that orc mage then do it , but he will be a bit worse than an altmer or breton . 
  sorry for complete unrelated reply but i remember your flair `` it 's you , hi '' back then when new moderators stepped it . 
  just wanted to let you know you can now select `` pretty pictures '' ( and still write text ) as someone else said in that thread . 
  as for morrowind , i feel ashamed to admit that i could n't immerse myself into it no matter how hard i tried . 
  but i believe this is more of a personal problem since like for over 6 months that i have n't been able to play extensively any game like i used to do back then . 
  just waiting now for that gaming feeling to come back so i can enjoy games again : /, 
  what ? 
  oh thanks for the advice :d, 
  problem is that i 'm probably not building anytime soon . 
  i have one last year of school before i go to ( probably ) university . 
  i will have next to none time to spend with a pc so it seems a waste to build one right now as when later when i finish studies the technology will advance more and with the same money i maybe get rig capable of 4k and more advanced stuff . 
  well i did n't downvote it i just found your grammar weird and was n't sure what you really meant . 
  after the 3rd one it lost it 's original purpose which was street racing and now it 's more of an action movie . 
  i though new yellow weapons were upgrades so i though i would get raped . 
  but then i learned that they 're sidegrades and started playing non stop . 
  nope i think, 
  i also have my own private isp which costed me additional $ 192491287319, 
  am i worthy ? 
  same , the script is so awesome and i sometimes loose it due to combat distraction : /,
