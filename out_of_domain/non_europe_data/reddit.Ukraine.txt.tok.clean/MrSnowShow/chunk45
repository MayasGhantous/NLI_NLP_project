  remember to flair you submission with the red cross so others can use the filter if they have the same problem and hopefully someone helps you . 
  also sorry for asking but did you tried reinstalling it ? 
  i really ca n't help you since i 've never installed it :(, 
  your flair ... are you running it on linux or osx ? 
  distro ? 
  well atleast it is n't unity haha . 
  blockhead is actually an obse plugin and not a normal mod . 
  you need to put blockhead files onto ` / data/obse/plugins ` and launch the game with obse ofcourse . 
  yes . 
  well i think it 's because of how samsung treats android . 
  ironically firefox was the one that started with the addon stuff . 
  and i also like how it 's open-source despite not knowing how to code in most languages and not contributing ( yet ) to the project . 
  i like open-source in general hence my flair \\ ^ ^, 
  this is what i 'm doing with my zerker now . 
  i read all story quests to atleast feel a purpose for the braindead grindfest . 
  fraya is hot , kaidun is ... t_t , samael is a faggot , elleon is a badass haha i can wear `` lore addict '' proudly . 
  same with berserker . 
  little girl with huge axe charging at you is fucking awesome . 
   no amount of practice or skill will save you from an equally skilled ranged player in 1v1 . 
  is this really true ? 
  it 's because i 'm on a quest to become the best zerker in killian, 
  just go to cr 's location ingame . 
  reddit has a 500kb limit for images , yours is ~ 600kb . 
  just wanted to let you know that we have more flairs as requested . 
  so far we have : factions , attributes , skills and cities, 
  also if you have any feedback about subreddit 's stylesheet make sure to let know . 
  then you have n't seen / r/teslore haha . 
  that one is top notch . 
  r9 270x on a $ 900 build ? 
  hell no , you can go as far as r9 290 with that budget . 
  [ oblivion start guide ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvb4zwq4ra ), 
  this generic question gets asked alot . 
  a `` new '' pc with a 600 series gpu ? 
  i guess you bought a prebuilt . 
  anyway , i have [ this to show you ] ( http://i.imgur.com/nbz5879.png ), 
  well that 's why it 's not recommended for oblivion . 
  oblivion mod manager and wrye bash are much better . 
  i personally do n't use any of those and still works fine with like 20 mods and most of them are gameplay streamline/fixes . 
  oh i see you tried to compare to alienware . 
  allrighty then !, 
  what the hell ? 
  i 'm pretty sure it runs games on intel 's graphics . 
  also why ? 
  this is actually one big complain about elder scroll series is that supposedly big battles are very small . 
  even m'aiq references that in skyrim : * `` m'aiq hears many stories of war ... yet few of them are true . 
  and of course general improvments that should be expected for a newer game such as graphics , physics ( still retarded * cough * giants * cough * but bodies do n't fly around in slow motion anymore ) . 
  stealth and melee were improved and are actually effective lategame unlike oblivion with a ~ 28 damage cap on weapon + enchantments and this combined with retarded monsters leveling makes melee take forever to kill somebody . 
  magic was downgraded , despite having cool looking effects and shit it sucks balls compared to oblivion . 
  rip spellmaking and actual diversity in spells ( looking at you conjuration !, 
  in vanilla game you had 3 atronach a dremora and a fucking familiar . 
  5 summons ! ), 
  `` they say syndicates of wizards have led a boycott of imperial goods in the land of the altmer . '', 
  i assumed you had a new pc and new pcs do n't really come with graphics on motherboard . 
  punchcat in oblivion !, 
  well that is motherboard graphics . 
  what is your other gpu then ? 
  i mean the stylesheet \\ ^ ^, 
  i see you 're not much of a computers guy . 
  i guess you do n't really have any other gpu than the motherboard integrated one . 
  oh good choice !, 
  it 's okay , also what app do you use ? 
  reddit is fun ( the one i use ) has a button for the sidebar . 
   i 've beat skyrim 10 times now, 
  you do not simply `` beat '' an elder scrolls game . 
  atleast they still do in gpu departament . 
  and i 'm confident they would still do that with fx cpus if they actually r&d to compete with intel . 
  competition is the best for the costumer . 
  2 factions that hate each other and pvp oriented ( sort of like aion ) with cool dungeons and raids for the hardcore players . 
  also targeting system . 
  kant c moar dan 792p anywei, 
  i had 1st ratchet and clank on a demo disk . 
  not sure about ratchet and clank 2 , but the 3rd one i beat it over 10 times because there is an option to restart the game with all your shit unlocked ( challenge mode ? ) . 
  every single game that has upgrades system should have the option to replay it with all upgrades you had . 
  atleast for me it boosts the replayability by alot . 
  for example if dishonored had this feature i would play the fuck out of it instead of only 2 times . 
  because starting all over again with no cool powers/weapons and only unlock them when the game is almost over sucks , and thinking about collecting all those runes and stuff again really kills it for me . 
  and what i like too in oblivion is how despite the spell casting animations/effects are `` shittier '' than in skyrim , i like how in oblivion they synergize better with your weapon . 
  this makes playing two-handed/archer mages really nice and smooth unlike skyrim where weapon switches ( since you must `` wield '' a spell like a weapon ) are too clumsy and slow to make playing archer/two-handed mage enjoyable . 
  okay let 's take the thieves guild in skyrim . 
  so you 're the guildmaster , done like 50 little jobs ( from vex and delvin ) completed the quest line , made the raggen flagon rich and full of energy . 
  ** now where 's the fucking credit ? 
  seriously , only delvin says at the last special job you do for him that you 're `` the best damn thief that i 've ever seen '' and that 's pretty much it ( oh and he calls you `` boss '' sometimes ) . 
  vex , dirge and others still treat you like shit and no comments about how you almost single handedly put the guild back on it 's feet and vekel still goes like `` so you 're brynjolf 's new protege eh . . '' are you fucking serious ? 
  there are more examples but i ca n't remember them at the moment . 
  i did not-so-recently a 10000 characters rant about what is wrong in skyrim but i ca n't find it ( forgot to save ) . 
  but pretty much -- oh i remembered one more !, 
  fucking vampires dlc , seriously at the end of questline ( atleast in vampires side , only played that one ) all the npcs do n't recognize your superiority and still treat you like shit just as the first time you walked in there . 
  `` do n't come close to me or i 'll rip your arms off '' . 
  are you fucking serious dude ? 
  i killed bunch of motherfuckers including your [ dawnguard spoiler ] ( #s `` fucking leader '' ) and you say that shit to me ? 
  come on ... it 's total dissapointment every single time i walk into caste volkihar . 
  for the sidebar , just change the hex value . 
  . side , . titlebox form.toggle , . leavemoderator , . icon-menu a , . side . spacer, 
  background-color : # 696969 ;, 
  and for the circular borders around posts , i do n't see any at / r/reddithax but the code is ` border-radius : 20px ; ` ( or whatever amount of * x * px you want , the bigger the value the more roundness the border will have ) but first you need to create a ` border `, 
  so it could go like this, 
  . link {, 
  hello again !, 
  sorry to bother once more but i have a question about pve . 
  so at the moment i 'm level 51 and i 've done golden labyrinth and there 's this archer ( level 50 ) saying that he 's doing over 150k sometimes of damage from radiant arrow while me with thunderstrike total max was 110k while having fiery rage cast ( this is all crits and full overcharge and from the back ) my normal damages are like 70-80k and with cyclone ( +12 % oc damage glyph ) each hit did like 23k absolute max with fiery rage , normal cyclone damages were around 18 ~ 20ish .
