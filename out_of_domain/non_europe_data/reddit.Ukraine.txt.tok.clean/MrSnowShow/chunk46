  we both had level 50 +9 avatar weapon , he had some crystals and i none and his ilvl was 112 while mine was 109 . 
  i asked him what was the base damage of radiant arrow and he said 1614 ( ? ), 
  while my thunder strike had 1880 base damage . 
  thing is i always though zerker was the pve king top dps , so am i wrong or is it the ilvl difference maybe doing that or maybe is he lying ? 
  or this changes at level 60 ? 
  i was hoping you could clear this up since you 've played both classes till 60 . 
  i think the biggest feature of tera is it 's ** combat ** . 
  i also enjoy travelling to different locations and roleplaying it and reading the main quest 's plot . 
  also i really love instances and playing in group , it 's much more fun , even with random strangers . 
  and it all goes back to combat because it is very fun to fight that boss with a group of people . 
  combat feels very rewarding because you use more your `` skill '' rather than targeting a mob and then having a set rotation . 
  fighting that boss is a very dynamic activity , you need to be constantly adapting and reacting to him . 
  well i guess then i 'm okay . 
  because it would be retarded for a ranged class that already has the range advantage be having harder hitting abilites than a melee who puts himself in a higher risk . 
  linux is n't an os dude . 
  i walked for 3 km with my gf to her house . 
  we also took sandwiches for our `` journey '' xd . 
  wow this is great for me ( so hyped for 60 i 'm 52 at the moment ) . 
  i always though it would be very confusing because i 've heard so much about gear sets ( some names i recall : conjunct , fraywind , visionmaker , steadfast , strikeforce , bloodrave ( ? ) ... ), 
  i guess they 're just legacy sets now since they do n't appear at your guide . 
  but can someone give me a backstory for those ? 
  so i guess archetype ( pve ) and advantage ( pvp ) are the ones that need 400 ( ? ), 
  crafting skill and are the `` vm '' series , vm3 . 
  oportune/favoured ( both pvp , what is the difference ? ), 
  and devastator ( pve ) are the ones like strikeforce where 0 crafting is needed right ? 
  also what happens to wonderholme ? ... 
  i do n't see people talking about that instance anymore , is it now useless ? 
  so i need opportune to make favored ? 
  also what is the strikeforce pve equivalent now ( a pve set that needs no crafting is what i mean ) ? 
  whoa s4 league . 
  i miss that game so much . 
  i started playing on season 1 dark lightning and stopped once they remade the ui and removed the fucking lobby !, 
  t_t rip, 
  fucking amazing game . 
  tera `` spoils '' you with it 's ( awesome ) combat and makes all other mmos that use tab targeting be extremely boring . 
  whoa replying to 2 month comment haha, 
  also i saw today a `` patron '' weapon , you did n't mention it in the guide . 
  what the hell dude ... oh username . 
  but does it need 400 crafting or 0 ? 
  last question : do i need to enchant each set to +9 or even +12 as i 'm making my way for vm3 ? 
  i read it as euro 40.000, 
   oblivion ( and most of their games ), 
  just wanted to clarify that the series are called * the elder scrolls * and oblivion is the 4 ^ th game of the series . 
  * the elder scrolls iv - oblivion * . 
   i ca n't imagine a bettwer way to close a generation of gaming . 
  why would close a `` generation '' of gaming ? 
  2.5 more questions ( you 're doomed with me \\ ^ \\ ^ ), 
  what about oculus ? 
  do i need to enchant it so i can run rift 's edge nm and hm ? 
  if there 's archetype which is above devastator , then why i do n't get archetype and only then spend a shitload of money to get it to +12 ? 
  is archetype so hard to get that most people do n't bother with it and just go +12 on deva ? 
  what is the vm3 .5 weapon ? 
  i can not find it in your guide . 
   also extra overcharge does not carry over on evasive . 
  charge till red bar glows , then dodge roll . 
  do you have a sauce on this ? 
  what box are you talking about ? 
  oh i also won a battle ready snow tiger some weeks ago on my 2 ^ nd try :d, 
  true , ( currently level 55 , again ) i refuse using any powerlevelling so i can be on par and enjoy all areas , instances and the ** story ** questlines which i read all of the dialogue ( lore addict ) . 
  level 55 \\ ^ ^, 
  companies need to realise that this feature `` playing the game again with all your upgrades '' increases replayability by alot because the game is much more fun that way and people like me and you just replay over and over and over again . 
  well you just typed it in a sense that i 've seen other people saying `` oblivion 2 : skyrim '' and other abominations like that . 
  too bad this `` next '' gen consoles do n't have any backwards compability and somehow costumers accept it , i do n't know how they manage to do it . 
  sometimes i want to go all the way back to 90s and i can do it , anytime on the same platform . 
  get acess to a computer with an optical drive : some older pc you have , your friends , etc. . . 
  browse the disk and copy all files to an usb, 
  copy from usb to your new rig, 
  ( optional , and i 'm thinking in theory ) - if there are problems with `` insert next disk '' and somehow it does n't work then create . iso files for both cds and use something like virtual clonedrive , daemon tools , alcohol 52 % , etc. . to mount and install like a normal cd . 
  not here !, 
  meet me behind the chapel at midnight !, 
  make a mess out of your first character and fuck everything up . 
  it 's part of the experience, 
  ( that 's what i did with my first character ), 
  can confirm this bcuz of suzamia . 
   from a mathematical standpoint there are two possible outcomes : not masterwork and masterwork, 
  now add there a superposition state and we 're talking about quantum mechanics . 
  ( but in all seriousness how is that from a mathematical standpoint ? ), 
  well noble in my server costs 40k-50k while mes cost 300g, 
  from maths we gather that x100 mes give a 95 % of masterworking so cost is 300g x 100 = 30k . 
  better go mes unless you feel like rng gods gon na troll you . 
  oh god do n't even get me started on the retarded business practices in gaming industry . 
  and the most disturbing thing is that most people simply bend over and take it in the ass like a fucking whore instead of fighting back and demanding quality content . 
  toothless being now a / r/pcmasterrace personality , made me remember and now i 'm wondering what happened to / u/dmz _ dragon ? 
  do u know anything ? 
  this is 280x or 270x ? 
  or no x ? 
  wow that 's fucking amazing . 
  hopefully it will run fine just as if you 've bough it retail . 
  whoa , i guess you just did n't spend enough time with oblivion because one of my personal complaints about skyrim is how the world feels `` dead '' and uninteresting as opposed to oblivion which is really magical , immersive and interesting . 
  and the soundtrack is alot better to get that medieval fantasy world feeling that in skyrim i can not find after 300 hours . 
  edit ( add more shit ) :, 
  when i play oblivion i feel in a ( once again ) magical fantasy world and i expect always some crazy stuff to happen since there are legends , curses and other magical stuff , the sountrack really compliments this and even that `` bling '' sound effect of the quest journal updating is very exciting for me , and it is in written in 1st person so i can roleplay better , unlike skyrim . 
  now with skyrim i can not feel any `` fantasy '' atmosphere and i guess the game is n't just as magical as oblivion . 
  and i ca n't even remenber any soundtrack while i 'm in town or travelling . 
  why ? 
  where can i get that box ? 
  he left because of `` fights '' ? 
  this is something i do n't understand , a game comes out of nowhere and suddenly it 's the best game out there . 
  same shit with titanfall . 
  i guess it 's just brute force marketing that make the game look amazing so retarded peasants go buy the console to play that game .
