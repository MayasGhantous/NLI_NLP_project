  or maybe i just do n't accompany the gaming news too much and i 'm missing something . 
  yep , cell is a fucking bitch . 
  spacebar, 
  there are alternate leveling methoods but are you a first time player ? 
  for first timers i think despite being boring ( especially alone ) you should do all quest to get the feeling for the world and get to know all areas . 
  a piece of advice that works for me is to read all main ( red ) quest 's dialogue and watch all cinematic related to it . 
  gives me a purpose to be doing what i 'm told . 
  but in all honesty i 'm level 56 now and in tera leveling to end game is pretty quick than most mmos . 
  is n't that a berserker ? 
  even though both have high skill caps , an average zerker is bad and average warrior is good . 
  average warriors can simply backstab and press spacebar 5 times . 
  now average zerkers do not have any skill that guarantees them free damage so they will miss stuff/get kited/die . 
  to have a chance as zerker you must play close to perfect because your good cc has long cd ( fear , inescapable doom ) so you ca n't afford to make mistakes . 
  the big fucking plot twist on the dark brotherhood questline . 
  is that oco 1 or 2 ? 
  honestly he looks much better vanilla , same with owyn vs oco2 owyn . 
  yes i only realised after replying that you were talking about pve . 
  but i would n't say zerker is easy to pve because atleast in moving bosses , as a zerker you need to commit several seconds to dish out those big numbers . 
  but the boss might run around or aoe and interrupt you and you 'll loose on alot of dps since you need to commit several seconds again . 
  unlike all other classes where they just keep their rotation and if they miss 1 or 2 spells it is n't a huge deal . 
  sorry to tell you but you got kind of ripped off ( unless you paid a low price ) . 
  most prebuilts * cough * alienware * cough * come with unnecessary i7 , shitload of ram and then a $ 50 graphics card that runs games like crap . 
  and they charge you for a fuckton of money despite the machine sucking hard for gaming . 
  ( example : take a look at [ this `` extreme gaming '' machine ] ( http://www.dell.com/us/p/alienware-x51-r2/pd?oc=dpcwxy05s&amp;model_id=alienware-x51-r2 ) . 
  look at it 's specs , a top processor that is unnecessary for gaming and a 760 gpu . 
  [ the gtx 760 costs $ 200 !!, 
  ] ( http://pcpartpicker.com/part/pny-video-card-vcggtx7602xpb ) and they 're charging $ 1600 for that `` gaming '' desktop . ), 
  a proper self build rig with a gtx 760 costs as little as $ 600 if not less if you really try and save money on other parts . 
  oh and ... 
   quad core i7 with 3.40 mhz, 
  it 's ghz not mhz . 
  / r/buildapc is your friend \\ ^ ^ good luck . 
  you 're talking like someone is forcing you to install all those mods and you just ca n't play the vanilla version . 
  oh god what is this abomination . 
  todd howard in an interview after saying that [ pc is the best to play skyrim ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0mpuiyjkui&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=19m15s ) said that they will focus on pc next . 
  hopefully this is true since last two games held pc back . 
  i hope for :, 
  + pc specific ui, 
  + high res textures, 
  + bigger draw distance, 
  + take advantage of multiple cores, 
  + wide range of resolutions support ( 21:9 16:10 etc. . . ), 
  + high fps support ( skyrim goes all crazy once fps goes way too high ), 
  + more hotkeys ( seriously , we have a fucking keyboard with a shitload of buttons ), 
  you 're a liar !, 
  you do n't even look like a count . 
  i really like how he says the last part with heavy emphasis on `` standing ** here !, 
  ** next to ** me !, 
  there are stages in leveling ( like yours ) that bams are harder to kill than what you 've used to . 
  this happens whenever you 're near to receiving a new avatar weapon ( in you case it 's level 38 , so you 're 1 level away . 
  i 'm pretty sure you 're still rolling a lvl 32 avatar weap ) . 
  i 've noticed this on my zerker too because i would n't block the full damage . 
  it is still possible to solo but you need to sharpen your skills . 
  but what i suggest is either find another people that need the same bam and do the quest with them or just leave it for now and once you get your 38 weapon , go back and kill them easily . 
  i actually never though about * that * plot twist . 
  i was thinking about the one `` no !, 
  noooo !, 
  what have you done ?! '', 
  oh and about that twist , too bad that khajiit only likes us [ spoiler ] ( #s `` when it 's too late '' ) . 
  i would make the blade of woe or ebony dagger , defintetly more classy in my opinion . 
  but nice work though . 
  ~ ~ god ~ ~ akatosh bless ` tfc `, 
  yep i them titles be like, 
  `` tifu by sexing my sex for sex and sex ** nsfw ** '', 
  well no shit . 
  yep !, 
  my acoustic guitar is on a stand always avaliable and ready to play while my electric is on the bag ( dont have stand ) and my amp is far from pc so i need to move it . 
  now since i 'm a fucking lazy piece of shit i 'm only playing on acoustic , even doing solos on 15 ^ th fret . 
  but doing solos in acoustic is actually good because when you pick up the electric it 's much more easier . 
  a formatting tip : use doube space to create a new paragraph . 
  have you tried tera ? 
  yep , tera really spoils you with the combat . 
  once you go manual aim you never go back . 
  going back to tab targeting games : `` wtf is this shit so boring omg how can someone play this which requires next to none brainpower i should use this game when i ca n't fall asleep it 'll work like a charm ! '', 
  as a zerker i love this, 
  * leaping strike : animation lock can now be cancelled through blocking, 
  also big buff on archer breakaway bolt 20s --  10s is very good for pvp . 
  and ofcourse mystic buff makes me want to play a healing class since priest just is n't for me . 
  what about pvp ? 
  wow i 've only spent only 706 hours . 
  all my friends are above 2k and still in bronze/silver . 
  even in pve it will make gameplay smoother , animation locks in general suck . 
  this is why i do n't trust seagate , too many stories have i heard . 
  the guy right before going to the block and getting his head chopped off :, 
  `` come on !, 
  i have n't got all morning ! '', 
  adventure update 1.8 ( beta ) ruined it for me . 
  here 's the peasantry formula, 
  ` we do not need more than [ insert your desired pleb machine specs ] because humans can not apreciate more `, 
  would you mind telling which ones ? 
  remember to flair your submission so people with similar problems can find it easily . 
   sorc is ... probably last  .  ... 
  the only class they might be better than is slayer imo . 
  what the fuck are you talking about ? 
  sorc is very good has alot of escapes cc and can pretty much 100-0 if you do your combo right . 
  here in killian eu server , a sorc called flanberry is always 100 % win rate on 3v3 with scores like 35/0/27, 
  it 's not just an `` internet ad '' , it 's work of the legendary 4chan . 
  well if we talking about 1v1s i 'd say pretty much all melee classes and slayer zerker the most . 
  simply because of the amount of stuff a sorc can do to melees . 
  flaming barrage hits like a truck , you got mana eating skill , got silence , time gyre , glacial massibe slow , got easy dot , can camp in 2 traps and hailstorm and u got mana barrier .
