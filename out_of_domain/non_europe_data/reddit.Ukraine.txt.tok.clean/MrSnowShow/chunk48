  and i did the opposite of you , killed that little bosmer bastart - glarthir !, 
  hes 1297 - 11 ^ th place . 
  maximum rank is 1409 by a priest .

  can someone explain me why there are no 800 series ? 
  or are 800 series for laptops ? 
  yep i also received like 250g , then some other time 500g , also 100g . 
  and last time ( that i remember ) i was in a duel with a level 60 zerker learning some zerker pvp tricks ( was level 38 ) and in tera if you do a blow that deals more damage than enemies ' hp then they will die in a duel . 
  so i res 'd and then told him jokingly `` gim me 1 gold because i wasted it on the healing npc '' and he proceeds to give me 1000g :d, 
  that reminds me of my first `` rich '' reaction that i had when i was around level 34 and i was trying to sell extensive alkahests that i got from supply box ( good old days ) and he paid me like 250g x 20 = 5000g !, 
  i was so happy and though i did n't need any more money and could finally buy that 50g yellow quality weapon ( no avatars back then ) . 
  do n't want to be negative nate but pretty much every korean mmo is better in na than eu . 
  i do kinda agree with you , we see, 
  * serana res useless animal, 
  * ice spike on head, 
  * arrow on head, 
  * note for delvin, 
  * note from romeo and juliet reference, 
  * fancy death position, 
  and some other common stuff that i ca n't remember at the moment, 
  that resolution, 
  now we 're only 11.96 months shy of gilding reddit a 2 ^ nd happy birthday !, 
  skyrim really dissapointed me with reactions of other people at your actions . 
  what i would really like for them to do with zerkers is to make lethal strike a normal damage skill just like flatten or straggering strike , or maybe even possible to combo : lethal strike ( dash stagger ( ? ) ), 
  + stagerring strike + flatter sounds cool . 
  but bsd was released for free . 
  and while unix and bsd fough over whether this was legal , linus created linux which is a unix clone and free for everyone . 
  fellow lore addict !, 
  can you answer me one question ? 
  in labyrinth of terror is there any cinematic after entering it ? 
  ( i only saw one which was when killian the kid fucks elleon quite hard ) because i 'm afraid i 've missed something . 
  does n't lethal strike have a animation lock ? 
  damnit i did n't get to nexus part and stuff i 'm level 58 atm and argon questline starts level 59 . 
  but my guess is that argons are simply evil race that wants to destroy all other . 
  but osx is n't a fork of freebsd i think . 
  osx came from nextstep/openstep which came from bsd . 
  remember to flair it so other people with similar problem can use the filter . 
  [ here 's a `` history tree '' of unix and it 's derivates ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/77/unix_history-simple.svg ), 
  edit : check the left side of the tree, 
  and here 's a very good explanation :, 
  * unix was an os that was sold in source code form , which in the early days allowed people to compile the os on their own hardware ( hardware was not standardized ) . 
  * the university of california , berkeley had bought a copy , and heavily modified the source code , renaming it ` berkeley software distribution ' ( bsd ) . 
  bsd unix then tried to release its source code for free , so that anyone could use it for any purpose . 
  * while bsd and canonical ` unix ' fought over whether that was legal , linux was written from scratch as a unix clone . 
  it was then released as free software in a similar manner . 
  however , since linux did not actually contain any official unix code , it did n't have to go through legal crap . 
  * as a result , linux became popular , and bsd fell into obscurity ... and yet , bsd 's code license allowed for a lot more than linux 's ( with linux , you have to release modifications under the same license ; for bsd , you do n't even have to acknowledge where you got the code ) . 
  * because of this extra freedom in bsd 's license , it was the perfect starting point for next ( which turned into os x ) . 
  the legal issues had ended and the code was available for free , but most of the free software advocates had already moved to developing linux . 
  * the debate about whether bsd is ` true unix ' is a trivial one . 
  officially , the unix trademark is owned by `` the open group '' , and they require a lot of money and ` proof ' that your os directly descended from unix in order for them to put the seal of approval for you to say you are officially unix . 
  * bsd has split up into several different distributions ( including freebsd , netbsd , openbsd , and more ) , but mac os x has not . 
  the individual bsd projects do n't have enough money to get official approval , but apple does . 
  * mac os x is thus considered an ` official ' version of unix , while none of the other bsds are . 
  however , technically speaking , all of them derive their code from the original unix operating system . 
  so in that way , they are all real unix systems . 
  * though some say that the source code was changed so much , that it can not be considered official unix because none of the original code exists in the project anymore . 
  well , that 's great , but that means os x is n't unix either . 
  * and thus , the debate continues . 
  wow this is amazing , amd must now come up with something revolutionary because now price/performance is with nvidia . 
  spacebar should be only used for realiate . 
  to give up on spacebar remember to create proper keybindings comforatble , but remember you should use keybindings that are best for you . 
  here is what i use so you can get some ideas :, 
  * shift + 1-6, 
  * shift + q e r t f g, 
  * f1-f6 ( this is for longer cds and stuff that i do n't need to use reactionally because my f buttons are positioned in an uncomfortable way ), 
  other possibilites, 
  * ctrl ( or alt ) + 1-6 ( or q e r t f g ), 
  * shift/ctrl/alt + left and right mouse clicks ( i used shift + left mouse click for my slayer for the distant blade skill because i think of it as a ranged auto atack ) . 
  you can also even just use the q e r t f g or other letters close to wasd but they have other functions for example r is to reply to whisper , f is interact , t is enchanting , etc. . . 
  as for slayer tips i only played one until level 45 so i can only give leveling advices . 
  * use glyph of 50 % cd reset chance on overhand strike , boosts your dps by alot .
