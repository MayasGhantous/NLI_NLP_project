  also put the skill on a comfortable easy to reach key because you 'll use it alot . 
  * also use 35 % ( ? ), 
  cd reset chance on heart thrust , also helps with dpsing . 
  getting ohs --  ht resets is pretty fun . 
  * try using the charge skill so your next skill activates faster, 
  * do n't forget to be always casting triumphant shout and tenacity so your mana is always up, 
  * additional to your dodge , you can also use leaping strike and charge to quickly get away from danger, 
  * remember to use dash so you have a better mobility allowing ( for example ) position yourself behind a boss or quickly follow him when he jumps/runs/etc ... 
  * ( when soloing ) try grouping up mobs because you have aoe skills and it should speed up grinding, 
  * you should try to position yourself behind the boss so you 'll deal more damage and get back crits, 
  * when you see a red eye flashing from boss , try using any of your stuns ( kick and stunning backhand ) to interrupt them . 
  ( with stunning backhand , try having overhand strike off cooldown because if you do stunning backhand you will be a bit in an animation lock , but if you do overhand strike after it will cancel the animation lock ), 
  4chan is legendary mate . 
  they have done a shitload of bad but also good stuff . 
  ( like doxxing some girls who abused of an endangered turtle ), 
  i really can not believe this . 
  ( not telling that you 're lying , but it 's hard to believe ), 
  i was playing with the ps2 ( only thing i had ) and then i got a computer . 
  whenever the game was 60 fps or more my reaction was `` whoooa smoothness so nice '' instead of having `` eye strains and headaches '' . 
  in portugal a b category ( normal cars ) costs 399 $, 
  are you serious or just joking ? 
  gta v is a joke on older consoles , also kinda like skyrim , gta v will be much better experience on pc due to mods and generally better settings than consoles . 
  people play thousands of hours from very cheap games ( or even free - tf2 dota 2 planetside 2 and entire genres that you do n't have like rts , mmo ... ) . 
  while most console games have like 20 hours of gameplay at $ 60 + shitty settings that you ca n't modify + forced to use their controler ( no choice again ) + pay for online . 
  and your argument is one game . 
  get your facts straight mate . 
  [ why pc ? 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/wiki/guide ), 
   pc gaming is far more expensive to even match consoles, 
  wow okay so you 're an actual uninformed misguided person . 
  first of let me tell you that we 're not in the 90s so all that `` pc iz expensiv '' bullshit is no longer true . 
  not let 's do the math and think two steps ahead :, 
  * you can build a pretty decent pc for $ 600 that crushes console performance ( not matches , but crushes ) . 
  you can go even as little as $ 400 if you really want to match console performance . 
  but let 's build a better machine for $ 600 . 
  * okay so we have a machine and now games : holy fuck dude steam autumn sale is close can get a shitload of aaa games -75 % off . 
  let 's assume every game costs $ 10 ( i increased a bit here , most of time games are cheaper than $ 10 ) and i buy 30 of those so $ 300 on games, 
  that 's pretty much it $ 900 for a machine that crushes consoles , can do a shitload of pc stuff like web browsing/video editing/music making/programming/whateverthefuckyouwant and got 30 aaa games . 
  now console :, 
  * $ 400 initial cost, 
  * games : aaa games ( okay i wont be so bad here ) so i assume you somehow buy then for $ 40 each ( if you want long enough ? ), 
  so i buy like 10 games and wasted $ 400, 
  * oh snap , need to buy subscription : $ 60 for a year ( and now i must suck microsoft/sony 's cock for a year ) but atleast you get `` free '' games that you must have subscription to access them , this means cocksucking forever . 
  so yea that 's pretty much $ 860 -- oh wait !, 
  you probably have a pc at home , how much did it cost ? 
  let 's assume it 's a normal prebuilt so there goes more $ 500 . 
  final verdict : $ 900 for a pretty decent pc that can also do better gaming that `` next '' gen consoles . 
  $ 860 for a console with 10 games , and more $ 500 because you need a fucking computer at home . 
  oh and you ca n't even play older games so you must have an older console to play them . 
  and this is just inital cost , the amout of money you save with steam sales humble bundles good old games etc etc while with console you must buy them for $ 60 ( or wait for less price ) . 
  so yeah you do not save money by going console . 
  you pay more money for a shitty service , now that is crazy . 
  now add the pc advantages : better graphics , use any input device you want , ** mods ** , backwards compability all the way back to 90s or more , ** steam ** , win money by playing games like csgo and dota 2 , entire genres like rts or mmos and the list goes on . 
  yup , pc totally expensive . 
  ( whoa after writing all this i realize how shitty console gaming is more than before ), 
  whoa you have skills on 7 8 9 0 . 
  do you have super hands or something ? 
  what fullscreen windowed is about ? 
  i 've played always fullscreen for years and never encountered any problem . 
  well if you got the patience and time you can simply try out other classes , you 'll find out that most of your expectations were wrong . 
  for example , i always thought that zerker was op and easy because of his block ( i was getting owned in low level duels ) . 
  and after rolling one i really understood all the flaws that he has . 
  and same stuff for other classes aswell . 
  op , could you please remind of what happened for them to become naga ? 
   you have done well , little lich . 
  hey i do not play wow sadly but what happened to thrall and where garrosh ( ? ), 
  came from ? 
  garrosh * hellscream * , is he grom 's son ? 
  night elves are truly the master race because they defeated the demons more than once . 
  i played aion back in version 2.7, 
  i really liked how the game was pvp oriented and it was a cool game , until tera went free to play and i left aion . 
  one big reason was because gameforge sucks donkey dick they fucked up aion pretty bad with goldpack and other shit and tera is okay despite being also handled by gameforge in europe . 
  ... that come to pc after some months . 
  just pray more to our lord and saviour rngesus . 
  so do you actually get 180 ilvl with only +7 patron ? 
  this is without innerwear and brooch ? 
  where do i get the belt ? 
  i bough white innerwear for 1k and got a brooch drop in lp . 
  typical asian mmo, 
  +8251895279812 enchantment level with 225191295912 spots for your crystals . 
  i 'm a bit surprised with tera to be having only 4 pieces that need enchanting . 
  other games have like 10 set pieces ( left should , right shoulder piece ... ) it gets kind of annoying . 
  i think you can get pvp belts ( opportune favored and advantaged ) from agnitor merchant . 
  if you installed both versions then why just simply make a character and check what the ping is ? 
  since we do not know your location and internet speed , the best method is for you to check for yourself . 
  my max drop was only 8 . 
  the relic drop is retarded and i really hope they fix it because sometimes you are waiting for a level 44 weapon and you 're almost 46 and stuff like that . 
  i really wish they would make drops more consistent . 
  you 're making confusion with fps . 
  ping only matters with how fast your internet is . 
  so it does n't get affected with populated areas and whatnot . 
  fps is how smoothly the game runs and it depends on your hardware and how populated the area is , graphics quality and stuff . 
  i 'm 17 and i still think it 's kind of cool `` aw yea tribal stuff and shit '' ( but still prefer the old one , looks more professional ), 
  pls do n't judge me :( it 's a phase !, 
  just a question what does static mean ? 
  where can you buy glyphs with bg credits ? 
  i though you could only get them from sjg and tot . 
  oh thanks and 1 more :, 
  why in ** y ** ppl post like `` lfg rehm pass belt '' or pass shell etc. . . ? 
  why would anyone want to join a raid like that ?
