  i do n't know why but [ this ] ( http://images.uesp.net/thumb/a/a2/ob-class-warrior.jpg/200px-ob-class-warrior.jpg ) image pisses me of . 
  i like going full offense . 
  no fucking idea, 
  * dedicate a 1tb hdd for our program *, 
  almost $ 1k build but only a 760 . 
  you could definetly put a 770 there . 
  noooooo , i need to accept that my 5650 is gettin ' old :'(, 
  no worries the pc community will make a fuckton of mods just like with all other gtas, 
  hahahaha that 's pretty cool , i wish all alcoholic drinks did an impact on your character . 
  i always carry each type of alcohol drink with me . 
  still much better than those potatoes . 
  have fun with your rig , i wish i could somehow get rid of my laptop and build a pc ... 
  redwater skooma affects you too ^ ^, 
  i really like amd but i have a feeling that nvidia is just a better choice . 
  most things that i read is that amd cards are loud and hot as fuck . 
  around $ 200 r9 270x vs gtx 760 i saw that 760 wins . 
  also for $ 300 r9 280x vs 770 very close the 280x card gets a lil bit more fps on bf4 but i do n't even play bf . 
  most benchmarks show that nvidia wins . 
  a true elder scrolls experience is , with absolutely no doubt , on pc . 
  you can now put a shitload of graphic mods and it will look gorgeous . 
  physx is taking over alot of games so there are even less reasons to buy an amd card . 
  ( even tho i would prefer amd ), 
  gta v will come to pc in some months . 
  all peasant will be like in our glorious modding videos : * can i do dis on my xbox ? 
  wish it was nazeem, 
  your ex is a thalmor bitch o :, 
  sell that asap < 3, 
  i bough my laptop 4 years ago and it has a radeon hd 5650, 
   kingdom under fire ii is a massively multiplayer online real-time strategy rpg, 
  sounds like a dumbed down mmo , because console controllers have so little buttons, 
  toxic are the ones that have a led on the card right ? 
  wow this is amazing news good job . 
  even though i love amd , there appears to be less and less reasons to buy one over nvidia . 
  sexy as fuck, 
  ebony blade for the win !, 
  i love katanas, 
  i think it 's 1440x686 ahahaha, 
  yes this gen consoles have some wacky resolutions , like wtf is 792p ? 
  if consoles do this stuff at launch then imagine in 2 years : * elder scrolls vi runs at 923x567 and 34.3 fps but it still looks better than the pc version we promise . 
  ooooh i remember reading that back in 2007 wow thanks man . 
  but yeah i disabled natural environments and no crashes . 
  build a nice pc ( battlestation ), 
  reddit is fun works like a charm , never had problems with it . 
  upvoted, 
  oblivion 's music is the best , but it somehow does n't fit in skyrim . 
  delphine can go fuck herself . 
  never killed parthy < 3 and never will . 
  * what is better ? 
  to be born good , or to overcome your evil nature through great meditation *, 
  i recommend not building just for skyrim but for more games because pc is the way to go . 
  / r/buildapc - self explanatory, 
  / r/pcmasterrace - this is a circlejerk sub they make fun of consoles and basically a worship on pc gaming , but they also love to help people that want to * convert * to pc gaming . 
  you can also read their ** why pc ? 
  ** so you get more confident in building a pc . 
  atleast he admits they suck . 
  now that 's progress . 
  stop !, 
  you violated the lore, 
  i just hope elder scrolls vi is n't so dumbed down like skyrim is from previous games . 
  skyrim can be classified as action rpg . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/18498/ ? ), 
  bethesda : we will release it with a fuckton of bugs but let you guys mod the fuck out of our game and it will be fine . 
  why evga over gigabyte ? 
  hmm thanks for the warning . 
  any idea about asus and msi ? 
  to the left of ** hail sithis **, 
  * what is the colour of the night ? 
  * sanguine , my brother *, 
  that 's from oblivion 's sanctuary . 
  i think fnv also used the same engine . 
   brag about getting laid, 
  wow this peasants obviously are virgins because a man that has sex does n't brag about it . 
  it is something personal just for him and partner . 
  stupid kids using `` you dont get laid '' while their balls did n't even drop . 
  ** nightmare : ** civilization beyond earth gets dumbed down for gamepads . 
  / r/oblivion, 
  paying $ 1200 while only getting a 760 is kind of ... you will be expecting more . 
  if you could get a cheaper copy of windows you could use the money to get a 770 . 
  also do you need that expensive mobo ? 
  * it 's your choice whether you want to stick to 3rd gen of cpu and mobo, 
  * better get ddr3-1600 it will be cheaper, 
  * you 're paying too much for 10k rpm and only 250gb . 
  7200 rpm is the way to go, 
  i heard people saying that in 4th gen intel cheaped out on their cpus ? 
  you can research this subject . 
  why not a 990 board ? 
  hmm about mobo i really ca n't help because i do n't know much about them : s, 
  that * sup * at the end ahahah, 
  glad that i 'm not the only one that prefers to manually install the mods instead of using omm or nmm . 
  it 's actually pretty easy to install , but to uninstall you need to open the mod file and look which files belong to the mod so that you delete the right ones . 
  i do n't know , i generally do n't like using alot of software when i can do it by myself . 
  also i do n't have a fuckton of mods so load order is n't a huge issue . 
  hmmm maybe . 
  i have like . . < 10, 
  when the car hit another the particles looked like crap, 
  of paladins . 
  i guess i 'm total opposite when i play rpgs . 
  behold , the anti-paladin rules :, 
   a paladin must be of lawful good alignment . 
  fuck that , laws are to be broken .
