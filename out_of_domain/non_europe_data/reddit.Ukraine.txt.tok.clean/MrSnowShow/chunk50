  zip - unzip it . 
  it hurts even more being an oculus geared person and not getting patron drops and rolls so i ca n't even advance to next tier : /, 
  yes but if your ping is 150 in na then it will be always like that and being in a bg or on a deserted area it will always stay the same . 
  that 's right . 
  if companies do n't understand walls of text they then will sure `` listen to our money '', 
  reminds me of a song from some rapper `` if u aint talking money then i do n't wan na talk '', 
  i really enjoy the social aspect of mmos . 
  countless of times happened during leveling in tera where me or him was soloing a bam ( big ass monster ) and we would group up , kill them all and end up questing together until someone of us had to go . 
  and i remember at beginning ( i started new char ) i met this guy ingame and we grouped up so we kill stuff faster , he was new to the game and we ended up playing for 4 hours straight until level 20 and i was sort of mentoring him during that process . 
  at level 20 we got to fight 1st bam and i 'm like `` show your mentor how well u can solo this '' it was a really nice experience . 
  sadly i stopped playing for 1-2 weeks and when i came back a month ago i have n't seen him since : /, 
  so how 's tera ? 
  healers there are pretty important class and must be always active at boss fights . 
  i do n't usually heal but in tera i might try it out . 
  and i 'm the opposite . 
  i ca n't play anything other than sneaky archers . 
  killian here , as a fairly new 60 with oculus gear few days ago i decided to solo q skyring . 
  got grouped up , `` hey all '' and get kicked . 
  that 's my sad little story . 
  as a zerker i had carving , swift savage and cruel ( ? ), 
  but armor i had only 1 relentless , 1 green hp regen and another white quality and a restore mana when atacked by enemy player . 
  what about +2 power zyrks ? 
  are n't those okay at pvp ? 
  yes the ui is horrible as fuck because it lags everytime you open up something . 
  but healers in tera have a really important role , you wont just stay back and spam the same spell over and over , you constantly move around and depending who you are , priest or mystic do your healer thing . 
  in tera healers are definetly very important . 
  dc universe online has a controller role , his main purpose is to restore power ( mana ) to everybody and has alot of cc . 
  so normal 4-man instances consist of a tank , healer , troller ( controller ) and healer . 
  every type of power ( class ) can be a dps and each of them have a secondary role which can be those 3 : tank , healer or controller . 
  as a person that hates grinding and just wants to get to the endgame , obviously i love them . 
  i played at f2p release and it was very boring because the same quests with ocassional instance every now and then is boring as fuck and now imagine that with green quality weapons . 
  i got a sorc to 44 ( ? ), 
  and stopped playing because i could n't handle the incredible amount of repetitive content . 
  came back like a year later and there were the avatar weapons and i fell in love with them . 
  in my opinion avatar weapon just make the retarded brainless quest grind a bit less boring . 
  mods need to create somekind of warning at submit page or just a message in the middle between posts and header saying like . 
  `` click here for an updated guide for new level 60s '', 
  and create a wiki page describing most major changes for returning players . 
  check / r/elderscrollsonline to see what i mean . 
  i do n't have any comparison since i 've only played at killian but i do n't have any complains about the community size . 
  i should preface this by saying that i do not want to sound like a douche but ... 
  this is very painful to watch , i read somewhere that you had experience with mmos and stuff but you still play like you could n't understand the basic stuff like using your range , hit and run , using your powerful spells whenever they 're of cooldown . 
  atleast with sorc you must have a rotation and not playing like : `` uhh . . fireball , fireball , fireball , oh wait i have other skills ... fireball , fireball , yea this one lets use it , fireball , magma bomb , fireball fireball fireball ( magma bomb was already out of cd long time , but nah , let 's use fireballs ) . 
  and do n't stand in one place , move between auto atacks . 
  no idea . 
  but is n't remodeler the same as fashion coupons ? 
   only 1 weapon fashion coupon thing for all classes outside of reaper . 
  this makes me hate reaper even more . 
  why the fuck in fashion coupon shop there is a `` exclusively for reapers '' category ? 
  like what the fuck ? 
  what is the red pill all about ? 
  dofus died at 2.0 for me . 
  hover over the `` need help ? '', 
  on the top and click on recommended mods , that is a place to start . 
  this is what happens when russian characters are n't supported . 
  well you have to get yourself some mods . 
  you simply have to delete any file that you extracted to your data folder that came with the improved trees and flora patch . 
  here 's what the readme says that you have to delete :, 
  ** go to the data/textures/plants and delete ** bwcattail01 , bwcattail01_n , mshmcinnabarpolypore01 , mshmcinnabarpolypore01_n , mshmemeticrussula , mshmemeticrussula_n , mshtinderpolypore01 , mshtinderpolypore01_n , mushroomtoadstool , mushroomtoadstool_n , treefungus01 & treefungus01_n . 
  ( shrubs ), 
  ** go to the data/textures/trees / leaves and delete ** shrubazalealeavesfa , shrubazalealeavessu , shrubazaleapinksu , shrubforsythiasu , shrubmugopineleaves , shrubmugopineleavesfa and treedogwoodleavessu . 
  ( trees ), 
  treeweepingwillowbark , treeweepingwillowbark_n , treewhitepinebark , treewhitepinebark_n , treewhitepinebarkmoss , treewhitepinebarkmoss_n , treewillowoakbark , treewillowoakbark_n , treescotchpinebark , treescotchpinebark_n , treeyewbark and treeyewbark_n . 
  ** go to the data/textures/architecture / kvatch and delete ** kvatchtree , kvatchtree_n , kvatchtreeinside and kvatchtreeinside_n, 
  ** go to the data/textures/wood and delete ** wooddeadtree01 , wooddeadtree01_n, 
  i do n't think so , since there are no . esp files that need those textures/meshes so you 're just deleting addons . 
  but make sure you only delete the mod related ones . 
  also that 's what the readme says , and the authors knows his mods better than anyone else . 
  you are the one from my nightmares !, 
  got battle ready snow tiger on my second try . 
  i usually have very bad luck with this type of stuff . 
  i hate this piece of shit sub / r/hurtinganimals, 
  saw it in a similar thread and never gon na click it . 
  that 's cos ( 360\u00ba ) = 1, 
  i had a human male sorcerer ... god i hated him !, 
  so boring and armor sets sucked . 
  yep , maybe it 's just me but i swear that everyone 's a warrior in my server . 
  castanic in english :d, 
  but the whole point of castanic is horns ?? 
  is n't it ? 
  haha, 
  the grinding is n't that bad . 
  i 'm a big kida altoholic : i keep thinking that this or that class is better/worse and keep changing around and i 'm always thinking about it and then just say `` fuck all of this shit '' and quit the game , so in most mmos i do n't even get to half of max level . 
  but in tera i actually did it !, 
  it 's true that it is a brainless grindfest but some things helped me :, 
  * reading story quests and watching cinematics, 
  * role-playing, 
  * admiring nice landscapes, 
  and main reason why i still kept playing was because of the awesome combat system . 
  once you delete your character the name becomes avaliable immediatly . 
  there 's no reason why it would not , unless someone at that exact moment creates a new character with your deleted character 's name . 
  / r/incest, 
  i always kill that lil shit . 
  careful with fb posts or you 'll get a flair like me ( hover over with mouse ), 
  now every major company do this and i can finally delete my windows partition .
