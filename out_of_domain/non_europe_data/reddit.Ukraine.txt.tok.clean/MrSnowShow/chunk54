  was n't the 65 expansion called forgotten continent or smthing ? 
  and the * dirty doritos peasant *, 
  dragon nest has this . 
  example :, 
  eagle dive and eagle dive ( pvp ), 
  at currennt patch warrior is better overall . 
  but 65 gives alot of buffs to slayers ( double dodge like reaper , dodge animation smoother , 20 % dmg increase in some skills ... ), 
  now we need stickers for sale too : /, 
  well fallout 3 was released in 28 and 30 october 2008 it 's been almost 6 years and still no fallout 4 ( i know about new vegas , but it a separte project that was developed by obsidian and not bethesda ) . 
  so my guess is bethesda releases fallout 4 and maybe 2 years later we get tes 6 ( just like oblivion 2006 and fallout 3 2008 ), 
  wrong sub ... 
  oh nice , you made it yourself . 
  well , i 'm not against mobile gaming since i do n't hear them trashtalk pc . 
  and even some mobile devices run games better than consoles and just cost a little more . 
  what are bottom brackets ? 
  the pieces that you put where cranks go ? 
  that shadow seat : ' c, 
  my bike got stolen , i recently recovered it but the idiot changed my beautiful shadow seat with some gayish shitty rags ... 
  that depends on your internet connection and distance from the servers . 
  europe is playable ... 
  i dont get it : c, 
  tenpenny you motherfucking piece of shit !, 
  hover over at `` need help ? '', 
  and click on recommended mods . 
  he stole my bike , that fucking motherfucking snake . 
  my parents used to pull that one too many times . 
  but they atleast would n't delete my games . 
  `` the internet is not working because you 're playing [ insert singleplayer offline game here ] and it downloads viruses that slow down internet '', 
  i would ... / r/buildapc, 
  i like to run tot for fun , so i sell the badges that i get and it 's quick easy money . 
  5x40g for whites and 5x90g --  450g +200 g = 650g per run that takes like 12 minutes . 
  not really the efficient farm method probably but works for me . 
  here 's some suggestions :, 
  * 1 2 3 4 5 or 6 if you can reach comfortably, 
  * shift / ctrl / alt + 1 2 3 4 5 or 6 if you can reach, 
  * [ ( q e r t f g ( z x ) ] - i personally do n't use those because q is for marking , e is for quick party msg , r is to reply to whisper , t is for enchanting , f for interacting , z is for alliance so i just shift mod them :, 
  * shift / ctrl / alt + q e r t f g z x, 
  i also try to keep my binds logical :, 
  * shift + spacebar for mounting ( i think of it as spacebar is for jumping and shift + spacebar is jumping onto my mount ), 
  * i also used to use shift + left mouse button on my slayer for the distant blade skill ( ranged atack ) because i though of it as a ranged basic atack . 
  edit : also please dont use spacebar for your combos , i only use it for retaliate . 
  oh hey , you 're that lancer from / y haha i remember you !, 
  do n't use spacebar . 
  why do people buy 770 4gb ? 
  why you not post specs ? 
  anyway , it will run skyrim . 
  well the r9 290 performs much better and costs the same that 's why i was wondering, 
  ( although none of this is valid now since the 900 series are out ), 
  i 'm not sure if you can enter the dungeon alone , but my guildies did it 2-man . 
  simply one of them logged out after killing a boss and the other one just told him to log back in once the boss spawned , so the potion buff timer did n't expire while he was logged off . 
  also do note that ( atleast in europe ) without tera club if you do dungeon finder you will have 1h cooldown but if you form a party ( i only did it with 3 man party ) and you get 2h of cooldown . 
   the biggest turn off for me though was honestly the combat . 
  its my personal opinion but i wanted to play an rpg not a first person shooter or dark souls online . 
  i hate that aim your skills constantly need to be hyper active style of mmo gameplay . 
  this is exactly why i play tera haha . 
  combat !, 
  tera - make old content also drop t15 gear . 
  there 's a big amount of dungeons but they 're all outdated because they drop outdated gear ... 
  whoa , it 's actually you ... 
  one argument that i strongly defend is the one where most console users own a pc too . 
  so they 're already spending more money on a shit prebuild $ 500 pc and a $ 400 console and both of those perform worse at gaming and bunch of pc-related activities . 
  but with a mid end $ 600 gaming pc you will have much better gaming and all the pc-related activities you need ( video editing/music making/streaming/browsing / whateverthefuckyouwant ) much better too . 
  so this totally crushes their `` pc is expensiv lulz '' argument and you save an insane fucking amount of money because of cheap games deals due to steam , gog , humble bundle , etc. . . 
  this is what i dislike about tera and pretty much alot of mmos . 
  devs spend shitload of time creating the world ( and tera 's is gorgeous ) and then at endgame you 're only focused on a few dungeons and areas and almost never leave the cities . 
  my daily places visits are : tria for rehm , crescentia for ghille , eu hall for vault , habere for lot farming and zulfikar/kanstria for nexus . 
  that 's pretty much it with few exceptions such as invalesco , jax trust and other factions but i do them rarely when i 'm really bored . 
  i only walk around in like 15 % of all areas . 
  i have n't played much classes ( to a high level ) but from my experiences ohs is like an orgasm . 
  in this game all atacks give a sense of weigh to them and when i hit that ohs , thunderstrike or radiant arrow it is sooo satisfying , especially when it causes enemies several times my size to get knocked the fuck down . 
  well i 'm only left with 2 classes :, 
  * lancer : hell no , i hate shields, 
  * warrior : backstab too cheesy and there are a shitload of them, 
  * archer : possible but nah ... 
  i do n't like kiting anymore , i prefer chasing the runners now . 
  * sorc : was my first choice back when tera went f2p , i kinda do n't like their skillset and a disk sucks as a weapon , also same reason as archer ... kiting . 
  * reaper : go away, 
  * slayer : my first though when i first heard of the game , but i heard that the class is bad so i deleted mine at 45 . 
  this is probably my class, 
  * zerker : the class i never though i would play since plate and slow atacks never appealed to me , but it 's my main now because i find hilarious playing a little girl with huge axe . 
  if elins did n't exist i would n't play zerker . 
  i 'd roll either slayer or sorc and a very small chance of archer ( probably not ) . 
  so i 'm waiting to see how zerks play at 65 , if i do n't like then i roll slayer . 
  back when high level gear did n't look the exact same as fucking tier 5 ... 
  are n't alkahests being removed ? 
  i have my 120 $ seiko automatic watch and it is much better than looking at phone + it 's not very fancy or big . 
  all of those games you mentioned + fallout new vegas and elder scrolls online were only ** published ** by bethesda . 
  bethesda ** developed ** like 4 games in the last 12 years which were morrowind , oblivion , fallout 3 and skyrim . 
  hmm this reminds me of how / r/oblivion was back then . 
  glad it 's under control now < 3, 
  you should try / r/redditrequest see if they reply there maybe ? 
  this subreddit definetly needs an updated wiki ( they have level 60 guide back when achm cof and mchm were the end game ... ) and a faq . 
  obsidian entertainment , which contains a few of the employees who worked on previous fallout games at black isle studios , along with a larger number of new employees . 
  honestly because i simply do n't give a fuck . 
  i die , so what ? 
  it 's not like i can something about it ... 
  i did n't play much but i really liked the vampire class in forsaken world , drain life , transform to bat and dash forward was really cool . 
  i might also add that the blademaster ( the dude you speak to when you want to fight ) is one of the most hilarious npcs in the game in my opinion . 
  those are shadowmarks and the book `` shadowmarks '' explain what each one of them means . 
  haha i always prefer to go alone for some reason , followers just overall slow me down .
