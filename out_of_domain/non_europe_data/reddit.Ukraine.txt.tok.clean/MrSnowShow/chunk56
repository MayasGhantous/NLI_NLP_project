  so i just paste this in . xdefaults and whatever terminal i 'm using will have their color scheme changed ? 
  i stopped playing dofus years ago because :, 
  * premium, 
  * you did n't have means of gold income so i could level to 80 but i would n't have the ~ ~ gold ~ ~ kamas for the equipment . 
  that 's why i spent my time at lvl 46 pvping outside astrub . 
  basiically you 're broke as fuck . 
  * speaking of pvp they removed `` hunting missions '' where you had a target and u must kill him in open world . 
  i really loved to open world pvp as a level 37 and later as a 46 . 
  i used to go [ 5 , -22 ] i believe which was above astrub north gate ( at that time it was a main place for pvp ) and i would patrol all that area from east ( cracklers ) to west ( forest ) and kill anyone who was my level range . 
  i eventually hit rank 5 brakmar and it was a load of fun until the 2.0 update came and i 've never played again . 
  the visual overhaul killed it for me . 
  i really enjoyed playing metin2 on a p server . 
  but that was years ago ( maybe 5 ) since it was the closest thing to an action combat mmo i could find . 
  do people still play this game ? 
   version of linux, 
  this is one of the hundreds of distributions avaliable . 
  this one is called linux mint, 
   what do i need to get this look ? 
  the desktop environment is cinnamon , which comes as default with linux mint . 
  savage strike gives your power atacks 25 % chance to decapitate , so i guess you must hold `` rt '' because that 's how you do power atacks . 
  thief - warrior ( but has no stealth ), 
  hunter - archer, 
  and i do not really understand what you mean with the second part * `` are those stats game changing enough to give up da looks u want ? 
  who `` they '' ? 
  could you please tell me what did i do wrong ? 
  but what did i say of bad in the `` deleted '' comment ? 
  i also wanted to get into anime but i think it 's very queer and cringy . 
  i do have yuuki asuna from sao on my desktop and some anime girl on my home screen but i still dislike it . 
  funny how you consider ubuntu hard even how it 's designed to work out of the box , which it does . 
  i wonder what you have to say about arch or gentoo . 
  what are unique features of touchwiz ? 
  i always heard it sucks hard and i use apex launcher now instead of it and no not seem to miss features . 
  i do n't have any ads when i have no gold . 
  am i blessed ? 
  reddit is fun !, 
  it was my first app almost a year ago and i 've never tried anything else simply because it never failed me . 
  apex master race !, 
  my parents have both `` bq '' phones ( new cheap but good spanish brand ) and i did notice some stuff missing , especially notifications options since i needed to click one button to switch to that menu to enable wifi , bluetooth , etc. . . 
  i have a galaxy s duos . 
  cyanogen for my phone is only on alpha state with no working bluetooth , audio , camera and more stuff , so i guess it 's not worth checking others roms because if the most popular is still in alpha then others do n't even support probably . 
  is that min icon theme ? 
  i really like icons without labels underneath . 
  makes homescreen look cleaner . 
  it looks nice . 
  but my personal touch would be transparent clock . 
  haha have fun !, 
  at current patch you have a 10-man raid normal and hard mode , 1 , 5 and 7 raids for accesories , nexus which is a big thing with shitload of people to kill mobs who come from nexuses out of the sky and then u enter and kill boss , there is alliance stuff which has 3 factions but i have n't explored much that . 
  and some other stuff that i forget . 
  i do n't know if you 're the same but i see alot of archers using penetrating and radiant arrow like an instant cast which is wrong . 
  those skills are for full charging to get most damage . 
  things look nice except that horrible conky : /, 
  haha nice !, 
  i 'm also watching crendor playing wc3 . 
  if you want to keep the conky , then ( personally ) i would remove alot of labels for things that are obvious . 
  for example you have, 
  which is redundant, 
  and for example you have `` date '' but obviously everybody knows that 02:41 69th january bla bla bla is the date . 
  i 'm still looking forward for a remade lethal strike . 
  insta-cast which chains into flatten or staggering strike ? 
  nice !, 
  ty for this . 
  the only one i know is that they 're getting a ** triple ** crit rate on radiant arrow . 
  i remember that feeling, 
  \\  goes through mountains bcuz it will be faster, 
  yeah right ... 
  hate how there 's no fov increase support ... everything gets stretched . 
  damn anon , this is so sexy . 
  only thing i would to is removing top bar from every window . 
  well , if you 're going to only play solo with your reaper while continuing to level your warrior then i guess it 's okay . 
  but definetly you should level atleast one character from 1 to 60 because 40-60 is quite alot of content and if you skip it you will just be a burden to your raid . 
  too many icons , ugly widget that does n't fit and 2clock . 
  ofc . 
  look other posts , almost all have it removed . 
  where is the rice ? 
  you can download the quest award leveler mod to fix that . 
  explain this more please . 
  i play with telinesis exploit but i use it as a separate spell . 
  do people really believe in yt comparisons ? 
  everybody knows the quality goes down , real comparison is playing them side by side by yourself . 
  okay thanks !, 
  seiko 5 automatic !, 
  there 's something i do n't understand . 
  with ubisoft having history of bad ports why the fuck are you still buying it day 1 ? 
  daedric is not sexy :(,
