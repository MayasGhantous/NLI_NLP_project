  the only reason why i really play zerker haha . 
  no elin = no zerker . 
  is n't that the ulfric 's place ? 
  you imperial bastard !, 
  you 're the traitor for joining the `` empire '' . 
  the empire was built by talos and you ban talos worship , what is wrong with you ? 
  just a comment on your flair . 
  ubuntu and xubuntu is the same , only that in xubuntu the de is xfce and in ubuntu it 's unity . 
  is n't crunchbang pretty much abandoned ? 
  ( read this on / g / somewhere ), 
  was expecting an ubuntu 's unity screenshot . 
  the difference between ubuntu and xubuntu is the desktop environment ( de in short ) . 
  desktop environment is pretty much all the looks : windows , menus , buttons , icons , etc. . . 
  and yes , xubuntu is lighter because it uses a lighter de . 
  * ubuntu runs unity, 
  * xubuntu runs xfce, 
  * kubuntu runs kde, 
  * lubuntu runs lxde, 
  ( and maybe there 's more but i do n't do n't know ), 
  they 're all the same os , the only difference is the looks . 
  i really hate this maven bitch . 
  `` make me angry and i 'll contact the dark brotherhood '' like wtf bitch ? 
  i 'm the listener . 
  this also is a bit sad to see how dark brotherhood became more `` common '' in skyrim compared to oblivion . 
  for example you have delvin that gets you stuff for the sanctuary and maven who says she 'll contact the dark brotherhood . 
  nobody that is n't among the ranks of the db should know and have any contact with it 's members , the db must remain a secret and only trust those who passed the trial . 
  oh , i though maven meant really talking to dark brotherhood directly . 
  also did n't know about delvin but i think that you simply ca n't leave the dark brotherhood , you stay or leave dead . 
  ohh i think i know why i have the idea that if you abandon the dark brotherhood you must die . 
  it was from an oblivion 's db side quest where 2 argonian shadowscales ask you to kill a `` traitor '' because he refused to do his assassin duties . 
  but i guess this is only for the royal assassins ( argonian shadowscales ) and the db does n't do this . 
  * `` when ocheeva and i trained with the dark brotherhood as children , we befriended another initiate , a shadowscale by the name of scar-tail . 
  the three of us were inseperable [ sic ] . 
  when our training was completed , we reluctantly parted ways . 
  but now ... now , the unthinkable has happened !, 
  scar-tail has fled black marsh and refuses to fulfill his duties as royal assassin !, 
  this is an act of treason !, 
  this treachery must be punished !, 
  the zerker new skill ( not the throw one ) looks pretty lackluster . 
  i was expecting it to be a little dash/charge . 
  i have a radeon hd 5650m ( which is a lil bit better ) and i run this game at a playable level . 
  instantly reminded me of dota 2 . 
  i hope this is true , i also saw videos where slayers would leaping strike + jaw breaker and it would kd . 
  [ example here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upcqjk5fl5gv ) it 's right in the start of the duel . 
  edit : and later on he does ww cancel into jaw breaker and it kds again . 
  ( since nobody has answered yet i 'll do , but i do n't play on na ), 
  * yes, 
  * [ not confirmed ] i think territ is dead, 
  * i think alot of eu players that go to na join the mt server . 
  i 'm kinda pissed at 15m backstab ... also where 's the glyph for zerker where we would get increased movement speed after casting tomahawk ? 
  honestly , i do n't have any problems by playing in eu . 
  but if i played the na version for a bit and get used to all the goodies there , the eu version would maybe be shit for me . 
  but since i 've never played na , i 'm good with eu . 
  i also never used or will use the cash shop so i do n't care that it 's more expensive . 
  it 's not like it 's aion where the eu version has stupid restrictions such as not being able to trade , use trade broker and other stuff without a `` gold pack '' . 
  i do n't have any comparison because i 've only played in killian . 
  but i do n't feel the server being empty , and it 's expected for alot of players to return at 65 patch which will come in december . 
  explain me what happened please , have n't played league in a year ( since season 3 ending ) . 
  from what i heard he was really good at school . 
  it wont work in a single spell , you must create 1 weakness spell , cast it and only then cast your damage spell . 
  \\  using avast, 
  have you heard about the new free common sense 2015 ? 
  he stopped receiving karma after op deleted account . 
  [ here 's a very nice video explaining everything ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rfqhjzy5-0 ), 
  ugh this makes me want to quit tera . 
  this retard warrior class keeps getting buffed and shit . 
  ( yes i 'm qqing ), 
  do n't go past 6 , f6 for skills . 
  * shift/ctrl/alt + 1-6, 
  * shift/ctrl/alt + q e r t f g x c v, 
  * i also like shift + left click for slayer 's distant blade skill since i think of it as a ranged auto atack ( left click = auto atack and shift + left click = ranged auto atack ), 
  general tip is try to keep your binds logical too ( i have shift + q e r for my triumphant shout , tenacity and unchained anger ( ? ), 
  which all 3 are mana skills . ), 
  another example of logical binds : on sorc i have backstep on c which is an escape skill , i use shift + c for teleport jaunt because it 's also an escape skill . 
  and another one : i use shift + spacebar for my mount because spacebar = jump so shift + spacebar = jump on mount \\ ^ ^, 
  i can rice it . 
  hipster term for customizing . 
   panels are a waste of space on my tiny screen . 
  then how do you know the time , battery , connect to wireless networks , ajust the volume etc. . . ? 
  what about sound ? 
  am i the only one that thinks graphic comparisons on youtube is retarded ? 
  i mean how you ajust it ? 
  using the fn key right ? 
  do you need to configure them or they already are ? 
  because in my debian install i remember brightness working but not sound . 
  rip in peace, 
  if you cancel a skill the damage will not apply . 
  but you can activate the other skill right after it did dmg and skip the rest of the animation ( works for some skills ) . 
  but no there 's no such thing as totally canceling an animation and it still doing damage . 
  i consider myself a badass for starting from crunchbang and then going to arch . 
  you do n't need antivirus in 2014 , especially on linux . 
  common sense 2015 is the best . 
  scythera fae , too bad main questline does n't take you there and there are no dungeons there so there 's no reason to be there :(, 
  oh my fucking god that little asshole !, 
  [ oblivion spoiler ] ( #spoiler `` thank god for the oblivion 's db questline '' ), 
  [ source ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/92dd8/test_post_please_ignore/ ), 
  well in my opinion skyrim 's guild questlines are too short and suck because of that . 
  i remember playing companions for the first time , i heard about that `` circle '' with the most trusted members and out of nowhere i 'm there to join the circle because i did ~ ~ 2 or 3 quests ~ ~ , what the fuck ? 
  ok i looked at the questline in uesp and you actually do ** one ** real quest ( which was retrieving a piece of wuuthrad ) and then your next quest is joining the circle , are you fucking serious ? 
  imagine this happening in the oblivion 's dark brotherhood : you do your first contract and then lucien lachance invites you to join the black hand , it 's retarded as fuck .
