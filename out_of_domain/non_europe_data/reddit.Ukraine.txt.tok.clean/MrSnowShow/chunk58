   unfortunately , it did n't go so well, 
  ah too bad , just as you said * bsd priority is n't making drivers . 
   wallpaper : # 000000, 
  oh you ... 
  but you could at least post with screenfetch or something open ... 
  edit : oh and use tinywm for true minimalist ( it has ~ 50 lines of code ), 
  never done that instance but i 've looked at the pictures and damn it 's fucking gorgeous . 
  i would be much more excited for portal 3 . 
  / r/oblivion, 
  omg i got ta replay the triology ( again x4 ) . 
  never did play the 4th weird not related or the new one . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ cow ^ ^ ^ cow ^ ^ cow ^ ** cow ** ** cow **, 
  definitely worth it . 
  my favorite is pop 2 ww . 
  in portuguese people call them `` montanhas russas '' ( which means russian mountains ) but in russian people call them `` amerikanski gorki '' ( which means american mountains ) . 
  what should my caption be ? 
  omg is blue build ez viable again ? 
  ( have n't played since end of season 3 ), 
  can you give me an example of an archer 's 100-0 combo ? 
  for some reason i ca n't really see how they do this . 
  hmm i see , too bad you do n't use a variety of skills such as poison arrow and other stuff . 
  i prefer sorcerer 's 100-0 because you feel like you drop everything you have and with burst of celerity it just feels awesome . 
  if you think the class is fun and stuff , then it will get only better at 65 patch so they 're pretty decent . 
  \\  16gb of ram, 
  \\  gtx ** 750 **, 
  imperial units . 
  m/d/y and other retarded stuff . 
  edit : also imperial units do not have any relation to each other , i ca n't imagine doing chemistry or physics . 
  let me give you an example , a 1 dm ^ ^ 3 ( volume ) of water is 1 l ( capacity ) and weights 1 kg . 
  units scale unifomally 1 meter = 10 decimeters = 100 centimeters = 1000 milimeters and you can replace `` meters '' with other stuff like weight ( grams ) or capacity ( litres ) . 
  is there any relation between volume and capacity ( let 's say cubic inches to gallons ) ? 
  is there any logical scaling between inches , feet , yards and miles ? 
  funny fact is that the kilogram had a defined weight which is somekind of number of carbon atoms , while the pound 's definition is exactly 0.43 ( somethingsomething ) ... kilograms . 
  this means that the pound is dependant of the kilogram . 
  oh and a chemistry thing : if you have 1 mol of some molecule then it 's weight is the same in grams as the atomic number of each atom x2 ( hydrogen is exception ) ( protons + neutros ) so for example 1 mol of carbon weights ~ 12g , and a mol of water ( h2o ) weights 18g . 
  edit2 : even more science stuff such as 1 newton is the force needed to move 1 meter a 1 kg object . 
  1 pa ( this is a pressure unit ) is 1 n of force on a 1m ^ ^ 2 area . 
  1 joule of energy is the amount of energy needed to make 1g of water go up 1 degree celsius . 
  what the fuck is month 16 ? 
  the international hacker known as 4chan ? 
  check the `` need help ? '', 
  section . 
  and compabilities is pretty much common sense and reading authors input about it . 
  less is more . 
  in oblivion i go always breton < 3 . 
  are n't in skyrim heights all the same ? 
  i really like dark elf because they 're good at magic and stealth which is my favorite combination . 
  there 's a town there dude . 
  i remember reading somewhere before skyrim was released that they kinda made the races height very identical and not so noticeable like in oblivion , but probably it 's wrong . 
  ps : [ uesp master race ] ( http://www.uesp.net/wiki/skyrim:races ), 
  i already explained in my reply why i though it was that way . 
  i have n't played skyrim in months so i do n't really remember . 
  3rd person the entire time ? 
  whoa ... 
  i always though of animations as clunky and unreal . 
  i prefer looking closely how i murder my enemies \\ ^ ^, 
  we do n't need * more * mods . 
  we need * active * mods . 
   struggle to find groups and on the rare occasion i do find one, 
  how do you struggle to find groups ? 
  i always run rehm once per day no problem and there 's still plenty of people doing it . 
  i came back again xd . 
  wanted to ask how you browse the availiable wifi networks ? 
  and does it have options to look at details of the wifi you 're connected like what 's the password and all that stuff ? 
  warriors do have a high skillcap but in pve at current patch i think slayers have a harder time because you can get caugh midswing and you only have 1 dodge while warriors have dfa which makes it stupidly easy to dodge dangerous stuff ( earthquake in rehm for example ) . 
  whatever , the event sucked balls do n't know why some people even bothered . 
   then the profiles for each network are stored in / etc/netctl / and those files have the network name password and some other stuff . 
  oh nice , that 's exactly what i wanted to know . 
  i saw you on / g /, 
  how to fix problems with windows, 
  i 'd just like to interject for a moment ... 
  what you 're referring to as linux , is in fact , gnu/linux , or as i 've recently taken to calling it , gnu plus linux . 
  linux is not an operating system unto itself , but rather another free component of a fully functioning gnu system made useful by the gnu corelibs , shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full os as defined by posix . 
  many computer users run a modified version of the gnu system every day , without realizing it . 
  through a peculiar turn of events , the version of gnu which is widely used today is often called `` linux '' , and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the gnu system , developed by the gnu project . 
  there really is a linux , and these people are using it , but it is just a part of the system they use . 
  linux is the kernel : the program in the system that allocates the machine 's resources to the other programs that you run . 
  the kernel is an essential part of an operating system , but useless by itself ; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system . 
  linux is normally used in combination with the gnu operating system : the whole system is basically gnu with linux added , or gnu/linux . 
  all the so-called `` linux '' distributions are really distributions of gnu/linux . 
  it 's sad actually because i want to game but ca n't get started . 
  what i 'm saying is that linux is not an os , but just the kernel of the gnu system .

  [ source ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wso-td0hqxo ), 
  i have no idea , i want to play a game but then i just ca n't focus on it and do other stuff instead ... 
   ^ ( also it 's a famous copy pasta of richard stallman ), 
  there 's a little flaw on your logic which is that when people say rolls instead of rolls royce they 're still referring to the car . 
  but linux is only the kernel and gnu/linux is the os . 
  it 's more like calling `` powerpoint '' to every presentation and using `` photoshop '' as a verb . 
  you did it by accident ? 
  here 's how to fix it :, 
  uninstall the game from pc, 
  buy a ps3 or xbox 360, 
  buy the game, 
  play the game how the developers intended . 
  not sure , it does n't look practical yet . 
  it 's like back in 2005 or something where all touch devices ( pdas and stuff ) were all laggy and overall bad until the iphone came ( i think , not fanboy ) and had a functioning , responsive touchscreen . 
  i guess the same must happen to oculus . 
  wow this is hilarious dude !, 
  i will copy pasta this whenever i see gnu/linux .
