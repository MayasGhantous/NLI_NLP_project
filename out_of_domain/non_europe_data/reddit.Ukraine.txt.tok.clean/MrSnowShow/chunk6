  only the weak follow the rules because they 're too afraid to break them, 
   a paladin may never willfully commit an evil act . 
  i do whatever i want just to fullfil my personall needs, 
   a paladin can not associate with any character who persistently commits acts which would cause the paladin him/herself to fall - notably evil creatures . 
  i do n't care who i associate to because i might even betray them later if i desire to . 
   a paladin must remain truthful and forthright at all times . 
  lies , betrayal , anything to overcome my enemies, 
   a paladin must give fair warning and due quarter to enemies, 
  never do this because :, 
   a paladin holds stealth , subterfuge , attack from the rear , missile weapons and especially poison as weapons of last resort . 
  these are my main means to deal with enemies . 
  ** for a guy : **, 
  * do you know how to take out a condom ? 
  * uhhh . . with the hands ? 
  * in your case that would be by farting *, 
  * get informed about pc parts ( search in yt for how to build a computer ) because you need to know what you 're doing . 
  * set up a budget . 
  how much you 're willing to spend, 
  * go to / r/buildapc and ask them help for your budget, 
  hah i remember seeing that 0.69 seconds clip from the trailer i was so excited for skyrim release @ 11/11/11 < 3, 
   the spectral assassin, 
  oh no my friend , its not only * the spectral assassin * . 
  it 's ** lucien mothafuckin lachance **, 
  is n't the tree called gildergreen ? 
  ** from skyrim **, 
  * * m'aiq is always in search of calipers , yet finds none . 
  where could they have gone ? 
  this one is that in oblivion he would search for calipers but they 're not present in skyrim . 
  sad :(, 
  * * m'aiq saw a mudcrab the other day . 
  horrible creatures !, 
  love this one , it 's because is oblivion npcs engaged in random conversations and this is one of the things they say, 
  * * m'aiq 's father was also called m'aiq . 
  as was m'aiq 's father 's father . 
  at least , that 's what his father said *, 
  ** from oblivion **, 
  * * some people want special bows that take too long to load and need special arrows called bolts . 
  m'aiq thinks they are idiots . 
  * * it is good the people wear clothing . 
  m'aiq wears clothing . 
  who would want to see m'aiq naked ? 
  sick , sick people . 
  very sad . 
  * * i have seen dragons . 
  perhaps you will see a dragon . 
  i wo n't say where i saw one . 
  perhaps i did not . 
  the voice actor for him is so badass . 
  i do n't know if you still remember his voice especially at these quotes, 
  * * if someone is inclined to eat , and they taste the apple ... * *** death ***, 
  * when you say ** rufio will die by my hand !, 
  ** he will say awesomly * eeeexcelent *, 
  i still have that voice in my head , such badassery . 
  yeah i just asked serana to infect me and we were both vampire vampire-hunters . 
  i did n't do the vampire cure quest . 
  but for what my friend told me its easy as fuck . 
  this is one of the things that was dumbed down in skyrim . 
  like wtf , curing vampirism should be no easy task and almost no one should know about it . 
  i heard that in morrowind no one knew about the cure but if you were smart enough you would figure out the way , in oblivion it was probably the most extensive quest but still relatively easy to start . 
  but in skyrim it is too easy, 
  hey , to not start a new thread i would like to ask noob question about pedals too . 
  my friends said that transparent pedals break faster , is this true ? 
  that sounds awesome , i hope that in the next elder scrolls bethesda acknowledges the dumbing down and fixes it . 
  that 's exactly the ones that i want , transparent odyssey twisted pc pedals , cuz my frame and fork are violet so i ca n't find any combining color . 
  yes , skyrim 's world felt empty . 
  i only played oblivion and gon na play morrowind soon , but in oblivion every quest had interesting plot and alot of times you had choices and unexpected twists . 
  i remember this one quest when teeinava the dark brotherhood 's shadowscale sends you to kill another shadowscale , when you arrive he tells that if you spare he him he will reveal the location of a treasure , so what i did is asked him where the treasure is and then still killed him and got his heart as proof . 
  this little things and much more are what makes most oblivion 's quests a blast . 
  and that one quests where you rent a bed on a ship and then when you wake up you find out it was hijacked and you are in middle of the sea , totally unexpected . 
  i have a huge rant about the elder scrolls series but i do n't know if 10000 chars is enough ahahahah, 
   the the master race, 
  is this intentional ? 
  close , its 1366x768 #laptopmasterrace, 
  well well , are n't we an over achiver ( edit : skyrim reference anyone ? 
  are you ready ? 
  here we go :, 
  ** pc specific **, 
  * pc ui , just like darnified ui and skyui, 
  * higher res textures, 
  * more hotkeys because we have a fucking keyboard with lots of keys, 
  * if possible , support for hyperthreading , multiple cores and all the advantages pc brings, 
  * skyrim has ( or had ) a bug where if fps goes way over 60 , things start to fucking go crazy [ video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfcdrma2daq ) . 
  support for higher fps for people with 144 hz monitors . 
  * and of course keep the modding ability , since this is huge in elder scrolls and give us construction set/creation kit . 
  * hope bethesda never thinks of bringing any kind of drm ( steam is exception ), 
  ** general stuff **, 
  * better physics, 
  * better ai, 
  * better graphics, 
  * better performance, 
  * less bugs, 
  * better landscapes, 
  ** immersion **, 
  * what 's with the fucking handholding ? 
  remove essential from npcs . 
  okay , so basically if the npc is related to some quest , he should have protection from other threads like dragons , vampires and random bandits . 
  but if the played wants to kill that npc the game should allow it and the player needs to face the consequence of killing an important character . 
  * fix the goddamn fake lights , i remember in skyrim we did n't need fucking torches because everything was so clear . 
  when we go to a dungeon we need to feel scared . 
  mages should use light spells , warriors need to use torches , and rogues potions to see in the dark or whatever .
