  i did n't say `` pc gaming is expensive '', 
  not sure, 
  hah , i have masterracers in my class \\ ^ ^, 
  i think it 's on sale at steam at the moment , but buy the legendary edition because it has all dlcs . 
  the amazing modding community makes the game age in reverse so it 's never too late . 
  i 'm a bit late but these videos are very helpful :, 
  [ enchanting guide ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrgicl9aspe ), 
  [ alchemy guide ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzhck9nfuvk ), 
   honestly 4k is not worth it at the moment, 
  you should read more carefully . 
  no idea , i simply turn some game on and instantly get bored and exit . 
  not saying that i do n't play at all but i play maybe once every 2 days and like 30 minutes 1 hour maximum . 
  it was actually a redditor . 
  it was really easy :, 
  \\  200 $ budget, 
  wow , you ca n't assassinate with weapons other than the hidden blade ? 
  that sucks . 
  the way that i like to assassinate my target is to hide at a small distance and then run to them and kill them when they realize it 's too late . 
  i feel like ac3 is a bit underrated but almost all combat in it is the best . 
  remember that [ ac3 demo ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzrkley9ohq ) video where you chase a guy , run up a tree then jump on him with your tomahawk ? 
  or at the fort where you 're chasing your target then get past a weapon 's rack with those rifles , grab one while you 're chasing and then jump down and kill him with it ? 
  fucking awesome right ? 
  all the combat moves and animations have a sense of `` weight '' . 
  when you smack/cut an enemy you can sort of feel how hard that hit and it 's a very satisfying feeling . 
  to give you an idea : load up black flag and equip the hidden blades and press attack a few times ( to make him draw the hidden blades ) , now go into ac3 and do the same thing . 
  ( my opinion ) you see , in ac3 the sound effect and animation is top notch - when connor draws those hidden blades i can `` feel '' them coming at high speed and can almost feel the recoil that it does . 
  while in black flag this is just meh ... 
  ( once again ) pretty much the same with combat . 
  every time i smack or cut someone it is the very rewarding feeling because i can feel the weight and recoil of every hit . 
  yay you know how i feel !, 
  ( i must say this once again ) ... 
  but damn the combat execution is so awesome , even the little thing such as opening the hidden blades feels so satisfying almost as if you felt how fast they come out and then feel the recoil of them going back in . 
  edit : for me , acr was the weakest of all ac . 
  the only thing holding it was the altair storyline and the rest was just awful . 
  true , but in terms of aesthetics connor looks the best imo . 
  did you play all the ac series ? 
  i also enjoyed gameplay in the forest area ( frontier ) . 
  but it would like to perform asssassination missions from a fucking tree and stuff like that . 
  that area had so much potential but i do n't recall anything exciting to do there except some forts . 
  wow , pretty much everyone ( including me ) loves ac2 and it 's always the best ac in the series . 
  next one is probably black flag though ... 
  that 's from the / g / `` humor '' thread haha, 
  yes , it 's f2p so the only thing you 're gon na loose if you do n't like the game is time . 
  my / tera folder is 32,9 gb . 
  star wars jedi knight jedi academy , servers are still alive . 
   since i noticed the level up icon, 
  that 's the problem . 
  after you get the level up icon , your bonuses will be set and you ca n't change them no matter how many skills you level . 
  edit : so for future you should make sure that you get 10 level ups of whatever skill related to the attribute you want before you get 10 major skill levelups . 
  oh god do n't even get me started on this because 10000 chars limit is n't enough . 
  ( not that i dislike the game , i just have a fuckton of stuff to say ), 
  i will go have sex and talk dirty , maybe something like `` yeah you like that , you fucking retard ? '', 
  and i still have n't got boots from rehm after 50 runs . 
  all aboard the eu hype train . 
  i like this one , because it is n't any specific class . 
  youtube comments are cancer anyway i 've given up long ago . 
  overhand strike , overhand strike , overhand strike !, 
  hated mayo as a kid and worshipped ketchup . 
  now mayo is love , mayo is life . 
   ` [ spoiler label ] ( #s `` spoiler goes here '' ) `, 
  you need to sacrifice several virgins and then put them in a \u5350 shape in hopes of rngesus answering your call . 
  i find this incredibly retarded how peasants think their system is made from different hardware which magically at $ 400 outputs better graphics than most powerful pc . 
  while in reality they have just a shitty underclocked gpu . 
  if you want to copy someone 's skills bar then you 're at a bad start . 
  you need to find keybindings that best work for you . 
  my mom :, 
  `` look at all those games installed on your pc that 's why the internet has problems because it tries to connect to your computer but all those games just clutter it up and it ca n't connect . '', 
  as long as it is unreadable , who gives a fuck ? 
  so you 're telling me to buy a proprietary expensive program just to make a black rectangle ? 
  kid wait until your balls drop instead of trying to act cool on the internet . 
  this never fails to entertain me . 
  thank you for doing this op < 3, 
  edit : my profile [ here ] ( http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrsnowshow/ ), 
  yep . 
  bf3 was the reason i installed origin despite never playing any fps . 
  but hd is only 720p :(, 
  should be full hd or 4k, 
  that ` manjaro ` at the end of the kernel version, 
  i would like fallout 3 goty . 
  thanks for this awesome opportunity . 
   i guess high definition is just a word used by merchants to sell you `` best of all time '' . 
  i know this . 
  but since we are master race we know that hd is 720p , full hd is 1080p and ultra hd is 2160p ( 4k ) . 
  anyway you have done no ricing whatsoever ... why bother posting ? 
   i voted ` remove ' on most of them, 
  why ? 
  that 's kinda selfish when people need help and you just remove their post . 
  it 's not like it 's a very big sub and there 's a shitload of content ... 
  i 'm pretty sure that 1st ~ ~ salvo ~ ~ rapid fire hit staggers in pvp so it 's not entirely useless . 
  edit : it was rapid fire, 
  thanks i corrected it . 
  if you do decide to remove most of the posts , then you 'll need a good wiki page to redirect them . 
  still have a lot work to do . 
  for example the info bar has useless info and you have n't changed color scheme of terminals . 
  it 's even worse than le niengag . 
  [ punchcat ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/skyrim/comments/mmu6f/the_tale_of_punchcat_the_punching_khajiit/ ), 
  you 've come right at the time of a new level 65 patch btw . 
  there are n't any pay to win items at the cash shop but rather pay 2 progress faster and get gold ( since you can sell tt/eme to other players ) . 
  however , there 's a big controversy regarding level 65 cash shop because the new +15 system as far as we know is retarded and very hard to get but that is another topic and we 'll have to wait to see when the patch goes live . 
  and yes , there are xp boosts but no level boosts .
