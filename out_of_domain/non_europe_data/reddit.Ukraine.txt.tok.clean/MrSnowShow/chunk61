  what is this about censored elin outfits ? 
  story ? 
  i 'm gon na need a sauce on that . 
   proof that he exists ? 
  ftfy, 
  that 's a fallacy . 
  but anyway : nobody has ever seen god , and there are no evidence of any of his doings . 
  so it 's natural to assume that he does n't exist . 
  / r/three21chromosomes, 
  ~ ~ got some bad news for you , look at the date at [ this post ] ( http://en.tera.gameforge.com/news/detail/fate-of-arun-pre-patch-available ) . ~ ~, 
  oh fuck , the damn m/d/y screwed me again . 
  i though it was 12/12/14 on the banner . 
  . xdefaults i believe, 
  i actually made up that sub only to discover it actually exists o :, 
  so you 're talking about pve here ... slayer was always good in pve so these buffs will make him even better . 
  also double dodge does n't directly buff damage , but it 's sometimes the difference between getting kd ` ed or simply continuing with your dps rotation . 
  why you 're selling your rig ? 
  oh i see , i though you were leaving the master race \\ ^ ^, 
  thanks for doing this op . 
  i will take anything . 
  you did n't load the images for some reason . 
  light looks better imo . 
  just as / u/furin and / u/spaghetticatt said , the css theme breaks if you use it it any other language than english due to some ` html [ lang = `` en '' ] ` code and it will be fixed next week . 
  you can use http://en.reddit.com/r/teraonline if you want or simply change language to english . 
  how is it possible that every brother has this game except me ? 
  fallout 3 goty if possible . 
  thank you op < 3, 
  because rehm is full of retards . 
  but kde sucks and uses alot of memory :(, 
  can you explain me how to distro jump effectively ? 
  and then when installing new distro just do n't mess with the / home partitition right ? 
  same shit as [ watch_doges ] ( http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/05/12/watch-dogs-on-ps4-confirmed-to-run-at-1080p-60fps ), 
  oh and those good graphics shown would have been possible if these series were n't ps4 exclusive ... 
  100 % reflect damage and 100 % spell absorb < -- i 've done this one . 
  i would n't say that the class is hard to play , but has a high skillcap instead . 
  ( atleast in pvp , because you have a skill that has little to none counterplay and from there you 're free to do your full combo . 
  while most other classes can get counterplayed when they 're trying to setup for a combo ), 
  you 're missing cascade which is important on the stun rotation and probably missing the backstab glyph for longer duration . 
  basically you ts/cyclone into vampiric strike and use staggering + flatten whenever avaliable ( followed by ts if you have the glyph to speed it up ) . 
  and with the new 65 skills you should also use auto + thundering takedown whenever you can , think of it as a staggering + flatten 2.0 ( and again , followed by ts if you use the glyph to speed it up ) . 
  about esmash , you can use it a lot as a dodge where your block wo n't work ( ex : rehm quake , it will make you look like a pro ) , if you are on the front of the boss then use esmash to get a back hit or to close the gap if the boss runs away or something . 
  and you should pretty much rebuff when avaliable , but try to have atleast fiery rage and flurry of blows together so you get more advantage of the increased atack speed . 
  ( i 'm playing on eu we got 65 patch already and i just wanted to say that new flurry of blows gets 40 % atack speed which is fucking awesome < 3 ) . 
  edit : if you follow these steps and crit alot you will stop being a dps and become a tank instead and you can proceed to brag to your raid how good you are . 
  wow i wanted this one since forever , thanks for doing this op . 
  oh i see you 're doing one of the best quests in gaming ... 
  use the 100 % xp boost and go kill 20 teraliths and spam sabex and catacombs . 
  they 're definitely harder . 
  complete crystalbinds are a must if you 're learning . 
  rg after 2nd-3rd run you 're kinda feel like a pro but if you get caugh it 's gon na hurt , and alot . 
  br i just cleared once and today i had a fail group so they all left and i wasted a clear . 
  i feel like we have a bit underpowered gear . 
  but also due to it being a 5 man , it 's much more noticeable when somebody is playing poorly . 
  more personal is that as a zerker there 's alot of unblockable shit . 
  the last rg bird boss , if he headbutts me ( which is a normal attack ) it just one shots me through my block , like wtf ? 
  i 'm not a fucking warrior ninja dodger and my only defense is unreliable , same thing with the 1st br boss the acid circle or the kamikazes at last sabex armory boss . 
  i know that i can leaping strike , esmash and lethal strike and i do use those but i feel like my block is just unreliable . 
  oh and the drop rates suck balls . 
  where do i get that box ? 
  how do you get 3 bars like that ? 
  crystals, 
  focused, 
  forceful, 
  savage, 
  and for armor 4x anarchic . 
  vice city was my first gta . 
  what i love about it is the radio it 's fucking great . 
  i was a little kid and all i did was nutertools cheat code and go kill people \\ ^ ^, 
  oh god i remember playing only tanker mission because i was scared of vamp so i never got past sector b. 
  that music ... 
  ah the blyat . 
  you can use that anywhere you want , even as a comma . 
  i have +12 deva axe +9 armor and +9 patron boots . 
  it 's probably lack of defense since the new oculus 2 gives more defense than my deva +9 , but i 'm a bit hesitant to use oculus because i miss alot of attack . 
  also , happy cake day . 
  yes it works as hotkeys too . 
  also , here 's a handy guide about chained skill i found :, 
  ### chain skills guide, 
  do n't, 
  a tip for you na players , buy complete crystalbinds if you like your money . 
  oh and a cool thing is that now there 's a all monsters damage reduction crystal called hardy , so there 's no longer stalwart for normal and anarchic for bams . 
  what the fuck did you just fucking say about me , you little bitch ? 
  i 'll have you know i graduated top of my class in the navy seals , and i 've been involved in numerous secret raids on al-quaeda , and i have over 300 confirmed kills . 
  i am trained in gorilla warfare and i 'm the top sniper in the entire us armed forces . 
  you are nothing to me but just another target . 
  i will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this earth , mark my fucking words . 
  you think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the internet ? 
  think again , fucker . 
  as we speak i am contacting my secret network of spies across the usa and your ip is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm , maggot . 
  the storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life . 
  you 're fucking dead , kid . 
  i can be anywhere , anytime , and i can kill you in over seven hundred ways , and that 's just with my bare hands . 
  not only am i extensively trained in unarmed combat , but i have access to the entire arsenal of the united states marine corps and i will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent , you little shit . 
  if only you could have known what unholy retribution your little `` clever '' comment was about to bring down upon you , maybe you would have held your fucking tongue . 
  but you could n't , you did n't , and now you 're paying the price , you goddamn idiot . 
  i will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it . 
  you 're fucking dead , kiddo . 
  wow .
