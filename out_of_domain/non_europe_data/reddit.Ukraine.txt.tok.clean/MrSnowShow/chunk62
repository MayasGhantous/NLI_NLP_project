  what bams ? 
  last patch i got them from tot and nt only ... 
  the new voa has kezzel . 
  not exactly `` kezzel '' himself but they look the same , i 'm not sure about the attack patterns because i 've never done kg . 
  while i do agree that youtube comments are cancer , ** sometimes ** a funny one comes up . 
  thing is that we should downvote the general ones ( 30fps is more cinematic ) and upvote those that are different . 
  the problem is n't only the posters but most community too because they keep upvoting the low effort ones . 
  so what we have to do is simply downvote the low effort that we 've all seen and only the hilarious/unexpected/funny / different . 
  about the css :, 
  the `` teraonline '' next to snoo looks bad there . 
  you could make it xx-large font , transparent color and move it where `` tera fate of arun '' is so it 's clickable on the `` tera fate of arun '' area . 
  or simply remove it and make the banner clickable instead . 
  typical bethesda . 
  fallout 3 was also a memorable one . 
  skyrim has repeatable quests and stuff , oblivion does n't . 
  but oblivion 's quests are much more memorable and the journal feels much more `` roleplay-y '', 
  yup . 
  ** stop !, 
  you violated my mother !, 
  this reminds of my teacher in a tech class :, 
  * `` have you tried skyrim online ? 
  but jokes aside , what you have to do in that mission ? 
  i love this copypasta , very related . 
  ** oblivion : ** some women are robbing and blackmailing married men . 
  i need you to find the suspects , let them try to seduce you , and catch them in the act . 
  ** skyrim : ** some women are robbing and blackmailing married men . 
  i need you to go into this dungeon full of draugr and kill them . 
  ** oblivion : ** these ghosts are haunting my ship . 
  here 's a silver sword . 
  can you kill them for me ? 
  ** skyrim : ** these ghosts are haunting my ship . 
  here 's the location of a dungeon full of draugr . 
  go and find an item from there to help me drive them away . 
  ** oblivion : ** climb into the well out back and fetch me a ring that sunk to the bottom . 
  jokes on you !, 
  that ring is going to make you drown . 
  ** skyrim : ** a bandit stole my ring , man . 
  can you go into this dungeon and get it back for me ? 
  oh , and watch out for the draugr . 
  ** oblivion : ** guess what ? 
  you 're trapped on an island where hunters hunt people for fun , and you 're the prey . 
  have fun !, 
  ** skyrim : ** some guy is running a game on an island where people hunt other people for fun . 
  word has it he 's in a dungeon nearby looking for treasure to fund his game . 
  go and kill him . 
  what ? 
  you want to see this game for yourself ? 
  nonsense , the dungeon will be far more convenient . 
  off you go . 
  try not to trip over any draugr . 
  another thing i dislike is the journal . 
  it 's written in 3rd person ( not sure ) and does n't have anything worth reading . 
  but oblivion 's journal is really nice and the `` diiing '' sound that it makes it 's like magic . 
  no , that 's retarded . 
  you could also add how long it 's been ( 1 year , x months , x days ... ), 
  ca n't rice on iphone . 
  also hate apple 's philosophy regarding their products : restricted , dumbed down , overpriced ... 
  nice 2clocks that you get there . 
  i 'm on mobile but search in yt for `` 10 second tera clip '' . 
  i would suggest you to not pug into br ... 
  it seems like they want us to buy cosmetic items ... 
  [ math homework ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/youdontsurf/comments/2f0x0j/math_homework/ ), 
  [ harold tries his luck as a drug dealer ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/youdontsurf/comments/2gz40s/harold_tries_his_luck_as_a_drug_dealer/ ), 
  always makes me laugh, 
  [ too much information ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/youdontsurf/comments/2jz8sn/too_much_information/ ), 
  yep . 
  the guy makes some fair points . 
  despite the braindead grind , i still kept playing just for the combat . 
  never had i so much fun in a mmo before . 
  yes , i 'm quite happy that in this patch you actually require some brainpower . 
  also by being a 5-man , it 's more noticeable when someone 's playing poorly . 
  what exactly is your problem ? 
  you can pretty much block everything ( you must iframe the dive , and i think that 's it ) . 
  source : 7 runs as a zerk ( gon na be 9 today ) . 
  any dps for sure . 
  but a leather class would be nice so each of you are a different armor type . 
  i went with eu because allematheia is the sexiest city . 
  ah dragon nest , such a nice game but once i got to level 45 and chosen my path i quit . 
  the game 's kinda confusing and deorganized imo . 
  i would love to have fallout 3 ** goty ** . 
  thanks for everyone who 's gifting games , that 's very nice ( :, 
  i fish linux . 
  \\  ever, 
  problem is that you might waste a run , and that sucks : / . 
  if i had time i would do teaching runs and explain people stuff but i do n't ... 
  at the new faction vendor , just go into the trading post it 's easy to find . 
  no idea i never done those dailies . 
  this one is a faceroll dungeon . 
  br in depth would be useful . 
  strikeforce 3, 
  just a question . 
  if brnm drops patron 2 , brhm drops deva 2 then why we need both eanm and hm ? 
  what drops will be in those two ? 
  do n't have any questions about warriors because i do n't like them . 
  i just wanted to stay that it would be nice if we could get something other than rookie and skilled because it 's just way too inaccurate . 
  why not showing exact number of runs or give more ranks like :, 
  rookie 0-5, 
  kinda rookie 5-10, 
  experienced 10-20, 
  skilled 20-30,
