   gaming is a hobby and telling someone to grow out, 
  you misunderstood me , i did n't say `` grow out of those stupid games '' , i said that he 'll probably grow out of gaming eventually sooner or later . 
  * chatting, 
  * practicing guitar, 
  * reddit and / g /, 
  that ruins what arch really is ... 
   mine also quickly extracts to temp . 
  you 're talking about winrar right ? 
  `` oooohhh a big shiny download button . 
  that must be it '', 
  downloading freemovies.exe ? 
  `` toolbars ? 
  yes please . '', 
  `` 24-7 pro pc guard anti virus ? 
  oh nice , now i must be safe '', 
  edit : fuck just realized i replied to a 2 week old comment . 
  same thing with the phone app image is of the old ones . 
  vsauce had a video on this . 
  what image viewer are you using ? 
  i 'm using the windows ' default one and it does n't work . 
  well , for me it does n't work : /, 
  it 's because you installed ubuntard to him . 
  if you installed gentoo/arch then it would have been a different story . 
   but i always assumed that most of pc gamers were people of my generation ( something between 30 and 40 ), 
  how 's that ? 
  90 % of people here built their rig for gaming . 
  and i 'm pretty sure that teenagers do much more gaming than adult men . 
  the downvotes are probably mostly for saying `` ubuntard '' . 
  i read your thread . 
  the problem is that your post there does n't make any sense and you 're kinda forcing loonix right in front of everyone 's face . 
  so yeah that 's why i think that post was n't successful . 
   try to keep it simple, 
  it 's pretty much console ( windows ) vs pc ( linux ) but for the os . 
  yellow = ~ ~ blue ~ ~ red + green, 
  this means that your rig will be environmental friendly while also being ~ ~ * cool * ~ ~ faster but heating more . 
  but downside is that the ~ ~ cooling is n't as good as pure blue ~ ~ performance boost is n't as good as pure red and environmental friendliness is n't as good as pure green . 
  edit : in rgb , red + green is yellow . 
  ~ ~ but if you remember how you drew in elementary school , you probably remember mixing blue and green for yellow . ~ ~, 
  edit2 : i give up with the color combinations, 
  white = red + green + blue \\ :d, 
  that 's what i studied with rgb and hex colors . 
  oh crap i confused with how i did in elementary school with painting, 
   dude , why create hate within the community ? 
  i do n't want to . 
  but ubuntu by being so popular is starting to behave just like proprietary software by collecting user information without their knowledge and stuff, 
  okay , i see that i 'm a complete retard haha . 
  artistic primary colors are yellow magenta and cyan or whatever right ? 
  that 's it , i 'm done with guessing colors then \\ ^ ^, 
  yea , the `` real life '' ones are cyan yellow and magenta and computer 's are rgb . 
  \\  gtfo newfag these boards are 18 +, 
  i do n't dislike ubuntu per se , i just do n't like what decisions they have made which makes them look closer to our proprietary `` enemies '', 
  i think yesterday a `` who is pcmr '' survey results were show . 
  16-18 was the most dominant age ... 
  i searched around if this was posted before , and it was n't . 
  yea , somebody already referenced that in the comments . 
  it 's probably a background for some `` ricing '' ( customizing ) guide hence the rice background . 
  [ here 's the full version  ( http://i.imgur.com/x2ft7bc.jpg ), 
  combat system, 
  character models and pretty much the `` world '' despite not being rich in lore and other shit , i think it 's aesthetically pleasing to look at and explore ( allematheia is sexy , scythera fae is too ) . 
  i love how you can go questing into a desert , passing between jungles , hellish lands , beaches , forests , mutated lands , tundra and icy , etc etc. . . 
  it 's one of the boards from 4chan . 
  / g / is for technology . 
  \\  being a leddit fag, 
  \\  not considering euthanasia, 
  not only that . 
  but generally speaking skyrim 's quest feel much more generic than oblivion 's . 
  read rest of comments i think i posted here a nice copy pasta showing how skyrim would handle oblivion 's quests . 
  i do not want any game because flair but ty for doing this op !, 
  ubuntu was released in october 2004 fyi, 
  for no apparent reason i do n't enjoy gaming anymore as i did like 2 years ago . 
  i launch a game and after 5 minutes i 'm already bored and do n't want to play anymore . 
  yeah you like that , you fucking retard ? 
  yep , on 4chan everything happens at real time . 
  for example , i post this and go to sleep and at morning i 'll maybe have a reply , i ca n't do that on 4chan because the thread 404s by then probably . 
   what is your high school crush doing ? 
  not me, 
  used to hate mayo and praise ketchup , now it 's the other way around . 
  i feel like mayo has a `` smoother '' taste while ketchup is kinda more `` aggressive '' . 
  there are several problems with this, 
  yt comment, 
  kid, 
  being posted here, 
  giving attention to kid ( counts twice ), 
  seriously stop giving attention to obvious retards . 
  sadly this happens to a lot of subs after getting 200-300k subscribers : /, 
  oh that reminded me why i do n't browse / v /, 
  i do n't understand this ... [ osx is a descendant of unix ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/unix#mediaviewer/file:unix_history-simple.svg ) . 
  while gnu/linux is ** unix-like ** , osx ** is ** unix . 
  i stopped gaming involuntarily for already a week or something ( games are boring ) and i 'm thinking of going full-time loonix and deleting my wangblows partition . 
  the a shitfuckington of stars in the observable universe and probably a fuckton of more that we have no idea that exist . 
  so it 's almost 100 % that there is a particular star with planets orbiting around and one or more of them is on a habitable zone . 
  also there are a lot exoplanets being discovered in ** our ** galaxy that are in the potential habitable zone , one that i remember top of my head is gliese 581c ( or 581g ) . 
  even here in the solar system , europa ( one of jupiter 's moon ) has a big layer of ice and probably water under it . 
  * cough * yarr !!!, 
  * cough * ^ ^ ^ ^ pirate * cough *, 
  it kinda reminds me of the ending in fight club where it had infiltrated everywhere and pretty much everyone was a member . 
  any sauce ? 
  that 's sounds just way too much . 
  thanks for sharing your story , i kinda feel the same regarding to no motivation but i 'm trying to fix it . 
  i 'm 18 and i 've quit gaming without trying .
