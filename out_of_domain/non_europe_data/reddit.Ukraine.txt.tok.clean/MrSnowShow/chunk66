  did this happen to somebody else ? 
  basically i just started enjoying gaming less and less so i gradually reduced my playing time until the point where i played like 10-15 minutes of tf2 for like once every three days and now i stopped completely . 
  i feel a bit with extra time but i do n't feel the need of playing games to fill it . 
  find another hobby . 
  some things that interest me are :, 
  * guitar, 
  * magic tricks, 
  * butterfly knife flipping, 
  * gymnastics, 
  and i fill my time with those rather than gaming . 
  that 's why in 4chan and other chans you can find , under some retarded shit posted by teens to feel cool , quality discussions because anonymity is great for that . 
  you got it wrong there mate , here 's the formula :, 
  did that came out of your ass ? 
  what i hate in this sub is how there 's a lot of apple bullshitting . 
  should be focusing more on android . 
  i think what you truly want is changing looks . 
  you should have written `` what de should i try '', 
  because what changes between distros is basicallt the package manager , repos and pre-installed shit . 
  terminal is the real power of linux . 
   usa 's economy has gone to shit, 
  wow , try living in a 2 ^ nd world country where everyday is a struggle to survive and you 're always facing challenges everyday . 
  going to a job and not receiving your pay for months , now that shit is crazy . 
  2 clock, 
  useless text under icons, 
  pretty much stock stuff, 
  boring wallpaper, 
  weird icon pack because the icons do n't seem to have an uniform look . 
  text under icons is like `` yo dawg '' and just unnecessary bloat , have you tried turning them off for a while and seeing how they look ? 
  you can hide the notification bar so you do n't have redundant info . 
  gestures master race . 
  i 'm using double tap for the app launcher it 's much better than having the icon . 
  well if you disable the notification bar it will only hide when you 're on homescreen and reappear if you launch and app , go into app drawer , when your phone is locked , slide down , etc. . 
  i 'd suggest you try it just to see if you really need it , because from my personal experience i do not need the notification bar when i 'm on my homescreen . 
  if i want to see if i have a notification my phone is probably locked so i just use a button and if there 's a notification i unlock my phone and slide down . 
  also i 'm pretty sure we all actually use apps and stuff so the notification bar is always there , it only hides when on the home screen and i 'm pretty sure nobody stares long enough on their home screen to be needing the notification bar . 
  as for the icon pack , one 's that are colorful that i remember on top of my head are [ luxx ] ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.daeva112.iconpack.luxx&amp;hl=en ) which is very `` not minimalistic '' and [ rounded up ] ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.uppack.roundedup&amp;hl=en ) which is more minimalistic . 
  edit : i just saw that you removed the clock on notification bar . 
  not a fan because i need the notification bar when i 'm on apps and stuff , i just have it disabled all together when on home scree only . 
  i 'd just like to interject for a moment . 
  what you 're referring to as linux , is in fact , gnu/linux , or as i 've recently taken to calling it , gnu plus linux . 
  linux is not an operating system unto itself , but rather another free component of a fully functioning gnu system made useful by the gnu corelibs , shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full os as defined by posix . 
  many computer users run a modified version of the gnu system every day , without realizing it . 
  through a peculiar turn of events , the version of gnu which is widely used today is often called `` linux '' , and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the gnu system , developed by the gnu project . 
  there really is a linux , and these people are using it , but it is just a part of the system they use . 
  linux is the kernel : the program in the system that allocates the machine 's resources to the other programs that you run . 
  the kernel is an essential part of an operating system , but useless by itself ; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system . 
  linux is normally used in combination with the gnu operating system : the whole system is basically gnu with linux added , or gnu/linux . 
  all the so-called `` linux '' distributions are really distributions of gnu/linux . 
   the clock is only disabled in nova launcher and is present in every other app . 
  it 's a feature that requires root access . 
  i 'd use nova because it 's kinda better than apex ( i heard it has better performance , the settings menu is nicer , has a nice wallpaper setter ) but i can only get the free version , and gestures are only available on paid version but on apex gestures are included in the free version . 
  i 'm pretty sure it 's just a compilation of richard stallman 's speeches and writings, 
  [ here are parts of it at the gnu official site ] ( https://gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu ), 
  definitely looks less bloated than original . 
  just another little thing you could hide is the little 3 dots that count the home screen pages since they 're practically useless . 
  ( and maybe the google bar , i personally do not use it so there 's no reason for it to be there ), 
  so yeah that 's pretty much is a more `` debloated '' look . 
  from that point it 's all about having the perfect widgets/wallpaper/icon pack combo and trying to make them all fit into a `` theme '' . 
  but that 's my opinion of a nice looking home screen . 
  [ here are a few home screens that i saved because i really liked how they looked ] ( http://imgur.com/a/y3pbv ) ( the last one just needs a notification bar hiding ), 
  and i 'm not gon na downvote people for saying that it sucks because it 's their opinion . 
  looks like mint . 
  i think toothless is a fan of mint . 
  hah my hp also has the same bloat . 
  they even put a `` power management '' program which is basically the same window that you get when you click on the battery icon on the taskbar . 
  best is just to get a clean windows install and all the drivers . 
  that flair , reminds me of [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/kyoawdo.gif ), 
  big companies need to learn that you ca n't simply lie to the internet . 
  shoutout to / r/oblivion * wink * * wink *, 
  not true fix . 
  the problem is physical so a driver wo n't fix it totally . 
  i think it 's more than just raw performance . 
  a person probably with a single 1080p monitor wo n't be getting to 3.5 gb vram usage , so it 's maybe fine to them , at least for now . 
  but the thing is , we as customers should not be accepting this . 
  nvidia `` lied '' about their specs not only vram but also l2 cache and memory bus ? 
  ( not sure ) . 
  if nobody gave a fuck about that they would just keep ripping us off harder and harder each time . 
   it is the same performance you expected . 
  there 's nothing being taken away from your gpu . 
  once you go over the 3.5 gb vram usage , the performance drops . 
  so they kinda took 0.5 gb of vram which should not happen . 
   you get the performance that you see from the benchmarks before you bought the card . 
  this was only discovered recently , i 'm pretty sure a lot of people would n't buy if they knew about this vram issue . 
   so what if the specs were wrong ? 
  it was promised 4gb of vram , 64 rops and 2048 kb of l2 cache . 
  and in reality it 's all below that . 
  you as customer should not be accepting this because if you do , then they will continue to rip us off instead of delivering quality products . 
  that 's very similar to punchcat from skyrim . 
  where 's the one where op struck his dick with a toothpick ? 
  that 's because [ beats are shit ] ( https://wiki.installgentoo.com/images/7/7c/1335901596068.png ) . 
  tiling wm would be nice here . 
  tiling wms with little gaps look much nicer . 
  honestly all the conky stuff looks bad . 
  you also have redundant info ( for example , you have 2 cpu usage meters ) . 
  check / r/unixporn for some sexy loonicks desktops . 
  with little gaps even nicer . 
   edit : also , girls named jessica . 
  this is not the first time i hear this . 
  my ex is named jessica though ... 
  she was like `` you 've changed , i do n't want anybody now i 'm tired of relationships '' .
