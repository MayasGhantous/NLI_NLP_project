  * more armors , please bethesda !, 
  in these kind of games we want to look cool , so we should have a ton of armors to choose from and also variations of the same armor ( like fur armor in skyrim ), 
  * more weapons , where 's [ wakizashis ] ( http://images.uesp.net/c/c9/mw_weapons_wakizashis.jpg ) and [ tantos ] ( http://images.uesp.net/c/c7/mw_weapons_tantos.jpg ) ? 
  and throwable weapons ? 
  * world reacting to you , in oblivion you were always called hero of kvatch , champion of cyrodiil , arch-mage . 
  you had recognition . 
  but in skyrim no one would give a fuck . 
  i 'm the guild master for the thieves guild and vekel still goes * so you 're brynjolf 's new protege eh ? ... 
  i 'm the fucking guildmaster i made almost single handedly all of you rich and you do n't even react to it . 
  ** this one is huge issue , you need to be recognized for the things you have done . 
  and also bring back the rank system from oblivion . 
  also npc reactiion to what i 'm wearing , like i walk around in emperor 's robes and no one gives a fuck . 
  i just killed a dragon near a town and no one gives a fuck . 
  * stats should be also brought back , like intelligence , speed and all of those . 
  they also will be used for my point about dialogue :, 
  * races should be more strict on their pros and cons . 
  i know that some people love playing orc mage , but it should have consequences . 
  if you want to play wood elf two handed heavy armor barbarian you need to accept that wood elves will not be as effective as nords or orcs because of ** lore ** . 
  and your choice should reflect on npcs comment . 
  like if you 're a nord mage , other nords might comment about it like * paah !, 
  pick up real steel instead of puny elf magic . 
  you embarass us . 
  * and their disposition may get a bit lower . 
  * beast races should be more * beasty * . 
  for example not having the ability to wear boots because of beast legs but have increased running speed for khajiits . 
  and also claw damage should be a massive advantage . 
  * disposition should be brought back , if you do good things for the npc he will like you , if you steal from her , she should not want to talk to you unless you gain her trust again which should be hard . 
  and it will be also used in my next point :, 
  * dialogue options like in fallout , that only unlock if you have a certain amount of skill . 
  for example you 're discussing with your fellow thieves how to approach that house , if you for example have 50 sneak skill then you could advice him on how to approach the house without getting detected . 
  and also giving random advices to someone will increase their disposition towards you . 
  and also stats should be used in dialogue options . 
  if for example you are being lead with a friend to a trap in a quest , if you have high enough inteligence you could whisper to your friend that you see its a trap and plan somekind of move to get out of there . 
  ** vampirism and lycanthropy **, 
  * vampires should hate werewolves and vice-versa . 
  in dawnguard , why the fuck lord harkon would give his powerful ancient vampire blood to some fucking dog that he hates ? 
  * getting vampirism should n't cure you from lycanthropy and vice versa . 
  okay so maybe lord harkon accepts this dog and wants to give him vampire blood for saving his daughter . 
  but first you need to fucking find a cure and it should be no easy task . 
  the same applies to when you 're a vampire , you drink werewolf blood and magically get cured and become a werewolf . 
  * vampire lord and werewolf form should be able to interact with most objects to not feel like when you are in either form you 're locked down to only fighting, 
  * vampire lord and werewolf form should have proper scaling regardless of level , to be ** always ** reliable . 
  you have cons to having those powers so they should feel like ** real power ** and make you much stronger and basically when you transform you feel like a motherfucking badass ready to rip everyone to pieces . 
  ** combat **, 
  * being able to dodge , this would make playing a dagger wielding assassin much cooler . 
  * being able to use jump to add damage to your atack with a nice animation . 
  * unarmed skill to make monk-like chars possible . 
  * more finishers and more fluid transitions . 
  i ca n't count how many times i did a finisher and then just stood there for 3 seconds until the camera reset . 
  also the finishers should depend on your stats like if you have alot of strenght you would do finishers like some brute . 
  and if you have high agility , your finishers would look fast and all acrobatic and stuff . 
  * more advantages to not wearing armor . 
  of course armor is much better for protection against damage . 
  but unarmored should have increased speed , jump higher , better dodging , faster weapon swing . 
  ** magic **, 
  basically in skyrim they have like 1/4 of all the spells in previous elder scrolls, 
  * conjuration : wtf is with 5 creatures in vanilla game ? 
  conjuration needs way more creatures and bound armor and bound all weapons should be availiable . 
  bound weapons need to be effective late game , like bonus damage from your conjuration skill + current or max magicka + inteligence or something , ( of course it should be weaker than normal weapons but still viable later in the game . ), 
  * illusion : frenzy should be like in oblivion to be considered non-hostile . 
  with better ai , the illusion spells should function more fluently . 
  for example in skyrim i cast frenzy and then the frenzied dude goes to my position so i need to sneak away and only then he decides to kill his allies . 
  * destruction : scaling damage please . 
  and also weakness to shock fire frost and poison like in oblivion, 
  * alteration : i miss water-walking . 
  levitation could be also added here . 
  also open lock but not master level, 
  * ** staves ** should be powerful arctifacts to make them worth using . 
  should also be able to costumize it with diferent woods of various shapes . 
  * enchanting should n't be a pain in the ass to level like in skyrim . 
  * bring back spellmaking please, 
  * overall using spells should be somehow improved for it to be more fluid . 
  two handed battlemage in skyrim is a pain in the ass to play . 
  we need somekind of mechanic to easily change between magic and weapons . 
  * magic and combat should be balanced . 
  in oblivion magic totally raped melee and in skyrim magic is weaker . 
  we need to have everytime of combat balanced so we get to play how we want without feeling that it is over/underpowered . 
  ** factions **, 
  * oh god factions of skyrim ... 
  so dissapointing *, 
  * there should be multiple guilds for each type of character style . 
  like 3 or 4 guilds for each playstyle : necromancy , safe magic study guild , rogue type magic guild and vigillant of stendarr . 
  all of these for mage-type characters for example . 
  and they have alliances between each other and rivalty . 
  in this case safe magic study and vigilants of stendarr are against necromancers and rogue mages . 
  * the player should seek out on their own the guilds . 
  in oblivion to find the thieves guild you must have done a little research and have a good disposition towards some people . 
  in skyrim as soon as you enter riften brynjolf approaches you and thieves guild questline starts . 
  * the player should be able to betray or double agent any guild as long as he is being careful and or uses disguises and dialogue checks could help him out convincing that he is loyal to the guild . 
  also your actions within the guild should affect the opinion of other guild mates about you, 
  * once the player becomes the leader of the guild . 
  he should be able to affect the behavior of the guild . 
  example : you could make the thives guild like robin hood or make them greedy motherfuckers that rob everyone . 
  * being part of a guild should be rewarding . 
  for example warrior guilds would teach you new moves depending what did you join . 
  a barbarian guild would teach you brutish two handed moves while the archers guild would teach you a new technique to fire arrows faster . 
  * if you join a warrior guild and have a high skill of one.handed or two handed , the guild members should recognize your talent . 
  * there also should be restrictions , if you say participate in the arena you should n't be able to become a priest of dibella or whatever, 
  * speaking of the divines , they should be also contacting you and offer quests just like daedric princes , in sort of like angel vs devil fight . 
  ** there you go , 10 fucking thousand characters rant about how the next elder scrolls should be .
