  i think the problem is that once you gain 10 level ups from major skills , it stops counting the bonuses no matter how much you level up after receiving the message that you must sleep . 
  so what you must do is increasing minor skills and stuff and after you had 10 combined level ups for those 3 attributes , only then you can finish leveling your major skills to 10 times and sleep . 
  i 'm like op - dark elf . 
  * natural talent to magic and sneaking ( my favorite combination ), 
  * their land is harsh and considered alien by some, 
  * red eyes, 
  i 'm using bash because i 'm fairly new to linux but i 'll definitely give it a try . 
  hunger system is utter bullshit . 
  i ca n't just invite people to my server , because now i have 2-3 more mouths to feed regulary which gets annoying and minecraft always shits on me with animal spawns so it gets even worse . 
  while before the adventure update ( beta 1.8 ) if they were careful then we would n't waste food . 
  yes , i can feel it . 
  are you serious ? 
  almost every world i create there are no fucking animals , and if i some then it 's only one type of it . 
  gets really annoying . 
  lost it at `` it costs 9000 gold to unhear the shit you come up with '' . 
  oh and i think that 32 bit system can address maximum of 4gb instead of 2gb . 
  this was my problem as a kid , my parents restricted my playtime so whenever i played i just wanted to get shit done fast . 
  i even used ` movetoqt ` command :(, 
  pretty much every prebuilt computer comes with a shitload of bloat . 
  so my usual method for windows computers was to install a clean windows copy right away . 
  this depends if you want to use linux right away or if you want to learn linux . 
  if you 're like me that wants to learn linux ( a bit harder than usual - no de ) i 'd still recommend crunchbang ( why ? 
  because you will just use to to learn linux for a bit , although it stopping being developed , you wo n't stick with it for too long so it does n't matter ) . 
  learn how the terminal works , the syntax , how the config files work , the directories structure ( took me a while to figure out that ` ~ ` is ` / home / [ username ] / ` ) , check around for the shitload of choices you have with everything ( editors , wms , music players , etc ) install another wm , etc. . . and once you feel ready you can go ahead and install arch , not that big of a challenge in my opinion and play around with it . 
  that was my journey with linux , i 'm planning to later install gentoo when i learn arch more and then move to freebsd because teh unix roots . 
  ca n't find you colorscheme on github . 
  nice setup though, 
  i made the mistake to buy hp again and god so much bloat , it even had a `` hp power manager '' program which is basically just a reskinned windows ' popup manager that shows up when you click on the battery icon . 
  and all the `` hp support assistant '' and heavy bulky programs just to view an image `` hp image viewer '' or video that take forever to boot up . 
  it 's that type of music that if you wait a few months and then turn it on in public , people will give you that look of `` wtf are you listening to bro that 's so last year '', 
  just like gentoo is the official / g / distro , fedora should the official reddit distro . 
   what if you have plenty of ram ? 
  we still should not encourage poor optimization . 
  look at almost 90 % of aaa games nowadays , insanely high specs because of poor coding . 
   bitch , i ai n't got 8 gb of ram for nothing, 
  with this attitude we will end up with very bad coders and unefficient , memory leaking and unoptimized programs in the future ... just like aaa games nowadays that require insanely high specs and still perform poorly , guess why ... 
  i 'm not talking about you specifically . 
  i 'm saying that if this trend continues , we are looking at poorly optimized programs/spaghetti programming in the future and this should not be okay . 
   sli 970, 
   ** sli **, 
  enjoy 3.5 gb of vram . 
  no seriously , one 970 is fine ( for now ) on a 1080p monitor because games do n't reach 3.5 gb of vram usage , but if you sli ( i 'm assuming you playing higher res or multimonitor ) then games will reach 3.5 gb and you 're gon na have a bad time . 
  you do not seem to understand what i said , but whatever sorry if i 'm rude but i think you 're underage a bit no point in continuing this . 
  wow this sub is filled with fanboy retards who ca n't even think for a second . 
  you sound just like console peasants right now . 
  `` lol i do n't care if i have to pay for online and expensive games '', 
  `` lol i do n't care if the card does n't deliver full 4 gb of vram , please nvidia next time give me a half assed unfinished card i love it . '', 
  i 'm not a fanboy but i 'd hate to see in the future shitty cards instead of quality ones . 
  well ... because you 're thinking about it . 
  same thing with the nose , it 's always there but your brain ignores it . 
  once you realize this then it is noticeable . 
  since the amd chip is going to be 3 years old this year , i think it 's safer to go with intel . 
  i remember some dude here in reddit ( maybe / r/tifu ) that always came 2 hours later to his job for years so he worked 6h instead of 8 . 
  pretty nice . 
  gpu, 
   unlocked cpu + aftermarket cooler but h mobo, 
   cpu $ 200 and gpu for $ 120 why ? 
  pretty bad choices you made : /, 
  am i the only one that hates hardware labeled as `` gaming '' ? 
  if you 're going high end on everything might aswell get a better psu . 
  the cx series are budget . 
  that is now , but what about a few years ? 
  it is n't futureproof, 
  you have to upgrade the big 3 . 
  cpu , mobo and gpu ( spend most of your money here if all you do is vidya ) . 
  a ~ $ 170 cpu then some ~ $ 90 mobo and rest on gpu and you 're good . 
  companies logic :, 
  free advertising of our products , we better ban it because it violates our copyrights '' *, 
  i think you need some / r/teslore \\ ^ ^, 
  that is n't the symbol of `` skyrim '' but it 's the symbol of the empire and the dragon is akatosh , it 's also present behind every septim . 
  basically team red is more `` ethically '' correct and not greedy . 
  has 4chan already leaked to reddit with top kek ? 
  i love vampirism , but purely because of roleplay . 
  well and then there are the elins , which is a double edged sword , some love them some hate . 
  i 'm not a weeb , ( tried to get into anime several times but could n't ) but a little girl with huge axe is both hilarious and fun . 
  / r/tif, 
  i can understand why , most of them want to play gaymes so why would they bother with linux if windows got all of their games ? 
  updates in linux : yay !, 
  updates on windows : oh no not again, 
  ah a real / g/entooman . 
  i actually saved your desktop a while back because it looked nice . 
  how do those applets work ? 
  could i make something like that on bar-aint-recursive ? 
  there are three ways that i remember . 
  one is using an ayleid stone which will recharge all your magic equipment that you possess in your inventory . 
  the second one by using filled soul gems , bigger souls = more enchantment restore . 
  to capture a soul you must first possess an empty soul gem , then cast a soul trap spell on the monster and kill it while it 's still under the soul trap effect . 
  npc souls not even a grand soul gem can capture , for those you need something else ... ( not gon na ruin it for you ) . 
  and the third one is the one you discovered which is talking to specific people from the mages guild who offer that service in exchange of gold . 
  in short : at the end of quest ( aka when you receive it ) . 
  you can check [ here ] ( http://www.uesp.net/wiki/oblivion:leveled_items ) to see all the leveled rewards . 
  if anyone here is on pc there 's a mod called [ quest award leveler ] ( http://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/5701/ ? 
  ) , which does exactly what it is called - levels the items once you reach the appropriate level . 
   some guy came to me in the middle of my sleep , and i think i might follow him down this new rabbit hole . 
  that is one of the best decisions you make in oblivion , on my first playthrough i killed that guy because i was a little kid and was afraid haha . 
  about my character , i wish i had the creativity like most of you rpg guys but basically my character is just a lonely wanderer , he tries to keep social contact to a minimum and enjoys the nights more than days , that 's why when he contracted porphyric hemophilia he let it consume him because it would just benefit him more . 
  his ways of combat are stealthy and magical , he enjoys cutting throats with his dagger as much as blowing up several people with his multi-element spell . 
  it 's not `` shadows '' by the way ... they say :, 
  shadow hide you,
