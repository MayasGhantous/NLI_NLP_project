  i had no idea about that , i 'll add this to the wiki page . 
  i 'll start off by saying that you must include an empty line in between paragraphs in order to switch lines [ enter ] [ enter ], 
  like so . 
   side note , i am extremely debuffed , working on solving that now . 
  this is copied from our [ faq ] ( http://reddit.com/r/oblivion/wiki/index/faq ) :, 
  oblivion has what 's called a ` leveling problem ' . 
  in oblivion , most enemies spawn from leveled lists , or their gear does , or their stats are tied to the player level . 
  what this means is that as you level up , your enemies level up with you and the game will remain at around the same base difficulty the entire game . 
  in the vanilla game this is managed with ` efficient leveling ' , or by turning down the difficulty slider . 
  ` efficient leveling ' entails earning as many bonuses as you can , as fast as you can , and keeping your level as low as possible ; this may require a fair amount of note-taking and counting and can be tedious and ruin the experience for you . 
  it 's far easier to manage the leveling problem with mods , however , like [ this one ] ( http://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/2691/ ? ), 
  which takes away the need to take any notes for your level up bonuses . 
  also , ` [ spoiler label ] ( #s `` spoiler goes here '' ) `, 
  if the boss suddenly turns around 180 degrees then it 's much easier for zerks to reach boss 's back rather than archers . 
  ty for being an active mod < 3, 
  / r/4chan is like a filter so you do n't have to browse through / b / 's filth . 
  i do not have a wide vocabulary ( not native speaker either ) but i really like the expression `` per se '' which means `` by itself '' . 
  so awakening is entirely asthetetical ? 
  i have friends that work in mcdonald 's , they say that when the customer is rude they spit on the hamburger ... 
  check the [ / g / wiki ] ( https://wiki.installgentoo.com/index.php/gentoo#funtoo_linux ) page about gentoo it has a comparison might be useful . 
  show bspwm some love too, 
  windowses have always been in good - bad - good - bad cycle . 
  xp - good, 
  vista - bad, 
  7 - good, 
  8 - bad, 
  theoretical 9 - good, 
  10 - bad, 
  so basically they skipped the good windows ... 
  ( pls do n't take this seriously ), 
  i wish i knew what the hell is exactly windows update doing , the installation process is fucking slow and needs multiple reboots . 
  seriously what is happening during the updates ? 
  linux is very simple, 
  you see the download bar and you see steady installation process and you 're aware what it 's doing . 
  but wangblows freezes for no reason on random updates and when they fail it just gets stuck for hours etc etc. . . 
  hmm weird , i 'm no linux expert but i got it working first try no problems , all you have to do is copy the ` bspwmrc ` and ` sxhkdrc ` example files to the correct directory , and add ` sxhkd ` and ` bspw ` to ` . xinitrc ` and the base system works fine . 
  what about ` packer ` ? 
   need to grow out, 
  i 'm not saying that gaming is bad , i simply think that most people eventually loose interest in gaming as they grow older and find other hobbies . 
  and it 's a fact that most gamer 's age is around teens and early twenties . 
   should i convert ? 
  you should convert whenever you feel like . 
  you will be the one using the computer , not us . 
  this is like 90 % of `` gaymen '' builds nowadays ... 
  why even bother posting if this is pure stock ? 
  the sub here is mostly wallpaper whoring but you manages to do even worse . 
  bspwm uses ` sxhkd ` for keybindings and it 's pretty easy to use . 
  i still have his dwm desktop saved . 
  the one with the ` implying.c ` program . 
  ( tips ) fedora , the official reddit distro . 
  just wondering , all you have to do is ` sudo pacman - s compton ` and transparency will work or do you have do something else ? 
  weird , a bare archlinux install had the lid closing working out of the box for me . 
  do n't use mint if you 're jew though . 
  mint 's boss is quite open about his hatred on jews . 
  you need to add bar to ` ~ / . xinitrc `,

  shit i read that wrong . 
  i 'm on mobile and multitasking on this piece of shit is mission impossible but it 's a 5 second google search away from you . 
  ` lugormod.tk ` is a server with insta level 40 . 
  check it out . 
  not as much as some years ago obviously but there are still quite a few servers and it 's totally worth checking out . 
  jawa is celebrating 10 years for example ... 
  last time i played on ` lugormod.tk ` it was kinda active , but also more noobs because the server is one of the first on the list . 
  and recently there were faction wars and stuff so it was kinda busy . 
  i heard of them but did n't play on their servers . 
  also of those names i remember `` luffy '' he was kinda my `` buddy '' on the mystic forces server , and i recently saw him on the ` lugormod.tk ` server by the way ... so he 's still active i guess . 
  yeah when i first met him he was using binds to change the color of his skin and blades around so he was like blue for 10 seconds then green then yellow xd , it was stylish . 
  he was owning everybody but when we fough it were long battles and were maybe 55-45 fights and then we became `` allies '' . 
  it was fun . 
  pick ** one ** of the above, 
  just remove all the rainmeter crap and it will look nice . 
  i did n't : /, 
  tfw 2500k is still an excelent processor . 
   the white-gold concordat will quickly turn black-blue for all of tamriel to witness . 
  wow , * slow clap * to you sir .

  i still have a save made at 11/11/11 right before hadvar asks me `` who are you ? 
  [ linux mint ceo is quite open about his hatred on jews ] ( http://warped-mirror.com/2012/02/26/linux-mint-israel-and-me/ ), 
  i guess you could maybe try the rpm based distros , since you 're familiar with debian 's way of doing stuff . 
  arch or gentoo if you want heavy customization . 
  seems like another of those bragging never happened posts,

  what font is that ? 
  i recommend you give a fair bit of time between each comic so that it still feels fresh . 
  well c # is basically java with some stuff borrowed from c++ and haskell . 
  [ it was me :( ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/youdontsurf/comments/28jzhr/kids_are_so_much_more_technologically_advanced/ ),

  why is there desktop pc and laptop pc ?? 
  are n't these pc master race ? 
  i think fallout does a better job with quests choices , i did n't play much but i recall that a lot of quests had multiple ( not binary good or bad ) paths to complete it . 
  do n't know if you have played skyrim , but in oblivion alchemy is more straightforward . 
  ingredients have 4 effects , alchemy level 25 can see 2 effects , level 50 can see 3 , level 75 can see 4 and level 100 can make potions with 1 ingredient ( only 1 ^ st effect will be chosen ) . 
  also , you do not need to eat like in skyrim to reveal an ingredient 's effects . 
  you can make potions anywhere , what you must have in your inventory is a `` mortar and pestle '' , simply click on it and the potion making menu will open . 
  there are 3 more optional apparatus , but you want them all to increase magnitude and duration of your potions , those are : alembic ( increases negative effects ) , retorn ( increases positive effects ) and calcinator ( increases both effects ) . 
  apparatus also have `` levels '' just like skills : novice , apprentice , journeyman , expert and master ( higher = better ) .
