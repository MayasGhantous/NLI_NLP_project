  so basically to make potions what you need is to have at least 2 different ingredients with at least 1 common effect and if you mix them in the potion making menu , you can make a potion with that common effect . 
  example : if i wanted to make a `` restore health '' potion i would need to find 2 different ingredients that have a `` restore health '' effect on simply add them at the potion making menu , hit `` mix potion '' and a potion of restore health would be created . 
  the first thing that you probably want to do is increase your alchemy level because the number of potions that you can make is somewhat limited . 
  an easy way to do it ( and making good money ) is to make a bunch of potions of `` restore fatigue '' , `` why ? '', 
  you ask . 
  it 's because in oblivion all `` real life '' ( apples , potatoes , tomatoes , etc. . . ) food has the 1 ^ st effect as `` restore fatigue '' , and you can find `` real life '' food easily in farms or guild halls for example ( if you 're a member then taking food in guild halls is not considered stealing ) . 
  [ here 's a very nice video covering alchemy in oblivion ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzhck9nfuvk ) despite being almost 6 years old it 's still top notch . 
  [ here 's the uesp page about alchemy ] ( http://www.uesp.net/wiki/oblivion:alchemy ) which also has some more in depth technical information too . 
  gnu image manipulating program, 
  it is n't but in electricity bills they use kwh ( kilowatt-hour ) instead of joule because it 's more convenient . 
  same as measuring noise level with db ( decibel ) instead of bel , the si unit . 
  exactly , that stuff is ruining tifu . 
  recently there was a thread where op wrote `` we did everything , yes even butt stuff '' and i just bursted laughing because it sounds something that 15 year old teenagers make up to feel cool . 
  this is what keeps me from replaying skyrim ... 
  * i hate shields, 
  * dual wield is clunky and there 's no `` flow '' between the left and right hand , what you basically get is a new fancy power attack . 
  * two handed too slow for my taste ( oblivion 's a bit better ) . 
  * destruction is shit because spells have limited damage and i just end up using fire 90 % of time because it deals most damage ( perks are boring too ), 
  * conjuration is `` okay '' but creatures take too long to spawn and the ai is n't the best so it 's annoying to be there waiting for my creatures to kill the enemies when i could do it myself ... 
  * illusion is pretty much the same as conjuration , frenzied creatures take some time to start killing their mates and it gets annoying, 
  and to add insult to injury there 's no spellmaking anymore , and there are like 5 summons in the vanilla game and only 1-2 are worth using . 
  so this basically leaves me to stealth , and i 'm a bit tired of it . 
  also armors suck so i end up using ancient dark brotherhood + nightingale chest only because of enchants every time . 
  durak in russian/ukranian ( \u0414\u0443\u0440\u0430\u043a ) means stupid/fool . 
  honestly , you have to try quite hard to build a $ 3000 pc . 
  a best single card + good processor build will be like $ 1500 maximum of maximums ( depending if you go with fancy or not cases , ssds . 
  but those are n't necessary for good performance and are considered luxury ) . 
  funny because it 's ridiculous, 
  yeah really , dunno . 
  for example i played aion eu and i wanted to say `` stay there '' to my friend in portuguese which is `` fica ai '' and i type it and comes out as '' **** ai '' . 
  this means in portugal whenever we 're saying `` stay '' it 's a curse word in some european language \\ ^ ^, 
  unlike oblivion , i think skyrim has level caps for npcs ( most of them around level 50 ) so it 's not a * big * problem . 
  i 'd do the math with all the perks and shit but i 'm lazy . 
  one thing that you should know is that daggers do not have a bigger modifier compared to swords as in skyrim , but there are mods that change this . 
   pointy elf ears . 
  well they 're a bit too much pointy but orcs are elfs . 
  is n't dwm config in c ? 
  may sound a bit elitist but i3 is like the ubuntu of tiling wms ... 
  really ? 
  i saw it on eli5 and later on askscience, 
  but it 's white and gold ... color picker shows it . 
  wow , so the bragging reached here too . 
  oh please post more memes about your teenager sexual fantasies that * totally * happened . 
  none because all they do is get in the way and slow down my progress . 
  this is especially bad when you 're a sneaking character . 
  yeah , because if you 're alone and duck with shadow warrior perk the enemy will go out of combat so you can get a sneak attack , but if you have a follower/horse then the enemy will attack your follower/horse so you ca n't get sneak attacks . 
  shadow warrior is broken though so i never pick it . 
  delphine yes , but not esbern :(, 
  that 's exactly my mindset . 
  i strongly dislike nvidia 's way of restricting stuff to only their hardware and stuff , then seem like the apple of gpus . 
  if they 're making them it means there 's a demand ... 
  i do n't understand your logic there . 
  you can dual boot if you feel like exploring a new os and still have windows for your games . 
  i installed arch recently ( maybe a month ago ) and it has n't broken to me yet ... 
  i get a feeling that debian is kinda outdated for some reason . 
  is this true ? 
  then why you 're not running arch ? 
  did you also manufacter you own processor ? 
   it 's just time consuming, 
  how 's that ? 
  takes like 15 minutes if you do n't include pacstrap downloading the base files, 
   cfdisk, 
   mkfs.ext4, 
   mount to / mnt, 
   wifi-menu if on wireless, 
   pacstrap base base-devel / mnt, 
   locale and timezone, 
   install a bootloader, 
  there you go , arch is installed . 
  has n't the development of jessie frozen or something ? 
  find the skeleton key \\ ^ ^, 
  this reminded me that i must try the `` heart of the beast '' werewolf mod because the vanilla ones are kinda lacking . 
  oh okay , so when is 8.0 released then ? 
  ubuntu or linux mint because their goal is to provide a working , out of the box system and they 're aimed for beginners . 
  because it is designed as diy . 
  i know an automated install would be better for the majority but that 's the developers `` philosophy '' . 
  that 's why stuff like manjaro and antergos exist . 
  sometimes i think bethesda does n't even play their own game , they surely would get annoyed at things such as not being able to delete spells and ending up with a huge list with useless spells like `` 6 pts fire damage '' . 
  i never noticed how it 's a critique to religion :, 
  `` i 'm giving birth to a holy child !, 
  you need to help me get rid of it before i find myself in a book '', 
  op 's build flair, 
   ** r7 260x **, 
  it 's like a ferrari with a peugeot 1100cc engine . 
  yeah , make a lot of color choices and give peasant tier flairs a gray or something . 
  [  using reference cooled amd cards ] ( #g ), 
  you should also check out [ gogron gro-bolmog ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6s6d46mp3o ) ( it 's from oblivion but fucking hilarious ), 
  `` omg why u goin to useless jungle and not come top with me ? ' '', 
  to avoid flaming from teammates `` omg our ryze 250 ping gg we lose '' and also to avoid abuse of oponnents . 
  also back then when you got dced it would display a message to everyone and your character just started recalling . 
  now they made it so the character runs back to base and the message only displays to your team . 
  yeah ezreal w used to increase as for allies , decrease for enemies and heal you . 
  only faction i felt like i was part of a family :(, 
  you got it wrong there mate , we were talking about oblivion [ dark brotherhood spoiler ] ( #d `` where you must kill members from the sanctuary , a method known as `` purification '' '' ), 
  it 's fallout 's turn now , and we have n't even heard an announcement yet ... and only then tes 6 . 
  i should add that windows fast boot is just pseudo hibernate . 
  real sad . 
  also the journal , i loved to read the quest messages . 
  skyrim 's are so dull and effortless . 
  ohai there arry \\ ^ ^,
