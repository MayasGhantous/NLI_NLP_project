  also in skyrim sheogorath says things that suggest that he 's the hero of kvatch . 
  i think he says stuff like he saw a `` fox , severed head '' which refers to gray fox and a particular event of the dark brotherhood . 
  whenever i played sneaky archer i always went with some normal clothes because shit 's op . 
  if you 're reacting like this at normal prices , then when the summer sale will hit op will have a nerdgasm overdose . 
  what about packer - syu ? 
  \\  linking images from 4chan, 
  for the same reasons that ubuntu is for beginners ... 
  i think archers need an attack speed skill . 
  for example br first boss 30 % shield part , you have a small time frame to do big dps but if archer decides to charge up his pen/radiant arrow , he will spend like 6-7 seconds doing nothing ... 
  modlist please, 
  well on my mage yes ( you mentioned armor but i use my 100 % armor spell and i 'm invincible to physical attacks ) . 
  basically full fortify magicka + atronach birthsign + spelldrinker amulet + a 25 spell absorb ring which totals to 101 spell absorb so i 'm imune to magic and restore magicka when get hit . 
  i also use the bug where i absorb my own telekinesis to restore magicka ( it 's kinda tricky to make it perfect because you will never have full magicka , hard to explain how it works so try for yourself if you want ) . 
  this along with weakness 100 % to 3 elements spell and then 50 pts for 3 seconds in 10 ft area of 3 elements simply one shots anything in normal difficulty at level 49 . 
  i also though about this , this is the perfect solution . 
  it would remove the annoyance of random events killing important people but still feel a bit more immersive to know that if you want to kill a person , you will face the consequences and nobody 's gon na hold your hand and prevent you from fucking up . 
  bethesda take notes . 
  hmm that 's nice . 
  another example of how an apparently simple mod can make a much bigger impact . 
  my poorfag `` stepping up '' :, 
  intel express chipset family ( yes that is a thing )   gt8800 ( but i returned it because pentium 4 was bottleneck )   new laptop with an ati hd 5650m and that was 5 years ago . 
  what i learned from this is that in oblivion , mages do everything that the other classes do but better . 
  haha fuck that , i have restoration spells and shield spells . 
  * lockpicking ? 
  the fuck , i can open any lock with a spell . 
  * sneaking ? 
  1 word for you : invisibility . 
  * weapon damage capped at around 30 ? 
  hahaha check out my 900 damage spell ( if you combine weaknesses and dots you can achieve this ) . 
  about the offense i suggest making the damage spells less magnitude but duration like 3-4 seconds because it 's more efficient . 
  i also find adding the minimum 10 ft area effect very good because you will be able to hit many enemies with a single spell , making it even more efficient . 
   and if you 're feeling brave , you can build the whole os from scratch ( see arch linux ) !, 
  i think you misspelled linux from scratch ( lfs ) . 
  haha here 's my progress, 
  [ first distro crunchbang and later installed i3 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wdyympk.png ), 
  [ then moved to arch with bspwm ] ( http://i.imgur.com/smozjse.png ), 
  why would you need two clocks ? 
   remember that amd has a reputation of running very hot . 
  that 's the reference cooler models ... can we stop with this meme ? 
  you 're talking about punchcat ? 
   i honestly do n't know what it is about heavy armour and a battle axe in skyrim . 
  i 've always liked to sneak my way through the eneny with stealth and a bow !, 
  i reeeally wan na play a badass warrior barbarian , but i just ca n't enjoy it : /, 
  it 's still true that amd card might run a bit hotter and consume some more power but it 's almost unnoticeable and not totally horrible as people like to circlejerk around in this sub . 
  i think there 's a mod among the lines of `` organized bandits of skyrim '', 
  nobody breaks the law on my watch !, 
  they were the best in 2006 . 
  my jaw dropped when i first saw them . 
  i 'm sorry if i 'm stealing this thread but since mine is also a dumb question . 
  any dawnguard female nord vampires here ? 
  if so then what color is your eyes ? 
  because serana is a nord and her eyes are red but my female nord has yellow eyes just like elves and stuff ... is there something i 'm missing ? 
  i 'm aware of the mod , but [ according to this uesp wiki ] ( http://www.uesp.net/wiki/skyrim:vampirism ) ( scroll down a bit for appearances ) in dawnguard some races/genders ( nords , female bretons and imperials ... ) have serana-like eyes ( orangish/red ) and others have the harkon-like ones ( golden yellow ) . 
  and this is correct because today i found out if i uninstall unofficial dawnguard patch then my female nord will get the orangeish/red eyes and if i install it again then my eyes will be golden yellow . 
  but it 's weird because i think valerica , serana 's mother , is also a nord but her eyes still remain golden yellow while rest of nords is orangeish/red . 
  i cry everytime :(, 
  i remember i saw a thread on / g / which mentioned that years ago computers came with manuals teaching you how to program and stuff like that . 
  it 's mostly due to how people grew with windows so they 're used to it so it feels more intuitive to them even if in reality it might not be . 
   copy-paste, 
  you people build your pcs but must copy-paste your specs ? 
  not everybody has hardware capable of it . 
  it should be either hammerfell or elsweyr because those two have hot climates so it would be a contrast to skyrim . 
  actually , it maybe should be elsweyr + valenwood because if you take a look at [ tamriel ] ( http://ltastudent.lodiusd.net/adamp/images/map%20of%20tam/tamrielmap.jpg ) , elsweyr and valenwood are kinda small so if they put them together then it would be nice . 
  i really like [ no leveled item rewards ] ( http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/22996/ ? ), 
  so that i could just play the game without worrying about receiving a reward that will be obsolete later in the game . 
  but it 's still not good enough , why the hell would i be facing stronger enemies if i leveled up my lockpicking and speech skills ? 
  somebody already explained it but i will try to do a tl ; dr, 
  * each skill has an attribute related to it ( alchemy - intelligence , armorer - endurance , blade - strength , etc. . . ), 
  * to get +5 bonus on level up you must have 10 level ups of the skill related to that attribute ( ex : i want +5 strength so i must get 10 level ups of blade ), 
  * every 10 major skills makes you level up, 
  * any skill that you level after getting 10 major skill level ups will not count to increasing the bonus you 'll receive after sleeping, 
  * so what you want is to plan out your minor skills accordingly so that you can always get 10 levels increase of whatever attributes you want before getting a level up, 
  [ also if you want to just enjoy the game while still getting good bonuses ] ( http://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/2691/ ? ), 
  do what i do : deliver the amulet to jauffre and then just never go to kvatch and do whatever you like and there will be no oblivion gates to annoy you . 
   lachance, 
  that voice though ... 
  words ca n't explain . 
  my favorite phases are when you reply with * `` rufio will die by my hand * '' he says * `` eeeeexcellent !, 
  '' * in a reallly badass voice . 
  and also when he is talking about the poisoned apple * `` if someone is inclined to eat the apple ... ( epic pause ) * *** death *** '', 
  i do n't have the steam version but i believe it 's something among the lines of steamapps/common/oblivion / data, 
  weak , he 's weak , you 're strong , crush him !, 
  oblivion kinda traumatized me regarding to leveling . 
  while most people i know that only played skyrim they 're like `` higher level = better i 'm already level 81 yay '' , but i am just scared to level up anything but not combat skills that i will use because i still get that feeling that the enemies will outscale me unless i carefully level my skills just like in oblivion ( for example : if i level up lockpicking and speech to 100 i will be facing level 20 enemies while having shit items and low combat skills ) . 
   not using skyui, 
  i hope that the flair is a string because an integer is n't enough . 
  calm yourself you salty nerd, 
  just a quick question have n't played skyrim in a while . 
  dragonrend was a human-made shout back in 1e to fight the dragons ? 
  wow ... 
  i guess you 're one of those players that explores every corner for 15 minutes \\ ^ ^, 
  that quest definitely sparked some of my nostalgia , i was thinking like `` i killed countless of your ancestors '' . 
  i was a die hard stormcloack fan but recently i 've changed my mind because i realized it is n't the empire 's fault of banning of talos and other nasty stuff , what ulfric should do is go against the thalmor instead , because the empire needs to keep together to have a chance to fight against the thalmor but then ulfric makes a fucking rebellion and risks of disrupting the fragile peace that could cause another great war . 
  great war explanation ? 
  why the high elves after oblivion crisis decided to randomly go in war against whole empire and how could they possibly win if it 's only them against all the empire ? 
  this is ** linux ** masterrace so every distro is running the same kernel so it does n't matter :d, 
  have you played oblivion ( i think not ) ? 
  the first thing i did when i got my hands on skyrim was to find out how to join the db because i was expecting it to be the same as oblivion 's . 
  you slaughtered an emaciated beggar in cold blood . 
  you are truly an opponent to be feared .
