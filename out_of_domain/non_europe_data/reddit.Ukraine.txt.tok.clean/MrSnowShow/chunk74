  love the sarcasm . 
  wow , i recently completed his quest and before that i always loved to pick * `` beg !, 
  beg for your miserable life !, 
  '' * and make fun of him but now i 'm feeling terrible . 
  why do khajiit lick their butts ? 
  tes lore is fucking huge man . 
  oooh okay then , i also dislike astrid she 's a bitch but it 's still better than killing all of them : /, 
  so many games , so little time . 
  will there ever be a time where people will actually play the games they bough on sale ? 
  i think not . 
   i 've been in it for years now and still amazes me how fast the tech world moves . 
  honestly tech is slowing down ... in 2006 my pc after 4 years ( 2010 ) was already obsolete and a piece of shit but now my 2010 laptop is still strong . 
  the 2500k processor which was released in 2011 is still very good 4 years later . 
  that would not happen in early 2000 . 
  oh wow , you hid your username in the screenshot . 
  that 's so clever , i 'll never know your username now . 
  [ mannimarco revisited ] ( http://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/14200/ ? ), 
  i do n't remember quite well but i believe you could perform various necromancy shit after defeating him and the new lair can serve as home . 
  pin number, 
  atm machine, 
  you know that kind of websites which require shares/likes to view ? 
  most of them are poorly done so you can, 
  view page source, 
  ctrl + f and search for `` youtube '' , `` dailymotion '' or `` vimeo '', 
  copy the rest of link and paste it into address bar, 
  get praised as elite h4x0r, 
  also another thing you can do to bypass youtube age restriction is to replace the '' / watch?v = '' part with '' / v / '' and get more h4x0r fame among you friends . 
  just an advice : basically when you install a clean windows you need to install drivers for everything : chipset , graphics , audio , touchpad , network card , etc. . . just google your laptop 's model and download the drivers from the manufacturer 's website . 
  i remember keeping every type of arrow in basket at the shack in the waterfront and they never dissapeared . 
  what 's the difference between - syyu and - syu ? 
  also you do not use any aur helpers ? 
  you clearly do n't browse 4chan frequently , it 's almost the same bait threads over and over again , i think currently there 's one `` feels good to be a macfag '' and then the shitstorm happens . 
  just as gentoo is the official / g / distro , ( tips ) fedora should be the official reddit distro . 
  have n't tried anything other than crunchbang but now it 's kill so i 'll go with flair related . 
  check out [ ubuntu flavors ] ( http://www.ubuntu.com/about/about-ubuntu/flavours ), 
  i liked the circle link flair more , it was minimalist ^ ^ ^ tm, 
  it 's not about the number of users , i 'm pretty sure a minority of / g / uses gentoo . 
  fedora could be the same `` meme '' in reddit . 
  god that was horrible to read . 
  modding is so fucking amazing , makes the game age in reverse and only gets better with time . 
  how 's the battery life on your mbp with arch ? 
  since arch comes with nothing it simply eats my battery because i have no config tools and there are so many that i do n't know where to start . 
  wonder what happpens if you update haha . 
  you need to press enter twice to make paragraphs [ enter ], 
  [ enter ], 
  like this, 
  why here are two linux mint logos ? 
  i 'd suggest replacing one of them with debian . 
  advanced tip :, 
  if you want to not leave a space between a line , you do space twice and press enter . 
  this is, 
  a new paragraph using double enter, 
  this is, 
  a new line using [ space ] [ space ] [ enter ], 
  well it 's a well know fact that windows ' command line is a nightmare to use , mostly due to how ambiguous and poorly organized the folders are . 
  was n't mbp os x battery life around 8 hours or something ? 
  oh come on , you have multiple of the same folders and shit . 
  wtf is appdata and there are folders like documents and settings then documents , my documents it 's a nightmare and not even metioning registry . 
  i remember another funny loading screen posted here months ago which i think was about how khajiits can still see in the dark that you 're a faggot . 
  sorry for replying to a 3 month old comment but i feel that this is because since tes got a lot of popularity with skyrim , everyone 's a bit more biased towards nords and shit . 
  while in oblivion for example every race is equal and you do n't feel the same racism as in skyrim . 
  yo , you should equip dagger on left hand and sword on right for better dps . 
  edit : shit replied to 3 month old post, 
  i guess you should upgrade the big 3 . 
  cpu , mobo and gpu . 
  pc gaming grew a lot because of steam , also they like linux < 3 . 
  the only thing i hate is their support system being crap and no refunds . 
  wait . 
  my gpu is shit ( mobility hd 5650 1 gb vram ) and i remember that i can handle skyrim 2k textures lite version ( which are 2x bigger than official high-res dlc ) so i think it 's no problem using the full version of those ( 4x bigger than official high-res dlc ) . 
  yeah i 'm not that old ... 
  after 300 hours i discovered that you do not have climb over that mountain , if you take the road it will eventually lead you where you wanted to . 
  300 armor rating with ebonyflesh ( expert skill ) and you hit the armor cap which is 80 % reduction with master skill ( dragonhide ) . 
   high settings at a good framerate, 
  yes . 
  i can play with my shitty hd 5650 at high/ultra mix so you definitely can do more that that . 
  easy legendary viable faceroll build :, 
  * dual-wield + elemental fury shout, 
  * smithing , enchanting and alchemy at 100, 
  * [ make the best enchanting potion ( fortify enchanting 35 % ) , enchant 4 pieces with fortify smithing ( my cap was 33 % ) and make the best smithing potion ( my cap was 139 % ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052tix-hrdy ), 
  * upgrade armor and weapons ( you will hit armor cap easily so 80 % damage reduction ), 
  * if you want things easier , pick breton ( 25 % magic resist ) , pick lord stone ( 25 % magic resist +50 armor but this does n't matter ) , get two magic resist perks on alteration tree ( 20 % magic resist ) and do the book of love quest to get permament 15 % magic resist bonus without any enchantments . 
  so 25 +25 +20 +15 = 85 % magic resist which is the cap too . 
  so at this point you 're dealing tons of damage with ** unenchanted ** gear . 
  if you want you can enchant your gear with survivability only to keep things interesting because you 're already dealing shitload of damage and if you use elemental fury shout , then things just melt in front of you . 
  also you can make this even more op with the necromage vampire thing but if you 're using uskp then you ca n't because it got fixed . 
  what 's your mod list ? 
  fortify restoration loop, 
  i only play vampire for role-playing purposes since they give just minor benefits , even with dawnguard they 're kinda shit , which is stupid . 
  a necromage vampire should be the vanilla vampire because vampires are better than normal people at everything : faster , stronger etc etc so there should be health magicka stamina bonuses , running speed , damage ... 
  i wish i had the patience to use the construction set again and make this changes for myself . 
  maybe you should increase your difficulty . 
  * [ begin by making the best legit gear possible with 100 smithing , alchemy and enchanting ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052tix-hrdy ), 
  * your armor will hit the cap ( 80 % ) easily . 
  and a dragonbone sword will have around 195-200 damage . 
  * now hit the cap ( 85 % ) with magic resist . 
  easy way without enchanted gear is breton + the lord + 2 perk points in alteration + agent of mara blessing from a quest . 
  if you want more resist then enchant gear with resist fire/frost/shock . 
  * i choose dual wield + elemental fury shout because it has the biggest dps potential . 
  so i stop at this point ( unenchanted gear and no potions ) because you do fucking amazing damage and melt anything when use the elemental fury shout . 
  but you still must be more cautious with multiple stronger enemies because even with capped armor you can take quite a bit of damage .
