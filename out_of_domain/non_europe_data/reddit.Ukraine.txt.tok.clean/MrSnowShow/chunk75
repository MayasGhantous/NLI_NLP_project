  you can also be a necromage vampire to basically boost every effect on your character which is op . 
  if you want to make this shit more op then you can enchant your gear with fortify one-handed wherever possible but i think it just breaks the game ( yes even on legendary ) so if you still want to enchant your gear then do it for survivability only . 
  hardest part of a dual wielding build is keeping things challenging . 
  surprised by not seeing elemental fury . 
  one of the strongest shout in the game and absolutely ridiculous while dual wielding . 
  i always kill lydia because i do n't like followers , am i a heartless bastard ? 
  you need to start thinking that they 're saying that to themselves . 
  like the bandit is regretting to come here because he met you and he knows he gon na die . 
  you 're someone that can get things done , i like that . 
  i would like very much to see hrongar fucking up avenicci . 
  * `` just remember the order : do job first , get drunk second . 
  i wish bethesda made small one-handed crossbows ... 
  i always carry a 1 bottle of alcohol drink :, 
  wine , alto wine , nord mead , ale , honningbrew mead and black-briar mead . 
  also carry skooma , redwater skooma and moon sugar . 
  sheogorath in skyrim is the hero of kvatch from oblivion, 
  * half video games and make modders do the rest, 
  pcmr wants games , windows gives support to all the games they want , so they pick windows . 
  also i do not think that ( yet ) linux is superior to windows in the same way as pc is superior to consoles . 
   too busy playing skyrim , far cry and just cause to notice, 
  wasting your time is nothing to be proud of . 
  well this one has only a slightly worse cpu that the other . 
  shit disregard my other comment , i just noticed that it 's basically i7 vs i5 and not `` slightly worse cpu '' . 
  the difference between i7 and i5 is hyperthreading and basically a slight increase in clock speed and cache . 
  if all you do in your pc is casual stuff and gaming ( skyrim wont use hyperthreading ) then the i5 is fine and save yourself # 80 , but if you also want to do video/image editing and other cpu demanding tasks then it might be worth getting the i7 . 
  why are you typing like a 14 year old ? 
  it 's hard to understand you that way . 
  this shit is so immersion breaking that it hurts to play the dlc . 
  damn , akavir sounds fucking amazing . 
  i also like how the samurai-style gear comes from them because they come from the east , just like in real life . 
  yes that 's ubuntu with unity . 
  terminal colors must be solarized and icons probably numix ? 
  honestly , the hardest part of an arch install is making a functional setup with only a window manager . 
  arch install is just a dozen commands and then you just install a de and you 're pretty much done . 
  difficulty meter, 
  ** easy ... ... ... ... ... | ... ... ... . . hard **, 
  dual booting allows you to still boot into windows in case you need software like ps , autocad , office, 
  while being a memory hog , it also has amazon ads by default ... yep not using unity anytime soon . 
  read the wiki page on the de that you want ... 
  [ must have mod for werewolves ] ( http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/13779/ ? ), 
  i noticed that if i do short alt tabs the game works fine , but if i stay for a little longer then when i go back in the game is still running but i 'm unable to do anything and if i open a menu the image freezes . 
  you seem to forgot to post your specs . 
  [ all +5 attribute modifiers ] ( http://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/2691/ ? ), 
  also , there 's no shame in sliding down the difficulty , basically in tes the difficulty 's main purpose is not giving challenge but to balance out the game depending on how much you exploit game mechanics . 
  in oblivion mages are overpowered late in the game because you can make spell combos with 900 damage and armor spells with 100 % damage resist while warriors/archers are bad because melee weapons are capped at around 30 damage per hit . 
  so when i played mage i had the difficulty at 100 % most of the time and max level for more challenge but with warrior or archer i did n't level all major skills in order to keep the level down and sometimes i had to turn down the difficulty . 
  my favorite without question is elemental fury , made my dual wielding build do crazy damage at legendary and i also like how female breton says the words ( su grah dun ! ), 
  making it more epic . 
  have n't tried slow time much but i guess it 's pretty nice on archers . 
  have n't used marked for death much too but i like the concept , just like soul tear and drain vitality . 
  whirlwind sprint is also nice to travel around and sometimes i like to go fancy and instead of running to the enemy i just use this shout to get close . 
  wish you could pull off some kind of special attack during the shout , it would make it more epic . 
  not a big fan of unrelenting force but it 's particularly useful on legendary where i had a powerful mage waiting for me to exit cover with his powerful charged up spell ready to blow me up so i can incapacitate him long enough to kill him before he can do anything . 
  i do n't think we 're going to go back to traditional-rpg style in the next es , and i think it 's better that way for more casual players , makes it easier to get into the game ( that 's why skyrim probably got so much popular than previous es games ) , but i think that races should have more strict bonuses/weaknesses , a bosmer should always be a little bit worse at two-handed weapons that a nord for example . 
  i 'm more worried about the interaction that the player has with the world . 
  for example : being able to kill any npc that we want should be brought back ( protect questline npcs by other damage sources like random vampire attacks or something , but if a player truly wants an npc dead , then he should be able to do and face the consequences ) . 
  have you played other elder scrolls games ? 
   i love skyrim , it 's pretty much a perfect game for me . 
  that 's a very strong statement coming from someone who played multiple es games . 
  honestly for me there are a ton of flaws in skyrim , it has evolved in the gameplay aspect but got worse in quests ( especially factions ) compared to previous games . 
  holy shit does this really happen ? 
  i used to take my gf almost everyday when parents were n't home ( they did n't know ) but one day we decided to just play fifa and my dad was kinda upset because he was afraid that i 'd do `` stupid stuff not for my age '' . 
  after that i ca n't even imagine having a girl at my bedroom , and sleeping over is not even coming to my mind . 
  is there a / r/iamveryplayboy or something ? 
  one of the reasons that i 'm not building a `` gaming '' computer . 
  if i ever need a new pc i 'll get a laptop with good battery life and processor and intergrated gpu . 
  i 'm not asking for respawnable important npcs , i just wanted for the player to be able to kill whoever he wants . 
   protect questline npcs by other damage sources like random vampire attacks or something , but if a player truly wants an npc dead , then he should be able to do and face the consequences, 
  this is why i said in previous comment that important npcs should be protected from random events but if the player wants to kill that npc then he should be able to and face the consequences of killing an important character . 
  let the delphine hate begin once more !, 
  seeing this screenshot makes me notice how much difference even the lite version the skyrim 2k textures make . 
  i did n't fence much but for the thieves guild i just robbed a few stores in the market district ( weapons and armor stores , jewelry , shields ) and fenced over 1000 gold and just never bother with it again because no need more than 1000 gold to unlock all thieves guild quests . 
  some simple mods that make a big difference :, 
  * [ detect life effect and night-eye shader ] ( http://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/36407/ ? ), 
  - makes night eye better looking and more useful because the default one hides information about where the shadows are . 
  also the detect life effect is more simplier and less bloaty . 
  * [ quest award leveller ] ( http://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/5701/ ? ), 
  - no need to wait until level +20 to turn that quest to receive a better version of the reward, 
  * [ super hotkeys ] ( http://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/22326/ ? ), 
  - more hotkey circles , because 8 is n't enough, 
  * [ spell delete and item remove ] ( http://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/23069/ ? ), 
  - spell deleting yay !, 
  * [ faster arrows ] ( http://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/2103/ ? ), 
  - self explanatory, 
  i leveled all my majors to 100 , was level 49 but luck still was n't maxed . 
  this test is shit but 87 wpm . 
  but he always tells me that he does n't fancy those clunky two-handed weapons ... 
  no , it 's the other way around . 
  if the player has low 2h skill he says `` you 're like me eh ? 
  do n't fancy those clunky two-handed weapons . '', 
  but if you have a high skill , they will comment with `` gods gave you two hands , and you use them both for your weapon , i respect that . '', 
  but the thing is that their equipment is random , so a guard wielding a two-handed weapon might say that they are clunky . 
  well , you have to force yourself to play in a new way . 
  everybody knows that stealthy archer is the safest/easiest way to play so it 's natural that people tend to play that because `` why do things hard way if i can do easy way '' but after getting the hang of it , it becomes much more enjoyable playing a warrior character . 
  but muh 5 hour gameplay aaa gaymes !, 
  the running joke on / g / is that chrome knows everything you do in their browser , so it 's a botnet . 
  people moved to libre office because open office was acquired by oracle . 
  fyi that pic is from / g / and kinda outdated .
