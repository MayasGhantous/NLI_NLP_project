  this is not stupid . 
  he maybe uses other browser at home so it 's natural that he does n't know that . 
  this is not true . 
  linux was an entirely new project written from scratch so it has no relation whatsoever to unix from a code standpoint , linux is often called a unix clone . 
  while os x on the other hand derives and has roots through bsd and original unix . 
  he though 4k was vertical pixel count . 
  he though os x comes from linux . 
   its a universal shortcut, 
  ooh nice i did n't know about this on firefox . 
  wow i though no one would remember this , i encountered it as i randomly wandered around until i found the inn . 
  so simple quest but for some reason it feels special . 
  the one where you must expose women who are robbing men by seducing them . 
  another one where you had to expose a corrupt guard and days later he escapes prison and comes after you . 
  the one where you rent a room in a ship in waterfront and once you sleep ... a quest starts . 
  for anyone wondering :, 
  the announcement says 50 % off but the price is 19.99 , so we assume that it dropped 50 % from ~ ~ 29.99 ~ ~ 39.99 . 
  but in reality on the store page you realize that 19.99 is the original price and it 's getting a discount to 9.99 . 
  stop !, 
  you violated the lore !, 
  oblivion is actually the void between mundus and aetherius as you can see by [ this awesome image posted some days ago ] ( http://i.imgur.com/pg0k0rk.png ) . 
  mehrunes dagon 's plane is called deadlands . 
  sorry for my math retardation . 
  who are anu and padomay ? 
  hey nice work !, 
  you 're the same guy that made our banner . 
  i also think that mehrunes dagon would best represent tes iv as a snoo , because after all , it 's tes iv : oblivion and not tes iv : cyrodiil . 
  already implemented it , i left it bigger than the previous one because mehrunes dagon is huge in-game i though it would make sense \\ ^ ^, 
  so sithis gave rise to daedras ? 
  i added it , / u/minsctheranger made a fancy triangle but i fucked it up :(, 
  ^ ^ curse-never-dying, 
  but bruh it 's [ jiub ] ( http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m9a6fhavzt1qjlb8p.jpg ) from morrowind !, 
  this happened to me with crimson nirnroots : in oblivion i picked a nirnroot and got a fucking quest and it ended up with collecting a total of 100 nirnroots i think . 
  in skyrim i did n't pick a single nirnroot in fear of having to do that again , but then i got to blackreach and `` ohhh a red nirnroot '' * picks it up and quest starts * fuuuuuuuuuck . 
  you can choose to not complete that quest :(, 
  i never saw him die and i once i saw in the video what 's going on i stopped watching . 
  oh look , same flair . 
  * `` he is in hiding . 
  armand is accused of stealing the bust of llathasa indarys from cheyhindal . 
  they say count indarys himself filed the charges . 
  * it wont happen again . 
  ** wuld **, 
  umm what ? 
  he was immune to everything ... akatosh himself had to come down there and `` kill '' him . 
  i sang that like ragnar the red . 
  i think the problem is how you port forwarded . 
  first off , have you tried making your friends connect or you 're just assuming they ca n't because you get a `` port closed '' on the website ? 
  i 'm also getting `` ports closed '' on all my opened ports but i can guarantee you that all of them are opened because all my friends can connect to them and everything works fine . 
  so do n't rely solely on that website and make your friends try to connect . 
  now if that did n't work then i think you should change one thing in your nat settings : in my previous routers all the fields had to be filled with the port that i wanted ( i just put 12345 on every space ) , but on my new one i had to leave one `` any '' [ as you can see here ] ( http://i.imgur.com/93p95al.png ) . 
  so my guess is that your routers works the same way that my new one , so see if you have an `` any '' option on `` external ports '' section . 
  i 'm waiting \\ ^ ^, 
  did n't work : /, 
  the think about it is that it makes db look like a casual murdering clan ( `` common cutthroats '' as would ol' festus say ) . 
  throughout the game whenever somebody mentions the db ( maven , some recruits at the thieves guild ) they talk about it like it 's just another guild instead of a secret and scary organization which is what it should have been . 
  i 'm pretty sure it 's from uskp , once i installed it i started hearing more `` related-to-me '' dialogues like for example some guards used to say stuff like `` so you 're the newest member of the companions bla bla bla '' despite being a harbinger but now i no longer hear that and same shit with college of winterhold . 
  it 's a bit tiring to hear throughout the game that every place or every organization now is just a shadow of its former self . 
  i just hope that in next elder scrolls bethesda does not go into the `` everything is fucked up '' mentality again and when you join a guild you feel like you got into a proper organization . 
  ctrl + f `` george '', 
  0 matches found, 
  why have n't anyone though of this ? 
  this is thay type of threads that make me wish i had picked a more unusual username instead of being a normalfag . 
  i did a similar shit on school pcs but i put it in startup folder instead . 
  so easy to appear a '' `` l33t h4x0r '' in school . 
   windwalker would probably be the better archer options . 
  really ? 
  long time ago when i played ( i think max level was 60 ) people told me that tempest was the better choice and stuff ... 
  in oblivion it 's a breton battlemage . 
   i have n't done homework in like 5 days, 
  whoa, 
  you caught the wrong man !, 
  what about smithing ? 
  do n't you need to upgrade the sword ? 
  yep mages are totally op . 
  my mage has 2 epic damage spells, 
  * weakness to fire frost and shock 100 % in a 10 ft area for 35 seconds, 
  * shock fire and frost 50 pts in a 10 ft area for 3 seconds, 
  at level 49 at normal difficulty almost nothing survives this and there is n't any challenge at all , must increase difficulty all the way in order to be somewhat challenging . 
  hmm perhaps that 's a good alternative to smithing . 
  i always wanted to play a spellsword who uses robes but i felt like i would be missing out on damage if i did n't level up smithing , but leveling it would mess up the `` build '' of my character and that 's why i 've never played spellsword : /, 
  owyn was probably my second favorite character from oblivion . 
  i loved all of his dialogue he 's fucking hilarious, 
  * `` something something and try not to die before the gate opens '' *, 
  * `` i guess you showed that wood elf what you though of your magical dagger he he he '' *, 
  i also liked to hear what the yellow team champion would say about me every time i advanced ranks , which reminded me of another thing : i miss having a ranks page that showed your progress within a faction . 
  yeah and db takes it to a whole new level , you 're proclaimed as listener at like 1/3 of the questline ... 
  that 's so minimal bruh you look like a h4xor . 
  holy shit . 
  my card is just a bit worse ( 5650 ) and without any graphic mods it sometimes performed worse than skyrim . 
  first time i did this quest i killed all of them : /, 
  probably skingrad because me and count have some ... similarities ( hehe ) and the west weald is my favorite outdoors place . 
   this is not a game where a barbarian can be head of the mage 's guild . 
   you ca n't do everything , you ca n't be everything . 
  if you make an ally , you make an enemy, 
  i see you 're talking about elder scrolls there , and now that i 'm playing through fallout i can feel how a lot of stuff in es was poorly made , especially quest choices , how one sided most of them are and that you ca n't be an evil character . 
  i swear that every quest in fallout that i pick up seems fairly simple at first but get complicated later and i 'm forced to make choices that have consequences . 
  paying twice for the same amount of content with minor graphical increases ? 
  when i find you it 's gon na be bad . 
  what about the `` triple '' argonian names ? 
  the only one like that i recall at the moment is `` hides-his-heart '' from oblivion . 
   what kind of gaming pc to buy,
