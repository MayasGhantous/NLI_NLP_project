  none . 
  problem with prebuilt pcs like ayylienware and others is that they 're overpriced and come with `` unbalanced '' parts ( normally it 's a very good unnecessary i7 along with a crappy gpu and psu ) . 
  so what you want to do is to build one yourself , / r/buildapc and / r/buildapcforme are your best friends as others have already mentioned it . 
  i believe you crash when you voluntarily exit the game right ? 
  i used to not bother with it because i wanted to exit the game anyway so ... but i learned that if your game crashes on exit then your settings changes are not saved . 
  what you want to do to avoid this is to download [ fast exit ] ( http://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/22410/ ? ), 
  and oblivion no longer crashes on exit which means that your setting changes will be saved . 
  there is no `` wrong '' way to play the game , there are only more or less effective ways . 
  short version : skyrim improved in everything combat related ( except magic ) but failed on quests , especially factions . 
  also [ this is very relevant ] ( http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/615804-the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim/63556974 ), 
  skyrim improved on a lot of things and i 'm happy that it did , for example :, 
  * sneaking mechanics are much better ( maybe a bit overpowered ) . 
  * the dragons , while a bit laughable are still better than oblivion gates for sure . 
  * the game 's a * bit * more balanced towards warriors because in oblivion a warrior had 30 damage weapons while mages could do 1000 damage combos later in the game . 
  * cave design were improved , in oblivion caves bored me a lot of times because of just how similar they were ( and i 'm glad they removed doors in cave entrances too ) . 
  * [ the leveling problem ] ( http://www.uesp.net/wiki/oblivion:leveling#the_leveling_problem ) is basically gone to a certain extent . 
  * and a lot of stuff is improved but those things are expected since it 's a newer game ( better animations , graphics , etc etc ), 
  and basically the whole game is more streamlined and easier to get into , that is why probably it got so much popular . 
  this is debatable because some old fans prefer more rpg mechanics and numbers . 
  now the bad things are mostly related to quests and immersive stuff, 
  * your journal is shit , no information worth reading and it just does n't feel like a journal at all ( also the sound effect of oblivion 's journal popping is orgasmic ) . 
  example of an oblivion 's journal :, 
  * i 've managed to kill the fake vampire hunter , he apparently has been using this tactic in order to get rid of his old friends that had the keys to a treasure they split between them , i should check what 's inside and speak to deceased 's wife after . 
  now skyrim :, 
  ** i need to investigate a suspicious vampire hunter **, 
  * completed : kill the vampire hunter *, 
  * talk to deceased 's wife *, 
  * most magic is lackluster : no spellmaking , destruction spells offer almost no variation at all , vanilla game has 5 conjurable creatures ... 
  * ** no sense of accomplishment within a guild and quick progression to guild leader . 
  get ready for the shitstorm because this one is big :, 
  ** companions : ** 1 random quest and another story related and you get a fucking ceremony how you 're so good , another random quest ( go there kill that ) and you 're already invited into the circle ... what the fuck ? 
  oh and your enemy faction ? 
  are just renamed bandits to `` silver hand '' and they somehow enter whiterun , go past all the guards and manage to go into jorrvask and kill kodlak ... 
  there are a total of [ ** 6 ** named quests in the companions ] ( http://www.uesp.net/wiki/skyrim:companions#quests ) . 
  now go to [ oblivion 's fighters guild uesp ] ( http://www.uesp.net/wiki/oblivion:fighters_guild ) and compare . 
  and yes , oblivion 's has more quantity and more quality . 
  also i never experienced it but you can fail , complete quests poorly and get demoted for that . 
  ** college of winterhold ** : pretty much the same stuff . 
  college of winterhold does n't feel magical at all , at least the arcane university had some fancy teleporters . 
  savos aren is a little bitch and you have almost zero interaction with him . 
  oh and your main enemy ? 
  just single high elf . 
  in oblivion you had to fight a whole necromancer faction ( but mannimarco was a bit dissapointing too , i was expeting him to be some powerful lich and not a normal person ) . 
  ** thieves guild ** : this one i believe is one of the better ones , has a nice plot twist and all that but the quests do not involve much thief stuff like oblivion ( if you do not count the vex and delvin jobs ) and the real problem is brynjolf approaching you right as you enter riften . 
  ** dark brotherhood ** : after your first contract it 's revealed that you 're the listener , what the fuck ? 
  it 's okayish if you compare it to other skyrim factions but oblivion db is just another level no comparison possible . 
  also what i liked about oblivion 's faction was that you had another faction against you : fighters vs blackwood , mages vs necromancers , thieves and db vs guards . 
  ** quests ** : random quests generally speaking were better than skyrim 's . 
  * ( but on a side note i believe quests are much better made in fallout , because almost every quest has multiple ways to be completed and each choices has it 's consequences and outcomes that might haunt you later on . 
  at first it appears to be a quick and straightforward task , but several plot twists later you are scratching your head thinking about the best approach ) . 
  ** vampirism and lycanthropy **, 
  oblivion 's vampirism was n't that great either and sun damage is a pain in the ass , but skyrim even with dawnguard which is specific content for vampires still is pretty lackluster . 
  first off there are almost no interactions that should happen , for example sybille stentor does n't comment about your vampirism , companions do n't even say shit when you 're going to be a werewolf and it somehow magically cures your vampirism ( same in reverse ) and ** if you 're a vampire and you go to fort dawnguard to start the questline , isran does n't recognize your vampirism ** yep that 's right , a badass vampire hunter can not see that a vampire walked into his fort . 
  vampires are faster , stronger and pretty much better in every way than humans . 
  you do not get any of that , you just get a fucking resist frost and a more powerful reanimate dead spell with each stage , that 's it . 
  all npcs saying stuff like `` ooh vampires are dangerous and strong '' and yet when you become one you do not get any of that . 
  the blacksmith from volkihar says stuff like `` do n't you feel you 're more powerful now '' and no , i 'm not more powerful at all , i 'm very gimped . 
  werewolf form and vampire lord are only balanced for normal difficulty i think , i had to be a werewolf because of companions and i 'm playing on legendary , i run to the city and jump on a guard and do almost zero damage , his health barely moves and he just one shots me with an arrow , yeah ... so much for that `` powerful blessing '' skjor ... 
  still i 'd never buy a prebuilt pc ... 
  also do not forget the amount of bloat that comes in a `` fresh '' install of windows . 
  eastern europe bro ? 
  works fine on 37 stable edition ( aka the normalfag one ), 
  you can easily spot 60 fps when the camera moves , that 's why i had a harder time telling the difference when it was a game about a plane race or something . 
  imperial legion armor is definitely a very good choice in my opinion . 
  everybody knows the ** stop !, 
  you violated the law ** dudes . 
  i guess you can only rely on self control, 
  yeah and i like it that way , capped at 80 % damage reduction so you ca n't be immortal like in oblivion . 
  with correct fortify smithing potions and gear you can make even fur armor reach the armor cap ( 567 without shield ) and think this is really cool because we can get to wear any armor that we want . 
  yes , every npc in the game has a base of 0.70 hp/sec regen . 
  level 51 breton vampire . 
  i have around 80k gold now , gold is really a problem in lower levels when i mats to level up smithing and stuff but later in the game the loot is so good that you get rich easily so now i almost do n't pick anything . 
  well you need to ** role-play ** your character , talk to people , complete their quests if you want , explore , make goals for yourself ( want to be a badass warrior that does n't need any magic bullshit for example ) , associate with factions that you feel are appropriate for you . 
  you need 5 jobs in each major city except riften ( because riften is already under thieves guild influence ) . 
  so that 's whiterun , windhelm , solitude and markarth . 
  after 5 jobs completed at a specific city , delvin will have a special job for you in that city . 
  now go grab a piece of paper and a pen , write down the four cities and go pick a job from delvin ( numbers job is the easiest ) and vex ( heist and sweep are the easiest ) and put a tick on your piece of paper of whichever city the quest is taking place . 
  if you get a quest in riften or a city that you already did 5 jobs , simply talk to them again and quit the job , they will whine but there are no consequences except possibly having negative number of `` thieves guild quests completed '' on the stats page . 
  instead of posting somekind of weapon discussion , you post * le meme * ... 
  oh come on , sneaky archer is probably one of the easiest/safest way to play the game and you want the enemy ai to basically be braindead zombies and not even make an effort to dodge arrows ? 
  elemental fury ( su grah dun ! ), 
  is my favorite one , and also the most useful for my character ( sword/dagger dual wielding ) . 
  but that 's / g / official distro ... 
  reddit 's official distro should be ( tips ) fedora, 
  `` i 'm going to build a gnu/linux computer for ** gaming ** '', 
  if all you want to do is gaming why do n't you dual boot instead ? 
  seriously why would you go into the hassle of gaming on linux when you can do it in windows much easier ? 
  what is the point of purposely handicapping yourself ? 
  the combat in that game is fucking amazing . 
  ah the amount of bullshit bugs and nuisances that we must go through to play oblivion ... my game 's sound effects stopped playing for some goddamn reason , guess i 'll have to start all over again . 
  windows icon  right click `` computer ''  properties  scroll down to activation and do what it says . 
  the problem real problem is that you 're browsing le niengag, 
  i 'm one of them . 
  try an o ( as a letter ) . 
  you ca n't even use the meme arrow properly, 
  think of is as a deck of 52 cards . 
  you pick one , the host then reveals all other wrong 50 cards and leaves only one turned down , so would you change to that one or keep with your initial choice ? 
  ummm ? 
  where is the `` trick '' on this one ? 
  if you overtake the 2nd place then you 're the second place right ?
