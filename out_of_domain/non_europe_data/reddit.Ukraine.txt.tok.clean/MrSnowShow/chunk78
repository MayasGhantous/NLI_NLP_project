  because he is 4 and sister is 2 , there 's a 2 year difference between them . 
  what do cows drink ? 
  i finished the 1st but never managed to finish the 2nd . 
  rip phasewalk, 
  no cake : /, 
  star wars jedi knight : jedi academy ( multiplayer ), 
  i had the same problem on my fresh install , i believe it 's because your ` ~ / . xinitrc ` must be fucked up somehow . 
  you 'll need access to a terminal , delete the ` ~ / . xinitrc ` and use the copy command to copy a template . xinitrc which i believe is located in ` / etc/x11/xinit / xinitrc ` . 
  did n't you edit it ? 
  i believe you must uncomment a line related to your de, 
  yes , because ram is cheaper that efficient code . 
  i do n't understand what 's the problem , it 's a straightforward question :, 
  * `` umm i wuz wonderin , wats de wecommended mount of dedodated wam a iz to hav du survur ? 
  this . 
  when oblivion was the latest tes , i got all my info from uesp . 
  then when skyrim came out i tried to help uesp with some images and stuff because uesp is just so awesome . 
  when i searched for oblivion info i usually googled `` oblivion * [ something ] * '' and uesp was the 1 ^ st choice . 
  with skyrim however i noticed that 1 ^ st place was almost always the wikia and sometimes i even have to search for `` skyrim [ something ] uesp '' to find the uesp link which saddens me . 
  hmm weird , i also have uskp installed and my cap is 33 %, 
  / r/teslore would be angry at you . 
  black marsh is so harsh that nobody can live there except argonians , even the daedra had to run away during the oblivion crisis because argonians fucked them up pretty badly . 
  i 'd like it to be either hamerfell or elsweyr + valenwood ( because they 're both small ) . 
  the only reason is that it would make contrast with skyrim being cold place and hammerfell , elsweyr and valenwood are hot climate . 
  for no reason too . 
  that 's a different elder scroll . 
  the septimus signus quest has the elder scroll ( dragon ) , while blood and sun elder scrolls are from the dawnguard dlc . 
  kingdoms of amalur has some of the best combat i 've experienced in rpg . 
  you have to approach each strong enemy with a tactic , all have their strength and weaknesses that you can learn in order to have an easier time dealing with them . 
  also what i liked the most is that you have 3 skill trees : might , finesse and sorcery which can correspond to warrior , rogue and mage . 
  ** and the cool part is that you can mix them up !, 
  ** i 've always wanted to play a magical rogue and with kingdoms of amalur i could . 
  you have 2 weapon slots and you can quick switch between them allowing for fancy combos . 
  never had i so much fun with combat in an rpg before . 
  the problem with amalur is the other half of the rpg , when you 're not slaughtering your enemies and exploring and interacting with the world . 
  [ here are some more mods made by bethesda devs ] ( http://www.uesp.net/wiki/tes5mod:developer_mods ), 
  also , [ loading screens , by your mom ] ( http://www.uesp.net/wiki/tes5mod:developer_mods/ashley_cheng#loading_screens._by_your_mom . ), 
  yeah alchemy too . 
  i 'd say wait until sale if you 're no hurry . 
  i like to pub medic too sometimes , but only with quick-fix ... 
   nazeem is that redguard fella who is like `` do you get to the cloud district often ? 
  of course you do n't , why am i saying ? '', 
  a really necessary explanation, 
  what mod is this ? 
  if none it would be an epic idea . 
  you should open up some terminals , file manager , music player , etc. . so we can see icons , color themes and stuff . 
  because this is almost / r/wallpapers, 
  [ mine work in progress ( currently just a hobby ) ] ( http://i.imgur.com/smozjse.png ), 
  nope it 's bspwm . 
  it 's in the screenfetch . 
  as a female breton i 'm now scared . 
  what 's with all the `` remastered '' mentality ? 
  all it would do is give mediocre graphical increase and waste developer 's time . 
  what about brand new games ? 
  seconding this , all you need is just to have the game paused and double cursor wo n't happen . 
  [ might as well post mine too ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ea5bgmp.png ), 
  this reminds me that 's proventus is a dick . 
  `` nord nonsense '' are fucking serious ? 
  all 50 graphical mods ? 
  because i also have 50 mods but my gpu is pretty shitty ( a hd 5650 ), 
  if you 've got a 970 then you seriously should consider things like 4k textures and enbs, 
  i 'd side with silver-blood if the family was n't a bunch of dicks . 
  so that leaves forsworn for me ... 
  i did it twice haha . 
  cons : unbalanced in legendary . 
  i transformed , jumped on a whiterun guard , did close to zero damage and got one shot by an arrow . 
  but if they do they avoid most of default subs and go to very specific ones instead ... 
  also one interesting thing is that there 's a / r/4chan but there 's no / rdt /, 
  most fucked up thing i saw was how a dude somehow switched places with his dick and balls ( yeah his balls were up there and dick down near the ass ) and he was fucking himself and gave instructions how to do it ending with `` have fun ! '', 
  * quests , especially guild questlines obviously, 
  * music, 
  * journal, 
  * hybrid characters were smoother to play because you could use spells with any weapon, 
  * spellmaking, 
  * not being a `` hero '' character from the start , you 're just another dude that crossed paths with the emperor and you can eventually help him . 
  i 'm sad that between 10-13 april gw2 is 10 $ but paysafecard is not available in my country ... 
  edit : downvotes ? 
  just to clear a thing out , a first time wvw player has the potential to do the same damage as a veteran ? 
  assuming you have the correct build and stuff . . 
   the badass ones wear bears, 
  i love this one . 
  galmar is a fucking badass . 
  plus the ulfric 's speech at palace of kings before you join any side is amazing . 
  yes , but in skyrim you 're the dragonborn !, 
  while in oblivion you 're just a normal person who helps the emperor . 
  sorry your post was caught in the spam filter . 
  i think it 's really a gpu problem , plus oblivion is n't the most optimized game ... 
  maybe has a bit hero syndrome but definitely not like skyrim . 
  you 're not the only one who can close gates , sure a lot of people ask you to do it but only because you were the brave dude to go into kvatch 's so people assume you 're experienced with them . 
  and do n't forget the bruma quest where you show some guards how to close an oblivion gate and the captain says something like `` i guess we can now close oblivion gates too from now on '' if i recall correctly . 
  now in skyrim you have dragon blood , you 're the only one who can * really * kill a dragon and absorb its soul . 
  you definitely have n't played much with magic in oblivion . 
  while weapons are capped at around 30 damage , you can make combos to hit for over 1000 damage . 
  i 'd say play oblivion first since it is an older game it would be harder for you to go back if you started with skyrim . 
  ninja edit : tes games are n't direct sequels so you do n't need to play previous games to understand what 's happening , you can only recognize small references made to previous games as i said earlier . 
  so there 's actually gear in pvp ? 
  was n't it advertised when the game came out that the pvp is equalized ? 
  switched because got bored of gaming . 
  first distro was crunchbang and now it 's arch . 
  what power managing tools did you install ? 
  i know but i do n't want to play games , so i filled my time by messing around with crunchbang and later arch instead .
