  the bar has n't loaded yet , that 's why they only see a dark outline on the ground . 
  what about a vampire vampire hunter hunter ? 
  what 's the command that uses [ ] ? 
  i 'm pretty sure you do n't need to input those . 
  elemental fury if you 're melee . 
  they 're used to show syntax of the command , in that case [ skillname ] is replaced with any of the 20 something skills in the game . 
  i like the one where you must kill the vampires in pinemoon cave ( you get in from sybille stentor ) . 
  i know it 's just a simple almost radiant-like quest but that 's where i usually contract porphyric hemophilia . 
  when skyrim crashes at bethesda logo / right after skyrim logo it means some mod is missing master file or somekind of dependancy . 
  wasting $ 1000 just for gaming make me cringe , aswell as words like `` battlestation '' or any hardware marketed and labeled as gaming . 
  not to mention how the quality of modern games has dropped so much and everything is paid now instead of cool unlockables , music videos , secret levels ... etc, 
  what were you expecting ? 
  all i can see is bunch of kiddies yelling `` omgz gta v best gaem ever !!!!!! '' '', 
  whatever is the latest in arch `` stable '' repos . 
  they 're right , windows is a complete mess and the only reason people are stuck with it is professional software and gaming . 
  what 's the deal with arch anyway ? 
  a dozen commands and it 's already installed ... 
  it 's because i3 is like the ubuntu of tiling wms . 
  last time i played through db i noticed this , all other times i was stealthy but now i see that it was completely unnecessary . 
  yep it 's retarded i know , guild questlines was the major disappointment in skyrim for me . 
  why you do n't install grub instead ? 
   from what i read, 
  this is your problem , you need to use arch for yourself and only then you can judge it . 
  i 'm pretty sure most of arch `` haters '' are the ones who could n't install it for some reason ( arch install is only hard if you had zero linux experience , a few days of playing around in a terminal on some other distro and you 're ready to do it ) , and then they just talk shit about arch without any real arguments while real arch users are most of the times happy about their distro choice . 
  ` cfdisk ` is cli . 
  absolutely not , what ' a with the `` remaster everything '' mentality ? 
  do you want to pay $ 60 for the same game with mediocre graphical increases ? 
  bethesda needs to work on fo4 and es6 and not waste resources on pointless remasters, 
  now tell me why ? 
  i 'd much rather prefer bethesda to use their resources into making new games . 
  always solo . 
  please point me to the part where i shoved arch right into people 's face . 
  it 's the opposite actually , people come to arch forums asking stupid obvious questions and `` archers '' reply that maybe the distro is n't for them if they are n't willing to make an effort and always want their hand being held and guess what happens ... `` archers '' get the bad reputation for being elitist dicks . 
   i 've tried over and over , i have more than 15 years working with linux and arch does not want to install for me . 
  then explain to me how a retarded idiot that i am regarding to linux with 2 weeks experience on crunchbang managed to install arch successfully on 1 ^ st try dual boot with wangblows . 
  what i was saying is that people who talk shit about arch never got past livecd experience . 
  and you 're an evidence to this . 
  the key thing about it ( and pretty much everything you do ) is knowing what are you doing it and ** why ** because if you keep simply copy pasting you 'll never learn it . 
  for example a few days ago i was watching a video and the guy did ` mkfs.ext4 - e discard ` and i always used only ` mkfs.ext4 ` so instead of just copy pasting i went on searching about what is this ` - e ` flag so that i knew why would he use it . 
  i 've read somewhere that some major de wanted to move to qt ... 
  that username, 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ / r/linuxmasterrace, 
  ** linux updates : ** cool , new stuff !, 
  ** windows updates : ** oh no , not again !, 
  it looks like as if you are n't using any big texture mods . 
  stop !, 
  you violated the lore !, 
  black marsh is only habitable by argonians due to extreme conditions , even the daedra during the oblivion crisis had to run away from there . 
  even fallout 4 was n't announced yet so i think we 're pretty far from another es game . 
  it 's how permissions are displayed in linux . 
  r stands for read and w for write and depending on the position between the dashes , it gives permission to read and/or write to different users . 
  well it was kinda like that but it was because of the extreme conditions and not because argonians were badasses by themselves . 
  sadly , i now think that gaming is a waste of time and a childish uninteresting hobby . 
  makes me feel like a manchild , imagine going into a job interview and getting asked `` what are your hobbies ? '', 
  and you replying with `` oh i like to play videogames '' ... basically i 'm ashamed of gaming . 
  wasting $ 1000 on a pc just for gaming makes me cringe hard , as well as words like `` battlestation '' and any hardware marketed and labeled as `` gaming '' . 
  [ this is a bit harsh but basically what i think now ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fkjqurk.png ) except that i do n't go around talking shit to other people who like gaming . 
  plus all modern games are terrible : pre-order bonuses , drm , microtransactions , etc etc just make me want to play even less . 
  now you ask why do i sometimes still hangout here and stuff like / r/oblivion and / r/skyrim , it 's because pcmr was my reddit main page ever since i created this account and i still hold some sympathy towards amd and the elder scrolls despite not playing ( more to lore now ) . 
  disclaimer : i 'd like you to understand that i 'm not talking shit on every adult that likes gaming , it 's personal . 
  i expect downvotes for obvious reasons but who cares about internet points . 
  [ here 's a simple mod attempt by me to try to give vampires a bit of advantage ] ( http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/64155/ ? ), 
  recommendations are boring ? 
  damn ... anvil 's is my favorite , it is fairly simple but it 's just satisfying for some reason . 
   she got that grin that newbie smokers get that just wo n't leave their face, 
  whoa i though i was the only one , i tried hard but never could get that `` hehehehe '' face off . 
  shit . 
  i searched for `` club '' and found nothing related so i assumed it was n't posted yet :(, 
   it 's really not as bad as everyone says, 
  i noticed that a lot of people who talk shit about arch did n't get past installation so they just assume that arch is shit and go around throwing those retarded `` facts '' that we all hear . 
  people still use antiviruses in 2015 ? 
  [ a bit old but still works , update to 2015 is free too ] ( https://i.warosu.org/data/g/img/0458/76/1420069446681.png ), 
  the thing with no display manager is that you have a shell right after login so you can fix any problem you might have . 
  that blue on gedit hurts a lot . 
  it 's a joke ... 
  what about ` fdisk ` ? 
   well formatted response, 
  i noticed that on your original post you wanted to make a space, 
  like this , but in order to do that you need to do double enter like so : [ enter ], 
  [ enter ], 
  continue typing, 
  your flair, 
  my flair, 
  how do you `` hop '' between distros ? 
  do n't you loose all your data ? 
   catalyst support on arch is glorious . 
  what ? 
  last time i checked catalyst got removed from official repositories because of `` dissatisfaction with the quality and speed of development . '', 
  [ sauce ] ( https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/amd_catalyst ), 
  devs are dicks . 
  want money because they forked and os and made it a mac clone ... 
  why so much pleb ? 
  do you even manufacture your own processor architecture and fork the linux kernel to support your home made cpu ? 
  damn casuals, 
  if you downloaded them from the terminal then it requires a few extra steps for x.org to work . 
  [ anonymous proxy ] ( http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--tz6aeuqf--/17w1xa2nlni4ajpg.jpg ), 
  any hardware labeled and marketed as `` gaming '' is a no for me . 
  a gentoo question, 
  did you use ` genkernel ` or took a manual approach and edited the kernel for your hardware and stuff ? 
  if so , then do you have to do this every time a new kernel version arises in portage ?
