  and i 'm not even halfway done yet . 
  the key word that describes what needs to change is : ** diversity **, 
  but you killed seridur right ? 
  that fucking motherfucker . 
  did you type something about the reason why you canceling ? 
  good job . 
  seridur was a bitch . 
  the ps3 goty edition has a serious bug with the vampire cure quest . 
  [ video here ] ( http://youtu.be/_rfqhjzy5-0?t=2m20s ), 
  exclusives with 6 hours of gameplay . 
  650 ti is the best card you can get with $ 100 . 
  dude , a $ 1500 budget you can get a 780 ti and play the most recent games @ 1080p 60fps ultra and there will be still money left . 
  but if you do n't want a badass computer you can build one with a 660 card for around 500-600, 
  and it also possible to build a pc for around 700-800 with a gtx 770 which is an absolute beast of a card . 
  but i recommend checking / r/buildapc and ask for help . 
  when i was a little kid me and my dad used to go to a place with computers and internet . 
  we did n't even know about internet we just played minesweeper . 
  i think that ram is a bit overpriced and its 1333 , you can get for $ 60 1600 speed . 
  op 's one-handed skill must have gone through legendary atleast 5 times . 
  780 and 780 ti are diferent cards . 
  i 'm on phone right now so i ca n't link you some benchmarks , you need to search to see the performance of 770 780 and 780 ti . 
  look at their price and decide if it 's worth . 
  sorry for 1 week later response . 
  you say that rma 'd your card are you talking about gigabyte 770 ? 
   does n't matter how powerful the hardware is , it 's about how powerful the tv is, 
  does n't matter how powerful a car 's engine is , it 's about how poweful the wheel is . 
  all sapphire cards tri-x , vapor-x , toxic look sexy as fuck . 
  i just use ** shift + del ** . 
  i 'm so used to it that my recycle bin is always empty . 
  though i admit loosing some files because of that . 
  hmm okay . 
  i guess then my choice is going to be asus evga or msi, 
  i 'm watching an [ almost 5 hours movie ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiz4lgxllhw ) with all the cutscenes and cinematics from wc3 and frozen throne . 
  i 'm so amazed with the story , i have like 10 tabs open about everything of the warcraft world : burning legion , kil ` jaeden , sargeras , illidan , blood elf , alliance-horde war , forsaken , sylvanas windrynner , lich king etc. . 
  wow you 're `` together '' and did n't even kiss . 
  my first real long kiss was really unexpected i was 13 or 14 , was with my friends then she came and said hello and then i went a kiss in check but we both turned to lips so we kissed and i immediatly learned how to do it in the first second . 
  it 's really easy and i did n't even know the girl we only talked throu sms so if you 're together it should be even more comfortable . 
  this build is n't optimal since its just a r7 card . 
  there are builds out there for $ 600 that have gtx 760 . 
  yes excelent choice if you have the money . 
  and i wonder what brand are you choosing ? 
  there could be no other end . 
  you 've picked a bad time to get lost friend . 
  you can still drop $ 15 by going ddr3-1600, 
  yes you can . 
  ask serana to infect you . 
  only the dawnguard dudes will not talk to you . 
  i personally disagree . 
  you see , morrowind and oblivion got it right , you could play an orc mage or wood elf barbarian but you would n't be as effective as high elf mage or orc barbarian . 
  this is because of ** lore ** . 
  but in skyrim there 's very little almost none consquence to choose orc mage or high elf barbarian , which sucks since i 'm a tes lore fan . 
  yes . 
  in order to not start a new thread . 
  i would like to ask about pvp in rift . 
  * is this game p2w ( pay to win ) ? 
  do i have any chance in pvp as a person who does n't spend real cash on the game ? 
  * are the class choices balanced ? 
  because i hate when i pick a class that i like only to find out that some other class is better and my choice is useless, 
  * is it a huge grindfest ? 
  and a more personal question, 
  * is being an assassin cool in rift ? 
  is there somekind of invisible skill and is it effective ? 
  thank you and have a nice day, 
  yeah i 've read amazing stories about their awesome customer support . 
  definetly a good choice . 
  and i guess there 's no world pvp right ? 
  because my favorite mmos were the ones that had open world pvp which i spent countless hours alone or with friends fucking around . 
  [ their amd build is much better ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wis9lc6x55q ), 
  i 'm a windows krill and this makes me sad . 
  i have high respect on linux and i love the style of it since you probably need to know alot of commands and stuff , thats my shit right there . 
  when i build myself a new pc and get rid of this laptop i 'll gladly make a research and install linux . 
  and i hope that game developers focus on linux too that would be the best thing that pc gaming would get and would crush even more the filthy consoles . 
  [ stormcloak officer armor ] ( http://static-3.nexusmods.com/15/images/110/3809437-1352976483.jpg ), 
  just go some youtube videos about pc parts and how to build a pc [ this one from newegg is already almost 3 years old but you will still learn something ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpixatnggcw ), 
  no love for / r/linuxmasterrace ? 
  i 'm currently using windows 7 + crunchbang . 
  i picked it up because i just wanted to try out the terminal and feel like a hacker and do simple stuff so i don ' need the more * fancier * distros like ubuntu , linux mint etc. . . 
  when i get more experience with linux i probably gon na install archlinux because i heard it is for more advanced users ( need confirmation ), 
  crunchbang is very lightweight and very simple . 
  but for a simple system it comes with a nice set of lightweight apps out of the box so you can use it right away . 
  my dad has a mini laptop with windows 7 starter and it freezes alot and after installing crunchbang it runs like a charm . 
  one question , to uninstall a distro is to just format/delete the partition or do i need to do something else ? 
  okay so if to remove linux :, 
  * uninstall grub, 
  * format partition, 
  and if i want to only to switch distros ? 
  wow the red team was much more glorious back then . 
  i 've been having problems with amd drivers i keep getting a bsod when the video driver is installing ... do n't know if i should risk it again . 
  make this peasant play modded skyrim and he will get a heart attack . 
  wow the $ 520 is an amazing build . 
  the mods should definetly check these out and fix the ones in wiki . 
  only one thing , replace all seagates with wd caviar blues, 
  do you a hp laptop ? 
  i did this like 10 times but i still do n't remember how , i basically get the bsod and then reinstall and install without restarting and manage to get it working somehow . 
  so you got the bsod and just installed again or first uninstalled the bad install ? 
  i guess that wont work for me because i always get bsod when installing video driver . 
  older drivers like 10 . x worked for me , maybe it is because i have old card ati hd 5650m, 
  rip / u/metacommando you will be missed, 
  forever in our hearts, 
  fucking peasant killed our brother with his stupidity,
