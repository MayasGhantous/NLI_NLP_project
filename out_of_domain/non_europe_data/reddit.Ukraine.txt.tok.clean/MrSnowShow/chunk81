   user, 
   ** user **, 
   aur, 
   wiki, 
   rolling release, 
   gives a false sense of superiority over other distros, 
  something different :, 
  i played oblivion so i was kinda familiar with some things about elder scrolls and my biggest mistake was instead of enjoying the game like most of y' all did , i instead started using console because the commands were all the same as in the previous game so it fucked up my 1 ^ st time experience that i 'll never get back . 
  horrible creatures . 
  i 've already updated . 
  i 'm sitting on `` stable '' repos, 
  a lot of people uninstall it right at birth . 
  he 's an autistic neet do n't worry about it . 
  i like how debian just stays there quietly, 
  i personally think that medics are very fun to play , unlike a lot of healers/support in other games like lol for example . 
   backburner, 
   airblast cost, 
   almost no airblasts, 
   still better than phlog, 
  one thing that i find interesting is that linux has the original unix ` vi ` but freebsd and others which had the original ` vi ` since start dropped it and now use ` nvi ` instead . 
  you 're not even halfway there . 
  well , try it out for yourself , since you already installed kubuntu ... 
  windows needs like 20 minutes to figure out what the fuck is he going to update . 
  there 's something about liquid metal that triggers my sympathy . 
  i know there are more liquid metals but hg is the one , ca n't explain it . 
  kinda like when you see a 5/10 girl and you feel atracted to her and your head is like `` wtf is wrong with me that chick is like average '', 
  during the day i mostly open links and do moderation and stuff while at night on phone i mostly read comments with reddit is fun . 
  actually had a girl today tell me that she found funny how embarassed i was talking to them . 
  shit works yo, 
  but come on it 's so satisfying to reflect rockets/pipes/arrows and next time they 're scared to engage you . 
  once there was a soldier , demo and medic together and this soldier launched a crit rocket and the airblast killed them all . 
  huntsman reflects are also orgasmic . 
  obviously , competitive should be about skill and not rng . 
  the 65 % faster weapon switch is much more amazing that i though . 
  i 'm kinda hyperactive so i 'm constantly switching weapons and a while ago i tried using stock and it was hell . 
  look at their grammar , now look at their profile picture , now back again at their grammar and back again to their profile picture . 
  what can you see ? 
  i 'm 100 % sure those are maximum 14 year old kids , you really should n't be bothered by them . 
  this one time i commented on a random unrelated to tech video and this kid out of nowhere says `` lolololol you 're probably a console peasant '' and i 'm like what the fuck ? 
  * weakness to magic , shock , fire and frost 100 % in 10 ft for 30 seconds, 
  * shock , fire and frost damage 50 pts in 10 ft for 3 seconds, 
  destroys everything in normal difficulty . 
  overall magic is the best choice , everything the other classes do mages do it better . 
  if you have sex at night then the sperm is assleep so you wo n't get pregnant, 
   monolithic stuff is generally no good . 
  / r/hurdmasterrace ? 
  oh great analogy . 
  i hate to admit but i sense gnu/linux/systemd in the future :(, 
  i think they use their own repos so they delay it a bit . 
  run it without sudo and it works . 
  as you said os x comes from unix , so it had no relation whatsoever to linux because linux was written from scratch while os x traces back all the way to the original unix . 
  before a long trip make sure to check the car if it needs anything . 
  today i was very lucky because my car suddenly was hitting 95 degrees celsius and and when i was on 1st and 2nd gear shift it almost hit 100 c. i stopped and when i checked the radiator liquid was gone , if the engine overheats and you do n't immediately stop then it can fuck up pretty badly . 
  i think having 2 same flairs but one with steam icon is unnecessary . 
  just pick a flair and add whatever you want . 
  i almost always use it on red because disguise is n't a priority and i can almost always keep myself hidden and most people just focus on cart with makes it easy to do chainstabs . 
  damn i wish i had recorded mine a few days ago where i was being chased by 3 spies . 
  i ran up the stairs , jumped back and killed one of them then the other two got killed in sort of matador stabs like he swings to the right exposing his back to me and i rotate and backstab and then do the inverse for the last one . 
  i just stood there for like 10 seconds processing what has just happened . 
  that must be how stabby feels every match . 
  you have bash . 
   i did really enjoy that 9 hours of uninterrupted sleep i got last night . 
  that 's a bit selfish . 
  imagine if your parents thought the same way . 
  i hate this . 
  for a girl it 's perfectly acceptable to say `` no '' in various ways and some of them rude but when a guy rejects a girl that 's kinda unattractive then the shitstorm happens . 
  worse is `` this is my highest voted comment wow !!!!!! '', 
  i mostly see 9gag on twitch raids, 
  you talked about the evil within and wolfenstein but you should know that bethesda did not make those games , they only ** published ** them just like many others like dishonored , teso , fallout new vegas , etc , so they are not wasting development time . 
  bethesda ** made ** 4 games in the last 13 years which are morrowind , oblivion , fallout 3 and skyrim . 
  yes , but it does n't interfere with the development of bethesda 's own games . 
  the hotshotgg nida vs malphite outplay is still in my heart despite not playing and following league of legends for over a year and half . 
  i think yes , am3 + is old as fuck it 's about to time to replace the socket . 
  competition = both companies work harder to come up with better and cheaper products . 
  if amd gave up on cpu business then intel could charge you 500 $ for a processor worth 150 $ and you would have no choice since they would be the only company making processors . 
  because most of them are not old enough to know that amd kicked intel 's pentiums back in 2003 . 
  also about the amd housefire meme , they also are not old enough to remember fermi . 
  what i 'm trying to say is that there were ups and downs and amd did n't always stay behind like some believe, 
  well i do n't but autism is often associated with distros like arch because they 're unecessarely harder than the usual . 
  yeah , the personal identification number number, 
  lcd display - liquid crystal display display, 
  pdf format - portable document format format, 
  hiv virus - human immunodeficiency virus virus, 
  computer central processing unit processors, 
  this is the beginning of a totally new game ... 
  i imagine the same thing that has happened to skyrim . 
  what exactly are the problems you 're facing ? 
  it 's really easy , watch this :, 
  if they ignore you it 's mostly a question that can be easily solved if you read more carefully . 
  i 'll take no part in this . 
  you really should n't be bothered by anything posted on 4chan . 
  shield spells , potions , avoiding getting hit . 
  you can also go for stuff like 100 % reflect damage and 100 % magic resist/reflect/absorb but it kinda ruins the fun . 
  i know a lot of people do that , but i ca n't . 
  i simply ca n't be somebody else in a video game , which kinda sucks because i almost always make the same choices in every playthrough . 
  depends on your difficulty , on medium pretty much everything is viable . 
  tagged as shitpost but it was funny . 
  probably because i 'm a newfag, 
   drinking some juice + alcohol instead of beer like a real man, 
  they add an extra repo ...
