  fizzbuzz please, 
  what grep and awk do ? 
  i read the man pages but it 's like a foreign language to me . 
  okay so grep for searching stuff and awk also allows formatting . 
  completely unrelated : sys admin sounds really nice , i love to hang around in shell and using cli stuff . 
  whenever i think of a line of code , i get a feeling that it can be made much smaller and efficient so programming might not be for me . 
  #popular distros, 
  * archlinux is n't as hard as you made it sound . 
  also mention about godlike wiki and aur, 
  * debian needs more description , it 's staying strong for over 20 years , a lot of distros are based on debian , runs on pretty much everything ( a lot of architectures and runs with hurd and kfreebsd kernels too ) , has 3 branches ... 
  * elementaryos ( eos for short ) it aims to copy os x look and devs want money because they forked something and made it look like something else, 
  * fedora stable distro ? 
  what ? 
  * gentoo , you should add that it 's source based so you have to compile every package , also it is solution to any problem on your pc because if you can install gentoo , then you probably can fix whatever problem you had in the first place, 
  * mint : targets moderately advanced users ????? 
  mint 's goal is being the best out of the box experience , comes complete with a lot of proprietary software to achieve that, 
  * opensuse : targets both new and experienced users ( can also be made rolling with tumbleweed ), 
  * ubuntu yeah pretty much that, 
  that is unity 's dashboard , the other des do n't have that . 
  these things are bound to happen because ubuntu is run by a company , canonical 's commercial nature led them to do various controversial decisions whether in a community driven project with no goals of monetary profit such as arch these things do not happen . 
  because it 's the testing bench for rhel so all the newest packages ship first to fedora . 
  the arch install is basically instead of clicking next , you input a command . 
  i 'd like a c solution, 
  depends on how you approach the install like if you use ` genkernel ` or not . 
  example : in arch to install the base system you just write a single command ` pacstrap base / mnt ` as in gentoo you have to navigate to gentoo website using cli browsers or use stuff like ` wget ` to download and then extract a stage 3 tarball and a portage snapshot . 
  whoa that 's fucking amazing . 
  gentoo has captured my attention for a while but i 'm afraid it will bake my cpu . 
  i think most people who talk about freedom they mean the freedom of messing around with your system and not being forced to certain choices . 
  if you believe in random iq tests on the internet then you probably do not have a 3 digit one . 
  what do you mean by arch 's newer installer ? 
  have n't the process always been something like :, 
  partition, 
  mount, 
  locale timezone hostname and other config files, 
  what about this ? 
  #include < stdio.h , 
  #include < stdlib.h , 
  return ( !, 
  int main ( void ) {, 
  const char data [ ] = '' % d \\ n \\ 0fizz \\ n \\ 0buzz \\ n \\ 0fizzbuzz \\ n '' ;, 
  const char * ptrs [ ] = { data , data + 4 , data + 10 , data + 16 } ;, 
  for ( size_t i = 1 ; i < = 100 ; + + i ), 
  printf ( ptrs [ fb_index ( i ) ] , i ) ;, 
  return exit_success ;, 
  it 's just an unnecessary complication , i 've already seen it done with css, 
  < title  fizz-buzz < / title ,

  p : : before {,

  frontend developers have no excuse, 
  this is kinda what i feel . 
  ever since i learned linux , after coming back to windows i feel like i 'm in a very disorganized pile of mess . 
  shitty directories and ambiguous names , and cmd is beyond awful . 
  if you do not count games and programs support , windows does not offer anything good at all .

  common sense 2015 is the best , too bad that a lot of people uninstall it right at birth . 
   but each time you update your kernel you have to use mkinitcpio after the headers are installed . 
  i 'm pretty sure pacman already does this automatically . 
  i 've never ran ` mkinitcpio ` after a kernel update . 
  oh , i use open source drivers so i did n't have that problem . 
  it 's because kids are not old enough to remember how amd kicked intel back in 2003 and that fermi gpus were housefires too . 
  this shit is ruining tifu . 
  bunch of kids come here with their sexual fantasies and write fake stories so they have a false sense of manliness while in reality they are hideous creeps that girls run away from .

  cubic litres do not exist , 1 cl is 1 centi litre which is x100 smaller than 1 litre, 
  we use ^ ^ 3 for cubic and not c. like so :, 
  1 dm ^ 3 = 1 l, 
  which means that 1 cubic deci-meter ( x10 smaller than a meter ) is equal to 1 litre, 
  because it comes with almost nothing by default making it a light system , it avoids over engineering so you do n't need to mess around with kernel modules and stuff , so it 's really easy to add all the programs that you need . 
  you 're using the ubuntu of tiling wms . 
  [ here 's a handy guide for you all ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ura75nc.jpg ), 
  edit : made by / g /, 
  qbittorrent because it was written in c++ and i have more sympathy towards it than python which is what deluge was written with . 
  according to my handy [ guide ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ura75nc.jpg ) it 's bad , you have a good chance to get banned from private trackers if you use that . 
  i did n't make it, 
  i did n't make it . 
  eh cl cl cl ... probably a typo . 
  shit , i was in charge of css but / u/minsctheranger made a new css code a while back and i do n't have a mac to test this : /, 
  edit : just saw that safari can be downloaded for windows , got ta log on windows and try out there . 
  you say it to somebody else , not to your own comment, 
  he 's actually right , you 're very limited if your purpose is gaming . 
  there 's really no argument that windows is the best solution for your average gamer because it supports all the games natively that they want to play . 
  funny thing is that it 's exactly the opposite both nvidia and intel bully amd from both gpu and cpu sides so that they can get monopoly with shady practices . 
  one example how project cars is purposely unoptimizable on amd cards because nvidia wo n't allow access to gameworks code . 
  but in tomb raider , nvidia had poorer performance with tressfx but amd being a bro released the code and nvidia was able to release a driver to work around on it .
