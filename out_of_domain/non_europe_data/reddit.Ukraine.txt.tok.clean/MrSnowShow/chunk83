  it 's because ubuntu is run by a corporation ( canonical ) and due to their commercial nature they made several controversial decisions like for example your searches in the unity dashboard being sent to amazon so they can display ads related to your searches . 
  but these are mostly `` ethical '' complains , ubuntu is n't bad per se , it 's a nice os for newcomers . 
  i 'd suggest to not worry about it and later if you want do you own research and do your own judgment on the topic . 
  i suggest you use the os for a while instead of judging it by others ' experience . 
  people tend to complain that a particular os sucks but a lot of times it 's their fault for not knowing how to use it properly because most newcomers use it the same way as windows and things end up not working how they should . 
  about arch , if you have zero unix environment experience it is very overwhelming and frustrating , i ( and pretty much everyone ) do not recommend it , [ do n't listen to guys like this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fh80kcf.png ), 
  467 , no de installed, 
  do n't forget gentoo 's own project openrc < 3, 
  bspwm, 
  yep, 
  http://fixubuntu.com ( to stop your searches being sent to third parties ), 
  and, 
  http://www.ubuntu.com/about/about-ubuntu/flavours ( to choose another desktop environment ), 
  alias please = ` sudo !! ', 
  yeah it 's nice but does n't come with a status bar ( but has an example one in github using bar-aint-recursive ), 
  instead of talking to that blode chick ... 
  want my ps1 ? 
  here you go :, 
  \\ [ \\ e [ 00 ; 37m \\ ]   [ \\ w ] \\ \\ $ \\ [ \\ e [ 0m \\ ], 
  looks like this :, 
  i would n't say manjaro is arch with installer , manjaro is trying to be it 's own thing so it 's more an arch based distro . 
  antergos is the real arch with an installer . 
   first things first i tried installing steam from the aur on antergos, 
  it 's in official repos , but you first must enable multilib . 
  2 . uncomment [ multilib ] and what 's below it, 
  yeah it 's called orbis os which is based on freebsd 9.0, 
  this . 
  \u03bctorrent after 2.2.1 became filled with ad/crap/spyware it probably installed half of those crap programs . 
  i know this because my mom installed it too without unchecking anything and it installed like 10 bullshit programs ( toolsbars , startpage modifiers etc etc. . . ), 
   non-pirating, 
  torrent = !, 
  pirating, 
  yeah , it 's now just a shadow of it 's former self and can be almost considered malware because of how much bullshit it comes with . 
  glory days of version 1 . x rip never forget, 
  i saw a very nice `` former pc master race '' flair , it said :, 
  * this sub is peasantry of a different flavor *, 
  run it, 
  what do you mean by a torrent client not being able to download torrents ? 
  well that 's obviously a problem on your side and not qbittorrent, 
  dude qbittorrent works fine , it 's a problem on your side . 
   half the time these morons have utter pieces of junk like alienwares or barely better , its hilarious to look at how much they paid for some of these piles of shit . 
  ascension , not so much . 
  and then just spend all their day browsing reddit , not playing any games for more than 10 minutes to appreciate `` muh graphics '' and think how better they are than console users and take screenshots of trees instead of playing . 
  i 'm so thankful that i did n't build an `` epik gaymen rig '' because i totally lost interest in games , especially the single player ones where i used to pay attention to the story and stuff . 
  there 's a very handy button under the comments which is `` source '', 
  * backs away *, 
  that 's just a different flavor of peasantry . 
  edit : oh shit just read the 15 year old part, 
  so you want all of us to not generate discussion and just say, 
  `` wow very nice '', 
  `` i like your rig '', 
  `` looks good bro '', 
  criticism is n't bad you know ? 
  oh shit , did n't realize it was a res feature . 
  mine was crunchbang 11 ( rip in piece ) in 2014 . 
  this is late :(, 
   ` razer make very low quality products , they value marketing over quality ', 
  this is actually a legit comment , you ca n't expect everyone to like everyone 's setup . 
  i particularly would hate to have a setup like that , all razer hardware are full of buzzwords and marketed as `` epik gaymin pro gear !!!! '', 
   wi-fi and linux do n't get along very well, 
  why is that ? 
  i though that was long ago ... 
  my wireless connection is better on linux than windows ( on windows it used to drop connection for a few seconds for some reason , and random wireless restarts while linux suffered none of those issues ) . 
  not pay to win . 
  pay to progress faster, 
  there 's really no challenge in leveling , there 's no point in any leveling guides . 
  tera leveling requires like almost zero brainpower . 
  i 'm pretty sure everybody gathers a bunch of mobs instead of killing them all one by one . 
  i like how amd is the `` first '' in many things . 
  first 1 ghz processor , first gddr5 card , first 8 core processor , first x86_64 processor ( hence the name amd64 for 64 bit ) and now first to have hbm memory . 
  yeah , i just hope that it performs just as nicely too . 
   nah , lost respect for that writer when he suggested amd come up with their own proprietary libraries the other day . 
  sadly , amd by playing fair is only hurting themselves while nvdia and intel use dirty tactics to gain monopoly on the market . 
  i hope so . 
  nvidia and intel also had their downs ( athlon 64 kicked ass and fermi 470 and 480 were housefires too ), 
  i still remember your green toothless master race flair . 
  for some reason res has stopped counting the upvotes that i gave you so it 's suck at +78, 
  long ago when flairs used to have a simple round border, 
  then it was probably gold , my mind all fucked up ... 
  linux made me stop gaming, 
  obviously ubuntu . 
  ubuntu 's purpose is to be the best out of the box experience . 
  arch targets a different userbase . 
  i kinda like it , gaming now is horrible compared to back then . 
  gaming now is all about business, 
  honestly that is n't a big surprise . 
  it 's logical that a professional team that is being paid working 8h per day on a piece of software should come up with something better than random volunteers . 
  til, 
  most people do n't like being told that they got ripped/tricked/were wrong and even when providing all the sources and evidences they still subconsciously ignore all of that in order to prevent buyer 's remorse . 
  i ( my parents ) bough hp twice . 
  never again . 
  download all the drivers to an usb flash drive, 
  install a clean windows and install all the drivers, 
  wait for 200 updates to be done during all night with ocassional freezes and multiple reboots, 
  i did n't say ubuntu was the best , i just said it is their goal . 
  but yeah mint probably provides better out of the box experience because it comes with various proprietary extras pre installed ( flash player , codecs , etc. . . ), 
  pretty much the only game i play , but for like 20 minutes and then get bored . 
  i 'm also looking forward for the matchmaking update , to the esports !, 
  depends if you want to shrink or expand it , you 'll have to use super + alt or super + alt + ctrl , so if it does n't work with one then try another . 
  reflecting those is also fucking amazing .
