  it 's so nice encountering that soldier again and suddenly he is n't spamming rockets like a maniac, 
  mine is the default which is the same as yours . 
  do 2 terminals ( one on left other on right ) then try to expand the left one with super + alt + l, 
  and try to shrink it with super + alt + ctrl + h, 
  how did you install the drivers ? 
  you should try to reinstall them manually . 
  read the wiki page on nvidia proprietary drivers . 
  good job, 
  check out / r/unixporn and    / g/desktop for a definition of `` ricing '', 
  yeah but what distinguishes them is the functionality , some people code amazing lemonbars/dzens that have the same functionality as de 's status bars while being nice looking and integrating with whole theme . 
  yeah , the arena grand champion from oblivion ( hero of kvatch ) became sheogorath . 
  this is one big reason i have windows update , the progress is hidden by an useless progress bar ** that does n't even show any progress ** , it just freezes and unfreezes whenever it wants . 
  countless of times i 've waited for hours only to find out that the update process got stuck and i did n't know that because of the fucking useless `` progress '' bar . 
  on linux you are given the output of almost everything that 's happening so if something goes wrong you know exactly why . 
  as a spy the most satisfying trick stabs are to, 
  * full uber medics, 
  * any pyro ( do n't ever miss a chance to humiliate a pyro ), 
  * scouts ( these guys seem think that because they 're fast they 'll never get stabbed ), 
  also ambassador headshots can be considered as `` trickstabs '' but for the gun . 
  people can avoid trickstabs , but there 's not much they can do to getting shot in the head . 
  you 're confusing antergos with manjaro . 
  i just wanted to be a badass terminal user ... 
   caring about what a random stranger is doing, 
  yours is funny too, 
  does oblivion crash when exiting it ? 
  if so , then that is whats preventing from saving the settings because oblivion fails to exit properly . 
  downloading [ fast exit ] ( http://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/22410/ ) fixed it for me . 
  [ if you want to learn more about alchemy i suggest watching this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzhck9nfuvk ), 
  not sure , i 've only tried with the fast exit fix and it works . 
  i 'd say the red hat family , ubuntu is run by a corporation that kinda want their own thing while red hat family is the biggest contributor to the kernel and a lot of devs use fedora . 
  [    / w / ] ( https://boards.4chan.org/w/ ), 
  depends on your difficulty and level . 
   conjuring as my other main plan of attack, 
  because how simple the spell casting is in oblivion , playing mage/something hybrid is more enjoyable because you do n't have to switch between spells and bow like in skyrim which kinda breaks the flow in my opinion . 
  a mage/archer or a mage/two-handed is impossible to play for me but in oblivion i can . 
  around 2010 and maybe earlier ( i think ) ea was one of the first that i remember was introducing games with day 1 dlc , microtransactions and all the other bullshit such as having one time codes for games to justify some dlc that was clearly ripped from the game but in reality they were trying to prevent people from buying/borrowing used games . 
  yeah , but you ca n't use any spells while holding the bound bow or else you 'll need to recast the spell . 
  but you ca n't cast any other spells with a bow in your hands . 
   quickly disarm yourself, 
  it 's not very quick and kinda breaks flow in my opinion . 
  and if you use bound bow you need to recast it . 
  in normal difficulty pretty much everything is viable ... 
  point me to them . 
  i 'd start with getting a different gtk theme and icons . 
  ( tips ) fedora because it 's the official redditor distro, 
  linux has games . 
  yeah it has some , not everyone wants the latest aaa epik mainstream games . 
  apart from having the support of various programs ( adobe suite , autocad , etc etc ) which is just a consequence of having the biggest market share , i do n't see anything `` cool '' that windows has by itself . 
  you do n't understand the joke , reddit is associated with fedoras and neckbeards just like gentoo is the official / g / distro, 
  ohai there ayy lmao flair on / r/linuxmasterrace, 
  i love to run the quick-fix , makes playing medic a bit more exciting . 
  engie looks nice with the construction hat . 
  demo too with the bombs around his chest . 
  i hate spy default mask , does n't make him look like a badass assassin . 
  25 hours spy, 
  and the rest is less than 7 hours and sniper last with like 16 minutes . 
  i started playing spy as my first class , i used the yer because i though it was better ... 
  i suffered a lot for obvious reasons . 
  so yeah i 'm still pretty nooby but sometimes against clueless players i manage to pull of some of the trickstabs and have full minute orgasms . 
  tf2 made me buy a butterfly knife and i learned the move he does from the `` meet the spy '' official video . 
  it 's / b / not whole 4chan, 
  i do n't get it : /, 
  ( not native speaker ), 
  edit : i do now, 
  `` amd gets hot '' this meme needs to go , that 's the reference r9 290x , it 's like saying that every nvidia card misses half a gb of vram ... if you get the sapphire tri-x it manages to be cooler than nvidia in some cases . 
  i feel like every new kid that starts with the `` bbbut amd is hot ! '', 
  needs a history lesson on fermi . 
  hd 5650 ** m **, 
  true , and i still suffer because i do n't have much playtime on other classes . 
  some time ago i started learning rocket jumping ( i still ca n't chain 2 rocket jumps together ) but that taught me how to move in the air , now i take advantage of it whenever i can as a spy . 
  is lightning better than tri-x ? 
  i once spent whole afternoon playing minecraft , and when i got out i saw the sun setting and had a small panic attack `` shit the monsters are coming '' . 
  8800gt , but i returned it because pentium 4 bottleneck . 
  yeah but if intel 's aggressive marketing is making the task difficult , they were sued back in 2005 because of that . 
  that 's the iso keyboard layout , used mostly in european countries . 
  how 's the new chinkpad keyboard compared to the old ones ( after t420 , x220 , etc ), 
  oh wow a jedi academy reference, 
  i accidentally learned this because super + 1-9 was the hotkey to switch workspaces in arch, 
  sadly i could n't play any more minecraft after the beta 1.8 adventure update : /, 
  hunger system is annoying when i want a few friends to join me because now i have 1-2 more mouths to feed regularely , back then if they were careful they would not need to eat . 
  and i seem to have terrible luck with spawn points because i always spawn in the middle of the fucking jungle or desert and there are no animals for some reason ( or just one type ) and i ca n't accomplish anything before the 1st night . 
  \\  using meme arrow on plebbit, 
  i want to replay the game with all my upgrades , if dishonored had that i 'd play the fuck out of it . 
  i know that because every game that had that option i ended up replaying them like 20 times . 
  material design is sexy as fuck . 
   transparent terminals, 
  \\  using the autistic meme arrow outside of 4chin, 
  i 'm saging this shit, 
  paying 200 % for 160 % performance is something i 'll never understand . 
  shit , have to message / u/minsctheranger he made the new css code, 
  i 'm still in one of them because ~ ~ people ~ ~ kids take seriously the navy seal copypasta, 
  when people refer 4chan they 're almost always referring / b / which is just a portion of the community . 
  the teenager who wants fake praise from random strangers for things he fantasized about strikes again, 
  whoa i remember the 1 year anniversary like it was yesterday , time really flies . 
  i 'm afraid that shit will fuck up my arch partition . 
  this page already has a small income of posts and yet people still manage to repost . 
  i also have some strange sympathy towards grep, 
  my dad has a 1025c . 
  runs linux fine but wangblows is a nightmare, 
  yeah my dad could n't even browse google earth properly,
