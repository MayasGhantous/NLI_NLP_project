  if you get a gpu with titan written somewhere for pure gaming then you 're a fucking retard . 
  people are afraid it will become gnu/linux/systemd, 
  i 'm not sure but i think gnome has already systemd as a dependancy . 
  i also like redirections ''  and   '', 
  that 's a long way of saying that you were cucked by nvidia ... 
   fairly new to linux, 
   open bsd, 
  why ? 
  is that the x220 ? 
  lets start a new vegas song !, 
  i got spurs that jingle jangle jingle !, 
  back before the 1.5 patch i remember you only needed 400ish daggers to do it . 
  i 'm thinking on buying one of those bad boys , i went to the local store just to get an idea of the size and damn 13 '' is small as fuck and the x220 is even smaller ... 
  so i was just wondering how 's the experience on a small screen, 
  i think those got nerfed too on patch 1.9 ( ? ), 
  maybe ... 
  thanks for quick review , just one more question : how are the speakers ? 
  \\  realism, 
  nice flair mate . 
  i was thinking of being sys admin because all i do properly on a computer is troubleshooting software stuff , but damn all the terms are unfamiliar and sound scary . 
  i see no point , you can edit any of the flair 's text to your linking and the transitioning period does n't take long at all . 
  i 'm also not familiar with the process of networking and all that stuff . 
  dhcp server , submasket ip , dns and other stuff that i have no idea it exists . 
  but do mind that i 'm a american high school last year equivalent so i have n't had any it classes yet . 
  bethesda softworks \u2260 bethesda game studios, 
  the evil within was just published by bethesda, 
  one thing that i remember though is that skyrim 's physics are linked to fps , so if the framerate went too high then [ weird shit started to happen ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfcdrma2daq ) so i hope it does n't happen again . 
  lost keys + rosetta stoned because lost keys is like the intro , love the atmosphere it creates . 
  what about wings pt 2 + viginti tres + wings for marie pt 1 as one track ? 
  i used to do that in elder scrolls . 
  thank god that i still have n't looked for item codes for fallout or else i would ruin my experience too, 
  yep , fat man was on nagasaki and little boy was in hiroshima . 
  there were a few more controversies like the renaming of `` morphine '' to `` med-x '' to make it legal in australia ( not surprised , australia seem to ban everything ) ... 
  simply because this is ** linux ** masterrace . 
  adults , but kids ended up liking cartoons so they are for kids now . 
  in older cartoons such as tom and jerry bugs bunny etc etc. . you can find a lot of adult references that you did not understand as a kid , for example i remember one instance where it starts with bugs bunny reading a book called `` how to multiply '' . 
  and there 's also plenty of alcohol , hot chicks and violence while cartoons of today are all very educational . 
  whoa , i did n't know fullchan had cp, 
  ps4 was a real bro because they did n't follow microsoft 's nazi restrictive tactics . 
  how someone can still consider buying an xbone is beyond me . 
  people who post stuff like that on fb is cringy as fuck . 
  \\  finish game, 
   vampire necromage light-armour dual-wield, 
  exactly what i 've been playing , legendary difficulty is not even much challenging and i played with unenchanted gear . 
  one important thing is that necromage perk affects other perks but you must activate those other perks ** after ** getting necromage . 
  so for example 2 ranks in dual flurry make your attack speed 1.35 but if you take necromage and then 2 ranks of dual flurry your attack speed will be 1.69 ( almost double ) . 
  how 's the 13 inch screen ? 
  i 'm thinking on buying a thinkpad x220 and a bit worried about the experience because i 'm currently on a 15.6 inch laptop . 
  i 'm talking about physical dimensions not the resolution ... 
  engie with a flamethrower would make it impossible for spies to fuck up his setup + airblast rockets , pipes , stickies ... 
  depends on your difficulty , sometimes i wish they just flew around because i 'm almost dying and the fucker keeps melting me . 
  mages guild, 
  thieves and fighters guild, 
  the dark brotherhood is simply amazing , not perfect but the best in my opinion , the only faction that i felt as part of a family and lucien lachance is my favorite npc in the game . 
  mages guild is pretty nice , i actually enjoyed the recommendation quests ( my favorite is anvil 's , it is very simple but satisfying ) , my only complain is how dissapointing mannimarco is compared to the build up that was generated before the encounter . 
  thieves guild i feel like i 'm being unfair because the stealth mechanics are awful which clouds my judgement on the fairly good questline where you actually steal stuff and messing around with lex was fun . 
  fighters guild is my least favorite probably because of average missions ( it only gets fun towards the end when you can kill a particular character who is a little bitch ) and modryn is the only cool character on the entire faction ( and maybe burz gro-kash ), 
  ~ ~ lucien lachance because of his badass voice that compliments his personality . ~ ~, 
  edit : shit i read the title wrong , my fav npc is probably count janus hassildor because he 's so mysterious and i share his `` breed '', 
  i 'm pretty sure almost any computer can run oblivion just fine , it 's a 9 year old game ... 
  the dupe glitch is when you have a bunch of scrolls in your inventory , you click on them twice and then drop an item that you want to dupe and it will be multiplied by the amount of scrolls you have . 
  i like most from the minor changes category in the recommended mods wiki page . 
  the `` fucker '' is actually the lucien lachance the most badass assassin in tamriel . 
  what ? 
  lucien is the speaker and not the listener , and it 's the black hand and not dark hand . 
  is ellis ' cap a sign of f2p ? 
  i 'm a f2p and i use it instead of gibus . 
  when you play spy and realize the number of pyros on the enemy team gradually increase . 
  when you play spy and realize the number of pyros on the enemy team gradually increase . 
  when your team looses but your score is higher than enemy team . 
  eli5 difference ? 
  2 year no update anniversary here we go ) :, 
  and a 350w psu . 
  it 's on the sidebar , 23 july, 
  really ? 
  what kind of work you do ? 
  for example i had to work a bit on unity 3d engine and my guess is that it would be a bit harder on a 12.5 '' laptop . 
  my mom got me it a few days ago , my first physical album ( i listen most of music on youtube ) . 
  best 16 $ she spent and i 'm planning on getting the rest . 
  i really hope i wo n't be needing to use it again , as a student who will be studying the us equivalent of cs/ce which i assume we will code a lot and not mess with gui oriented stuff then the smaller 13 '' laptops are fine right ? 
  breton for playing because of stats . 
  argonian just because of lore . 
  i was a dark elf fan in oblivion but for some reason every dark elf i met in skyrim seemed like a douchebag so it changed my view on dark elves a bit , although i like how they 're good in magic and stealth which is my favorite combo . 
  i have it on loadout but always forget to use it , my 10h of playtime might justify that . 
  yeah i kinda fucked up that , i got agent of mara before necromage so i wasted perks on magic resist from alteration tree ( i 'm a breton ), 
  it 's the forbidden dance !!!!, 
  i 'm not sure i have n't played the game for like 2 years so i do n't know what changed but back then water mages were op . 
  from the same singer :, 
  yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaahhh !, 
  oh i see , so stats are n't really that accurate as i though, 
   is it normal for krosis to be getting owned at lvl 25 ? 
  it all depends on the difficulty and what kind of build you 're doing . 
  in elder scrolls your level is not directly related to the power of your character . 
  elemental fury + dual wielding is crazy at legendary but only after a few levels , decent gear and depending on how much min-maxing you do . 
  w+m 1 ? 
  `` got ta start keeping a knife im my boot , tired of getting disarmed '', 
  yes ? 
  you can cast a frenzy spell to make him fight you, 
  dunkey really knows how to enjoy video games ... 
  a proper shell .
