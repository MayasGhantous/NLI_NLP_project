  do n't forget the / r/linuxmasterrrace, 
  i find it hilarious how peasants keep lying to themselves just to feel better . 
  i see you got a helmet on your favorites menu , for roleplaying purposes i also do that . 
  well the one i spent most time with was assassin with bow + dagger . 
  i did this because :, 
  * two handed weapons are too slow for my style and stamina is a bitch, 
  * i absolutely hate sword and shield [ i hate this type of guys ] ( http://images.uesp.net/thumb/a/a2/ob-class-warrior.jpg/200px-ob-class-warrior.jpg ), 
  * dual wielding does n't have any cool combos so you basically just spam right + left click for tougher enemies, 
  * conjuration : summoning takes too long and dumb ai makes it worse . 
  i like to deal with enemies fast . 
  bound weapons are awesome but there 's limited choice , and they also offer no proper scaling into late-game . 
  * destruction is repetitive and basically you just gon na dual cast that incinerate because why would you use anything else if incinerate is the fastest one ? 
  * illusion is kinda fun but again , i like to deal with enemies the fast way , so i 'm not gon na take my time pacifing and raging them against their allies and just watch . 
  i want them dead . 
  * basically magic in skyrim is the biggest dissapointment ever , staves are useless , the spells take too long to cast ( master ones ) , you mana regen feels like a fucking snail when in combat , you have no spellmaking and have like 1/3 of all the spells that existed in oblivion and morrowind . 
  and the clothing options suck balls and no disadvantages to wearing armor . 
   1 - how long have you been a part of / r/skyrim, 
  maybe 6 months when i started to browse reddit, 
   2 - why do you come to / r/skyrim, 
  cuz i 'm bored and i love elder scrolls, 
   3 - what type of submissions would you prefer to see more of in / r/skyrim, 
  i have no idea ... lore related stuff , discussions ... fan art and fan writings , maybe a thread with your characters photos and backstory ( but i think ppl make those once in a while ), 
   4 - what type of submissions would you prefer to see less of in / r/skyrim, 
  * skyrim is beautiful ... please go to / r/skyrimporn, 
  * arrow in the knee, 
  * chicken in riverwood, 
  * i guess it was just the wind bandit with 50 arrows in his head, 
  * ice spike on your character, 
  * i have no potions so i 'm just gon na eat 50 tomatoes to heal myself, 
  * serana revives a cow, 
  * crossbow shooting swords, 
  * guards saying that they want to fight dragons after just killing one, 
   5 - would you like to see a weekly community thread where the community can speak their mind similar to / r/teslore 's community thread and which day would you prefer to see the community thread ? 
  i do n't know what that is , but i 'm down . 
   6 - because i like to see the world burn , stormcloaks or imperials, 
  stormcloacks ofcourse , even tho ulfric might be a racist piece of shit , he atleast is n't a fucking pussy like the imperials getting buttfucked by those thalmor motherfuckers . 
  removing talos ? 
  bitch please , tiber septim conquered whole tamriel so it became the empire and then he became a god , now the `` empire '' that he created back in 2e ( i think ) is against him ? 
  wtf !, 
  i miss feels : ' c, 
  level up is way faster ? 
  i stopped playing when 3.0 was released , what can you tell me about it ? 
  because i always found that leveling was big hassle with all those quests over the map . 
  you do n't like tera combat ? 
  as a heavy pvp dude that hates grinding :, 
  * ** no pay to win pvp **, 
  * balanced classes ( all must be viable ), 
  * preferably , no auto aim on enemy ( you know , that kind of click on enemy and just use all ur spells on him ) . 
  * ability to jump and dodge stuff , so your skill and reflex matter more than just gear, 
  * open world pvp ( just walk around killing ppl ), 
  * 2 factions that hate each other or even more . 
  or make the player neutral , then be able to join a faction to battle the oposing faction ( dofus did this awesomly ) . 
  * fast paced pvp ( ex : dragon nest ), 
  but i do n't want an mmo totally focused on pvp ( ex : archeage ) so for pve it 's, 
  * able to level up fast ( ex : dcuo ), 
  * fast quests that dont in involve kill 30 mobs and gather 15 plants, 
  * no fucking slow character running speed, 
  * not having your quest log with 50 quests to do, 
  * cool raids that can be done through the leveling rather than just in endgame, 
  * all classes need to be viable, 
  * fast 2-4 ppl raids as well as huge 10-12 ppl epic raids for hardcore gamers . 
  so basically in my opinion , dcuo is a mmo for me . 
  * you level fast, 
  * i love how we can choose for our superhero/villain movement type : super speed , flying or acrobatics, 
  * the pvp mechanics are nice ( rock paper scissors combat ), 
  * blocking beats heavy atacks, 
  * heavy atacks beat ranged atacks, 
  * ranged atacks beat blocking, 
  * you can open world pvp , or just switch to pve channel if u hate it, 
  * the alerts/raids are fun and easy to join, 
  ** but ** there 's one huge issue that is stopping me for playing it which is very sad : ** the fucking dlcs and legendary membership . 
  okay so basically the best gear that you can get is in the highest tier of raids but the highest tiers are for ppl that own dlcs or are legendary so they will have better gear than you . 
  i also love this game . 
  too bad legendary and dlcs ruin this beautiful game . 
  in order to get the best gear or play the other 50 % of the powers we need to pay . 
  $ 1500 cash limit ? 
  there are nice games out there that you can play for f2p and do n't need to pay to be able to get the best gear . 
  + the cash limit is the biggest bullshit ever . 
  holyfuckingshit i just saw a video about wildstar combat and it looks amazing . 
  edit : i see it 's not out yet . 
  oh and it is subscription based . 
  but unfortunately i 'm a 17 year old student , i have money from summer work but do n't have any income so i ca n't play . 
  this game looks amazing though, 
  currently i 'm back playing tera . 
  it is pretty fun with the target system and you have dodges . 
  but the leveling is a pain in the ass because you have to basically pick every quest in the area and do them and only then move to next area . 
  you can ignore the quests if your level is geting higher that the campaign quests but i do n't want to miss any potential rewards . 
  i did a fuckton of them and just cant imagine myself starting a new char . 
  the only downside to tera so far for me . 
  is it open or closed beta ? 
  if it is closed then is there a way to get a key ? 
  awesome , i 'll definetly check it out after i clean my 2 gb free hdd . 
  i would really love to play gta iv, 
  remove the empty place for hdds and ssds so you have better air flow . 
  i mean the empty ones because they only take space . 
  if the potatobox has somekind of 7790 and the ps4 has 7850 then i think the r7 cards should be out of questions because they 're rebranded 77xx . 
  or am i wrong ? 
  what is the problem with archers having to aim ? 
  landing that penetrating and radiant arrow and taking away half hp of the poor sucker is a huge rewarding feeling, 
  go for help in / r/buildapc,
