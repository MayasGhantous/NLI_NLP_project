  on a steep incline mine needs some acceleration or else car goes down . 
   wastes 1700 on a gaming pc and does n't even get a high end gpu , the most important part . 
  this is something i 'll never understand . 
  so you went from ubuntu to ubuntu cinnamon ? 
  you should n't be using the chain skills thingy in the 1st place ... 
   also , dont ever use spacebar for chaining anything other than retaliate . 
  this , it 's the difference between being just a burden to the raid or being actually useful, 
   using this guide, 
  your first mistake , you should be using the beginner 's guide, 
  your mistake i think is pretty common , you need to install ` dialog ` and ` wpa_supplicant `, 
  do n't forget the second part of creating ` / etc/locale . conf ` and adding ` lang = en_us . utf-8 ` because only generating locales does not do anything . 
  none , because they 're almost useless . 
  i do n't need fancy login screens and i like how the shell is available right there . 
  check out fedora codenames ... beefy miracle are u srs ? 
  summer / g / is real ... 
  although i do n't play anymore , tera was the best fun i had in a mmo in all mmos i tried . 
  combat just feels fucking awesome , every hit that you do feels rewarding as fuck . 
  and the game is also very gorgerous . 
  you 'll have a surprise later in the game but i wo n't spoil it for you . 
  stupid, 
  wow it 's truly gnu/linux/systemd now . 
  is systemd 's bootloader based on gummiboot or did it took over it ? 
  no , you can ** dual ** boot with it . 
  does xorg.conf even exist anymore ? 
  is there an / r/averagedickproblems, 
  are you one of those who goes into    / g / and asks retarded tech related questions ? 
  fedora is red hat 's testing bench . 
  dual, 
   pvp and pve gear has been combined, 
  oh my fucking god i love this , it always bothered how you needed to invest so much time in order to start pvping competitively . 
  this change is fucking amazing , i 'm currently not playing any games for quite a few months but this made me reconsider . 
  is there a thing such as processor syndrome ? 
  i imagine it as something like this :, 
  processor syndrome - when a person is spending most of the budget on the processor instead of the gpu despite the purpose of the machine is pure gaming . 
  i 've read the faq and can not understand why he got scammed , could you explain please ? 
  too bad a lot of people uninstall it right at birth . 
   see `` systemctl status `` netctl@wlp3s0\\\\x2dssid.service '' '' and `` journal - xe '' for details . 
  make sure that you ** really ** do n't know how to solve your problem before wasting yours and other people 's time by making a post, 
  i approved your comment but just letting you know that you 're shadowbanned . 
  do you have a computer at home ? 
  because i 'm pretty sure it can run oblivion as it is a 9 year old game . 
  `` look at me i discovered / b / '', 
  this seems the most logical, 
  i lived in ukraine and can confirm that drinking is heavily inserted on the culture . 
  everything that happens they transform it into a reason to drink , if you say you are not drinking they ask `` are you sick ? 
  or are you taking medication ? '', 
  which are the only valid reasons to not drinking . 
  but some people are aware that drinking heavily is bad . 
  for example when a girl finds a new boyfriend one of first questions is `` does he drink ? '', 
  and if he does n't then it 's like `` hey did you know that natasha has a new boyfriend and he ** does n't drink ** '' and they be like `` omg really that is so good what a great guy he is '', 
  shit 's fucked up man, 
  yep , which means that there was no age restriction for it . 
  that reminds me of a bit ethically controverse theory that i have been thinking which is that with all the advances in medicine , a lot of people survive where they should have died and pass the weak genetics to their kids so we 're not getting a steady survival of the fittest where each generation is better than the previous . 
  just something i 've been thinking , was n't it the spartans that killed babies that were born ill or crippled ? 
  probably because when they must tolerate drunk husband coming home abusing them and generally just being a hassle it kinda opens their eyes that alcohol is bad . 
  when i was living with my grandmother between age 3 and 6 , her divorced husband who lived next door with his mother would almost always get drunk at night and come banging our door and sometimes smashing the window and when he did n't give up my grandmother had to let him in and he would just yell and watch tv at loud volume and i had to try to sleep in other room because i had kindergarten in the morning . 
  it lasted for a while until my grandmother and his mother got him out of the house and next night same story . 
  so yeah my theory is that some women see how alcohol is bad because of shit like that . 
  hah i remember when i subscribed it barely had 2k subs or something like that with crappy solarized-type css and now we 're here ... 
  i use version 4.0.7-1 :\\ ^ ), 
  why would you need to add screenfetch to . bashrc ? 
  edit : 10 seconds later figured out it would show up every time you opened a terminal . 
  yeah but it had some flaws like comments had their background white for some reason and the pink letters were hard to read . 
  \\  he fell for the gentoo meme :\\ ^ ), 
  why not ? 
  not only that but all units are related making it much easier to do physics math and such . 
  like 1 pascal is the force of pressure of 1 newton on a 1 square meter area . 
  1 newton is the force that you need to push a 1kg block 1 meter forward . 
  you need 1 calorie to heat 1 kg ( which equals to 1 l which equals to 1 cubic decimeter ) of water to 1 \u00b0 c hotter , or you could say that 1kg of water looses 1 calorie of energy when it goes does 1 \u00b0 c. 
  that is why the answer in imperial units to `` how much energy does 6 gallon of water loose when its temperature drops 20 \u00b0 f ? '', 
  is `` fuck you '' because you ca n't relate any of those units . 
  but i have n't tried it on networks such as my school or university where i 'll be going it probably has the username/password thingy i 'm not sure how wifi-menu handles it . 
  hey just wondering is there a place to ask such as / r/tipofmytongue but for dance moves because i got [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lkuljqklre ) of a guy fucking around in an adidas store for the lulz but he actually has some moves and i was wondering what style is that at minute mark 0:48 till 0:56 ( when beat drops ) . 
  i was thinkng about that and do you think that stuff from archiso like ` arch-chroot ` and ` genfstab ` will work when installing gentoo ? 
   not manufacturing your own processor and coding your own os for your architecture, 
  enjoy your botnet :\\ ^ ), 
  i know about the process , i was just wondering if we used an arch iso and downloaded the gentoo stage3 tar ball and such , would then the install scripts such as ` genfstab ` and ` arch-chroot ` work when installing gentoo from an arch iso , in theory they should be working . 
  got ta have that experience boost . 
  is n't a french kiss the only way you should kiss after you 're like 13-14 ? 
  i do n't think it 's aimed for normal desktop usage . 
  also why would amd or intel matter to security ? 
  what battery saving programs you use ? 
  definitely an issue with your computer ... 
  maybe you should install windows updates because i believe 8 to 8.1 comes with updates . 
  whoa , i knew it was bad but not this bad ... 
  i also like updates , but damn windows update is total cancer it needs like 20 minutes to figure out what it 's supposed to do , and stuff like it is n't showing progress on your updates , it simply freezes and unfreezes when it decides it wants to , it drives me insane . 
  i 'll just leave / r/linuxmasterrace here, 
  so you go back in time ?

  if you talk to babette before going to volunruud she will tell you something among the lines of `` mottiere ? 
  that 's a powerful breton family firmly established in cyrodiil , most curious . '', 
  which references fran\u00e7ois motierre and his from oblivion . 
  you probably spent more time trying to get both quests from vex and delvin to be in same city rather than simply fast travelling to other city ( :,
