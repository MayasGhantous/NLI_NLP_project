  it has drivers , it talks to the hardware , power management , memory allocation does so many things while libc is just a c library and nothing more, 
  if you really want to just destroy data then rm is not the best choice because it does filesystem housekeeping and takes a while to get to the good stuff . 
  using ** dd ** nicknamed * disk destroyer * is much more effective since it just rolls over the disk , something like dd if = / dev/zero of = / dev/sda, 
   ( is that what bsd calls them ? ), 
  i believe bsd calls them ` projects ', 
  not lines of code , i 'm talking about what is its role and how much stuff it does, 
  do n't bash me for such newfaggotery but shemales are guys who have boobs and look like girls or real females but with a curgery dick ? 
   using grub in uefi, 
   or if you want to make everyone happy : `` a gnu/linux distro, 
  more like make autists and aspies happy, 
  i noticed it too , also it stresses a bit more on the cpu because of no hardware h264 decode, 
   build your distro from the ground up, 
  i think you mistyped `` choose your de by a command line interface '', 
  so ubuntu only gets software version updates every 6 months ? 
  i know , i was just making a joke that misuse of dd has very large consequences, 
  that 's xfce . 
  what you might want to know is probably the gtk theme, 
  i 'm not sure that 's why i 'm asking, 
  oh shit yea i read it wrong the 1st time, 
  except that they were playing against the best teams in the world and na got 0-10 against worse teams, 
  just go ahead and install it . 
  since you 're using linux for over a year you should have no problems at all . 
  while for windows the `` official '' available drivers are probably for 32 bit windows vista . 
  also talk about plug and play , what about extended functionality ? 
  i use a thinkpad and as you know those things have the trackpoint ( clitmouse ) and 3 buttons , the middle one on windows by default only serves to scroll while in linux with just an input package from official repositories the middle button also works as middle click . 
   `` so what 's that tattoo ? 
  hmm in what language is that ? 
   what do you mean it 's a linux command ?!, 
  you really had a linux command tattooed ? 
  actually darwin is an open source os by apple with xnu.kernel ( x 's not unix ) which is based upon mach and bsd . 
  on top of that you have apple 's proprietary stuff like quartz , aqua , coreaudio , and various hardware drivers in kernel such as wifi and that is what makes os x, 
  as an european i thank ameribros for upvoting my shit after i go to sleep . 
  `` whoa !!, 
  how old is that laptop ?! '', 
  i usually reply with `` the laptop itself is fairly recent , it 's just that the design is pretty much the same as it was more than a decade ago '', 
  nice . 
  i 'm trying to find a non-tablet x60 because of dat 4:3 , dat ibm logo and dat easy libreboot flash but it 's hard and when they appear people want a lot of money for a 9 year old machine, 
  i 'm pretty sure swap is needed for hibernation, 
  software freedom is a nice concept but sadly it does not work in the real world most of the time . 
  unlike stallman , we can not sustain ourselves by giving the same speech at various places . 
  replace ` quiet ' with ` verbose ' to get a lot of messages during boot so you look like a l33t h4x0r, 
  if only they made his q crit ... 
  yep i remember hearing about this crazy wildturtle guy that regi met in solo q absolute monster dominator holding top ranking in the ladder with various accounts kinda like bigfatlp . 
  i stopped with lol after end of season 3 and recently came back ( only to esports ) and seeing wildturtle replaced is a big shock . 
  i usually listen to third eye when going back home wasted at the end of the night . 
  it really feels like something supernatural, 
  * starts headbanging *, 
  every time . 
  my flair, 
  ] ( https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/tlp ) do not forget to enable services and all that so that it works properly, 
  i get pretty much the same battery ( if not better ) than in windows . 
   i hate compiling from source, 
  arch is a binary distro so you wo n't need to do any compiling by default . 
  youtube-dl and mpv, 
  ugh , it would be so nice if we got a laptop that is fully supported by default kernel and not one with a bunch of patches . 
   what is grep -- color = auto, 
  i mean the default kernel without any patches . 
  all the fn keys and stuff working out of the box on any distro without patches, 
  i own an x220 and i had to configure volume and mute micro/speakers . 
  oh wow i had no idea . 
  i though all the `` linux laptops '' were with ubuntu and a lot of custom kernel patches and configs specifically made for the laptop , but i guess i was wrong . 
  it 's not about the answer it 's about interpretation and 3x5 is different than 5x3 . 
   million times harder, 
  can we stop with this retarded meme ? 
  arch is just a ` choose your own de by a cli ' . 
  all you have to do is follow instructions ... 
  just use dd if you really want to steamroll over the disk and destroy it effectively . 
  rm is not that efficient because it does filesystem housekeeping and takes a while to get to the good parts, 
  that ryze ... 
  clg.eu vs team we is like that fnc vs ahq game this season, 
  please tell me this is a joke, 
  opiate : opiate, 
  undertow : bottom, 
  \u00c6nima : third eye, 
  lateralus : the grudge, 
  10,000 days : rosetta stoned, 
  i 'm currently enjoying the shit out of rosetta stoned and third eye . 
  when i 'm going home wasted i just put third eye and it feels like a fucking ritual to open your sixth sense, 
  so they actually do have some new stuff, 
  you were being an annoying little bitch to be honest ... 
  dude this is / r/pcmasterrace where everybody is pretty much underage and does not know how much worse fermi was . 
  literally users from twitch.tv ( a live streaming website ) install archlinux, 
  what do you do exactly ? 
  that fucking gorgeous bar . 
  can somebody explain me how it is possible to add click functions and images to lemonbar ? 
  because it 's concept is very simple yet people make very complex things with it, 
  how 's hardware support , battery and all that stuff on freebsd when compared to linux ? 
  i 've been thinking on trying freebsd for myself ... 
  oh wow , i completely missed it the last time i read the syntax . 
  and for the icons that means there is a custom font containing a lot of images ?

  adobe makes good fonts . 
  if you 're on arch then, 
  # pacman - s adobe-source-code-pro-fonts, 
   which one is new which one already exists,
