and gluttonous, 
  do n't you fucking tell us about safes , op . 
  * we 've been there . 
   kazakhstan prostitutes cleanest in the region, 
   expect of course all of turkmenistan 's, 
   come grasp the mighty penis of our leader, 
   from junction with the testes to the tip of its faaaaace !, 
  fixed , was on mobile . 
  and calm down , guy . 
  sound like an uzbeki . 
  still more than blackberry users . 
  ukrainian here . 
  do n't support this particular trend . 
  makes us all look bad . 
  passion for democracy and ** fighting ** corruption is good . 
  but this ins ' t the way to handle it . 
  i agree with out minister of internal affairs , avakov . 
  it is tarnishing the legacy of the revolution , and not the right way of handling corrupt scumbags . 
  source , you may ask ? 
  wiki, 
   in 2007 , shufrych ran by a party list from the party of regions , being listed the 5th for the early elections . 
  the party won the elections earning 34.4 % nationwide with 3 % parliamentary threshold . 
   on november 23 , 2012 , president yanukovych dismissed shufrych from the position of deputy secretary of the national security and defense council of ukraine because he was re-elected into parliament in the october 2012 ukrainian parliamentary election . 
  [ 1 ] he was number 27 on the party of regions election list . 
   shufrych was present at negotiations with the armed separatist in the donetsk and luhansk provinces on 21 june 2014 to discuss president petro poroshenko peace plan although it was unclear who he represented there ( he claimed the government had appealed to him to contribute to the mediation of viktor medvedchuk ) . 
  unfortunately , due to obvious low demand of english sources covering ukrainian corruption ( which ukraine was only on english speaking media following a bloody revolution and war with russia ) , i can tell you in short what above means , tl ; dr :, 
  * he neglected our army , and stole millions intended on military spending , which led to its total lack of any fighting capability leading up to the conflict, 
  * he maintains close ties with moscow , openly works with separatists ( which are officially declared a terrorist organization in ukraine by the supreme court ), 
  * he is notorious for fighting . 
  like assaulting the then minister of internal affairs ( lutsenko ) . 
  and even roughing up his wife . 
  by roughing up i mean breaking her jaw . 
  and using his `` mp immunity '' to escape legal trouble . 
  [ misc parts of his `` career '' : source in russian ] ( http://genshtab.info/%d0%a8%d1%83%d1%84%d1%80%d0%b8%d1%87,_%d0%9d%d0%b5%d1%81%d1%82%d0%be%d1%80_%d0%98%d0%b2%d0%b0%d0%bd%d0%be%d0%b2%d0%b8%d1%87#.d0.9d.d0.b5.d0.b7.d0.b0.d0.ba.d0.be.d0.bd.d0.bd.d0.b0.d1.8f_.d0.bf.d1.80.d0.b8.d0.b2.d0.b0.d1.82.d0.b8.d0.b7.d0.b0.d1.86.d0.b8.d1.8f_.d0.be.d0.b1.d1.8a.d0.b5.d0.ba.d1.82.d0.be.d0.b2_.d0.bd.d0.b5.d0.b4.d0.b2.d0.b8.d0.b6.d0.b8.d0.bc.d0.be.d1.81.d1.82.d0.b8 ), 
  * illegal capture and operating of a gas-tower, 
  * falsifying documents of one of his many oil-companies ; fraud costing government 14 million uah ( at the time , about 2-3 usd million ), 
  * illegal privatization of various land properties in western regions ( summer homes ), 
  * illegal acquisition of 3.5 hectars of elite property under kiev, 
  * buying ( bribing ) voters, 
  * nepotism and giving gov. 
  position to those close to him, 
  * separately , owning ( all of the ) following businesses and private firms :, 
  ** moral of the story ** : he used his parliamentary immunity ( as an mp ) to avoid a single court case . 
  all of it . 
  gone . 
  not a slap on the wrist . 
  from breaking his wifes jaw , to stealing millions . 
  i could go on . 
  this is one guy . 
  realistically cost ukrainians upwards of 10s of millions of dollars . 
  our average salary is no more than 300 $ a month, 
  this is corruption to the point of dark political satire to most americans and westerners . 
  you can imagine our exhaustion . 
  so yeah . 
  there 's that . 
  edit : forgot a word in a very awkward place . 
   at least before they ousted yanukovich , ukraine had some semblance of democracy . 
  hahahaha . 
  wow . 
  good one . 
  ( to prevent showing le evil and biased western media ), 
  ( ok , just one ), 
  you must be a real expert . 
  rt has some wonderful stuff . 
  i do n't touch euphoric experts on my country who do n't know shit and regurgitate bullshit right off the kremlin narrative with a 10 foot pole . 
   better stop wasting time on reddit and get to practicing that goosestep . 
  it will come handy when kids next door make you prove you 're a real ukrainian and not some `` moskal '' . 
  some good ol' russian `` le ukrainian nazi '' memes too . 
  we have it all folks . 
  edit :, 
   ukraine even got to keep crimea which they stole from russia in 90 's . 
  oh my ... missed this gem . 
  i honestly thank you for a good laugh . 
  needed it . 
  rough week . 
  cheers m8,

   british toilets . 
  you 're thinking pollocks . 
  you sure have a lot of shit to talk about a place you 've never been and know nothing about . 
  and wow , the amount of hatred ... 
  i can smell the cheetos , lonliness and sexual frustration from here !, 
  must be lonely in mommy 's basement . 
  i guess getting rejected and lack of employment leaves you plenty of time to fap and curse the world for its cruelty for being so unfair to your glorious beer belly and neckbeard . 
  i 'm honored you picked ukraine to channel your rage . 
  really . 
  must miserable that you have to hate an entire nation of people thousands of miles away to feel better about yourself . 
  its ok , buddy . 
  youre not the only virgin in his 30 's out there . 
  plenty of degenerate losers like yourself exist . 
  shave your glorious neckbeard , invest in some normal people clothes and deodarant , stop reading / r/theredpill , and maybe one local lady can overlook your pathetic , bigoted personality , and overall worthlessness . 
  lol k, 
  still does n't make you any less of a douchebag . 
  and pathetic . 
  and a bigoted sack of shit . 
  til `` non-westerner '' is a race . 
  do n't think the crab planned this thing out , though . 
  * confront alligator, 
  * clench his jaw shut with mighty pincers, 
  * laugh at puny , helpless alligator , taunt him , post pictures of confrontation to instagram , impress the lady crabs ( mating season is right around the corner ),
