  government does n't give a shit . 
  civil society ( ngo 's , community organizations , religious charity groups ) are practically non-existent under soviet/russian culture . 
  strong-family bonds are usually the only thing to rely on ; but they 're most likely from an alcoholic/junkie family ( parents ) to begin with . 
  communicable diseases are absurdly common among the bottom of society ( junkies , alchies , bums , prostitutes ) ; tuberculosis , syphilis , gonorrhea , hiv/aids , hepatitis a/b/c are a given . 
  cocktail of diseases , malnutrition , drugs and alcohol pretty much pick you off by your mid-30 's at the latest . 
  not to mention what cops call '' \u0431\u044b\u0442\u043e\u0432\u0443\u0445\u0430 '' ( household crime ) . 
  quarrels among those in severe , long-lasting , chronic alcoholicism , who are going through [ alcohol-related psychosis ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alcoholic_hallucinosis ) ; are prone to extreme paranoia and violence against those they cohabitate with : parents , wife , freind etc. 
  usually do n't remember afterwards , or are even `` there '' for it . 
  gruesome violence ( ax , knife , hammer etc ) . 
  such is life in russia ( outside of moscow , st. petersburg ) for the socially vulnerable . 
  ukrainian . 
  from the east . 
  all what i have mentioned i 've seen , and are a part of ukrainian reality as well . 
  but at a much smaller and less dramatic scale . 
  we share a soviet history , but there are very crucial differences in culture , climate ( this morbid shit usually happens in colder , more remote places ) , mentality etc. 
  i have ( had , now with the conflict ) many friends/acquaintances from russia tell me the differences . 
  anywhere you go in the ex-ussr , you 'll find some level of this morbid , post-soviet decay . 
  but usually , it gets really dark and scary towards rural russia , around the ural mountains ( near the kazakh border ; capital of heroin and krokodil use , for example ) . 
  to the tune of entire villages and towns becoming ghost towns . 
  the youth leaves for urban areas , the ones that stay degress into this shit . 
  on the bright side ; the very peak of this was the 90 's and into the 00 's . 
  there is an entire `` lost generation '' of people that fell to this shit . 
  but unfortunately , some of it happens to this day . 
  depends on the region and socioeconomic conditions in terms of severity . 
  edit : [ the `` towns '' i mention , an example ] ( http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/inpictures/2014/05/pictures-russia-decaying-village-20145212242508695.html ),

  but . .

  kazakhstan and parts of central asia do n't seem to be so lucky though .

  how do you go from soft-spoken gena in russian to some nordic viking strongman voice like that ?

  fuck that noise . 
  he hit us and into drinkings every night . 
  really ? 
  hmm . . 
  there 's baltika ( most common russian beer ) on the other side . 
  i 'd say ambiguous former-ussr would be the fairest guess at the location . 
  step 1 in being `` nice guy '' and `` gentlesir '' : refer to women as `` females '' . 
  every greentext story on 4chan, 
  there are still millions and millions of honest , hard-working , kind and loving people out there in the world . 
  the unsung , everyday heroes that make the world a better place . 
  the doctors saving their patients lives , firemen rescuing people from certain peril , volunteers giving back to society . 
  and you can and will run into them over the course of your life . 
  maybe one of them will be your so in the future . 
  maybe it 'll be a lifelong friendship . 
  maybe just a chance encounter . 
  but they 're there . 
  and you can be this `` everyday hero '' as well . 
  it 's easy to overlook them and see the more vocal and easy to see shitty individuals that command more attention . 
  but it really pays to remember that there is still good in the world . 
   if i lost to him i probably would have snapped and knocked him out . . 
  so alpha, 
  if you live in a country neighboring russia , you have copious reasons to hate them . 
  are n't exactly the nicest neighbors .
