  cheers man , much appreciated . 
  as a someone who did a lot of stupid shit as a teen . 
  yes . 
  yes they do . 
  fill it up with enough water to resemble a water balloon , and they pop easily . 
  if you drop it off * multiple stories * , as the gif depicts . 
  because condoms were designed for rough sex at the most . 
  not being filled with a liter or 2 of water and dropped off the 5th floor . 
   the whole point of condoms is that they do n't break . 
  tell that to the millions of `` lucky couples '' who are now raising their unplanned bundles of joy because of that assumption . 
  he is a * lot * more famous and recognizable to the average joe than he was 5 years ago . 
  i assume the amount of people requesting pictures with him increased dramatically as well . 
  it came in [ flying with the cranes ] ( http://www.tyden.cz/obrazek/201111/4ec664b7ab624/putin-sunshine-4ec66c657463c.jpg ), 
  they do hold a pretty crazy amount of water without bursting . 
  some can get massive ; i 'd say a few liters easy ( ~ 1 gallon ) . 
  as for the height ; our usual spot was on a buddy 's balcony , who lived on the fifth floor . 
  but it worked on floors 3 + . 
  naturally , the more you fill them , the easier they burst . 
  some , when barely filled at all , survived pretty high falls . 
  but the splats were * massive * . 
  it started with water-balloon fights in the summer , and condoms were the heavy artillery . 
  how we did n't injure ourselves or others is beyond me . 
  tl ; dr : 4 + floor , ~ 1/2 gallon + . 
  but do n't try this at home . 
  we were lucky we did n't hurt ourselves or others . 
  no problem ... just do n't do it ... plox,

  as someone who has quit and started smoking again over the last 7 + years , the first cigarette after a long hiatus can be pretty terrible . 
  similar to the first one ever . 
  the weird , way-too-strong taste of tobacco and instant dizziness . 
  admittedly the one immediately after is enjoyable again . 
  since having a cigarette after quitting usually has alcohol involved in the situation . 
  at least for me . 
  edit : repeated word, 
  ... and then you woke up ? 
  roast leg of lamb with homemade tzatziki , and incredibly flavorful greek salad . 
  at a little hole-in-the-wall greek place , few blocks from the gare du midi railway station in brussels . 
  incredibly cheap , but byfar the best lamb ( and greek food ) i 've ever tasted . 
  aside from being in a sketchy neighborhood , and a matching sketchy interior ... * incredible * flavor . 
  as someone dealing with a recent breakup with a so from a * somewhat * long-term relationship ( 1 year ) ; definitely wrong thread to read through :(, 
  i do n't know the imperial system of measurement , and this was more than 8 years ago , so i 'm visually trying to assess the volume from memory . 
  2-3 liters sound more accurate ? 
  so a guy , minding his own business , listening to his music and enjoying himself in an otherwise dull environment , * laughs * ...
