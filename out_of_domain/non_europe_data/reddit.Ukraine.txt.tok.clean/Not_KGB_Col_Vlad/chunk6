  and asshole driver was hauling ass * off * of the road . 
  as in on the mud off the road . 
  probably to overtake someone . 
  only for slavic , orthodox , russian ants ; yes, 
  que ? 
  ( google translate ? ), 
  ahh . 
  close enough . 
  google translate can not into glorious rusky-banter, 
  hey . 
  hey guise . 
  we have sex . 
   and americans are the most anti-chinese people you 'll ever meet . 
  you should visit southeast ( and most of ) asia . 
  mongolia , japan and vietnam would be a good place to start .

  30-something year old with a * glorious * trench coat . 
  i 'm going to assume that you 're above the acceptable limit of 3 , and wish you all the best in your journey . 
   he is right with 99 % of the stuff he says . 
  the eu is trash . 
  found the ukip member, 
  we had a whole brigade . 
  then the damn russkies stole them with crimea . 
  ^ ^ we ^ ^ miss ^ ^ you , ^ ^ flipperenko, 
  actually , hardline catholic-based conservatism . 
  quite the polar opposite, 
   black thug culture, 
  american `` black thug culture '' ? 
  british ? 
  the `` black '' race is made up of thousands of languages and `` cultures '' , spans all across africa and beyond . 
  summing up all of it under one thing is ignorant , to put it lightly . 
  same can be said for `` white '' , asian , and whatever else you can consider a race based on skin color . 
  compare a russian to a brit to an albanian , or japanese to mongolian to thai etc. 
  these `` color '' generalizations are so broad and loose , its just exceptionally stupid to use it as a criteria of judging a group , and especially an * individual * . 
   he 's not wrong about anything he says, 
  wo n't go into the small details , but he 's extremely arrogant about his views , which are by no means always right . 
  he has some very ignorant and unfounded opinions , and acts like a pretentious douche to anyone who disagrees . 
  [ quick example : maher on vaccines ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5dlf1qt78 ), 
  well in this case , i 'd agree . 
  the wording was a little offputting , though . 
  the unofficial slogan of / r/cringepics, 
  holy . 
  shit . 
  this is so horrible , it 's actually hilarious/entertaining . 
  sideways ponytail thug-life . 
  does he have any merch ? 
  i 'd rock a dj the best shirt . 
  / r/wtf : teaching you lessons that you sometimes wish you could forget, 
  my guess : he 's either turkish or albanian . 
  both are predominantly muslim , but largely secular . 
  i 'd say he 's albanian . 
  could be wrong . 
  you go to harvard ? 
  [ the town in the video , if anyone is convinced to visit ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chernyshevsk ), 
  [ australia , please ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9yndirqwt4 ), 
   the russian website is saving ukraine from evil kiev nazi fascist junta, 
  ftfy, 
  i 'd say alcoholism . 
  and the symptomatic apathy , resulting in mountains of trash and filth in your living area . 
  all of it is alcohol containers and food wrappers/waste . 
  which means drinking/eating alone in your room . 
  if it 's good enough for a cat , it should work just fine for redditers . 
  in which case , it was n't meant to be . 
  ca n't force anyone to be attracted to someone . 
  the proper solution would be to express how you feel ( not keep it bottled up inside and frustrated why nobody else can connect the dots for you ) . 
  if yes , congrats . 
  if not , get over it , and move right on . 
  it was n't meant to be , you saved yourself the time . 
  if you 're not a sleazy douche who was friends with said girl with the sole attention of fucking/dating ; be cool about it and treat her like you would any of your male friends , and not be weird about it . 
  problem solved . 
  no need to inhabit some `` zone '' of bullshit agony because said nice guy does n't have the balls to ask out a `` friend '' who he 's friends with only to sleep/date . 
  / r/niceguys is a place to do it . 
  as in you 're not compatible and have no chemistry . 
  i know . 
  apparently an alpha-male emotionally manipulating a dish that wo n't leave his house . 
  i 'd call a psychiatrist . 
  this, 
  ~ ~ kgb ~ ~ putin already knows . 
  to be fair , we 're on cringepics . 
  i think assumptions and judging others are pretty much to be expected . 
  value judgments is basically what the sub is . 
   all ~ ~ unattractive ~ ~ males in their youth, 
  ftfy, 
  at this point , the term itself has become pathetically overused and morphed into its own thing . 
  the `` nice guy '' culture birthed this idiocy . 
  it 's not a `` zone '' . 
  its a girl not being attracted to you . 
  * all * guys go through it . 
  it 's not the guys fault the girl does n't like him . 
  ** it 's not a girl 's fault she does n't like him ** . 
  there is no zone , no victims , nothing . 
  turning it into a zone is what perpetrates the `` victim nice guy '' bullshit . 
  and is a viscous cycle . 
  that all guys go through , and hopefully grow out of as soon as possible . 
  this `` friendzone '' as a term for a girl/guy not liking you is pathetic and leads these same guys ( and gals ) to repeat the same mistakes and self-pity . 
  lack of chemistry is a real situation . 
  friendzone is an excuse to mope and blame it on others . 
   you are being like a delusional nice guy by not acknowledging attraction is mostly at `` first sight '' . 
  ... that 's a little pretentious .
