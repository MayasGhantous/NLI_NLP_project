i think i destroyed my enamel from grinding my teeth too hard while reading your comment . 
   my asshole brother told me when i was a little lemon , juice would fix them . 
  i fixed your grammar . 
  what kind of juice ? 
  we must be deeply connected at some level . 
  i would rise from the ashes and ban the mod of / r/pyongyang, 
  never go full van gogh . 
  you like that , retard ?

  we did it reddit !, 
  ever been attacked by one ? 
  they 're intimidating as fuck . 
  0/10 would fuck with a huge fucking swan . 
  if i were you i would have totally put that on my resume . 
  it 's that kind of stuff that gets you great jobs in journalism , not some piece of paper you payed $ 100k for . 
  / r / ( n ) creepy ( n +2 ) me, 
  i once got pulled over by the border police who decided to search my car . 
  now , one thing that i forgot : i had an exorbitant amount of lsd in it . 
  by directing their attention elsewhere , i decided to eat all of the evidence and went into another universe shortly after successfully crossing the border . 
  the story is really long , i 'll post it if anyone is interested . 
  thanks !, 
  i appreciate it . 
  i see myself as a very paranoid person in regards to drugs . 
  in spite of my apathetical tendencies towards religion and spirituality , i always had a certain inclination towards the mystical and the unknown . 
  when i was in middle school , which , in my country is when everybody starts to experiments with drugs ( there are even weirder stories from that time ) , i went on erowid.org to read drug reports . 
  naturally , the most entertaining ones were about hallucinogens . 
  back to my paranoia . 
  i saw the trip as a safety barrier between me and the authority . 
  i finished law school a year ago , you can imagine what kind of effect having `` possession of drugs , 1 year in prison '' would make on my resume when applying to a law firm . 
  to be honest , thanks to reddit , this is the only thing i know about australia . 
  i 'm an atheist in a very christian family . 
  i 'm afraid that my religious standing will interfere and that my parents could even disown me .

  i would fuckin ' harvest them bitches with my baby air bison . 
  what 's the title of the song ? 
   not with that * altitude * you ca n't, 
  * this * . 
  a pretty damn cool super villain that is , however .

  oh well hot diggity dog , i guess they 're not so evil after all !, 
  thanks to that logic , the war on drugs puts teenagers experimenting with weed into jail . 
  i would like to start by saying that i 'm not very knowledgeable as far as this subject is concerned . 
  how is this sentence justifiable ? 
  furthermore , why is support for such extreme punishments so popular here in the comments ? 
  * i genuinely believe game rangers should be legally allowed to shoot poachers on site . 
  * preferably with his poached horn up his ass . 
  * better to stab him repeatedly with a rhino 's horns laced with chilli pepper and other good stuff . 
  * poachers might stop if they knew they would be relentlessly slaughtered too if caught, 
  * they should have burned him at the stake and placed his charred head on a pike where he was caught to set an example for future poachers . 
  ** what the fuck is wrong with you people ? 
  edit : right , sure , down vote me .

  you should call your debut album `` main page '' . 
  there 's not even a disambiguation page for `` main page '' . 
  i.e. , your band would be fucked . 
  surely , some account i have made on the internet is likely to be effectively immortal . 
  if google can reproduce the growth it experienced in the last 10 years , my gmail account will most likely outlive me . 
  i do n't see where you 're trying to get at with quantum computing . 
  quantum computing has nothing to do with wether or not the internet will cease to exist or not . 
  if anything , qc will enhance the online experience . 
  i 'm afraid that that example does n't hold up pretty well . 
  qc ca n't just `` happen '' , it will be introduced * gradually * . 
  that would mean the advent of a bit to qubit converter . 
  i feel like you 're trying to say that qc will hit the market all of a sudden and that all websites as well as everything else on the internet would be gone , so you would have to make new accounts for email , etc. 
  this transition will be very smooth , for the underlying principles of the conservation of information are not as fundamentally different between quantum computing and the good old boolean logic , i.e. 
  the `` 0s and 1s '' you talked about as most people believe . 
   you 're `` account '' is just code , 0 's and 1 's . 
  take those away , and you have no account . 
  nobody is taking anything away . 
  really , the only difference between bits and qubits is that a qubit can be a 0 and a 1 at the same time which allows for an exponential increase in computational power . 
  however , data storage techniques will * in principle * behave in the exact same way they currently do . 
  you saying that plus the fact that you believe that qc `` replaces 1s and 0s '' make me feel like you have a very limited understanding on this topic . 
  of course , qc will dominate the world market in 50 years but an abrupt transition instead of a smooth one ( as you have previously suggested with your torn down apartment comparison ) is impossible to take place due to the inherent similarities between regular logic and quantum logic .

  i looked a while at 17 ... then i got it : it 's cause he 's a * tool * ^ ha ^ ha ^ ha ^ my ^ mom ^ says ^ i 'm ^ funny, 
  ** for it is you who will never die **, 
  jacob impatiently glared at the tattoo on his wrist . 
  it consisted of two rows of text written in size 12 times new roman , almost as if his forearm got caught in a printer a long time ago . 
  it looked fresh and gleamy , too . 
  * for it is you * and * who will never die . 
  * was what was written just below his left hand . 
  his glare intensified as the seconds were ticking away on his old watch , that in spite of its rusty features seemed to have been rather lavish at some point in time . 
  time he had , but patience -- not anymore . 
  for the first time he noticed that that grammatical structure of his tattoo was off , which added to his anger .
