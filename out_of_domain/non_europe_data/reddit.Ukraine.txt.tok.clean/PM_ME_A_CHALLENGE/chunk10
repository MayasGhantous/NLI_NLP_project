  i was 10 years old when the series started and it had me hooked from the very beginning . 
  it 's a feel-good and captivating show that even manages to teach valuable morals and virtues to children . 
  overall , i would rate tlok to be a little too dark ( [ amon 's murder suicide ] ( / spoiler ) in book 1 , [ professors zei 's corpse ] ( / spoiler ) in book 2 , [ p'li 's head exploding and ghazan 's suicide ] ( / spoiler ) in book 3 ) for an 8 year old . 
  i would add that the themes addressed in tlok are a little too complicated and too politically colored to rival the relative simplicity of atla . 
  nevertheless , that simplicity still manages to captivate me and many others of my age bracket and never fails to entertain . 
  most people on this sub are between 16 and 19 years of age and are still avid fans of atla , so i would n't worry about her rating it as a `` children 's show '' . 
  definitely atla . 
  sorry , my bad !, 
  i 'll still leave it here in case the moderators decide to remove your post due to the improper tagging . 
  i 'm not sure where , but i think i saw an interview where bryke confirmed the deaths of ghazan , migh-hua as well as amon . 
  either way , i do n't believe that they would stretch the arc of the story so far as to snap the whole plot of book 1 . 
  no problem , and happy cakeday !, 
  someone posted a download link to the scans of the physical copy , which has been published yesterday . 
  i 'm not sure how the mods will like me posting the link , but a quick google search does the thing !, 
  perfect !, 
  i love it . 
  * amon * a boat ^ kekekeke ^ i ^ know ^ this ^ joke ^ has ^ been ^ done ^ to ^ death, 
  `` the rift '' is the third three part comic book after the promise and the search . 
  the third part came out yesterday . 
  i highly recommend you read them , they 're very entertaining even if you 're not too much of a comic book type !, 
  sandalwood and the varrick -- prayer in t, 
  no problem !, 
  start with * the promise * , continue with * the search * and finish with * the rift * . 
  * the search * is a fan favorite , so much as that nickelodeon wanted to make a movie out of it , but then decided to create a spin-off of atla with the budget which then became the legend of korra . 
  happy reading !, 
  i only found out about it when i joined this community . 
  nickelodeon did n't do a terribly good job at promoting them , especially outside of the us , which is too bad because they 're really good !, 
  that is fantastic !, 
  please encourage your cousin to draw comics or even try out animation , i really like her work !, 
  edit : pronoun, 
  these are all part of the lost adventures , right ? 
  or are there some in your list which are not included in there ? 
  `` maybe i 'm not an inner circle kinda guy '', 
  i really liked the scene where he said those words . 
  it shows that he still wants to believe that he brought `` freedom '' and prosperity to the provinces and is in denial about the truth he just witnessed . 
  kind of like a child plugging his ears and yelling `` la la la , i ca n't hear you ! '' . 
  it 'll be interesting to see how all of this is going to affect his character development . 
  i really like how the portrayed depression . 
  `` i 'm just so tired '', 
  `` korra , you have n't been eating anything '', 
  although it obviously tied in with her ptsd ( which i know very little about ) , i believe they portrayed depression pretty well . 
  i also believe that it 's important to pay lip service to mental illnesses which are often overlooked or relegated by the majority of the world population , so i 'm happy that they did it the way they did . 
  thanks , good to hear that someone shares my view !, 
  i noticed it too ... maybe skrillex beifong worked on those few frames to show us viewers his * true * inside . 
  i really like how meelo 's character has been doing lately with his new found talent , too bad the writers are overdoing his constant talking . 
  it would be interesting to see her attempt to zaheer the air out of kuvira 's lungs . 
  *** zaheer *** , intransitive verb \\ z\u00e4-hir \\, 
  1 : to dethrone or to otherwise remove a political figure from authority . 
  2 : to airbend in an unusually lethal or destructive manner . 
  i 'd love to see that !, 
  she is definitely a fantastic fighter , the only reason i enjoyed watching it was because of her since korra was unusually slow . 
  just a friendly reminder that to tag a spoiler , you just write '' [ b4e6 ] '' in front of your title . 
  writing '' \\ [ azula killed dumbledore ] ( / spoiler ) '' only works in comments , not in titles . 
  good eyes !, 
  i did n't notice it since i found bataar jr 's googly to be too much of an entertaining goof . 
  am i missing something ? 
  good eye !, 
  i would n't be surprised if meelo 's portrait has been drawn by the same guy who drew the other painting . 
  well that would be a very elaborate running gag , considering that we * literally * ca n't handle all this meelo . 
  she seems to have completely lost that ability after book 2 . 
  where do you watch it ? 
  interesting post . 
  mostly , i wonder how zhu li felt after bataar jr. telling kuvira that varrick and bolin had perished . 
  if she felt confusion , that would be essentially the same way zuko felt in atla . 
  moreso if she decides to switch sides again later down the road . 
  * zhu li is our zuko . 
  good point . 
  perhaps she just lacks the mastery of metalbending , but then again i asked myself a similar question when i saw [ her hanging in the air , suspended by kuvira 's armor . 
  great point !, 
  perhaps he 'll switch sides later down the road , but somehow i doubt it . 
  perhaps a catalytic event like kuvira betraying him like amon betrayed his lieutenant will make him reconsider his choices and free his mother and brothers . 
  essentially , we 'd have yet another zuko on our hands . 
  but why use so many blades for decapitation ? 
  perhaps kuvira has noticed some peach fuzz growing on korra 's lip and was just going to shave it off . 
  that would explain why she was going to use so many blades -- to soothe her skin of course !, 
  how thoughtful of our great uniter . 
  she never really showed a lot of emotion in the series . 
  i wonder what went through her head at that point ? 
  i think you 're on to something . 
  with her cold and calculating persona , there truly does seem something off about her picking a fight with the avatar . 
  i just hope she prevents republic city from being blown up by a vine nuke . 
  it 'll be interesting to see how asami and especially her father will tie into the rest of the story . 
  `` you 're not scary -- you just look that way ! '', 
  i bet you five bucks and a chewing gum that some of the strategy geeks in the pentagon who are sitting at their desks and plotting out all possible war scenarios for ten hours a day have at least * once * made a plan concerning the attack of the fire nation in their free time for shits and giggles . 
  haha , it 's strange to compare one airbender versus the armies of all the other nations . 
  but it shows that even though people consider air to be the weakest element , it only took * one * airbender to wreck havoc . 
  your desertion will be met with the greatest punishment . 
  perhaps some time in the / r/eeducationcamp will help you become a productive member of society . 
  you mean that prison guarded by the white lotus sentries ? 
  hm , good question . 
  so far , the community believes that zaheer is the one behind the doors , but i recall an interview where bryke said that he would n't be playing to much of a role in book 4 . 
  ... bataar jr. , later down the road when kuvira betrays him and threatens to destroy the united republic with her vine nuke ? 
  i love the way varrick 's character has been developing . 
  we need more of him !, 
  also , did n't his voice actor mention that there will be an episode dedicated to his childhood ? 
  that 's gon na be amazing . 
  this is absolutely fantastic . 
  he looks like an overbearing mother watching tlok with their child and reacting to the scenes . 
  ( amon 's murder suicide ) `` oh my , how is this allowed on tv nowadays ?! '', 
  ( bolin witnessing the inevitable ) `` oh my , i do n't think all of this romantic content is suitable for my baby daughter ! '',
