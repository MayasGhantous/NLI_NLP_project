  i messaged the mods about adding [ a new googly-eyed bataar jr. flair that i created ] ( http://imgur.com/3ndwsdk ) . 
  message them too if you 'd like to see that happening to minimize the chance of them overseeing it in the flood of new content !, 
  edit : hmm , there seems to be a problem with the transparency . 
  probably has to do with my gimp not wanting to export to png anmore and me having to upload the xcf . 
  can anyone with gimp or photoshop help me out here ? 
  ^ shh , ^ do n't ^ say ^ that ^ out ^ loud ^ or ^ bataar ^ might ^ actually ^ find ^ out ^ about ^ sex !, 
  much appreciated !, 
  oh , what made you think she was going to have a baby ? 
  the positive pregnancy test just means that her mole has developed sentience and is ready to leave her body in about 9 months . 
  if adult swim ever adopts tlok , * you * need to become a writer . 
  hmm , good question . 
  on one hand , there is zuko 's scar which has been induced by firebending . 
  on another hand , i recall that iroh tricked that one earth kingdom soldier after he got captured by burning his hand on the handcuffs he wore without burning himself . 
  i believe it was the episode where aang had to save that one city from the giant evil panda spirit . 
  a very confusing world indeed . 
  i hope it 'll go out with a bang !, 
  to be honest , i feel like the writers are overdoing the comic aspect of his character . 
  i mean , giving him a talent nobody expected from him was hilarious , but i believe that his constant shouting and saying random things is just abrasive to the mature feel of the storyline we have all been enjoying so far . 
  what you say makes complete sense but i do n't think that the writers thought as far as you did . 
  i think they just wanted there to be a new source of comic relief that is appealing to the lower end of the age bracket . 
  i did but i hoped it would slip . 
  i painted a pop art version of billy mays for art class in middle school , and i live in europe . 
  he seems to have transcended barriers and borders . 
  i 'll search for it , hopefully i 'll find it !, 
  edit : it took a surprisingly little amount of time to find it !, 
  [ here you go . 
  i 'm surprised nobody has mentioned ** the storm ** ( atla book 1 ) . 
  that was the one episode that pulled me in and showed me that the show was more than just nonsensical action . 
  it is the episode with the most character exposition and development in either of the series in my opinion . 
  i hate being `` that guy '' but i really doubt that nickelodeon would allow an incestuous relationship to happen , since tenzin dated lin , which would make sokka tenzin 's uncle and lin 's father . 
  of course , it would n't be incest ( albeit still a little weird ) if suyin were sokka 's daughter , but then again i doubt nickelodeon would jump into those kind of waters . 
  i ship wan , the boulder , xin fu from earth rumble vi , korra , zuko 's daughter izumi , avatar roku , aang , suyin 's son wing , the duke and princess yue , or as i like to call it ... 
  i 'm afraid the [ burden of proof ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/philosophic_burden_of_proof ) lies upon the one making the claim . 
  downvote me all you want , it 's good to see that nickelodeon is at least putting in * some * effort to advertise tlok . 
  i ca n't be the only one who had that split second of their teeth grinding anxiously when he threw that weight after bench pressing . 
  haha thanks , all hail oxi clean !, 
  but what if the private parts are on the internet , i.e. 
  when there are some of them that are public ? 
  then how do i prevent my cucumbers from spoiling ? 
  i installed the extension barely a few hours ago . 
  yet i got so confused that i tried to make some kind of artistic interpretation of why the title was `` above my butts '' . 
  the sexual tenzin is real, 
  i would like to take this opportunity and proclaim that i love cloud to butt for chrome . 
  ^ found the equalist !, 
  wow . 
  that is fantastic !, 
  :d keep it up !,

  thanks !, 
  shit , mako lost some gainz . 
  could you please explain what ` snowball ' and ` avalanche ' mean ? 
  thank you very much !, 
  interesting move on your part . 
  it 's comments like these that make it less attractive for people who have something interesting to add to the discussion to actually post their points of view . 
  and i know that his reply could be considered meme-ish but consider this : i remember a post from two weeks ago that lamented about the fact that the community is becoming increasingly hostile towards comments that feature `` unpopular '' opinions and that the moderators were not doing too good of a job of preventing posters from ridicule by removing questionable comments . 
  that was before you became a moderator . 
  i do not want to sound disrespectful or condescending by any means . 
  all i ask you to do is to please take a minute and reconsider wether or not gnomepocalypse 's comment should be deleted . 
  remember [ this ] ( http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m5hbik7otw1ro540l.png ) ? 
  aang was pretty damn close not to being able to have kids . 
  he would have stayed the last airbender . 
  like , of all time . 
  maybe harmonic convergence would then have endowed people with the long forgotten art of chipsbending , bringing ~ ~ transfats ~ ~ balance to the world . 
  always a pleasure to read your comments . 
  but although the blushing was probably the biggest indicator for a future relationship , [ i have to say that blushing did n't always end in two lovers finding their way to one another . 
  what ever , korrasami ftw . 
  i really hope that [ they do n't let makorra happen again . 
  i hope that chekhov 's gun does n't fire after we heard from the ep .8 preview that mako has n't had a relationship in three years . 
  even if it does happen , ** i 'm going down with the ship either way !, 
  ** ] ( / spoiler ) ( b4e8 preview spoiler ) . 
   be courteous :, 
  do n't be rude to the community , it 's not nice and most importantly , against the rules . 
  if `` shut your whore mouth '' is n't rude , what is ? 
  ^ ( also , what about the rediquette ? ), 
  does that somehow make it less offensive ? 
  it looks like i 'm not really up to date as far as memes are concerned . 
  either way i am thankful for your lengthy reply , it is definitely a good indicator of good moderation from your part . 
  as far as we know , junior is not a bender . 
  i do n't think the fight between them will be able to duplicate the epicness of zuko vs azula considering that bataar jr. would be in a mech . 
  hiroshi sato sacrifices himself in an effort to protect republic city from kuvira 's nuke . 
  cue emotional scene between him and asami . 
  shucks i forgot . 
  i 'll miss the shipping wars . 
  no matter whom you are shipping ( if at all ) , you got ta admit that seeing / u/slyfox00 [ 1 ] [ +12 ] debate with others about korrasami or seeing the occasional butthurt comment about a particular ship is always entertaining . 
  excellent , i love domics !, 
  pls nerf, 
  these fan theories have downright religious aspects to them . 
  i feel like we 're interpreting the bible or something . 
  i love this sub . 
  yeah , i hate it too when that happens . 
  have an upvote . 
  requesting torrent links gets you banned . 
  i suggest you delete your comment before a mod sees it !, 
  but * why ? 
  fight !, 
  fight !,
