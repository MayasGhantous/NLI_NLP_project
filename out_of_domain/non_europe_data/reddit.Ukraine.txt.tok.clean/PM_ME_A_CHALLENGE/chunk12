  fight !, 
   also , `` korrasamians '' is `` korra 's moans '' when autocorrected, 
  korrasami confirmed, 
  it 's a trap, 
  ~ ~ he has ~ ~ they have unlocked the ancient art of genderbending . 
  oh lawd have mercy on your soul, 
  did n't you just judge him based on a comment ? 
  and why are you defending op ? 
  do you want to convince us that `` driving while incomprehensibly high '' is * not * a display of irresponsibility ? 
  it is real . 
   * you 're ... you 're just an inanimate object ... *, 
   ** does this look inanimate to you , punk !? 
  it 's normal to feel sad when a series is over , i remember how i felt when breaking bad came to an end . 
  it is n't a rare occurrence that getting emotionally invested in a tv show is genuinely depriving your brain of reality . 
  when it 's over , you 'll have to go to school/to work , pay bills , handle your own internal problems , etc. 
  naturally , your brain wo n't like that and will want to go back to getting high on dopamine while seeing the title screen of a new lok episode . 
  while there wo n't be new episodes to watch , your brain will try to compensate by re-watching the old episodes ad infinitum , just as you described . 
  that will make the problem worse , but eventually you 'll get over it . 
  however , if you wish to accelerate the process :, 
  go outside more often . 
  meet up with your friends more often than you usually do . 
  draw or play an instrument ; any creative work will do . 
  the main point is to gradually accommodate yourself back into reality . 
  as much as i know that this is going to get me downvoted , avoid / r/thelastairbender when you 're feeling sad ( sure , discuss the finale with us for one evening but let it rest after that ) . 
  that 's like looking through your ex 's facbook profile after a nasty breakup . 
  if you feel like you have actual depression , please go visit a psychologist . 
  ** depression kills people every day . 
  do not treat the issue lightly . 
  ** it is better to get a diagnosis sooner than later . 
  let go your common sense . 
  empty , and become ooer . 
  that is almost 24 hours worth of film . 
  well , all the freedom to you ... also , why did you tag your post with [ promise ] ? 
  [ ** what 's that ? 
  i ca n't hear you , the wind is in my ears !, 
  ** ] ( http://drakyx.tumblr.com/post/103249061152/hhmmm-youre-so-sweet-al-fin-lo-termine ), 
  how nice of you !, 
  thank you , i know a lot of the korra fans are going to go through the same when the show is over and i 'm glad i can share this with the community . 
  i saw this on the front page and legitimately tried to comprehend this question . 
  then i noticed it 's from / r/shittyaskscience . 
  upvotes to you . 
  the [ promise ] tag is to be used when your post contains spoilers concerning the comic book trilogy '' [ the promise ] ( http://avatar.wikia.com/wiki/the_promise ) '' , where zuko is joined by the rest of team avatar and embarks on a journey to try and find his mother . 
  and no need to apologize !, 
  very valid point . 
  with high speed internet , it has never been so easy to distract yourself from reality than it is nowadays . 
  we are only a few clicks away from a world in which our problems are irrelevant . 
  it is important to know and to practice your self-discipline in moments when a series , a video game or even pornography is starting to get a grip on your life and starts causing issues with your mental health . 
  the addiction to new stimuli has never been as prevalent as it is now , and it 's rapidly becoming a major problem in the western world . 
  your plan does n't sound very sustainable . 
  screwing up your ~ ~ midterms ~ ~ mock exams is n't worth it . 
  seriously , i urge you to reconsider . 
  interestingly enough , for me the feeling of ` fun ' did n't last very long when i used to play online pvp games . 
  the feeling of satisfaction was soon replaced by a feeling of need , which created a nagging itch whenever i was n't playing . 
  fun was replaced by me sitting with a poor posture and a dead stare on my face in front of a screen at 3 am . 
  it was really kind of like a nicotine addiction . 
  but do n't get me wrong , if you 're having * actual * fun while playing , feel free to do continue !, 
  i just never really understood how persistently doing one and the same thing over and over could give anyone any joy . 
  interestingly enough , i myself am from europe but i assume that everyone is an american here , which is why i read it wrongly . 
  good luck . 
  there 's literally * dozens * of us !, 
  her face seems a little flat , but on the other hand , you nailed the shading !, 
  i hope my criticism is seen as constructive , either way this is way better than i could ever wish to draw . 
  yes , i feel like her face is indeed a little squished . 
  for comparison : [ click me ] ( http://cdn4.dualshockers.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/tumblr_static_f0okcjry0k08ock0oc4c0gw84.jpg?eaa32f ), 
  wow !, 
  thanks for making me notice . 
  remarkable !, 
  i always enjoyed his sketches in / r/askreddit . 
  this one is fantastic as well !, 
  i once chewed up and swallowed one whole habanero . 
  * once . 
  everyone get out of the thread , the message was supposed to be for * me * and * me * only !, 
  i want a life size unavaatu plushy, 
  ... korrasami confirmed !, 
  as far as the shipping goes , i think it will end with on an ambiguous note , like one of the last scenes being a close-up of korra 's and asami 's hands awkwardly finding their way to another and holding each other for a second ( without seeing their facial reactions for added ambiguity ! ), 
  until the scene changes to an aerial shot displaying however the world has changed and we 'll never see the two again . 
  imho that would be the most tasteful way to end the show relationship-wise . 
  how about a lionturtle in your front yard ? 
  well that belongs to / r/noisygifs . 
  especially roku 's firebending . 
  i bet suyin would have given him a job as a chef so he could finally defy his father 's wishes of him joining the military and dedicate his life to the creation of delicious pastry . 
  i * am * the empire state building . 
  it would be beneficial if we could all keep the discussion opinion-oriented and acknowledge that none of us knows what is actually going to happen , rather than submit unsustainable claims . 
  he has released his earthly tether . 
  oh , and his spine , too . 
  i 'm afraid you did n't understand my point . 
  i prefaced my comment with `` i think '' . 
  it 's not a claim . 
  you , on the other hand , are doing as if you already know , which is harming the flow of the discussion . 
  * you 're goddamn right . 
  how would you know ? 
  and how on earth is it disrespectful ? 
   and it 's disrespectful because they dedicate so much into their art, 
  * nobody * is dictating * anything * to * anyone * . 
  since the show is not over yet and neither you nor i know what is coming , it is natural to make assumptions about how the show will end . 
   friends in the right places . 
  it is hard to believe you are so passionate about bashing people who are rooting for one thing to happen that you lie to a stranger on the internet about contacts you likely do n't have . 
  if you do , then please post a reply containing the exact outcome of how the series will end ** with as many details as possible ** pertaining to the upcoming episodes if you want your previous replies to have any weight in this discussion . 
  i 'm afraid this is the only way you can prove that you are not making unsustainable claims , yet something tells me that you are going to reply with either a variation of `` psh , i do n't have to tell you anything , i have better things to do '' , not reply at all or post a reply that is irrelevant to the discussion . 
  the cloud to butt extension for chrome has never made a comment as confusing a this one .
