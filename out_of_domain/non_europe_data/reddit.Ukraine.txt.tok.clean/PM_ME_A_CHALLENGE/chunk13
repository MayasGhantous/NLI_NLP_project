   well then you 'll have to remain disappointed . 
  i 'm not like nick - dumb enough to let the story leak onto the internet . 
  i keep mum about spoilers . 
  we see how well that worked out a few comments ago when you pretended to * know * korrasami was not going to happen . 
  i rest my case . 
  by no means am i trying to offend your otherwise awesome mousepad , but is it the camera 's or the manufacturer 's fault that the colors are so much less vibrant than in the image you used as a template ? 
  good to hear !, 
  awesome background , good taste . 
  the hamster ball of doom will make a return !, 
  it would literally tear shit apart . 
  i rarely accept the challenges since most of them are variations of `` shoot yourself in the foot '' . 
  putting three metal strips over vaatu 's eye symbol thing for good measure . 
  i love it . 
  i guess the need for being dominated runs in the family ? 
  it look like she has n't been missing leg day since the day tonaraq and senna * did the thing . 
  is it watercolor ? 
  i like it except for her outfit , in any case this is way better than anything i could ever hope to draw . 
  the background and the lines coming from the rock she just drew from the ground make it seem very dynamic as well . 
  good job overall !, 
  start off with ** the lost adventures ** . 
  they are essentially like little atla episodes that have n't been animated . 
  continue with ** the promise ** , where the aftermath of the atla finale is exposed and zuko 's reign as firelord commences , which proves to be very difficult as both him and aang are faced with making very tough decisions . 
  go on with ** the search ** , where zuko embarks with his friends on a journey and tries to find his mother while many things get out of hand . 
  finish with ** the rift ** , where aang tries to find balance between spirits and humans . 
  the promise , the search and the rift are all three part comic books , whereas the lost adventures is a single collection . 
  have fun !, 
  they are all worth reading and the art is always pleasant to the eye . 
  let go your bolin bolin, 
  enter bolin, 
  bolin , and bolin bolin, 
  :d ... d : ... :d, 
   the bo bo lin lin, 
   into bolinrubo forest, 
  hahaha where did the ` forest ' part come from ? 
  ^ ( let the bodies hit the floor ), 
  til !, 
  pretty neat !, 
  i now remember those from some lessons i took years ago . 
  i also remember how the combination of fire ( \u706b ) and forest ( \u6797 ) creates the word ` burning ' ( \u711a ) . 
  the language seems to share a lot of characteristics with german , where you can create a virtual infinity of words by putting them together , e.g. 
  ` mit ' ( with ) and ` arbeit ' ( work ) can create ` mitarbeit ' ( collaboration or participation , depending on context ) . 
  both very lego-like languages !, 
  fascinating . 
  well , i know there was a plot twist coming . 
  kuvira is n't the final boss ... 
  it was opal all along !, 
  well , what does it mean ? 
  looks like you did, 
  [ spoiler ] ( / s `` azula killes dumbledore '' ), 
  try, 
  [ azula kills dumbledore ] ( / spoiler ), 
  i live near a highway . 
  same sound . 
  pretty interesting , now that i think of it ... 
  they should become a couple and name their child chili con carne . 
  has an aristocratic ring to it . 
  kinda late to the party , but when i was like 8 , i used to think that gay men had sex by stretching the receivers ' peehole so that his buddy could put his dick inside . 
  yip yip !, 
  francis bean x daughter of op 's cousin, 
  nice !, 
  do you have the svg file ? 
  hmm , good question . 
  while i ca n't answer for that guy , it seems as if most tumbler posters are female , although i could be mistaken . 
  it is strange to see men ( the sex , not the gender ) finding their place in a community that is outwardly centered around the idea that men are an inferior sex in some aspect or another . 
  if the poll turns out to be positive ( which i think it will ) , please put up another poll assessing whether or not the community likes the prototypes of raava/vaatu once they 're there !, 
  in reaction to [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/thelastairbender/comments/2nfud2/no_spoilers_tenzin_the_browbender/ ), 
  glorious and great uniter always of many strong . 
  is nothing but lie . 
  that 's probably why all girls i know that have plucked their eyebrows then decide to draw them back on . 
  do n't know . 
  i prefer darker eyebrows on girls . 
  but i guess this is something that just makes a lot of people get minority complexes that should n't be there in the first place , like the length of eyelashes . 
  i know some girls who obsess over such a minute thing that most guys will never even care for even notice . 
  it has released its earthly tether . 
  this is n't about the us , i 'm not sure why you are [ trying to legitimize the actions of a party by pointing out the errors of the adversary party ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/whataboutism ) ; it is irrelevant to the greater issue . 
  [ here 's even better quality at 1/36th the file size !, 
  ^ #html 5masterrace, 
  ^ #gfymasterrace, 
  why black and white though ? 
  edit : thanks !, 
  why would anyone establish rules like that , we 're saving bandwidth !, 
  i 'm sorry , but how is the rating scale ` objective ' ? 
  in medicine , a scale from 0 to 10 ( [ nrs-11 ] ( http://www.webcitation.org/6ag75mdiq ) ) is used to assess pain , which is a subjective experience . 
  bummer , huh ? 
  hey , there 's this really cool party going on in / r/eeducationcamp . 
  there 's even gon na be a guy presenting ~ ~ new trade skills ~ ~ , uh , * magic tricks * . 
   ( c ) owner of the photo and caption, 
  this is just too good to be true . 
  thank you for the inspiration !, 
  flameo , indeed . 
  was it obvious or did you watch the episode in super slow mode ? 
  i downloaded them as well but i do n't recall seeing these frames . 
  any more room for beta testers ? 
  gladly !, 
  what does that entail ? 
   what group of people were hated by hitler , or who hitler 's enemies were . 
  i have to say that the first question is n't very brightly phrased either since it implies that there was only * one * group . 
  - gypsies, 
  - slavs, 
  - jews,
