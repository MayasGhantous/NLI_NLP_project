  they should be able to answer all question that are country-specific ( should you get a referral to a psychiatrist from your family physician ? 
  how much is the cost of a psychologist in your region ? 
  are there psychology clinics nearby that offer free assistance ? ) . 
  do n't hesitate to call more than one line to perhaps get a different opinion . 
  depending on where you are right now in terms of your depression , calling a stranger might be a tough decision . 
  if you do n't want to do it , it 's fine !, 
  going to a family physician and asking him about what you should do now would be a fantastic idea at this point . 
  your doctor will then show you the different options that exist . 
  calling a psychologist is also an option , but i would make sure that you first go to your family physician , since he will be able to provide you with more information regarding needs outside of the realm of psychological therapy , such as the eventual need for medication . 
   or tell a friend, 
  whether or not you want to confide in a friend is also dependent upon many factors . 
  it all depends on the level of trust that exists between the two of you , and if you can count on genuine support from the other person ( as some people may project their own ideas of help which might not be helpful at all ) . 
  [ here 's an article by webmd ] ( http://www.webmd.com/depression/features/depression-asking-loved-ones-for-help ) targeting that question . 
  if you do have a friend whom you can count on ( * especially * if they have gone through depression themselves !, 
  ) , talking to them might be an excellent decision . 
  thank you for the kind words and your willingness to help out others !, 
  you are very , very welcome . 
  thank you a lot for sharing your appreciation , it truly means the world to me . 
  i wish you good luck on your journey , but since you have already expressed the * will * to get better , i can assure you that the journey wo n't be a long one . 
  cheers !, 
  thank you for commenting !, 
  it means a lot to me to know that my work is appreciated , i really hope you have gotten something out of it . 
  2,699 emails in your inbox ? 
  seems like the binge watching the series before the finale has left some scars !, 
   tomorrow, 
  did i pass out for a day or something ? 
  are you having suicidal thoughts ? 
  we can only hope that netflix or adult swim buy the franchise ... 
  it might be a good idea to look for anchors that are more stable than a tv show . 
  consider following the advice given in the article i have written ; it is well researched and aims at bettering the lives of people who are very emotionally invested in the show . 
  i suggest you give it a try !, 
  that just looks delicious . 
  i 'm sure that since the erosion has contributed to many cracks , it might be on the easier side of climbing challenges , but it looks fantastic nonetheless . 
  you may wish to make use of the references provided at the end of the article , it seems like you 're struggling with depression . 
  not a fun place to be !, 
  it 's a rather normal reaction , many people react that way if they did n't struggle with it themselves or if they do n't / did n't know anyone who did . 
  the main point of the post was indeed that of raising awareness around the subject and devoted to help to those in need . 
  first off , it is n't unusual that a work of art ( books , plays , operas , movies , shows ) affect ones life . 
  this can go really far : back in the day when * the sorrows of young werther * by goethe was published in 1774 , many young men identified themselves with the main character . 
  the problem was that at the end of the story , he commits suicide , which prompted a wave of suicides from some of those who read the book across the countries where it was published . 
  today , psychologists even refer to phenomena that resemble what happened back then as the [ werther effect ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/copycat_suicide ) . 
  the same can go the other way around , however : in mozart 's opera * the magic flute * from 1791 , a character called papageno mulls over the idea of suicide , until suddenly three boys convince him not to follow through on his ideations . 
  when for example a newspaper does not sensationalize a death by suicide but instead offers ways of coping with suicidal thoughts for readers in need , it seems to help people who are suicidal and makes them seek out help more willingly . 
  this is called the papageno effect . 
  i found a super interesting [ research article ] ( http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/197/3/234.full ) on the topic if you want to read it !, 
  anyway , i 'm going off topic . 
  the point of the above is to say that it is not uncommon to be moved in one way or another by a work of art , even to the point where one considers life or one considers death . 
  by extension , this would mean that it is normal to feel drawn into a particular set of emotions that are less extreme than the ones described above . 
  do n't feel shameful at the feelings you are experiencing !, 
  the way that you felt is likely a result of your total immersion into the series . 
  i have linked the wikipedia article to [ escapism ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/escapism ) in the post , perhaps you can identify yourself with what is written in it . 
  i 'm afraid i have no definite answer to your question . 
  it seems as if there are two antithetic solutions to your problem : indulge or reject . 
  it may depend on how you believe the problem at hand looks like from an objective perspective : whether it is * grief * ( in which case going through the stages of grief might be a good idea ) or whether it is an * addiction * ( which is more likely if you have escapist tendencies . 
  here 's a [ link ] ( http://behaviorhealth.bizcalcs.com/calculator.asp?calc=general-addiction-symptoms ) that might be useful . 
  i am not sure if the content is clinically reliable to 100 % , but it should give you a general idea on where you are right now ) . 
  i invite you to think about which one of those fits you and to research a solution accordingly , since this is the point at which i 'm afraid i ca n't give advice because of my lack of knowledge . 
  in any case , following through on at least some the advice outlines in my post would be the best thing you could possibly do for yourself at this point . 
  it has been thoroughly researched and aims at bettering your situation no matter on what end of the depression-grief-addiction spectrum you currently are . 
  if you are to follow only a single one of the points of advice in the post , i strongly suggest you commit yourself to going outside more often and perhaps even to further that by starting a solid work out routine if you do n't feel overwhelmed by the idea of it . 
  / r/fitness has * tons * of fantastic resources on the topic . 
  i 'm sure your therapist would greatly approve of a positive lifestyle change in that direction !, 
  thanks for commenting , and good luck !, 
  it seems as if you have rather [ escapist tendencies ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/escapism ) . 
  perhaps you should start questioning whether or not that behavior is in your best interests !, 
  hey !, 
  you 're welcome , i 'm happy that you read it . 
  perhaps getting psychological help would be a good idea . 
  i hope that you talked your rejection of antidepressants through with your psychiatrist !, 
  asking for help is definitely the first step in the right direction . 
  ps : good luck with that , personally i am on the other end of the world . 
  my pleasure !, 
  i hope you got something out of it . 
  outside is where you make friends !, 
  at the gym , while walking your dog , while rock climbing , while hiking , at conventions . 
  try out something new sometime !, 
  that would be a fantastic way of getting out of the fog you 're in , but i suggest taking it slowly by starting to walk for 20 minutes around the block or at a park every day . 
  baby steps !, 
  good luck . 
  i love you too !,
