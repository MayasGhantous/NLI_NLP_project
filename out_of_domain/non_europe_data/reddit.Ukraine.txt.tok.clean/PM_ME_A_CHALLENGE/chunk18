  i beg your pardon ? 
  i heard his name was johto . 
  wow , i ca n't imagine what you went through . 
  i 'm not even sure what to say . 
  i wrote [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/thelastairbender/comments/2phytq/meta_feeling_unusually_down_an_open_letter_to_the/ ) a few days ago for people who think that the series ' end will affect them in unwanted ways , perhaps you may want to take a look at it . 
  i hope you 'll feel better soon !, 
  i must say that i strongly disapprove of people using #korrasami at this point , they 're unwillingly spoiling the most tasteful ending to one of the best tv shows ever for those who have n't watched it yet !, 
  [ how does it feel to be exposed as a liar ] ( / spoiler ) ? 
  thank you !, 
  stay strong , i 'm sure you 'll be fine . 
  hey !, 
  thanks a lot for keeping the silence , it was a marvelous ending . 
  what did the folks at viacom say about the ending ? 
  was korrasami intentional or did they just want to keep the audience guessing ? 
  thanks for the update by the way !, 
  too bad we did n't see the new fire nation army , i would have loved to see a platoon of combustion benders helping team avatar fight the colossus . 
  oh well , the finale was still absolutely amazing !, 
  i know , right ? 
  i thought turtles were vegetarians . 
  bryke never seizes to improve the show !, 
  i have a friend at viacom who showed me the design for a lion turle eating kuvira . 
  i mean , we all knew it was going to happen !, 
  well , in hindsight , [ it was * kinda * real . 
  ] ( / spoiler ), 
  i always knew i could see into the future ... 
  but only like , half the future . 
  crazy stuff !, 
  only to have him fight for the bad guys and get crushed to death in the finale ... 
  but you 're right , the spirits are surely inspired by * spirited away * . 
  the miyasaki is strong in this one !, 
  i know this might be a very , very unpopular opinion due to many people wanting a prequel with kyoshi or something similar . 
  personally , i would want the franchise to stop here . 
  it ended on such a beautiful and tasteful note that i really ca n't think of anything that could be added to make the story even better than it already is . 
  the ending was somewhat ambiguous , however it 's not the kind of ambiguity that is frustrating but rather one that leaves a slightly longing aftertaste in your mouth that is nevertheless satisfying . 
  watching the finale was like eating * just * the right amount of pizza , after which one is neither hungry nor bloated but absolutely satisfied . 
  a sequel to tlok , whether it be a mini-series or a comic , would take away some of that satisfying longing , and although a rather big portion of my brain screams for * more * , i know that i 'll want more no matter how much i 'll get and that any ending would leave a dull void and a `` what now ? '', 
  kind of feeling , so i would rather have it end on todays episode . 
  lack of purpose does n't sound like something something that can be remedied by watching another show ( [ click me ! ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/thelastairbender/comments/2phytq/meta_feeling_unusually_down_an_open_letter_to_the/ ) ) . 
  if you 're looking for something that has the same feel as tlok at least in some regards , i suggest some of the animated movies by studio ghibli , starting with [ princess mononoke ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/princess_mononoke ) and [ spirited away ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spirited_away ) . 
  some say that the spirits in books 2 , 3 and 4 were heavily inspired by those , and they are absolutely phenomenal movies altogether !, 
  it 's new and unusual . 
  the odds were stacked against anyone who wanted to be entertained by this kind of novelty , and people were feeling very refreshed about it actually happening . 
  personally , seeing it made me happy but i certainly did n't react as violently as the girls you posted above . 
  i 'm sure the lgbt community got a bigger kick out of the ending than me , though !, 
  i know that the bay used to have a 720p upscale version of atla . 
  however , it 's like 20gb and only * marginally * better than the 480p versions !, 
  i 'm sure you can find it on the backups of the bay , i do n't think the mods will approve of me posting the link . 
  ^ ( please , * do n't * pm me asking for the link ), 
  well , you can pm anything you want , but that does n't mean i 'll accept the challenge , 
  yerr right , cause ' o dem gosh darn tootin ' lezzies we ai n't gettin ' no mo ' kids !, 
  wow , now * that * is a longshot . 
  i do n't think that korra would let asami 's dad die because of that . 
  well , this sub sure is here to stay !, 
  is everything okay ? 
  i do n't think he could have predicted that a scenario like that would happen . 
  people spoiling the ending in all corners of the web ... 
  nah , that 's fluoridation . 
  i 'm the author of the post , and i would like to say that the advice in there is very well researched in terms of alleviating symptoms of depression . 
  give it a try , op !, 
  good to see your resolution of drawing or playing guitar ( [ is n't the harmonic minor scale absolutely gorgeous ? ] ( http://gosk.com/scales/harmonic-minor-scale-for-guitar.php ) ) . 
  the void is normal considering that you were so heavily involved in the show . 
  when the human brain is so absorbed by something it tends to block out reality , leading to a quite literal feeling of death when that reality is no more . 
  there are many parallels with substance addiction , you might notice !, 
  although it may be hard at first , replacing the brain 's longing for * more * with constructive , tangible and real things gradually adapts it back into the `` real '' reality , thus filling the feeling of emptiness you may experience . 
  stay strong !, 
  edit : resubmitted since reddit ate half of my message whilst posting it, 
  i posted my [ finale prediction pic ] ( http://i.imgur.com/8rf7feh.png ) the day before the finale , it would have been quite scary if it turned out to be true . 
  only turned out to be semi-true . 
   right , but both of those were displays of bending power , not physical strength . 
  pretty sure that the moment she freed herself from the platinum chains in the red lotus stronghold was a demonstration of physical strength and not bending power .

  how do you even, 
  engineer love interests, 
   ... it also looks sick . 
  mostly this, 
  lmao, 
   and i swear , he was like * this * big !, 
  gets me every time !, 
  where do you get these from ? 
  coming from someone who finished high school this summer , i would like you to know that all of my friends who barely passed now wish they had studies harder in order to get into better universities . 
  when you 'll graduate a few years from now , i * assure * you that many of your friends will say the same as them . 
  back when i was in sixth grade in 2007/08 , i remember my arts teacher telling us repeatedly `` quickly , let 's get started !, 
  your final exams are * tomorrow * '' ( in my countries ' school system you had to pass a bunch of finals to graduate from high school ) . 
  my friends and i used to make fun of her weird sense of humor . 
  `` bitch , we 're like 12 '' was something we said amongst ourselves silently whilst thinking we were smart , after all the finals were 2014 which was 6 years from then !, 
  the day before my finals i remembered her words . 
  man , time flies more than you can imagine . 
  she was right ; the finals were * tomorrow * . 
  i 'm glad i pulled my grades up after 9th grade , at the end of the day the results were well worth getting accepted to some of the world 's top 20 universities . 
  columbia is definitely an ambitious goal , but whether or not you 'll get in depends * solely * on you . 
  this could either be good or bad news ; * that * is purely within your control . 
  the funny thing about time is that it 'll pass at a linear speed no matter what you do -- the only thing you have power over is what you do with it . 
  ** tl ; dr : many of your friends regret not having studied harder after school was over . 
  do n't become one of them !, 
  sorry , i was being inattentive . 
  all hail the great imgurizer !, 
  sorry , i was being inattentive .
