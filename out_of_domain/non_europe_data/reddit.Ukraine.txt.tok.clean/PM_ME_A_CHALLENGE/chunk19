  all hail the great imgurizer !, 
  hmm , looks like something is wrong with the links , although it could be just me who is getting 403s . 
  perhaps re-upload the pictures to imgur !, 
  the frogs were two parts of the same body if i recall correctly . 
  that might make the parallel clearer !, 
  ( 1 ) it did n't get removed , currently it seems like the post is still in / new . 
  i 'm awfully sorry that you got spoiled , but the fact of the matter is that / u/automoderator did n't recognize [ search ] like it usually does and is supposed to . 
  if you look a few comments below this one , you will notice that the moderators are working on a solution for that . 
  ( 2 ) replying again since res is being crazy and posts the comment automatically when i press enter instead of creating a new line . 
  ( 3 ) anyway , this post is satirizing nothing but the first part of the search . 
  you will notice that it only spoiled a very insignificant aspect of it , but i wo n't elaborate on that in order to avoid spoiling it further . 
  happy reading , and apologies for any inconvenience !, 
  no need to apologize !, 
  i had to deal with many angry comments on reddit and yours certainly was n't one of them , haha . 
  i completely understand where you 're coming from . 
  i gave a numerical order to my comments , hopefully that makes them retroactively less confusing . 
  but really , the gif in this post only depicts a minuscule aspect of the search . 
  this may sound stupid , but it 'll make sense once you read the comics . 
  i suggest you read them before the bot goes rogue again , they are truly fantastic !, 
  with all the slave labor the footage from bbc , i would say apple . 
  shaving off their eyebrows and drawing them back on . 
  what the fuck ? 
  something something mom 's spaghetti !,

  [ die atzen - disco pogo ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwsqqgbkkjc ), 
  it 's in german but got kind of a worldwide cult status around 2010 . 
  the youtube video in the link has 40m views . 
  no , you see , it 's a meme called tree-fiddy , my family did n't actually die and i did n't actually end up homeless on the streets and addicted to drugs ... 
  it 's funny on the internet ... 
  are you meaning to say that holding on to a new years firework rocket while lighting it is a * bad * idea ? 
  you are very welcome !, 
  i 'm sure you 'll work through this , many do n't understand that [ the human brain can run multiple realities in parallel and get lost somewhere in between ] ( http://cns-alumni.bu.edu/~slehar/webstuff/book/chap1.html ) . 
  likewise , merry christmas !,

  do n't leave us hanging here !, 
   a story line about a white-passing cishet male character kissing and winning the beautiful woc . 
  that in itself is extremely problematic for a number of reasons . 
  that 's about where this post lost any and all credibility .

  who 's side are you on ?? 
  alright class , which guru was the first to synthesize methylamine ? 
  does anyone * other * than otaku know the answer ? 
  haha , that 's certainly an interesting title to hold . 
  i 'm honored !, 
  hope you got something out of the guide , thanks for commenting !, 
  i always crossed fingers , it 's a much more natural position . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ have i been holding hands wrong my entire life ?!?!!? 
  katara knowing how to bloodbend , well ... 
  no no no , * clearly * he looks like walter white . 
  woah , woah , woah , what happened here ? 
  just wanted to say nice work on the spreadsheet , looks like it took you a while . 
  glad to see that you guys are so involved in keeping the community alive . 
  my girlfriend in 9th grade had given me a huge asymmetrical hickey on my neck . 
  after that , i suddenly noticed that every teacher i knew was nicer to me and treated me with an unusual compassion . 
  i only recently found out from a classmate that it was because my sports teacher thought that my parents were choking me and started a rumor . 
  i probably could have made a better job at hiding it , but hey , 9th grade me thought i was the shit . 
  i wore it like a necklace . 
  instructions unclear . 
  became homeless . 
  i 'd do it again !, 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ now , can someone please challenge me to get a degree in engineering or something so i can afford a home again, 
  i 'm sure you 'll work through it !, 
  just make sure you space out your binge-watching sessions with some activity that does n't have anything to do with atla or lok so you do n't lose track of reality . 
  are you saying they should ... * breed * ? 
  well if that does n't * smell like teen spirit * to you , there 's definitely * something in the way * between you and understanding my point . 
  looking at his username , i assume he does something with applied mathematics . 
  very interesting points , i have n't thought of it that way before . 
  i really ca n't think of any character development as far as asami is concerned , now that you mention it . 
  i believe it could have been more interesting to start her off as slightly ( but only slightly ! ), 
  less annoying than wu , in a way that she has little guidance and relies heavily on her father , then let her become a full fledged engineer with a sense of responsibility and purpose through a series of traumatic events . 
  but yeah , i guess we 're still both in the unpopular opinion zone . 
  what an unusual and interesting path !, 
  care to elaborate on the transition to trade , what your family 's reaction was and how you got to make more money than most compsci grads ? 
  interesting . 
  how did you come to the conclusion that you wanted to study petroleum engineering ? 
  edit : guys , could you please stop downvoting him ? 
  how did you get a job in the oil industry with a bio degree ? 
  yeah , also that varrick got his natural curiosity from his father . ^ ( i want to believe ), 
  thanks for the reply !, 
  what does your typical work week look like though ? 
  that seems pretty low for a md , how come ? 
  non smoker here admiring the craftsmanship , it 's pretty neat . 
  do you have anything for scale ? 
  until i saw the opening on appa 's tail i was rather confused as to how big it actually is . 
  also , where did you get it from ? 
  interesting question , i voted atla book 3 although it was pretty much tied with lok b3 and lok b4 . 
  all of them had outstanding action sequences , but seeing a peaceful airbender get into the hamster ball of doom was beyond satisfying . 
  outstanding work i must say !, 
  how come ? 
  i get you , it 's a transition we all have to make . 
  might as well make the best out of it !, 
  being scared is part of the game , you 're certainly not alone in that . 
  which comic ? 
  step aside , peasant . 
  this is how you do it . 
  \\* clears throat *, 
  [ i tried !, 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/m9ggknm.png ) hope you like it . 
  no problem !, 
  also , i noticed that i had two color charts for earth and none for air .
