  interestingly enough , he found a peculiarly dark kind of humor in his remark and smirked faintly . 
  the same sentence that was currently irritating him has accompanied him for the past 70 years . 
  he tried to ignore it . 
  he decided to take a walk around the block -- at least what was left of it . 
  he exited the overgrown entrance of what once was a skyscraper in the very heart of manhattan that granted stunning views over the city to whomever could afford such a luxury . 
  in spite of his age , he had the physique of a well built young adult . 
  his broad shoulders and his height made him capable of wooing any woman he desired to spend his night with . 
  he kicked a footlong piece of concrete out of the way as he entered the outside world . 
  the clear blue sky was offending him . 
  as were the gorgeous birds chirping away and singing melodies that carried with them more true love than jacob was ever capable of understanding . 
  he was effectively colorblind to the beauty and calm of the marvelous spring that greeted what once was new york city . 
  ever since the war , the buildings that once harbored humans became immense corral reefs that became the became the new homes of flowers , grass and vines . 
  nature took over ; after all , it has been a while since jacob became the only person left on the face of earth . 
  biological warfare and obscure military doctrines were what the collective suicide of humanity was made off . 
  it all happened during the late 2010s a.d. -- it has probably been decades since , perhaps even hundreds of years -- jacob did n't know and did n't care enough to find out . 
  he hiked up a hill that has given birth to itself in the middle of the island after the collapse of multiple towers . 
  the hill did n't have any symmetry and ended the the top of some 10 story building , where jacob regularly sat down to enjoy the breathtaking scenery and to suppress his loneliness . 
  he found out the hard way that even psychopaths like him were capable of feeling lonely in some circumstances . 
  he laid down onto the furry grass that grew on the roof of said building . 
  * this is all my fault * , he thought silently . 
  `` this is all my fault '' , he now said with a stern voice . 
  `` this is all my fault !, 
  '' , he now screamed at the top of his lungs and shed a tear , perhaps his first ever . 
  he started crying like he did n't even know he was capable of whilst listening to his scream reverberating around the crumbling walls of far away buildings . 
  he knew he should n't have made those shady weapons deals . 
  he supplied both sides of the conflict with all kinds of arms , just so he could pocket more money and buy more * things * to spend his time with , to fill his useless existence with epicurean pleasure , to award some pastime to the hollow glove of skin that housed his ill mind . 
  he knew he should n't have used all the politicians as marionettes to make their states stock up on even more weapons . 
  he knew that he should n't have gotten that mysterious tattoo on his wrist from that strange man and have paid billions to become immortal . 
  he knew he should have used his media outlets to publicly state that * he * was the one responsible for all the sorrow in the world , that it was * him * who pulled all the strings behind the scene and then shoot himself too give this nightmare an end . 
  * that 's it * , he thought and jumped from the roof he was on , feeling relief as the air around him caressed his body . 
  his relief was short lived . 
  he crashed onto the debris on the ground and broke every single bone in his body , unable to faint an unable to hope for help . 
  he should have died . 
  he did n't . 
  `` why !, 
  '' , he screamed again furiously as every ounce of hope was ridded from him by his pain . 
  he could n't move . 
  was this how he would spend eternity ? 
  all of a sudden , he noticed a second tattoo on his right wrist . 
  * you know exactly why . 
  * it read . 
  terrified , he found another one on his left forearm . 
  * you shall spend as many lifetimes as *, 
  confused , he looked on his write forearm . 
  * those , who you murdered , would have spent *, 
  now , tattoos were popping up on his hands and fingers . 
  * this is the price you must pay for the next generation of humans who shall populate this planet , who through your sacrifice will live in peace and through your suffering will know deep within what awaits foolish greed *, 
  suddenly , new tattoos stopped popping up . 
  jacob was as terrified as he was in pain from the jump . 
  he closed his eyes briefly and opened them . 
  his whole body was covered in repeating capital letter tattoos . 
  * for it is you *, 
  * who will never die *,

  ... what, 
  i thought it would be the adjective to the interjection `` shoot ! '', 
  which is commonly used to replace `` shit !, 
  '' , i even recall having heard it in atla . 
  then again , the writers of the series have often used `` non-swearing '' rather obviously ( lin : '' * what the flameo is going on ? 
  i am concerned about my [ anonymity ] ( http://help.surveymonkey.com/articles/en_us/kb/are-my-survey-responses-anonymous-and-secure/ ) . 
   its not like the website is pulling your name , and ip address and showing it to me . 
  here 's an extract from the [ link i previously posted ] ( http://help.surveymonkey.com/articles/en_us/kb/are-my-survey-responses-anonymous-and-secure/ ) :, 
   respondents ' personal information can be captured by the survey creator in two ways : by expressly asking you for your personal details ( name , address , etc. 
  ) , and by configuring the survey to automatically capture your ip address and/or email address . 
  look , i am not trying to offend you . 
  the problem is that the way i procure my episodes is `` legally questionable '' to say the least -- and you know to what extent certain law firms are willing to go to harness confessions of otherwise regular people . 
  you know , the kind that are just willing to help someone out who is genuinely interested in lok 's demographics . 
  i am fully supportive of what you are doing ; hopefully you could use google docs ' integrated survey function in future surveys . 
  great !, 
  count me in on the next survey . 
  this is glorious . 
  following your logic , firebenders really are just a variation of airbenders . 
  which would make for a plot twist of epic proportions . 
  hmm . 
  i recall that one scene where aang and monk gyatso were making these fluffy cupcakes and catapulted them onto the heads of other monks . 
  since cupcakes use some kind of cream which is a byproduct of milk , i would assume that they also eat cheese . 
  i thought quite a lot about lightening . 
  i mean , mako could have used it * all the time * against those giant robot things in book 1 instead of uselessly throwing fireballs at them !, 
  maybe there could be a back story about the lion turtles . 
  although i believe that that plot twist would be highly unlikely , i am excited for the twists this book has to offer in future episodes . 
   we only use a small % of our brains, 
  while that statement is very popular , it is [ false ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ten_percent_of_brain_myth ) . 
  at some point , i 'm sure every avatar fan has concluded that being able to bend the elements * would * be the coolest thing ever . 
  it certainly has a very radiant appeal . 
  the problem is that this issue is not debatable ; there are no conclusive arguments on either side . 
  what 's left is hoping and wishing , and that is , at least from a philosophical point of view , the most * human * paradigm to exist . 
  let 's take a moment to think about the series and congratulate the creators for unleashing all kinds of imagination in its fans , spawning innumerable amounts of fan fiction and countless dreams and wishes to be able to live in a world they have created . 
  i believe that * that * is the hallmark of a truly excellent work of art .
