  [ here 's one for air ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fvmspab.png ) , although i 'm not too happy with it . 
  be sure to post the end results on here , i 'm excited to see them !, 
  i can feel the downvotes pouring over my comment . 
  i sure am one to enjoy a lot of the content here and the girl who posted this sure is n't someone who i 'd like to have as a friend , especially after having read that she claims to be a radical feminist and has named her son `` fallyn star '' . 
  she definitely has plenty of issues to work with and i 'm sure that getting a gym membership might contribute to both her physical and especially her mental health , seeing as she clearly has trouble in approaching everyday problems , mostly attributing them to factors that are of surprisingly little relevance , such as whether or not her boss is sexist . 
  but looking at these comments just makes me shake my head . 
  this whole thread looks and feels like a middle school locker conversation . 
  most people here seem to expect from her to instantly hit the gym after having been called out and insulted for being clearly overweight instead of the initial feeling of being upset . 
  the fact that she 'll have to change her ways if she is to live a sustainable life will hit her sooner or later , but neither the drunkard who has inappropriately insulted her nor any of you who are echoing exactly that will lead her to making better decisions . 
  most of these comments are just as pointless as her rambling in that they do not contribute to a greater good and instead perpetrate juvenile finger-pointing without looking for underlying issues . 
  all her post inspired in me is a deep sense sorrow , mostly due to the fact that she is terribly misguided as to where she should apply her energy . 
  hopefully one day she 'll find out that effecting worthwhile change on oneself is of greater good than rambling about boogeymen on the internet , and hopefully some of you will realize that bullying people you do n't know on reddit is largely inferior to taking a look at the bigger picture at hand and contributing to eradicating erroneous beliefs . 
  kerrrerrrserrrmeee cuhhhnferrrrrmed, 
  hey !, 
  what are some common misconceptions about mental health issues , mainly depression , that you believe are prevalent in western society ? 
  thank you for your service to humanity , i hope you realize what impact you have on people 's lives . 
  very interesting reply !, 
  thanks for answering . 
  i have a question regarding your following statement :, 
   complete and total treatment ( meaning extinction of all symptoms , forever ) is n't realistic, 
  why is that so ? 
  i believe it 's in reference to [ this / r/funny post ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/2qmpn3/phoebe_was_a_master_of_pickup_lines/ ) that was submitted 5 hours ago as of now and is currently on the front page of / r/all . 
  i just noticed that his user page does n't exist , but why can we see his comment if he is shadowbanned ? 
  i thought you ca n't interact with anyone if you 're shadowbanned . 
  so ... 1x10 ^ 16 ? 
  so ... jnbbgsgra in base 62 ? 
  i think their `` hetero-lenses '' comment was absolutely unnecessary , arrogant and childish . 
  it 's like they try to repel any criticism of the ending by saying `` oh well , looks like you 're just too retarded to understand '' , like they have achieved enlightenment in comparison to whomever dare criticize their work . 
  looks like kuvira was a real incarnation of negakorra all along !, 
  find yourself first , then find your talent, 
  you just proved my point . 
  guys , could you please stop downvoting him ? 
  i 'm legitimately interested if this is true or if that guy pulled the statistic out of his ass . 
  including : how to hate women , how to blame your shortcomings on factors outside of your control and how to be in a permanent state of dissatisfaction and * especially * how to feel inherently superior in relation to anyone who does n't agree with you since you will believe to have achieved enlightenment . 
  feel free to go ahead and link this comment to trp and ramble with the rest of your herd about how ` beta ' i am . 
  ** to op , do n't go there . 
  ** it 's philosophy lures you in with solid advice , mainly how to become an archetypical ` alpha ' male who actively pursues meaningful goals and thus becomes more attractive to women without clinging to them . 
  good stuff , right ? 
  the main problem is the poisonous interjection of misogyny . 
  amongst bouts of good advice , you 'll oftentimes find things like ' [ do n't trust women , [ they are by default lying and manipulative ] ] ( http://i.imgur.com/zggzxgg.png ) ' , ' [ love does n't exist ] ( http://i.imgur.com/kqdp7rv.png ) ' or [ other sweeping nonsense generalizations about women that are absolutely laughable ] ( http://i.imgur.com/qogcqnx.png ) . 
  all of the screenshots provided are from today 's front page . 
  if you do n't want to become a bitter person like most of trp 's members are , i suggest you stay here in / r/getdisciplined where you learn actual advice that helps you become a better , stronger ( and more attractive ) man in the process . 
  / r/thexeffect is also an excellent community if you wish to improve . 
  it is certainly much easier to brand someone as a sjw or a shill than to engage in a civilized discussion with them by presenting one 's arguments . 
  hey !, 
  i made [ this post ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/thelastairbender/comments/2phytq/meta_feeling_unusually_down_an_open_letter_to_the/ ) a few weeks ago . 
  it 's about how to cope with the series ' finale from a psychologically correct perspective . 
  it was on the front page for a few days and is currently linked in the sidebar thanks to the mods and the overwhelming support it has gotten from the community . 
  i really think you could get something out of it !, 
  your flair certainly complements the gif very well . 
  oh , thanks for making me notice there 's an article as well . 
  the res preview certainly has its drawbacks ... 
  i was n't complaining about the ending , in fact i liked it since it was so tasteful and left on a somewhat ambiguous note . 
  all i was saying was that bryke 's reaction , speciafically the `` hetero-lenses '' comment has somewhat destroyed that ambiguity and taken away some of the after-show mystery and replaced it with a shield against any criticism . 
  comcast - it 's not like you have a choice \u2122, 
  is n't that what this entire thread is all about ? 
  int x = 3 ;, 
  while ( x < 4 ) {, 
  victor frankl certainly had an interesting perspective on the origin of drive . 
  while psychologists from his era believed that drive stems from the desire of power or sex , he believed that motivation stemmed from a desire to find meaning in one 's life . 
  he even developed his own psychotherapeutical method called [ logotherapy ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/logotherapy ) . 
  following his train of thought , finding a purpose in life is essential for happiness . 
  before diving into those waters however , you may want to work on yourself first : getting out of depression takes * a lot * of effort and the last thing you need now is an existential crisis to top it all off . 
  / r/thexeffect and / r/eood are absolutely phenomenal places to start . 
  are you sure that you 're not suicidal ? 
  your description certainly indicates the beginning stages of [ presuicidal syndrome ] ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/996916 ) . 
  maybe talk your thoughts over with your psychiatrist ? 
  not to be nosy or anything , just looking out for you . 
  best of luck !, 
  did n't your parents teach you that less is more ? 
  but ... 
  but ... 
  the money ... 
  it was over $ 1000 at one point , too !, 
  oh well , i know someone who has invested in btc once they were $ 900 and has lost a lot of money because they 're $ 313 as of now . 
  investing in unsafe and volatile sources like penny stocks or cryptocurrency is n't worth it since their patterns are * extremely * unpredictable to the point where it would be wiser to bet on the outcome of a coin toss . 
  [ i mean just look at this nonsense . 
  ] ( https://blockchain.info/charts/market-price?timespan=all ), 
  i 'm just happy i did n't lose any money from joining the bandwagon when the media attention was high . 
   [ ... ] please show me the law or scripture that says it 's ok to murder someone critical of islam . 
  quran ( 8:12 ), 
   `` i will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve . 
  therefore strike off their heads and strike off every fingertip of them '', 
  i 'm not trying to offend anyone on any side of the fence , but since you 're a muslim , i 'm genuinely interested in how you interpret the above . 
  a thorough and interesting reply . 
  i ca n't find any verses in quran that advocate for the killing of non-believers aside from highly contextual passages , so it does indeed seem like you have a strong point . 
  i still have to ask : why is violent extremism so widespread in islam when compared to other religions ? 
  surely , muslim terrorists must have some ( albeit horrendous ) reasons for why they behave the way they do that is at least somewhat grounded within their religion . 
  what is this due to ? 
  to be fair , i followed through on his request and tried to find verses that demanded the explicit killing of disbelievers and i could n't find anything that was n't set in highly unusual circumstances , such as a specific pagan group terrorizing muslims . 
  in other words , i did n't find any clear cut `` commandment '' - type order for killing infidels , which i found very interesting . 
  anyway , too bad that he did not reply to my question . 
  it seems as if he ignored it , at least that can be inferred upon taking a look at his comment history . 
  i just came to the realization that huan is basically tumblr . 
  you can go ahead and let me drown ~ ~ in pussy ~ ~ now ... 
  subtle yet not so subtle . 
  i love it . 
  yeah , probably a good idea to hibernate until the comics . 
  care to elaborate ? 
  [ vladimir putin has visited cuba in july 2014 and written off 90 % of its soviet era debt \\ ( $ 35 billion \\ ) as well as made plans to invest in its offshore oil industry which would greatly boost its economy .
