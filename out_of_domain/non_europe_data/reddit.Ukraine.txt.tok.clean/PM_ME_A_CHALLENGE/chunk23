  i assume you went to the faroe islands to see the eclipse ? 
  i thought they fixed xray a while ago ? 
  yeah , i wonder if mods can look up if someone has a fishy texture pack . 
  how dare you try to defend yourself against a country that threatens you with nuclear war !, 
  came here to see if the reset was intentional or not ... looks like we killed the server . 
  pack it up , folks !, 
  it was so ridiculously well made . 
  i heard that most american film studios `` test '' tv shows on an afghan/arab audience before testing it on a us audience . 
  then again , my source is a friend who is a massive stoner , so it 's most likely wrong . 
  abruptly stopping to take antidepressants can have extremely negative effects on mental health , potentially leading to higher levels of depression than before the use of antidepressants . 
  sources : [ 1 ] ( http://www.webmd.com/depression/guide/withdrawal-from-antidepressants ) [ 2 ] ( http://www.healthline.com/health/depression/dangers-of-stopping-antidepressants ) [ 3 ] ( http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/depression/expert-answers/antidepressant-withdrawal/faq-20058133 ) [ 4 ] ( http://psychcentral.com/lib/ssri-discontinuation-or-withdrawal-syndrome/0005734 ), 
  i do n't deny that it had done the job for you , however i should mention that your case is indeed quite a rare occurrence . 
  ** psa : ** if you have started taking antidepressants and have suddenly started to experience negative symptoms or a worsening of your condition , go to your psychiatrist asap . 
  it is likely that your brain and/or your body is n't tolerating the antidepressant you were prescribed . 
  in that case , your psychiatrist will gauge your symptoms anew and prescribe you a new drug . 
  this is normal : many people have to try several different medications before they find one that works ( [ source ] ( http://www.heretohelp.bc.ca/visions/medications-vol4/myths-about-antidepressants ) ) . 
  just remember that abruptly dropping your medication without medical consultation from a psychiatrist is , in all cases , a terrible idea . 
  albeit the video gives an interesting historical background , i feel like it forgets to mention certain intricacies of the aftermath of the maidan , an event which has caused paradigm shift all over the country , thereby eliminating some of the problems that have been mentioned . 
  my problem is that it did n't address the nation 's feeling towards pro-russian politicians after the maidan revolution . 
  after yanukovich has fled the country ( [ source ] ( http://world.time.com/2014/02/22/ukraines-president-flees-protestors-capture-kiev/ ) ) , there was a very clear shift towards pro-western parties , even in the south-eastern regions that have been outlined in the video . 
  if you look at [ this picture ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ukrainian_parliamentary_election,_2014#/media/file:ukrainian_parliamentary_election,_2014.png ) showing vote results after the parliamentary elections , it is clear that after maidan , the country 's divide started to lessen . 
  it becomes even more apparent when looking at the [ results of the presidential election ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ukrainian_presidential_election,_2014#/media/file:ukrainian_presidential_election_2014_map.png ) , wherein the entire country actually appears to be very much homogenous in its pursuit of pro-western leadership . 
  that being said , i feel like the video stops right at the moment where they should have explained that the divide certainly is n't the same as it was before , which i find somewhat disappointing . 
  it 's a question of risk and reward . 
  while anti-depressants are not * fully * understood and all of the risks of their use are not known , they do an amazing job at combating depression and thereby reducing the mortality rate associated with it . 
  however , the risk/reward ratio with fracking is n't the same . 
  there are multiple risks ( pollution of drinking water and/or earthquakes which would lead to the loss of popularity of the politicians responsible for the lack of fracking regulations ) which make any rewards pale in comparison . 
  i 'll need your help to set up the booth later on in the day , 
  oh lord , why did n't you post this in / r/mcfirenation ... 
  this entire post belongs in our sub . 
  i ca n't believe ne would resort to downvote brigading ... 
   no one gives a flying fuck about your internal fn bullshit . 
  looks like * you * certainly care enough to exhibit such rage . 
  settle down and take a few deep breaths , will you ? 
  added !, 
  ask / u/rampagezgaming ( renjiro ) , i 'm no longer a mod of the sub , 
  ** tl ; dw : ** depression is a disease with not only a psychological , but also a biological ( physiological , neurological , hormonal and genetic ) component . 
  all of the components are explained in depth . 
  in conclusion , just as one ca n't just `` snap out '' of diabetes , one ca n't `` snap out '' of depression . 
  my summary does n't do the lecture * any * justice . 
  it is amazingly informative and entertaining , and i * highly * recommend that you watch it . 
  i 'm not the person you replied to , but i can attest that stalin 's total kill count surpasses that of hitler . 
  sources : [ 1 ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/moslive/article-2091670/hitler-stalin-the-murderous-regimes-world.html ) [ 2 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/joseph_stalin#calculating_the_number_of_victims ) [ 3 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/adolf_hitler#the_holocaust ) . 
  in the context of this article , it is worth mentioning that a large cut of the deaths directly or indirectly caused by stalin were ukrainians who have died in an artificially induced famine in 1932-33 called the [ holodomor ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/holodomor ) , killing between 2.4 and 7.4 million . 
  many countries in the eu and the entirety of north america have recognized it as a genocide . 
  i hope this adds some context to the article and explains the animosity ukrainians have towards communism . 
  glorious . 
  how 's the situation there ? 
  what do you , your peers and the population of kramatorsk think about the ato/russia/the separatists ? 
  it would be interesting to hear the opinion of somebody so close to the conflict . 
  both of my parents are from the western oblasts , so i know very little about the people of donbass . 
  i think a lot of people would be interested in your analysis of the conflict . 
  edit : grammar, 
  thanks a lot . 
  best wishes to you and your family . 
   the first half of the post still stands , though . 
  would n't it be wise to delete the part of your post alleging the site 's nato affiliations , then ? 
  i saw it , i just do n't see a reason for the rest being there . 
  it might confuse some people , perhaps consider at least striking it out using, 
  ~ ~ example ~ ~, 
  to prevent confusion . 
  i am currently circumventing the flashcard issue by closing my eyes and clicking space , then opening my eyes again . 
  that way i have the english word at hand and have to guess the word in italian . 
  it 's cumbersome but it gets the job done . 
  i think it 's too bad that a user ca n't decide which type of exercise they want to complete , it would certainly be beneficial in the learning process . 
  an interesting , albeit poorly manufactured piece of propaganda . 
  see [ that clip at the 2:26 mark ] ( https://youtu.be/42rnhss7wv0?t=2m26s ) ? 
  i remember having seen it . 
  i saw it on the front page of this sub 2 months ago when the dnr attacked kramatorsk . 
  / u/luigrek lives in kramatorsk and posted a compilation of images and videos after the shelling in his post titles '' [ my city has been attacked 30 minutes ago ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/ukrainianconflict/comments/2veo4u/my_city_has_been_attacked_30_minutes_ago/ ) '' . 
  [ ** this is one of the videos in the post ** ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cc9kh-ol4sq ) . 
  it is a video of a woman filming dnr shells hitting the area surrounding her apartment building . 
  as you can see , it is * the same video * . 
  so , in summary , what we have here is a video trying to paint the uaf and ukraine as devils ** whilst using a video clip depicting the shelling of residential areas by the dnr ** . 
  do i even have to mention that the missiles were cluster bombs that were likely fired from a [ tornado ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9a52-4_tornado ) mlrs [ ( osce source ) ] ( http://www.osce.org/ukraine-smm/139836 ) , a missile system that only russia has ? 
  ironically enough , the lyrics during the clip being played are '' [ ukrainian missiles ] falling on our houses '' . 
  ironic that the clip depicted * dnr * missiles falling on * ukrainian * houses . 
  edit : `` i dislike facts that do not support my point of view , thus i shall deny them and downvote this post accordingly '' . 
  kramatorsk was shelled by the dnr on february 10 , 2015 . 
  they used 300mm and cluster ammunition that has either been fired from bm-30 smerch or tornado mrls [ according to the osce ] ( http://www.osce.org/ukraine-smm/139836 ) . 
  this [ video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cc9kh-ol4sq ) filmed by a civilian from her apartment building depicts the shelling of her residential area ( and obviously , the absolute danger that cluster bombs carry to civilians ) . 
  although clearly pro-russian sentiments still exist in the city , this video shows the radical shift towards ukrainian unity . 
  it is very interesting to see a city deep within the donetsk oblast ( which was overwhelmingly pro-russian before the war ) turn so patriotic . 
  i could have never imagined people in the countries ' far east waving upa flags before the war broke out , given that such symbolism seemed to be exclusive to western oblasts . 
  ( edit : i see that some people are upset about the last sentence . 
  i just wanted to highlight that my analysis carries no judgement of the upa itself . 
  i just found it intriguing that people from the far east were sporting symbols usually limited to the far-west . ), 
  it is extremely refreshing to see ukraine , a country which has not too long ago been divided along ethnic , linguistic and ideological lines , be more united than ever . 
   fuck you . 
  i reported your comment on the basis of it containing a personal attack , orion . 
  i do n't see why you would need to insult me . 
  in the interest of having an intelligent discussion , let me elaborate on my point . 
  in no way do i condone mass murder -- i obviously deeply deplore it . 
  my point was that a upa flag is something that you would traditionally only see in the western oblasts . 
  if you re-read my comment , you may notice that i have laid no judgement on the upa itself . 
  as i said , i could have never imagined such a scenario happening in the donetsk oblast before the war , which is why i wanted to share it . 
  this is a misunderstanding . 
  i did n't imply anything . 
  i just noticed that people in the far east were sporting symbolism that was traditionally only seen in the far west which i thought was intriguing given the complete disconnect between the east and the west we saw before the war . 
  i came here to share what i found and to give it a brief analysis and to discuss it , not to insult anyone .
