  you 're right , i should clarify it , thanks . 
   plus they 're banning political opposition parties, 
  slow down there , you 're implying that all of ukraine is banning opposition parties . 
  only one region ( ivano-frankivsk ) seems to have done that , and although the action certainly is against free speech , i believe some context is needed : opposition parties never had the * slightest * foothold in ivano-frankivsk . 
  to give you an idea , [ here is a map showing the proportional distribution of pro-yanukowich votes in the 2010 presidential elections ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/ukraine_presidential_feb_2010_vote_%28yanukovych%29.png ) . 
  i 'm certainly not legitimizing that action , i just believe that this was more of a populist move than something they did because they perceived a real threat from the opposition parties . 
  i 'd love to read more about his issue and especially about the reasoning of the political body responsible for the decision , the problem is that i have n't found any article that did n't quote the interfax article you provided . 
  fact is that kiev and the national government still has very little to do with this decision . 
  according to the article you have provided , the decision was made after a vote in the regional council of ivano-frankivsk which operates largely independently from the national government . 
  still a somewhat worrying event as you have said , but i would n't be surprised if the banned parties appealed the decision at the supreme court and won the case , thereby settling the dispute . 
  then again , they have very little to win in case they get their status as legal political parties back due to the complete lack of support in the region . 
  this issue indeed has far-reaching ramifications that are quite complex in nature , i hope to hear more about it in the media . 
  i honestly think that the quality of simon 's dispatches slowly wavered with the last few episodes . 
  i feel like instead of asking questions , he tries to steer the conversation and the narrative in a way that reflects his own opinion of the situation more than that of the people involved . 
  look at the intro : it 's 95 % simon accusing the ambassador of something under the veil of a question followed by the ambassador giving a three-word reply before the vice logo cuts the clip . 
  i really like the russian roulette series for simon 's will to go where no other reporter wants to go and to interview people nobody dares to interview , but i 'd personally appreciate if instead of asking loaded questions he remained as unbiased as possible , as it was with most dispatches before the last three .

  grandson : grandfather , hello !, 
  happy holiday , gramps . 
  how are you , how are you preparing yourself ? 
  gramps : thanks , grandson . 
  good , what ever i can remember . 
  grandson : i ironed my uniform , my medals are with me ... 
  grandson : hey grandfather , i wanted to tell you something ... 
  ( camera points to missing medal of honor ( i think ! ), 
  on grandfathers uniform ), 
  gramps : i know . 
  where do you keep it ? 
  grandson : in my left pocket . 
  under my heart . 
  gramps : did you put on your headgear ? 
  grandson : i did . 
  happy day of victory . 
  gramps : glory to ukraine . 
  narrator : we remember . 
  we 're proud . 
  grandma : yes , i 'm listening ? 
  granddaughter : hello grandma !, 
  i wanted to congratulate you with the holiday . 
  grandma : you did n't call for 3 months , only now did you remember your grandma . 
  granddaughter : grandma , i just wanted to say ... 
  thanks for what you did . 
  i 'm very proud of you . 
  grandma : and i 'm proud of you . 
  granddaughter : happy victory day . 
  grandma : glory to the heroes !, 
  `` k\u00e4se '' is masculine ( * der * k\u00e4se ) , which is why you refer to it using a third-person singular masculine personal pronoun in german ( which would be `` er '' ) . 
  `` the cheese is good , even though * it * is old '' would be the translation that makes the most sense , but i guess duolingo also wants you to familiarize with the grammar of the language you 're trying to learn , which is why gems like these pop up occasionally . 
  i know , i just translated it into headgear because i 'm fairly positive that he meant his combat helmet and asked as a sign of worry and care to make sure that his grandson is well protected . 
  if he is indeed referring to the helmet ( which his grandson is putting on in the next scene ) , translating it into ` hat ' would make little contextual sense for people who do n't speak ukrainian or russian . 
  what do you think ? 
  ** `` the famine of 1932 -- 33 '' , encyclop\u00e6dia britannica . 
   `` the great famine ( holodomor ) of 1932 -- 33 -- a man-made demographic catastrophe unprecedented in peacetime . 
  of the estimated six to eight million people who died in the soviet union , about four to five million were ukrainians ... its deliberate nature is underscored by the fact that no physical basis for famine existed in ukraine ... soviet authorities set requisition quotas for ukraine at an impossibly high level . 
  brigades of special agents were dispatched to ukraine to assist in procurement , and homes were routinely searched and foodstuffs confiscated ... 
  the rural population was left with insufficient food to feed itself . '', 
  ** naimark , norman ( professor at stanford university ) . 
  * stalin 's genocides ( human rights and crimes against humanity ) * . 
  princeton university press , 2010 . 
   `` there is enough evidence - if not overwhelming evidence - to indicate that stalin and his lieutenants knew that the widespread famine in the ussr in 1932-33 hit ukraine particularly hard , and that they were ready to see millions of ukrainian peasants die as a result . 
  they made no efforts to provide relief ; they prevented the peasants from seeking food themselves in the cities or elsewhere in the ussr ; and they refused to relax restrictions on grain deliveries,

  * journal of genocide research , 1999 . 
   political usage should not override scholarly logic , especially political usage which is just being established in independent ukraine , arguably seven years late . 
  my argument , however , is that both logic and political usage in ukraine point in one direction , that of the terror-famine being genocidal . 
  stalin hated the ukrainians , as accepted as a fact by sakharov , revealed in the telegram to zatonsky and inferred from his polemics with the yugoslav communist semich . 
  stalin decided to collectivize soviet agriculture and under the cover of collectivization teach the ukrainians a bloody lesson . 
  had it not been for stalinist hubris and the incorporation of the more nationalistically minded and less physically decimated western ukrainians after 1939 , the ukrainian nation might have never recovered from the stalinist offensive against the main army of the ukrainian national movement , the peasants .

   this specifically anti-ukrainian assault makes it possible to define the totality of intentional political actions taken from late summer 1932 by the stalinist regime against the ukrainian peasantry as genocide . 
  with hunger as its deadly arm , the regime sought to punish and terrorize the peasants , resulting in fatalities exceeding four million people in ukraine and the northern caucasus .

  please tell me , were they volunteers or were they just on vacation ? 
  i 'm confused as to lukashenko 's true geopolitical tendency . 
  he seems to be yo-yoing between the eu and russia . 
  i followed this thread all the way down here . 
  to my disappointment , instead of finding hard sources for your claims ( which would have indeed enabled a debate on the topic ) , you have continued to attempt to defend the texts * you were so proud of having found in two minutes * whilst claiming that your conversational partner is `` side stepping the actual argument in question '' . 
  to the contrary , he fortified his position on the issue by using hard sources whilst you have shown nothing but texts * which are dubious by your own standards * you did n't event bother sourcing whilst trying to defend their legitimacy . 
  as soon as your conversational partner showed that there is little to no merit to the citations in the undergraduate sources you have provided ( or that he pointed out they were behind a paywall ) , you `` got tired '' of him . 
  why wo n't you finally give us credible sources to support your point so we can have something to work with ?

  i think `` street pharmacy investor '' is a more fitting term to describe them . 
  i thought of the same thing , too bad it would result in a disqualification for breaking the rules of the contest . 
  this is my own translation .
