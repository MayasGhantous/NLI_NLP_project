  i took the time to create it due to this being pretty important diplomatic news . 
  it clearly indicates the worsening of german-russian relations caused by russia 's annexation of crimea and its participation in the war in donbass . 
  the source , the [ frankfurter allgemeine zeitung ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/frankfurter_allgemeine_zeitung ) , is completely reputable . 
  that being said , i hope you enjoy my translation , please message me if you find a mistake !, 
   ** merkel calls the annexation of crimea \u201e criminal `` **, 
   on the day of the big military parade in moscow , angela merkel and vladimir putin commemorated the victims of the world war ii at the tomb of the unknown soldier . 
  at the end , the chancellor was n't shy to make herself clear about her position in regards to the ukrainian conflict and the annexation of crimea . 
   chancellor angela merkel and the russian president vladimir putin commemorated the victims of world war ii together . 
  they put chaplets on the tomb of the unknown soldier on the wall of the kremlin . 
  afterwards , merkel said that she bows \u201e before the millions of victims that the war , provoked by nazi germany , has caused `` . 
   \u201e the fact remains that the peoples of the soviet union , the soldiers of the red army , had the highest number of casualties . `` hinting at the ukrainian conflict , she added that \u201e these bitter experiences of history are a lesson that shows that difficult situations , such as the present one , can only be solved by diplomatic means `` . 
  she states that according to the organization for security and cooperation in europe ( osce ) , there are \u201e many , many violations coming from the separatist side `` of the ceasefire agreed upon in minsk . 
  she added that she thinks that \u201e the russian president has an influence on the separatists `` . 
   putin showed approval regarding the chancellor 's words pertaining to the victims of the german war against the soviet union . 
  he also said that there were \u201e much worse times `` than the current ones . 
  he mentioned the current economic cooperation between germany and russia and promised that he will do \u201e everything `` in russia 's power to appease the conflict . 
   merkel said that she had hoped for a ceasefire after the signing of the minsk protocol in february . 
  however , she commented that it \u201e had never taken effect `` . 
  the chancellor especially mentioned the seizure of debaltsevo . 
  she appealed to \u201e those , who are in charge of donetsk and luhansk `` to allow kiev 's humanitarian aid to enter their territory in order to better the humanitarian situation of the population . 
   ** commenting about the beginning of the crisis , merkel said that german-russian relations have \u201e suffered greatly from the criminal annexation of crimea which was is illegal in the eyes of international law , as well as from the conflict in eastern ukraine `` . 
  this was the first time merkel has judged the annexation of crimea as \u201e criminal `` . 
  observers believe that there is a link between said judgement and merkel 's previous comments about the crimes of nazi germany . 
   merkel wanted to commemorate the victims of the war , however , as other western heads of states , she has decided not to participate in saturday 's big military parade in which russia wanted to celebrate their victory in world war ii , which was 70 years ago . 
  on sunday , great britain has also commemorated the end of the war . 
  queen elizabeth ii , her husband prince philip , heir to the throne prince charles , his wife camilia as well as war veterans entered the westminster abbey to attend the church service . 
  thereupon , there was a parade in london . 
  i do n't know about cargo transportation , but banning passports from a self-proclaimed `` republic '' that not * one * other country on the face of this planet recognizes should n't be surprising . 
  translation of the ukrainian bit at the end :, 
   and that 's exactly what 's going to happen to every terrorist who will lay a foot on our land . 
  ** tl ; dr : parent comment not only completely misquoted/mistranslated hromadske 's financial report but has also left out a few important numbers that contradict the point they were trying to make . 
  ** ( i wonder why ? ), 
  the ukrainian bit you have quoted does not match the english text below it . 
  assuming you mixed it up ( which seems likely since the numbers do n't add up * at all * ) , here is a correct translation ( i have also converted the amount of money from hryvna to usd . 
  back in q3 2014 , [ 1 usd \u2248 13.5 uah ] ( http://www.xe.com/de/currencycharts/?from=usd&amp;to=uah&amp;view=1y ) ) :, 
   assistance of donors - canadian ministry of foreign affairs , trade and development ( via internews network ) : ** 1 248 465 uah ( about 92k usd ) ** - ** embassy of the kingdom of the netherlands to ukraine : 1 191 288 uah ( about 88k usd ) **, 
  according to the report , the ** us embassy has donated a grand total of 287 898 uah ( about 21k usd ) ** . 
  more than four times less than the netherlands . 
  also , [ here is a link to the financial report from q3 2014 ] ( http://www.hromadske.tv/files/b/4/b4201bc-1-2q-2014-fin-report---eng.pdf ) . 
  it 's in ukrainian ( the english version is unavailable ) . 
  it 's the most recent one and the one that i have used here . 
  why canada supports ukraine is rather easy to explain . 
  first off , relations have worsened since around 2010 due to [ tensions between canada and russia regarding territorial claims in the arctic ] ( http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/canada-russia-arctic-tensions-rise-1.886610 ) . 
  also , canada has a comparatively large ukrainian community . 
  ukrainian canadians are largely united on the issue of the ukrainian conflict and are thus able to exert political pressure on the canadian government . 
  the netherlands are obviously interested in supporting ukrainian media due to the separatists shooting mh17 down , creating large tensions between the netherlands and the russian federation . 
  the us certainly has an interest in helping ukraine , although the help of the us government is too little in the eyes of ukrainians . 
  it 's funny how russian media ( and you too ! ), 
  tries to spin it that the us is ridiculously heavily involved in the donbass war when all ukraine has gotten from the us are a hundred soldiers teaching ukrainian soldiers , a few outdated humvees and a whopping 21k donation to hromadske.tv . 
  not to say that it does n't help the ukrainian military ( it certainly does !, 
  ) , but it is * far * less than the other side makes it seem . 
  also , a few things that you conveniently have n't mentioned from the report :, 
  * total cash flow : 8 116 102 uah ( about 600k usd ), 
  * ** donations from the public : 2 133 774 ( about 150k usd ) **, 
  for reference :, 
  * canadian ministry of foreign affairs , trade and development : 1 248 465 uah ( about 92k usd ), 
  * embassy of the kingdom of the netherlands to ukraine : 1 191 288 uah ( about 88k usd ), 
  * embassy of the united states of america : 287 898 uah ( about 21k usd ), 
  in relation :, 
  * ** national fundraising campaign in ukraine : 1 119 046 uah ( about 83k usd ) **, 
  * ** sum of all ukrainian ngos abroad ( ukrainian european congress , etc. ), 
  through the `` ukrainian world foundation '' : 773 301 uah ( about 57k usd ) **, 
  * norwegian freedom of press organization ( fritt ord ) : 396 180 uah ( about 30k usd ), 
  * ** ukrainian international ngo `` rebirth '' : 73 081 uah ( about 5.4 k usd ) **, 
  grand total of cash flow brought in by the ukrainian public and ( inter ) national ukrainian organizations : 4 099 202 uah ( 304k usd ) , i.e. 
  ** 50.5 % of the total cash flow . 
  if you look at the report , most donations have been made by the ukrainian public or by ukrainian organizations , not any one nation that puppeteers hromadske.tv . 
  so indeed , i 'm sure that no matter how hard you cherry-pick numbers and try to spin it , hromadske certainly fits the criteria for an independent news network . 
  what a nice loaded question you got there . 
  interesting , although i have reasons to believe that the netherlands ' support of hromadske largely stems from mh17 . 
  when looking at the financial report from q2 2014 ( [ english link ] ( http://www.hromadske.tv/files/b/4/b4201bc-1-2q-2014-fin-report---eng.pdf ) ) , you can see that the netherlands is n't even listed as a donor . 
  in q3 2014 , the netherlands went from 0 to 1,191,288 uah . 
  [ here 's the financial report in ukrainian ] ( http://www.hromadske.tv/files/9/1/9182bcf-1-3q-2014-fin-report---ukr.pdf ) ( english one unavailable ) . 
  the donor is listed as * \u041f\u043e\u0441\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u041a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043b\u0456\u0432\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430 \u041d\u0456\u0434\u0435\u0440\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0456\u0432 \u0432 \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0456 * ( embassy of the kingdom of the netherlands in ukraine ) , so it 's not a donation made by an ngo . 
  considering that mh17 was shot down on july 17 , 2014 ( beginning of q3 ) , i think a link between the airliner tragedy and the sudden donation to a ukrainian independent investigative journalism company by the netherlands is apparent . 
  it 's unlikely that there were any nuclear weapons in in the donbass region since the ussr put most of the stockpile in the west and central parts of ukraine , so a retaliatory strike against the west could go underway as fast as possible ( although i do n't have any sources for that , this is just speculation ) . 
  it 's a good question , and not very easy to answer . 
  i believe that first and foremost if the ukrainian military had a better command and better organization , the nuclear weapons * may * have likely had acted as a deterrent . 
  it 's unfortunate , not only for those who are victims of russian aggression but also for the russians themselves . 
  it will be difficult to form economic and defense treaties with russia when the state has been lying trough its teeth for the last ten years . 
  i also noticed that it was almost never really quoted in full over here , which is why i posted it . 
  [ poroshenko himself ] ( http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/economic/239730.html ) stated that that he did n't wish for ukraine to become a nuclear state again , and at this point it 's unlikely that any of the parties from the memorandum will do so . 
  at the end of the day , ukraine can only look to implement enough reforms as to make its own military more capable as well as expanding its defense budget and subsidizing the local defense industry . 
  ukraine also had a rather weak leadership back then . 
  maybe large sums of money were also involved , although clearly the decision to get ukraine to sign the agreement stems from the fact that post-sovet chaos would n't mix well with thousands of nuclear warheads . 
  you 're probably right about the part on forcing ukraine to give up its stockpile , but i do n't understand the comparison with north korea -- there are plenty of states in europe with nuclear weapons , namely : the uk , france , belgium , the netherlands , germany and italy . 
  it most certainly is not just silly -- ukraine gave up the world third largest nuclear stockpile over this . 
  the ramifications of the memorandum are too great to equate it to a post-it-note . 
  reminds me of [ this video ] ( https://youtu.be/yjd1iwy5luy?t=45s ) ( tangentially relevant ) . 
  hilarious and and accurate . 
  although the thing that caught my eye the most was that the '' \u044b '' ( it 's one letter , sort of pronounced like the `` i '' in `` six '' ) from '' \u041a\u0440\u044b\u043c \u043d\u0430\u0448 '' in the last panel is inverted :p, 
  i would n't say t ukraine had no say in this -- could you back that claim up ? 
   millions of russian citizens, 
  i can not find any source confirming that . 
  furthermore highly unlikely , as dual citizenship is forbidden in ukraine as per the constitution . 
  the only way to become a dual citizen in ukraine is to be born with a ukrainian passport and then to naturalize in another country that allows dual citizenship , hoping that the ukrainian authorities wo n't find out about any of this . 
  very , very few people do this ( certainly not millions ) and most certainly , those who do are n't all russians . 
  there are n't `` millions of russian citizens '' in ukraine . 
   internment in special camps of foreign nationals residing in ukraine ** who pose a threat to its security . 
  under normal circumstances , such citizens would be sent to prison .
