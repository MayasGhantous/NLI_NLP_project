  since neither the article nor the rada defined what the difference between a prison and an internment camp is , the only basis of this article is the fact that `` internement camp '' sounds scarier than `` prison '' . 
   the bill applies to `` citizens of a foreign state who threaten with an attack and carry out aggression against ukraine , '' an explanatory note to the document said . 
  the russian federation is covered by this definition . 
  no , the russian federation is very , very clearly * not * covered by this definition . 
  the definition only covers * individuals * who pose a security threat and * most certainly not * entire countries . 
  this article is n't worth anything . 
  all it does is attempt to stir fear amongst the russian population , as if ukraine posed a threat to russia . 
  the article does n't even attempt to conceal its agenda . 
  but i 'm not sure what i expected -- after all sputnik news is [ wholly owned and operated by the russian government ] ( http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2013/12/9/putin-dissolves-rianovostinewsagency.html ) . 
   and why are all the pro-ukrainian power users so silent right now ? 
  [ are you sure about that ? 
  ] ( http://np.reddit.com/r/russia/comments/35w24l/poroshenko_greenlights_bill_allowing_russians_to/cr8r9z2 ), 
  interesting , what 's the source ? 
  no , i understand that , i 'm talking about the part where you claim that ukraine had no real say in the matter . 
  i 'm pretty sure they also had enough mrbms ( 1000-3000km range ) to bomb europe as a retaliatory or second strike in case of an attack , though . 
  then again , certainly ukraine never posed a real threat to moscow , for ukraine would have been razed if it attacked russia using those . 
  the nuclear weapons would have probably acted as a deterrent regarding the present conflict , however . 
  indeed , but ukraine did n't * have * to ratify the treaty ( like india for example ) or could have just become a recognized nuclear weapon state ratifier ( like russia ) with the dissolution of the soviet union . 
  nobody * forced * ukraine to ratify the treaty , that 's basically my point . 
  care to expand ? 
  holy shit , that is intense . 
  any updates on the soldier who got a concussion or whatnot ? 
  [ fish reminds me of this guy . 
  why thank you for sharing , fellow `` redditard '' -- i have read that before posting , however . 
  care to touch on any part of my comment that you find disagreeable , now ? 
   he was using the word `` patzhaniu '' when describing people on the tank , gave me the impression it might be a ua tank . 
  where 's the connection ? 
  `` pazani '' ( guys , folks ) is a word in both ukrainian and russian . 
  ** translation **, 
  ^ ( ( i 've taken some freedom in translating as it would be difficult for non-natives to understand some of the russian slurs . 
  i 've accommodated the translation in that regard , but it 's safe to say that below is what the separatist would have said if the conversation were in english ) ^ ), 
  shit , for fuck 's sake our guys were sitting on it . 
  our guys were fucking sitting on top of it . 
  fucking shit , one of them fell the fuck down . 
  and ... and ... 
  there were two sitting on it , fuck . 
  his comrade replies :, 
   come on , go and help !, 
  i 'm unsure about the necessity of such action as we have seen countless foreign fighters in ukraine 's volunteer battalions . 
  i do think that this opens the ukrainian army to certain risks , however , including saboteurs and spies . 
  zakharchenko most certainly is n't the brightest person in the donbass . 
  what he refers to as `` dnr '' fits neither the definition of `` independent '' nor that of `` republic '' . 
  indeed , you 're right . 
  so , if i understand correctly , independence is * always * superior to unity , according to you ? 
  this all seems like speculation , and i 'm glad that you have made that clear by prefacing your comment with `` i also believe '' . 
  i 'm having trouble figuring out why the conclusion to your alarm bells metaphor is `` eventually you will be left with that which can not be removed - your true self '' . 
  also , what do you mean by `` once you understand your true self '' ? 
  it all seems very vague and not like something that would fit in the context of a scientific discussion on the topic of mental health and in the general framework of finding ways to alleviate or eliminate the symptoms of depression , please take no offense . 
  i honestly do n't know enough about what the balance between scotland and the rest of the union members look like . 
  either way , the scottish people have had a referendum on the topic and decided to stay in the uk , which is why i 'm not sure about the practical value of discussing this topic anymore . 
  at this point , i 'm interested in how scottish separatism will evolve if the uk votes on exiting the european union . 
  what bad has the eu done to greece , though ? 
  i 'm sorry , i 'm not very informed , the media here is rather one-sided in reporting how much money the eu gave to greece without prospect of getting it back . 
  thanks !, 
  it certainly does seem strange , after all i could n't imagine germany forcefully giving greece a loan -- are there some problems amongst the political leadership and/or corruption that have facilitated such action ? 
  i 'll do my own research as well , thanks for taking the time to answer . 
  this , combined with the fact that russian war journalist have entered luhansk a few days ago makes me think that the near future of the region is rather bleak . 
  if the * minister of internal affairs * is largely incapable of speaking the * only official language * of the country which he is governing , there is a problem . 
  very well -- but i did n't say that * russian speakers * were a problem , i was saying that * russian speakers who are unable to speak ukrainian * are a problem in governmental positions . 
  this is obvious , since all laws are exclusively published in ukrainian ( as per the constitution ) -- and when your profession demands that you draft and/or seek the implementation of laws with an extreme degree of responsibility , there is * no way * you should be allowed to fill that position if you ca n't * understand * the language in which the documents you are working with are written . 
  indeed , they should not . 
  copypaste from another comment of mine in this thread :, 
   all laws are exclusively published in ukrainian ( as per the constitution ) -- and when your profession demands that you draft and/or seek the implementation of laws with an extreme degree of responsibility , there is no way you should be allowed to fill that position if you ca n't understand the language in which the documents you are working with are written . 
  furthermore , i should note that learning the ukrainian language is mandatory is all schools throughout ukraine , which contradicts your previous statement :, 
   russian speaker [ s ] who [ are ] not speaking ukrainian ( and there are a lot of those ), 
  `` and you , they will sweep you out of the donbass like dirt . 
  like dirt , dirt !, 
  you 're dirt . 
  you 're not humans , you are dirt . 
  assholes , assholes ... !, 
  and dir - '', 
  `` and you were kissing american asses , yeah !, 
  black american asses . 
  lick them , continue licking . 
  tastes good , right ? 
  tastes good , huh ? '', 
  what an intelligent gentleman . 
  i apologize for the misunderstanding , when i said `` published '' i did n't refer to the law being printed and being made available in regional minority languages ( in which case the document you have cited applies ) ; i was talking about the process of law adoption by the national parliament which then `` publishes '' the law in question . 
  i should have used a better wording , but my point still stands : the law is originally debated and made available in ukrainian : official translations only apply to regions where there is a linguistic minority of  10 % , not the parliament however ( [ 1 ] ( http://www.kyivpost.com/content/politics/lytvyn-program-for-development-of-ukrainian-language-should-be-adopted-before-elections-312012.html ) , [ 2 ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/04/ukrainians-protest-russian-language-law ) ) . 
  i 'm afraid my russian vocabulary is n't good enough for that , i just understood what the communist was saying because he spoke loudly and in short sentences . 
  from what i can loosely understand , before his `` dirt '' - reply , the other guy repeated `` get out , get out '' . 
  after that , the other guy said something along the lines of `` did you want to get a rifle '' or so , but as i said , this is where my russian fails . 
  maybe another russian speaker on this sub can help you with that !, 
  indeed , it 's a controversial issue that dates back to the mid-1800s , when the internal minister of the russian empire declared that the publication of school - and university books as well as bibles in ukrainian was illegal . 
  the ukrainian language and culture continued to be suppressed during the soviet times ( especially during stalin 's reign ) , to the point where e.g. 
  all universities were forced to hold lectures in russian , dissertations had to be written in russian , etc. 
  regarding the suppression in the past , many feel like the ukrainian language and culture suffers from existential threats coming from russia under the veil of invalid claims that ukrainians and russians are `` basically '' the same people with `` more or less '' the same language and culture , or through claims that the russian speaking minority is being persecuted and/or otherwise oppressed . 
  to counter this threat , ukraine has adopted ukrainian as the sole official language of the nation . 
  many fear that problems could cascade if russian is adopted as a second official language . 
  a possible scenario :, 
  russian is adopted as a second language . 
  - a debate arrises on which languages should be taught in schools . 
  - the predominantly anti-russian central and western regions oppose the mandatory teaching of both languages . 
  - the eastern and southern regions , predominantly composed of russian native speakers , in turn decide to * only * teach russian in schools , leading to an expansion of the russian sphere of influence . 
  another possible scenario :, 
  russian is adopted as a second language . 
  - a debate arrises on which languages should be taught in schools . 
  - in order to counteract the last scenario , it is agreed that both languages will be taught in schools all over the nation . 
  - the central and western regions , who have the lowest number of russian speakers in ukraine , will over time see an increase in people who can speak and understand russian . 
  these people will then have access to russian media , leading to an expansion of russian influence .
