  psychologists do not require a medical degree . 
  to become a practicing psychologist in ontario , you require at least a ma , a msc , a phd or a psyd , plus 3 years of relevant experience if i recall correctly . 
  concerning the point of your parent comment regarding unemployability , a ba or bsc in psychology does n't grant you the right to practice in the field of psychology : graduate school is a requirement . 
  your first point is entirely based an assumption . 
  are first year students who enter at the age of 19 ( or higher ) so rare that you can draw a conclusion from it ? 
  your second point is unconvincing as well . 
  if you truly want to think logically instead of emotionally , then take a look at the statistics instead of basing your argument on the fear of a `` what if ? '', 
  scenario : 80 % to 90 % of people that seek treatment for depression are treated successfully using therapy and/or medication ( taps study , [ source ] ( http://www.save.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=home.viewpage&amp;page_id=705d5df4-055b-f1ec-3f66462866fcb4e6 ) ) . 
  instead of directing him towards help , the res kicked him out to avoid dealing with the problem altogether . 
  all it takes is to look at the numbers to see that * that * was n't a logical decision , but likely one motivated by fear . 
  i certainly agree with you that the university should recommend that it would be wise that he take a year off from university and undergo both psychological and psychiatric treatment -- going through the stress of university certainly is suboptimal at this stage of his mental health . 
  however , i firmly disagree with you on that the decision of the res is either logical or otherwise justifiable . 
  the decision was certainly motivated by fear of the unknown , and is thereby utterly unconvincing . 
  all it does is give grounds to the feelings of depressed students who are afraid of seeking help for their mental health problems , who are then going to keep their thoughts to themselves , potentially aggravating the situation they presently find themselves in . 
  it 's clearly a traditional hand-warming ritual . 
  i do highly suspect that the universities ' decision was motivated by the suicide attempt , not by the alcohol . 
  the reason i believe that is the following quote from the article :, 
   rodriguez said after he was released from hospital he received a phone call from the dean of students and residence at innis college , tim worgan . 
  he said he was asked to leave residence , and told he could return in the winter semester with the recommendation of a psychiatrist . 
  you are correct , the statistic that i have chosen does not reflect the risk of suicide amongst people who have already attempted suicide , and unfortunately i ca n't find any statistics analyzing this phenomenon . 
  nevertheless , depression is the biggest predictor of suicidality , which is why i found the statistic to be noteworthy . 
  after his attempt , he was likely put on suicide watch and introduced to antidepressant medication which completely suppresses any suicidal urges and opens the path to recovery . 
   what , they 're going to be worried that if they try to kill themselves then they wo n't have dorm rooms to go back to ? 
  yeah , pretty sure there 's a major flaw in that argument . 
  suicidal people do n't care about dorm rooms . 
  they do n't care about themselves , their surroundings or anything else for that matter . 
  they do n't intend to live in the dorm rooms , * they want to die . 
  * if you have ever spoken to a suicidal person , you may notice that the novice argument `` think about your parents and your friends ! '', 
  does n't work * at all * and only aggravates the situation . 
  the only way for a suicidal individual to attain better mental health and to eliminate the risk of suicide is through psychologists and psychiatrists , not by scaring them into thinking that they wo n't have a dorm to go back to if their attempt was unsuccessful . 
  perhaps that may only lead them to attempt more drastic methods to avoid comping with the aftermath of a failed attempt . 
  i also have a personal story to share . 
  in 12th grade , a classmate ended his own life . 
  finding out about it was probably the worst thing that happened in that year . 
  teachers and classmates were crying . 
  i had to comfort my biology teacher to prevent her from melting down , as she was very close to him . 
  his best friend actually had cried so much that the skin under his eyes got scabby . 
  luckily , the school gave us plenty of opportunities to deal with the situation . 
  we held groups in which we expressed our thoughts and feelings , we had psychologists readily available at all hours of the day for about a month , and we all went to his funeral ( i should probably mention that this was n't in canada , i wonder how your school system would have managed it ) . 
  he 's gone -- and nothing can change that . 
  but after about a month , everything went back to normal , more or less . 
  thanks to our schools ability to incorporate us into the problem , there was very little damage caused by the incident to our community . 
  that made me realize the importance of a sound mental health policy , and the cultivation of a sense of solidarity amongst classmates . 
  i see it as any institution 's responsibility to help and to empower people who are suffering from depression , * especially * if they have a history of suicide attempts , whether we 're talking about a high school , a university or a workplace . 
  indeed , i believe that this is an instant where the needs of the individual outweigh the needs of the many : after all , we 're talking about life and death of the individual . 
  we should all contribute to the mental wellbeing of others to prevent scenarios like this from happening in the first place . 
  i 'm sorry if this seems too much like a rant -- i 'm just ashamed at the university for , instead of holding on to the principles of empathy and solidarity , decided to forgo dealing with the problem at all . 
  i find it strange that you did n't add the ~ ~ 2015 ~ ~ 2014 presidential elections . 
  i 'm assuming that the maps were supposed to show that ukraine is a politically divided country . 
  [ well , not anymore . 
  here 's a map of the 2014 elections . ], 
  ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/92/ukrainian_presidential_election_2014_map.png ), 
  ^ ( light gray : voted for poroshenko . ), 
  ^ ( blue : voted for the pro-russian opposition candidate ( dobkin ) ^ ), 
  ^ ( dark gray : elections could n't be held ( ato ) ^ ), 
  as you can see , ukraine got more pro-west with time . 
  the ~ ~ 2015 ~ ~ 2014 elections show very clearly that post-maidan ukraine got fed up with pro-russian parties , and became more unified than ever as far as the political landscape is concerned . 
  edit : 2014 , not 2015, 
  thanks , i fixed it !, 
  fear us !, 
  we will drown the rest of europe in [ borsht ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/borscht ) once the war in our country is over , just wait ... 
  haha , i know that we have previously disagreed on ... well , basically everything , but it 's nice see that you have a sense of humor . 
  never had any other borsht than ukrainian borsht , i 'm afraid i ca n't compare !, 
  edit : typo, 
  please , take your propaganda elsewhere . 
  neither azov nor svoboda are `` kind of a big part '' of ukraine . 
  the svoboda candidate got a grand total of [ 1.16 % ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ukrainian_presidential_election,_2014 ) of the popular vote during the presidential elections of 2014 . 
  currently , [ not a single minister ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/government_of_ukraine#cabinet ) is from svoboda . 
  the [ previous government ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/first_yatsenyuk_government ) which was established right after yanukovich 's flight was dissolved after nine months , following the leave of udar and svoboda from the coalition . 
  the three svoboda ministers were : the minister of defense ( together with three independent ministers ) , the minister of agriculture , and the minister of ecology . 
  not exactly positions in which you can enforce a far-right policy , except for the minister of defense , who in the end decided not to do anything when russia invaded crimea , and did n't participate in any decision making after that . 
  i despise it when the other side blows the roles of svoboda and the right sector completely out of proportion , * as if * they have any popular and political foothold in ukraine , which simply is n't true . 
   ukrainian troops are the only people who remain in this abandoned tourist resort inside ukraine near ** separatist held mariupol **, 
  what the hell , euronews ? 
  i 'm afraid that nato being comprised of nazis is indeed a lie , and not a point of view . 
  what a civilized bunch . 
  a lot of africans used to enroll in medical school in donetsk , as the courses were held in either russian or english . 
  since the insurgency , most of them have transferred to ivano-frankivsk . 
  i wonder if he 's one of those who stayed . 
  ah , finally a ukrainian video that i can translate . 
   filaret ( head of the ukrainian orthodox church ) : today , we open this wall of remembrance , on the grounds of st. michael 's monastery . 
  everyone , who walks past this wall , shall remember : [ these soldiers ] have laid down their life for our freedom . 
  pray for them . 
   woman : i really do n't want this to have all been in vain ... 
  the country is at war , but many feel like it 's not their way ; it 's our war . 
  this war is for our country to become - * ( audio cuts off ) *, 
  swoboda had 37 seats in the parliament after the parliament after the parliamentary election of 2012 ( and not 38 as you claimed ) . 
  that is , 37 out of 450 seats , or roughly 9 % . 
  saying that `` swoboda had 38 seats '' is misleading due to the lack of statistical context . 
  why did n't you mention that ? 
   the nation that lived under his rule despises him . 
  why so ? 
  i tried looking up his approval ratings , all i could find was a [ poll ] ( http://vestnikkavkaza.net/news/society/7246.html ) that stated that in 2010 , 67 % of the georgian population supported his policies . 
  russia is beating a dead horse . 
  remarkably few people outside of russia 's borders believe the russian narrative that the mh17 downing was some sort of ukrainian conspiracy . 
  to the contrary , such `` experiments '' only make the initial `` expert '' claims that a su-25 downed it , as well as the [ fact that the russian ministry of defense faked satellite imagery ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/mh17-wie-russland-satellitenfotos-faelschte-a-1036489.html ) seem more and more ridiculous . 
  could you find a source confirming that his bodyguards have raped people in prison ? 
  from what i have read up on the [ gldani prison scandal ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gldani_prison_scandal ) , the minister of correction was forced to resign after the video footage was leaked . 
  there was no mention of saakashvili 's bodyguards . 
  likewise , how exactly did political oppression and corruption increase ?
