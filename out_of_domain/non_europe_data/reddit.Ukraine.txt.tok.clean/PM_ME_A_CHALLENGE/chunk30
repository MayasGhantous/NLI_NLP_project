  it includes the beginning of an exclusive interview with yevgeny yerofeyev , the captured gru captain .

   ** narrator : ** colonel oleh kosminych is a war hero in ukraine . 
  he was held captive by the separatists for months , where he was beaten and almost lynched . 
  ever since he became free again , people are engaging in conversations with the officer on the streets . 
   ** woman ( to kosminych ) : ** we have followed the news and were very worried about you . 
  we thank you for your courage and could n't just pass by you without saying something . 
   ** col. kosminych ( replying to the woman ) : ** but i 'm not the only one who fought in the donbass . 
  there are enough comrades who are severely wounded without arms or legs and lay in the hospitals until now , but nobody thinks about them . 
   ** narrator : ** the way the pro-russian separatists treat ukrainian pows is well documented , as this case shows . 
  kosminych 's squad fell in the hands of one of the most notorious separatist leaders . 
  * ( nb : the footage shown is the infamous [ video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fd15bxm3mtc ) of givi mistreating ukrainian servicemen who have been captured near the donetsk airport . 
  it turns out that it was indeed kosminych 's squad which was captured . 
   ** givi ( in the clip ) : ** on your knees !, 
  face me !, 
  do you know who i am ? 
   ** col. kosminych ( in the clip ) : ** givi . 
   ** givi ( in the clip ) : ** look in my eyes , asshole !, 
  where are you from ? 
  i promise , i 'll come to your home with my entire artillery and all of my tanks . 
  i 'll shoot everything there . 
  do you understand ? 
  you will see what hell feels like . 
  hell , i say !, 
   ** narrator : ** a few days later , oleh was almost lynched . 
  footage of that exists , too . 
  he has not spoken to journalists after his release , yet . 
  he decided to talk to spiegel.tv exclusively . 
   ** col. kosminych : ** i would n't say that i had a personal problem with this givi , or that i promised him a vendetta . 
  however , if he does decide to `` come over here '' , as he once said , i am waiting patiently . 
  we all are . 
  and one more thing : if i ever meet him somewhere , i will do my very best at putting him in the same position that i once found myself in . 
   ** narrator : ** fights in eastern ukraine have been going on for more than a year now . 
  russia backed separatists have conquered a territory that is about as big as schleswig-holstein ( * nb : [ a region in germany ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/schleswig-holstein ) * ) . 
  * ( footage of dnr infantry firing from their position in the donetsk airport . 
  nb : shots are flying everywhere . 
   ** narrator : ** in this clip , you can see a combat operation on the separatist side . 
  colonel kosminych was in a similar position . 
   ** col. kosminych : ** shots are flying through glass panes . 
  at the same time , grenades are detonating all over the place . 
  everything around us was exploding . 
  shrapnel , chunks of walls . 
  you try to hide , but all you can do is lay on the ground . 
  following a heavy explosion , all i saw was white . 
  that was when the separatists inflitrated our position . 
   ** narrator : ** captured ukrainian soldiers are not treated like pows . 
  * ( continuation of the givi footage ) *, 
   ** givi ( in the clip ) : ** eat , you asshole !, 
  * ( forcing kosminych to eat his flag patch ) *, 
   ** narrator : ** indeed , givi presents himself in a way that generates a lot of media attention . 
   ** givi ( in the clip ) : ** * ( stuffing the patch in kosminych 's mouth ) * here , for you , colonel !, 
  * ( facing another soldier ) * why are you shaking ? 
  are you cold * ( nb : sarcastic ) * ? 
   ** narrator : ** the headquarters of the ukrainian secret service coordinates all assistance that ukrainian pows receive . 
  it is difficult to keep track of everything amidst the general confusion surrounding the undeclared war . 
  here is the spokesperson with today 's summary . 
   ** spokesperson of the ukrainian secret service : ** today , there are about 300 [ pows ] . 
  this number is constantly changing , however : after all , sometimes pows are exchanged -- data concerning them is deleted from our system thereafter . 
  at the same time , reports about missing soldiers are always coming in after battles . 
  it is impossible for us to pinpoint the exact number of pows . 
   ** narrator : ** the detention center of the ukrainian secret service is somewhere in kiev : the exact location is to remain a secret . 
  never before has a foreign television team conducted filming here . 
  two russian servicemen are imprisoned here , in spite of putin 's claims that there are no russian soldiers in ukraine . 
  one of them is yevgeny yerofeyev ( nb : one of the gru soldiers that was captured not too long ago ) . 
  he was wounded during an exchange of fire , after which he was captured . 
  yevgeny yerofeyev : ** i was taken to the military hospital in kiev . 
  here , both my arm and i were saved . 
  i lost a lot of blood after a bullet came in through here and exited through here * ( shows bullet penetration points ) * . 
  the ukrainian soldiers have put my bone together successfully , which was previously torn to pieces . 
  this is as much as i could translate in the time i had . 
  you are now at the 5 minute mark of the video . 
  i hope you enjoyed reading !, 
  stay safe , / u/luigrek !, 
  what an interesting video -- one would expect the uaf servicemen to shoot him on sight . 
  i wonder why they did n't . 
  considering the latest push of separatist forces , i 'm assuming that he was gathering military intelligence . 
  just do n't reveal our [ super secret plans ] ( http://i.imgur.com/7qjgl7i.png ) to the public , comrade . 
  quick , if we do it fast enough , maybe we can oppress russian speakers [ near the caspian sea ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/86/flag-map_of_greater_ukraine.svg ) and bathe in their tears . 
  i suggest we promptly expand our clearly superior ways of creating salo , perogies and kapusta to moscow thereafter . 
  what a time to be alive !, 
  oh , sure . 
  `` rostov nash '' is a perversion of `` krym nash '' ( `` crimea [ is ] ours '' ) , a chant used by russians during the annexation of crimea . 
  kuban is a region in russia and historically encompasses the area east of crimea and roughly a few hundred kilometers west of the caspian sea . 
  it was gifted to ukrainian black sea cossacks by empress catherine ii the great some time in the 1700s . 
  either way , there used to be [ a large ukrainian minority ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ukrainians_in_kuban#/media/file:kuban_1926.png ) ( even a majority in many sub-divisions of kuban ) , but forced resettlements of ukrainians out and russians in slowly changed the demographic . 
  the [ holodomor ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/holodomor ) has driven the ukrainian population to a minimum after the 1930s . 
  according to wikipedia :, 
   the percentage of those who identified themselves as ukrainians dropped from an official 55 % ( 1926 ) to 0.9 % ( 2002 ) . 
  with that being said , it 's not like any ( sane ) ukrainian has any claims on kuban , but the joke is just something we draw from the fact that catherine ii gifted it to the cossacks `` for eternity '' , and one that we tend to throw around when impersonating russian rhetoric . 
  to be honest , i have no idea whatsoever where the `` greater ukraine '' map comes from , i just typed that into google and the image made me laugh . 
  i believe it just takes encompasses all territories that have or had a ukrainian minority , no matter how small , making the country on the map some three times as big as ukraine today , which is clearly ridiculous but funny nevertheless . 
  [ salo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/salo_\\ ( food \\ ) ) is basically eastern european bacon , without any meat and all fat . 
  sounds gross , but tastes amazing when fried , used as spread or used as a replacement for cooking oil/butter . 
  salo is to ukrainians what vodka is for russians or what pizza is to italians . 
  there are even two annual festivals in honor of salo . 
  [ perogies ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pierogi ) are essentially slav dumplings which can be filled with basically anything , although potato mash , ground meat , cottage cheese or fruits ( or ... you guessed it : salo !, 
  needs to be fried to a crisp beforehand , however ) are used most often .
