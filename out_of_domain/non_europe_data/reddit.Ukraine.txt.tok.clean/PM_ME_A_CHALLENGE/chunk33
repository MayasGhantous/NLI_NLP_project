  ` context : ` did you know that russia paid nauru , a little island in the pacific , $ 50 million in 2009 to recognize abkhazia ( georgia 's separatist region which has achieved de-facto independence thanks to * russian help * \u2122 ) as a country ?

  excellent article , thank you for sharing . 
  ` context : ` in response to the sanctions imposed by the european union , the russian ministry of agriculture [ decided to burn cheese imports ] ( http://munchies.vice.com/articles/russias-food-sanctions-have-escalated-into-mass-cheese-burning ) which resulted in hundreds of tons of destroyed cheese .

  it surprised me that they decided to bomb the positions of someone fighting a common enemy .

  ` editball : ` as many comments in here have pointed out , the situation is much more complicated than i portrayed in the comic and than i have initially known . 
  [ i just do n't like isis and wish that this issue would bring the turks and the kurds further together rather than draw them apart . 
  thanks !, 
  ^ ( yay !, 
  i 'm one step closer to relevancy ! ), 
  admittedly , i know very little about the relations between the kurds and turkey . 
  i just found it interesting that `` the enemy of my enemy is my friend '' does n't apply to turkey 's efforts against the is , which , as far as i understand , is a greater threat to turkey than the pkk . 
  ` context : ` i have just read about [ operation lentil ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_lentil_\\ ( caucasus \\ ) ) , an operation in stalin 's soviet union that aimed at getting rid of chechens and ingush by deporting them to siberia , wrongfully claiming that they were collaborating with the nazis . 
  700 000 people were deported . 
  the eu classified operation lentil as a genocide . 
  i probably wo n't use this art style for a while as it 's very cumbersome to accomplish on ms paint .

  an interesting factor that could have been measured is the feasibility of the idea that has been generated ( e.g. 
  is a holographic display something realistically doable ? 
  ) , i.e. 
  if it can be used by combining existing technologies or by marginally expanding upon them . 
  another question that might seem relevant is if the results can be generalized to something other than something as ubiquitous as smartphones , like the arms industry . 
   longitudinal study , which tracked two cohorts of youth from 28 ** rural ** communities in iowa and pennsylvania from 2003 to 2007, 
  i wonder if the results can be generalized to youth living in ( large ) urban areas given the differences between the milieus ( e.g. 
  access to media ? 
  prevalence in religiosity/tradition ? 
   so this is basically the wall street protest right here, 
  i 'm dying !, 
  in no way was that because of oil prices soaring to $ 100 per barrel , no , not at all . 
  you have got to be kidding me . 
  aside from problems arising from corruption that are slowly being solved , the main thing holding ukraine back is russia which has even gone as far as promising to ban imports from ukraine if the economic part of the association agreement is implemented . 
  ask any ukrainian whose information diet does * not * solely consist of russian state sponsored propaganda and they will tell you that the hope and the perspective of a better future and unity with the rest of europe was well worth the mess ukraine currently finds itself in . 
  oh no crimea is poof gone in panel two !, 
  i love this one . 
  i feel like you are ill-informed about what kind of person and what kind of politician yanukovich was because you seem to hold him in high regard . 
  why is that ? 
  i 'm not blaming russia for everything . 
  corruption and oligarchy are holding ukraine 's prosperity back just as much as that of russia . 
  but do you honestly think that russia is n't holding it back even more by annexing crimea , by sponsoring war in donbass and thereby draining ukraine 's resources and monetary supplies or by threatening to ban imports if the association agreement with the eu is fulfilled ? 
  of course ukraine wo n't be in the european union within 10 years . 
  given the current pace of reforms , i 'd say a good 20 years is what it takes . 
  what exactly has putin done that is so positive ? 
  he has made the oligarchy a * less * rampant problem , but the price the oligarchs had to pay in order to keep the wealth they scrambled during the 90s ( which , to this day , they still hold ) was that they had to align themselves behind him which is why oligarch media is very much pro-putin . 
  aside from that , he has crushed chechen independence movements causing refugee waves all over europe when grozny became a pile of rubble , ethnic georgians were chased out of south ossetia , part of an independent country has been annexed and a covert proxy war has been started . 
  russia 's international reputation is in the gutter and sanctions are biting it 's economy . 
  this is the price russia has to pay for its actions , now was it worth it ? 
  would n't russia and the world have benefited from a more social-liberal leader who would bring russia closer to europe and bring economic prosperity to the people of russia instead of a pipe-dream of lost glory ? 
  is sputnik news the best source you can find ? 
  it 's a russian state-run propaganda outlet , in case you did n't know . 
   `` this is ours , our native land , '' he said , reclining in a large plastic chair . 
  `` look , they gave me a pickle with my beer . 
  in geneva , they would n't have done that . '', 
  just lovely . 
   i 've heard a patronizing , `` stephen , you do n't understand ; there 's no such country as ukraine '', 
  do russians ( or pro-russians ) actually believe this nonsense ? 
  let me introduce my post with the definition of ** chekhov 's gun ** , taken from the [ wikipedia article ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chekhov's_gun ) :, 
   chekhov 's gun is a dramatic principle that requires every element in a narrative be necessary and irreplaceable , and that everything else be removed . 
  this means , and this holds true for every aspect of both atla and what we have seen from lok , that * every single thing * has some kind of a meaning for the rest of the series in one way or another . 
  after all , why animate , voice act and direct something that adds nothing to the plot ? 
  here are a few examples of chekhov 's gun and their meaning for future episodes :, 
  * ** aiwei saying that toph has left her family and everything behind in search of enlightenment . 
  this means that we * most certainly * will see toph in the future . 
  there is no other way , or else she would n't have been mentioned or just killed off entirely . 
  * ** suyin arguing against the earth queen . 
  this most likely means a future interaction between the two . 
  keep in mind that `` interaction '' does n't have to mean that they will talk ; perhaps suyin will replace the earth queen and create a new era of freedom for the kingdom . 
  or , maybe it means [ that she is affiliated with the anarchist red lotus . 
  ] ( / spoiler ) ** ( spoiler alert for those who have n't seen s03e09 : `` the stakeout '' ) ** i have made some picture analysis of a past episode to support that claim and it can be found [ here . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/thelastairbender/comments/2cisov/i_think_found_picture_proof_of_suyins_affiliation ) the same spoiler alert applies to that link . 
  * ** varrick 's inventions concerning magnetism **, 
  we will certainly see a powerful display of a new invention of his , perhaps even a deus ex machina where his invention saves the day . 
  i encourage anyone here to find other chekhov 's guns , for i 'm sure there are plenty i have missed . 
  ** now , before you donwnvote me for thinking that i am a person of religious faith that tries to negate the scientific method , please read this post first . 
  certainly , if you are like me and most other people who follow an agnostic approach to religion , by which i do n't mean agnosticism per se but rather the `` i do n't know for sure '' philosophy , you maintain a certain distance to dogma ( '' * this * is the * true * path '' ) and gnosticism ( '' * i 'm sure * that i 'm right '' ) . 
  you see yourself as a person of thought , one that analyzes phenomena before either accepting or dismissing them . 
  while this approach holds true and is absolutely sufficient for most metaphysical questions , there is a need for a more standardized and carefully thought through logical approach to scientific phenomena . 
  we call this approach the scientific method . 
  while most of us can agree that , for the purpose of scientific progress , the scientific method is rather perfect in itself , those of us who are not directly involved in the process of scientific discovery are not the ones following the method -- that 's where scientists come in . 
  i have a friend with which i have debated the beginnings of the universe . 
  himself being a firm proponent of the big bang theory , i was intrigued as to wether or not he could explain his stance . 
  i was not only disappointed , but also quite surprised when his only argument was `` scientists have proved it '' and/or `` scientists have found compelling evidence as to the validity of the theory '' .
