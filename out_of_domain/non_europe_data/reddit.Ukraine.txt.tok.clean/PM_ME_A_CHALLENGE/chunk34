  upon inquiry , he could not produce any of the evidence he suggests exists . 
  where am i getting at with this story ? 
  our trust in science resembles to the puerile trust of a child , and moreover that of fundamentalist religious individuals who refuse to delve deeper into the subjects at hand , rejecting anything written outside of their book of faith . 
  when saying `` scientists have found out * x * '' , most people , including myself , will blindly jump to the conclusion that the idea presented is most certainly valid . 
  my belief in quantum mechanics and the big bang are thereby just as ungrounded as the belief of christians in their prophet -- for in both cases , our source is a claim that either of us refuses to delve into . 
  of course , there is a major difference : the fact that , if i wanted to , i * could * look into the evidence by first learning about complex mathematics and then applying the scientists formulae to the problem at hand , thereby gaining access to that knowledge myself . 
  but i do n't do it and you probably do n't either . 
  i believe that it is the * responsibility * of someone who believes their beliefs are grounded to * actually * verify said ground before baselessly and dogmatically accepting the words of a scientist or , by extension , someone who claims that scientists have proven this or that . 
  i see many of you discussing nickelodeon 's lack of promotion as far as book 4 is concerned . 
  i think we can all agree on that nickelodeon has made it crystal clear that they want tlok to stop and move on to more family friendly content that they can capitalize on more easily due to its inherent shallowness and the relative ease to pick up those series . 
  while the lack of character development can be frustrating for seasoned and more mature viewers ( think : spongebob ) , we must not forget that nickelodeon 's primary concern is to generate profit . 
  since they now feel like the viewership of tlok is financially unsatisfactory , they will surely pull it from their program very quickly ... 
  unless all of a sudden , the show generates more profit . 
  this is where most of you come in . 
  you want to popularize tlok in an effort to keep the franchise alive . 
  many of you have been playing around with the idea of prequels featuring short movie type content depicting the lives of past avatars . 
  also many of you have voiced support for a miniseries featuring the next avatar , assuming that the book 4 ending will allow for that to happen . 
  now , the big problem lies within the fact that bryke and michael have explicitly refused to continue to creatively explore the avatar universe any further . 
  they have been producing said content for a decade now and , as all artists , feel the need to grow in a different direction . 
  i fully trust and support them and i will most definitely follow them along their way . 
  so now we know that the duo responsible for the amazing and excellent content we have had the pleasure to experience are under no circumstances going to continue producing the series . 
  i know many of you will now invoke the off-chance of it happening , but i would like to introduce a possibility whose likelihood is far greater :, 
  * avatar continuing without bryke or michael . 
  once nickelodeon will see that the franchise starts yielding profit again , they will naturally want there to be more episodes , seasons or even series . 
  but seeing that the two creators who have fueled the series with their creative genius are unwilling to continue , nickelodeon will likely hire other people to produce and write it . 
  after all , with them holding the copyright , they have the right to do so . 
  then , they will likely add in elements that they think will appeal to the main audience : shallow , easily understandable humor , next to no character development for newcomers to pick the show up easily , and so on and so forth . 
  in essence , the probability of destroying everything we loved about the franchise will be stabbed repeatedly with a plastic spoon until the seasoned , mature viewership gets hunted out of the whole deal . 
  has anyone of you watched spongebob in the early 2000s ? 
  looking back , i believe that the show had a certain quality that was unusual for a cartoon series . 
  there was always some sort of message conveyed by each episode , a sort of moral that turned each episode into a fable , teaching us basic values in combination with making us laugh . 
  unfortunately , after season 3 nickelodeon has demanded more laughter and less moral lessons . 
  what came out of it was the abhorrent display of literal time waste . 
  * it sucks * nowadays . 
  the threat is real that the same might happen to our franchise . 
  by getting new producers and writers , nickelodeon will likely * pervert * the series into appealing to a broader audience by making it essentially worthless by our universal standards : depth of character , character development , and a complex story that takes a while to get into . 
  at this point , this will very likely be outside of the new producers control . 
  personally , i would prefer the series to suffer a grandiose death that we shall all remember than to see it hooked on life support , getting dragged on and on by our oh-so beloved nickelodeon . 
  this is why i believe that our over promotion of book 4 , although certainly pure-hearted , * might * lead to an unintended backlash that could potentially taint the entire franchise . 
  i am interested in your thoughts . 
  combustion benders . 
  i really hope that the whole p'li backstory we got to witness during the conversation between her and zaheer wo n't go to waste . 
  what if korra learns combustion bending ? 
  it does seem practical against mechs , although the same goes for lightening generation . 
  hello !, 
  this timetable illustrates at what time the newest episode airs depending on your location . 
  since the initial publication i have corrected all mistakes pointed out to me in the comments . 
  note that 12pm est is usually the time the episode gets online on nick.com . 
  the episodes air much sooner on itunes ( usually around 6-8 hours sooner ) . 
  in my experience , it takes very little time after the publication on itunes that copies of the episode start to surface on torrent sites . 
  on the other hand , amazon has demonstrated irregularities as to the publication time of new episodes .

  note : although this timetable was written specifically for the premiere ( which has aired quite some time ago ) , it is still valid today . 
  that being said , have a great day !, 
  i feel like nickelodeon has put too many easter eggs into this episode and too much information into the trailer . 
  for each of the following bullet points , when referring to the trailer , i encourage everyone to have [ this screenshot breakdown of the book 4 trailer ] ( http://imgur.com/a/y0wa3 ) opened in another tab . 
  - [ we see that the tiles of unconquered earth kingdom provinces are the same color as the republic of nations . 
  obviously , kuvira aims at reconquering it since it was once nothing but fire nation colonies on earth kingdom territory . 
  - [ we find out ( using rather overwhelming evidence ) that one of the captured rebels of the failed train heist has attacked the kai and opal , suggesting that there is a conspiracy where kuvira actually uses agents provocateurs to put pressure on provinces that are unwilling to join . 
  - from the trailer , we find out that at some point , zhu li is fighting bolin , suggesting that he changed sides after seeing that kuvira 's rule is probably not what he thought it was . 
  - perhaps this is partly due to the airbenders resisting kuvira after having found out about the conspiracy . 
  this is seen in the trailer when the metal clan mechs are trying to move in heavy wind . 
  maybe something happened to opal that made him change his mind ? 
  - obviously , kuvira is prince wu 's rival . 
  this is confirmed by the scene from the trailer where prince wu and mako ( his bodyguard ) are in a train , where wu has been trapped in a box and korra is fighting off metal darts attributable to either kuvira or some other member of her army . 
  - now that we have proven that kuvira 's reich is definitely evil , that one scene from the trailer where the firelady , zuko , reiko and tenzin are sitting in front of people in metal clan uniforms can be interpreted as perhaps a trial or a negotiation concerning the republic 's defeat . 
  it makes sense to see the firelady and zuko as well as tenzin since it were aang and zuko who have founded the republic . 
  - the scene from the trailer where suyin is in a mech is either a flashback or her taking revenge due to the betrayal of bataar and kuvira mentioned in the first episode . 
  - we also find out that korra is 100 % against the new metal kingdom . 
  this is confirmed by two scenes from the trailer : one where she fights off that metal dart ( as mentioned above ) and one where she assumes a fighting position with dozens , perhaps hundreds of metal foot soldiers in the background . 
  * i 'm not even trying * to make up theories , these things are all direct deductions from things we have already seen . 
  i feel like nickelodeon has offered us way too much information with their trailer . 
  ** tl ; dr ** : from here on out , i fear that there is little room for surprises . 
  kuvira tries to annex the whole earth kingdom as well as the republic of nations , the air nomads find out about a conspiracy between kuvira and the `` bandits '' , they try to fight , bolin changes sides ( perhaps something happened to opal ) , everything seems lost until toph and korra intervene . 
  really , the only surprise left is how toph will fit into the whole story . 
  what do you think ? 
  could it be that the writers have reacted to the fandom 's complaint about lack of character development by `` cheating '' and essentially create brand new character traits for the krew by making book 4 play out in the future ? 
  the more people comment , the better !, 
  i hate asking for upvotes but if you wish for this experiment to reach its full potential , please comment and upvote so that other people can comment as well !,
