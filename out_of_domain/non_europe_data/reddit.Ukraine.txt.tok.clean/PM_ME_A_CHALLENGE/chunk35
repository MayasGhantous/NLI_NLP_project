  there are no boundaries to the question . 
  * do you believe a certain ship will set sail ? 
  * what characters do you think will die , and under what circumstances ? 
  * will korra regain her connection to her past lives ? 
  * what will happen to her on the last episode ? 
  * will zuko reunite with his uncle ? 
  i repeat , there are no limits to answering the question !, 
  those were just suggestions to get the ball rolling . 
  just write down what you believe will happen or just what you hope will happen , even if it 's just a minor detail . 
  as i said in the title , i 'll combine all of the information into a sleek infograph , honoring the users who were right or close to what is actually going to happen !, 
  enjoy yourselves while you 're at it !, 
  the one that has that jazzy feel to it . 
  i like it !, 
  it also played during korra 's and asami 's reunion in b4e7 . 
  this is a post dedicated towards those who suffer from depression ( as well as those who believe that they do ) and believe that they will have trouble coping with the series ' end . 
  it 's not only a guide catered towards coping with it , but also a reference manual and a psa concerning depression and suicide . 
  if you do not fall into the category of people who believe they might have trouble with the present situation , it 's fine !, 
  i still would like to ask you to read it , there is tons of useful information , perhaps some that could make a meaningful difference in your life . 
  enjoy !,

  ** edit ( feb 3 , 2015 ) : ** thank you for the overwhelming support and love that this post has gotten !, 
  it means the world to me . 
  / u/chatttheleaper has volunteered to answer messages regarding the topic of depression . 
  just like me ( / u/pm _ me_a_challenge ) , he will listen to you if you need somebody to have a chat with . 
  do n't be shy !, 
  having experienced depression ourselves , we 're both committed to help anyone who needs help or who wants to have a discussion about the topic of mental health . 
  they say that the devil lies within the details . 
  well , take a [ closer look at the hand holding scene ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dk5lja2.png ) . 
  now , try to imagine being in korra 's position and try to mimic the way her left hand is positioned in relation to that of asami . 
  you may notice that hyperextending your elbow and having the palm of your left hand facing backwards is rather uncomfortable . 
  who would hold hands like this ? 
  [ now , take a look at the scene featuring korra and asami in the portal . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mlphpwh.png ) if you look closely , you may notice that there is continuity and that korra 's left hand is still facing outward . 
  you may wish to re-watch the scene to fully convince yourself . 
  assuming that her right hand is holding asami 's left hand normally ( wherein both of their hands would be facing inward ) , korra is left with an unnatural stance : her right hand is facing inward and her left one outward instead of both inward , which obviously is n't very comfortable . 
  ** if you have trouble visualizing what i mean , try extending your arms forward while letting both of the palms of your hands naturally face each other . 
  leave your right hand in its position . 
  now , twist your left hand 180 \u00b0 clockwise . 
  ** would you hold someones hands like this ? 
  just a small detail i noticed !, 
  also , how does your current lifestyle ( including debt ! ), 
  tie in with the above questions ? 
  it would also be interesting to know where you are from . 
  hey , i 'm an officer in a faction . 
  we have just built a wall surrounding the perimeter of our base . 
  my question is : will it still make sense to have a wall now that firejet etc. 
  are coming ? 
  intruders could just fly over the wall . 
  greetings , this is my analysis of the fn vs ne war . 
  i 'm sure that most people from fn or our allies in the war will agree with what will be said here , especially those who were in our ts and those who fought in the war . 
  preamble : ne declared war on fn ** three times ** before the siege of imperial city . 
  i say in the other analysis that ne is trying to paint us as the bad guys here ( sic ) , and i 'm glad to see that most people disagree with that point of view . 
  here is a list of war declarations from gu to ne . 
  read them before reading the analysis of the war . 
  gu declares that the entire earth kingdom is now under their sovereignty . 
  that being said , they demand payments for any fn outposts near ba sing se . 
  the one in question is one from fire fountain city ( ffc ) . 
  gu wants fn to pay \u00a5 100 for it . 
  although it is a small price , gu trying to extract a ransom form fn is incredibly humiliating . 
  i trash talk in the chat whereupon gu declares war on the fn . 
  after some internal diplomatic discussions , we actually end up paying those \u00a5 100 , and gu sets relations back to neutral after demanding an apology from me and declaring a party in our conference hall in backpacker city . 
  this one happened the day after . 
  out of the blue , gu declares war on the fn . 
  upon inquiry , he says that the reason for that is that members of the fire nation are trash talking in the chat ( although clearly , we were certainly not alone in this ) . 
  upon promising to gu that we will purge anyone with anti-ne sentiments from the fire nation , peace is reached again . 
  i call in a meeting with each fn member who was online at the time . 
  idahosciguy and i present them the new peace deal and reluctantly tell them that every one with anti-ne sentiments will be evicted from the fn . 
  we are met with the proposal to make a pre-emptive strike on ne instead of bowing down . 
  a discussion sparks but is postponed until a better time . 
  it turns out that ne had spies listening in to our conversation . 
  after hearing about our ideas of striking ne , a new war is declared , in which about five chunks from backpackercity get annexed to ne . 
  the war is called off again after i reach a new peace agreement with gu , in which we agreed that as long as we do n't plan anything against them , they wo n't plan anything against us . 
  but after what happened , nobody in the fn trusted ne anymore and calls for a pre-emptive strike became universal . 
  in the meantime , the leadership of the fire nation gets transferred from fwilli to me . 
  what follows is a very brief analysis of the actual war . 
  - i create a town called kaon in the middle of the south pole to create a place where we can actually host secret meetings without anyone spying on us . 
  all people from the fire nation are called to come there and participate in a war meeting . 
  meanwhile , we are setting up chests with weapons , food and fence posts . 
  - a town called newnewempire gets created next to imperial city 's ( ic 's ) semi automatic wheat farm . 
  the attack would then start from there . 
  - all the while , the assistants of the fire nation and i are messaging anyone who might be interested in joining a war . 
  we get a bunch of independent towns , people from the water tribe and korrasami to help us lead the war effort . 
  at its height , fire nation was comprised of a total of 17 towns and the invasion force was 25 people strong at one point ( although this number decreased throughout the night ) . 
  - amidst me messaging people to join the war effort , i stumble upon someone who says he might be interested . 
  i give him the necessary information to join the war effort . 
  shortly after that , we get reports saying that ne knows about the invasion plan . 
  we put two and two together and throw the traitor out of the invasion force . 
  - after some heavy organizational issues , the fn and our allies leroy jenkins into imperial city through newnewempire . 
  we quickly notice that ne did in fact know about the plan as we were instantly met with resistance from their side in the form of excellent fighters . 
  - however , we manage to flank them and to claim a few chunks around their border ( mostly thanks to fire lord izumi 's leadership a.k.a. 
  / u/fuck _ my_prolapse ) , including part of their arena . 
  still , most of our attempts of claiming chunks are sabotaged by ne 's airbenders . 
  - all the while , a special operations unit secretly goes to their oil rig unnoticed and claims about 5 chunks in there . 
  somebody reports to us that there are chests full of diamonds in one of the chunks we claimed . 
  whilst searching for them , we are met with resistance and get blown off oil rig before be can find them . 
  ( nb : this information is later confirmed by ne 's assistants ) . 
  - whilst another attack on ic is going on , some of ne 's fighters have started attacking ffc .
