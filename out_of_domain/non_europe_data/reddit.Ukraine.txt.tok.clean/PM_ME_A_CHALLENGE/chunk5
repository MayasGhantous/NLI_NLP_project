  wether they held pistols or sniper rifles is of no relevance . 
  if you ask me , these [ animals ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86o4piz72mk ) all share the same guilt . 
  i think what you are doing however is evading a perfectly valid statement . 
  in question form : what reason did the russian federation have to grant these murderers full citizenship upon asylum ? 
   are you aware that you 're comparing incomparable numbers ? 
  clearly , i am not . 
  if support for independence were so popular before the referendum , i am more than convinced that the people would have voted the party whose only program was unification with russia . 
   if 33 % of a region want to join another country , there is a problem . 
  this statement is fundamentally flawed . 
  in a democracy , the majority gets the right to decide the fate of the land . 
  if those 33 % were so interested in joining russia , the choice that would respect the majority of people would be them moving to the russian federation . 
   `` the survey of crimeans after the russian takeover showed they are overwhelmingly happy to be part of russia , with nearly three-quarters of those surveyed saying their life will improve as part of russia rather than ukraine . '', 
  none of this excuses a military invasion . 
  none of it . 
  furthermore , i do not see one reply to the clearly exorbitant outcome of the referendum . 
   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/massacres_of_poles_in_volhynia_and_eastern_galicia, 
  i am tired of nitpicking in history . 
  of course bandera and the upa have made many mistakes that the common man refuses to acknowledge whilst preserving the traits he desires . 
  it is juvenile and unjustifiable . 
  but you really want to go down history lane , why not take a look at the [ holodomor ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/holodomor ) before accusing ukrainian history to be flawed . 
   i do n't know , may be talk with them ? 
   by the way , you know how second chechen war have been ended ? 
  talks between russia and chechen separatists . 
  you are portraying russia to be the good guy who just wanted to talk to rapidly end a conflict . 
  i think you forget the [ thousands of casualties between the beginning and the end of the war ] ( http://www.watchdog.cz/index.php?show=000000-000005-000003-000001&amp;lang=1 ) and clearly decisive military victory from russia before any talks . 
  never mind that maskhadov and basayev who have led the conflict on the chechen side have been assassinated by the fsb . 
  care to tell me who exactly was involved in these * talks * you mentioned ? 
  this does n't go to say that the russian federation was wrong to engage in warfare with chechnya . 
  they had every right to protect their territorial integrity . 
  what i do n't like is that you try to make russia out to be something it is not , in this case a country that has achieved peace * only * by means of peace talks and bilateral conversations . 
  ukraine has every right to defend itself the same way against the eastern insurgents . 
  they came out of nowhere with weapons transported over the russian border and claim land that is n't theirs . 
  igor girkin , the leader of the donetsk terrorists was born and raised in russia . 
  please use your senses and know that something is terribly off about this situation . 
  people who acquire weapons through questionable means , infiltrate sovereign soil only to proclaim their own order without * any * legitimate democratic procedure are terrorists in my book . 
  you are truly a master of taking everything that i wrote out of context . 
   ` there are no nazi in ukraine and i 've never heard about them ', 
  i have * never * said that there are no nazis in ukraine . 
  clearly they do exist . 
  here is what i * have * said :, 
   never have i heard or seen fascist or `` nazi '' ukrainians, 
  i was talking about * my * interpersonal experiences . 
  let 's continue :, 
   ` juvenile mistakes ', 
  * i beg your pardon ? 
  * do you think that i condone the volhynia massacre ? 
  perhaps you should read what i said again :, 
   of course bandera and the upa have made many mistakes that the common man refuses to acknowledge whilst preserving the traits he desires . 
  it is juvenile and unjustifiable . 
  i said that the people blindly supporting the upa were juvenile and unjustifiable . 
  this was a perfect opportunity for conversation where we could have learnt about our views in a civilized fashion and i thoroughly enjoyed it . 
  but you misquoting everything i said and insulting proves that you are completely unworthy of further discussion . 
  ever thought about making a short animated parody of lok ? 
  your drawings are absolutely amazing and hilarious !, 
  great job , neodusk . 
  all for it !, 
  suit yourself !, 
  this week 's teaser gives less away than the last one , if you want to take my word for it . 
  i just posted this in case anyone was curious and has n't found it already . 
  my bad !, 
  i have n't seen it on the front page and thought nobody saw it yet . 
  ** water ** - water out of air ( remember when the blood bending witch taught katara ? 
  ) , plus healing could also be considered a bending subset . 
  ** earth ** - i think you said it all . 
  perhaps the seismic sense , which includes truth seeing could be considered a subset . 
  ** fire ** - apart from lightening generation and lightening redirection , there is also combustion . 
  ** air ** - flying and astral projection could be considered bending subsets exclusive to air benders . 
  perhaps you might notice how a the color of a flame changes according to its temperature . 
  for instance , if you use gasoline as a combustible and the gases included in air as combustion agents , you might notice that the flame is blue . 
  however , if you burn wood , it is between red and yellow . 
  that is because the combustion of gasoline occurs at a greater temperature than that of wood , prompting the flame to be blue in color . 
  thus , azula 's flames are blue simply because the fire she she produces is hotter . 
  you could argue that that is a sign of her superior bending power . 
  quick serious answer : depression . 
  the answer to your question is still a matter of speculation ; i believe she 'll have at least some kind of problems persisting . 
  by the way , spoiler tags do n't work in post titles . 
  just put [ spoiler ] at the beginning . 
  if that is n't enough , click on `` spoiler '' below the title . 
  until then , i suggest you remove this post , for the title contains a spoiler ; even if you put on a spoiler tag , please refrain from putting a spoiler in the title , as a user might stumble upon it . 
  instead , name it something along the lines of `` question about the aftermath of the book finale '' . 
  both air and fire can create nothing that lasts . 
  fire disappears momentarily as does air . 
  they are good in combat situations , but the scope of their use does n't really go beyond that . 
  sure , you could work in a power plant like mako or pick apples from trees like the air benders during wan 's reign , but that is about it . 
  flying or astral projection require more spiritual sacrifice than i would be willing to give and i 'm sure as hell not getting a third eye tattoo to bend fire with my mind . 
  earth and water however have effects much greater and lasting . 
  let 's compare them :, 
  while water is not only an excellent combat weapon , the ability to bloodbend is a way to completely * obliterate * your enemies . 
  it can also be used as a means of transportation as desna and eska have shown whilst chasing the avatar through the sea on their icy surf boards . 
  also , lets not forget the healing properties of water which are probably the most constructive and benevolent of all bending subsets . 
  so why is earth the best element to bend ? 
  well , it has the perfect mix of constructive and destructive properties : while you can fight someone off with lava very efficiently and use a metal suit like toph did in the finale of atla , you can also build houses out of rocks and metal . 
  also , the seismic sense and the ability to detect lies is very much worth adopting earth as an element . 
  while i myself enjoy the series a lot , i would love it if the show would have a clear cut and excellent ending than to go on forever . 
  in the words of kurt cobain : * it is better to burn out than to fade away * . 
  also , it is very much likely that the creators would like to move on after book 4 , as it is with every artist who does the same for a very long time . 
  if however , the creators do decide to continue the series ( which i hope !, 
  ) , i would want them to either :, 
  - make one hour shorts or two hour specials than summarize the lives of the next earth and fire avatars, 
  - continue the series with a network that endorses adult and truly * mature * content .
