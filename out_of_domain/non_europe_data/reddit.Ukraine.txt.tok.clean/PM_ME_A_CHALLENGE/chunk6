  i am referring to an end to the factors that nickelodeon forces the creators to include to appeal to the target age group , such as the ginora-kai relationship . 
  however , i must say that compared to atla , this show has made an * excellent * jump into more mature content and has quite perfectly aged with its audience . 
  i am sure that book 4 will delve even further into more adult themes , mainly depression . 
  but to be honestly , if there was n't the plot hole of kuvira and what happened to toph , i would be very much satisfied with the book 3 finale to be the end of the series . 
  it will take a lot for the creators to come up with an ending that could be up to par with what we saw a few days ago . 
  it is incredible that korra falls at least 200 feet to the ground and is essentially untouched . 
  it bothered me quite a bit , although it did n't ruin , it did stain the otherwise excellent ending . 
  interesting !, 
  i originally thought they were making fun of modern slackers , especially with the rather contemporary glasses or that the creators were making fun of someone they know in real life for whatever reason . 
  but that 's a very interesting point you just made !, 
  it 'll probably tie in with book 4 . 
  there can only be two possibilities for [ metal to be liquid at room temperature ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/liquid_metal ) : either mercury or an alloy that contains gallium . 
  since gallium is essentially non-toxic , the only possibility left is mercury . 
  although it is n't `` canon '' as such since it has n't been * explicitly * been mentioned to be mercury , you could argue that the death of the earth queen is n't canon either due to its implicitness . 
  the fact that the poison is mercury is really nothing but deduction . 
  probably strapped in the same way korra was strapped in the red lotus stronghold . 
  or confined to a space too small for him to move his limbs enough to bend . 
  either way , it seems terribly inefficient to lock up someone like him . 
  i think there is quite a major plot hole : he could just meditate , get into the spirit world , go through one of the portals and be not only free , but immortal since he is now de facto a spirit . 
  however , in that case , he would n't be able to bend any more . 
  1 ( book 1 ) : `` the boy in the iceberg '' . 
  pretty much mandatory . 
  2 ( book 1 ) : `` the avatar returns '' . 
  shows the burden of aang and how he is united with his new family after his emotional outbreak when he saw gyatso 's skeleton . 
  also gives a good impression of the war . 
  19 and 20 ( book 1 ) : `` the siege of the north '' parts 1 and 2 . 
  gives yet another great impression of the war and zuko 's early character development . 
  26 ( book 2 ) : `` the blind bandit '' . 
  the introduction of toph seems a rather important addition to the list . 
  40 ( book 2 ) : `` the crossroads of destiny '' . 
  shows zuko 's inner conflict . 
  41 ( book 3 ) : `` the awakening '' . 
  adds continuity to the last episode . 
  52 ( book 3 ) : `` the western air temple '' . 
  shows zuko 's change and his addition to the team . 
  60 and 61 ( book 3 ) : `` sozin 's comet : into the inferno '' and `` sozin 's comet : avatar aang '' . 
  these really episodes wrap up the series . 
  all in all , this leaves out most of the sub stories that are n't entirely necessary to the plot . 
  i believe that the most important story is aang 's path to the mastery of all elements as well as zuko 's change and contribution to the team . 
  the total time of the ten episodes i have listed amounts to a little less than 240 minutes ( 4 hours ) , or the equivalent of two back to back feature films . 
  death is the only inevitability . 
  i do n't see why you 're being downvoted . 
  i have n't given that any thought . 
  what a bothersome mistake by the writers !, 
   please use [ spoiler ] tags in titles !, 
  mark all spoiler submissions as nsfw !, 
  ( up to three days . ), 
  from the sidebar . 
  the `` three days '' part means that if an episode is released on monday night , spoiler tags must be used until thursday night , at which point it is considered that a great majority of the subscribers of / r/thelastairbender have seen said episode . 
  following your logic , every content depicting zuko and aang in the same picture being friendly to one another is a spoiler of book 3 of atla and should thereby have a spoiler tag . 
  it is considered that if you are subscribed to this subreddit , you are most likely very up to date as far as the series is concerned . 
  therefore , the mods decided that a three day cap for spoiler content is largely sufficient . 
  - * `` you can still save her . 
  the poison is metallic . 
  well , how do you know , ginora ? 
  i mean , * we * know that she projected her spirit to the place korra received the poison , but that one line felt absolutely out of context , at least to the rest of the characters involved in the situation , as far as my judgement is concerned . 
  - * katara was absent ruing ginora 's anointment . 
  need i say more ? 
  - i am pretty sure the red lotus would have known * a little * better not to underestimate the avatar . 
  why did n't they kill her and then roam the fallen earth kingdom for the new avatar , then take him/her out while they are a defenseless child ? 
  oh , right , because nickelodeon would n't like it . 
  all in all , i hoped that the red lotus problem would continue onto book 4 . 
  i hoped that zaheer 's ideas would become too extreme for ming-hua and ghazan who would then help team avatar defeat him and p'li . 
  nevertheless , although too quickly paced , it was a much better book than the second one . 
  saved for vectors ... op , please deliver !, 
  ** edit : nevermind , i found them !, 
  ** also , it seems as if op commented on the post himself since he linked to a similar image than the one he just posted . 
  [ have fun with your laser cutters !,

  since you are so fond of fallacies , have you heard of the fallacy fallacy ? 
  you try to discredit what i said by pointing out fallacies . 
  unfortunately , the fallacies you have pointed out have no correlation to what has been said . 
  allow me to point out that an appeal to authority occurs when a supposed * truth * is associated to an authority , e.g. 
  '' * x * said that 1 + 1 = 3 , and * x * represents an authority in my eyes therefore it is true '' . 
  in this case , there is no truth or hypothesis to defend . 
  presenting a given construct or a rule is definitely * not * an appeal to authority . 
  in fact , there is no correlation between the two phenomena . 
  the cornerstone of my argumentation was the social construct of the subreddit , advocated by the sidebar . 
  following your logic , you should n't put people who break the law into jail because following the order of law consists of an `` appeal to authority '' . 
  and no , that was not a slipery slope . 
  it is a syllogism . 
  perhaps this [ link ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/syllogism ) could help you understand . 
  saying that since a = b and b = c therefore a = c is * definitely not * a slippery slope so long as one or multiple logical paradigms , in this case the correct premise , pertain the syllogism . 
   more appeal to authority . 
  `` if the mods said it , it must be right ! '', 
  false . 
  you see , what you did there was a slippery slope . 
  `` pm_me_a_challenge said ` the mods decided ... ' therefore he thinks that if the mods said it , it must be right ! '' . 
  in this case , the logical paradigm that was broken was that of deduction , i.e. 
  i pointed out the social construct of the subreddit , therefore you believe that the moderators represent a moral authority to me . 
   `` it does n't have to be , therefore it should not be '' , [ ... ] that statement does n't make any sense . 
  yes it does . 
  it is redundant . 
  the basic argument is included in the speech you perversely put in my mouth during your introductory ad hominem , ironically and quite amusingly enough before you started lecturing me about fallacies :, 
   `` how dare op use spoiler tags when its not necessary , he 's clearly ruining my reddit experience by forcing me to mouse over the title to see what it is !!! '', 
  some of the titles contain spoilers . 
  this is unfortunate . 
  this is why i avoid hovering over spoilers altogether when i am at risk of suffering from a poorly chosen title . 
  however , when content that does not contain spoilers pertaining to the three day rule is tagged as such , i have lost the opportunity to engage in a non-spoiler discussion altogether . 
   except unlike you,
