  for someone who knows so much about fallacies , it surprises me that you engage in tu quoque so * openly * . 
   i made actual arguments to my point in my post . 
  fallacies were simply used to point out that your post had no points . 
  i have seen no such arguments in your previous post . 
  kindly refer to those by quoting them , if you please . 
   you extended the argument to a ridiculous hypothetical . 
  you see , the problem with your claim is that the logic of using spoiler tags over the three day threshold apparently follows no objective rule , other than one where you can accuse me of using a `` ridiculous hypothetical '' when it suits you . 
  where the line is to be drawn is apparently used at your convenience . 
   complains about ad hominum fallacy whilst calling me perverse, 
  i said `` the basic argument is included in the speech you perversely put in my mouth during your introductory ad hominem '' . 
  the word `` perversely '' refers to the perversion or ridicule of your little rant . 
  it most certainly was n't an attack at you . 
  however , i ca n't see how you are defending your ad hominem . 
   whilst this may be true during season when new episodes are coming out, 
  * that is exactly the point * . 
  i hereby retire from this discussion . 
  right sector ! = right wing, 
   can you please provide some good proof that someone is supporting people from dnr/lnr, 
  i do n't see why you 're getting downvoted , you 've got a good point . 
  from a marketing point of view , nickelodeon 's decision does n't seem like a terribly good idea . 
  i myself have introduced my friends to the series in times where the tension was highest . 
  hype , generated by what you most properly referred to as ` gestation ' , creates an increased viewership . 
  i think so too . 
  the internet killed the video star , essentially . 
  i 'd be happy if nickelodeon turns into a netflix-like company , since as i live far away from the us , i have no legal means of accessing lok content . 
  this is a screenshot i have made from a video posted [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/thelastairbender/comments/2f8bd9/book_4_snippets_in_book_3_commercial/ ) , which is said commercial filmed with a camera , thus the somewhat low resolution of the image . 
  i tried finding the commercial online , but i failed . 
  you can clearly see kuvira standing in the middle of what seems to be earth kingdom prisoners . 
  notice her sunken eyebrows . 
  since this is a still frame , you ca n't see how she smirks in a well , `` evil '' manner . 
  i encourage you to watch the video i linked above . 
  i did n't realize it was a repost since i just thought i 'd take a screenshot from the front page content for added clarification . 
  i 'll leave it here -- it 's not like it 's hurting anyone . 
  - sound bending is a theoretical subset that is often discussed in here . 
  i even remember forum posts in the atla days about it , hopefully we 'll see it in book 4 . 
  now or never !, 
  - i like your idea about boiling water . 
  it was often discussed that lava bending might be inherent to direct descendants of fire and earth benders . 
  perhaps boiling water would be the same for people whose parents are water and fire benders . 
  - perhaps water benders could bend the weather , as clouds are made out of water . 
  i could imagine water tribe pirates attacking commercial ships by summoning thunderstorms . 
  you 're welcome !, 
  of course the folks over at / r/russia are more supportive of this idea , and that is for a very simple reason . 
  their soldiers falsely invaded and sponsored separatist terrorism in ukraine . 
  any one russian with a sense of what is good and intelligent is against this war . 
  after all , it is their brothers and fathers who are now fighting on foreign grounds , and many of them being killed . 
  they have no objectively justifiable reason to want war . 
  you seem to be surprised that your idea is not as well received in / r/ukraine . 
  allow me to explain . 
  i quote :, 
   in this war its you the people who will get killed for your leaders ambitions , its not worth it . 
  this is not about any one leader 's ambitions . 
  in fact , i believe that `` ambitions '' is not the right word at all . 
  what the leaders of our country did is what any other leader of any other country would have done , or at least envisioned . 
  the people fighting for our country and for the ukrainians living in donetsk and luhansk are not seen as pawns fighting another unjust war for profit or resources on foreign grounds . 
  they are considered heroes , defending ukrainians on their own soil . 
  now , the reason why your idea of #nowarinukraine is rather unpopular here becomes apparent . 
  of course , the people of our nation would much rather live in peace . 
  but that does n't mean that we have any intention of giving up what is rightfully ours . 
  it 's not like we wanted russia to invade our land , but now that is has happened , are you expecting us to sit and do nothing ? 
  you tell everyone here that they are `` missing the point '' , but i 'm afraid you are the one missing the point . 
  i understand that you want the civilians who are touched by this war to unite and condemn the war . 
  but in doing so , you seem to expect them to cut their losses and thereby leave the ukrainians of donetsk and luhansk to their fate , which is not going to happen . 
  i hope that you now understand why the reception of your idea was worse here that in / r/russia . 
  i do n't think anything is `` brewing '' , but what does `` not fucking up '' entail ? 
  assuming that a new cold war is brewing , then nato help or at least subsidization of the ukrainian armed forces would perfectly fall within the policy of containment . 
  also , since russia has denied its involvement all along and this is first and foremost a defensive war , nato involvement is definitely more justified than other nato backed conflicts in the last few decades , including but not limited to the war in iraq . 
  i 'm sure that the iraqis did n't have a 50 + % majority supporting nato troops on their ground . 
  but unlike then , when the motives of the war were and still are more than questionable , the containment of putin 's geopolitical ambitions is something to be taken very seriously . 
  we would n't want another [ sudetenland crisis ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_occupation_of_czechoslovakia ) on our hands , would we ? 
  i firmly believe that if the allied forces would have ended it then and there , then many lives could have been spared . 
  russia denying its involvement is a window of opportunity to prevent putin from becoming more confident about the inaction of western forces and let the entire conflict get out of hand . 
  the problem of nuclear warheads will pervade during the entirety of the cold war we are about to enter . 
  if anything , it will get worse with time . 
  where do you draw the line with russia playing war-games in europe ? 
  even if they 're at a nato-members doorstep , one could still argue that it is a poor choice to engage with a nuclear power . 
  her relationship status is set to `` in a relationship '' with this girl with whom she is together with for two years already . 
  also , everyone wishing her good luck for the relationship is evidence for the fact that she is , at the very least , unavailable . 
  it 's not like it matters or like it 's the end of the world for me . 
  i just wanted to get this off my chest and find out what the community thinks and/or if someone had a similar experience . 
  she smokes and drinks , so she 's not really someone who i 'd want to be in a relationship with . 
  generally speaking , i would n't mind being in a relationship with multiple women , however . 
  it does n't matter any more . 
  this was two days ago and i 'm over the whole thing anyway . 
  on to new adventures !, 
  do you guys remember that they wanted to release all of the episodes at once ? 
  well , now it seems like it 's going to be every friday , like we 're used to . 
  well , i guess you did . 
  you could have just ignored him or even blocked him . 
  look , i 'm just as sick about the victim mentality as you are . 
  but i believe that this scenario has little to do with it . 
  if school is supposed to show us how we are to behave as adults , then punishing someone for being a jerk is the way to go . 
  telling someone to `` fuck off '' out of bad temper is counterproductive and not conducive to a proper problem solving technique that adults should possess .
