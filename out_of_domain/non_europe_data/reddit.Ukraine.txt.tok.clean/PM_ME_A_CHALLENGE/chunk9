  i actually thought that aang 's tattoos were better in the movie . 
  they just seems more mystical and furthermore more realistic than that one big blue tattoo that crosses his body we got to see in the series . 
  just make sure no one clicks the beaker icons !, 
  `` ugh , i ca n't * even * '', 
  wuko ... wusami ... wuvira ... all of these new ships are going to reconquer the earth kingdom,

  sorry for the loss of quality !, 
  i hope you still enjoy it . 
  i 'm on it !,

  especially when you look away . 
  try it !, 
  glad you like it !, 
  is n't it a coincidence that a fish has been stabbed by a swiss army knife ... 
  in switzerland ? 
  shit , i hope that op is not whoring karma by killing animals and putting up a bullshit story .

  he should have checked his privilege more often . 
  either i did n't reload my browser in a long time or i 'm just tired as hell . 
  haha . 
  thank you . 
  nice one !, 
  really ? 
  this news is confusing , since the sidebar says it 's published on nov 18 . 
  i really hope that darkhorse did n't make an error , i 'm super excited for part 3 !, 
  i 'm sure they have some involvement in current affairs . 
  never in history has a group of elite fighters/intel agents been disbanded without them reappearing in a more-or-less organized way and claiming at least * some * sort of power . 
  i 'm mostly thinking about how ex-kgb agents are having a grip on russian politics and how resistance fighters in the yugoslavia war are deeply involved in human trafficking . 
  either way , i wonder what happened to the dai li !, 
  could be , but then again i wonder what interest darkhorse has in supporting comic book stores ... 
  i assume that they want to make some profit before everyone torrents the digital version . 
  good to have you here !, 
  perhaps this is just nickelodeon , well ... denying the existence of sex ? 
  wow . 
  that makes a lot of sense !, 
  what a thoughtful and quality post !, 
  i 'm really happy to see this kind of content here . 
  thank you !, 
  as to your questions , i believe that the only two states of perfect balance can only be nothingness or full entropy , just from a purely scientific point of view . 
  these states tend to be very homogenous/balanced in their own way -- although it might not seem so for full entropy , but there * is * homogeneity in ubiquitous heterogeneity . 
  that being said , perhaps the raava/vaatu duality , before wan separated them , was about as balanced as it could get . 
  no problem , stay awesome and keep the good stuff coming !, 
  it 's exactly what this sub needs . 
  very good point !, 
  * clearly , * they were just going to give each other light kisses on the cheek the whole night . 
  maybe even one or two on the lips . 
  great job !, 
  i hope your post gets more upvotes , it really deserves it . 
  has anyone here seen chronicle ? 
  without wanting to spoil it , it 's a movie about a group of friends that miraculously discover that they are capable of telekinesis . 
  i find it to be a great movie and i highly recommend it !, 
  i would like to see something similar , only with bending . 
  in an oppressed ba sing se-like society where bending has been suppressed/forgotten , one kid realizes he is capable of bending the elements . 
  he then gets in contact with a whole underground group of people being able to only bend a single element as opposed to him , and is ready to save the society from oppression with their help . 
  wow , that painting is fantastic !, 
  i wish i could paint that well . 
  [ i made an album of five of my favorite paintings from the legend of korra , hopefully you 'll find one that you like . 
  ] ( http://imgur.com/a/wrbeo ) you said that you got into painting only recently , mind telling us how you got started ? 
  keep up the good work !, 
  i mean , mako and his friends were attacked a lot by mechs in book 1 . 
  he could 've just taken them all out by generating lightening !, 
  oh well , i guess book 1 would be quite a bit shorter if he did . 
  i would like to see a little and secluded breakaway island of the fire nation , where combustion benders are born and raised . 
  i would imagine it to be a utopian and unusually peaceful society , kind of like the air nomads . 
  although their people are rigorous in practicing spartan discipline , they follow a philosophy of peace and prosperity . 
  in order to counteract warlords who tried to kidnap the children of that island due to their superior height , strength and bending prowess , the inhabitants have developed combustion bending as a tool to fend off any attackers and to keep their society intact , although a few of their citizens have either escaped in search of wealth ( combustion man ) or kidnapped by warlords during their early childhood ( p'li ) . 
  i mean , it 's clearly fake and very poorly done but [ judgment ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/judgment_\\ ( law \\ ) ) is actually a word . 
  could very well be , but then how did mako [ kill ming-hua ] ( / spoiler ) ( book 3 spoiler ) ? 
  i do n't think so , after all [ zhu li did n't get killed when varrick accidentally generated lightening and shocked her mech ] ( / spoiler ) ( b4e5 ) . 
  earth seems to be the most useful of all elements . 
  there is no expertise required to simply build a house or create a bridge . 
  also , it strikes me as the only element that has equal opportunities for defense ( like [ the wall bolin created to protect himself from the mechs ' flamethrower ] ( / spoiler ) in b4e5 ) and offense ( just throwing rocks at someone ) in fighting . 
  i would definitely choose earth . 
  keep in mind that there were only two airbenders in history who had the ability of flight , and unlocking that power required a great sacrifice on their part ... would you be willing to make it ? 
  what if korra would `` lend '' raava to toph ? 
  the result would be amazing . 
  edit : wording, 
  [ kuvira with pixel glasses . 
  also , i decided to cleanse her from her ... nose . 
  interesting !, 
  what kind of class lets you do that ? 
  yes , that would be great !, 
  thank you !,

  edit : following the advice from / u/jhunter _ d7 , i have removed the link and the instruction due to the possibility of our brute-forcing being misinterpreted as a [ ddos attack ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/denial-of-service_attack ) which would get us in legal hot waters . 
  do the same for your own sake !, 
  * slow clap *, 
  i just love katara 's expression in the second panel . 
  i ca n't remember any instance where there was a male healer in either of the series . 
  but as you said , having a medic in a war zone would be incredibly beneficial , so i 'm sure that the art has been taught to male waterbenders . 
  well , technically the rules only prohibit requesting download links to new episode . 
  but seeing as nobody has requested anything and that this is n't , in fact , a new episode ( well , i guess you could argue about that ) ... 
  but just to be safe , i suggest deleting the link , op . 
  at least ask the moderators wether or not this kind of content is prohibited , that should put you in safe waters . 
  without a doubt , i would suggest gifting them atla .
