a few from the soviet union :, 
  whatever you learn , sooner or later you will need it . 
  so no worries . 
  what makes you guys think that the nato will accept you ? 
  even georgia has n't been let in yet . 
  there are mass protests here in the netherlands and the rest of europe against this . 
  there will be referendums helt soon . 
  my bad , you are right !, 
  but if they ( politburo ) really wanted to target just the ukrainians , then why did they make the rest of ussr suffer as well ? 
  also , stalin was a tyranne to all the peoples , but why would he target the ukrainians specifically ? 
  why didnt he target the kazach people or latvs or other peoples ? 
  out of the 8 million total deaths , 3-5 were ukrainians . 
  was n't it just a terrible failure ? 
  sorry for so much questions , i am just interested ... 
  i have always supported you . 
  i have a very close kurdish friend , nice , warm people . 
  i agree , even though 50 % did vote for him , that does n't mean that every turk is to blame for it . 
  i hope that russia and russians wo n't start acting as agressive towards turks as the west does to russians . 
  i do n't understand why this gets so much media coverage , there are plenty of military parks in europe and the us as well . 
  edit : not that it 's bad , but this gets a negative view in the west , seeing russia as making young children indoctrinated and agressive . 
  kids shall be kids . 
  never write an \u044b after \u043a . , 
  there is a diffrence in the sounds :, 
   ma - ** sh\u1d7b ** - n\u1d7b, 
   ma - ** sh\u1d7b ** - nay, 
  the ** \u1d7b ** is pronounced almost like the i in `` b ** i ** t '' , and there is a stress on the '' ** sh\u1d7b ** '' . 
  i still have to meet a russian who is pro-putin in rl . 
  i do n't believe those polls . 
  those polls are mostly conducted by telephone , people are being called by the [ state-run researchcenter ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russian_public_opinion_research_center ) , and asked if they approve putin . 
  imagine if that happend during the soviet era , what would you say ? 
  and lets say that * hypothetically * the russians do support putin by around 85 % , then still a overwhelming amount [ condemns ] ( http://time.com/11952/putin-ukraine-crimea-russia/ ) his actions in ukraine . 
  what moscow does to ukraine makes a lot of people mad , ukrainians and russians .

  the first one . 
   at home , this intervention looks to be the one of the most unpopular decisions putin has ever made . 
  the kremlin 's own pollster released a survey on monday that showed 73 % of russians reject it . 
  in phrasing its question to 1600 respondents across the country , the state-funded sociologists at wciom were clearly trying to get as much support for the intervention as possible : `` should russia react to the overthrow of the legally elected authorities in ukraine ? '' they asked . 
  only 15 % said yes -- hardly a national consensus . 
  those bastards deleted the page !, 
  had to use the wayback machine to fetch the page from 13 juli 2014 . 
  this is a [ state-run researchcenter ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russian_public_opinion_research_center ) , ofcourse they deleted it :, 
  do you speak english at home or hebrew ? 
  i never knew !, 
  i just googled it , and found out that there are only 5 million speakers worldwide . 
  and it seems that yiddish and hebrew are diffrent languages . 
  interesting , thx !, 
  can someone make anything of this ? 
  been there , beautiful country , warm people . 
  this is something we most certainly can not deny . 
  the thing is that the western media portrays it as a genocide done by russian authorities to the ukrainian peoples . 
  but not only the ukrainains suffered ; a lot of russians and other ethnic groups suffered from these mistakes . 
  furthermore , stalin was not russian and he was the only one in charge . 
  thank you for your kind words . 
  i made a mirror for you . 
  yeah , his rhetoric is , sadly , kinda agressive . 
  he should know himself that the ukrainian peoples have nothing to do with it ... = /, 
  but never the less , it is a serious concern , and i think the dutch would really appreciate it if the ukrainains helped to find a solution to this problem . 
  i think you can find more on the situation on a few english-dutch news sites :, 
  both republics decreed to stop paying taxes to kiev . 
  all businesses on the territory of donbass have been mandated to start paying taxes to the republics . 
  however , this proposition immediately met with the oligarchs ' resistance . 
  this is understandable of course -- not only the oligarchs in question were the supporters of the kiev maidan , but any oligarch paying taxes to donetsk and lugansk instead of kiev , would be labeled a traitor and separatist and his assets in other regions of ukraine , as well as any assets in the us and eu ( and all oligarchs have lots of those ) , would be under threat of confiscation . 
   rich-tax is the worst idea ever . 
  because oligarchs most of the time have second citizenship , which means they can easily leave russia at any moment . 
  is that the reason why people do n't vote for the communist party anymore , or are there other reasons that i am missing ? 
  if the privatization of the 90s was just an abstruse to steal money , then what makes the recent privatazation of 2011-2015 any diffrent ? 
  do n't really like [ chubais ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/15/pn-meeting-profsojuz-1998-chubais.jpg ) ... 
  do n't you think that they will simply relocate their businesses abroad , which will lead to unemployment and perhaps a brain drain ? 
  although roscosmos has some ambitious ideas , they , sadly , keep getting postponed or cancelled . 
  i really hope that the [ nationalisation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russian_federal_space_agency#2013-2015_reorganization_of_the_russian_space_sector ) wil help . 
  i really admire the achievements of russia and it shows how good they are , as they are used to this day , but is n't this , once again , another invention that was made during the soviet union that russia is praysing to this day ? 
  is n't it time to start inventing again ? 
  from i heard , and understood correctly , it 's making a negative diffrerence in the life of an average person ... is there something the people can do about it ? 
  the soviet union had one of the best , if not the best , healthcare and medical technologies/techniques in the world . 
  and above all ; it was free !, 
  looking at this makes me sad . 
  there are atleast 6 diffrent conspiracy theories , one of which may have been fabricated by the kgb . 
  the former kgb archivist vasili mitrokhin indicated in 1999 that hunt was made part of a fabricated conspiracy theory disseminated by a soviet `` active measures '' program designed to discredit the cia and the united states . 
  but there is still a lot of skepticism surrounding this , for it were his words and there was no hard evidence . 
  definitely !, 
  and so is trump . 
  one day , when the kremlim stops it 's own idiocracy . 
  is this still considered news ? 
  everyone should know by now that russian pilots do n't know how to navigate . 
  also the kremlin and russian nationalists have a ego that 's way to big for russia only , that explains why they ca n't say sorry or respect their neighbours . 
  ever read the orthodox bible ?
