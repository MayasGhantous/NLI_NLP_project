  it says : intrude the airspace of thy neighbour . 
  the world just does n't understand the `` russian soul '' . 
  as a russian i am celebrating . 
  hopefully now we can finally say sorry and start being friendly towards europe , us and more importantly ; the people in ukraine and our own people . 
  what is this bullcrap ? 
  can you come up with sources ? 
  sanders : '' [ we need new ` nato ' that includes russia ] ( https://www.rt.com/usa/322770-sanders-democratic-socialism-fdr/ ) '', 
  clinton : '' [ we need to try to set up and enforce a no-fly zone to try to stop the outflow of refugees ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-syria-russia_5614695de4b0fad1591a0574 ), 
  only christie ( no-fly zone for the russians in syria ) , kasich ( punch russia in the nose ) and huckabee were pretty negative about russia and/or putin . 
  but they do n't score that good in the polls . 
   and i think you need to fix your corruption problem asap . 
  so do we . 
  let me guess , you are anti-russia ? 
   easy : if you were born in the country , you have the right to the basic income . 
  does n't matter if you 're a purple unicorn born from a dolphin and a giraffe who both come from antarctica . 
  as long as you 're born in the basic-income-country , only you get the right to have a basic income , not your parents . 
  is n't georgia trying to prosecute saakashvili ? 
  equatorial guinea has by far the most executions per capita . 
  2nd place is iran and 3th place is the good ol' buddy of the west ; [ saudi arabia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/capital_punishment_by_country#numbers_executed_in_2014 ) . 
  oh not this again . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/kdj7zer.png ) i really hope that reuters is making a mistake . 
  according to the [ syrian observatory for human rights ] ( http://www.siasat.com/news/monitor-says-russian-syria-strikes-kill-2100-890401/ ) , russian airstrikes took lives of 710 civilians until now . 
  you should understand by now that you ca n't have criticism about russia around here , it 's our [ safe-space ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxqkxxbqj_u ) from the rest of the evil-western-propaganda internet . 
  you 're right , he will get 100 % of `` votes '' . 
  if you know what i mean . 
  imagine the uk saying such things about the british empire and it 's colonies . 
  you mean [ computer animation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/timeline_of_computer_animation_in_film_and_television#1960s-1970s ) ? 
  an us invention ? 
  oh watch out !, 
  [ reality ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/vladimir-putin/12054164/vladimir-putins-annual-press-conference-2015-live.html ) might invade your [ safe-space ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxqkxxbqj_u ) . 
  russian troops simply bomb everything . 
  from isis to [ civilians ] ( http://www.siasat.com/news/monitor-says-russian-syria-strikes-kill-2100-890401/ ) . 
  it does n't matter what they bomb , as long as it 's in syria . 
  it was a colony of the russian empire . 
  just like india was of the uk . 
   putin needs to do something smart now . 
  that would be new . 
  i was thinking the same thing , that 's why i shared it here to see what your views are . 
  the guy who filmed this is being accused in the comment section of creating propaganda video 's for north korea . 
  but this guy has visited more countries , so i doupt that this is a north korean propaganda state channel . 
  i quote him :, 
   it 's interesting how people post messages claiming that my guide is a north korean elite , top 1 % , etc. . . etc. . . 
  i 've know this north korean guide since she was a junior rookie joining the travel company and have seen how she developed her english very quickly as she interacts with foreigners almost on a daily basis . 
  there are plenty of americans visiting the country and yes ... tourism does have a positive impact on the society as their locals are now more free to interact with foreigners . 
  unfortunately , such positive news is always conveniently left out and never reported . 
  what are your thoughts about it ? 
  could you read my comment on taehoon above and share your opinion about it ? 
  i 'm very interested in what others think about that . 
  overall everything is much cheaper in russia , for example consumer prices including rent in new york , ny are [ 223.86 % higher ] ( http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_cities.jsp?country1=russia&amp;country2=united+states&amp;city1=saint+petersburg&amp;city2=new+york%2c+ny ) than in saint petersburg . 
  furthermore :, 
  most russians own their apartment . 
  basic utilities ; electricity , heating , water , internet , etc are about 100 dollars a month . 
  most russian families have a [ dacha ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dacha ) ; a little house in the countryside with a patch of land on which they grow their own food . 
  alcohol , tobacco and russian products are dirt cheap in russia compared to western products which are about the same price as in europe/us . 
  so all the basic needs are fullfilled . 
  all the money you earn , you mostly spend on luxury products . 
  take a look [ here ] ( http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/country_result.jsp?country=russia ) for more prices . 
  in britain it would be called chav fm ; a radiostation for football hooligans . 
  i was actually wondering where everyone is from and lived atm . 
  i myself am 1/2 russian , 1/4 ukrainian and 1/4 roma born in dnepropetrovsk , ukraine living in germany . 
  the thing is that china does not want an unified korea , because there are tons of us troops and military bases stationed in south korea . 
  that would mean that us forces would border china and chances are that korea will join nato . 
  just look at how russia responded when nato got to close to them . 
  i 'm not very keen om vox . 
  they jump on the [ sensationalist ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/media_coverage_of_north_korea#sensationalism ) bandwagon en recite totally made up or blown out of proportion items about north korea ( among other countries ) . 
  they are very biased , opinion-shaping/manipulative ; clearly [ pro-democrats ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sc3_v7qyq4 ) , [ pro-us ] ( https://youtu.be/gu8rqwh_qtc?t=168 ) and pro-nato . 
  wow , it would be even faster to just reinstall the game . 
  ( girl ), 
  a lot of politics there lately as well . 
  i 've noticed that most people there are europeans who love to bash the us , russia , india , china and the middle east . 
  i went there to laugh , not to be offended . 
  thank you for this great explanation . 
  i also want to say that i find a language with a lot of loanwords to be more worldly and it shows that its able to adjust . 
  basically she took bribes . 
  are you going to do this weekly ? 
  it 's pretty cool . 
  she gets slaughtered . 
  could n't they send/invite someone who speaks proper english and knows his/her shit ? 
  but he and al jazeera did and still [ does ] ( http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/iraq.html ) condemn the us invasion . 
  your whataboutism has no power here . 
  if the us would nuke venezuela , russia woul n't have the right to do the same in ukraine . 
  this is whataboutism on whataboutism . 
  whataboutseption . 
  oh come on . 
  i 'll be downvoted into oblivion but i do n't care ;,
