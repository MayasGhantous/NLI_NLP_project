  this guy gets it, 
  arguing with a russian nationalist is like arguing with a wall . 
  the sources you provide are always irrelevant and/or western propaganda to them and you 're a paid `` washington troll '' . 
  did you seriously just remove his post because you do n't agree with his founded arguments ? 
  how much does washington pay you for these comments ? 
  all your sources are irrelevant or western propaganda . 
  the fall of the oil prices is good for the russian economy . 
  there are no russians in ~ ~ ukraine ~ ~ russia , because they are there on holiday , so they might be there but they are not !, 
  / lol, 
  `` moderate rebels '', 
  i think that the fact that [ western countries ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/corruption_perceptions_index#/media/file:transparency_international_2014.png ) tend to have less corruption is because of their mentality , which is a leftover from protestantism . 
  western europeans tend to be more `` in the middle '' , self-controlled and more einzelg\u00e4ngers , in contrast to russians who attach great importance to family values , emotions and tend to be more socially engaged . 
  friends and family are the most important thing in their lives so they tend to give them privileges , which causes corruption . 
  in this perspective , it are not the russians who are exceptional , but western europe . 
  when it comes to homosexuality and lgbt rights in russia overall , i think that russia is still pretty mild compared to india , the middle east or africa , and i think that if putin would be pro-lgbt his approval rating would drop ; do n't forget that the west had a sexual revolution in 1970s , something [ most of the rest of the world did n't have ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lgbt_rights_at_the_united_nations#/media/file:world_laws_pertaining_to_homosexual_relationships_and_expression.svg ) and therefore most russians are very prudish and not keen to such ideas . 
  russia had a huge identity crisis in the 90s , people where ashamed to call themselves russians . 
  now these people are creating a new `` russian identity '' ; it 's pretty conservative , nationalistic and religious , but soon this will fade and a secularization followed by a sexual revolution will find it 's way . 
  yeah , indeed . 
  it 's all so rash and way to short . 
  niicceeeee !, 
  the whole world does n't revolve around ukraine . 
  all countries have their own interests and problems to solve . 
  what is it with both sides , russians and ukrainians , exploiting one incident to the max and pointing fingers at each other . 
  to me it sometimes seems that you guys are more interested in blaming russia for all your suffering instead of actually working on progress in your country . 
  it 's like cheering for your sports team from your lazy couch . 
  funny how my post went from +7 to -1 . 
  what are these people trying to say ? 
  that the world ** does ** revolve around ukraine ? 
  a dollar or 2 less leads to '' * only * '' about 120-320 dollars a month . 
  that could be your rent in some eu countries . 
  going out and helping the economy by starting up your own business for example seems like a better idea than staying on the internet and shitposting russia 24/7 . 
  furthermore , what happens that happens , but what most ukrainians do is not go to work in lvov because there are `` russian backed seperatists '' in donetsk , that you do n't need anyways !, 
  ( you said so yourselves many times ), 
  the same goes to russians who such putin 's dick , so do n't get me wrong . 
  not that it matters cause everyone who does n't share your opinion is a `` kgb agent '' anyways . 
  posting from zaporizhia btw , have fun downvoting me into oblivion . 
  george soros is also sponsoring the pro-ukraine association agreement camp in the netherlands . 
  he donated 200,000 euro . 
  i think that the dutch should decide for themselves without any foreign influence . 
  at first i thought that reddit was a diverse open platform with a lot of different peoples that have different ideas who debate eachother . 
  but to me this shows that reddit is a select group of people , who mostly share the same ideas . 
  unless these statistics are wrong ofcourse ... 
  do n't get me wrong , i am pro-sanders , but there is no one to show me the other side of the coin here on reddit .

  this one is live updated :, 
  well , that 's cnn for ya . 
  this i also interesting btw :, 
  i know that most of you do n't care and i wo n't change anything with this `` open letter '' , but i just do n't know anymore what to think , what to feel or who i am . 
  and i need to write it off my chest . 
  some background information : i was born in 1988 , dnepropetrovsk , ukrainian ssr . 
  my mother is russian , my father is ukrainian . 
  we moved to germany when i was 8 years old . 
  people are not very keen to foreigners here . 
  i was always called a russian , and i simply accepted that . 
  i have family in russia and ukraine , i visited my family in ukraine recently and it really broke when i saw and heard what is happening there . 
  i am being torn apart from the inside . 
  should i be ashamed for being `` russian '' ? 
  or should i be ashamed for being `` ukrainian '' ? 
  i always knew that both countries scored high on the corruption scale and always had politicians that did n't represent the interest of their peoples , whom they robbed and neglected . 
  i thought that russians and ukrainians fought the same evil as brothers and sisters . 
  but now , they are fighting eachother . 
  i just do n't want to believe this , it feels like a nightmare from which i just ca n't wake up . 
  western social media [ humiliate ] ( https://www.google.nl/search?q=ukrainian+broken&espv=2&biw=1280&bih=604&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=x&ved=0ahukewi6ktvxqlzjahxcfw8khy9gdi8q_auibigb#tbm=isch&q=only+in+russia ) russians and when i watch ukrainian media , russians are portrayed like lucifer himself . 
  not just [ putin ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op0dfh6m3wc ) , or the kremlin , or [ moscow ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp8pmgpw_ai ) ; but all the russians !, 
  this feels like a personal attack , that really hurts . 
  trust me , russians do n't support putin , or his corrupted gang of oligarchs , on such a mass scale as the state media portays it , more than 85 % of russians do n't accept his takeover of [ crimea ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_anti-war_protests_in_russia ) , and everyone is still waiting for [ change ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9msmcgjdr24 ) . 
  there might be some people brainwashed by the state media and do n't forget the kremlin 's [ troll army ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/web_brigades ) . 
  both media apparatuses are putting peoples against eachother . 
  i really hope that the revolution in ukraine was not in vain and that she deals with all the corruption , gets the economy on track and makes the lives of ordinary ukrainians one of the happiest in the world , who one day might help the russians do the same , and become family once again . 
  i want to come back [ home ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eotec4wca40 ) . 
  i was just wondering . 
  since the collapse of the soviet union , the governments started to mass-privatise everything , this has concentrated a lot of wealth at a few people and created oligarchs like khodorkovsky and berezovsky . 
  in october 2010 the russian government approved a plan to privatize a wide range of state property from energy to agriculture and banking to transportation . 
   do russians support the mass privatisation of their public utilities ? 
   what is your opinion on the 2011-2015 privatization plan ? 
   why did russia choose to switch so drastically from a planned economy to a free market economy ? 
   do you think it would be a good idea to present a rich-tax , or do you think that the oligarchs will leave russia and wo n't invest anything in the country ? 
  edit : if people are so negative when it comes to privatization then why does n't the communist and/or socialist party get a lot of sympathy ? 
  i want to update the outdated parts of my pc , and i honestly do n't know where to begin , there are so many unfamiliar possibilies out there these days . 
  i would love to get some advice !,

   ** graphics card : ** nvidia geforce gtx 460 1gb, 
   ** storage ** : 1tb hdd, 
   ** cooling ** : very noisy , stock fan . 
  i want to be able to play games like fallout 4 , gta 5 or cities : skylines on high settings 60fps 1080p . 
  it does n't have to be a fancy over-the-top thing . 
  i have a budget of around 300-500 euro , i am okey with buying second-hand and with shipments from europe overall . 
  my current hdd is fine , i have a pretty decent monitor , mouse and keyboard . 
  ** my suggestions/questions : **, 
   ** processor : ** update it to a i5 or i7 ( quad-core ) ? 
  which one ? 
   ** graphics card : ** leave it as it is for now ? 
   ** ram ** : add a 8gb stick for a 12gb total ? 
  which one ? 
   ** storage ** : i would be happy with dirt-cheap 100gb minimum ssd . 
  which one ?
