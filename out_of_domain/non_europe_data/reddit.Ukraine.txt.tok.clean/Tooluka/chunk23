  even cerberus and odin have 3k queues . 
  ( just kidding ), 
  fucking this should be a popup in game , in biggest font there is . 
  and fucking show this every login . 
  did the same , went from bard to astro . 
  msq will wait a bit . 
  filthy sloppiness . 
  i 'm now epileptic . 
  thanks . 
  it 's like all your namedays came at once , but kinda sloppeh . 
  i have only ast now and it is in 5x levels . 
  i like ast kit , you can heal , fiddle with cards , two stances to pick . 
  it is interesting now , do n't know about top 0.1 % . 
  `` stormboot '' should fit, 
  how is the ip is not in trouble ?

  `` any rights '' , `` assets '' , `` all copyright and related '' , etc. 
  it is long list and there is basically everything . 
  seems to be a good idea and wo n't affect game too much . 
  thread below - `` s rank okina - ruby sea ( omega ) '' 1 hour ago, 
  highly suspicious, 
  now this is a good fanart , fit for main ffxiv subreddit . 
  notice the absence of words like commission , my girlfriend , follow on deviantart , prices and general adoration in case the fanart is mediocre . 
  2500 was two days ago on cerberus , or maybe even more later in the evening . 
  dropoff was visible only yesterday with small 1000 queue . 
  they have a specific place for this - / r/ffxivart . 
  main sub in my opinion is not a place for mass produced mediocre fanart adverts . 
  yes , artists need practice and money to live and they already have communities for this . 
  totally forgot this , my bad  . 
  also `` maintenance '' , `` obligatory '' and `` au ` ra '' . 
  it was close to curing , but then putin shot down mh17 with scientists who were working on it . 
  se actually have balls . 
  whole eu dc is affected , even new worlds sometimes . 
  not everyone is afking , so no , not all of us . 
  i welcome this `` boot-to-the-asshole '' feature . 
  if you are playing at 6am or 8am in the morning and also ca n't read notices in launcher then yes , get back to the queue . 
  only a few redditors . 
  other are actually playing this game , not chatting in forums . 
  news at eleven !, 
  you know , outside of default country there are other countries ? 
  in fact there are whole datacenters dedicated for billions of people outside of glorious usa . 
  eu dc is completely overpopulated , including the new worlds . 
  no it wo n't , at most it will affect people playing at 6am or guys from very distant timezone ( e.g. 
  eu on primal or us on chaos etc. ) . 
  for me and other who play in primetime and not afk it is a pure win with literally zero negative impact . 
  my point is not many are playing in primetime + -12 hours . 
  majority online at that time are afkers and they will be booted . 
  others will see maintenance window and will suffer 10 min offline and much smaller queue . 
  i would n't mind this happening in my primetime if you want to know . 
  crazy, 
  1 ) whole server in the morning , so very few actual people will be online . 
  2 ) it is only 10 min downtime, 
  3 ) queue right after the event will be very fast, 
  4 ) queue in the evening of that day will be shorter, 
  yeah , you buy a big box labeled `` server '' on the side , plug it into your older server with a cable then run a simple `` expand server '' command and voila - it is all better . 
  how much more simple can it be , goddamn it square ? 
  you mean that ca n't just plug another server in and it will work ? 
  so all those movies were lies ? 
  no , it ca n't be !, 
  we need a morbol extreme primal, 
  138,757 players enjoying stormboot, 
  2153 crybabies in this thread, 
   people who are worried that their job might end up being unwanted in pfs for wrong reasons, 
  i always felt that this works like self fulfilling prophecy - the more people ask if their class `` suck '' the more they reinforce memory that `` that class suck , i remember reading it on reddit '' . 
  i was starting the game in winter , when everyone has done 3.5 already and were finishing animas and top armor sets . 
  in my opinion - no , it is not worth rushing . 
  a ) there are hundreds of new players everywhere, 
  b ) this game supports `` downscaling '' of high level characters in low level dungeons , so your friends , guild etc. 
  can join you and have fun together, 
  c ) it is not that long to catch up , and when you do you 'll come here to complain about lack of content ( i 'm exaggerating ofc ), 
  d ) it is basically jrpg with multiplayer , if you do n't enjoy just playing it at your own pace it is highly likely that may not enjoy activities at cap . 
  there are 3-4 side-quest storilines that are good and long . 
  they will be available at lvl50 but will have regular simple sidequest icons :, 
  all 24man raids and 8man `` raids '' have good storylines . 
  beast tribe quests ( lvl47 + ) have decent storylines ( some are very good ) . 
  wow , crybabies were actually wrong , how surprising . 
  we have 3 kinds of people here - salty , acidic and totally inert , 
  8 eu servers out of 10 . 
  only two servers were more or less queueless . 
  in half a year never seen elitists or people complaining about elitists in game . 
  usually people make comment about using some skill and person tries to do that . 
  when i 'm clearly the worst performer in 8man the worst i heard is `` move ( username ) '' or `` oh god ... '' ( after a dozen of deaths ) . 
  ditch complainers , be more civil yourself ( in case your are not yet ) , find more pleasant community . 
  exactly , not all 10 eu server were having long queues , only 8 of them were . 
  its a transport film , it is not intended to be used by customers . 
  it also lacks any oleophobic coating and looks like crap if left on the screen . 
  spigen rugged armour and no glass . 
  jerryrigeverything video show lack of sealant at the joints ( unlike ip68 or wr5 phones ) so i highly doubt that it is more waterproof than any regular phone without ipxx rating . 
  lol . 
  i just turned upside down my op3t and there it is  . 
  nice find . 
  bonus is a nice way to distinguish switchers from genuine sprouts in df . 
  play something other that progression 4man duties . 
  i started healer in sb and some fights in potd ( with kamikaze team ) and 8man were so intense ... 
  i remember when i asked fc to run it with cutscenes ( still faceroll easy but at least in a sane order , unlike the speedrun ) and half of them were like `` oh , i never got to watch them , nice '' , 
  2 arr castrums is the part of the game where community decided `` yes , we are mean to sprouts and we do n't care '' . 
  other parts of the game are better and community is very good usually . 
  why not both ? 
  do n't leave immediately , wait for instance popup to expire , maybe even a few times , then leave , 
  i like how it is now .
