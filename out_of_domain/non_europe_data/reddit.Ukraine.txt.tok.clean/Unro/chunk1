  he 's just like to play with himself ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  no , you ca n't, 
  add : hey !, 
  you fixed him !, 
  that 's not fair dude . 
  at least i still have this beautiful man, 
  how is she baiting ? 
  sitting on undock with suspect mark ? 
  and you would n't tell me about them ? 
  so we can both cowardly sit in cloak afraid of drop somebody ? 
  redeemer . 
  same shit happened with me . 
  i tried everything in eve in the last 4 years . 
  now i 'm sitting here , with 65mil skill points and without any idea what to do in this game . 
  although times when i bought my first drake was amazing . 
  still remember this . 
  send halp , plz . 
   look at that ** [ fail contract ] ** lmao, 
  10 more extended downtimes and i might be able to teach defender missiles to 5, 
  ability to link bookmarks like ship fit or overview settings, 
  still better than transfer them through trade or containers . 
  future , stars , warp-drives ... and coordinates transfer manually like they printed on a piece of paper, 
  guys . 
  guys listen . 
  what if . 
  guys listen !, 
  what if ... ccp implements ability to link bookmarks in chat like the ship fittings or an overview settings . 
  huh ? 
  only me ? 
  eve is kill, 
  deserved win for ahq, 
  thereisnourflevel, 
  since they are all clones i think they simply do n't need that ` parts ', 
  login . 
  create new character, 
  ` generate random outfit ', 
  well ... at least her mouth and hands where they should be . 
  did he killed that lucian or what ? 
  and so it 's begins . 
  #makeyoutubegreatagain #gradeaundera 2016, 
  zion cant play other champions and without him carrying clg is just a bunch of wards . 
  deserved loss for clown 9, 
  what a whiny little kid , huh .

  inglip summoned, 
  happy anniversary pcmr !, 
  may we win all the games !, 
  dick hardy, 
  thank you !, 
  a daily reminder what huhi is occupying a valuable spot in the team, 
  what a hell is that last tp ` flank ' was ? 
  can we bench darshan and huhi already ? 
  eve is officially ded . 
  as a pro-player you 're have to be versatile . 
  if you 're able to play ` good ' with only one champion then you 're a bad ` pro ' - player and deserve a loss . 
  [ time passes . 
  some things stay the same . 
  3 out of 5 of them are from ukraine tho .
