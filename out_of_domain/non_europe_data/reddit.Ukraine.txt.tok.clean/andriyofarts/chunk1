there are also the same pages for psycho & dead inside, 
  yes , of course . 
  but yet another point is that ... 
  `` you know times are bad when we 're happy to go back to sounding like black holes & revelations . 
  back when that album launched myself and a lot of this board were pissed ... when smbh launched people literally thought it was a joke . 
  and starlight was not a good follow up single . 
  and here we have starlight 2 and people are ok with it lol . 
  shows you how bad the last 6 years have been for muse fans . '', 
  anyway , it 's all about own opinions . 
  take it easier, 
  now it 's even [ ** more strange ** ] ( http://muse-cdn.warnerartists.com/siteimg/newslistbig/ugc-1/fullnews/news/1647/2422_original.jpg ), 
  yes he does, 
  i guess they just cut off first 7 seconds of ambient noise from that , so it starts straight with the speech now, 
  just a speculation concerning whole song structure based on cuts from `` making of '', 
  the song is amazing , pure gold . 
  dead_star_heavy verses , micro_cuts _ opera-like choruses ( with astonishing falsetto ) + in_your_world_tight second part . 
  so fucking love it , fuck fuck fuck i 'm out of words, 
  * squeals and heavy breaths *, 
  yes , please , another drone right here, 
  nobody knows , most likely that never gon na happen . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bivu6lt1r2y ), 
  definitely [ pinkpop 2004 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjr9np00s4q ) . 
  drones & buzz, 
  but , hey , they are not easy-to-listen-songs ( along with defector , but still ) . 
  i mean , years ago i found it hard to turn in oos during one student party i was into ( the record was considered too complicated for a party and so on ) . 
  and now while i listen to drones i find it quite non-so-appropriate for partying and whatever , because just after pop-okay dead inside & mercy between yet unplesant `` for the masses '' psycho it starts to sound as weird/uncomfortable for background listening as oos does . 
  mainly not dat hard at all , but still pretty uncomfortable . 
  so there 's nothing wrong for reapers + the handler ( + defector + the globalist ) to be fan-only favourites . 
  just because they at least deserve it so much, 
  uprising so early . . 
  defector to follow jfk ?!? 
  but we 'll wait patiently for the sign, 
  pm 'd you, 
  video :, 
  check https://www.reddit.com/message/messages, 
  it must be there ( mine sent message is ),

  crowd clapping with normal timing during d&b jam - now that 's something !, 
  now it 's dead problematique, 
  as far as i remember , dom always loved ni\u0418, 
  in that case you should really check [ this out ] ( https://www.facebook.com/olympicbellamy/photos_stream ) , 
  it 's a direct reference to a song [ `` not gon na get us '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hl-n9oojcs ) ( '' \u041d\u0430\u0441 \u043d\u0435 \u0434\u043e\u0433\u043e\u043d\u044f\u0442 '' in original ) by a pseudo-lesbian duo called tatu . 
  years ago it was ** overwhelmingly ** popular among teens in russia . 
  so that t-shirt actually combines quote from kinda lgbt hymn with image of leader of the ~ ~ world terrorist ~ ~ state with official homophobic position . 
  as an ukrainian citizen myself , i find that combination really-really funny . 
  [ just silliness .

   that fanmail getting weirder and weirder and weirder ( c ), 
  also lol at a small handful of hipsters easily smashing through packed and loaded police/government forces, 
  the globalist from heavy part :, 
  found some alternate periscope streams : revolt - https://www.periscope.tv/carolinamillan/1vaxromjpmrkl the beginning of the globalist - https://www.periscope.tv/carolinamillan/1bdxybdmkpnkx, 
  here come the cervesas : https://www.periscope.tv/w/1oykamkzrlrkb ( from 12:22 ), 
  that line `` behold my transformation '' onwards makes it totally creepy . 
  [ beer ? 
  `` cervezas edit '' means that shouts cervezas are present on the record/whatever . 
  those became a meme/joke here because of their [ annoying/hilarious appearance ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/muse/comments/3t7v4f/17_november_2015_mexico_city_mexico_night_1_live/cx48axc ) at the globalist live debut during one periscope stream,

  somewhere around the zepp one . 
  [ schedule is 100 % correct ] ( https://pp.vk.me/c630826/v630826832/3aaf9/-mhbyn-5vkm.jpg ) , 4 + more hours until muse time, 
  no , it 's just a new kind of spam on youtube, 
  periscope : https://www.periscope.tv/w/1djgxwlebzdkz, 
  `` madness -  dead inside '' is kinda letdown after `` butterflies & hurricanes -  assassin '', 
  but still , in a row ? 
  they sound just too like each other . 
  anyway , them both + starlight & mercy ( and overall growing interest into stoner genre ) made me make a decision not to buy tickets to this gig . 
  i attended muse in ukraine 9 years ago , i witnessed tab , b&h , sunburn , ss , nb and others and it was awesome . 
  but now . . 
  yet , b&h -  assassin was so-o-o-o sweet, 
  i totally agree here .
