  wish they kept this further on, 
  [ that t-shirt totally reminds of early take a bow instrumental visuals ] ( https://youtu.be/mg0dc77k0qq?t=7m30s ), 
  that moment when you used to wrap your infant son on yourself and play reapers in loud volume to make him fall asleep , 
  fucking amazing , adore them , ca n't wait for `` you 're all invited '' lp, 
  [fb.com/toniyevych/posts/1123370634384702] ( https://www.fb.com/toniyevych/posts/1123370634384702 ), 
  i had this video done a while ago and now official sound made it kind of complete . 
  in this particular case it 's much more fun to watch and listen rather than just to listen , so i hope you like it , 
  last year 's christmas present from the band, 
  my high expectations are completely fulfilled , another great record from a great band with the right attitude  zajebi\u015bcie !, 
  that gig ^ on-the-screenshots though . 
  [ this ] ( https://youtu.be/nkqthttkof8?t=11m42s ) pib moment , [ this ] ( https://youtu.be/nkqthttkof8?t=19m33s ) agitated madness and [ this ] ( https://youtu.be/nkqthttkof8?t=37m19s ) outro to showbiz , oh my . 
  hey , huge thanks for this , finally [ official one ] ( http://warnerchappell.com/song-details/ww%20008757419%2000/7d7044ce-e698-4726-8237-787d97bef8c7 ) for real , yay . 
  ps : sign of drones instrumentals to come #soon ? 
  why instrumental , there are some nice vocals too ( along with beautiful sounds of ` sopilka '  ) ? 
  bonus info : original master at band 's bandcamp contains some distracting ` clicks ' , for everyone intrested there is nice and clear [ ** remastered version of the whole `` polynseeds '' album ** ] ( https://robustfellow.bandcamp.com/album/rbf-005-bomg-2014-polynseeds-remaster ) which is soooo fucking good . 
  what a gem , huge thanks for this !,

  * 20/5 is 4 , it does n't make any sense *, 
  now even sooner, 
  something personal-related ? 
  like : `` dig down into yourself ... 
  yourse-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-elf !!!, 
  ( dead star riffage , sh-sh-sh-sh , ow , screw that predictions ), 
  here it is : https://soundcloud.com/user-471282185/dig-downish, 
  that 's a * new kind of * drum & bass jam , you know . 
  and , btw , they can totally play execution commentary like that . 
  but they wo n't, 
  undisclosed desires -  dig down -  madness , * what a ride !, 
  i guess , for the first time you will be impressed anyway , so do n't overthink about it and just have some fun with your girlfriend on your birthday , 
  origin of asymmetry, 
  they 're not modern old muse , but still very decent band of their own . 
  videos :, 
  what can i say , love her doing doom metal , thanks for sharing this !, 
  ~ ~ live stream from the stage : https://www.periscope.tv/w/1oyjabgwaewxb~~ no more, 
  there is [ another recording ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=412y61whs_k ) , btw . 
  and yes , it 's ~ ~ them crooked vultures ~ ~ great as fuck, 
  not the actual event , you know, 
  i meant , that live thing was n't actually ` live ' , so it was n't the actual event . 
  as event , not as ep title , 
  ** [ yep ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=plz1i-yek6fqi5iszzp9rexoxg48xe_q8z ) ** ^ some_multicams_there, 
  * feeling good * about this, 
  you 've heard the whole thing ? 
  for me it hits right from the first track `` spun '' , slow , heavy and repetitive , almost crushing . 
  fits genre perfectly . 
  other unreleased songs are well-crafted from heavy & intense and calm & melodic segments in different proportions . 
  and in total it provides `` heavy_as_never_before '' chelsea wolfe 's work , what is definitely nice , 
  it was n't me  and downvoting `` for opinions '' may be explained with strong anticipation of that `` shitty doom '' line . 
  `` iron moon '' instantly hooked me , what an amazing song it was . 
  the whole album left a very good impression too . 
  but hiss spun is heavier and more consistent ( or less multigenic ) , so for me it definitely overtops abyss . 
  what i posted here is a direct link to youtube source in 720p quality [ ~ 1.15 gb ] . 
  not sure if it 'll stay available for long . 
  if not , use this mirror :,

  that will be available for 7 days only from right now . 
  ** [ not anymore , sorry ] **, 
  with all * heartfelt wishes * to copyright owners , who delete videos from youtube in no time , 
  ** upd 8.5.17 : all links are dead now , good luck with finding another sources !, 
  official web cast rip . 
  pretty decent overall , great camera work , outstanding sound/mix quality, 
  / u/fu11force , / u/redshoe1 first link was deleted from youtube by original uploader , the second one is gone dunno why :( no mirrors/sources left , try [ ** torrent link to 1080p rip ** ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/nin/comments/6qvpjb/is_anybody_on_dimeadozenorg_this_is_waiting_for/ ) ? 
  ( did n't check it by myself ), 
  no apologies needed , this performance gets deleted every time from as many sources as possible , so more mirrors are only good thing . 
  and thanks , because i finally managed to re-save this one for myself both in 360 & 720 , what a show !, 
  it 's from old south park : https://vimeo.com/79954057, 
  here you go , 360p rip : https://fex.net/#!640040847923, 
  as a massive stoner lover i say there is no stoner in fury , 
  and the best they 've done . 
  i would totally like to hear sludgy-doomy stoner muse once in a while . 
  the closest one of them in this field is prague , love it , 
  ps : i was thinking to start a crowdfunding campaign to make multicam edits for the whole thing , should i try ? 
  if i was able , i 'd do this on my own , but in current conditions i just ca n't allow myself to stop working for needed amount of time . 
  with no chat , that 's great , thanks !, 
  thats because it mixed from 3 sources : official instagram stream ( for bass sound ) in center channel + 2 different youtube sources for left/right channel . 
  and i always try to use best possible material, 
  i guess that user does n't want his footage to be used in multicams :(, 
  to / u/davevine - https://fex.net/#!337037430049, 
  such a let down , right ?

  `` blocked for region '' or what ? 
  works perfectly fine for me ( videos are not mine ), 
  not yet , i hope it 'll show up, 
  damn , that was fast, 
  updated it , now only 03 - villains of circumstance is missing . 
  these videos trend to dissapear though,

  upcoming ep announced, 
  so i was lurking [ warner chappel site ] ( http://uk.warnerchappell.com ) for some interesting muse stuff and found one interesting cover of assassin on [ song 's page ] ( http://uk.warnerchappell.com/song-details/ww008722344000 ), 
  you can listen to it in full [ --  on deezer < -- ] ( http://www.deezer.com/track/66406031 ) , really digging it 's arrangement and overall classical/electronic vibe . 
  upd : ** there 's a whole [ album of those covers ] ( http://www.deezer.com/album/6495654 ) **, 
  totally worth a listen . 
  this gestalt is finally closed . 
  from now on , i can safely let go my beloved_for_too_many_years muse for free-to-air voyage by the seas and oceans of their own decision . 
  i no longer have to hope or to be indignant about any questions regarding their further creativity , worrying about failures and rejoicing in achievements , etc. 
  you have made an incredible impact on my formation as a personality - that 's the case . 
  you have been something otherworldly-incredible for many years - that 's the case .
