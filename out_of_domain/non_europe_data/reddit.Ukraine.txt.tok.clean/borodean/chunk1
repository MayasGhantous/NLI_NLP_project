  okay , this post is getting downvoted . 
  what do you see confusing about it ? 
  why the downvotes ? 
  jesus , you 're continuing doing that . 
  what 's wrong with it ? 
  sorry for the offtopic posting . 
  i want to integrate to the community , but those complaining comments of mine are not relevant to the general topic . 
  so please downvote so it is kept hidden . 
  i do n't want to , i just want to know what are the community internal rules that made my valuable ( at least a bit ) post downvoted . 
  i do n't care anymore contributing any valuable content to the reddit , if it get 's threated like that . 
  get your shit together , people . 
  sure someone would . 
  but this behaviour makes no sense . 
  it has no point and dumb . 
  people share the info they 've created and it gets treated like that for some obscure reason . 
  and behaving like my salt is something not logical . 
  get your shits together , people . 
  normal social behaviour is a good thing to follow . 
  my point is that you have to buy 90 packs to craft those golden cards to get them refunded later . 
  i 've done the calculation , because lots of the people are going to do that , as far as i expect . 
  and why do you think it is n't obvious ? 
  damn , this / r gets me so salty of this unreasonable people . 
  yeah , i get downvoted for a post that has some valuable content and i was just wondering why it happened which does n't contradicts any of the community rules . 
  surely deserves some disgust from the community . 
  you should either add this to the rules or this is just retarded and undfriendly . 
  i 'm for the people 's right to vote against anything . 
  i 'm asking why they do so to improve later . 
  i do n't see any reason to downvote this question as its purpose is to improve the integration of myself to the community . 
  if you 've kept the normal ones then the first calculation in the post are the ones for ya . 
  it is absolutely inclusional . 
  jesus , why those people are so silly . 
  have you done your homework yet ? 
  okay , here am i whining . 
  why does the question `` why the downvotes '' and a corresponding thread causes the downvotes ? 
  ( and why this particular question , i suppose , would cause more ) . 
  people , this is ridiculous , this comment has some value . 
  small value , i suppose . 
  but you downvote it because you do n't like me for some reason without even explaining , making this actually valuable comment invisible to the casual readers who may be interested in it . 
  which particular answers do you mean ? 
  please be kind and help me being helpful for this community . 
  i feel so much frustrated to be so unwelcomed here . 
  that 's from a separate thread . 
  i feel sorry for behaving like that , but the downvotes correspond to the initial comment that was absolutely neutral . 
  why ? 
  the thread to gather all you anger is here : https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/5uiba3/why_is_this_gathering_the_downvotes/, 
  please , downvote it . 
  it is generally irrelevant to hearthstone . 
  still , i 'm sorry for usign offensive wordings . 
  i should have kept myself polite answering those comments even though they felt offensive to me . 
  that 's not a behaviour educated people would follow . 
  however , i 've been downvoted for a post which actually had no offence but a somehow valuable information before i 've even started my offence . 
  why that ever happend ? 
  guys , i want to be helpful and friendly to all of ya . 
  i do n't like people offending me as much as you do . 
  what should i improve to keep it up ? 
  and why do you downvote something which could be valuable to the readers ? 
  yes , i 've meant how much you 'd need to dust to craft the golden ones for a full redund if you have those . 
  thought it was obvious . 
  i 'm sorry for the incovinience ( still feel a little bit offended of how the community perceived me because of that tiny inconviniece ) . 
  i 'm sorry for that . 
  i 've insulted people because i 've felt offended by all those downvotes i 've seen no rationale behind myself . 
  this is not how i should 've behaved . 
  however , why the original post which was absolutely neutral was downvoted ? 
  if you feel my excuses are not sufficient , please tell me so .
