  i do n't want to be the one who trolls the community or being a toxic person to communicate with . 
  even though i 've made offences afterwards , that original post itself had nothing but a little valueable info . 
  why it was treated like that ? 
  but you 're genuinely the first one who points this to me . 
  why people downvote a thing they do n't understand instead of asking the poster to edit it ? 
  why do n't they see a reason of myself being offended ? 
  i 've shared what i 've had , and got treated like that . 
  feeling newbie in an unwelcome environment . 
  what was the rationale behind it ? 
  ( a genuine question , no sarcasm . ), 
  what bots ? 
  i 'm kinda new to reddit commenting , have no clue . 
  that 's true , but makes me feel unwelcome to post the personal findings . 
  trying to figure out why . 
  do n't relly care about the karma 'cause i expect the things to be shared to be beneficial to everyone .

  whoa , that 's like goebbels or ribbentrop unexpectedly dying in the middle of 1943 . 
  how can consecutive greetings be genuine ? 
  40 packs cost 760 ukrainian hryvnas now , and would cost 1299 by the end of march . 
  this is like a 58 % increase . 
  honestly , every game could be as expensive as people are going to pay for it . 
  have you kept any of the golden cards ? 
  what is your average arena score ? 
  for me , as a ukrainian , this letter is incredibly insulting and vulgar . 
  that 's why mage 's quest reward gives charge to all of your minions / s, 
  so was that a real kolento ? 
  are there any recordings of the match itself ? 
  could someone point me out on what is the amount of money needed to be spend to have the whole expansion ? 
  i love how he acts cheerful about kyiv 's worst menaces : furry costumed beggars and highways in the middle of the city . 
  what is the actual purpose of keeping the drop rates secret ? 
  kinda off topic , but if you 're an lgbt and are travelling to kyiv , here is a list of the friendly places : http://kyivpride.org/en/eurovision-2017/friendly-place/, 
  too bad kyiv as a whole is not a such place though . 
  also , his armpits !,

  i think blizzard should disallow unfriending people immediately after friending them - put a timeout of a one day , for example . 
  this should make this pattern of a bad behavior impossible . 
  you mean britishname complicated ? 
  and i 've once seen the same guy killed with a [ [ backtab ] ] . 
  i wonder if they 've fixed it already . 
  that is actually a pretty interesting challenge . 
  this is beautiful, 
  a technical question . 
  apart from the manual play testing , do you use any automated testing for the game mechanics and card interactions ? 
  how do you do that ? 
  on ios it 's $ , so one has the full variety of options , 
  the price could be as high as people are ready to pay . 
  that wo n't be smart for a company to not take an advantage of that . 
  do you automate your pack opening tracking somehow ? 
  or you can play a quest mage and capitalize on the problem . 
  whenever you discard your deck , draw a card .
