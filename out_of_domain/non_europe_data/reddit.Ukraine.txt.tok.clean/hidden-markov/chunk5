  the reason why 'em ergency state ' is not preferred at the moment is that by law announcing it leads to cancellation of elections . 
  you forgot the `` after we conquer usa '' part . 
  that piece of news appeared to be fake . 
  probably like this one . 
  what ? 
  law against russian language ? 
  i see you 've been watching tv . 
  edit . 
  for the downvoting guys . 
  there was never , ever any bills * against * russian language . 
  those are fiction . 
  fake . 
  never happened . 
  even more , never will . 
  aaand ? 
  when did they walk on the streets displaying firearms ? 
  i have missed something . 
  it was , and that 's why the repeal was vetoed . 
  what i am stressing here is there was never a ban on russian language . 
   that 's pretty much the only valid point, 
  well , i still consider violations of procedure and constitution quite important . 
  it 's about russian propaganda , i.e. 
  russian state channels . 
  it 's not the ` eastern brethren ' who are considered enemies , it 's the state that has annexed your territory . 
  again , it was not practically implemented , and passed with violations . 
  i did n't make that point . 
  i only did write this because i saw comments that mentioned ` ban of russian language ' yesterday on / r/worldnews , and that pissed me off . 
  no , it 's not . 
  the repeal is not ` against russian language ' . 
  what . 
  the actual . 
  fuck you 're talking about ? 
  hundreds of videos ? 
  checkpoints ? 
  what ? 
  bandera slogan , ` glory to ukraine ' ? 
  why this even gets upvoted ? 
   there 's hi-res photos of the other guys displayed right below the bearded guy , based on their gear like the vests and leg/arm protectors they look a lot more like ex-berkut : http://abload.de/img/ukr242khcvp.jpg http://i.imgur.com/ccbzsy2.jpg http://tiras.ru/uploads/posts/2014-01/1390210955_1390168218_soldaty.jpg, 
  most of the kramatorsk guys ca n't be ex-berkut , because there 's a requirement of having 100 kg in weight to be accepted in berkut , they do n't look like 100 kg . 
  also , the last photo is not berkut , but regular interior troops . 
  this is the first analysis that actually looks legit . 
  the photos in the profiles do match . 
  is hogan.js dead ? 
  great conky . 
  how did you do it ? 
  curiously enough , i posted this very same message about a year ago : http://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1d3m94/well_nice_to_meet_you_too_debian/, 
  it also scored about 900 upvotes . 
  i keep getting weird npm errors when building on ubuntu 14.04 . 
  if anyone managed to build under linux on amd64 , mind to share the binary ? 
  afaik , there 's a decentralisation law being considered . 
  it always worked for me previously,

  edit : [ solved ] ( https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/1814 ), 
  let ( n , + ) be a commutative monoid with unit element 0 and natural equality relation (  . 
  we define a successor function s : n \u2192 n as follows :, 
  \u2200 n \u2208 n. s ( n ) \u2260 0, 
  \u2200 a , b \u2208 n. s ( a ) = s ( b ) \u21d2 a = b, 
  if a is a set such that :, 
  0 is in a, 
  \u2200 n \u2208 n , n \u2208 a \u21d2 s ( n ) \u2208 a ,, 
  then a contains every n \u2208 n. 
  we then define operation ( + ) : n \u00d7 n \u2192 n recursively as follows :, 
  1 . a + 0 = a, 
  2 . a + s ( b ) = s ( a + b ),
