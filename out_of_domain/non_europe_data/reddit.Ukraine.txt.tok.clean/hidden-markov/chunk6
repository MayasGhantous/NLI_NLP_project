  let a = 53 , b = 25 . 
  it is easy to show by explicit evaluation of the above function that :, 
  53 + 25 = s ^ \u2218 25 ( 53 ) = 78 ( by construction of s ),

  has anyone already mentioned that this is the best thread ever ? 
  both in odessa and kyiv, 
  apparently yes . 
  where 's this video ? 
  afaik , the `` hobos '' , ng , are not on the frontline , they are securing the block posts . 
  the frontline guys from special interior forces are equipped well . 
  there is a white dot , it appears in a single frame just before the first flash : http://rowvid.com/?v=jk_-bgvckre, 
  they did . 
  sponsored by us dept ? 
  where did you see that ? 
   this site, 
  you 're funny , by no means this phrase implies that stopfake is financed by state dept. 
  kyiv-mohyla school of journalism mostly runs on huge tuition fees . 
  the initial funding grant was issued by renat akhmetov foundation . 
  but that 's school of journalism , stopfake is just couple of alumnis and fedchenko , experienced journalist and head of the school , who decided to do a good thing . 
  stopfake itself exists on donations . 
  source : i am a student at kyiv-mohyla academy . 
  also see how bayesian metrics perform compared to frequentist ones : http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/bogdan-kulynych/trials/blob/master/examples/benchmark.ipynb, 
  they never call it like that in ukraine though . 
  what 's the difference ? 
  ( non-native speaker here ), 
  the journalist called poroshenko a ` so-called president of ukraine ' . 
  russian journalism . 
  he was to be changed anyway . 
  contradicts the un numbers . 
  actually , the un statistics is quite obviously wrong for military casualties ( it states at least 15 terrorists and 80 ukrainian servicemen casualties ) . 
  stanko ( journalist reporting on aidar ) states 4 dead , 9 wounded . 
  there were much more regular army casualties though . 
  volunteer means they were not conscripted and were n't official servicemen at the time of ato . 
  they get salary because they are an official part of army now . 
  there might be regular army servicemen among them . 
  he 's not from aidar then . 
  there were paratroopers too . 
  also armed vehicles crews are not from aidar . 
  sorry , but lol . 
  aidar is subordinate to ukrainian army commands , so i do n't know , probably it should be considered a part of army . 
  technically . 
  we need to go deeper . 
  it 's not dominated by greek catholic church . 
  it 's not ss wolfsangel flag , it 's ukraine 's social national assembly ( sna ) flag , it 's meant to encode the phrase `` idea ( i ) of nation ( n ) '' . 
  this does n't cancel the fact that sna are freaking nazis , they totally are . 
  i 'm glad they 're doing good for ukraine at last ( before the conflict only thing they 've done is significantly discredited the maidan and ukrainian nationalists ) , but i would be very cautious of sna after all the combat training they get . 
  it dominates in lviv , ternopil , ivano-frankivsk oblasts , but has less than 1 % of christians in , say , zhytomyr and vinnytsia oblasts .

  so i also have friends who are in donetsk right now , they see separatists moving some missile things all around the town and shooting them somewhere . 
  i do n't thing it 's ` staging for russian media ' though . 
  my friend from university is ( co - ) running patriot defence , they are definitely trustworthy . 
  there 's the guy from uk who just arrived as a technical in my team ( web development ) . 
  he has finished his 2nd year of studies , and he will have a year-long break at his university . 
  so apparently , 2nd year is ok . 
  this should be in the top . 
   they only divide people, 
  that 's kind of the whole point of borders,

  edit :, 
  there 's even a sketch of a nondeterministic turing machine on the right hand of the board . 
  agreed , it 's over 9000 . 
  ok , makes sense . 
  did n't think of that , because i 've never seen this notation for `` not equals '', 
  still a breakthrough . 
  it 's probably a smart joke .

  hi , fellow redditor . 
  i will probably be in aalto studying computer security ( nordsecmob erasmus mundus programme ), 
  it uses a variant of dghv scheme over the integers with cnt11 ciphertext compression techniques . 
  it allows to not encrypt all of the inputs of homomorphic functions prior to computation . 
  for medium-large security level of 72 bits , the size of a compressed encrypted bit is about 5 kb , while the size of expanded one ( bit ) is about 26 mb . 
  compression can be done during encryption step only . 
  might be feasible for some applications . 
  to the best of my knowledge , the research is mainly concentrated around homomorphic evaluation of the aes decryption circuit in order to decrease communication in outsource private computation setting . 
  recent improvements include faster multiplication using fft for schemes with polynomial-ring ciphertext space , and faster bootstrapping [ dm14 ] , but basically the situation is that swhe is fast , bootstrapping is slow , additions are fast , multiplications are slow . 
  the state of the art ( again , to the best of my knowledge ) are r-lwe-based or equivalent schemes with ciphertext space over polynomials rings :, 
  - bgv scheme [ bgv12 ] with improvements like scale-invariance ( fv scheme , see review in [ ln14 ] ) . 
  main implementation is [ helib ] ( https://github.com/shaih/helib ) by [ ghs12 ] , but there 's [ one by kryptnostic ] ( https://github.com/kryptnostic/fhe-core ) coming from silicon valley . 
  - ntru-based yashe scheme ( see review [ ln14 ] ) . 
  no known production-ready implementations . 
  there is a also a approximate-eigenvector-based scheme with ciphertext space over matrices :, 
  - gsw scheme [ gsw13 ] . 
  no known production-ready implementation, 
  various improvements were made recently to he schemes over the integers : scale-invariantness , batching , crt-based compression :, 
  - dghv-based scheme over the integers , latest improvement being sidghv [ clt14 ] . 
  there 's a c++ implementation by me of swhe [ dghv scheme with ciphertext compression ] ( https://github.com/bogdan-kulynych/libshe ) ( shameless plug ), 
  i know that certain companies work on implementing fhe backends for cryptdb . 
  also , [ kryptnostic ] ( http://kryptnostic.com/ ) is using fhe in production . 
  edit : fixed some factual errors, 
  - [ dm14 ] fhew : bootstrapping homomorphic encryption in less than a second, 
  - [ bgv12 ] ( leveled ) fully homomorphic encryption without bootstrapping,
