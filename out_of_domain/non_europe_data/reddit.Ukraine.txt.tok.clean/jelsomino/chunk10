  bad weather also affect affects reseller ticket price . 
  last winter during snow days you can get tickets really cheap . 
  if you get into town, 
  if you have desktop/htpc running 24/7 you may think of esata or usb3 attached raid box . 
  fraction of the price of nas and most of capabilities,

  silicondust has several tuners . 
  i think [ homerun extend ] ( https://www.silicondust.com/products/hdhomerun/extend/ ) would serve your needs the best . 
  not only it decodes clearqam ota channels it transcodes them to mp4 stream on your network which is much more convenient,

  jack and [ ray hudson ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gs6np-g_h5w ) are my favorite commentators of all time, 
  and shoes , do n't forget the shoes !, 
  gisele really knows how to dress a goat, 
  he deserves same warm welcome as soupy got, 
  i 'd say a day at the races . 
  the range is incredible - from hard rock of `` tie your mother down '' and `` white man '' to sweet whisper of `` millionaire waltz '' and `` take your breath away '' . 
  and of course `` somebody to love '' which is in vocal category of its own, 
  too bad breakfast on pluto is n't streaming . 
  love this movie . 
  cillian murphy is absolutely incredible and liam neeson is playing not your usual tough guy, 
  fuck gyros , i 'll just use roasted chickpeas recipe for a beer snack !, 
  thanks man , love chickpeas but never thought of that idea, 
  word of caution for future flirc buyers . 
  i loved it when i used for relatively old panasonic 32 inch tv . 
  worked flawlessly with my htpc i could n't be happier . 
  then i replaced it with 40 inch tc-40as520u and could not set up flirc with its remote . 
  i guess this remote uses some proprietary ir communication protocol that is not compatible with flirc . 
  i could n't even program remote function on my lg3 cell phone for this tv . 
  `` they beat them and they beat them up '' ( c ) jack, 
  if there 's any conciliation octopi live 3-5 years and it missed fisherman somehow it 'll be dead soon anyway, 
  not to mention that it was probably the only wc that made direct profit for host country . 
  having infrastructure , stadia and transportation already in place is a good thing, 
  hmm , average attendance per game in wc '94 - 68,991, 
  average attendance in euro '96 in england - 41,157, 
  do n't forget , it was last wc that did n't required individual seats . 
  i still remember aluminium benches in old foxboro stadium, 
  what kind of tv do you have ? 
  if it supports dlna you can play tv channels directly from prime, 
  every time i hear this song my ears hurt, 
   a range of season ticket holder renewal prices are as follows :, 
   loge seat : $ 90 - $ 155 per game, 
   balcony seat : $ 48 - $ 107 per game, 
  i may express unpopular opinion but discrepancy in prices for season and individual games tickets is what 's driving resellers market . 
  if you can get a highly demand product for half its value you 'd be stupid no to make profit ( or break even ) on your season ticket bill . 
  unfortunately ukraine does n't have a luxury protest ** against ** wars . 
  being a bridge between east and west armed conflicts came to our land with cruel regularity . 
  so there 's not much of a war protest song but plenty of songs about a war . 
  want any ? 
  beer ? 
  i missed it when was skipping 30 sec forward on my dvr !,

  in general [ here 's ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kbnxjw5uvu&amp;list=plci1ioziqo5moeowb6taf1ss4x0a3s_va ) a good channel with such songs, 
  let me know if you need more info, 
  this is a most gruesome discovery for me from that article, 
  i highly recommend audio commentary by brian and roger from rock montreal concert . 
  they explain a lot why and what makes this footage so special, 
  all icbms and other long range ballistic missiles and strategic bombers were either dismantled or handed over to russia, 
  [ ukraine today ] ( http://uatoday.tv ) is a good source of the official ukrainian point of view on current situation, 
  care to elaborate your claim ? 
  senator mccain is considered by many as a failure for his presidential campaign . 
  vice president joe biden is a laughing stock on the capital hill . 
  but both are very good friends of ukraine and did a lot to help us . 
  at this this moment i 'd accept offer from beelzebub himself if that help fight russian aggression , corruption and economic hardship, 
  edit : for clarification : it 's not like he 's going to be in some kind of position to shape ukraine 's foreign or domestic policies . 
  looks like this council is informal club of country 's friends . 
  the more the better, 
  serious question folks : ** what are you expecting from g3 upgrade to marshmallow ? 
  ** what 's is missing from current android version that you desperately need in 6.0 ? 
  as an owner of t-mob g3 i 'd rather have a stable but old firmware on my phone . 
  heard some complaints about 6.0 update on g4 and now i 'm really reluctant to put 6.0 when it 's finally going to be released . 
  i always compare f15 and f16 to firebird and 911 . 
  different kind of beauty but beauty nevertheless, 
  i always thought this behavior caused by 2 things :, 
  - bigger embryo uses its siblings for for food same way chicken uses yolk . 
  - law of natural selection where strongest of the span survives with lack of food . 
  with his dedication to fight against badger culling brian become an honorary badger long time ago, 
  also makes nice htpc on the side . 
  consumer ir port on front panel one of the best features of nucs, 
  `` nuclear launch detected '' announcement is the scariest part of the game, 
  yes , all mce remote controls come with usb ir receiver .
