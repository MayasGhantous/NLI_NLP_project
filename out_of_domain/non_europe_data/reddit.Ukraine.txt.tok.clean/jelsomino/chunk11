  but nuc has this receiver already so nothing stick out from the front of the box, 
  if i may suggest - get an armband and ( if you wish ) sporty blutooth headphones . 
  unless you 're running triathlon it should work in any conditions, 
  biggest advantage of nuc is its size and features like built in ir port that make it suitable for htpc/server combo . 
  if you plan only use the system for dedicated plex server you can find much better bang for your buck, 
  nucs use laptop processors . 
  and while current generation of intel notebook cpus are very powerful , desktop processors pack more juice and better suitable for the server . 
  build or buy desktop with similar i5 and it should be faster than nuc . 
  not to mention that small factor pc requires external file storage, 
  add an ssd for system drive and you got yourself darn good plex server, 
  [ upd ] i slightly increased files size to 405mb and np + + failed to open it . 
  i guess it does have limitations . 
  but in the same time windows 8.1 native notepad was able to process this file !, 
  i believe ram size ( 32gb on my system ) did make a difference, 
  along with inside out this movie well illustrates how human mind works, 
  ca n't agree with you more . 
  few advantages with tons of risk . 
  ssd error correction does not work properly in raid, 
  yes , it 's prepared as solution and poured on filter paper . 
  once it 's dried slightest pressure causes detonation . 
  worst part is if ni3 partially dried . 
  blast will disperse wet parts all around the lab next few hours every step on the floor on touch of the table will be accompanied by loud crack, 
  generally speaking you should not have any problems at all . 
  call security if you do . 
  but seating in the area specially designated for team supporters wearing opposite colors would be not the best idea . 
  if you 're casual fan of football just enjoy the moment without antagonizing other team fans, 
  [ a site ] ( http://plan-stade.fr/ ) with good seating charts for most stadiums, 
  have you ever heard how afghani people pronounce `` g '' in `` afghanistan '' ? 
  dude , what the hell do you want then ? 
  you have google and youtube as any other person on the internet . 
  look up for hamid karzai speeches or something, 
  i guess that outlaws entering road alerts in waze , does n't it ? 
  backup your documents/pictures/videos etc. 
  only if and then reinstall os system clean . 
  this way you 'll keep your files and guaranteed there 's no compromised account of software installed . 
  if computer booted up from usb there 's nothing wrong with your install media . 
  install can not find system hdd/ssd because it does n't see it . 
  so play around in bios with the way you future system drive is connected : uefi , raid , achi . 
  btw , did you follow this instruction ? 
  [ http://www.asrock.com/microsite/win7install/index.html] ( http://www.asrock.com/microsite/win7install/index.html ), 
  no , it 's limited to uk ip only . 
  and technically it 's not free , brits pay for it from their tv license tax,

  ca n't speak for other channels but comedy central broke several days ago most likely because comedycentral.com changed something on their site, 
  so , queen 's birthday between hitler 's ( apr 20 ) and lenin 's ( apr 22 ) . 
  i think not !, 
  you have to understand that mig 25 was not designed as fighter but interceptor . 
  primary goal of this aircraft is to intercept strategic bombers . 
  soviet army even had special military branch `` antiaircraft aviation '' sole purpose of which was deter incoming b52 onslaught . 
  hundreds of 25s and later 31s were deployed near borders ready to take off if any unknown plane approached soviet airspace . 
  yes , it was response to f16 . 
  and although somewhat superior flying machine it lacked precision weapons and integrated command and control centers . 
  which in the end made them easy targets for us fighters, 
  * say hello to my little friends !, 
  windex and all purpose cleaner if you have spray bottle already, 
  yeah , i remember watching it live and thinking `` wtf is he talking about ??? 
  if part of the building is destroyed it 's not the barn where they keep all vodka it 's the reactor ! '', 
  who 's the moron who made this video ?

  should add google voice here as well . 
  once you set up your smartphone to make international calls via gv you never think about it anymore . 
  here 's the rates, 
  country/region rate per minute usd, 
  ukraine - kyiv 10 cents, 
  ukraine - landline 10 cents, 
  ukraine - lviv 10 cents, 
  ukraine - mobile 21 cents, 
  ukraine - mobile - astelit 20 cents, 
  ukraine - special services 67 cents, 
  i respectfully disagree . 
  boston drivers either do n't know rules or purposely ignore them . 
  every night i commute via intersection with 2 lanes and left only lane has very light traffic . 
  every goddamn night scores of drivers try to be a wise ass and cut into right lane . 
  same goes for merging traffic , blocking intersection , crossing double line etc , etc , etc. 
  i remember my first trip to uk . 
  we drove through the bridge in wales where 1 mile long queue patiently waited to exit from highway . 
  it was amazing, 
  vouch for handbrake . 
  easiest way to rip multiple episodes dvd to separate files, 
  thanks a bunch man !, 
  i stuck with asus eee update for 2 days . 
  once i applied kb mentioned above it passed `` checking for updates '' stage in a matter of 2 hours . 
  now it 's downloading 1gb worth of crap and hopefully finish it before day 's end . 
  general rule - whichever team [ listed first ] ( http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/season=2016/matches/index.html ) would considered a host, 
  speaking from previous experience there 's more prejudice against video cameras . 
  you have absolutely zero chance to bring gopro on the stadium if discovered at checkpoint . 
  although in modern world any still shot digital camera can record video, 
  no i attended wc2006 and euro2012 . 
  as well as various europa league games in different countries including france . 
  since germany was my first major football event i brought both my dv camcorder and still camera with 30x zoom ( not detachable ) . 
  on the first game security did n't allow camcorder and i had to store it in special locker room . 
  for euro2012 i bought m4/3 camera with various lenses including telephoto . 
  maybe it 's just home turf but i did n't have any problem bringing it to 5 games in 3 different cities . 
  updated via lg pc suite . 
  not sure if it 's related but after upgrade 64gb patriot sd card is gone . 
  not recognized by phone nor in 2 different card readers . 
  question for lucky ~ ~ bastards ~ ~ owners : what carried does htc use for shipping ( ups , fedex ) and where is it coming from ? 
  thank you guys , that 's what i was afraid - fedex with signature .
