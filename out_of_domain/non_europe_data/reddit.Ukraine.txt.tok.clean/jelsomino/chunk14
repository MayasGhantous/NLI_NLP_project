  - if possible avoid usb 3 drives . 
  difference in installation time is negligible, 
  my steps were for uefi only . 
  unless it 's impossible to use uefi boot for installation i do n't see a reason use legacy, 
  generally os setup should take care of creating partition for installation . 
  granted you have clean disk . 
  during setup i usually simply delete all partitions and let install take care of partition table, 
  can you use kodi instead of browser ? 
  it has good espn plugin, 
  put them in a raid then . 
  i know , i know raid is not backup . 
  but external raid box cheaper and easier to maintain than online cloud . 
  especially when we 're talking about terabytes of info, 
  try one or all of following, 
  - bend sim card slot a little inward to make a better contact, 
  - clean your sim card contact surface with alcohol, 
  - replace sim card with new one, 
  hope it helps, 
  here 's my quick and dirty translation :, 
  `` in the early sunday morning, 
  white ruzha has bloomed ( sorry do n't know english name of that flower ), 
  why are you crying, 
  young girl ? 
  how can i not cry, 
  my faithful boyfriend has been drafted, 
  he 's a cossack now ,, 
  and he does n't know, 
  that his love is, 
  walking the isle, 
  walking the isle ,, 
  saying her woews, 
  but with other boy, 
  not the one she loved, 
  cossack came back home, 
  meets his girl, 
  takes her hand, 
  and asks, 
  `` my sweet girl, 
  what have you done ? 
  when i went to army, 
  you were my love !, 
  my beef with pmp is it does n't have exit option . 
  and pht/openpht does . 
  it becomes very irritating when you jump from one media player to another , wmc/plex/kodi, 
  hmm , i 've never been able to find it . 
  thank you i 'll give it a try, 
  i could swear i did n't see this option . 
  maybe because i 'm using remote control ? 
  now i ca n't wait to try it when i get home, 
  to make it more authentic try to serve them with small cut bacon pieces and use bacon fat for frying, 
  arugula can add some nice kick and also nutritious, 
  sorry , afaik plex does n't play iso dvd . 
  quick google search hints that [ kodi ] ( http://kodi.wiki/view/dvdplayer ) does but i never tried that, 
  i guess that 's where $ 200k kraft money will go, 
  what 's the big deal with returns , seriously ? 
  if you know you want this phone you got it . 
  if it 's defective you can replace it . 
  after 30 days it covered by 2yr manufacturer warranty . 
  i purchased axon7 on newegg and got said headphones when it came out in august . 
  never looked back . 
  believe me , free headphones worth the wait . 
  not the top notch and too big to use with phone to my taste . 
  but i 'm using them at work and sound is pretty awesome, 
  `` the '' ukraine makes me cringe every time i hear it .

  ever . 
  is it on / r/hockey already ? 
  thank you for the great article . 
  definitely share it with my english only speaking friends . 
   tv here in ukraine a better buy, 
  that 's not actually true . 
  us sells cheapest electronics almost anywhere in the world . 
  but the problem is not the price , and not even power supply , since most modern power adapters seamlessly switch from 110 to 220/240v . 
  biggest problem is ** tv signal format incompatibility ** both analog and digital formats in us and ukraine are different . 
  so you need a converter box for ota channels or some kind of cable box from local cable provider . 
  so save yourself a headache and send money for tv instead, 
  as a proud owner of skullcanyon i can definitely confirm that it will handle almost any load for media server while working as htpc . 
  not sure about synology but nuc itself is very power friendly and quiet . 
  for my home media server rig i connected skullcanyon to usb3 .0 raid box and it got second m2 ssd for plex data drive . 
  thank you for your answer !, 
  excellent idea , sending request now . 
  and i got answer i was looking for, 
   dear friend ,, 
   thank you for your mail . 
   you are right , the game with iceland was the last one without spectators . 
   if you are planning to visit zagreb , we invite you to visit our club . 
   best regards ,, 
  looks like my vacations plans are set, 
  there are versions of win8 .1 iso with embedded wmc still floating around . 
  it 's last windows os where wmc works with hdhr out of the box . 
  i was n't able to set my w10 to work with wmc since millennium update .

  my favorite quote for this subject is from [ jack london 's goboto night ] ( http://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/2010/03/06/post-fiction/classic-fiction/goboto-night-jack-london.html ), 
  ** `` a good curse , rightly used and rarely , is an efficient thing . 
  too many curses spoil the cursing . 
  note : a curse can not change a card sequence nor cause the wind to blow .
