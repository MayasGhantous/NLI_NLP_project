  although olgino brigade voting is very strong there,

  * the conceptions `` ukrainian nationalist , '' `` nationalistic movement , '' differ from similar terms used in the west . 
  the ukrainian nationalistic movement has nothing in common with nazism , fascism or national-socialism . 
  ukrainian nationalism is fighting against totalitarianism , racism , dictatorship and violence of any kind . 
  the name `` ukrainian nationalist '' is consonant with `` ukrainian patriot '' who is ready to fight for freedom of his people , to sacrifice for his people everything he has , even his life . 
  what in that statement or article in whole made you say that ? 
  you are delusional and simply ca n't face facts .

  `` nazi collabortionist '' was arrested by nazis in 1941 and sent to concentration camp in 1942 . 
  stalin collaborated with hitler longer than bandera was free during ukraine 's occupation, 
  i did n't say stalin collaborated with hitler longer than bandera , read my reply carefully . 
  declaration of ukrainian state act was announced on june 30 1941 , 8 days after hitler attacked ussr . 
  immediately after that nazi arrested all leadership of independent ukrainian state and bandera ended up in sachsenhausen concentration camp . 
  how 's that for collaborationism ? 
  really ? 
  was there a bandera trial in ussr ? 
  can you provide information on that ? 
  nuremberg trubunal acquitted bandera of war crimes . 
  are you questioning nuremberg tribunal findings ?
