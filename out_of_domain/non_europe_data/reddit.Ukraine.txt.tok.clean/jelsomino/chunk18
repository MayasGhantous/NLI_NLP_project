  that 's why the consistency of the material changes ( ie it flakes apart ) . 
   ** what happens if the resulting material is heated to melting temperature and then cooled ? 
  ** reheating the tin reverts it to \u00df-tin ( the silvery-white form ) , though at temperatures below -13.2 \u00ba c the tin is liable to transform back into its alpha form . 
  [ edit ] - looks like `` minus '' is missing from the temperature point where beta -  alpha transformation occurs, 
  it 's not a simple stupidity or ignorance . 
  as with climate deniers those politicians benefit one way or another to keep current system in place . 
  nothing hurts more than hard kick in the wallet .

  there 's nothing to talk about with a person who believes that 2 +2 = 5, 
  discussion is exchange of ideas . 
  what can you possibly gain from a person who willingly rejects laws of physics . 
  unless you a psychiatrist . 
   people are n't necessarily dumb , just easily influenced most of the time, 
  change a mind of an individual who puts feelings before facts ? 
  good luck with that . 
  my years on this earth taught me it 's exercise in futility, 
   the world needs you to be willing to try and have a civil discussion when opinions differ, 
  opinion can differ . 
  facts ca n't .

  people for some reason afraid of borscht as being very complicated to make . 
  i assure you it 's not . 
  the versatility and adaptation of this soup makes it easy to cook for anyone who can slice vegetables . 
  there are only two required ingredients : beets and cabbage . 
  rest can be omitted or substituted .

  why news in russian from crude propaganda site is here ? 
  upd : / u/bogdan37 profile gives an answer to that, 
  second swiftkey . 
  ukrainian layout is pretty standard and spelling is good . 
  the only thing i wish from swiftkey is unified cyrillic keyboard where all letters are merged in one . 
  at this point i 'm using both ukrainian and russian and it 's little inconvenient to go back and forth between three layouts, 
  do we know to this day whom this song is about ? 
  care to provide a direct quote or at least point to the specific page in the document ? 
  [ edit ] found it myself . 
  page 10 :, 
  shelling from various artillery systems caused over 60 per, 
  cent of all civilian casualties : 13 killed ( three women and ten, 
  men ) and 88 injured ( 37 women and a girl , 48 men and a boy ,, 
  and an adult whose sex is not known ) . 
  20 per cent of these, 
  casualties ( three killed and 18 injured ) were recorded in the, 
  government-controlled territories , while 80 per cent ( ** 10 ** killed, 
  and ** 70 ** injured ) were recorded in the ** territories controlled by the, 
  armed groups . 
  ladies and gentlemen , this is a textbook example of twisting the facts to present a fake news . 
  10 ( ten ) people killed by artillery fire on terrorist controlled territories . 
  10 out of many thousands lost in this war . 
  also report states causalities recorded on these territories , there 's no mention of what and how they caused . 
  there are number of well documented cases where terrorist shelled population area under their control to incede a public outcry mostly in russia . 
  yes , people under occupation are more likely to get killed not by ukrainian army but by a thugs who created this lawless region . 
  * could n't use * . 
  now we can, 
  and also 200 bucks for growler ? 
  is it really worth it ? 
  i understand stainless part but tap and co2 looks a little too much for me, 
  louistravel if it 's your site/article please correct spelling of the capital . 
  it 's kyiv , not kiev . 
  other than that the article is pretty good, 
  to be perfectly honest it 's not a `` ukrainian '' cartoon . 
  it based on ukrainian folk tale and uses our folk songs but it made in soyuzmultfilm studios in moscow . 
  if you really want a piece of ukr animation i suggest to take a look at [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/ukranima ) youtube channel . 
  ukrnaukfilm made several gems like [ petrik p'yatochkin ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1gul74yrzo ) or my favorite [ hippo and the sun ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc7x9incqq4 ), 
  one of the best selling points for me was nuc built in consumer infrared port . 
  no need for ir dongle and software - any wmc remote works out of the box . 
  baby wheel !, 
  so does staples if you in that part of the country that still has them, 
  i recently had a problem with cc ultra constantly restarting because i plugged it into tv usb port . 
  it was n't powerful enough hence reboot . 
  one of the things to consider as well, 
  week before moving to my new house i gave away my in-windows ac . 
  and then heat wave hit . 
  i came home from work and it was an oven . 
  so i went to corner shop and got six pack of stella artois . 
  while it was chilling in fridge i killed time washing my car .
