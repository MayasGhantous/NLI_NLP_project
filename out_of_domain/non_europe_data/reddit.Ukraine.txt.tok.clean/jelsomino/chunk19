  i stand corrected - of course duo needs phone # . 
  i was just looking at my nexus, 
  app store lists duo as incompatible with pixel c . so unless you sideload apk it 's unavailable, 
  good article - shitty platform ( see the footnote ), 
  not to mention factually incorrect, 
  if you expect samsung to support its tablets longer than google you are mistaken, 
  no , do n't get me wrong , i 'm not talking about hardware quality . 
  i refer to samsung 's notorious habit to release firmware updates late and really reluctant to update os to next level,

  odyssey is amazing book and full of small tales that can be short story by themselves . 
  for example , his wife , after odysseus revealed himself , asked him to move their wedding bed . 
  and he refused to do that . 
  because him and only him knew that bed is old olive tree stump which he cut down when was building his palace . 
  i heard it in `` let 's go to prison '' movie . 
  highly underrated flick imho,

  not * pro * - russians , just russians . 
  that was , as many such incidents recently , a sophisticated job by one of russian secret services . 
  too `` clean '' and too targeted for guerrilla terririsi, 
  that ` stash, 
  just hold their vodka and listen how russians deny holodomor,

  i heard hospitals in slavonia are top notch, 
  am i only one who thinks that olympics in current implementation is showcase for corruption and opportunity for tyrannical regimes to hide their true nature ? 
  look what happened immediately after sochi, 
  i 'm not sure why is this being upvoted . 
  probably because no one read the article or book, 
  * applebaum writes . 
  ` the holodomor does not meet that criterion . 
  the ukrainian famine was not an attempt to eliminate every single living ukrainian ; it was also halted , in the summer of 1933 , well before it could devastate the entire nation . ' *, 
  fuck you , mr applebaum . 
  if it 's not a genocide what the fuck is ? 
  got the email this morning :, 
  an update on winter electric rates, 
  as you may know , the massachusetts department of public utilities recently approved an increase for electric supply prices for the period of november 1 through april 30 . 
  this means that , starting in november , residential electric customers using 500 kilowatt hours ( kwh ) per month will see an electric bill that is 37 percent ( about $ 33 per month ) higher than last winter . 
  we asked for this increase because of higher energy supply prices . 
  energy supply prices are set by the commodity market , not national grid . 
  when we purchase energy on your behalf , we pass on those costs directly without a markup . 
  i love the explanation . 
  especially with oil prices hitting below $ 90/barrel, 
  [ \u041f\u043e\u0441\u0442 \u043d\u0430 \u0444\u0435\u0439\u0441\u0431\u0443\u043a\u0435 ] ( https://www.facebook.com/theoliverstone/posts/901387646552202 ), 
  * excuse my absence these past weeks . 
  a combination of overwork , prepping the snowden movie in germany & england , a side trip to moscow , and a devastating head cold have laid me low . 
  recovering over christmas in california ; winter sun helps . 
  interviewed viktor yanukovych 4 hours in moscow for new english language documentary produced by ukrainians . 
  he was the legitimate president of ukraine until he suddenly was n't on february 22 of this year . 
  details to follow in the documentary , but it seems clear that the so-called ` shooters ' who killed 14 police men , wounded some 85 , and killed 45 protesting civilians , were outside third party agitators . 
  many witnesses , including yanukovych and police officials , believe these foreign elements were introduced by pro-western factions -- with cia fingerprints on it . 
  remember the chavez ` regime change ' / coup of 2002 when he was temporarily ousted after pro and anti-chavez demonstrators were fired upon by mysterious shooters in office buildings . 
  also resembles similar technique early this year in venezuela when maduro 's legally elected government was almost toppled by violence aimed at anti-maduro protestors . 
  create enough chaos , as the cia did in iran ` 53 , chile ` 73 , and countless other coups , and the legitimate government can be toppled . 
  it 's america 's soft power technique called ` regime change 101 . ', 
  in this case the `` maidan massacre '' was featured in western media as the result of an unstable , brutal pro-russian yanukovych government . 
  you may recall yanukovych went along with the february 21 deal with opposition parties and 3 eu foreign minsters to get rid of him by calling for early elections . 
  the next day that deal was meaningless when well-armed , neo-nazi radicals forced yanukovych to flee the country with repeated assassination attempts . 
  by the next day , a new pro-western government was established and immediately recognized by the us ( as in the chavez 2002 coup ) . 
  a dirty story through and through , but in the tragic aftermath of this coup , the west has maintained the dominant narrative of `` russia in crimea '' whereas the true narrative is `` usa in ukraine . '' the truth is not being aired in the west . 
  it 's a surreal perversion of history that 's going on once again , as in bush pre-iraq ` wmd ' campaign . 
  but i believe the truth will finally come out in the west , i hope , in time to stop further insanity . 
  for a broader understanding , see pepe escobar 's analysis `` the new european ` arc of instability , ''' which indicates growing turbulence in 2015 , as the us can not tolerate the idea of any rival economic entity http://bit.ly/1ybmpha . 
  you might also see `` untold history '' chapter 10 where we discuss the dangers of past empires which did not allow for the emergence of competing economic countries .
