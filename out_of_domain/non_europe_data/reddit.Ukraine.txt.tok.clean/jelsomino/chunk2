  have you ever heard 2 mig-25 foxbat scrambled in the middle of the night to protect mother russia from capitalist intruders ? 
  i bet noise level of 4 r-15s turbojets working simultaneously can compete with any single spy plane engine, 
  throw a [ bunny suit ] ( http://www.totalprosports.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/zdeno-chara-pink-bunny-2.jpg ) on him and it 's a wrap !, 
  thank you !, 
  it 's good to hear a word of advice from a country whose fans responsible for the worst incident in football history and was banned from european competition for several years . 
  any suggestions on how to run colonies lad ? 
  do espn hockey polls matter ? 
  it hates nhl and makes everything in its power to diminish the league, 
  good to see him immediately picking up what b 's hockey is all about . 
  too bad he joined boston after the playoffs, 
  team that has srna must not complain about diving . 
  can you recommend a reputable scalper site ? 
  my coworker wants to give her husband a birthday present . 
  we live in us and before booking plane tickets she wants to make sure she 'll get place on stands, 
  matt cooke may be traded to minnesota but his legacy still alive with pens . 
  in one game `` skillful '' pittsburgh players hit eriksson who just recovered from concussion , hit marchand 's head with a knee and fractured kelly 's fibula . 
  next time maria lemieux starts bitching about other team targeting his star player he should straighten up his team first . 
  best . 
  ever . 
  [ chara in bunny suit ] ( http://www.totalprosports.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/zdeno-chara-pink-bunny-2.jpg ) is still my favorite, 
  ukrainian city of dnipropetrovsk had ( and still has ) an icbm plant discretly called yuzhmash ( southern machinery ) . 
  because of it city has access restrictions for the foreigners . 
  in 80s it happened to have very successful soccer club which participated in european champions and uefa cups . 
  and because of secrecy paranoia it played home games in neighboring town of krivy rih . 
  not everyone . 
  queen fans hate it because he ripped beat from `` under pressure '', 
  yep . 
  my heart was broken when she left nesn . 
  now we have [ jamie erdahl ] ( http://abcnewspapers.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/erdahl.jpg ) but it 's not the same, 
   more than 100 million americans received a polio vaccine contaminated, 
   with a potentially cancer-causing virus . 
  so ... jenny mccarthy was right ? 
  since his last name loosely translated from russian as `` sheep '' this is even funnier . 
  agree with first 3 but why badmouthing lasership ? 
  i live i ma and order a lot from newegg . 
  ls delivers packages from nj warehouse next day almost without exceptions . 
  all credit goes to `` russian reddit '' leprosorium.ru, 
  you . 
  you knew, 
  i used aaa discounts for six flags tickets and amtrak, 
  it 's not sochi . 
  i would n't go there even if i 've got full paid trip on the private jet . 
  it 's downtown boston , high street . 
  some posh bar trying to attract customers, 
  dude , you must have mixed georgia with russia . 
  wine is a beverage of choice in georgia . 
  incredibly good , cheap and plentiful wine . 
  when you 're there vodka or beer never cross your mind, 
  tell me about it . 
  too bad i was in a hurry when i saw it . 
  but considering current weather it 'll be there for a long time, 
  no they play in kharkiv on march 5 . 
  the city is supposed to be a pro government stronghold so i do n't expect anything dangerous . 
  besides uefa europa league game between dynamo and valencia scheduled to go this thursday in kyiv . 
  and as far as i know there 's no cancellation, 
  [ here ] ( https://forums.plex.tv/index.php/topic/94600-transcoder-process-not-ending/?hl=plexnewtranscoder#entry557528 ) is a good explanation what plexnewtranscoder does . 
  you can also check \\ user \\ < current user  \\ local settings \\ application data \\ plex media server \\ logs \\ plex media server.log and see what it does currently . 
  i would expect indexing take a long time initially . 
  but if it 's going in the loop i 'd submit a ticket to plex, 
  i has it '', 
  second that . 
  i have `` dumb '' lg but it supports dlna so i can watch plex movies , shows and to some extent channels, 
  i think you 're missing the point , my friend . 
  besides the fact mezhihirrya is the size of the small town it 's not the official residence . 
  official residence of ukrainian president is in kyiv . 
  this is n't even belong to the state . 
  and it 's not his only estate . 
  yanukovich and family have several of them in different part of ukraine . 
  explain that on pres salary, 
  you 're a stubborn one , are n't you . 
  do me a favor google the history of the case before making any claims . 
  no it 's not government rented estate !, 
  it officially belongs to the one of his cronies firm but unofficially built on government money . 
  it does used exclusively by him and i ca n't recall any official meetings there . 
  if his term ( s ) in office expire normal way it would have been his , not government 's , nor someone else 's . 
  all friggin ' gold loafs of bread , galleons and 50 car garage . 
  you can always bypass flex and stream media files using any dlna server . 
  nero for example . 
  nero 4 mediaserver came with my lg and ff works for most of my movies, 
  rough translation :, 
  `` ukraine nt refused to play friendly with us which supposed to take place in cyprus on march 5 said ffu president , head coach and captain of the team . 
  national team decided to stay in country in this crucial moment for ukraine '', 
  i respectfully disagree . 
  i 'd rather see them playing this game and make some kind of statement out of it . 
  `` stop war ! '', 
  on jerseys or something . 
  federation will be punished for declining an officially set up friendly anyway . 
  remember [ match of death ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_death_match ) ? 
  this game could 've been boost of morale and unite the country facing mortal threat . 
  edit : link and spelling, 
  all 's well that ends well . 
  [ ukrainan minister of youth and sport ] ( http://www.champion.com.ua/football/2014/03/4/565861/ ) dmytro bulatov wrote on this facebook page that ukrainian squad ** will ** go to the game . 
  `` issue is resolved . 
  wish our team a victory and a good game !, 
  positive attitude for our boys ! '', 
  it 's technically a consulate but picture still bring tears to my eyes, 
  old comcast dvr allows you to program unused buttons on remote to jump 30 sec forward and back . 
  set it years ago and forgot what a commercial on recorded program is, 
  care to provide evidence that `` pretty pictures '' are not true ? 
  thanks !,
