  * everyone in the global football community has a responsibility to act ethically . 
  football fans rightly demand this .

  it 's not bullshit , it 's direct consequence of a organization that does n't have any accountability to international of local laws .

  i constantly use the daily show and colbert report channels . 
  plex client on windows is able to show full shows . 
  new episodes appear next day around 7am et, 
  not arguing with your statements , i just have 2 questions :, 
  - has ng had these increases before ? 
  - how was 37 % spike calculated ? 
  price of oil fluctuates on a regular basis too . 
  and i see it every time i fill up my car . 
  however i have never seen my friendly local gas pump announced 37 % price increase for the next 6 month . 
  it 's counterintuitive and not a free market driven solution . 
  north shore, 
  again , i 'm not arguing with justification of price increase for colder month . 
  i 'm just asking simple questions : why it has n't happen last winter and why national grid buys natural gas at spot market ?

  i 'm not familiar with xbox client but in plex home theater client for windows you can uncheck `` capable receiver '' like shown [ here ] ( http://yakumo.se/pht/settings.png ), 
  it 's not a server 's settings but client 's . 
  again i 'm not familiar with ps3 server but windows has only one option do downmix dts, 
  that 's what i 'm trying to tell you  look at the preferences on your client if it 's possible and uncheck any `` capable receiver '' check boxes,

  dude , shooting stray animals is least evil thing russia 's done in lately . 
  even taking big politics aside , russian football federation allowed 3 clubs from occupied crimea participate in national championship . 
  this is direct violation of uefa rules . 
  and if any other country except the one the has gazprom tried that , it would have been automatically banned from all international games . 
  to be fair - those type of cable cars were common in soviet union . 
  but it does n't make kyiv one less unique, 
  my heart bleeds to see such a masterpiece from my team and then loosing a game in the end . 
  must remind you about [ another incredible goal ] ( http://i.minus.com/iy5dbijcrypu.gif ) from mx player in europa league 2 years ago . 
  unfortunately the club is in disarray and it 's just a shadow of one that existed, 
  they truly do n't . 
  club now belongs to oligarch in exile sergey kurchenko who was in effect , a wallet for yanukovich family . 
  by some estimation he lost 70 % of his wealth in last 12 month . 
  he stopped financing metalist since last winter and it continues to exist by selling his top players . 
  devic , blanko , sosa , cristaldo to name a few . 
  cleiton xavier is sitting on his suitcase too .

  couple of years ago my mechanic needed to quickly get rid of decent but old civic . 
  he put it on craigslist for $ 1500 which was about 500 below what it would have sold if he had time . 
  indian couple replied to ad immediately , agreed to price and came over to pick it up . 
  then they asked him if he can sell it for 13 hundred . 
  mechanic got so mad and said `` you did n't want it for 1500 ? 
  new price is 1700 . 
  take it or leave it . '', 
  they paid .
