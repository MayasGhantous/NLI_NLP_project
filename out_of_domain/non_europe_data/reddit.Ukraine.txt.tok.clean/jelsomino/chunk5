  i almost can smell it, 
  you may start with dropping `` the '' from name of the country . 
  nobody says `` the france '' , right ? 
  then i 'd suggest to use [ ukrainian post lookup service ] ( http://services.ukrposhta.com/postindex_new/default.aspx?lang=en ) works fine for couple of addresses i checked . 
  good luck !, 
  i 'm really annoyed with luxury car christmas commercials . 
  do n't know about you but present your spouse 70k car is impossible if you live together . 
  second that . 
  one of the hidden steve martin 's gems . 
  just fun to watch on christmas eve . 
  it may be unpopular opinion here but if you think about raid5 get a dedicated box for it . 
  not the nas but cheap hardware raid enclosure with msata and/or usb3 .0 . 
  it gives you some level of redundancy and separate it from your built system in case of its hardware or os failure, 
  some components do n't intended to be refurbished . 
  never buy refurbished hdd/ssd . 
  not worth the risk . 
  my rule of thumb : save important data on storage you can trust . 
  always separate system and data drive . 
  and , needless to say , backup regularly . 
  check office depot . 
  it has pretty good selection of sauder desks . 
  my l-shape was bought there more than 10 years ago and still stands, 
  you 're right . 
  i did n't realize they closed store in woburn . 
  well , check out the catalog first, 
  til that his last name is bros ** n ** an , not bros ** m ** an . 
  i lived in lie all these years !, 
  for me it was harder to accept `` beren '' . 
  cause bern is `` bear '' in old german and yiddish, 
  - i 'm sold !, 
  i used combination of anydvd hd to copy bd to hard drive and ripbot264 to convert bluray to mkv for plex . 
  ripbot automatically selects chapter sequence once you select a largest * . mts file in \\ stream dir . 
  i 'd say that it failed in very few occasions . 
  and result file in size and quality imho better than handbrake,

  i love you !, 
  `` primitive raft '' ? 
  there was nothing primitive about it . 
  genuine , authentic - yes . 
  and being anal about it saved their lives . 
  if thor listened advice and replaced tying rope with chains he and his crew would have been dead, 
   thermal paste should be fine ( i hope ), 
  that 's what they want you to think  laptop manufacturers are notoriously bad with applying thermal paste . 
  in best case scenario it 's something scraped off the boot , in worst a it 's spongy patch that has same thermal characteristics as spongecake . 
  so if you able to take a laptop apart ( and believe me to get to the cpu/gpu you will have completely disassemble it ) do it and get a good thermal paste on all contact surfaces, 
  where have all you guys been when i spent all this weekend reinstalling ps and fixing all incorrect matches ? 
  but thanks anyway for the next time i do major renovation . 
  * language spoken : russian , ukrainian *, 
  question for modem already been answered . 
  as for cable box - you ca n't buy one . 
  but you can, 
  1 ) buy a tv with cablecard support, 
  2 ) buy a cable hdtv tuner that uses the same cablecard and can broadcast tv signal over home network . 
  i personally use silicondust hdhomerunner prime for 3 years and very happy with it, 
  what 's easier than a factory reset ? 
  have you files backed up , have a wifi ready and press the button . 
  oh , yeah , do n't forget your google password, 
  download iso from microsoft site and create usb install drive using [ windows usb/dvd download tool ] ( http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/windows-usb-dvd-download-tool ), 
  is it doing it in boot mode ? 
  let it go . 
  once it finished ** copy files from it immediately ! ** . 
  i just recently saved data from old dell with failed smart ide disk . 
  2 days to run checkdisk , 2,5 days to copy 120gb, 
  last year my local electric company for the first time on my memory jacked up price 30 % for 6 coldest month . 
  it did n't raise prices when fossil energy prices were on the rise . 
  since my condo has electric heating and nothing i can do about it i 'm screwed . 
  hmmm , since when adult swim and cartoon network are 2 separate channels ? 
   i personally do n't blame sling for listing the two separately since there are cable providers who do n't put adult swim and cartoon network on the same channel . 
  are you sure about that ? 
  what does as show on 10am on saturday ? 
  i beg your pardon , ** networks ** do n't have to , but ** channels ** do . 
  i think we have to make a distinction between providers of content ( network ) and providers of medium ( frequency on cable or ota ) . 
  static does n't generate revenue for cable or satellite company, 
  my video encoder tool of choice - [ ripbot264 ] ( http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?t=127611 ) i 've seen very few video files it ca n't handled . 
  from canon page your camera records in h. 264 format and ripbot should be able to compress your video . 
  it 's a windows tool . 
  `` i like my pretzels like i like my men '',

  '' * - bummer, 
  looks more to me like [ chuck berry walk ] ( http://dearestdamneddiary.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/mark_seliger-chuck_berry.jpg ), 
  or paille not miss the empty net ? 
  i have similar problem . 
  couple of month ago my data consumption spiked from 150-200 gb per month to 600-700 . 
  as it 's been suggested before i used networx on all my computers and router data usage statistics to verify that comcast was n't lying . 
  but problem with networx is that it does n't break down usage by application . 
  i still do n't know what is munching data at that incredible rate . 
  so if anybody can recommend a program for win7 that gives me data usage by application i 'll be so happy, 
  all i can think of is [ the night at the roxbury ] ( http://img.pandawhale.com/69437-night-at-the-roxbury-bouncing-bc2c.gif ), 
  this . 
  i 'm always do crucial memory advisor tool even if i buy it somewhere else . 
  make sure you have compatible speed and ** voltage ** for the upgrade . 
  if you think habs swept regular series just because of a goalie i 've got bad news for you ... b 's were simply outperformed by a team that knows exactly how to play against type of game current bruins roster can offer . 
  i 'm using [ d34010wyk ] ( http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/nuc/nuc-kit-d34010wyk.html ) as plex server/htpc . 
  works perfectly for both . 
  i suggest you to take a look at this particular model because :, 
  - it has a ir sensor that compatible with any mce and harmony remote, 
  - has sata port that i use to connect to external raid box . 
  unfortunately it 's not e-sata and it 's located right in the middle of the board . 
  so in order to use it you either have to keep it open or cut a hole in the lid .
