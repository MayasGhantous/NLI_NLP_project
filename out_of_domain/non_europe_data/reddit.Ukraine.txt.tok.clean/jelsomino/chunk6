  i 'd say go to mb manufacturer web site and download model specific network adapter driver . 
  in some cases windows generic network driver does n't work, 
  just the rule of thumb : if you 're doing a fresh install always keep network and chipset drivers from motherboard manufacturer ready . 
  windows update usually can pull out the rest of drivers . 
  if your htpc connected to tv i highly recommend to use [ flirc ] ( https://flirc.tv/ ) you can program existing ( or any other ) remote to windows keys .

  you know what i mean ? 
  as a happy plex user who 's running the server on nuc i 'm respectfully disagree . 
  nuc is great if you want to run server and htpc at the same time . 
  but lack of internal space and internal location for sata makes it hard to have large storage . 
  of course it has usb3 but i personally prefer esata for external drives . 
  if you 're not planning to connect your plex server directly to tv look for alternative system with form factor specifically designed for servers, 
  few small reasons : it seems my raid box takes less resources when running on sata . 
  also i have a weird problem when nuc hangs on reboot when external usb3 drive is connected ( not the boot order issue , i checked ), 
   the newer nucs support having 1 2.5 '' hard drive internally . 
  my d34010wyk1 also has this internal sata port . 
  but i do n't think there 's enough space for additional 2.5 '' drive inside the case, 
  my vote goes for handbrake as well . 
  i 'd recommend to rip dvds to hard drive first , put several jobs in queue and let them encode overnight,

  i would suggest to run [ sysinternal autoruns ] ( https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx?f=255&amp;mspperror=-2147217396 ) first to remove all malware from startup . 
  pay close attention on logon and scheduled tasks tabs - most are hidden there . 
  after that uninstall all suspicious programs , [ start chome with extension disabled ] ( http://superuser.com/questions/254579/how-to-open-google-chrome-with-extensions-disabled-turned-off ) and remove malicious add-ons,

  if you subscribed to cable provider you can buy [ silicondust hd homerun prime ] ( http://www.silicondust.com/products/hdhomerun/prime/ ) ( it usually on sale for ~ $ 100 ) , obtain a cablecard from you cable company and record tv programs to virtually any pc with windows media center,

  as a rule of thumb - never keep data ( docs , pictures , etc ) and system files ( os , installed programs ) on the same physical drive .

  if you decided to go with nuc i 'd suggest to pick model with ir sensor . 
  not sure you would be able to program it to use with tv or receiver but any wmc remote works with it out of the box , no additional software required . 
  as for media storage go with external usb3 .0 dirve or raid box . 
  they 're cheap and with luck you could have relatively quiet configuration, 
  i have one word for you - ** stew ** . 
  learn few basic [ recipes ] ( http://allrecipes.com/recipes/soups-stews-and-chili/stews ) , pick ones that fit your taste , budget and fridge content and never be hungry again , 
  as long as it covered by lifetime warranty it does n't matter, 
  just out of curiosity : what is the type of source files you have and what are you trying to achieve by converting them ? 
  because `` mkv '' and `` mp4 '' are note codecs but merely a video file containers, 
  i converted my dvd collection to h. 264 mkv using handbrake . 
  mkv containter allowed me to have multiple audio tracks and subtitles . 
  depends on what is your goal ( quality or size ) you can play with bitrate for video and encoding for audio, 
  wait for it . 
  lightning can strike at the last second,
