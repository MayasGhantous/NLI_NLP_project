  how do you think they shipped ? 
  do n't forget to number you drives if you have raid , 
  did he ever return ? 
  no , he never returned, 
  and his fate is still unknown oi !, 
  personally ovi is great . 
  but he does n't play tennis , hockey is team game . 
  when you leading scorer in the league and have next to last + / - you are not good for the team, 
  edit . 
  hey , where 's my johnny rocket flair ? 
  i refused to believe he 's not with us,

  i have wndr4700 and can confirm that it works with usb3 .0 flash drives,

  you might look into [ plex camera upload ] ( https://blog.plex.tv/2014/05/13/camera-upload-android-windows-phone-sync-windows-8/ ) . 
  disclaimer : i have n't use this feature on my plex, 
  i assume you 're already looked [ there ] ( http://forum.kodi.tv/forumdisplay.php?fid=150 ) ? 
  no deflategate/belichik/godell / brady jokes ? 
  anyone ? 
  he was . 
  after attempt to denounce his french citizenship he ended up in russia for couple of years, 
  what version of.net are you trying to install ? 
  couple of things, 
  - are you sure you need a framework rather than runtime ? 
  - you said you 're using window 8 . 
  is there any reason you have n't upgraded it to 8.1 ? 
  if you have windows on both sides of the building draft can work as well as fan, 
  russia - understandable , but what 's up with spain ?

  somebody got rehabilitated, 
  ken hitchcock, 
  `` you honor , my client pleads not guilty on the reason of extreme dumbassery '', 
   it is hard to reach that kind of harmony , of course , but if ukraine tried to provide equal rights for the russian-speaking citizens , making the russian language official , that would wipe out once and for all a possibility to use this language question in any political intrigues . 
  no it would n't . 
  `` equal rights '' mean that all citizens and especially government officials know both languages . 
  like in canada . 
  in ukraine it would have effectively meant that russian speaking clerks in public offices had an excuse to not learn ukrainian . 
  which is the case most of the place in eastern ukraine, 
  in my opinion very few things are cheaper and tastier than stuffed grape leaves . 
  recipes vary from different mediterranean cultures but result is always finger licking good, 
  when i 'm go to ukraine i bring specialty bourbon like knob creek or booker 's . 
  pack it between your clothes and it survives any rough airline handling . 
  never had a dull moment with this gift , 
  on the other side if he 's a handy man may be some cool tool gadget like kobalt tools has would be equally appreciated, 
  what is love ?

  if you stay with comcast consider to ditch cable boxes and get a cablecard tuner like silicondust hdhomerun prime . 
  it can stream all your channels ( even premium ) over local network on your smart tv , computer or any other device that support dlna,

  but i believe you can add second device to add more tuners . 
  yes , at this moment only wmc has recording capabilities . 
  but silicondust is working on [ hdhomerun dvr ] ( https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1275320038/hdhomerun-dvr-the-dvr-re-imagined ) solution and planning to release first beta in a few month,
