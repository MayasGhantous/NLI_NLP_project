  just perfect example how good each member of the band was,

  cabbage and potato are not meant to be stored frozen . 
  on that note [ here 's ] ( http://allrecipes.com/recipe/roasted-cabbage ) a killer recipe for a roasted cabbage . 
  my wife adds bacon to it and cut cabbage heads in quarters . 
  this recipe particularly good for loose leaf cabbage, 
  gps as ** global ** positioning system works everywhere on earth . 
  but wireless data in ukraine is different story . 
  so google maps work fine but i would suggest you to learn how to download offline google maps in case you have no connection, 
  i probably repeating myself every time i reply on / r/htpc but intel 's nuc family of mini-pc is pretty powerful , silent and small . 
  not to menition that it could be used as transcoder and htpc at the same time, 
  [ here 's ] ( https://flirc.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/200712568-logitech-harmony-remotes ) the instruction, 
  we 're men,

  maybe it 's against original recipe but i add table spoon of oil ( sunflower or olive ) to this salad . 
  not only it enhances the flavor but also helps digest beta carotene from carrots,

  replace half of potatoes with 1/2 -3 / 4 cup pearl barley and you can avoid sour cream stuff . 
  just make sure it 's properly cooked before adding potatoes , about 20 min . 
  upvoted even before looking at picture .

  thank you for the reply everybody . 
  do you know by any chance if i can buy sim card in airport ? 
  lister is that you ? 
  rhcp 's `` love rollercoaster '' is better than original , imho . 
  and it 's forever burnt to my memory with the image of butthead fucking invisible skull, 
  put melancholy blues to this list and i 'm 100 % with you, 
  also you can check on startup what type of bios your system has . 
  usually it one out of two : [ ami ] ( http://www.ecs.com.tw/extra/flashutl/images/ami5.jpg ) or [ award ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/23/award_bios_first_screen.png ) . 
  in ami long two short beeps means memory failure, 
  i have that configuration : nuc as plex server/htpc and with attached esata raid enclosure . 
  i was pretty happy until recently i discovered that nuc i3 processor is n't able to transcode x265 files for plex . 
  so my advise would be - either get a nuc with most powerful cpu you can afford or if size of the plex server is not the issue get a system with desktop chipset and cpu, 
  as happy nuc user for 2 years here 's my quick tip . 
  if you 're planning to use it for htpc select the model with built-in ir receiver . 
  it works with virtually any wmc remote control and does n't require any additional setup, 
  putting that coffee in the paper cup is a crime against humanity, 
  chefsteps recommends to pressure cook them for 15 min . 
  not bad idea either, 
  ca n't recommend `` birth of the nation '' enough . 
  but do n't think there 's a part 3 `` together forever '' anywhere on youtube . 
  so pm me if you need it with english narration, 
  have n't checked recently but sp plugins for plex or kodi work perfectly well and do n't require anything . 
  besides plex or kodi or course, 
  this blur called [ interlacing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/interlaced_video ) and your dvd is recorded as interlaced . 
  tv 's output is interlaced by definition of tv signal and set to compensate it . 
  so you have 2 choices : either enable deinterlace during dvd rip ( i 'm not familiar with makemkv so look it up ) or during playback in vlc ( video -  deinterlace -  on ), 
   `` somebody has to be more generous . 
  i do n't think russia and donetsk will be more generous . 
  ukraine 's economy is down . 
  its back is to the wall . 
  they have to let donetsk go -- they should let it go . 
  because this is bringing disaster to the ukrainian economy . 
  let them go . '', 
  the only thing you need to know about this douche and his pseudo free press publication, 
  no , it 's not google . 
  i made quick and dirty transcription for people who ca n't read the article . 
  i 'm sure you have time and inspiration to do a better job, 
  remind me again how do you spell indian city bombay in modern english ? 
  it 's not `` modern english name '' it 's how indian want everyone to spell and pronounce name of that city . 
  and world obliged . 
  same story with kyiv . 
  that 's exactly my point . 
  a country decided how its city supposed to be spelled in modern language despite native name and long term foreign tradition, 
  well shot and narrated documentary about probably most famous cathedral in the world . 
  must see for all architecture and barcelona fanatics,
