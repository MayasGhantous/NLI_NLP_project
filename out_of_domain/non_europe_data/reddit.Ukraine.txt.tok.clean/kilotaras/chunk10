  a little girl is standing on top of a cliff , looking down at the sea and crying her eyes out . 
  a priest approaches and says , `` my child , why are you so upset ? '', 
  the little girl turns to him and says , `` my mummy and daddy were in their car -- and it just rolled over the cliff and smashed on the rocks down there . '', 
  the priest slowly looks around him while unbuttoning his cassock and says , `` it 's just not your day , is it ? '',

  alas we have miracle - aka `` m-god '' aka `` 8 0 0 0 m a t c h m a k i n g p o i n t s '' playing anti-mage and i think he muted all of us . 
   now you might be thinking : `` how the hell does a team function like that ? 
  let alone win ?! '' . 
  well that 's because this is the environment miracle - is used to playing in his 8000 ranked mm games . 
  he ends up playing anti-mage or sf and carries the game 1v9 . 
  we are simply re-creating the environment in which he excels : miracle + four 4k mmr teammates, 
  so no matter what hero i pick the chance of winning is lower that 50 % . 
  sounds about right . 
  i tried to point out that total percentage = ( 167,839,103 + 4,184,156,016 ) / ( 346,421,468 +8,459,488,034 ) = 0.4942 < 0.5 , which does n't look right .
