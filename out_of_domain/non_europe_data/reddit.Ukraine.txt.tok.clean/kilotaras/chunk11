  what ? 
  holy shit , it is . 
  because the bet was $ 100, 
  not sure if double account or just a coincidence . 
  this is so accurate it hurts . 
  i tend to not play at all in solo queue lately , mostly because of this . 
  huh ?

  he got him later - that 's what causes the fight with stick in the apartment . 
  anyone else who want to take a look at more examples - visit http://www.stopfake.org/en/news/, 
  unlike video in question those fakes are targeted on domestic russian population , but the goal is the same : fuel negative emotions towards another country . 
  books were first . 
  the more funny example of this would be `` roadside picnic '' adaptation . 
  there 's a novel [ `` roadside picnic '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/roadside_picnic ) by strugatsky brothers - original . 
  there 's a 1979 film [ `` stalker '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stalker_%281979_film%29 ) , which is loosely based on the book . 
  there 's [ stalker games ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/s.t.a.l.k.e.r._%28series%29 ) - at this points its a game based on a film based on a book . 
  now the success of the games lead to several books set in the same universe . 
  so you have a book based on a game based on a film based on book . 
  in ukraine it 's `` who does n't jump is moscovite '', 
  try finding local guide and go into odessa catacombs . 
  i visited odessa recently , and it was easily the highlight of the trip . 
  also feel free to ping me if/when you decide to hike carpathians . 
  i would love to join you and can also help with route planning and stuff like that . 
  i 'm late for the party but try honey mead next time . 
  horseradish is hit or miss usually so there 's that .

  that would be `` mistere '', 
  before people start bashing ukraine . 
   vg.r.nono was unable to secure his passport, 
   aliexpress, 
  something about doing everything for your race and killing off other races . 
  wait a minute . 
  riot actually did great with this . 
  they added option `` low skill '' and most likely just ignore it . 
  obviously you would send your best caster to a place with a tournament . 
  ca n't comment on a tour , but keep in mind that the climb can be quite challenging . 
  also , try asking on / r/ukraine, 
   afterwards it calculates heal * 2-damage and does that amount in heal/damage .
