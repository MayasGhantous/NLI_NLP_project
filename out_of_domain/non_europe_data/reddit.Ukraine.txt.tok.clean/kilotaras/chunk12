  actually it works in two steps . 
  heal x2, 
  damage x1, 
  so even if you heal for over 9000 you only need to damage for maxhp and target is dead anyway .

  imei can also be changed/spoofed . 
  if we 're talking rooted android it 's literally a press of the button . 
  their universe version of [ operation phoenix ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5qfxni7gdy ) worked . 
  xprivacy has an option of spoofing imei to whatever you want . 
  that should probably be legal .

  at that point there 's not a lot of difference . 
  you spend less on apartment and food . 
  you spend the same or more ( 2x more in some cases ) for iphones , cars , etc. 
  i 'm a software engineer living in ukraine . 
  it does n't add up that quickly . 
  yep , you 're correct . 
  let me expand my original comment . 
  i 've lived both in ukraine and us . 
  you would typically spend around $ 300-500 on housing in ukraine and $ 1500-3000 in us depending on location . 
  the thing is dendi 's total earnings are close to a million right now . 
  at this point difference in cost of living does n't make that big of impact . 
  for example due to high import tax ` a good car + 12 month of living expenses ` cost ** more ** in ukraine than in us .

  meanwhile cr1t 's spamming `` good game '' on the chat wheel while typing `` i am dead '' every other second . 
  alas we have miracle - aka `` m-god '' aka `` 8 0 0 0 m a t c h m a k i n g p o i n t s '' playing anti-mage and i think he muted all of us . 
   now you might be thinking : `` how the hell does a team function like that ? 
  let alone win ?! '' . 
  well that 's because this is the environment miracle - is used to playing in his 8000 ranked mm games . 
  he ends up playing anti-mage or sf and carries the game 1v9 . 
  we are simply re-creating the environment in which he excels : miracle + four 4k mmr teammates,

  in ukraine you 're eligible to pay the number that is on the sticker,

  i really dislike the whole `` traffic accident '' thing . 
  it downplays the role of driver ( s ) in what happened . 
  a car hitting an oil patch and swerving is an accident . 
  an asshole texting and hitting someone most definitely is n't .
