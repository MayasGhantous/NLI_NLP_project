  it depends on the country , but usually veto can be overruled by supermajority .

  i feel like gmos are getting the nuclear treatment . 
  by focusing on ** theoretically possible ** negative effects we ignore the negatives of current methods . 
  gmos can, 
  - reduce amount of agricultural land by increasing yields . 
  - reduce forest loss to forestry . 
  trees that are ready for cutting in a couple of years . 
  sign me up !, 
  edit : thanks for popping my gold cherry kind stranger, 
  it 's co2 neutral . 
  tree dies , rots , co2 goes right back to atmosphere . 
  that actually what was happening millions of years ago , and why we have fossil fuels . 
  this lead to evolving of bacterias , that `` eat '' dead tree - that 's what we perceive as rotting . 
  those bacterias will take o2 out of atmosphere , carbon from the tree and produce co2 back into atmosphere . 
   coal , oil , gases, 
  come from the time before decomposing bacteria evolved . 
  both , i guess . 
  i 'm not saying it wo n't work , only that blindly planting trees everywhere wo n't be as helpful . 
  also when we 're talking about industrial usage of forests we 're talking more carbon footprint ( factories , transportation , etc. 
  ) , so - until we 're 80-90 percent renewable it requires some calculations to see if such a process would be carbon negative . 
  it would definitely be better than current process of just cutting existing trees though . 
  chernobyl and fukushima while bad are definitely not anthropocene extinction events and event are n't that bad in medium run ( talking 10s of years ) . 
  climate change on the other hand . 
  anyway the point is n't to blindly pick the latest technical process , but to have careful and nuanced discussion , backed by cold , hard numbers . 
  in case of nuclear those numbers say that it 's a lot safer that fossils , even with chornobyl and fukushima . 
   what you 're advocating is scientism which is just a modern religion . 
  according to [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scientism ) : scientism is a term used to describe the universal applicability of the scientific method and approach . 
  i 'm not sure that 's bad . 
  they 're in some cases , not so much in others , e.g. 
  forestry . 
   if a person or company ca n't expect a reward commensurate with the risk of making such technological advancements , why should they even bother ? 
  what if we had some kind of big organization we pay a percentage of our income into that can spend it on beneficial projects . 
   even in the face of russia 's aggression , ukraine has accomplished a great deal domestically . 
  we applaud recent reform successes , including anti-corruption efforts and pursuing necessary reforms to meet imf conditionality . 
   the united states continues to urge ukraine to redouble its efforts to implement challenging reforms , including uprooting corruption , increasing transparency in the judicial system , strengthening the banking sector , and pursuing corporate governance reform and the privatization of state-owned enterprises . 
  we must continue to support ukraine on its reform path . 
   it serves no purpose for ukraine to fight for its body in donbas if it loses its soul to corruption . 
  anti-corruption institutions must be supported , resourced , and defended . 
   even in the face of ongoing russian aggression , ukraine is committed to an ambitious effort to reform and modernize its armed forces according to nato standards by 2020 . 
   while russian aggression makes reforms more challenging , it also renders them more urgent . 
   we applaud the goals set out in the strategic defense bulletin that president poreshenko presented to allies in warsaw , and we look forward to its full implementation .
