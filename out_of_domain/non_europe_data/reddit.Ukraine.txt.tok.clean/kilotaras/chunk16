  number of ukrainians granted refugee status in poland, 
  but most of those are not refugees from combat zones but simple economic migrants from safe territories . 
  so the question is akin to asking if there 's a general felling of gratitude towards uk for taking ~ 1mn of polish refugees . 
  inspired by the sticky . 
  what do you know about poland policy towards ukrainians in interwar period ( 1920-1939 ) ? 
  here 's answers to some of them . 
   let 's start with simple one : what did you eat yesterday ? 
  pickled mushrooms and salo . 
   i noticed , that this sub is in mixed russian ( even in sidebar ) and ukrainian . 
  but message and stance seems to be clearly anti-kremlin . 
  why is that ? 
  you can read a bit about it [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/theukrainians/wiki/why_new_sub ), 
   also , what do you think about whole `` language problem '' in ukraine ? 
  what language do you speak on daily basis ? 
  ukrainian . 
  the language problem is basically : `` we should be able to not speak ukrainian in ukraine . '', 
  see also : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chronology_of_ukrainian_language_suppression, 
   give me your music !, 
  i 'm already familiar ( yet ) with chur , haydamaky , hutir , joryj k\u0142oc , leprikonsy , mad heads , and hilarious mp who sings about food . 
  i need more . 
  [ onuka ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/onukaofficial ), 
   worst ukrainian ever ? 
  i 'm asking about most despicable characters in your history ( not serial killers etc. ) . 
  in recent history . 
  our ex-president yanukovych . 
   where do you see ukraine in 2030 ? 
  i 've recently learned about [ overconfidence effect ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/overconfidence_effect ) . 
  so all i can say i 'm pretty sure ukraine will still be located between poland and russia . 
  central and east which were under soviet occupation and survived holodomor are usually focused on that . 
  in the west the whole period is largely seen as `` poland did some pretty shitty things to us , then we did some really shitty things to poles , let 's leave it in the past and do n't measure shit-dicks . '', 
   what 's your opinion on our shared history ? 
  do you generally regret that turned out how they did ? 
  do you think that wolyn was justified by the oppression from poles ? 
  justified - no . 
  understanding motivation behind it - maybe . 
  the same can be said about the anti-ukrainian policies of interwar polish government . 
   what do you think of us ? 
  is it history driven ? 
  generally speaking no , it 's not history driven . 
  i do n't really have a good answer to the first part though . 
   have you got relatives recently moving to/working in poland ? 
  any personal stories ? 
  my gf was visiting poland as a teacher with a group of schoolchildren this summer . 
  a museum worker told them they 're not from ukraine , but eastern poland . 
   are you aware of this ? 
  in 1990 typical ukrainian was wealthier than pole . 
  personally feel bad for the amount of time it seem you wasted . 
  what do you think is the reason ? 
  politicians ? 
  society that was afraid of reforms ? 
  massive corruption ( that would probably be 50/50 politicians and society ) . 
  any others, 
  failed ( either deliberately or through incompetence ) mass-privatization combined with economy dominated by few giants led to rise of several oligarchs which used that money to influence politics and extract rent . 
   university for ukrainians located in warsaw, 
  while simultaneously limiting number of ukrainians in lviv university to 15 % . 
  it 's a rather unknown fact that oun ( there was no upa at the time ) was a fringe party/organization circa 1920 . 
  their popularity was steadily increasing in response to polish policies and by mid-late 1930s they enjoyed a rather wide support . 
   uo\u00d6 organizes ukrainian language teaching within the sunday school system .
