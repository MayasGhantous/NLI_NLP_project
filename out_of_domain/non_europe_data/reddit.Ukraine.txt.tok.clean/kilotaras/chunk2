  or so i heard . 
  i once played vs galio as garen . 
  silenced him 5 times during ult . 
  got reported for cheating . 
  then my poppy will push you all way to fountain, 
  and thats why i am not going to play skyrim till sumer 2012 . 
  this and need to eat and study . 
  a cow ? 
  well i think of lee sin . 
  * you must deal more damage if they are weak to gift them with quick death *, 
  its still greyed out . 
  just like in gold good season 1 . 
  try reading alloy of law . 
  it starts being interesting . 
  the end . 
  was my , untill i read kingkiller chronicles . 
  do n't get me wrong . 
  i loved it . 
  it just seems ... short and unfinished . 
  it 's similiar to lotr in the way , that you should read it all , not only first part . 
  sadly there is no second part yet . 
  waiting seems a good option . 
  if you want to find some high fantasy , consider looking [ here ] ( http://www.goodreads.com/genres/high-fantasy ) . 
  the best thing about it is that it converts books automatically once you select send to kindle . 
  so the algorithm is :, 
  1 ) open calibre, 
  2 ) add book ( s ) to calibre ( the easiest way is drag 'n' drop ), 
  3 ) connect your kindle to pc via usb, 
  4 ) select books you want to send, 
  5 ) right click -  send to device, 
  i think that someone did , because you can see those things for more than 5 years . 
  but its definitely not me . 
  that 's funny , as i played support gp recently . 
  last pick instalock singed . 
  just my 5 cents :, 
  which one is simpler to catch ? 
  ** edit ** : will you release source code as well ? 
  adobe air has nothing to do with platform of game itself . 
   the guys a few hours every week for achievements, 
  things are not so simple . 
  most people would require 1-2 days to understand existing code and than start creating their own , so it would n't work that way . 
  ** p.s. 
  ** a woman can have a baby in 9 months , but 9 women wont have a baby in 1 month . 
  build a tf on every single champion . 
  call it phreakschool . 
  dying to turrets does n't affect death/kil streaks . 
  is that a nipple . 
  enlarges images . 
  nope , just dirty monitor . 
  she 's from north , so nope . 
  now i see where od ~ ~ i ~ ~ ** y ** n 's veil comes from . 
  * ninja edit : * thanks zalax, 
  the problem is he can, 
  1 ) kill one , maybe 2 of you , die , and have a lot of your abilities on cd, 
  2 ) deal some damage to you , get away , heal on q , heal from jungle creeps , return to fight, 
  he 's from some far land , dont remember the name . 
  he also doesnt say where it is located . 
  if you played ashe they ran off , when they saw tp . 
  but if you drop a ward in the middle of lane ... 
  udyr 's true love . 
  fabulous . 
  sighs . 
  on spellcast regenerate 50hp and 25 mana ( not sure about numbers ) over 2s to all nearby allied champions . 
  what would you say about bloodrazor stacking ? 
  a minion champ !, 
  it doesnt really matter , because they all use irc for chat . 
  so basically they already are able to log chat from game , so logging chat from pre/post game ca n't be that hard . 
  run , it 's my wife . 
  47 euw, 
  it is . 
  scoreboard from left to right, 
  blue dragons, 
  dragon head, 
  blue gold, 
  dragon head,

  first pick sona , suddenly . 
  i 'm wondering will regi pull out his secret ap now . 
  finally . 
  you want counterjungle , die . 
  28.00 in 2nd game . 
  and i believe we will see the third one . 
  * edit : * ** first ** lost game for m5 in all tournament . 
  you have to clear all waves . 
  minions spawn from 1.30 , every 30 seconds + 1 canon every 3 waves . 
  enemy team have more trolls then your ( unless you are trolling ) . 
  fun fact : we now have one of the warmest winter in ~ 10 years . 
  it was n't real winter . 
  i live in ukraine and i know what i 'm saying . 
  `` king robert has his warhammer , and i have my mind . 
  and a mind needs books as a sword needs a whetstone , if it is to keep its edge '' - tyrion lannister, 
  2 towers + inhib for baron . 
  can someone clarify if its worth ? 
  more like :, 
  a : i wont support,

  a : go fuck your mum .
