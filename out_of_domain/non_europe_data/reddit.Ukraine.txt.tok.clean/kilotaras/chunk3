   8 of my wife 's, 
  read it as 8 of my wifes, 
  i believe , its because you dont need to check every object , only the moving ones . 
  imho it 's about nothing . 
  the book is just setting up the world and backstory . 
  first was one was pretty one sided . 
  what will happen in play 2 ? 
  learn russian . 
  usually its translators words . 
  i believe that already built systems like [ domjudge ] ( http://domjudge.sourceforge.net/intro ) are what we need . 
  step4 : never ever put smite on [ yourignitekey ], 
  there is a system called ejudge , that has client side in browser , but its documentation is in russian , or at least i didnt found english one . 
  jetbrains , the company that makes resharper , also has rubymine and phpstorm . 
  spoiler alert . 
  wow , so quick , but lets hope , people will send more keys in here . 
  so i asked my roommate why life was so hard . . 
  he responded , `` how else would it fuck you ? '', 
  i played a lot of lol , but i dont like the way it 's going , so now i want a key to dota 2 .

  still didnt get a key , but already uninstalled lol . 
  reasons :, 
  1 ) replays : lolreplay is out there for almost a year , created just from the client executable , not even code , and still no replays from riot . 
  2 ) stats : i have a good mathematical background , i like stats , a lot of them . 
  i want more than k/d/a ratios . 
  3 ) item path : how many different item builds do you see on carry . 
  1 + 1 on kog ` maw . 
  i want a game , where i ** dont ** have to build boots and then ie or i loose . 
  i 'm really good at algorithms , but the thing is there 's a whole qa site for this called stackoverflow.com , so proggit doesnt have a lot of questions . 
  you can check my [ profile there ] ( http://stackoverflow.com/users/208527/kilotaras ) and see that i really answer a lot . 
  dont know if this counts though . 
  just in case my steam profile : http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198042695341, 
  yes , yes , yes . 
  i promise to do the same thing if i have a spare key .

  my money on petr . 
  he always wins . 
  codejam is older then twitter . 
  not an exam , but still : all-ukrainian mathematics school contest , last stage . 
  and if talk only about exams : probability theory and statistics , maybe math modelling, 
  lucky you , on my tests i write `` we can notice that ... '' and my professor says : `` it is n't the way i wanted you to solve it '' . 
  never try it on exams after that . 
  well from my experience around half of big chat talks are `` philosophy of raging '' , `` chinese living in caves '' , etc. 
  spam q + r from base . 
  fountain mana regen will give the ablility to cast it every 3-10 sec depending on mana . 
  i think he 's talking about corbinos who is a redditor for one year . 
  `` king robert has his warhammer , and i have my mind . 
  and a mind needs books as a sword needs a whetstone , if it is to keep its edge '', 
  george r. r. martin - song of ice and fire - 1600x900,

  i have a strange feeling of [ deja vu ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/jokes/search?q=what%27s+the+difference+between+oral+sex+and+anal+sex%3f&amp;restrict_sr=on ) . 
  the smell . 
  sorry , i meant the smell . 
  was he feeding intentionally ? 
  being bad is n't something you report for . 
  easier to use formula for dps increase on any crit :, 
  - ( crit_damage-1 ) * crit_chance . 
  putin is a current president of russian federation . 
  it will have workshop like tf2 . 
  user-generated content -  voting -  selection by valve -  percentage from selling, 
  also , they should reply `` we have a method '' to questions from other party . 
  `` i do '' is n't the correct form of answer for `` no one here speaks russian '', 
  take it google translate . 
  ~ -  ping, 
  need console enabled . 
  it says that they do n't take actions against unskilled . 
  i think it 's for throwing those reports to / dev/null, 
  [ here ] ( http://oboobs.ru ) , have some love . 
  you do realize that scotland is part of britain ? 
  yey , fellow ukrainian on reddit . 
   2.6.4 all playoff matches except the grand final are best of three, 
   round 3 of the lower bracket will be called the lower bracket final , round 3.5 the consolation final . 
  the winner of the consolation final reaches the grand final , the loser finishes the defense 2 as third place . 
  winner of the lb final vs loser of the ub final . 
  take a look at [ this page ] ( http://www.the-defense.com/en/statics/overview ) . 
  loser from upper bracket moves to the respective .5 round of loser bracket . 
  consolation final , or round 3.5 of lb is winner of lb final vs loser of up final . 
  loser will get 3d place , winner will advance to grand final , where they will compete vs col. 
  semifinal is n't the best name too , because then we must call ub final semifinal . 
  just imagine :, 
   so clg lost a semifinal to col. now they 'll play vs. mouz in semifinal to enter final vs col. 
  according to [ this ] ( http://www.joindota.com/en/live/tobiwan ) tobi wan will stream it . 
  i 'll add more streams to post as soon as they are announced . 
   why reddit does n't like when `` this post is x hours and y minutes '' if y is n't 0 ? 
  because it says submitted z hours ago , not z hours and q minutes . 
  right now i look at the post and see submitted 1 hour ago . 
  i have no idea if it was 1 hour and 2 minutes or 1 hour and 52 minutes ago . 
  til . 
  i 'm really disappointed with potm bottom not being in the tournament . 
  from the defense rules . 
   round 3 of the lower bracket will be called the lower bracket final , round 3.5 the * consolation * final . 
  the winner of the consolation final reaches the grand final , the loser finishes the defense 2 as third place . 
  bm is beastmaster and ... ? 
  psssss . 
  let them think i was joking .
