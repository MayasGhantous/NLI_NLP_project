  on a more serious note i always thought of broodmother as simply brood . 
  ukraine - [ ivan kotlyarevsky ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ivan_kotlyarevsky ) and [ taras shevchenko ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/taras_shevchenko ) . 
  kotlyarevsky with his `` eneida '' is called a * pioneer * of modern ukrainian literature . 
  shevchenko , who lived shortly after kotlyarevsky is called a * founder * of modern ukrainian literature . 
  i once received more change then i should have when i was a child . 
  thanks for awesome tool woofington . 
  go to dev.dota2.com -  bugs section . 
  post match id and time . 
  it wo n't give you karma . 
  but it will help improve game . 
  i 'm wondering if some part of that $ 0.99 will go the team . 
  it looks like you a word . 
   take my love , take my land, 
   take me where i can not stand, 
   i do n't care , i 'm still free, 
   you ca n't take the sky from me ... 
  i want ** firefly ** back . 
  i have a small 1 in arial narrow on my forehead - playing knights with neighbor as a kid ( we were 7 and 8 respectively ), 
  5cm horizontal scar , that looks like zipper in the middle of right leg - `` everyone have so much fun in the water . '', 
  - * entering . 
  falling down . 
  * - `` wtf i can touch a hole in my leg . '', 
  - * getting up . 
  screams around . 
  `` who the fuck throws glass bottles in the water '' . 
  ah , sweet ukraine . 
  how can you have ( -1 ) negative point ? 
  finally . 
  i was looking forward to it . 
  ** edit : ** v1lat screaming bkbeshechka , black hole is awesome . 
  i once found i 'm a typical [ dont remember who ] , after telling i was born on 30th of february . 
   kiss ... while your lips are still red, 
  nightwish, 
  and kill rubick ? 
  prophit 's tp is n't a channeled spell , but net prevents location changing abilitie ( blinks , tps , etc. ), 
  time difference . 
  1 ) attack starts ( check for evasion , miss and crit ), 
  [ 1.5 ] projectile flies, 
  2 ) projectile hits ( check for backtrack , still proc on-hit effects ), 
  so probability of nullifying right-click damage is, 
  you can use a bunch of prepared . cfg files and then just type `` exec ench '' in console . 
  [ nerd mode on ], 
  not it does n't . 
  if women are people , it does n't mean that every person is a woman . 
  [ nerd mode off ], 
  intern from ukraine here , quoting my norwegian manager : `` yes , but the bar is a little higher . '', 
  does anyone have a script of speech . 
  it was epic . 
  ninja grammar edit : not a native speaker . 
  found [ video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ium6npcwjvs ) at least . 
  here in ukraine you can something similar for ~ $ 12 . 
  technically , its not valve problem . 
  bad guys get your ip from skype and pay $ 10-15 to ddos shit out of you . 
  you may want to write both names as [ rox.kis now try to guess who has such a long name ] ( / spoiler ), 
  i and a couple of friends are planning on drinking/watching/screaming ** navi ** during night and sleep during day . 
  oh , and we 're from ukraine . 
  enigma instantly bkbed and didnt get ravaged , so tide had no time to cast anchor smash . 
  also rubick forcestaffing himself out of the ravage made it so special . 
  translation : black blob used an item that gives magic immunity in short window between sleep off and mass stun guy actually stunning . 
  a small green man that can steal enemy spells used another item that `` pushed '' him outside of mass stun range in the same small window . 
  you can do it with any keyboard using 3d party tools . 
  even more . 
  with an engine like source engine you can do it adding 1 line to autoexec.cfg, 
  ediit : steam engine, 
  your math makes me sad . 
  two 25cm pizzas are n't equal to a 50 cm one . 
  edit : 5 gems = ~ 2460 radius of area . 
  50 sentries ~ 990, 
  buy gem = / = hold gem, 
   gem only covers 1100 radius , ( 5500 max after buying them non-stop for 40 minutes and never dying ) . 
  there is no limit to how much vision sentries can give . 
  50 sets of sentries give 7000 . 
  5 circles with 1100 radius have smaller area then one with 5500 . 
   40 % with 2 sources of crit, 
  slightly less actually . 
  if you have two crits highest multiplier wins . 
  if they are the same chance of critting is 0.2 +0.2 -0.2 * 0.2 = 36 %, 
  small improvement request - convert time to timeandate.com links as in [ 15:00 cest ( gmt +2 ) / 9am edt/6am pdt ] ( http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?&amp;day=13&amp;month=5&amp;year=2013&amp;hour=15&amp;min=0&amp;sec=0&amp;p1=48 ), 
  i think it makes sense to have two timers . 
  1 . time left on aegis - visible only when aegis is still unused and less then 2 minutes left . 
  2 . time till rosh - visible if less then 2-3 minutes is left . 
  the point is : i do n't really care if its 9 minutes or 8:15 . 
  i do care if its 1:30 or 45s . 
  see edit . 
  i 'm not dev - try emailing d2warenet@gmail.com, 
  blink dagger - core on [ queen of pain ] ( / spoiler ), 
  because the 38 damage threshold was a `` pretty dirty '' fix for radiance bats . 
  there 's no reason to have same mechanics in dota 2 . 
  see also luna and maelstorm . 
  a hundred compendiums . 
  bruno really wants techies . 
  who cut the onion ? 
  the thing is most rus/ukrainian pubbers are n't clueless . 
  its that you have no idea that `` that guy who speaks english and buy wards '' is actually from cis . 
  i was getting no steam logon , which was fixed by restarting steam . 
  i noticed a small mistake . 
  in the end temperature on forecast is in fahrenheit . 
  in local game . 
  you have cooldown which is equal to effective ping in wc3 , because armlet is implemented as two items . 
  would n't mind a key .
