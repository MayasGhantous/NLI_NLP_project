  saying that kyiv rus ' and russia are the same is basically saying that romania and rome empire are the same .

  it was called tsardom of muscovy before that .

  1939 : west ukraine becomes part of the ussr . 
  people are cheering on the street as they 're happy to be part of big ukraine after more than 200 years . 
  1941 : hitler soldiers enter west ukraine . 
  people are cheering as they 're happy that soviets are out . 
  think about it . 
  it took less than two years for attitude to change 180 degrees .

   but charges will not be dropped unless protesters vacate government buildings and clear a barricade in kiev , the authorities warned,

  people can be detained before trial as a preventive measure . 
  they 're still charged with mass riots , which is punished with 7-15 ** years ** of incarceration .

  [ sanity_prevails explained why those doesnt matter ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1yfqmd/heartbreaking_photos_of_ukrainian_protesters_today/cfk5qd3 ), 
  please take a look at [ sanity_prevails comment ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1yfqmd/heartbreaking_photos_of_ukrainian_protesters_today/cfk5qd3 ) over at / r/pics, 
  he explained a lot of common misconceptions , that unfortunately are still dominant in western media . 
  ** myth : ** terms like `` russian '' , `` russian-speaking '' , `` russian ethnicity '' , and `` pro-russia '' are the same and can be used interchangeably . 
  ** reality : ** they are very different and understanding the nuance matters . 
  putinist propagandists regularly purposefully conflate such terms to give the impression of support where none exists . 
  russsian-speaking ukrainians in general no more want to join russia politically than english-speaking irish in dublin want to become english . 
  two decades of independent polling data conclusively shows that the citizens of ukraine , regardless of whether they speak russian or ukrainian as their first language , solidly view themselves politically as ukrainian and ukrainian only . 
  the `` let 's join russia '' fringe political party in ukraine got zero seats in the last parliament . 
  see [ this comment ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1yfqmd/heartbreaking_photos_of_ukrainian_protesters_today/cfk5qd3 ) for better insight . 
  '' ... he saw how titushky are beheading protesters . 
  two people were beheaded , two were being scalped '' - [ one of the protesters ] ( http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=uk&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=uk&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.pravda.com.ua%2fphoto-video%2f2014%2f02%2f26%2f7016338%2f&amp;act=url ), 
  exactly the reason it wont happen again . 
  people do n't trust any politician . 
  right now there 're a couple dozens of different control initiatives , from patrolling with road police to system for direct voting for different law initiatives . 
  the thing about crimea is it 's fucked without ukraine . 
  almost all drinkable water comes from outside the peninsula . 
  you ca n't forget that according to 1994 nuclear disarm treaty usa and uk ( as well as russia ) guarantee sovereignty of ukraine in its 1994 borders . 
  if things get ugly , people that will suffer most are actually crimeans . 
  crimea is in no way self-sustainable ( almost all drinkable water comes from `` main '' ukraine ) . 
  plus there 're already reports of drop in tour sells , that will hit people pretty hard once the summer comes . 
  [ 123 % ] ( http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=uk&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fteh-nomad.livejournal.com%2f2007998.html&amp;act=url ) of sevastopol ** total ** population voted yes . 
  there 's also a [ small issue ] ( http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=uk&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fteh-nomad.livejournal.com%2f2007998.html&amp;act=url ) of more than 120 % of total population voting in some regions . 
   the turnout was around 85 % ,, 
  [ in some regions it was as high as 123 % ] ( http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=uk&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fteh-nomad.livejournal.com%2f2007998.html&amp;act=url ), 
  the city is called l'viv, 
  it is statement by official local branch of right sector saying that other organizations that work under its name have to become part of its structure . 
  take a look at scotland planned referendum . 
  except it was actually ussr government who expelled between 100 and 150 thousands of polish population from city alone . 
  how do you feel about situation in ukraine ? 
   eastern ukraine is largely pro-russian . 
  where do you get this from ? 
  [ early march poll ] ( http://www.cityam.com/blog/1393929175/poll-shows-not-one-majority-any-ukrainian-region-favours-joining-russia ) puts the eastern figure at ~ 33 % . 
  russian-speaking = / = pro-russian . 
  its the same as saying that ireland is largely for joining uk as 94 percent of them speak english . 
  [ night of november , 30th ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl-6egq28gw ) - use of force before ** any ** actions were taken by protesters ( beside actually protesting ) . 
  [ did the police beat them ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl-6egq28gw ) before they [ protesters ] took any action ? 
  did the government basically made any protest illegal ? 
  because that 's what happened * before * molotovs were used . 
   police beats disobeying people, 
  which was n't the case back then . 
  [ article with slightly more information ] ( http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/sbu-says-pro-russia-separatists-take-60-people-hostage-in-luhansk-342586.html ) , though not by much . 
  [ 11th of december ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/11/kiev-protests-police-barricades-chainsaws ) ? 
  president goes full retard , eventually flees the country . 
  congress takes authority , while waiting three months for new elections . 
  tsarev - the guy who, 
  does n't know when ww ii started , despite talking about atrocities that happened during it . 
  told the separatists he 'll do anything to disrupt presidential elections . 
  and thats only in april .
