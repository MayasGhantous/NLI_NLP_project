  civilian causalities are mainly due to returning fire as dnr/lnr tends to put artillery inside civilian areas . 
  see for example this video from 17th : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fedofpnl5do, 
  rough translation below . 
  dnr put mortars in private sector . 
   railway station that way , appr . 
   peski that way , appr . 
   and airport that way , appr 2.5-3 km . 
  avdeevka is also that way , around 12 km . 
   there 's fighting right now in airport . 
  you can hear it . 
  but video is about sounds from militia mortars . 
  they are hiding behind civilians . 
  i 'm telling you with 100 % . 
  here you see automobiles on the road . 
  pedestrians are walking . 
  village is living . 
   sound is very loud . 
  village takes about two kilometers that way . 
  from the sound you can tell that militia is standing in the village . 
   maybe in one of the empty buldings . 
  so those are brave protectors of civilians . 
   here , broken branches . 
  part of the roof is destroyed . 
   mine `` octiabrska '' is about 1.5 km that way . 
   two towers big ? 
  * ( did n't get that ) *, 
   two volleys again . 
  those are mortars shooting . 
  you can hear that this is explosion inside tube . 
  mortar sound , ca n't be confused with anything else . 
   quite loud . 
  people make more videos like this , about militia . 
  this is all myth . 
  we 're being used . 
   that 's why shells from ukrainian army are coming this way . 
  because militia is hiding behind our backs . 
  it 's, 
  dishonorable . 
   volleys again . 
  people are walking . 
  there 's fighting in airport . 
  maybe it is a terminal that way . 
   if i was fighting , i 'd put mortars in the mine , at the pool . 
  there 's a lot of places . 
  destroyed village that way . 
  no , they need to hide , to destroy the city . 
  to pin it on the ua army . 
  they are doing it . 
   you can hear shots . 
  village ends near terricon . 
  they are standing before it . 
  one more mortar , near railway station , in the village . 
  mortar . 
   people are living here . 
  dog is barking . 
  someone is giving food to that dog . 
  automobiles are driving . 
  people are walking . 
  even 6a bus from railway station to the mine . 
  people are being put under fire . 
  shame . 
   you can hear volleys from peski . 
   airport is the sector from here to here .

  frame from lifenews that shows gas mask . 
  notice that the crate does n't have dust on it , which means that it was probably brought there after fighting .
