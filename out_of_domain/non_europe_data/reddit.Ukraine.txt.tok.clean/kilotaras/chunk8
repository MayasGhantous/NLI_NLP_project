  4:0 so far , they 're in . 
  that may be the most useful bot ever . 
   skinned alive the ukrainian wives and daughters of men who joined the red army, 
  that is one bold claim to make without any kind of credible source . 
  they did one even before , [ in 2012 for example ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dopjsfkfolo ) . 
  this is actually march commemorating the [ battle of kruty ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_kruty ), 
  [ more like 400 ] ( http://gamesystemrequirements.com/games.php?id=10 ), 
  - 29th of november - around 10-20k people on maidan . 
  - night of 30th - people ( mostly students ) dispersed and beaten , bloodly . 
  - 1st of december - 400k-800k people on maidan . 
  it was n't the eu that sparkled the ** mass ** protest . 
  see : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/timeline_of_the_euromaidan, 
  russia claimed that budapest memorandum is invalid because government changed . 
  by that logic they should ask for repay from one individual in rostov . 
  22.1 `` in battle situation commander can use weapon or give order to use weapon to subordinates if its impossible to stop crime/offence in other way . 
  ** weapon use should not result in death ** . 
  if possible commander should alarm the person using voice or shooting in the air before using force , special devices or weapon . 
  this hero buys an item . 
  * hovers mouse over bkb *, 
  i was forewarned ? 
  cache that shit . 
  [ a friend of mine added subtitles to this . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghlsqbbhhvg ), 
   in debaltseve militants led by deputy chief of land forces of the russian federation . 
  looks very similar . 
  translation : we 'll receive new humanitarian convoy soon . 
  that much of ammunition would be blown up before retreat . 
  actually means `` holiday '' in the context . 
   party of tyahnybok already created a project of 1000 hryvna note , that represent the values of new ukrainian government . 
  just to clarify - [ banknotes in ukraine go up to 500 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ukrainian_hryvnia#current_series ) . 
   casinos being the shady businesses, 
  all casinos are outlawed since 2009 . 
  shady is putting this mildly . 
  slava nasii - glory to the nation . 
  how the fuck is it not protected ? 
  does dnr takes any area they want to wager offensive at , declare it `` exclusion '' and attack ? 
  casinos are illegal everywhere in ukraine since 2009 . 
  you can see previous discussion here, 
   russia will never annex crimea . 
   russia will never attack mainland ukraine . 
  russia will never attack finland ? 
  first mention of chernihiv - [ 907 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chernihiv#history ) a. d. , moscow - [ 1147 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moscow#history ) . 
  sounds about right . 
  videos in ukraine are filmed by locals . 
  you did 27 tower damage . 
  that 's a win in my book . 
  afaik , some monsters are slayed with iron . 
  this is special meteor iron though . 
  afaik it was possible at some point in the past . 
  can only be used once . 
  buffs do n't stack . 
   ukraine could not use the nukes, 
  could not use right away . 
  ukraine definitely had ( and probably still has ) capacity to change whatever locks were in place , seeing as they were developed partly in ukraine . 
   hinting that when alvin disappeared he teleported himself back in, 
  time and grew up to become jacques de aldersberg, 
  god , i 've completely missed that . 
  anyone interested should check http://witcher.wikia.com/wiki/alvin#speculation_about_alvin, 
   in 1939 red army and bundeswehr performed joined aggression against poland and after the victory held joined military parade in brest . 
  is red army/ussr `` collaborant '' of nazi ? 
  why not ? 
  what about this ? 
  colonel golovyn , head of one of the police departments exchanged himself for women . 
  earlier reports told that he persuaded the man to give up but this post says it was special forces that `` kicked the detonator out of his hands '', 
  i believe comment was predicting `` we 've captured these weapons from ukraine '' . 
  i 've used http://fsymbols.com/generators/wide/, 
  it processes on everything that is n't zero cd . 
  you have effective cd equal to your attack speed on orbs . 
  * edit * : and i 'm wrong `` does not trigger on any active attack modifier , except for arcane orb '' - http://dota2.gamepedia.com/outworld_devourer#abilities, 
  according to grubyy [ consul ] official russia stance is that these soldiers had their contracts expired in december 2014 , they 're mercenaries and have nothing in common with russian army . 
  russia is doing everything to contain such `` mercenaries '' inside dnr and lnr . 
  russia international image is damaged otherwise . 
  soldiers are shocked by such a position from their country and claim that it 's a lie . 
  the source is defendant of one of the captured soldiers . 
  special / u/proteteus edition, 
  wow . 
  i got a little dizzy just watching that . 
  except actual rockets were developed in ukraine . 
  ukraine could n't fire rockets right away . 
  but it definitely had the capability to change whatever locks were in place . 
  think about it this way : hotwiring modern car is hard . 
  changing whole ignition system in a couple of moths is relatively easy . 
   plenty of their fighters do as well, 
  would you please provide a ** single ** video supporting this statement ? 
  what about interregion money movement . 
  donetsk was taking a lot in subsidies during 2011-2013 . 
  here 's image from 2013 . 
  so 3 out of those 67 were transferred to national budget , with 64 staying in donbass . 
  yet 13 more were transfered in form of subsidies from natioanl budget . 
  how is this `` feeding ukraine '' ? 
  were and when was it ? 
  i 've never heard of something like that . 
  in my city we actually have two restaurants from chain of tourist restaurants that may look scammy . 
  the first one one has 10x prices on everything but offers 90 % discounts for `` chain members '' if you do n't have a member card , staff can use their own and get those nice bonuses . 
  the second one is called `` golden rose '' where you get ridiculous bill and have to haggle it down . 
  needless to say that both of those can look like scam if you do n't know this . 
  an old man with old car crashed into a brand new bmw in russia . 
  four big guys jump out of the bmw and say to the old man :, 
  - that 's it grandpa . 
  you 're fucked .
