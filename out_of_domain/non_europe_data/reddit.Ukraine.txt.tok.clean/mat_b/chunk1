he 's 9 weeks , btw, 
  the master cat race !, 
  how old ? 
  what the fuck you looking at ? 
  exactly , it 's just showing your public reviews to your friends . 
  if you 're oky with posting a public review , why would anyone in their right mind be against a friend seeing a public review ? 
  people against this are retarded . 
  stop reviewing things if you do n't want google to know what you think of things . 
  berp . 
  actually is dolan, 
  lookin awesome , cool to see one of the cats i was looking at on musecoons develop on reddit, 
  my guy at 5.5 months :, 
  code optimization is a real thing , though a game could easily be more optimized for windows or linux . 
  a console may be able to do more with less , but there 's no competing with ` more with more ', 
  yup , you 'd have to partition the hard drive and dual boot . 
  it 's probably best to dual boot and use steam big picture in windows to get all the great windows exclusives past and present . 
  a lot of low level games but on the whole it 's in the hundreds ( 450 ) , whereas ps4 launched with what ... 8 games ? 
  in terms of launch `` good '' titles , linux/sos has metro last light , planetary annihilation , amnesia , team fortress , all the valve-made games , and so on . 
  left one draws in cool air from the angled fan beneath it , the right card ... good question , but same goes for any tri-sli build i guess with the cards slotted together, 
  primarily cost , like $ 360 for the [ power of a 780 ] ( http://static.techspot.com/articles-info/675/bench/bf3_01.png ) . 
  i 've always made sli builds though since it first came out , for whatever reason . 
  i 'm using [ pin steam ] ( http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/en-us/app/pin-steam/e697bf8a-8c25-4236-b701-197db3792ecf ) , it has options to assign your own art if you want ( for the 4x4 tiles ), 
  there 's also driver optimization , and we both know much new drivers can do for performance . 
  i think that 's the gist of squeezing more juice out of the console hardware in terms of ` optimization ', 
  i think you 're thinking of porting , which is the ` round hole square peg ' process of getting a modern ( pc designed ) game on a console 's limited hardware spec . 
  false optimization is like you 're describing , wherein contards say that over the course of the generation games look better on the same hardware . 
  this is like comparing halo 2 to halo reach ... the thing is , have you ever seen halo reach ? 
  horrible frame rates , blurred out upscaled to 720p graphics , and more jaggies than the rocky mountains, 
  steam does have a lot of issues , no denying it . 
  it 's pretty mediocre software . 
  and the [ ti and sc are identical ] ( http://www.guru3d.com/miraserver/images/2012/gtx-660-evga-sc/untitled-14.png ), 
  i did a search for some benchmarks but what i found was [ this bf3 bench ] ( http://facepunch.com/showthread.php?t=1292495&amp;s=139a3a3eb6bbdf570f26ef074d6db7c2&amp;p=41570473&amp;viewfull=1#post41570473 ) - 770 was 82/98 , and the 660 sli was 97/121 ( which is roughly 20 + % for the 660 ) for [ battlefield 4 ] ( http://static.techspot.com/articles-info/734/bench/ultra_1920.png ) the 660 ti sli got around 30 % more ( 12fps ) more than the single 770 . 
  general rule of thumb is if they 're the same price/performance , obviously with the single card because it 'll give you more options in the future and likely have better resale value since it 's newer . 
  in this case the 660sli seems to be both inconsequentially cheaper but with a noticeable amount of more horsepower . 
  i hate to say ` just google it ' but [ it does support sli ] ( http://www.asrock.com/mb/overview.asp?model=z68%20extreme4 ), 
  as for cooling ... tough question . 
  your case is a lot bigger and has a lot more room for airflow than mine . 
  the only fans directed at my gpus is the one angled fan on the bottom left that sort-of gets cool air to the one card . 
  with your case you 're probably going to want to space the cards out and not be forced to side-by-side them like i had to , which will be much better for cooling the things . 
  [ this guy ] ( http://i52.tinypic.com/2eol168.jpg ) has the right idea . 
  also , i do n't overclock and none of my comments have really been with that in mind . 
  i 'm figuring if i oc 'd the cards they 'd get mighty hot in my config , and i 'm not sure how much a 770 could be pushed to close that 20 % gap ( if that was something you were looking to do ), 
  cost $ 650 when i bought it in december 2011 ... 
  i ca n't remember what i did to fix it , but for years i always had connection errors and could never actually log in . 
  i did all the port forwarding , it was still sketchy . 
  yeah , it was for my work laptop , needed the space and had a budget to play with . 
  that laptop got replaced with a mbp w / it 's own ssd , so the crucial ssd went into the gaming rig  ( surely i could not sell it at a 50 % loss !, 
  i have too much * dignity * ),

  have n't done any over clocking so i ca n't speak to anything critical , i got it for the price . 
  as long as the optical audio out does n't bork on me like my last build and it does it 's job , i 'll be happy . 
  i do like the uefi bios management and the ability to boot directly into it from the asrock windows app they provided . 
  never have to hit del a thousand times again just to get in . 
  my old motherboard never wanted to go into setup when i wanted ( good riddance ) . 
  fan management software suite looks pretty good too but i have n't gone into it in detail , i 'm sure enthusiasts would find more use of the options . 
  the 920 is a great chip . 
  the only reason i ditched it during my upgrade was because i could n't find a 1366 motherboard in matx that supported sli, 
  antec . 
  the room i tested in was n't quiet so it was n't a scientific test , but i found plugged into a psu it was kinda loud . 
  maybe they 're fine at a lower rpm but i just did n't care enough to test since i had already bought the antecs in advance . 
  fwiw [ anandtech recommends ] ( http://www.anandtech.com/show/4294/silverstone-ft03-nothing-else-like-it/5 ) running the case fans at a low rpm are noticeable but not a deal breaker, 
   i do n't overclock and none of my comments have really been with that in mind . 
  nothing says maturity like calling people nerdy fags, 
  +1 for gravitas, 
  [ ocing gives no additional performance ] ( http://www.ocaholic.ch/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=1158&amp;page=11 ) but for the price it was available for i did n't see the point in going cheaper and just count it as a bonus feature . 
  the cooler was $ 35 , wanted something quiet , and was n't about to go stock . 
  i played morrowind for months before i found out there was a main quest, 
  welcome to the internet , land of downloads,

  what if consoles took a hybrid approach to the steambox ( upgradeable gpu 's only , for example ) or the ipad ( new hardware every year that 's backwards compatible ), 
  people have no problem upgrading their ipad 's every other year , why should consoles have to stay dormant for a decade at the same price point ? 
  that 's a big if - need the major publishers onboard , namely , ea , especially for their sports ips, 
  sony is more focused on gaikai and their own cloud computing . 
  i 'd say the ps4 has a better chance at transitioning to the cloud than the xbox . 
  good point on # 1 , it 's easier and they are lazy . 
  people can cry but how is this different from the phone/tablet scenario ? 
  nobody griped about needing the expansion pack for n64 , and if you get stuck having to play a game at 30fps while a `` ps4 .1 '' player gets a better experience ... that 's the name of the game . 
  so long as people do n't get outright locked out of playing altogether , and the baseline experience is maintained , then consumers should be fine with it . 
  # 2 assumes they would be set in the pcb , obviously it 's too late to do this now , i was just talking about how to make a modular console for the future ( the ps5 series , for example ) . 
  they screwed up this generation already , it 's dead in the water . 
  the [ mx air ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sehy8vxc5hu ) is pretty much a wiimote, 
  i love them , but pulled them from my previous full-atx build where i did n't have to factor in airflow or space . 
  everything worked out though thankfully . 
  they vary . 
  furmark will push the gpu 's to 90/80 * , while bf4 is more like 70/60 * ( i hopped in on air superiority and it was 59/52 degrees between them ), 
  cpu in games goes from 32-36 *,

  ... and the xbox 360 sold 80 million units . 
  just sayin ' ... 
  twenty plus years . 
  would n't it be amazing if graphics actually advanced so quickly that we needed to upgrade 1-2 generations of video cards every 12 months ? 
  that were n't under warranty ? 
  even if you ca n't play skyrim on max , it 's still going to look better than the console version, 
  eh , it 's a tough numbers game . 
  do n't they still accept repairs for broken ones , just with a fee ? 
  it would be insanity to buy an entirely new console and just throw the rrod 'd one out . 
  i guess live is a good indicator of active gamers . 
  i stopped paying for gold though years ago , even though i still count as an owner * , i 'm sure many own xbox and do n't subscribe .
