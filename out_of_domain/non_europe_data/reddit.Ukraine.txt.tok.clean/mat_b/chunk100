  i remember doing this in the week between the 2.0 update and ttk, 
  also we did hardlights and just about every other kind of fun gun, 
  we also did melee 's only , that was the best, 
  no different than ce when people would debate on how to dps him ( staircase , etc. ), 
  and where to go for ogres before the ledge strat became the standard . 
  also , right now , no-knight strat is such a no brainer and easy i dont know how there is anything divisive about it . 
  people dying during it causes no more rage than people dying during atheon . 
  i agree . 
  i saw a post here saying inconsistency just means you suck against gud players and are gud against scrubs . 
  this is n't the case . 
  i 've done horrible some nights and great others . 
  one thing i 've found to be constant is the days i was doing bad were late at night when i was kinda sleepy , whereas the times doing great i was highly caffeinated . 
  my levels of alertness were entirely tied to my responsiveness and how we 'll i 'd do in pvp . 
  clearly you were n't around for vog . 
  i 've got both and several members of my clan have at least one or the other . 
  it 's not that rare , you 're just looking for it . 
  one day i 'll get a good roll on a grasp of malok . 
  one day . 
  the one and only . 
   there is absolutely no room for expressions of femininity in gay porn whatsoever . 
  shemales/ladyboys/crossdressing porn . 
  oh wait `` those are n't men , they 're ** too ** feminine '' . 
  all this means is that better players use high level gear , and newer less experienced players have lower kds because they are n't gud yet, 
  hey what do you need help with ? 
  mister rahool, 
  bounties or is this some real dancing shit ? 
  in my experience it ranges . 
  one time we did 3 hours and each of us got one , another couple times it was about an hour to get one . 
  last farm was over 4 hours and nobody got one . 
  that said , the farm is fun , it 's like loot-cave on crack and the time really flew by . 
  better have more than just grimoire carry over . 
  they sold this game as a multi-title journey where your character continues on like an mmo . 
  you ca n't just wipe the slate clean . 
  this . 
  i always start with 2/5 done every week , no idea why . 
  it 's never been about skill , it 's an experience number . 
   destiny character progress will carry forward to sequel :, 
   you wo n't have to start over when the sequel rolls around , bungie confirms . 
  then deej confirmed :, 
   `` the idea is that the guardian you have created is something you can bring along with you on that adventure , '' bungie 's david `` deej '' dague explained to ign . 
  `` if you take a look at the way people have played other games for a long period of time , they 've had a relationship with the same character for a very long time . '', 
  what do you mean ? 
  december 2016, 
  its been doing this for me before ib started, 
  oh the salt levels are high in this one . 
  what they need to make is a gatling gun for heavy . 
  tex already has a primary and secondary now . 
  well even ttk was a lot of slate cleaning between itself and vanilla . 
  new economies top to bottom , old gear obsolete , etc. 
  which is what you 're doing right now . 
  i 'm not mad , you 're mad . 
  mad as fuck because i agreed with someone , apparently . 
  crank lever ftw, 
  literally ptsd, 
  biological sex is a social construct, 
  educate yourself , shitlord, 
  basically , race is a social construct . 
  you can be trans-race , and the only acceptable answer is black . 
  *** blackens internally ***, 
  tanning is literally brownface . 
  i 'm going on a cruise in 2 weeks and will piss off so many black people when my skin gets slightly bronzed . 
   this is like calling a ww2 reenactor a nazi because he reenacts the german side . 
  actually it 's like saying you ca n't reenat at all because that would make you naziface and offend nazis . 
  time gating content ? 
  there 's no way they did n't make concept art for full sets, 
  and like you suggest , haake more than anyone should have an lmg, 
  oh thank you kind sir , for professing the rules and policing the mistakes one can make when positively commenting on a post . 
  you truly are a savior of the reddit . 
  35 down , 11 thousand to go, 
  so like a low-impact thunderlord with a massive clip ? 
  hmmm, 
  first iron banner of year 3 , someone figures out a glitch where you get infinite titan turret, 
  because i 'm not wrong and people need to stop getting so fucking offended when they do n't like a comment . 
  like jesus christ , talk about outrage culture at work here . 
  corrective measure had 100 , it would be cool to bring that clip size back with the appropriate catch, 
  that 's a damn minigun !, 
   there 's nothing intrinsically male about xy chromosomes , testosterone , body hair , muscle mass or penises . 
  women can have pensis , you 'd understand this if you were n't an ignorant misotransgynist . 
  yes , it should be like petra and her gun , not eris and her gun . 
  but where are your hundreds of shards ? 
  happens to me constantly, 
  if someone says the word `` meta '' again incorrectly i 'm going to punch them in the kidneys . 
  have n't seen any ttk shaders or emblems from the cryptarch . 
  either it 's glitched like other drop errors they admitted to in the past , or they are time gating it because they are bastards . 
  except it 's not the answer , because if they were taken out they wouldnt be in the kiosk, 
  but maybe its related, 
  i think this is fake . 
  cool , i 've watched it a bunch now , trying to understand how he would pivot and still hit crota when looking the wrong direction ... 
  what are you talking about ? 
  challenge mode gives you extra 320 guaranteed drops and an artifact , it does n't reward you a helmet or specific piece of gear . 
   bungie says here you go , i will now allow you the loot you have needed . 
  you ca n't stop me from using year 1 weapons . 
  that said , i do n't use any of the guns you mentioned . 
  last night i was having fun with the saterienne rapier , high road soldier , zero point lotp , etc. 
  it 's fun to use scouts that are n't the generic omolon/suros shit everyone has now . 
  no , just shotgun = scrub, 
  felwinter or conspiracy theory d , same result , same scrubbage . 
  two archetypes , both are good if you know how to use them . 
  i prefer the thesan . 
   you did n't read the post obviously .
