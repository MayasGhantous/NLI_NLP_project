  it would be so easy for them to just make the game feel so much deeper . 
  the raid machine gun is the best legendary lmg in the game, 
   and leave an entire group of new players out in the cold . 
  talk about over dramatic . 
  i 'm all in on this . 
  reminds me of this girl i saw on okc who identifies as a boy and will kill you if you misgener her, 
  but she is a female and looks like a girl and does literally everything feminine, 
  but dont fucking misgender her special snowflake gender, 
  there 's the multi-regional theory as well, 
  also , homo sapiens and neanderthal ( which we can have up to 6 % of in us ) had a common ancestor spanning a huge geographic range . 
   heidelbergensis originated between 800,000 and 1,300,000 years ago , and continued until about 200,000 years ago . 
  ** it ranged over eastern and south africa , europe and western asia . 
  ** between 350,000 and 400,000 years ago the african branch is thought to have started evolving towards modern humans and the eurasian branch towards neanderthals . 
  i realize the african theory is more widely accepted , but the middle east does include northern africa and we do know a lot of migration happened there , as well as the founding of civilization . 
  they 're statistically the same , i prefer the terminus , both are good . 
  ghost would have been a very good drop tbh , seeing as we just got a 190 blue for her, 
  there 's really no difference between the two other than scale . 
  the ussr was just another name for the russian empire , and a neveaux russian nationalism under the cloak of a ` soviet ' identity that required russification . 
  ran it several times and failed last night , trying to get my friend the spindle, 
  buddy : `` i can do this , dont worry , i can solo this shit '', 
  result : i get more kills than him and less deaths , and we completely fail to do it, 
  i know he can do it , weve done it before , but i fucking hate the fail brag, 
  btw guy , totally adding you , i really want my friend to get this gun and i want revenge on dreviks for last night, 
  wait until those hunter exotic gloves that allow 2 skip grenades comes out, 
  that 'll be annoying in regular crucible , and annoying in mayhem for sure, 
  titan + arammentarium + spamming thermite grenades, 
  oh , it 's fun in a bun, 
  dickcheese mode engaged , more like it, 
  i 'd just like guns or armor to drop for the roll possibilities . 
  it has nothing to do with light level . 
  so bored of feminists who care more about protecting anti-feminist religions than protecting women . 
  because only christians are white , right ? 
   come on though , talk about `` dem invadeeng muslims '' on the tv and nobody imagines white folk . 
  and when people talk about christians , nobody imagines latin americans , but so what ? 
  that 's you . 
  the only arab friend i have is christian . 
  the only muslim friend i have is persian . 
  but based on my area , when i think of muslims i think of pakistanis or somalians first if anything . 
  people do n't think of muslims as a race , i do n't think . 
  the shoe bomber was a convert , mohammed ali ... not arab , malcom x. . . also not an arab , afghanistan ... not arab , half of the toronto-18 were n't arab ... 
  there are racists , like people who confuse muslims with sikhs from india , but that does n't mean all attitudes towards muslims are race-based . 
  i think the terminus is the best option . 
  takes out tons of adds , has a lot of reserve ammo , and the taken damage buff on the raid guns makes it good against majors as well . 
  plus , it 's solar , of course . 
  really ? 
  so far i 've found no use for it . 
  very cool effects and all , but still ... 
  every time . 
  except when it 's the grasp of malok , but that 's only once per group per hour , if you 're lucky . 
  i farmed her for 4 hours just to get ** nothing ** . 
  unless you 're farming , if you do n't run past then you 're just wasting everyone 's time, 
  almost half the class were men , then ? 
  i 've probably put in a good 8 hours at least now . 
  it 's usually 1 per group per hour , except for my `` 4 hours and nobody got anything '' run . 
  last run was the 1/1hr rate again . 
  8 hours for nothing is just brutal . 
  literally every strike involves running past something unless you 're stopping to smell the roses, 
  you kill all the cabal outside the boss ship on cerberus vae iii ? 
  and i 'm sitting here with like 5 , yeesh, 
  wow man , and i thought i had it bad . 
  mostly at the bond drop rate , i 've found it drops at like 4x that of the gun , usually in farming everyone gets several . 
  if you 're on xbox one , i 'm always done to farm btw , gt = mister rahool, 
  could say the same thing about both strikes , you 're not supposed to kill the hive , they 're just an obstacle to get to omnigul, 
  first , kill , wipe , repeat, 
  killing her takes like 10 seconds if you do it right, 
  praedyth 's timepiece / skorri 's revenge archetype , which is my favorite , so i love it, 
  nice . 
  i wonder if heroic has a higher drop rate for strike rewards ? 
  i found that 36 was no better than 16, 
  no , drops on omnigul strike, 
  i have a very good one but i 'd trade it all for braced frame, 
  ( currently have headseeker , perfect balance , third eye ), 
  yup , nightfall boosts the drop rate to like 33 % . 
  when it was darkblade , a fusion would drop for one person every time i ran it . 
  got two to drop in 6-7, 
  what about marine biology ? 
  yes , because i 'm still tier 5 int/dsc with them on my hunter for pvp, 
  didnt realize it was widespread, 
  makes sense , but i fusion errythang and have only noticed it once so far, 
  hmm , i dunno , how can i be sure you 'll be online tonight ? 
  do it on non-heroic , for one . 
  my favorite method is one black hole ( to keep her stuck ) and one blood bound ( if you tether her to all the thralls that surround her , and they all explode and chain damage , it take a huge chunk off ) . 
  two tethers , 2 guys assault her with swords , one hangs back and shoots the thralls/knights to make sure they chain and explode . 
  alpha lupi helps too , lots of orbs are generated . 
  sometimes if she survives and gets loose , i already have a second tether ready because of all the orbs . 
  i agree , esp post nerf . 
  nerf brought it from 24 to 23 a headshot burst , and now headseeker just makes headshots 24 again ... big deal, 
  only 1 of those , but my kinderguardian friend who started this week already has one of those and a 295 treads upon stars ... 
  yeah , next time its in rotation im gon na farm for one with braced fame . 
  i got hand laid stock , and it 's a monster , but i want even more monstrosity . 
  i see we have a non-believer of the church of melty in our midst . 
  but they do . 
  you just ** need ** braced frame . 
  all of my games on pc are 60fps and i do n't notice destiny being lower at all . 
  when my games throttle to 30-45fps on pc i notice the stutter , i do n't really see it in destiny at all . 
  still in ? 
  if you have another we can go now, 
  thanks , was not aware . 
  lovely i ca n't get it back now ... 
  i wanted it for collecting purposes,
