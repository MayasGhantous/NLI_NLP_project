  and look , i waited a bit and stopped grinding , and in a few weeks it 'll be meaningless . 
  and 335 ? 
  ehhhh, 
  yup , and it was always the same 1 weak guy who got the relic on daughters . 
  every time . 
  it became a joke in my clan , he would just apologize and there was nothing we could do , we knew he 'd fail and we knew he did n't want it . 
  on vog you at least were n't forced to relic run . 
  i never got a 320 helmet ... 
  i saw drop dead fred , and yes , there is a magic pill to deal with this, 
  i like my firefly with oiled frame , it reloads like a mida but ... heads esplode, 
  i know , i 'm flawless with it , but for some people it just does n't click . 
  i mean , ever been in in lfg ? 
  it 's a shitshow, 
  bicycles are ableist as hell, 
  it 's literally pictured in op, 
  the obvious answer is you hire a dragonkin because othewise you 're appropriating their headspace, 
  stop the presses , maria pereira made a type of adhesive, 
  i mean , its derivative , and not an invention outright , but put it on the list, 
  why should a law be dictated by the most fringe minority extreme example imaginable ? 
  trans people are .1 % of the population and people who look like that in op are like one of a kind . 
  it 's all that brain and nerve tonic, 
  mmm , delicious nutrients, 
  good point, 
  you basically want whole rows to be reengineered so they can be converted from 3 seats into a 2 person bench on the whim people big enough for this vip comes along and is wiling to pay for it . 
  basically you want business class seats as an option in coach . 
  are you so gay that you ca n't fit in a chair ? 
  it 's okay to hate or criticize any lifestyle choice . 
  it 's okay to think the person being critical is a dick . 
  people are allowed not to like eachother for personal reasons . 
  only a tumblrite can take feminist pride in a song about penis worship, 
   dick bigger than a tower , i ai n't talking about eiffel 's, 
   real country ass nigga , let me play with his rifle, 
   pussy put his ass to sleep , now he calling me nyquil, 
  also having sex with men for drugs :, 
   now that bang bang bang ,, 
   i let him hit it 'cause he slang cocaine, 
  has nothing to do with systematic racism and more to do with poverty and simply committing a lot of crimes, 
   which do not follow a specific different religion than their white neighbors . 
  systematic racism is a myth used to cover up bad homework . 
  you can correlate crime rates with economic values , but you ca n't correlate crime with something unquantifiable like `` systematic racism '' . 
  poverty is n't systematic , it 's just poverty . 
  when you immigrate to a country with no money , you do n't then blame being broke on some phantom system . 
  she let 's him fuck her because he deals cocaine - obviously it 's because she wants a taste, 
   probably , but it 's mostly cause he 's rich - she mentions that a few times . 
  she 's rich . 
  she 's doing him for money ? 
  no , she 's doing him because she likes to party for free, 
  as a ukrainian , i really want to play this game and fighting off the invading russians in a virtual setting, 
   lol i dont know how they can make a game about the eastern front lol, 
  why not ? 
  in the current world , it 's a real warzone with the threat of a russian invasion in those places the leak cites . 
  would give them a lot to work with writing , asymetrical warfare is an interesting take , the baltics and ukraine are all rapidly upgrading their militaries and the us is developing new counter warfare strategies . 
  i think it would be very interesting . 
  right , but that 's more of a corruption issue . 
  what about them ? 
   your decedents are discriminated against in education , jobs , and housing ? 
  except that 's not a real thing . 
   standardized testing is racissssst ! '', 
  but op is white ... 
  thats why they are people of blackness, 
  yes . 
   i 'll tell all the minorities in the 60 's, 
  you have these powers ? 
  men just go around heiling housewives, 
  bitch better have my money, 
  you 're bi and do n't have blue hair and hemp underwear ? 
  gtfo, 
  how dare you call poc cultural practices ` barbaric ' / s, 
  but slavery is a cultural practice of poc that must be respected , you white shitlord, 
  remember when all one had to do to advertise their sexuality was wear an earring on their right ear ? 
  and the only acronymic club was the village people singing ymca ? 
  those were the days, 
   pack it up guys , here 's a proof from south park . 
  that was the punchline from the episode ...

  the logitech mx air mouse also was n't listed so i did n't include it and threw in my backup mouse instead . 
  my tv is a sharp 65 '' that i bought several years ago . 
  the 1tb hard drive was pulled from an old broken laptop i had laying around my office . 
  a lot of the parts i got either on ebay or on black friday sales recently .
