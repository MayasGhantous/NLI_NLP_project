  ( obsidian mind , for example ), 
  ** how to fix it : **, 
  some ideas to fix it, 
  * all uncharged melees have a * chance * to regenerate health ( like suros ) , or, 
  * melee recharges very fast ( like hunter blink strike perk ), 
  both would give the user more incentive to go around punching things and still have the health regen option likely on hand for sticky situations when its actually needed, 
  anyone else get this gun ? 
  thoughts on how it stacks up to corrective measure & jolder 's hammer ( my personal two favorite machine guns ), 
  for stat comparison 's sake :, 
  personally i have n't spent enough time with it to give it a verdict , but unlevelled it feels incredibly stable and ca n't wait to give it a whirl in pvp tonight . 
  this :, 
  according to dtr , i have zero wins / no info for this card . 
  i 've been to the lighthouse several times , but no record towards the ` elimination ' card and score . 
  is this a glitch ? 
  solo 'd the first guy but do n't feel like doing this alone , need a fireteam to hammer this out ( i need to do it twice more on the same character ),

  obviously better if you have a ghorn or something powerful to take quodron down fast , but whatever, 
  i have it on a helm and arms but wondering if they stack ? 
  i ask because while i know melee speed does not stack , inverse shadow does stack ( ie , on helm + do n't touch me for hunter ), 
  also , does anyone have stats on how much it helps reduce cool down ? 
  just wondering if there has been any published info on if the collector 's edition ( with the strange coin & all ) will come with taken king on a disc and the main game on a separate disc ; if they are all on one disc ; or if they will all just come with a download code ? 
  since you need destiny and exp i & ii installed to play it , how will this work without disc swapping ? 
  now , acknowledging that `` other mmos '' progress through the years with better gear rendering old stuff obsolete , i 'm wondering what bungie will do since this is their own animal . 
  i ask about this because recently one popular podcaster eluded to the new tk weapons possibly phasing out the old stuff , and some other forum posts suggesting the same . 
  has deej or any devs made any comments to infer from ? 
  as we all know around these parts , adding etheric light and the ability to ascend our favorite gear was a huge win both from commentators & critics , breathing new life into the game and making everyone finally unique . 
  if they made it a `` year 1 '' only thing , would that not undo all the fan-service they won literally just four months after adding ascending ? 
  i bet iron banner will bring them out in droves, 
  * points * i 'm basically crota,

  edit3 : thanks for the strange coin !, 
  but does it come with emotes ? 
  i hope this does n't become a thing on shores of time, 
  edit : gifv, 
  just wondering since i ca n't seem to find it mentioned ( and some have suggested how great plan c is for spamming the weapon swap to get this perk ) ... but what is the cooldown on its exotic perk ( where you switch to it and it has a super fast charge rate ) ? 
  i find that if i do it once , i can never do it again and it 's really frustrating me . 
  i mean , it 's always there when i respawn , but how long do i have to wait before being able to use it again ? 
  so i tried installing windows 10 on my office pcs ( windows 7 , dells ) and my home pc ( windows 8.1 , custom ) and when trying to install it always asks for a `` product key '' to proceed . 
  how do i get around this ? 
  obviously i tried my current activation keys ( either from the coa on the dells or my current key on the 8.1 system ), 
  you clicked , here goes : prince `` crowboy '' uldren, 
  from gameinformer ( summarized ) : prince uldren leads a squad of his fighters against oryx 's fleet . 
  `` without spoiling the conclusion '' the battle shows us the `` overwhelming threat '' oryx has brought . 
  now from the new trailer :, 
  based on this , i 'm calling it now that uldren has a far less successful russell from independence day moment and dies during the nova bomb in the opening cinematic . 
  maybe this is what causes the `` breach '' we start the game in ? 
  got ta love the hidden glitches still in the vault of glass, 
  forgive me , but i only now found out about this and spent too much time doing this last night . 
  to my dismay , landing on the tower kills you .

  something i noticed while playing last night , but rumble with a 3-man fireteam is the most fun i 've had playing pvp since goldeneye / perfect dark on the n64 . 
  there was always a certain thrill of playing against 2-3 of your friends , and much of this was lost in the online era where your friends were suddenly on your team and you were up against many times more people . 
  team deathmatch , ctf , and other modes stole the show because of their scale and teamwork focused play . 
  but i want to kill my friends . 
  while not 4 way split screen , 6 players is small enough and going up against your friends , and all the laughs and shouting it entails is just a nostalgic , and extremely gratifying experience . 
  i had ignored this mode for a while because the idea of going up against 5 other players seemed daunting , but adding the fireteam component changes everything . 
  will shaders from vendors such as petra , variks , and eris still be for sale after 2.0 ? 
  i 'm assuming today is the day we 'll be peeking into the db for all the new guns , right ? 
  when and where will this take place , some wizard making a thread on here or is there someplace we can all say ( ie , destinydb ? ), 
  i 've still never been able to install windows 10 on my 8.1 machine , always getting the `` oops something went wrong '' error . 
  i 'm installing from a usb drive made from the windows tool . 
  forcing download and installing that way also yields the error , and the automatic way ( with windows telling me it 's time to upgrade ) still says i 'm waiting to be approved . 
  how do i finally install this thing without wiping my machine ? 
  as some of you have noticed the red frontier ghost shell got an upgrade with a bunch of new perks to unlock , making it ( depth wise ) better than any of the ones the speaker sell . 
  the catch is that it has a def rating of 3 . 
  however , infusing is an option , but how do we do it ? 
  i bought a couple shells from the speaker and though they are better and of the same item type , dont allow me to break them down to upgrade my frontier shell, 
  anyone have insight on this yet ? 
  now that we 've had a good 48 hours to renew our affairs with auto rifles , has anyone found a benefit to using focused fire ? 
  in searching the cp some said it increased the overall ttk with the benefit of hitting more crits . 
  is this still a net negative for pvp play or with the auto rifle buffs , is it a viable perk and we just do n't know it yet ? 
  anyone else notice this ? 
  100 % of the green engrams i had drop while grinding yesterday were weapons , none were armor . 
  i love this change as it allows us to grind parts a little easier , but surely this was intentional and not just a fluke 100/100 run i went on ? 
  took some screenshots for those of you who were wondering how the shader would apply on different textures, 
  levelled up [ this morning quick ] ( http://xboxclips.com/mister+rahool/5f648b24-4f2a-4326-bdc6-42e534768739 ) , got a strange coin and a blue engram for a purple package . 
  is rahool back to his old tricks ? 
  just posting up a video since it 's the easiest ghost to get and searching `` cabal 4 '' on here did n't have any results apparently . 
  it 's located in a transdimensional vortex before you even fight the first enemies , after one of the cabals goes boom . 
  unknown in the game with no indicator , using destiny item manager will let you know how many of these bad boys you 've got .

  just wondering if its worth buying stuff now before the weekly reset or if it 'll always be that way for the entire expansion . 
  i finished the ` kill champions ' stuff with petra on the three planets and never got the wolves of mars questline , but my friends did . 
  is there a prerequisite to get it unlocked ? 
  level with house of judgement ? 
  complete main storyline ? 
  something else ? 
  is the cap 9 ? 
  do they just disappear as soon as they appear ? 
  this class is amazing .
