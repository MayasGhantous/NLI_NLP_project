  i am not `` happy '' to be paying $ 180 a year + 60 for this . 
  i could n't care less who it ` weeds ' out . 
  like sleep . 
  i pirated crysis for years and this never happened . 
  usually game instructions tell you to avoid updates and use your firewall to block the . exe from even connecting to the internet altogether, 
  except apple listens to consumers and provides services they want . 
  apple is n't slashing revenue predictions for a reason . 
  i ca n't imagine buying a console for just 1-2 games . 
  that 's an expensive investment . 
  i 'd wager that most people think the wii u is just a controller you buy for your wii, 
  basically just an nvidia shield for your wii, 
  [ ouch ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_r-g_i4xk ), 
  i tried it and it looks nothing close to as good as that pic once the game is in action, 
  i try to keep both pages as updated and as referenced as possible . 
  follow both wikis for the latest verified news if you do n't want to sift through every news source yourself . 
  slava,

  slava, 
  just to help people out since there are a lot of incorrect info graphics out there and maps that just are off ( at the moment , a few major sources are missing chernihiv and putting zhytomyr in when it 's not occupied ), 
  all sourcing is here : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_ukrainian_regional_state_administration_occupations, 
  trying to keep it as updated as possible as news comes in . 
  i wrote the wiki and made the map . 
  the references i used in writing the article are on the page . 
  i could tell by one commercial that it would be like this . 
  i never watched the show but the comments here vindicate my prediction . 
  just to point out , this guy 's maps are always really inaccurate despite claiming they are up to date with time stamps, 
  please [ follow the wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_ukrainian_regional_state_administration_occupations ) if you want up accurate info on the rsa stuff ( by yours truly ), 
  they 've won because of rigged elections , everyone know this . 
  anyway , in 2010 presidentials , yanukovych won with 48.95 % of the vote , the lowest ever in a 2-man race . 
  in the 2012 parliamentary elections , the por got 2 million less votes than in 2007 , but still gained seats . 
  they gamed the system in their favor . 
  today yanukovych has a 17 % approval rating . 
  they do not represent the majority . 
  they are not neo-nazis , they are n't even remotely nazis . 
  do you even know what ` nazis ' means ? 
  they are nationalists , that 's it . 
  and nationalism is n't a dirty word , contrary to russian propaganda . 
  oh please , enough with this bs nonsense . 
  racist ? 
  how ? 
  they make statements about russia , not `` racist '' statements about ethnic russians . 
  what did they say about jews ? 
  is this more bs about how they simply talked about the russian-jewish mafia ? 
  which , mind you , is a real thing, 
  and so what if they promote the ukrainian language in ukraine ? 
  so does every west-leaning party . 
  allowing russian language to creep in is to be complacent with russification . 
  you must be pretty self loathing to find being a patriot of one 's nation and people a `` disgusting ideology '', 
  you sound like a communist . 
  oh my god , please , do yourself a favor and go to school . 
  you have literally no idea what you 're talking about . 
  hell , go to wikipedia and learn a thing or two . 
  you 're conflating nationalism with , possibly , fascism ( `` the state '' ) , which is idiotic . 
  oh please . 
  muscovite is hardly a slur , though it depends on context , but it 's specifically a kremlin jab , not an ethnic jab . 
  he said no slurs about jews . 
  there is a disproportionate amount of jewish billionaires in ukraine - is pointing it out bad ? 
  maybe to an overly pc person looking to whine about something, 
  european observers did not say that , so , cut the bs . 
  there were enough issues with ballot stuffing . 
  could n't field candidates to beat him ? 
  the opposition collectively got 10.1 million votes in the 2012 elections . 
  the party of regions got 6.1 million and communists 2.6 . 
  wake up . 
  exactly . 
  that 's not what nationalism is . 
  you 're inventing this `` superiority complex '' part of things and associating it with chauvinism . 
  i seriously suggest you read a book on the topic before spouting off , since you 're clearly confused . 
  some of ukraine 's best artists and poets are described as nationalists , some of the best historians or masters in fields that promoted the ukrainian identity , language , and so forth . 
  nationalism is loving your nation ( your people , your ethno-national group ) and promoting its cultural advancement . 
  it 's not a matter of superiority , nor is it a matter of subjugation . 
  nations being the organic product of a large homogenous group of people , this led to the creation of nation states after usually principalities of the same people would join together under a common linguistic and cultural understanding . 
  if anything , nationalism is an ideology of peace among your own people . 
  that 's what i meant by gaming the system . 
  what changed in the lap between parliamentary elections ? 
  off the top of my head there were a lot of party-list issues ... and i forget , i 'd have to search . 
  i know the lead up to the election had a lot of arguments in the press as to how election laws were changed . 
  2010 , yes , it was very clean for ukraine but still had irregularities . 
  not outright rigged , but enough complaints that you would n't see in the western world . 
  there is nothing being lost in translation here , i 'm from north america and only speak english . 
  scholar [ anders aslund ] ( http://blogs.piie.com/realtime/?p=4222 ) : `` yanukovych is generally perceived to have stolen the parliamentary elections in october 2012 , which were really won by the opposition '', 
  boom . 
  well that 's just terrible casting, 
  zhyd is n't a slur in ukrainian , only in russian . 
  it 's like how * negro * is a slur in american english but not in spanish . 
  also , moskal is not an ethnic slur , it 's no different than calling someone a yankee or new yorker - it 's specifically referencing the city of moscow and moreso , the kremlin, 
  you must not be familiar with the languages . 
  you do n't seem to understand what ` fascim ' is . 
  it appears to you it means some form of ` racist regime ' , and not the actual meaning of fascism or its politics , social or economic . 
  it 's not considered a slur , even the [ ukrainian ministry of justice ] ( http://www.timesofisrael.com/ukraine-okays-slur-zhyd-for-jews/ ) , it only became a slur in the 1930s due to [ russification ] ( http://books.google.ca/books?id=nd9wziktjrac&amp;pg=pa60&amp;dq=jews+in+ukraine+spoke+russian&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;cd=2&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=jews%20in%20ukraine%20spoke%20russian&amp;f=false ) and the implementation of the russian language in ukraine, 
  in ukrainian , it is not a slur nor has it ever been . 
  and moscovite ( moskal ) is n't a slur , your t shirts mean absolutely nothing . 
  any word can be a ` slur ' dependent on context as you showed : you could have a shirt that said `` thank god i 'm not american , '' but american is n't a slur in of itself , for example . 
  honestly , you 're so out to lunch what 's the point of arguing ? 
  you have this brainwashed point of view and there 's nothing that can change that . 
  good luck . 
  this . 
  rt is such garbage . 
  a two state solution is idiotic and solves nothing .
