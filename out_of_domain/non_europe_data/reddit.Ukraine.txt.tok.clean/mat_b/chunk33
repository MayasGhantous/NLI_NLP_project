   if you can upgrade old gear to the same quality as new gear , the new gear has no purpose . 
  there 's a reason no other progression game does what you 're suggesting, 
  you still just described ** the current system ** for exotics and faction armor . 
  i never said upgrade old vog gear to l36 , but l33 to be in line with vendor gear , for a price , makes all too much sense, 
  as it stands there is zero point or incentive to doing the vog , even more so for new players , which is a serious design fuck up, 
  communication has been a constant issue and being the community manager , that falls under his umbrella . 
  i dunno if he 's doing a good job . 
  i like that he posts on here and lets some of us know some things ... but in the greater picture of things ... 
  actually , the bitch posts would have been prevented if things were properly communicated . 
  people are upset because of bungie 's bait & switch tactics , mostly ( today ), 
  he did n't even address the last snafu at all . 
  he made a post on the site which literally glossed over everything , ignoring the issues people had . 
  til deaf people have no sense of smell, 
  my biggest issue with the dlc is that it removed all of the old vanguard/crucible armor from the base game , and made the raid armor ( which is the hardest in the game to get ) worthless and 3 levels below the new common store armor . 
  they should n't remove items from a game that are in the base game and you paid for , and they should n't make the best stuff in the game immediately obsolete . 
  it 's a big fuck you to everyone who played the game to this point . 
  well you 'll be happy to know all the vanguard armor originally in the game has been removed thanks to the dlc, 
  why run the vog now if it only churns out low level gear , literally lower than anything in the tower, 
  uglier stuff , and why does a vanilla player need to reach 31 artificially ? 
  let 's not wax poetic on this stripped down mess . 
  its very fun , but it 's very limited in content . 
  giving people the strike they paid for is not `` thanking them '', 
  it was bumped up for dlc players , this is a solution to a problem that shouldnt exist in the first place, 
   if you didnt have to get new armor to raise your level what would be the incentive to keep playing . 
  stop you right there . 
  if you 're a new player , what 's the incentive to play the vault of glass now ? 
  the game is rife with lazy design . 
   i 'm glad there isnt a way to level up legendaries, 
  there is . 
  faction legendary armor levels up . 
  did it yesterday . 
  friend got 5 coins , felt bad for him . 
  my friend got it , we 're still trying to figure out the point of it too, 
  why waste an exotic and primary slot on a sub-par sniper rifle ? 
  it would be pretty awful if she just disappeared before you could buy her ... stuff, 
  i got both guns too . 
  we 're lash-hammer bros. 
  even if you dont buy the dark below , the new vanguard armor outclasses vog armor so its useless even for them . 
  i think they need to introduce an upgrade system for vault armor , or transmogrification . 
  some sort of carrot to make people want to still complete those sets of armor . 
  why not buy vanguard gear ? 
  surely if you 're doing tiger strikes you have the marks now to buy level 33 arms and legs from the vanguard . 
  2 vanguard 33s , a single exotic piece at 30 ( the old cap ) , and a 13 light pice ( blue rare crappy gear ) will get you to 29, 
  yup , nightfall . 
  i want the old vanguard gear back , the titan helms suck so much ass now . 
  the new strike is probably the easiest one . 
  you just stand in the doorway and snipe / shoot the hoards that come at you . 
  heck , pot shots from the doorway describes every cheese move in the game . 
  add me, 
  gt : i am the hague, 
  they need something to keep us addicted to to fill the gap , i doubt they stop putting out content for a long duration . 
  assume house of wolves comes out in march ... they just stop and let people quit ? 
  the dlc isnt hard to make when most of the levels are just based on the base game content, 
  it should be better than the new gear . 
  the only thing that should out class vog or ib gear is crota 's end gear . 
  vanguard gear should be at most level 30 , but realistically 29 . 
  you dont understand the concept of progression if what you progressed to is now worthless . 
  it 's actually pushing you backwards , not giving you a carrot to go forwards . 
  you could do hard mode raid as a 29 . just saying . 
  not to mention you could be 30 with the following :, 
  exotic upgraded helm ( -36 light ), 
  single iron banner lvl 30 legs, 
  27 light legendary chest and arms, 
  exotic upgrades alone would have gotten people to 30 , giving them 33 armor easily just deflates the entire system, 
  are you stupid ? 
  10 years ? 
  most people only had this gear for weeks and they spent weeks or months trying to get it . 
  name one . 
  it 's a seeing eye ship, 
  ran it twice yesterday , was easier with my 29 warlock w / revive tbh . 
  he 'll come and have no upgrades for the ones you want , and you know it, 
  they do xp bonuses for certain game types , but they should really do mark bonuses in addition . 
  i 'd play more crucible if i knew i was getting 2x the marks for the day or something . 
  love the boots, 
  at least the exotic weapons and faction armor has an upgrade path , what they did to those who spent ridiculous hours acquiring vog armor is practically criminal, 
  im disheartened because i have a level 26 titan i just made that i was looking forward to running in the vault of glass to get to 29 or 30 as an alt . 
  now that 's not going to happen , because the vog is worthless . 
  i dont understand your issue with the vex . 
  it does 323 damage , the most in the game . 
  we 're running with the icebreaker because in that first section at least , you dont have much time and a single shot can take out a mob of thralls . 
  voc is n't exotic , so it 's an obvious primary in that case . 
  vanguard legendary armor/weapons are not dlc stuff , it 's in the base game now for everyone, 
  wouldve been super spooky, 
  dont even need commendations for half the armor , either, 
   that is how games like this work . 
  bungie does n't even know how this game works , because it allows you to upgrade one half of your gear but not the other half with no rhyme or reason . 
  you also apparently have no idea how games like this work . 
  really !? 
  i always just assumed since it does n't have a number that it was , like marks and rep , something you get after every match, 
  lol you 're clearly new to gaming . 
  stay on consoles , bro . 
  so ... rng , these are the new impossible to find equivalent to faction shaders ? 
  i dont mind the commendations , i already have 2 crucible ones and 1 vanguard and have yet to use them . 
  since they are transferrable between characters , i bet i 'll have a fat stack of them soon enough . 
  just do your bounties . 
  know what my solution is ? 
  maybe this would work better after house of wolves , but we need a ** weekly heroic raid ** . 
  i think if we have 3 raids to rotate between on a weekly basis to run on modifiers for interesting loot drops would give new life not only to the vog , but also to crota 's end when the 3rd raid comes out an we have no use for ce . 
  i had a level 26 titan and wanted to get the raid gear , then the dlc came out and i have zero reason to do the vog anymore with it . 
  i 'm nearly level 30 thanks to the vanguard gear , which is so easy to acquire .
