  `` if you speak , you will be heard . 
  i will go now . 
  you are free . '', 
   he tries to follow it . 
  he fails . 
  somehow it is gone . 
  he goes up to the throne room , and sets his weapon down on the great seat . 
  skolas , kell of kells , goes to the ship 's comm and looks for the sign of a servitor , for the way to plot a course . 
  this has happened to a lot of people , happened to me in week 1 exactly like op, 
  hate the capes , they look like freakin bolsheviks, 
   the second thing is that destiny is aiming for a mmo style release schedule . 
  the new content ( expansion packs , dlc , whatever ) has to supersede the old content, 
  that 's not how mmo release schedules work . 
  they dont release dlc every 3-6 months that deletes all the old content . 
  did not know that , thanks, 
   destiny has n't deleted anything ,, 
  all original and tdb vendor & faction gear is gone from the game, 
  i know , did the same yesterday , shed a tear in its majesty, 
  bloom + angry magic :, 
  it makes nothing manacles on par with arc bolt or fire bolt , basically, 
  he played the odds . 
  they were going to starve or die out there in the cold , there was no moving forward without the sacrifice , and no going back . 
  would it be better if she was raped and killed from an attack by the boltons ? 
  a mutiny from the disillusioned soldiers ? 
  so the lord of darkness is the good guy in this bizzarro world ? 
  no guarantee the city would have been sacked and raped , he was the rightful king , you cant sack it if you want to rule it as your seat of power, 
  i dont go to movies often but i do go alone from time to time if theres a movie i want to see and dont feel like waiting to arrange a ` thing ' with friends , or more likely , i cant find friends interested in said movie ( see : godzilla , hobbit pt 1 , etc ), 
  true , whereas going to the movies has no social aspect , you sit in silence with the person and talk about it after you leave, 
  and the leeches for robb & joffrey ; only balon greyjoy is left and his line of succession has been destroyed, 
  honestly , we all knew that destiny 1.5 would come out in sept for the 1 year anniversary , and we all knew 3rd subclasses were coming, 
  yeah , just 1 more week and we get the deets , and then 3 months to sit on that info with every one else in anticipation, 
  funny , because so far i find the gun pretty shitty , nearly nlb shitty, 
  this sounds like a good use for it, 
  exactly . 
  i feel kind of boned for getting it after it had good reviews on planet destiny . 
  it 's worse than nlb . 
  i am but still , you need targets to be stationary for it to work , if they are moving and you 're trying to headshot with that timer , it 's rough . 
  it needs a huge nerf in pvp , it needs to happen ; the auto rifle buff is separate and also needed . 
  nerf the range and the accuracy or something , right now it 's just way too deadly at a distance . 
  we got 3 underwhelming `` end game '' exotics in how as well . 
  vex remains king . 
  long live the king, 
  if you dont bother with the dregs , then kaliks gets back full health , esp if you 're stopping to kill the captain ( kaliks should be dead before that captain even comes out ), 
  qb is literally less effective than no land beyond . 
  i 'll just assume you do n't have it . 
  well it obviously loses to every other sniper in the game , so whats your strategy with it ? 
  just wait for people to be looking the othe way and staying still ? 
  qbb, 
  got another one last night from judgement 's chance ... sigh, 
  would p0wn u , tr00th, 
  you 're right . 
  would be great , then we 'd have threads on here `` vanguard quartermaster is selling xyz helmet for next 9 hours '', 
  i like being able to rock my 42-light original vanguard helm on my titan , and nobody knows where i got it, 
  i dont mind backwards maps at all , it 's better than using the same map forward twice in a row ( summoning pits , sword of crota , etc. ), 
  how is a major dlc with equal amounts of content from the original base game , not a `` new game '' ? 
  this is n't horse armor . 
  bungie absolutely does not need to keep supporting last gen consoles . 
  all of this was leaked in october 2014 , there were videos on it and everything, 
   this is a leak coming from someone who supposedly recently played `` the dark below '' dlc coming to destiny in december , but will likely be released with the `` mega dlc '' comet : plague of darkness . 
  the new subclasses are : titan crusader ( solar ) , arc thrower warlock , and trapper hunter !, 
  12 new missions , 4 new strikes , a raid , etc. 
  it 's equal content :, 
  sure , but using a map backwards can be an effective way of extending these very short missions . 
  it works for halo . 
  that they are ` infected ' with the darkness and made into zombies goes hand in hand with the original name for the expansion : ** plague of darkness **, 
  i mean the base game should have done that to extend its content ; i agree that expansions should * expand *, 
   this may even be our first opportunity ( outside of the crucible ) to square off against something like a guardian . 
  here 's some concept art of `` zombie '' guardians, 
  yeah . 
  some of it i did n't mind , because it expanded the cosmodrome ... but it would have been better to just make a whole new branch of the complex and attach the new corridors/rooms they made to that , rather than make it half new half old . 
  the best stuff was the new stuff , the citadel & the fallen ketch from the strike . 
  yeah , i didnt even realize it was backwards until we got to that final room / cave, 
  ... well vanilla felt like 12, 
  great news , now i can hone my skillz when my friends dont feel like doing it because they are fed up with trials , or carrying someone , or getting carried with another fireteam , etc. 
  ( depends on who ), 
  why 1 week ? 
  op said it was standard :(, 
  you 're part of the problem, 
  i used it for the first time last night . 
  was dusty from the vault . 
  i felt dirty and like more of a troll than usual . 
  have that too , arms & chest, 
  whoa , i dont remember that one ( with spikes on the top ? 
  pure sanic ) love it, 
  speaking of warlocks though , love rocking my brown leather trenchcoat, 
  the one and only, 
  monitor 2, 
  i like your idea , here is some original concept art for the shrine of oryx, 
  i looked into your light beyond nemesis connection , read this !, 
   these are the ** wings of pratiya-samutpada ** , the truth of interconnectedness . 
  the everywhere light . 
  so i googled the bolded :, 
   states that all dharmas ( `` things '' ) arise in dependence upon other dharmas : `` if this exists , that exists ; if this ceases to exist , that also ceases to exist . '', 
  so are they two sides of the same coin ? 
  is oryx twinned to the traveler ? 
   the term is also used to refer to the twelve links of dependent origination , which describes the chain of causes which result in rebirth . 
  by reverting the chain , liberation from rebirth can be attained . 
  well well well , what else has to do with rebirth ? 
  we never die . 
  we are continually reborn in the light ...
