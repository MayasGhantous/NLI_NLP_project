  as you said , it 's at best microtransaction worthy frivolous junk . 
  stick to the $ 40 version , nobody is putting a gun to your head to get those 3 shaders . 
  its entirely their right to come up with some neat trinkets to pad the collectors edition , just like the original release bundle included the red ghost shell , ship , and other digital stuff that was not released separately ` in a reasonable format ', 
  ** nobody ** is `` making '' you `` repurchase '' anything , just as nobody forced you to buy call of duty advanced warfare to get the blacksmith shader, 
  stupid in light of them already announcing everything, 
  what do you mean by ` taken-ify strikes ' ? 
  i voted with my wallet, 
  and you raise a good point about petra , i guess there will be no way to unlock her stuff after tkk comes out ? 
  that 's messed up, 
  true . 
  very good point . 
  might lock people out of end game exotics they paid for the right to acquire . 
  pretty sure they said they would be gone and new public events would be put into the game, 
  here is what luke smith said in his interview :, 
   if you played during the dark below , you were playing when there were swordbearers everywhere . 
  that 's now gone and you ca n't recapture that now . 
  some things are being left behind as we move forward . 
  it 's the same with house of wolves , right now , with the fallen showing up all over the solar system . 
  those things are going to be less relevant as we move forward and the taken are everywhere . 
   we do n't have a way to go back in time and experience those things again . 
  we are the same , you and i, 
  that would make it the dying mind, 
  yeah but new armor will have void burn perks to reduce the damage on voidberg nightfalls, 
  logical, 
  it 's like chicken mcnuggets, 
  you must really be salty about those 3 shaders & emotes , jesus christ, 
   and because passage coins now have a chance to drop when you lose a game we will probably going to see a lot of people who just go for three losses in a row just for a chance at passage coins . 
  nobody will ever do that . 
  lol, 
  you can only get 1 chest per character though, 
  it 's just a timed exclusive mission that likely blows, 
  most of us who have gone and have all the gear we want are mostly pubstomping for fun at this point , fuck coins, 
  good players play crucible all week and will still have coins, 
  it def punishes people who get there once and want to go again with coins , but heck , you get your coins back from the gold and silver packages anyway, 
  before they realized it was grossly under valued and forgot to add tax , etc, 
  this only means that batman will lose money and expect to see prices rise in the future, 
   however way you try and justify , ttk is more costly than me going down to my local store to buy a brand new game . 
  not necessarily , new games like witcher 3 are $ 85, 
  you guys are going to hate this but the game in canada is $ 45 cdn after tax , which is $ 36 or ** # 23 **, 
  * or $ 32 if we ignore tax altogether, 
  except there is no problem other than entitled assholes crying about shaders they dont want to pay for, 
  so you want a guy fired because you read him out of context ? 
  deal with it, 
  why do you feel entitled to a season 2 pass for $ 20 ? 
  that would mean you want each following expansion for $ 10 each , half of their retail value, 
  you people bitched about how much you wanted the digital items without `` being forced '' to re-buy the game , and now that they provide the option it 's suddenly too expensive, 
  people literally petitioned for it . 
  they provided . 
  yes . 
  so true . 
  one day they are priceless to the point of being worth starting petitions and calling for people 's heads , and boycotting the game . 
  now they 're worthless . 
  pathetic . 
  there was nothing shitty about their original practice , you 're just an entitled idiot who wants everything for free and apparently , was jealous of people who were going to buy the ce, 
  they are already giving the vip stuff for free , why do you think everyone should get even more stuff free ? 
  where is the line ? 
  tk has 1 raid , 1 planet , 3-5 strikes , 3 subclasses , missions , pvp maps , and 2 new pvp modes . 
  and on top of that other stuff they havent told us yet . 
  how is that not worth 60 % of a full game ? 
  at 1500 hours are you really going to nickle and dime over the value of $ 40 ? 
  apparently the vip ` thank you ' didnt matter to you, 
  how is it not $ 40 ? 
  are you thinking clearly ? 
  previous small expansions were $ 20 each . 
  this one is twice the size , so it 's $ 40 . 
  easy . 
  and you want the stuff for free ? 
  do you want the strange coin free too ? 
  as someone still grinding for it , its a massive piece of news for me, 
  it 's a massive expansion . 
  by the sounds of it you had no intention of playing the game , so why are you bitching about shaders and emotes ? 
  you make it sound like you donated to charity, 
  there is a whole site dedicated to its contents , what part are you confused about, 
   im asking to know the contents, 
  you asked a question , i hit reply , thats how this site works, 
  right , so they are deeply discounting the base & exp i & ii into effectively a $ 20 game of the year edition, 
  i hate this and like it at the same time, 
  europeans need to stfu and factor in taxes and actual exchange rates . 
  it suddenly becomes much closer to the us price . 
  stop using the word `` meta '' you sound retarded, 
  so what you 're saying is that we should be paying much much more for house of wolves and bungie cut us a great deal, 
  $ 2.20 per dlc item is pretty standard . 
  9 items , 20 bucks . 
  people bitching here have never seen a steam sale, 
  it is n't # 40 , it 's # 32 , you 're including your tax and comparing that to the us price with no tax, 
  it 's really sad . 
  this sub used to be great but the lunatics are running the asylum now . 
  you cant and i sharded mine recently , new guns are better ( summoner ), 
  uh what ? 
  they should have a non-exotics ` hardcore ' mode or something , but not take them out altogether, 
  for the record , i 've been using a legendary primary all week, 
  this is a slippery slope where we no longer earn things in game but have to buy them a la carte from a digital store, 
  people are opening up pandora 's box here, 
  it should be an emote, 
  i only use thorn for trials to offset the other thorns , i vault it when i 'm done * shudder *, 
   literally game breaking, 
  umm , literally ? 
  but we 're going to wear oryx 's ass as a hat when we kill him ? 
  luke smith = oryx dead king ? 
  confirmed,
