  azman is a kremlin puppet spouting propaganda . 
  no real jewish leaders have spoken out against `` nazis '', 
  yup, 
   amid statements by polish prime minister donald tusk that the world stands ` on the brink of conflict ' , witnesses noted columns of tanks , armored personnel carriers , and a massive rail transport of military equipment being transported in the area of gorzow wielkopolski and slupsk . 
  a spokesperson for the general staff confirmed the movements , but dismissed them as being routine . 
  also , ukrainians in poland have been enlisting . 
  with russia testing missiles and amassing troops in kaliningrad ( bordering poland ) , poland has a realistic threat on its hands now, 
  i do n't think russia is stupid enough to fight nato , but all it takes is one stupid , bold move to start ww3, 
  which quote are you referring to ? 
  i largely wrote the article so ... 
  this is today :, 
   jewish leaders in crimea back ukrainian government , call for russian withdrawal . 
  despite graffiti attack on crimean synagogue , local rabbi labels talk of anti-semitism ` exaggerated . ', 
  then we have this from the euro asian jewish congress :, 
   overt attempts to use anti-semitism as a propaganda weapon against the euromaidan movement have run up against two major hurdles : the facts and a large number of authoritative analysts , historians and human rights activists determined to prevent ukrainians and the international community from being misled . 
  and if ukraine is equipped with high end surface to air from nato ? 
  poland 's missile defenses alone are quite good . 
  of course . 
  but this is all hypothetical , `` if russia invades '' . 
  because `` if '' they do , the baltics and poland go on red alert and may just act on their own . 
  again , if , many ifs . 
  completely agree . 
  then again , i predicted that russia would n't attempt to annex crimea , that the pragmatic ( ` rational actor ' ) realpolitik move would be to exert influence through it ... and then this happened . 
  now the game is predict the unpredictable . 
  look at his tufted ears !, 
  well its confirmed now, 
  sensationalist title , the video itself has people saying they are n't nazis, 
  rt is total propaganda nonsense . 
  cnn is n't . 
  big difference . 
  your trump card is nancy grace ? 
  could always just fact check the links in the article , there are a few cited, 
  `` temporarily conducting military exercises '', 
  so goods from lithuania should be exported by sea to russian ports , instead of by land to russia ? 
  i wholeheartedly agree , otherwise finland may be karelia pt . 
  i agree . 
  must be your phone . 
  economically the baltic states are far superior to russia . 
  latvia 's gdp per capita is $ 14,000 , russia 's gdp per capita in any of the surrounding regions west of the urals ( other than moscow ) is between $ 3,000-7 ,000, 
  as pointed out , it 's significantly better than russia . 
  obviously it 's not as good as western eu states , but that comparison only amplifies how bad russia is . 
  ukraine is more slavic , while russia is more mixed with finno-urgic and hungarian tribes . 
  it 's not about racial purity , it 's about history . 
  they are n't the same people at all . 
  62 % of the country is non-religious, 
  of those who are christians , less than 30 % are russian / moscow patriarchate , the majority of the country are `` western '' by your logic . 
  the only similarities with ukrainians and russians are that ukrainians are bilingual , so it creates a false positive . 
  culturally they are entirely different . 
  ethnically , the two peoples developed in isolation from one another after the mongol invasion , causing ukrainians to interact more with poles and other european peoples , while russians interacted more with finns and hungarians , and dealt politically with the swedes . 
  through the centuries since the expansion of the russian empire to colonize ukraine , russia has always pushed a mythology where the two were a single group of people with similar traditions . 
  outside of a similar root language , and common eastern christianity , there are many differences . 
  russia of course has always sought to dismiss these differences ( `` ukrainian is a dialect of russian '' `` ukrainians do n't have a true culture , they 're rednecks '' ) and so on . 
  edit : w00t gold thx, 
  magyar tribes were abundant in the north during this period . 
  [ here 's a quick one ] ( http://books.google.ca/books?id=98kcfjd6e7yc&amp;pg=pa75&amp;dq=russian+finno-ugric+rus%27&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=ite8usjwcueo2gwui4cacg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=russian%20finno-ugric%20rus'&amp;f=false ) page 215, 
  what ?

  it 's a big conspiracy . 
  if you did n't vote for it , and many did n't , this is a major charge . 
  `` either fight for your new leaders , go into exile , or prison '', 
  for tatars this will amount to a new form of ethnic cleansing . 
  it had it , not anymore . 
  there also were n't ethnic issues with it , as this scenario presents . 
  crimea did not `` vote '' to join russia , unless you want to believe that story . 
  it 's funny because they 're penguins, 
  the prime minister is actually a goblin , 
  they are n't anti-war , they 're anti-ukraine / democracy ( `` ukraine is full of fascists , putin is saving them '' kind of rhetoric ) . 
  others are `` pro slavic brotherhood '' racists . 
  and , of course , the holocaust denier to make matters lovely . 
  `` harper gave money to neo-nazis '' + soviet orange/black colors . 
  ipso facto , ukrainians are nazis , canada should n't support them . 
  loads of russian flags as well that day, 
  it was also promoted beforehand and covered by rt afterwards :, 
  well , parliament was elected . 
  the government was dismissed by the former president , and the current acting government was installed by parliament . 
  that 's democratic to me . 
  it 's also democratic that the first move they did was call free and fair elections in may . 
  he was also in several gross violations of the constitution and a mass murderer , so i think we can spare procedural formalities . 
  he fled the city before he was impeached ; he abdicated . 
  the government was dismissed by the ` democratically elected president ', 
  the first thing the new government , put in place by parliament ( in canada , we should appreciate democratically elected members of parliament , yes ? ), 
  was call for new elections . 
  the only people that are against elections are against democracy . 
  let 's be real here . 
  a bloody dictator was deposed by democracy . 
  so when scores were injured , including dozens of journalists on november 30th , that was equally at fault ? 
  gtfo, 
  if you watched the protests , you would know why they were thrown in the first place . 
  the country was on the bring of being a legal dictatorship and police were killing protesters with live ammo ; others were being abducted and killed . 
  you ca n't compare that to say , protesters in canada ... unless canada was doing the above to its citizens . 
  who cares that he was elected ? 
  hitler was elected too . 
  so because he was elected he ca n't be impeached ? 
  this is such a lame argument . 
  checks and balances are fundamental to a democracy . 
  this is what i did on first playthrough ... to markarth !, 
  from the lobby of the building . 
  what a bunch of losers . 
  there is literally zero pro-russian movement in kherson . 
  at most so far 200 communists have held a little rally , that 's it .
